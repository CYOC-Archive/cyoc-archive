<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the next two minutes, Jeff scrolled up and down the screen before he sat back. Still amused by what he saw, he studied the screen, but still didn&#39;t do anything with the he saw. Wanting to try out so many of them, he thought he should maybe he should start out with one of his favourite animals; a wolf, a fox, an iguana, a cat, or a horse. Considering his choices, he also toyed with the prehistoric selections, and leaning forward, he reached for the mouse and doubled-clicked.<br />
<br />
The information for the fox package pulled up, the teenage boy read through what all it entailed. Seeing it would make him a male red fox with a life-span of about fifteen years, the average life-span of a wild fox the programme stated, Jeff wondered if he should become an animal for a select time or remain as such as he saw an adjustable time set to &quot;Full life&quot;. Mulling over his options, he saw the age was set at three years, the awareness was at nobody knowing Jeff had transformed, not even him, and there was a slider with the information announcing &quot;O% Human - 100% Animal&quot; printed above it. Fiddling with the toggle, he adjusted it one way, then another, watching as the percent of animal and human changed. Setting at &quot;35% Human 65% Animal&quot; he figured this was good, as it still give him some of his old knowledge, but still grant him enough to comprehend how to naturally be a fox.<br />
<br />
His attention leapt back to some of the other things he saw, after some thought, he made more adjustments. Resetting the age to 11 months, Jeff felt it&#39;d be better if he was younger, but not too young. Staring at the sex and gender option, he considered leaving it so he&#39;d be a Reynard, but thinking, &quot;If I am going to do this, and it actually does work, what harm could it be to try and be a female fox,&quot; and going back and forth, he switched it from Reynard to Vixen.<br />
<br />
Slow in his work, he made adjustments here and there. A quick set of commands, and he had it so he&#39;d start to change fifteen minutes after he told the programme to execute the transformation. Inputting more things, he set it so only he was aware of the change, and for everyone around him, life would proceed as normal, they&#39;d think of him as his human self, and nobody would question why they hadn&#39;t see him lately. Thinking about the age limit, he found it didn&#39;t sit well with him for it to be so low, and not understanding why it was, he upped it to forty years total, with no disease or other harmful elements ending his life, but rather simple old age taking its toll.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that it matters,&quot; he muttered as he scrolled through the package and edited a few things here and there. &quot;I&#39;ll only be like this for a year before I transform back.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a few more changes made, Jeff sat back at stared at the screen. The pointer hovering over the option to execute the change, Jeff wondered if he could go through with his choice. Thinking he&#39;d missed something, he found himself tempted to go back over everything to make sure, but then thought, &quot;No. If you do so, you&#39;ll find something, or talk yourself out of something, maybe the whole idea,&quot; and reaching for mouse, he hesitated for a split second before he double-clicked.<br />
<br />
Before him, the screen blinked, the transformation package he&#39;d selected and modified vanished, and a new screen popped up. Reading, &quot;Change with commence in...&quot; he saw a timer appear beneath it. Starting at fifteen minutes, it started to count backwards. Understanding he had this amount of time to do what he planned, Jeff closed the programme, hid the disk, and took one last look about his room. Thinking about how he wouldn&#39;t see it for another year, he kicked off his socks and shucked off his shirt. Tossing the T onto his bed, he exited his room, made sure his bedroom door was secure and not hearing anyone in the house, he stole through the domicile and out the back door.<br />
<br />
Quick in his steps, he waited until he was behind the tool shed before he proceeded to take off the last of his clothes. Naked, Jeff wasn&#39;t sure what to do with his underwear and jeans, and after a giving it some thought, risked the chance he&#39;d be seen and hid them in the tool shed. Already feeling off by the time he exited the shed, he absently brushed a hand against his torso as he shut the door and made his way back around to the other side of the shed. Letting his tongue hang out, he started to pant and not even aware the organ had changed, he squatted down. Placing his hands flat on the ground, finding it was more comfortable to do so, he shifted in place as the off feeling in his chest increased to encompass his head and upper legs.<br />
<br />
A glance down in an effort to see if anything was different, and Jeff was surprised to see not only did he now have four nipples, but white fur had started to cover him. Watching as it spread, and as a russet shade of fur also started to grow in, Jeff shifted in place as a discomfort settled in his limbs. Unable to stand it after some time, he arched his back, splayed his legs and extended his arms out as far as they&#39;d go. Finding relief in this stance as the fur covered more and more of his body, he sighed when his joints popped, and not realising he&#39;d shifted to a four-legged stance, Jeff found himself more interested in his face, which had started to push outward.<br />
<br />
Muzzled formed within minutes, Jeff didn&#39;t have much time to study it, or the whiskers which had begun to appear, as he instead found himself spitting out his human teeth. Finding them replaced by those more suitable for the animal he was becoming, he was soon distracted by the black fur growing over his hands and what was now his lower front legs. Oblivious to the fact he no longer had arms, he lifted and shook each hand to relieve the discomfort in them as they morphed to paws with four toes and a dew claw. Watching this, he missed it as he shrunk down till he was twenty-five inches long as a tail, fifteen inches in length, extended outward and was soon developing fur, and his feet became rear paws with four toes each.<br />
<br />
A total of about five to ten minutes passing, and soon the only thing even hinting he&#39;d at one time been human was his male genitals. But as he squatted down and lifted his tail, Jeff uttered a whimper-like whine and having only the vaguest notion of what was happening, he turned his head to look at the area between his back legs. Seeing his dick and balls, he was struck for a brief moment of how strange to see something so human on an animal before, first his penis, then his scrotum began to shrink. Privates pulling tight against his body, then reforming and repositioning to what was normal for a vixen as the interior reproductive organs formed, Jeff gave a shake of his head, followed by his body before he stuck his muzzle back between his legs to briefly explore the vulva he now had. Losing interest at some time, Jeff peered about the yard, twitched her ears and tail, and thinking she had forgotten something, she found with her diminished human mind, it was hard to focus, to remember.<br />
<br />
Worried she might have given too much to being an animal, she yipped, &quot;Can&#39;t be helped. Need find den,&quot; and sniffing at the area around her, the eleven month old vixen pushed her way through the hedge separating the backyard from the alley after some time and started in the direction her senses told her was a place she could find what she needed.</p>
