<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The glowing water fell down on the deck of the cruise ship which was now somehow resting on the bottom the sea in a pocket of air. The top deck of the ship was full of people who had been out enjoying the pool or walking along the deck. Those people quickly began to get soaked by the water and while some attempted to head back inside others found that they were unable to move. Unfortunately, even getting a drop of the water infused with the transformation magic <br />
<br />
Among those who had been caught in the rain was an almost 80-year-old women, named Susan who had been on deck awaiting her family as they enjoyed a cruise together. Once she started to get soaked Susan turned and started to head back inside as fast as she could go. However, at her age, going anywhere fast was next to impossible. She had only gone a few steps before she stopped in her tracks and let her cane drop to the deck.<br />
<br />
She felt so much better, her joints no longer hurt, all the aches and pains that came from her years of life quickly faded away. She turned her eyes down to her arms and saw the skin was now tighter and the youth was returning to her skin. <br />
<br />
What she couldn’t see but she felt some of it was her gray hair regaining its natural blonde color returned as well as become brighter and bolder than it ever was. Her hair grew longer going from her shoulder blades to back down to the small of her back, that was the height she had for most of her life. She felt her skin tighten as her muscles returned to her body after falling away from age. She was able to stand up to her full height for the first time in years, she didn’t notice that she grew in height a couple of inches. <br />
<br />
She raised her head up toward the “sky” as she began to enjoy the water changing her body. She wasn’t the only one who had been running to get inside who where now enjoying the water and the changes washing over their bodies.<br />
<br />
Susan’s body quickly began to get younger and younger until she was no longer a woman only two years away from her 80th birthday to a beautiful woman who looked to be between 35 and 40. Every scar disappeared from her skin, the stretch marks from her pregnancies disappeared, her breasts lifted and became larger and firmer then they where when she was a 22 year old women at Woodstock in 1969. <br />
<br />
Maybe it was the fact that she was now returned to her youth, maybe it was because she wanted more of the water to hit her flesh or maybe it was the knowledge flooding into her mind from her goddess. She removed her blouse and her pants kicking off the old granny underwear she had on, because that wasn’t part of who she was anymore and the goddess she served and loved. <br />
<br />
Yes, that was part of the transformation, her mind was filled with the truth, the truth of her goddess, the goddess Aquaris the Queen of the Ocean whom she would follow every command that she could. <br />
<br />
Scales were quickly forming on her legs as they began to form together.<br />
<br />
“Lay down my child.” said Aquaris’s voice in her head as she laid down onto the deck of the ship as her legs lengthen and fused together a rich mermaid tail covered with green scales began to form. It wasn’t just one shade of green but a rich mixture of dark, light and neon green scales which covered her legs up to her hips as a classic mermaid tail formed. <br />
<br />
“Thank you, my goddess, I will serve you and the sea in every way I can.” said Susan as she touched the gold cross on her neck. That cross was a gift from her mother on her wedding day but it was a sign of a faith she knew now to be false, only Aquarius was true. And she had to serve her, and she knew her duty. <br />
<br />
Her duty was to transform everyone on this ship, to protect her new species and of course to make new ones. To that end, she looked at her wedding band, that was a sign of love with her husband, and she was looking forward to carrying out that last duty of making more merpeople. Her eyes now scanned the deck at the many mermaids and mermans, there were more mermaids but she knew about that as part of the change. Her eyes looking for her husband, maybe he had become a mermaid if so, that didn’t matter to her anymore like all merpeople she was bi now and proud of it. If he was now a mermaid then they would just have to find a merman both of them liked.<br />
<br />
If she couldn’t find her husband maybe another member of her family was nearby so they could join the ocean with her help.<br />
<br />
Finally, her eyes found someone.</p>
