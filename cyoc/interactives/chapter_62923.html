<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now you the princess was wondering why your father the King<br />
and the other observers had put on face masks whilst no one<br />
had the courtesy to offer you one.<br />
            A few seconds after the dogs transformation you really<br />
wanted a face mask when the containment spell broke down under <br />
the corrosive effects of the pink mist.A huge cloud of mutagenic pink <br />
mist rolled out and enveloped you.The other folk with face masks<br />
were alright but you obviously should have been having shape shifting<br />
issues.<br />
        However both you and the mutated dog breathed the mist with<br />
no further ill effects,though you did cough a little.The ex-dog seemed to <br />
thrive on the stuff.<br />
        After several minutes the magical scrubbers cleared the lab of the <br />
mutagen and when the &quot;All Clear&quot; budgie began to resume its trilling,the <br />
others took off their face masks and heartily began to congratulate<br />
themselves and you.The war beast was hauled off,to begin its service<br />
against the orc hordes of the Horrible Nameless Abonimation that <br />
threaten both your dads Kingdom and the dragon kings Kingdom.<br />
         Naturally you were beginning to have your questions,but your <br />
father shushed you and led you to the castle's banquet hall.<br />
          You joined the other ladies and were just getting your nerves settled <br />
when the dragon king and his entourage of dragon,human and elven folk<br />
entered and began taking their places at the dining table.When both your <br />
father and mother greeted the dragon king as &quot;Lord Bufford&quot; you<br />
stifled that scream in your throat and decided to wait for the explanation <br />
to the mysteries that were piling up.<br />
<br />
           +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
           Lord Bufford sidled over to you and asked you to join him and your parents <br />
at the Royal Table.You shuddered,since he looked so like the dragon king,but<br />
accepted his invitation.<br />
              The minstrels,bards and actors began telling the <br />
histories of the two Kingdoms.<br />
        'As we all know the human Kingdom has always craved the riches of the <br />
Equine Land,and because the mountainous land of the dragon Kingdom sat <br />
 in between,the two Kingdoms had been forced by geography to be<br />
friendly enemies at some times,and uneasy friends at other times.<br />
         Down to the south across the Endless Ocean lay the huge southern<br />
lands of the Fair Ones,the elves,leprachans,fairies and everyone else.<br />
          It just so happened that Captain Brave was a elve,and the elves <br />
a half century ago were making great strides in adapting their flying<br />
galley technology to the first subaethersphere flying towers.&quot;<br />
         At this point Gandalf the Kingdoms Wizard waved his hands<br />
and a magical image of a metallic needlelike elven flying tower<br />
being hauled aloft by a sling of millions of fledgling Moon ducks and<br />
geese began to flickering around the banquet hall walls,<br />
accompanied by a much younger sounding Captain Brave calmly<br />
counting series of numbers at the Moon birds achieved maximum <br />
lifting capacity.Then came the triumphant shout of test pilot Brave <br />
shouting in elvish &quot;Tora Tora Tora &quot; as a million straining honking <br />
quacking Moon birds hauled up the flying tower into the <br />
subaethersphere.<br />
           You the princess glanced over at Captain Brave,who had a longing <br />
look as he gazed up at the Moon overhead the castle.Ah,the dream dashed by <br />
the Horrible Nameless Abonimation 49 years earlier.You the princess <br />
glance back at the flickering image of a metallic tower hoisted up by <br />
a million yellow feathered Moon birds and realize the masses of moving yellow <br />
birds underneath the flying tower look a awfull lot like the images<br />
of the metal pole shooting fire you had in your dream.<br />
             What you and Captain Brave don't see is cunning Kingdom Spy<br />
Master Cardinal Richelieu eyeing the two of you from time to time.<br />
<br />
             ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
                  The minstrels,bard.Gandalf and actors move on to the <br />
next part of the evenings entertainment ,the tale of dragon king,his <br />
twin brother Bufford and the unicorn lady they both loved and split<br />
over,Lady Esmeree,the shape shifting Unicorness.<br />
         &quot; Now it came to pass that when Old King Fafnir died at the <br />
hands of the human Siegfried,the dragon Kingdom passed to his <br />
sons,the twins dragon king and Bufford.Over the mountains from the <br />
Equine Land came Lady Esmeree,who both dragons fell in love with.<br />
However just when it appeared Bufford and Esmeree would be mated,<br />
dragon king came along and stole Esmeree and the Kingdom.Bufford <br />
went into exile amongst the humans,and any hostility he felt towards humans <br />
melted away when the 1rst Knights slipped into his former home and rescued <br />
Esmeree from the clutches of dragon king and brought her to safety in good King <br />
Olaf's reign.&quot;<br />
        You blush ,since King Olaf is your great grandad.You the princess blush even <br />
more when Gandalf conjures up a old grainy news reel of Emeree,in her human <br />
guise ,riding the street in front of the castle.She's your spitting image.As<br />
your true parentage dawns on you,you look apon Lord Bufford and<br />
realize either he or dragon king is your daddy and your mommy is a long<br />
vanished unicorness.<br />
           You hadn't even touched the ale in front of you but now you <br />
down it in one gulp and ask the servant for a refill.You feel all the <br />
eyes in the banquet hall boring into you,and you wonder how long all the <br />
human friends you have have known your a dragon-unicorn hybrid.<br />
         Apparently Captain Brave didn't catch on,because he's still<br />
gazingly longingly at the Moon.<br />
<br />
                 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
            The entertainers get to the meat of the tale,the arrival of the <br />
Horrible Nameless Abonimation in the Fair Lands.<br />
          &quot; As we all know Harold the (HNA )totally conquered the Fair Ones,<br />
except for the few elves who fled in their flying galley's to the Northern <br />
Lands across the Endless Ocean.These beseeched both the human <br />
Kingdom and the dragon Kingdom for aid,and the 1rst Knights charged <br />
south and soon found themselves embroiled in a battle with orcs,who <br />
Harold the HNA had created from elven people he'd transformed into huge<br />
hulking ape things.<br />
         Now the Dragon Guard was a little tardy,because they insisted that<br />
their old commander be allowed to lead them.Their old commander<br />
was Bufford.dragon king was reluctant,but in the end the two quarreling <br />
twins agreed to share command of the Dragon Guard.&quot;<br />
          At this point Gandalf conjured up a old news reel of dragon king <br />
and Bufford clobbering orcish hordes of ravening ape men,and you <br />
were somewhat shocked to see a unicorn in the mass of Dragon Guard that <br />
surged forward to do battle with Harold the HNA's army of evil transformed <br />
Fair Ones.<br />
           &quot; Alas the Dragon Guard did not prevail,and was forced to<br />
flee back to the north.They did learn one interesting fact however,<br />
dragons and unicorns were immune to the pinkish fog that Harold the <br />
HNA exhaled to transform his elves into orcs.&quot;<br />
          As the horrible truth dawns on you,it also finally dawns on <br />
Captain Brave.Your father the King is using potions derived by the <br />
enemy to the south to create his war beasts,such as that transformed <br />
dog in the lab earlier in the day.<br />
<br />
        ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
             At this point in the entertainment,some of the masked<br />
mystery bards pull off their masks,to be revealed as the 1rst<br />
knights.Whilst all the other minstrels,bards and actors file off the <br />
stage and head for the ale vats,Gandalf and the 1rst Knights tell<br />
the story of their escape from the corrupted Fair Land.<br />
       &quot;The 1rst Knights had gotten lost in the pink mists and were in<br />
danger of transforming into more of Harold's minions.Out of the mist<br />
came a unicorness ,who touched each of the gasping mutating <br />
1rst Knights and restored their humanity.Then she led the upright warriors<br />
out of the mist and to one of the last uncorrupted areas of the Fair Lands,<br />
the flying tower complex located at Cape Charming.<br />
            Now the elves had finally gotten to building a flying tower<br />
with enough lift to give lucky elves a shot at the Moon.As the saying <br />
goes &quot; This is a Moon duck,this is a Moon duck on steroids&quot;<br />
Harold the <br />
HNA's arrival had ended that,however the flying tower and its Moon birds<br />
was all suited up and Astronaut Brave and the elven scientists had done the <br />
geometry and realized the flying tower would be capable of a trip across<br />
the Endless Ocean with 300 brave souls aboard.There just happened to <br />
be 270 Fair Ones at Cape Charming,and things looked like a go till the <br />
300 warriors of the 1rst Knights and a unicorn showed up.<br />
        There was a lot of haggling between the desperate 1rst Knights<br />
on the outside of the flying tower and the Fair Ones in the inside.The <br />
appearance of the pink mist off in the distance didn't help matters.<br />
             In the end Astronaut Brave permitted 100 of the humans to board<br />
Moon Tower Galatea,but the unicorn and 200 of the humans would have <br />
to to stay.<br />
          So it was that Lady Emeree and the 200 doomed 1rst Knights<br />
charged into the mists to give Harold some whatfor.<br />
         Things were looking pretty good for the launch of Galatea <br />
As could be guessed,Moon birds with nothing to do make more noise<br />
than Moon birds concentrating their energies on flapping their wings and <br />
lifting heavy slings.The Quackometer was descending as maximum <br />
lifting capacity was rising.Hence,when the Quackometer reached zero and <br />
the only sound was the flapping of wings,liftoff was about to happen.<br />
when a stray <br />
lightening bolt struck one of the gangs of Moon birds straining to lift the <br />
already overloaded Galatea.All was doomed.The quacks returned.<br />
         Then Astronaut Braves co-pilot,his sweetheart Camilla,blew<br />
him a final farewell kiss and lept out the cockpits window onto the <br />
scaffolding beside the flying tower.Brave gave a despairing cry<br />
as with a thunderous silence,Galatea lifted off the <br />
ground as Brave looked down apon his sweethearts dwindling <br />
figure looking up at him.<br />
<br />
             +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
             Lord Bufford picked up the tale at this point<br />
          &quot; I and the rest of the Dragon Guard were put leaques from our <br />
homeland when we heard the loud birdly noises of the approachng<br />
Moon Tower.As we watched,the exhausted Moon birds began to fail<br />
and the elven Moon Tower dropped lower and lower towards the <br />
Endless Ocean.<br />
          We brave Dragon Guard made haste to the doomed ship in our <br />
dragon carriers,and arrived just as the flying tower hit the waters.Good<br />
elve Brave saved many who otherwise would have drowned by shooting <br />
streamers of bird food in the air,which kept the flying towers propulsion <br />
gangs flying and in the air,keeping the Galatea afloat long enough to save <br />
all but 10 of the 369 souls aboard....</p>
