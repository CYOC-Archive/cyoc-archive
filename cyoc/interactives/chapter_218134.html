<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Really? Charlie? Cheating?&quot; Skyler sat across from Mel on the couch, her best friend since high school, he held a beer in hand as he looked at her skeptically. &quot;That man is so straight-laced. I can&#39;t believe he has it in him.&quot; Skyler always had an air of purposeful dishevelment about him. His blond hair a styled mess, scruff on his chin, though his clothes were always picked out carefully to look almost but not quite lazy.<br />
<br />
Mel understood her friend&#39;s cynicism. Her husband really was usually the man that did everything right, always admitted when he did something wrong, and was a piss poor liar to boot. It was one of the things she liked about him. So she pulled out her phone and opened up one of her photo albums handing it over.<br />
<br />
Skyler&#39;s brows shot up as he flipped through it. She already knew what he was looking at of course. Screenshots of a gay hook up app she had found on Charlie&#39;s phone. She had seen it while snooping on his phone when he was in the shower. He had become more protective of the device in the last few months, so she expected maybe he was surprising her with something, then of course she thought maybe he was cheating when no surprise came. It was not what he had been expecting. There were even a few conversations on the app she had grabbed, pictures exchanged. She had screenshotted it all and sent it to herself, luckily remembering to delete the evidence she had done so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he certainly has a specific taste. Woof.&quot; Skyler said, as he flipped through. Specific indeed. Every conversation was with an older man, usually a muscular bearish type, but any older man with an athletic body seemed to interest him. He even gave a wolf whistle at a few of them. &quot;Hell, I&#39;d like to get a few of these in bed myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sky!&quot; Mel said, reaching over to snag her phone back. &quot;This isn&#39;t funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, do you know if he actually hooked up with any of them?&quot; Skyler asked, leaning back into the cushions.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; In fact she had scanned most of the messages. And while there was flirting and some pics exchanged, he had always backed off when anyone mentioned actually meeting up. &quot;But it&#39;s still smarmy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed.&quot; Skyler looked suddenly thoughtful, then grinned. A grin she knew too well, and one that usually meant he was up to no good. &quot;Why don&#39;t we test him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Like.. a catfish?&quot; Mel asked, watching as Skyler stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly. We make a fake profile, you see if you can lure him out. He might be covering how he&#39;s hooking up with them. Then we can nail his ass to the wall.&quot; Skyler disappeared into his bathroom, and Mel could hear him rummaging around.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that might work. Do you know someone we can get pics from? He seems to like to exchange those. Hell, what if he&#39;s hiding hook ups by video chatting to set it up. How are we going to do that.&quot; Mel looked down at her phone, grimacing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to do it.&quot; Skyler said, coming out of the bathroom holding a bottle in his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? What with a filter?&quot; Mel frowned, looking over at her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember Jason?&quot; Skyler asked as he flopped back down into his seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;The frat boy jock guy you dated last year?&quot; Mel asked, getting a nod in return.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he had a certain fetish, one Charlie might share. So, to keep things going I got some pills to help. Sadly, it just gave him the confidence to go after someone more his type so we broke up. Pity, he had a huge..&quot; Mel cut Skyler off with a look. &quot;Anyway.&quot; He leaned forward and set the pill bottle on the table. &quot;I&#39;ve been saving those for a rainy day. Take one and you might just end up Charlie-boy&#39;s type.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel picked the bottle up and looked at it. &#39;DILF Pills: 10 hr.&#39; was on the label. She had heard of them of course, and the MILF pills, but she hadn&#39;t thought of every using them. &quot;Why shouldn&#39;t I just use what I have to leave him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyler just shrugged. &quot;I mean, you could. But this way you could get evidence to get what you want out of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what does DILF Skyler look like?&quot; Mel teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe one day I&#39;ll show you.&quot; Skyler retorted. &quot;So? What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard there can be some.. variety. What if I end up not his type?&quot; Mel asked, frowning down at the bottle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I can do it. DILF Skyler is up his alley, but I think it&#39;s better if you try. You might want to strip. The change takes a bit, but it will fuck up your wardrobe.&quot; Skyler grinned a little too eagerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Now?&quot; Mel asked, almost jumping out of her seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;No time like the present to see what we get, besides we need a pic for the profile. Maybe you can snap a few shots to send him while you chat him up,  too. Good thing he&#39;s never seen my apartment, he won&#39;t recognize it in the photos.&quot; Skyler motioned to the pill bottle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; Mel stood up and started to strip down, then shot Skyler a look. &quot;Maybe some privacy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, it&#39;s not like you have anything I&#39;m interested in.&quot; Then after a pause. &quot;Yet.&quot; He held up his hands at another sharp look and stood up , he grabbed Mel&#39;s phone and turned to wander off into his bedroom. &quot;I&#39;ll start getting the app downloaded and set up. Call me when you&#39;re done, then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once he was away, Mel stripped down all the way. She took a look down at her slim, feminine body, then let out a soft sigh. &quot;Well, it&#39;s only for a few hours.&quot; Then opened the bottle and tapped out a single pill. With a sigh, she swallowed it, then closed the bottle and set it down.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long befor..?&quot; She had begun to call out to Skyler, stopping as her voice cracked mid sentence dropping about an octave. Apparently, not long, soon she&#39;d see what sort of DILF she made.</p>
