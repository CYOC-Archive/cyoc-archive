<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He looked everywhere for the thing.  High. Low. He just couldn&#39;t locate it. After an hour of searching, he decided to take a momentary break to think. It had to be in the house. It just HAD to be!<br />
<br />
He looked at the time. 3:30! An hour and a half left! It would take about an hour to walk to his mom&#39;s house! <br />
<br />
45 more minutes of searching, and Anthony decided to just give up. He went to the room that he now refers to as &quot;the computer room,&quot; and shut the door.  He turned on the bright top light in order to get a good look at himself . He didn&#39;t gaze upon his image all that much over the past 23 and a half hours. In fact, he purposely avoided looking at himself in mirrors and glass. But this time, he wanted to really study what he has to live with now.<br />
<br />
Upon looking in the mirror, it was a shock to see young Charlie Bennet looking back at him. Even more of a shock when he moved his hand exactly how Anthony moved his. <br />
<br />
Stepping up to the mirror for and even closer look, he noticed his eyes were bluer than he thought Charlie&#39;s were. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least I&#39;m not ugly. But neither am I a chick magnet either.&quot; <br />
<br />
The thought of girls didn&#39;t turn him on. <br />
<br />
&quot;At least Gino and my former body will accept me,&quot; and the thought of Gino and his dad made him blush. <br />
<br />
He continued studying himself. Deal his slightly pale skin tone, his face did have some color in them. It was a rosy reddish color, almost like what his cheeks used to look like when he was cold. He didn&#39;t realize he was blushing, nor that his new genetics made it easy for him to blush. <br />
<br />
His face was kind long and skinny. Almost like a horse&#39;s face, but not all that extreme. His hair, which he still hasn&#39;t gotten used to having, was completely different from his nearly-black, wavy, nearly curly hair he used to have as a kid this age. It was straight and it moves with his head. It is a light, dirty-brown in color. And a slight part with the bangs on the right. His nose was much thinner than it used to be, which almost made it appear to be long. <br />
<br />
His ears were shapely. They were big. They didn&#39;t stick out. And they weren&#39;t too small. So he need never be self-conscious about that much at least. He opened his mouth to look at his teeth. Yellow! With one that was crooked! Long front teeth that gave yet to wear down, as he&#39;s just a young teenager of 14 years old. <br />
<br />
He took off his shirt. Thin, but at least he didn&#39;t have any bones sticking out. His breast bones had a decent shape. There was just enough muscle and fat on his chest to not show his ribcage. But still thin. <br />
<br />
No 6 pack, though. Not even a 4 pack! Just the smooth upper body of a kid. No real biceps, either. Just a little bump. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I&#39;m not exactly going to be benching 300 lbs anymore. Maybe not even a hundred! At least, not for quit a long time.&quot; Then he thought about all of those hours and hard work he put in at the gym with his twin brother for the past 20 years! <br />
<br />
&quot;Wasted,&quot; he thought dejectedly. &quot;Well, not exactly &#39;wasted.&#39; At least Charlie gets to enjoy the shape of my body.&quot; Then he felt his stomach drop as he thought how he would never have his handsome, strong body and face ever again. He will never have a relationship like he had with his twin brother. All of that was lost to him now. Given to someone else to have. <br />
<br />
Sighing, he continued checking his youthful body out. He had that fading bruise on his forearm near his right wrist. His arms and chest devoid of ant hair. He lifted both arms up, and saw the smallest of light brown dusting beginning to emerge. <br />
<br />
&quot;God, I&#39;m so YOUNG!&quot; he thought. <br />
<br />
Moving on, he kicked off his dirty old-looking black shoes with that green trim. Stuck wearing a teenage boy&#39;s shoes, as that teenage boy! <br />
<br />
Dark blue ankle socks adorn his long, narrow feet. He bends over to take them off. His toes are long and skinny, a bit like his fingers are. And like his fingers, the nails are in excellent shape. Another asset he doesn&#39;t have to be self-conscious about. At least he&#39;s not a nail-biter. <br />
<br />
He finally begins to pull his sweat pants down. Underneath, is his form-fitting blue briefs with the gray band. The underwear grips his penis and balls perfectly. But it&#39;s someone else&#39;s used underwear he must wear, while as that person! <br />
<br />
He steps out of the pants, and sees his long, skinny, hairless, pale, shiny, smooth legs. <br />
<br />
He delayed pulling off the underwear. All-in-all, it wasn&#39;t a bad body to be stuck with. Staring at himself and thinking about how he is now Charlie, and seeing his body that isn&#39;t his, he was getting strangely turned on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least I&#39;m a boy.&quot; <br />
<br />
That thought did it. His sexual drive spiked up, and his long, thing little penis with decent-sized balls attached, came to life. He grabbed himself through the fabric of another boy&#39;s underwear and squeezed. Looking in the mirror, he was just a kid &quot;discovering&quot; himself while in the midst of puberty! That&#39;s what Anthony is now. <br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t me. This isn&#39;t my body! This isn&#39;t who I&#39;m supposed to!&quot; But the thought he is going to be stuck donning that Charlie&#39;s face and that&#39;s all anyone will see when they look at him, was an &quot;explosive&quot; thought. Both literally, and figuratively.</p>
