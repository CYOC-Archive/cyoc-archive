<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jack approached the bikeshed he put his bike on the rail quietly as if not to draw anymore attention to them. Their neighbour unfortunately had spotted them from a distance and waved their hand to still aging 40-year-old July.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeyyy. Your mother was moment ago outside looking kinda worried. Has anything happened?&quot; The nosy neighbour asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not that I know.&quot; July dismissed and tried to ignore her presense while Jack went inside the house.<br />
<br />
The neighbour tried her best to pester July by asking for juicy gossip topics for her, but with no results. July found it odd that their neighbour treated her like if she knew her. Maybe the ring itself didn&#39;t change age, but status that came with it. But July then quickly excused herself as she put her now more adult bike into the shed next to Jack&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Inside the house July witness as Lucy was hugging Jack and stood up to ask July where they had gone to.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were playing outside. Jack was pretty disstressed by what had happened.&quot; July responded while untucking the ring behind her back.<br />
<br />
Funnily this was a lie in July&#39;s head but for some reason her sister believed it and asked if she had seen the ring. On that moment she dropped it near the table and pretended to find it on top of the mat where the table was.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean this? You should keep good care of it. Also...&quot; July sighed as she could smell herself and noticed that she was covered in sweat from head to toes. &quot;I&#39;m going into the bath. So if you need me, you know where I am, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy watched as July casually walked to the bathroom while Jack sat on the sofa and turned on the TV. Lucy then approached Jack and asked what they were playing and Jack responded, &quot;we were talking and umm, biking I guess?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy felt an odd sensation as her breasts and belly gained a little bit volume. She was sitting next to her son while her daughter Amy was trying to reach a friend of her&#39;s. She let out a audible sigh and asked if Jack wanted something to eat. Jack just shrugged and kept watching the TV as if he was exhausted.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ever since my dad- I mean my husband left. My sister has moved here to take care both Jack and Amy for me. I&#39;m glad that she and Jack are doing well atleast.&#39; Lucy thought to herself and went to the kitchen<br />
<br />
In the showers on the basement floor July was finally able to smile and inspect the new mature body she had gotten. She had taken a measuring tape to check the exact inches she had gained. She closed the bathroom door, took off the borrowed clothing and dumped them into a corner.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m glad that I looked like a sexy cougar&#39;, she thought as she begun to measure her bust size. &#39;40 inches doesn&#39;t sound that bad for my size. Sadly my sister&#39;s huge rack is bigger, but atleast my butt is the main attraction.&#39;<br />
<br />
She begun to measure but noticed that the tape couldn&#39;t reach their tips.<br />
<br />
&#39;Wow, my ass is atleast bigger than 80 inches. There&#39;s like two and a half hands spare space left.&#39;<br />
<br />
She put the tape lower until it&#39;s tips could meet at her knee and upper calfs exact at 80 inch point. July had gained a very extreme sized pear body where her ass pushing out like an pillow.<br />
<br />
&#39;If my body looks like this when I&#39;m 40. How would it look like if I was a just a bit younger.&#39; July wondered as she glanced at her crow&#39;s feet. &#39;I mean if I play my cards right I could youthen myself by ten or fifteen years. How was that neighbour again? Must have been in her early 30s if I recall.&#39;<br />
<br />
July came up with a plan that tomorrow she would seek out their neighbour, swap their ages and then enjoy her youthful life.<br />
<br />
Lucy in the kitchen started to adapt to her new motherly lifestyle. She couldn&#39;t remember at all why she was so shocked moment ago. She could only recall bits and pieces of the emotions and memories she had moments ago. It had something to do with the ring, but she was busy making food for her family.<br />
<br />
As Amy approached the house she had lost a couple of pounds of her weight and her chest had shrunk a little bit. The darkened areolas were more pinkish and there was no signs of her giving a birth to any of her children.<br />
<br />
The house looked deserted house with halloween decorations being still held outside at the summer heat. Amy was sure that her friend lived here since she had played- no visited her when she and her mother Lucy visited the place. Amy could feel a small headache and shivers as she walked near the porch of the building.<br />
<br />
And before she could run the bell, the door creaked open and behind that door was ...</p>
