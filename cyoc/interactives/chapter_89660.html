<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian decided to click the first option, which was himself.  If it really did change anything, he knew himself best.<br />
<br />

(More Options)<br />
(Return to Prior Menu)<br />
<br />
All of the entries indicated that they were buttons he could select-- and they also seemed depressingly dismal to him.  He glanced over them again and noticed the &quot;More Options&quot; selection, then noticed the &quot;Awareness&quot; option above it.  He clicked that option and the entry changed to &quot;Yes.&quot;  If &quot;No&quot; was the default, maybe most people missed it, changed themselves, didn&#39;t notice the changes and concluded the thing didn&#39;t work.  That might explain why he&#39;d never heard of it.  Maybe.  If it actually did work.<br />
<br />
Next he clicked &quot;Body-fat&quot; and a slider appeared.  Clicking on the slider he accidentally moved it to &quot;51%&quot; and felt his shirt grow tight, and his belt dig into his waist.  NOT the direction he wanted!<br />
<br />
Trying again, he moved the slider all the way to &quot;0%&quot;.  His belt loosened, and his shirt grew larger, baggier.  Soon his pants were more draped over his legs than being worn-- their waist puddled with his boxers around his boney buttocks.  His shirt also felt draped over his shoulder bones.  He felt light!  He felt like his chair had lost padding.  His thighs didn&#39;t touch.  He had an erection and his dick seemed bigger.<br />
<br />
Holy shit!  It WORKED!<br />
<br />
Getting up so fast his chair fell over, Brian turned to run to the bathroom mirror.  Momentarily he struggled to kick his way free from jeans and underwear which wanted to jump ship.<br />
<br />
A skinny, skeletal face greeted him in the mirror.  Eyes sunken, lips tight, and aging more visible.  Without the fat to pad it, his skin was looser.  His cheeks were also sunken, which may have added to the aging effect.  An interesting look, but...<br />
<br />
He returned to his computer, shaking with excitement (and a suddenly cooler feeling apartment), righted his chair and pulled his boxers up, holding them in place while he sat (bare skin on his chair&#39;s seat seemed kind of gross.)<br />
<br />
He noted that his weight had changed as well-- he now weighted about 94 pounds.  Really light for his height.  He clicked on the weight setting and a slider came up, as well as another option:  Percent:  Muscle/Fat/Other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Other?&quot;  was it asking him if he wanted more weight via cancer or something.  He entered &quot;100&quot; for muscle, then a thought struck him.<br />
<br />
He went back down to &quot;Body-fat&quot; and moved the slider to &quot;3&quot;, then check the &quot;Weight&quot; entry.  &quot;96.82&quot;  His weight had gone up, but the &quot;Muscle&quot; setting hadn&#39;t changed.  Interesting-- the &quot;Percent&quot; selection must be for where the weight change was to be applied.  He changed the weight setting to &quot;145&quot; and felt his legs, chest, arms-- all-- his muscles swell.  It felt good-- and was over all too soon.  He got up once more (he still had to hold his underwear in place-- he wondered what size he now wore) and returned to the mirror.  He still looked older, but now he looked more like an older athlete-- maybe someone who participated in triathlons.  He felt his face, chest, legs, and ripped abdomen.  This was cool beyond words!<br />
<br />
He looked once more at the options, and immediately went for &quot;Age&quot;.  He entered &quot;21&quot;-- then changed his mind and changed it to &quot;19&quot;, then &quot;17&quot;.  Did he want to be younger?<br />
<br />
The program waited a moment, sensing that the user still had a setting selected, then did an electronic version of a shrug, and executed and applied the number which had been entered.<br />
<br />
Brian felt a weird sensation.  His height dropped marginally, his scalp momentarily itched, and he felt an odd sort of suction sensation as his skin tightened up, and became more pliable. <br />
<br />
He hadn&#39;t even hit the &quot;Enter&quot; key!  Maybe more caution should--  aw, hell!  He HAD to go look in the mirror!<br />
<br />
Brian practically sprinted for the bathroom.  An itching sensation swept across his face.  Then the weird feelings ceased.<br />
<br />
The face which greeted him was filled with youth.  The long, graying stubble he&#39;d allowed to grow was nearly absent--  just a bit under his nose and on his chin, and that was pretty short and sparse.  He looked, and felt, more awake and energetic.  He also felt greater excitement at this change than he had for all the ones before.  He felt ready to cum in his boxers...!<br />
<br />
&quot;YEAH!&quot; he exclaimed to no one but his reflection (which mouthed it back to him.)  His voice sounded younger, as well.<br />
<br />
Once more returning to the computer he recklessly made a bunch of changes at once, giving himself thicker, auburn hair with a lot of body, vivid green eyes, excellent health and, opening &quot;More Options&quot; set about making himself into a nationally ranked, high school triathlete with super (male) model good looks.  He also got rid of his mental disorders, and added photographic memory and other mental improvements.<br />
<br />
Then he looked around his apartment.  It was still a junk filled, low rent disaster area.  And his clothes still didn&#39;t fit.  What good were all these changes if no one knew who he was?  He had no contacts, no paperwork to identify himself, nor was he actually attending a high school anywhere.<br />
<br />
Crap.<br />
<br />
Sighing, he decided to exit the program and think things over for a while.<br />
<br />
He &quot;returned to prior menu&quot; and clicked &quot;Save and Exit&quot; and a new option popped up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adjust Reality?&quot;<br />
<br />
He clicked that and a &quot;Yes/No&quot; option appeared.  He chose &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
His senses dimmed and a wave of dizziness washed over him.  The dizziness left and his senses sharpened back to normal, maybe even better than normal.<br />
<br />
His room was different.<br />
<br />
He was in a bedroom.  A high school kid&#39;s bedroom.  With sports trophies on shelves and the top of his dresser.  School books were also on his shelves, and in a bookcase.  The room was surprisingly neat-- the room of a well organized person.  The bed was even made!<br />
<br />
His computer was on a fairly new-looking desk-- and was some sort of notebook, rather than the desktop he&#39;d been using.  A quick check showed that the &quot;Chronovac&quot; icon was still present, and he noted that the emitter was still attached via a USB cable.  <br />
<br />
Standing, he found he was still wearing underwear and a t-shirt.  The underwear, however, were some bright teal jockey shorts, and the t-shirt was from some triathlon (apparently, a FULL triathlon), instead of what he&#39;d been wearing (boxers and plain, navy blue t-shirt.)  On the floor, under the desk were a pair of black jeans, looking unbelievably narrow in the waist.<br />
<br />
Numbly he picked them up and tried them on.  They fit, and were skinny jeans.  He guessed he enjoyed flaunting how trim he was.  He rubbed his stomach and confirmed he had compact, eight pack abs.  His skin was also tanned by the sun.  Pulling up his shirt he noted that he must remove his shirt a lot outdoors, since were no tan lines to be seen.<br />
<br />
He remembered making changes, but he&#39;d been pretty impulsive.  What were all of the changes?  What had been changed when reality adjusted?  He didn&#39;t seem to have any body hair (aside from his pubes!  That was a relief!)-- had he eliminated it or did he regularly shave for his sports?  After all, bicyclists shaved, as did swimmers...<br />
<br />
Then...</p>
