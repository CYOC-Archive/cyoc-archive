<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary Elise narrowed her eyes as she scanned the campus. Despite Kellies warning she was determined to find Morgan LeFay, it was time to avenge her father. As she glanced sideways at her companion she was struck with an odd feeling, it appeared Sasha was growing taller and shorter as they walked. “What are you doing,” she asked.<br />
<br />
Sasha paused as she now looked at the grumpy red head. “What I’m practicing,” she said defensively. “I mean, I’ve never had magic before, kind of want to try it out.”<br />
<br />
“Magic isn’t just for fun,” Mary Elise grumbled. “It’s a very serious responsibility. Ugh why they have to give magic to some..kid.”<br />
<br />
“Who you calling a kid,” Sasha fumed. “We’re practically the same age. I mean your what, a sophomore? Guess what I’m a freshman so knock off the high and mighty crap. Besides, judging by the way Ashley and Claudia looked at you I’m guessing your a bit of a loose cannon.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise flinched as she turned her eyes from Sasha. “Yeah Claudia and I had a bit of an awkward introduction,”she mumbled. “I, um, kind of turned her to stone.”<br />
<br />
“What,” Sasha exclaimed. “These rings can actually do that! Also, what the hell, why?”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise shrugged, hanging her head slightly as she thought back to her meeting. “I don’t know,” she groaned. “But anyways you need to be careful, unlike the ring of age, the ring of transformations power isn’t hidden. Whatever changes you make people will notice.”<br />
<br />
Sasha nodded before giving Mary Elise a sly smirk. As Mary Elise looked at her she felt an odd tingle course through her body, looking herself over she gasped in shock. Mary Elise’s large d cup breasts were slowly deflating. The shocked auburn haired woman watched as they rapidly deflated going from c cup, to b cup, to a cup in almost no time at all. Grasping her now stretched shirt she pulled it forward gaping at the barely their mounds contained within in her now roomy bra.<br />
<br />
“Seriously,” she said angrily.<br />
<br />
Sasha shrugged, giving the girl a warm smile. “Just checking,”she smirked. “Wanted to be sure you were telling the truth.”<br />
<br />
“Of course I’m telling the truth,” Mary Elise said angrily. “Now can I have my tits back, I haven’t been this flat since I was 10.”<br />
<br />
Sasha nodded making her wish. Mary Elise breathed a sigh of relief as she watched her breasts once again swell into maturity. In only seconds she found her breasts to be d cups once again. “Never thought I would be so happy to have these back,” she sighed, hefting her breasts up. <br />
<br />
“You seem a lot different than the Mary I’ve gotten to know,” Sasha stated. “Why is that?”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise paused, while she didn’t like sharing that information with people there was something about Sasha. The girl seemed much different than any of the other girls she had met from this timeline. This girl seemed grittier, tougher, than the others. The other Katie and her friends had all been very level headed, with some outbursts of anger. Sasha though was different, this girl seemed to be quite intriguing to Mary Elise, looking at this girl she could almost see her as a friend.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” she sighed. “The reason I’m different from the Mary you know is because...my father is gone.”<br />
<br />
“He ran out on you?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Mary Elise said sadly. “He died. Car accident after my folks divorced. Turns out it was because of Morgan’s magic.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Sasha said quietly. “I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise nodded as the two continued to walk quietly. After a few moments of deafening silence it was finally Sasha who spoke. “My mom bailed on me when I was 10.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise turned quickly, noticing the sad look on the raven haired girls face. “What? Why?”<br />
<br />
Sasha shrugged as she sadly stared forward. “I really don’t know,” she said sadly. “I know her and my dad were fighting a lot. I think they were planning on getting a divorce too. Then one day I came home from school and see her packing up the car. When ai go to ask her what she’s doing she just, pushed me away.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise stared in total silence as Sasha recounted her sad tale, tears beginning to well in her eyes. “I remember asking mom why she did that,” Sasha sniffed. “She just looked at me like I wasn’t even there. She..she said, she couldn’t be a mom anymore or a wife. She was done, leaving me and dad by ourselves. The last thing I saw was her back out of the driveway and speed down the road. I...I tried to chase her down but she was going to fast. My dad found me a block from my house when he got home from work that night. We never heard from her again.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise paused, looking at the forlorn girl. They had both lost parents in their lives, yet Sasha’s tale was even more tragic than her own. Mary Elise missed her father tremendously, she knew he loved her, which made it hurt that much more. For Sasha though it was worse, her mother was alive, she just chose to abandon her family. “How could a parent not love their child,” she thought. Looking at Sasha she placed a comforting arm around the girl.<br />
<br />
“Sasha,” she said weakly. “I..I can’t even begin to say how sorry I am to hear that.”<br />
<br />
“It’s fine,” Sasha sniffed, wiping her nose. “Her loss, besides made me tougher, stronger, I learned that day not to wear your heart on your sleeve. People just let you down.”<br />
<br />
“Know the feeling,” Mary Elise whispered. “Still, you have your friends and your dad.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah and that’s why we’re doing this,” Sasha said, her voice strengthening. “I’m not going to let some inter dimensional super bitch screw up a friends family. That’s why we’re going to find this guy and kick his ass.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise smiled, hugging the girls shoulders tightly. “You know Sasha,” she smiled. “I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.”</p>
