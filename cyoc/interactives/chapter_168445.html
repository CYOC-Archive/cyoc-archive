<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile,  back at his house,  all of his possesions began disappearing one by one. His inage was being erased from all of his photos,  as the chronivac was erasing his entire profile. Terrabytes of information. Once it is all gone, nothing of Jeff will remain,  save his own mind stuck inside the skull of the donkey he became. Until that happens,  there is still the possibility of Jeff being restored by a different chronivac. <br />
<br />
As it is, he had already disappeared from his home town and reappeared on a random farm,  stuck in the middle of redneck Kansas. Too far away,  and with too little physical ability to communicate with humans. The chronivac was already working on his brain anyway,  adding in purely functional donkey instincts of which his human mind would be unable to control. Jeff was already experiencing that,  with his newfound placid nature; umable to resist this farmer decorating his head with a smelly old used bridle. Once said bridle was in place,  Jeff lost all mental control over what his body would now do on automatic as if he were a donkey. Periodically,  he would find he could still vocalize on purpose anytime he would try and talk. But not when he was forced into grazing or drinking from a dirty old trough that other dity farm animals drank from. And that would be the extent of control he&#39;d have. Other that that,  Jeff would experience everything his body did. Every piss it would take,  every smell, taste every slimy mouthful of grass it would chew,  and even its tail naturally swinging around its large rump trying to dislodge biting insects. There was nothing he could do whenever his ear,  or his nose, or his flank would itch. He certainly would experience donkey-style sex against his horrified will,  which would ironically only fuel his sex drive. He would begin to be referred to as an &quot;it.&quot; Undignified pronounless. <br />
<br />
Currently,  Jeff is being led....somewhere. His will to physically resist gone. Most of his vision ocked by the stupid irritating blinds on his eyes. Only a narrow slit of immediate forward view available to him,  with a large blind spot in the center due to his eyes being offset fron his elongated snout. At least he could still hear and smell really well. He could also &quot;feel&quot; the round barrel-shape of his body he is permantly stuck with. Abd of coyrse,  the humiliating swaying of the tail that would forever be attached to his rear end that he couldnt even be able to ever touch.<br />
<br />
Jeff got a poor view of some sort of wooden structure he was being led to. He could mostly smell it,  what with his vision being so near-sighted,  colorless, and mostly blocked by the infernal blind this damn human farmer put on him that comes with this stupid disgusting old used harness. But he&#39;s just a dumb donkey that must be led by a human. His comfort is no matter to the rest of the world. <br />
<br />
His sharp hearing picked up the sharp &quot;clops&quot; his hooves made as each of his four limbs stepped on the wooden floor of this structure. He could &quot;feel&quot; the difference between the hard surface if the wood plank compared to the softer muddy grassy field. &quot;Eerrgghh hhaaww?&quot;  jeff tried asking. His brays distorted by the bit in his mouth as he temporarily forgot about his new condition of being unable to speak. A condition he&#39;ll never get used to. <br />
<br />
He heard the human pull up a stool. He lifted Jeff&#39;s right front leg with ecouragement. His donkey instinct told his body to comply,  even as his human mind wanted to resist. He wasn&#39;t sure what the farmer was up to. <br />
<br />
What the farmer was doing,  was taking measurements of the bottoms of his hooves. He measured him around his middle as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a pretty fat fella,&quot; he muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrrggh hhhaaww!&quot; Jeff said idignantly. &quot;I&#39;m not fat!&quot; he thought. &quot;Am I? Am I actually FAT!?&quot; Jeff wasnt fat when he was a human boy,  but as a donkey, he is obese. <br />
<br />
The farmer grabbed his snout,  and opened his thick black donkey lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,  you were never taken care of. Those teeth! Ugh!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Whats wrong with my teeth!?&quot; &quot;Eeeerrrrgghh hhhhaaww!?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck! I can&#39;t talk!&quot; &quot;Hhhhaaww!&quot; he huffed in irritation. <br />
<br />
&quot;At leasymt i have the right size shoes fer ya, &quot; the farmer continued speaking to himself. Jeff heard metal on metal as the farmer grabbed four horseshoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no. &quot; shoes&quot;? As in DONKEYSHOES!?&quot; EERRRGGHH HHHAAWW! <br />
<br />
Jeff didnt want to be further degraded by having to have metal horseshoes on his hooves. It was bad enough, the fact that he was already a four-legged animal with his embarrassing rwrs on the top of hus thick skull,  a tail coming out of his rearened,  and a huge black swollen donkey dick and black wobbly donkey balls for the world to see. But he&#39;d now be forced to wear the &quot;shoes&quot; of the work aninal he has become. <br />
<br />
The thoughts made him horny. He was experiencing being a donkey. &quot;Heeee hhaaww, &quot; he brayed again out loud again,  this time on purpose for the benefit of his own ears. To hear how far he has fallen,  and in order to feed his own rising libido. &quot;God,  i wanna jack off! I&#39;m a donkey! I&#39;m stuck as a stupid fucking donkey!&quot; &quot;Eerrrgghh hhhaawww!&quot;<br />
<br />
His penis began swelling. Lost in his own thoughts. Until,  that is,  the farmer began nailing the first shoe onto his right hoof. It didnt hurt,  but Jeff was immediately irritated. Being taken out of his daydream and back to reality. He really WAS  a god damn donkey! And he was fat and gross. He FELT gross. He started pissing against his own will. He was also incontinent. <br />
<br />
The farmer let go of his leg to allow the sour greenish-yellow firehose&#39;s liquid to finish its work. Several large spurts finished it off,  before the farmer could resume his work. He released his front right leg,  which immediately put his hoof directly into the freshly-made pond on the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, come on!&quot; Jeff thought. &quot;I guess i&#39;ll never eat with that limb ever again. Its now just a foot. A hoof, to be more precise.&quot;  He sadly lowered hus head as the man continued with his work.<br />
<br />
The farmer went around to the left,  and lifted Jeff&#39;s front left leg to do the same. Jeff&#39;s donkey body he was stuck inside of, realeased several plops of fresh manure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhhaaawww!&quot; he embarresingly guffawed out. The farmer ignored it. Used to dumb farm animals just defecating wherever. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,  ya filthy animal. We&#39;re finished here.&quot; The farmer led Jeff outside where he mercifully took off the infernal headgear and left Jeff to his own devices in the muddy field. Where his body proceeded to start grazing,  much to his chagrin. <br />
<br />
Jeff didnt want to walk around a muddy old field eating whatever grass he could get his slimy teeth on! He tried braying,  but even that was currently lost to him as his body had other ideas. <br />
<br />
His head would strangely bob down without his command,  tear off tufts if grass,  the bob back up as Jeff boringly stared out of his large,  dull brown eyes while his body chewed and chewed and chewed on the same mouthful of grass. <br />
<br />
Then he would do it again. And again. And again. His body mindlessly consuming  large amounts of grass as Jeff&#39;s mind was held captive, slowly making his way across the field. He would periodically pick up the sound of a fellow farm animal mooing in the same field doing the same thing. There was a herd of cattle that was sharing his field. He could smell and hear them. All animals just mindleslly grazing on the dimishing grass. Including the body Jeff was held captive within. His mind wanting to gag over so much slimy green grass coating his entire mouth. His body taking it all in like a champ.<br />
<br />
Several hours pass by when his body recieved its fill. Finally, his head bobbed down for the final time. He noticed the sun was lower down on the western horizon. The landscape terribly flat,  but his poor eyesight keeping him from seeing much more than a halfmile distance. Even more than ten yards away,  was nothing but black and gray blurry blobs. <br />
<br />
Growing bored, Jeff tried turning his body around to explore his surroundings. But his bulk refused to comply. He just stood there, mindlessly staring and grossly continually chewing his final mouthful of grass that has already been completely pulverized into green mush. Indistinguishable from the occupations of a real farm animal.</p>
