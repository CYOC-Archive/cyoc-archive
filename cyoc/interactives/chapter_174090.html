<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Everyone was still trying to process what had just happened, Nate was not only a merprince but his sister the crowned Princess was now in the room and now everyone knew that Nate was going to propose to Rose. That wasn’t surprising by itself, the two had been dating for just over 3 years having meet winter of their freshmen year of college and started dating the fall of their sophomore year. However now there was unsure if Rose or Nate would help them escape.<br />
<br />
Now that there was a moment, everyone took a closer look Princess Amara, she looked to be maybe 2 at most 3 years younger than Nate which would make her at most 22 years old. Her blonde hair was the same shade as Nate, but much longer and pulled back into a long braid which hung over her shoulder like a classic Princess. Her eyes where a greenish blue and she looked a lot like Nate, another sign in support of them being brother and sister.<br />
<br />
“Madam…” said Rose shaking her hands “I am just the daughter of a dentist who went to school to be a nurse, I don’t know anything about royalty or even merfolk.”<br />
<br />
“Neither did our grandmother on our father side.” reassured crown Princess Amara with a laugh as she paused. “If I remember correctly, she was the daughter of the captain a coaster steamer out of….”<br />
<br />
She was snapping her fingers as she tried to remember.<br />
<br />
“What is that location on United States…the one state that starts with a G.” inquired Princess Amara as she looked around hoping someone would answer her.<br />
<br />
“Georgia.” Offered Taylor as Princess Amara nodded her head. <br />
<br />
“Thanks Georgia.” Said Princess Amara before looking at her brother. “Our grandmother was from the state of Georgia, she can’t wait to meet you either.”<br />
<br />
“I have a grandmother?” inquired Nate, he was still trying to process that he had parents and now a sister, now he had living grandparents.<br />
<br />
“Yes, she and grandfather would be here as well, but they are in poor health and couldn’t make the swim. Understandable when you are in your 140’s. You really look a lot like grandpa and father when they were your age but you have mom&#39;s orange scales.” stated Princess Amara, merpeople had longer lives but still 140 was old. “When you and your friends finish transforming, we will journey to the Summer Palace, they retired there and it will be better place for you to adjust then the Capital and the main Palace. I would not be surprised if Grandma Cresheanem and our cousins in the Kingdom of Cresheanem make their way over to see you in time. You have a rather large family, mom has 7 brothers and sisters after all. Uncle Thaelum is the King of Cresheanem and he will want to see his nephew and godson after all.”<br />
<br />
“Ok…I know…I have an uncle on our father side…what happened.” Inquired Nate as Princess Amara’s smile faded a bit.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me your highness but maybe I can explain better. You never knew your Uncle after all.” Offered Captain Adonis as Princess Amara nodded. <br />
  <br />
“Your Uncle…I will not say his name, may he burn for what he did.” Cursed Captain Adonis with anger in his voice. “He didn’t like the reforms carried out by your father and wanted to reverse the reforms carried out by your grandfather and great grandfather and return the Kingdom to an absolute Monarchy and when you where born there was no way he would get a chance to get the throne. So he hired assassins to kill your father and we thought he had you killed as well. I was guard duty that night and I was part of the team which killed the assassin when they arrived that night but to the great shame of the royal guard you where taken. Your uncle paid with his life once his crimes where proven in court of law and his name stripped from the records. However it was the great shame of the guard that you were taken believed killed.” <br />
<br />
“I see.” Said Nate his mind trying to process everything.<br />
<br />
“Which is why a whole Company of Royal Guards are now spreading out to protect you and your sister.” Stated Captain Adonis as Rose did a quick look at Sam and Mike, the looks on their faces fell. She had no idea how many guards a Company was but it wasn’t a small amount. Her answer came a few seconds later. “That is 160 royal guards making sure you are safe and restoring our honor after our failure to protect you as a child.”<br />
<br />
“Ok.” Said Nate still trying to process.<br />
<br />
“I know you are confused brother and it will take time, but you are home now and safe, Mother and Father should be here or at least the summer palace in three days. Knowing our mother she will be here sooner than that, word is she broke down in tears of joys when she heard you came home..” Said Princess Amara with a smile as she put her hand on her brother’s shoulder. “It will be years before you are asked to do any royal duties besides appearing at parties and the like. Father, mother and I will take care of the royal duties.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t even know how to be a royal, I went to school for…” said Nate before laughing. “Do you even have computers down here? I went to school for that.” <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry brother, you will have time to adjust no one is expecting you to know how to open Parliament, give the royal blessings to the Prime Minster, carry our royal visits or any of the religious ceremonials.” reassured Princess Amara “You are home brother, and you and your friends will be well taken care of.”<br />
<br />
“Your highness your brother likely needs some rest, the transformation takes a lot out of people and he will need time to process the information.” Interjected the doctor as Princess Adonis nodded her head. <br />
<br />
“Alright, get some rest brother and we will have dinner in a few hours alright?” stated Princess Amara<br />
 <br />
“Alright.” Said Nate as Princess Amara pulled him into a hug.<br />
<br />
“I love you brother, welcome home.” Said Amara as she hugged him tight before letting go and heading out the door. The Doctor followed her out as well as Captain Adonis however the doctor kept swimming while Captain took a position on the other side of the door which now had other guards visible in the hallway. The eight guards which had entered remained even as the door closed again.</p>
