<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meet Kelly Anderson, a lawyer living in the UK. She was very successful in both her work and dating life. She was in high demand for her services, considering <br />
she rarely lost a case but her dating life was a different story. Not to say it was unsuccessful, but it was quite unusual. See, she was a very attractive lady <br />
and had no trouble finding men. Gracefully blessed with DD breasts and a lovely figure, she was rarely single. The unusual thing about her dating life was that <br />
her boyfriends were always... perfect. She would go out with them for a couple of days, meet them for another date and suddenly they were exactly what she <br />
wanted them to be. She never figured out why, but she was obviously freaked out by it. Right now, she was dating a neurosurgeon. His name was Stanley Howe.<br />
<br />
Kelly was at home with her sister talking about Stanley. She really did like him, he was sweet and funny but he wasn't the best-looking guy in the world. He <br />
was fairly short, much shorter than Kelly and was a bit chubby. Kelly looked past this, since she knew looks were only skin deep, but that didn't stop her from <br />
being a bit disappointed.<br />
&quot;How's that surgeon your dating?&quot; her friend asked.<br />
&quot;Oh! He's great! I'm going to meet him for a dinner tomorrow!&quot; Kelly answered happily.<br />
&quot;How does he look?!&quot;<br />
&quot;I've got a picture, her I'll show you!&quot; Kelly bought up a picture of Stanley on her iPhone. He was a very handsome man, with a nice face and hair.<br />
&quot;He's a bit short&quot; Her friend said.<br />
&quot;Yeah, I supposed it would be better if he was a bit taller&quot;...<br />
<br />
Stanley was in his living room watching TV. He couldn't wait for his date with Kelly tomorrow, she was beautiful and she really understood him. He was about to <br />
change the channel when he heard his shirt begin to tear. He stood up and saw that almost all his clothes were now stretching out. Standing at a measly 5ft 6 <br />
he had a hard time finding clothes and now he was too big for them? The growth continued until all his shirt and jeans ripped to shreds. He measured himself <br />
against a tape measure and found he was now 6ft 3. In a minute he just grew 9 inches? Stanley couldn't believe it! But that was just the start...<br />
<br />
&quot;How is he in the bedroom department?&quot; Kelly's friend asked cheekily.<br />
&quot;We haven't got there yet, but I took a peek while he was in the bathroom- not good...&quot;<br />
&quot;Small?&quot;<br />
&quot;Too small, needs to be bigger!&quot;<br />
<br />
Stanley was sitting down again after his recent growth when he felt his boxers tighten. He adjusted them to make them more comfortable, and noticed that his <br />
small bulge had increased. He looked down and he noticed his hill was growing. It expanded, hitting 6 inches... 7... 8... 9... 10 inches! It stopped leaving a <br />
rather large mountain in his boxers. Stanley sat there in awe, he was now 6ft 3 and hung? HOW?!<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose he could have some more muscle too, not too much! Like a Hollywood actor or something&quot;<br />
<br />
Stanley transformations weren't over as he heard the leather on his chair squeak. He stood up and looked in the mirror. He saw his shoulders broadening as his <br />
chest heaved out. Two slabs of muscles grew out on his chest and he grew a rock hard six pack. His arms toned and expanded till they were 16 inches around and <br />
his legs thickened and adjusted to years of working out. Stanley was enjoying himself now as he flexed his huge guns. Kelly was going to love him now!<br />
<br />
&quot;He has a high voice, it would be nicer if it were lower I suppose&quot;<br />
<br />
Stanley clutched his throat as his adam's apple broke and grew bigger making his voice deep and baritone.<br />
<br />
THE NEXT NIGHT<br />
<br />
Kelly threw herself on Stanley as she took of her shirt. She pulled off his and stroked his tone muscle. She unbuttoned his trousers and ripped off his boxers. <br />
She stripped and lay on top of him. He thrust his erect dick in her pussy and they fucked the night away. She groaned as he sucked her tits and lips. They went <br />
on for a whole hour, orgasming and moaning the whole time. They finished and just lay there. Kelly still didn't understand his new look, but she loved it. She <br />
turned over and felt his hard arms.</p>
