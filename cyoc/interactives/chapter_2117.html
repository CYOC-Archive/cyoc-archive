<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bobby headed off to the local high school.  If his estimation was correct, another stuck up school bitch he knew would be there.  It was after class hours, but all the extra-curricular good boys and girls would still be there.  Bobby walked inside and made a straight line for the gym.  He knew that Amber would be there.  Amber was yet another of those &quot;Why the hell are you talking to me if you aren't at least 25 years old and don't drive a Jag?&quot;, seniors we all know and love..... to hate.  Amber spent most of her time in the gym toning and maintaining her already taught, toned, tan figure so that her very presence would demand attention to ANY man who would see her.  Five feet, five inches tall with firm, C-cup breasts, smooth, tan skin and long brown hair with sparkling dark brown eyes, she was remarkably beautiful.  She could have been an actress or model with her full lips and rounded soft face with a strong jawline.  Bobby entered the gym and stood anassumingly in the corner watching several girls, half a dozen or so, going about their workout.  One girl was working on her gymnastics routine, while another was on the balance beam.  The rest were running laps around the gym, and that's when he saw her.  Amber was doing presses on the weight bench.  It was just now that Bobby could see just how fit she was.  Wearing a white tank top and skin-tight, mid-thigh spandex shorts, he saw how toned and defined her arms and legs were as she lifted the barbell up and down slowly and steadily.  &quot;Eliza Dushku&quot;...THAT'S who she looked like, thought Bobby.  He had a feeling that behind her soft beauty, she could beat most guys asses down if they got on her bad side.  Bobby had chosen to come here because he knew that besides Amber's obvious personality flaws, her major one was her pride and arrogance.  She saw her strength and beauty as a combination that no man could resist.  And she was right.  
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately for Amber, her strength and beauty would fade and disappear.  Amber knew this and tried very hard, even at her young age of 18 years, to preserve her youth, strength, and beauty.  The healthier and more fit she kept her body, the longer these assets of hers would last.  As confident and tough as she was there was one thing that Amber would never be able to defend against, no matter how much she tried, and deep down she knew this and it was her greatest fear..... to grow old.
<br />

<br />
Poor Amber.
<br />

<br />
Bobby continued to watch her exercise and the ring began to glow.  He would start.... subtley at first.
<br />

<br />
On and on Amber pressed.  For just having started 5 minutes ago she sure felt drained.  Sweat beaded on her forehead.  Her arms convulsed as fatigue caught up with her.  With a loud CLANG the barbell fell out of her hands and onto the bench above her head.  Amber sat up, out of breath.  &quot;Well, that sucked.&quot; she thought, gasping for breath.  Maybe some stretches before I hit the showers.  Amber got up, slower and more awkward than usual.  There were dark circles underneath her eyes and sweat dripping down her face.  She looked tired, worn out.  Amber sat down on the mat, more like plopped down, exhausted.  She spread her legs and groaned with pain.  &quot;God, I'm sore.  So stiff.&quot; she said.  Amber leaned down very slowly, trying to reach her toes.  &quot;Oooooh, my back... Maybe I've had enough for today, so tired.&quot;  As she struggled to stand, Bobby noticed that she looked so worn out.  The thing that most stood out was how much her figure had thinned out.  If seemed as if the last year of toning and shaping her body had drained out of her.  The skin tight lycra shorts she was wearing seems just a little loose.  The other girls surronding Amber stopped what they were doing and looked as well.  One of the girls spoke up, &quot;Amber, are, are you okay?&quot;  
<br />

<br />
&quot;Fine... I'm fine, it's just, I'm so tired....  I just, I gotta stop....&quot;  
<br />

<br />
&quot;You don't look so good, Amber.  Why don't you take a shower and relax&quot;, another girl said.  
<br />

<br />
Two girls helped Amber up to her feet.  She wavered in her walk toward the showers, knees bent, like the energy was being sucked out of her by the second.  Finally she reached the showers and struggled to take her clothes off.  It was then she looked in the mirror to her side as the water cascaded down.  She gasped.  It seemed as if the muscles in her toned arms and legs had shrunk, had withered away to almost nothing.  Her face was worn, small lines tracing down her face.  Her shoulders were more pronounced.  Her bottom lip trembled as her tight, taught skin seemed looser, seemed to sag just a little on her body.  She looked at her hands.  Her fingers seemed bony and more fragile.  Skin all over looked as if twenty years had been added to it.  &quot;What is HAPPENING TO ME!!!&quot; Amber screamed  as more and more lines etched her face, down her neck....  She felt her breasts pull at the skin on her chest.  She quickly put her hands underneath of them as if to stop their slow descent and noticed how unfirm they were becoming, how soft they seemed in her hands.  
<br />

<br />
It all went down hill from there.
<br />

<br />
Looking up from her ever-withering body into the mirror, Amber saw the process accelerate.  Her hair had turned from brown to grey to white in a matter of seconds.  It thinned tremendously and quickly grew down the withering skin of her back as she slowly hunched over and moaned.  She watched as the skin of her face shriveled, as she felt it wrinkle and sag as gravity took effect as it had on her entire body.  What was left of her muscles withered away, leaving nothing but wrinkled, leathery skin over brittle bones.  Amber's breasts sagged lower and lower, the skin of her breasts becoming ever more soft and wrinkled.  She felt them slide down, nipples pointing to her toes, until they hung down and swayed loose and withered as her body trembled.  Her eyes, covered by drooping eyelids, followed her breasts down to her flabby, wrinkled stomach, looked down her bony, frail legs, and then she noticed how much her feet had aged.  Veins seemed pronounced through the skin, the skin of her once cute, slender toes had shrivleled as they became thin and and withered with old age.  The years piled upon Amber's once youthful, slender, toned body.  Amber couldn't believe it.  With no strength left in her withered, aged form, Amber slowly sank to the floor.  She felt a hundred years old.  Her worst nightmare had come true.  She could feel her loosely hanging, leathery skin sag off of fragile bones.  She was too weak to stand, too weak to do anything but lay on the tiled floor while the years piled on.  Through faded eyesight, she saw images, figures.  She realized that the girls outside had heard her scream.  They had watched as she grew old and feeble.  
<br />

<br />
&quot;Don't.....  don't look.&quot;  Amber rasped in an aged voice.  &quot;Don't look ....at....me.  I'm.... getting...older.. and .....older.  When... when will...it..stop...?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Finally, Amber passed out on the wet shower floor, too weak to stay conscious.  
<br />

<br />
And the girls, suffice to say, were horrified.</p>
