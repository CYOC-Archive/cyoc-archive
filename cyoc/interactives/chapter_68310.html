<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gently playing with her larger, more sensitive breasts, Rachel looked over the other chocolates. The selection was amazing, dark and white chocolate breasts, hair, boobs, penises, pussies, balls, lips, hips, butts, nipples and a bunch of others that didn't seem to have anything to do with sex. Even more fascinating was a pair of odd, unmatched chocolates. Unlike all the other chocolates, these dark chocolates had no white counterpart. At first they looked like simple chocolate disks about the size of a nickle, but when she looked closer at them she saw that they had gender symbols on them, one male the other female.<br />
<br />
These made her curious. She doubted that any chocolates would make permanent changes, so she assumed that each of these dark chocolates would cancel the other out. That meant that they represented something that the chocolate maker did not see as something that could be reduced to nothing and had to be changed on a scale. Her first assumption was that they would cause a total sex change. Normally the thought of becoming a guy would have frightened her, but something about what she had already experienced made her curious. What was she missing in her life as a girl? Here was her chance to find out.<br />
<br />
Smiling, she picked up the chocolate with the male gender symbol and popped it into her mouth, bracing herself for the changes she was sure to come.<br />
<br />
Yet as far as she could tell, nothing happened when she swallowed the chocolate. She looked herself over form every angle. Her hair still reached down past her shoulders, her breasts were still a d-cup, her hips were still pleasantly wide and her pussy was still there and still the same as ever.<br />
<br />
Thinking the situation over she decided that perhaps the gender symbol chocolates were like the others. After all, it had taken two dark chocolate breasts to get hers up to a d-cup. Maybe it would take two or more gender symbol chocolates for her to start looking noticeably male.<br />
<br />
With that thought in mind she ate another male gender symbol chocolate and looked herself over again, but as before there was no difference.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's odd,&quot; she said to her self, noticing that her voice hadn't even changed. The chocolate had to do something though, they wouldn't put in one that did nothing when all the others caused changes of one sort or another.<br />
<br />
Safe in the assumption that the female gender symbol chocolate would reverse any changes the male chocolates caused she decided to test it through extremes. In rapid succession she ate ten more male chocolates and looked herself over one last time.<br />
<br />
Still nothing, nothing at all. Rachel sighed as she turned in front of her full length mirror. Her d-cup breasts were still amazingly sexy, that much she knew. Pinching her nipples she smiled as her pussy grew flushed with arousal again. Yeah, her breasts were pretty hot, big breasts in general were hot she decided, but maybe a d-cup was a bit big on her, yet at the same time it certainly was fun to grope and play with them and she could appreciate how good big breasts looked on a girl.<br />
<br />
She started to rub her clit, ready for another masturbation session, then thought better of it. Her boyfriend, Jared, had been after her for a while now, trying to convince her to let their relationship get more consistently physical and now seemed as good a time as any to have sex.<br />
<br />
First things first she decided to bring her breasts back to normal. Later maybe she'd surprise Jared with what the chocolates could do, but until then she wanted to keep them a secret.<br />
<br />
Two white chocolate breasts later and she was back to a b-cup.<br />
<br />
Picking up her cell phone she sat down on her bed and called Jared.<br />
<br />
He picked up on the second ring, &quot;Hey Rachel, what's up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering if you wanted to come over and mess around a bit,&quot; she laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean mess around?&quot; Jared's tone was full of hopeful excitement.<br />
<br />
There was no sense in beating around the bush, &quot;I'm really horny this morning. You think you're up for a good fuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! What's gotten into you?&quot; Jared gasped, &quot;I'll be right over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, see you soon,&quot; Rachel hung up the phone. Jared's surprised response sank in after a few minutes and she realized that she realized that she had been a lot more blunt than normal, but she really was horny.<br />
<br />
While waiting for her boyfriend to arrive she cleaned up from breakfast, then went back to her room to get dressed.<br />
<br />
It was only when she got back to her room that she realized that she hadn't bothered to put her shirt back on and had been walking around the house topless. For some reason the thought didn't bother her too much. It felt sort of natural.<br />
<br />
Shrugging she slipped on a plain t-shirt, not bothering to put a bra on, and then quickly ran a brush through her hair, yanking roughly at the tangles. Having such long hair was pretty frustrating at times and she wondered if she should cut it short for a change. It sure would be a lot easier to take care of that way.<br />
<br />
While waiting for Jared to arrive she looked over the chocolates. This time her eyes fell on the female gender symbol chocolates. Maybe she had missed the effects of the male chocolates because of the way she was looking at the situation. They had made her horny, she was sure of that, but there had to be more to it than that. She doubted that the female chocolates would make her less horny, so she decided that she would conduct a test. When Jared showed up she would give him female chocolates until she figured out what they did.<br />
<br />
Whatever the results, based on what had happened to her, which seemed to be nothing, there was no harm in trying.<br />
<br />
She didn't have to wait long either, as she made up her mind she heard a knock on the door. Eager to begin she put the chocolates in the drawer of her night table and ran to greet Jared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you ready?&quot; she asked before he got the chance to say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're serious?&quot; he said almost at the same time, looking down at her and then smiling, &quot;I guess you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You bet I am,&quot; she took his hand, &quot;Let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Like any eighteen year old boy, there was no way Jared would turn down a chance like the one she was presenting to him, so he went with Rachel to her room.<br />
<br />
As they went she began the lead up to her plan, &quot;Did you know chocolate is an aphrodisiac?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what this is about?&quot; he laughed, &quot;You went on a chocolate binge and need sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but I want to see if it's true. I've got some special chocolates that I want you to try,&quot; Rachel watched his face closely as she said this. Jared seemed puzzled, but willing to go along, which was fine by her.<br />
<br />
In her room the chocolate box was mostly hidden in the drawer she had put them in so Jared wouldn't notice the strange shapes that some  of them were in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; she took out a female gender symbol chocolate and gave it to him, &quot;Eat a few of these and tell me how you feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Jared took the chocolate from her and popped it into his mouth.<br />
<br />
A new chocolate appeared like magic in the slot Rachel had taken the chocolate from and Rachel gave that one to him as well.<br />
<br />
She continued this until she had given him five, after which she looked him over, noticing a slight difference about him. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but something about Jared was different.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how are you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared blinked and smiled, &quot;Pretty good. I think you're right about those chocolates too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Rachel arced an eyebrow, &quot;You want a few more, just to be sure you're good and ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If this is a game you want to play, that's fine by me,&quot; Jared tilted his head slightly and ran a hand over his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to admit, it's a fun game,&quot; Rachel offered him another chocolate, then, as he ate it, she took off her shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not arguing,&quot; Jared laughed, accepting another chocolate from her.<br />
<br />
As Jared ate this chocolate she helped him pull off his shirt. At the sight of his muscular, hairy chest, she frowned slightly. Normally she found his body very attractive but for some reason the sight of all that body hair was a little off putting. She wanted smooth contours to run her hands over, silky smooth skin...<br />
<br />
The thought of breasts sprang unbidden to her mind, big breasts to grope with plump suckable nipples. Now that was hot.<br />
<br />
Then she realized what she was thinking. Had the chocolates made her a lesbian?<br />
<br />
No, she decided, she was still attracted to Jared, and judging by the way he was looking at her, he was still interested in her despite the chocolates she had given him.<br />
<br />
Mulling this over, she gave him another chocolate, watching as he ran a hand over his chest. Rachel couldn't believe it at first, but he was playing with his nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;One last chocolate then,&quot; she smiled wickedly, having decided to give him a bit more to play with and her too.<br />
<br />
As the chocolate melted in his mouth he let out a little gasp as his nipples plumped up as a result of the nipple dark chocolate she had given him. <br />
<br />
It wasn't quite as good as breasts she decided, but she hadn't wanted him to notice and realize what she was doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so weird,&quot; he started to say, but Rachel silenced him with a kiss. As they kissed she brought up one of her hands to roll his nipples between her fingers, feeling them perk up at the touch.<br />
<br />
Rachel continued to play with them after she broke the kiss, &quot;Weird? But you like it, don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She gave his nipples and extra little squeeze, causing him to gasp and squirm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh yeah,&quot; he panted, eyes rolled back with pleasure, &quot;That feels so good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about this?&quot; Rachel leaned in and took one of his nipples in her mouth, flicking her tongue rapidly over it, imagining big, heaving breasts as she did so.<br />
<br />
Jared gasped again, practically squeaking this time, &quot;Stop it! Any more and I'm going to come in my pants!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh,&quot; Rachel let out a muffled snicker, switching to his other nipple and cupping her hand at his crotch, feeling his rock hard cock through the fabric of his jeans.<br />
<br />
Moaning, he thrust against her, hugging her tight against him. The way he was acting was very familiar to her. Rachel knew she acted the same way when he played with her breasts.<br />
<br />
That was when what the chocolates did sank in. The chocolates she had given him had him acting more feminine while the ones she had eaten had her acting more masculine. That was why he was moaning and writhing a girl while she was the one taking initiative and fantasizing about breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Oh! Oh! OOHHH!&quot; Jared's gasps became louder until the melded into a long, drawn out moan as he climaxed and fell back on her bed.<br />
<br />
Rachel fell on top of him, managing to maneuver so that she landed mounting him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I - I just,&quot; Jared panted, his hands unconsciously going to his nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup,&quot; Rachel said, smiling as she unzipped her fly and pulled down her pants and panties. Then she shifted so that she was sitting on his chest, &quot;Now you've got to return the favor. Mind sucking my clit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared nodded, seeming to enjoy the submissive position he was in.<br />
<br />
She lowered her pussy to his mouth and he stuck out his tongue, flicking it over her clit before taking it into his mouth and working it over thoroughly. Licking and sucking he used his mouth to pleasure her. At first he gave her slit an occasional lick too, but before long, encouraged by her soft grunts of pleasure, he began to focus all his attention on her clit.<br />
<br />
Reflexively Rachel began to thrust into his mouth as her pleasure built. <br />
<br />
It went without saying that her pussy was flush with heat and dripping with moisture, but her clit was where the most intense sensations were coming from and it felt so right to be on top of Jared, thrusting and bucking her hips.<br />
<br />
Her orgasm, when it came, was intense. Her whole body seemed to stiffen and with one final thrust she felt an intense rush of pleasure, followed by an equally intense wave of exhaustion. It was, without a doubt, the best orgasm she had ever had.<br />
<br />
Sighing contentedly she slid down to lay next to Jared and wrapped her arms around him. In response he snuggled against her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You enjoy that?&quot; he whispered to her.<br />
<br />
Too drained to speak, Rachel simply nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrapped in each others arms the pair fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Rachel was the first to wake up from the light doze, her clit aching pleasurably from all the stimulation it had received.<br />
<br />
Toying with the idea of reversing what she had done to her sex drive, Rachel leaned over to look at the chocolates. The thing was, she hadn't made any physical changes to herself so no one would notice if she didn't reverse it, and she sort of liked the way she felt now, powerful and confident.<br />
<br />
A rather simple looking chocolate caught her eye, one she had overlooked until now. Suspecting that she knew what it did, she tried it, figuring that it would be a good thing to do if she decided to keep her and Jared's sex drives the way they were now. A rush of warmth centered on her clit proved that her assumption was correct, and when she looked down she saw that her clit had doubled in size so that it was about half an inch long and was visible peaking out of the little hood of flesh that had previously covered it.<br />
<br />
She gave it a gentle stroke with one of her fingers and watched as it flushed pink and began to stiffen slightly.<br />
<br />
Next to her Jared began to stir and she turned her attention away from examining herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ready for another round?&quot; he asked as he sat up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; on a whim she added, &quot;But first how about you have a few more chocolates?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine by me, that was intense,&quot; he fluttered his eyelashes as he spoke, blushing at the memory of what had happened, &quot;I never realized how good it must feel for you when I played with your nipples. I mean I never realized they were so sensitive.&quot;<br />
<br />
He giggled and looked down at his nipples, which had perked up in the cool air of the room, goosebumps rising on the dark circles of his areolas, &quot;Do they uh, look bigger to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Rachel lied, then added honestly, &quot;I wouldn't mind if they were even bigger. It would make them all the better to play with.&quot;<br />
<br />
She licked her lips to punctuate this statement, then offered him a female gender symbol chocolate.<br />
<br />
This time she only made him eat four more and by the time he was done he was giggling helplessly as she had leaned in and gave both of his nipples a good tweak after every chocolate.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want to do now?&quot; he wondered as he stripped his jeans and boxers off, before laying back down on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to be on top?&quot; Rachel offered, hoping that he would say no. Her clit was throbbing in anticipation and she wanted to have him suck it again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; he shrugged, &quot;I think I'd like it more if you were on top when you fucked me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He blushed and his eyes went wide as he said that last part, &quot;I mean when we fuck. I don't know what I was thinking when I said that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought it sounded hot,&quot; Rachel reassured. And she had too, the idea of mounting him and fucking him roughly, making him gasp and moan like a girl was hotter than she had ever imagined anything being, &quot;But how about we sixty-nine. That way you can suck my clit again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's cool,&quot; Jared giggled, &quot;I like sucking you off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glad that things were going to work out, Rachel moved into the proper position and took Jared's cock into her mouth while Jared wrapped his lips around her clit. It's larger size improved the situation in two ways, giving Jared more to work with and providing more sensation as he sucked.<br />
<br />
As had happened before, Rachel found herself thrusting into his mouth, while Jared writhed and moaned around her clit.<br />
<br />
Keeping her attention on the hard, throbbing cock in her mouth was difficult with all the sensation coming from her clit, but Rachel sucked with great enthusiasm, trying to deepthroat him, and when she needed to breath, pulling back to flick her tongue across his cockhead to savor the salty taste of precum.<br />
<br />
This time when they came it was at the same time and the orgasm Rachel experienced was, without a doubt the best she ever had. She pressed her pussy down hard against Jared's face while his cock twitched, sending gobs of cum flowing down her throat. She swallowed every last drop, thinking in the back of her mind that it would be awesome if Jared could ever deepthroat her.<br />
<br />
Sticky and tired with the results of their lovemaking, the pair went to the bathroom to wash up a little.<br />
<br />
As they walked Rachel noted that Jared unconsciously crossed his hands over his chest in a very girly fashion, like he was covering breasts that he didn't even have. Falling back a step she also saw that he was swaying his hips when he walked.</p>
