<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the boys were fighting for the &quot;right&quot; to change Mel, she had a different idea.  While there was a part of her that would enjoy seeing near naked boys fight for her &quot;honor&quot;, she decided to move further into the woods.  The first thing she noticed were the clothes that were scattered everywhere.  It seemed like as soon as a couple entered the woods, they started going at it, stripping their clothes off of each other, if they had any to begin with.  As she moved deeper, she could hear all sorts of sounds.  There were human like moans and groans, and beastial like sounds like growls and howls.  She started to wonder if there were normals that were about to join were society, and she wondered if she was about to join them as well.  She stumbled upon a werewolf couple going at it.  The werewolf boy was plowing into the werewolf girl while she uttered grunts and growls.  The werewolf couple were either too engrossed in the act to notice Mel, or they were aware, but didn&#39;t care.  Mel stared as she watched the boy&#39;s penis pump rhythmically into the girl&#39;s slit, and Mel&#39;s mind started to replace the werewolf girl with her own body.  Mel&#39;s hand absently stroked her breast, and she could feel her erect nipple beneath her dress. Her trance was broken when she heard a male voice behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what you see?&quot; a werefox boy said as Mel turned around to see who was speaking to her.  She quickly recognized him as one of the boys fighting to get the privilege of changing her.  She backed up as far as she could before she hit a tree.  She noticed that he was completely naked except for his fur, and she could see his penis sticking completely out of its sheath.  She stood frozen as he approached her.  There was a part of her that wanted to get away from there, but it was quickly overpowered by both the Love Potion #9 and the sex around her.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; he whispered into her ear as he put an arm behind her, &quot;I won&#39;t do anything that you don&#39;t want.&quot;  He then licked and nipped her ear a little, causing her to gasp.  Any defenses she had at this point started to crumble as she wrapped her arms around the werefox boy.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Harold rushed out of the gym, desperate to find his daughter.  He tried his best to follow his daughter&#39;s scent, but being the inexperienced weretiger that he was, he couldn&#39;t distinguish Mel&#39;s scent from all of the other teenagers that went out that night.  As soon as he left the school, he could see woods all around him, but he couldn&#39;t be sure which ones that Mel went into.  He could smell two groups of teenagers, one heading right and one heading left.  He followed the group going right.  Unfortunately for Harold, that was the wrong group, and he wouldn&#39;t know it until it was too late.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Trevor followed Harold out of the gym, and watched as Harold run out of the building.  Trevor was about to join Harold when he heard a voice call out to him.  Trevor turned around and saw Alice, Jason, Roy, and Megumi.  &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Jason asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Melissa.  She&#39;s gone out with a group to the woods.&quot; As soon as Trevor said that, they all understood what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll help,&quot; Roy said, still in his werewolf police costume.  &quot;I&#39;ve got her scent and I can follow her to wherever she went.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll come with,&quot; Megumi said as she was close behind.  She turned to Alice and said, &quot;Could you take care of the punch bowl? It&#39;s been spiked with something, and I don&#39;t want anyone drinking out of it.  Empty it out and wash it before anyone else is affected.&quot;  Alice nodded her head and went back into the gym to get the punch bowl.  The other four followed Roy as he followed Mel&#39;s scent towards the woods.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
The werefox boy had Mel up against a tree as the two made out as best they could as a werefox and a normal could.  He used his long tongue to trace a path down from her ear down to her neck where he kissed and nipped at it, being careful not to break the skin.  Mel moaned softly as these new feelings coursed through her body.  Trevor was the only boy she went this far with, and she knew she wanted to go further.  Her hands went to his chest, and she could feel the fur and the well-defined muscles underneath.  Her hands travelled down his chest, past his stomach, and towards his were-fox penis.  She could feel the shape of it, and even felt the knot that was at its base.  She rubbed his penis a little, and this caused him to move his hands towards the back of her dressed.  He used his paws to unfasten her dress, and move the zipper on the back down, revealing Mel&#39;s alabaster skin.  She paused her rubbing briefly to help him move the dress off of her shoulders, and reveal her bare shoulders.  She put her arms around him as he slowly pushed the dress down, revealing more of her body. <br />
<br />
Soon, the dress was off of her breasts, and her nipples stood out in the cool October air.  Although small by were standards, he smiled at them and said, &quot;They&#39;re beautiful,&quot; before going down on them.  She smiled at him as she watched him move his muzzle down to her chest.  Being a werefox, he knew exactly how to pleasure her, and used his tongue over her nipples to cause her react with erotic moans.<br />
<br />
There were a few thoughts that went through her mind as he ministered to her breasts.  Didn&#39;t she want to be a werecow?  Wasn&#39;t she saving herself for Trevor?  What about safety?  Was she ready to be a mother?  All those thoughts were soon overwhelmed by the spiked punch and the feelings from her body.  She wrapped her legs around his waist, trying to get him to enter her, but there were a couple of barriers in the way.  Barriers that were quickly falling.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Trevor, Megumi, and Jason all followed Roy to the woods where Mel was.  They came across a group of four boys all fighting each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Trevor shouted, but the boys ignored him.  &quot;HEY!&quot; Trevor shouted a second time even louder, and he stomped his foot on the ground, causing it to rumble a bit.  That got their attention as they all looked at Trevor and his group.  &quot;Where&#39;s Melissa Jenkins?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; The werelion asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Melissa Jenkins.  Moved her recently?  Has red hair?&quot; Jason asked, providing some backup behind Trevor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, her,&quot; the weredog said.  &quot;Yeah, she joined us.  Didn&#39;t have a partner when she came with us, and she was here.&quot;  The weredog looked around briefly and then said, &quot;I guess she left while we were fighting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megumi looked around the place to find any clues where she went.  She could see clothes thrown around the edge of the forest, but she couldn&#39;t find Melissa&#39;s costume.  At the very least, Megumi thought to herself, she&#39;s still dressed, right?  Her thoughts were interrupted as her blood chilled.  She could hear Mel&#39;s moaning in the forest, and Megumi knew she had to act fast.  &quot;Oh no...&quot; she whispered to herself as she turned around.  &quot;Trevor!&quot; she yelled out.  &quot;Follow me!&quot; Megumi then bound into the forest.  Trevor made a charge following her with the group of boys scrambling to get out of the way.  One thing that most weres know is never get in the way of a charging bull.  Roy and Jason followed closely behind.  Megumi was afraid of what was happening, and she hoped that they weren&#39;t too late.</p>
