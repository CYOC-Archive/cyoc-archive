<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Am I the first person to use the &quot;Shower&quot; tag for a story about actually TFing into a shower? I looked and couldn&#39;t find any others.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You&#39;re not seriously worried about that Fusion Wave thing, are you?&quot;, Katie teased. &quot;Everybody I know back home says they were totally unaffected.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jordan was sitting in front of the TV in her dorm room, the news broadcast warning its viewers that the Wave was only minutes away from passing through their area. &quot;Everybody please take whatever precautions you can,&quot; the reporter was saying at the low volume they&#39;d set the TV to, &quot;because nobody knows how to undo these changes once they&#39;ve happened.&quot; She and Katie had just moved in here and were starting to get to know each other as roommates. They didn&#39;t have much furniture yet, so for now the two of them were just sitting in the old wooden chairs that their college had provided with the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Jordan giggled. &quot;I know most people have turned out fine so far. I&#39;m just saying, if anything <i>does</i> happen, I don&#39;t really want to be sitting right next to you at the moment of impact. No offense, but I don&#39;t think we know each other well enough for that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you going to do?&quot;, Katie asked. &quot;It&#39;s not like you have time to go run out into the middle of nowhere, and probably get fused with a cockroach or something. Wait, let me guess - you&#39;re gonna go see your <i>boyfriend</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like him like <i>that</i>,&quot; Jordan scoffed. &quot;I&#39;m just gonna go take a shower and wait for this all to blow over. If I&#39;m the only person in the room, I should be pretty much safe from anything happening, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, don&#39;t take too long in there,&quot; Katie replied as Jordan gathered her stuff and made for the door. &quot;I want to take one this afternoon, too, and you better not use up the whole building&#39;s hot water. <i>Again.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Jordan laughed a little to herself as she went out into the hallway and walked into the building&#39;s shared bathroom. So what if she enjoyed taking nice long showers? It&#39;s not like she was going to let it take over her life. Thirty minutes, tops, and she&#39;d be out of there, squeaky clean, and smelling good. Admittedly, it was pretty awkward bathing in there, considering that there was always a risk of someone walking in on you. Especially considering that it was a mixed-gender bathroom - she wondered who in the campus administration thought <i>that</i> was a good idea. But she&#39;d gotten used to it by now, and it wasn&#39;t like there was anywhere else for her to go for a shower right now.<br />
<br />
None of the shower stalls were being used, so Jordan just took the one closest to the bathroom&#39;s entrance, as she figured most people probably did. Pulling the curtain closed behind her, she stripped naked and took a moment to look over her whole natural body before she turned the faucet on. She&#39;d been watching her figure a little more now that she had a boyfriend to please. She was no narcissist, but she could definitely appreciate the firmness of her breasts and the tight curves below. Hopefully they would stay that way for a long time.<br />
<br />
She turned the knob labeled &quot;H&quot;, and the water started gushing out of the lower faucet, nice and hot. There was plenty of hot water, thankfully. When she&#39;d fiddled with the temperature until it was just right, she pressed the button and switched the water to start coming out of the showerhead up above. The feeling of the stream rushing down along the curves she&#39;d just been examining was something Jordan always looked forward to. As she rubbed the shampoo into her long blonde hair, she closed her eyes and let the water flow all over her lower body.<br />
<br />
Then, when she was ready to rinse the soap out, she pressed her back against the wall, enjoying the contrast between the cold of the tiles and the heat of the water. The showerhead sat just above her own head, while the hot and cold knobs stuck out on either side of her chest. Below that, she could feel a little bit of extra water dribbling on her feet from the faucet, which sat not far below her vagina.<br />
<br />
It was at that very moment that Jordan noticed a hot burst of air that blew into the stall. Through her tightly-shut eyes, she could see a faint red glow. The Fusion Wave had arrived. She had no fear as it passed through the room and moved on to the rest of the world. She was confident nothing would happen. Who would she even get fused with in here?<br />
<br />
But when she opened her eyes...<br />
<br />
She saw the shower stall from a higher angle, for some reason. And everything felt different. The sound of the water rushing down hadn&#39;t changed at all, but she could no longer feel it bathing her all over. Instead, she felt a churning motion passing through her body, the warm water rushing upward to escape through her wide-open mouth. She tried to look down at herself, and when her head turned toward the floor, the stream of water was pushed back against the wall. And suddenly the outside of her body was getting covered in water again, her breasts feeling unusually sensitive as the splash hit them.<br />
<br />
She saw her body pressed against the wall - no, it was <i>part</i> of the wall now. The tiles, which had been a completely flat surface for her to lean against, now curved outward to form an impression of the shape of her body from the neck down. Sticking out of the two mounds that should have been her breasts, the hot and cold knobs had replaced her nipples. Behind it, she could feel the water going through the plumbing, which had replaced her internal organs. And the lower faucet had taken the role of her vagina, which was dribbling out the small amount of water that didn&#39;t make it up to her head.<br />
<br />
The showerhead, of course, had merged with her human head. It was also the only part of herself that Jordan could freely move, since she no longer had any sort of arms or legs and her torso was just a weirdly-shaped wall. Her mouth was now a collection of little jets of water, and with no jaw muscles to speak of, she couldn&#39;t close it to stop the constant flow. Her eyes had been reduced to small beady orbs that sat just above the flowing mouth, the only hint - aside from the very feminine-looking wall it stuck out of - that there was anything out of the ordinary about this particular showerhead.<br />
<br />
Jordan flexed her long, thin metal neck up and down frantically, the only thing she really could do at this point. She tried to call out for help, but any sound she could make was totally muffled by the water that filled her mouth. She struggled for a few minutes, but it was hopeless - her body was firmly fused with her surroundings. And nobody knew how to undo it, she remembered that much. The only way she was getting out of here was with power tools to cut her out from the rest of the wall, a thought that made her mentally grimace at how much it might hurt.<br />
<br />
Then, before she could dwell on her fate any longer, she heard movement outside the stall. Somebody coming into the bathroom? Could she get their attention? Did she even <i>want</i> anyone to see what had happened to her? And more importantly... who was it?</p>
