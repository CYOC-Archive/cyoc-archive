<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A group of college students waljed into the store, the two guys, Scott and Joe and their girlfriends, Erika and Alora respectively, walked into the shop looking to kill some time before their movie was ready. Erika was the one who wanted to look in here and Scott of course humored her, which meant that Joe and Alora had to follow since the other 2 had their tickets. <br />
<br />
The pairs split up into their respective couples to look around. Surprisingly though, both groups managed to find the same exact item at the same time. The Sluttyball. While reading the description, they soon realized that these sluttyballs worked in a similar way to those in a popular japaneese game with fighting monsters and competituve battles. Except apparently they used real people and made them sorta turn into the monsters, to an extent. The wording was pretty vague about that part, but it seemed cool, so each of them grabbed a package of 6 sluttyballs, paid for them, and left the shop.<br />
<br />
They still had time to kill so they went to a nearby park to try out their purchase. They didnt really know what to do though. That was until Alora took one of her sluttyballs and tossed it against Joe&#39;s back playfully saying &quot;Boyfriend, I choose you!&quot; However suddenly Joe disappeared into the ball, to everyone&#39;s surprise. Alora ran over and picked up the Sluttyball, which had turned black with a decorative white lace pattern. She then tossed it again and Joe reappeared. However, his clothes have all changed into a sexy french maid&#39;s uniform, complete with feather duster and 7 inch platform heels. The chest was meant for a woman with fairly large breasts, so the gap between the cups and his bare chest was quite significant too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pfft Haha! Dude nice lace and tights! Oh my god this is fucking hilarious!&quot; Laughed Scott who immediately began taking puctures with his phone. Erika and Alora also were struggling to contain their laughter, although Alora was a bit more sympathetic given that ahe caused this. However it didn&#39;t stop her from also sneaking a few pictures for her own collection. <br />
<br />
Scott got an idea and copied Alora, threw one of his sluttyballs which hit Erika in her right tit causing her to become pissed at him. &quot;Ow you shitsack. Why did you throw it so hard?&quot; She shouted before she too was absorbed into the orb. &quot;Well Scott, you were a great friend, and I will miss our time together. To die at such a young age is such a tragety.&quot; Mocked Joe as the sudden realization of what he just did washed over Scott. <br />
<br />
The sluttyball containing his pissed off girlfriend had returned to his hand, and now was a pink and white pattern with a red plus sign on it. Scott held the Sluttyball in his trembling hands trying to convince himself that letting her out was the right thing and that she wouldn&#39;t kill him. &quot;The longer she is in there, the worse off you will be&quot; shouted Alora, whom, while she had a concerned look on her face, had taken quite some distance, along with Joe, away from Scott. <br />
<br />
Nervously he tossed her Sluttyball causing Erika to reappear, only now in a sexy nurse minidress which bairly covered her ass, and covered almost none of her C-cup breasts, making them look like they could pop out of the dress at any moment or with the slightest of movements. She also had on a pair of 7&quot; platform heels, only hers were a bright pink color instead of the glossy black Joe was wearing. She had a stethoscope hung around her neck and was carrying a tongue depressor in her right hand. After giving herself a once over, she turned to look at Scott and yelled &quot;You are so lucky I became a nurse. It means I can heal you up after I am through with you. Now fix me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, as much as I know you enjoy the sexy maid look, I don&#39;t think I can pull it off quite as well as other guys, so if you could return my clothes as well, Alora&quot; sarcastically asked Joe too. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been trying. But you won&#39;t go back into the sluttyball. It keeps telling me that I can&#39;t run from a battle.&quot; Replied Alora.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, sorry Joe but I can&#39;t stay dressed like this.&quot; Said Erika who was about to punch Joe in the stomach, however something stopped her fist and a notice popped up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sluttymon cannot cause harm to other opponent&#39;s sluttymon, without permission. Victory is determined by whichever side&#39;s trainer does not cum first. Location of battle is fixed to a 50m radius centered directly underneath this notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well shit.... Alright Alora, if you could please cum quietly, I promise I at least won&#39;t disappoint you. But I seriously doubt those 2 could get each other off even in a million years, even if Joe is dressed like that. Actually, I think that kind of just makes it worse. No offense Joe. I am sure that you would make for a very sexy maid if only you had the face, tits, legs, waist arms, and ass for it. And sorry, but I will be sampling Alora for a moment.&quot; Erika said appologeticly. &quot;No, if that is what is required to end this. I am just glad it is you doing it over this guy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute! Don&#39;t I get a say? Joe, get Scott off somehow.&quot; Alora ordered. Joe suddenly found his body compelled to follow her command and started walking over towards Scott in a overly sexual manner, which looked ridiculous. Both Scott and Alora found that they couldn&#39;t really move much either, as Alora couldn&#39;t stop Erika from attempting to get her to cum first. <br />
<br />
While Erika was in the middle of foreplay wirh Alora, Joe for better or worse, found that he couldn&#39;t even touch Scott, with a message showing that his typing couldn&#39;t effect Scott. So his body just took the standard maid pose behind him, as if he was waiting for his new set of orders. Both of them just continued to watched their girlfriends get it on, while being thankful that this area of the park was heavily secluded and rarely, if ever visited by anyone besides them.</p>
