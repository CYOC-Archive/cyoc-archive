<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John couldn't believe his ears. &quot;Daycare?&quot; he cried.  &quot;I thought you said we'd leave here at the end of the month.  You didn't tell me you'd even looked for a job.&quot;  His face reddened as she ignored his protests.  &quot;YOU'RE NOT MY MOMMY!&quot; he yelled and stomped his feet.  Carrie just chuckled at his infantile protests.  &quot;We'll see little one&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
The next morning John awoke to the now familiar feeling of having his diaper...yes a very wet cloth diaper...removed.  &quot;Now mommy's little boy is going to have such a big day today&quot; Carrie gleefully announced.  &quot;Your very first day at daycare.&quot;<br />
<br />
John started to protest but found his words were muffled by the huge pacifier (huge to him) that Carrie had inserted into his mouth.  Her huge hands quickly rediapered him and dressed him in a blue onesie she'd purchased from Giantess Baby World which had him looking every bit like a 6 month old baby.<br />
<br />
Of course John was still very much an adult, but the potion that turned his wife to this giantess had left him the size of a baby.  And here in Giantworld he had little power to escape his fate.  But he had no real idea that his fate would take another turn backward when they walked through the door of Babyworld Daycare Center.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why hello there&quot; greeted the lovely giantess who managed the center.  &quot;So glad you finally brought little Johnny to us.  We'll take extra good care of him while you're at work.&quot;  Carrie was so pleased to be greated this way.  She smiled back at the manager and said &quot;Oh thank you Ms. Simon, you have no idea how much this helps.  And you will be able to take care of that 'little problem' I mentioned?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;No problem at all Carrie, we'll make sure lil Johnny feels 'right at home' here&quot; Ms. Simon said with a wink.  Carrie handed Johnny over with all the ease of a normal size mommy handing her baby to another.<br />
<br />
As Carrie turned to leave, John tried to plead with her, only to have Ms. Simon hold the pacifier firmly in his mouth.  &quot;Looks like this little one must be a little fussy, I have just the thing for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sat Johnny down in one of the many cribs along the far wall of the daycare center.  He stood up at along the crib rails noticing all the giant babies and toddlers in the room.  Some in cribs or playpens, some on the floor playing with baby toys.  Tears started running down his cheeks as his considered his life.  It seemed like only yesterday that he and his wife, now mommy, had arrived at this odd place for vacation.  If he'd only stopped his wife from taking that giantess potion.<br />
<br />
His thoughts were interupted by Ms. Simon pulling the pacifier out of his mouth and replacing it with a baby bottle full of milk...or what John thought was milk.  It had an odd taste, but it did seem to settle him down a bit.  It was actually tasting better with each drop that hit his tongue.  If he had only had a chance to read the label of the container from which Ms. Simon had filled the bottle.  He would have seen the words &quot;Instant Regression&quot; formula.<br />
<br />
Within moments of the formula entering his system his thoughts get a little fuzzy.  Suddenly he stops and realizes where his thought have gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, what was I thinking of. I've got to get back to that. Oh yeah, being a man my age treated this way.  Lets see...I'm how old? I'm--. I'm--. Damn it. I can't think of my age. It's a number. It's a big number. Not just a little number. More than ten. What's a number more than ten? I can't think of any&quot;.<br />
<br />
John tries hard to think of a 'big' number. As he struggles, a sense of panic set in.  &quot;Oh, please! I just can't forget numbers. I've got to remember things.  GONE! That's it. &quot;Something is gone&quot;, he thinks. &quot;What is gone? I can't even remember what is gone, but something is gone&quot;.<br />
<br />
In vain, he starts thinking of things, trying to hold on to them as they quickly slip away.  &quot;Whatth hawpenin too meeth&quot; he says outloud only to be startled by his babyish sounding voice.  He struggles to understand what could possibly be happening, not realizing that as his mind regresses back through the years his small body has become softer, smoother and more babylike.<br />
<br />
He didn't even realize that all of his body hair had retracted and the hair on his head and thinned and softened and turned the soft blonde of his early childhood.  His cheeks got puffy and his fingers and toes became pudgy and his sixpack abs were now nothing more than babyfat.  Even his mansize penis, while small to any giantess, now shrunk to infantile proportions.<br />
<br />
As he continued to suckle the bottle instinctively, his teeth retracted and he now looked every bit like the 6 month old baby a giantess would call her own.  <br />
<br />
The change was nearly complete when John dropped the bottle from his mouth because he could no longer hold it on his own.  Suddenly he is aware of a new feeling. He is scared. He would like to be out of the crib. He wants to let the big woman know. But just how to let her know now seems like a strange mystery. He can make noise to her. But how? There are no words. Just his needs. He first makes some gurgling noise, then he starts to cry, louder and louder.<br />
<br />
Ms. Simon returns to the side of the crib to see her handiwork and simply says &quot;there there little Johnnie, its all ok.  Now your mommy has the little baby she's always wanted.&quot;  Sadly John could no longer understand a single word she said.</p>
