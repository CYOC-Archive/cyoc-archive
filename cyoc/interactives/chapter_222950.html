<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><i>Well, I may not have wanted this weird shift in my clothes, but they function. And I&#39;m not about to waste time, coming to the gym but then going home just over some clothes. After all, I&#39;m not gonna say no to trying out these new muscles and this body in general.</i><br />
<br />
Such were Ben&#39;s thoughts as he crossed his arms in front of his chest. Maybe this was some kind of hint toward what kind of guy Katie preferred, Ben thought to themselves. They knew that she was at least somewhat keen on waiting, or perhaps looking for a kind of guy who wasn&#39;t exactly common. But the hair? These clothes? What kind of guy did this point to...? Honestly, Ben didn&#39;t know - and they did feel at least a little curious about the end result in the week&#39;s time since the change had started.<br />
<br />
Though the name that the guy in the mirror called him seemed a little...odd. After all, his name was Ben. And it had always been Ben...right? He&#39;d said that name when addressing him as if it was the way Ben had always been addressed. A sense of the conviction of someone used to something - kind of. Like with a lot of what went on with that guy, Ben could kind of pick up on him putting on airs.<br />
<br />
Shrugging their shoulders, Ben proceeded out of the locker room, smiling and figuring he could get some relief from the complication of what went on by getting in a good workout. Usually, Ben would go right to the compound movements and maybe some of the machines, aiming to get as much done as he could with those exercises. But today, they were feeling a lot more like getting in some cardio before the main weightlifting part of the workout.<br />
<br />
Shrugging his shoulders, Ben figured he could do with a better warm up beforehand. After all, he&#39;d heard that doing a good amount of cardio before could get everything nice and stretched out. But as Ben walked over toward the treadmill and pulled out his phone along with earphones, he didn&#39;t see the remaining body hair on them trim up more, growing more sparse. Fingernails and toenails are slightly longer and more manicured looking. <br />
<br />
As they step on to the treadmill, their glutes and hips grow a bit. Filling out the shorts better. Ben finds himself looking at his reflection as he starts the machine up. As much of a surprise as it was, he did admit his hair did look pretty good. The silky look and texture just looked...better. He&#39;d never really felt pride in how good his hair looked before. He&#39;d always figured that was a thing the girls felt...<br />
<br />
But now, they were feeling a distinct sense of being impressed by how it looked.<br />
<br />
He started the treadmill, set it to a pretty reasonable speed and incline for his usual fitness - but then found himself upping the speed and incline, grinning as he felt a greater sense of cardiovascular health than usual. He could do SO much better than that!<br />
<br />
Yet as he ran amidst the numerous others on the treadmill, Ben started to feel something across his body. His smoother, more hairless skin interacted with the unisex gym clothes he now ran in, and as they rubbed against him, Ben suppressed a pleased little moan. Even as he kept running, the unwitting enby could feel the cavalcade of sensations - including the rubbing against their bum and legs - causing a pleasant buzz to run through their body...<br />
<br />
It did not take long for Ben in this new and unfamiliar state to feel a hard on coming on. He was still a bit chubbed up from seeing that guy in the mirror, for some reason, so it didn&#39;t take long for Ben to get to a full erection even as he ran. Adjusting their stance, Ben bit his lower lip and tried to focus on some other things. <i>Really? Right when the cardio&#39;s getting really good? Man, my body feels good today though. I can---I can probably jerk off as soon as I&#39;m done. Take the edge off in a stall before doing my free weights and compounds. C&#39;mon...</i><br />
<br />
He tried to think of something less sexy than how good these clothes felt on him. <br />
<br />
Their gaze drifted to the other people currently running on the treadmills...<br />
<br />
<i>Chase Quinn the football player. Well, might be former football player. Apparently he loves the working out more than the football, and his coach has been on his ass about getting too big.</i><br />
<br />
<i>He&#39;s got that wild, long haired beach bodybuilder look. Smooth face, long black hair, crazy ripped body. Bright blue eyes... Man Chase is hot. How&#39;d I never notice---? Oh, right, because I&#39;m---I&#39;m straight...</i><br />
<br />
A blush settled on to Ben&#39;s face as he thought about Chase, watching that disorderly, somewhat ratty long black hair swaying back and forth as the guy ran. Watching the sweat cling to Chase&#39;s broad, powerfully built shoulders and back---Ben very quickly turned to look elsewhere as he realized this was not helping his arousal situation. He wasn&#39;t even gay, and here he was basically ogling Chase Quinn from the back on the treadmill. It was like their libido was just outta control!<br />
<br />
His gaze settled on to the athletic Cynthia Schmitt, currently sprinting after starting at a slower speed. She was an athletic and muscular, well endowed young woman wearing a sports bra and short shorts that concealed absolutely nothing. Her red hair tied back behind her head...<br />
<br />
<i>Well I know I&#39;m not gay. Hot damn is Cynthia looking great today. Much as this doesn&#39;t help with how horny I am...I just can&#39;t help it. She just looks sooo good today.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Talk about booty goals. I&#39;d love to have glutes like Cynthia here. The way they fill out her shorts like that, that soft curve from her waist into the hips and rear...ohh man no way can I stop at this rate. And that sports bra looks so good on her, too. No wonder she&#39;s so popular - everything just looks great on her. ...Wonder how I&#39;d look in a sports bra?</i><br />
<br />
By the time the treadmill slowed and eventually stopped, Ben was sweating and red in the face for more than one reason. He swore it felt like, with his cock swaying around in his shorts, like he was hard as a diamond at this rate. <i>Keep it in, Benji,</i> they told themselves. <i>Gotta keep myself from blowing all over the floor out here, before I even get to do my free weights and compounds. Fuck that&#39;d be embarrassing. Why am I so turned on today? And so easily?</i><br />
<br />
They walked on into the locker room, biting their lip as the college student passed the mirror. He knew that if he was to look at himself at this rate he would be unable to help himself but to indulge as frivolously and openly as possible, damn the consequences of someone walking in and seeing them jerking themselves off. But Ben could feel himself edging closer to just exploding in his shorts. His cock was just quivering, sweat dripping down his brow...<br />
<br />
Proceeding down toward the line of stalls, Ben lightly pushed on each, one after the other, a heavy blush on his face as he glanced upward to try - and largely fail - to concentrate on anything other than their rock hard cock. &quot;Mm...&quot; He moaned somewhat softly under his breath. Each one, after the other, was occupied...<br />
<br />
Until the fifth and final one. The larger of the five, usually used by people who needed the space. When the door swung open at the slight prodding from Ben, he hurried inside. The door swinging shut not long after he got in there. A quick lock on the door and Ben shed his shorts, manhood sticking up, dribbling pre-cum. They noticed that their cock looked even bigger with the lack of pubic hair around it - and Ben made a mental note to start shaving up more...right before he went ahead and grabbed his cock.<br />
<br />
He got through about three rubs with his bare hands, registering how soft his hands were now - right before the college student experienced an orgasm that outright sent him to his knees. They gasped and moaned under their breath, not eager to be discovered doing this. The orgasm sent hot ropes of cum flying against the toilet and the floor, then another few globs somewhat further, and a little more at the foot of where Ben knelt.<br />
<br />
They stood back up slowly, a wry grin settling over their face. He wiped his hair back and sighed, &quot;That---that was something else. Man if sex with Katie is gonna involve cumming like that, fuck, I look forward to it.&quot; Honestly it felt somewhat like the orgasm hit him across his body! Easily the best thing he&#39;d ever experienced. Enough that Ben looked forward to jerking off again as soon as they got back home.<br />
<br />
Wiping off his penis with some paper towel and getting dressed again, Ben went back outside to finish up his workout - new pep in his step and a sense of eager anticipation for the date with Katie. He hoped she was gonna enjoy this new him. <i>After all</i>, they thought to themselves, <i>I work so hard on my look. Right?</i><br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
By the time Ben got done with their workout - taking a quick little shower after, they headed out - sweaty and satisfied with the results. The pump looked amazing on him, and he knew it. These clothes which he had once felt divided on and rather dubious of now were showing his results incredibly well. If anything he was no longer complaining about that guy in the mirror changing up his clothes like that. These were just objectively really, really comfortable clothes - and they showed off Ben&#39;s form just the right way. <br />
<br />
The water from the shower at the gym still left Ben with a shine to his hair, one that accentuated the new manner of good looks that Ben now possessed. Honestly, this weird unisex chic look really suited him. He couldn&#39;t believe he had doubted whether it would look good on him. After all, that guy in the mirror had said he was gonna make Ben into the kind of person Katie liked...right? So of course the new style would look good. Ahh, Katie would probably love it---<br />
<br />
Ben&#39;s route home however was interrupted by a sudden bit of curiosity on their part.<br />
<br />
As they passed by the front of a nearby clothing store, Ben saw a large number of new outfits on sale, some men&#39;s outfits but largely women&#39;s clothing. And strangely for his part, Ben found himself evaluating not only the men&#39;s clothing but also the women&#39;s. As if he might wear something that was being put on display there. &quot;I---I mean, the sports bras there look pretty nice, but---&quot;<br />
<br />
They just couldn&#39;t really get the idea out of their head!<br />
<br />
Ben paced in place for a moment, contemplating. He couldn&#39;t very well let anyone from college know if he did go for this. He wasn&#39;t usually the type to dress in women&#39;s clothing... but at the same time he couldn&#39;t stop himself from thinking. Some of those clothes just looked so bold and so...so fierce...</p>
