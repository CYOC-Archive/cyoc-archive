<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...very quickly walked away from my line of sight.  I walked in the same general direction she did, but I lost her in the crowd of people.  I couldn't spot her again because I wasn't really sure of what she wore.  I had been so preoccupied with the realization of the ring's power that I never bothered to take notice of her dress or even her characteristics and appearance.  How would I ever make this up to her again?<br />
<br />
Of course, I thought.  The ring could help me.  I wished that I knew the name and address of the woman whose clothes just disappeared and reappeared.  I didn't say the wish aloud this time, in the hopes that the ring would know that I made the wish.<br />
<br />
It worked as I immediately knew that the woman's name was Melanie Brown and that she lived at 17A Turner Avenue.  That was only a few blocks away from where I stood.  I could go straight to her.  I stopped and thought for a moment.  Perhaps that might not be the best idea.  It would certainly raise a lot of questions.  The hell with it, I decided.  It was the only way I could do this and know that I had made amends, at least in my own mind.  I wished again that I knew when she would be back at her home.  I immediately had the answer that she was going there now.<br />
<br />
I followed what I guessed was the woman's own path to her home.  It took me about ten minutes to get there.  I found that she lived in half of a duplex.  This was better than an apartment complex, which I had originally guessed her home would be.  Whatever might happen would hopefully not attract as much attention as might in an apartment.<br />
<br />
I swallowed hard and walked up to the front door.  I did not see a doorbell so I knocked on the door.  A few seconds later the door swung open and the woman appeared.  She appeared to be about the same age as me, in her late twenties.  She had shoulder-length brown hair and brown eyes.  I didn't have a chance to look at the rest of her before she said, &quot;Yes, who are you?&quot;  Her voice seemed to tremble somewhat, as if she was still emotionally overwhelmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; I said.  &quot;I need to speak with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She raised her eyebrows at me.  &quot;About what?&quot; she asked.  &quot;I don't even know you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; I said.  &quot;I, uh...well, I'm not really sure how to say this, but I, um...saw what happened on the street.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes went wide and she looked as if she was going to burst into tears.  She stood aside from the door to open a path for me to enter.  &quot;Come in, come in,&quot; she said as her voice cracked.<br />
<br />
I walked inside only a few feet and turned to face her.  She took a step outside the door and appeared to glance around to make sure no one else was within earshot.  She moved back inside and firmly closed the door behind her.  &quot;What did you see?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, um, saw your clothes disappear and then reappear,&quot; I answered.  &quot;I caused that to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but how could you have done that?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're probably not going to believe this, but I can prove it,&quot; I said.  I held up my hand so that she could see the ring.  &quot;This ring grants wishes.  It was given to me by an old woman who told me what it could do.  I didn't believe her and so I wished for your clothes to disappear, because you were the first person I saw across the street from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She walked slowly to her couch and sat down.  She buried her face in her hands and I could hear a few soft sobs.  She looked back up at me, her eyes now stained red and a teardrop running down her cheek.  &quot;Do you know how embarrassing that was?&quot; she asked.  &quot;To be violated like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; I said.  &quot;I have no idea.  And I'm very sorry for what I did.  That is why I came here.  I want to make amends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you even know where I lived?&quot; she asked.  I just held up my hand again.  &quot;Oh, right,&quot; she said.  I was amazed that she didn't question the ring's power.  It seemed as if the emotional toll she felt made her vulnerable to other things.  &quot;Well, prove it,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...OK,&quot; I agreed.  &quot;I wish the color of your couch would change from blue to red.&quot;  In an instant the color of the couch changed.  She jumped up when she realized the wish took effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; she said.  &quot;What else can that thing do?&quot;<br />
<br />
I shook my head.  &quot;I really don't know exactly.  I've had it for about fifteen minutes, and in that time, I caused your clothes to disappear and reappear, found out where you lived and that you were coming here, and just that.&quot;  I left out one detail.  &quot;Oh, and I asked that no one else remember what happened when your clothes reappeared.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; she said.  &quot;So you're saying no one else saw me naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again I shook my head.  &quot;No, I don't think so, not exactly.  I think that they did see what happened, but then they forgot because of my wish.  You and I seem to be the only people who remember.  I thought that my wish would make you forget as well, but I think my wording was off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you want me to forget?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I felt bad,&quot; I said.  &quot;Like you said, I pretty much violated you.  But now I'm here, and I'm glad that I'm doing it this way rather than just wishing it away from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She wiped the remnants of the tear off her cheek.  &quot;I kind of wish you did,&quot; she said as a short laugh came out of her.  &quot;Oh, I'm such a wreck.&quot;  She sat back down on the couch.  I wished the color change back to blue.  &quot;Wait, you didn't even say anything,&quot; she protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems to know when I make an internal wish,&quot; I said.  &quot;Gonna have to be careful how I word things to myself even, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you want from me now?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want anything from you,&quot; I said.  &quot;I want to know if there's anything I can do to make things right.  Within reason,&quot; I quickly added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reason?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
I explained, &quot;I'd rather not do anything illegal or something that will be permanent and hurtful to someone else.  I certainly won't kill someone.  Actually I kind of hope it wouldn't let me do that anyway.  So what can I do for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She thought for a few seconds.  &quot;How about...&quot;</p>
