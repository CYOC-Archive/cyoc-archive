<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gregory and Geoffrey fought the hag, driving her back. She clawed and scratched at them, though Geoffrey merely accepted the blows and slammed his paw into her face.<br />
<br />
The hag just laughed as her face shattered, then, horrifyingly, reformed.<br />
<br />
“She won’t die!” Geoffrey shouted.<br />
<br />
Gregory, meanwhile, stabbed the hag in all the major vital parts he could suss out. Heart, brain, eyes-his rapier made quick work of her while Geoffrey distracted the old cat. Just like Geoffrey’s heavy blows, nothing seemed to put the hag down.<br />
<br />
“Geoffrey, the stone!” The mink shouted.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey closed his eyes as Gregory raised a sun stone and ignited it.<br />
<br />
A flash of sun-bright light filled the room. There was a hiss and a yowl. Geoffrey opened his eyes just in time to see the hag’s burning form dart into a room. He nodded to Gregory, who was opening his eyes.<br />
<br />
“I think she went this way!” Geoffrey pointed.<br />
<br />
Gregory glanced where the bear was pointing only to see the hag dart into a different door. <br />
<br />
“No, she went that way!” Gregory pointed at the door on the opposite side of the hallway. <br />
<br />
The two stared at each other for a moment.<br />
<br />
“This is a trap.” Geoffrey said.<br />
<br />
“Yes.”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure?”<br />
<br />
“Am I sure I want to separate and get trapped in different rooms. No.” Gregory smiled. “But we’re buying time.”<br />
<br />
“Understood, my liege.” Geoffrey ran into the door he’d seen the hag dart into. <br />
<br />
When the door closed behind the bear, Gregory swore he could feel cold emanating from it along with a flash of light. He shook his head. They were in it too deep now. Cautiously he walked to the door he’d seen the hag enter, opened it, and stepped inside.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
When Gregory opened his eyes, he was in a large ceremonial hut. <br />
<br />
Clearly, it was somewhere tropical, as the grasses outside were like a Savannah and the leaves roofing the hut were the type of large, browned fronds that only grew on the equator. The floor was made out of packed earth, and the air was filled with the smells of roasted meats and spoilt wine. <br />
<br />
Around him, handsome lions and lionesses basked on pillow and blankets, all of which were touching the soil. Gregory’s lips curled in disgust, baring much larger fangs than he was used to. What kind of horrid place would allow such finery to touch the dirt?<br />
<br />
Gregory shook his head and felt something heavy flow around him. He reached up a heavy hand pulled at his hair and found it to be a huge lion’s mane. Looking at his paw, he realized it was huge, tawny-furred and tipped with large black claws. That same tawny yellow fur covered his body- a huge body, more muscular, perhaps, than Geoffrey’s. Thick veins ran up and down his powerful forearms and his biceps were swollen as large as watermelon. He wore no clothing on his upper body save for a band of gold around his massively muscled neck.<br />
<br />
His nakedness only exposed his impressive chest and impeccable abs. Even his tail had changed, having become a three-and-a-half-foot appendage that nearly reached the floor when he stood. His feet had somehow reshaped into massive paws with claws thicker than the ones on his hand. Even his own head was large and wide…exactly like a lion’s.<br />
<br />
Smaller lions were crawling and writhing on the floor of what was obviously some kind of disgusting fuck-hut, if the carnal smells were any indicator. Gregory felt his own dick pound to erection in spite of his own personal feelings about the situation. Scent was a big trigger for any mammal, after all. And he was a hot blooded barbarian chieftain, strongest in all the land!<br />
<br />
The thought made him pause and shake his head.<br />
<br />
No, he wasn’t a barbarian! He was a Prince and he had a a throne to claim. This-this couldn’t be real!<br />
<br />
“My lord, you seem to be in need of relief.” A male said as both he and female lion crept up to him Gregory hands and knees, keeping their gazes low to the floor. Meeting a chieftain’s eyes was as good as a challenge, so of course the fools would not dare to do so. <br />
<br />
Soft paws caressed his stiff shaft, making the lion rumble a purr of delight. “Just relax, great warrior, let us attend to your needs.”<br />
<br />
As he looked around the room around him and felt a coarse tongue begin to run along his cock, Gregory felt a sudden realization come over him. <br />
<br />
It was what that horrible fat bear had said in the hallway, just before he’d been Tailored away back into Geoffrey. He’d told Gregory that he used to be a lion barbarian. Gregory had though it an insult at the time… but if he was telling the truth, then the hag was really behind this. He’d been her first victim, back when he was a barbarian.<br />
<br />
Clearly, the hag had some knowledge of that prior form.  She must have thought that was his true self, and that his current royal appearance was a mere façade meant to trick her.  But unfortunately for her, it was anything but that.  <br />
<br />
The hag had conjured an illusion for what had been an elaborate disguise.  And while it might have been the perfect illusion to fool that lion, it was an illusion that the true Gregory could easily see through.<br />
<br />
Now, Gregory noticed that the lions had surreptitiously placed an urn below his crotch. An urn that would likely catch his essence. Just like the hag had done when Gregory and Geoffrey had seated themselves on the couch.<br />
<br />
That bitch!<br />
<br />
With a roar, Gregory swiped at the concubines at his feet, sending them scattering away in wisps of smoke. The world around him wavered and disappeared, and Greg found himself alone in a bare-brick room. Old cobwebs hung in the corner.<br />
<br />
The door opened and Gregory saw something scurry out. Snarling, the mink bounded after it. The small figure darted out into the hall and ran into the door Geoffrey had entered, slamming the door behind it. <br />
<br />
Gregory grinned. Now it would be two on one. Odds in their favor.<br />
<br />
He opened the door and stepped inside.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-<br />
<br />
Geoffrey’s room opened into an arctic village.<br />
<br />
Igloos, vast igloos, rose up around Gregory. Polar bears of all shapes and sizes wandered around stringing up fish and salting them and drying them on strings in the sun. A few cubs laughed and played as the mink wandered the icy cold village. Fires appeared few and far between. Not much wood out here in the far north, he realized.<br />
<br />
Most fire were made from oil and blubber and seal fat and thus needed to be contained in lanterns.<br />
<br />
From what Geoffrey had told him, they mostly ate raw meat. In fact, preserving meat by freezing it was easier to do than cooking it. Only after Geoffrey, the genius amongst his people, had informed them of burning blubber for fuel and lighting, had they changed their ways. Indeed, the village appeared to be much more modern than his tales had claimed.<br />
<br />
“Who are you, little thing?” A bear said, voice slow and methodical.<br />
<br />
He was young, though Gregory wasn’t all that sure how young. Lankier of limb, perhaps? And had a little stomach that sat on his otherwise-muscular body. Gangly and well-fed. Something Geoffrey had told him his tribe was not. They should all be starving and emaciated.<br />
<br />
“My name is Gregory.” the prince replied.<br />
<br />
“Greg. Am Derk.” The polar bear pointed at himself. “What need?”<br />
<br />
“I am a king from a faraway land.  I heard of a great genius in this village and have come to seek his assistance.  Tell me, young cub,  where is Geoffrey?” The Prince replied, speaking slowly back.<br />
<br />
“Geoffrey?” The bear cocked his head. “You men Gef? Big Wise Chief? Bringer of Light?”<br />
<br />
“Erm, yes, that’s the one.” Gregory rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
Bringer of Light? What nonsense! Teaching a bunch of moronic bears about fire must have made him some sort of god to them. He would march into his throne room and straighten Geoffrey out properly, like he did when he’d found him long ago.<br />
<br />
“Follow, small thing.” The bear said smiling as it bounded  away.<br />
<br />
“What’s so funny?”<br />
<br />
“Hrrmph?” The bear turned, “You are cute. Small thing talking funny.”<br />
<br />
“True, I suppose you don’t get much dictation in a place like this.” Gregory sighed.<br />
<br />
 The bear picked up Gregory and hauled him towards a big igloo. Gregory considered protesting, but the bear was big, stupid, and smelled rather nice. While Gregory certainly had the dexterity to escape the grapple, why bother with the effort of walking when he could have this newfound servant carry him instead?<br />
<br />
“Small thing soft and fluffy.” The bear rumbled, petting Gregory’s head. “Like toy.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, like toy.” Gregory mumbled, snuggling deeper into the bear’s fur. “Gef.”<br />
<br />
“Gef.” The bear nodded and continued walking.<br />
<br />
Gregory yawned and stretched before settling back into the bear’s massive arms. This wasn’t so bad. He felt nice and relaxed, safe in the bear’s big arms. He inhaled the scent of its fur, which smelled of ice and the sea and slightly fishy, though not too over powering,.   And, of course,a pleasant musk - virile and hearty, it reminded him of Gef.<br />
<br />
The polar bear pulled away heavy hide from the door of a great igloo and ducked inside.<br />
<br />
Gregory’s eyes took a moment to adjust to the dim light inside the igloo, eventually focusing on an icy throne that was covered in seal hides, atop which sat a familiar polar bear - Geoffrey. <br />
<br />
Gregory felt a sudden concern. He’d had the wherewithal to withstand the illusion. But Geoffrey…he was a smart polar bear. But not so smart in comparison to say, anything else.<br />
<br />
“Gef, found toy!” The polar bear proudly announced, holding out Gregory.<br />
<br />
“Hello, Geoffrey.” The mink said, though his voice sounded muffled.<br />
<br />
“Cute!’ Geoffrey pronounced. “Derk good scout!”<br />
<br />
“Does Gef want?” Derk asked, bowing.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey stared at Gregory a moment. “No. You keep.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you Chief!” Derk said happily.<br />
<br />
“Wait..” Gregory said softly.<br />
<br />
His voice was light and airy. In fact, his body was feeling incredibly relaxed. So much so that he didn’t want to move. Gregory swallowed, his throat feeling dry, then tried to speak again.<br />
<br />
But instead of noise, what came out of his throat was far more solid, and it soon filled the inside of his mouth. Slowly, Gregory reached up a strangely numb hand and pulled out a bit of the unfamiliar substance.  Bringing it up to his eyes, he saw a tangled mass of white fur – white polar bear fur.  <br />
<br />
Gregory knew he had been nuzzling the bear as it had carried him to igloo, but he didn’t remember nuzzling that hard. <br />
<br />
More tufts filled his mouth, and soon he could feel the same fur beginning to fill the inside of his nose. It all smelled strongly of Derk, that lovely polar bear. His stomach began to rise, and he tried to sniffed again, only to find himself unable to do so. He felt so full, so bloated.<br />
<br />
Gregory’s arms’ and legs soon felt stiff and numb and as he looked, he saw them round out, features disappearing as they bloated. The smell of bear fur was absolutely filling him, it was all he could smell, all he could think. Derk gently squeezed Gregory’s middle and a puff of musky air escaped his mouth before it slowly stitched itself up into a cheery line.<br />
<br />
Derk’s paws moved towards Gregory’s crotch and gently rubbed. Pleasure shot through Gregory’s clouding mind. The longer Derk rubbed, the smaller Gregory’s cock shrank, , until all he was rubbing was a smooth, softly stitched leather, made from the pelt of a snow mink that the tribe had caught a few weeks ago. <br />
<br />
As the adolescent polar bear gently rocked him, something dribbled out of the mink into a bucket below. <br />
<br />
His mind was floating on a sea of clouds when his eyes turned to black beads. Derk kissed the top of his fluffy head, squishing his brain matter, and all the little mink doll could think of was how nice it was to be loved.<br />
<br />
The toy mink, stuffed with bear fur, thought very little when it was set down on the cold ground. <br />
<br />
It didn’t notice the cold anymore.  That was something for living creatures.  Heat, cold, those things didn’t matter to its new body – it would stay soft and fluffy regardless. <br />
<br />
The toy did see something strange about Derk, but it wasn’t quite sure what that might be.<br />
<br />
The cat tail wagging behind him? Maybe that was it. The toy gently drifted off.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
“Cute toy.” Gef grunted, eyeing the mink plush.<br />
<br />
“Not cute like you.” Derk grinned. <br />
<br />
The polar bear set the plush aside and pressed his cold nose to Gef’s cock, sniffing it. Gef’s cock grew erect, and Derk set about licking it and nuzzling it. It was huge, 9-inches long and thick as a beer can.<br />
Gef moaned in delight as his lover stroked and sucked his cock softly. Derk was an expert, knowing exactly where to caress him to make him feel good. He leaned back into the throne, spreading his legs to let the young bear have more access.<br />
<br />
“How Chief feel?” Derk asked, running his claws over Gef’s body, petting his fur.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Gef groaned, feeling relaxed.<br />
<br />
Derk gently squeezed the bear’s balls, and something leaked out of Gef’s cock.<br />
<br />
“Hurrr…” Gef moaned, drool leaking from his maw as he bucked his hips.<br />
<br />
“Nice and eager.” Derk’s voice shifted slightly. <br />
<br />
The bear’s paws trailed through Gef’s fur until they reached his pecs. Derk pinched Gef’s nipples. They puffed and pinked beneath his touch, then slowly reddened as the bear continued to rub. Each pinch and tickle on Gef’s sensitive nipples drew forth another moan. His pecs wobbled and began to swell beneath the bear&#39;s paws, milky fluid leaking from the tips. <br />
<br />
“Good kitten.”<br />
<br />
Everywhere Derk’s paws roamed, the muscles began to shrink and soften with fat. Derk’s moist mouth engulfed Gef’s cock again, bobbing deep and long, slurping hungrily. Gef writhed and moaned as his body slowly began to deflate, pulling in on itself. The polar bear placed a desperate paw on top of Derk’s head. The massive hand soon grew dainty, claws retracting into smaller paws.<br />
<br />
Derk’s bobs grew shorter and shorter as the massive polar bear dwindled in size. From a towering 8 feet tall, Gef had already shrunk to 6 feet and was dropping even further. He found himself bent over double as the sucking grew harder and harder, his sensitive breasts leaking milk over the younger polar bear’s back fur. <br />
<br />
“Yes, yes, yes!” Gef’s cries grew more higher pitched with every suck.<br />
<br />
One of Derk’s paws crept up to Gef’s muzzle and gently stroked it. Scars and aches that had plagued him for years vanished. Another paw crept up, caressing the other side of Gef’s face, massaging his muzzle. Vision appeared in his other eye while his flesh was pulled and tugged this way and that, gently altering his huge ursine skull into a dainty feline one. <br />
<br />
Derk’s muzzle no longer bobbed, instead it became just one prolonged suction, tongue lapping wildly at a greatly diminished cock. Gef couldn’t contain himself, gripping those paws and bucking his hips wildly into that lovely muzzle. Higher and higher pitched gasp came from his maw, his milky breasts bouncing. He thought he could feel his balls get pulled into that suckling muzzle, and then it was all pinpoint pleasure, lapping his nethers clean.<br />
<br />
With a high-pitched yowl, Gef felt sudden suction as his flesh seemed to pull itself inward. Still, Derk’s tongue did not abate, lapping gently as her flesh unfurled into glistening pink folds. Her tail flicked as she shrunk even smaller, breasts jostling.<br />
<br />
“Good girl.” <br />
<br />
Gef groaned, so small and helpless. She tried to push the bear’s big head away from her crotch, but she couldn’t even move him. He lapped and licked deeper and deeper, his tongue like a cock. Tingles filled her body and she felt something pleasurable shoot from her groin to her tits. <br />
<br />
“I-”<br />
<br />
Derk growled and shoved his snout deeper.<br />
<br />
Gef found his legs wrapping around the big bear’s neck and began rocking on his muzzle. His tongue was so thick and so wide. It was like a big, fat juicy cock. Filling her up, lapping up her juices.<br />
<br />
“Nyah!”<br />
<br />
The new catgirl let out a last, desperate cry as she came, and the last of her essence dribbled into the bear’s maw.<br />
<br />
The illusion vanished. Gef continued flexing and writhing around a jug set just below her crotch. Then she stared mindlessly up at the bare stone walls of the room, purring. Next to her lay a fuzzy polar bear doll, a jug of essence near it as well.<br />
<br />
Something small and horrible left out the door.</p>
