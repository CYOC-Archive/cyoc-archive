<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You know that movie about the family forgetting their kid at home, while they’re on the plane? Yea, that kinda happened to me, but my parents decided mid-flight that I could stay at home by myself.<br />
<br />
Now to any normal teenager, this was heaven.<br />
<br />
* Parents are on vacation for over a month<br />
* They’ll send money for food and other things<br />
* You can do whatever, whenever you want.<br />
<br />
But for someone of my caliber, it means something better.<br />
<br />
* I can use my powers freely, without any drawback<br />
* They’ll send me money, while I go to my secret job no one knows about.<br />
* I get to invite friends over, and we can do things that we normally can’t do in front of family<br />
<br />
Oh right, my powers. Yea I am kinda a super-powered human who has a shit ton of powers. Too many in fact, that I just use a few since they’re easier to remember. Those powers are:<br />
<br />
* Age Manipulation<br />
* Cloning<br />
* Clothing change<br />
* Size alteration<br />
* Teleportation<br />
<br />
Those are the ones I mainly use when I have a full day of no one entering my room. It’s kinda useful for someone like me, with my family.<br />
<br />
You see, I am one child in the family of 30. Yea, you heard me, 30. And you wanna know how it’s like, we’ll let me demonstrate it for you.<br />
<br />
You’re sitting in the living room watching a tv show about counting and other stuff you’d learn in kindergarten, when all of a sudden you are told to go to your room and play with what little toys you have because no one wants to deal with you.<br />
<br />
You are too young to play with any of you’re older siblings, and too old to play with you’re younger. With each family member growing up, having kids, and having those kids live in the same house, it’s kind of annoying.<br />
<br />
When you see my family, you’d think I’m one of my older brother or sister’s kids, but nope. It’s because of how old my parents are. They were 50 when they had me, and kept going after that. You’d think they’ll stop, but nope. Ever since I was born, diapers were seen non-stop. There was a period of time where I got jealous of my siblings and cousins for being care for. <br />
<br />
Due to his old age, my family decided to celebrate my father’s retirement, they all went to Hawaii. Fucking HAWAII of all places. <br />
<br />
I know what you’re thinking, and no I can’t teleport to Hawaii. My limit so far is 100 miles, and there is a time limit of 5 minutes before I teleport again. Now I could teleport high enough where I have more than 5 minutes of falling, then teleport again, but here’s the second limit: location. You can’t teleport inside a bank unless you’ve seen the inside. I learned the hard way of accidentally teleporting halfway in the ground. Luckily for me, I was able to wait and teleport out.<br />
<br />
While we’re talking about my teleportation, let’s just go ahead and talk about other abilities.<br />
<br />
There are way too many to list out, but I’ve discovered at least 500 of them.<br />
<br />
Most of them are useless, and would never be used in some sort of battle or escape. One of these useless powers is being able to grow my nails, and control them. It’s useless due to the fact of how god damn much it hurts. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I learned I had these abilities while I was in my room, reading my older brother’s comic books, and immediately being punish for taking his stuff.<br />
<br />
I was told that I wasn’t having dinner, so I sat angrily in my hand me down ‘Thomas The Train’ chair. After maybe an hour of being all grumpy, I wanted to be older and not be treated like a little kid. And you know what happened? I became a teenager, and ripped what clothes I had on. This resulted in major panic, that got me back to my normal age, and allowed me to create my old clothes out of thin air.<br />
<br />
No one knew what happened that day, except for me. I kept it a secret and learned my powers when I was home alone. Sometimes I would have to “play outside” and figure them when I was out there.<br />
<br />
Anyways, there I am slightly pissed that I missed the trip to Hawaii, and I just wanted to lie down and cry. I was about to do that too, when I realized to myself “I’m home alone? I’m home alone!” <br />
<br />
And let’s just say I spend the next hour getting “food” that wouldn’t survive a minute in the house. Pizza, ice cream, burger and French fries, candy, and soda. This was easy with my clones having exactly the same amount of money I had in my pocket, and leaving the house to get what I wanted.<br />
<br />
So, the next thing I did was pig out, but not in my normal form. Oh no, you’re mistaken if you’d think I’d gain weight in my normal body. I became a child, and took off my old clothes so I could create new ones. My once naked body was covered with Batman underwear. Sooner later, it was covered with ice cream stains and immediate regret of eating chocolate chip ice cream after having 4 slices of three meat pizza. The next hour I spend in the bathroom puking out what I ate.<br />
<br />
I avoided junk food for the rest of the day, and just tried to relax my body for a while. A drawback to becoming younger and older is that I become hungry. It’s worse when i become older, since my smaller stomach didn’t eat enough for the size of my older stomach.<br />
<br />
After deciding to just eat two slices of pizza, and have a cup of water with it, I took a bubble bath. It was fun to just sit there and pretend the boats and rubber ducks were having an intense battle.<br />
<br />
After my bath, i dried myself off and stood there naked in front of my bed. I didn’t really know my age, nor did I know if I had bedwetting problems at the time. I shrugged off the anxiety and just made a diaper, and wore it along with a space onesie. <br />
<br />
So if anyone came into my room, they’d see a little kid, no older than 5, in a onesie with stars, a moon, and a rocket ship designs, and with a diaper on. But no one was home to do that. <br />
<br />
I kinda felt lonely and slightly energetic; so the one thing that would get me exhausted was to use one of my abilities, and that would be to clone myself.<br />
<br />
After a few clones playing games with me, jumping on my bed, and reading me a bedtime story, I was exhausted and was able to sleep. <br />
<br />
To me, life was great. Even if my family was having fun, they wouldn’t have the time of their life like me at the moment.</p>
