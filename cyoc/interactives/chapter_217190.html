<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jeff sat there and waited for things to change from their interaction with the Chronovac, he wondered if it truly worked. The idea of becoming a werewolf was always a dream of his from seeing the various werewolf themed films of his youth, in cartoons and comics. Hell... Jeff was so much a fan of werewolves... he collected anything and everything that involved them. Movies, visual novels, comic books, regular books, art, action figures and anything else you could imagine that had to do with the monster. He even had the Twilight series in book and movie format, even though he hated the content... he was a bit of an obsessive completionist and felt compelled to own them, just for the sake of owning anything related to werewolves. The thing for Jeff was that he really loved the aspect of being a monster... not just a werewolf to shift between forms. No... he loved the darker side, the carnage, the viscera and gore. He only ever knew his mother and didn&#39;t know a thing about his father, but what his mother did to him and let others do... it grew a dark monster inside Jeff... one that sought revenge on them all and being the monster... he could get away with it. Did Jeff want revenge against his father... no... in fact he didn&#39;t blame his dad for leaving... he just wished his father took him with instead.<br />
<br />
As Jeff sat there, a sudden wave washed over him making him feel dizzy and his head swimming. It felt like a massive wave of the ocean&#39;s waters crashed into him and threw him for a loop. As he came out of it, shaking his head and clearing his mind, he looked over to his girlfriend Jenny and started to feel weird about looking at her. In fact, while he knew he cared for and loved her... that just didn&#39;t seem right any more. As he sat there, reality was rewriting itself and his wish to become the very thing he wanted was taking bold of him. What Jeff didn&#39;t know was that lycanthropy was a male only trait and most that had it were bisexual, with a favoring toward men, so that they could procreate naturally... whereas others were straight up gay. As the Chronovac was altering Jeff&#39;s reality, it was making him gay and the longer he sat there, the more uncomfortable he was feeling being around Jenny. He no longer saw her as his girlfriend and even felt awkward about being there in the first place. Though he still saw Jenny as a friend, Jeff no longer felt that he could be there, in that moment with her, any longer. <br />
<br />
&quot;H- hey Jenny, I&#39;m really sorry, but I-I need to go! I&#39;m not feeling the best at the moment and I think it&#39;s for the best if I leave...&quot; Jeff said as he got up from the chair and woozily stood up. <br />
<br />
Seeing his imbalance, still thinking of him as her boyfriend, she rushed over and tried to help him. &quot;I think you shouldn&#39;t go anywhere! You don&#39;t look like you should be driving or doing much of anything at the moment.&quot; Jenny protested as she touched his shoulder lovingly, smiling at him, wanting him to stay since both of their fantasies were going to come true... not looking at the screen that had a warning message.<br />
<br />
The warning message said: Warning - Target no longer in current reality. Target&#39;s reality shifted to fit parameters in line with the reality requested. Target can no longer be changed per target&#39;s request.<br />
<br />
As Jenny helped Jeff stand to move him to a different spot in her home, she then saw the message and blurted out, &quot;Jeff... what did you do!?&quot; She then scrolled down the screen, seeing that he wanted him and his family to be werewolves in control of their transformations and be further and further in werewolf form depending on their level of horniness and wouldn&#39;t be able to change to human form until that horny side was taken care of. &quot;So... you changed reality to fit your desires, but it seems that it had unintended consequences. So... I need to know... do you still love me?&quot; Jenny asked, looking at him with loving eyes.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled, feeling a bit better, ready to leave as he wanted to earlier. &quot;Thanks for helping me up, though that wave that crashed into me really knocked me for a loop. I don&#39;t know what happened, but I&#39;m glad it&#39;s over with. To answer your question Jenny, yeah... I still love you, but you know I&#39;m gay and I don&#39;t love you in that way. We&#39;ve been over this before...&quot; Jeff said, trying to be gentle and let her down easy.<br />
<br />
Hearing his words, her eyes and entire body perked up, but then immediately slumped in defeat as she heard the rest of what he had to say. &quot;Of course he&#39;d turn gay from the fantasy he wanted...&quot; she thought to herself as she looked over his changed parameters.<br />
<br />
Having no choice, other than to accept the new reality, since the Chronovac said it could no longer be changed, she had to let him go and hoped he&#39;d love his fantasy and he&#39;d now find the man of his dreams. &quot;Yeah... I know... and I&#39;m sorry for pushing. I can&#39;t help you&#39;re a great guy and definitely my type. You know I only want the best for you and hope you do find the man of your dreams... whether or not he&#39;s a werewolf like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing her kind words, Jeff smiled and gave her a hug before turning to leave. &quot;Thanks Jenny and I know I will... plus it helps that werewolf cum is highly infectious to men and will turn any non-werewolf male into a werewolf... so kinky, dirty, uninhibited sex can go on without worrying about us hurting the other. You know how us werewolves can get!&quot; He said with a smile, walking out as Jenny could only think to herself... &quot;no, I don&#39;t Jeff, but I wished your desire didn&#39;t change our relationship to find out for myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the door closed and a new chapter began in both of their lives, Jeff walked to his car in her driveway as she watched through the window. Jenny was about to start going through her changes into a dragoness, now alone, but figured she&#39;d make the best of the situation as it was.<br />
<br />
As Jeff got into his car, he could feel his horniness starting to build... again... thinking he had gotten off in his werewolf form hours ago... but had yet to truly transform for the first time. He thought about where to go... would he go home to his kinky father and submit himself to his Master’s rule. Would he hit the gym or the bar to see if he could find another guy to take ownership of him... and turn them into a werewolf... if they weren&#39;t already. His father was the known safe bet, the other two would be adventurous, but regardless of the other two options... they were places where kink and fetishes were welcomed in spades. Ultimately, Jeff made up his mind as he slowly and cautiously backed down the driveway before hitting the asphalt, heading...</p>
