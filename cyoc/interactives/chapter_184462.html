<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Besides herself, there were six other adults in the perfectly ordinary looking boardroom before she changed reality with Amanda&#39;s new magical app, now their were four toddlers, and two babies that looked a bit older than 12 months in a new version of the room that was decorated to look like daycare with baby blue colored walls and large paintings of anthro cartoon animals in business attire.<br />
<br />
  Amanda was so shocked by the sudden change of the boardrooms appearance that she, for a moment, didn&#39;t notice the age ratio of the room as she looked around in awe at all the things in the room that had changed.  The first thing she noticed was the paintings of the funny animal businessmen on the walls.  They were all animals that you would typically find at a zoo, lions, tigers, bears (On My!), kangaroos with joey&#39;s in their poaches, and a few of the more exotic animals like animals in the critically endangered list you&#39;d see in some bigger city zoo&#39;s and rarer animals like a Serval.  All the animals had big bright smiles on their faces and were doing things like typing at their desks, talking happily around a watercooler, and there was even a male lion giving slideshow presentation complete with a long pointing stick for emphasis like in the days before you could highlight the essential points of your presentation using different editing tricks and built in animations.  Amanda even spotted a few copyrighted characters they might need to remove to not get sued by any visiting media conglomerates!  She then noticed the long table had been changed become a softer, more accident proof material that she could sink her chubby hands into before feeling anything hard underneath, and everyone was using clipboards and kids tablets to write their notes down on, presumably because it was harder to write on paper on the table, since it would most likely sink into in the softer table now.<br />
<br />
  The room was filled with crayons, toddler toys, stuffed animals, and a few teething rings and soft teething toys one of which was something a stuffed animal feed her skin to what a puppy might use, BEING USED BY DEREK!! (HAHA!  EAT SHIT DEREK, YOU POMPOUS ASSHOLE, NOW YOU CAN&#39;T EVEN EAT SOLID FOODS SAVE FOR THE SOFTEST PEARS AND OTHER SOFT FRUITS!!  HAVE FUN SITTING IN YOUR TOILET AS THE REST OF US GET TO USE USE THE BIG KID POTTIES AS YOU TEETH ON CHEW TOYS MADE FOR DOGS!!).  The only thing that stayed the same was the pull down screen for slideshows and the projector hanging below the ceiling attached by cables to the boardroom office computer.  Then again, the computer seems to be white with bright green and red highlights like a toddler safe tablet or toddler game console from the early aughts, complete with a full qwerty keyboard with larger, brighter buttons.  What Amanda assumed was the slideshow remote was now slightly bigger and also had large easy to read buttons with more symbols than words, and the papers they were writing on and official business documents had a mix of words and emoji-like symbols on them, Amanda could only assume this was for the now two and one year olds who might not have the same reading levels as before.  And to top it all off, the boardroom seemed to have all the other equipment she&#39;d find at the company&#39;s daycare room, the room had a big toy chest, a time out corner, a fully stocked changing table, and roll up mats and tiny mattresses for naps.<br />
<br />
Before she could examine anything else, Amanda was snapped out of her inquisitive examining of her surroundings by a tiny muffled voice.  &quot;Miss &#39;Manda, watchoo wooking at?&quot;  She then shifted her gaze towards the source of the voice and let out a small giggle when she realized it was Derek, talking to her with his mouthful of his teddy bear teether.  She then ( finally) looked over the rest of the board and then frowned when she realized that, including dumb Derek, there were only two businesspeople that were around one year old.  The other baby also happened to be one of the two other women-turned-girls on the board the formerly buxom blonde Susan (her office prides itself for its gender equal board of director&#39;s, but Amanda knows for a fact that Susan, formerly only 28, was on the board because she slept with Derek, she accidentally stumbled into their love making in a company retreat to a ski resort, that she was frankly lucky to go to back when she was a secretary, when she got their rooms mixed up after having too much red wine, Amanda hated them both ever since.)  Amanda smiling in satisfaction that she brought her to most hated people at work down several hundred pegs, let her eyes wander from the two (as they adorably start playing patty-cake), to look around the rest of the room, the first thing she noticed is that everyone was wearing a little two piece suit that had ties and white undershirts and everything, but we&#39;re all soft pastel colored in either baby blue or light pink, with material that felt soft and warm to the touch on her skin as she noted hers.  Amanda then noted her former boss Alexander Greyhorn, who was pushing fifty before, was now younger than her at two, and with a full grown mop of hair when previously he had finally shaved his nasty comb over off.  The other women-turned-girl Patricia, now Patty I guess, was Amanda&#39;s age at three and holding a stuffed samurai bunny (Amanda always guessed she was some kind of Weeabo when she spotted her watching subtitled Shoujo anime at her cubicle during lunch break) in her arm as she absentmindedly sucked her thumb as she looked at Amanda with big, wide eyes.  Her other male co-workers Douglas Freeman III, the only black guy on the board, and David Yoshida, the only Asain American, we&#39;re both looking at her while running their little tin car toys back and forth on the long table.  Dougie looked like he was in-between two and three and Davey was three.  &quot;Sowwy guys, I guess I gots distwacted since I was tawking so long &#39;bout our eawnings.&quot;  They seemed satisfied with that answer as they nodded their heads and murmered in agreement.<br />
<br />
While she was very disappointed that their weren&#39;t more one year olds she could mess with by showing off how much more dexterous, agile and coordinated her body was in comparison to theirs, she was satisfied with everyone else being, more or less, being brought down to her level (save for Derek and Susie, who didn&#39;t deserve to be a big girl like her! Haha!).  She then decided to....</p>
