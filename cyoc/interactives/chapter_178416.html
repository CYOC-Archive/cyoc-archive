<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason puts the amulet around his neck and admired the way it sat on his chest in the mirror. He wasn&#39;t usually the type of guy who liked any kind of jewlery, but something about the amulet felt different, like there was some strange power associated with it.<br />
<br />
Jason walked back to his room with the towel still around his waist and noticed that there were some big clothes on the floor near his bed. Jason scowled a little. They looked like they belonged to his dad. He didn&#39;t remember why his father had left them in his room but he didn&#39;t want them there.<br />
<br />
Jason bent down to examine the article of clothing. It was a dirty wifebeater and a pair of old gray briefs. It looked like they have been in his father&#39;s wardrobe for a while.<br />
<br />
Jason didn&#39;t really have time to think too much about this since he was getting ready for his girlfriend who was going to be there in about 20 minutes. They were heading out to a movie which they still enjoyed doing even though they had been dating for over 6 months. Just thinking about Sara coming over started to excite Jason and the front of his towel began to tent outward a bit...<br />
<br />
Jason sighed as he picked up the clothes and walked over to his closet. The briefs brushed up against the amulet he was wearing. Immediately, a strange tingle passed through Jason’s body which made him pause.<br />
<br />
“Weird…” Jason said out loud to himself. He threw the clothes to the corner and began to look for his boxers.<br />
<br />
When Jason looked back into his closet, something seemed wrong. He used to be eye level with his 5th shelf that had his boxers, but he was definitely staring above it. He looked down to verify that he was definitely standing straight up. That was when he also noticed that his legs looked hairier than they used to.<br />
<br />
“What the hell?” Jason exclaimed as he noticed that he was now staring nearly straight between his 6th and 7th shelf. The towel began to feel tight around his waist. He was growing!<br />
<br />
Slightly panicked, Jason threw off his towel. Now naked, he noticed that he had grown a lot of body hair that he hadn&#39;t there before. He raised his arms and discovered two thick bushes under them but they weren&#39;t as thick as the pubic bush above his penis and it was thickening as he watched!<br />
<br />
A tickling sensation on his shoulders brought his hands there only to find that he was broadening. He turned to his full length mirror and gasped at what looked more like a young man looking back at him than a preteen boy. His face was squarer and more…manly? His body hair also gave him the distinct look of a hirsute guy. He had grown nearly 1 feet at this point. He turned to notice that his butt had gotten some hair too and was more plumper.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jason felt a strange feeling in his groin. He already knew he was hairier down there but he didn&#39;t know what was coming. His hands shot down to his slowly growing penis. He can feel it fattening and he also felt his testicles dropping into a loose and quite hairy scrotum. He held his increasing shaft as it was going from soft to hard for the first time in its adult size.<br />
<br />
“Shit! It&#39;s huge!” Jason was startled by his own voice. It sounded like his father&#39;s.<br />
<br />
He looked back into the mirror with dread. Staring back at him was a naked man that looked just like his father. The amulet was still around his neck and the medallion hung just over his new chest hair on his much hairy body.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck happened to me!” Jason cried sounding rather ridiculous with his new voice.<br />
<br />
Then…</p>
