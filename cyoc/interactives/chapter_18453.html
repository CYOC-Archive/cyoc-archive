<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty and Dustin decided to test out these special ability that he had spontaneously developed.  Ty knew the exact place he wanted to test this out... the gym.  Ty figured that if he was going to steal from people, it might as well be muscle mass.  As they rounded the corner at the bottom of the street, they saw a large guy standing over a much smaller kid.  The guy was Joshua.  He went to school with Dustin and Ty.  He was 20, but he couldn't manage to get out of high school, mostly because he came to class once a month.<br />
<br />
  Joshua was standing over the kid, who couldn't have been more than 14.  He was holding the kids skateboard, laughing.  This was a common thing for him.  He never picked on people his own size, but instead stayed with the junior high mentality of picking on the littler guy.  It was easy for him too, because Josh was huge.  He was probably 5'11&quot;, so he was average in height, but he had to be 250 pounds of muscle.  He was laughing, then took the skateboard and smashed it over his knee.  Then walked into the gym, chuckling.<br />
<br />
  The boy slammed his hand on the pavement and looked to the friend behind him.  &quot;Man, if he was our age... I'd teach him a lesson!&quot; He said.  Ty scratched his chin and looked at Dustin, who had obviously caught on too.  They walked past the two boys and went into the gym to watch Josh.  <br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
  The surveilance went well.  They watched Josh work out, trying to look unassuming, Ty worked out as well.  He stayed in the weight area for about an hour, then towled his head off and walked to the showers.  Ty followed along behind him.  He walked into the steamy shower room and saw Josh leaving his locker buck naked.  Ty stripped down and put his stuff in a locker and followed along behind the guy.  Joshua could feel the guy following him and turned around to see Ty standing there.<br />
<br />
  &quot;What are you following me for?&quot;  He said, then chuckling grabbed his cock and shook it.  &quot;Never seen one this big and wanted a closer look?&quot; he laughed.  Ty moved his towel, exposing the 8 incher he had.  That shut Joshua up quick.  &quot;Nah... I wanted to ask you about those kids outside.&quot; Ty walked forward.  Josh laughed again.  &quot;What, you his big brother or something?&quot;  Ty shook his head.  Ty made a wish.  &quot;I wish that Joshua would get younger, until he was 12 again.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Joshua stopped laughing as a tingling feeling crept across his body.  His muscles began to shrink, and his height began to drop.  The years were melting away quickly from him.  He was doubling over, and he began to notice the changes.  His muscles were noticibly smaller.  He looked at his legs and saw that they were the size they were before he was using steroids.  He didn't realize that he had dropped a few inches in height as well, falling to 5'8&quot;.  He was about 17 now.  His body began to regress faster now, his height fell down again to 5'6&quot;.  His muscles began losing bulk and definition.  His leg hair lightened a bit. Now he was 15.  &quot;What's happening to me?&quot; He said, panting.<br />
<br />
  His muscles shrank till he was scrawny, his height fell quickly, dropping him down to 4'11&quot;. His leg hair dissappeared, and his 6 inch prick shrank to 2 and a half inches.  &quot;I'm a kid!&quot; He shouted, gasping at his higher voice.  He looked up at ty, who was chuckling.<br />
<br />
  Now all the years he had lost were transferring themselves to Ty.  Ty felt himself growing a bit taller, 6'2&quot;, 6'4&quot;.  His muscles thickened, and developed more and more.  His big dick grew even larger, 9 inches, 10 inches, 11 inches, 11 and a half.  His leg and pubic hair thickened again.  &quot;Whoa...&quot;  Ty said, noticing his voice was even deeper.  He realized his head was now touching the lamp hanging above him.  He was 7 feet tall now!  Ty thought that he would've just aged as many years as Josh lost, but he was getting everything that went along with them!  He was going through his second puberty of the day!  So all this muscle development was just part of the puberty...  Ty felt his whole body begin to expand again, the muscles growing larger and larger.  He already looked like a bodybuilder, he was going to be huge...<br />
<br />
  His already thick muscles began to swell, they pumped up with more and more mass.  Ducking under the lamp, he wandered over to the scales near the locker and stood, seeing the number pop up. 230 pounds.  He watched as the number climbed up further and further.  60 pounds already....  His muscles looked overdeveloped.  They were overly defined, but just kept getting clearer.  Ty groaned as his widening shoulders wedged between the lockers and the wall on his right.  As he grew, the lockers dented inward.  His whole body was wider... possibly from his bone structure growing from the second puberty.  He managed to pull his body from the alcove, but not before reaching 300 pounds.  130 pounds bigger....  How much weight would he gain from this?  His lats pushed his arms up on each side.  His huge quads were almost crushing his balls.  His body was looking more mature the whole while.. He had grown 5 years older so far, just 3 more to get.<br />
<br />
  Ty felt the weight of his huge body.  He FELT huge, it was strange.  He just continued to grow.  He felt his swelling pecs, his hands looking more mature, his body pulsing and aging.  He grew larger, larger.  He leaned against the wall behind him and stroked his huge cock and balls.  He was growing into the final year now.  340 pounds, 8 years older... The now 23 year old Ty started to jerk off. Not paying attention to the scrawny Joshua grabbing stuff from his locker and running out of the room, holding up his huge shorts.  Ty just kept stroking his 15 inch hardon, moaning in his even lower voice.  It took him a while, but he came.<br />
<br />
  Dustin slowly opened the door and peered in at his brother, who was now a giant of a man.  &quot;Ty, we should go!  You're huge, someone's gonna call the military or something!&quot; he said.  Ty looked at him.  &quot;Yeah, I guess we should.  I've got no clothes though.  Your tiny stuff won't fit me anymore.&quot;  Ty stood slowly.  &quot;So, it might be a problem...&quot;<br />
