<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Holy shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon awoke to a ruckus taking place nearby.  He opened his eyes just in time to see 16-year-old Jay leap bodily from his sleeping position on the couch.  Bryan was also startled awake, and attempted to sit up, finding it more difficult than usual.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  What is it?&quot;  Bryan yelled, trying to push the large, soft weight off his body, not realizing it was his own stomach.<br />
<br />
The small windows of the basement allowed the late-morning light into the room and dimly illuminate the three friends.<br />
<br />
Simon, also getting used to his new weight and girth, managed to roll over and push himself into a sitting position.  He was pleased that his experimenting with the Chronivac hadn&#39;t been a dream, and that his friends had kept their unique new forms.  Though, it would probably be best if he found a way to calm his friend down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jay,&quot; Simon said calmly, putting his hands up.  &quot;It&#39;s just us.  Simon and Bryan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wuh...&quot; Jay rubbed his eyes and squinted at his friends.  &quot;No way!  You don&#39;t look anything like...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan, unable to quite maneuver his body just yet, half rolled on his side.  He looked up at Simon, and then at Jay.  &quot;What the-  Who are you guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon struggled to his feet, his bulky body making things just a tad difficult.  &quot;Guys, I need to you calm down before things get out of hand.  We&#39;ve changed during the night.  All of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay, still getting the grasp of the situation peered more closely at the two.  &quot;Simon?  Since when did you have red hair?  And when did the two of you get so fat?  And, wait, all of us?&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked down at his strong, toned arms.  He ran a hand up his forearm, feeling the fine dusting of hair.  &quot;Holy shit...  How did this happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan was still trying to pull his thoughts together from the fog of sleep.  He finally managed to push himself into a sitting position, like Simon.  &quot;Who are you calling fat?  I know I&#39;m not the thinnest guy around, but-&quot;  His words cut short when he noticed his own 303 lb. body.  Eyes wide, he gripped the large gut that dominated his torso, barely hidden by his tight jersey.  &quot;Frick!  Where did this come from?&quot;  He looked at his own pudgy arms.  &quot;How did I get so fat?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan managed to quickly stumble to his feet, rattling the furniture around them.  Simon had known Bryan was now big, but it was hard to appreciate how big until he was standing.  With him just scraping past six feet and over three hundred pounds, he was tall and thick.  His trunk-like legs easily supported his massive upper body.  He was just a hair taller than the now six-foot-tall Jay, who was now looking at Bryan closely.<br />
<br />
Jay shrugged.  &quot;I mean, you don&#39;t look bad.  You&#39;re just bigger is all.  A lot bigger.  I mean, I&#39;m bigger, too, just not as big as you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon, still sitting, held a hand up to each of his friends.  &quot;A little help?&quot;<br />
<br />
With some tugging, Jay and Bryan pulled Simon to a standing position.  He would have to get used to his bulkier form.<br />
<br />
Jay, calming down now, tousled Simon&#39;s hair a bit.  &quot;What&#39;s with the red hair?  Did mine change, too?&quot;  He reached up and tousled his own hair, his hand scraping past his more developed chin.  He reached back down, rubbing his jaw and feeling his chin scruff.  &quot;Woah, wait a minute.  Am I...  Am I older?  Are we all older?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay ran around the couch and into the basement bathroom to get a look at himself in the mirror.  He turned his head to observe it from all angles, smiling at his new facial hair.<br />
<br />
Simon shook his head.  &quot;No, just you.  You&#39;re sixteen, now.  Remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay poked his head back out the bathroom.  &quot;Remember?  Remember what?&quot;  His eyes widened.  &quot;Wait.  I do remember!  I can remember my sixteenth birthday.  I remember driver&#39;s ed.!  But... how?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan frowned at Simon.  &quot;I have the feeling Simon knows more than he&#39;s telling us.  He seems to know a lot about what&#39;s going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon smiled.  &quot;Alright, you guys got me.  I did it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay looked around the room, as if expecting an answer to his questions to suddenly appear.  &quot;What?  How?  Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll show you.&quot;  Simon retrieved the portable Chronivac from the mantle, where his father had left it.  &quot;It&#39;s the Chronivac.  It can change literally anything.  I just wanted to see what it could do.  And, before you ask, none of this is permanent.  I can change you back whenever.  But, if it&#39;s okay with you guys, I&#39;d rather keep having fun with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan looked skeptical.  He opened his mouth to argue, then looked at his friends.  &quot;Alright.  Let&#39;s say I believe you.  I wouldn&#39;t mind losing a couple of pounds, here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay elbowed Bryan in the shoulder.  &quot;Now, let&#39;s hold on.  We haven&#39;t really given this a chance, yet.  Don&#39;t be so quick to toss a good thing.  I mean, you don&#39;t look half bad, Bryan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan looked down at his body again.  His jersey was pulled taught across his large, round stomach, which sagged over his pants.  His love handles deeply creased across his sides.  &quot;You think so?  I mean, you have it easy being all physically fit.  Why&#39;d you make me so big, Simon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon shrugged.  &quot;Hey, I was just messing with things, seeing how the Chronivac worked.  I aged Jay up to 16, in increased you in height and weight and bumped up your testosterone, and did the same to my dad with some gene stuff to see if it trickled down.&quot;  Simon chuckled and patted his own gut.  &quot;And it did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay frowned, looking at his friends.  &quot;So, you guys are still 13?  Then how come you&#39;re so hairy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan began looking himself over.  &quot;Hairy?&quot;  He noticed the hairs along his arms and just below his belly button.  He reached up and felt the hairs forming sparse sideburns.  &quot;I don&#39;t... Wait, according to my new memories, in this reality I have a hormonal condition which produces extra testosterone.  And I haven&#39;t even started puberty, yet!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay laughed.  &quot;Huh!  Wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan held a hand up to Jay.  &quot;But that&#39;s not all.  I&#39;m... taking college courses.  Wow, really?  Did my IQ get bumped along the way?  I feel really-&quot;  Bryan was interrupted by a loud growling noise.  &quot;Hungry, actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another loud growl filled the room.  Simon chuckled and rubbed his own stomach.  &quot;Me, too.  Come on, we can talk during breakfast.&quot;</p>
