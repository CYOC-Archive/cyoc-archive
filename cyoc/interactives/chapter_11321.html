<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning at 9:00 sharp Nancy was at the Bayoun's front door knocking. Her third knock was met by the door opening and Tina asking her inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come up to my room, we can talk there!&quot; said Tina softly as if wishing her parents not to know she was there.<br />
<br />
Once inside the room Tina closed and locked her door. Then turning to a surprised Nancy she started.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, there we can talk in private and undisturbed! Before we go on asking and telling I need to tell you how, or what maybe the explanation I gave for disappearing. I told them all I fell out by the bluff and must have hit my head, my memory and all for a while went blank. Now the crazy head shrink Mom sent me too hypnotised me and learned the story or most of it. They discovered I'd lost my virginity and he surmised that I must have been raped and therefore made up a fantasy story to match and use it as a mental crutch. Anyway our true secret is still a secret, right?&quot; asked Tina looking nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I told not a soul but I still feel I abandoned you at a time of need!&quot; grumbled Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Need, now there's a word to tell a story you might not believe or maybe understand! Well, I grew quite fast and matured from the filly to a yearling in just six months. Sandy kept me busy training to be a riding horse and unlike a common horse I stood there understanding her plans between her and her Father.<br />
<br />
It was during the many months that followed as you changed me in late Summer and then Fall, Winter, it was Spring I think maybe April when it began. I could not see a calander but even though I could think and hear, and understand what was being spoken I lost the ability to read? So I must guess when these things took place so just roll along with my story, OK?<br />
<br />
Now where was I, ah, I kept having these twinges or feelings. It was off and on but kept going longer and longer as if someone was moving a feather all over my big rear. Worst of all was as the feeling began to tingle all around my mare sex. I'd flick and flop my tail violently trying to cope with the annoying feelings. I would walk over small bushes making it scrape under me through my crotch and pop out scratching my butt, yet nothing worked and the tingling feeling got worse.<br />
<br />
So bad was it I stood for hours rubbing my butt against the stable walls or a fence post. I would break into sweats that made me look like I'd been on a five mile trot. I shook and had chills, even the Palamino mare came close and nickered at me for friendly comfort.<br />
<br />
It was as I stood in my stall that Sandy without knowing she did told me I was coming into season early. According to her I should have been a year older before the maddening lust would make me in heat but I was coming into those crude feelings early.<br />
<br />
Now you and I both have our periods and maybe because I was of that age I matured faster once I became a Filly, I can't say. Oh, but your monthly period was never like this!<br />
<br />
Shaking, sweating, I was a nervous wreck. The tickling feeling was constant! Now you and I have other things to take up our time during the daytime and I suspect it's those things which help keep our minds occupied and not dwelling on our bodies' feelings. But, I was just a mare and during the day or evenings would graze but felt and thought about my building urges. That wretchid tickle kept up all the time and when you are a horse there is countless hours of standing around listening to your gut process chewed grass.<br />
<br />
I mean, you do frolic and play but those times happen quickly and soon either one or both of those playing forgets the playtime and returns mostly to grazing.<br />
<br />
Now Sandy saw my plight and tried her best to make me comfortable. She'd wash me down with warm water and then brush and curry comb my hairy hide making me lulled off into a dreamy world. Try as she did the feeling returned again once my my was released from thinking about other things more vital.<br />
<br />
My daily trot pulling the cart, or when Sandy saddled me and she rode out along the many paths and trails about the lakeshore. It all helped but the feelings grew and intensified. Soon I would snap my teeth at Sandy's approach and about then I was placed in a small paddock with Pegasus.<br />
<br />
Pegasus had enjoyed me before but not when I was feeling so rough and rotten. His scent turned the corner for me as equine instincts took hold and a pattern of events took the obvious course.<br />
<br />
As before her lips nibbled my lips and cheeks, then along my neck. He worked his nibbling along my sweaty flanks till he stood to one side almost thinking I might lash out with a nasty kick. He sniffed my scent, his upper lip curled up showing his large teeth. I thought from a human vantage that he was repulsed by my scent, wrong, wrong, wrong!<br />
<br />
I lowered my head almost to the ground as maybe feeling lower than low at that moment.<br />
<br />
Then a touch, Pegasus licked my female sex. Again he licked off the dripping juices, it chilled me and a wild panic feeling of raw beastly passion began.<br />
<br />
Human's can not understand the lusting passion for quelling my taunted body of those tickled feeling, they were driving me crazy! Yet maybe crazy is what one would need to be a little as what happened next.<br />
<br />
Pegasus snorted as if giving me a blow back there it made me feel, giddy, or ready, I just can't put it into words. I remembered what I knew of the mating rituals and lifted my tail high and to the right for his full pleasure. He licked me again as if accepting the offered!<br />
<br />
I stepped and spread my hind legs out for his entry and to hold his larger weight. This in turn spread my vulva making the juices flow and with a inner urge I pressed back, the juices spurted out some hitting him on his muzzle.<br />
<br />
He went wild dancing about shaking his great head and making his cock flaile from side to side beating against his flanks.<br />
<br />
Nervous as one might expect I'd felt him three times before but never had he gotten thrilled enough to spew his seed. This time I was wanting and willing to stay the course and ride myself of those longing tickling passion feelings no matter whether I got pregnant or what.<br />
<br />
Again, my head held low as the sign of submission, leg spread wide for to alure him if he really needed any! Then he came close I felt his fast hot breathing breaths, thud he came down on he heavy and hard.<br />
<br />
I was by then very sturdy of muscle and bone and held his weight with ease. He reached his head and from the corner of my eye I expected he'd bit me in the whithers, but he didn't. His cock's end poked me three times before I opened, they call it winked, my lips of horsey sex which helped his cock find the right spot.<br />
<br />
My head jolted up as his cock rammed in and down into my vagina. I felt....well no man could ever make me feel the way Pegasus did at that moment. He took away my agony, his male self made me feel as an equal part of him and we together were one!&quot;<br />
<br />
All this while Nancy sat quietly by listening and rubbing her own jeans with mutual sensual feelings. &quot;Didn't you feel some shame in doing it with a stallion?&quot; asked Nancy her eyes wide as the story continued onward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? I was an animal too, a mare, a horse, a piece of some person's property! No, I felt no shame in doing that out in the open air! Oh I wouldn't do it now, here as a girl again, its private and a private feeling I'd want to enjoy but not as some sideshow along the street! Yet as a horse those human morals are not there, no one stands there and points a finger or faults you for having sensual passions and showing those passions. I guess that's why horses or animals in general care little where to drop a load, on a sidewalk, in the street, they have no reason to care just the need to satisfy an urge, that all!<br />
<br />
Anyway, Pegasus' penis moved into me with roughness but as he began to pull back with smooth pelvic moves the feeling was so fulfilling. My vaginal muscles had something you and I don't but would be nice if we did, I could clamp down on his cock as it pulled back making the sensation all the more thrilling to us both.<br />
<br />
Pegasus raised his head high and whinnied aloud as the load of semen roared into me. It was like a hot spray of fire but with wonderful sensual tones no pain, no none at all! One, two, three, four times I felt a hard thrust of his semen into me. He tried to pull out his service done but I clamped down holding him tight.<br />
<br />
He whinnied and made a snuffling noise as if wondering and worried about what I was doing. To him and maybe in me there was some apprehsion for being locked together out in the wide open field. As in the animal world we were at those moments open to attack. Oh of course there weren't any pedators but Pegasus didn't know that, I did!<br />
<br />
A few seconds passed and I think he got my idea as he started thrusting again for round two. It was then his own mare came to the fenceline and whinnied for her mate. I suspect she noted the scents of two horses mating and wished for some of the same.<br />
<br />
I felt relieved from the tickled sensations as for an hour later my vagina felt he was still deep within me. The passion was gone and I fell asleep in my stall that night.<br />
<br />
The feeling of being in heat is the worst of all things when being a mare. I'd have to say a close second is boredom! Natural horses don't really get bored, not like a person does or would if placed in the same situation as a horse.<br />
<br />
Graze all morning, drink at noon, play a little, then find a tree to point your nose toward. The flies don't seem to bother you if your face is toward the tree trunk. Yet out back your tail is kept busy keeping those horseflies from litting and taking a bite. All kinds of bugs walk and cover your body. Ticks are bad and I would groom the others and they me for hours just wishing relief and for something to do!<br />
<br />
Now don't take me wrong, I liked having the adventure of being a filly, a mare, and having a rich sexual relationship as a horse! I appreciate your using the Medallion there in making me find a real joy in my life. It is and will be something I can look back on and grasp as a personal treasure!&quot; told Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I can't believe what all you did and the way if must have felt. I got changed into a female Mule but was it for such a short time the feelings of being an animal and a Jenette Mule didn't make any effect. What you've told me is just the wildest thing I've ever heard, heck why not who do I know ever spent time as a horse?&quot; said Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you gave me the Medallion, I'd change you!&quot; offered Tina.<br />
<br />
Nancy's eyes were wide open but suddenly about fell out of their sockets with surprise. She looked down and saw her fingers pressing against her crotch as a round wet stain told of her own sensual feelings.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... no I think I'd not wish to be a horse or mule, no thanks!&quot; said Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd just plain love it!&quot; said Tina as she reached over patting Nancy's hand still fingering her crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dare not, and you can't go with me to help me find those pleasures! One time as changed but the second time makes it permanant, I asked the Medallion for a copy of it's rules and once read it took them back into wherever?&quot; said Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know if I would go back if I really could? You say if I did go back to being a horse its permanant, forever?&quot; asked Tina now with a long face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could not be a horse and mare, but as a stallion or gelding I believe you might be able to do it again!&quot; told Nancy.<br />
<br />
Tina walked to her window overlooking the lakeshore and stood there thinking for several long minutes. Then she turned and smiled, &quot;I have an idea for us both!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; replied Nancy as she stood up.</p>
