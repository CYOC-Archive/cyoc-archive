<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As while you were watching that curious stallion you feel a hand resting on your left shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Wel”l, a jubilant voice responds “let&#39;s get you ready for the celebration”.<br />
<br />
“C ... celebration?” <br />
<br />
Carai nods with her long head<br />
<br />
“AHA. Tonight we are going to celebrate the return of the hunting party” his smile showed even more those teeth in form of blocks “and the arrival of the new member of our small tribe”.<br />
<br />
The new member,  You head is still spinning your with the events of this crazy day. Not only had you changed species and thrown into a different world from yours, now you were part of a community of anthropomorphic horses and apparently you were not the first to arrive.<br />
While you were brooding over those events, Carai dragged you around the village pointing out various places of interest as you passed them. But all that seemed to overlook you while you thought about that last question.<br />
<br />
If there were more &quot;people&quot; like you, had they also reached this village? And if so, would they know any way to return home? It was a question that had remained in the back of his brain until then but it was worth pondering all the options.<br />
<br />
Carai finally stops in front of a square building from which came a hot, wet steam. At the entrance there was  a sign with a series of symbols unknown to you. You remain restless and nervous before the entrance covered with a violet fabric in which was drawing of what could well have been a cloud.<br />
<br />
“Well, here we go”.<br />
<br />
A strong  hand push you hard from behind and with an exclamation, you enter the building. Upon entering you find square cubicles made of clay. in some of them there was still water. Apparently that place was a public shower. While you watched a white form stood before you. As you look over that figure you found the slender form of a humanoid mare with a silky white fur like a pearl and a mane and tail of a light yellow. Her mane forming a ponytail while her blond tail was braided carefully. And just like you she was completely naked.<br />
<br />
“Moookh, LA” she said with a smile on her equine face as she bowed.<br />
<br />
“eh”<br />
<br />
your face showed confusion as did the clear mare.<br />
<br />
“N&#39;gim.&#39;Nchiaaa” again, that strange language totally incomprehensible to you.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry but ...” you try to apologize to that stranger.<br />
<br />
“Ara, it&#39;s Shiv&#39;la” a more familiar voice resounded behind you as Acaria entered the room “the hunters found her in the last hunt”.<br />
<br />
“oh” the expression of the mare went from confusion to a strange restlessness. That expression barely lasted a few moments and was replaced with a new smile “s-ro, I&#39;m sorry” then she extended her right arm pointing to one of those bathtubs “ we had been warned of your arrival but we did not know that you had already woken up. You can use our services at any time and do not hesitate to ask for assistance if you need it”.<br />
<br />
“not ... I” doubts for a few seconds ” I&#39;ll be fine alone thanks” as you said this you do a little bow imitating the mare&#39;s gesture.<br />
<br />
“Nok” she answers “The bath will take about 5 minutes to fill up. You can wait back while it fills up”.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The water covered your entire body &quot;naked&quot; while the fur clung to your body, a white vapor rose to the ceiling which was curiously relaxing. A curious sound that sounded half snore half snorting came out of your new nostrils. With a slight blush you immerse your elongated face even more in the hot water.<br />
<br />
I will never be able to get used to this. It was difficult to adapt to her new body. While waiting for the bathtub to fill up you had time to look more closely at your new body thanks to certain mirrors made of a reflective metal that made mirrors in that place in the back of the hut. During those five minutes you had been able to notice new details that he had overlooked the first time you woke up in this new world.<br />
The first thing that caught your attention was your new body constitution. Any trace of excess of fat in your old body had been replaced by a smooth, muscular skin covered by a thin layer of chesnut fur. As you ran your hand over your enhanced bicep, you had the impression that you had spent half his life in the gym. <br />
<br />
The next thing had been your face and this part kept you more occupied  because it had changed the most, and even so it had retained a certain resemblance to your old human features. It was as if your face had merged with that of a horse. To start your neck despite being thicker than the previous one was more like a human being than an equine. Yournew &quot;mouth&quot; was a snout that fused with his nose but unlike that of a horse this was shorter and curiously allowed you to form expressions similar to those of your former self. By turning your face you could fix even more on your new equine features but it was the eyes that most attracted your attention. They were not those gigantic eyes with huge dark pupils used to see in equines, but the identical ones to your old self, or almost. The pupils were a bright green but with the addition of a golden ring that divided the inner and outer edges of the pupils.<br />
 <br />
While looking at that intense gold, you felt a movement on the top of your face. Your new, definitely equine ears, moved back and forth denoting the nervousness of his new owner. At that moment you lower your eyes to your chest And focus on your new addictions.<br />
That was the moment in which Ara, the clear mare, had chosen to enter to warn you that the bath was ready. You were  still red with embarrassment while you  remembered the mare&#39;s expression as she found you rubbing those huge masses of flesh.<br />
With a sigh, younarrowed your eyes, the only part  that could assure that it was still yours. And in that moment a feeling of melancholia wrapped inside and out. Suddenly causing the temperature to drop despite the hot water.<br />
<br />
I can not stay here, you decide. It&#39;s not just the change is everything else: your family, friends, a possible boyfriend, all your studies and temporary work, your cat Meechum ... in definitive: your life. you got up with a serious expression as water ran through your body.<br />
<br />
I have to find a way back.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The next place she takes you looks like a kind of jewelry. The anthro horse, a gray-haired stallion,  received you in the same way as Ara. After a short conversation with Carai he leaves you alone to contemplate his merchandise.<br />
 Hanging from the ceiling, tied with thin strings, hung pendants of different shapes and colors. And on a wooden table stretched several items that were reminiscent of the earrings worn by Acaria. Your look is directed to some earrings made specifically of onyx with an exquisite engraving in a language unknown to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve found something that interests you, Ab-la&quot;. Her gaze went to the dark earrings &quot; they are beautiful. I think you would look good with them tonight. She pick up one of the earrings and proceed to place it on your left ear. You feel some pressure against the lobe but it disappears right away. And by the sounds of excitement of your companion seemed to stay well.<br />
<br />
The truth is that this whole experience gave you some qualms. Not only because of the nudity, which would take long to get used to, it was the attention he received from the inhabitants of that town. I felt a certain sorrow and ... fear? Well, I could understand those feelings, basically because you had felt the same all day. In your old life you had been a shy person, not shy in the sense of hiding behind someone, but sometimes it felt as if it cost him to interact with new people and face the unexpected. To put it simply, this site was his personal nightmare.<br />
In  that moment a new individual entered the hut.<br />
<br />
“Moookh first-born, and Shiv&#39;la”the newcomer  bowed before you and handed a package to Carai.<br />
<br />
“Your mother sends you greetings and our new foal too. This was a request made by Ariel for our new addition to the tribe”.<br />
<br />
“Mkoooh, Arlo and thank you” Carai said picking up the package “Thank you”. The stranger nodded and left the hut.<br />
<br />
“¿Who was him?” you asked.<br />
<br />
“Arlo, one of the personal assistants of mother, Irin-la,  she is Nak, the leader of our town”.<br />
<br />
“Your mother is the leader of your people?”<br />
<br />
Carai&#39;s face darkened.<br />
<br />
“Yes, after the death of my father he took charge of his duties as leader during these last three years but this year, during the Sagittarius test, a new leader will be chosen from among the adults”.<br />
<br />
“mph” nodding while your eyes fixed on the range of expressions that crossed the face of your guide. It was at that moment when she seemed to leave her reverie and looking at the package, as if realizing that he had been holding it firmly all this time, after a few moments  she tends it to you.<br />
<br />
“this Is for you”.<br />
<br />
The contents of the package consisted of a series of fabrics joined by a thin strip of leather. The fabric was chestnut-colored like his new body. While you hold the two objects you wonder about its possible usefulness while Carai watch you amused.<br />
<br />
“As I told you, this is not the first time that one of you has arrived in our village. And from those experiences we have become accustomed to your strange habit of covering your… ¿intimate parts?“.<br />
<br />
You do not move for a few moments while your brain tries to analyze the new information. The moment the bulb is turned on the head. The heat emitted by your body could have opened a hole in the earth at that moment. Trying to forget the embarrassment of that situation you  put the contents when your eyes were diverted to a third article that was in the bottom of the package.<br />
<br />
It was a necklace of unknown origin. She was 100 percent sure that it did not belong to you. But still you felt some attraction towards it. The necklace  consisted of a string attached to two forms a sphere of a jet black joined to a triangle that seemed made of quartz.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s an ancient symbol” Carai looks to the article ”My mother told me that they found it around your neck.”<br />
<br />
“¿what?”<br />
<br />
“About 6 miles from here there is a series of old underground water channels that are now dry but formerly they supplied the tribes of the south. About 2 days ago our hunting group found you at the bottom of a chasm. They found you inconscious wearing   this necklace.<br />
You really did not remember anything of that. Neither the cave nor the ...<br />
<br />
It was like a pinprick behind your head. The images swirled in confused and shapeless ways. A dark shape is placed in front of you. A horse as dark as night and  the image of a black tree engulfed in flames.<br />
<br />
As it began the images vanished from your mind, returning you to reality. On your left, Carai was watching you with a worried expression on her face.<br />
<br />
This situation was getting more and more complicated.</p>
