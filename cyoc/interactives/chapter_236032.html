<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Time seemed to pass by just as normally after the battle with Casseus, Demeter, and Rick. Now there was just normal life to look forward to and two people in particular knew what they wanted in their future more than anything. Jackie had enough one day and decided there was no more beating around the bush about her relationship with Ann to Ann&#39;s parents and wanted to finally come forward about their situation. Needless to say, Jackie was holding onto her chest and taking a few deep breaths. She knew she could feel the anxiety kicking in her. Ann and Jackie were in their middle age forms with Stephanie sitting in the back of the car. Stephanie recognized Jackie&#39;s nervousness and held her hand as Jackie gently held it back.<br />
<br />
They arrived at Martin and Marilyn&#39;s house during the night so even if they were outside, no one might be able to see anything strange happening. All three of them got out of the car and proceeded onto the porch. Jackie tapped her foot still feeling unsure about all this, until Stephanie came over to her putting her hand on her arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, listen: if....if they don&#39;t accept you. You&#39;ll always going to be my other mom no matter what. Nothing and no one is ever going to change that.&quot; Stephanie said as Jackie smiled and gave her daughter a hug.<br />
<br />
Ann and Stephanie proceeded into the house where they greeted both Martin and Marilyn. Marilyn could tell her daughter looked nervous about something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. You look like you&#39;ve got something say dear, so go ahead and say it. Come out with it.&quot; Marilyn said crossing her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, you can come in now!&quot; Ann called out to the porch as Jackie slowly made her way inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...hey! I mean, no! That is, I mean to say....uh....good evening mister and missus O&#39;Toole, I&#39;m....I&#39;m Jackie Kirkman, and I love your daughter.&quot; Jackie said holding out her hand to the two of them as Marilyn seemed to raise her eyebrow at Jackie.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look awfully familiar. Have we met somewhere before dear?&quot; Marilyn asked with a quizzical look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...well....maybe...no....that is...to say...yes. I mean, Ann, a little help here?&quot; Jackie asked turning to her girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well mom, Jackie and I met....some....time ago. We both....got to know each other....very well....and she&#39;s....a really, really, really....&quot; Ann tried to say but began to sweat feeling intimidated by her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, for fucks sake moms!&quot; Stephanie shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;STEPHANIE!&quot; Ann and Jackie both said to her in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;ve had it with all this beating around the bush. Grandma, grandpa, listen to me: you know her because this is one of Gloria&#39;s friends: Jackie Kirkman. She uses her magic to age herself up into an adult or she ages your daughter down to her age for the two of them to hang out and....stuff. Jackie has been a great partner and friend to your daughter and me because....she&#39;s not just a woman I like. She&#39;s my other mom, at least on paper anyway. My full legal name now is Stephanie O&#39;Toole-Kirkman and these two, they&#39;re my parents, my moms, my inspirations.&quot; Stephanie said putting Jackie and Ann&#39;s hands together.<br />
<br />
Martin and Marilyn both looked very touched by this as Martin now spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, young lady, is everything our granddaughter here told us true?&quot; Martin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is sir. I love your daughter more than anything else in the world, and I&#39;ve been so grateful to help her raise Stephanie to...the best of my ability. Ann is my world, my....my angel.&quot; Jackie sighed as she looked into Ann&#39;s eyes with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh....&quot; Marilyn said as she now began crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, are you alright? Are...are you upset about all this? Oh, I should have known you wouldn&#39;t...&quot; Ann shook her head and turned away from her mother&#39;s view.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! That isn&#39;t it at all. Ann, I&#39;m....I&#39;m so happy for you, for all of you. I know I was always a bit hard on you and your sisters. I know I can a bit stubborn and hard headed and lord knows you and your sisters are terrified of what I might say, but I couldn&#39;t be happier. I....I never told you how proud I was of you. I always told you to be better, or be more assertive like your sisters, when I just wanted you to be yourself. Please, don&#39;t hate me for what I put you through.&quot; Marilyn said as she wiped a tear from her eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hate you? I could never hate you. You&#39;re my mother....all I ever wanted from you was just acceptance. Acceptance of myself. Accept who I am. I love men, and I love women, but I love Jackie most of all. Can you accept me for all that?&quot; Ann said as she also now began crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always accepted you Ann. I just want you to be happy.&quot; Marilyn said through her tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, mom!&quot; Ann said as she now cried happily and hugged her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...you...you both approve of her?&quot; Ann asked wiping her tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann, if she makes you happy, if she makes Stephanie happy, then I&#39;m happy for you both.&quot; Marilyn said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s wonderful to hear. But now, I wondered if I might have a little private talk with you two for a moment?&quot; Jackie asked as Martin and Marilyn looked at each other and nodded.<br />
<br />
Ann and Stephanie now stepped outside for a moment while Jackie remained inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. and Mrs. O&#39;Toole, I wanted to know if...&quot; Jackie began to ask. &quot;Deep breath Jackie....&quot; Jackie said to herself. &quot;May I have permission to marry your daughter?&quot; Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jackie, you have our permission and our blessing.&quot; Marilyn said as she held Jackie&#39;s hand and Martin held his hand on Jackie&#39;s shoulder and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you. I&#39;m going to ask her at my graduation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, may we come?&quot; Martin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...well, I don&#39;t really know about that. Angel! Can you come back in here!&quot; Jackie called out as Ann and Stephanie stepped back inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Angel, your parents want to come to my graduation. But I don&#39;t really see how that could be possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither do....oh no. Mom, dad, please tell me you&#39;re not going as...!&quot; Ann asked in a worry before Martin and Marilyn had transformed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am the Solar Guardian Mars!&quot; &quot;And I am the Solar Sentinel!&quot; Marilyn and Martin both exclaimed as the three watched them transform and become young warriors again. Ann looked a little embarrassed about this. It still was awkward to her knowing her parents could do this. The three now watched as they now morphed their uniforms into regular clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, grandma, I didn&#39;t know you could do that. Also that is a cute top you got on you.&quot; Stephanie complimented.<br />
<br />
&quot;This? Oh, thank you dear.&quot; Marilyn thanked with a smile. &quot;It&#39;s one of the advantages of these powers, I get to pick my own clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we don&#39;t want our granddaughter to miss Jackie&#39;s graduation, so you&#39;ll be hanging with us tomorrow.&quot; Martin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know Jackie&#39;s parents are probably unaware of magic, so you&#39;ll be with us as one of Ann&#39;s very attractive younger sister&#39;s friends.&quot; Marilyn said brushing her hair back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh mom really....&quot; Ann said shaking her head.<br />
<br />
Stephanie now talked with Marilyn and Martin about who would be showing up for graduation due to the situation Jackie&#39;s friends had found themselves in with the vampires. Jackie and Ann meanwhile went outside to sit on the porch and look up out at the night sky happy the night had gone well.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
The day finally came when Jackie Kirkman as well as a few others graduated early. Jackie&#39;s parents, Frank and Hannah were there, recording their daughter&#39;s great moment. Some of Jackie&#39;s friends also showed up like Gloria and Caleb, along with Diane and Naomi. Ann had also come in her younger age along with Martin and Marilyn and Stephanie and they all cheered when Jackie walked across the aisle. After the ceremony was over, everyone came up to congratulate her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darling, you finally did it!&quot; Ann said as she came up and hugged Jackie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, by the way, I think I almost dropped something with this whole gown on me. Hold on, let me look and see if I can find it.&quot; Jackie said she got on the ground and pretended to look through her gown before producing a beautiful ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann O&#39;Toole, you mean the world and everything to me. Will you marry me?&quot; Jackie asked holding up the ring to her as Ann almost looked like she was about to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Forever and eternity, yes!&quot; Ann exclaimed happily as Jackie put the ring on her finger.<br />
<br />
Ann & Jackie&#39;s now gave each other a passionate kiss on the lips as their friends and family took pictures. Frank and Hanna congratulated their daughter, as did Martin and Marilyn with Ann. Although Marilyn confessed to Ann that she was aware Jackie would be doing this and when she found out she gave her blessing for it, Ann was extremely happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;The day is almost here my angel, the day when you and I say our vows.&quot; Jackie said to Ann as she embraced her in a hug and Ann sighed placing her head on Jackie&#39;s shoulder.</p>
