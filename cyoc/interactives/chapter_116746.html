<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After climbed out of the pool, the pair of dirty toddlers waddled into the girl’s changing room together. Inside, Monica fished out her room key from the pocket of her pants, which she left with the rest of her unfitting clothes. She and Zachary then stepped out into the pool building’s lobby, with both children still wearing their dripping swimsuits, water wings and their heavy, stinking swim diapers. <br />
<br />
 “Hey!”. There was a single adult in a workman’s uniform, who was mopping the floor next to the wall. “You can’t go out there all like that. You gotta go back and wash up.”  <br />
<br />
“Aw. Okay!”, Zach happily replied, as he and Monica turned around. <br />
<br />
When they went back, the changing room seemed slightly different, though neither of the kids really put it to mind. They pulled off their water wings, stripped off their filthy swimsuits and diapers, and left them on one of the changing room benches. Zach and Monica giggled at the sight of each other’s nakedness. Neither of them was bothered by the brown smears covering their butts or the reduced size of their genitals.<br />
<br />
“You have a weird pee-pee,” Zach remarked, pointing at Monica’s prepubescent vagina. <br />
<br />
“Duh, because I’m a girl! Girls don’t have weiners,” Monica replied, with her hands on her hips in mock seriousness. They both giggled, and stepped into the closest shower and pulled the curtain. <br />
<br />
Zach reached his hands up to the hot water knob on the wall. Was it always this high up? It’s pretty hard for a little boy his size to reach. <br />
He didn’t turn the knob. Something was screaming in the back of Zach’s mind that this was not normal. In fact, it was all terribly wrong, and if he actually realized what was wrong with this situation he&#39;d be letting out a bloodcurdling scream now. <br />
<br />
Zach crinkled his nose. Why wasn’t he even bothered by the smell? <br />
<br />
“Zachie?”<br />
<br />
Zach flitched, as if he had just woken from a daydream. Monica was looking puzzled.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry.” he replied. He twisted the knob, and water sprinkled down from the shower tap overhead. The two children hopped and playfully shrieked as the icy water hit their skin. Zach quickly adjusted the hot water knob, and the water shifted to a nice, lukewarm temperature. <br />
<br />
Zach pumped some liquid soap from a nearby tray. As he rubbed it around his chest, Zach noticed that his little penis was starting to swell and go erect. <br />
<br />
 “It’s going pointy!”, exclaimed Monica, as Zach’s cheeks flushed. “Why is it going pointy?”<br />
<br />
“I-I don’t know,” he uttered. “Maybe it’s excited…”<br />
<br />
“Wow…”<br />
<br />
Monica reached out a finger towards the bobbing pecker. Zach didn’t bother to stop her. <br />
<br />
The moment Monica’s fingers touched the tip, Zach shivered and gave a squeal. He put his hands together as Monica continued to happily fondle his privates. <br />
<br />
There were a pair of voices coming from the changing room, from behind the curtain. Both were high pitched and boyish, but sounded older than Zach.<br />
<br />
“What’s that smell?”<br />
<br />
“Ewwww! Someone pooped in their swim pants!” <br />
<br />
Zach’s face lit up in recognition. Peeking through the shower curtains, Zach saw his friends Jeremy and Michael backing away from the abandoned swimwear like it was some toxic waste. It occurred to Zach that he and Monica actually went to the boy’s changing room to shower. <br />
<br />
“I knew I smelled something weird in the pool!”, Jeremy exclaimed, as the 13 year old’s face scrunched up. Jeremy saw Zach peeking from the shower.<br />
<br />
“Hey, are those your pants?!?” Jeremy exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Jeremy, it’s me! Zach!”<br />
<br />
“Huh?”<br />
<br />
“It’s me!”, Zach said again, with a toothy grin. “You’re Jeremy and Michael, and I’m Zach!”<br />
<br />
The two older boys were silent. Jeremy squinted.<br />
<br />
“Zach?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, no, you’re definitely not Zach,”  Michael replied. “Zach is waaay older than you are,” <br />
<br />
“But I <i>am</i> Zach!”, the little boy affirmed, as Monica poked her head through the shower curtain as well. <br />
<br />
“Whoa!”. Michael quickly glanced away, thinking he’d accidentally see more of the little girl than needed. <br />
<br />
“Hey, are you Zachy’s friends?”, Monica asked.<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah. And this is a boy’s bathroom!”, said Jeremy. The boy didn’t realize that when he said those words, his voice had raised a few pitches higher than normal. He and Michael also failed to notice the room around them growing slightly larger by the second, while all early signs of puberty had disappeared from their bodies. <br />
<br />
“So? What are you gonna do about it?”, quipped Monica. <br />
<br />
“Wanna shower with us?”, Zach asked. <br />
<br />
“…uh, I don’t know…”, Jeremy uttered, as he shared a look with Michael.<br />
<br />
Through the whole conversation, Jeremy and Michael’s voices were getting higher and higher. And both 13-year olds had shrunk so much they were reaching the same height as Zach and Monica, with their swimpants shrinking along with them. <br />
<br />
 “Come on, shower with us!” <br />
<br />
“It’ll be fun!” said Monica. <br />
<br />
Eventually, with none of the children even noticing anything different, both Jeremy and Michael had reached the same ages as Monica and Zach, with their swimshorts also completing their changes to fit their new bodies. Something in the two boys’ minds seemed to click, as if all their past worries and concerns from a minute ago were drained out of their bodies. <br />
<br />
“Okay!” both Jeremy and Michael chirped. Together, the now-younger boys pulled down their swim shorts and exposed the little worms between their legs, which both twitched and raised their tips up at the boys’ sight of Monica’s nakedness. <br />
<br />
“Heehee, they’re going pointy too!”, said Monica, giggling as Jeremy and Michael blushed. The two boys stepped into the shower, and washed their bodies alongside Zach and their new friend. <br />
<br />
While he continued to scrub himself, Zach felt an odd stream of warm water hitting his hips, which was accompanied by a very interesting smell. <br />
<br />
Zach turned, and saw that it was a stream of urine coming right out of Michael, who was aiming his pecker like a tiny hose. <br />
<br />
The other children laughed and screamed as they jumped back, but Michael gave a triumphant grin as he managed to hit all three of them. <br />
“Haha, that’s so gross!”, Zach exclaimed, even as he was still washing a bit of shit off from his lower body. Michael’s pee eventually shrank to a trickle, but just when Michael started feeling pleased with himself, he gave a yelp as he himself was splashed by a golden trickle from Jeremy. Zach and Monica joined in too (with Monica only managing to pee on Michael’s legs and feet), and soon the other kids were shooting piss all on Michael.<br />
<br />
The children spend a few more minutes of fun in the shower, washing up and fondling each other’s privates (The boys had fun ‘sword fighting’ with their erect dicks, and prodding the tips against Monica). After a while, Zach turned down the water, and the four shivering kids stepped out into the still-empty changing room. <br />
<br />
“So, what do we do now?”, Jeremy asked, as the four dried themselves with some nearby towels. “<br />
<br />
“Wanna come into my room to play?”, said Monica. <br />
<br />
“Maybe later. I want to go exploring!”, Zach quipped.<br />
<br />
“I think they said there’s a funhouse somewhere near the beach,” Michael added. “Maybe it could be cool!”<br />
<br />
The kids eventually made a decision. Together, the four kids stepped out of the changing room and the pool building completely naked, with nothing in their minds but the search for more fun.</p>
