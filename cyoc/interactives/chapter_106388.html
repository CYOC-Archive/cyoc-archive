<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just before classes let out, the skies opened up and rain begins to fall. Since Moon Lake is located in the state of Washington, nestled a few hours from Seattle on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains; it stands to reason that a heavy downpour would hit around the waning days of summer. Seeing the rain from the safety of his classroom, Eric knew that his planned after school fun time with Spencer in the woods would have to wait. Shortly after lunch, Eric managed to send a text message informing Spencer that playing ditch day would have wait. Explaining the situation earned him a crying emoticon from Spencer.<br />
<br />
Everyone who was waiting for a ride home was crammed into the school vestibule closest to the morning drop off point. No one dared to go outside unless their ride showed up. Eric, Spencer and Frieda were together. They were silent as most of everyone else, but for mainly different reasons. Shortly before school let out the Principal paged Frieda to the office to tell her that while he will respect Frieda’s request not to call child services, he has however informed the guidance counselor of her situation and requests that she avail herself of his services when needed.<br />
<br />
Slowly but surely the cars lined up closet to the entrance everyone was at; the students slowly trickled out into the unending downpour. The one exception to the silence being broken, was Alyssa Cooper showing up to pick up Brian Walker; many wolf whistles came from the boys near him as they all saw the hot were-mer come to claim her were-otter for another night of lust and fun. Evan Eric Spencer and Frieda managed to get a good look at her, yet none recognized her as one of the many thorns plaguing the Stovall’s.<br />
<br />
It was not long after that Frieda’s ride came. True enough, it was her mother behind the wheel of a Mercedes. Biding Eric and Spencer a quick goodbye she dashes out into the rain and into the car of her mother. Both Spencer and Eric see them drive off, each silently wishing Frieda a safe ride home. Shortly after Spencer’s grandfather pulls up and both Eric and Spencer make a mad dash through the rain.<br />
“It’s really coming down,” Mike Lawson comments; “but that’s to be expected when you live in the Pacific Northwest. How was your day Spencer?”<br />
“Okay,” She replies. “Kind of bummed out with the weather,” she continues. “Had planned an after school romp with Eric here.”<br />
<br />
Mike just grinned he knew exactly what Spencer had in mind the moment he saw his granddaughter in such a racy attire. You mind continuing your story dear?” He adds.<br />
“Really with Eric here?” Spencer blushes.<br />
“He can help fill in the embarrassing bits,” Mike grins.<br />
“Really grandpa,” Spencer admonishes; “You are a nothing more than a horny old man.”<br />
Mike just laughs as he slowly drives in the heavy downpour. Spencer realizes she made a promise to fill him in on the way home picks up where she left off after being dropped off. She recounts that after Julie was arrested for attacking Eric and Frieda; all three head to the Knight estate to induct Eric into the were society.<br />
<br />
Eric coughs as Spencer is about to get to the naughty parts. Mike just laughs at the potential embarrassment but lets Spencer continue. She recounts that after the whole induction, the Knights found out what happened shortly after being informed that Frieda was required to testify against Julie at her upcoming trial.<br />
“And that would explain her being grounded for two months?” Mike Lawson asks.<br />
“That as well as admitting to being Bisexual,” Spencer replies. She knew there was more; Frieda scuttling Benton’s takeover of Tachibana possibly being the other but decides not to tell her grandfather for the time being.<br />
“So Eric,” Mike asks; “How do you like being a were-panther?”<br />
“Won’t lie, the sex is great.” Eric responds.<br />
Mike laughs, “It gets better as you get older kid.” But getting serious, “Just remember it’s far easier for a female were to get pregnant then a normal.” Looking at Spencer in the rearview, “You have been taking your were-birth control?”<br />
“Grandpa!” Spencer embarrassed at the question. Fortunately for Spencer, she doesn’t have to answer for they arrive at the Lawson residence and all three dash out of the car and into the house.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
Frieda’s ride was not as embarrassing for her as it was for Eric. It was just uncomfortably silent. Frieda deciding that the awkward silence must end starts talking first.<br />
“Is dad still tearing up the place?” Frieda asks.<br />
“How do you know?” Amanda responds.<br />
“A servant texted me before they all walked out,” Frieda answers. “Is it true did dad hit Jeffery?”<br />
Amanda sighs, “Yes. Although I doubt he realizes it yet.” Amanda continues, “He was so upset and drunk by the time I left that I doubt he knows that all the servants left.”<br />
“It will be a rude awakening by the time he sobers up, or calms down;” Frieda comments.<br />
“Or both,” Amanda adds. Deciding to change the subject; Amanda remarks, “Those two people you were with when I picked you up; Where they Eric Anderson and Spencer Lawson?”<br />
“Yes,” Frieda answers.<br />
“They don’t look to bad looking,” Amada comments.<br />
“You mean for those of the ‘blue collar’ society,” Frieda quoting blue collar.<br />
“I didn’t mean it that way, Frieda;” Amanda responds. “And I did mean it this morning when I was proud you made friends.”<br />
“Yet I’m grounded,” Frieda comments.<br />
“That is not the reason. It’s the way you acted in our own home. Sex with complete strangers; while your father and I may have been absent most of your childhood, I would like to think we raised to at least to not be... easy.”<br />
“You mean slutty? Or where you trying to find a polite word for tramp?” Frieda starting to get lippy.<br />
“Frieda,” Amanda sighs. “Can we not have this argument?”<br />
“Well you’re the one who brought it up?” Frieda huffs.<br />
<br />
The rest of the car ride home passes in silence. The only noise emanating from the sound of the rain hitting the car as it is in motion. Fortunately for Frieda the quiet ride soon ends as her mother pulls into the garage; parking her car next to Benton ostentatious Lamborghini. As both get out Amanda heads to Benton’s study to see him passed out in a room completely trashed. Frieda seeing her father in his state only shakes her head, “and I’m the one getting punished;” she quips.<br />
“Your father is going to be made to regret his actions come morning Frieda,” Amada comments as she closes the door.<br />
“Do you know what put him in such a state?” Frieda asks as both head to the kitchen.<br />
“All your father said between drinking, swearing and destroying everything not nailed down was; Daisuke, dam were-foxes and something about being denied revenge.”<br />
<br />
Frieda just sighs. Walking in the home devoid of servants was an eerie affair; Made more ominous by the rainstorm. As she enters the kitchen, Frieda’s mother pulls out the pizza she had in the oven prior to picking her up from school. As they eat the first slice the power goes out. Seconds later the emergency generator kicks in and the house is once again illuminated. <br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the whole town lost power,&quot; Amanda remarks.<br />
Both eat in silence as the rain continues to fall; Thunder could be heard in the distance.</p>
