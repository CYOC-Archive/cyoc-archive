<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave gives it a few minutes to think it out, your clearly being driven delirious from something about the magic in that painting, but... he does know that you always have had that strange fetish for wanting to be 2D... He did after all invite you here to see what would happen if you went all the way into the painting but on the other hand... What IF you can&#39;t be popped free? What happens if you can&#39;t move in there? What if you sink in all the way and turn into a REAL painting? Dave&#39;s worries begin outweigh your wants and desires. Dave looks over at you again and your face is is twisting pleasurably and look like your about to cum...<br />
&quot;Dude, I&#39;m pulling you out of there... I should have never- Oh my god....&quot;<br />
Dave&#39;s words are instantly interrupted as you instantly feel all the tension in your still 3D body suddenly give way as you creme yourself nearly instantly and you let out a deep loud moan of raw pleasure.<br />
Dave then begins to rush over to you, &quot;Okay... your coming out of there right now--- oh no...&quot;<br />
Dave stops dead in his tracks as he instantly realities that your not just creaming, your sinking! The ends of your hair are instantly beginning to get sucked into the painting with the back of your head and your torso pulls itself straight so that every part of the back of your upper body is attached to the hungry painting. Your body feels like its slithering and melting at the same time before experiencing extreme pleasure and ecstasy caused from your increasing flattening.<br />
Dave then rushes over to you, &quot;No no no no no no no, don&#39;t you be sinking into the painting... I need you out of that thing, right now, right now!&quot; Dave then tries to grab your leg but is instantly shocked as it feels slick and rubbery and your thighs just slide through his fingertips easily as your upper body is deforming slightly as to make room for your legs to be drawn into the painting. Your upper arms and neck are the first to seem to be almost completely flattened into the canvas and your pelvis seems to be next if you keep sinking. You feel like your wiggling your arms and legs as if being shifted up then gasp again as the back of your legs make contact with the canvas and then too get sucked into your painting.<br />
Dave is panicking now, &quot;Fuck, fuck, what do I do? I can&#39;t grab him or I&#39;ll knock over the easel! FUCK what do I do? Dude, can you even hear me? Your sinking into the painting!&quot;<br />
You pleasantly moan and wiggle yourself more as you pelvis, upper arms and neck are now 2D, your torso seems next on the list as well as your lower arms, shoulders and hands. You moan out a long deep &quot;I know... It&#39;s... everything I&#39;ve been wanting~&quot;<br />
Your thighs are then quickly consumed into the canvas as your knees and shins are next to make contact. You look like you would almost fit perfectly into the painting if you get completely sucked inside. Dave continues to watch in horror as his friend becomes increasingly 2D inside his magic canvas painting. Your torso is now completely 2D as are your arms and upper legs. Your face is still there but the rest of your head is completely trapped in the painting. You only have a couple of moments now before you are completely trapped inside as your feet now make contact with the bottom of the canvas and are already starting to get sucked inside. Your whole body feels like its being squeezed flat like its deflating and then being stuck to a wall or something, your almost completely 2D and every part of you in the painting is tingling and feels so satisfyingly flat and gooey, like your orgasmic energy is being sucked right out of you and into the painting.<br />
<br />
Dave can do nothing as he watches the last of your body flatten as your feet, hands and face sink inside the canvas completely. Your painted face now stuck in an expression of complete ecstasy, your completely 2D. Your back and front of your body feel like they have nothing in between, or more like they are one and the same. You can&#39;t even feel the clothes your wearing, or more or less, painted on to be wearing anymore, but rather that you just know that they are there on your body. Every part of you is extremely sexually charged with a feeling of orgasmic release and an all enveloping sense of comforting that comes with being flattened completely. As if your smushed in a vacbed but theres nothing holding the two sheets up in between, as if your completely composed of that flattening, deflating, satisfying feeling of just sucking yourself onto something until you are flattened into nothing but a picture of your former self, just now in 2D. In addition to this, you feel as if you are wet and oily, like someone lathered you up with lube and it penetrated and became your body. You feel wet and flat, and it is oh so sexually satisfying to have this feeling become you completely. <br />
<br />
Dave then goes over to touch your painting to see if you will react at all. You feel it, its warm and very stimulating as his fingers and palm run across your painted body. To Dave, you don&#39;t have the same chalky feel to you as the other items did, more so you feel like you are smooth, solid and oily. He feels nothing but the paint of your body on top of the canvas underneath, theirs nothing else to your being. Dave then falls over backwards and screams as he sees your painted body quiver to his touch as if you felt something touch you sexually but Dave feels nothing moving under his hand within the painting. He can clearly see your moaning inside the painting to his touching but no sound is coming out of your body, as if your just a moving picture!<br />
&quot;Oh thank god you can move in there! I was afraid you were going to stay that way! Dude, can you hear me? Wave your hand if you can hear me? make a motion, move around, show me that you can hear me!&quot; <br />
Much to Dave&#39;s surprise, you absolutely can hear him, though a bit muffled as if talking through a pillow, you can hear his voice. You relax and take a more normal pose inside of the painting and look at him then nod your head. &quot;Yeah dude! I totally can hear you, but your a bit muffled for me.&quot;<br />
Dave then looks up at your 2D painted face and sees you nod but then silently start talking to him. He can clearly see that your mouth is moving but your saying nothing! &quot;Dude, your fucking silent! I can&#39;t hear anything that your saying!&quot;<br />
You then stop moving and almost bend over a bit excitedly, &quot;Oh crap really!? You can&#39;t hear me!? That&#39;s fucking crazy! It&#39;s just like I&#39;m a real painting! I can&#39;t feel any depth to my body and it feels fucking amazing!&quot; You then reach around with your hands as if your &quot;exploring&quot; your 2D body. &quot;Dude, I feel like I&#39;m touching myself but it feels at the same time it&#39;s like I&#39;m not touching anything! This is fucking crazy, I&#39;m 2D!<br />
Dave then looks up at you, you can clearly hear him but he can&#39;t hear you at all. &quot;Dude, I seriously can&#39;t hear you... what are you doing?&quot;<br />
You look at Dave then excitedly say &quot;Hey, hey, how does the back of me look in 2D? I&#39;ma try turning around and you tell me if you can see anything!&quot; You then begin to turn yourself around but your vision gets strange as you do, as the world outside of the canvas seems to just slide off of the horizon and all you can see is just blank canvas envelop your vision completely but then you begin to see the other side of your canvas your on as your vision wraps around yourself and back onto your painting, like your seeing yourself in 3rd person but all you can see is your own painting. &quot;Oh sweet! I can see my own backside!&quot; You say happily as you start coping a feel of your own buttocks and legs and lower back evenly. &quot;It really does feel my skin touching but it really does feel like there&#39;s nothing there to grab I think Im&#39;a give myself a squeeze!&quot; You try to grab your buttocks with your hands and you then tense up and jolt as you feel your buttock get squeezed but feel like they are being squeezed by nothing and your hands feel like they are stimulated like they are grabbing something but are squeezing nothing. &quot;This is so fucking cool! I think I like being 2D!&quot; You say as you happily start to turn around and your vision fazes from seeing yourself to nothing but canvas before wrapping back around again and returning you to your window view into the real world. &quot;Fuck man I think i want to STAY 2D! This is so fucking great I feel like I could stay in here for eternity!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave is looking at you shocked, even though he can&#39;t hear you, your painted lips moving and your expression are telling him that your not going to leave the painting willingly. Just then you and Dave hear the doorbell ring followed by some knocking. You hear a very muffled voice but Dave clearly hears &quot;Pizza Delivery!&quot;. Dave gets up in a hurry, &quot;Crap, crap, crap... I need you to act like your a painting and stop moving for a second, I need to deal with the Pizza guy, you stay there. Fuck!&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave then rushes over to the door as you ponder what you just heard. &quot;Did he just tell me to stop moving? Umm, okay...&quot; You then decide to take a pose you would feel comfortable in inside of your blank canvas scene and just stop moving. Strangely the sensation of not moving is even more satisfying than it is for you to be moving as you feel an orgasmically charged energy start to fill your flat 2D body almost like your body is stiffening like an erection forming and its making you want to keep not moving, which makes you feel even more orgasmic the longer you stop moving.<br />
<br />
Dave looks back at you and want for you to finish posing then after a few seconds pass of you not moving at all he opens the door. &quot;Hey man, did you order a pizza?&quot; Dave takes the pizza. &quot;yeah I ordered one. hey, can you hold on for one minute, I forgot my wallet.&quot; <br />
&quot;Sure thing man, do you have somewhere you want me to set this down?&quot; The pizza guy says. &quot;Uh sure, set it next to that painting over there.&quot; Dave says as he is grabbing his wallet. &quot;So how much do I owe ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
As the pizza guy sets the pizza next to your painting, the smell is extremely temping to your 2D nose. Not only are you extra sensitive to its smell, but you remember that you haven&#39;t eaten anything since this morning, you went straight to Dave&#39;s place right after work so you are pretty hungry. You more or less instinctively start moving out of your pose and turn around to face the pizza, however your strange 180 degree vision makes you see nothing but canvas in the direction of the pizza and as you start moving toward it you suddenly stop as you run into the edge of the canvas. You you freeze suddenly with a slight &quot;eepp!&quot; and stop moving as you hear someone scream and fall over as Dave yells &quot;God damn it I told you not to move!&quot; Dave then turns to the startled pizza guy who is staring straight at the painting next to him that just came to life and tried to grab his pizza before bumping into the edge of its scene. &quot;Dude, I am so sorry! here, take my money and just leave the food there. And... never tell anyone about what you just saw.&quot; Dave then tosses all the cash in his wallet at the pizza guy who then looks at it before seeing a few bungees mixed in with some fives, ones and a bunch of 20s before just nodding and scuttles out of the house. <br />
<br />
Dave then turns to you. &quot;If you let other people know your alive in there your going to cause a panic! Most people don&#39;t think magic exists and your a living painting. You&#39;ll freak people out man!&quot; You start moving again and turn to face Dave. &quot;Well sorry, I haven&#39;t eaten since morning...&quot; Dave frustratingly shakes his head before turning to face you again. &quot;Dude... just come out of the painting. I can&#39;t give you any food while your in there.&quot; You blink with a puzzled look, &quot;Why? I got in here just fine...&quot; Dave looks at you as if he kinda knew what you were saying. &quot;Once somethings inside there nothing else will go in. I can draw, edit, add to or erase your painting but I can&#39;t add any more real objects to it once something is inside the canvas. Now are you going to come out?&quot;<br />
<br />
You think on what he just said, &quot;You can edit me?&quot; but what really bothers you was the word &quot;erase&quot;, which makes you feel a deep dread feeling to think about that. You then blink twice and then look back at Dave who is diving into a slice of pizza and glaring at you. &quot;Mmmmm, yummy pizza. You can&#39;t have any till you agree to come out. If you don&#39;t ill eat your half too.&quot; <br />
<br />
You look back at Dave and then decide to ask, &quot;Hey Dave, you said you can edit me? Can&#39;t you paint me a pizza to eat?&quot; Dave just stares at you. &quot;I can&#39;t hear you dude...&quot; You pause before realizing he really can&#39;t hear you. You then decide to play sherades, making the motions of pointing at him, then at you, then making a motion as if using a paint brush before making the hand and facial motions of asking for confirmation all while repeating what you said.&quot; Dave realizes what you asked and says, &quot;Yeah, i can edit your painting. Why do you want me to?&quot; You then nod your head and point to the pizza you can smell and make the motion with your hand towards the &quot;ground&quot; as if drawing a circle before making the motions with your hands like you are eating something. &quot;So you want me to paint you a pizza to eat?&quot; Dave asks bluntly. You nod. &quot;Will you come out first?&quot; You then make the motions as if to say &quot;maybe...&quot;. <br />
<br />
Dave shakes his head and looks back at you before sighing. Clearly you don&#39;t want to leave your magic painting but he knows he needs to get you out of there somehow. Dave sits and thinks for a while, still munching on a slice of pepperoni while you lick your lips at him and sniff the non-existent air inside of your scene. Dave then sighs again. &quot;What am I going to do with you?&quot;</p>
