<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Justin pulled up the age screen once more. &quot;Hmm... I still want to try being the older brother for once. Maybe I'll be a little more careful. We'll just switch ages this time.&quot; He said, and chose his brother and himself as the subjects. Then he clicked a box marked &quot;swap ages.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was just about to press enter when he heard a voice calling him from downstairs--it was his mom.<br />
&quot;Damnit. Okay mom, I'll be right down!&quot; he yelled, and, cursing, left the computer to go find out what his mother wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, bro, have you seen my--&quot; Ben said, coming into the room, but stopped when he saw that Justin was gone. &quot;Huh, he was just playing on the computer a minute ago. What's this? Switch ages?&quot; He leaned his well built body over the computer, putting his hand on the desk without looking, and accidentally put it on the keyboard, hitting the enter button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah--what's going on?!&quot; He said, a strange tingling sensation taking over. &quot;This is strange...&quot;<br />
<br />
Unrealizing, Ben was getting younger. He still retained his buff appearance, but his face took on a younger look and the amount of hair on his body lessened a bit. In a moment, he looked nothing short of a God, so young and so well built and handsome. But he was completely oblivious to the changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neat, I get it. It's some kind of fantasy program. You can make pretend changes to yourself.&quot; He settled down to make some further changes.<br />
<br />
**********************************<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Justin was talking to his mom about taking out the trash when he suddenly felt a strange sensation. He grew a little taller, and he suddenly felt hair sprouting all over his body, including on his face.<br />
<br />
Shit, he thought. The cat must've jumped on the keys or something.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and I need you to run to the store. We're out of milk and beer.&quot; His mom concluded.<br />
<br />
This proves it, he thought. Well, I don't want to seem suspicious... oh well, I'll fix it later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
********************************<br />
<br />
Ben was having a blast with this program. He messed with the program's many options, making up a new life for his new supposed 18 year old self and his brother's new 24 year old life. It was fun to think about what it would be like if they had different lives.<br />
<br />
Since his teenaged years had been hell (he'd been an athlete who was somewhat tortured for being openly gay), he first decided that he was the captain of the football team and the most desired and popular guy in school even though he was openly gay. He then made half the guys in school either gay or bisexual, and upped his sex appeal and pheremone levels. Then, thinking about his current status as unemployed, he decided to make himself really smart and a good student as well. He added all kinds of changes, making himself a great athlete, musician, dancer, and all the sorts of fantasies he'd entertained in highschool (unaware he was slightly influenced by his previous life). He also gave himself those qualities that all gay guys seemed to think desirable, such as a great fashion sense and having amazing stamina.<br />
<br />
As for Justin, he decided that Justin was a very successful business man on the rise to a great career at a great company. He was dating a beautiful girl, and he was one of the sweetest gentlemen in town, well liked and successful. He might even have a career as a politician.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Ben heard a car in the driveway. It must have been Justin, coming back from wherever he had gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's a fun fantasy...&quot; Ben said, sitting back and admiring his work. &quot;...but it's not like it could actually happen.&quot; He said. &quot;Well, I'll just save it and then leave it so Justin doesn't know I messed with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
A window popped up. &quot;Would you really like to save?&quot; it said. Ben was about to press YES when Justin burst into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ben, what are you doing?! Don't press anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just messing around bro', I'm sorry. I won't touch it again.&quot; Ben pulled his hands away.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't even know what you could have done...&quot; Justin said. But just as he had opened the door the cat had run into the room, and now jumped on the desk  to get Justin's attention. The cat accidentally jumped on the side of the keyboard, knocking the enter key. The screen blipped and then read NOW SAVING...<br />
<br />
Both Justin and Ben froze, and a wave of energy passed through them both. When it was finished, Justin was standing a little taller in the door frame and he had a sweet smile on his face. He was wearing an expensive tailor made suit, and he looked very happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;So aren't you going to come meet my fiancee?&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
Scruffy but adorable Ben looked up from the computer, embarrassed. Justin was home early. He was wearing a cut-off abercrombie and fitch shirt and had short, spiked, dyed blonde hair. He was stunning in his athletic gay boy appearance. He smiled, closing down AIM. He'd been talking to a bunch of buddies from school, trying to decide which of them to take on a date tonight.<br />
<br />
&quot;O'course, just a moment.&quot; Justin headed downstairs just as Ben stood up, adjusting himself. There was time for that later. The program was forgotten on the computer. He had to meet his brother's new girlfriend.</p>
