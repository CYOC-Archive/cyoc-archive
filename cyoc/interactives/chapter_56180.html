<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think I'll go with Elizabeth,&quot; the newly christened Elizabeth said to herself admiring <br />
her new voice. She was so excited that she almost didn't notice that she had to pee. <br />
Laughing she sat down on the toilet and marveled at the feel of peeing from between <br />
her legs. She remembered to wipe when she was done and as she was washing her <br />
hands she heard a low growl from the apartment above her. This confused her since <br />
she hadn't heard anything like that from that apartment before. She had her hand on <br />
the doorknob before remembering that all she was wearing was a pajama top. She <br />
heard a crash above her like a door was broken down. Then came the screams and <br />
the sound of running and more crashing. There was another scream which ended <br />
suddenly and was proceeded by a low, menacing bark.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth drew back from her door afraid of what she might find out in the hall. She <br />
could still hear what she thought of as a very big dog and it sounded like it was on the <br />
first floor now. She grabbed her car keys and bolted out the patio door when she <br />
heard the creature right outside her apartment door.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth ran around to the front of the apartments to get to her car only to stop at the <br />
corner. There standing in the parking lot and smashing cars was a dragon. It was <br />
easily as tall as the two story apartment buildings and about as wide as one of the <br />
apartments. It's scales were jet black and it's eyes were blood red. It had two large <br />
ivory horns on top of it's head and a row of ridges down it's back to the tip of it's tail. <br />
It's face was long and pointed with a small beak like protuberance at the end of it's <br />
mouth. It's claws were ivory and looked like they could tear someone in half with one <br />
swipe. It would periodically flex it's wings and reveal the tough leathery skin covering <br />
them. As she watched it lunged at Debra and swallowed her whole.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth swallowed hard and carefully made her way to the back of the apartment <br />
building. Checking around the corner and not seeing another creature she headed to <br />
the woods behind the apartments. She hadn't seen many people and she wanted to <br />
help them but she knew she couldn't do anything with no weapons. The only thing she <br />
could do was to escape and alert the authorities about what was happening. Hopefully <br />
they would believe her and there weren't more surprises in store for her.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth walked along a path in the dark woods looking all around her sure that <br />
something was going to jump out and devour her at any moment. Her feet were cut <br />
and bleeding though she kept walking not daring to stop until she came to a house. <br />
After walking for about an hour she came upon a clearing with a little cottage in the <br />
middle. She breathed a sigh of relief and ran up and knocked on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello dearie,&quot; a creaky voice said behind Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth whirled around to see an old woman wearing a black robe, black cape, black <br />
pointed hat, and black shoes. Given what she had seen so far she made the <br />
assumption that this old lady was a with. The witch also had a five year old boy <br />
clutched in her hand who was struggling to get away. &quot;What are you doing with that <br />
boy?&quot; she asked trying to sound braver than she felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll tell you once you put these bracelets on dearie,&quot; the witch said producing a couple <br />
of bracelets from somewhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what makes you think I'll put them one?&quot; Elizabeth asked backing up into the <br />
door.<br />
<br />
The witch sighed and said, &quot;I had hoped you would put them on yourself.&quot; She raised <br />
the bracelets and said, &quot;Befestigen Sie das M&auml;dchen an den Handgelenken.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bracelets glowed then flew at Elizabeth and put themselves around her wrists. <br />
&quot;What is this?&quot; she asked trying to get the bracelets off without any success.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're now my apprentice,&quot; the witch said cackling. &quot;Now take this boy into our <br />
cottage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going do with him, eat him?&quot; Elizabeth asked. The last part was said in <br />
jest.<br />
<br />
The witch smiled and said, &quot;That is what I'm going to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; the boy cried and doubled his efforts to get away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't help you,&quot; Elizabeth said and charged at the witch meaning to tackle her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zur H&ouml;he von achtzig Zentimeter,&quot; the witch said waving her hand.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth's lunge stopped as her arms were pulled above her head and she was lifted <br />
off the ground a bit. &quot;What's going on?&quot; she asked kicking her feet trying to get down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just levitated you a bit to stop you're attack,&quot; the witch said with a wicked smile. &quot;You <br />
see those bracelets are now attached to your wrists. When I tell them to be at a <br />
specific height they'll pull your arms up and then the rest of your body will follow if they <br />
haven't reached the correct height. I could suspend you above the trees if I so desire. <br />
Now to get inside. Folgen Sie mir.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the witch's words The bracelets pulled Elizabeth behind her and she followed her <br />
into the cottage. Once inside she asked, &quot;What are you going to do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already told you that you're my apprentice now,&quot; the witch said looking over her <br />
shoulder. &quot;You're in the right spot now.&nbsp;Ende letzten Zauber.&quot; The witch went over to a <br />
wall and raising the boy's hands up to a pair of shackles said, &quot;Binden Sie diesen <br />
Jungen.&quot; The shackles came to life and clamped shut on the boy's wrists. The witch <br />
picked up a wicked looking knife and started to cut the boy's clothes off while he <br />
begged for his life.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth kept struggling to free herself and said, &quot;You harm that boy and I'll kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't make threats you can't keep dearie,&quot; the witch said then cackled. She finished <br />
cutting off the boy's clothes then applied some sort of oil all over his body not missing <br />
a single inch. Once that was done she said, &quot;Lassen Sie den Jungen gehen,&quot; and the <br />
shackles released the boy. The witch put her hands on either side of his head and <br />
said, &quot;Ich jetzt essen Sie ganz absorbieren und Ihr Leben.&quot; She then opened her <br />
mouth impossibly wide and stuffed the boy's head into it. Elizabeth could only watch in <br />
horror as the witch swallowed the boy kicking and screaming. Once the boy's feet <br />
were in the witch's mouth she turned to Elizabeth and said, &quot;You'll like eating little kids <br />
like this even if you don't take half of their remaining life force.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Elizabeth asked too stunned to say anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's how we witches live so long,&quot; the witch said. &quot;We eat children whole and <br />
absorb half of their remaining life force. This boy was going to live till he was eighty-<br />
five but now he'll be dead in an hour and mush in two hours. After that I'll gain forty <br />
years of his life force making me twenty-three again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's just plain evil,&quot; Elizabeth said outraged.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll change your mind soon enough,&quot; the witch said and cackled. &quot;I'll shape you up <br />
into a proper witch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a witch,&quot; Elizabeth said giving the witch a look that would kill if it could.<br />
<br />
The witch cackled and said, &quot;I can sense the magic within you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was transformed into this by something,&quot; Elizabeth said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would have been the light I bet,&quot; the witch said smiling. &quot;Fortunately the <br />
darkness interrupted you're transformation and made you a witch. Now I have the <br />
opportunity to teach you and mold you into a proper witch like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're crazy,&quot; Elizabeth said not believing a word the witch was saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you might say that dearie,&quot; the witch said. She picked up the boy's shirt and <br />
said, &quot;Concentrate on this shirt and say&nbsp;Gehen Sie auf die Decke. This will cause it to <br />
rise up to the ceiling.&quot; She then threw it down in front of Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth rolled her eyes but thought that if she played along she could maybe escape. <br />
She looked at the shirt concentrating on it and said, &quot;Gehen Sie auf die Decke.&quot; To her <br />
surprise the shirt rose into the air and hit the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see you can use magic,&quot; the witch said. &quot;Now all you have to do to get <br />
the shirt down is say Ende letzten Zauber which will end the last spell you cast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth sighed and said, &quot;Ende letzten Zauber,&quot; at which point the shirt fell to the <br />
floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now to end the spell holding you up,&quot; the witch said with a grin. &quot;Since my last spell <br />
was the one for eating and taking the boy's life force I need to use a different spell.&quot; <br />
She waved her hand and said, &quot;Zur&uuml;ck zur Freiz&uuml;gigkeit,&quot; upon which Elizabeth <br />
dropped to the floor. &quot;Now for some rules,&quot; the witch said. &quot;You will listen to me from <br />
now on and do what I say. You will answer my questions to the best of your ability. <br />
You will not attack me. You will address me as Mistress and show me some respect. <br />
Failure to comply with these rules will result in a transformation for you. What type of <br />
transformation depends on my mood. I could make you younger and then eat you.&quot; As <br />
she said this last part she grabbed Elizabeth's head and pressed it against her <br />
stomach where Elizabeth could here the boy screaming in pain as he was digested. <br />
&quot;Now tell me your name,&quot; the witch commanded releasing Elizabeth's head.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Elizabeth,&quot; Elizabeth said backing up a bit and looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well let's go get you some clothes Elizabeth,&quot; the witch said with a smile.</p>
