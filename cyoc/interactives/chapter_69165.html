<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next thing I knew, I was in a different place.<br />
<br />
It was like a cave, gigantic as far as I could tell at my size, but probably not much larger than a car or a wardrobe. There wasn't much light <br />
other than an eerie blue glow than seemed to come from nowhere. The surface was rocky and uneven. On further inspection I realised I was <br />
standing on junk. Boxes and bags and things. A few books, a few knives and swords and even a few pieces of clothes, all huge compared to my <br />
size. Runt was nowhere to be seen.<br />
<br />
My first thought was that this was Earth, since that's where Runt had said he was going to take me. I still wasn't certain it wasn't. If only two <br />
weeks had passed where Runt had been in the thirty years that had passed in the Fey realm, who knew how far ahead Earth was by now? It <br />
might not even ressemble what I was used to anymore. I felt a small pang of sadness at that, but I shrugged it off. I'd long ago given up any <br />
hope of seeing Earth again. Then I thought of Ferus, and moaned quietly to myself. Getting back on my train of thought, I decided that this was <br />
some other place.<br />
<br />
I hobbled over the piles of things, which would shift dangerously under my weight. After so long being a minotaur, it wasn't easy to get used to <br />
walking on all fours with such stumpy legs. I had quite a bit of practise at using a tail to balance, though, so it didn't take long to get the hang <br />
of it. Using my hunter's instinct, I decided to find the edge of this place and walk the perimeter, to get a feel for the space. I'd barely got started <br />
when I realised I wasn't alone. <br />
<br />
I smelt it first. The smell of sweat and flesh. I hesitated, and tried to get a fix on it. I didn't know how well I could trust this new nose of mine. <br />
But then I heard something move. My hunter's instinct told me to find a weapon, but a new, timid instinct told me to run and hide. As a result, I <br />
stayed rooted to the spot. And then it found me.<br />
<br />
A figure leapt over a nearby ridge of coin pouches and landed shortly in front of me. It crouched for a moment, sizing me up, ready to pounce, <br />
before standing up. Clearly it thought I was no threat. I got a good look at it. Or him, I should say. He was clearly a demon. He looked tall to <br />
me, though he couldn't really have been much taller than three or four inches. Like Runt, he had horns, though they were long and curled like <br />
ram's horns. Like Runt, he had a forked tail, though it was longer and appeared strong enough to crush somebody. And like Runt, he was <br />
completely naked, though he was much more muscular. Unlike Runt, he had leathery, crimson coloured skin, and despite being clearly very <br />
sexy, I did not feel attracted to him at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you can understand me, nod your head,&quot; he said.<br />
I did.<br />
&quot;Are you demon?&quot;<br />
I shook my head.<br />
&quot;Human?&quot;<br />
I nodded again.<br />
&quot;Hold on,&quot; he said, and approached me, &quot;I think I have enough power for this...&quot;<br />
<br />
He massaged my throat. I felt something move inside my neck.<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; I said, &quot;Oh. Thanks.&quot;<br />
He fell back, and sat on the ground, breathing heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; I asked.<br />
&quot;Do you know where you are?&quot; he asked me.<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
&quot;This is a Keeper's Realm. It is a small plane existence for storing things. It belongs to me, though Runt has stolen it. I take it you know Runt.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, boy, yes.&quot; I sighed, &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Ezekar,&quot; he said, &quot;I am a Chaos Demon. I specialise in transformation.&quot;<br />
&quot;Like Runt?&quot;<br />
The demon flashed me an angry look. I took a step back.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;Not like Runt. Runt is a low level Incubus. His power is so weak, it only works on men and only when he's near them.&quot;<br />
&quot;That sound familiar,&quot; I said, &quot;So how come he can transform people then?&quot;<br />
&quot;He's cursed me, that confounded bastard!&quot; the demon yelled, &quot;He's keeping me prisoner here so he can drain my power! I swear, if I ever get <br />
out of here I'm going to turn him into a warty toad!&quot;<br />
<br />
He leapt to his feet and kicked a nearby marble. It dinged off of a shield. After taking a moment to calm down, he said, &quot;I see he's already used <br />
my powers on you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Tell me about it.&quot;<br />
&quot;How about you tell me?&quot;<br />
So I did. How he broke into my apartment, how he turned me into a horse, then a pegasus, then a minotaur and how he left me for years. When <br />
I told him about that last part, his eyes grew wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;The curse,&quot; he breathed.<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
&quot;Tell me, did you perform coitus with him?&quot;<br />
I hesitated. I had quite specifically left that part out. But I couldn't see the sense of hiding it any longer.<br />
&quot;He's got you cursed, I'm afraid,&quot; the demon told me, &quot;Any human that is bedded by a Chaos demon is stricken with it. To live a life of eternal <br />
change.&quot;<br />
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; I asked, getting very worried.<br />
&quot;It means, every time you get used to a certain way of life, you will be destined to encounter Runt again. And when you do, he will completely <br />
change your life, whether he means to or not. Coupled with transformation powers makes for one powerful curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
I went over these words in my head. &quot;Let me get this straight,&quot; I said, &quot;Every time I settle down, he's going to appear and change me. Forever!?&quot;<br />
Ezekar nodded, &quot;So long as he lives, you cannot die, you cannot escape him and you nothing will stay the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
I gulped.</p>
