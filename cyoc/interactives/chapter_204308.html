<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A week into Caleb&#39;s &quot;studies&quot; at Bimbo Academy...<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww...fuuuuuuck...&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb sat in his dorm room, having enjoyed the first week of his stay at this &quot;Bimbo Academy&quot;. True to the name and the nature of the place, he&#39;d found himself the subject of the classes several times - used to demonstrate &quot;proper form&quot; in several sexual acts. He doubted this was an actual like, official academy. But right now, accreditation was the last thing on his mind. Whenever Caleb couldn&#39;t for whatever reason find a woman here willing to fuck him, or suck him, or whatever, he&#39;d just go to town on himself. Such was what he was doing now - late into the evening, and it seemed the classes were out for the day.<br />
<br />
His body on top of a pair of towels, stretched out over the bed, the broad lights in his dorm room casting his entire body in that same light. If anything his confidence had only grown during his time there, and he was constantly moving forward to the next woman. To the next sexual engagement. He took how inexhaustible he was for granted, he assumed it was just his libido finally having all the outlet it required. There could be no other possible explanation.<br />
<br />
His shaving had gotten to be quite a bit closer as the days went on, and today, it seemed as though he didn&#39;t require a shave as he&#39;d become accustomed. The stubble he&#39;d started the time there with seemed shorter, finer and smoother - enough that it barely showed at all. He had noted that his body hair seemed slightly lighter, too, not covering his muscles quite as much. <br />
<br />
The cocky jock could see in the mirror right by his bed his whole glorious features, and the sight almost excited him further. &quot;Hrrrmmmmgh...&quot; Caleb growled as he pumped his hand over his cock, watching himself do so in the mirror. Even his tan seemed to look better, and he grinned at himself between grunts and groans. He&#39;d never known just masturbating to feel quite so good! Well, every young man knows and remembers the sensitive spots he can reach, and Caleb was no exception, he guessed.<br />
<br />
Biting his lower lip - both lips slightly thicker than usual - he teased at his cock, going into double handing it. His hips pumped into the air as he imagined some beauty for himself to thrust away into. A woman to share his night with - even though it seemed like they just retired to their own dorms here when the light faded far too much for their taste.<br />
<br />
Caleb swore that he needed to get a new haircut. His current hair was getting a bit too long - especially in the back. Not by much, but it was noticeable enough to grab Caleb&#39;s attention even at such a junction. But he figured he could focus on that as soon as he was done dealing with this. <br />
<br />
Caleb was starting to quake with pleasure. <i>Ohh yes</i>, he thought, <i>This one... this one is going to TAKE!</i> <br />
<br />
For some reason today his body just seemed to react to the impending orgasm so much better than usual. His eyes fluttered with the pleasure, his body almost glowing between the sweat and the sweet tan, and Caleb could even feel his glutes tense and flex as he shook. &quot;Ahh...ahh fuckin&#39; yes!&quot; He could hardly keep his hands on his cock, he was feeling so charged up right now. <br />
<br />
Which was somewhat odd. He felt like he hadn&#39;t even had any action in a month - even though just two hours prior, he had been embroiled in a threesome with a beautiful redhead and an athletic brunette. Both of them couldn&#39;t keep their hands off of him! He&#39;d been somewhat surprised when the brunette touched his ass, and while he had told her not to touch him there - ass play was not his forte - it had left him somewhat...weirdly curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here---Here it comes! I&#39;m---I&#39;m gonna---!!&quot; Caleb was almost short of breath as he chased the orgasm, muscles tight and flexed as he started to feel it coming over him, &quot;I&#39;m gonna cum!&quot; He shouted, not even caring if any of the other men in the conspicuously large and roomy &quot;men&#39;s dorm&quot; heard him. Not like they had much room to complain about immodesty. Caleb sank into the towels on his bed as he luxuriated in the afterglow, his form almost twitching with the pleasant sensations. <br />
<br />
He had not even bothered to retrieve a sock or some torn up pair of old underwear. Instead he just...let it fall where it did on him and on the towels. As he came back from the experience, he groaned and looked to see where his orgiastic experience&#39;s culmination had ended up. His eyes slowly opened in a wince, looking around. Some of it was on the towel, between his legs, and the better part of it rested on his stomach and around his groin. <br />
<br />
He swore his bush used to be a little larger. There used to be more hair there. But hey. He wasn&#39;t gonna look a gift horse in the mouth. After all, it seemed to be making his dick look bigger. And who could complain about that? Caleb yawned and stretched as he got up from his experience. He swore, some of these orgasms he&#39;d started having felt like they just...rippled right through his entire body. Almost like even just any sort of sexual experience here was better than sex elsewhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;You done in there, Caleb? Sure you&#39;re done?&quot; The voice of his neighbor Cameron McCall issued from the next room over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot; Caleb answered in typical fashion, &quot;Done and done, bro. Hope I didn&#39;t disrupt anything on your end!&quot;<br />
<br />
No answer.<br />
<br />
Cameron McCall had been here a bit longer than Caleb, and the guy Caleb often just nicknamed &quot;pretty boy&quot; was every bit as much the lifting, philandering &quot;alpha male&quot; as Caleb - though he seemed entirely smooth as Caleb saw whenever the two of them used the gym together - Cam would just claim it was more comfortable for him to buzz off his body hair. Cameron&#39;s ginger red hair was longer in the back than even Caleb had his right now, usually tied back in a pony tail. Cameron was less bulky than Caleb, but maintained a powerful and toned physique more attuned for sports like swimming, water polo, endurance running, and on. His bright blue eyes got him looks even if his muscles didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Whenever Caleb went looking for some sex out on the campus, and usually he could find at least someone looking to, ah, &quot;complete their homework&quot;, Cameron was down to join him. While Caleb didn&#39;t really get the beauty routine that Cameron enjoyed, it did seem at least to work for him. More than a few women talked up how beautiful Cam looked - and even asked for tips. Which seemed to be some kind of weird turn on for him on some level, but whatever floated his boat Caleb guessed.<br />
<br />
As the muscled athlete got up, he paused in the middle of cleaning his body off. Something weirdly seemed to grab his attention in the middle of toweling off his sweat and the emission from his solo occasion. Caleb shook his head, wondering briefly what it might be. There was just something about his own emission that briefly grabbed his attention. Weird, but he figured it was nothing.<br />
<br />
By the time he was done, Caleb found himself fetching a pair of underwear. <br />
<br />
As he fitted them on, he frowned a little and turned around in front of the mirror. Was it just him? Or was his ass really showing in these boxers better than usual. He didn&#39;t know much about dudes&#39; asses, but he knew himself and what others found attractive in him well enough to know this was not usual. He tilted his head, and figured as he turned and flexed his glutes in the mirror that it might just be the wash he put his boxers through. They seemed tighter and showier today - more than usual anyway.<br />
<br />
As Caleb started toward his clothes for the night, intending to go out on the town so to speak, he heard a notification sound issue from his phone - resting in his shorts by his bed. When he went to check who or what might be sending him a message right now, he saw it was a text message. <br />
