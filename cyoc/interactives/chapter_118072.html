<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the final bell tolled the end of both the school day and the school week, the students of Moon Lake Senior High began leaving for their respective weekends.<br />
Most were excited about the Halloween dance tomorrow night.<br />
A few had parents who were concerned about how the wedding of Jennifer Harper to Harold Jenkins would turn out tomorrow morning, so in turn those students were concerned to some extent too.<br />
Yet there was a select minority of the student body who also had plans for this weekend beyond the dance Halloween night.<br />
<br />
As Ben Twist walked to his car at the end of the day, he thought about his plans. Most of which revolved around one person: his girlfriend Kenya Adaeze.<br />
There was no denying that the werewolf was in love with the werepanthress/leopard. He would be the first to admit it. The adopted son of Samantha and Frances Twist looked forward to the day when he could officially propose, let alone marry the were of his dreams.<br />
But that time would not come until after he turned 18 and graduated high school. For now, Ben had to be satisfied to see her when he could, and miss her when he couldn&#39;t.<br />
As he put his books in the trunk of his car, for despite it being the weekend he still had homework to do, Ben leaned against his car and waited for the others he was giving rides home to.<br />
<br />
Soon Ben saw Julie Stovall and Eric Anderson walking out of the building. The two love birds, <i>or should that be love fish?</i> he wondered, were walking side by side and holding hands. With the two both being were-mers, Ben knew that technically the happy couple were already engaged, as signified by the single pearl necklace Julie wore proudly around her neck, but like him, they could not get married until after both their 18th birthdays and high school graduation, which unfortunately was a longer wait for them than him.<br />
<i>But they&#39;re so happy together,</i> he observed, as they approached Ben&#39;s car.<br />
<br />
Then Ben saw Eric&#39;s older brother Nate Anderson come out the building with his boyfriend Alex Ramsey. The two had fallen in love from the night Alex welcomed the newest werewolf into the pack that he and Ben belonged to, and they were inseparable ever since.<br />
Technically, Nate and Alex only had as long as Ben to wait before they could marry, but if it was one thing the five of them had in common, it would be waiting until they could officially be with the one&#39;s they love forever.<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; began Alex, as they approached Ben&#39;s car, &quot;after Ben drops us off at your place, we get your stuff and go back to my house. My folks should already be on their way to wherever they&#39;re spending the weekend, so we&#39;ll have the place to ourselves,&quot; he added happily, for Alex&#39;s parents were expecting Nate to <i>babysit</i> their son over the weekend to keep him company.<br />
&quot;Sure. But homework and dinner first handsome,&quot; Nate reminded him, while using his pet name for Alex. &quot;You know how all our parents will squawk if we don&#39;t take care of our education or eat right.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry stud,&quot; replied Alex, using his pet name for Nate. &quot;I&#39;ve got a gorgeous meal all planned out. And you can already guess what&#39;s on the menu for desert,&quot; he whispered in his human ear, for everyone was in their normal forms during daylight hours in public.<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t there be a law against homework on a weekend?&quot; wondered Eric, as he held the door open for Julie now that everyone&#39;s books were in Ben&#39;s trunk.<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t be as bad for us my love,&quot; said Julie, while giving Eric a kiss on the cheek before entering the car. &quot;The only things we&#39;ll have to worry about in regards to dinner is doing our homework and setting the table while mom gets it ready. Then we&#39;ll have the whole night in the pool and cabana before the Halloween dance tomorrow.&quot;<br />
Eric smiled at that as he got in the car behind Julie.<br />
The quintet realized that except for maybe Alex, they would all have to separate to collect and dress in their Halloween costumes, but would see each other at the dance Saturday night, depending upon how everything went at the wedding in the morning.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;So, I contacted Samantha Twist,&quot; began Martha Anderson, while folding up a piece of paper. &quot;Here&#39;s the contact information for Lila Carpenter,&quot; she added, before giving the note to her friend and sometimes lover Coach Katherine &quot;Kat&quot; Johnson.<br />
The two had met while Martha was acting as a substitute assistant coach at the Junior High School this week while Kat&#39;s regular assistant was out of town tending to her mother, who was still a normal and didn&#39;t know a thing about weres.<br />
The ladies had hit it off and had great sex together.<br />
Unfortunately, Martha was a happily married bi-werecat and Kat was a lesbian weretigress. Part of Kat kept hoping that Martha might dump her husband to be with the tigress full time, but was smart enough to realize that would never happen and kept her desires silent.<br />
Yet the two had become friends and would see each other from time to time, with <i>fringe</i> benefits.<br />
&quot;Are you sure this... Lila will even be interested in me?&quot; Kat asked, looking at the closed note like it was an alien object.<br />
&quot;Only one way to find out. Call her sometime,&quot; advised Martha, before giving Kat a kiss. &quot;Will I see you at the Halloween dance tomorrow night?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure. Save me a dance?&quot; Kat asked in return.<br />
&quot;Definitely. Thanks for a great week and a marvelous time,&quot; said Martha, before whispering in Kat&#39;s ear, &quot;Both in and out of school.&quot;<br />
With that, Martha Anderson gave Kat another quick kiss before saying goodbye. She had to go home and get ready, for as an honorary member, she had to accompany her husband William to the Skulk&#39;s annual pre-Halloween planning meeting to arrange all their tricks and treats.<br />
Of course, she would be greatly surprised if the subject of the Harper-Jenkins wedding didn&#39;t come up, especially since the bride and groom to be were also werefoxes and would be at the same meeting.<br />
Kat watched Martha leave the gym office and the junior high school, still staring off in the direction she last saw the woman long after Martha was completely out of sight, still holding the note in her hand.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
&quot;So, what do you think?&quot; Ted Green asked his wife Marci.<br />
They were standing in the lobby of Moon Lake&#39;s only hotel, still staring at the message that had been left for them.<br />
The note from Lila Carpenter was short and to the point.<br />
ENCORE? it said, a reference to the fact that it was Lila who had escorted Ted into were society so the new weretiger could finally be with his werecat wife in ALL matters.<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; began Marci as they walked back to their hotel room. &quot;She did do us a HUGE favor, and I&#39;ll admit that I would love to taste her honey as much as she probably wants to feel that new tiger penis of yours plowing her depths again.&quot;<br />
&quot;You know what I told you before I finally gained a fursona,&quot; said Ted, opening their hotel room door. &quot;I have no problem with you being on the prowl with other women, because it&#39;s just a part of your bi-werecat nature. But unless they&#39;re willing and you want to share, you are the only woman for me,&quot; Ted reminded her.<br />
With the hotel room door now closed and locked, the happy couple passionately started kissing each other as they began hastily undressing their respective partner.<br />
&quot;Darling, I&#39;ve got the feeling that we both are going to have a LOT of sex in Moon Lake before our vacation is over,&quot; purred Marci, even as she undid her husband&#39;s pants and started fondling Ted&#39;s cock.<br />
It was already hard and growing fast, even before the Greens were totally undressed and started assuming their fursonas.<br />
&quot;As soon as we can safely do so, we definitely have to permanently move to Moon Lake,&quot; said Ted, as a now 8 foot tall white furred Bengal weretiger picked up his white furred werecat wife and carried her to the bed for another fun session of hot and passionate sex.<br />
&quot;You know, we only have about an hour or so before we have to meet the Deckers for dinner,&quot; Marci reminded him, even as she joyously accepted his hard penis within her.<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s not waste a minute of it,&quot; the weretiger replied, even as his mate experienced her first orgasm of that afternoon.<br />
