<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you begun to head home you inserted the ring in you index finger and looked at it in many angles. You went passed the cafe and saw a beautiful woman in her 20s reading something on her phone.<br />
<br />
&#39;I wish girl like her would talk to me someday,&#39; you thought to yourself and immediatly as your mind finished the sentence. You noticed her standing up and making eye contact at you. Without a warning you saw her approaching at you and asking if you had time to talk for a while. You hesitantly agreed on her request.<br />
<br />
As you sit down opposite where to her she introduced herself as Lisa, a 23-year-old, university student. You introduced yourself back at her as she wanted to talk with you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Believe it or not, but I was looking someone like you.&quot; Lisa explained. &quot;Like I&#39;m an art student from different state and I want someone to show me around. Like tell me what are the local feel good spots and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Well I&#39;m a local and bit nervous.&quot; You explain to her. &quot;I think it&#39;s pretty brave of you to come here and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. I have friend in here, and... well they are locals, but for some reason I just... you know wanted to know you better.&quot; She explains.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, okay? Are you certain that the guide has to be me?&quot; You ask once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;100%! As I said, it&#39;s like the moment I saw you looking me from the window. I couldn&#39;t but think of you.&quot; She continues her little explanation.<br />
<br />
You start to think to yourself that either this young woman is acting strange or the ring is actually doing something. You straighten your index finger towards her and ask her if she could call you darling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see why not, darling.&quot; She replied without a second thought.<br />
<br />
You head begins to swirl in confusion as she keeps calling you darling as if it was normal to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I ask you something?&quot; You sweat. &quot;Do you have boyfriend by any chance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, yes. Yes I do have one and we&#39;ve been dating for four years if I&#39;m correct...&quot; She replies to your question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you find it somewhat odd that you are calling me darling while you have a boyfriend.&quot; You ask her directly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. I don&#39;t think so. I have a nickname for him.&quot; She starts to explain. &quot;I call you darling since you asked me to call that just moment ago. I don&#39;t find it weird or anything as I want to call you that and.. well... I can see why you find it bizarre that I call you darling and my boyfriend hubby or honey... they have oddly similar feels to it. But if I&#39;m being honest with you I don&#39;t feel any oddity calling you my darling.&quot;<br />
<br />
You are silent for a moment as your try to process everything she just said. Then you make your next move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would it be okay if I came to your apartment for a while?&quot; You ask expecting, &quot;no&quot; as a correct answer from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure why not. I was done eating anyway.&quot; She answers and starts to pack her stuff. &quot;I live nearby so walking there shouldn&#39;t take a long.&quot;<br />
<br />
With many questions in your head you start to follow Lisa to her small apartment. Inside the apartment you see a lot of clothing and underwear on the floor, a lot of used trash littered everywhere and a massive pink dildo on top of an used sofa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry. I didn&#39;t think I had someone visiting me today so I didn&#39;t bother to clean up.&quot; She begins to clean her house franticly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I am fine with it. Just leave it as is.&quot; You say back at her and she immediatly stops.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are?&quot; Lisa looks at you as she turns back at you. &quot;Whew. I was getting worried over nothing I guess...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Worried over what?&quot; You ask her as she walks near her fridge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well for other girls this kind of mess is a very big deal. I&#39;ve left a lot of stuff around the house thinking that no-one would visit me in a long time. Even my boyfriend visits me once a month and I clean up for her in advance.&quot; She says as she starts to eat leftover pizza from fridge. &quot;So in a way I feel conflicted, but that much if I&#39;m being honest, that my apartment looks like a mess. But if you say it&#39;s fine, then it&#39;s fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So the dildo...?&quot; You ask as you approach it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I was bored and horny. So I used it this morning.&quot; She smiles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you horny now?&quot; You ask as you smile back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I could be.&quot; She laughs.<br />
<br />
As you sit on the sofa you ask from her if she would be willing to give you a blowjob on the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean, right now...?&quot; She looks at you puzzled and approaches you slowly in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; You ask her again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you see. I haven&#39;t given a blowjob to anyone, but I can try. Don&#39;t blame me if it&#39;s sloppy.&quot; She explains as she kneels down in front of you. &quot;I haven&#39;t done this to anyone, not even my boyfriend. Like we haven&#39;t had sex and the closest thing of intimacy has been kissing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so you&#39;ve never seen real life dick before?&quot; You ask her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep. Only masturbated with my hand and other feminine products.&quot; Lisa continues explaining as she lowers your trousers and panties down on the floor.<br />
<br />
Without a hesitation she begins to lick the flacid penis. The slimy tongue lipping your manhood makes you fall little bit on your back. As she is clearly doing something she thinks is blowjob. As your dick gets more and more erected it starts to become much more easier for her to take the whole meatstick in her mouth.<br />
<br />
She begins to bop her head in a solid and slow rhythm as she takes the penis from shallow tipping to more deeper sucking. She lets out couple of winces as she begins to masturbate herself. She is finding this whole situation very kinky too as she begins to use her tongue more.<br />
<br />
Then you feel it. A jolting spurt of ecstacy as you unload your balls into her mouth. She is surprised from the moment her whole mouth is filled with salty liquid and before she can cough you shout to her to swallow it all. She without thinking lets our a massive gulping noise and looks at you a little bit disappointed.<br />
<br />
On that situation you try to think something to say.</p>
