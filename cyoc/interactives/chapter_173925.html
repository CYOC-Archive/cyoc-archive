<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was getting very late, so Brie called it a night and reluctantly thanked Clarice before she went back to the shack. Once she removed all of her clothing, and carefully slid the duster out of her ass, she slipped into her bed and noted how nice her sheets felt against her softer skin, especially around her boobs. Thankfully they didn&#39;t pinch or pull on her chain too. And because of that, Brie was able to fall asleep almost instantly. <br />
<br />
It was just past sunrise whwn Brie awoke, completely feeling both refreshed and wide awake. Looking at her clock, it showed 6:00 am. &quot;A perfect time to get up&quot; or so she thought. Exiting her bed, which she instantly made upon leaving it, she stretched and slipped on her high heels and a pair of sexy lace panties which she didn&#39;t remember necessarily owning, but still fit around her ass perfectly, so she didn&#39;t pay it much mind. <br />
<br />
Moving over to her mirror, she brushed her long, almost white, platinum blonde hair until it no longer looked quite as unkempt, and pulled it into a quick ponytail. She choose a large red bow for today, and fixed it in place, so that it was now what held her only just slightly messy ponytail. <br />
<br />
Satisfied for bow, she left her bedroom to begin making herself breakfast. &quot;Click&quot; &quot;Jingle&quot; &quot;Click&quot; &quot;Jingle&quot;. Those were the loudest sounds in the house at the moment as Brie&#39;s high heeled footsteps against the hardwood floor and her jiggling nipple chain were the only noises being made. Her parents likely were still fast asleep after returning home a few hours earlier this morning. Brie turned on the coffee maker and began making herself a latte. However the machine beeped, signalling that there was no milk in the tank. Brie opened the fridge to grab some however, apparently they were out of milk. <br />
<br />
Brie let out a disappointed sigh. &quot;Well, I guess there is always the old fashioned way.&quot; Carefully, she began to remove her nipple rings, making sure to remove them gently so that she didn&#39;t accidently make herself cum. Once free of their rings, her nipples perked right back up again. But this time though, small white beads began to form on their surface. Brie knew she only had a few seconds to work with and she already could feel it comming. She had just managed to hook up the suction tubes to her nipples and into the back of coffee maker right as the damn broke and milk began pouring out of her nipples. She flipped the switch and watched as the milk began to get sucked down the clear tubes into the coffee maker. It had only been about 20 seconds before she was able to watch her latte begin to pour into her mug, and then watched it get mixed in with her own breast milk, which still wasn&#39;t showing any signs of slowing down. Now that her drink was ready, she quickly moved her tubes from out of the coffee maker and back into the milker. Which she let finish the job of emptying her breasts while she sipped her latte and cleaned up the counter. <br />
<br />
Finally after a few minutes, she felt the last of her milk trickle out of her nipples and into the reservoir attached to the milker. She turned it off and removed her now elongated nipples from the suction tubes. It would take a minute or 2 before she could reattach her nipple rings. It was the down side of milking herself. The machine stretched out her nipples quite a bit. Her usual roughly half an inch long nipples had been stretched to over 2 inches.<br />
<br />
Finally, she placed the breast milk filled reservoir into the fridge and wrote the date on it. At least now she didn&#39;t have to go and get milk for another day or 2. Truth be told, she actually prefered her milk to other sources, but since the process of getting it out of her was rather annoying, her breast milk was closer to a special treat that she could enjoy every once in a while. By the time she finished putting everything away, her nipples had returned to their normal shape, allowing her to put her rings back on them, which she quickly did. <br />
<br />
She grabbed her latte and left the kitchen, making her way over to the couch to watch a bit of TV. Turning it on, she put her heels up onto the foot stool and began to relax and enjoy her saturday morning before she had to start her duties as a maid, in other words, making her parents their morning coffee and breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you planning on staying topless today while casually wearing sexy panties and 5&quot; platform pumps? Or do you plan to put the rest of your clothes on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Today is my morning off, Mistress, and for the record, I happen to find these high heels to be very comfortable to walk and relax in.&quot; Answered Brie, not even giving Clarice, who had appeared next to her, a look of acknowledgement. &quot;I see, and how enjoyable exactly do you find living life as Brie to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brie thought for a moment before answering truthfully &quot;I find it to be strangly relaxing and very comfortable actually, Mistress. That wouldn&#39;t happen to be because of your meddling, would it?&quot; &quot;No, today this is entirely all you. I only kept you as Brie. Everything else is either your own opinion, or just how your life as Brie has played out so far. Tell me, how <br />
exactly does one become their on family&#39;s maid?&quot; Teased Clarice. However, Brie sent it right back &quot;I would have to say it was because of a certain bored witch who had nothing better to do with herself, so she decided to mess with other&#39;s lives for fun.&quot; Brie smerked after she said it. This confidence she felt  made her no longer fear her Mistress, and actually was having a bit of fun speaking to her like this. Fairly casual, with no power or authority being held directly over the other. &quot;Anyways, may I as why am I still Brie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I thought you would be more freaked out than this. My mistake I guess.&quot; Admitted Clarice. &quot;However... maybe I can still do a little something to spice things up.&quot; She thought to herself.</p>
