<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke half way when Samantha carried me to my room but I fell back asleep quickly.<br />
<br />
I woke in the morning when Mommy shook me and said &quot;It's time to get up Ashley.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy&quot; I said in a sleepy voice. &quot;You called me Ashley.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I did&quot; Mommy said. &quot;Samantha told me what happened last night. Did you really become a girl as soon as you accepted being called Ashley?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I did Mommy&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess your transformation will continue now&quot; Mommy said. &quot;Samantha told me that you two brought up Katherine's old clothes. I've washed them and put them in your closet. Get up and get dressed. We'll go to the park after breakfast. Then we'll get ice cream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do with my old clothes?&quot; I asked as I sat up and yawned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I put them in the box and put them in the basement&quot; Mommy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; I said. I slid out of bed and as I did my nightgown bunched up so Mommy could see my panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to wear Dry-nights Ashley&quot; Mommy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; I asked. &quot;I don't wet the bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're changing into a three year old girl&quot; Mommy said. &quot;When you were little the first time you had accidents at night until you were five. I want you to wear the Dry-nights just in case you regress to five or younger at night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mommy&quot; I said. &quot;I'll wear the Dry-nights.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good girl&quot; Mommy said with a little hint of pride.<br />
<br />
When I went to get clothes out of my closet I noticed that the tick mark now said 'age 7' and was at four foot. I had shrunk an inch and regressed a year overnight. I guess Mommy was right to want me to wear Dry-nights to bed. I thought that if I kept regressing at the same rate I could be a three year old girl by Tuesday. It didn't matter though, I was going to be a three year old girl soon enough. I was surprised that I was ok with it. I shook my head and picked<br />
out a nice yellow dress. I went over to my dresser and picked out a pair of plain yellow panties. After dressing I threw my nightgown and the panties I wore last night into the hamper. After that, I went to get breakfast.<br />
<br />
As I ate breakfast Mommy asked &quot;How do you like being a girl so far Ashley?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's nice&quot; I said and meant it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good&quot; Mommy said.<br />
<br />
After breakfast Mommy took us to the park. Me and Katherine had loads of fun playing on the swings and going down the slides. While we were playing it looked like I had shrunk yet again as the steps on the ladder seemed to be a little higher. I shrugged this off as I was going to be shrinking even more. I continued to play and have fun.<br />
<br />
After about four hours Mommy took us to get some lunch at a nice restaurant. While Mommy had a chef's salad me and Katherine had grilled cheese sandwiches. I kept swinging my feet back and forth while I ate. Out of the blue Katherine asked &quot;Mommy, can me and Marcus get our ears pierced?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until you two are older&quot; Mommy said. &quot;And remember that Marcus is Ashley now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Mommy&quot; Katherine said. &quot;Sorry Ashley.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn't blame Katherine for calling me Marcus. This was a big change after all and you can't expect a four year old to always call me Ashley after less then a day. Evidently Mommy was thinking along these lines since she said &quot;It's ok sweetheart. I don't expect you to remember that all the time. I know that you'll slip up sometimes until you get used to this.&quot;<br />
<br />
When I slid off the chair when we were done eating I noticed that I might have shrunk again. If that was true then I was shrinking faster than I thought I would be. If I was right I was five now. I just had two more years to go until I reached three. I just wondered what my room looked like now.<br />
<br />
Mommy took us back to the park and we stopped and got ice cream on the way. I kept laughing at how me and Katherine were eating our ice cream cones. We were getting ice cream on our noses and around our mouths. Some ice cream dripped on our dresses which Mommy quickly cleaned off. Ice cream was even dripping down the cone and our hands. We didn't care though. We were just happy to have ice cream. Once we were done with our ice cream Mommy cleaned us up and told<br />
us to go play. Just as we were going to play I noticed that I had shrunk some more since I was now just a little bit shorter than Katherine. We were playing for just a couple of hours when both of us started to yawn. It was time for our naps.<br />
<br />
I fell asleep on the way home and didn't wake up when she took me up to my bed. When I did wake up I noticed that my room had indeed changed more. I now had nets hanging from the ceiling with stuffed animals in them. The dolls that had appeared before looked brand new. There was even the doll that wets herself, the same one I started to go get when all this started. My bed had changed into a toddler bed with a rail on the side to prevent me from falling out accidentally. I scooted down to the foot of my bed and got up. I was still dressed in my dress and panties. Fortunately I didn't have<br />
an accident. I went over to my closet and saw that the mark on the height ruler had indeed changed. It was now at three foot one and said 'age 3'. It was done now. I was a three year old girl.<br />
<br />
Over the next few weeks I became used to being a girl. To my surprise Thomas retained his memories of me as did Samantha. Mommy tried to find out why that was but with no luck. It really didn't matter to me why Thomas remembered as long as he did. Unfortunately we couldn't do the things we had before. That kind of made me a little sad but I was happy that Thomas was still my friend.</p>
