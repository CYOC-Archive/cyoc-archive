<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After you brought Nate, your obese neighbor inside, he asked how was your business trip. You in your white unbuttoned dress shirt with a white tank top as an undershirt. And black slacks, which you would’ve unbuttoned as well, if it weren’t the fact that you have a guest right now.<br />
<br />
Nate is dressed in his usual wear. Surprisingly, with his massive body of fat, that he would be able to put on clothes on his own. Of course, he only wore a very large sized green Polo shirt, and Blue jeans that you’ll never understand how big they make them. And lastly, instead of shoes he wears sandals.<br />
<br />
You and him have your own relationship, though since he told you of his homosexuality, you’re reluctant to say anything about yourself, neither confirming or denying your own sexuality. That said, you can be friends with him. And you still are.<br />
<br />
For a while in your den, you both discussed about your future as a wrestler. You spoke to Nate. “I really don’t see the issue with me… I’m fit, I’m healthy, and I’m fine. I don’t really need to ‘bulk up’ at all!” You are frustrated. Nate shook his head stifling a snicker. Your not amused. “What?”<br />
<br />
“Vince, You really don’t get it! You are too Hard-Headed, too head strong! Didn’t you even consider changing your wrestler status, from a heel to a head?” Nate asked sincerely. You told him ‘no’ and he began with. “Well I think it’s time for you to-“<br />
<br />
“Actually, you don’t get it. You honestly think I hadn’t already tried it? No matter what I do, I get Booed!” You spoke over him.<br />
<br />
“To be fair, your attempts to convince the crowd are poor. And face it, your body is not approachable.” <br />
<br />
“What do you mean by that Nate?”<br />
<br />
“Vince, your policeman gimmick is getting antiquated, everybody hates the cops nowadays. Maybe you need to change your character, make yourself a bit more… ‘Adorable’.”<br />
<br />
“Ha! I am more adorable! I mean didn’t you see me on tv? The chicks loved the suit!”<br />
<br />
Nate knows full well about your Chief Storm uniform. A mostly dark blue with gold shields on the shoulders of the shirt. And of course, a gold policeman badge on your left part of chest shirt.<br />
<br />
“And I feel bad for any woman met you in that uniform. I mean, If I didn’t know you personally. I’d assume that you’re the real deal.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks! I work hard to be as convincing as I can!” You being oblivious to his sarcasm.<br />
<br />
Nate gave you a weird look, and stated. “That’s not a compliment Vincent!” He’s worried about you, if you’re not gonna change your habits to be better, who’s to say that you’ll still have a job after you’re ‘Let go’.<br />
<br />
Nate continues. “Or perhaps changing your wardrobe, or maybe your diet would-.”<br />
<br />
“What?” You interrupt him, you don’t like where this is going.<br />
<br />
“You can be a sumo wrestler instead!” Nate suggests.<br />
<br />
“No that not what I-“<br />
<br />
“Or start sporting a big belly. I know for a fact that everyone loves hugging a big bellied Santa.”<br />
<br />
“Nathan! STOP!” You’re really are sick of everyone suggesting to change his image. And why would he?! After an awkward pause, you continue with a rhetorical question. “Let me ask ya something… Have you ever heard of anyone loving a fatass cop before?” That wasn’t meant to be answered, but Nate did anyway.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know about real life, But I do know that there is a good number of people who adore Benjamin Clawhauser.”<br />
<br />
“Who?”<br />
<br />
Nate elaborates. “Benjamin Clawhauser is a flabby donut-loving cheetah cop from Zootopia. You seen the movie, right?”<br />
<br />
“Um… Yeah! I did.” Well once… you didn’t really much care for it. It just seems like it’s one of those movies. That is marketed for kids when it really wasn’t. And yet somehow your neighbor loved that movie so much, that he wanted to you a copy of that movie. You still have it with you to this day.<br />
<br />
“You know what?” Now it’s Nate’s turn to ask a question. “How about you make this as your new gimmick? Just hear me out! If you start gaining weight, and hold on to that uniform, you can be Clawhauser in real life! Or at the very least, the human version of that character! That sounds amazing Huh?”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely not!”<br />
<br />
You don’t really want to keep talking about it so you change the subject. “And besides, that guy doesn’t get any girls.”<br />
<br />
“I mean I can’t argue with that. He doesn’t get anyone. Though the fans did ship him with Bogo.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh! Why?!” You didn’t think anyone would want them ‘together’ together.<br />
<br />
Nate nonchalantly states. “Because they can?… anyway, he does have these traits that’s gay coded. Granted, it is not confirmed, but he might as be gay. You didn’t say that you’re straight, so why not hang loose?”<br />
<br />
“Nate, I’ll be surprised that I would even be fat to begin with. Now, let me show you the box.” And you and Nate went to the package.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the donuts heard Nate’s suggestion. And decides to slowly make that happen!<br />
<br />
————————————-<br />
<br />
You try to show him that the donuts are supernatural. But you end up looking like a fool. The magic didn’t happen again! This time, they act like normal donuts.<br />
<br />
Nate unconvinced, was trying to lighten the mood.<br />
“Well they’re a nice person who ever they are, was giving you free food. Must be really nice to have gifts from someone!”<br />
<br />
You could tell him about the branding on the box, but what good would that do? That’s like saying ‘Lucky Charms cereal would actually make you lucky.’<br />
<br />
Nate takes a donut from the box, you tried to stop him, but he reassures you. “Relax Vince! You’re making a big deal over nothing. Besides they look too good to waste.” And after taking a big bite. He was amazed with the taste. “Boy howdy! You sure you don’t want to try these? You really are missing out!”<br />
<br />
You knew this was all a ploy by the magic donut, to get me to eat them. Well it ain’t happening! If Nate wants them so much. “Actually, Nate, why not take the whole box with you. Its a gift from me to you.”<br />
<br />
Nate baffled, refuses the offer. “I’m sorry Vince but, I don’t want to take what belongs to you.” You wanted to say that ‘I insist, or it’s all good’. But no matter what, you can’t seem to get the words out. These donuts refuses to let you go.<br />
<br />
Nate remarks. “You know, you really should try these! In fact, I want you to become Benjamin Clawhauser, that way you can eat all those donuts without shame!”<br />
<br />
And so the donuts glow, obvious to your neighbor. The glow felt weird on your body. As if you might feel funny.<br />
<br />
Nate decides to leave. “You know? I think it’s time for me to leave. You’re welcome for the package.” You tried to thank him with his help. And suddenly Nate almost tipped over, but lands on the couch. But as he tries to stand up he ripped his blue jeans! Fortunately for him he was wearing his underwear, the generic tighty whities with red hearts on it.<br />
<br />
You just sat there, blushing beat red, and you’re thinking. ‘He ripped his a pants! Oh-Em-Goodness! Nate is so hot with that cute underwear that he wears around that cute butt of his! ” And just then you realized that, you’re not talking like what you normally like. ‘Why did I even think that?! What’s happening to me?’<br />
<br />
Nate tries to save face by taking off his shirt, and covering his ripped pants. But at the same time, showing off his obese belly, which somehow is making you aroused, because your pants just pitched a tent.<br />
<br />
You have told yourself before, that you are not gay, but right now these reactions says otherwise.<br />
<br />
Nate got himself ready to depart, when he says to you. “Well, you know my phone number, if you want any more help, I’m willing to do it for you. And if you like, you can visit my house, I’m living alone anyway, I’m single.”<br />
<br />
When you heard that he’s ‘single’ that made your tent throb like crazy. Seriously, why are you acting this way?!<br />
<br />
“Absolutely!” You cover your mouth. Why did your voice sound almost effeminate? Never mind why did you even say that at all?! You cleared your throat, and try again. “I mean… I’ll think about it.”<br />
<br />
“Okay!” Nate opened the door. “See ya next time dude!” And he left. While he walks away, you saw him leave with your eyes on his butt, that lovely juicy fatass of his. I wish I have an ass like that.<br />
<br />
You violently shake your head, does this keep happening?! You look at the box of donuts again. “I can’t believe you made me look like a lier! What do you plan to do to me next?” And when you opened the box, magic happens again, but this time it came with a note. You read what it says.<br />
<br />
—<br />
“We are only trying to protect our connection, we cannot separate just yet. You need to be good and fat before we do. In the meantime I decided to fulfill your friends wish instead. Since you refused to make a wish on your accord. And yes, I can transform someone both physically, and mentality. So if he wanted to see his favorite fictional character brought to life, either by metaphorically just by you acting like him or just have his personality like in the movie; or literally with you actually becoming an anthropomorphic fat cheetah from the actual movie. But don’t fret, you’re not going to lose your identity, we will only improve it, make it better. You’ll still be Vincent Gay! But with a different lifestyle. One that is more happier! I have another thing I want to do to make the start of your transformation journey more interesting.”<br />
—<br />
<br />
You’ve read this over, and over and you still don’t get it! How could this be happening?! But now you went from a fit Pro-Wrestler who is as straight as an arrow into a queer man who has the hots for his fat neighbor, who is also gay! You are scared at comes nexts…<br />
<br />
So the question is… </p>
