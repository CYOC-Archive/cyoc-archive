<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I can&#39;t move! My protection charm should&#39;ve protected me!&quot; The orc yelled, struggling to move but to no avail. <br />
<br />
&quot;That charm of yours is no match against the power of the gods!&quot; Pierce boastfully said as he looked at his surrounding. It was like time itself stopped. Everyone around them were frozen in place. No one can truly interrupt what Pierce is about to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Subject is now set in compliant mode.&quot; The Photovac telepathically said to Pierce. Again, Pierce didn&#39;t understand what the tablet was saying but he instinctively knew what it meant. He wanted to further inspect his captive. Pierce drooled over the bound orc, he had to admit he was pretty hot but couldn&#39;t decide what to take from the orc. There was the dick and balls of course but he wanted to prolong the orc&#39;s capture. After all, he did say he wanted to entertain the gods.<br />
<br />
Pierce got a briliant idea. Why don&#39;t he let the orc convince him on what he should take? The orc should know more about his body that Pierce. &quot;Give me a show big guy! Tell me what makes you sexy, what do men love about your body, what makes you proud of it. Convince me!&quot; Pierce demanded, the orc suddenly stood still, his face became seductive but Pierce could still see the anger in his eyes.<br />
<br />
The orc stripped his armor but left his loincloth untouched and began putting a show for Pierce. The imp clapped his hands and sat down on the ground enjoying the orc&#39;s forced performance. The orc showed hes butt, flexed his muscles and danced making his junk wiggle in the process.<br />
<br />
Even though the orc was straight, he did hit on him from time to time. Pierce asked him what guys liked about him so he answered based on the experiences he had with the guys admiring him. &quot;Guys love how muscular I am! They wanted me to be their daddy with these muscles!&quot; The orc said as he flexed his muscles, his actions forced against his will.<br />
<br />
“Guys can&#39;t resist my scent! They fall head over heels the moment the caught a whiff of it, Oh yeah! Combined with my body hair, they&#39;ll know their place immediately!” The orc continued as he showed his bushy pits. His scent was so strong that even Pierce smelled it from where he was sitting, making him hard in the process.<br />
<br />
“And these bad boy ! Once you taste it you could never go back!” The orc was about to remove his loincloth but was stopped by Pierce. “Alright! I&#39;ve heard enough. You make a good point but I don&#39;t want to see your dick just yet, I&#39;m saving it for last.” Pierce said as he walked toward the orc and placed his finger on his lips.<br />
<br />
The orc stopped immediately and stood still. “What the hell did you make me do!? I&#39;m not some pansy gay ass shit you sick freak!” The orc yelled, he was once again in control of his face but not his body. <br />
<br />
“You did quite a performance there. You really got me sold! I wanted to explore some more though,  so kneel down before me!” Pierce commanded, the orc immediately went down on both knees as Pierce came closer. The imp let out a long whistle, he could see the difference on their size. Pierce stood 3&#39;7 foot tall, an average height for his species only half the orc&#39;s size. There was a surge of excite building up within Pierce. Just the thought of a pipsqueak like him dominating a giant turned him on.<br />
<br />
“flex your right arm.” Pierce ordered another command. The orc followed the order and flexed hard. Pierce worshiped the biceps, his eyes on the orc&#39;s tattoo tracing it with his fingers<br />
<br />
“Whatever it is you&#39;re going to do to me is nothing compared to the countless torture I have endured through out my career, so do your worst imp!” The orc spat out only to be met by an unfazed Pierce.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I&#39;ll be sure to do my worst but I&#39;m getting ahead of myself. Let&#39;s start something small to test this bad boy out.” Pierce said, now fiddling with the Photovac again. He finally found what he was looking, it was the multi editor tool. He then took a selfie of himself and registered his picture on the tablet. He then open both his and the orc&#39;s profile. <br />
<br />
A 3d model of Pierce and the orc appeared side by side. Pierce stared at his 3d model, it was the first time he really got to see his own body up close. The examined his pointy ears and blonde spiky hair. His face was as smooth like the rest of his body, body hair was a rare trait in his species after all. <br />
<br />
Pierce&#39;s body is built like that of an thin, eight year old human child. No muscle definition can be seen. He also sports a pot belly, it must be because of his drinking habits.<br />
<br />
His clothes were fully rendered too, his vest, scarf and baggy pats were all present in the model. His body was devoided of markings and earings. Pierce always finds them hot but he was afraid of needles and getting pierced. It was ironic how his parents named him the same thing he feared the most, but that will change today. With the Photovac, he can theoretically get those tattoos and piercings without feeling pain. It was a good starting point to test out the Relic&#39;s swapping capability. There were a bunch of tools on the side of the screen. He instinctively pick the icon that resembled a wand and hovered it to the orc&#39;s tattoos. It highlighted all of it and a bunch of options popped up. Pierce selected cut which made the orc&#39;s tattoos disappear. Pierce was in awe and continued, he highlighted his model and the options were back again, this time he picked paste. A message popped up which read: Traits pasted will be scaled to model&#39;s size. Pierce clicked confirm knowing he can just undo it. &quot;Change will be completed in 5 minutes.&quot; The Photovac once again notify Pierce via telepathy.<br />
<br />
The imp turned his attention to the orc who was making death threats towards him. &quot;And after I remove that head of yours from that patethic body, I&#39;ll turn your skull into a drinking mug....huh?&quot; The orc stopped mid threat noticing a tingle from his right hand. His eyes widen as the tatoos in his hand were dissapearing. <br />
<br />
Pierce felt the same tingle. He looked at his right hand and the tattoos that were dissapearing from the orc were slowly appearing on his hands and going towards his right pec. He didn&#39;t felt any pain and was enjoying it, his member stiff as a rock at this point. Once the change were finished Pierce lets out an evil laugh.<br />
<br />
He slowly traced his new tattoo, it has a rough texture to it. The orc was speechless at what had occured. The tatoos felt right on his body, he looks menacing like this but Pierce wanted more. He did some editing once again and looked the orc expectantly. &quot;My tattoo! They were symbols of my victory!&quot; The orc yelled. &quot; Well their my tattoos now so get used to it! It feels so right on my body that on yours anyways! Pierce retaliated. Just when the orc could reply, he felt an unknown force tugging his nose ring. Within seconds, it came flying off his nose and reattached itself on Pierce. The imp once again laugh as he played with it a little. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you feel that?&quot; Pierce once again taunted the orc. The bound warrior felt his tusk starting to retract, once fully gone, two tiny sharp teeth reappeared from where they once were.The orc turned his attention towards Pierce. He made it a point to grin as wide a he can, showing something growing. The orc&#39;s tusks replaced the teeth of Pierce, he made sure it was set to swap on it&#39;s original size. It now adorned Pierce&#39;s mouth. &quot;Damn I look hot with these!&quot; Pierce said as he flaunts his newly accquired attributes. For once, the orc was beginning to tremble. Seeing Pierce with his formerly owned traifs took a huge blow to his pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;What devil&#39;s summoning circle is this black magic!?&quot; The orc questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the power of the gods my beloved prey, and it was given to me to do as I please! Now give me all that you have so I may evolve into a being that would rule this world! You should be honored to be my first catch. Muwahahaha!&quot; Pierce monologued feeling like a true emperor, or imperor for the first time in his life.</p>
