<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...yourself, or at least the male version of you. He was wearing your usual clothing, looked the same, spoke the same, etc. In other words, &quot;wtf?&quot; Was all you could think. Nothing about what was happening was making any sense anymore. The male you closes the distance between you and crouchs down offering to help you, which you accept.<br />
<br />
With his help, you manage to get back up to sitting on your bed, and he even further helps you out by putting the high heeled boots onto your feet. Even you are not sure why he is so eager to help you, or why you feel so comfortable about accepting his help, but at the moment, you didn&#39;t really have the luxury to care, as you just really needed his help doing a lot of things. Mainly because of just how sensitive your body was, and how weak and restrictive it had become. <br />
<br />
Once you were standing up on, and  stabilized on your heels, did you finally lower your guard a bit. You were about to ask your numerous questions when he beat you to the punch. &quot;Wow, I can&#39;t believe that you really do exist. I was just filling in that questionnaire for fun, and never expected it to be genuine. I mean who names their daughter Titties?&quot; <br />
<br />
For some odd reason, you took great offense to that, even though you felt the exact same way. &quot;My mother named me that, asshole. I actually like my name too.&quot; you find yourself automatically replying, with an obvious tinge of anger in your voice. The male you recoiled a bit and apologized for it. Seeing him like that brought up an odd feeling of attraction towards him inside of you, as well as a sense of calmness from just being in his presence. You realized that if he hadn&#39;t shown up, you likely would have been freaking out a lot more. <br />
<br />
The male you took a seat beside you and began combing your hair. You let him do his thing, feeling slightly happy for some reason. You turn your back to him to give him a better angle to work with and begin idly chatting. Talking about various things, such as how you answered the same questionnaire, but wrote yes for the last answer. Apparently that ink smudge wasn&#39;t covering anything, and it literally was asking you if you wanted to become or stay yourself and just date your dream girl. Having written yes to it, explained why you were now a girl named Titties. <br />
<br />
Once all that was cleared up, you let out a sigh, reluctantly accepting your current fate, for now. It could be worse, you guessed. At least you were a total goddess in terms of appearances, had an exorbitant amount of money after checking your bank account, and had a boyfriend who both lived together with you and would care for and help you when you needed it. <br />
<br />
Speaking of needs, you had begun to notice this a few minutes ago, but didn&#39;t want to interrupt your boyfriend while he helped you comb your long hair. Your boobs had begun to ache a bit as pressure  was being built up inside of them, and a similar feeling was happening in a spot a bit below your stomach. You had a really good idea why too. Producing milk and laying eggs were what made you unique compared to other girls afterall.<br />
<br />
An alarm went off on your phone, signaling you that it had turned 7:42 am. The second it went off you felt your pussy begin to pulse and quickly got off of your bed, and squatted down. You felt your legs bind up, forcing you to keep this posture. But then your boyfriend pucked you up in his arms and carried you over to a pile of assorted fabric on the ground in the corner of the room. It looked like a nest made out of cloth, which likely was exactly what it was. You couldn&#39;t move too much with your locked up body and the pressure started moving down from the middle of your abdomen to right behind your pussy. <br />
<br />
You gradually started to feel several rounded objects make their way to your cervix as they pushed their way closer and closer to going out of your womb. Finally you felt the first egg leave your womb and travel up through your vagina. Finally your first of many eggs exited your pussy with a bairly audible plop. The small creamy white egg rolled a bit forward, allowing you to get a good look at it. It was very similar to a chicken egg in both size and color, although your&#39;s were more round than &quot;egg shaped&quot;, like a slightly larger pingpong ball. <br />
<br />
The next egg was quick to follow, as was the one after that. 1 after 1, all of your eggs were pushed out until you had a decent cluster of them out infront of you. You felt happy that none of them had broken and a sense of pride in yourself for having laid so many of them. &quot;27 eggs this time&quot; commented your boyfriend who had apparently been keeping count for you. Actually, there were 28 eggs in total, but you secretly kept one inside of you, as it felt nice having it roll around in your womb, and was turning you on. <br />
<br />
However your boyfriend was thinking otherwise, as he suddenly stuck his hand deep inside your pussy and used his fingers to force open your cervix, letting the last egg fall out. You would have been writhing from the explosion of pleasure if your body had not been locked up in your current posture. &quot;And this one makes 28&quot; he says as his hand leaves your pussy, completely coated in cum from the orgasm he just had given you. &quot;Please don&#39;t try and pocket one of your eggs, Titties, it isn&#39;t good for your health&quot; he said with a concerned expression, which suddenly turned into one of embarrassment and shame. &quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, my body just moved on its own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe it was the post orgasm high affecting your reasoning, but you leaned over and kissed him, much to his surprise,  as well as yours. Now it was you turn to get embarrassed, and because of your fetish, a bit horny too. &quot;There&quot; you say while adverting your eyes from meeting his, &quot;now we are even&quot;. <br />
<br />
After a few more seconds, in which you both sat in awkward silence, your muscles finally relaxed, meaning that you could move normally once again. Standing up with a stretch, you finally realize what you just did and the embarrassment it generated nearly made you orgasm again. You sneak a glance down at your boyfriend and feel your pussy become excited at the sight of him. In your head you were cursing yourself &quot;Fuck. This damn body wants his dick so badly that it is even making me somewhat curious about how it would feel and taste. I know I accepted the fact that for now I am Titties, and thus his girlfriend, but do I really have to act like it to the fullest extent too? And the fact that I know that it isn&#39;t small, since it is my own isn&#39;t helping either. Maybe I shoukd just give him a blowjob, just to thank him for everything he has done so far at least. NO! STOP IT BRAIN. I. AM. NOT. SUCKING. HIS. HUGE. DICK.&quot; It ultimatly was sure to be a losing battle within your mind, as the desire to please your boyfriend kept building up along with your arousal. And every second that passed seemed to make you just a tiny bit more accepting of your new life as Titties. <br />
<br />
&quot;What...? Do you need something?&quot; Asked your boyfriend, snapping you out of your internal struggle. You didn&#39;t realize that you were just staring at him for a while now. You quickly look away, again feeling the desires to fuck him or at least suck him off flairing up even higher. &quot;N-nothing. Sorry.&quot; He stands up and walks over until he is directly right in front of you. Even in your heels, he is still almost half a head taller than you. You begin twirling a strand of your hair around your finger as you know that you can&#39;t look at his face or else you will instantly cave in to your desires. However he uses a finger and gently turns your chin to face him. The moment your eyes meat you surrendered to your building lust and pounce on him, wrapping your legs around his waist to keep you up on him as you quickly take his shirt off, wrap your arms around his neck and start making out. You can feel something hard pressing against his pants which is also pressing up against your pussy. The feeling of his hard cock pressing against your labia through his pants is more than enough to get you dripping wet.</p>
