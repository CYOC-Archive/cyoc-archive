<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shelly stepped up to the bus stop, the same one where the old lady had just gotten on after giving me the ring. She sat down, crossing her legs at the knees, and looked in the direction she knew the bus would be coming. I stood just behind her, and off to the side, looking down at her.  And I have to tell you, I liked what I saw.<br />
<br />
My sister was wearing a man&#39;s dress shirt, sort of a midnight blue, unbuttoned enough that I could see he cleavage. Okay, with the wish I&#39;d made, I saw her completely naked for a few seconds, but I was too shocked by the reality to really appreciate it. I supposed the shirt was her boyfriend&#39;s. Did she have a boyfriend? I dunno, she never talked to me about that sort of thing. Below the waist she word capri pants that hugged her hips and thighs, and flared out above her knees. Wedge sandals that let her toes show, painted flaming red.<br />
<br />
All right, I said to myself, this wish thing really works, at least on material items. It made her clothes vanish, then it made her clothes reappear. But could it work on immaterial forces, like a human mind? Time to find out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish,&quot; I thought silently to myself, &quot;that my sister would not think anything I do, between now and whenever we get home, is at all strange or inappropriate.&quot; I put a time limit on my wish just in case it had any negative side effects. Don&#39;t want it turning her insane or anything, right? Then I reached out both my hands, placed them on my sister&#39;s shoulders, and began giving her a massage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, Joey, that feels good,&quot; Shelly said, leaning back into the pressure of my touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like that?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feels nice,&quot; she said. I began moving my hands down her back, pressing deep circles into her shoulder blades with my thumbs. &quot;Do you practice these moves on your girlfriend or something?&quot; she asked with a smile and a wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have a girlfriend,&quot; I said. &quot;I haven&#39;t even dated in over a month. I just, you know, I imagine where it would feel good if you touched me, and do that to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re doing it perfectly,&quot; she said, as I began stroking my hands along her ribs.<br />
<br />
I was astonished to find how rock-hard my sister&#39;s body was to the touch. Astonished and a bit disappointed. Massaging her was like touching solid muscle and bone. I quickly wished my sister had just enough flesh on her body to make her as fun to touch as she was to look at. Just the tiniest amount of cushion appeared under my hands, and I resumed my rubbing.<br />
<br />
My hands drifted down my sister&#39;s body. I encircled her waist, pressing gently into her tummy, before doing slow circles on her hips. As my hands explored my sister&#39;s body, I stood behind her, looking over her shoulder and right down her cleavage. I couldn&#39;t see all my sister&#39;s glory, but I could see where the bra hugged her breasts. The light brown of Shelly&#39;s skin ran all the way down, I noticed; my sister didn&#39;t have a tan line.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I noticed my sister, leaning her body back into mine, didn&#39;t have her eyes closed. She was looking right at my face as I looked down her shirt. At first I thought she would be angry, then I realized her plump red lips had just a hint of a smile on them.<br />
<br />
Of course. I wished she wouldn&#39;t find anything I did strange. Even checking her out in public.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what you see, little brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than you could ever know, sis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shelly stretched her neck up enough to give me a quick peck on the cheek. &quot;You have magic hands, little brother,&quot; she said, then jumped up. I wondered what had changed, then I heard the air brakes of our bus squeaking to a halt. Our ride was here.<br />
<br />
Shelly and I both flashed our bus passes, then found a bench seat together about halfway back. The windows were open, letting a breeze in, and Shelly took the window seat, leaving me the aisle. We sat for a few seconds, my sister looking out the window, me looking at my sister.<br />
<br />
Then, while she watched the traffic and businesses glide by, I reached a hand out and placed it on my sister&#39;s thigh.<br />
<br />
I was just testing, waiting to see how far she&#39;d let me go. She did nothing. So I began moving my hand in slow, sensuous circles on her thigh. Shelly slid over on the bench seat until she was nuzzled up against me, shoulder to shoulder, hip to hip. Then she dropped her head so that her hair rested against my cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to stop with the magic hands just because the bus arrived, baby brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
She whispered it so softly, I would&#39;ve missed it if we weren&#39;t so close together. Weird. Then it occurred to me: she didn&#39;t care what I did. She probably still cared what everyone else did... and thought. And if everyone else on the bus knew her brother had his hands all over her this way, they would think many thoughts, not all of them charitable. So our actions were on public view, but our words were just between the two of us.<br />
<br />
I picked up one of my sister&#39;s hands. I began massaging gentle circles into her palm, tugging her fingers, extending the muscles. She purred and rubbed up against me, so I worked my way up to her wrist. I massaged my sister&#39;s forearm, her elbow, and before I knew it, I was back at her shoulder.<br />
<br />
There was only one more step I could take.<br />
<br />
I made a quick wish that nobody would notice what would happen next, then I wrapped my arm around my sister&#39;s waist. She was older than me, but no taller, and far thinner, to say nothing of being completely compliant; so when I swept my sister up onto my lap, it was as easy as lifting a kitten. I set her down on me so that she was straddling my lap, leaning back against the seat in front of us. Her eyes were half-lidded, her lips turned up in a misty smile. Shelly looked blissed out as she reached her arms up and laced her fingers behind my neck.<br />
<br />
Everybody knows what I should&#39;ve done next, but I guess my old values reared their ugly head, so instead of reaching for my sister&#39;s breasts, I began stroking my fingertips in long, lazy circles on her tummy. Her skin was soft and warm through the man&#39;s shirt she was wearing, and her tight abs provided just enough resistance that her body felt powerful yet yielding, firm yet soft.<br />
<br />
Finally my incestuous lusts reached enough of a pitch to overcome my reluctance, and my hands traced their way up to my sister&#39;s breasts. I cupped them first, pressing them into her ribs, and moving them around slowly. My sister moaned slightly, and her hips began bucking on my lap, so I knew her body was responding to my touch. But just as I wished, she thought nothing strange about the building lust between brother and sister.<br />
<br />
I slipped one thumb down to lift up the tail of Shelly&#39;s shirt, exposing her belly. Yep, just as tanned as her cleavage. I leaned down and stuck my tongue in her belly button, moving it in three quick circles. My sister shivered under my mouth&#39;s attention. I kissed her belly, then looked up at her face, to see her looking down at me through her cleavage.<br />
<br />
The bus was getting close to home. Just a few more stops, and my wish would wear off. I had to choose my next move quickly, before my sister had time to notice what I was doing to her, and what her body was doing to mine.</p>
