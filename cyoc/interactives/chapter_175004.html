<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">But when Ty and the different school classes arrived at the zoo, he changed his mind. Why only change and punish Dustin if he had problems with most of his class, not to mention the other classes? So, he started thinking about who of his classmates was going to be changed and into what. He quickly made a couple of wishes.<br />
“I wish that I remain invisible and unnoticeable to anyone and any animal as long as I am at the zoo and nobody notices me missing. Then I wish that the classes stay together and my class goes to the elephants first. Finally, I wish that while we are here time moves slower so I can watch all the changes happen I want without the classes leaving.”<br />
<br />
While his class gathers to move to the elephants Ty quickly headed there to prepare. Two times someone stepped on his feet, but they never noticed anything. When he arrived at the building besides the elephant enclosure, he started preparing Dustin&#39;s changes, his foster brother would be his first victim.<br />
“I wish that the moment Dustin crosses this door as the last of our classmates he will drop down on all fours but not notice himself. Adding to that after crossing this door anyone but Dustin himself and me will see a young elephant instead of a human in Dustin&#39;s place, which they are allowed to pet. Nobody but me can understand Dustin speaking, as they hear him trumpeting like an elephant instead. He won´t hurt anyone and will soon be led into the enclosure. Dustin will be unable to leave the enclosure on his own anymore once he is inside and the human called Dustin will be forgotten by anyone but Dustin and me. When he is inside the enclosure he will slowly start to turn into a young elephant as everyone sees him already. He will life with the resident elephants, which accept him as one of them as soon as he is inside but won´t come nearer until he is fully changed in body, while his mind stays intact. Finally, I will be able to talk to him telepathically, but my voice will sound like his own, so he will think I´m his inner voice surfacing.”<br />
<br />
Shortly after Ty was finished his class arrived, Dustin at the end of the group, crossing the door last, nobody looked at him at that moment but Ty, so nobody saw the young elephant drop from two legs to all fours behind them. Dustin then said to his friend Mike: “Why do we look at the elephants again, they are so boring.” Everyone turned to the trumpeting young elephant behind them, looking surprised that it was there, as they hadn´t seen it as they came in. Mike moved over and petted his head while saying: “Where did you come from, young one? Enjoying being petted by us, aren´t you?” While the others voiced how cute he was Dustin tried to slap Mike&#39;s hand away, only he felt like he hadn´t the strength to lift his arm up high enough. “Stop this, Mike. I´m no animal for you to pet.” he said irritated, but the rest chuckled at his trumpeting, thinking it was an approval to being petted and started to do so as well, much to Dustin&#39;s annoyance.<br />
Then a caretaker came by and slowly pushed Dustin towards the enclosure saying: “Okay Dustin, I know you like being petted, but now you must go back to your waiting family inside. I don´t know how you left the enclosure on your own anyway.” Dustin protested, trumpeting loudly against being pushed while Ty heard him screaming at the caretaker. “Hey, stop pushing me. What do you mean “back to my family”? I don´t live here, I´m no elephant after all.” But a minute later he was pushed into the enclosure, hammering at the closed door to be let out again while Ty stood next to him in it, wanting to see the changes as near as possible while still being invisible to everyone.<br />
<br />
Ty then started to talk to Dustin telepathically: “You are a young elephant, Dustin, and you belong here. You aren´t human and never have been anything but a young elephant.” Dustin still hammered at the door screaming: “No, I´m human. Let me out again, I´m no elephant.” But the hammering got slower as Dustin&#39;s arms grew heavier so he had to keep them on the ground more. Ty could see Dustin&#39;s arms swelling bigger, soon shredding the sleeves of his shirt. But he remained ignorant to that for now. His legs started to swell as well, making Dustin&#39;s jeans uncomfortable tight until they ripped to shreds, leaving Dustin in shorts instead. The swelling continued down all four limbs, shredding his socks and shoes away. Dustin only took notice of his changes when his hands cramped, merging his individual fingers into a solid mass, stopping his hammering completely. He looked shocked at his former hands, which quickly were covered with a thick, grey skin and turned into mitten-like feet before his eyes.<br />
Again, Ty spoke to him, louder this time: “You still think you are human, Dustin? With that four legs and feet you look like your true self more and more, and that is an elephant. Don´t deny it Dustin. You are an elephant and always have been one. Being human was only a dream of your, Dustin.” Dustin&#39;s voice, in contrast to Ty&#39;s imitating of his voice, got slowly quieter in his screams, as it grew hoarser through his screaming. The trumpeting got quieter as well. “Please help me. I´m no elephant. Being human wasn´t a dream, I´m human. Please help.” With his limbs too heavy to lift for his still human body Dustin was mostly immobilized at the door. He started crying for not getting any help, not knowing that nobody understands him or was seeing his changes but Ty.<br />
<br />
But the changes continued nevertheless. His body started growing, mostly around his stomach. It was inflating outwards, soon shredding the lower half of his already damaged shirt, exposing it. His ass followed suit, letting the rest of his jeans turned shorts rip up more, until it gave way completely. His boxers didn´t take much longer to follow the jeans, leaving Dustin&#39;s ass, cock and balls out in the open. While his ass swelled further at its center sprout a thin tail out, ending in a tuft of fur in the same grey color as his skin turned when the swelling finished. The top half of his shirt ripped in half as his shoulders grew bigger, leaving Dustin completely naked.<br />
When only his head, cock and balls remained human Ty choose to speak with him again, even louder than before. “Are you still denying that you are an elephant, Dustin? You clearly are, why would you think otherwise? The sooner you embrace your true being, the better you will live here with your family. You aren´t human, accept it. You never were.” Dustin was still crying and denying. “No, I´m human. I will never accept being an elephant, as I´m not. Please someone help me get out of here.”<br />
That was when Dustin&#39;s nose started to grew longer and more flexible, turning into a trunk. That took his human voice away as well, at least for himself. Ty was still able to understand his frantic trumpeting, as his teeth grew bigger, two even growing out into big tusks. He could feel his hair receding into his skin, turning a rough grey instead. His ears started to expand, increasing Dustin&#39;s hearing tenfold. There were still his classmates talking about how cute the young elephant Dustin was. He kept his eyes, only growing slightly bigger inside his growing head.<br />
<br />
When his head was finished, Ty spoke for the last time to him. “You are an elephant, you have been your whole, short life Dustin. Maybe you will forget that dreams of being human when you cum for the first time in your life.” Adding his spoken wish, which Dustin couldn´t hear due Ty still being unnoticeable: “I wish that Dustin will cum and shoot away his humanity while his cock changes. He will still keep his mind, but be unable to act on the human side of it. He will gain memories more fitting his new life, but his old ones will be deep down still. I will still be able to hear his thoughts through. And the shreds of his clothes will vanish as well, leaving with his humanity.”<br />
Meanwhile Dustin trumpeted out: “I&#39;m no elephant. Being a human is no dream of mine, it’s what I am. And I&#39;ve cummed more times than I could count dammit. That feels weird.” His cock grew erect in a way he had never felt it before and as he cummed finally, his cock and balls turned into their new form. Dustin lost any form of control of his body, while his mind was assaulted by memories of growing up as an elephant, pushing his human memories into the back of his mind. He gained new instincts and knowledge of his training by the caretakers all his life with his big family. His mental state was split between his two beings. <br />
Ty could hear his thoughts fighting with each other and grinned. The human part screamed: “I´m human. There must be a way to regain control and turn back. Why did nobody help me?” The new elephant answered calmer: “Human? We have never been human. We are an elephant. Look, our family came to us to celebrate ourselves becoming a bull now.” The argument went on and Ty took notice that the human part of his former foster brother was losing, slowly getting pushed back. Even when the pattern of his thoughts remained human-like, the elephant won the fight. Ty smiled at how happy the family was now and decided to leave them alone. After all he had more people to change and Dustin was happy now, at least his new self. His old one was sulking deep down, unable to accept his changes but also unable to do anything about it.<br />
<br />
Ty left through the door he and Dustin had entered through and thought about who to change next and into what. He could easily wish them to come to him for the changes after all.</p>
