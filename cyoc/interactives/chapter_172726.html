<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So as a reasonable adult he decided to go back to the living room.<br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s their problem now. How should they know that it was this perfume&#39; Cindy thought while walking back to the living room.<br />
<br />
Tanya showed to the Kiira where the nearest bathroom in their house was. Kiira thanked Tanya and then proceeded inside. The bathroom filled Kiira&#39;s nose with the most wonderful aroma what she could smell.<br />
<br />
&#39;Aah, what the most loveliest perfume. I should get one at some point&#39; Kiira thought.<br />
<br />
While she sat on the toilet. She felt something pushing her abdomen.<br />
<br />
&#39;Must be the baby. I hope he calms down&#39; Kiira thought<br />
<br />
The pressure inside the stomach started to pinch her a little bit more.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ugh. What is he up to now. He hasn&#39;t been this active ever.&#39; Kiira thought while holding her swollen belly<br />
<br />
Kiira&#39;s belly&#39;s strechmarks started to rapidly expand once more since the baby inside was a she. As it would have it the label&#39;s warning was expanding Kiira&#39;s baby&#39;s breasts very rapidly.<br />
As Soon as Kiira finished her bowels the abdomen&#39;s pain just got more intense.<br />
<br />
&quot;uuughh....&quot; Kiira moaned as she approached the sink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, shit, I think I need a painkiller...&quot; Kiira said out loud while rummaging the bathroom for quick relief.<br />
<br />
Kiira&#39;s stomach in other hand was rapidly expanding. Her belly from outside perspective looked like she was having quadtruplets. Kiira didn&#39;t notice this since she had gotten so used to her huge belly. Kiira couldn&#39;t tell difference between big and huge belly. In the mirror she could only she her heavily sweating forehead and shoulders.<br />
<br />
Suddenly her legs started to feel weak.<br />
<br />
&#39;Did I get sick or something&#39; Kiira thought while very slowing lowered herself towards the floor.<br />
<br />
She then quickly tapped her pelvis area to she if it was wet or damped. No, it wasn&#39;t. It was dry as desert.<br />
<br />
&#39;Strange. If I am not in the labor. What could this be&#39; Kiira thought.<br />
<br />
Then sharp pain jolted her whole body and she let out a scream as response. Tanya heard this and rushed to the bathroom to check if Kiira was alright. She noticed Kiira on the floor with a bigger belly than what she just had moment ago. Kiira&#39;s face was red as tomato and she was sweating a lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kiira are you alright?&quot; Tanya asked while rushing next to her friend. &quot;Is it the baby?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so.&quot; Kiira responded while Tanya helped Kiira to stand up once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit you are heavy.&quot; Tanya said while trying her best to rise Tanya from the floor. Tanya thought that she started weight more than 300 pounds at this point.<br />
<br />
With their both effort they got Kiira out of the bathroom while her belly kept expanding. Kiira moaned and pleaded to have a painkiller as fast as possible. The pain in her stomach was unbearable at this point.<br />
<br />
Tanya thought that she should take her to the hospital, but wanted to help Kiira to much more comfier living space. At the same time Tanya&#39;s breasts started to expand at moderate rate.<br />
<br />
As soon as Kiira was dragged to the living quarters. Cindy looked in horror her stomach. Cindy knew what was going on and looked in Kiira like a ticking time bomb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Cindy could you quickly grab the painkiller. I think Kiira is not feeling well.&quot; Tanya yelled to Cindy.<br />
<br />
Cindy quickly jumped from the sofa and went in her room to get her own painkillers. She knew that bathroom had the painkillers for everybody, but she tried to avoid that place as much as plaque.<br />
<br />
While Kiira and Tanya got Kiira on to the Sofa. Kiira&#39;s stomach was swelled so much that blood veins started to show up. The rapidly expanded stretch marks also made Kiira look like a eldritch horror monster. Kiira yelled in pain and sweated like crazy. She now noticed her massive belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whaaaa... the.... fuuuuck.. is this...?&quot; Kiira asked while panting heavily from the pain and pressure.<br />
<br />
Tanya looked in horror as her friend kept swelling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kiira, I am going to call the ambulance. I think this is something that painkillers can&#39;t fix.&quot; Tanya said while dialing up the 911.<br />
<br />
Tanya&#39;s bra felt super tight as she typed the numbers on her phone. She started to dredge that the whole house was haunted to cursed. Was there a gas leak or something worse.<br />
<br />
Tanya&#39;s phone was picked up by a lady in the call center.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, this is Michael Iesus speaking. How can I help?&quot; said the receptionist in Tanya&#39;s phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, so, this is Tanya... *ugh* from the campus side. I think my friend is having some sort of poisoning or an allergic reaction.&quot; Tanya explained while quickly removing her bra. Kiira started to whine as her belly now was so big that she could have been having nine babies.<br />
<br />
&quot;So an allergic reaction. Is she still breathing?&quot; Receptionist Michael asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but she looks super depressed and yea, she is also pregnant. So could we get an ambulance. Quickly. Please.&quot; Tanya plead on the phone. She also noticed that her friend&#39;s head was now red. Veins in Kiira&#39;s stomach started to pulsate and the strechmarks around the belly were about to burst.<br />
<br />
&quot;PLEASE! My friend might be dying here! PLEASE! HELP!&quot; Tanya screamed as she felt ther breasts expanding two cup sizes further.<br />
<br />
Kiira couldn&#39;t hold her voice. She started to cry, scream and moan. Tanya petted her Kiira and tried to ease Kiira&#39;s pain with whatever she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanya...&quot; Kiira said with exhausted and raspy voice.<br />
<br />
She let out a huge scream as her belly finally popped. The skin teared in front of Tanya while Kiira let out a final screech out of her mouth. The whole living quarters were filled with blood and guts. The baby inside didn&#39;t surive. What Tanya could see were two massive isolated breasts sticking out from her friend&#39;s belly. <br />
<br />
Tanya couldn&#39;t see, hear, think or do anything. She looked in disbelief this whole situation. Her friend was dead. That was the only fact that she could understand. Kiira&#39;s salivated open mouth and dead staring eyes was the only thing what Tanya could see in front of her. This was like something out of the movies. Was this real?<br />
<br />
Cindy was hiding in her room. Crying. Se heard the whole think. Cindy couldn&#39;t face all this. She knew that if she told Tanya what she had just done. She would go to the prison. She wanted to crawl under the bed.<br />
<br />
Tanya in living quarters kept staring the gore scene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello!? Hello!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you still in there. Miss. What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
The only voice what was filled in the blood red room was receptionist.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have send help! Don&#39;t worry. Everything will be safe!&quot; Receptionist yelled on the phone.<br />
<br />
Tanya&#39;s mind was switched off. She couldn&#39;t move. She could just only stare.<br />
<br />
Then...</p>
