<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian sat and watched as Brittany moved about in a semi-graceful manner, moved and taken by the way the five year old girl communicated a whole story and set of emotions just through the act of dancing. Next to him, Jodie also watched and after a moment, she commented, &quot;She really has talent. Even our mother and her older sister, my younger sister, Allison says so. Of course, she sometimes acts real jealous about our youngest sister's talents. But hey, siblings and their rivalry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, barely listening to the sixteen year old girl talk, Brian only thought about one thing, wanting to join the girl out there and maybe express the same thing she was. After a moment, he quietly asked, &quot;How much do classes here cost?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About fifty dollars a month,&quot; Jodie responded. &quot;The first month, though, costs the most. But for eighty five dollars, you get a uniform and the insurance coverage that protects you if you have any accidents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, thinking and watching the girl, Brian noted that the entire class was all girls, ranging from what looked to be about four to the oldest appeared to be about Jodie's age. Suddenly realising what he was thinking and where he was, Brian felt that conflicting feeling returning and glancing about, he stood and began to leave, but stopped when Jodie asked where he was going.<br />
<br />
&quot;To the bathroom,&quot; he answered without giving it a second thought.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, Jodie just commented, &quot;Well, try to hurry back. Brittany is almost done and I promised your mom I'd get you dinner.&quot; and then turned her attention back to watching the girl's move about in their graceful to semi-graceful movements.<br />
<br />
Unsure why Jodie had just said what she had just said, Brian nodded and decided that he did indeed need to use the bathroom. Heading out of the main hall, he head for the bathrooms and without really thinking about, walked into the girl's toilet, his mind on other things at the moment as he stopped in front of the sink and gazed at his reflection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something isn't right,&quot; he thought as he ran a hand through his hair, thinking that it felt and looked a little fuller then the last time he had looked in a mirror.<br />
<br />
Turning on the tap, he splashed his face with cold water and turning off the tap, Brian dried his face, turned away from the sink and headed for the nearest stall. Engaging the locking mechanism, he push his pants and underwear down a bit and sat down on the toilet, barely aware that he was about to pee like a girl would as he tried to sort out his thoughts and why it was he suddenly felt the need to feel pretty and so feminine.<br />
<br />
Several voices could suddenly be heard as a door opened somewhere nearby and listening to the girls chatting, Brian realised that he had gone into the girl's lavatory without thinking about it.<br />
<br />
Scared and embarrassed, he finished what he was doing, not even paying attention when he grabbed a bit of toilet paper and wiped the tip of his penis, and standing, he prepared himself to face the music as he pulled up his pants and opened the door, stepping out into the main area before the sinks, prepared to apologise.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, the three girls standing before the sink said nothing about a boy being in the girl's toilet and the most he got from them as he stood there was one of them commenting, &quot;Aren't you a cutie. Are you here with you mommy?&quot; to which Brian found himself numbly nodding in response as one other girl's commented to another, &quot;Isn't she a shy one.&quot;<br />
<br />
The feeling of being conflicted returned and approaching the sink, Brian began to wash his hands as the three girls returned to doing whatever it was they had been doing before he had exited the stall. His hands washed, Brian dried them on a piece of paper from the dispenser and casting one last look at the girls, he hastily exited the bathroom, promising himself that from now on he would pay more attention to where he was going and not use the girl's lavatory when he had to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where have you been?&quot; a voice asked him and turning, he found himself looking at Jodie, who immediately took his hand and said, &quot;The dance instructor is getting impatient and you haven't even changed yet,&quot; as she led him down the hall.<br />
<br />
Confused, Brian struggled to come up with an answer, but found himself at lost as to what he should say as Jodie announced, &quot;Your mother worked hard to convince my father that you have real talent. And you do have real talent. You and Brittany could actually make a career out of this, if you wanted. This is a rare gift that many have to work for that comes so natural to you and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning his attention elsewhere as the girl continued on, Brian wondered what had just happened and when it was that he had been enrolled in the same dance studio that Brittany attended. As he thought about this, the weird feeling of ease slowly came over him and after a bit, the only thing he really wanted was to look pretty and being led into the dressing room, he barely gave it a second glance as he extracted his hand from Jodie's and headed for the locker he knew to be his. Opening it, he immediately began to take out a pair of whitish-pink tights, a pair of slippers and a whitish-pink dress that was all one piece.<br />
<br />
As Brian began to undress, and Jodie stood off to one side, he thought, &quot;She really is right. I do have talent and my best friend Brittany even agrees.&quot;</p>
