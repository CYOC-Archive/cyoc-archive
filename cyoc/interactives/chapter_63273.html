<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The night after the reception went quietly. Molly and I agreed to get up early to head back to Columbia Falls and our cabin. When we had first moved out to Montana, it was a new place that we had never been to before. Yet now, after living there for nearly a year, it was home. Visiting Peoria and my folks was nice, but Bandhavgarh cabin was home. Both Molly and I were ready to go back.<br />
<br />
The night went quietly and both Molly and I slept well. No sounds of roaring lions were heard in the distance as we went to bed. I guessed that both Leon and Jacki were adjusting to being the opposite gender of which they had been born and having sex right away would have complicated it. Although, Molly and I didn't know where Leon and Jacki were living at present, so for all I knew, they could be far enough away from where my parents lived that even if they had fully adjusted, we wouldn't hear their roars.<br />
<br />
To some extent, I did have the idea to mate with Molly that night, but the fact that my parents were just across the hall, the sound of mating tigers would probably be disturbing and would keep them up. Again the biggest plus of Columbia Falls and where our cabin was. We were situated just far enough out that the distances would be enough that we wouldn't keep the town awake when we were roaring... for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
The Saturday morning after the wedding was almost as hectic as the day of the wedding itself. Just about everyone got up early. My father got up early for work. Molly, Frank Rhoer, and I got up early to begin getting ready to head home. My mother got up early to help us get ready and to be there to say goodbye when we left.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was good to have you and Molly visit,&quot; Polly Wayne said with a smile as she shuffled between the oven and the stove working on breakfast for Molly and I, &quot;and I mean that you stayed here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're family, mom,&quot; I answered, &quot;economically it was easier for us to come here... but we knew we would be here for the wedding and figured it best to visit you and dad as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Polly Wayne gave a soft smile, &quot;I know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She just suffers from &quot;empty nest syndrome&quot; every now an then,&quot; Jacob Wayne commented as he ate a bowl of cereal, &quot;Her baby boy isn't here and isn't a baby anymore and she misses having her baby boy there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jacob!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it's not like I don't entire not suffer from it too!&quot; Jacob retorted, &quot;I would have liked to be there to see him work on the cases that have been thrown his way out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
That ended the &quot;almost argument&quot; between them. My mother returned to finishing our breakfast while my father concentrated on finishing his.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how do you plan to get out to your cabin?&quot; Polly Wayne asked, &quot;I'm sure it'll be the same route you came... but do you have any side trips or anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;We plan to try and get home as quickly as we can. Make sure our cabin is still standing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure it still is,&quot; Jacob Wayne chuckled, &quot;but we both understand. It was good to see you both, and both Leon and Jacki seemed pleased to have you both attend the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly and I both nodded. After breakfast, my mother followed us out as Molly and I began loading our things into the bed of my truck. Frank Rhoer helped as well, though there wasn't all that much that actually needed to be loaded. My father had already gone work when we were ready, so it was all up to my mom to say the last goodbyes.<br />
<br />
As we loaded the last of our things, we turned to receive a firm hug from her and and repetition of her enjoying our visit. We told her again that we enjoyed visiting, and she managed to wrangle a promise out of Molly that Molly would let her know when I'd gotten Molly pregnant. Not that she truly needed to. Things had progressed enough that it was likely that Molly and I would &quot;busy&quot; when she came into heat again in the coming winter. And if successful, we had full intention of telling my mother that she was about to become a grandmother... but that was likely still in our future.<br />
<br />
&quot;We love you, mom,&quot; I told her and nuzzled her cheek while Molly nuzzled her other cheek.<br />
<br />
Our signs of affection also managed to tickle her neck with our whiskers, but my mother only hugged us tighter. Once that was finished, we loaded up into the backseat of my Ford Ranger and our journey home began.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think that was a nice visit,&quot; Frank Rhoer commented as we got onto the main highway/interstate that would lead us home, &quot;Your parents are very good people.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and looked down to see Molly nodding off, resting her head against one of my arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;They always have been,&quot; I nodded, &quot;So, other then having to deal with Molly's parents, what did you think of your time in Peoria with us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a good time,&quot; Frank Rhoer replied, &quot;I talked with your mother and helped her with some of her projects. I toured the city once to see what had changed since I had last been here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When was that?&quot; I wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before I joined the army in my younger days,&quot; Frank Rhoer replied, &quot;Molly, here, wasn't even a twinkle in her father's eye...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was an awkward silence for a moment before Frank Rhoer sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still can't believe that man,&quot; Frank Rhoer grumbled, &quot;to forsake his own flesh and blood... it's no wonder that you were so hyper-protective of Molly when you two first moved out to Columbia Falls. Her parents behaved... well... like they weren't parents. You were well within your rights to be angry...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but I probably still overreacted,&quot; I sighed, &quot;I took Beauregard's actions personally and wasn't inclined to believe that you were only working for him... I didn't get honest proof until Officer Barnes and I saw his R.A.M. membership list.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Water under the bridge, or over the dam, wherever it goes,&quot; Frank Rhoer replied, &quot;We've both patched things up... and you and Molly have given my family the chance to be able to stay in Columbia Falls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For considerably less money,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll manage,&quot; Frank Rhoer shrugged, &quot;and besides, remember that Meredeth and Nessie have had time for some side jobs besides. We won't be in financial trouble, yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear,&quot; I nodded and gave a small yawn. A good part of me was heavily tempted to put my head down and join Molly in sleeping.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what would you actually think about your mother's idea?&quot; Frank Rhoer wondered, &quot;stopping off somewhere along the way. The Badlands has some great views, and Mt. Rushmore isn't too much of a diversion from our route.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not this trip,&quot; I yawned again, &quot;maybe in the future when Molly and I are looking for activities to give a young cub or cubs some adventure... but not this trip. Right now, the only thing I want is to go home... I'm sure you're anxious to see your daughters again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like to see them find their Mr. Right, if you know what I mean,&quot; Frank Rhoer replied, &quot;or at least find the opportunity for them to catch a break. Your part of the ranch is just small enough that I don't need to have them there all the time, which isn't fair to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marriage isn't everyone's key to happiness, I guess,&quot; I commented, &quot;it's made Molly and I happy... but that may not work for everyone. It's entirely possible that we put too much emphasis on things like marriage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank Rhoer only nodded. After a few moments he spoke again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can go ahead and rest if you're feeling sleepy,&quot; Frank Rhoer answered, &quot;I'll let you two know when its time for lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The journey back to Columbia Falls took a shorter amount of time then the drive to Peoria did. Mostly as the drive down was more relaxed and we stopped for the night at six and no later. On the drive back to Columbia Falls, however, we drove as far as we could before stopping. It meant that the hotels we stayed in were much smaller and not well known as the ones we'd stayed in on the way to Peoria, but we managed. The portable dividing wall that we had bought in Kalispell's Wal-Mart continued to work well.<br />
<br />
The only real problem that we had was that both Molly and I felt rather cramped when we did stop, whether it was for a meal or for the night. Both of us spent a lot of time stretching out our muscles when we stopped. While riding we talked with Frank Rhoer or slept. Most of the conversations focused on things related to the future. He knew that Molly and I wanted children, and asked if we had any preset names for our future cubs. The answer to that was a no. Molly and I wanted cubs, but there were no real plans, yet, as Molly wasn't pregnant. He then advised that if we planned to have a family, that it was best to prepare things financially for having a family before Molly came into heat again.<br />
<br />
Frank Rhoer listened to the radio when Molly and I were sleeping, as I could hear it on when I nodded off, and it was still on when I woke up from the nap. It did help him keep awake, and much of the time when Molly and I were awakened from our slumber in the backseat it was because he was pulling into a gas station to fuel up or to get a soda or coffee... or both.<br />
<br />
The really long part of the journey came on Monday morning to early afternoon. We made it to Billings, Montana the night before, when Frank Rhoer couldn't drive any further. After that, Molly and I were both up with the expectation of being back at our cabin soon. It went along with how we saw the cabin that we lived in as &quot;home&quot;. We knew we were nearly there, and were eager to look around a corner and see Bandhavgarh Cabin standing on the hillside outside of Columbia Falls. This distance didn't change, however, and it wasn't until early afternoon that we actually made it back to the cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here we are,&quot; Molly spoke with a smile when we finally pulled up into the driveway in front of our cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I nodded and nuzzled Molly, &quot;here we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank Rhoer pulled up as close as he could before stopping the truck and letting Molly and I climb out and stretch our legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to stay and rest for a little while, Uncle?&quot; Molly asked, &quot;after all the driving you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Frank Rhoer answered, &quot;I'll help you two unload your things, then I'll call Meredeth or Nessie to come pick me up. I'm due for a good nap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a guest bed you can use,&quot; Molly offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for the offer, Molly,&quot; Frank Rhoer answered, &quot;but I think I'll sleep at home. Besides, I'd think the two of you have your own business to attend to today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly slowly nodded, &quot;at least come inside to make your call and wait for Meredeth and Nessie. You'll be more comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Frank Rhoer sighed, &quot;Okay. I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
We then unloaded our belongs and the igloo, which because of the hurried pace to get home still had some meat in it. I took the igloo to our deep freeze while Molly took her Uncle upstairs to call Meredeth or Nessie. The missions were done quickly and ten minutes later, Nessie drove up to the cabin to pick up her father. Molly and I showed Frank Rhoer out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for driving us, Uncle,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;we couldn't have done this without you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's no problem,&quot; Frank Rhoer replied, &quot;and I had a good time... but it's good to be home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That it is, Uncle,&quot; Molly told him, &quot;that it is.&quot;</p>
