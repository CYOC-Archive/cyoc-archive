<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, whatever you're gonna do, do it fast!&quot;  Don was a little breathless from the unexpected kiss.  Weird though it had been, it had still been a good one.  He moved his hand away from the back of Chris' head and over his now full erection.  Normally, he'd feel no shame from being naked and hard, but his giant size made him bashful for some reason.<br />
<br />
Chris, for his part, had to forcefully pull himself away from Don.  His mind was awash with lust and emotions he'd never felt with such intensity.  He realized that in the space of just a few minutes, he'd leaped headlong out of the Closet.  He tried to deal with that, and with the surrealness of his giant friend, but it was all a bit too much and so he turned away to put his plan in motion.<br />
<br />
&quot;So just what do you have in mind&quot;, Don called to Chris' back as his small friend walked towards the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Chris, entering the room, called back over his shoulder.  &quot;We have to get you someplace open but private, right?  Well, we're in the middle of the damn city, so there's really no open spaces outdoors that won't be full of people on a weekend night.  But the gym will be empty.  There were no games today and I still have a key from my days working on the custodial staff.&quot; Chris routed through the top drawer of his dresser for the copper colored key that would get them into the gymnasium.<br />
<br />
&quot;The gym?&quot; Don called, incredulous. &quot;Just how the hell am I supposed to get there?  I'm like 12 feet tall!  I think someone's gonna notice!&quot;  His momentary hope at hearing that Chris had a plan was dashed now.  He wasn't sure which would be more embarrassing: being seen naked and shrunk, or naked and giant-sized.  He uncupped his hands and glanced down at his crotch.  Everything looked normal to him, but he knew that to everyone else he'd be...well...really big.  He couldn't help but smile a little at that.  There wasn't a size queen in the world who'd reject him now.  He got harder with that thought.<br />
<br />
His thoughts were interrupted when he saw Chris in his peripheral vision.  His friend was standing in the doorway to the bedroom, staring at the site that Don's uncupped hands revealed.  Don covered himself again in a rush of embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Chris, in a voice that had gone hoarse with lust, said, &quot;I have the key to the gym.&quot;  He held up the small metal key and walked towards Don.  &quot;I'll check the hallway to make sure it's clear, then we'll make a dash for it&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;A dash for it?!&quot; Chris responded.  &quot;It's 4 flights down.  This is a *dorm* for chrissake!  I'm gonna be seen!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris felt a flash of impatience. &quot;Well, I was actually thinking you could use the maintenance elevator to get there.  It's a lot larger than the regular elevator and it's in a remote area of the dorm.  Hardly anyone uses it besides the maintenance dudes and they stopped working hours ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Don said, calming a little in the face of Chris' logic. &quot;That actually could work.  But even if we get there...it's the gym, man. Someone still might see...and what if I grow too big to fit in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris sighed.  &quot;Look, let's take this one step at a time.  No one's using the gym now, so it's our best bet on campus.  If it looks like you'll outgrow it, we can get you out through the maintenance tunnel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The what?&quot; Don said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The freakin' maintenance tunnel!&quot; Chris shouted, losing his patience.  &quot;It's how they make large-scale deliveries to the gym and dorm.  It's like 18-feet around and there's an entrance to it off the main gym that leads right outside.  If we have to use it, you'll end up outside behind the main residential building.  You'll probably be seen, but at least you won't be squeezed to death.  Now get up off your ass and move it!&quot;<br />
<br />
This was all news to Don, but Chris knew the ins and outs of the building a whole lot better than he did.  And it was a better plan than he had...which was to say he had no plan at all, except to get out of this dorm room.  So he pushed himself off the wall with one hand and leaned forward onto his knees.  That's when it struck him...his perspective hadn't changed during his quick conversation with Chris.  The floor and wall weren't sliding along his body anymore.  Could that mean he'd stopped growing?  Chris had moved next to Don and reached for the door handle.  &quot;Wait&quot;, Don said, putting a hand on Chris' relatively small shoulder.<br />
<br />
Chris had averted his eyes from Don as best he could while walking towards the door.  Time was of the essence and neither of them could afford more distractions.  But he looked up at Don when he felt the large hand on his shoulder.  The feel of Don's fingers along his upper arm and neck sent a thrill through Chris. His momentary exasperation with Don's unhelpfullness was replaced in an instant with the intense attraction he'd felt before.  He lost himself looking into Don's large, large eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris, I think...I think maybe I stopped growing&quot;.  Don stayed crouched next to his friend, looking around him to see if things looked any smaller.  Chris, for his part, let his gaze wander down the side of Don's naked body and felt things low in his stomach tighten in response.<br />
<br />
15 seconds went by.  Then 30.  Don didn't feel the floor sliding along his bare feet.  Everything seemed stable.  He looked down at Chris whose eyes were roaming slowly up the length of his body.  &quot;Chris...Chris!&quot;  His friend looked up at him.  &quot;I really think I've stopped growing.  Maybe we can wait it out here after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if...?&quot; Chris started to say.  Don interrupted him. &quot;If I start growing again, then we'll make a run for it.  Until then, I'll stay here.  I don't want to run the risk of being seen like this unless I have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris smiled up at Don. &quot;What's wrong with the way you look?&quot;<br />
<br />
Don smiled back.  &quot;Chris, maybe we should have a talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...I'm thinking I want to communicate nonverbally right now.&quot;  And Chris closed the remaining distance between them.</p>
