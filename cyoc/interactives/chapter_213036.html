<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wait! Dad, err, Mike? You&#39;re Mom&#39;s husband, I don&#39;t wanna...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no, no, no! Our bedrooms didn&#39;t swap, see?&quot; Mike gestured around and Jeff&#39;s things were still in place. &quot;The role I swapped with you regarding your mother, was being co decision maker of the household. You are currently my legal guardian with her. In society, you&#39;re the man, and I&#39;m the kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Good. That... woulda been... bad. So you&#39;re still Dad, but I&#39;m in charge?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But am I going to work or school tomorrow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t quite know. I&#39;m seen as a teenager and my company doesn&#39;t hire anyone under 18... This will be exciting to figure out!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh. If I need to go to work, does your work know me, expect me? How can I do your job? But also, the school doesn&#39;t want a middle aged man attending classes for teenagers... and if that&#39;s how they&#39;ll see me, how&#39;s this gonna work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it great getting out of your comfort zone and trying new things? I&#39;ve got an idea, follow me. Hey Hon? I have a quick question, where are you?&quot; The pair found Jeff&#39;s mom in the kitchen beginning dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Mike gave his wife a kiss and grabbed her at the hips, there wasn&#39;t any immediate screaming, so that was a bit of a relief for Jeff. &quot;I remember you mentioned something about a meeting tomorrow morning, I was just curious what the plan was.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! YES! Thank you for reminding me!&quot; She turned to Jeff, &quot;Jeff honey, I have a meeting first thing tomorrow morning and need to get to work a bit earlier than usual, I need to be out the door before 6, could you help get Mike ready and off to work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was shocked but quickly recovered, &quot;Yeah, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, and as for you mister, your paycheck only logged 79.15 hours last pay cycle... You know you need to hit 80 every two weeks! Jeff and I work really hard to keep this place running and your part in this is just to go to work and bring home money but you&#39;re leaving it on the table! You don&#39;t get money if you don&#39;t put in the time... And you are ALREADY THERE! Honestly sweetie, I don&#39;t know what else I can say to help you understand this is for your retirement and all our well being. Have you had that conversation with your boss about a promotion yet? Honey, in the next few years Jeff will go off to college, or get a job and a place of his own. You will need to pick up the slack managing the money and taking care of chores, on top of going to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was Mike&#39;s turn to have his jaw hit the floor. Jeff stifled his shocked laughter, barely. It was just like every missed assignment or less than stellar report card he ever brought home. On the plus side, they understand how their current roles worked better...<br />
<br />
Jeff was called to dinner and found his place was now at the head of the table across from his mother. The new seating arrangement and his dad being talked down to in front of him 45 minutes ago made things a little awkward, which only got worse when his mother began to discuss the nuances of her work day... Jeff realized that suddenly being her responsibility partner, and Dad still being her emotional partner, mom had very little reason to hold anything back from either of them. <br />
<br />
After dinner Jeff began to clear the table only to be stopped by his mother, &quot;Sweetie, let Mike handle it. Could you take care of the mail?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a pile Jeff grabbed and began sorting as his mom retired to the living room and Dad began to do the dishes. Much to Jeff&#39;s surprise there were quite a few things addressed to him and as he began opening everything he found they were all the bills. Mike smirked as Jeff was getting a taste of what its like to be an adult and after shooting Dad several panicked glances, and nervously glancing at his mother in the other room, Jeff straightened up and said, &quot;Mike, I think its about time you learned a little more about finances... After all, Mom makes a good point that skipping out on hours of work hurts us all, and I want you to see that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The smirk on Mikes face immediately turned very sour and Jeff&#39;s face turned bright red as he burst into silent laughter. Mike realized Jeff was just getting the burn out that he could, but was really asking for help in the meanest way possible and had to stifle a laugh of his own while shaking his head in disgust.<br />
<br />
The pair learned quite a few things going through the mail, The house and expenses were in Jeff and his mother&#39;s name, as was the joint account. Jeff&#39;s wallet was now filled with several hundred dollars, medical, dental, vision, credit, benefit, and gift cards as well as a few odd&#39;s and end&#39;s including an old family picture. Mike&#39;s on the other hand was bare holding 2 dollars and an old business card with Jeff and Mom&#39;s cell numbers on it. When they were done paying bills, Jeff found a bank app on his phone which his thumbprint opened, and he began the work of seeing what was left till next payday. Jeff learned how to write checks and address envelopes that evening. <br />
<br />
They went through the process slowly double checking what was entered, for what bill, and if it was in alignment with Mike&#39;s experiences. when they were finally done it was 8:30, &quot;I don&#39;t know what it is but I&#39;m surprisingly bushed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad. You don&#39;t go to bed till after 11 usually, you feeling okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I&#39;m just beat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike left the room saying goodnight to his wife, and went upstairs to get ready for bed. Jeff on the other hand was still wide awake, he went to the living room and collapsed on the couch letting out a big sigh. Mom looked up from the book she was reading and smiled, &quot;Never a dull moment?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled, &quot;Don&#39;t you know it. So you&#39;re excited about your meeting tomorrow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? You picked up on that all by yourself did you?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I may have had a little hint in that it was 99% of the discussion.&quot; Jeff smiled back. &quot;You&#39;re going to do great mom! I believe you are going to be leagues beyond what they are expecting and they will promote you to CEO just because they like you so much...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HA, if only, that sounds like something Mike would say...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just meant I believe in you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you honey, and thank you for supporting me with Mike today, I doubt he enjoyed going over household finances...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff let out a chuckle, &quot;It wasn&#39;t the highlight of either of our evenings, but he got the jist of it and I&#39;m pretty sure he will think twice about getting back from lunch late.&quot; Jeff was actually referring to himself picking up on the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m going to try to sleep early, early start and all... Gotta do all I can to support my number 1 Mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff went upstairs quietly and knocked on Mike&#39;s door. &quot;Come in&quot; came Dad&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I just wanted to check up on you, we both wanna keep this up, things have already gotten a little weird and I want to make sure we are both good with moving forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah about that zinger earlier, that was pretty rough...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know! I got you good!&quot; Jeff was beaming and animated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I just don&#39;t want you getting too big for your britches...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DAD!&quot; Jeff pressed his hands against his upper thighs bringing the disproportionately large penis and bulbous testicles into clear view despite the thick denim. &quot;That is exactly what you specifically ensured happened. Please make up your mind.&quot; Jeff had a giant grin, knowing that he zinged his father again...<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, poor choice of words, touché.&quot; Mike was smiling despite himself. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m good with trying tomorrow if you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay kiddo, but do you want me to read you a bedtime story? Tuck you in? Kiss you goodnight?&quot; Jeff asked making a silly voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve gone mad with power... get outta here and let me sleep.&quot; Mike laughed.</p>
