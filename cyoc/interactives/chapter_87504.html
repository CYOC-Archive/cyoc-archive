<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan decided to try on the size 14 roman sandals, thinking that they would at least be nice to try on, even though they seemed quite weird as to why they were highlighted as &quot;roman&quot;. Despite this they seemeed to fit perfectly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, not bad,&quot; muttered Ryan under his breath, he sighed in frustration. &quot;Kinda weird how they fit though, I&#39;m not size 14.&quot; Ryan was just about to take them off, when his hands suddenly went through a burning sensation as he touched the sandals, he cursed to himself looking at his hand which had no burns. He looked down curiously at his shoes, until he felt his feet tingling. &quot;What the fuck?&quot; Ryan then started to feel his body changing, as his back and legs expanded, making him have a new height of 6&#39;4. He quickly tried to exit the changing room but instantly fell over, as if he was purposely tripped over. He looked down to see and feel his calves expanding, becoming muscled and athletic. His trousers changing to be Roman soldier armour. &quot;No! Somebody stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan groaned again as he felt his abdomen changing, he felt a six-pack form in his abdomen, he tried reaching for the door whilst still reeling on the floor trying to escape and prevent further changes, the transformation bringing so much pleasure he could not vocalise his despair but instead simply moan and groan as the sandals continued to change him. He felt his biceps soon thicken and become muscular whilst his shirt changed into a Roman soldiers torso, and fit with armour. His tone changed to become muddy and dirtier looking and he quickly noticed this, trying to clutch at his skin to prevent any more changes. His feet wiggled as their tone changed. His fingers involuntarily wiggled as well as they changed, and his pecs involuntarily bounced as the tone washed over them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please help,&quot; Ryan managed to quietly moan however no one could help him now, as his biceps were now muscular he felt the changing sensation reach into his neck. He cluthed his throat as his adams apple grew alongside his neck, his groaning become more deep. &quot;No.&quot; He muttered and he realised his voice was much deeper and sexier souding than it had been before. He managed to glance in the mirror as he felt the sensation change his face. A handome dark brown beard grew on his face, looking well-groomed whilst his jaw started to become more chiselled and sexy. His nose becoming less pointed and slightly flatter whilst his ears somewhat grew to accomadate the rest of his changes. His head was fitted with a Roman soldier helmet which he quickly took off.<br />
<br />
For a while the changes stopped and Ryan stood up looking at himself in the mirror. &quot;No, this can&#39;t be happening to me.&quot; Before he could finally rush out the room, he felt more changes on their way as his hair styled itself , and changed colour to a much darker brown. Ryan quickly took off the Roman armour on his chest to look at his sexy toned chest to see a treasure trail and chest hair with the same colour start to grow as well as his hands (which he noticed looked larger and more calloused) have hair grow on the back of them and all the way up to his arms. He felt hair grow on his legs and the tops of his feet also. As he finally believed it stopped, there was one more aspect the sandals needed to change to finalise the transformation. Ryan looked down and suddenly realised what it was &quot;No please anything but that! I don&#39;t want to be a Roman! Please stop-&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he could plead any further he felt his groin change, he managed to peer into his boxers to see pubic hair grow sharing the same dark brown hair as the rest of his body did, he then had to let go as he felt the most pleasuring orgasms he had ever felt in his life, as his penis lengethed to 10&quot; and as it grew, he could feel the climax grow stronger and stronger until he finally ejaculated, the jizz soaking in his new  underwear showing off his sexy rounded ass and his perfect large bulge. He soon opened his new brown eyes and looked at himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I doing here?&quot; He suddenly said, &quot;Shit I&#39;m going to be late for the costume party.&quot; The new Roman Ryan, sexy and handsome looked down at his sandals, as his toes wiggled. His ethnicity now Roman and he was also gay with a foot fetish. He left the store, a new man.</p>
