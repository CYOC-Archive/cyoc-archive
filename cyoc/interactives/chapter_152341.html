<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex looked between the two werewolves but he kept feeling his eyes drawn back to Roc. Even with his furry torso, Alex could see the rounded mounds of his pectorals, the rigid eight pack that made up his abs, and the sculpted lines of his arm and legs muscles. Every time Alex looked in his direction Roc&#39;s tail would wag behind him, as if he knew he was just that much closer to being chosen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roc.&quot; Alex said one he made his choice. The larger of the two wolves grinned gleefully and stood up, the smaller nodded as if that was what he expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Few guys would turn down Roc&#39;s blessing.&quot; Raf didn&#39;t sound upset at all, in face his smile was almost predatory as he looked at the two of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how does this wor...&quot; Alex&#39;s question was interrupted as Roc sat by his side, pulling him in for a deep kiss, stubble roughly rasping along his jaw as he felt Roc&#39;s tongue slide past his lips. He felt Roc&#39;s sharp canines with his own tongue, and Roc&#39;s strong arms wrapping around him. Alex felt himself being lifted into the air, the kiss never breaking for a moment as Roc carried him over to the pile of furs and cushions that must have served as their bed. <br />
<br />
As he was set down on the cushions Roc gave him an eager look. &quot;This will tie us together all night while the magic works, so chose a way that&#39;s comfortable.&quot; Alex thought about it for a moment and remembered watching the two wolves fucking in the woods and rolled over onto all fours, presenting his ass to Roc.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect.&quot; Roc&#39;s voice was a low, pleased, growl. Alex felt something pushing inside of him, but it wasn&#39;t Roc&#39;s cock but one of his fingers, exploring his hole. He expected it to feel rough and uncomfortable without lubrication, but it seemed to slide inside of him as if he was good and lubed up. &quot;You really want this, don&#39;t you? You&#39;re nice and slick.&quot; Alex was shocked for a moment, but he guess it made sense. In a world with only anal, asses might be more like vaginas. But he was surprised his was already changed to match. For that matter he started wondering how reproduction even worked but his thoughts were cut short as he felt something large and hot pressing against his hole. Then it slipped inside of him.<br />
<br />
It stretched him out, Roc was not small in any way, and it hurt a bit, but not as much as he expected. Especially once the tip of Roc&#39;s cock hit his prostate, sending a rippling wave of pleasure through him. Then there was something else, something completely different. A tingle passed through his entire body, like a static charge coursing through him from head to toe. Roc pulled out and slid back into him with another ripple of pleasure and spreading tingle. It took a few thrusts for Alex to realize what that tingle was. Every time he felt it his muscles were growing just a little bit bigger.<br />
<br />
He noticed it first in his arms, propping him up as they were, he saw biceps slowly taking shape and cords of muscle forming in his forearms. Looking under him he could see his pectorals slowly growing from his once flat chest, but it was hard to give himself a proper look, or to stay focused on it with Roc pounding away at him. He falt a hand wrap around his cock, and turned his head to look back ad see Roc reaching around him to stroke him off while he continued to go at him doggy style. All Alex had to do was try not to pass out from the waves of pleasure that were building and threatening to turn his brain into a soft jelly.<br />
<br />
Soon Roc&#39;s thrusts became frantic, and Alex was having his own trouble holding back his orgasm. But something large was pushing against him at the end of each of Roc&#39;s thrusts, and slowly Alex came to realize it was his knot. Then it popped inside of him and the feeling of it sent Alex&#39;s cum spraying across the bedding, but he also felt warmth flooding him from behind as Roc filled him up with his seed. If the tingling thrusts gave him a little jolt of strength, the flood of werewolf seed seemed to supercharge it for a moment. Alex swore he could feel himself get heavier for that instant. And when they both fell to their sides on the furs, he could finally get a look down at his own torso.<br />
<br />
He had pectorals, and an obvious six pack. He wasn&#39;t as muscled as even Raf, much less Roc, but it was a definite improvement on his old scrawny self. He heard not only the panting of Roc behind him, but another, and looked over to see Raf, propped up where he had been jacking off, his chest fur soaked with his own cum. He grinned and winked at Alex when he saw the human noticed him, not ashamed at all.<br />
<br />
Roc started stroking his sides and chest. &quot;You need to sleep. Your body is worn out and the magic needs to finish settling.&quot; And Alex did find himself tired, happily dozing off to sleep in Roc&#39;s arms. He vaguely recalled Raf joining them at some point, first licking him clean with his tongue, then laying down next to him, leaving him comfortably sandwiched between the two werewolves.<br />
<br />
When Alex woke in the morning he was alone on the bedding, but the smells of a cooking breakfast let him know Raf and Roc were still there, along with the hushed growls of conversation between them. He sat up and looked down at himself. He expected it to have all been a dream but he still had the body he briefly caught a glimpse of before going to sleep. He flexed muscles, especially in his chest and arms, fascinated by his own body. He looked like he had the body of an amateur wrestler. He wasn&#39;t lean and svelte like Raf happened to be, though he bet Raf was still stronger, he seemed a bit more.. bulky. Like a smaller version of Roc. There was also something strange in his mouth, and running his tongue along his teeth he found out what it was. His canine teeth had grown longer and sharper, both on top and bottom. Then he reached past his lips and felt at them with his fingers. He remembered Raf saying something about a wolf mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! Fangs! You owe me a silver piece.&quot; Roc suddenly chimed up as he pointed at Raf, having noticed.<br />
<br />
Raf just smiled and shook his head. &quot;Morning! See you found your wolf mark, you&#39;ll want to be careful giving anyone blow jobs with those. Trust me.&quot; Raf flashed his own fangs in a smile. Alex stood up and went to join them at the fire, where Raf offered him a bowl of some meaty stew. &quot;We were just talking about what to do this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Raf and me are going to walk with you to the edge of the woods, but you&#39;ll have to go on your own from there. We have to go meet with our pack.&quot; Roc smiled as he watched Alex eat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or to the edge of elf territory if you want to go that way instead.. but we suggest heading towards Dicktin Village. Our friend there, Leon, he owns the local tavern. He can help you figure out where to go next. The elves.. well.. you&#39;d have to figure that out on your own.&quot; Raf looked Alex up and down. I think we can also get you a pair of boots and something to wear, you should be close enough to my size now that something will fit.<br />
<br />
Alex finally noticed that both wolves were indeed dressed, though not in much. Both had on leather boots that came up to their knees. They looked sturdy and good for walking. Roc wore a loin cloth that just managed to keep him covered and Raf was wearing a pair of supple leather shorts that kept him covered but clung to him, it wouldn&#39;t hide anything if he got hard, neither was wearing a shirt.<br />
<br />
An hour later, Alex found himself in a pair of boots similar to what the other two were wearing, and a pair of shorts, much like Raf&#39;s though a little looser. It would take some time to get used to the feel of the soft leather against his cock as there was no underwear to speak of. They also gave him a satchel he could carry, with some food, water, and a cloak he could pull out to help with the chilly nights.  He asked about a shirt, but they both had laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Folks around here only wear shirts in the cold of winter. This Earth of yours must be weird if everyone is always wearing so much clothing.&quot; Raf explained with a smile. &quot;The cloak will be enough for a chilly spring night.&quot; They spent the next couple hours trekking towards the edge of the woods, deep in conversation. Alex wanted some of his questions answered, but could barely get them out between them asking him eagerly about Earth. Most of the answers they found either amusing or confusing. The fact that there were only two types of human on his world was especially hard for them two swallow. They refused to believe &#39;women&#39; could be the same species as men. Finally around noon they reached the edge of the woods.<br />
<br />
Alex was surprised how well he handled the hike. Physical activity had never really been his thing, but this new body of his didn&#39;t even feel a little fatigued from two hours of walking through untamed woods. They were on the edge of a clearing, and meandering through the clearing was a wide, one end heading off into farmland, the other back into the woods though in a different direction from where they came.<br />
<br />
Raf pointed it out. &quot;Follow it east to get to Dicktin Village, west to get to the elves. If you go stright there you should get to the village by noon tomorrow. One of the farmers on the road migh give you dinner and a place to sleep for a few hour&#39;s labor. This is where we go our separate ways.&quot; Alex quickly pulled Raf into a hug, and Roc sensing the mood wrapped them both up in a tight bear hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop by if you&#39;re in the area, you&#39;re like our half-brother now.&quot; Roc said cheerily as he broke them embrace.<br />
<br />
The pair of wolves turned to head back into the woods, though Raf stopped an turned to Alex. &quot;Oh, and be careful of having sex for the next day or two. Your body still has trances of magic in it. You might end up taking on features of anyone who gets their seed inside of you. Doesn&#39;t usually last more than a couple of days though.&quot; Then the two turned and sprinted off into the woods.<br />
<br />
Alone, Alex took stock of his options..</p>
