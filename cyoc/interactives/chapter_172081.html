<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey listen, I kind of want to run something by you. And I know that it probably will sound like I am crazy, but just hear me out okay?&quot; You as your girlfriend. She agrees and brings you into her room and offers you her bed to sit on. &quot;Alright, what is this crazy idea of yours.?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, okay. Now, what would you say if I were to tell you that I am not the same me that you knew of yesterday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would say you sound insane when you phrase it like that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right, uh... So what if I said that I was a different me, who came from a different universe, and have swapped places with this universe&#39;s me, and have taken over his body?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. That is quite an interesting thought. I guess I could only respond with 3 words. You too huh.&quot; Said your girlfriend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, do you mean that you also swapped?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, 1 year ago to be exact. So I take it that this universe&#39;s me and you are dating still?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we are, or were I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How far did you go with her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We actually had sex pretty often. It was like she was addicted to it. Although I guess that makes sense given how she doesn&#39;t have any experience with a dick prior to last year.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your girlfriend has a conflicted expression now. Bothered by this, you try and find out why. &quot;Did I do something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its... no. I mean you didn&#39;t. Or rather, you couldn&#39;t have known anyways. But hearing you had sex with another girl, even if that girl is technically still me... I don&#39;t know. It just doesn&#39;t sit right. It isn&#39;t your fault though, so please don&#39;t take it like that. I promise you that I don&#39;t blame you at all for what you did.&quot; This was one of the reasons why you loved your girlfriend. She was extremely considerate very reasonable, and will tell you exactly how things are. She hates girls who try and just give hints, or expect the opposite of what they say to happen. If something is bothering her, she will be blunt about it. This was why you both have never had a serious fight before. You both were just upfront about everything with each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I still am sorry that this happened, even if it was out of my hands. And now I can&#39;t even have sex with the real you.&quot; You say, also pretty saddened by the second half.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, silver lining is that we can still have sex with each other, albeit lesbian sex since we are now both girls. You probably don&#39;t know this yet, but a lot of things are different. There is no masculine anything. The concept of a male human just doesn&#39;t exist. Even our species ok longer is called Mankind or Humanity. It is Feminine, and Femininity respectively. Instead of human, it is female. Female also only applies to us by the way. The girls of any other species are just called girl ______. Like the girl dog, the girl pig, etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
It seemed that this universe&#39;s knowledge was very different, even if it used the same terms. This was something you would have to become use to, so you paid attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Additionally, Females don&#39;t reproduce like you expect human to. Since there is just a single gender, we reproduce in a sorta complex way. When 2 females love each other and want a baby, one of them will undergo a small change in that the to-be &#39;mother&#39; will gain the ability to lay eggs. Their first egg will be laid right before they have sex. And will now always lay an egg whenever they become horny. These eggs are special. Their partner must eat them, and digest their contents. What they are eating is a genetic package which will tune their own body to start altering their sexual fluids to be compatible with their mate. After a week since they ate the egg passes, the will be able to impregnate their mate by having her drink their cum. 8-10 weeks later, a large egg gets formed inside the mother&#39;s womb. After another 5 weeks of growing, she lays her egg. and 5 or so more weeks later, a baby hatches. It is much faster than how humans reproduce. But there is never twins or triplets. Only one egg and one baby. Oh, and both parents will begin lactating about equal amounts to fee their baby. Complicated right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Extremely. But I think I understand.&quot; You said so, but you were honestly just so wrapped up in the moment that you didn&#39;t care too much. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna still fuck?&quot; Your girlfriend asks bashfully. &quot;Or did I kind of ruin the mood?&quot; <br />
<br />
You quickly deny that &quot;no no, I am still interested. I just, well. I don&#39;t really know how to do it anymore, is all.&quot; It was the truth, but even so, it still made you feel embarrassed. &quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, I can teach you everything I know. So just let me handle things for today ok?&quot; She says as she starts to kiss you. <br />
<br />
You are surprised at how much you are enjoying kissing your girlfriend. While taking a breath, your girlfriend explains &quot;a female&#39;s lips are more sensitive than your old male ones, so kissing will feel a lot better, even pleasurable for many of us.&quot; She was right, you were actually getting turned on by rubbing your mouths together. You were enjoying kissing a lot, at least until you suddenly felt like you needed to take a shit immediately. Panicking, you break off the kiss and tell her that you need to use her bathroom. However she holds your hand firmly, preventing you from going. &quot;Hey seriously I really need to go.&quot; You could feel your stomach turning as you began cramping up. &quot;Wait, I don&#39;t think its that you need to poop. The timing is just too perfect. I think you might be laying an egg!&quot;</p>
