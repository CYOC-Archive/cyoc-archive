<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite being a few years apart, Mark and Kevin were the closest siblings in the family. They weren&#39;t socialites like their sisters or achievers like they&#39;re brothers. They were satisfied with being their dorky selves. They played the same video games, read the same comics and mangas, and Mark&#39;s friends often have siblings who are Kevin&#39;s friends. The only difference between the two was Mark&#39;s love for buying and fixing up electronics, hence his initial interest in buying the printer. On the other hand, Kevin was obsessed with soccer. It would have been nice if his obsession translated into skill. While he&#39;s been playing the game for quite some time now, he was average at best. It doesn&#39;t stop him from trying to be better, though.<br />
<br />
With the peeled sticker at hand, Mark entered Kevin&#39;s room. Everywhere he looked, the walls were adorned with posters of soccer players. There were a bunch of them, but Mark could only recognize Leone Messy and Noymar. There was a movie poster on top of his computer, but it was Mark&#39;s 10th birthday gift to him a few years ago. Kevin expressed his interest in removing it, but the poster persisted longer than some of his posters. Aside from the mess of posters, his bedroom was one would call a pig sty. Smelly clothes lay strewn on the floor while his mud-crusted soccer shoes lay forgotten beside the door. His soccer uniform was the freshest on top of the pile on his bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mark, what are you doing here? If it was from mom, tell her I&#39;ll take a bath later.&quot; Kevin said before wearing his headset back to play a soccer video game. He made no move to stand, too eager to join his friends for an online match. Mark&#39;s eyes gleamed with wicked anticipation thanks to the opportunity he was given. In his sloppiness, Kevin won&#39;t notice him placing the sticker on his bare skin. With one swift motion, he stuck the sticker on his brother&#39;s back. There was a split second where nothing happened, where his mind was filled with regret of being scammed out of $150. It was an obvious scam, but he fucking fell for it! A second later, Mark felt his consciousness surge forward into Kevin&#39;s body. It&#39;s like he was the sticker himself, him being ripped apart from his physical flesh. The room spun, the posters on the wall blurred into a kaleidoscope of faces. <br />
<br />
Two bodies lost consciousness at the moment, but one was physical enough to plop on the floor. Kevin&#39;s body twitched and spasmed as Mark assumed complete dominion over his younger brother&#39;s body. There was no measure of resistance from Kevin. Kevin simply walked all over him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, are you lagging?&quot; Mark heard someone say. <br />
<br />
Mark looked around and realized it was coming from the headset wrapped around him. His eyes fluttered open and immediately felt the cool air from the AC dance on his skin. The faces on the walls looked larger and more daunting, more cool and awesome! A wave of disorientation swirled over Mark&#39;s head for those weren&#39;t his thoughts. Just as he was about to massage his forehead, he saw how his hand had shrunk in size. Not only that, they were a tad tanner up until his shoulders which bore tan lines from his body&#39;s training under the summer sun.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you still there, dude?&quot; Mark heard Mitch&#39;s voice. Mitch was his friend&#39;s younger brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I– I&#39;m still here,&quot; Mark perked up when he realized he spoke with Kevin&#39;s voice. &quot;I think I have connectivity issues. Go play online or something… I need to restart the router.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Connectivity issues? How the hell are you speaking with me th—&quot; Before Mitch could finish, Mark disconnected their call and turned off the game. He left the swivel chair and moved with an awkward gait toward the mirror. Shrinking a couple inches made each step a struggle. He had to walk more to compensate for the long strides he was so used to. <br />
<br />
Looking in front of him, the boy in the reflection was unmistakably Kevin — the shaggy dirty blonde hair, the muddy blue eyes, and the lightly tanned complexion on his face, arms, and legs. The tan lines on his arm and thighs bore a striking resemblance to the edges of his soccer uniform. He stepped closer into the mirror and pored over every detail as if seeing his brother for the first time. He turned to the side, examining the profile of his brother&#39;s slender frame. He wasn&#39;t this fit when he was this age. And holy! If he flexed just right, he could see the edges of Kevin&#39;s abs. <br />
<br />
&quot;I really am Kevin,&quot; Mark said. With trembling fingers, Mark reached out to touch his cheek. They felt soft beneath his fingertips. He traced the curve of Kevin&#39;s smooth jawline and the edges of his pink lips. <br />
<br />
His hand skimmed lower. They brushed past his neck and collarbone, past the tan lines which grew more endearing by the minute, before pausing at the top of his soccer jersey. He could feel his pulse rising and his warming breath. He&#39;s seen it a hundred times, and a change in perspective will not change a damn thing… or he thought. He hasn&#39;t touched it, not even when they skinny-dipped multiple times in the pool. His hands trembled harder as he reached down, slowly unbuttoning the sweat-soaked shorts. The fabric pooled on his feet and there he was, naked with only white underwear to cover his manhood. <br />
<br />
Peeling those clothes released this wave of stinky musk that should have sent him reeling. He knew how body odor could be attractive to people, but not to Mark. While others would beg to smell a jock&#39;s underwear, he&#39;d rather see it burned in an incinerator. However, being in Kevin&#39;s body made him aware of how attractive musk could be. As the wave of crotch stink passed over his face, the earthy scent simmered within and lit him on fire. It turned all his switches up. It turned him on so much, he sported a painful tent with his borrowed cock. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn! I… I have Kevin&#39;s fucking boner,&quot; Mark cursed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Mark heard a voice across the room and saw Kristoff was already there. Fuck! He was so caught up with having Kevin&#39;s body, that he didn&#39;t realize Kristoff saw him doing things. How does his older brother know?<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t see anything!&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I did. I saw…&quot;</p>
