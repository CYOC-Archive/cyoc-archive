<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, first things first.&quot; You borrowed the Crest from Phil, bringing the lens in front of Racer압 BeastCube and aiming the lens at Racie. &quot;Ready?&quot;<br />
&quot;Do it if you must&quot;, Racie just answered. The laser zapped her, but instead of vanishing completely into the Cube, she transformed back into Annie, as if Racer was sipped out of her. Her hair took on a brighter color of blonde, the aviator압 jacket changed into a flaming red hoodie, and all Sky aspects disappeared. Her facial features followed suit, loosing Racer압 softness and going back to a more cool, sharp beauty that matched Annie압 snarkyness. <br />
&quot;How was it, Anna?&quot;, you used her human name instead of her nickname, &quot;giving low-tier-fodder a go in the sack?&quot;<br />
Your Heatdraka smirked at that. &quot;You really think *I* was the one wanting a piece of him?&quot; She laughed, patting your shoulder. &quot;Maybe I spiced things a little up, but ... oh well. See it yourself.&quot; And with that, she gave her own BeastCube a little punch, zapping herself into it.<br />
You frowned at that, now alone. <br />
<br />
After you said Goodbye to Phil, you set out to Cobalt City. There was a bridge on the way, and you brawled with a handful of trainers on it. A dude gave you a nice price for that, on top of the BeastDollars you earned through the battles alone.<br />
&quot;Woah, how nice of you&quot;, you said to him, holding a shiny orb of pure gold in your hand. &quot;That must be worth a million!&quot;<br />
&quot;More like 5.000&quot;, the generous man replied with a slick grin. &quot;But there might be more in it for a tough lass like you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, really?&quot;<br />
&quot;How about taking a job for Team Missile?&quot;<br />
You frowned at that. &quot;Uh, Team Missile? Should I know, who you are?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why, of course?&quot; He told it to you. You frowned even more. Then you declined. Then you brawled with his weak entourage of Beasties. It was all pretty easy and not worth talking about. Belle was fully capable of holding her own, and at last she even shocked the bad guy from the bridge and into the river, for he was becoming a little ... clingy.<br />
&quot;Good job, Belle, good job.&quot;<br />
A nice warm-up.<br />
No trace of your rival, you thought by entering Cobalt City. Strange. But why thinking about Rick in the first place?<br />
<br />
The Arena of Cobalt City was a swimming pool. A small wellness center full of bikini clad beauties. The hottest girl of all was, of course, Molly, black-haired and with a red swimsuit hugging her quite expansive curves. <br />
Phil had mentioned her Crests ability, it was the leveled-up Pauper Crest Power. Changing the Trainer압 appearance as well as the BeastMon압. So this Boss was a girl, only slightly older than you, but looking old enough to be in her late twenties.<br />
With her hands on her wide hips, she gazed at you, making you feel scrawny and puny. <br />
&quot;Here goes nothing without swimsuits.&quot;<br />
&quot;Pardon?&quot;<br />
She pointed at a door to your right. &quot;There you go, my dear.&quot;<br />
And through the door you went, almost like you were on a daring escape. Holy cow, she had such a demanding attitude! You found yourself in a changing room, with a selection of different swimwear. You frowned at all these swimsuits, but then noticed: All of them had the same measures. You didn앖 have to try on good luck, what a relief! In the end you were a young man inside, not a preteen girl, and you really had no idea of your own measures. Okay, sure, you were flat like a board, but ... anyway.<br />
By beating Molly, you could change that of course ... Thinking about Racie and Josh at the roof of Phil압 cottage was a sudden vision. Oh my. Now you were fired up!<br />
Before leaving the room, you spotted something like ... swimming goggles? But for Cyclopes? There was only one lens in it! But then you saw the poster at the wall above. The goggles were meant to be put on your BeastCube. The lens being put right on top of the laser-device. Why that, was this like the merging Crest? <br />
You walked out in your swimsuit, a plain blue one with small ruffles at the hips. You didn앖 look especially badass in this get-up, but oh well ... you liked blue.<br />
&quot;Uh, is this how I앐 supposed to do it?&quot; You held your BeastCubes up, each one with goggles strapped on them.<br />
Molly nodded, hands still on her hips, chin high. &quot;Exactly, my little Guppy&quot;, she spoke with a demeanor you recognized clearly from Annie. &quot;Now we might allow you into the deep pool.&quot;<br />
You mustered all your confidence. This girl was just a show-off! Looking all grown-up was no big deal for a Trainer, as you now knew, but here she stood like a big shot! Just fry her.<br />
&quot;Okay, here comes the only Beastie I will need!&quot;, you called out, &quot;Go for it, Belle!&quot;<br />
In a flash, Belle appeared. She was not wearing her usual attire, but a swimsuit herself! Surprised about that, her heroic entrance was a little ... less impressive. She landed on one of the floating platforms in the midst of the pool, with a shakily &quot;M濃?&quot; coming out of her mouth. She wore a frilly pink swimsuit with a sheep-print on the front.<br />
Molly smiled at that. &quot;My, a little lamb. Beware, we don앖 like wool in our pool water.&quot;<br />
You balled your fist. &quot;Now summon your Beastie, so we can zapp it away! I will fill this pool with your tears, I swear!&quot;<br />
Molly raised an eye brow. &quot;Spunky, are we?&quot; Then, without further ado, she called out her BeastMon. <br />
Your BeastDex recognized the little orange-haired mermaid with the white and orange tail as Goldia. It was just a small child, not even wearing clothing of any kind on her human upper body, smiling innocent at Belle and romping around in the water. There was a little horn on the fish-girl압 forehead. Would it attempt to headbutt your Donnerm濃? Well, she could clearly try!<br />
The Arena Boss waited a few seconds, letting the impression of a harmless foe sink into you. Then, she placed the BeastCube in dramatic pose on her left breast.<br />
&quot;Now, let me demonstrate the power of Cobalt Cities Arena!&quot; She pressed on.<br />
Molly shrunk, just a little. Not enough to lose much mass, barely noticeable for someone who was new to this kind of power. Her Goldia, meanwhile, changed way more. The little fishy was hit by an impressive growth spurt in midair, just as she jumped out of the water. As puberty hit her bare chest, and it hit her hard, a delicate bra out of fish-skin materialized out of thin air, cupping her swelling breasts like a tight veil. Her hair grew out, reaching her inflating rear. She dived down, then swam back up, landing on the edge of the floating platform.<br />
Belle stepped back a little as the aged up Goldia came up, eyeing her up and down and greeting her with melodious sing-sang. Your sheep frowned; without doubt the mermaid had the same attitude as her trainer.<br />
Molly looked at you, waiting for your surprise. Instead, you shrugged. &quot;Parlor trick. But finally, something to zapp!&quot;</p>
