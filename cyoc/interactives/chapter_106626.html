<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martin Stovall was just preparing for his council meeting. To say he had an interesting morning would be apt. Shortly after arriving in his office to go over his notes one last time; several of the council members were bursting at the seams to let him in on some juicy gossip. While the whole town has yet to find out; almost every elected official heard of Benton’s explosive fit of rage at Tachibana’s head office in town. Martin was shocked; to hear Benton Knight the CEO of Knight Industries a were-panther and a member of the were-council to attack and assault security guards at a rival corporation was akin to career suicide. But that was the tip of the iceberg. The same council members also told him the were council came down hard on Benton last night. Kicking him off the council; they also ordered him to attend anger management classes as well as make restitution to Tachibana. <br />
<br />
Martin just chuckled, “Well this day just couldn’t get any better.<br />
“Brace yourself then,” States one of the council members; “A fourth edict from the were –council bars Benton from sending his daughter away from Moon Lake. She is to take her father’s former seat when she turns twenty one; until then she is to be made available for mentor-ship with another member of the were-council.”<br />
“Let’s not forget she has to testify against my daughter when Julie’s trial commences,” Martin states.<br />
“How are thing proceeding there?” The other council member asks.<br />
“Well, Julie has to enter a plea to the judge on Wednesday,” Martin sighs; “Afterwards her attorney will do what she can to defend her against the prosecutor Jack Johnson.”<br />
“Who is representing Julie?” The first council member asks.<br />
“Brett Smithson,” Martin responds; “Now if that’s the last of the day’s gossip, can I get back to making the final preparations for our council meeting?”<br />
<br />
Both council members agree to Martin’s request and get to leave the Mayor to his job. While the mayor normally didn’t put much stock in gossip that spread among the office; he can’t help but smile knowing the were-panther bully was finally brought to heel. Knowing that Benton might not be attending today’s session; Martin feels a sense of relief that, that weight won’t crush what could be an amazing day for him.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
Samantha Twist the town’s Chancellor was reading over the proposed budget Martin is about to release. <br />
“Can’t deny that the were-mer isn’t good with numbers,” Samantha muses to herself; “This is the first budget where the town will be in the black in terms of finances.”<br />
<br />
Samantha knows that any council member that doesn’t vote for this or tries a filibuster is looking at tanking their career. <br />
“Guess all that’s left to fret over is the revised city ordinance’s being voted on,” Samantha wonders.<br />
<br />
Putting down Martin’s report, Samantha remembers what Frances said this morning.<br />
‘Don’t forget the whipped cream and cherry.’<br />
This makes Samantha smile lustfully at the fun time she will have with her life partner later in the evening.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
The council meeting began just before noon. Martin sitting in the mayoral seat preparing for his moment; with Samantha Twist in the seat next to him. Looking about he sees the dozen or so other council members filling in. While the seats in the gallery for public where general empty. Martin saw several members of the were-council looking on. Martin new they had a right to observe proceedings; he was glad that they rarely tried to interrupt. Save former member Benton.<br />
<br />
Giving to people a moment to settle down, Samantha rises to begin the council meeting in session.<br />
“Before we begin, is there any old business that anyone wishes to discuss?”<br />
With no one answering, Samantha then continues; “Then all please remain silent while our Mayor Martin Stovall presents this town’s fiscal budget for next year.”<br />
Samantha takes a seat and claps as well as all the other council members while Martin rises to begin talking.<br />
<br />
Thirty minutes later Martin finishes his speech and sits down. The room is silent at first then several council member rise up to clap; causing the rest to join in as well as several observers in the gallery. Samantha lets the joyful outburst continue before banging a gavel to podium to get every ones attention.<br />
“Now it is time to vote on whether to accept the new budget or to reject it for revisions,” Samantha pauses; “All in favor of approving the town’s budget raise your hands!”<br />
Every council member raises their hand in unison as well as Martin who has been silent since his speech. Samantha bangs her gavel; “Then it’s unanimous. Budget approved.”<br />
<br />
The council members break out in another round of applause. Martin remaining stoic is thrilled on the inside. He is now the first mayor in the history of Moon Lake to not only put the town in the black; but to get a unanimous vote. Martin wonders if people will remember this when the next election year comes up, or if people will remember what his daughter did and make him pay for it one way or another. His train of thought is broken when Samantha bangs her gavel again to continue the council meeting.<br />
“There is still the matter of the revised city ordinances put forward;” she shouts.<br />
The entire gathering of elected officials once again settles down for the remainder of their session.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
An hour later Martin is back in his office happy that the council meeting when smoothly. Having to leave his phone behind; he sees a missed call from his wife Melissa. Wondering why she was calling for him, he dials home.<br />
Oh Martin, I’m glad you called back,” Melissa responds; “How was the council meeting?”<br />
“It was a smash,” Martin responds proudly; “But that isn’t why you tried calling me earlier.”<br />
There is a silence on the line before Melissa answers; “The Sheriff came by to serve a warrant on Julie’s computer. Apparently he received an anonymous email regarding Alyssa Cooper with a young boy at school. He thought that Julie was the author for said email.”<br />
“Was she?” Martin’s happy mood starting to sour; upon hearing Julie and Alyssa in the same sentence.<br />
“The Sheriff looked and couldn’t find any evidence that proves she sent any emails or was even on her computer; Melissa responds.<br />
Martin in his chair just thinks for a minute before responding; “Where is Julie at the moment?”<br />
“Working on her homework at the kitchen table,“ Melissa answers.<br />
“Okay,” Martin responding; “You and I both know Julie is adept at hiding what she does on her computer. Would you be able to put a key-logger program on her computer without her knowing?”<br />
“If your here to help provide a distraction, then yes;” Melissa answer.<br />
“Alright,” Martin answers; “I still got a few things left to do, but I’ll be home in a few hours. Try to keep Julie off her computer until then.” Martin hangs up and wonders to himself; “What are you up to Julie? What are you scheming this time?”</p>
