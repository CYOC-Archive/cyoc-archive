<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elizabeth leaned in close, her nuzzle mere inches from his face.  His cock throbbed unbearably, aching for release.  Elizabeth suddenly stuck out her long wide tongue out and licked his whole face, coating it in slippery salvia.  He spat, and tried to wipe the fluid off his face.  Elizabeth laughed at his efforts, and shoved him hard into the bed.  His testicles slammed against the side of the bed, causing his erection to instantly lilt and soften.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oops, sorry, &quot; said Elizabeth., as she picked up his wet rag and began to wipe up the fluid around her vagina.  &quot;Guess I don&#39;t know my own strength.  I was just messing with you.  If you really don&#39;t want to fool around, I&#39;m not going to force you to. I&#39;m not a rapist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do you call what you just did? &quot; said Jeff, angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn&#39;t rape.  You wanted it just as much as me.  Admit it, you enjoyed it.  You&#39;re just mad because I tricked you, and now you&#39;re not the only one who is special, &quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t want to admit it, but she was right.  He had a crush on her for quite a while, and had masturbated while imagining making love to her on more than one occasion. He hadn&#39;t seriously pursued her because he didn&#39;t think anyone would be interested in someone with a horse cock, especially someone as pretty as Elizabeth.  Could it be that he was jealous now that he wasn&#39;t the only anthromorphic horse person? And it had been fun, even more enjoyable than masturbating by himself, and definitely better than being milked by his mother.  His cock began to stir, as he began to relive the experience in his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to go wash up.  Mind if I use your shower? &quot; said Elizabeth, pointing to the door in his room leading to his bathroom.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Help yourself, &quot; said Jeff glumly.  Elizabeth began to whistle happily, as she grabbed a towel - ridiculously small in her hands now - and entered the bathroom. Now all he could think of was  Elizabeth in the shower, soaking her long athletic legs, firm ass, and perky big breasts with soapy water.  His erection began rise again, slightly throbbing.<br />
<br />
Jeff was repulsed by the actions of his cock, and the fact that he was actually turned on by the thought of having sex with a girl who was more horse than human.  That&#39;s enough, he thought, this shit is just getting too weird.  It&#39;s time to get everything back to normal.  He sat down at the computer, and began to look through the other menu options, hoping to find something that could easily reverse the changes to everyone.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the screen went blank, and he looked up to see Elizabeth holding the power cord in her hand.  &quot;Hey, what the hell are you doing? I thought you were taking a shower,&quot; said Jeff angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was about to, when it occurred to me that you might try something like this.  I don&#39;t want you changing anything.  I like the way I am, and I don&#39;t want you doing something that might mess it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s my program.  I&#39;ll do what I please.  Give me that power cord, &quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth put her hands on her hips, and stood up to her full height, towering over Jeff.  He suddenly regretted that he hadn&#39;t used the program to make himself a little bigger and stronger first.  He had already been a little short, thin and weakly, but in Elizabeth&#39;s presence he felt like a dwarf.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You may be the big dick around here, but I&#39;m the one with the muscle.  I&#39;d like to see you just try and take this from me, &quot; she said, poking him hard in the chest with one of her fingers.  Elizabeth still had five fingers, but they were thick and ended in a nail as hard as her hooves. The poke was painful, and made him wince. &quot;We&#39;re gonna handle this my way.  I&#39;m the one with the power, and I&#39;m the one in charge now. And the sooner you get that through your thick little skull, the better off you&#39;ll be.&quot;    <br />
  <br />
Jeff gulped and fumbled to think of some kind of response.  He was saved by the sound of his mother&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, dinner time! Come downstairs and have some dinner with you sister, &quot; said his Mom.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth still stood before him, glaring down at him.  &quot;I think you better do what she says, and go downstairs. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll take care of things up here. Then, I&#39;ll just finish my shower and be on my way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at the floor and nodded, like an obedient dog.  Slowly, he turned and began to walk out of  his room and downstairs into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ll just do it after she leaves, he thought.  But the first thing I&#39;m gonna do after everything is back to normal is give myself some muscle.  Jeff decided he didn&#39;t like being pushed around, and he didn&#39;t want to be anyone&#39;s punching bag anymore.<br />
<br />
Jeff walked down the stairs, noting that the stairs seemed a little bigger and wider than he remembered.  Must be so Suzy, my sister, can get up the stairs and into her room, he thought.  After all, she is an anthromorphic horse now.<br />
<br />
He sat down at the table across from Suzy.  Before her was a large bowl of oats and grass.  Hope I don&#39;t have to eat shit like that, he thought. He watched as his sister, Suzy, slowly chewed her food.  She looked different somehow, a little bit bigger.  Not nearly as big as Elizabeth, but still larger than he remembered.  As she lifted her arm, he saw that she had the same long thick white hair hanging off her forearms that Elizabeth did.<br />
<br />
Did her arms look like that before? he thought.<br />
<br />
His thoughts were interrupted when his Mom put a plate before him - a plate of wheat pancakes.  Oh thank God, he thought.  A little strange for dinner, but at least it&#39;s somewhat normal food.  He started to eat his food, when his mother suddenly slapped his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until your sister gets here!&quot; said his Mom, shortly.  Jeff was confused.  His sister was right in front of him, and she was impossible to miss - she was huge!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, here comes your sister, &quot; said his Mom, as Elizabeth reached the bottom of the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister?!? &quot;said Jeff and Elizabeth simultaneously, as they stared at each other with shock.</p>
