<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She didn&#39;t want to tell her brother that she only had a partial idea, that she was still unsure of a few details. But, after taking his money and fetching her purse, Tanya went to catch the next bus, got a transfer and within about half hour was wandering the aisles of a couple stores in the mall. Thinking about the size she had worn when she&#39;d been her brother&#39;s age, she decided to base her selection on that. Looking through the underwear, she picked up a pair of low-cut cotton panties that where black in the front and back with hot pink sides that wouldn&#39;t ride high, but would sit comfortable on the hips. Examining the tag, size 12, Tanya searched about and found the matching bra, a strapless garment that had black cups, a hot pink band and read the tag, 28B.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with this, she searched about until she found a sports bra and a pair of simple cotton underwear in the same sizes. Making her purchase, she headed for the next store. There, she looked at the selection, couldn&#39;t find anything, hit a couple more stores before deciding on a size five sandal, a pair of denim shorts and a grey tank top, both size 12. Having just enough, she had clothes put in the same bag as the underwear and carrying the shoes in a box, headed for home.<br />
<br />
There, Tanya noted mom still wasn&#39;t home, which she figured must mean she was working late and that she and Chris were on their own for dinner. Dropping the stuff on the couch, she called out, &quot;Chris?&quot; and when he didn&#39;t answer, she thought for a moment he might have ditched her. Taking a look at the clock, she saw that she was going have to call Nancy back soon, but figuring it could wait until she found her brother, she began searching the house. Finding him sitting in one of the chairs on the patio, a depressed look on his face, Tanya never got a chance to say anything when he suddenly burst out, &quot;I don&#39;t think I can do this. Agreement or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s kind of too late to back out now,&quot; Tanya stated in a frustrated tone. &quot;I already got you something,&quot; and desperate, added, &quot;Plus, I already called Nancy and told her I have a sub.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, that&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s been bothering me,&quot; Chris said. &quot;Doesn&#39;t your team already have subs? The last couple times I played, there were subs for the different positions in case something happened to one of the players. It seems to me that it is kind of odd that there wouldn&#39;t be a sub.&quot;<br />
<br />
A sigh and Tanya replied, &quot;That&#39;s one of the problems mine and a couple teams keep running into,&quot; and sitting down on the patio chair closest to her brother, she explained, &quot;At the start of the summer league, they set up the teams and assign substitute players. The problem is, most of those subs are hardly ever needed, so they ditch. When they are called in, they make excuses about why they cannot play, don&#39;t show up for practice, and often make the team look terrible when they do play a game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that sucks,&quot; Chris stated.<br />
<br />
A nod from Tanya and she said, &quot;Yeah. It is one of the reason why my team, and one of two others, have never gotten to the finals,&quot; and looking at her brother, she told him, &quot;This is why I am so desperate to find a sub for Aimee. It looks like this year we could get into the finals. And with only a couple more games to decide, we don&#39;t want to blow our chances.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris, upon hearing this, thought about all the times he had played, and the couple times his team had come close to taking home the trophy. Flipping back and forth, he eventually sighed and said, &quot;All right,&quot; and standing, he asked, &quot;Would I have to stay a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tanya, after she leapt up and gave her brother a quick hug, stepped back and told him, &quot;Only for the twelve hours. And only if we cannot find another sub for the next game,&quot; and thinking, she hastily added, &quot;Of course we could lose the this and the next game, which would blow our chances at the finals. If that happens, you would only have to be a girl for two games at the most,&quot; and heading inside, she collected her purchases off the couch and led him back to her room.<br />
<br />
There, she proceeded to snip off the tags. Handing her brother the strapless bra, the matching panties, the shorts, tank top and shoes, she said, &quot;I&#39;m not sure which item you touch to the necklace, so I guess try them all,&quot; as he took the garments.<br />
<br />
A nod from Chris as he took the clothes and about to ask for the amulet, he changed his mind. Heading to the bathroom, he set the things he&#39;d been given on the sink and staring at them, he tried to decide if he should put them on now or wait until he had transformed, which he still doubted would happen. Figuring he should wait, he turned to go get the necklace, and stopped when he saw his sister standing in the doorway. Smiling, uneasy, Chris told her, &quot;Uh, I think I&#39;ll try this in here,&quot; to which Tanya nodded, set the amulet on the sink and started to say something, but instead nodded and left.<br />
<br />
Her brother closing the bathroom door, Tanya found she didn&#39;t know what she should do. Hoping it worked, she paced back and forth a bit, then decided to call Nancy and explain she might have found a sub. Giving the bathroom door one more glance, she turned and headed for her room.<br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom, Chris stood in front of the vanity style sink and muttered, &quot;This is crazy,&quot; over and over as he stared into the mirror.<br />
<br />
Peering back at him, he saw his normal five foot seven altheletic build, the short dark brown hair shot through with blond here and there, the brown eyes that had the faintest tinge of green, and a face that every so often had a pimple or two. Most considered him lanky, and he was unsure if he should agree or disagree, so often just went with it. Trying to picture how he&#39;d look as a girl, he found he couldn&#39;t. Looking over at the amulet, he whispered, &quot;This is nuts. You&#39;re are insane. Tanya is daft,&quot; before starting to shuck off the shorts, boxer-briefs and tank top he had on.<br />
<br />
Naked, he looked down at his dick, which wasn&#39;t tiny, but certainly not large, the hair that just started to appear around it and sighed, &quot;If this works, going to miss seeing that,&quot; before  reaching for the amulet.<br />
<br />
Not sure what to expect when he picked it up, he frowned when he felt nothing but cold metal. Looking at the clothing, unsure which he should touch it to, he grabbed one of the sandals, the bra, panties, tank top and hesitated. Taking a couple deep breaths, trying to psych himself by telling himself, &quot;You can do this. It&#39;s only for twelve hours,&quot; he found he almost couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
But then, before he could really change his mind, he touched the items to the necklace, making sure as he that they were all in contact with his skin.<br />
<br />
A sharp electric jolt shot up his arm and a mild oath escaped him. Dropping the clothes and the amulet, Chris shook his head and glared at the things for a moment before looking into the mirror. Smiling, still seeing his normal reflection, he scoffed, &quot;Told her it wouldn&#39;t work. I&#39;m still...&quot; and then nearly doubled over as a cramping sensation rippled through his abdomen. Reaching for the sink, he tried to gasp out, &quot;What is ha...ha...hap...&quot; but only got so far before the feeling came back, worse.<br />
<br />
Mouth open, breathing heavily, Chris bent over, then squatted down. A low noise that sound like, &quot;Ahhhuhhh,&quot; escaped him as his chest began to itch and tingle. Trying to scratch it, unable to do so,  he tried force himself, and instead sat down heavily on the floor. Leaning back against the wall, he spread his legs as far as they could go, scooted a inch or so downward and stared up at the ceiling. Frozen, the cramping sensation in his abdomen becoming a full blown disconfort he grimaced as it went down into his legs, into his back and up into his chest. Feeling like something was tugging on his dick and balls, only not outward but inward, Chris tried to look down, but found he now that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn&#39;t move.<br />
<br />
Oblivious to what was happening, as the discomfort he was in continued to grow, Chris would have been shocked and frightened if he could have see how his penis had thinned, turned a bright whitish pink, and had begun to rapidly shrink. As it did so, his testicles pulled up into his body and his scrotum stretched out between his legs and up around his shrinking member, forcing it in the process between his legs. As the part of his sack inched into his body, lengthed, then began forming first the vagina, then the cervix, his testicles morphed, became ovaries, then, as they shifted up the forming cervix and through the developing uterus, the hormones they produced violently shifted, sending another wave of discomfort through his body, and began pumping out female hormones.<br />
<br />
As this happened, and his neo ovaries travelled up the fallopian tubes to finally come to rest in their spot, Chris&#39; chest began to push outward as his torso began to constrict. Body hair regressing, then disappearing, it felt to Chris like the pain in his chest went on for hours, but really it was only a couple minutes as his nipples became more pronounced and his chest began to thrust outward. AA cup, A cup, and finally a B cup, his breast development slowed, but was nowhere near finished, as they would continue to grow a little over the next five or so years if Chris remained a girl. And as his tits grew, his muscle mass dropped, his hips butt and thighs became more pronounced, and his torso took on more of a pinched look. Groaning in pain as the secondary female charicteristics developmed, Chris felt himselfs slide down lower, and now nearly laying on his back, he wished it would just be over as his feet and hands constricted tightly, painfully, and his exterior female genitals finished forming.<br />
<br />
And just as quick as it started, his transformation finished. His hair lightened, grew down to past his shoulders, and the last thing to change was his face, which took on a more rounded, female look. Finding the discomfort leaving him, Chris remained lying on the floor a moment before, gingerly, he placed his now dainty, small, female hands on the floor and pushed himself up. Standing, groaning, he looked down at the swell that now dominated his chest, stumbled to the sink, changed his mind and turned to look at the mirror either his mom or Tanya had hung on the back on the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
Not sure how he should take what he saw, he stared at the girl in the mirror. Pegging her height at about 5&#39;1&quot;, it suddenly flashed through his mind the knowledge that this was his height and that he weighed about a hundred pounds. Disturbed by this sudden insight, that he had lost about six inches in height and twenty seven pounds in weight, Chris felt something about his thoughts shift.<br />
<br />
Unsure what as she studied her face a moment, she teased her hair, which she knew she often get tied in a loose ponytail, then looked down. Cupping her B cup breasts, she glanced back at her reflection, took in the lightly coloured thatch of pubic hair, then grimaced when she came to realise that not only had she started to think of herself as a girl, but that, without her dick and nuts, there was no doubt she was one. Stumbling back from the mirror, Chris moaned, &quot;Oh, god. It worked,&quot; and still staring at her reflection, she whispered, &quot;That&#39;s me. That&#39;s who I&#39;ll be for the next twelve hours. 14 year old Christine Newman,&quot; and suddenly feeling weird, she turned away from the mirror, walked over to the toilet, lifted the lid and sat down on the seat.</p>
