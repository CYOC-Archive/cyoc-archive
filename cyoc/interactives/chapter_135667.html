<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>One note of personal business before we begin. For those who haven&#39;t asked yet but are wondering about it, I am not the &quot;T.MaskedWriter&quot; who is contributing to The Erotic Mind-Control Story Archive. Similar pen name, but different person.—tmw.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It is refreshing to see something different for a change,&quot; Peter Talbot said as he escorted his fiance out of the Student Union building. &quot;I&#39;m sure they might have been considered somewhat violent in their day, but The Three Stooges are tame compared to some of the things I&#39;ve seen that pass for comedy today.&quot;<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; said Karen Yuletide, proudly walking beside her future husband. Although it was well after dark, Peter remained in his normal form instead of displaying his werelion fursona because Karen had yet to have the private induction ceremony into were society they had planned for this coming weekend.<br />
&quot;I just was unaware of exactly how many third stooges there were,&quot; admitted Peter. &quot;I mean, Shemp coming in to replace Curly when his brother took ill, yeah. But Joe Besser AND Joe DeRita?&quot;<br />
&quot;I forget his name, but there was also a stand in for Shemp in the last couple of shorts accredited to him because the poor man passed away before they were completed,&quot; explained Karen. &quot;But DeRita only did the full length movies when Columbia finally decided to give the Stooges their big film break after all the years they kept them doing two reel shorts.&quot;<br />
&quot;I have to ask. How does a professed animation fanatic know so much about classic films?&quot;<br />
&quot;Besides the fact that cartoons were shown as part of a complete movie package in theaters until the 1960s, my grandmother loved all the classics. Bogie, Bacall, Spencer Tracy and Kathryn Hepburn, Abbott and Costello, The Marx Brothers...&quot;<br />
&quot;You know, my mother got me a DVD of <i>A Night At The Opera</i> as a present for my last birthday, and no matter how many times I&#39;ve seen it, not only does it never fail to make me laugh, but no matter how many times I pause and try to count, I still cannot figure out exactly how many people were crammed into Groucho&#39;s little stateroom aboard ship just before Margaret Dumont opens that door.&quot;<br />
&quot;Some things are best left unresolved. Besides, would knowing the answer make it any funnier?&quot;<br />
&quot;Probably not,&quot; conceded Peter.<br />
<br />
As they started walking back to Karen&#39;s dorm, she looked up at Peter and said, &quot;You know what I wish?&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
&quot;That I was already not only your werelioness, but that we were already married and starting our wonderful life together.&quot;<br />
&quot;As far as I&#39;m concerned, you are already my lioness,&quot; which made Karen smile even more, &quot;but I seriously doubt I&#39;ll be able to completely spoil my parents hopes of a big wedding extravaganza,&quot; Peter replied, which made Karen stop in her tracks.<br />
&quot;You know that I don&#39;t want a big wedding. In fact, my side of the guest list is probably going to be just my mother, Jenny and her husband.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know honey,&quot; said Peter, pulling her close to him. &quot;I am doing everything in my power to make sure the ceremony itself is as simple as can be, but I may lose the fight on the reception.&quot;<br />
&quot;And how will I explain all the people attending such a lavish affair when I&#39;ve only been here for less than a year to my mom? I haven&#39;t even had a chance to tell her about you yet. I figured I&#39;d do that when we went back to that apartment she calls home now for Thanksgiving break.&quot;<br />
&quot;My folks expect us for Thanksgiving dinner. Being the were lion king of Moon Lake, my father has the affair catered, so no one has to lift a paw to do anything other than hang out and eat. All the Talbots gather around and feast most of the afternoon away,&quot; revealed Peter.<br />
&quot;Any other time I&#39;d love being with my future in laws. But telling your mother that her only child is getting married next Spring isn&#39;t something you do over the phone,&quot; Karen pointed out to him. &quot;Besides, there is absolutely no way I&#39;ll ever be able to tell her that not only are you the one that makes my heart roar, but soon I&#39;ll be roaring in more ways that she could ever imagine.&quot;<br />
&quot;On that, we agree, but don&#39;t worry darling. We&#39;ll work something out to everyone&#39;s satisfaction. Especially yours,&quot; promised Peter, before they kissed.<br />
<br />
The happy couple were still embraced, exchanging kisses and smiles with each other, when a voice said, &quot;Excuse me, your majesty. Do you have a second?&quot;<br />
Peter looked and saw a female werelioness standing before them. Considering it was after dark now, she was not in violation of Moon Lake&#39;s public display laws concerning her fursona.<br />
&quot;My father is King. I&#39;m just Peter,&quot; he said as politely as possible. &quot;Is there something I can help you with?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. Is she the one?&quot; asked the werelioness, pointing at Karen.<br />
&quot;Am I the one what?&quot; wondered Karen, looking at the new arrival.<br />
&quot;Well, Liz Brookshire is—&quot;<br />
Hearing that name instantly changed both party&#39;s mood. Karen&#39;s face was now scowling and Peter was starting to issue a low growl.<br />
&quot;Liz Brookshire is what?&quot; he demanded to know.<br />
&quot;Well, Liz Brookshire is calling a bunch of us ladies up and saying how this normal has you all wrapped around her little finger, but doesn&#39;t know the first thing about being a werelioness. She&#39;s getting us together tomorrow during lunch to stage an intervention with her,&quot; said the lioness, pointing a paw again at Karen, &quot;but I figured that if the situation is as dire as Liz claims, that I should take a chance and find you on campus tonight and try to have a woman to woman chat with your intended now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter was about to say something, but Karen spoke first.<br />
&quot;I see. What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
&quot;Katrina Garcia, but please don&#39;t call me Kat,&quot; replied the werelioness.<br />
&quot;Well Katrina, I&#39;m afraid that Liz lied to you and your friends because she wants him all to herself,&quot; revealed Karen. &quot;Peter and I are in love. I may still be a normal at the moment, but we will be getting married on Valentine&#39;s Day next year. I won&#39;t deny that I still have some reservations about sharing him, but I&#39;d rather be with Peter and whoever else there is from time to time than without him.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sharing can be fun,&quot; said Katrina, as a smile crossed her leonine muzzle.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure it is. Only one virile male among a group of women,&quot; said Karen, while briefly giving Peter another smile.<br />
&quot;Well, sometimes there are more male lions involved,&quot; observed Katrina. &quot;Like at group meetings.&quot;<br />
<i>Now there&#39;s something I haven&#39;t considered,</i> realized Karen. &quot;Anyway, while I can still count the number of times on one hand, I&#39;m not totally unfamiliar with the pleasures of Sapphic Love,&quot; she confessed, while putting an arm around Katrina to befriend her. &quot;But the way I was originally raised, willing partners and cheating spouses are two vastly different things, because my father dumped my mother and me for another woman while I was still in high school. He left with her and we haven&#39;t seen him since.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh. I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Katrina, with genuine sympathy in her voice. &quot;But what do I tell Liz?&quot;<br />
Peter was about to say something, but Karen answered for him. &quot;Will she be at this intervention tomorrow?&quot;<br />
&quot;As far as I know, since it&#39;s her idea.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good. Then please don&#39;t say anything to anyone until at lunch tomorrow. We&#39;ll let all the ladies gather and share their thoughts on being a werelioness with me. We can hang out for awhile and get to know each other better to clear up any misunderstandings there might be about me,&quot; suggested Karen.<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Then Katrina looked at Karen and said, &quot;You know, you are far different than the picture Liz painted of you. Would you mind hanging out with me sometime after the intervention?&quot;<br />
&quot;Definitely. You can never have enough friends,&quot; said Karen, before giving Katrina a quick peck on her furry cheek. &quot;But nothing intimate until after Peter has the honor of making me his werelioness. Okay?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure. I should get back to my dorm and finish my homework now. Night Karen. Night your—I mean, Peter,&quot; said Katrina, before walking away from the couple.<br />
<br />
Peter Talbot just stood there, staring at Karen Yuletide until long after there was no sign of Katrina.<br />
Then, he finally said, &quot;Do you know how amazing you are?&quot;<br />
&quot;Based on the words of the man I love, I have some idea,&quot; replied Karen, before kissing him.<br />
When their lips parted this time, Karen looked at him and asked, &quot;I&#39;m coming to terms with having to share you with other lionesses, but what was that about other lions being involved?&quot;<br />
&quot;That has happened, but only among willing participants,&quot; answered Peter, before giving Karen an affectionate hug. &quot;Most of what Katrina described happens among the singles. While lions may have what is called an open marriage to some extent, we are definitely faithful to our mates.&quot;<br />
<i>Good. The thought of you with other women was difficult enough to comprehend to begin with, but me with other men? I may wind up dallying with others from time to time, but you&#39;re the only lion for me!</i> &quot;So, what do we do about Liz? I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to discover that she was behind my amazing animation job offer either.&quot;<br />
&quot;That I&#39;ll concede, but there is no formal proof,&quot; Peter pointed out.<br />
&quot;Personally, I doubt Liz&#39;ll actually be at that get together she&#39;s cooked up for tomorrow, and technically she hasn&#39;t broken her word because I&#39;ve never been in any physical danger, but still...&quot;<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s time I had that delayed chat with my father about her.&quot;<br />
&quot;I agree. But whatever the results of that conversation, please don&#39;t take any action against her until after my lunch meeting tomorrow. I&#39;d still like to meet the other ladies and hear what they have to say.&quot;<br />
Peter stared at her a moment and then said, &quot;If that is what you wish, but as the injured party, so to speak, your input will still be required in regards to any punishment Liz suffers.&quot;<br />
&quot;That is a subject I&#39;m more than willing to discuss with you and your father,&quot; said Karen, as she linked her arm with Peter&#39;s.<br />
The couple started walking back to Karen&#39;s dorm again as she said, &quot;You know, Liz may keep right on scheming at least until our wedding day if she&#39;s not stopped. Or perhaps even longer.&quot;<br />
&quot;THAT I will not allow darling,&quot; promised Peter, as he let out another low but menacing growl, which actually made Karen shudder a little.<br />
<br />
