<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The snorting and huffing sounds of Jared the stallion standing almost upright on his hind legs as he was sheath deep, his pony cock delving deep into his sweetheart turned into a beautiful mare; a distraught father heard and began to grumble. <br />
<br />
&quot;I would think that Jen had seen enough of mating horses, and for her to want to become as one, it leaves me wondering why. Why, why can someone tell me why my daughter would prefer becoming an animal, a pony mare, a whoring mare?&quot; Mister Morrison said aloud, and having asked for someone to tell him of why, the warmth in his shirtpocket reminded him of something powerful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Medallion, speak, tell me why my dear daughter would rather become an animal, a pony mare?&quot; Mr. Morrison said, asking the Medallion to again speak and tell what it knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, My Master, as you command me, I shall inform you as to why Jennifer wanted to become a pony mare.<br />
<br />
Allow me to say she was a be a beautiful young woman, as who she felt a great love of her boyfriend Jared. I did as Jared wished we was, and made of him to being an American Shetland pedigree pony stallion. When Jennifer figured out who you new stud pony was before he became a pony, her love for Jared seemed to double. She knew her friend could not speak using human language, he with a equine contoured mouth, lips and tongue.<br />
<br />
She came and found where Jared put me, and before this present fun fandango, she asked to become for her pony friend as his favorite mare. They mated and did so often until the time limit she specified expired, and I returned her to being her normal born self. Once any human has had the experience of becoming as is an animal, and after having mated with or by another animal, the sensuality of their romp is something strongly favored, a real delight, and for many, they wish to return to being the animal, until they ask to stay permanently as their favorite animal form.<br />
<br />
Jennifer desired greatly to feel her vagina as stretched tight by the equine stallion size cock, penis what Jared sports. Her hopes and plans for following after her father as becoming a ranch manager, or the wife to a farm owner, have since her sexual infatuation become as a secondary desire.<br />
<br />
You can hear the elated pair of ponies huffing as they mate!<br />
<br />
The more they mate, the stronger will be her desire to procreate often, and with the passing of time, she may turn to letting other stallions mount her and mate. Her friend Jared has become more as it is to being a pony stallion then what he was as a respectful young teenager. He wanted to know and experience everything it was to become a stallion, and he has sired new foals with other mares.<br />
<br />
Given time as they live their life being as animals, as ponies of the same herd, they will lose their human identities, and digress mentally, gaining a normal equine mentality. Instincts become strong, and work to erase the learned knowledge that those who become as animals, then have no need to own or use.<br />
<br />
Jared and Jennifer are in love, each with the other, as they were for many years. It is only now with what became of Jared and since Jennifer made a vain wish she could be the lover Jared desired most, she learned the sensual delights of being a pony mare, and she preferred, wanted to feel those wild feelings again.<br />
<br />
Passions beget lust what enhances passion and increases the sense of lust, until what is intelligent, knowing of better, wishes to degrade of body and mind, as have many, they request of my powers to change, transform, merge, as become as some favorite animal embodiment.&quot; The Medallion so specified, told Mr. Morrison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lust and passions have been the detriment to the world for centuries.  I worked for what I own and like to live, as wanted the same for my daughter. I had a passion to own, and after meeting my darling wife, the lust in me she wore down to being a special relationship of human love. Why then would Jen wish to deny herself of what her mother and I have worked so hard to give her?&quot; Mr. Morrison grumbled, telling and asking of the Medallion to help him learn the reason why.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does my Master really favor to learn the why about his daughter preferring to be as live her life like would a pony mare?&quot; The Medallion asked, its voice having a tone as if it were being mischievous. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, OK, as yes, please do, as the wife has retired for the night, we have time for you to tell me, and instruct me as of the blunt reasons why Jen would prefer her being a mare and not live as my dear daughter?&quot; Mr. Morrison said, and as much posed a question to the Medallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;If just for tonight, and with the best way to show my Master what his daughter reasons as her desire to forget being human and lusting for Jared to mount, mate, and inseminate, you my Master would need to become as a pony mare in her tenth day of feeling estrus, and with Jared the stallion standing nearby in the same corral.&quot; The Medallion specified to Mr. Morrison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do what, me become a mare in estrus, Medallion, that is not what I asked. No, I need to know why, why, why, did my daughter wish she was a brute animal, a pony mare? Jared can&#39;t have such a cock that makes him like being an animal rather than being the son of his loving parents. It makes no sense to me. Before I would want you top change me into a mare, I rather become the cock of a horny stallion<br />
like what George has, and have him instruct me as to why...!&quot; Mr.Morrison said, and he hearing what he said, as how he said it, he felt trapped by his own questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed My Master, I am sure George will be most elated to make use of his intelligent male member, as he shall use you to delight Gracie, tonight, as all night. Enjoy and learn My master!&quot; The Medallion said, as its heat became very hot and Mr. Morrison began to feel his whole body as moving to merge with what draft horse stallion George seemed to treasure most.</p>
