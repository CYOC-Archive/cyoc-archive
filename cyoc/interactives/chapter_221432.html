<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You lay there in the quiet laundry room, trying to change back, but without the medallion, you were stuck. You realized how bad the situation was, a reel of fabric amongst other reels of fabric, with no one knowing you had become this and no medallion to reverse it. There was no way of knowing how long you would be stuck like this. You saw your mother later that day, but other than stack you with your new brethren neatly while she put laundry in and out of the machines, she paid you no mind. By that point you wished you had taken your punishment, but that was out of your non existent hands.<br />
<br />
You spent the next few days in that room in silence, only seeing brief glimpses of your mother and sister as they passed by the doorway, or heard their muffled discussions through the door when it was closed to keep the noise of he washing machine in. Finally the weekend came around and you saw your mother come in and look right at you. She sighed and walked towards you.<br />
&quot;Right, I think you have sat there gathering dust long enough&quot; She said, your hopes shooting up that she knew it was you and decided your punishment was at an end, but those same hopes were quickly dashed as she grabbed you casually and put you and two other reels under her arm, carrying you out of the room. She had been talking to herself and the fabric she now planned to use.<br />
<br />
You found yourself placed down on the table where you saw your mother getting out her sewing machine, threads, as well as the item that filled you with a cold dread, the fabric scissors. She grabbed your reel and unrolled you, smoothing you out as she lay the template she wanted over you, blinding your vision as you felt her make marks on you and the pinch of the pins going through you. You tried frantically to tell her she wasn&#39;t using real fabric, that it was her son, but of course, fabric cannot move, nor talk to real people, so you lay there as inert and mute as any other fabric.<br />
<br />
You felt the cold snip as she began cutting the fabric as she had done so many times before. Putting no more thought into it than the dozen other times she had made her own clothing items. The fabric cut smoothly, with almost no resistance at her expertise. As she cut, Hayley walked in wearing her sports gear and headphones, on her way out for a run.<br />
&quot;Hey mom, I&#39;m just going out for a jog.&quot; She said casually before pausing and stroking over the exposed fabric, &quot;Oh, this is pretty material. Can you make me something if you have some left?&quot; She asked sweetly, your mother smiling back at her,<br />
&quot;Of course I can sweetheart, enjoy your run&quot; She said warmly before turning back to the task at hand.<br />
<br />
You mentally reeled, you were going to be turned into multiple items for both your mother AND your sister. Would the medallion even work if you were split in multiple parts. Would all of you need to be together for you to be able to use its magic? You had no idea, but it seemed you might find out.<br />
<br />
You could do nothing as your mother worked to get you cut into shape, pinned and then stitched together, folded, flipped, smoothed, turned, stabbed by the sewing machine, repeatedly as she worked. Your vision curved weirdly, but you knew the shape, she had turned wherever your eyes were into a bra. You felt her get to work on the second item which soon felt like the shape of a matching set of panties. You felt your mother hold them up, stretching them a little before laying them down in front of your eyes. You finally saw you were apparently a golden fabric, though she had given you a slight black lace trim.<br />
<br />
She smoothed out more of you and you listened in silent fear as she went back to cutting and sewing the remaining fabric of yours into something new, something for your sister. You mentally winced in pain as the sewing machine got to work, this felt more sensitive, whatever the fabric was made of, was clearly your more intimate areas.<br />
<br />
It took hours for all this to happen, Hayley had come back from her jog and was chatting to her mother while she worked before squealing how much she loved the look of her new dress, which is obviously what you had been turned into. This was really bad, here you were, with your family members and neither of them had a clue they were making you into garments for them both. Hayley grabbed her new dress when it was done, thanking her mother and rushing upstairs to try you on, while your mother casually picked up her new lingerie.<br />
<br />
You watched as she carried you up to her room, while at the same time feeling your sisters body sliding up your fabric as she put you on. As she zipped you up, you could feel her warm body rubbing against your sensitive areas, which was very uncomfortable, but you could do nothing as she struck poses in her new dress, taking pictures to show her friends. You thought that would be the worst of this situation, then you remembered where the rest of you would end up. Your mother had gotten to her room and laid you on the bed, stripping so she could try on her new lingerie. She picked you up and with horror you realized your curved vision was curved inwards, as your mothers nipples rushed towards your vision and the world went black as they pressed into you, compressing slightly as they touched the fabric.<br />
<br />
Then came an even worse realization as she slid the panties up her legs, your nose had ended up on the back of the panties, you could smell her ass, which was thankfully clean, but still an ass, though that was not the worst bit, your tongue was at the front, pressing against your mothers crotch. You could taste your mother and no matter how much you wanted to stop, you could do nothing.<br />
<br />
You were trapped in this hell as you felt your sisters body rubbing inside you, while tasting and smelling and having your face pressed into various parts of your mother. The medallion lay on your mothers bedside table, but it may as well have been a million miles away for all the good it did you. Hayley had gotten comments back about her dress and made plans to go out with friends in it dancing tonight, your mother found you comfortable so simply slipped her clothes back on over you and went to tidy up the fabrics downstairs and go about her day. She passed your empty room and did wonder how long you were planning to hide from her punishment, but still assumed you had run and hidden at a friends house. Little did she know how close you were...</p>
