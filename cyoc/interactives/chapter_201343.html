<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An entire class later, and Ethan was heading to chemistry class.<br />
<br />
He was confident that he&#39;d dealt with...whatever the hell it was that caused him to just get so turned on. He was used to having a positively thrumming libido, but today? It just seemed even more intense than usual. Let alone the fact that he was reacting in such a way to one of those brainless jocks. At least as far as he was concerned they were mostly brainless. After all, if they had something going on upstairs, they wouldn&#39;t have fallen for his master stroke of a plan that would leave them a bunch of zoo animals and leave him ready to have all the sex they used to hog to themselves.<br />
<br />
Fuck. Maybe he was wrong about how done he was with his libido. Even as Ethan swaggered into class, he was sporting wood again. But he knew he couldn&#39;t just run off to the bathroom again and let it out. He was gonna have to find some bitch after school willing to get down and dirty with him, or just rub it off after he was done eating at lunch. Besides - it wasn&#39;t like he was broadcasting it. He wore thick jeans for a reason.<br />
<br />
Today it seemed like his luck was changing.<br />
<br />
A couple of the women at the campus seemed to be pretty interested today. Even the young chemistry teacher, Ms. Wallace, seemed to be into him a little bit, scoping him out. Ethan - as he passed by a couple of the women checking him out - flexed his ass and grinned. Chicks loved a guy with a nice bubble butt. Some cooing and giggling, followed by chatter that Ethan usually didn&#39;t hear ensued - talking about him, how hot he was looking today, and joking about wanting to go out with &quot;the nerd-hunk&quot;.<br />
<br />
All this stoked Ethan&#39;s ego, and so, he didn&#39;t even notice the fact that his hearing was slightly sharper than usual.<br />
<br />
He was all set to just enjoy his time there when who should enter class but Marcus.<br />
<br />
Ethan&#39;s eyes widened as he saw the trimmed, nice looking bit of beard still on Marcus&#39; face - evidently he had grown a bit of one at night and just decided to trim it up and wear his growth with pride. People really liked how mature and strong Marcus looked, and even Ethan was left agape at how the preppy seemed...even more built than usual. The jock jacket he wore betrayed no hint of the strain going on, but obviously from the way Marcus walked, not all was right in the muscular athlete&#39;s personal kingdom.<br />
<br />
His white tank top, usually a loose fit and made of thin material regardless, was now a good deal tighter, and looked visibly uncomfortable on him. The fitness pants he wore - usually just tight at the bum and not at the leg - now hugged his quadriceps and thighs, highlighting both a powerful muscled rear, as well as his legs. <br />
<br />
But if there was such discomfort, Marcus gave no indication outwardly of it beyond the slightest twinge in his smile and the difference in his step. He was obviously interested less in class and more in just getting through the day so he could go get some new clothes.<br />
<br />
Again what happened earlier with Gabe happened again with Marcus. Ethan was damn sure he was not queer in the least - at least as far as he knew. But some sort of...perfume? Cologne? Whatever it was, it seemed to be in vogue with the jocks today. Because it smelled REAL nice, and made Ethan grip his desk and choke down a grunt. Why was he reacting in such a way to a fucking jock? <br />
<br />
Ethan felt his crotch involuntarily pump upward, as if he was fucking...someone...and he was left nervous as Marcus took his seat not four seats away from Ethan. Submerging him as it were in the area of affect of the &quot;cologne&quot; that seemed to waft off of the person of the well muscled preppy. <i>Fuck, why does this shit have to happen to me today? Of all days! When I&#39;m feeling so fine and looking so good?</i><br />
<br />
Well, at least Ethan could concentrate on class.<br />
<br />
At least that was what he thought until the teacher revealed they were going to be doing a two student group assignment based on testing various chemical reactions. They were handed out the relevant safety materials, but Ethan was wary. He hoped against hope that this would not bring him into closer contact with Marcus Brant. But as the teacher started to assign partners, Ethan&#39;s heart sank.<br />
<br />
Eventually, he and Marcus were increasingly left alone as the teacher assigned others together...and by the time it was just Ethan and four other students, he was hoping. He would even take being assigned to work with a total numbskull. At least then he could do most of the work and get the lion&#39;s share of the grade. But as it went on, Ethan realized what was going on.<br />
<br />
He had four options...<br />
<br />
And the teacher assigned him and Marcus to work together. At least usually Ethan would have comparatively little to complain about relative to if he was assigned one of the other jocks. In comparison to them, Marcus was at least a little less braindead by comparison. He was after all what passed for their leadership among the students. And he was getting a reasonably good grade here so he could continue with his membership on the team without relying on favoritism.<br />
<br />
So he shouldn&#39;t feel such a sense of dread.<br />
<br />
But Ethan also knew that Marcus was inducing such feelings in him, such a primal sort of response, that he wanted to either be assigned someone else, or just get this over with as soon as possible. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s get this done.&quot; It seemed Marcus, as he got up and moved over to sit by Ethan, was being affected similarly.<br />
<br />
Sweat dripped subtly from his brow. His muscles tightened in his arms. Ethan could see the athlete&#39;s nipples right through his shirt as he took off his jacket. Fuck, it seemed like Marcus had been working out even more lately. &quot;Uhh yeah, yeah, I figure that if we both put forward our efforts, we should uh, get the best grades.&quot; Marcus&#39; tone was even, but Ethan could see that the jock was rocking a hard on just as insistent as Ethan&#39;s own.<br />
<br />
And yet, here Marcus was the very picture of restraint - not even acting any differently with all that seemed to be going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doubtless.&quot; Marcus responded. &quot;I admit I do respect the caliber of work you put in, Ethan. I know you don&#39;t really see eye to eye with my fellow guys, but I hope we can cooperate on this assignment without issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see why not.&quot; Ethan answered, trying to keep himself from saying something embarrassing. He wanted to say so much! But he knew if he blew it that he would likely get bullied even worse before these athletes ended up in a nature preserve. As the teacher walked around and compounded the issue, her bright red hair swaying and her beautiful features inspiring even further distraction Ethan could not afford, he found himself briefly fantasizing about her giving him and Marcus a blow job right under the table. Both guys high fiving as they got their pleasurable dues.<br />
<br />
Ethan managed to calm himself down and kept on. As the project went on, and he started testing the chemical reactions, even as the chemicals sizzled and bubbled within the safety containers, the heat barely cracked the levels of intensity that went on within Ethan Campos. He was suppressing if just barely an odd twitch and a want to just...test it. Feel how strong Marcus&#39; tricep really was. The guy wore all these showy clothes under his jock finery, and Ethan found it so weird now.<br />
<br />
If he wanted to show off, why not just show up to school in those flattering pants and that tight, thin material shirt?<br />
<br />
For his part, Marcus was not a slouch on the team project. He expertly logged each reaction and did nothing to make Ethan feel like complaining. If anything he was a perfectly adequate and exemplary partner for such a project. He observed at the various intervals, logging the phases of the chemical interactions. If he noticed Ethan observing his musculature, he didn&#39;t let it slip. It seemed like until Ethan said something or did something, Marcus was content to just play it coy and let the work go on.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the teacher left to go take a call. Something about new resources for the class. But with her gone, potentially, Ethan could say something. Yet he was conflicted. He oh so very much desired his female classmates, but if he made a show of desiring Marcus they might feel his sexual interests lay with the same gender rather than with them - a prejudgement that was common in such a setting. <br />
<br />
Ethan felt a strong sense of conflict. He wanted to say something, to do something, to truly confront Marcus about how...good he looked, Ethan guessed. But he also really needed this sexual escapade later, and did not want to do anything that, in their judgement might endanger the continuity of such a relationship...<br />
<br />
Immediate, in spite of himself enjoyment? Make Marcus think he was &quot;admiring&quot; him or something - when really, Ethan was just feeling so hot today...<br />
<br />
Or prioritize his later in the day fun times? He couldn&#39;t decide. Maybe there was a way to ensure he got both, and he was confident he was smart enough to find it. For his part though, Marcus gave no indication of notice that Ethan was going through something in the other corner. His attention at present was on a chemical interaction and logging the 90 second response.<br />
<br />
Ethan...</p>
