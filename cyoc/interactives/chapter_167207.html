<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;SHIT!!!&quot; He screamed stumbling backwards. He reached up and pulled on his newly enlarged ears, &quot;man ...oh, man ...what the hell is ...&quot; He tripped with me and I fell down landing on his tail. He yelped in pain and shock.<br />
<br />
I grabbed his tail with both hands and pulled it between his legs stroking it roughly.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be real! This can&#39;t be happening! Honey, you gotta help me,&quot; he stammered.<br />
<br />
He turned to look up at me but just stopped and starred, his mouth falling slightly ajar. I couldn&#39;t feel a thing but I had an idea about what was happening. I reached up and found that my ears had just grown in size and where now covered in fur. I bent them over and impossibly managed to look at my ears right in front of my face.<br />
<br />
I began to cry but suddenly I felt my jeans tighten and I twisted my head around to look over my shoulder just in time to<br />
see my own long, fur-covered tail rip its way through my jeans.<br />
<br />
I managed to keep from screaming but not by much, &quot;Oh shit ... Oh Shit! What are we gonna do? What&#39;s happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then Tayler started to yell out in pain. He was tearing at and trying to pull off his shoes, which had become distorted in shape as his feet swelled. Before he could get the laces undone though, the shoes flew apart with a tremendous popping sound, the socks shredding as well. Tayler&#39;s toes were merging together, the nails growing longer and thicker, becoming a glossy black. Soon he had two hooves and from the knees down brown fur had sprouted making his legs look just like a donkey&#39;s.<br />
<br />
He tried to stand but it was rather awkward for him. He finally managed to prop himself up on the bar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, you gotta go find some help. You have to hurry, I can&#39;t run like this,&quot; he pleaded with me.<br />
<br />
I took one more long look at him, his tail swishing slowly behind him, hooves tapping nervously on the floor, then turned and bolted out the door. As I ran I became acutely aware of the wind blowing past my long ears and the tugging sensation caused by my tail. I also noticed that the park was completely deserted. Every building I looked in was empty.<br />
<br />
I was nearing the far end of the island when I began to detect the sounds of boys and girls yelling and the braying of more donkeys. I decided to approach cautiously from behind a row of several large crates. Up ahead, hundreds of donkeys were penned into several large corrals where they were being loaded into crates and moved towards a loading dock.<br />
<br />
One of the donkeys managed to slip away and started running in my direction. Before it made it to the crates where I was hiding, a bunch of large men in the red uniforms of the park employees managed to tackle the gray-furred animal. It was struggling to get free then it started yelling.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... Nooooo! Let me go... you gotta let me go! I don&#39;t wanna be a donkey!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
It had the voice of a young girl! The men started to drag her back to the corrals. One of the men, wheezing and out of breath hung back a bit and stopped to lean against the crate in front of me. He took off the red overcoat and cap to cool off, but just then the donkey broke free again and he had to quickly chase after it, leaving the coat and hat behind.<br />
<br />
Without hesitating I grabbed the clothes and threw them on to disguise myself. Fortunately, the coat was a long one, coming almost down to my knees, so I was able to adequately hide my tail. I was also able to tuck my ears up into the cap and figured I could pass for nearly normal.<br />
<br />
I just had to get a closer look at what was going on. I forced myself to walk at a casual pace as I made my way towards the action. As I got closer, I spotted the guy in the dark suit barking out orders to other uniformed men.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, come on, get those donkeys branded. Hurry up! Ya get them branded and they can&#39;t talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Near the front of the corral several fires were burning with what I assumed to be branding irons placed in them. As I watched, the group of men the chased down the stray donkey brought it forward. It<br />
was still struggling and yelling as an iron was pulled from the fire and placed against its hide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaagh...NOOooo... Hee Haw, Heeee Haaaw.&quot; It screamed as its voice cracked and faded into braying.<br />
<br />
It continued to bray as it was led away on onto a nearby truck. As it passed by I caught a glimpse of the brand on its hindquarters. It looked just like the stamp that was placed on my hand when we first arrived at the park.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, we haven&#39;t got all night. Get those stupid animals branded before the stamp wears off. And do another sweep of the park to make sure there aren&#39;t any left,&quot; The suit guy was yelling.<br />
<br />
That was enough for me, so I started to make my way back so I could get to Tayler and we could get the hell away from this island. I had just made it around the first set of boxes when another uniformed man walked into view.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just were are you going, get back to work,&quot; he ordered<br />
<br />
I started to stutter a reply when my tail started to fall out of the back of my coat.<br />
<br />
The guy gasped, &quot; Hey you&#39;re not... you&#39;re a girl! You&#39;re one of them!&quot;<br />
<br />
He was about to yell for help but I pushed him and he fell down on some crates. He must have hit his head because he was out cold. I started off at a dead run for the pool hall once I was hidden from view of the loading docks.<br />
<br />
I was about halfway there when my feet started to ache terribly. I stumbled and fell to the ground as the pain increased and I struggled to get my shoes off. My feet were swelling and contorting into a new shape. It seemed to take an eternity but within moments my feet had finished their transformation to hooves. I ran my hands over the hard glossy black hooves and shuddered at the feeling.<br />
<br />
It made running rather difficult but I made it back to the pool hall. I ran in, my hooves clomping noisily on the hardwood floors, and spotted Tayler standing with his back to me by the mirrored wall on the far side of the room. It looked like he had transformed further. He was standing there naked, his clothes in shreds on the floor around him. The brown fur now covered his entire body, except for a bristly black mane running down the back of his head and between his shoulders. His head seemed to be bobbing up and down and his tail was swing side to side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tayler? Come on we&#39;ve got to get out here...&quot; My hooves slid on the floor as I skidded to a stop. As I rounded the pool table I finally caught sight of what Tayler was doing in the reflection of the mirror.</p>
