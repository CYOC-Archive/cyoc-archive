<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thankfully the trip to the Magic Shop would only take 20 to 30 minutes. As Kaitlin now drove she would occasionally glance at her now teenage friend, watching the girl fiddle with her ill fitting clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Kaitlin said awkwardly. &quot;You were still growing at sixteen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Laura sighed. &quot;I grew three inches between Junior and Senior year.&quot; Laura now looked over herself, her shoulders slumping dejectedly. &quot;Guess that would be a year away now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlin and Laura now drove in silence once more, at a loss for words. &quot;So what were you like in high school,&quot; Kaitlin asked.<br />
<br />
Laura shrugged as she now thought about her high school days. &quot;Well I guess high school was alright,&quot; she said. &quot;I was the good girl. Got along with everyone, did well in school, I was even on the swim team. Varsity for three years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow didnt know you were a swimmer,&quot; Kaitlin said in awe. &quot;You still swim?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Had to give it up,&quot; Laura said sadly. &quot;Blew my knee out in college. Then I had shoulder surgury after a car accident when I was 21. After that just never swam competitively again.&quot; Laura paused as the words left her mouth. Lifting her skirt her eyes went wide as she gazed at her left knee. The scar she had grown so accustomed to seeing over the last 20 years was gone. Turning things over in her head she now realized her regression had completely repaired her injuries.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Laura gasped. &quot;My knee! Its, better!&quot; Kaitlin glanced at the excited teen who was now excitedly pointing to her knee. Kaitlin could see through the baggy nylons that Laura&#39;s knee did not have a mark on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Kaitlin whispered. &quot;I guess you really are younger. I mean if your knee fixed itself, I guess the rest of your body changed too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura now blushed, if she was 16 again, that meant other things may have changed as well. &quot;What,&quot; Kaitlin asked, seeing the girl fidget. <br />
<br />
&quot;If my knee is fixed,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Then...um, something else may have changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura blushed fiercely, slumping in her seat as she worked up the courage to answer. &quot;I..um didnt lose my virginity til I was 19,&quot; Laura said meekly. &quot;If I am 16 again physically. Then um, I think I might be a virgin again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlins eyes went wide as Laura blushed several shades of red. Regressing so young appeared to have both positives and negatives. Laura now was truely just a girl. So far the regression appeared to be only physical, if they ended up growing even younger would it begin to affect them mentally as well? Also if they were able to change back, would the changes they had experienced remain? Would Laura grow back up into a 43 year old virgin?<br />
<br />
Thankfully these awkward questions would have to be answered later as the two women now pulled into the parking lot of the Magic Shop. As they exited the car, Laura fidgeted with her outfit as she began to walk towards the front door, stumbling slightly in her oversized heels. As they gazed at the store they were surprised by what they saw. The store seemed completely normal. The shelves were lined with various boxes and items while a non descript cash register sat towards the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was expecting something a little more....magical,&quot; Kaitlin said flatly as they walked towards the front desk. As they approached they could see an elderly man doing inventory. Looking up from his work, he smiled. &quot;Welcome to the Magic Shop,&quot; he said. &quot;Is their anything I can help you with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi my name is Laura. I received these dice today, I&#39;d like to return them.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man now gazed at the dice Laura handed him. &quot;I see did they not work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They worked a little too well,&quot; Laura stated, holding out her arms to show the looseness of her business attire. &quot;I&#39;m only 16 now. I didnt want to be THIS young.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man nodded as he now looked between Laura and Kaitlin. &quot;I see,&quot; he said stoically. &quot;Would it be okay if I talk with you friend miss?&quot; Laura raised an eyebrow before shrugging and motioning towards Kaitlin. Somewhat unsure Kaitlin now followed the old man as he took her to his back office. As they entered the small room, Kaitlin was once again struck by its appearance. It looked like any office, in any store she had ever seen. A small desk topped with a computer with a non descript chair behind it. As the old man now sat behind his desk, Kaitlin could only stand before him awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;My apologies Miss,&quot; he said. &quot;It appears your friend received these by mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So can you fix this,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
The old man rubbed his neck sheepishly as he gazed at Kaitlin. &quot;Well I don&#39;t think I can,&quot; he said sheepishly. &quot;You see the spirit of youth can only restore youth. I could possibly give your friend something to make her older.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me,&quot; Kaitlin asked. &quot;I got none years younger when the dice bonded to me. I&#39;m only 30 now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man seemed to wince, sighing as he shook his head. &quot;So you bonded with them as well,&quot; he said. &quot;Oh that&#39;s not good. If I restore your friends she you would get older too, and by older I mean MUCH older.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlin shivered, she didnt mind being 30. She just didnt want to get as young as Laura. &quot;Is their anything else you could do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Their are two options,&quot; the old man said. &quot;If you are 30 and your friend is 16 I could take some of your years and add them to her. Let&#39;s say seven years so that you would both be 23.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the other option,&quot; Kaitlin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well miss,&quot; he stated. &quot;In my personal opinion things like this happen for a reason. Perhaps deep down your friend needs a fresh start, a new lease on life. An opportunity to fix past mistakes. What I propose is making your friend even younger, maybe make her a child once more so that she can relive her life. If your willing I can make your friend 5 or 6 years old with you as her 30 year old mother. The choice is yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlin nodded as she pondered her options. She could make Laura her old age but make herself older in the process, they could both become 23 again, or she could become the 30 year old mother of a 5 or 6 year old Laura. What ever decision she made would alter not only her life but Laura&#39;s as well.</p>
