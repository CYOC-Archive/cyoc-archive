<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bobby was marveling over Kaitlin's new body when he heard the front door open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I'm home.&quot; Amanda said. <br />
<br />
Oh shit, Bobby thought to himself. He looked at his ring, and realized he still had plenty of years left to add to someone. Bobby was about to get out of bed when Kaitlin stopped him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't change her unless she wants it.&quot; Kaitlin said. &quot;In fact, let me go talk to her first.&quot; Kaitlin got dressed and went downstairs.<br />
<br />
Bobby pondered that statement as he got on some pants and went back in bed. He could tell something had gone wrong, when she head Amanda scream, and come running up the stairs.<br />
<br />
Amanda slammed the door open and looked at me coldly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to my mom?&quot; she asked me furiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, erm, I uh...well&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He aged me using a magical ring he found.&quot; Kaitlin said. <br />
<br />
Amanda took in what her mother just said and laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I get it. This isn't actually my mom, and you two are high as a kite. Nice try though&quot; Amanda said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I'm not your mom, who's going to make you scrambled eggs with waffle bits thrown in for breakfast tomorrow?&quot; Kaitlin said. Amanda teared up as that was what her mom always made for breakfast. She ran to her room and slammed the door.Bobby, feeling guilty at this point, went to Amanda's door and asked if they could talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, go away.&quot; Amanda said. Bobby then said maybe they could work something out with this situation. Amanda opened her door, and let him in.<br />
<br />
Amanda's room looked like the room of a typical teenage girl, with Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez and One Direction posters littered all over. She also was apparently a sports fan, as evidenced by <br />
by the Chicago Cubs poster behind her bed.<br />
<br />
Bobby sat down and explained the ring's powers. &quot;So, what you did to my mom isn't permanent?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Bobby replied.<br />
<br />
Amanda sat on her bed and thought to herself for a few minutes. She then told Bobby she had an idea. &quot;Look, this whole &quot;you being 50 years younger than my mom&quot; is going to stop. It's creepy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby bitterly said &quot;Fine. What else do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda told her that she wanted her mom to be regressed back to age 55, and for him to be that age as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey now, that's not r--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Screw you. Unless you want me running away forever, your MILF fantasy ends now.&quot; &quot;Ugh, fine.&quot; Bobby looked at his ring and wished for he and Kaitlin to be 55. Suddenly, he felt light-headed and fainted.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
When Bobby came to, he realized things were significantly different. When he stood up, he felt a jarring pain in his hips. His body had turned to flab and was riddled with<br />
liver spots and wrinkles. He then looked in the mirror and saw an old man of 55. He was not pleased. <br />
<br />
&quot;Happy?&quot; he asked Amanda. &quot;Yep. I saw my mom and she's just like you, except not totally disgusting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, well if that's all, I'm going back to bed.&quot; Bobby said as he started to walk out the door. He was walking back to the bedroom when something that had been gnawing on the back of his mind finally took over. What would Amanda look like older?<br />
<br />
She was certainly a pretty girl at age 13. She was 5'1 and 111 pounds with A-cup breasts. She had a very cute face, a nice smile, long light brown hair that reached her butt, and bright blue eyes that you couldn't help look at. Amanda was currently wearing a baggy red T-shirt with blue jeans and a pair of Skechers.  <br />
<br />
Bobby walked back to Amanda's room and asked her if she wanted to be older herself. Amanda said no, but Bobby refused to let the conversation end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, I have this technology right on me. Don't you want to see what you'd be like as an adult?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sometimes. You're sure you'd be able to reverse this, right?&quot;. Bobby replied in the affirmative. &quot;Okay then. Make me older, but still young.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby thought hard about what age he would want her to be, and then realized he still had Kaitlin's wardrobe. 30. 30 is the age he would transform her to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready Amanda?&quot; Bobby asked.&quot;Yep,&quot; she replied.<br />
<br />
Bobby prepared his ring and focused on her.<br />
<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
<br />
Amanda wasn't quite sure what to expect when she suddenly felt a wave of warmness come over her.She fell to the ground and started feeling pressure all over her body, then overwhelming pain. Amanda looked at her right hand and saw that the bones were re-arranging themselves.<br />
<br />
This feeling spread to her whole body. Amanda let out a yelp of pain as her entire skeleton was changing and growing. As this was going on, she also felt a rumbling throughout her flesh, as if she was gaining body mass. Amanda felt herself get heavier all around as her body began to lengthen.<br />
<br />
She felt significant pressure around her butt as it started to gain mass, push out and round itself. The process of her hips expanding was excruciating as she felt them widen significantly. Her once skinny legs lengthened greatly and increased in mass. She could feel the bones in her arms breaking as they lengthened and expanded.. Her waist got somewhat heavier and expanded while also lengthening. Amanda felt so many different things at once that she couldn't even process her A-cup breasts getting bigger. They expanded and got heaver, stopping at a C-cup.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, her facial bones started to reconstruct themselves. She felt her nose get a little smaller and a tiny bit less rounded. She felt the fat on her face reduce greatly as the bones rearranged to sharpen her face. Her cheekbones and jawline became more pronounced. Her lips got slightly thinner and her eyes narrowed some. The final change came to her hair as it darkened and lengthened a lot.<br />
<br />
With the changes complete, the first thing Amanda noticed was that all her clothes had torn during the process. &quot;Um, could you get me some clothes?&quot; Amanda asked before noticing that her voice had gotten much, much deeper. &quot;Holy shit, is that what I sound like?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby went back to Kaitlin's room and got underwear, a bra, a red floral top, and a white skirt. &quot;Amanda, we need to fix you up a little. Don't look in the mirror until we're done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda sat on the bed and got dressed into the clothing as she attempted to process all that had just happened. She could tell she had aged although she didn't know by how much since she couldn't see herself. &quot;Well, I'm not a kid anymore, that's for sure.&quot; Amanda said. She jumped as she was still unused to her own voice.<br />
<br />
Amanda and Kaitlin walked in with a bunch of makeup stuff and a pair of scissors. Kaitlin looked stunned as she saw her now 30-year-old daughter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...you look like a female version of Cousin It&quot; Kaitlin remarked. &quot;We need to fix that. Since you're an adult now, let's give you a new hairstyle.&quot; Amanda begrudgingly agreed. Kaitlin went to work with the scissors and after 40 minutes, Amanda's hair had gone from her ankles to above her ears, a long pixie cut. After that, they went to work on the makeup. Coral eyeshadow, black eyeliner and mascara was applied to Amanda's eyes. Pink blush was applied to her face. The look was finished off with dark red lipstick,<br />
<br />
Kaitlin started tearing up. &quot;Amanda, you look amazing.&quot; she remarked. Bobby concurred.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that's great, but I want to look at myself in a mirror.&quot; Amanda said annoyed. Kaitlin and Bobby got the long mirror from her bedroom and brought it to Amanda's room. They told Amanda to stand up and close her eyes.<br />
<br />
When she opened them, she nearly fainted.<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Amanda hyperventilated as she examined herself. <br />
<br />
She had grown a foot taller and gained 53 pounds. Her once athletic and skinny body had given way to a very curvy yet still thin body. Her ass had grown greatly. It was firm yet plump and made her skirt poke out. Her breasts had also made a big jump, to what she thought to be C cups. The floral top accentuated her cleavage and showed off her toned arms. Her legs were long and lean. Amanda's biggest shock came when she stared at her face. There wasn't an ounce of baby fat left and she definitely didn't look 21, as she had hoped. &quot;Bobby, how fucking old did you make me?&quot; Amanda barked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're 30.&quot; he replied<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy freaking shit, I can't. I just can't.&quot; Amanda then asked Bobby and Kaitlin to leave.<br />
Amanda tried to process all that had just occured. Two hours before, she was a happy 13 year old girl. Now, she was a grown, adult woman, and she wasn't sure if she liked it.<br />
<br />
She stared at the mirror for a few minutes and came to a realization: she had never looked better in her entire life.<br />
<br />
While she was very cute before, Amanda was now a sexy vixen, which excited, bothered and frightened her all at once. Amanda had prided herself on her brains, and now with 17 years essentially wiped from her life, that was gone.</p>
