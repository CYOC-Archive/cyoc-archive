<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Chronivac whirred into life and several words passed through the screen before it finally stopped on the words “Porno Mag” Jessica’s eyes widened. “What!?” She said. The Chronivac started vibrating and emitting a vail like energy and suddenly, Jessica was blind. She stayed this way for a few seconds before her vision finally returned to her but she could still barely see. There was only a thin crack of light illuminating her surroundings. She couldn’t move, only look around, as she looked down she suddenly realized she was naked… and in a rather alluring pose. She tried to move, to cover herself up but she couldn’t even budge, which she soon realized was because she was apparently… made out of paper.<br />
<br />
She stayed like this in a panic for a little while before the world around her finally began to rustle. She felt herself being lifted and carried somewhere, she heard a faint creak and finally she was lifted back down again. The pages around her began to rustle and after a little while she fancied she heard the sound of a zipper and then a moment later a soft “fap fap fap” sound. After a few seconds the pages around her rustled again briefly before stopping and leaving her with that noise again. This continued for a while, sometimes the pause between rustles would last only for a few seconds, sometimes for as long as a minute or two.<br />
<br />
After a while the page above her finally opened out and she was bathed with light. It took a minute before her eyes adjusted to the light but once they did they were greeted with a shocking sight. Sitting in his bedroom computer chair, big as a building was her younger brother, Micheal… and he was masturbating. “Oh God!” Jessica thought to herself, several things all clicking together in her brain, that’s what the noise had been. Her brother was only fourteen, he’d barely hit puberty and here she was seeing him with his dick in his hand jerking off to a porno mag. Her embarrassment worsened (if that was even possible) when she remembered with a shock that she was completely naked. “Oh god this sucks, he’s gonna think that I posed for a dirty magazine… I am never gonna hear the end of this.” In her own mind her cheeks were blushing like crazy but her face stayed unchanged, still wearing a “Well hello, there!” kind expression. But as her brother turned the page, to her surprise it was if he didn’t even recognize her. “Maybe the Chronivac made it so that while I’m in this form, it’s like this is the only form I’ve ever been in. Right now, he doesn’t even think he has a sister.”<br />
<br />
She found this interesting but was quickly pulled out of her doze by something peculiar. Not only did her brother not seem to recognize her… but he was smiling quite deviously as he looked at her. His eyes tracked down to her breasts, then to her vagina. She was MORTIFIED. “EWW EWW EWW!!!” She thought to herself as her brother leered at her most private areas. She tried to cover herself up but once again it was to no avail. His hand began to slowly stroke up and down the length of his penis as he stared intently at her nether regions. “NO!” She thought.  “Oh God NO!!!” HE WAS MASTURBATING TO HER!!! “Oh god, this is horrible.” She thought. “At least he’ll… get tired of me soon and move on soon.”<br />
<br />
She soon realized however that her brother apparently found her naked body rather attractive and continued masturbating looking at her picture, for even longer than he had with the others, swapping his gaze between her face, breasts, thighs and vagina. Eventually this went on for long enough that Jessica realized with horror the that he had chosen her picture to “finish to”. If she could have cried she would. This honestly couldn’t get any worse.<br />
<br />
The tiny bit of silver lining was that at least soon her brother would grab one of those tissues, finish and it would finally be over but as he continued, continually stroking faster and faster, he made no effort to reach for the tissues. She thought with some relief that maybe he had decided to look through the other pictures after all but his stroking speed, face and panting made it obvious that he was getting close. “But then why isn’t he…” She thought before a truly terrible, earth shattering, petrifying thought dawned on her, something that guys occasionally did with porno mags. “OH GOD NO!!! OH GOD PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE NO!!!” He was looking at her with more and more lust, his face screwing up, his stroking getting faster and faster. He was looking exclusively at her vagina now, passionately eyeing one of the few vaginas (paper though it was) that he’d ever gotten to see. Then, he looked her dead in the eye, lowered the magazine slightly, stroked even faster, and pointed the head of his cock right at her face. ‘Please…. No.” She thought, one final plea. His stoking increased, his face screwed up into a horrible expression and… a turret of warm, sticky cum shot out, right into her face. Blast after blast of the white boy-spunk coated her paper body, the first few shots aimed exclusively at her face but many of the rest hitting various parts of her body. She was made of paper but she could feel every shot. Every warm, wet sticky shot. And being made out of paper, she could even feel them seeping into her  body. She had never been so disgusted in her life. The ordeal felt like it went on for an hour.<br />
<br />
Finally the shots died down until it was just a few smaller blobs dropping onto her from the end of his cock which he was still stroking, albeit much slower now. After he was done he purveyed his masterpiece and smiled to himself, proud of the amazing job he had done. She caught one last glimpse of him as he closed the magazine thoughtlessly and she felt herself stick to the page above her. After about a day of just sitting there she felt the spunk coating her body dry and properly stick her to the page above her. Things remained fairly quiet after that. She felt the magazine get lifted again every now and then but he seemed to be satisfied with the other pictures. However lest she feel left out, he did manage to pry the pages open every now and again. Though there were many attractive women in that magazine, there was just no one else that was quite as satisfying for using as “target practice.”</p>
