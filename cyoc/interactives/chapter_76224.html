<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having worked all day Rose heads in the front door looking at her kids and her fat husband sitting and <br />
watching tv.<br />
<br />
Craig gets up and grabs her and gives her a big kiss. Having grown older this was his first time with a woman <br />
and since they were married he thought this was how it should be. <br />
<br />
She shrugged him off and said I need to get a shower. How about ordering a pizza for dinner.<br />
<br />
Again? Came a chorus from the boys.<br />
<br />
Yea again. Unless any of you made dinner. That was a joke.<br />
<br />
She headed into the bedroom of the double wide and undressed.<br />
<br />
Turning on the shower and getting it to a fairly warm temperature she stepped in and let the water drip down <br />
her aching body.<br />
<br />
When she got out of the shower she had her tattered robe around her and a thread bare towel drying her hair. <br />
As she stumbled through the door there was Craig laying on the bed beckoning Rose to come to him.<br />
<br />
I'm tired.<br />
<br />
He got up and sat at the old computer that this reality had and typed into the chornivac program. Since she <br />
wouldn't come to him he became her and she him. In what seemed like a white flash of light he was seeing from <br />
a different perspective. He saw that fat older man sitting at the desk. A bit confused but he had made Rose <br />
see this as normal. He went up behind him and rested her breasts on his back and stroking his shoulders down <br />
toward his muscle gut.<br />
<br />
He got his old body to rise and they flopped on the bed. His new body straddling the man he was. This was a <br />
new sensation for him. But the beefy man that he was now straddling made it difficult to balance. He had to <br />
hold onto his love handles as he let himself ride that thick meat he had given himself when he was Craig. It <br />
slid easily into his new pussy as though it was a common occurrence.<br />
<br />
As he rose and thrust himself on her husbands manhood he noticed that sweat beading on his nipples. She <br />
touched them and kept thrusting. It wasn't more than 10 minutes when he felt his body filled with her husbands <br />
seed. As though on que the door bell rang and Alex yelled into the bedroom. Pizza's here. I need money. <br />
<br />
Rose yelled out, get some out of my purse. That sounded very odd to him that he had a purse. But he was now a <br />
woman. <br />
<br />
Got it. Alex yelled back.<br />
<br />
Rose pulled the robe around her and his husband pulled on his boxers and a heavily stained, formerly white t-<br />
shirt over his rounded mid section and headed out to the living room.<br />
<br />
As they ate something was happening. Rose was becoming fertilized by her husbands sperm.<br />
<br />
When they woke the next morning Rose was at the computer trying to change himself back into a man but it was <br />
impossible. He was now pregnant with their 5th child and as long as he was pregnant he was unable to make any <br />
changes to his new body. He had to wait the nine months before he would be able to make any changes.<br />
<br />
When they came home from the hospital with their 5th boy, Darin. Rose rested while she recovered and she had <br />
almost forgotten about the chronivac. <br />
<br />
When she was about ready to try for a change her husband, now older and rounder came to her and they had <br />
another unbelievable night of passion. Leaving her pregnant again.<br />
<br />
This happened over and over again. Something about the new Craig made him want to have a child with Rose every <br />
year leaving her little time to change back into a man. Every year for the next 7 years they had a new child <br />
before he was able to make a change. Her body was now very voluptuous due to the added weight the pregnancies <br />
produced. And her husband had gained quite a bit of weight just has he had for their fist 4 boys. In all they <br />
had 12 boys before she changed herself back into her former self Craig but now he was less muscled and more <br />
soft due to the fact that he had now started to work at a desk rather than at the construction site.<br />
<br />
He found himself waddling. But this was an interesting new sensation in itself. He was quite enjoying it. And <br />
several of his boys were now following in his footsteps and becoming quite round themselves.</p>
