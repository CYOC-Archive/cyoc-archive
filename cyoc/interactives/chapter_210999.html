<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mist woke up. He had fallen asleep under the covers, as it had gotten a bit cold, but he was now a bit warm. He got up and stretched, noting his legs and arms already felt a bit different. He looked at his hands, and was immediately taken by the emergence of fur. It was very short at this point, and a bit spotty in terms of its coverage, but Mist nonetheless fawned over its visible silvery sheen. He also noticed his thumbs were shorter, and when he tried moving them he was less successful than usual. His fingers were also shorter, and skin had built up on the ends of them. His nails also seemed a bit sharper.<br />
<br />
He looked down at himself. His shirt was notably shorter on him, in spite of his clearly decreased height. He pulled the collar out, and noted it was a bit discolored and seemed tougher than the soft cotton the rest of the shirt was made of. His pants and underwear seemed mostly intact for now, but as he felt at his lower body, he noticed a small bulge at the end of his spine, the budding of his very own tail. This is incredible, Mist thought, trying desperately to at least wiggle it. He made his way to the mirror in the living room. He was even shorter now, probably four whole inches less than what he had started out as. His face was now exclusively in the bottom half of the hanging mirror, and it held its own changes, including pointier ears a bit higher up in slowly receding hair and a smaller nose amidst a sea of slowly growing fur. At some point, there wouldn&#39;t be a difference between his furline and his hairline.<br />
<br />
He suddenly heard someone descending the stairs, so he turned to look and saw Grace, seemingly ready for work. Mist approached her, and Grace responded by giving the top of his head a kiss. &quot;Keep Steam out of trouble, will you Mist?&quot; she said in a cute affectionate voice clearly intended for a pet.<br />
<br />
Mist watched as she made her way to the garage door, going through it before the sound of a car pulling out of the drive could be heard. He wondered if Terry also had a job, or if Grace was the family&#39;s source of income. He decided to move up the stairs to see if he was around. He came upon an open office, with Terry inside. Mist calmly entered, knowing he had full reign. A couch was situated against a wall, and Terry was seated on it, much more casually dressed than he had been yesterday evening. While not dressed like a slob, he seemed relaxed, so Mist made his way up next to him, getting onto the couch and curling up. Terry looked down at the slowly morphing pet, and wordlessly began to stroke down his back.<br />
<br />
Mist sighed, feeling each movement of his hand slide effortlessly over his body. He was just a pet to this man, a sweet little cat that deserved attention and love. Mist found himself increasingly aroused by this, but felt something a bit off. Eventually, Terry stopped, and got up from the couch, moving to his desk as Mist watched him sit down and turn it on. Mist figured he was about to start working from home, so he left the office space and decided to head to the master bathroom, finding the bedroom to it closed. Mist carefully turned the knob, struggling more than usual due to his distended fingers, and closed the door behind him. He made his way through to the master bathroom, but saw an open closet first. Curious, he moved over to it, and saw a full body mirror on the door, complete with another just in front of it. It seemed like it was being used to check the back of one&#39;s head, so Mist made a quick detour to it to check himself out.<br />
<br />
Observing himself, he pulled up his shirt. He saw his back was also covered in splotches of fur, as was his stomach and chest. Though he noted there were little bumps of flesh elsewhere along his front, and he recognized them as nipples. He tried touching one, and found it a bit sensitive, but not unpleasant. He also saw his short tail, which was thankfully entirely covered in fur and not some weird flesh lump. He moved to the master bathroom, opening it and once again closing it. He breathed in a bit, and pulled off his pants and underwear. His private area had seen some changes as well. His shaft had notably reduced in size, leaving it rather small. His scrotum had also begun to recede inward, and when he felt it he could tell his testicles had receded even further. <br />
<br />
Despite this, it was still upright, defying its fate. Mist smiled, taking a hand to it, stroking it once again. It was nowhere near yesterday&#39;s affair, but after a bit he found release from it. Despite this, nothing came out. He sort of guessed this would be the case, with what had happened yesterday in the hot tub. He put his clothes back on, and left to go to the living room. Lucy was there, waiting. Mist recalled seeing school things in her room, so he figured this must be the weekend, as he would have expected when he began. She smiled upon seeing Mist, and held a feather cat toy. Mist noted that Steam was there, as well, seeming to have been playing but losing interest, or perhaps just getting tired. Lucy held the toy up really high, trying to get it above Mist&#39;s head but at the moment failing. Mist got on all fours to make it easier for her, feeling it was a bit easier to do than it was yesterday. Lucy then wiggled the toy around, trying to entice Mist to play. While Mist didn&#39;t have the instincts to make this as alluring as Lucy perhaps hoped it would, he also wanted to make Lucy happy, so he gave his best effort to play, batting at the toy and jumping about Lucy as he went, careful to not knock into her.<br />
<br />
Eventually, he found himself exhausted. Lucy giggled, and Mist simply went up and rubbed her leg with his face, affectionately. He got some petting in response, before Lucy put the cat toy away and grabbed the TV remote. She turned it on and set it to a cartoon channel. Sitting down eagerly on the couch to watch. Mist curled up beside her, and halfheartedly watched with her, just enjoying the pets. Eventually, he fell asleep once again, his head on Lucy&#39;s leg.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day went by uneventfully. Mist found himself napping a lot, and whenever he felt like being pet he went to Lucy&#39;s room, in which she was doing a variety of activities, but she always offered some complementary pats. Terry was much more busy, so Mist left him alone until he came out to make himself lunch, which was when the bowls of cat food were refilled. Mist and Steam both eagerly approached their respective food dishes, with Steam presented with cat food while Mist looked upon a mixture of rice and chicken with what seemed like a mild curry sauce, an almost fitting enough dish for a cat. Steam didn&#39;t seem jealous of this meal at all, simply gobbling up his own. So Mist happily followed suit, eating until it was gone.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Grace returned home, greeting her daughter and husband before heading to the master bedroom. Curious about his appearance after a day of changes, Mist followed her up, and when Grace noticed him tailing her, she held the door for him as he entered. Mist walked up to the double mirrors, looking upon himself. His legs were notably shorter, and his feet were undergoing similar changes to his hands. By this point, he noted, his thumbs were less useful, while his fingers and palm had the clear impression of paw pads. His fur had also evened out, giving him a full coat of very short fur, perhaps half an inch long, while his hair was still receding. His head was also a bit differently shaped, his nose and mouth a bit further out and his skull a bit less tall. His tail poked out over his pants, a couple inches in length now. Grace pushed him out of the way at this point, though he was done looking. He started to walk away, but suddenly did a double take, seeing that she had discarded most of her clothing.<br />
<br />
Mist looked on, warily, as she looked at herself in the mirror. He grinned, realizing that he didn&#39;t deter her from this course of action at all. The thought of being so innocuous was honestly more arousing than the sight of an admittedly attractive woman right in front of him. She quickly donned less professional clothing, but his affirmed status as her pet kept him turned on. At this point, he barely felt any pressure in his pants from it. Not like he cared. He sat in front of the door and waited to be let out, like a good little cat.<br />
<br />
When it eventually opened, Mist headed out, still smug from his display of espionage. As he went down the stairs, though, he felt an increasing need to relieve himself, and not in a sexual manner. He supposed it had been some time since he had. So he made his way to the back door, opening it and closing it. As he stepped out onto the patio, he looked at the expansive back yard. He made his way to a spot on the grass that didn&#39;t seem blemished with cat dung, and pulled his pants and underwear down. He made sure to face away from the house, but he was pretty confident nobody would care regardless. He walked a bit forward, then spread his legs a bit and peed. His shrunken penis made it basically impossible to aim the stream, so he gave it a wide berth until it finally stopped. He then walked forward some more, assumed a squat, and gave a hearty push to expel his waste product onto the soft grass at his feet. After which he sighed in relief, carefully maneuvering to his pants and underwear to put them back on. He returned inside, as Steam made his way out, apparently in the mind to do his own business.<br />
<br />
Mist returned to the guest bedroom, now feeling like he could take a nap. He curled up, catlike, feeling proud of his status as a family pet. Any worries of boredom had left his mind completely. Sleep swiftly overtook him, a smile on his face ready for the changes in the coming days.</p>
