<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Naomi sighed as she sat in the basement library. <em>‘I never would have thought that the forbidden room was a magic room.’</em><br />
<br />
“Naomi,” Yukiko asked as she sat on her shoulder. “I&#39;m glad that you want to make sure I am happy but why do you want to get Sheena?” She asked with worry.<br />
<br />
Sadness filled Naomi. “I…” She paused. “I do want to make sure you are happy while I have you but. These instincts, this drive to catch her is just…”<br />
<br />
“To great for my little spider to resist.” Naomi’s mother opened the door to walk in. “It&#39;s your drider half speaking.” She smiled at her child who turned around. But she frowned at Yukiko.<br />
<br />
Yukiko gulped and gripped her master’s shoulder. “I’m... with Naomi…” She stuttered. She looked away after said that.<br />
<br />
“I am aware.” Naomi’s mother said. “But you fairies are nothing but trouble.” She shook her head. “Now getting back to what I wanted to talk about. How to track prey, like that fairy you want.”<br />
<br />
Naomi nodded, “So how do I do that?” She asked. “I know the basics of trap magic so far thanks to you but how is tracking different?”<br />
Her mother smiled, “It&#39;s not. Trap magic can be used to track. But, only if you know how to make it behave as such.”<br />
<br />
Yukiko gulped, and Naomi once again nodded, “I see mom. So, can I use that magic of yours to track her?”<br />
<br />
She smiled, “Of course! I put a little tracker in the webbing.” Those words made Yukiko pale. “It&#39;s a habit. Now then. Ready to learn?” She asked her child. “I&#39;ll show you how to track such magic and then in time you can learn how to make your own.” She crossed her and leaned against the wall.<br />
<br />
“Alright mother let&#39;s start.” Naomi nodded with a drive. “I want to learn as much as I can!”<br />
<br />
“Good,” Her mother smiled. “First I&#39;ll be teaching you how make tracking traps.” Over the course of an hour, Naomi started to take in what her mother told her. How to make the trap magic create a single for her to follow. Granted it was only the basics of making one.<br />
<br />
“You did great little Spider.” Her mother smiled.<br />
<br />
Naomi just nervously laughed, “Well it just clicked.”<br />
<br />
<em>‘Because you&#39;re half drider,’</em> Thought Yukiko as she sat worried on her master’s left shoulder.<br />
<br />
“That is good.” Mrs. Yakiyko put her hand on her child’s right shoulder. “Your instincts are what is allowing you to learn so fast.” Her cold slowly nodded. “But this is only the basics. And your latent talent will get you so far. Even of you use that fairy’s magic.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean? Mom.” Naomi asked a bit worried.<br />
<br />
Her mother crossed her arms. “You father told me before in the past. That some humans are just naturally talented in some skills while others need to practice. But the thing is no matter how skilled you are, you&#39;ll hit a wall.and have to work hard to break it down.” <br />
<br />
“That was you mother.” Naomi looked down as she said it.<br />
<br />
Her mother bit her finger for a second and signed. “Exactly but I also found ways around it. Eating other fairies.” She predatory smirked.<br />
White, Yukiko’s face went white as she gripped hard on Naomi&#39;s shoulder. Taking note of it, Naomi reached up to gently grab her pet to hold her close to her breasts. “So it&#39;ll be the same with me then.”<br />
<br />
“Exactly,” Nodded Mrs. Yakiyko. “Now getting back to the topic at hand. You only learned how to make one that needs to entangle the target to let you follow them.”<br />
<br />
Switching gears, the hybrid nodded. “So I guess I&#39;ll need to start learning how to do the more advanced trap trackers.”<br />
<br />
Her mother beamed, “In time little spider.”<br />
<br />
Naomi nodded, “Alright.”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s late and I need you to head to bed soon.” Her mother said as she walked out of the room with her child right behind. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The next day. Naomi just finished class for the day and got home. “Dad I am going into the woods for a bit.” She called out to her father. After receiving a response that she could go. She made her way out into the backyard. She stretched out her arms and made her way into the forest. ‘Time to use my human body.’ She thought. Sprinting out into the woods she had her favorite weapon on her. A compound crossbow on her back and Yukiko on her shoulders. She went deep into the woods.<br />
<br />
She stopped as she found a nice little place to set something up. A little fort, she reached out and climbed a nearby tree to get up in its branches. With a smile a few wooden planks appeared in her hands. And a hammer with a small bucket of nails. The tree that she was in hide her from being seen far away as she was covered by the leaves and branches.<br />
<br />
With a stroke of magic and with her hands she quickly made a nice flat wooden platform. She smiled as she sat on it. With a grin she then created more wood and finished it up with some short wooden railing to prevent thing from falling over her. She then looked through the tree to see something. She took out her crossbow to take aim at a fairly faraway tree. “What are you doing Naomi?” Yukiko ask as she hovered over her master’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“practicing,” she shrugged and then smirked at her. “And messing around.” She let go of the arrow to have it fly straight and true into the faraway tree. She broke into a toothy smile. “Bingo!~” She smiled. <br />
<br />
<em>‘You really are changing… no.’</em> Yukiko thought. <em>‘I only known you for a while…’</em> She shook her head. “Hit it dead on. What were you going to do?...” She stopped as she saw Naomi pulled on something. She couldn&#39;t see it but… <em>‘Its her silk….’ </em><br />
<br />
“Going to try to step up some tracking traps and trap in general.” Naomi honestly spoke. “I want to see how well I can trap animals.” She looked at the stunned fairy. “In general. I will be letting them go of course but I want to practice. And I want to see how to make a trap that no one can notice that they are in till I pull the trigger.” She pulled on her silk thread.<br />
<br />
“So you want to be able to put the tracking trap spells on them without them knowing?” Yukiko sternly and softly asked.<br />
<br />
“Pretty much!” the hybrid beamed with a huge smile. “I think this’ll be fun.” She said before she started to play for a while but as she did she thought of something. “Yukiko… is it possible for me to use my magic to track Sheena?”<br />
<br />
Yukiko nodded slowly as she floated along with Naomi who just released an animal from a trap. “Yes but you need to trace her magic…”<br />
<br />
“But I have it….” Naomi breathed. “Hers is mine now.” She paused. “But it’s weird I feel like I can track her….”<br />
<br />
“She is magicless now…” Yukiko cried. “How can you track her?”<br />
<br />
“Her soul.” Two words made Yukiko go cold. She snapped her head to look at her master and friend. “I can feel it. It feels different… not like yours…” Her happy look and aura turned gloomy. <br />
<br />
“What! Her soul!” Yukiko cried. <em>‘No way… she can do that! But even the high fairies can barely even attempt to do such a thing!’</em><br />
<br />
Naomi nodded. “I can feel her. There is another voice asking me if I want her… I keep saying yes. Its weird I feel like she is mine… a lot like you but… if it was any other fairy…. I could care less.” She paused with a hand on her elbow. She turned to look at Yukiko. “Is it possible that she is no longer a fairy?”<br />
<br />
“WHAT!” Yukiko cried. “That is not possible. There is no way without unbirthing! And even then! Once we fairly lose our magic we cannot get it back without using some other source!”<br />
<br />
“Like a battery right?” Naomi asked. “Or unbirthing another fairy to use as a power source.” She said. She blinked and took note of Yukiko’s graze face. “So you can use another fairy as a magic source.” She put her hand to her chin.<br />
<br />
“Naomi! I will not do that!” Yukiko exclaimed flustered. <em>‘Although… I am temped…’</em> She thought.<br />
<br />
Naomi nodded. “But as I said… she has the same soul but its changed…. Is that possible?”<br />
<br />
Yukiko blushed. “Yeah there is a way… more of a myth among myths.” She paused, “cyoc, the spirit of transformation. They say that you need to give something up that you treasure to change species… she might have done that to get back her magic.”<br />
<br />
Naomi nodded. “Well I want her back… I did this to her and I need to repay the favor.” She smiled. “I might be able to use my magic to bring her here.”<br />
<br />
Yukiko slowly nodded. “Sure…” She trailed off. “To you might be able to.”<br />
<br />
Naomi nodded, “Good to know. Alright let&#39;s finish up then go home.” She said. She then hummed to herself as she finished setting up the traps. Once she did that, Naomi and Yukiko returned home. After a good dinner and nights rest. The next day…</p>
