<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The sex warning is for first F/F and then F/F/M</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rose&#39;s eyes easily focused as she followed Richard into the woods with Rose at her side. The coalition meeting between her husband and Elijah Hunter had worked out quite well, and to a degree, Rose also felt she learned some things as well. For once Richard had learned all he needed in being in coalition with Elijah and thus having their pride merge with Elijah&#39;s, she and Richard would then head their own pride and Rose felt knowing some of what Richard&#39;s responsibilities would be would be helpful. For once they got to a point she would likely take on some of the responsibilities Richard had, at least with leading their small pride. Though for the moment, that pride would be a pride of three, Richard, herself, and Shelia.<br />
<br />
The sounds of Moon Lake at night easily reached her ears and she could tell that many of the other weres were enjoying themselves, either in their homes or in the woods. It let Rose&#39;s eyes drift over to Shelia as they walked along, easily avoiding trees and bushes as they walked along and their padded leonine feet disturbing little of the leaves beneath them. There was a bit of a soft glow to Shelia&#39;s eyes as they walked along, as some moonlight sunk through the branches and reflected off of Shelia&#39;s eyes, and Rose knew that her eyes were likely glowing with the same reflected light. Though what caught Rose&#39;s eyes were the generous E cup breasts on Shelia&#39;s chest and they bounced slightly as Shelia walked. The previous night, she&#39;d been fearful that Richard would leave her for Shelia because they were so different and because Rose couldn&#39;t compete with Shelia at the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... I&#39;m going to run on home to drop off the numbers and notes that Elijah gave us,&quot; Richard announced as he turned and held up the paper for Rose to see, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t be long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just be careful,&quot; Rose told him as they began to approach a spot in the woods that actually smelled rather familiar to Rose. She didn&#39;t know how she knew it, but she did, though after a moment, she soon realized that the combination of Richard and Shelia&#39;s scent wasn&#39;t just the presence of her husband and pride mate in the present, it was the scent they left behind the previous night. It was where Richard tripped on to Shelia, became a werelion and began the adventure that essentially lead them to where they were now.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be waiting for you,&quot; Shelia said with a smile, &quot;though we may get started while waiting...&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard nodded and moved off, leaving Rose to actually turn fully to Shelia. Rose’s heart beat fairly quickly and she could feel herself growing a bit wet in looking to the voluptuous and well-muscled werelioness in front of her. It was a build and a figure that Rose had been a bit jealous of after seeing the Town Chancellor transform as part of the &quot;welcome to town&quot; greeting and became even more nervous over when Richard seemed attracted to her after becoming a werelion. The fact that Shelia had seemed to offer some interest in being the on turn her was a surprise, as Rose had never expected another woman to take interest in her, particularly when at the time she wasn&#39;t in Shelia&#39;s league. A part of her had been interested, as it was something that she&#39;d &quot;dabbled&quot; with in college before meeting Richard, but at the time she&#39;d been hesitant and fearful and to a degree hurt when Richard seemed keen on the idea.<br />
<br />
But things had since changed. She&#39;d gotten confirmation that Richard saw her as the most important thing in his life by saving her from the  mundane Mountain Lion and then the two of them had their own private moment that morning. Now, Rose, herself was just as voluptuous and muscular a werelion as Shelia was. They were on par with each other now and Richard had seemed rather indulgent and accepting, though admittedly he&#39;d been a bit surprised when she&#39;d discussed with him on how their pride would be organized individually and that Shelia would get an invite.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry for getting... defensive with you last night,&quot; Rose said to Shelia as they began to approach each other, &quot;a lot of things happened so fast... I just wasn&#39;t prepared for them and fearful that once Richard changed I could never compete with you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Love isn&#39;t so much about looks,&quot; Shelia commented, &quot;and if yours and Richard&#39;s marriage is strong... it wouldn&#39;t matter what kind of were I was. You would be the one that he loves and desires the most. Which was why he was looking to you so much last night. That love is there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Rose answered, &quot;though I should have realized that at the time... but I didn&#39;t. Particularly as a part of me was tempted by the offer you made... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You came from a happy monogamous marriage,&quot; Shelia finished with a nod, &quot;it&#39;s understandable... and in some ways I may have been a bit over eager to be part of a pride that I didn&#39;t... well, give you both time to adapt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I have adapted,&quot; Rose smiled, &quot;and thankful that Richard had no issue with my being bi and that you weren&#39;t frustrated by my frustration... as there was a part of me that did consider that offer seriously.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; Shelia answered as she approached and wrapped her arms around Rose&#39;s hips, and giving Rose&#39;s butt a slight squeeze, &quot;and being bi... that only adds to to the fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shelia pulled the two of them closer and leaned in for a bit of a kiss. It then pressed their breasts together and Rose felt her nipples growing erect and pressing against Shelia&#39;s. The kiss was a bit awkward, though more because a lion&#39;s muzzle wasn&#39;t easily designed for human kissing, but she did manage to return it while wrapping her arms around Shelia&#39;s hips to squeeze the other werelioness&#39;s bottom while feeling Shelia&#39;s paws grope her own rear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never been with a woman before,&quot; Rose slowly moaned feeling her arousal continue to rise.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; Shelia smiled, &quot;just mirror what I do...&quot; And then moved one hand to massage at the outer lips of Rose&#39;s vagina, &quot;in some ways... it&#39;d be like being with Richard in terms of being with another person and when you were young and looking for a way to please yourself. And I&#39;ll talk you through it as we go and while waiting for Richard to return and join us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose only found herself giving a growling moan as Shelia continued to gently rub two fingers over Rose&#39;s clit, which was now beginning to become more erect as well.  And then Shelia began to make her way down Rose&#39;s chest with a series of kisses and licked, while Rose was only left to try and reach for Shelia&#39;s breasts with her own paws, though as Shelia got to her knees, those large firm breasts were a bit beyond Rose&#39;s reach and she remained standing, looking a bit nervous, though also feeling her levels of pleasure rising.<br />
<br />
&quot;The one part that would be solely with a partner... would be where it&#39;s best to be careful with your teeth,&quot; Shelia looked up with a smile, &quot;but it&#39;s something can make things feel very good...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...&quot; Rose was about to ask when she felt Shelia&#39;s tongue lack and her vagina and with it&#39;s tip flick at her clit. The spines on Shelia&#39;s tongue were a bit rough, but the lick was gentle and allowed for that rough tongue to tickle more than anything else and Rose responded accordingly, &quot;aaaarrrrrrrrroooooooaaaaaaaooooooooooooooo.... that... that was good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it can go both ways,&quot; Shelia smiled while running one hand to her own vagina with her arousal growing and offering another hand to Rose. &quot;In a sixty-nine position.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose carefully got down her knees and leaned in to kiss at Shelia&#39;s muzzle with her own, trying to mimic the licks and kisses that Shelia had given her as they got started. Shelia moaned a bit as Rose licked at one nipple while she reached to massage the other. Shelia also gently messaged at Rose&#39;s breasts as well, earning a few small moans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your breasts feel nice,&quot; Rose said weakly as she looked up Shelia&#39;s generous orb.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do yours,&quot; Shelia smiled, &quot;and now no one has any reason to be jealous. And it will be fun...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m not... good...&quot; Rose managed weakly as she managed to get down and roll onto her back. <br />
<br />
It gave her a direct look up to the tannish gold fur around Shelia&#39;s vagina. The clit was erect and ready and Shelia&#39;s own growing arousal easily reached Rose&#39;s muzzle and it only drove Rose&#39;s own arousal further.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Shelia assured her, &quot;you&#39;re just new to this.... and having your first time with a woman being after you&#39;ve gained fur and fangs may seem intimidating, but it&#39;s okay. It&#39;s where practice makes perfect... If need be... just match what I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shelia then bent at her hips to lower herself down. She rested her elbows on the ground and used her hands to gently open Rose&#39;s legs a bit before moving in to lick at Rose&#39;s own vagina and the tannish gold fur around it. It raised low moan from Rose, though it wasn&#39;t too long before Shelia felt Rose&#39;s arms go out and around the back of Shelia&#39;s legs and with her hand then pressing on Shelia&#39;s inner thighs. Shelia then gave a low rumble as Rose lifted her own muzzle and gave an inquisitive lick at Shelia&#39;s own opening. That did raise a heavy moan from Shelia as well. From there, Shelia and Rose went at it, both licking at each other&#39;s slit and giving mild moaning roars in the process. Rose grateful in that Shelia never critiqued her attempts, but she had some sense that she was having some success given the moans that came from Shelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m... I&#39;m gonna cum...&quot; Rose moaned heavily as she saw Shelia&#39;s tail shake with pleasure. She knew she was getting close, and out of the corner of her eye she saw that Richard was returning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do it...&quot; Shelia moaned back, &quot;Let... me... taste... your... cream... and then... you... can taste... mineoooooOOOOAAAARRRROOOOO!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Shelia erupted in orgasm at about the same time that Rose did, leaving both enjoy the feeling and the &quot;taste&quot; of the other with their own pleasure filled roars.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Shelia said bending her head down to look to Rose, who looked up, &quot;not bad for your first time with another woman. And your cream... is nice...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yours too,&quot; Rose answered, privately wondering if Richard liked or remembered that taste, &quot;though now... I think it&#39;s time you got a bit more than just tongue... Right, Richard?&quot;<br />
<br />
That got Shelia to shift her head to see that Richard had in fact returned and was casually standing near another tree, with one hand running over the length of his now fully erect shaft. That was more than enough to keep her wet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust you enjoyed the show?&quot; Shelia teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; Richard smiled, &quot;mostly because it portrayed my wife enjoying her time with the one that turned me... I dropped the notes that Elijah gave me off at home, and things seemed quiet there. And so I came back and found two beautiful werelionesses having a good time. And one having her first time with another woman. And who am I to deny Rose her moment?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now it&#39;s time for our pride to truly cum together,&quot; Rose insinuated and licked at Shelia&#39;s clit again, &quot;Don&#39;t you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Richard answered as he moved behind Shelia.<br />
<br />
Shelia watched as Richard aligned himself from behind her and felt Rose spreading vaginal lips for the erection. Shelia obliged him by moving her tail to a side and let him enter her from behind. She breathed out a very heavy moan as she felt Richard&#39;s large werelion penis enter moist opening and was then doubly pleased as Rose licked her clit again, as well as at Richard&#39;s penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhhhhhhhh... that... IS good...&quot; Shelia breathed and then leaned down to lick at Rose&#39;s vagina and clit again and getting the sense that they&#39;d switch positions after Richard&#39;s orgasm...</p>
