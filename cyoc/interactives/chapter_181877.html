<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lina let out a yawn as the morning light came through the lounge window, the sound of the birds that now lived in the greenhouse could be herd throughout the train, their morning melody was always a welcome sound in the morning, it had been five weeks since the battle between Storm and the queen&#39;s flying soldiers, and all had been peaceful for the most part as they cruised atop the clouds, life in general had become more calm.<br />
<br />
Lina stretched our her arms and legs, her fingers brushing the silk curtain that encircled the sofa bed, that&#39;s when she herd someone sigh with content, looking down she saw that Viki had her head upon Linas breast, her hand resting on her own belly, while Lucy had taken the other side of Linas body, her head was resting atop Lias belly, gently kissing its rubber surface as she looked up at Lina with a loving smile, Lina simply sighed sleepily and draped her arms over both of her wives, Yes after the attack and Echo deciding to become a separated triplet divided between her mommies, the trio had decided to tie the knot, all three of them now wearing a silver ring on their ring fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning beautiful&quot; said Lucy as she reached up to give Lina a kiss, Lina happily kissing her back, before they both herd a groan on the other side of Lina, they both looked to see Viki petting her belly, trying to calm one of Echos triplets, Viki had named her triplet Chloey, which Lina found to be adorable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey your other wife is in need of a good morning kiss as well&quot; said Viki with a smile as she proped herself up on one elbow to get a better angle of Linas lips, which she took full advantage of, Lina was left Moaning into Vikis mouth as Her tongue danced with her own, Linas eyes soon shot wide as she felt Lucy&#39;s tongue invading her neathers, Lina gave a deep groan as she tilted her hips forward to alow Lucy better access, Lucy was not one to question pleasuring her wife better as she dove her young deeper into Linas folds.<br />
<br />
Lina lay there, her eyes rolled back and letting out lewd moans and crys of pleasure whenever she and Viki broke off there passionate kiss for air, Vikis hand suddenly vanished behind the hill ov Linas belly, slowly tracing down its underside towards her nethers, Viki gave an evil grin as she straddled over the top of Linas head, her pussy glistening in the morning light, Viki looked down at Lina passed the swell of Echos sibling, grinning playfully at Lina &quot;does my wife enjoy this view?&quot; Said Viki seductively as she swayed her ass slowly from side to side.<br />
<br />
&quot;I most certainly do&quot; Slurred Lina as she slowly draged her tongue along Vikis pussy, Viki letting out a long moan &quot;well we&#39;ve all been married for five weeks and I&#39;m yet to give either of my wives breakfast in bed, mmmmmmmmmm&quot; said Viki as she let out a lewd moan as Lina dove her tongue in and out of Vikis love tunnel.<br />
<br />
Then everyone felt it, the babies in Linas womb, all three women jumped back as quickly as they could, Lina chuckled as she looked down at her translucent midsection to see Storm and Echo staring wide eyed out into the world, Echo looked intrigued about the movement that woke her up, she was stretching out while looking around, before looking up to look at Lina, as she looked down to meet Echos gaze, then Echo put her thumb in her mouth and began to roll over, causing Linas belly to go lop sided.<br />
<br />
Storm however looked extremely unhappy, a angry look on her face from being woken up, she had her wings folded across her body, Lina couldn&#39;t help but laugh, Storm was a seven month old baby, yet her expression made her look like a toddler in a strop, then Lucy lay her head on top of Linas belly &quot;good morning little ones, sorry your mommies woke you up&quot; said Lucy as she rubbed circles on the side of Linas belly, Storm lazily punched and kicked about as Echo continued to roll around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well, a lie in would have been nice, but the children are up and hungry&quot; said Lina as she sat up and grabbed a white silk nightgown from the foot of the sofa bed, it had been decided that the woman abord the train would wear something somular to this, instead of just walking around in their bare rubber, it made them feel more comfortable plus it gave the unborn babies some peace, being covered and shaded.<br />
<br />
Lina had walked through the medway car and the greenhouse car before finally arriving in the newly built cafeteria car, all made from white synthetic metal on the outside, a marble textured floor that would shine in the sunlight, the roof of the car was made completely from glass with a half barrel shape with black carbon ribs along the inside, grape vines clinging to the carbon supports and hanging down, giving the room a eco friendly feel, the wall to the left was a solid sky blue with a oak wood trim, while the right side had a new pice of technology installed by Sofia.<br />
<br />
It was a type of produce processing technology, there was a sliding wooden panel on the right side of the mechanism where fresh produce would be placed, then the machine would sort and deep freeze the food for future use and preparation, the center console was a big touch screen with a marble cover, the large screen would alow anyone abord to choose from a verity of food choices available to anyone, then there were two tin looking shutters, one at eye level and one level with the midsection, the top shutter is where the selected food would be collected once ready, and the bottom shutter is where the dish would go once finished to be cleaned and ready for another use.<br />
<br />
&quot;What should we have this morning Hey girls?&quot; Said Lina as she rubbed over the silk compering her maternal swell as she looked at the breakfast menu, finally settling on sausage egg and toast, there were no livestock abord the train, but the synthetic meat and eggs tasted exactly like the real thing, Lina guessed if she were to eat a real sausage l, then a sausage made from Sofia and Catherine&#39;s synthetic food processor she wouldn&#39;t be able to tell which was which, Not long after ordering, the rest of the people abord the train began coming in, all eager for breakfast, Sofia waddled up to Lina with a smile &quot;good morning captain, I was just on the command deck and Alice wishes to speak with you&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice was the name Lucy and Lina had given the AI that monitored the trains systems, to be honest Lina had felt bad calling her &quot;AI lady&quot;, she made sure everything ran smoothly, giving her a name was the least Lina could do &quot;ok il go see her as soon as I get my breakfast&quot; said Lina, Sofia patted her on the sholder &quot;il bring it up to you, it sounded urgent, whatever she has picked up on the scanners can&#39;t be good&quot; said Sofia, Lina gave a defeated sigh and started waddling towards the command car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning mam&quot; came Alice&#39;s voice from the heads speakers &quot;good morning Alice, how are the trains diagnostic scans today&quot; said Lina running through her morning duties &quot;stable and holding mam&quot; replied Alice &quot;how do thing look on the ground&quot; Asked Lina, this time Alice did not respond for a few moments &quot;that is why I wanted to see you so urgently mam, we have movement from capital city, large groups of land based soldiers moving to all compass points&quot; said Alice as she displayed a holographic map of the super continent, and sure enough there were eight large forces moving out, almost creating a octagonal shape with the red masses positions &quot;there apeares to be a detection of raised adrenaline and blood pressure within an occupant in your abdominal region mam&quot; said Alice as Lina clutched her belly, as Echo and Storm thrashed around, causing Luna to do the same, Lina desperately cooed to her belly and rubbed it in wide circles as she parted the silk gown from her midsection, trying to calm her children.<br />
<br />
Just then there was a burning sensation on her peacock design on her left arm, scorching pain, like a branding iron had just been pressed into her arm, but she couldn&#39;t scream out in pain, then just as quickly as the pain started, it stopped, Lina then pulled the silk sleeve away from her arm and saw that the design was different, under the peacocks tail was now a green king cobra with white eyes, and behind the head of the peacock was now a white six winged bird with ice blue fire for eyes<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry mother&quot; came Storms little voice &quot;since we are in your comfy womb we can&#39;t hold or be in contact with our medallions, so now YOU are our medallion&quot; Lina thought about this before turning to the holographic map, watching as two of the red masses had changed corse and were heading back towards capital city &quot;so does that mean that there is one of you at each corner of this super contaminant?&quot; Asked Lina &quot;that&#39;s right mommy, our sisters are all stuck in their medallions&quot; said Echo as her voice rang out in Linas mind &quot;we don&#39;t know why the nasty queen wants us but it&#39;s probably to do bad things, I want to stay with my mommies&quot; said Echo as she began to cry, setting off Storm and Luna in the process, Lina cradled her womb swaying back and forth &quot;Don&#39;t you worry princess, me and your mommies are going to keep you all safe, you, Storm,Luna, Chloey and Mary, as well as all your sisters out there&quot; said Lina as Sofia came in with her breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it that Alice told you the news, and judging by the look on your face you have a plan&quot; smirked Sofia as she place Linas breakfast on the round wooden table &quot;Sofia were going to need off road ground vehicles and equipment, we&#39;ve got to beat as many of that hive queen&#39;s troops to each destination&quot; said Lina as she waddled over to the table &quot;Alice change corse to.......&quot;</p>
