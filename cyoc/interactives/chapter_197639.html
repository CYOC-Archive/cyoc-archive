<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darren nodded, his teachers already seemed to have deduced everything about him, might as well show them what he could do. First though, he needed to know something. &quot;So where&#39;s Misaki? Wasn&#39;t she watching you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No my mom was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Abolith is watching you,&quot; Darren, Steph, and Hannah exclaimed. All three now sprinted towards the windows, anxiously looking around the neighborhood. The three of them knew the elf assassin wouldn&#39;t be far behind the kits. The only question was how good of a mood she would be in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s Abolith and why are you freaking out,&quot; Gail asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s Raidens mom,&quot; Hannah replied anxiously. &quot;And trust me! You do not want to be on her bad side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate the comment child.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren, Hannah, and Steph now jumped in alarm  turning towards the rear of the house. Abolith now stood before them, the assassin staring at the teens with only her fierce crystal blue eyes visible. &quot;How did you get in my house,&quot; Hannah asked, the teenage Soul Drives voice barely more than a whisper. &quot;Magic? Skills? Some long forgotten elf technique no one is aware of?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your backdoor was unlocked,&quot; Abolith replied flatly, gesturing behind her. Darren now stifled a laugh as Abolith studied her sons friends. &quot;Raiden,&quot; she asked. &quot;Care to introduce me to your friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay mom,&quot; Raiden replied. &quot;This is Gail, Pam, Stella, Ewart, and Neela.&quot; The five teenage prodigies now gave the assassin a polite, if nervous wave as she continued to study them. Slowly, Abolith now removed her shawl and veil, revealing her delicate elven features and fire red hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Abolith,&quot; she stated. &quot;From what I have heard you five are teachers.&quot; Slowly the elf now approached, her eyes narrowing as she studied the young teens. &quot;I&#39;m surprised to hear this,&quot; she said. &quot;You seem far too young to be scholars.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm were geniuses Ms.,&quot; Pam replied meekly. &quot;All of us graduated from college when we were 12.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Despite our youth we&#39;re actually prodigies,&quot; Gail added. &quot;According to most of the adults we&#39;ve talked with we&#39;re some of the most gifted and natural talents in our fields.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always believed that experience is a truer measure of one&#39;s abilities,&quot; Abolith replied, a sour look crossing the prodigies faces. They were accustomed to grownups being dismissive of their skills because of their youth. &quot;However,&quot; Abolith added. &quot;My son as well as the Catalyst speak very highly of you. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teens now gave the elf a curious look, watching her bow slightly as a token of respect. Glancing at Darren they could see the teen sheepishly rubbing his neck. Darren hadn&#39;t expected, nor wanted Abolith sharing his opinions on his teachers. &quot;Nice to meet you too,&quot; they replied. It was now Ewart that stepped forward, the teenage boy slightly smitten by the attractive auburn haired woman in front of him, an emotion that Abolith immediately picked up on. &quot;Stop gawking boy and ask your question!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um sorry,&quot; Ewart muttered. &quot;I&#39;m curious...why is everyone so nervous around you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably because of what I am,&quot; Abolith smirked. &quot;And I don&#39;t mean my elven heritage.&quot; The teens now cast a curious look at one another before looking to Raiden. &quot;Mom is a cleaner,&quot; Raiden said happily. &quot;She cleans up messes for people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shes a janitor,&quot; Stella asked, raising an eyebrow. Abolith chuckled, turning to her son and Sachiko. &quot;Raiden your grandmother is in the backyard. She would very much like to see you and Sachiko.&quot; Raiden gasped, a wide smile spreading across his face as he now took Sachikos hand and sprinted outside. As soon as the kits were out of earshot, Abolith turned a stern expression crossing her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m an assassin child,&quot; she stated, her eyes seeming to burn into the prodigies. &quot;A warrior, a mercenary. Your students are correct to tread carefully around me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait you kill people,&quot; Neela exclaimed. The young Indian teen now stomped forward, turning her eyes up as she glared at the elf. &quot;How can you kill people?! And for money no less! Do you think that makes you special?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith narrowed her gaze, the elf leaning in to glare at the girl. &quot;Mind your tongue child,&quot; she snarled. &quot;Before I cut it out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not scared of you,&quot; Neela replied defiantly, the teen placing her hands on her hips. &quot;You just seem like a big bully to me! I don&#39;t know how Raiden turned out so nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um Neela,&quot; Ewart stammered. &quot;Maybe nows not the time to get in the face of a professional killer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would listen to your boyfriend child,&quot; Abolith stated. Neelas face turned red, both in anger and embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hes not my boyfriend!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay stop,&quot; Darren exclaimed. Everyone now turned to him, the teen looking somewhat flummoxed by the commotion. &quot;Okay look. Yes, Abolith is a...um..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Killer,&quot; Neela grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Darren said sheepishly. &quot;But, she&#39;s been helping me lately. Things have been rather...uh... weird lately. We kinda have a common enemy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how I feel about you hanging around with a mercenary Darren,&quot; Stella stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me child,&quot; Abolith grumbled. &quot;I am not happy with this arrangement either. However, Darren has protected my son and my beloved seems to trust him. Even if he is a wizard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have SOOOO many questions,&quot; Gail moaned. &quot;And believe me I plan to ask them. But, I still want to see Darren perform magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans and magic,&quot; Abolith scoffed. &quot;I have never understood the appeal. For elves magic has always been present and in my opinion highly overrated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why don&#39;t you let Darren try his magic on you,&quot; Neela smirked. Abolith now gave the girl a incredulous look. If she wasn&#39;t friends with her son she would have knocked her out. Neela was obviously overconfident and fearless. Two qualities Abolith begrudgingly respected but hated being confronted with. &quot;I doubt his magic would work on me,&quot; she scoffed. &quot;Elves have a natural resistance to magic and I have had my resistance strengthened exponentially.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it would be a challenge then &quot; Gail stated. Abomith simply nodded, narrowing her eyes at the teens. She didn&#39;t like where this was headed. &quot;I suppose,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;However, I do not like the idea of the Catalyst useing his magic on me. In case you have forgotten boy, I wished to kill you when you performed magic on my beloved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Stella smirked. &quot;If what you say about your resistance is true than you should have nothing to worry about. I don&#39;t know about you guys but I want to see what Darren can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
A chorus of encouragement now seemed to echo throughout Hannah&#39;s living room. Darren&#39;s teachers egging him on to perform a spell. &quot;Never thought my own teachers would apply peer pressure to me,&quot; he thought. Sighing, Darren nodded. He would try his magic on Abolith, and pray she didn&#39;t kill him for it afterwards.<br />
<br />
Darren now focused on Abolith, studying the elf assassin thoroughly. She wasn&#39;t kidding when she said she had resistance to magic. Darren felt as if he was trying to walk through theigh deep mud. The teens mind feeling as if he was in a fog. Straining he now tried to change Abolith, his eyes going wide as he saw her transform.<br />
<br />
Aboliths face was beginning to soften, the fierceness of her face slowly being smoothed away. Abolith was growing younger, her face becoming delicate, rounder, more innocent. The elves eyes becoming wider, larger, yet maintaining their intensity.<br />
<br />
Darren now noticed her body. Although the elf was fully clothed, Darren could see her lithe form and firm muscles. Abolith was in peak physical condition, possessing the body of an Olympic athlete with C cup breasts. Now though her body was thinning, her muscles seeming to deflate, her breasts firming and losing mass.<br />
<br />
The teens now watched as Abolith reentered her teens. The elves curves melting away as well as her height. Aboliths clothing growing baggier, the elves face looking more youthful and innocent with each passing second. As Darren completed the spell, he slumped to the floor in exhaustion. The others rushing to his side in concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you it wouldn&#39;t work,&quot; Abolith said. The elf now paused, her hand flying to her mouth. She had sounded so young. Quickly glancing over herself, her jaw went slack. Her body was skinny, her breasts conical, hardly able to fit a B cup. Slowly she turned staring wide eyed at the others. &quot;I&#39;m....I&#39;m...I&#39;m...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirteen,&quot; Darren sighed. &quot;And it was harder than I thought it would be.&quot; <br />
<br />
Abolith now sprinted for a mirror, quickly picking it up and gawking at her young teenage face. &quot;My God,&quot; she whispered. &quot;You...you turned me into a child!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t look so scary now,&quot; Neela grinned as she now stood next to the teenage assassin. &quot;In fact I might actually be taller than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith frowned, which at her current age made her look more like a petulant teenager. &quot;I maybe smaller and younger girl but I&#39;m still far more skilled than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren sighed, wiping his brow as he now watched the teenage Abolith talk with his teachers. He had shown what his magic could do, now hopefully he wouldn&#39;t have to break up a cat fight between his teachers and a teenage assassin.</p>
