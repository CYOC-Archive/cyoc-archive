<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Before reading this chapter, please re-read <a href="/interactives/chapter_159718.html">#159718</a>, which is the previous one.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Neptune, with the help of her father, had finally succeeded in making Colin&#39;s grand-parent understand what his mental-bond with her meant for him and how it was just a link and not an outright mental-fusion, not even a partial one, when she felt her mother contact her to serve as intermediary between said goddess and Colin. Not that Neptune&#39;s mother wasn&#39;t able to communicate directly with him, or that she risked turning Colin&#39;s brain into mush, but the goddess insisted that every drakonoïd was drilled since even before hatching to never communicate telepathically with a non-drakonoïd unless they were bound to said individual, so they would never telepathically ‘speak’ to an unbound one out of habit an destroy their brain, (better safe than sorry, after all) and believed in applying what she preached.<br />
<br />
The young dragoness was surprised when her mother revealed the Journal of Fact had somehow found its way to Colin, but was proud of how he had used it to better his sister&#39;s life, along with his parent&#39;s. (Even if she didn&#39;t remember things ever being different.)<br />
<br />
Then the goddess explained how she hoped Colin would have and idea of what to write in the Journal to incite drakonoïds to be more kind and supporting to the disabled members of their kin, a bit like what he did with humans when he improved his sister&#39;s life. Not that any dragon or kobold had ever been insensitive on purpose, but even done unintentionally it was a problem.<br />
<br />
Colin was surprised by the goddess request, and even more when at the question &quot;What kind of disability exist among dragons? And what about the one found among kobolds?&quot; he got an answer that basically mean &quot;all and every kind&quot;. (But far more detailed than that.) He then surprised both Nep&#39; and the goddess by asking if it was possible for a dragon to survive the death of their ‘kobold’, and if it was the same the other way around.<br />
<br />
He discovered that, if a kobold died, its dragon was then free to bind itself to another one. (Which they usually did, since they would die from a lack of hygiene otherwise.) On the flip side things were more complexes. If a dragon died, their kobold only have a few minutes at most to link themselves to another dragon, be it one that didn&#39;t have a kobold yet, one that lost their own kobold and didn&#39;t have a new one yet, or one that hadn&#39;t hatched yet. Let say that very few kobold survive the death of their dragon.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s how the goddess had ended up with a kobold of her own. She didn&#39;t really need one, but he would have died otherwise. A decision she never had regretted, especially since in the long run it let her find something she never thought she would : Love.<br />
<br />
But with all that, Colin was having an idea on how to process. Taking his mechanical pencil, he started to write &quot;Kamélia is only a nickname for my sister&#39;s manager, based on her love for the Camellia flowers. She is a blind kobold who&#39;s name don&#39;t exist in oral form, since she isn&#39;t and never was bound to a human. Because of an anomaly in her D.N.A. her eyes don&#39;t have any cones or rod cells, being instead covered by a mirror like surface hiding even her eyes&#39; blood vessels and her optical nerves. Something very easy to see since that same defect somehow caused the absence of any iris and made her pupils be totally see-through. Not daring to ask for help, fearing to be mocked since, as far as she knew, the others could clean their dragons properly, causing her own to eventually die of an infection. Before she could die herself, a dragon hatchling touched her. At first she feared very much said hatchling would end the same way as her previous dragon, but then the goddess and her husband learned of her struggle. The blind kobold then learned the goddess&#39; husband needed help to clean his wife because of how big she was, like any kobold that was bound to a very old dragon, especially if said kobold don&#39;t have a twin. (From &quot;venerable dragon&quot; and up, if you use how humans call the different live-stages of a grown-up dragon.)&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From then, Kamélia grew into a very confident kobold.&quot; Then, thinking he could also help homosexual peoples, (after all, if homosexuality is respectable enough for a well know kobold, why wouldn&#39;t it be for humans?) Colin added &quot;She&#39;s also a lesbian who, somehow, dated fare more humans than she did fellow kobolds during her long life.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a good start, especially since he only used conditions that already existed among drakonoïds (even if he combined multiples handicaps for poor Kamélia) but before the goddess and her daughter could wonder where he was going with this, he continued. &quot;About Kamélia&#39;s current dragon, he was born with a very rare form of dwarfism that only exist among his species : not only his body never grew, making him look almost like a hatchling, but his bones aren&#39;t hollow anymore, and nothing can be done about any of it.&quot; Again, Colin had only described a preexisting condition among dragons. &quot;Because of the problem it would otherwise cause, the ability to mature sexually is always surgically removed in such a dragon.&quot; <em>Yes, it would kill them otherwise. That said, they are so small very few survive the surgery</em> thought the goddess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, it cause this dragon, nicknamed Bitsize by friendly humans, to be a bit childish, especially for the great-dracosir he became a few month back. That said, he is almost always with Kamélia, having sworn he would serve as her eyes. (He only separate when she goes to the bathroom or if she&#39;s going to have sex.) Kamélia who proved to be uniquely adept at cleaning a dragon so small, but it doesn&#39;t provide her with enough food. Thankfully, she can count on her friends among the oldest dragons and their kobolds to bring her some of their surplus of draconic-grubbiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bitsize is one of those dragons with the same element as his main and secondary one: Air. It&#39;s why he is able to fly regardless of his bones problem, and only since he was a venerable dragon. Kamélia, for her part is a sound elemental, because it was one of the two elements of her first dragon.&quot;<br />
<br />
The goddess reflected on Colin&#39;s choice. Not only had he done just what she had asked, and made it without creating new disability, he had made it quite the ancient thing, so much dragons were fare more aware of the problem than before reality was altered. Not only that, but he also made it an incentive for at least part of humanity to be more tolerating of homosexuality. (Or at least of lesbians.) He also took into account that a kobold only had one element, and correctly guessed they inherited it from their <strong>first</strong> dragon.<br />
<br />
Sure, he had turned a perfectly fine woman into a blind kobold with an antediluvian child for dragon, but he hadn&#39;t really intended to and, as a goddess, she knew all too well that sacrifices needed to be done for the greater good. She was really proud of Colin, and wanted him to know it.</p>
