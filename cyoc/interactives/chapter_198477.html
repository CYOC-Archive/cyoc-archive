<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Cody looked around the people who were in or around the large community pool, a small group of people entering the pool area from the other gate caught his attention. A lady in her mid-forties was pushing a wheelchair which was carrying a much older woman, who was wearing a bathing suit while clenching a long beach towel. They settled in around a large umbrella which had three lounge chairs near the umbrella and the small table. Cody got closer to he could listen in on the conversation by sitting on one of the vacant chairs while drinking from a bottle of water. <br />
<br />
“Oh, Mother Henriette. It was time to get you out of the house. The weather was nice, and a little sun is good for you. You haven’t left the house for the past five months due to the cold and the snow. Enjoy yourself. Look at all the kids in the pool, ma!” the woman said to the lady in the wheelchair. <br />
<br />
“Ugh!” the older lady spat. “I could swim, much better than any of these kids! I was the top swimmer in the whole state! I have dozens of trophies, medals, and awards to prove it! I was the best and the fastest swimmer around! I could swim circles around these kids!” <br />
<br />
“Ma, that was over sixty years ago! You’re much older now, so give these kids a chance! You need to be cheering on the next generation of kids, so somewhere among the crowd some other boy or girl can emerge like a top-level swimmer, just like you were back in the day!” the younger woman named Caroline said to the grandma. <br />
<br />
“Discipline! It takes discipline and hard work, and I don’t see that in this generation at all! Ugh…” she sighed. “I’m going out to the park to get some fresh air!”<br />
<br />
Grandma Henriette Sharkeling rolled her wheelchair back out the door and through the corridor of the building into the back parking lot, where there was a nice park with many flowers and trees. Little did she know that Cody was quietly walking behind her from a distance. <br />
<br />
When Henriette parked her wheelchair under the shade of a tree, she nodded off for a moment while holding on to the bath towel. That was when Cody emerged from hiding and pointed his remote at the elderly woman. <br />
<br />
“Time for Grandma to relive her glory days as a swimmer. If she was awesome as a girl, can you imagine how she would be as a fifteen-year-old teenage boy with muscles? He would be amazing!” Cody smiled, as he entered the settings on the remote before pointing the device at the elderly woman while pressing the big, red “Transform” button. <br />
<br />
“Uhhhhhh” Grandma Henriette moaned softly, as her entire body began to change rapidly. <br />
<br />
Her wrinkled skin became nice and smooth again, as she de-aged from her nineties to a much younger age. Her breasts shrunk down quickly, leaving behind a pair of firm pectorals on her chest. Her flat stomach began to form well-defined abdominal muscles, which she hadn’t had since she was a teenage swimmer, over eighty years ago. Her old, weak, short and wrinkled legs suddenly firmed up as they grew longer and toned, with big, solid and strong, firm muscles everywhere.<br />
<br />
“Ohhhh… What… What is happening… to me?” her voice spoke, sounding a few octaves deeper than before.<br />
<br />
Her wrinkled old face changed completely, as her skin became soft and smooth. She became more youthful as her face, neck and hands reshaped. Her nose and mouth reshaped, and she gained a firm, square jaw, giving her a more masculine look. Her old, white eyebrows became thick and dark again. Her shoulders widened as mighty delts and traps filled out her once frail upper body as muscles bulged everywhere.<br />
<br />
Big biceps and triceps filled her arms, making her frame too big for her old swimsuit. As she grew, she gradually ripped out of her swimsuit. She used the towel to cover her growing body as she struggled to pull the old swimsuit off of her and throw it in the trash can, which was right next to where the wheelchair was parked. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the wheelchair, she leaped out of the chair, quickly covering herself with the bath towel. Her legs were long and strong now, and she noticed how she regained the ability to walk again!<br />
<br />
She looked around and ran into the building, passing a small mirror which hung on the wall. She stopped and looked at her reflection, noticing how much she looked like a boy! So, she ran into the men’s restroom, where she removed the towel and discovered that her vagina had disappeared, only to be replaced by a penis with testicles! He was a BOY!<br />
<br />
Holding the towel around his waist, he walked out and headed straight for the swimming pool when several other boys spotted him.<br />
<br />
“Hey, it’s Henry the Shark!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, wow! This dude is like the best swimmer around here!” another boy said. <br />
<br />
“Whoa! This guy is going to the Olympics for sure!” <br />
<br />
Henry quickly ran up to his mother (who used to be her daughter), who was waiting for him. <br />
<br />
“Henry! I got your Speedo in my bag, sweetie! Go and change in the dressing room, honey!” Caroline said to him. “You just came from school, and you forgot your swimwear!” <br />
<br />
Henry took the Speedo and ran back into the restroom. As he dropped the towel while he stood before the mirror, he looked at his amazing physique. <br />
<br />
He was ALL muscle. He was big, tall, and STRONG. His legs were all cords of muscle, and his torso was all abs and pecs. He had that tall, lean muscle build that all swimmers craved, with broad shoulders and thick, strong arms. He stood over 6-foot-2 inches tall, which was tall for a fifteen-year-old who was still growing. But he was a swim champion, and everyone knew it!<br />
<br />
As he ran out of the dressing room, he dashed to the pool where he dove head-first into the deep end of the pool. All the kids were gawking at the athlete, who came for a casual swim at the public pool before heading to practice for a few hours.<br />
<br />
Once the coach arrived, everyone had to get out, except Henry and the other members of the swim team. Things were about to get serious and swim training was about to start and go on for the next three hours. And Cody looked on, feeling satisfied that he had performed a good deed by changing the old grandma into the newest member of the school’s swim team. <br />
<br />
As Cody looked around, he began to wonder who and where he would use his remote, next?</p>
