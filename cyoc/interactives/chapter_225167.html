<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A guy in the back of the audience yelled out, &quot;Make him a toilet like you suggested to the other guy!&quot;  &quot;Okay, then.&quot;, said Madame Illusia.  A cloud formed and showed an image of a run-down bathroom.  the tan tiles on the floor and walls were the ugliest and oldest David had ever seen.  There was shit smeared on the walls and in one section where it met the floor, it was stained a deep yellow indicating that someone pissed there.  Cobwebs with spiders clung to the sole window.  At one time, it opened, but it had rusted shut.  The window pain had a starburst crack.  A couple of flies buzzed around, one depositing a maggot on the shit smear on the wall.  The entire place clearly had dirt stains everywhere.  On the side of another other wall, a patch of black mold made it&#39;s home.  The sink had a missing knob over the cold tap so that only the hot water worked.  The sink used to be white, but because of how dirty and permanently stained it was, it took on a beige color.  Inside the sink a couple of black rings made a circle around the drain.  The plumbing underneath the sink leaked and so did underneath the hot water knob that was missing the &quot;H&quot; cap revealing the rusty screw beneath.  One cockroach had made it&#39;s way to a used adult diaper laying on the floor in the hopes of finding a tasty meal.  Another cockroach was in fear of its life and ran as fast as possible to escape the rat that was chasing it.  The rat quickly caught up to it, bit it, and ate it right before it pissed and shit on the floor.  There were two stalls.  One was closed, but the top hinge of the door was torn off making the door hang diagonally from the bottom hinge.  Graffiti of a penis spurting cum was painted on it.  The other stall didn&#39;t have a door or a toilet.  Only a black well used dildo with a suction cup so that it could be stuck somewhere leaned against the wall where the pipe should have been.  On the stall, all manner of crude humor and phone numbers were etched, penciled, or inked into it.  One message read,&quot; For a good time, dial 555-4848&quot; while another one said, &quot;Here I sit in stinky vapor waiting for some toilet paper.&quot;  Below the second message only four holes and a dark spot remained of the toilet paper holder. Above the sink, half of a mirror remained on the wall, the other half having fallen off years ago.  On the sink rested a used heroin needle that an addict left behind.  Under the sink in the pool of water that was leaking from the pipe was a used condom and its wrapper.  Madame Illusia magicked away all of David&#39;s clothing revealing the boner he was trying to hide.  The crowd died laughing.  &quot;We Can&#39;t have your excitement visible now can we, David?&quot;, said Madame Illusia.  The dildo had given Madame an idea.  Madame made the drain go away.  The dildo in the bathroom turned upright and stuck itself to the floor where the drain should have been.  She then turned to David, touched the tip of his penis and watched it as his dick and balls sucked into his body forming a vagina and ovaries in it&#39;s place.  David was still horny, though and absentmindedly started rubbing his clit.  Knowing what was taking place, Madame transported the naked David into the dirty bathroom.  On the other side of the cloud, David saw his own cloud.  In the cloud he could see Madame&#39;s stage.  He tried to go through the cloud to return to the stage, but couldn&#39;t.  It didn&#39;t matter because he was still horny and needed relief.  He saw the dildo standing upright on the floor and went over to squat above it.  He was about to do the unthinkable.  He slowly lowered himself onto the dildo as the dildo slipped into his moist pussy.  He kept sliding up and down on it until he was completely seated on the floor.  He tried to get up, but couldn&#39;t.  He was stuck.  He could still feel the dildo slide up and down deeper and deeper as it expanded as morphed into a rusty pipe.  To David it felt soooo good.  David started to stink.  He smelled like sewage.  His smell mixed with the strong smell of dried shit and stale urine giving him  a pleasant aroma.  He developed a deep dirty crust of dirt covering his body.  A cockroach had decided to chill out on one of David&#39;s toes and crawled up onto it.  It made David tickle  David&#39;s skin started to harden into porcelain.  His ass grew a place where he was bolted to the floor.  One bolt was missing where that part of his body was chipped off.  The pipe in his pussy still continued to give him pleasure.  His mouth elongated forming the bowl of the toilet as his torso arms and legs melted together to form the base.  At that time, the cockroach had decided it was a good time to move on and jumped off David&#39;s toe and scurry away so that he wouldn&#39;t be turned into a miniature piece of a toilet.   The rest of David&#39;s face took on a square look as one of his eyes disappeared while the other turned into a lever to flush the toilet.  Only this lever wasn&#39;t connected to anything.  The metal rod connecting it inside David&#39;s &quot;scull&quot; had rotted away years ago.  David could feel the hat on his head/tank.  The tank cover had been broken in half years ago and so only half remained so that anyone trying to use David would look inside the empty tank and see the failed rod.  His transformation was effectively complete.  However, David started to feel queezy.  A couple of bubbles came up from his pussy and gassed out.  Afterwards, he puked sewage into his mouth and a lot of it spilled over the rim of the bowl and spilled onto the floor.  One thing absent from David was a seat leaving only the rim of his mouth/bowl to sit on.  The pipe in his pussy continued to pleasure him.  He eventually came.  When he was finished, the only thoughts he had left were the thoughts of a toilet.  He wondered if anyone was going to come into the bathroom and leave a big tasty turd for him to savor.  See how disgusting the bathroom was, he highly doubted it.  But, when people are desperate for a toilet, they&#39;ll do anything.  Or at least he hoped.  The cloud disappeared while a lone fatberg in the sewers below was causing a back-up forcing David to vomit sewage.  Despite the fact that David was spent, the pipe in his pussy still was trying to give him pleasure.</p>
