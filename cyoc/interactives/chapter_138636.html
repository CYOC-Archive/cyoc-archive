<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been a great day for Kellie and her friends. After the transformation of Kevin, Kellie and the others had enjoyed a relatively quiet day. Class, while boring, went off without a hitch and Katie, Lisa, and Samantha’s volleyball practice was also drama free. There had been a moment when Mary Elise was tempted to use her ring to change one of the senior volleyball players into dog but Kellie and Claudia were able to convince her to stop. As Kellie now drove for home with Lisa and Katie, she was all smiles.<br />
<br />
“You know things have been going really well lately,” she smiled, glancing at her passengers.<br />
<br />
“Yeah things have been quiet lately it’s nice,” Lisa added. “Still, we should try to have some fun later on. Have all the girls over for a sleepover or something.”<br />
<br />
“I think that sounds like a fun idea,” Katie smirked. “It’s been forever since we all got together for a night.”<br />
<br />
As the trio pulled onto their street they continued talking, making plans for what would hopefully be a fun filled weekend. As Kellie drove by her home, on her way towards Katie and Lisas, she paused. “Did you two see someone on my front porch,” she asked. Katie and Lisa quickly spun in their seats as they gazed back Kellies. Shockingly they noticed what appeared to be two teenage girls sitting on the porch, waiting for someone. “Yeah someone is there,” Katie answered cautiously. “Kel are you expecting anyone?”<br />
<br />
“No,” she said tersely. Lisa and Katie looked nervously at one another as Kellie began to turn the car around. As she slowly pulled into the driveway she narrowed her eyes, trying to place the faces of the two teens waiting for her. “Listen,” she said quietly. “We need to be ready in case this goes sideways. Katie, you should come with me. Lisa, you should probably wait in the car.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not waiting in the car Kellie,” Lisa exclaimed. “I’m more than capable of taking care of myself, even if these two are magical. No buts I’m going.”<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed as she looked between Katie and Lisa. The auburn haired teens stubbornness would eventually win out if she tried to argue. “Okay,” she sighed. “Just...be careful okay? I don’t know who these two are. Last thing I want is for you to get hurt.” Lisa smiled, patting Kellie on the shoulder. “I appreciate that, now let’s find out who the hell these two are.”<br />
<br />
Lynne and Gloria had watched the car turn around and slowly begin creeping back to the house. Thankfully Lynne knew exactly where Kellie lived. Even in her future she had stayed in this house, Merlin having given her the deed when she graduated from high school. “You feeling okay Gloria,” she asked as she looked at her sister.<br />
<br />
“I’m okay,” Gloria replied wearily. “I took my meds before you cast the spell to get us here. Hopefully I shouldn’t have any seizures. I’m just a bit tired and have a headache.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah crossing into other timelines will do that,” Lynne replied. “Just try to relax though okay? Don’t want you having anymore seizures, especially if we’re here. I’m not sure if I can get you the help you need if something happens.”<br />
<br />
Gloria nodded as she wearily watched the three teens exit the car. For her it was a surreal experience. She immediately recognized the three teens as Katie, Kellie and her own stepmom Lisa. Seeing them so young though, without any magic being used first, was somewhat off putting. It made it sink in that although things looked similar, she was in another world.<br />
<br />
“Hi,” Lynne waved as the teens cautiously approached. “I was wondering when you three would get home.”<br />
<br />
Kellie and the others paused as they curiously gazed at the girl. Obviously she seemed to know them yet Kellie had never payed eyes on them. “Umm right,” Kellie murmured. “So who exactly are you two and why are you on my front porch?”<br />
<br />
“Sorry where are my manners,” Lynne apologized. “My name is Lynne Turner and this is my sister Gloria. We came to talk with you Kellie. Guess we can talk with Katie and Lisa also, which is pretty cool.”<br />
<br />
Confusion seemed to fix itself upon Katie, Kellie and Lisa’s faces as they looked the two teens over. “Okay hold on,” Lisa quipped. “That can’t be Gloria Turner. Gloria is only 10 years old and she doesn’t have a sister named Lynne. I should know, I’ve been dating Jason for 4 months and have known him for years.”<br />
<br />
“We’re not from around here,” Gloria said weakly as she attempted to stand. “We...Umm...we kind of came from the other timeline. You know...the one Kellie originally came from.”<br />
<br />
The three teens eyes went wide as they looked at the two girls. Kellie quickly approached the two, a look of anger and concern spreading across her face. “Wait your Gloria,” Kellie said quickly. “Katie’s sister Gloria. What the hell are you doing here? Is everything okay with Katie? She’s not hurt is she?”<br />
<br />
“No Katie is fine,” Lynne said, trying to calm her aunt down.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Katie said. “If the other Katie is fine then what are you doing here?”<br />
<br />
“Also,” Kellie added. “Who are you Lynne? Katie never mentioned anything about another sister the last time she was here. I need answers because right now things seem a bit fishy.”<br />
<br />
Lynne paused as she gazed at her aunt and her friends. Once again she found herself having to introduce herself to people she had known her whole life. “I am so never useing a time travel spell again,” she thought. Taking a deep breath she now tried to ready herself.<br />
<br />
“Okay Kellie here’s the thing,” she started. “You see, Katie was sort of right. Right now she doesn’t have a sister. She will though shortly, and I’m her.”<br />
<br />
Kellie now tried to turn this over in her head. “Wait, are you telling me that your Lisa’s unborn daughter?”<br />
<br />
Lynne nodded, as Lisa let out an audible gasp. “Wait Lisa’s pregnant. The other me is having a baby?!?!?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Kellie replied sheepishly. “Ummm the last time the other Katie and Kellie were here they kind of let it slip that the other You is having a kid.”<br />
<br />
Lisa’s jaw dropped as she looked between her sister and Kellie. “Why didn’t you two tell me this,” she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“It kind of slipped my mind,” Kellie and Katie replied, slightly embarrassed they had forgotten. Lisa glared at the two angrily, huffing in disgust. “You know my other self getting knocked up is kind of a big deal. You two should of said something.”<br />
<br />
“Look I’m sorry Okay,” Katie groaned. “I’ll make it up to you later. Right now we need to find out what these two are doing here?”<br />
<br />
“And how they got here,” Kellie added. “Especially If What your saying is true. How did you travel back in time and how did you cross over into this timeline?”<br />
<br />
“Well you did teach me those spells,” Lynne answered. “Now I was hoping we could sit down and talk. My sister and I kind of need to get to know you, and we also need to talk with you about something. It concerns yu meeting up with Lisa very soon and how your going to do it. But first, can we go inside? Gloria really needs some rest.”<br />
<br />
Kellie could only stare in stunned silence, her day had gone from quiet to chaos so quickly it was making her head spin. A future niece now stood on her front steps, with a girl she had only heard her daughter talk about in passing. “So much for a quiet afternoon,” she thought as she now considered her next action.</p>
