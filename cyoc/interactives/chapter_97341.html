<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Laborer 917998-111-791154 knew she was going to have to rent a place eventually, and that meant getting a job. She could mooch off her family if need be, but that wouldn&#39;t set the best example for her baby sister Laborer 917998-111-791155. And she didn&#39;t want Laborer 917998-111-791155 growing up with just the Embassy as her home. <br />
<br />
She had general knowledge about humanity, but she no longer remember her name or any other details or faces of her life before her rebirth. All that was left was a message from human herself to Gynoid herself saying, &#39;You don&#39;t want to remember, trust me.&#39; 9901 had shuddered and told her she was right. <br />
<br />
Richard Jones had already sent in the paper work for Laborer 917998-111-791154&#39;s new ID. Laborer 917998-111-791154 worried that dumping her old memories might cause some legal trouble, but Richard assured her that in THIS COUNTRY, that getting an ID and driver license was a lot easier than most thought. In a country that wanted to turn a blind eye to its unemployment problems, and still hungry for cheap labor, far too many large cracks had been left open. <br />
<br />
Though personally, 9901 welcomed to the company, she could communicate with any of her sisters anywhere if she wanted, but it made the embassy feel less empty. <br />
<br />
&quot;9901,&quot; Laborer 917998-111-791154 asked, &quot;I was wonder... Laborer 917998-111-791155... I could ask any of our family but I wanted ask you personally... are we going to... speed up her growth so she&#39;s an adult or child?&quot;<br />
<br />
9901 laughed. &quot;Why should we rush her through it? Maturity is something that has to be grown. There are some things that should be EXPERIENCED, not just programmed in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laborer 917998-111-791154 looked relieved. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, trust me, I prefer going around in a child form myself, but I can&#39;t be taken seriously like that.&quot; <br />
<br />
On the right side, at least with 800 and the rest of her human family, the ice seemed to have been broken, and people were accepting a little more, at least on the personal level, that the Gynoids weren&#39;t out to create mindless personality less zombies. <br />
<br />
And meanwhile she got a visitor she thought she&#39;d have gotten very earlier once she arrived one Earth, and in much greater numbers. She asked 154 and 155 to note bother them, since this was 9901&#39;s job after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you give me back these?&quot; The old man pointed at the stumps of his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we can Mr....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Captain. Captain Nathaniels, you kind have soldiers?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not strictly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have an explicit soldier caste?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Laborers can double as security and soldiers if need be and a few other castes, but it&#39;s explicitly voted to NEVER be a primary function. Ever. The sisterhood voted that it was immoral and cruel to have sisters whose entire function was violence or dealing with violence, and who would be left to gather dust with no enemies to fight or dangers to protect others from. Otherwise, it could give people the wrong idea, we REALLY prefer not to use violence.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Captain Nathaniels thought for a few minutes, and asked, &quot;One question first, what would you do if there was an atomic war and people were irradiated outside your embassy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Offer to convert them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if they refused?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Try my hardest to save them, and ask my medical sisters if I could.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beep: because you can&#39;t convert the dead, but seriously because I&#39;m not an ice-hearted beotch. When I look at humans, I see future sisters, I don&#39;t see raw material to process. It isn&#39;t much of a choice if we brute force them into it. The only time it&#39;s EVER happened was someone terminally ill and not able to give an answer and a loved one is able to consent, and even THAT is rare given how horribly it can backfire if it turns out the sister would have rather moved on than be converted. Or they left instructions about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t happen to have a history of your people handy would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually we do.&quot; From a shelf, 9901 gave the captain an ipad. <br />
<br />
&quot;You have that on hand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are trying to spread knowledge about ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I see.&quot; The elderly veteran said. The old man spent the next five hours reading. He commented. &quot;You don&#39;t shy away from mentioning your mistakes here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We feel that more we hide, the more that can be uncovered, if we&#39;re open about it, then it can&#39;t be said we tried to cover up anything. Nothing angers a people than finding out they were deceived. My older Emissaries sisters taught me that. So if we don&#39;t lie or hide anything, that can&#39;t happen.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot; . . . I think you girls are gonna NEED ME!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I get you the paper work?&quot; 9901 asked excited. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go right ahead, but can ya get a phone first? I&#39;ll be telling somebody what I&#39;ve really thought of their old folks home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unlike others, Captain Daniel took his green jacket, and other personal items, not wanting them destroyed by the nanites when he charged. He did ironically ask if the wheel chair could be stuffed in with him. &quot;That&#39;s one thing I won&#39;t mind seeing bye bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
154 and 9901 both helped him into the &#39;rebirthing nest&#39; or &#39;beanbag&#39; as humans had taken to calling it jovially. <br />
<br />
Captain Nathanals and his wheel chair sank into the beanbag... and Laborer 917998-111-791156 practically LEAPT out, and did several kart wheels followed by some summersaults. Her magenta circuit lines glowing as she tested out her legs and every inch of her body. <br />
<br />
9901 and 154 gave her a hug. 155 squealed feeling her new sister&#39;s presence. 156 hugged back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, these are some nice legs.&quot; 156 laughed testing them out again jumping so high she touched the ceiling before landing perfectly. <br />
<br />
The new gynoid stretched and said casually, &quot;Ya do realize darlin&#39; that there&#39;s no way the Uncle Sam&#39;s army ISN&#39;T preparing WEAPONS to &#39;deal with&#39; us. We&#39;re just lucky the rest of the world sees us as America&#39;s &#39;problem&#39; and are ignoring us. Maybe some cosmic rust, or some malicious coding they&#39;re hoping can cross the programming language barrier that can wirelessly transmit into our brains.&quot; <br />
<br />
9901 said. &quot;Oh they&#39;d be INSANE not to take such precautions. We have come here with the open intention of ending an era for their entire civilization. It would be unusual for ANY civilization whose had to deal with conquerers and invaders among even their own NOT to take such precautions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just it darlin&#39;, it ain&#39;t just a &#39;precaution&#39;, once they decide we&#39;ve gotten too big for our breeches: they&#39;ll throw at us everythin&#39; they&#39;ve figured out &#39;bout us from stuff we&#39;ve givin&#39; em without reservation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s their choice to make too. My entire JOB, my FUNCTION, my PURPOSE, is to make sure it doesn&#39;t happen, and they all eventually chose to do it all peacefully, without being forced to. Half my entire job is to make our future sisters don&#39;t panic and drop an atomic bomb on us. This is a transition for their culture, not an extermination of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just sayin&#39; darlin&#39;, everyone remembers what happened to the Africans when the Europeans showed up.&quot; <br />
<br />
154 hugged her baby sister. Hoping her future sisters would let her live her new life in peace. <br />
<br />
00<br />
<br />
156 had left to get her property from her rest home. Ironically, she said she chosen to archive SOME of her memories, but not all. She said they were things she knew she had wanted very clearly to forget. 9901 understood what that meant. &quot;But that doesn&#39;t mean there are buddies who died for me, or who I lost my legs for, that I want to forget, I&#39;m more than happy to remember them.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
The next convert who came that way... 9901 knew THIS ONE was coming . . . <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, can you make me a metal vixen?&quot; Said a young overweight man holding a poster of a furry Vulpes sex symbol.  <br />
<br />
9901 sighed, &#39;I knew this was coming.&#39; She thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... we can fully customize our bodies... we can&#39;t do male forms, we are a SISTERhood after all... but ... if you wish to use that form... none of your new sisters will object.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot; He took a step forward.<br />
<br />
9901 held up a hand. &quot;BUT! I want you please know one thing. While we are offering this to all, and it IS free of charge, we . . . are not a lax society, we find happiness by doing... not just experiencing... though... depending on what caste you wish to become in your soul...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My soul is that of a vixen!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... and I won&#39;t argue that... Mr...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Flame Star.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s your legal name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... well, if you&#39;ll come inside and fill out the paper work... Uh, you ARE legally able to consent to a medical procedure right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flame Star was not happy about having to fill out all the paper work needed for conversion. And he grew even more impatient when 9901 had Richard triple check the paper work just in case. <br />
<br />
A few hours later, Flame Star took off all his clothes... leaving him as naked as the Gynoids around him. 154 considered covering 155&#39;s eyes, but it didn&#39;t feel that important anymore. <br />
<br />
Flame Star practically pranced into the beanbag. <br />
<br />
9901 startled a bit when Flame Star&#39;s volume shrank even more than she expected. His silver covered lost the extra mass it had, figure becoming slimmer and smoother... also, a large shape like a fox&#39;s tail emerged from his rear, along with triangles like fox ears and a long face like a fox&#39;s muzzle. His feet were dainty, but also digigrated, his hands looking to be a bit more like silver metal paws than hands. Well, this was the new form her sister wished to take for her new life. As she felt her new sister&#39;s mind join her in the Sisterhood, she was even more surprised at the twists her form was taking. <br />
<br />
What stepped out, was a silver humanoid vixen... but her circuit lines glowed white, unlike any other Gynoid yet born on earth. Also, she was flat chested, and her size was that of someone on the wrong side of puberty. There was also some sublime hints of closed connection ports down her back. <br />
<br />
The little white-lined robot fox girl folded her hands on front of her and made a formal bow. &quot;Archivist, 000311-200-312000 online. Awaiting planetary data input,&quot; she said formally and property like a polite young lady. <br />
<br />
The little robot vixen moved with a serenity and grace that belied her small stature. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the family Archivist, 000311-200-312000,&quot; Laborer 917998-111-791154 knelt down and gave her a hug. The vixen hugged back. <br />
<br />
The little vixen looked down at herself and up at her family. <br />
<br />
She was literally a walking relay for her family on earth now, and a living archive. <br />
<br />
Everything before felt... so small. Her former self&#39;s obsessive escape from reality... he wanted to experience every story, anime, manga, and movie and comic and video game in existence... well, now Archivist, 000311-200-312000 or 2000 or &#39;Triple Zero&#39;, grew on that desire... every history book, every work of art, every landscape both painted and real. She felt it, she NEEDED to archive it all, to insure when this planet&#39;s sun burned out as a red giant and this planet became a frozen wasteland, that everything it had been and archive would be preserved in memory. <br />
<br />
Despite her small size, she now had enough memory capacity she had enough empty space in her head for everything humans had every put to paper, stone, papyrus, or computer several times over. The price for this was that she didn&#39;t have as much super human physical abilities as the rest of her family. But she understood this too. What was the proper term human for this? Maybe zen. <br />
<br />
&lt;Sister, can you please clean one of the rooms in the Embassy for me? And... I might need a ride to tell my parents they can throw out or donate to charity the majority of my material possessions.&gt; <br />
<br />
9901&#39;s only hope was that this didn&#39;t blow up in her face in some spectacular way. <br />
<br />
&lt;We&#39;ll contact 9902, I&#39;m certain she can smooth things over between you and your parents.&gt; <br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
While 2000 and 9902 visited the first &#39;anthro&#39; gynoid&#39;s parents... 9901 thought it best she could do with a recharge cycle after the turn of events. <br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Caroline Roads?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve... I&#39;ve talked it over with my family and friends and... I decided... I... I want to spread the good news among your entire species. They say it would help get more souls on the right path who haven&#39;t heard the truth. You say you&#39;re all connected, and can all speak to each other at once?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More or less, we do have the ability to close ourselves off... but as a matter of principle, we only do so as a matter of grave importance, though the artisan caste does more so than others, if one if their works sends too big a ripple through the family than they thought. Though as a law, we never CENSOR their work.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What job... would I ... be given, if I... become on of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that generally depends on both your own desires and the needs of the sisterhood... but I would say we&#39;re in need of a Spiritualist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a religious caste?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone is surprised when they hear that. Yes we do. My grandmother on my father&#39;s side is one. Every spiritualist sister is free to try and convert either their fellow spiritualists or their sisters to their spiritual point of view. The only real law is no one can be forced or threatened into conversion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about faiths ... who declare &#39;all who are not of this faith, or are of that faith, are the enemy and must die?&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The level of empathy that comes from conversion into a Sister usually makes that part of the dogma psychologically impossible. The simple fact is? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s POSSIBLE for us to emotionally distance ourselves from ANY other sapient being to the point where we could commit murder even in the name of a higher cause.&quot; <br />
 <br />
&quot;I see... I won&#39;t have to give up my ties to my religion will I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely, positively not! We already have a diverse group here on Earth... And we will not ask you to give up any tenants of your faith.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So... I&#39;ll be able to spread the word across your billions of sisters?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trillions of sisters, and yes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You... you don&#39;t put a TAX on religions do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we don&#39;t.&quot; <br />
<br />
People who insisted religions be taxed, had always confused 9901, if a church couldn&#39;t pay their taxes, how was the IRS supposed to RUN a church until it was able to pay off its debts? Have the IRS agents give sermons? How would they even TAX for saving souls? <br />
<br />
&quot;Well... if you&#39;ll come in and sign the paper work...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve already filled it in... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Caroline, you do realize there&#39;s no undo button right?&quot; 9901 asked carefully. The last thing she EVER wanted was a sister who was upset that they didn&#39;t understand what they were getting into. <br />
<br />
&quot;... I know exactly... I&#39;m doing this for my faith of my own free will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Alright, come inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caroline asked 9901 to turn around as she stripped down, she liked what she was wearing and didn&#39;t want to see it destroyed, even if she&#39;d have no sense of modesty or not. <br />
<br />
Caroline stepped in, praying in her mind the whole time . . . When he emerged, she was no longer human. But that didn&#39;t matter as much as she thought it would. <br />
<br />
Spiritualist 320977-397-950399 knew the first thing she would say to her trillions of sisters. <br />
<br />
&lt;My sisters... have you heard the good news?&gt;</p>
