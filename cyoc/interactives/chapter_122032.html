<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Officer Ryan Conner was quiet as he lead the three officers that were part of his team to arrest Dymixious Drake on the charges of what he&#39;d committed in the murder of Lionel Ulysses. He knew he had three others on the other side of the house, in case Dymixious tried to flee, but from what he&#39;d observed when he had his shifts in observing the &quot;safe house&quot; that Moon Lake had allowed him to stay in gave him the opinion that he would be more likely to fight. As he&#39;d said to the others, he felt the man who should be laying low seemed to carry some air of self importance, and that was only to cause trouble. The FBI and the Seattle PD wanted to arrest him, and that was well known in law enforcement circles, simply from the press releases that identified Dymixious as a subject. <br />
<br />
And while they might theoretically manage to hid him from the FBI, as they only had a contact number and not proof of Dymixious&#39;s presence in Moon Lake. This could mean the Mayor or Chief O&#39;Hara could decide not to fully cooperate and demand a Federal Warrant be taken if they were going to search Moon Lake for no reason other than a contact number. However, hiding him carried its own risks in that someone else could report his presence or the worst case scenario that Moon Lake comes under scrutiny for obstruction and the FBI would get its warrant. If that happened, not only would there be a potential battle with Dymixious, anyway, which could reveal the were-secret, but Moon Lake&#39;s present government would face being brought down on obstruction of justice charges. Arresting Dymixious might lead to a battle, but it would at least be one that could be contained and the secret wouldn&#39;t be exposed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Best case he doesn&#39;t fight,&quot; Ryan Connor thought to himself, &quot;but... that&#39;d be doubtful.&quot;<br />
<br />
But all he could do was wait, which he and his team did rather quietly. Eventually the door opened to reveal a tall and well muscled man, even for a were. His scent had some hidden hints of his reptilian nature, betraying him as a werekomododragon. In this it was Dymixious Drake, and he clearly looked irritated to have three police officers at &quot;his&quot; door, judging by his narrowed eyes and heavy frown at Ryan Connor, Samson Carter, and the third officer that was with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what unneeded demands have you brought to me now?&quot; Dymixious growled, &quot;I was trying to give my wife breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dymixious Drake, I have been ordered to inform you that you are under arrest for the murder of Lionel Ulysses, as per the desires of the FBI,&quot; Ryan Carter spoke, &quot;and they do have a warrant out for your arrest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT!? YOU CAN&#39;T ARREST ME!&quot; Dymixious erupted in raw anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the authority of the Moon Lake Police Department, yes we can,&quot; Ryan Connor answered, &quot;Please come quietly.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was no coming quietly as Dymixious moved quickly, grabbing Ryan Connor by the front of his bulletproof vest and lifting him up into the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;I work hard to protect our secret and you come here demanding to arrest me?!&quot; Dymixious snarled and began to transform.<br />
<br />
His eyes changed from a brownish color to an almost flame colored eye, with a red/orange, and yellow mix surrounded his round pupils. Ryan Connor began to kick as he felt heavy claws extend from Dymixious&#39;s hands and black beaded scales began to cover his face and body. His muscles also swelled up tremendously and stretched his shirt and pants heavily, and as he continued to transform, the seams soon began to rip and tear at the seems. And as his swelling muscles ripped his clothes apart, he revealed more beaded black scales.<br />
<br />
&quot;I protect you and you repay me with thisssssss?&quot; Dymixious hissed as his tongue lengthened narrowed and forked, matching the actual tongue the Komodo Dragon had in nature.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you obeyed the law, you wouldn&#39;t have this problem,&quot; Samson Carter spoke up and began to reach for his side arm. In theory all the officers for the team were weres, but if it came to something where Dymixious forced them to take lethal measures to protect themselves, leaving Dymixious&#39;s body looking as though he&#39;d been mauled by an animal wouldn&#39;t work good, &quot;Put him down and come quietly. For if you fight... you risk exposing us as well...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dymixious&#39;s response was simply throw Ryan Connor at the three officers knocking all three down as his clothes ripped free, to reveal a thick and long tail grew out and thrashed behind him, slamming against the door as it grew out and made a loud banging noise. Dymixious also unleashed great roar as his face pushed forward into a squared muzzle complete with needle-like teeth and venom glands on the lower jaw. His feet remained plantigrade, but his toes had lengthened to where they were tipped by sharpened claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dymixious... please... stop... don&#39;t!&quot; Dymixious vaguely heard his wife plead, &quot;they&#39;re fellow weres. There must be a misunderstanding!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh there&#39;ssssssssss a misssssssssssssssunderssssssssssssstanding,&quot; Dymixious hissed, &quot;they missssssssssssssssssunderssssssssssssssstand that I should be honored and protected for my effortsssssssssssssssssss to protect weres everywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that he rushed at the three officers. He lunged at Ryan Connor and slashed at his neck with his claws. Ryan Connor managed to dodge backward, but Dymixious still caught him across the chest and sliced through his bulletproof vest, easily tearing through the material with his claws. Thankfully it was think enough that they couldn&#39;t reach his chest. As Ryan Connor dodged, Dymixious continued on, hoping to get a grip on one of the three officers. Samson Carter literally dove away for the ground to a side, hoping to get out of the way. Dymixious responded with a heavy swing of his tail that caught Samson Carter while he was still in the air. The blow had enough force that a sickening crack was heard by Ryan Conner and the third officer, who couldn&#39;t get out of the way. Dymixious grabbed him by the shoulders and tried to hold his arms down, though managed to get one in front of his face. Dymixious merely took that as an invitation and bit him, hard and pulled his head away sharply, tearing some of the officer&#39;s shirt and leaving a very bloody wound that was literally pouring out of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I sssssssssssshould NOT be hunted or rounded up like ssssssssssssome common thug,&quot; Dymixious hissed in were form and turned to Ryan Connor returning to his feet and three more officers appearing. One was on the side of the house between the safe house and the Twist&#39;s home, his gun drawn, another was on the other side of the house, and the last had literally come through it and was trying to move his wife away from the doorway and the scene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your behavior here has more in common with a thug than not,&quot; Ryan Connor as he looked to see Samson Carter laying on his back, likely with cracked, if not broken, ribs, and the third officer on the ground clutching at his bitten forearm and trying to clot the blood, which had already stained the sleeve of his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Dymixious roared, though no one could know for sure if it was to rebuke Ryan Connor or defend his wife, and lunged forward.<br />
<br />
However, by this time he wasn&#39;t close enough to overwhelm their reaction time. Ryan Connor and the two officers that were along the sides of the house opened fire. Ryan&#39;s shot struck Dymixious in the chest and spun him around on one foot as a result of the impact. The second shot hit Dymixious in the shoulder from the side while the third shot hit him in the other shoulder from a perpendicular angle and only produced more blood with the result of the impact of each bullet. With that, Dymixious fell and lay still. For the moment he was still breathing, but was quite still.<br />
<br />
Ryan Connor quickly holstered his weapon activated his walkie-talkie to access into the car&#39;s radio frequency, &quot;This is Officer Connor, subject Dymixious DID fight. Officer Carter might have cracked or broken ribs and Officer Tibbs was bitten. Send a bus...&quot;<br />
<br />
He was about to add in that Dymixious had also been wounded, but the werekomododragon now lay still in a pool of his own blood, staining the sidewalk and the grass around it. This quickly brought in an additional report.<br />
<br />
&quot;The situation is under control, but shots were fired,&quot; Ryan Connor continued his report, &quot;emergency medical care.&quot;</p>
