<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The training rooms that they had me in Eira in varied and Captain Lartara had made sure to rotate us through the various rooms as needed, which made sense for our training to be &quot;proper&quot; Lycothan Warriors. There was a gym with padded walls and floors where both of us were to go through training at combat strategies, which often amounted to wrestling, though there was often elements to the instruction that was designed to restrain and prevent a target from being able to get a shot at making it a contest, differing what Eira and I would be expected to do as our careers as warriors advanced. Given my memories of being Haley, I wasn&#39;t looking forward to that, but I knew that as Harkaal I would have to learn.<br />
<br />
Thankfully though, today&#39;s training was more mental which had us in the same sort of &quot;classroom&quot; where Lartara had started my training regarding the rules I&#39;d need to follow as a Warrior Lycothan in general and as a guard in the facility specifically. This was something I didn&#39;t mind too much, as it really let me learn more about Lycothan society and regimentation. It let me compare what I was to what I had become and on some level that was interesting, though, much of my mind was more focused on trying to protect Amanda and Casey and knowing more about Lycothans beyond what &quot;they&quot; had shared with us while we were prisoners was important. As, with my crest and its silver streak hanging over an eye, and the loin cloth hanging from hips and tank top stretched over my impressive female Lycothan breasts, I knew that all of the humans still in the facility would see me now as one of &quot;them&quot; and just Lartara had, I&#39;d need to find some sense of balance so as to protect both myself and to protect them from Alphas like Jinara.<br />
<br />
&quot;I apologize for being late, Captain,&quot; I spoke as entered into classroom and moved to sit down next to Eira with my focus on Captain Lartara, who was standing near a pair of screens that held the same display screens that I had seen on the iPad-like devices that Eira and I were given in these sessions to study in these training sessions that wasn&#39;t physical, &quot;but Alpha Nillara requested I provide additional security for her while she spoke with prisoner...&quot; I found myself pausing as I moved to remember the number that the Lycothans had given Amanda. It was one of the things I didn&#39;t like and I didn&#39;t know how Lartara or Nillara had seemed to so easily go by the numbers Lycothans gave prisoners. I privately guessed that they had been Lycothans longer than I had and had gotten used to it by now. Eira looked to me, but it was likely that she figured I hadn&#39;t memorized the prisoner numbers yet, as Eira didn&#39;t remember being Emily and thus accepting giving humans numbers rather than names rather easily. &quot;...995403.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Marrh did report that to me,&quot; Lartara answered, &quot;Hopefully with no complex games being afoot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But wouldn&#39;t she want Prisoner 995403 to accept the gift as we all do?&quot; Eira wondered as she looked between me and Lartara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but Alpha Nillara is still an Alpha,&quot; Lartara answered, &quot;and thus her reasoning for decisions will be different our reasoning if put in the same situation...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thus why we are Warriors?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Precisely,&quot; Lartara answered, &quot;Our caste structure will mean that there are different motives and actions based on our castes. We as warriors are strongest and the most skilled at military matters and our ranks reflect military ranks. Alphas as political leaders are more skilled in politics and the ambitions that often go along with it. Their specific ranks reflect their more bureaucratic nature. The Servants have the broadest spectrum of actions and responsibilities, but they are all aimed to support the Alphas and Warriors. And their ranks often reflect that purpose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Servants have ranks?&quot; Eira asked with surprise as I moved to sit down beside her, &quot;but they&#39;re all our servants.... wouldn&#39;t that all be one rank?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They all serve a singular purpose,&quot; Lartara answered, &quot;but Lycothan society is heavily stratified on all levels and within all castes. It provides us with a sense of order to keep chaos at bay.&quot;<br />
<br />
I picked up the iPad that was set for my training as Lartara began to go through showing the levels within Lycothan Society, which appeared to be today&#39;s training. The screen flashed from being divided into three images of a wolf&#39;s head. The first with the word &quot;Alpha&quot; in Ancient Lycothan under it. I didn&#39;t know how I could read it, as all the Lycothans I&#39;d seen even when I was still human had only spoken English. Perhaps there was something instinctive that I&#39;d gained when Lartara turned me. The wolf&#39;s head above it was golden in color with a great halo around its perked ears and with light radiating from behind it. The wolf had its mouth closed. The second had the word &quot;Warrior&quot; under it. That icon was a silver wolf&#39;s head with its ears perked and with its mouth open and sharp teeth clearly visible. The last said, &quot;Servant&quot; and its icon was again a silver wolf&#39;s head, but with its mouth closed and its ears lowered submissively. Lartara clicked on that third head.<br />
<br />
When she did so, it then brought pyramid that demonstrated the ranks within the Servant caste. The lowest level was the largest and was labeled &quot;laborers.&quot; I read in it that these Servants were responsible for doing much of the manual labor in Lycothan society. They moved the rubble and put the buildings and vehicles together. All the most labor intensive jobs were performed by this rank within the Servant cast. The next level up was slightly smaller and was labeled &quot;cleaners and feeders.&quot; It included janitors, groomers, maids, cooks, chiefs, waiters,  and other related jobs. The next level up was &quot;educators&quot; and included all the teachers in Lycothan society. I figured their primary role was to educate the Servants that engaged in more educational tasks, such as writing histories and engaging in arts and sciences and so on. The next level up was &quot;noters,&quot; which included secretaries and communications experts, which included news reporters and so on. The next level up was &quot;engineers,&quot; which included all the Servants who were inventing technology and so on. The next level up was &quot;artisans,&quot; which included the historians, scientists, artists, and other related tasks.<br />
<br />
&quot;These are all the ranks within the Servant&#39;s caste,&quot; Lartara explained, &quot;to a great degree, they are free to move through each rank, but there are administrators that will provide some degree of censorship, usually making sure that the Servant in question is suited to the job they move to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Eira commented.<br />
<br />
Lartara then moved the screens again, backing out of the display on Lycothan Servant&#39;s ranks and moving over to the Alphas. Again the iPad put forward a pyramid-like display. At the top there was a very small level, which read: &quot;Alpha of Alphas,&quot; which I assumed was something close to a Queen or chief political executive. The political ruler of the Lycothans. Below that was a slightly larger level which was labeled: &quot;Lycothan Bureaucracy of of Political Advisers,&quot; which I figured was like the Alpha of Alpha&#39;s cabinet. The next level down was labeled: &quot;Lycothan Imperial Senators,&quot; below them came &quot;Colony Governesses.&quot; I blinked at that, but then remembered that Lycothans were a largely matriarchal society and figured that top executive roles  for certain posts, like Alpha of Alphas or colony governors were probably only open to females, and thus &quot;Governesses.&quot; Below them were labeled as: &quot;Colony Bureaucracy of Political Advisers.&quot; That process then repeated as it went down the levels of Lycothan government from the very top covering all of the Lycothans to then the most lower levels for governing either the cities or monitoring the Warrior and Servant castes.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... where do Alphas Jinara and Nillara fit?&quot; Eira asked as Lartara finished explaining the Alpha&#39;s ranks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alpha Jinara is a facility administrator,&quot; Lartara answered, &quot;and since this facility is a standalone facility, she will outrank city mayors and even a couple planet-side county managers, but she is below Colony Bureaucracy of Political advisers that would determine her role. Alpha Nillara and her mate in terms of general rank are at the same level as Alpha Jinara, but within their roles here, they only in charge of their specific wings. Nillara in charge of maintaining the female wing, which we guard, and her mate is in charge of the male wing which Rager is charge of guarding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rager?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A male Warrior Captain, the same rank as me,&quot; Lartara answered, &quot;but not worthy of either of you. TRUST me on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Captain,&quot; Eira and I both answered with a salute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, we will move on to our own caste&#39;s ranks, which you and Eira are both going to learn by heart and go through,&quot; Lartara continued, &quot;Depending on how well you serve, you could be promoted to the top of our military and lead all the Warriors in battle... you may remain at low levels and go where battle will take you, or you may settle into a mid level officer rank and serve to protect law and order as this planet becomes New Lycothos.&quot;<br />
<br />
I watched as the iPad then switched back to the warrior caste. Its chart was rather simple, with a list of military ranks and their icon next to them, which I figured made some sense. Warriors really only had a handful of jobs in Lycothan society. To hunt and provide food, to battle external enemies, and enforce the law at the direction of the Alphas and other related tasks. The chart started with the highest rank first, with its insignia beside it. It read: 1) Fleet Admiral/General of the Army, with its insignia of five gold wolf&#39;s head decals, 2) Admiral/General Sr. Grade, with four gold wolf&#39;s head decals and five gold bars underneath them, 3) Admiral/General Jr. Grade, with four gold wolf&#39;s head decals and four gold bars underneath them, 4) Colonel, with two gold stars, 5) Lt. Colonel, with two gold stars and three red bars, 6) Major with two gold stars and two red bars, 7) Commander, with one gold star and one silver star and two red bars, 8) Captain with a single silver star and three red bars, 9) Lieutenant with a single silver star, 10) Warrior Sr. Grade, with three red bars, 11) Warrior Jr. Grade, with two red bars, and finally 12) Warrior (Recruit), with one red bar.<br />
<br />
&quot;These are OUR ranks,&quot; Lartara spoke, &quot;and the ranks you two will be most familiar with, as you or your sisters will hold them. And remember, whatever you may personally feel... these ranks will be with you for your days, regardless of what rank you earn. Treat them with honor and do not dishonor them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lartara then raised her voice, as if to hold our attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME, WARRIORS?&quot; Lartara spoke firmly, not quite a yell, but definitely forceful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Captain,&quot; Eira and I answered together.</p>
