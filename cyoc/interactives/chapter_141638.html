<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Early the next morning Tiffany awoke groggily, confused to find herself not in her own bed. Sitting up she felt the large weights on her chest shift and like a dam breaking the memories of the previous day came flooding back. She quickly jumped out of bed leaving her Master blissfully snoring away, the dried remains of her first true sexual encounter as a woman still sticking to her legs added another confirmation that the everything she remembered hadn&#39;t just been a horrible nightmare. As quietly as she could Tiffany opened the bedroom door and this time making sure the corridor was empty tiptoed down to the bathroom to get clean again.<br />
<br />
After a great deal of hot water and scrubbing, Tiffany finally felt clean enough to return to her bedroom and get ready for what she hoped would be a day of payback. Making sure to lock the door behind her Tiffany stepped inside and was surprised to find her uniform thrown in a heap at the bottom of her bed. On top was a hand written note in what she recognised as Lewis&#39;s messy scrawl. Realising he must&#39;ve picked it up after she dropped it in the corridor in her panic to get away from him the night before she quickly read the note.<br />
<br />
“You might have gotten away this time, but don&#39;t worry there&#39;s always tomorrow night. While you were pissing yourself and hiding I made a change to your outfit I know a little sissy like you is going to love; enjoy having the only thing you can wear covered in my jizz. Knowing you&#39;re parading around in my sticky man juice all day will definitely get me in the mood and next time I see you you&#39;d better be a good little slut and do as you&#39;re told or I&#39;ll make sure you regret it.”<br />
<br />
Dropping the note back down Tiffany picked up her dress and saw that Lewis was as good as his word, it was covered in huge stains who&#39;s origin she really didn&#39;t want to think about. Having no intention of wearing anything soiled like that she put the sullied clothes in the washing hamper and went to her wardrobe. Pulling it open she felt felt a sudden wave of despair, Lewis had been right about the maid outfit being the only thing she could wear, seeing all her old male clothes she knew that even if any of them had come close to fitting her she&#39;d never be able to put any of them on. Taking in the sight of worn jeans and printed T-shirts all she could hear was her magically altered mind screaming at her that everything in there was totally wrong. Even knowing what had been done to it she longed to feel her silky black and white uniform against her skin again, to look every inch the pretty little maid she now was. Taking down what had once been her favourite shirt even the mere thought of wearing it again made her skin burn in disgust.<br />
<br />
Rage at her predicament welled up within her but her new personality wouldn&#39;t let her so much as toss the lump of useless fabric aside. “A maid cleans mess, she never creates it” a part of her mind scolded her. Instead she just put it back neatly, slammed the wardrobe shut and sank to the floor as hot tears rolled down her cheeks. <br />
<br />
Suddenly the noise of someone banging on her door broke Tiffany from her stupor. “What the fuck do you think you&#39;re doing slamming shit at this time in the morning!” Mike&#39;s raised voice carried effortlessly through the flimsy piece of  wood. “Get the fuck out her right now so I can shout at you properly!”<br />
<br />
Still totally naked Tiffany grabbed her damp towel and made herself as decent as possible before rushing to obey her master and opened the door to find him in nothing but his boxer shorts. <br />
<br />
“Wait, who are...” Mike said, trailing off as his anger melting away into confusion until a moment later realisation spread across his face. “Holy shit, you&#39;re really a girl. I thought that was just some crazy dream I had.”<br />
<br />
“Yes Master.”<br />
<br />
“And you actually are my maid.” His lust filled grin began to return as he dropped his eyes to stare at the breasts her towel couldn&#39;t properly conceal. “Well you&#39;d better get that cute butt of yours back into uniform Missy. We can&#39;t have you running around the dorm naked now.”<br />
<br />
Despite her overwhelming desire to follow his order on the spot her shear revulsion at having to wear something covered in cum stains momentarily won out.<br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t understand Master, Lewis stole my dress last night and defiled it to get me back for not having sex with him. Please at least let me wash it first.”<br />
<br />
“Defiled huh, I suppose your new girly brain can&#39;t say anything as vulgar as he &#39;jacked off&#39; on it. I&#39;ll have to have a word with him about trying to take what&#39;s mine, no-one fucks that pussy but me. Still, taking care of your uniform is your responsibility, if you where so careless as to drop it in front of him maybe you deserve a punishment and you should wear it as is for a while.”<br />
<br />
“Please Master, don&#39;t make me do that.” Tiffany begged, disgust at the order flowing through her.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;ll do as I tell you, go and get dressed this instant. Remember I said no-one else fucks that pussy, any more back chat and I&#39;ll just go ahead and let Lewis have a go with that pretty little mouth of yours. Heck maybe I&#39;ll give every man in the building a turn, with a cock hungry slut like you on offer I bet they&#39;ll even pay for the privilege.”<br />
<br />
“Yes Master” Tiffany said, her shoulder slumped in defeat.<br />
<br />
“Good, now go make yourself presentable.” he said and stomped back to his room.<br />
<br />
After gently shutting and relocking her door Tiffany walked back over to her bed. Thankfully everything except the dress was still free of Lewis&#39;s taint and she slowly went about pulling on her underwear. That done she went over to the hamper and gingerly pulled the dress back out; she stared at it for a moment before the compulsion to obey finally won and she slid it over her head once again. Despite cringing at the feeling of the crusty spots brushing against her skin she couldn&#39;t help but enjoy the silky material sliding over her body as her altered personality told her she was doing well by dressing as the Master expected.<br />
<br />
Finishing off with her headdress and heels Tiffany stepped in front of the mirror and made sure everything was arranged properly before leaving the room and heading to the common area.<br />
<br />
“How can I serve you Master” she said seeing Mike sitting and watching TV, now fully clothed.<br />
<br />
“There, isn&#39;t that much better” he said turning to look at his servant in her cum stained shame. “You can go and cook me some breakfast. And be quick about it I&#39;ve got class in an hour”.<br />
<br />
Tiffany set about obeying her orders knowing she only had to endure him a little longer. Soon he&#39;d be out long enough for her to grab the lamp and turn the tables. Only a little longer.</p>
