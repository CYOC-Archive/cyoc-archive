<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">”Make it up to you? Oh yeah, how will I be doing that?” Ken smirked.<br />
<br />
The bearish young man scooted back a foot, revealing Ken’s hard, twitching cock. Ken found himself staring up into Jeff’s oddly soft brown eyes. Jeff leaned down and kissed him softly on the lips, his beard rubbing against Ken’s cheeks.<br />
<br />
Ken could see Jeff’s fat, erect cock and sweaty, low-hanging balls. Jeff’s musk was filling the room, and Ken realized that he didn’t mind the scent. In fact, it was growing on him the longer he inhaled it. <br />
<br />
Jeff gently probed Ken’s rosebud, before letting out a disappointed grunt.<br />
<br />
“You’re way too tight down here for me to fit.” <br />
<br />
“We don’t have to do butt stuff to have sex, you know,” Ken said, eyeing Jeff’s veiny cock.<br />
<br />
“I want to.” Jeff said grumpily. “Can I change it so we’ve had sex before?”<br />
<br />
“You’re the registered user, babe.” Ken shrugged, a little worried, but Jeff wouldn’t make major changes. Not yet, at least. “Go ahead and do whatever you want.”<br />
<br />
“Whatever I want, huh?” Jeff grinned. “How about I turn you into a sex doll?”<br />
<br />
“And be a sad, lonely gay guy who only has a sex doll to keep him satisfied?” Ken smirked.<br />
<br />
Jeff growled, “No! I wanna plow you like you deserve!”<br />
<br />
“I’m not stopping you, stud. You have full user access.” Ken shrugged.<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled away from Ken, leaving his boyfriend on the bed and lumbered over to the computer.<br />
<br />
“Huh, that’s weird. There’s an error message or something.” Jeff read out loud. “Warning: User not returned to ‘One who is willing to use Chronivac’. Corrective action will be taken if not corrected immediately.” Jeff turned to Ken. “What the hell does that mean?”<br />
<br />
“No idea. You want to use the Chronivac, right?” Ken frowned, growing a little worried.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Obviously,” Jeff spread his arms.<br />
<br />
That gave Ken some sense of relief as Jeff continued to fiddle with the Chronivac.  But still - had he forgotten something? Some setting he’d hit to make Jeff not want to use the Chronivac? But he hadn’t, he’d just turned Jeff into a perfectly loyal girlfriend. That was technically a constraint on Jeff’s use, but he’d undone that when he turned Jess back.<br />
<br />
“There we go.” Jeff said finally, hitting enter.<br />
<br />
Ken shivered, something strange passing through him, like a force. He looked at himself but was still an athlete. He wondered what Jeff had changed.<br />
<br />
“Now let’s get to work.” Jeff smiled, getting on the bed and raising Ken’s legs over his shoulders. “Let’s loosen you up down here.”<br />
<br />
Ken lay back and felt Jeff rub his firm ass slowly, pulling his cheeks apart and exposing the tight pink rosebud that lay between them. He could feel Jeff’s hot breath on his hole, the bristles of his short beard scritching the sides of his buttcheeks. Then Jeff pressed his tongue to Ken’s hot little pucker, slurping and probing it slowly.<br />
<br />
A gasp tore from Ken’s throat, the quarterback arching his back as his hole was eaten out. His ass clenched and relaxed around the wrestler’s tongue. <br />
<br />
“Oh fuck, that feels so good!” Ken exclaimed, shivering in ecstasy as his hole was explored.<br />
<br />
Both men’s cocks were dripping heavily.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, you taste nice and clean.” Jeff commented, licking deep into Ken’s inner passage. “Yeah, you’re nice and loose now.”<br />
<br />
Withdrawing his tongue slowly, Jeff spat in his hand and rubbed his dick, precum and saliva mixing and lubing it properly. Then he pressed the fat head of his cock to the tight ring of muscle between Ken’s asscheeks.<br />
<br />
“Fuck yes! I wanna feel that hard dick deep inside me!” Ken exclaimed, throwing his head back and pushing wantonly against the probing tip.<br />
<br />
Ken wasn’t sure what had gotten into him all of a sudden, but Jeff was such a big, hot guy and Ken wanted to feel him inside of him.<br />
<br />
His slippery tight pucker grabbed onto Jeff’s throbbing cockhead, practically devouring it as the huge wrestling stud pushed forward slowly, spreading that hungry hole wide. <br />
<br />
“Fuck!” Jeff snarled, the soft hot inside of that tight tunnel gripping his pole and drawing it in.<br />
<br />
Ken groaned and pushed back as his ass engulfed Ken’s big fat cock. In mere moments, Jeff had bottomed out in his hare flesh, Ken’s innards squeezing and milking his cock all the while. Ken could feel the immense strain and pressure on his ring, it spasmed and clenched around the intruder and felt so good.<br />
<br />
“Goddamn, you know how to take a cock!” Jeff rumbled happily. “You’re so fuckin’ tight!”<br />
<br />
Jeff clutched at Ken’s bulbous, muscular ass, pulling him closer. Then he started to thrust. As he bucked his hips, Jeff began to get into the rhythm and started pushing back. The two young men moved in unison, pleasuring each other.<br />
<br />
“Your dick is so big!” Ken marveled, feeling himself get stretched properly by his handsome boyfriend’s fat hog. “Fuck me harder, big boy!”<br />
<br />
And it was true, Ken’s mind was gripped with a strange, insatiable lust for Jeff. He was so big and masculine and his cock was so nice in his bussy. He gripped Jeff’s burly form, moaning, running his hands over the bigger man’s back, feeling the muscles flex with each thrust.<br />
<br />
Jeff growled animalistically and fucked Ken harder and deeper, getting into a ball-slapping rhythm. The pair huffed and puffed, Ken jack-hammering his fat cock into Ken’s soft, squeezing depths. Jeff moaned in delight as he was taken by his perfect boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Sweat dripped down their forms, making the room smell of sweat and hot male sex.<br />
<br />
It was too much, Ken couldn’t hold back his orgasm. He gripped his lover’s muscular form and nuzzled his beard.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna-Jeff, I’m gonna blow!” Ken whined girlishly. “Cum inside me!”<br />
<br />
Jeff gripped Ken to his meaty chest and thrust forward with all his strength, slamming his beer can-thick cock up Ken’s quivering rectum with a loud *squelch*.<br />
<br />
Ken let out a cry of pleasure, his cock firing hot loads of cum, splattering his and Jeff’s abs and chests as he came hands-free.<br />
<br />
Jeff rumbled his own happy cry, his cock spasming and filling Ken’s insides with a flood of his virile seed. Ken’s innards spasmed and flexed around Jeff’s cock, milking his load pulling it deeper into him and draining the wrestler’s heft balls.<br />
<br />
Then they lay panting on the bed, their skin moist with sweat and stinking of musk. Ken reached over, pulling Jeff to him, before planting their lips together and making out, unable to keep his hands and mouth off of the burly young man.  Yet, despite the feeling of their bodies and lips pressed tightly together, something felt off.  Ken felt a strange emptiness inside of him, just above his balls, which screamed that this wasn’t enough. <br />
<br />
As Ken lay there, paused briefly in thought, Jeff looked him straight in the eyes, then reached around and gently cupped his ass.<br />
<br />
“How was that for your first time?” Jeff growled.<br />
<br />
“That was…” Ken caught his breath, “Amazing!”<br />
<br />
“Good, because there’s more where that came from.” Jeff grinned.<br />
<br />
Even as Jeff spoke, Ken could feel his boyfriend’s cock harden within him. <br />
<br />
He groaned as the big wrestler began thrusting inside of him again, his bubble but clapping in tandem. Ken’s own cock hardened and he pressed back into the fuck. Jeff dumped a few loads into Ken that night, properly breaking him in.<br />
<br />
Ken loved every second of it.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=--=-=-==-<br />
<br />
The next day, Ken woke up, his handsome boyfriend slumbering beside him.<br />
<br />
He was the little spoon. It was oddly comforting, feeling the large man’s arms around him, the pleasant scratch of his beard on the back of Ken’s neck. Ken saw the alarm was about to go off in a few minutes. He still felt sleepy, but then he remembered what his plan for the day was and the dread of going to school was replaced with giddy excitement.<br />
<br />
“Jeff,” Ken said softly, “Wake up, it’s time to get our new car!”<br />
<br />
“Truck,” Jeff muttered.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
Jeff rolled over and his bearded face stretched into a grin. “I want a truck.”<br />
<br />
“Ferrari.”<br />
<br />
“Do you any idea how expensive insurance on a Ferrari is?” Jeff said seriously. “We can’t afford it.”<br />
<br />
“Huh.” Ken raised a brow and shrugged. “Well, you’re the car guy.”<br />
<br />
Jeff rolled out of bed, heading to the bathroom, but Ken paused as realized what he had just said. Was Jeff into cars? That was so odd, he couldn’t even recall setting that as a preference in the Chronivac. But maybe it was, like, an automatic sort of thing?<br />
<br />
<br />
Ken listened as his boyfriend turned on the shower and considered going back to the warm, fluffy embrace of sleep. The alarm on his phone went off and he shut it off with a groan. Rolling out of bed, he felt a faint ache in his abdomen and chest, though he brushed it off as post-coitus pains. His asshole throbbed hungrily, sore but ready to go again even though Jeff had plowed him twice last night.<br />
<br />
It was strange, he’d never felt this insatiable before. It was like he was filled with this nervous energy. His body felt flushed. Ken wanted to be by Jeff, wanted to feel the big, masculine jock deep inside him again.<br />
<br />
“What the hell kind of changes did he do to me?” Ken wondered aloud. <br />
<br />
He walked over to the Chronivac, pulling up the app. He was greeted with another message.<br />
<br />
“Warning: User not returned to ‘One who is willing to use Chronivac’. Corrective action is being taken.” Ken read with annoyance. “What the fuck? That can’t be right at all.”<br />
<br />
Ken was dumbfounded. Jeff had literally just used the Chronivac on him in a way that was causing him some bit of concern. If that wasn’t *willing*, then what the fuck was? Did *any* transformation done to the user somehow impede their ability to use the Chronivac freely, then? That was stupid. It had to be a bug.<br />
<br />
He found the contact e-mail and sent a message to the system admins, stating his position.<br />
<br />
Ken *had* changed Jeff, he admitted in the e-mail, but after the warning message, he had given Jeff control back and turned him into a man. Surely a self-initiated reality alteration was allowed? And more to the point, he was fairly certain Jeff had made small changes to himself. For example, this morning, Jeff’s previously scraggy beard had filled in to become much more masculine.<br />
<br />
With a beep, the message was sent off into the… well, wherever the hell messages went, hopefully to Transdem.<br />
<br />
The bathroom door opened and Jeff lumbered out, his body still big, bearded, hairy, muscular, with that bit of fat that made him look like a bear. It set Ken’s heart aflutter in his chest and he stared as Jeff’s cock slapped against his thighs with every step, the huge member always at a half-chub.<br />
<br />
“It’s ready for you, babe.” Jeff grinned, combing his beard out.<br />
<br />
Ken walked past, letting out a little yip as Jeff slapped his ass.<br />
<br />
Ken turned to close the door when he saw the warning message disappear from the Chronivac as soon as Jeff went near it. He blinked and did a doubletake, watching his big boyfriend take a seat and start scrolling through a tutorial. Had the Chronivac somehow sensed Jeff’s presence and unlocked itself?<br />
<br />
This was getting dangerous, but if he stayed here and spied on Jeff, the more likely his big boyfriend would decide he needed a change. Basic human psychology. So Ken turned on the shower and tried to keep himself distracted from the trouble he could feel brewing on the horizon.<br />
<br />
There was a new soap and a bottle of pink shampoo in the bathroom that he didn’t recognize, so he tried them out. Normally, he never used soap, just bodywash, but today he was feeling adventurous. He lathered up the soap and felt it glide over his body as a light floral scent filled the room. The shampoo, meanwhile, was pleasant and tingled against his scalp - probably because of the eucalyptus the bottle proclaimed it contained. <br />
<br />
He’d have to find out the manufacturer of this soap, it was working as advertised! The rub of the soap and the warmth of the water made him shiver and bite his lip as a sudden line of electricity raced up his spine. His cock stirred and Ken pushed at it, groaning quietly.<br />
<br />
As he slid the soap over his body, his skin felt softer and smoother. He never noticed his body hair flake away under his touch as he rubbed the dirt from his skin. It sloughed off of him like he’d applied Nair to the soap. When he washed his balls, he thought he felt a soft tug on them and shivered, his cock going rock hard.<br />
<br />
Ken smirked and stroked his big cock. <br />
<br />
As he jerked off to the sensitive feeling of his skin, his fingers slipped on his slippery shaft and pressed against a spot just beneath his balls, which felt oddly sensitive. It almost felt like there was an empty spot inside of him that pressing on his taint couldn’t quite satisfy. <br />
<br />
His thoughts went to Jeff, the burly, rugged young wrestler, and how he had plowed his hole, filled him with his virile seed.<br />
<br />
That fantasy set Ken off quick. He groaned and semen splashed the walls of the shower in great spurts. His balls ached afterwards and that empty feeling hadn’t quite gone away, but it still felt amazing. <br />
<br />
His orgasm fading, Ken just sat there as the water washed over him and couldn’t help but think that this was the best shower of his life.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes, the pleasure faded, and his body was clean.  Ken turned off the water and stepped out, As he toweled off, he found himself brushing long, damp strands of his shoulder-length hair out of his eyes. His reflection stared back at him and Ken went to get his razor to shave but paused. He ran his hand over his soft, smooth cheeks. No stubble met his fingers.<br />
<br />
“Huh, guess I don’t have to shave today.” The handsome, blue-eyed man stared at his reflection. Were his cheekbones higher?  He flashed himself a gleaming grin before getting dressed.<br />
<br />
By the time he was dressed, Jeff was already waiting for him at the door, dressed in a casual outfit and still pulling it off.<br />
<br />
“Ready, babe?” Jeff winked. “You smell good.<br />
<br />
Ken nodded, his boyfriend wrapping an arm around him and pulling him close. Ken leaned into Jeff, smelling the light musk that managed to evade the deodorant stick, his cock rigid. Together, the two lovers went out to Ken’s car.<br />
<br />
It was only after they were halfway down the road that Ken realized he hadn’t seen Jeff’s mom or dad.<br />
<br />
“Jeff, where were your parents?” Ken asked.<br />
<br />
“Hmm?” Jeff grunted, his eyes not leaving the road. “Oh, they leave for work early. That’s why we could fuck without them caring. They’re fast asleep after 9.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Ken nodded.<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled up to the light just before the turn off to their high school and the engine abruptly shut off.<br />
<br />
“Damn thing!” Jeff snarled, turning the engine back on just after the light turned green. <br />
<br />
The engine restarted and they drove into the parking lot.<br />
<br />
“Good thing we’re getting a new truck today.” Ken smiled, patting Jeff’s hairy arm. “No more stallouts.”<br />
<br />
Jeff grunted, his brows bunched together like two hairy beetles. “Fucking piece of shit car.”<br />
<br />
Ken snorted. “It’s alright, we’re at school, calm down.”<br />
<br />
Jeff glared at him for a moment before his eyes softened. “Yeah, sorry. Just get angry easier these days.”<br />
<br />
Ken nodded as they got out and entered their high school.</p>
