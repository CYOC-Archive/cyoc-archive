<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seeing as the four friends were going to be two-headed conjoined twins living in this institute for their foreseeable futures, they decided that they should at least &quot;bond&quot; with the other test subjects here. So, they all changed into new clothes from their new wardrobes, leaving their things in their rooms as they went back downstairs. There were several other test subjects down in the lobby, though it felt weird and normal for Matt, Rex, Jeff, and John to meet them--they were sharing two bodies with each other, but they had been separate guys until recently due to the teleportation experiments of those scientists.<br />
<br />
One of the subjects was a wide body with two arms, two legs, wearing dark gray pants and a dark blue shirt: the two heads identified themselves as Ethan and Grayson. Another pair of guys had the same body, wearing patterned white pants and a pale blue shirt, though their hairstyles were different--one had dark hair, the other blonde. Their names were Ricky and Kian. Wearing all black were Lucas and Marcus. Black pants and a gray short adorned Emilio and Ivan. Reed and Devin wore a white shirt and beige pants, Sam and Colby jeans and a black shirt. Troy and Chase&#39;s white shirt looked two plain for a two-headed body, but they said they had nothing else to wear. Nina and Randa had a pink shirt and black pants; interestingly, their boyfriends Austin and Aaron were there as well in a green shirt and dark blue pants--the boyfriends had gone through the experiment so that they could be conjoined twins like their girlfriends and stay with them here at the Institute. Kyle and Ben had a pale blue shirt and dark blue sweatpants. Brandon and Isaac wore a green shirt with plaid gray pants. Luc and Cooper had a gray shirt and black pants--these two had actually been really close brothers before the experiment, and enjoyed being a two-headed body ever since. There was an older pair as well, wearing black pants and a dark blue shirt: Bob and Bill had a similar relationship to Luc and Cooper, but they did not agree on everything as the younger conjoined twins did. Brendan and John&#39;s green shirt and gray pants made everything about them (except their heads) appear the same as Brandon and Isaac. Johnny and James were more &quot;street&quot; than the others, and judging by their peed pants and the beer on their gray shirt they were likely drunk. Another pair wore blue pants with diamonds and a bright green shirt: only Vito&#39;s head identified himself, the other was too shy. One pair was younger than the others; these boys only wore sweatpants and a gray robe. Larry and Dave were friends, and now conjoined twins; their brown shirt was their favorite. Justin and Andrew had black pants, a gray shirt, and a brownish-green jacket. Another older pair had jeans and a gray shirt, and their right-hand head wore a tie; they both seemed to feel gray--perhaps they missed their old lives as separate people. Ryan and Brian had blue pants, a green long-sleeve shirt, and a white Nike shirt; they were likely eleven years old. Matt and Andy&#39;s outfit was jeans and a gray T-shirt. Another pair wore an Angry Birds sweatshirt; red was their favorite color. Joshua and Gavin had red pants and a gray shirt, a rare combination among all the people there. Leo, Donnie, Raph, and Mikey were there as well, their pale green shirt uniting them, but not as much as their shared body--Matt and Rex hoped that they would grow close with the four, as did Jeff and John. Their was also a boy with a wide body and four identical heads; the red shirt looked similar to the blue shirt of the four-headed girl that the newbies saw when they first arrived. Then there was Jake, Zack, and another Jake; three heads were certainly better than one in their case. The same could be said for McKenzie, Sierra, and Dakota. Tim, David, and Josh were off and on about working together, and they didn&#39;t always get along with each other--sometimes, they wanted to get away from each other, despite knowing that they had no choice. Another dude had four legs; it was interesting to see them crossed. Another had six arms; very &quot;handy&quot; for him. Another pair had two heads and three legs. Another guy had a long torso; he was at least eight feet tall. There was also one guy who had no legs, but instead a long tail; he must have gone through the experiment with a snake. The remaining ten--excluding the other subjects that were introduced in the previous chapter--were there as well; they all looked as though they had been fused with some images that the guys had seen online--maybe they had those images printed out and on them when they went thorough the experiment.<br />
<br />
Matt and Rex, along with Jeff and John, began to wonder if they would truly feel comfortable here, whether or not they were conjoined siblings now.</p>
