<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Todd! It&#39;s good that you want to participate in the class for a change!&quot; Mr Bretman said and surprised Ty because he wasn&#39;t controlling him when he said that. Is Mr Bretman really enjoying this so much that he has go over Ty&#39;s influence?<br />
<br />
Ty became to be worried because this situation could be going out of his control. So he thought that it will be enough of big bodies and make a wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish all boys return to their normal-selves!&quot; He whispered and immediately a golden wind cover all the classroom and vanished almost a second later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did it work?&quot; Ty questioned himself and saw that nobody has changed. In fact, he watched how Todd the bully, who was already a mammoth before, now was twice his size. He was for sure at least 7&#39; height, covered with more muscles than any other person Ty had seen before, even the bodybuilders he had seen on TV. Each step that Todd did was enough to make the floor shake and Ty thought that his feet could make Hulk envy.<br />
<br />
As he walked through the classroom, a strong musky scent could be smelled from him. His clothes had been torn long time ago and he was just wearing small looking briefs that hardly were containing his huge endowment.<br />
<br />
Ty was sure that bulge size was all but normal and he was even worried that his magic could have ended and he wasn&#39;t able to turn them back to normal. It was funny for a while to be huge like jocks but he couldn&#39;t imagine how he would deal with that body, or his parents or his friends or even his friends&#39; parents!<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I wish we will turn back to normal!&quot; He begged again and again but nothing happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty, are you alright?&quot; A guy next to him said, but Ty was too focused on his own thought that he didn&#39;t cared about it... until he realized that the boy voice was soft and childish, not a deep baritone or something like that.<br />
<br />
When Ty opened his eyes he saw that his classmate who was sitting next to him was holding a hand over his shoulder, but the guy&#39;s arm wasn&#39;t big or manly. It was a normal and thin boy&#39;s arm. Actually, the boy was a regular boy, not a freaking muscle man and then he realized that his own body had returned to normal. He was so glad that he didn&#39;t care that their clothes were still ripped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine! I&#39;m really fine... Thanks for asking!&quot; Ty said to the guy who give him a slight concern sight and returned to attend the class.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so glad that it worked...&quot; Ty sighed, but his happiness didn&#39;t last for too long because at that time Todd was walking next to him. As usual, he pushed Ty a little with his shoulder and then Ty noted that he had returned to his normal jock bully self. He was still too big, but he wasn&#39;t as big as he was a moment ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute!&quot; Ty thought that something wasn&#39;t right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is Todd still walking to the front?&quot; Ty thought and after more carefully he realized why.<br />
<br />
In front of everybody, almost naked and completely red of embarrassment, there was a huge, buff and manly Jason waiting to be spanked by an almost big Todd who has an evil grin as he approached to his victim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prepare that ass, Brooks!&quot; He said when he finally arrived. &quot;Because I&#39;ve desired this for a long time!&quot;<br />
<br />
Even outside the classroom could be Heard the strong sound that the contact between Todd&#39;s hand and Jason&#39;s ass. Todd was giving his best in each spank as he was enjoying this too much. To Ty, seeing these two big guy almost naked and spanking one to the other was almost surrealistic. How had he let things go too far?<br />
<br />
&quot;I must do something.&quot; Ty thought. &quot;But what?&quot;<br />
<br />
As he was thinking, Jason&#39;s ass was turning as red as a big tomatoe and even though Todd&#39;s palm was taking the same color he didn&#39;t look to stop soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s enough, Todd.&quot; Mr Bretman said. Was he still under Ty&#39;s influence? He didn&#39;t have time to find it out, he needed to take advantage of this moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish the class is over!&quot; He yelled and, not knowing if it was because of his wish or just a coincidence, the bell rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, that will be all for today.&quot; Mr Bretman said. &quot;You may go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd returned to his seat and after a moment just Jason, Ty and Mr Bretman were left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok, Jason?&quot; Ty asked him. &quot;I didn&#39;t mind they will go too far&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Ty. It&#39;s not your fault.&quot; Jason said. Ty saw that he had some tears on his face. &quot;It&#39;s all ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those words were heartbreaking for Ty and, even though he want to say something else, he had no idea of what to say. He was thinking when another voice call them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Brooks, Mr. Peterson. Stay there. I need to talk with you.&quot; Mr Bretman said while he was approaching to the guys.</p>
