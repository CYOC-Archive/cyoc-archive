<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trigger warnings: Self-Loathing, Depression, very close to suicidal thoughts<br />
<br />
Luke exited his room, bathroom was too enticing to pass up, he wanted to see what he looked like as an 18 year old adult! He ducked in and turned on the light, taking in his new and enhanced form. Weirdly, it was just like he imagined, well, he made the wish as a whim, so its more like the wish was granted as intended.<br />
<br />
He was further along through puberty and had gained several inches and some weight. Flexing an arm, he now seemed to have a bit of muscle, and he no longer looked like a &quot;wiry twig&quot; which is one of the things Randel always called him to goad him on. He suddenly realized that changing his age could ruin his life and quickly pulled out his wallet, terrified that he no longer matched his IDs. <br />
<br />
His fear was unnecessary because his driver&#39;s license showed he was 18 and had a photo of his new form, and even his school ID was updated to show he was a senior. A new fear of not fitting into his new life surfaced, but again his fears were quickly dismissed as he remembered going through life as a member of the class he was now suddenly part of, new social groups he was in, different friend groups. He read that this ring could change reality, but the wish he made on a whim was as complete and beneficial as if he had spent days crafting it...<br />
<br />
With how wonderfully the wish was granted he grinned and wished Randel was his little sister! Luke grimaced as he looked at the coin. The monkey&#39;s paw seeming to provide a cosmic level flipping off to his face... &quot;Well, it promised to do something, and since I&#39;m still 18 and (a quick grab to be sure) have all my parts, I should probably check on how gutted my wish was.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke hesitantly went to Randel&#39;s room, music blaring through the door. As completely as reality was updated for his wish, the outcome from his second wish was completely unknown to him. &quot;Hey, can I come in?&quot; Luke called, nervous of what the outcome might be. They could be in a fight, Randel might be a super bitchy girl, he might be sassy, obnoxious, and a Karen level of embarrassment rather than just annoying. The music suddenly dropped in volume and the door swung open. &quot;Hey, what&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Upon contact the memories of the new reality settled in. Luke tried not to hyperventilate and made the excuse that he thought Randel had called him but didn&#39;t mean to interrupt. He made his way back to his room and had his first panic attack.<br />
<br />
After taking an hour to calm down he tried to put it together. Randel is now 21 and muscular, effectively undoing the equalizing effect he had gained with his own aging. This really was a true, cruel, twist of fate. From the perspective Luke gained from having taken a few psychology courses in this new reality as an 18 year-old, he realized his goal was to disempower Randel. It seems like wishes are granted, or twisted, based off the actual intent the coin user has, but themed based on the wish itself. So rather than becoming a younger sister, he was made an even more masculine, older brother.<br />
<br />
Originally, Randel had power because he was older and bigger, and he used it as a cudgel to occasionally pick on his little brother, rubbing it in his face that Luke was a pip squeak in comparison, and couldn&#39;t overpower Randel if it came down to it. It was never serious, always just annoying shows of Randel having more control, more power than Luke.<br />
<br />
But now in this new reality, Randel is kind, thoughtful even. Randel has never said anything cruel, nor used his strength against his little brother. Randel doesn&#39;t have to try to make Luke&#39;s life difficult, it just happens. Randel got a full scholarship to a four year university and is about to finish his master&#39;s degree early. Randel is an amateur fitness buff and uses his strength as a volunteer fire fighter. He helps at the local homeless shelter. Randel always did this, Randel always loved that. There was no light that Randel&#39;s shadow failed to block!<br />
<br />
Randel wasn&#39;t a pain in the ass to Luke in this reality. He didn&#39;t need to be. His parents, no, the whole extended family does it for him. &quot;Oh, you got a C in that class? Randel always got As. Why is it so hard for you, are you applying yourself?&quot; &quot;Your parents told me you were having a tough go in school it must be so nice having Randel as a big brother, my siblings never offered any of their old notes to help me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Luke was never good enough. Despite himself he hated Randel for making it happen, but Randel never did it intentionally so he hated himself instead, and hated himself even more for wishing Randel would stop being so amazing at everything he does... &quot;I really am a bad person.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke was trying to ignore these feelings, to logic his way past them since he knew this is all the coin, but they were a part of him and visceral. Like with his new class schedule and newly acquired skills, the feelings were just beneath the surface and took no effort to pull up, and a ton of effort to put down... Trying felt pointless, and everything is awful. Luke&#39;s prior memories of excelling at his studies and finding at least some classes interesting were quickly fading away. &quot;Oh my god, I think I have depression now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The opposite of disempower is empower, and what&#39;s more empowered than having others do the task for you without having to ask? Luke looked at the coin with a mixture of disgust and respect, &quot;So, this is what it means to lose the coin flip... It could have been worse, I could have been trying to embarrass him.&quot; Luke buried his face in his pillow and began crying. He felt worthless, like his mere existence was a burden on anyone who had the displeasure of knowing him. He knew that was his brain being messed with by the coin, but that didn&#39;t make it feel any less real to him.</p>
