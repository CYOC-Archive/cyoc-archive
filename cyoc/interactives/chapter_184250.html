<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Theo exited the window with Miss Willoughby’s profile on it. He then found the selection of nearby Karen Willoughby’s still on the screen. He idly scrolled through them all, surprised by just how many people there were with the same name. It made think, did anyone else have the same name as him?<br />
Conscious of his time, Theo typed his name and looked at the results:<br />
‘Theodore Williams’<br />
Of course, the first result was himself as he had the nearby filter switched on, but he scrolled down. Further and further, it kept going on and on. Theo scrolled long enough that he had to click the next page. He decided not to, instead scrolling back up to himself.<br />
He was apprehensive as to whether or not click himself, but decided what the hell.<br />
<br />
It opened, showing a full body image of himself. It showed his entire body, perfectly. Every inch of him was exact. His eyes were immediately drawn to his penis. He was above average, not by a lot, but wasn’t insecure about it. He couldn’t believe how perfectly it showed his measurements either. His weight, height, muscle mass. He couldn’t help but check his penis length,<br />
‘7.2 inches’<br />
Theo had never measured it before, so it was interesting to see exactly what his size was.<br />
<br />
Ding Dong!<br />
<br />
Theo heard the doorbell ring, “shit,” he said to himself, quickly hiding the application. He left his room, closing the door behind him. Immediately he was confronted by his sister,<br />
“You said Connor wasn’t coming over tonight?” She said, arms crossed,<br />
“Yeah I know. The plans changed,” Theo replied,<br />
“So is he coming over tomorrow?” Hannah asked, “or is he staying the night?”<br />
“No,” Theo said, aware that Connor was waiting outside his door, “Connor is coming over now, and I’m seeing him tomorrow,” Theo corrected, “now we need to let them in,” he said, turning and going for the stairs,<br />
“Wait. Them?” Hannah asked. Theo stopped on the stairs, turning to face her,<br />
“Yes he invited his brother,”<br />
“Really!!” Hannah said joyfully, “I’ll race you for the door!” She said, quickly starting the stairs. She was down the stairs much faster than Theo, but Theo knew she couldn’t be the one to let them in. Connor was most likely a little aggravated about the change in plans.<br />
<br />
Theo ran down the stairs, he approached the end, seeing the front door. Hannah was about to open it, “wait!” He shouted, “let me do it!” He got to the bottom of the stairs. Running to the front door,<br />
“Jeez, slow down,” Hannah said, hypocritically.<br />
Theo unlocked the door and opened it. Outside it was Theo’s boyfriend Connor, and his little brother James.<br />
<br />
“If my parents murder me, I’ll kill you,” Connor said to Theo, walking into the house. Theo was a little anxious, he knows Connor hates when plans get changed,<br />
“You’ll understand why I brought you. Trust me,” Theo said to his boyfriend, turning to face him. Connor looked up from the floor, “but I really appreciate that you came. Seriously,” Theo finished, smiling sincerely,<br />
“Eh, it’s fine,” Connor said, his mood changing, “me and James weren’t doing much anyway. At least I get to hang with you, and James gets to hang out with his second mom,” he joked. Both boys looked at James and Hannah. James was only 12 while Hannah was 17. <br />
“So how was the Spelling test we were practicing?” Hannah asked James,<br />
“Oh, it went pretty well!” He replied happily, “I got 85%!” He told her,<br />
“No way!” She shouted back, “that’s amazing!!” Hannah said with absolute joy in her voice,<br />
Connor and Theo looked at each other and smirked. Hannah had always been good at encouraging people, especially when it came to younger kids. She had this ‘motherly nature’ to her. She constantly talked about children and how she would raise, teach, speak, and so many other things, it drove Theo crazy. But it was sweet really, and he knew that.<br />
Connor put his arm on Theo’s shoulder, leaning on him, “we’re gonna be the best uncles,” he said,<br />
Theo smiled, “the most badass uncles,”<br />
<br />
Theo and Connor made their way upstairs, but just before they could disappear, James yelled up the stairs, “hey! You promised pizza!”<br />
Theo and Connor stopped on the stairs, Connor turning to face Theo, “you did promise...” he remarked. Connor continued up the stairs. Theo yelled back down the stairs,<br />
“I’ll order it in a minute,”<br />
He quickly jogged up the stairs, seeing Connor enter his room. He had completely forgotten about the application. He almost run across the hall to his room, grabbing the door and pulling himself inside.<br />
“Uhm... what the hell is this?” Connor asked, clicking on the weird looking icon on the bottom of the screen,<br />
“No!” Theo yelled, but it was too late.<br />
The browser opened once again. The screen was covered by half stats, and the other half a perfect recreation of Theo’s nude body,<br />
“What the fuck!?” Connor said loudly, stepping backwards, “what is this!?” He asked again, turning to look at Theo, but immediately looking back to the screen,<br />
“It’s...” Theo didn’t know how to explain it quickly, “it’s this app thing that I found on this disk that I downloaded,” he tried,<br />
“W-what?” Connor asked, very confused.<br />
<br />
“I heard yelling, are you two okay?” Hannah asked, approaching the door. Theo immediately slammed the door shut,<br />
“Hide the browser!” He ordered Connor in panic. Connor quickly jumped back to the computer and closed the application,<br />
“Are you seriously watching-” Hannah started, but was interrupted by Theo opening the door with a forced smile,<br />
“Sorry!” He said loudly. Connor was sitting by the computer. Hannah looked at the screen, the only thing on it was the website for the Pizza place,<br />
“O—kay...” she said, a little surprised to not see something she some kind of porn on the screen, “well... James wants Pepperoni,” she added,<br />
“Got it!” Theo said, adding a thumbs up afterwards. Something he had never done in his life. He went to close the door on her, but she caught it with her foot, pushing it back open,<br />
“Can you at least order the pizza before you get... distracted,” she implied,<br />
“Don’t worry, we’re on it, Hannah,” Connor said to her from the computer seat,<br />
“At least one of you is normal,” she said, moving her foot and pulling the door almost shut.<br />
Theo slapped his hand against it, closing it.<br />
<br />
“So what do you want?” Connor asked, scrolling through the selection of pizza,<br />
“W-wha...” Theo replied, “are you seriously not freaking out about that!?” He asked,<br />
“Well... yeah,” Connor replied, “but two things,” he swivelled the chair to face Theo, “you can explain it to me later, and I’m hungry,” he said, turning back to the pizza selection,<br />
“B-but...” Theo couldn’t really believe Connor’s response, “what about the measurements!? The fact it was a whole model of me naked?”<br />
“It was weird, I get it. But you probably just uploaded it yourself and it- oh this looks good!” He interrupted himself mid-sentence, “okay okay,” he once again swivelled, “I want you to explain it all to me in a minute. But let’s just order this pizza so we don’t get interrupted again,” he told Theo,<br />
“I...” Theo stood there, “I have literally no other idea,” he shrugged his shoulders, “just get me plain?”<br />
“Got it,” Connor said, winking at him.<br />
<br />
Theo and Connor ordered the pizza’s. Theo left his room and called downstairs, telling them that the pizza had been ordered. He walked back to his room to find Connor had opened the application again,<br />
“Care to explain?” Connor asked.</p>
