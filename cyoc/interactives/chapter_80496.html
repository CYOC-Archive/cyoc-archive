<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Knables woke up in a forest, underneath mangrove trees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we?&quot; Diane asked, brushing her black hair behind her big mouse ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think it's 'where' so much as 'when'.&quot; Darryl said, adjusting his glasses &quot;We went into a time machine, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay here,&quot; Roy said to his wife and kids &quot;and I'll see where AND when we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment, they heard the sound of metal clashing.<br />
<br />
Roy peered out from one of the trees, and saw two men fighting eachother with swords.<br />
<br />
An old lady was watching them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm telling you,&quot; one guy said &quot;I'M the one who will find it!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I'm telling YOU,&quot; his rival said &quot;that legendary treasure will be MINE!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the two fought, they knocked over the old lady. &quot;Hey!&quot; she said &quot;Why don't you youngsters take your fight some place else?&quot;<br />
<br />
At this, they both turned on her, and were about to cut her up, but Roy, seeing this, feeling it was not right, jumped in and blocked them with <br />
his own sword he'd pulled out of his pocket.<br />
<br />
At first, the two men thought this was a joke or something, but roy had years of fencing on his side, and even at his diminished size, he <br />
wouldn't let them harm an innocent old lady!<br />
<br />
He blocked every one of their swings with his sword.<br />
<br />
The old lady watched, and so did Roy's wife, Helen, and his kids, Diane and Darryl.<br />
<br />
Finally, standing there with a defiant look on his face (the kind anime heros often have), he told them &quot;I don't know who you are, or what you're <br />
fighting about, but don't involve innocent people. I want you to leave - NOW!!!&quot; and at that last word, the men's eyes rolled back in their heads, <br />
they both foamed at the mouth, fell backward, and passed out. Even Roy was shocked as he said &quot;Cheese and crackers! What did I just do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks to me,&quot; the old lady said, smiling as she walked over to him &quot;like you awakened a bit of Haki there! Don't worry - they're not dead, but <br />
they won't be going anywhere for a while! Hee-hee-hee! Thank you so much for stopping them. If it weren't for you, I would've had to get <br />
rough with the punks! My name is Mikku. What's your name, brave warrior?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Roy Knable.&quot; he said. At that moment, his wife and kids came to him. &quot;The one with the blue fur is my wife, Helen, and these are my kids, <br />
Diane and Darryl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What a nice family.&quot; Mikku said, smiling &quot;Come with me, and we'll talk more at my place.<br />
<br />
It was a small house in a village. They went in, and Mikku made them some tea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for letting us into your home.&quot; Helen said, sipping a bit from the cup as big as her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure you don't mind having mice in your house, especially talking mice wearing clothes?&quot; Darryl asked &quot;Don't you find that a bit strange?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My child,&quot; Mikku said, sipping some of her own tea &quot;I've seen many strange things in my long life. Nothing surprises me anymore!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why were those two guys fighting back there?&quot; Diane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those two were fighting,&quot; Mikku said &quot;because they think one of them has what it takes to obtain the greatest treasure in the world. In order to <br />
fully understand the situation, you need to know the whole story, but I'm sure you all have better things to do than listen to an old bat like me <br />
weave yarns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Roy said &quot;Please tell us.&quot; and his family agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, I love telling this story, and you're the first ones I've told it to in a while.&quot; Mikku said, smiling &quot;It all started 22 years ago. There was a <br />
man named Gol D. Rodgers. He was a powerful pirate who had obtained everything the world had to offer. He was the Pirate King. He had a <br />
vast amount of treasure which he had plundered from all over the world. One day, he found out he had a terminal illness that couldn't be <br />
cured.&quot; &quot;What did he do?&quot; Darryl asked, the tea fogging up his glasses a bit &quot;He did what any sensible man in his position would do.&quot; Mikku said <br />
with a smile &quot;He threw a big party!!! Just like all D's, he didn't seem to fear death, and because he knew he would die soon anyway, he turned <br />
himself into the Marines. They took the credit for his capture, but people like me know better than that! So the execution took place in Rouge <br />
Town. Many people had come to see it. Even as Rodgers was being walked up to the executioner's platform, he could be seen grinning all the <br />
way! When he got to the top, many wanted to know where he had hid his treasure. To this, he answered with his final words: &quot;You want my <br />
treasure? Why it's right where it's always been! Search for it! I left all the world has to offer there!&quot; Since that day, pirates have swarmed into the <br />
Grand Line, searching for romance, adventure, and Gol D. Rodger's Treasure - the legendary One Piece! It lies beyond the Red Line, in the New <br />
World. Whoever conquers that sea, and claims that treasure, will become the next King of the Pirates! This is the grand age of pirates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pirates?&quot; Helen asked, steam blowing from her mouse ears from the tea she'd been drinking &quot;That just figures. Where exactly are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To be precise,&quot; Mikku said &quot;you're in the 1st half of the Grand Line on the Sabaody Archipelago. This is the last stop for pirates who want to <br />
enter the New World. Many have, but few return.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bunch of people willing to throw their lives away for treasure, huh?&quot; Helen mused &quot;And I thought I was the one going crazy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It hardly seems worth it.&quot; Diane said, agreeing with her mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's worth it to some.&quot; Mikku said, smiling and taking a sip of her tea &quot;I've got quite a collection of pirate bounties. You can look through them <br />
if you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Darryl said, looking at the posters. He'd always payed attention in school, but even in History Class, he'd never even heard of these <br />
pirates. Jewelry Bonney, Scratchmen Apoo, Eustass Kid, X-Drake, Basil Hawkins, Urouge, Capone Bege, Trafalgar Law, but one in particular <br />
caught his eye - a smiling black-haired boy with a scar under one eye, wearing a straw hat. Monkey D. Luffy: Bounty: $400,000,000 beli. &quot;This <br />
guy is weird!&quot; he said &quot;He looks so friendly, but that bounty? What kind of pirate is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is Straw-Hat Luffy.&quot; Mikku said, smiling &quot;He's the captain of the Straw-Hat pirates. He may not look as frightening as the others, but it's <br />
not for no reason he has that bounty on his head. Two years ago, he defeated Crocodile, declared war on the World Government, destroyed <br />
Enies Lobby, punched St. Carlos in the face, and even after being separated from his crew, he masterminded the mass prison break at Impel <br />
Down, got involved at the War of the Best at Marineford, came back there with Reyleigh and Jinbe to ring the Ox Bell 16 times, and has not been <br />
heard from since! He is also the son of the leader of the Revolutionaries, Dragon, and grandson of the now retired Marine hero Garb. His <br />
crewmates are nothing to sneeze at either!&quot; and she showed him their posters too. &quot;Even THAT one?&quot; he said, pointing to Tony Tony Chopper <br />
who was only worth $50. &quot;I don't think they're giving HIM enough credit.&quot; Mikku said &quot;Poor little guy. Incidentally, the word on the Sabaody <br />
Archipelago is that the Straw-Hats are back here on this island after 2 years, and are recruiting new members, but the Straw-Hats I've seen <br />
don't match the posters at all! Between you and me, I think they're fakes! The nerve of some people, am I right? Oh! I also heard that the world-<br />
famous musician Soul King Brook is performing here today. He's quite the singer considering he's nothing but bones!&quot; She showed them a <br />
picture of a skeleton with a black afro, dressed up as a rock-star. &quot;I even have one of his songs with me on a tone dial. Would you like to listen <br />
to it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Roy said, deciding they could use some relaxing music. So Mikku pressed the center of it, and it played this song:<br />
<br />
Yo-ho-ho-ho Yo-ho-ho-ho,<br />
<br />
Yo-ho-ho-ho Yo-ho-ho-ho.<br />
<br />
Yo-ho-ho-ho Yo-ho-ho-ho,<br />
<br />
Yo-ho-ho-ho Yo-ho-ho-ho.<br />
<br />
(interlude with piano)<br />
<br />
Going to bring Bink's Sake,<br />
<br />
let the sea breeze lead the way,<br />
<br />
all our days upon the waves, across the salty sea.<br />
<br />
The sun above is floating high,<br />
<br />
painting circles in the sky.<br />
<br />
Seagulls sing and brass bells ring upon our floating home.<br />
<br />
Say &quot;Good-bye&quot; to all you know,<br />
<br />
head into the sun's warm glow.<br />
<br />
Singing loud, and sailing proud, we sail into the night.<br />
<br />
Waves of gold and silver splash<br />
<br />
upon the ship and mizzenmast<br />
<br />
We float on all with a song to the ends of the sea. <br />
<br />
(interlude with piano)<br />
<br />
Going to bring Bink's Sake,<br />
<br />
just like any other day.<br />
<br />
Like a stone, our boat skips on, and slices through the seas.<br />
<br />
On clouds above, we'll rest our head.<br />
<br />
The rocking ship will be our bed.<br />
<br />
On our flag, the skull and dagger show we're to be feared.<br />
<br />
If the waves dare dance too high, <br />
<br />
if dark clouds obscure the sky,<br />
<br />
beat the drum and never run, live for that fateful dance.<br />
<br />
If in fear you turn away,<br />
<br />
You'll never see the break of day.<br />
<br />
Just hold out, without a doubt, the sun will surely rise!<br />
<br />
Yo-ho-ho-ho Yo-ho-ho-ho,<br />
<br />
Yo-ho-ho-ho Yo-ho-ho-ho.<br />
<br />
Going to bring Bink's Sake,<br />
<br />
and find our dreams along the way.<br />
<br />
Wave good-bye, try not to cry. We'll never meet again.<br />
<br />
If the sun should cease to shine, everything will still be fine.<br />
<br />
In the dark, we'll sail our bark by the light of the moon.<br />
<br />
Going to bring Bink's Sake.<br />
<br />
A pirate's job for pirate's pay.<br />
<br />
Listen now, from aft to prow, to this song of the seas.<br />
<br />
Everyone meets Davy Jones.<br />
<br />
One day we will all be bones.<br />
<br />
Until then, we'll sing again, and bring Bink his Sake.<br />
<br />
Yo-ho-ho-ho Yo-ho-ho-ho,<br />
<br />
Yo-ho-ho-ho Yo-ho-ho-ho.<br />
<br />
Yo-ho-ho-ho Yo-ho-ho-ho,<br />
<br />
Yo-ho-ho-ho Yo-ho-ho-ho.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was.... kinda morbid at the end.&quot; Roy said, as soon as it ended. <br />
<br />
&quot;But you've gotta admit, the song's pretty catchy, right?&quot; Darryl told his dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;A singing afro skeleton. Sure, why not?&quot; Diane asked &quot;At this point, I'll believe anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though I don't drink,&quot; Helen said &quot;Bits and pieces of that song actually made sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you really want to see him,&quot; Mikku said, smiling &quot;you could sneak into the concert since you're so small. Then again, for that same reason <br />
you could also sneak in to see if these 'Straw-Hats' are the real thing. It's up to you, of course.&quot;<br />
