<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adam Miths was vacationing in France with his parents. Adam had no idea why they were vacationing there. And Adam thinks they might of got lost. They were looking at a map. And it seemed they were in a part of France that nobody spoke (or knew) a even a bit of English. And Adam not his parents knew any French; so talking to anyone was worthless. So as Adam&#39;s parents were trying & failing to read the map they had Adam noticed a 5 years old girl trip & fall. Adam darted over to help the girl up. As Adam helping the girl up she touched Adam&#39;s chest saying a word in French. In a poof where a there was no longer a teen boy named Adam Miths, now stood a blue & black 1 foot  & 5 inches tall plastic anthromorphic raccoon toy. The now raccoon toy looked himself over seeing he had 3 toed paws for feet, a tail, 4 digited hands. It was also wearing nothing at all & was NULL. Had no genitalia at all; just a smooth spot on its groin now. The toy raccoons noticed that his parents were walking off seeming to not know anything had happened. To them & everyone else as far as they knew nothing did. The toy raccoon tried calling out to them not knowing that reality had changed so that it was never human. But all that came out of its mouth was a loud mechanical simulated version of a raccoon&#39;s chattering & the like. The two humans paid no mind to the toy&#39;s sounds. The toy raccoon covered his mouth in surprise. Then the toy felt a press on it&#39;s back & it went limp & everything went dark. The girl picked up her toy raccoon (was surprisingly light) & walked off with it. Adam&#39;s former parents walked off too. The plastic toy awoke (turned back on) after feeling a press on it&#39;s back. The toy raccoon saw the girl again. She said something in French. The toy raccoon tried speaking again but all that came out again was a simulated mechanical vocalization of a raccoon; but at nearly a whisper volume. The girl walked away. The blue & black plastic anthromorphic toy raccoon looked around the room it was in. 7 weeks had passed & the toy raccoon settled into its new existence. Actually liking being a living toy raccoon. It figured out a few things too. It didn&#39;t eat or drink. Nor did it get tired. Obviously it didn&#39;t go to the bathroom because it had no parts to do so. So it didn&#39;t even mind being uncovered (nude) because it was NULL. It had no clue what powered it. The toy also by using the family laptop learned that was no such person as Adam Miths anymore. This 5 years old French girl named Sophie had a very powerful fruit power. Not only could she turn people into living toys but also reality would be altered so said person was never a human at all. The toy raccoon had actually been delighted to learn that. That meant no one was missing it because the human Adam Miths that it used to be had now never existed. <br />
It was 3:26 am on a Sunday morning. The anthromorphic blue & black plastic raccoon toy was sitting on the couch watching TV in the dark; bored as hell. The toy had (again) failed to find anything interesting to watch. Also it was too short to reach the light switch to the room (any room). The toy didn&#39;t want to be On but Sophie again left it On while she went to bed. She had been forgetting to turn the toy raccoon off every night for nearly 2 weeks now. And the poor toy toy raccoon couldn&#39;t turn itself off because it can&#39;t touch it&#39;s own back. It couldn&#39;t quite get it&#39;s hands back there. Which means it can&#39;t press down it&#39;s the square on it&#39;s back which it&#39;s power button. The father of Sophie named Matt came home & saw the TV on. Matt yet again walked over, picked the toy raccoon up & pressed it&#39;s power button. The toy raccoon let out low happy mechanical chitter of happiness as it went limp & everything went dark for it. The toy raccoon was again glad he turned it off. Matt carried the now turned off toy raccoon to his daughter&#39;s room & put it on the floor in a corner. He then left the room thinking yet again frustrated that Sophie yet again had left the toy raccoon on. And wondered again for a minute when & where did he get the toy raccoon. <br />
A year passed & the toy raccoon had finally learned French. Though the toy was still physically incapable speaking it; well any language really. The toy raccoon figured out only Sophie remembered it as human. And Sophie had learned more about her powers. She could turn herself into a living plastic toy animal too; & it worked just like it did with the toy raccoon. But Sophie could reverse it on herself & actually on others. Well not on the toy raccoon actually. Turns out after a month the transformation into a toy becomes permanent. The toy raccoon didn&#39;t care. He loved being a toy. So they when they neared the local playground with Sophie&#39;s father & saw many kids playing. Sophie placed a hand on her chest & stated &quot;Rabbit toy.&quot; There was a poof & Sophie was gone. Now stood a 1 & half tall pink & white rabbit plastic anthromorphic toy with 3 toed paws & 4 digited hands. And nude of course; which was ok since it was NULL like all living plastic animal toys. Matt walked pass the playground leaving the now two toys behind. Matt again couldn&#39;t figure out why he got two living plastic anthromorphic animal toys. He didn&#39;t have any kids. So why he have these toys? Only the toy raccoon could remember Sophie now. Also strangely only the pink toy rabbit could make human vocalizations; speak in human. The toy raccoon guessed all that was unique to her being the fruit user.  The 2 animal toys entered the playground & approached a group of kids. Theo a 6 years old boy begged  &quot;Please toy bunny make me toy lizard again.&quot; The pink rabbit placed a hand on Theo&#39;s chest asking &quot;You want to not be Theo again?&quot; &quot;Yes. Make me not Theo again.&quot; &quot;Yellow lizard toy.&quot; The pink plastic rabbit stated. As the poof occurred & Theo was gone. Now stood a yellow anthromorphic plastic 1 & half tall lizard..<br />
(Author note here. All living plastic anthromorphic toy animals will be nude & NULL. I won&#39;t keep stating it). <br />
The yellow lizard toy made a lizard mechanical vocalization & the pink plastic toy rabbit told him &quot;Have fun.&quot; The toy raccoon didn&#39;t remember Theo anymore. He didn&#39;t even know anything had happened. No one but Sophie & Theo himself knew now. Infact the toy raccoon didn&#39;t remember anyone Sophie transformed into a toy animal as anything but that while they are. No one did but Sophie & the toy themself. Soon kid came up to the pink plastic rabbit. This kid was a 4 years old girl. &quot;Pink bunny toy make me animal toy too.&quot; &quot;Ok.&quot; The pink rabbit toy had told all the kids at the playground about her power.<br />
 And had made them all animal plastic toys at time or another. But the pink rabbit toy didn&#39;t know this girl. The pink toy rabbit placed a hand on the girl chest. &quot;Make me a orange ferret toy&quot; The pink rabbit toy started &quot;orange ferret toy.&quot; There was a poof & the girl was gone. Now there was a 1 and a half tall orange anthromorphic plastic ferret toy. The ferret toy looked itself over & made a mechanical animal vocalization in joy. &quot;So let&#39;s play.&quot; The pink rabbit toy announced.</p>
