<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>There really should be a &quot;dollification&quot; tag. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Christ.” Dan grumbled, looking at the option. “You know I don’t watch any of that ahni-may stuff.”<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t matter; we do.” Liam laughed. “I wanna turn you into something cute and niche that we like. Plus, only fair on Adam.” <br />
<br />
Adam squeaked in agreement, taking control of the keyboard for himself. He had to dive and lean to hit the required keys, his numbs bouncing around as he typed his list of preferences, expanding on all of his interests. To Dan, of course, all the names might as well be in their original Japanese, especially with the additional notes. It was a confusing mess of memes, Dan often detecting a dark tone to it all.<br />
<br />
Dan recoiled at the final note, recognising something through the veil of weebery.<br />
<br />
“The fuck do you mean ‘one for the jar’?” <br />
<br />
His friends laughed in unison, Liam clasping his back.<br />
<br />
“You will find out. Anyway, I like the idea of Ryuko.” Liam said, navigating through the list of names. “Or Elma. Do you want a cool haircut or a dragon tail?” Dan just raised a brow, like they even compared. “Alright, Elma it is.” He chuckled, hitting commit.<br />
<br />
“ACTIVATE: ENGAGE. COOLDOWN SET TO. Forty. Five. HOURS. CONTROL REINSTATED ON. Thir-teen. Oh-one. Sun-day. STANDBY.”<br />
<br />
Dizziness hit Dan like a slap to the head and a punch to the gut, air leaving his lungs, hand grasping into the sofa. It was all one fluid motion, the device firing a blast of transformative energy so strong that physically threw Dan back, his fingers raked along the fabric. The world expanded around him, the miniaturized version of Dan landing nude in his own clothes, as the real changes began.<br />
<br />
A heavy feeling hit the core of his body, solid, like a clump of something tricking outwards, fusing whatever it touched and stealing his willpower. His lips tried to form words, but the sensation raced up his spine, mouth expanding until it was glued together, causing his head to expand. He tried to grasp at it, hands finding his head covered in something rubbery and smooth, his vision distorting as it adjusted to it&#39;s new seeing organs.<br />
<br />
The force was irresistible, not that he wanted to. The expanding concretions of high-quality plastic tingled upon contact, begging to be touched, to be played with, his hand  leaving him with a low and almost sexual hum of pleasure. Meanwhile something new was emerging from the storm of emotions, a kind of disappointment, begging him to finish the transformation out there, where he could be seen. Being in there, in the darkness filled him with a fear so profound it obscured the sensation of the transformation.<br />
<br />
“You are so small now.” It said. “You could easily be forgotten.”<br />
<br />
As the hardness consumed him, freezing his body in place, warping it femenine, the need to be seen exploded, like the darkness was a vast ocean he was sinking into. Dan began pulling through it, but the rubbery plastic covering his limbs stiffened him, slowing him, and then his fingers began to freeze into paddle-like lumps. This was it, he thought, I was gone, transformed and disposed of, a sculpture they could come back to when they wanted. How could they do this? How could they…<br />
<br />
The first ball joint popped into place on his wrist. It sill ended in a frozen panel of a hand, but it was much more flexible than his old joint, and - with a pop, it was soon joined with a second at his elbow. More pops flowed out, and soon his rigid form began scrambling again, thrashing against the fabric, until they settled, leaving him as a hyper-articulate.<br />
<br />
Dan paused, moving his hands over the soft plastings of his body, lingering over the molded breasts on his chest, before moving on to one of the ball joints. It made his head spin, trying to comprehend it, the fear of obscurity rising again, until his body put an end to it. <br />
<br />
First a corn curled it&#39;s way onto his head, amplifying the spin into tumbling vertigo, on the end of unconsciousness. Then the tail curled out of his back, knocking him out completely.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Plushie Adam was the next one to greet Dan, finding him in the amber glow of his former shirt. He took the outstretched nubby paw with his hand, rising to his feet. <br />
<br />
Dan was lightly dressed, femenine curves covered in a revealing black swimsuit-esque-anime-thing, interrupted by prominent ball joints. The one exception was the draconic tail coming from his back, covered in aquatic blue scales, articulated by something more rigid hiding beneath the surface. He gave it a gratifying swish, following his best friend out.<br />
<br />
Liam and Siya loomed large, their stares both satisfying and terrifying, momentarily freezing Dan to the spot. Dan, now about ten centimeters tall, and even Adam was twice his height. Blushing, he moved behind the plush, only tio be met by a ripple of laughter.<br />
<br />
Siya picked the two of them up, and once again the sensation caused Dan to freeze, only now it was tinged with something else. Less freeze, it was more like they lost control, able to feel the tingle of their plasticated flesh, but unable to act. When Siya’s lips kissed him his head began to swim with liquid joy, the smile freezing on his face.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Liam said, “don’t maul him, let me…” Liam’s hands were harder, his stare more hungry. While Dan remained imobile the smile quickly dissolved. “Wow, I’ve never seen a doll like this, look at how articulate it is.” He moved Dan all over, bending him to his extremes, twisting his ball joints back and forth. Dan, in response, felt vulnerable; weak and small and prone to breaking, but while the image horrified him it also did something else.<br />
<br />
At once, his loins and breast-tips began to glow.<br />
<br />
“Okay, so, the way I see it we can either take turns with each of the, or, well, I keep one, you keep the other. And you were always more into Dragon Maid.”<br />
<br />
Liam proffered Dan’s now twisted frame, pointing it at Adam. Adam, in return, looked on with horror.</p>
