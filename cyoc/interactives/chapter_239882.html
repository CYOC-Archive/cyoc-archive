<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The six jiggling breasts, the ready to burst balloon that his stomach had turned into, the tail nervously twitching in a specially made hole in his seat, and the utter stench of skunk that permeated the air all told Steve one thing – if he had any doubt that he was the pregnant skunk girl that he’d seen earlier, the sensations coming from his new body washed them away.<br />
<br />
He tried to take slow, deep breaths as he recovered from the experience of transforming from a man into an overly gravid anthro skunk in just a few seconds.  The breathing helped as much as it could, but nothing could wash away the terror of being stuck in this body.  <br />
<br />
Why had this happened to him?  The phone had said it would change 14 people.  There were 14 people in the center.  He wasn’t in the center, so he should have been immune to it.  Did he make some mistake in the logic or misread something?<br />
<br />
Steve brought the phone back into view.  He still had 1% battery left, so hope wasn’t totally lost, but he needed to figure out why this had happened to him if he wanted to avoid succumbing to something even worse.  Looking at the sentence on the screen, Steve saw:<br />
<br />
“The pregnant anthro bitch is laboring in the slave birthing center.”<br />
<br />
That didn’t really tell him anything about what had happened… <br />
<br />
Steve’s heart skipped a beat.  He’d gotten caught up on the fact that the battery warning had said it would change 14 targets, but Steve had neglected to consider the most important word in the warning – “other”.  It had said 14 *other* targets.  <br />
<br />
Steve had assumed that because he was changing the community center that the community center itself was the target, but it wasn’t.  Steve had selected Austin when he made the change.  That meant that Austin was the target, and that Steve was one of the 14 other targets.<br />
<br />
Tears soaked into the fur below Steve’s eye as he began to cry.  How could he have been so careless?  He knew how dangerous this app was.  Hell, it had even tried to warn him by giving him a whiff of the body he was now trapped in, but he’d just ignored it.<br />
<br />
“Fuck! Fuck!  Fuck!”  Steve cried in a girly voice as he banged his hands into the side of the steering wheel.  <br />
<br />
Despite the water still filling Steve’s eyes, he felt his will suddenly steel itself with the realization that the phone still had power.  He can still fix this!  Selecting himself, Steve  to generated a new sentence, only to encounter a new warning:<br />
<br />
<br />
“Low battery mode: Final changes are finishing.  Newly generated changes will only complete after prior reality shifts are finished.”<br />
<br />
Steve clicked through it as fast as he could.  He didn’t have the battery to play around with this thing, and it didn’t matter if his next change took a bit longer.  He had to get it into the queue and hope that the phone had enough battery left to execute the change.<br />
<br />
But what was that still pending change that the phone has mentioned?  No!  Steve told himself, it doesn’t matter!<br />
<br />
Steve hit the generate sentence button again and watched as the words appeared on the screen.<br />
<br />
“The”<br />
<br />
“Dumb”<br />
<br />
“Skunk”<br />
<br />
“Birthing”<br />
<br />
Steve’s eyes were forced shut as it felt like his head was thrust into a vice, only for the pressure inside of his skull to vanish just as quickly as it had entered.  When he opened his eyes back up, what he saw made no sense.  On the phone’s screen there was nothing but… scribbles?<br />
<br />
It wasn’t just the sentence that he had generated.  Anywhere that Steve expected there to be text – even the battery percentage number next to the visual indicator – all he saw was non-sensical lines and dashes.<br />
<br />
Dumb skunk.  Those words echoed in Steve’s head.  Was he really… could the app really?  He tried focusing as hard as he could, but no matter how hard he tried or how much he tried to connect the scribbles that he was looking at into actual letters, he just couldn’t make sense of anything on the screen.<br />
<br />
Bringing it back into view, he saw that there was still the tiniest black line of power showing in the battery indicator.  He tried to see how long it was until he could generate another new sentence, but the shifting lines where he expected the timer to be just looked like the same nonsense as everything else.  Dread welled up inside of Steve’s body as he felt a return of that distinctly feminine urge to cry from earlier.<br />
<br />
“No!” came the same girly voice as before as Steve gave into at least some of his instincts and tossed the phone into the back seat.  It was stupid, he knew, but for some reason his body seemed to think that if he couldn’t see the phone anymore then that would somehow make his apparent illiteracy go away.<br />
<br />
Wrapping his arms around his massive belly, Steve was greeted by the distinct feeling of fur on fur.  Oh no, he realized, his keys and wallet had been in his pockets, but now he wasn’t wearing any clothes.  In a panic he began feeling around the seat on either side of him, hoping that they had just fallen out, until his eyes spotted a glimmer from the cupholder.  Steve was able to breath a sigh of relief as he the keys and wallet sitting inside – a small amount of mercy bestowed upon him by the otherwise heartless app.<br />
<br />
“Birthing”<br />
<br />
That was the last word he’d managed to read before… before he’d tossed the phone into the back seat.  Steve’s mind was drawn back to the agonized sounds that he’d the skunk girl making earlier.  His body was… he was… a birthing slave.  A skunk birthing slave.  And if the immense pressure in his belly was any indication, he was due any day now.<br />
<br />
“Oh god…” he muttered, fully expecting that his water was going to break any second.  He was so wacked on painkillers when his water had broken earlier that he’d barely even noticed it, so what would it be like this time?  Would it be painful?  And what about the process itself – there was so much pressure inside of him that he could imagine a jet of high-pressure water shooting out of his vagina as his clenching womb turned it into a firehose.<br />
<br />
Steve opened the door and swung his legs onto the ground outside.  However bad his situation was now, he didn’t need for it to get any worse by unwillingly unleashing a torrent of fluid inside of the car.  He tried to heave the rest of his body out, but his belly was so much larger than it had been when he’d been a rabbit.  On top of that, he now had six milky breasts instead of two.  <br />
<br />
All of that additional weight threw his center of balance way too far off and Steve was forced to plop back down into his seat to avoid the alternative, which was to plant his face into the ground.  The impact between leather and skunk butt caused a ripple of force through his body, painfully jiggling his swollen breasts and belly.  <br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Steve waited for the jiggling to subside before slowly pushing himself towards the edge of the seat.  Then, holding the car’s frame for support, he slowly lowered himself to his knees.  Once there, it was a simple matter to just drop forward on his hands, leaving him in a sustainable yet humiliating position with his tail raised and his… his… <br />
<br />
Ordinarily, Steve would be humiliated to be in a position where someone standing behind him would get a full view of his tight asshole, but that concern was a far cry from the thought that Steve was trying to prevent from racing through his mind right now.  <br />
<br />
The cold evening air wafted over a pair of tight lips that sat just below Steve’s asshole.  He didn’t want to think about it, much less to admit it, but someone standing behind him wouldn’t just get a look at his asshole – they’d also get a look at the moist pussy that defined his new body’s existence.  <br />
<br />
While Steve reminded himself that mentally he was still a human male, none of that changed the fact that he was in the body of a female birthing slave.  His body’s only value, at least to its owner, was the womb occupying his belly.  If Steve’s owner could remove that womb they would, but doing so wasn’t possible and so the rest of Steve’s body, including his brain, was stuck coming along for the ride.  As far as the app was concerned, Steve was little more than an unwilling prisoner who was forced to watch as his cunt was turned into a portal through which sperm would be deposited into him and from which new life would agonizingly be forced out.<br />
<br />
Crawling a few feet away from the car, Steve turned to face the birthing center’s open door.  The center’s door wasn’t far away, and the image of an overly gravid skunk popped into his mind.  She was laying on a birthing bed, legs spread as they rested on holders specifically designed for that purpose.  The table was holding her upper body at a 45 degree angle while her hands were cupped underneath her overside belly in a pitiful offer of support.<br />
<br />
The skunk grit her teeth and…</p>
