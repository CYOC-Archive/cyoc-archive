<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Tagged M/F for foreplay</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rob walked out of his last class for the day, and it didn&#39;t take long for him to find Amy waiting for him in the hallway.  She smiled at him and said, &quot;Going my way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Rob as he approached her.  &quot;Want to head to my place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; Amy responded as she spun and walked in the same direction as him.  Amy and Rob walked out the door of the school, and Rob noticed his sister Rachel walking off with a familiar red headed girl.  He waved his hand at Rachel, but she didn&#39;t notice him. He shrugged as he and Amy continued the way down to his home.  The two walked in silence with Amy walking slightly ahead of Rob.  Rob&#39;s eyes were staring at Amy&#39;s butt as it swayed while Amy walked.  Amy suddenly turned around and said, &quot;Caught you staring!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rob averted his eyes as he stammered, &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy giggled and said, &quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot;  She turned back around and said, &quot;You can look aaaaaaall you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rob&#39;s face flushed red as he tried to avoid looking and continued to walk forward.  &quot;Can I ask you something?&quot; Rob asked breaking the silence.  &quot;I mean, is everyone at the school this...well...horny?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy turned around and grinned before answering, &quot;Well, in a sense, yeah.  At least as far as weres are concerned.  I mean, from the first time we change, there&#39;s this...horniness in all of us.&quot;  Rob&#39;s eyebrow perked up.  &quot;I mean, it&#39;s really unlikely you&#39;ll find a virgin were.  My mom says that it&#39;s a part of being a were.  The drive to  reproduce and all that.  And most of the adults here are pretty chill about it too.  They seem to understand what it&#39;s like being a teenager.  My mom likes to put it as asking a teenage were not to have sex is like asking a wolf not to eat meat.  It&#39;s a big part of our nature.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I see,&quot; Rob said with a bit of a stammer.  Rob looked away from Amy as if not sure what to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is everything okay?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, it&#39;s just that...well...&quot; Rob stammered, &quot;To be honest, I don&#39;t got a lot of experience...in this sort of stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...AH!&quot; Amy said with a little bit of a grin, &quot;So, you&#39;ve never really been around girls, have you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rob looked down sheepishly as he said, &quot;Well, outside of Rachel and mom, no.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy&#39;s grin grew bigger as she looked at him and said, &quot;Well, today&#39;s your lucky day!  I can teach you all about girls.  Want to have your first lesson?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...um...&quot; Rob stammered as he wasn&#39;t sure how to answer, &quot;I...uh...don&#39;t know.  Will it...you know...make me a were or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, unless you want to,&quot; Amy answered.  &quot;There are things I can teach you, but you can still be a normal.  Do you trust me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I guess...&quot; Rob said rather quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; Amy said, &quot;We can have your first lesson here.&quot;  She spread her arms wide and then pointed to her breasts.  While small compared to the other girls in Moon Lake, Amy&#39;s breasts were still quite sizable compared to the other girls he&#39;s known.  &quot;These are breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that,&quot; Rob said.<br />
<br />
Amy giggled and said, &quot;Just making sure.&quot;  She walked up close to him and said, &quot;Do you want to feel them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Rob said as he looked at her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Amy said, &quot;I&#39;m giving you permission.  Go ahead.   Have a feel.&quot;  Rob slowly moved his hand up and took a feel of Amy&#39;s breasts.  He noticed how soft they were, but at the same time, they didn&#39;t move much when he rubbed them.  Amy smiled as she felt Rob&#39;s hand and then he whispered into his ear, &quot;And if you rub them the right way, you can really make me feel good.&quot;  As she said this, she took his hand in hers and started to move his hand around.  &quot;Like this...&quot; Amy said as she guided his fingers over her nipples.  Rob could feel her nipple growing in his hand as Amy guided him.  &quot;Oh...&quot; Amy moaned, &quot;Like that...&quot;  Rob noticed a change in Amy&#39;s eyes as her face flushed red.  This flush went down her neck and into her chest.  Amy let Rob&#39;s hand go as Rob continued to massage her breasts.  He could feel her nipples fully extended, and he could see them poking out of her shirt.  He gave one of them a slight pinch which caused Amy to give out a squeek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Rob said as he let go.  &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-it&#39;s okay,&quot; Amy stuttered as she tried to compose herself.  As Amy tried to cool herself down, Rob couldn&#39;t help but notice that look in her eye didn&#39;t seem to go away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we should keep going,&quot; Rob said as he continued to walk, this time in front of Amy.  He looked back at Amy, and it appeared to him that she finally calmed down.  But when she looked at him, Rob couldn&#39;t help but notice that there was this look in her eye.  She was definitely looking at him a bit differently.<br />
<br />
The two walked to the Van Direstag house, and Rob noticed that the van was gone.  He walked inside and noted how quiet it was.  He took a quick look upstairs and noticed Frank at his desk.  &quot;Where&#39;s mom and dad?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, they had errands to run,&quot; Frank said.  &quot;They should be back later this afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Rob responded.  Rob turned and pointed to Amy and said, &quot;This is Amy.&quot;  Amy waved to Frank while Frank waved back.  Before Rob could say anything, Amy whispered something in his ear.  Rob nodded and said, &quot;We&#39;ll be outside for a bit.  We&#39;ll come back when mom and dad get home.&quot;  Frank nodded as he turned back to his work.  Rob went to his room and put his bookbag down.  Amy took hers off and placed it next to Rob&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Amy said as she pulled on Rob&#39;s hand.  &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah,&quot; Rob said as he felt Amy pulling on his arm down the stairs.  &quot;What gives?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see,&quot; Amy said as she led Rob down the stairs and into the woods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Amy?&quot; Rob asked as soon as the two of them were in the woods.  &quot;What gives?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy didn&#39;t say anything as she just stood there silently.  She then turned around and Rob noticed that the look in her eyes was still there.  A grin formed on her face as she slowly walked up to Rob and asked, &quot;Are you ready for your second lesson?&quot;</p>
