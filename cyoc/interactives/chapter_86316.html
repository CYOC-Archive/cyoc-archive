<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The kids continue to play video games after the clowns leave and the fathers whisper in the back. Patrick watches as everyone regains their color. He goes to the bathroom again and looks at his reflection and sees that he is back to normal too. He fishes the nose out from his pocket weighing it in his hand, should he put it back on and what would happen? Would he start to change into a clown again? Would it stop? Could he change back? His heart beating hard in his chest Patrick slips the clown nose back on feeling a tingle as it settles on his nose. He stared at his reflection his skin tingling in excitement as he thinks he sees his skin lighten. He takes the nose of and watches, hoping his skin goes back to normal which it does. He leaves the bathroom and rejoins the group trying to keep his mind on the video games but it keeps drifting back to the clown nose and the possibilities. His mom finally arrives to pick him up and she does the normal questions, have fun? Did you thank him? etc...... Patrick mumbled some answers.<br />
&quot;A clown?&quot; she asks and Patrick is snapped back to reality and realizes she asked about the entertainment to which he answered a clown came.<br />
&quot;I bet you liked that.&quot; smiled his mom<br />
&quot;No, it was lame.&quot; Patrick blurts out the standard 12 year old answer his face turning red.<br />
&quot;Sure it was&quot; his mom replied sarcastically knowing his fascination with clowns.<br />
Finally they arrive home and Patrick escapes to his room and closes the door. He stands in front of the mirror the clown nose in hand. Should he? He carefully slips the nose on and feels the delightful tingle. He watches as his skin grows paler, was it happening faster? His lips did not pale but actually grew redder, he smiled. His hair starts to curl as he watches it. &#39;Wow, it is actually happening.&#39; he thinks. He notices he is still smiling and tries to stop but can&#39;t. Tingles rush over his skin and his scalp and he laughs. He continues to laugh his heart pounding as changes happen to him as he collapses on the floor giggling. He suddenly gets scared and rips off the nose and lays there laughing watching the changes ever slowly revert back. He stops laughing and hears his mom call him down to dinner. He jumps up and examines his reflection, did he look normal? He can’t let his parents see him looking like a clown. His hair was back straight, his lips were the normal color but his skin still was a little pale. Why was it taking longer to go back to normal?<br />
&quot;PATRICK&quot; his dad called from downstairs. He had no choice but to go downstairs and hope they didn’t notice.<br />
&quot;Yea, ok. Let me wash my hands.&quot; Something he doesn&#39;t normally do but it will buy some time. He washed his hands as slowly as possible while willing his color to come back in his skin, making enough noise to be heard in the dining room. He slowly walks down the hall into the dining room with his head down and sits down.<br />
&quot;You okay, sweetie&quot; his mom says and he feels a hand on his forehead. His heart races, she noticed.<br />
&quot;yea, just fell asleep&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, you just look a little pale&quot; Dinner goes normally and he tells them about the party leaving out the clown bit which probably made it more obvious.<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you go to bed early, I think the party tired you out?&quot; Patrick tries to hide his excitement at the idea.<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m ok. I want to watch some TV.&quot; <br />
You do look better are you sure?&quot; After some back and forth Patrick gives in and slips off to his room and closes the door. Patrick stares at the clown nose on the floor by the mirror. He was excited and terrify at the changes. He felt so silly when he was turning into a clown and he could change back. But what happens if he is caught by his parents or friends? The temptation is too much for Patrick as he reaches for the clown nose and puts it on. He sighs as he feels the now familiar tingles run over his body. He stares at his arm as it slowly lightens. He smiles and runs his fingers through his hair and feels it curl around them. He pulls it straight and feels it bounce back into an afro. Laughing he looks into the mirror and sees his hair turn rainbow colors. The changes were happening faster this time as he feels the tingles run over his body. He continues to laugh as he feels the tingles run over his face. His pale skin is approaching white and he feels to spots of blush form on his cheeks. He feels so funny and free. His feet start to tingle and hurt; he looks at his feet in surprise. Bending down and taking off his shoes his feet explode outward and Patrick falls back in surprise. He looks forward at his feet now size 20. Suddenly he hears somebody walking down the hall and he covers his mouth to try and stop laughing. Jumping up he trips into his bed pulls off the clown nose and pulls the cover over his head. He hears the door open as his father looks in on him before the light goes out. He lets out a laugh as the coast is clear and reaches down and massages his feet marveling at the feeling and their size. The silly feeling is still with him as he sits up and spies his socks rolled up on the floor, reaching down he grabs them and starts to juggle. He gets up and slowly waddles his way over to the mirror getting use to his large feet. His lips are red and turned upward in a large smile and there are two spots of red on his cheeks standing out against his pale skin. His hair was a rainbow colored curly afro. Sadly he sees the changes slowly start to fade, his hair lightens and straightens out, his feet shrink down to normal and his skin regains its color. The only thing that remains is the smile on his face at the delight of being a clown. He lays down in bed and dreams of clowning around.</p>
