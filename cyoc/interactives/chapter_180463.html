<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I must say we didn&#39;t exactly expect someone of your stature to come to Animalia,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke as he lead the woman that trailed him the main waiting area toward the conversion room set aside for her.<br />
<br />
The woman appeared slightly older, like she would be in her mid to late forties with a formal blue suit jacket and skirt with a white shirt. Her hair was done back in a pony tail, though when she turned her head, Doctor Stein had been able to note that the clip that held her hair back was a gold colored piece of jewelry that actually looked like a a sitting fox looking to one side. Her paperwork had come in and was cleared, as Madame Juliet Renard-Argenté was off good standing and had no criminal record, either in the US or in France, her home and country of origin. The searches also found that the woman had connections to one of France&#39;s noble houses, though Doctor Stein didn&#39;t keep up to date on that, and given that France had been under some form of republican government since the Franco-Prussian War, he didn&#39;t find that all that relative.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things have been busy,&quot; Juliet said with a heavy French accent and grateful that the American scientist was open enough to admit he didn&#39;t know much French and chose not to butcher her language, &quot;but your company and Horizon has had many opportunities... ones which I had to put on hold over the past four years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein chose to stay off the subject and simply continued to lead the woman on as she continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;But the opportunity is still there, and I have exchanged correspondence with those that have converted and have looked to sponsor Animalian colonies in their countries,&quot; Juliet continued, &quot;and that may help with those under my care and with the vineyards in the area.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve read that you help those that have had various learning disorders,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and they would also be part of the idea for a future colony in France,&quot; Juliet answered, &quot;but given your rules and the fact that just because they have difficulties learning that doesn&#39;t mean they cannot make their own decisions. It&#39;s thus taken time to explain what I would hope would be something that would help them... and then came the pandemic. Now, as things are getting better and we have all our things in order, I have come to convert and see to the steps needed for the establishment of a colony. The ones in my care will be reborn and have every opportunity to succeed and will also have a home if they do not wish to leave... My conversion would be the assurance to them that they would not be harmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And thus a Silver Fox,&quot; Doctor Stein said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the color variants of the Red Fox,&quot; Juliet answered, &quot;and fitting my family name. As Renard is fox and Argenté is silver.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Doctor Stein said slowly.<br />
<br />
With that he opened the door and allowed Juliet to move in and sit down calmly on the bed. Juliet sat down calmly and removed her shoes, revealing to Doctor Stein that she wasn&#39;t wearing socks while he was readying the needles for the conversion.  He looked to her and gave a weak frown before motioning to his sleeves. Juliet soon caught on to what he meant and then undid the one button on her suit jacket and removed it. Doing so then revealed a white long sleeved button down shirt, which Juliet soon undid as well. A slight blush formed as she had to expose part of her bra in order to free up her shoulder for the injections. Doctor Stein paid it no mind, and handled the injections with the same decorum he&#39;d always had, and Juliet did not flinch as each shot was delivered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Animalia,&quot; Doctor Stein said politely and then made his way out. <br />
<br />
Juliet watched as he shut the door behind him. She couldn&#39;t see it, but her pupils began to stretch vertically from the round dots that human pupils were. Her eyes retained their Human color, which tended to be the case with all converted Humans, but her pupils still took on the vertical slit shape that the Red Fox naturally had. However, at the same time she was beginning to feel warm and she noted that her fur was starting grow in and her growing fur didn&#39;t match the normal colors that the Red Fox had. As her breasts began to swell larger to fill the cups of her bra and her skin tightened on her face, silver white fur began to blossom out on her chest and body. The fur on her arms and legs was darker and closer to a black color.<br />
<br />
She raised one hand to see small and stubby claws begin to push from her fingertips and smiled slightly. Black fur was growing out on her face, and as her face also began to push forward into a long and narrow muzzle. As it pushed forward, Juliet ran her tongue along her teeth, which also grew sharper and more pointed. Her nose became a wet black triangle at the front of her growing muzzle, and at the same time her ears stretched up into black furred triangular points that poked through her Human hair that had regained its full color. It was once again a full chocolate brown with no signs of gray, in contrast to her largely silver fur. As her ears stretched up, Juliet also soon found herself able to move her ears. She found herself giving an almost happy &quot;yip&quot; at that.<br />
<br />
The transformation was progressing and with no real pain. Since she was not wearing socks or stockings, her feet had nothing to restrain them as they lengthened out into digitigrade paws with short claws on each toe. The bones in her feet gave off some crackling sound as they lengthened, but there was no pain. At worst it sort of felt like an odd tickle. The only place where things were a bit uncomfortable was on her chest, where her bra was struggling to contain and support her enlarging bosom. Her hips had flared out as well, and as she shakily got onto her feet, a long silver/black furred tail bloomed out behind her. Her skirt fit fairly well with things, as she&#39;d actually arranged for attire that would fit an Animalian before coming in, and while it might have made her outerwear look a little bit big on her as a Human, she was now growing into it. However, she couldn&#39;t do the same with her bra, as she&#39;d actually been rather flat chested as a Human, and now her bosom was swelling larger with each breath she took. They&#39;d begun to overflow her bra and the straps were now painfully digging into her shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Best to get this off,&quot; Juliet said to herself, while figuring she would be able to gain a new bra that would fit the new her and reached back behind her with her paws. The clasps came free, and while she also had to pull down the other side of her shirt, it was ultimately worth it to get the now way too small bra off and let her growing breasts bounce free. As the did so, dark nipples poked through the silver fur on her breasts, flicking a few droplets of milk out as her growing breasts bounced freely. Juliet answered that with another happy yip, swished her newly grown tail behind her and dropped her Human bra to the floor, as she was now too big for it. &quot;And this does feel good... and will hopefully give the others reason for a better future.&quot;</p>
