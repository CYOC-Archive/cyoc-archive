<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once they were in Mrs. Goldwin's office she had the three of them sit down while she went to call Ron's parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe that I'm a girl&quot; Ron aid sobbing a little.<br />
<br />
You feel a little sorry for him. You were a little stunned when you had been transformed into a female but you had kind of expected it when you read the 'woman of your caliber' part on your letter and when they asked if you were the new girl. Ron on the other hand didn't know what his bullying would get him. You don't know why he had become a bully and you are worried that his emotions might overwhelm him. That could cause a problem since he could lash out at Clarence even worse than he had, or anybody else.<br />
<br />
When Mrs. Goldwin came back in Ron said &quot;Mrs. Goldwin, I think I need to use the restroom. May I go to the restroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you may&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said. &quot;Claire, would you go with him or her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing Mrs. Goldwin&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you two to go and come right back&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said. &quot;Ron's parents will be here in a little bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
You and Ron leave Mrs. Goldwin's office and head to the restroom. As you pass by the boy's restroom Ron starts going in. You grab his/her arm and ask &quot;Why are you going into the boy's restroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I always go into the boy's restroom as I'm a boy&quot; Ron said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You better take another look at yourself&quot; you say. &quot;You're no longer a boy, you are a girl now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I forgot about that&quot; Ron said sobbing again.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright&quot; you say hugging Ron, &quot;I guess that it would be an easy mistake to make when you've been one gender all your life and you suddenly find yourself as the opposite gender.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did I become a girl though?&quot; Ron asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's probably a lesson for you&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it because I called Clarence 'Claire' and said let's see your panties?&quot; Ron asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That could be though I don't know&quot; you say. You had considered telling Ron that you had made it happen but that would mean revealing that you're a genie to him/her and you can only reveal yourself to those your master says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess I should try to get used to being a girl&quot; Ron said. &quot;I guess I'll have to have a new name as well. I've always liked the name Lisa. Do you think that would be a good name for me Claire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it's a lovely name&quot; you say. &quot;If that's what you want to be known as, that's your decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do want to be known as Lisa until this is reversed&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
As you enter the girl's restroom you can't help but think that the transformation won't be reversed. Lisa will be female for the rest of her life. You don't say anything though since the hope of one day becoming male again should keep her sane. Hopefully she'll get used to being female before she realizes that she won't be changing back to a male.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok what do I do?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;With your skirt you can just pull it up and pull down your panties&quot; you say. &quot;Remember you have to sit to pee now and don't forget to wipe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I have to wipe if I'm only peeing?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because if you don't you could get an infection down there&quot; you say. &quot;From what I know it's not a pleasant infection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I better remember to wipe then&quot; Lisa said giggling a little bit.<br />
<br />
'Good' you think, 'she's starting to adjust to being female. This may turn out alright after all.'<br />
<br />
Both of you use the restroom and while you were both washing your hands Lisa said &quot;I have some black marks on my face.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look and sure enough she does. &quot;Looks like your mascara ran&quot; you say. &quot;It must not be water proof. Don't worry, it's easily fixed. You should have all your make up in your purse so we just need to clean the streaks off and reapply your eye shadow and blush.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I clean this up?&quot; Lisa asked. &quot;Also how do I apply make up? I've never done it before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll help you&quot; you say. &quot;First let's see what you have in your purse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa starts taking things out of her purse. She pulled out her lipstick, eye shadow, mascara, blush, and various feminine things. &quot;What is this?&quot; she asked holding up a small pink square.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a feminine napkin&quot; you say, &quot;other wise known as a pad. It's for your period when you have it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to have a period today?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn't mean that you'll have your period today&quot; you say. &quot;It could be a couple weeks from now. Most girls keep either a pad or tampon in their purse just in case they start their period while they're away from home. Sometimes they have to use them, sometimes they don't. When they don't they often forget about them. I've been guilty of doing just that myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I know when I have my period?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you'll start getting cramps in your stomach&quot; you say. &quot;After that you'll more than likely notice a spot of blood in your panties. There are other ways to tell but being new at being a girl, you don't know what's normal for you yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are these other ways?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there is PMS&quot; you say. &quot;That includes bloating and mood swings. Like I said, you don't know what's normal for you so you won't know if you're having PMS or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright thanks Claire&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Well this is all I have in my purse.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look over what was in Lisa's purse. You were looking for some cleansing cloths but there were none. You open your purse and take out one of your cleansing cloths. &quot;Here&quot; you say, &quot;get this wet and then wash your face.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Lisa said. She took the cloth and started washing her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your doing good&quot; you say watching her and you decide that you should do the same so she can watch you clean off your makeup and reapply it.<br />
<br />
After your faces are cleaned Lisa asks &quot;What's next?&quot;<br />
<br />
You show Lisa how to apply makeup and she learns quick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that wasn't too hard&quot; Lisa said after applying her makeup. &quot;What happens if my mascara runs again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as you don't cry again it should be fine&quot; you say. &quot;If you do cry again then you'll have to clean up and reapply again. Here's a couple cleaning cloths in case your mascara runs again. Of course if you have or get water proof mascara it won't run.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks again Claire&quot; Lisa said as she took the cloths from you and put them in her purse. Her face widened in shock and she asked &quot;Oh no, what am I going to tell my parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you could tell them the truth about what happened&quot; you say. &quot;At least the truth as far as you know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that would be best&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I'll probably get grounded by my mom for the bullying but I deserve it. It was a stupid reason to bully people. Your brother was an easy target, he never stood up to me and it was too easy to make fun of his name. I'm going to tell you a little secret. I've always thought that I should have been born a girl. I've always been jealous of girls and secretly wished that I was a girl. I knew that my parents wouldn't understand so I tried to repress it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like that could be the root cause of your bullying&quot; you say. &quot;You were trying to repress it by trying to act more like a male. It manifested itself as bullying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So maybe I'll be more normal now that I'm a girl&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I know that I don't want to go back to being a boy now that I'm finally a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you come over to my house after school&quot; you say. &quot;Of course that depends on if you're grounded or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you want me over to your house?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can give you some more tips on being a girl&quot; you reply. &quot;We might also be able to figure out why this happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care why it happened&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand&quot; you say, &quot;you were so upset while you were transforming. Now you're like 'it's no big deal'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was upset at first&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I guess I was still trying to repress my desire then, I had been doing it for so long. Now that I am a girl it really is no big deal how I transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This might only be temporary&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope that it isn't&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I don't think that I'd be able to handle going back to being male.&quot;<br />
<br />
You want to tell her that it is permanent but then she'd ask how you know that. You couldn't explain without revealing that you are a genie. You'll have to ask your master about letting her know that you're a genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we should be getting back to Mrs. Goldwin's office&quot; Lisa said. &quot;My parents should be here any time now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of you leave the girl's restroom and walk back to the principal's office.<br />
<br />
Once there Lisa said &quot;I'm sorry about bullying you Clarence. I was a jerk before and I know that I don't deserve your forgiveness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I won't be forgetting what you have done but I accept your apology&quot; Clarence said. &quot;Don't expect me to forgive you anytime soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand&quot; Lisa said as she sat down.<br />
<br />
Just then Mrs. Goldwin came in with what had to be Lisa's parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to my boy?&quot; Mrs. Thompson asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I changed into a girl Mom&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are not my son&quot; Mr. Thompson said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't explain it but it is me Dad&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I assure you that this is Ron&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said. &quot;I watched him transform myself, as did Clarence and Claire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember Dan&quot; Mrs. Thompson said, &quot;I told you that Ron's clothes changed. His boxers changed into panties and his pants changed into skirts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did this happen Ron?&quot; Mr. Thompson asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not really sure&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I had been bullying Clarence for awhile and this morning when I did, I changed into a girl. By the way, as long as I'm a girl, I want my name to be Lisa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that's what you want sweetie&quot; Mrs. Thompson said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we'll have to enroll you in a different school&quot; Mr. Thompson said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to remain here&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That will be too hard on you&quot; Mrs. Thompson said. &quot;You'll be teased by the other kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I deserve it&quot; Lisa said, &quot;so I'll bear it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least you're taking responsibility&quot; Mr. Thompson said. &quot;If you want to stay, we'll respect your decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Dad&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we need to talk about your punishment for your bullying&quot; Mrs. Thompson said. &quot;I think that staying at this school and being a girl is punishment enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going to ground me?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not this time&quot; Mr. Thompson said, &quot;though I want to be clear on this. This is a special case and if you bully again, you will be grounded.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You might change your mind&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Mrs. Thompson asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have kept a secret from you&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I had always thought that I should have been born a girl. I've been so jealous of girls, wishing that I was one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you compensated for those feelings by trying to act more like a boy which led to the bullying&quot; Mr. Thompson said. &quot;Is that it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweetie&quot; Mrs. Thompson said, &quot;you could have told us what you were feeling. We would have understood and we understand now. I guess I should tell you a secret I've been keeping from you. I had dreams all the time when I was pregnant with you. In them you were always a girl, even after we found out that you were a boy. These dreams have continued to this day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You never told me that you had those dreams after we found out you were having a boy&quot; Mr. Thompson said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought that you would have told me I was being silly&quot; Mrs. Thompson said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I probably would have&quot; Mr. Thompson admitted. &quot;There's something I have to tell you. When I first found out that you were pregnant and you told me that you were sure the baby would be a girl, I wished for the baby to be a boy. I think my wish was granted but somehow you knew the baby was suppose to be a girl. It sounds like Ron, excuse me, Lisa, knew she was supposed to be a girl too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is very interesting&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have something to say&quot; Clarence said. &quot;I had made a wish that the bullies who bully me would transform into girls and that I'd be able to watch it. That's why you couldn't move us Mrs. Goldwin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know how it happened but simply wishing it didn't make it happen&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right about that Mrs. Goldwin&quot; Clarence said. &quot;My wish was granted by a real genie.&quot; He looks at you and then says &quot;She's actually Claire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Master&quot; you say. &quot;I had wanted to tell Lisa that she'll stay female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a joke right?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's no joke&quot; Clarence said. &quot;Claire really is a genie and we can prove it. Claire, can you find out if Mr. Thompson's wish was granted?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe so Master&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then do it&quot; Clarence commanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you command Master&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
You pull out your PDA out of thin air and hunt through all the files. After a few minutes you finally find something that may help.<br />
<br />
&quot;It say's that all wishes granted by a genie are recorded Master&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;A gal did come up to me claiming to be a genie&quot; Mr. Thompson said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright I'll send a request to see if a genie did grant that wish&quot; you say as you type in the request. In a few minutes the reply came back. You don't say anything but just nod your head at Mr. Thompson.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Ron, I mean Lisa&quot; Mr. Thompson said. &quot;I robbed you of your true child hood. I wish you could at least have the memories of growing up as a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard a wish&quot; a feminine voice said out of nowhere. &quot;The wish is granted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa's eyes glazed over a bit and then she said &quot;I have memories of growing up as both a boy and a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was that?&quot; Mrs. Thompson asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't heard that voice in a while&quot; Mr. Thompson said, &quot;but it was the voice of the gal who had come up to me all those years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm kind of jealous of you Lisa&quot; Clarence said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How come?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You changed into a girl&quot; Clarence said. &quot;I've always wondered what it would be like to be a girl. I wish I knew what it's like to be a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your wish is granted Master&quot; you say as you nod your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no&quot; Clarence said, &quot;I accidentally used my second wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clarence's black hair started to grow longer as his transformation started. His Adam's Apple shrank as he grabbed some of his longer hair and brought it around to look at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it looks like I'll find out what it's like to be a girl&quot; Clarence said. &quot;How long is my hair? Is it as long as Claire's?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's only down to your mid back&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
Clarence started to loose a little height as his transformation continued. &quot;Am I going to be naked like Lisa was?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your clothes should remain Master&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Clarence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You specified that you wanted to watch the transformation of the bullies in your first wish Master&quot; you say. &quot;You didn't specify if you wanted others to watch your transformation with your second wish. I am well aware that public nudity is frowned upon so when possible I will leave the person's clothes on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clarence lifted up his shirt in time to see his body hair recede into his body. &quot;This tickles a bit&quot; he said. &quot;How long will it take for me to transform?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should be about as long as Lisa Master&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Clarence shrunk a little bit as his transformation continued. His face became more feminine and his arms slimmed. As his hands became slim and dainty his finger nails grew and pink nail polish appeared on them. Breasts grew on his chest until they were a c cup. The rest of his body's transformation went unseen as he still had clothes<br />
on. Suddenly his clothes changed to more feminine clothes. His pants became a mini skirt and his shirt changed to a pink tee over. His shoes changed to black Mary Janes with a little heel and his socks became ankle high white nylon socks. Earrings appeared on his ears and makeup appeared on his face. Finally a purse appeared on his lap. The transformation was over, he was now a she.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you'll need a new name now&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it can't be Claire&quot; Clarence said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about Cindy?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like that so call me Cindy now&quot; Cindy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mistress&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see it&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said. &quot;Well I suppose I need to call your parents now too.&quot; She went to call Cindy's parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should have watched what I was saying&quot; Cindy said. &quot;Now I only have two wishes left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean you have only one wish left&quot; Lisa said. &quot;You only get three wishes from a genie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Claire said I had four wishes&quot; Cindy said. &quot;Isn't that right Claire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is correct Mistress&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Just then Mrs. Goldwin came back in and said &quot;I'm going to send you three home for today. I need to talk to the students about what happened since most of them witnessed some of Lisa's transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
You and Cindy leave Mrs. Goldwin's office and head home.</p>
