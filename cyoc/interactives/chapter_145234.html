<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You&#39;re snapped out of your lust by a loud noise from your front door. You&#39;re mortified at the thought of being seen like this, so you try to yell at whoever came in to leave, but you get half a quack out before you remember why you can&#39;t do that. You hear footsteps coming closer and you look around for a place to hide, but there&#39;s no place big enough to conceal your massive tail. You hear a loud sniffing from around the corner and your blood runs cold (do you have blood now? Well, at the least, SOMETHING inside you runs cold.) Your fear is confirmed as you see the hulking intruder come around the corner. It&#39;s the purple wolf from last night, and once he sees you, he puts on a big smile, and to your surprise starts talking in a low, growly voice.<br />
<br />
	&quot;I finally track you down, and I see the duck got to you first. Seems like he didn&#39;t manage to finish the job, though. Typical, he always was the weakest of my pack.&quot; Something seems to occur to the wolf, and he looks down at you with a devious grin. &quot;You know, I mostly kept the duck around as my personal toy. Seems like I&#39;ve got a vacancy, now. I think you&#39;ll do nicely as a replacement.&quot; Hearing this, you turn and try to escape. Your waddling, flat-footed gait wouldn&#39;t be able to outrun a 5-year old, though, and the wolf simply laughs and jogs up to you. You open your mouth to quack for help, being seen by the neighbors would be the lesser of two evils at this point, but he grabs you by the bill and holds it shut. He starts dragging you bill-first towards a burlap sack he&#39;d brought with him, shoving you into it and tightening it closed. You feel him pick the sack up and start taking you somewhere. You get jostled around in the bag for many minutes, occasionally feeling a little hot when the sack rubbed against you in the right way, before the sack finally opened and you get dumped on the floor. You look around and recognize that you&#39;re in the pool room in the mansion from the night before. The pool is still filled with the multi-colored latex goop. Terrified at the thought of being changed further, you scramble to your feet and try to run, but the wolf stops you pretty easily.<br />
<br />
	&quot;You don&#39;t have to worry about the waters changing you, duck. Now that you&#39;re park of my pack, only I can change you.&quot; It hadn&#39;t occurred to you that he might have the ability to turn you back, and you quack up a storm trying to beg him to reverse your changes. &quot;Ugh, and I suppose it&#39;s time for the first demonstration of that. Stop all that racket!&quot; With this, the wolf reaches over and grabs your bill, clamping it shut, then running his hands across it. A strange feeling passes over your bill, and when he takes his hands away, you find that you can no longer open it. You reach up to try and pry your mouth open, but you can&#39;t even feel a seam, the wolf has molded your duck bill into into a single solid object. You try to yell out but only the faintest of squeaks comes out. &quot;There. You&#39;ll find that disobedience to me is punished quickly. However, serve me well and there may be many...rewards&quot; As he says this, the wolf strokes your nullified crotch, and your libido spikes up again, making you lean into his hand despite yourself. &quot;For now, I need to regenerate in the pool, it has been a long night. While I do that, can I trust you not to try and run away?&quot; You shake your head yes, eager to please the wolf, but he laughs dismissively. &quot;Well, right answer, duck, but I don&#39;t think I can trust you just yet. Let&#39;s get you acquainted to your new role as my toy.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The wolf is on you before you can try to run, and he flips you over onto your back. He grabs your legs, and you feel the same changing feeling you felt on your bill earlier, but you can&#39;t make out what he&#39;s doing. After a minute, he flips you back over, and you try to stand up but can&#39;t manage to get your legs under you. In fact, your torso is lying flat against the ground. You look down in shock as you realize that he&#39;s removed your legs entirely! He quickly moves on to your arms, taking them and flattening them out, then pushing them against your sides. When he&#39;s done, your wing-like arms have been replaced by full, stubby wings. You flap them in horror, finding that your range of motion with them is very limited. The wolf picks you up and takes you over to the pool and tosses you in. You&#39;re afraid of sinking, but you find yourself bobbing on the surface of the pool instead, and you suddenly realize what the wolf has made you into. &quot;There we are, my own personal rubber ducky, for bathtime.&quot; The wolf laughs at his little joke as he slips into the pool, and you try to swim away from him, but the best you can do is a slight paddling with your wings that barely moves you. You try to move anything else, but the only thing you can do otherwise is wiggle your tail and swing your head around, neither of which get you moving anywhere.<br />
	<br />
	The wolf swims up beside you, gliding through the latex goop. He lifts his hand up to where your dick used to be, and starts stroking you there. &quot;There&#39;s no need to be afraid of me, duck. A toy exists to be played with.&quot; You find your pent-up arousal, which never quite left you during the whole kidnapping process, returns with a vengeance, and you do your best to lean into his hand again. He stokes you more and more and you&#39;re soon whipped back into a lustful frenzy, although without any functional limbs, all you can do is wiggle your body as you float around the pool. You&#39;re so lost in your lust that the wolf finishes his swim before you refocus. &quot;I&#39;ll do you a little favor, duck, but you&#39;ll have to earn it. You&#39;re going to stay in this pool for a while, but I know you want release. I&#39;ll give you a chance at it.&quot; You nod yes, anything to finally cum! The wolf reaches down to your front again, and you feel the reshaping happening. When he removes his hand, you find he&#39;s molded your penis back to your crotch, which looks very strange on a rubber duck, but you&#39;ll take it. &quot;I&#39;ll be back in five minutes. Good luck, duck!&quot; the wolf says, and he pulls himself of the pool and walks away, leaving you alone. You&#39;re desperate to finally orgasm, but you soon realize what the wolf has done. With no arms and no legs, you have no way of touching your penis, and no way of bringing yourself to orgasm. You try to wiggle your head to get close somehow, but you don&#39;t get anywhere close to your dick. It simply stays there, sticking erect out in front of you, taunting you. You laboriously paddle over to the walls, trying to find some stimulation, but you&#39;re so light and buoyant that the best you get is tapping your dick against the wall and bouncing off into the middle of the pool again. You let out a frustrated moan that gets changed into a tiny squeak by your stopped-up mouth.<br />
<br />
	Eventually, the wolf walks back in the room. &quot;Looks like my little toy decided not to get off after all. Good. You belong to me, and that means your pleasure belongs to me as well. Let&#39;s make a symbol to remind you of that.&quot; He cups your penis in his hand, and when he takes it away, he&#39;s remolded it again. You see that he&#39;s reshaped your dick to be much bigger, at least a foot and a half long, but looking closely you realize it&#39;s not actually a dick anymore, it&#39;s a dildo. It doesn&#39;t have any hole to orgasm out of, and looks to be permanently erect, flopping around in the liquid in front of you. You find that your lust doesn&#39;t go down at all, and you look at the wolf pleadingly, but he just smirks and walks out of the room, leaving you alone and horny. You try to push your way out of the pool, but you can&#39;t find a way to get out without legs, and even if you did you&#39;d just be more stuck on land. For the moment, you&#39;re stuck floating in this mutant swimming pool, bobbing slightly in the breeze, desperately trying not to grind yourself against the side of the pool.</p>
