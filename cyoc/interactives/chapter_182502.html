<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun shined through the window of Samantha’s new bedroom. She yawned waking up from a really good sleep, probably the best sleep she has had in a while. She was still shocked to see a beautiful feminine woman in the mirror, she touched her long black hair and it felt so soft. One potion changed her life, now she had a promotion at work, a brand new townhouse and car. She went down to her fridge and decided to make a green smoothie and egg whites for a light breakfast. She had to maintain and take care of this new heavenly and fit figure. <br />
<br />
As Samantha made her way to her outdoor patio. She noticed the broken glass from the perfume bottle, in the trash, she was stuck like this forever, not that she&#39;s complaining though, she literally got the upgrade of a lifetime probably the best thing Samuel/Samantha ever bought. After finishing breakfast, Samantha scrolled through her phone looking at the new photos she had. She found a photo of her and Fiona from a mutual friend&#39;s party. Fiona, the reason why Samuel/Samantha  purchased the reality-altering potion in the first place. <br />
<br />
Samantha still held on to her old self’s anxiety towards asking Fiona on a date. She is exactly what Fiona wants, yet she is still scared of being rejected by her. She just looked at her contact info but was frozen debating whether or not to hit the call button. She turned on her TV and just watched sports highlights to calm herself down. If only she could get a sign, then it happened. <br />
<br />
A text appeared, Samantha’s eyes lit up <br />
<br />
”Hey Sammie do you have a minute or two to talk?” <br />
<br />
Samantha took this as her sign, this was now or never, she needed to take the opportunity not only as Fiona’s dream girl but as the best version of herself. <br />
<br />
”Hello Sammie, how are you doing girl?” <br />
<br />
”I am doing great Fiona, so what&#39;s up?” <br />
<br />
”I was wondering if you wanted to have brunch at around 11:45 today? I know it seems a bit spontaneous but I would love if you made it.” <br />
<br />
”Like with our friend group?”<br />
<br />
”No I was thinking just us, we hang out a lot with our friends but I think you and I have never really hung out much.”<br />
<br />
”Wow that sounds perfect Fiona, just send me the place!” Samantha hung up and jumped off the couch with glee at the same time Fiona texted the details about the restaurant. <br />
<br />
”Oh okay, it&#39;s 8:30 a.m. and I have to meet her at 11:45 a.m., okay let’s see what I have to wear.”<br />
<br />
Samantha walked down to master closet and was taken aback.<br />
<br />
”Holy shit! This is going to be harder than I thought” <br />
<br />
Samantha had so much to wear and she wasn&#39;t sure what to wear, blouses, skirts, dresses (my lord the amount of dresses), the make-up,  what matched with what? She was glad there was a nice gap in time between brunch. She found an outfit she thought was nice, it was cute and sexy, but didn&#39;t reveal too much. She had on a white loose-fitting blouse, blue mini skirt, and black heels, with her long hair in a ponytail, with minimal makeup. She felt so feminine and confident as she walked to her car and drove to brunch. When she got out, she loved the sway of her hips, she lit up when she saw Fiona who was wearing a classic black midi bodycon dress that contrasted with her long flowing wavy red hair that she let down. Her big jade green eyes also had a spark when she saw Samantha. <br />
<br />
”Oh my gosh, I am so glad you made it out here, come I already got a table reserved for us!”<br />
<br />
The two sat down and enjoyed their meal. Samantha noticed something, Fiona would touch her hand often when they laughed together, which with Fiona’s humor happened often. Fiona is known for her touchy feeling during parties, hell even Fionna touched Samuel before, but it is usually more innocent, but this felt more flirtatious, as Fiona’s fingers lingered and probed Samantha’s smooth delicate hands, an odd tension could be felt from Fiona. <br />
<br />
”Fiona, I really liked this brunch, thank you, I was wondering, are you free for the rest of today, I was thinking we could maybe catch a movie.”<br />
<br />
”That would be amazing!” Fiona said <br />
<br />
They watched a movie, the movie’s name couldn&#39;t matter because they ended up narrating over it. The two found themselves in Samantha’s living room in the evening. <br />
<br />
”Fiona, this day was amazing thank you so much!” <br />
<br />
”Don&#39;t mention it, you made today amazing Sammie, I usually don&#39;t venture out of my home much unless, with a large group of friends, I am more of homebody.”<br />
<br />
”No way I am the same way Fiona, I like staying in too!” <br />
<br />
”Someone that gets it, although Sammie, I don&#39;t want to stay in alone, I am a femme lesbian and I really like you. I wanted to know if you would like to become more than friends, I want to be your girlfriend.” <br />
<br />
”Wow, Fiona, I can&#39;t believe-” <br />
<br />
”I am sorry I probably scared you, God this always happens with friends, I always scare off friends once I tell them I am a femme.”<br />
<br />
”No Fiona, I am a femme too, I am glad that there is another femme in our friend group especially you, I was always scared to ask you out. But wow it feels so good, I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. ”<br />
<br />
”Sammie, you don&#39;t know how happy those words made me feel.” As Fiona places her hand on Samantha’s thigh. <br />
<br />
Samantha can feel herself get wet, Fiona just looks at Samantha. She leans in closer <br />
<br />
”Sammie, may I kiss-” <br />
<br />
Samantha leaned in and it felt like everything in the world just clicked. The deal was sealed with Fiona and Samantha was truly happy. She continued to kiss Fiona and the intensity increased. Soon Fiona was kissing Samantha’s neck. Samantha moaned at this and ordered Fiona to her bedroom. They quickly stripped down to nothing and Samantha got to see Fiona in all her naked glory. Samantha aimed right for Fiona’s breasts. Fiona started to moan and pushed Samantha to the bed before shoving her tits in Samantha’s mouth. Samantha kept suckling the tits like there was no tomorrow. Fiona then ate Samantha’s pussy out and Samantha returned the favor. Something about having sex with Fiona felt right, like not only her body but her soul was made for Fiona. Emotions started to flood Fiona and Samantha and once they reached their final climax of the night, they started to cry out of pure joy and love they felt from that sex, being with their other half. <br />
<br />
”Fiona, that was amazing, I felt so much being with you!” A crying Samantha says <br />
<br />
”I know Sammie, it&#39;s like we were made for each other!” <br />
<br />
The new couple snuggled close together enjoying each other&#39;s company. As Samantha doses off to sleep, she is forever grateful to the Magic Shop Owner and their love potion, not only giving Samantha her love, but her best possible life.</p>
