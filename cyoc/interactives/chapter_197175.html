<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An hour and a half later Mark decided to get himself something to eat. As he headed to the kitchen, he looked what his brother was doing with his friends right now. Like before, Justin laid on the carpet in front of the tv, but instead of a bowl of chips next to him, he had them laying direct in front of his face, without a bowl. Whenever he wanted one, he nearly inhaled them.<br />
Rick laid back on the couch, controller loosely hold between his bare feet, making his performance in the game worse than ever, as his feet weren´t flexible or fast enough to react when needed. He still seemed to have fun doing so, stuffing his face with chips as his hands were free to do so.<br />
Chris also laid on the couch, looking normal to anyone looking. Mark grinned at the sight before reaching the kitchen, starting to make himself a sandwich. They didn´t cook every day, as he himself was a miserable cook. Whenever he had tried, the result was either burned bad, far too spicy or too salty. His brother was even worse on his rare attempts to make something, and their parents came home late from work most of the time.<br />
“Maybe I should increase my cooking with the chronivac” Mark thought, but that would take more time than he would like. “Or I make someone else cook for us, but who? None of the three out there, and not Aidan. I guess I need someone else to work with later.”<br />
He was interrupted by his brother, who walked in on all fours. It wasn´t crawling, as he tried to keep his knees in the air, which in turn let him look weird. He had to stretch his ass high to balance out his shorter arms reaching the floor. Mark had to suppress laughing as Chris approached the snack supplies, they had in the cupboard next to the fridge. When he reached the counter, he stood up normally, opened the cupboard, took another bag of chips out, and after closing the cupboard dropped back down, hobbling back with the chips held in one hand he didn´t let touch the ground again.<br />
Mark laughed as soon as Chris was back in the living room. That had looked so degrading, and his brother had no idea it wasn´t normal, as it was normal for him. But it also showed Mark that he could adjust his brother’s movements further. But that could wait for after he ate his sandwich. The other´s would sleep over anyway, so he had time.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, after a second sandwich was eaten, Mark walked back into the living room. As far as he could tell, it was another game now they played, but their positions were still the same. He quickly noticed that they had to take turns, as only two could play their game, so one of them was pausing at any time. Right now, that was Rick, who instead of playing was just munching chips like before.<br />
Mark saw that as his easy way to change one after another, so he spoke up to Rick first: “Hey Rick, aren´t that jeans and shirt way to tight for you?”<br />
Rick looked down at his chest and legs before replying: “No, they fi…”<br />
Mark had stomped, replacing Rick´s answer for him: “No, while they fit around you, you feel uncomfortable in them, as they are restricting you. You never wear any jeans, pants or shirts normally, as you can move better without them hindering you, right? That´s why, whenever you are forced to wear anything like that, you prefer nothing more than ripping them apart to free yourself, right?”<br />
Rick nodded at Mark´s explanation, accepting that as the truth. “Yeah, I hate wearing pants or shirts, they feel too tight, love to rip them off.” And as he accepted that statement as true, Rick didn´t stop to pull on his shirt until it ripped off his chest, leaving him bare above his belt. Before doing anything to his jeans, Rick enjoyed ripping the shirt to shreds, ignoring that it was one of his favorites before.<br />
When Rick was satisfied with the shreds of his shirt, he turned towards his jeans. While it was far tougher than the shirt, the constant pulling soon ripped the jeans open as well, and it was ripped to shreds as well, together with the belt. He had just finished ripping it to shreds when the others finished their round, and Chris gave him the controller without any comment about his sudden need to shred his clothes. Rick grabbed the controller, this time normally with his hands, only sitting there in his boxers, surrounded by shreds.<br />
Mark was laughing silently at the show Rick had made by ripping everything to shreds, and took his time before turning to his now waiting brother. A mean grin appeared on Mark´s face as he started to speak: “Chris, isn´t that position uncomfortable for you?”<br />
Chris looked confused towards his brother. He laid on his back like he always did, feet on the table, head on a pillow. “No, why would it be uncomf…”<br />
Again, Mark stomped, breaking his brothers answer before he replaced it. “No, Chris, you hate laying on your back, you are more comfortable if you lay curled on your side. Or you just sit with your head on your knees, arms in front of you, right? And aren´t you normally banned from sitting or lying on furniture?” An evil grin tried to split Mark´s face in half.<br />
Chris slowly nodded, repeating: “Yeah, I either curl up or sit with my head on my knees, and always on the ground, as I´m not allowed to sit on furniture.” While he spoke, Chris sat up, pulled his legs back towards his chest before placing his head on his knees. His arms dangled in front of his legs for a second, before Chris placed his hands firmly in front of his feet.<br />
Mark waited a few more seconds, glancing at the game of the others before he yelled: “Why are you on the couch, brother? Are you breaking the rules again, Chris? Just like in the kitchen, simply standing up to open the cupboard with your hands?”<br />
Chris was startled at his brother´s yell, only now realizing that he was sitting on the couch. He panicked as he tried to get down from it, only to land head-first next to Justin on the carpet. While both Justin and Rick had jerked a bit at the yell, they simply continued their game, disinterested in the brother’s argument.<br />
Chris had yelped as he landed, but quickly righted himself to answer his brother: “No, I simply forgot I was on the couch. Please don´t yell at me Mark. And what do you mean, why wouldn´t I stan…”<br />
That had been the other thing Mark had wanted to interrupt, so he stomped before Chris was finished with the word “stand”. As Chris looked confused, Mark filled the ripped hole: “No, Chris, you never stand up on two legs, as it is far too risky to topple over for you. And as you normally ball your hands into fists, grabbing something is hard for you, right? You could have dropped the chips to easily from them. You carry things in or with your mouth and love to lick everything in front of your nose, right?”<br />
Chris, still in shock about his rule-breaking before nodded enthusiastically at his brother, repeating: “Yeah, not safe to stand on two legs, and hard to grab anything with my fists. It´s normal to carry things in or with my mouth. I love licking things in front of my nose.” As Mark watched, Chris balled his hands to tight fists, limiting his fingers movement.<br />
Shortly before Chris would be playing again, Mark added for now: “Chris, whenever I say “Reset to dog” to you, you will return to your current mindset.” Chris didn´t understand what his brother meant, but just then Justin handed his controller over to Chris. He licked Justin´s hand as well as the controller before taking the cable with his mouth and placing it down in front of his fists, already having forgotten Mark´s weird remark. So, he then worked the controller with his fists, dropping his gaming skill down good. He was evenly matched with Rick, who decided to play with his feet again, as both were rather bad that way.<br />
Mark couldn´t stop the laughter this time, seeing how the two played the game, but as Justin laughed at the clumsy movements on the screen, they didn´t get mad at either of them. It took Mark a bit to calm himself to turn towards Justin, who watched the others play, but glanced back towards Rick a few times.</p>
