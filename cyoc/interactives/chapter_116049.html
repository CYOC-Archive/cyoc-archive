<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You&#39;re certain another agent is going to be coming?&quot; Harry asked to Jenny as they made their way toward the Student Union/Commons building, where Moon Lake College&#39;s restaurants and cafeteria were located.<br />
<br />
&quot;The dream felt real... and... I... I just feel I need to trust the parts of me that represent who I was and pretty much who I am now,&quot; Jenny said weakly as she looked to her fiance. She noted the concern in his eyes, and that was more than enough to assure her that he loved her and their bond was strong. &quot;And even if it&#39;s false... he&#39;s done so much... it&#39;d be better to be safe than sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t say I disagree,&quot; Harry admitted, thinking about Huck would not be released from the hospital until late that afternoon, and that was at the absolute earliest. From what he remembered the mostly likely release date for his brother sometime on Friday afternoon, and that was enough to make him want to totally eviscerate Dieter Wilhelm for it. But that&#39;d have to be left to the law.<br />
<br />
&quot;About all we can truly hope for is that things are quiet with regard today and tomorrow and for the first ceremony that makes us man and wife,&quot; Jenny said to him, &quot;And so far...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry reached out to hold Jenny to him, and feeling the warmth of her body was enough to make him feel better. It was a sign of her health and to some extent her confidence. He&#39;d initially feared that there would be major trauma that would take a long time to heal, thanks to Jenny being incomplete for as long as she was. But, she had recovered from that well enough. Her only issue was her family. Inviting them to the wedding was understandable, as they were family, and Harry could see Jenny&#39;s confidence building that he knew that if push truly came to shove, she could make the final break.<br />
<br />
Though, Harry knew that sort of &quot;break&quot; was probably coming regardless. From what he&#39;d been told, Jenny got along well with her siblings and that she and her older brother had looked out for the younger ones, but her older brother was further along through a local college and supposedly had a fairly decent job already lined up that was waiting for him when he graduated. Jenny didn&#39;t expect him to give that up to move to Moon Lake, and even told Harry she wasn&#39;t going to urge her older brother to do that. Her biggest worry was with her younger siblings, with a younger brother possibly being gay and the risk that her parents might turn their frustration on her younger sister, and with her oldest brother no longer at home all the time, he couldn&#39;t shield his younger siblings as he used to. And even if her family life was rosy, Jenny had told him that she intended to move to Moon Lake full time and live with her husband and her fellow weres, and that would mean a full break from her family and Alabama. Has they paid for their lunches before going to their respective cafeteria lines, Harry figured that the only question that was really on that family front for Jenny would be the exact nature of the break and so on, and that wouldn&#39;t be determined until they arrived.<br />
<br />
They ultimately got different lunches, but made sure join up together before walking around from the counters where they could pick out their lunches and enter into the large cafeteria room with its rows of tables. That area had a wall that separated the cafeteria from the serving counters and along that wall were various beverage dispenses, including soft drinks, juices, milk cartons, and even coffee in the morning. Harry and Jenny were quick to collect their drinks  and then turned back to the cafeteria. As they looked in, they found Karen sitting with Peter and looking out a window toward the area around the building. After a few moments Karen looked up and noticed Jenny and Harry. She then gave a wave and motioned for them to join them. Harry and Jenny were quick to join them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Jenny, you doing okay?&quot; Karen asked as Harry and Jenny arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;All things considered, I&#39;m doing well,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;things have been quiet so far today and everyone says I&#39;m making progress with regard to my therapy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s great!&quot; Karen gave a happy smile, &quot;so there&#39;s been no additional trouble?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None that we can do anything about right now,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;and even that might be vague.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vague?&quot; Peter asked as he looked up from his seat with a raised eyebrow to Harry and then glancing to Jenny at the same time.<br />
<br />
Jenny gave a sigh as she sat down next to Karen and while Harry sat down next to Peter. She gave a slight sigh and explained the dream she&#39;d had closer to morning and the likelihood that Dieter Wilhelm was coming with a third agent with the very intention of causing trouble. The only thing that would really be in their favor was that Dieter likely thought that Harry was already dead and that all he needed to do was to claim his prize. As she finished, Peter gave a growling sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully that stays only a dream,&quot; Peter commented, &quot;You deserve that much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jenny said after a moment, grateful that everyone remained so supportive of her. In many ways, things that related to her and her wedding were enough that most would leave her to wrestle through it on her own, yet in Moon Lake, she seemed to be getting support from all angles.<br />
<br />
&quot;But for the moment, things have been quiet and no immediate trouble,&quot; Karen commented, &quot;which is good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny and Harry both nodded as they took a few bites of their lunch. After a moment, Karen looked to Harry with a question of her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... have you heard any updates on your brother?&quot; Karen asked to Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much... other than that he doesn&#39;t like hospital food,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;beyond that there isn&#39;t much to update on. The earliest he could get out would be late this afternoon to evening and the doctors all said the mostly likely release time will be Friday afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... do you and your friends have any grand adventures planned for your last night as a bachelor?&quot; Karen asked with a slightly teasing voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;A bachelor party?!&quot; Harry gasped. A few of his friends from high school had met with him from time to time and voiced the idea, but given everything, he felt his place was to be by Jenny&#39;s side and give her all the love, comfort, and support that she needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... and it doesn&#39;t have to be racy or anything,&quot; Karen commented, &quot;you go out... eat a bunch of hot wings... listen to those with married experience tell you about how all the odd things their wives do was worth marrying their wives and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;d generally figured to be there to give my support to Jenny,&quot; Harry answered slowly, though his bond to Jenny remained fierce.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you&#39;ll need to do something for tomorrow night,&quot; Karen told him, going over the things she&#39;d been thinking of since she arrived on campus that morning. &quot;Because there will be plenty to get Jenny ready... do her nails, do her hair, go over all the bride and maid of honor plans for the wedding, and maybe go out for a little celebratory dinner of our own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not really looking for a bacholorette party either, Karen,&quot; Jenny whispered to her friend and roommate.<br />
<br />
&quot;And besides,&quot; Karen continued to Harry, &quot;you know its bad luck to see the bride immediately before the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry gave a sigh at this and even Jenny had to admit that there was something of a point there. Now, some people would probably say they wouldn&#39;t believe in luck or hadn&#39;t experienced luck in their lives and that the good they did was due to something other than luck, but Jenny figured she&#39;d need just about everything that might help.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then, on the morning of the wedding when you see each other...&quot; Karen continued to a warm smile, &quot;You&#39;d be overjoyed to see each other and feel the love that you have for each other. And that I think would get you through anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny watched as Karen paused to look to Peter, who&#39;d been following things fairly closely. Though Jenny also noticed that the werelion&#39;s eyes were focused almost purely on Karen as she looked to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because love conquers all,&quot; Karen then finished, &quot;and you two have looked so happy together, I&#39;m certain that you can get through everything that comes... no mater how stressful it may be.&quot;</p>
