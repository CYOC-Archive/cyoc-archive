<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris couldn’t understand what the hell was going on but he knew the first thing to do was to remain calm. He had to remain as calm as he could so that he could buy himself time to get himself out of the teeth of whatever this creature was that had latched onto his lower body. The creature was so heavy and was acting as a dead weight holding him down onto the deck of this old warship turned artificial reef. <br />
<br />
That alone would have been death within minutes but he had been scuba diving not snorkeling so he had almost twenty minutes of air left in his tank and the surface was so close he could get up there in less then a minute or so. Well that was if his legs worked, he couldn’t feel anything from the waste down anymore, not even pain anymore. His legs should be screaming in pain since the last he saw them though the translucent skin of this creature they had been swimming in a pool of his own blood as God knows how many teeth ripped into them.<br />
 <br />
He looked around, he had landed on the deck of the ship which meant he was closer to the surface but fewer people were nearby. He could see another man nearby; he was holding one hand over his mouth as he tried to force off the creature as best he could. Poor man had been snorkeling, he didn’t have time to think he had minutes before death claimed him and he was too far away for Chris to offer any help.<br />
<br />
He had to help himself first.<br />
<br />
He looked for his knife, he had to try to cut himself free again. The first time he had stabbed clear away from where his legs were inside the creature but he had felt that pain. Must have been a fluke a couple of good stabs sends almost anything running. To his horror, his knife had come to rest between him and the man struggling to find a way to live, it was too far away for that man to get too but in order for Chris to get it he had to watch the man struggle to keep alive.<br />
<br />
“I am so sorry.” Said Chris to himself as he began to pull himself toward his knife, the dead weight of this creature making feel double or triple the weight he was. He tried not to look at the drowning man but after a while he looked up expecting to see a lifeless horror. Instead, the man was looking around dumb founded as he seamed to be breathing.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” inquired Chris as he paused and looked at the man, he was breathing in water only for him to exhale a couple of moments later. That was impossible. Then he noticed something that was almost impossible but something clearly happening unnoticed to the man. <br />
<br />
The man was about of age with him, mid-twenties with dark brown hair, only now that man’s dark brown hair was quickly changing into a sort of green neon green color. Then he noticed that the creature which had latched onto that man was also changing colors, going from translucent color to beginning to take on a more orange with some greens in it.<br />
<br />
“What the hell?” said Chris as suddenly he had something much more concerning to worry about as his scuba tank went flying off his back in a burst of pain. He gasped as his oxygen line came out of his mouth and water rushed in. His wet suit also fell off leaving him bear chested.<br />
<br />
He began to panic only to find that he was actually breathing the water. He rolled over only to find he couldn’t roll over as something a kin to the dorsal fin of a shark had grown out of his back merging with the creature who had latched on to him. That is when he noticed that while the other man’s had a very simple creature latched onto him his looked like a sharks. <br />
<br />
The sudden growth of the dorsal fin had ripped his suit and forced his air tank away from him. On top of that new membrane like growths had appeared under his arm pits and between his fingers.<br />
<br />
“What the actual fuck.” Said Chris a load.<br />
<br />
“I know.” Said the other man as Chris turned back to him only to see that man was rapidly changing, the tail had almost totally filled in with oranges and greens and even the man’s eyes and eyebrows now where that impossible green. <br />
<br />
Chris turned back to his own change?<br />
<br />
The creature which now covered his entire lower body now had changed from translucent see through to that of scales but scales in a rich mix of browns, tans, and spots of darker brownish black with some white. It kind of reminded Chris of leopard’s sharks and two side fins which had been on the creature had somehow moved up so that they were almost in line with his belly button.<br />
<br />
Then he noticed that his upper body was actually getting smaller, no thinner. He felt his bones snap as his shoulders became smaller, then he noticed that his body fat seamed to be on the move. Some of it moved to his hips but his eyes widened as wide as dinner plates as two rather large mounds began to grow on his chest. <br />
<br />
“No…no…no.” said Chris his voice sounding much more feminine. He realized then that he was becoming a mermaid. His now thinner and more feminine hands snapped up to his chest in an attempt to cover them only to feel how sensitive these breasts were. They had to be at least large B size cups or maybe small Cs and God help him the nipples were really sensitive. He didn’t even really noticed that his short hair seemed to have grown out a bit and now brushed the back of his neck. He couldn’t see it but his face had become feminine as well, with a smaller nose, more graceful neck and larger eyes. <br />
<br />
“My God I am a mermaid.” Said Chris<br />
<br />
“Speak for yourself.” Said the other man, as Chris turned to see that the other man had become ripped. To his horror Chris checked this man out as ideas he normally thought when looking at a women entered his mind causing a blush across his face while looking at this merman. What didn’t help was that the guy’s merman dick was out and slowly retreating into his body leaving a small bulge in the scales of his tail. Chris looked to where his dick should be only to see a smooth slit in his tail marking him as a mermaid for sure. He was now a she. <br />
<br />
She reached out and touched it and realized she could feel it like this mermaid tail was now her flesh. That made her mind think for a second.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck is going on?” inquired the man<br />
<br />
“I don’t know.” Said Chris as she summoned the will and tried to kick off the deck of the ship with her tail and instead of a dead weight it was before the creature listened to her and within seconds her head burst through the surface. She was able to breath, but it felt weird breathing air and it actually felt better under the water. <br />
<br />
She dropped his head back down and took a strangely relaxing breath of sea water. Others were now heading up to her, all different types of mermaids and merman all of them wondering what the hell had just happened to them.</p>
