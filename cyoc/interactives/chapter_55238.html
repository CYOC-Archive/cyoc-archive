<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;For the dragons. It wasn't so much the conflict between dragons and humans, but more <br />
like dragons and 'civilization', Lupmans and Leomans and Felmans civilizations had all <br />
suffered from the Huns and Mongols. Handing over Draco Fire still as an egg had been a <br />
token symbolic gesture at best, since the age of ravaging hordes had long since past, but <br />
it did settles a good deal of bad blood.&quot; <br />
<br />
Betty said in a slightly harsh tone, &quot;And it's not like everyone everywhere has the exact <br />
same culture just because they're the same species! Anyone who thinks that has watched <br />
too much science fiction!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And some breeds of fantasy as well,&quot; Marie said, &quot;And you are of course correct. In fact, <br />
cultural dissonance was one of the underlying secondary causes of the American <br />
Revolution, Britain and the American Colonies had reached the point where they no longer <br />
aligned culturally. There were plenty of other reasons but that was more or less one of <br />
them. <br />
<br />
 As another instance, felmans in Egypt, Japan, Asia, and Europe, are all very different <br />
culturally. And the different environments have shown different 'color pallets,' yes yes I <br />
know it sounds like the outdated idea of creatures mutating in their own lifetime to their <br />
environment but it actually had to do with the hormones released in different climates <br />
during development. It similar to how wild foxes when bred in captivity began to show <br />
coats that didn't appear in the wild.&quot; <br />
<br />
Somewhere Amy thanked every Shinto deity in existence (there were a lot) for the game <br />
not adding -kitsune- to the over sized mixing bowel of sentient tool users that the world <br />
had now become in the span of one week. The world had changed wildly enough, adding <br />
another sapient tool using species to the mix might result in reality thinking all of <br />
civilization had become too much trouble and had to go. <br />
<br />
&quot;Felman in China dress more conservatively than most humans and consider it a taboo not <br />
to accept a husband or wife by a certain age to being considering them people who had <br />
turned their back on their own people. That one came about to due to felman small <br />
numbers and a phobia of extinction. Ones in Africa, male or female are both bare chested <br />
and all try to make themselves appear as similar to Bastet's ideal image as possible, and <br />
men being second class citizens.  By European felman standards Japanese felmans are <br />
pathologically obsessed with appearing 'cute.' Japanese felman on the other hand think <br />
that European felmans have no sense of beauty. And the stereotype of American felmans <br />
due to not having the same crossing breeding taboos as African and Asian do is-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough. I'm sure everyone gets the point.&quot; Betty said. &quot;And as you keep saying little miss, <br />
we're all getting off track of the story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh quite right.&quot; Glass Marie nodded. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
As Jesen left after kissing his wife Fran good-bye and good luck, he bumped shoulders and <br />
acknowledge Mother Glenn, Gillian II, and Gllie (on Mother Glen's back) who entered the <br />
medical wing as he left. Gillie seemed very surprised to see Tad there, strange consider she <br />
had arrived with him. <br />
<br />
Mother Glenn of course had words of honor and encouragement to share with the members <br />
of her pride who had fought so bravely and honorably for the sake of civilization... and of <br />
course to introduce Gillian his pride and announce her intent of taking him as their prime <br />
mate. <br />
<br />
Millie did NOT liking being reminded of the wolf Jessie's actions, but was glade that <br />
another piece of damage done by the game was undone. <br />
<br />
The gem teen wolves normally with a day without classes would have simply gone to the <br />
video arcade or similar distraction, but with so many in the medical wing, it didn't feel <br />
right. Of course the gem teens had -also- suffered by Kurse's power, being turned into her <br />
happy little chaotic dancing puppets... <br />
<br />
So they had emotional tension to swim through which was technically Sarah's department... <br />
But Sarah was busy acting as a running for supplies for the Nurses and Fran. So the teen <br />
wolves were mostly left to their own devices unable to leave the estate due to needing to <br />
be on call, Julie basically have conscripted every member in the pack to make shift field <br />
nurses on top of the members of the pride who had volunteered for the work. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you wannna do?&quot; Emerald asked her fraternal twin. <br />
<br />
Ruby replied, &quot;I'm not sure what do you wanna do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't even start!&quot; Amber cut the endless cycle short. <br />
<br />

<br />
1685<br />
<br />
Their god father had taken them and their pets back to Gita, or apparently now Gaal's <br />
house. The idea of women living alone was incomprehensible to such people, but for some <br />
reason every turned a blind eye to it or instantly turned the discussion to something, <br />
ANYTHING else the moment the thought dared to cross their minds... <br />
<br />
They had been under for three weeks, and their god father feared they would never awake, <br />
and another part feared that they WOULD awaken. Of course the three odd animals helped. <br />
Another with a couple of odd small butterfly winged creatures that said that they owed the <br />
three witches a depth that should be honored. <br />
<br />
The people of Glendale wandered in a daze for a day after the attempted use of the rune to <br />
create a town of immortal children. After that, they could barely remember the last two <br />
days except as a bunch of strange symbols of the three women ... something or other <br />
about them, the spell intended to brainwash them into 'perfectly good children' having <br />
misfired and left incompletely left the last couple days in a haze. <br />
<br />
The witch's spell itself could have worked in theory... but the giant rune simply didn't draw <br />
upon enough power to create a bubble of expelled time, oh the rune COULD have handled <br />
that much power, but the lines for drawing in that power the witches had drawn had been <br />
intended for much small effects and runes. <br />
<br />
Glass Marie said, &quot;Magic A is Magic A, as they say. The laws of scale apply to magic as <br />
much as anything. They witches basically didn't give enough input to the level of output <br />
they expected from their rune... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess magic isn't all powerful after all eh?&quot; Maddex said smugly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only God is all powerful. And those who look at science from the outside think science <br />
can do anything... only alchemists who walk the line between magic and science can <br />
appreciate both sides. And before we get off track again, yes, the fairies were the various <br />
ones created by Griselle. They ended up saving her life... When the girls, no, the WOMEN <br />
awakened, they however didn't even think of this, they were sure reality itself, being cruel <br />
and unfair, didn't WANT THEM to make a place that was fair, and had purposely subjugated <br />
their efforts... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like they had succumbed to egomania.&quot; Maddex said seemingly the one always to <br />
point out another flaw of the villains. <br />
<br />
&quot;Among other things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn't he just leave them?&quot; Maddex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were his family... he couldn't abandon them...&quot; Glass Marie said as if that explained <br />
everything. <br />
<br />

1685 Summer <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder where Marie is?&quot; Kathrine spoke to no one and everyone, dirty, walking like a <br />
zombie, and looking foreword in an empty daze.  That was when she fainted, and landed <br />
flat on the floor. <br />
<br />
Rumor princess Zoey pushed up on her glasses (a miracle of invention she thanked God <br />
for) when she found her less than a minute later. &quot;Kathrine? That's not the time for a nap... <br />
Kathrine?.. Oh dear...&quot; The human picked up the bright blue/pink green highlighted felman <br />
and carried her as best she could to Kathrine's room. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile on the other side of the Vatican. <br />
<br />
&quot;Father Draco Fire? My name is Sister Marie Cruz... we need to talk...&quot;</p>
