<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright Jake,&quot; began Kyle, &quot;The thing is, various high school students have been using this curse for years.  Some have used it to become popular, others to eliminate their enemies, and some to help make Football America&#39;s favorite past time... it&#39;s amazing what you can learn in a library.  Anyway, the point is, I plan to use this curse for the good of mankind.  After all is said and done, there will be no more war, no more gender-biased behavior, and no more racism.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you plan to do that?&quot; asked Jake, honestly interested in the nerd&#39;s plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you.&quot;  There was the ruffling of papers.  It seemed Kyle had been preparing this plan for a while.  &quot;Jake, for your transformation whenever you sneeze you will slowly transform into an attractive, female version of yourself with the addition of cat eyes, ears, a tail, and lastly your clitoris will extend into a penis-like shaft.  This will leave you with both male and female genitalia though your testicles will be somewhere inside your body.  This same transformation will corrupt your current cold and be passed to everyone within a certain radius of you.  Those effected by the cold, do not physically age past 30, but still have a normal human-life span.  Those infected by the curse will not be effected by STDs of any kind and catgirls can still get pregnant, but pregnancy now involves a mental element.  If both catgirls do not wish to be pregnant, then they will not get pregnant.  Society will become a much more open society with people mating and sleeping with whomever, often using sex as a way to resolve issues.  Even little things like footjobs, blowjobs, etc. will become akin to a firm handshake or a hug.  This will accompany a general increase in libido.  People will still marry though may still have sex occasionally outside of marriage without the taboo of adultery.  Everyone will view the transformed people as normal and those who are infected will have their memories altered so that it will be as if they were always catgirls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; interuppted Jake, concern and disgust on his lips.  &quot;I am mildly impressed by how much thought you have put into this, but also kinda weirded out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not done,&quot; retorted Kyle as he continued.  &quot;Because I had this great idea to use this curse for good, I&#39;m going to add some personal touches.  Anyone infected by the catgirl cold will obtain a sock fetish.  The infected will love socks, love wearing them, will love seeing people wearing socks, and will wear shoes begrudingly in order to keep their socks clean.  The more colorful or cool the socks, the better.  To signify that two catgirls are in a relationship, married or not, the two may show this either through the traditional ring or by gifting socks.  It will be a common place for catgirls to swap clothing after intercourse of anytype.  Clothing will be optional, though still preferred.  The current equivalent of male clothing will still exist in the world to some degree, but will mostly exist just to notate who in the relationship is the &quot;butch&quot; or &quot;bitch&quot; of the relationship.  Any questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plenty-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t care,&quot; continued Kyle.  &quot;For your dare.  I dare you to completely forget about what has just transpired.  After I hang up, all information concerning the curse will disappear from human memory so as no one can undo this change.  Next, once you hang up, you will sneeze at least once every 10 minutes for the rest of the day, infecting all in a 30 foot radius of you.  Next, once you hang up, you will find your most colorful pair of socks and wear them today.  Lastly, once you arrive at school, your mission will be to find your girlfriend, and kiss her.&quot;  There was a pause as Kyle refiled through his papers, checking over his various notes and theories.  &quot;And... that... should be... wait, um... nah, we&#39;re good.  Okay, have fun.&quot;  There was a loud click as Kyle hung up the phone on his end.  <br />
<br />
Jake stared at the phone for a moment.  What the hell had he just listened to?  Did this Kyle really think the town curse was a thing and could it really be used in this way?  First thing was, Jake was definitely planning on talking to the principal about this as soon... what was he doing.  Jake had just hung up the phone.  What had he been doing for the past ten minutes?  He remembered... something, but every time he tried to focus it seemed to get farther away.  <br />
<br />
As Jake tried to think, his eyes managed to catch sight of his feet.  They were dressed much they way they&#39;d always been, in white, plane socks with a grey spotted toe and heel.  Jake found himself feeling kinda disgusted.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell, these are so boring,&quot; he said to himself.  &quot;Gawh, what the hell was I thinking?&quot;  Running to his room, Jake refiled through his drawers.  White and gray, white and gray, black, gawh, every sock that Jake found was infuriatingly boring.  Finally, Jake stumbled upon a pair of blue soccer socks with a trio of red stripes towards the top.  With a shout of glee Jake rain over to his bed, sneezing along the way, and sat down on his bed and pulled off the horrid, white socks.  So desperate was he to pull on these new socks, Jake did not even registered that his feet were not as bulky and masculine as they once were.  <br />
<br />
Once he was done pulling on the knee-high socks, Jake leaned back and glanced at his work.  His feet were barely visible beneath the folds of his khaki slacks.  Disgruntled, Jake&#39;s first response was to pout, swiping some of his brown, hair aside in a fluster.  After a moment, Jake had an idea.  Grabbing the hem of each leg, Jake rolled up each pant leg until they were about halfway up his calves.  Leaning back for a second time, Jake wiggled his toes in glee at his new look.<br />
<br />
After this, Jake was not surprised to find he had a hard on.  Jake glanced at the clock.  The school bus would be here any minute, but he couldn&#39;t just walk out there without address this issue.  Thinking quickly, Jake unbuttoned his pants and unleashed his manhood.  He then grabbed both of his feet and began to rub his cock against them.  The sensation of soft cotton against his manhood felt amazing, each brush bringing him closer and closer to a pleasurable release.  Hurrying the process along, Jake soon reached his point and fired, spraying his socks and some of the far wall with cum.  Jake glanced at his semen covered feet and giggled, they looked much better this way.<br />
<br />
Jumping to his feet, Jake heard the sound of the bus waiting outside.  Grabbing a blue-Tshirt with a series of cool designs on it and his backpack, Jake raced to the door.  With a huff of annoyance, Jake slipped on his shoes and ran outside, completely unaware of how he and the cold he carried would soon change the world.</p>
