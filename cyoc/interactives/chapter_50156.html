<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was home alone, which meant that Mark was masturbating. Since just after turning 13, he’d discovered a new use for his dick. Now, he made a point of “using” his dick whenever he got the chance. With his parents away for a few hours, he was taking his time finding some good porn on the computer.<br />
<br />
Mark was an average 13-year-old. He wasn’t particularly athletic like his friend, Tim. He wore glasses. Although his mom said he’d be a looker one day, he felt he had a quite ordinary face. Compared to the other boys, he was behind in his development, leaving him a scrawny 4’10” tall.<br />
<br />
Because sports weren’t really his thing, he’d made masturbating his hobby, and, boy, did he excel at it. He could stretch a fantasy out for hours if he had the time, which is what he had planned for today. On the computer, he’d already found several hot naked chicks that were to his liking. They had huge tits, a must for him, and were generally good looking. Sadly, big tits and good looks just didn’t seem to go together as much as Mark hoped they would. It was hard to find a girl with the whole package.<br />
<br />
Then, the doorbell rang. Mark groaned, frustrated at the interruption, and rushed downstairs to the door, all the while trying to will away the half-boner poking out of his shorts.<br />
<br />
Without looking, Mark swung the door open and said, “Hello? Who...” But, at that moment, he lost the ability to talk. Standing before him was a girl with the whole package. Huge tits, beautiful face, long legs, thin waist... he thought that he must be dreaming. He must have just slipped off into a very realistic sexual fantasy.<br />
<br />
“Mark!” she said, excitedly. “Good, you’re home. Is anyone else home right now?”<br />
<br />
“Uh...” was all Mark could manage, his brain having shut down. <br />
<br />
“Come on, Mark. Is anyone home? I need to hide out somewhere for a bit.”<br />
<br />
“Uh... nobody’s here but me,” Mark finally managed.<br />
<br />
“Thank God!” she said and let herself in, closing the door behind her. Mark looked her body over again. He guessed that she was at least 17. She was shoeless and inexplicably wearing a very tight basketball jersey and shorts. And, that was about it for clothes. He could definitely tell that she had, gulp, no bra.<br />
<br />
She turned to him and said, “OK, Mark, I know this is going to be hard to believe, but I need you to help me. So, please, just listen.”<br />
<br />
“Uh...”<br />
<br />
She put her hands on his shoulders and looked him in the eyes. “I’m not really a girl. I’m actually your friend, Tim. Some genie turned me into a girl with magic.”<br />
“Uh...” He started at her blankly.<br />
<br />
“MARK!” she shouted. “Did you hear what I said?” He took a couple of steps back and her hands dropped off his shoulders.<br />
<br />
“You’re... Tim?” he said.<br />
<br />
“Yes!” she said and stared at him desperately.<br />
<br />
Normally, he would have called any stranger who came to his door talking about genies and magic a liar. But, in this case...<br />
<br />
“OK,” he said.<br />
<br />
“You believe me?” she asked. He nodded. She leapt at him and embraced him in a tight hug, ramming her huge tits into his chin. “Oh, thank you so much for believing me. I was so scared that no one would listen to me because I look like this.” She kept hugging him for what seemed like a minute. That half-boner he’d been willing away before was now at full mast. He was careful not to poke her leg with it.<br />
<br />
Eventually, after realizing that they’d been hugging a long while, she said, “Oh! Sorry!” and released him. “I guess I got carried away just now. I was so scared out there and you were going to help me and...” she bit her lip and looked him up and down. “...I’m so confused, man. This is so fucked up.” She walked over to the couch in the living room and sat down, holding her head in her hands. Luckily, the curtains were drawn shut so no one would see them in there.<br />
<br />
Mark walked over to her and sat down next to her on the couch, making sure to leave at least one cushion of space between them. He could see that she’d started to cry. Cautiously, he reached out a hand and rested it on her shoulder to console her.<br />
<br />
“It’s OK,” he said, at the same time realizing that it was very much not OK for Tim if that was Tim. “We’ll figure something out.”<br />
<br />
She looked at him and smiled weakly. “Thank you,” she said and put her hand on his hand giving it a gentle rub. Mark had to concentrate very hard not to come in his shorts right there.<br />
<br />
She wiped away her tears. “God, look at me,” she said, letting him go and standing up to stare at her body. “I’m getting all emotional now. There must be a bunch of hormones rushing through me or something. Unbelievable.” Seemingly absentmindedly, she had rested her hands on top of her huge tits as she stared off blankly, lost in thought.<br />
<br />
Mark tried to think of something to say. “Uh... can I get you something to drink?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m thirsty,” she said, being drawn back to reality and dropping her hands to her sides. “Water would be cool.”<br />
<br />
He rushed to the kitchen and had a glass filled with ice water in her hand just a few seconds later.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, dude. You’ve always been a good friend,” she said, and smiled at him affectionately.<br />
<br />
“Anything for a bud,” he said and tired to smile back and not stare at her lustfully like a horny teenager.<br />
<br />
She sipped the water and sat back down on the couch. This time, Mark sat right next to her.<br />
<br />
“So...” he said. “What do we do now? We have a couple of hours until my parents get home.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” she said, frowning. She put the water down and crossed her hands on her lap. “I just need to clear my head a bit. I feel so...” She shifted her hips on the couch. “...uneasy.” Mark noticed her sneak a peek at his crotch. “Shit!” he thought. “She saw the boner. She’s going to think I’m a pervert or something now.” But, she didn’t say anything. In fact, she peeked at his boner again.<br />
<br />
“Mark?” she said.<br />
<br />
“Uh... yeah?”<br />
<br />
She closed her eyes as if she were trying to summon the courage to say the next thing. “Can you help me with something?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” he said. “What is it?”<br />
<br />
Again, she shifted her hips. “Don’t be weirded out. OK? But, I think I need you to help me have...” she took a deep breath. “...an orgasm.”<br />
<br />
Mark closed his eyes and tried to think of anything else so as not to come in his shorts.<br />
<br />
“You see,” she said, “I just feel horny constantly, ever since I turned into a girl. I can’t think straight and all I want to do is masturbate or have sex. And, well...”<br />
<br />
“Yeah?”<br />
<br />
“...I seem to be attracted to guys now... big time. Fucking hormones.”<br />
<br />
“Oh?” he said, still concentrating hard on not blowing his load.<br />
<br />
“Mark,” she said turning to him with that desperate look in her eyes again. “I know this is totally weird and gross, but could you have sex with me... please?”<br />
<br />
“Uh... OK.”<br />
<br />
As soon as the “K” left his mouth, her lips were pressed against his, and she was on top of him. She felt surprisingly heavy laying on him as they made out sloppily like two teenagers unaccustomed to kissing anyone. Mark just kept thinking, “Don’t blow it yet, not yet, not yet...”<br />
<br />
She sat up, kneeling above his abdomen, and said, “Time to get these damn tight clothes off.” She peeled off her basketball Jersey, up and over her head. Finally, her massive tits bounced free. “Oh, thank God!” she moaned. Nipples! Immediately, Marks hands were on her hanging tits massaging them all over. She lay down on the couch next to him as she tried to work her too small shorts off her broad hips and ass. Eventually, with a loud ripping sound, they came loose and were quickly kicked off the bottom of her legs. They just stared at each other for a second.<br />
<br />
There she was, naked. Very, very naked. Absolutely, totally, completely fucking naked and laying right next to him. “Don’t come!” he thought. “Not yet!”<br />
<br />
She carefully pulled his shorts and underwear down, revealing his 4 inch hard on. She climbed on him, smiled at him and slipped his dick into her wet pussy.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yes!” she moaned, closing her eyes. “Yes, finally!”<br />
<br />
She worked her hips against him and he almost lost his mind with pleasure. She was so hot and wet inside, like nothing he’d ever experienced before alone. They kissed and fondled and humped for what seemed like hours. Though, it was probably only a few minutes. Then, everything rose to a crescendo -- the pleasure, the moaning, the thrusting -- and she yelled, “Oh! Oh! I feel it! I’m coming! I’m coming!” Mark finally let himself go and blew his load up inside of her. They both shuddered to a halt and lay together in one big sweaty pile. Mark slipped out of her dripping pussy, not even caring about the mess on the couch or anything else for that matter. She rolled off of him and they lay next to each other in their shared orgasmic afterglow, staring affectionately into each other’s eyes.<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” she said and kissed him gently on the lips. “You’re a real friend.”<br />
<br />
“Anything for a bud,” he said and then thought, “That sure beat the hell out of any porn. Wonder what we’ll do next?”</p>
