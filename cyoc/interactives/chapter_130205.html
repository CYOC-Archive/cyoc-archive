<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">During a cascade of thoughts that flickered through mind, it was just a flash once when he blinked but that was enough.  A hot flush passed over Tom that then prickled up every hair on his body.<br />
<br />
Then came the sharp tug at his nose like someone had hooked their meaty fingers into his nostrils, warping them out, while starting to tug his face away from him.  Tom&#39;s yelp of pain was stifled when he clamped his hands over his mouth and as much of his face as he could.  Despite this, after a few moments of wincing in pain at the strange yanking at his nose, he could feel the odd rim of his nostrils brush into his fingers.  Nostrils flaring hot and wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?  Don&#39;t be shy,&quot; Kate teased, taking a step forward and reaching for Tom&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
Quickly retreating, hands still covering, Tom noticed as he moved that his pajama pants were feeling quite tight.  Odder and more troubling was the weird feelings going down from the tip of his spine, which ached and felt like someone pinching him.  His asshole too, embarrassingly, felt strange.  He couldn&#39;t see that it was taking on a differently pinkish tone and somewhat bestial involuntary puckering.  Though his bowels grumbled to his growing worry, Tom had an even more troubling feeling that occupied his thoughts.<br />
<br />
Tom backed up to his bed, Kate and now Matt as well starting to approach him slowly, curious more than anything.  The sudden bump caused a lot of Tom to jiggle.  Mostly in places he didn&#39;t want it.  His chest and stomach, where a fattened belly and swelling rows of teats were almost clearly visible behind a swelling shirt.  At his hips, and ass, there was more fat, more weight, an odd feel to the hips and bones, that was totally unnatural.  But worse was what was failed to sway.  It came first like someone cupped his balls then they were slowly massaged down smaller and smaller, until they felt like just one, and then none.  And while feeling as hard as ever, he felt himself dwindle from a solid seven inches to something that he coudln&#39;t feel.  What replaced it was something warm, and growing.  And wet.<br />
<br />
Turning, Tom felt immediately dizzy and fell forward onto his bed, hands catching him before his new snout could hit the sheets.  His glasses tumbled off but he didn&#39;t need them to notice the piggish snout.  Breathing in, Tom almost felt a squeal even and had to cough and try and grit his teeth to hide it.  Tipping over had also caused much of his clothing to start ripping or popping at the seams, allowing excessive skin to poke out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to yourself?&quot; Kate asked, unable to see his face but definitely noticing the excess weight.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is insane,&quot; Matt said in amazement.  &quot;He&#39;s... he&#39;s turning into a real animal.  And he can&#39;t control that?&quot; <br />
<br />
As he heard the question, Tom desperately tried to stop his fingers from merging and looking more like trotters but it was no use.<br />
<br />
&quot;As far as the magic is concerned, the human part is wrong and whatever animal he thought of is what he&#39;s supposed to be,&quot; Kate answered, moving around the bed somewhat to try and see Tom&#39;s face.  &quot;So once his body is the way it should be, that&#39;s that.  He&#39;ll still remember a little bit.  The idea was for punishment, you know, so there was that shame aspect which you guys will have to deal with.  Sorry,&quot; she said with passing sincerity. <br />
<br />
Tom went to speak again but his voice felt even more constrained than before and now his ears were burning while his face felt like it was starting to take on weight too.  <br />
<br />
&quot;So we&#39;ll still be us?&quot; Matt ask with some hope, even while watching Tom&#39;s socks warped in shape and species.<br />
<br />
Kate covered her mouth to hide a laugh.  &quot;No.  More like passengers while instincts rules the body.  I&#39;ll bet Tom is getting pretty flooded right now with hormones and such, right, pal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Even before she asked, Tom&#39;s mind was being bombarded with images that his conscious was trying, and failing, it dismiss.  Soon though, after feeling the constant weight of them and Kate&#39;s words, there was little left to hold on to.  When looking down his snout, down to rather inflexible trotters, Tom sigh and let out a low squeal while he let his body relax.  <br />
<br />
&quot;My grand- had farm,&quot; Tom struggled to say, feeling his ass swell with more weight and asshole open.  &quot;Had huge, sow-&quot; was followed by a snort when he smelled it first.  The taxed fabric over his ass soiled before filling with mass.  <br />
<br />
Kate and the Matt gagged at the sudden rancid smell.  &quot;Oh my god,&quot; Matt recoiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crapping your pants?  Really are an animal... So you wanted to fuck the pig?  Gross,&quot; Kate said, sleeve up to cover his mouth and nose.<br />
<br />
Tom grunted, the weight of his excrement finally causing his pants to simple rip and be carried around down around what now very much looked like hindquarters.  Ass and thighs messy, and a few last plops after, Tom&#39;s new backside was in view.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to be the sow, but fatter... bigger,&quot; Tom snorted.  He let out a stream of hot urine from his new piss hole as if to silence any idea that he was male any longer, though the swollen and dripping sow&#39;s sex did most of the work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you&#39;re doing that, ugh,&quot; Kate said, hearing the bed start to creak under Tom&#39;s growing weight.<br />
<br />
Tom&#39;s heavy, porcine head turned to back to Matt.  Most of his friend has faded into a pig&#39;s visage but some of his eyes and strands of hair remained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt should,&quot; Tom suffered a small, uncontrolled burst of squeals before he continued, &quot;should be boar.  Fuck Tom full of piglets, oh God,&quot; a part of Tom still struggling against what was happening, managed to come out at the end.  Turning his head back, Tom snorted and could feel the weight bending under him.</p>
