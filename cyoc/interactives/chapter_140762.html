<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff had to think a bit about what kind of dream girlfriend that he would turn his father into. It didn’t take long for him to come to the conclusion that he would turn his father into a busty Latina, Jeff always thought Latina’s are some of the most beautiful women out there with their rich olive tan skin and luscious flowing hair nothing could beat that for him, plus Jeff always thought of himself more as a breast man than an butt man so making her busty was the obvious thing to do. <br />
Now that Jeff had an idea for if dream girlfriend he needed to program the Chronivac, filling in his father’s name the Chronivac produced his father’s profile and stats.<br />

<br />
Reading his father’s profile Jeff was surprised how many details it displays. Skimming through the stats Jeff got started on setting the transformation parameters, his father would begin his transformation a six and set the duration of the transformation to 1 hour. This way his father had some time to relax as he usually gets home just before six. Because he worked a nine to five job. Next Jeff programed the transformation from his dream girlfriend back to his father, starting it at 6:00 AM and ending it at 7 AM this way his father had two hours to wake up and get ready for work. Lastly Jeff turned his father’s awareness setting off and alter reality on to avoid any problems of people wondering where his father went and turn his user awareness to partly aware not wanting to forget his father but making “romantic” situations less awkward and weird. Satisfied Jeff started to fill in his new dream girlfriend’s stats.<br />

Happy with the transformation Jeff clicked the ‘start transformation’ button, a timer appeared on the screen counting down from 1:00:00 to 0:59:59, 0:59:58 above it was a progress bar and at the bottom it said ‘Thank you for choosing Chronivac’. Satisfied Jeff left his room and the Chronivac running as he headed downstairs to join his father soon to be girlfriend to watch the football game.<br />
Downstairs Jeff’s father was waiting for him to come downstairs and watch the game, the kickoff almost started as Jeff finally showed up. “Hey Jeff, what was taking you so long you almost missed the kickoff” his father said, Jeff quickly thought of an excuse for when he was programing the Chronivac “Sorry I still had some work for school left”. ” Ok school is more important than a football game did you finish it all?” his father asked “Yeah it’s all done” Jeff said sitting down next to his father on the sofa. <br />
Jeff took a good look at his father before the change would become visible, he was still wearing his dark grey business suit with a white shirt underneath. The game had started as Jeff father unbuttoned his jacket feeling a bit warm. Jeff took notice of it but didn’t think much of it. <br />
About ten minutes into the game Jeff looked over at his father. The first minor changes had already taken place. He looked a couple of years younger about forty maybe late thirties, his hair was fuller, darker and his bald spot was almost gone, and he lost some weight and Jeff was sure his father looked a bit tanner then before. Jeff’s father looked back Jeff as he was looking at him. Jeff turned back to the T.V. his father not thinking much of it he also turned back and continued watching.<br />
Twenty minutes in Jeff’s father squirmed a bit on the sofa, as his clothes felt tight. This drew Jeff’s attention from the game. His father looked like he was in his mid-thirties and had a full head of hair again. It even seemed to have lengthen a bit. Jeff asked what was bothering him. He said “My shirt feels a bit tight” as he readjusts himself on the sofa. As he said this Jeff looked at his father’s clothes they seemed to have change as well. His dark grey suit color had turned to a shade of blue. And his shirt did look tight in fact it looked as if it was a bit small for him, showing some skin which was now tanner than earlier. Looking at his father in his entirety he had slimmed down and even shrunk an inch or two giving him a smaller frame.    <br />
Now around thirty minutes in there was a commercial brake Jeff’s father got of the sofa and stretched. Giving Jeff a chance to look at his whole body and his first look at his father’s backside which was frimmer then before. Looking up his head his hair was now a dark brown and long enough to cover the back of his neck. His face looked more feminine as his jawline was rounder and softer, his nose seemed to have shrunk a bit, eyebrows were thinner, lips were fuller, and his eyes were somewhere between dark blue and brown. “I’m going to grab us something to drink, what do you want?” his father asked. Jeff couldn’t help it notice his farther now had an ever so slight accent and his voice was slightly higher pitched. “A glass of cola is fine” Jeff said, as his father started walking to the kitchen allowing Jeff to look the rest of him over. His body overall had shrunk he probably was about the same height as Jeff, his frame was also smaller as his shoulders were less wide and almost all his bodyfat was gone except for some that stayed on his rear and hips.   <br />
Entering the kitchen Jeff’s father grabbed two glasses from a cupboard and headed to the fridge. Opening it he first grabbed the cola and poured a glass for Jeff. Then turned back to the fridge to grab himself a beer, before changing his mind and grabbing the orange soda and pouring himself a glass. Grabbing both glasses he went walking back in to the living room, Jeff still on the sofa turned to look at his father as he enters with the drinks. Setting the drinks down on the table in front of them his father sat back down on the sofa. Jeff thought to himself how his father could now easily pass for a feminine half Latino cousin of his in his early thirties. Grabbing his drink Jeff realizing that his father got himself a glass of orange soda instead of his usual beer. Asking about his unusual choice of drink his father simply replied, “I just felt like a glass of orange soda”.<br />
 As his father grab his drink from the table Jeff looked at the changes to his father’s clothes which looked like they were tighter allover. The pants and jacket of his suit are now a lighter shade of blue than it was earlier, their texture looked differed, and their buttons had shrunk in size. The front of the jacket had started to grow towards each other and the sleeves of his jacket and the legs of his pants are a lot shorter showing his wrists and ankles, both of which were pretty much hairless. Because of the shorter legs on his father’s pants Jeff could see that his socks also had shorten. Looking further down at his father’s shoes they look more faded than their original black color, were smoother overall, their laces were smaller, and the heel had raised a bit at the back. Moving his eyes backup Jeff briefly looked at the rather small bulge in his father’s tight pants. Quickly moving on to his father’s shirt that like the rest of his suit had shorten showing just the bottom of his bellybutton. Also, like the rest of the suit the buttons had shrunk, and its color had change but to a light shade of gray. Putting his drink back on the table Jeff’s father notice Jeff staring at him. “Don’t tell me that you changed your mind and want an orange soda instead of cola” he said, “What… no I was just thinking when the last time I had orange soda” Jeff quickly said. Luckily before his father could ask any more question the commercial break was over, and the game continued drawing both their attention back to the T.V.  <br />
Now a total of forty minutes in the game Jeff’s father readjusts himself on the sofa as the changes to his clothes once more gave him some minor discomfort. Like before this drew Jeff’s focus away from the game. Looking at his father Jeff notice something strange about the changes to his clothes, it looked like the bottom of his jacket and the top of his pants had started to fuse with each other at the back. The suit’s buttons are so small their almost nonexistent, any pockets and seams the jacket and pants had were barely visible and the color was now a lighter shade of blue. The sleeves had shortened to the point that they were just past the elbows.  The legs of his pants to had shortened now showing half of his shins, who just like his arms now seemed completely hairless. His shoes now had a little hole’s in the front that just revealed the tips of his big toe’s. The laces looked like they had fuse to the top of the shoes and had started to fade, the heel was now clearly raised as had the rest of the soles of the shoes had increased in height. Going back up to his shirt which now had shrunk to the point it only covered his father’s chest it’s buttons like the other were almost completely gone and its color was now a deep gray. But as Jeff was inspecting the shirt he notices two very small bumps under the shirt. The presence of which made Jeff ever so slightly excited.<br />
Jeff caught himself staring as his father once again started squirming on the sofa. The reason for his discomfort were the changes to his underwear, as it had grown tight and uncomfortable around his greatly diminished manhood. Jeff asked if everything was alright “Yeah, nothing bad just some minor thing” his father said as he slightly tugged on the side of his pants to readjust his underwear. As his father talked to him Jeff took note of the fact that his father’s voice was now a slightly higher pitch. Looking at his father’s face it had taken on a more feminine form as it’s features had soften some more and his hair was now hanging just above his shoulders. As his father turned back to watch the game, Jeff quickly looked him over. As his waist was now thinner, hips wider and shoulders slimmer it would be difficult to think of his father as a young man in his mid-twenties rather than a somewhat masculine lady.<br />
Roughly fifty minutes had passed from when the game started, and Jeff’s father was about to undergo an important change. As underneath his pants His testicles were sucked into his body forming ovaries and his already diminished penis shrunk even further forming a clitoris as underneath it a new vagina opened. Making him now officially a her. When this happened Jeff’s, mind felt a bit foggy as thoughts and memories of Anita began to surface and those of his father felt like they were being pushed to the background of his mind. This caused Jeff to start rubbing his head, as the almost completely transformed Anita scooted closer to Jeff on the sofa asking, “Is everything alright Jeffy?”. Jeff stopped rubbing and said “Yeah, everything is fine, probably just a bit dizzy from the T.V.” he said half-jokingly. Anita just looked at him and smiled and nodded. As Anita turned back to the T.V. Jeff thought to himself that what he just felt must have been the awareness changes kick in as he now had memories of him and Anita though still remembering his father. As for her appearance Anita now had dark brown shoulder length hair with a slight wave to it. As she idly brushes some of it aside Jeff caught a quick glance of something small and shiny on her ear, this was the beginning of an earring forming on her earlobe. Her face was now that of a Latina woman in her early twenties with a small nose, full lips, soft round jawline and her eyes which were now brown of color. Looking down as she leaned a bit on his shoulder she now was a bit shorter then him and her body had a clear feminine shape to it a smaller waist, wider hips, thicker thighs and two mounds that had grown on her chests. Though they were nothing to write home about, yet it was heading the right way for Jeff.  Looking at the mounds Jeff attention switches to what is covering them as the former shirt had now shrunk to just cover her chest. Its neck was deeper, the buttons were all gone and it color had changed into a solid black. The black was stark contrast to the light blue of the jacket and pants which now had completely fused. All buttons, seems and pockets had disappeared the whole thing looked like some strange one-piece jumper. Its legs were just above the knees now and the sleeves were now barely covering her shoulders. The front of the thing looked like an incredibly deep V-neck as it went all the way down to the top off the bellybutton, though it looked like this V-neck was slowly closing itself. Looking further down past her shapely legs Jeff saw that her shoes had now split on multiple places and their noses were gone revealing all her toes which were small and dainty. The color of the shoes was now a muted brown and the heel and soles overall had been raised.<br />
While downstairs the game was playing on the T.V. upstairs the Chonivac was filling its progression bar and below it was a countdown reaching its final seconds …0:00:03, 0:00:02, 0:00:01 and finally 0:00:00 as the screen displayed “transformation complete”. Downstairs the game had ended as Jeff got of the sofa with Anita, he could now look upon his now fully transformed dream girlfriend. Her wavy dark brown hair now reaches past her shoulder, her face was soft with some minimal makeup her lips kissable and her eyes a beautiful brown color. Her skin is now the olive tan Jeff always thought of a sexy. Her body was great for a sixteen-year-old nice hips, thighs, waist but above all for Jeff were her C-cup breast firmly planted on her chest. All of which was covered by a light blue sleeveless dress that displayed ample cleavage. The shirt she once wore is now a black bra supporting her breasts and her underwear now is a matching pair of black panties. Lastly, she was wearing a pair of sandy brown high soled sandals making her just a bit shorter than Jeff.<br />
As Jeff was looking at his new girlfriend she said “So Jeffy now the game has ended should we get something to eat?” she asked in her new accented voice. Jeff suddenly thought to himself it may have been handy to had have some dinner ready, so he said, “I was thinking of ordering something, pizza maybe”. Anita answered with “Pizza sounds fine to me” giving Jeff a little peck on the lips before sitting back down on the sofa and grabbing the remote. Jeff pulled his phone from his pocket and started calling the pizzeria, while ordering he asked if Anita wanted something extra on it to which she replied “extra peppers, you know I like it picante” Jeff smiled as he order the pizza. A couple of minutes later the pizza had arrived and Jeff went to the door to pay for it, as Anita went to the kitchen to refill their drinks. The two of them sitting back down on the sofa with their drinks and pizza cuddling up next to each other watching some random crime series.</p>
