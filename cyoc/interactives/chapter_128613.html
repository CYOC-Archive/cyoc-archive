<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the testing went on the Animalia PD&#39;s headquarters, Animalia&#39;s other Ceratopsian was on his way to the Claw Coliseum. Brett Horne was clean and had clothing that would fit him, though with the horns on his frill, any shirt that wasn&#39;t a button down shirt had to be very stretchy in order to fit around those horns. The biggest thing was that he presently had a place to stay that was fairly nice. It mirrored some of the places that had been built and set aside for Rhinoceros Animalians, which he guessed was in expectation of a large number of Rhinoceros Animalian births in the coming years as they took mates and procreated.<br />
<br />
And for Brett, it was of sufficient size for him, but then Ceratopsians weren&#39;t the largest of dinosaurs. They weren&#39;t small, as the largest Triceratops in the fossil record was around thirty feet long and the largest Styracosaurus was around eighteen feet long, but they weren&#39;t as tall as the Theropod Dinotopians and certainly not as tall as the Sauropod Dinotopians. That enabled Brett to fit in the home he&#39;d been given fairly well. And once he got things related to his home in order, he moved on to the next order of business, the Mesozoic Fight Club. As it was why he&#39;d not only chosen to join Animalia but to join Project Mesozoic.<br />
<br />
Brett knew that Animalia had deals with the leagues that ran the various combat sports leagues, be it boxing, pro &quot;wrestling,&quot; MMA, and so on. As far as he knew it was those arrangements with those companies and leagues that had helped lead to the construction of the Claw Coliseum in the first place. He&#39;d also seen a fair number of ads that related to the &quot;Mesozoic Fight Club&quot; which was being advertised as a future MMA league that would cater to Dinotopians specifically, but at present there weren&#39;t enough Dinotopians to really begin arranging matches and going into the assorted theatrics of who the best &quot;fighter&quot; was. Brett figured that probably wouldn&#39;t come until the summer when Project Mesozoic was supposed to become open to the public, however, that wasn&#39;t going to stop Brett from signing up.<br />
<br />
As he entered the front doors, Brett noticed a large signboard that had all the directions that would be needed and found that the organization that ran and coordinated the various professional MMA/UFC leagues was in an office area on its second floor. He noted that office number and approached the front desk, just to let the person manning it know where he was headed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, I&#39;m just going up to the MMA/UFC office,&quot; Brett announced, &quot;see what they&#39;d want to know about signing up and so forth...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joining the Mesozoic Fight Club?&quot; the Mule Deer Animalian chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Brett answered slowly and with a weak smile, &quot;I&#39;m Brett Horne... I had called...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Mule Deer Animalian nodded, &quot;You are expected. I&#39;ll let him know you&#39;re on your way up. Do you need directions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can manage, thank you,&quot; Brett answered and then moved toward a nearby flight of stairs.<br />
<br />
He did so, though as he made his way toward the stairs, he could overhear the Mule Deer Animalian speaking into an intercom at his desk. This likely was letting the men running the combat sports league on Brett&#39;s arrival and approach. Brett, however, paid that no mind and simply made his way across the floor and up the stairs. And as he arrived on the second floor, he found that area entered into what would definitely look more like the internal hallways of an office building rather than a sports arena in that the floor was carpeted. The hallway he&#39;d entered was rather straight and there were series of doors that often had a signboard that identified certain companies. This included things like Fox Sports and ESPN with regard to sports reporting. There was a sign that was marked as for the IAC, which he guessed was Animalia&#39;s equal to the Olympic Committee. Eventually he came to a sign that read: MMA, UFC, UFC-A, Mesozoic Fight Club (MFC). Underneath that was the name Marcus Pennington. Brett looked at it and then slowly knocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come in,&quot; a voice came from inside the office and Brett entered to see a well dressed man coming from around a desk to shake his hand. The man was human and the man&#39;s hand&#39;s seemed to disappear inside Brett&#39;s as they shook hands. &quot;You must be Brett, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Brett nodded, &quot;Brett Horne. I was hoping to join the Mesozoic Fight Club... get back into professional competition, if you catch my meaning.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man, Marcus Pennington nodded and walked back to the other side of his desk, &quot;Yes... I can and I do... though... I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m afraid my chairs aren&#39;t big enough support all that muscle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett blinked and looked down to the chairs that sat opposite Marcus&#39;s desk. They were bigger than what one would expect for a human, likely to support Animalia&#39;s horses, bulls, and perhaps even getting to the uplifted elephants. However, the Dinotopians were representing a series of much larger size classes. He remembered seeing some of the news reports on Andrew, the largest Dinotopian at present if one went by weight, and seeing that he easily exceeded the uplifted Giraffe&#39;s in height and the uplifted Elephant&#39;s in weight. That was something of a testament to how large Dinosaurs were.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Brett commented, &quot;a lot of Animalia is probably still pretty new to a lot of people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That it is,&quot; Marcus smiled, &quot;but in a way... it is an intriguing society. They&#39;re not averse to competition in the sense of sports and that includes combat sports... but they seem to be rather pacifistic politically... It&#39;s all amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a bad thing, if you think on it,&quot; Brett commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; Marcus nodded, &quot;there may be certain issues that relate to certain political realities... but in the end, I do agree. However... that isn&#39;t why you&#39;re here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Brett nodded, &quot;I came to join the Mesozoic Fight Club... compete and show how strong I can be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we would be more than happy to have your participation,&quot; Marcus spoke, &quot;so long as you remember that our organization does not support the use of LETHAL force in matches and we do not support underground fighting. That could get you hurt and have the potential to go beyond the law.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett looked down for a moment and then spoke, &quot;I... I think I&#39;ve learned my lesson on that. I started with boxing and that sort of thing, but I never really had the right coaches and thus never had the right &quot;form&quot; as it were... and things snowballed from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett looked down his gray scale skinned muzzle with the large horn rising up just behind his nose. He new that the Mesozoic Fight Club was a chance to get back in the game as it were, but after seeing his leg greatly weakened in an underground match that went wrong for him and six months in prison on charges related to unlawful fighting and so on, he knew that had he made smarter choices earlier in his life he might not have had to go through Project Phoenix/Mesozoic, and if he became an Animalian, it would be because he WANTED to be one, not because he HAD to be one.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I could go back and do things differently... I would,&quot; Brett spoke to Marcus as he looked back up and saw the man looking back at him with a rather serious look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Marcus said after a moment, &quot;because right now with a limited number of Dinotopians signing up for the Mesozoic Fight Club, we don&#39;t at present have the ability to set matches and arranging individual coaches. Most of the members we have are in a place to practice and show their strength with dummies and bricks that they can break and so on. And that works well... but we also want to make sure that our organization can retain control on the situation so that all these sorts of matches have doctors and trainers present so that the health of both the competitors and spectators are protected.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And with your past record... you could be of value to the Mesozoic Fight Club not only as a competitor but as an organizer and means to show the importance of playing things by the book,&quot; Marcus spoke, &quot;the underground fight clubs that often go against the law and leave those in them in a position to be hurt... And they retain some measure of attractiveness to those that haven&#39;t done well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you want me to be part of a campaign to illustrate the problems underground fighting rings,&quot; Brett surmised.<br />
<br />
&quot;And organize the PR campaign,&quot; Marcus nodded, &quot;We have ideas for it... and we have the plans to move forward with it while we&#39;re waiting for more people not only join Project Mesozoic but join the Mesozoic Fight Club.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett thought for a moment and then nodded, &quot;I&#39;ll do it. To stand up for what is right.&quot;</p>
