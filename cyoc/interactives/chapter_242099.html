<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After their intense orgasm, Alice and Jake lay on the bed, basking in the warm afterglow. Alice can still feel Jake&#39;s spandex clinging to her body, his fabric soaked with her arousal. She runs her hands over his surface, feeling every inch of his tight, stretchy form. &quot;That was amazing, my love. I loved every second of it.&quot; Jake&#39;s thoughts are filled with satisfaction and contentment. *I loved it too. I love being your swimsuit and bringing you pleasure. It&#39;s what I exist for.* Alice smiles, feeling happy and fulfilled. But then she hears an alarm coming from her wrist. She looks down and sees that the emitter&#39;s battery is running low. &quot;Oh no, Jake. I have to transform you back now.&quot; *What? Already? I don&#39;t want to stop being your swimsuit yet.* &quot;I&#39;m sorry, my dear, but the emitter says we have only five minutes left before it runs out of battery. I don&#39;t want to risk to loose the energy field and you&#39;d retransform uncontrolled. It is said that this is safe but not necessarily pleasant.&quot; She stands up and opens the zipper on his front, revealing her naked body inside. She slowly peels Jake off her skin, starting at the zipper and working her way down. She can feel his fabric clinging to her, reluctant to let go. &quot;We have to do this. But we can always transform you again later.&quot; Finally, she pulls Jake off her legs and holds the empty swimsuit in her hands. She looks at him, admiring his sleek, black form. &quot;You were amazing, Jake. I love wearing you.&quot; *I love being worn by you, Alice. And I hope this transformation into a human will be worth it.* Alice smiles and places Jake on the bed. She turns on the laptop and the Transform-O-Matic, making sure everything is set up correctly for Jake&#39;s retransformation. She clicks on the button and the red beam scans the swimsuit. The transformation process begins and Alice watches as Jake&#39;s body slowly starts to change. His spandex fabric separates and begins to flatten. His legs and hips take on a more human shape, and his skin regains its natural texture and color. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s happening again. Your body is coming back,&quot; Alice says, her eyes fixed on the transformation. The beam moves up Jake&#39;s body, reshaping his torso and arms. His chest and stomach emerge, and then his hands and shoulders take form. His head begins to take shape, his face and features becoming more distinct with each passing moment. Jake takes a deep breath as the transformation finishes, and he sits up on the bed, looking around in wonder. &quot;Wow, I&#39;m back,&quot; he says, his voice shaking slightly. &quot;That was incredible. I loved every second of being your swimsuit.&quot; Alice smiles and hugs him tightly. &quot;I loved every second of wearing you, my dear.&quot; They hold each other for a moment, basking in the warmth and intimacy of their connection. Finally, Alice pulls back and looks into Jake&#39;s eyes. &quot;Are you okay? You seemed a bit strange when you were the swimsuit. At least shortly before we went onto the slide and when we were in the hot tub.&quot; Jake hesitates, trying to put his thoughts into words. &quot;I don&#39;t know. It was like... I was so focused on being the swimsuit and bringing you pleasure that I forgot about everything else. My mind was consumed by that single purpose. And it felt amazing, but also a bit strange, like I was losing myself in it somehow.&quot; Alice listens intently, her brow furrowed in concern and Jake continues. &quot;I think there was something with this animated GIF that you sent me. It all started after I saw it in my mind.&quot; Alice looks confused. &quot;Animated GIF? What do you mean, my love?&quot; Jake shakes his head, trying to remember. &quot;I don&#39;t know. You sent me some kind of picture, I think it was, and it really threw me off. Then I just had this feeling that something wasn&#39;t quite right. Like my thoughts weren&#39;t really my own.&quot; Alice&#39;s eyes widen as she realizes what might have happened. &quot;Oh no. I think I know what you mean. I sent you a message and a picture when we were talking to Emma. I didn&#39;t think it would affect you like that.&quot; Jake looks at her, confusion and concern etched on his face. &quot;What was in that message? And what picture did you send?&quot; Alice hesitates, feeling a bit guilty. &quot;I don&#39;t remember exactly. But I think I told you something like I was aroused and needed to release it. And the picture was just some random animated GIF I found online. But there was also this message popping up that our Bluetooth connection was disrupted and that there could be glitches. I ignored it and sent it anyway.&quot; Jake&#39;s eyes widen in understanding. &quot;That must have been it. The glitch must have affected my mind somehow. I felt so different after that, like my thoughts weren&#39;t really my own. It was like I was trapped in being just a swimsuit.&quot; Alice nods, feeling regretful. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Jake. I didn&#39;t realize it could have that effect. I should have been more careful.&quot; Jake shakes his head. &quot;It&#39;s okay, my love. We&#39;ll be more careful in the future. But it was still an amazing experience, even with that glitch. And to be honest, it felt pretty similar to the transformations where we adapted my mind to the object. I felt so focused on bringing you pleasure and being your swimsuit.&quot; Alice smiles softly, relieved that Jake isn&#39;t upset. &quot;I love that you were able to enjoy it despite the glitch. And I have to say, wearing you as this swimsuit felt incredible. You were amazing.&quot; Jake grins. &quot;And you were amazing wearing me. I could feel everything, your every movement, your pleasure. It was intoxicating.&quot; They lean in and share a passionate kiss, still basking in the warmth of their intimacy. As they pull back, Alice looks into Jake&#39;s eyes. &quot;I&#39;m so glad we can experience this together. I love you, my darling.&quot; &quot;I love you too,&quot; Jake replies, his eyes shining with affection.<br />
<br />
Then he asks her about Emma. &quot;I didn&#39;t hear what Emma said. And I was a little distracted from clinging to you. Do have her number? And do you think she can convince Mike?&quot;</p>
