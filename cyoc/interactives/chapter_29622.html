<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Barbie looked around the park to make sure no one noticed, Barbie then realized that while Jackie looked geeky, there was a cuteness to it. Some guy might go for that kind of look. Now, Barbie couldn't have THAT...oh well, she'd just have to make his punishment worse. <br />
<br />
She first took stock of what she looked like now. Jackie was about 5'6 now, as opposed to her 5'10 from before. She had the purple hair and eyes which actually were attractive. Her body was thinner, but still had some tone and curves to it, even some ass in the back that wasn't the diaper alone. Jackie's a-cup breasts seemed perky beneath the white shirt of the uniform, and the skirt complimented her nicely. Her face seemed average, and the round glasses only served to make her look cute. Yes, to leave her like this wouldn't have been very smart. She'd have to get more drastic with the changes.<br />
<br />
First, she went to the physical form. A few quick slides of he bar, and Jackie was now sporting a pair of scrawny legs, very skinny. Her body straightened out, her hips looking much more boyish. This was followed by her hips narrowing and her ass becoming flat, the bulge now really coming from her diaper.<br />
<br />
Next was her height. A few bar strokes, and Jackie had a whole new perspective. High school was always so hard on shorter kids...but Barbie had a feeling it would only get worse with Jackie now a mere 4'10. She shrunk the uniform to keep her clothed.<br />
<br />
Then to her chest. As cruel as it had been making Jackie have only an a-cup, they were still perky. And she had even met a few guys at school who preferred small-chested girl. Well, there was only one thing to do there. Without remorse, Barbie grinned as she slid the counter bar to 0. She watched as Jackie's chest deflated under the uniform, till she had the cleavage of a pre-schooler.<br />
<br />
Cool.<br />
<br />
Barbie felt a giddy rush. To be able to do this to someone...it was almost too much fun.<br />
<br />
Almost.<br />
<br />
Then, it only took a few short seconds to make her upper body scrawny enough to match her lower body. Barbie was forced to shrink the uniform again just to keep poor Jackie decent.<br />
<br />
Next was her voice. The chronovac stated it was currently a soft alto. Cute. But a girl that was starting to look this nerdy shouldn't get cute, should she? Just a quick flick of the switch, and Jackie would soon be talking in a semi-loud, very high, and very unattractively nasally voice. Oh yes, the boys would LOVE that. Heh...almost as much as the new lisp that would make her &quot;thpeak like thith&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now her face. That homely, cute face. Well, a few adjustments would fix that. First, Barbie  changed her skin tone. It went from a decent tan, to pale, and then a lax, very white pale, like she'd never see nthe sun. It only served to over-emphasize her scrawny body...that, and the new, large amount of freckles appearing on her cheeks and nose. Not good for her complexion. Though, neither was the thicker, longer nose that begins to dominate her face. Or the large, rounded, mouse-like ears that pushed away from her head. Good thing she had hair to hide them...or did anyway. Barbie soon finished giving her hair a maek-over. It was now very frizzy and greasy, with strands sticking out. It suddenly snaked into two sloppy pigtails, one higher than the other, with pink ribbons sloppily tying them up.<br />
<br />
Then her mouth. A few slides here and there, and Jackie was soon &quot;enjoying&quot; a large overbite as her lower jaw shifted back, and the mousy look the ears made was furthered by a set of buckteeth. Thick metal braces soon completed the picture.<br />
<br />
Then those eyes. The purple was cute, but not for long, and soon they looked dull. Jackie's glasses underwent a change, going from big and round, to big, square, and horn-rimmed. They were a thick, plastic black, and taped in the middle.<br />
<br />
Barbie then used a temporary freeze time function to stop and admire her work. Not bad. If there ever ended up being a group for nerds, Jackie here would be the poster-child. She wouldn't be getting a date any time soon, unless there was a guy that was this much of a dork. Hm...she did know a few people she could change with this...but later. She still had work to do.<br />
<br />
That skirt could use some work. Barbie fiddled a bit, and was soon rewarded with the site of Jackie in a pair of dirty, large, suspender overalls. The uniform shirt had become a too large, tucked in, frumpy purple sweater, with pink lace at the cuffs and neck. As an afterthought, Barbie added a small pocket protector to the eyesore, and made sure she had a nervous habit of picking at the lace when feeling shy. An inhaler on a silver chain appeared around her neck.<br />
<br />
AH much better. She couldn't have done better work. Just some more mental changes, and she'd be completely finished.<br />
<br />
First, she made Jackie even more afraid of sex, yet upped her want for it a bit. Oh what a horror high school would be. A cute freshmen geek would have been tricky...but this was impossible. She'd be forced out of every clique, made to be forced to hang out with others like her. Though, after all the bullying he did in junior high, he deserved it. SHe then slid a few more bars, leaving Jackie too shy for words, and without a hint of leader qualities. She lost any fashion sense, or sense of how to act 'popular', and suddenly gained a love for anime, reading, chess, computers, and school. Especially school. Wouldn't she be surprised to find that she loved doing her homework, staying late after in the library poring over books, always being such a good student. Barbie could barely contain herself. And when someone found out about the diaper...oh, the sweet sense of revenge.<br />
<br />
A few last tweaks were in order. A lump of clumsiness, a large dash of meekness and timidity, the loss of her ability to break rules (leaving her such a goody-twoshoes and tattle tale) an extreme shyness reaction to boys, and a laugh like a donkey. Hmm...oh, and some loud snorting randomly. That was always good for a laugh. She then entered a fwe commands, taking away Jackie's ability to curse, replacing it with stupid sub words like 'golly gee'. Oh, this was too funny.<br />
<br />
She checked the chronovac really quick. Jackie's social life had take a dive. Poor her, going from many friends as a guy, to only 2 as a girl, and both like her. Poor dear.<br />
<br />
Leaving Jackie with a backpack full of textbooks (which she would soon find quite heavy), Barbie started time up again and then set off. Hm...maybe to find Jackie a guy like her...</p>
