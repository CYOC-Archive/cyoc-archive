<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A man named Trent, who lives alone but also gay and a furry, was relaxing in his living room in his boxers and letting loose. Trent gets horny easily and every time he sees one picture of gay yiff, he gets hard, he just can’t help it. There was a knock at Trent’s door, he walks to it and sees a package, but didn’t see anyone who could have knocked. Trent picked up the package and went back inside. He opened the package and sees some usb and a disk for some amazing and advance program. Looking at the manual and seeing this program called the chronivac can change your body and or life. Trent thought it was a joke, but he still went to get his laptop and placed it on the living room table, put the usb in, then insert the disk. “Installing Program… Please wait.” <br />
Trent waited and hoped this is not some virus he’s putting in his computer. “Installation complete, have fun.” Just then a window popped up and showed all kinds of changes he could do to him or others. “This can’t be real, but I guess I could try it out, now… What should I do first?” Trent looked down at his crotch and already got an idea. He went through some packages related to animal like changes, he finds some more specific kinds of changes, like body part changes. “If this thing really works, I’m gonna be the happiest man.” Trent was excited and hoping it really does work. Trent went to change his penis into a horse cock and changed him cum endless, he made sure he made it thick and long. Trent thought of what else he could do, he thought he should make himself look like fursona as well. <br />
Trent sees an option saying, “Alter Reality” and he already knew what that meant. “Making changes… Please wait.” Trent’s computer estimated the change to take at least an hour. “I guess I can continue watching TV while I wait.” Trent said as he sat back, kicked up his feet on the table and started to fall asleep. An hour and a half later, Trent wakes up and was too tired to see his new body, he walked to the bathroom to piss. Trent felt his cock and noticed something odd, he looked down and shouted. “No fucking way!” Trent was so happy to see his cock was replaced by a sheath of a horse. Trent looked in the mirror, he looked exactly like his fursona, a fox with a horse cock, he couldn’t believe it. Trent thought he was dreaming for a second, but it feels too real to be a dream, he then felt something in his ass.<br />
Trent bent over and looked at the mirror, he anus was very loose and dripping with cum. He was wondering why his ass is like that already but then remembered he made his fursona a cum slut, so now he’s a cum slut. Trent went into his room and got a big horse dildo. He placed the dildo on the floor and squatted over it pointed it at his ass, lowering and shoving the dildo far in. Very soon, Trent’s horse cock got very hard, it was at least 14 inches long, he started to jerk off and moaned loudly. Didn’t take long until Trent started to cum, it was so much, it got all over the walls. Trent then got the horse dildo all the way in him, he then sees he got cum all over the walls, he thought he could clean it up later. Trent took the dildo out and played around with his very loose anus.<br />
 Very soon, Trent went back to the living room and laid down on the couch, looking at his paw feet, he then sat up and moved his left foot paw to his face and sniffed, he loved the smell, he began licking it all over. Trent was enjoying himself very much. Just then there was knock at this door, the voice at his door sound like his friend, Alex, Trent put on his boxers before opening the door, when he did, an anthro wolf stood there. “Hey Trent!” Alex said while he walks in. “So, what do you need?” Trent asks as he picks up he laptop and puts it away. “What? Can’t a guy hang out with his boyfriend?” Trent was a little confused, Alex was his close friend, but he doesn’t remember being his boyfriend, maybe it’s part the change, he did alter reality, but he didn’t expect it to change the world that much, but he did had a crush on Alex before, so he would be fine with it.<br />
“So, what do you want to do?” Trent asks as he sat on the couch. “Honestly, I just wanna relax, I had a long day.” Alex sat next to Trent, Alex laid on one end, and Trent laid on the other end, they both watch TV and suddenly, Alex touches Trent’s face with his foot paw, Trent looked over. “You know you want these sexy paws.” Alex says as he shoved his foot paw in Trent’s face, Trent then shoved his in Alex’s face, they both begin to lick each other’s feet paws. “I love your paws so much Alex.” Trent says and continues to lick. “Thanks, I love your paws.” Alex says. After they were done they both go back to watching TV and eventually falling asleep.</p>
