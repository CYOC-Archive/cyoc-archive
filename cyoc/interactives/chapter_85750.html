<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Caleb raised his arm so that he could wipe the sweat off his brow. Once he could tell that he was producing an offensive odor, he decided that he would have to shower before he could be presentable to anyone else.  Fortunately, he had brought a change of clothes and he could get soap and shampoo from his locker.<br />
<br />
Most people, especially on the weekends, would not shower at school, so Caleb figured he was alone. Whatever.  He went to his locker and pulled out a towel and began to take off his sweaty basketball clothes.<br />
<br />
A few minutes ago, Luke had come in to the locker room from the tennis courts.  He and a friend had just finished playing a few sets, but Luke had to use the bathroom before he went home.  Luke had gone to the stalls and found one that was acceptable, then closed the door and began to do his business.<br />
<br />
It was very quiet in the locker room , so it was not surprising when Luke clearly heard Caleb enter the room and open his locker.<br />
<br />
Luke’s heart leapt with excitement.  It was certainly an unexpected development that he was now alone in the showers with his secret crush.  The two boys had lived in the same neighborhood since they were about 5, and they were good friends right up until they started high school.  It wasn&#39;t a falling out or anything, they just started to run with different crowds.<br />
<br />
And now, here they were.  Luke slowly and very quietly got up from the toilet and pulled the door open very gently.  He was able to see from his vantage point that Caleb was getting soap and shampoo out of his locker.  This was getting even better; Caleb was going to take a shower!<br />
<br />
Luke ducked back into his stall, fortunate that the showers were the other way, and he could wait until Caleb walked over to them to make his move.  Caleb came out and, &quot;knowing&quot; that no one was around, he walked around the corner holding his towel and toiletries in his hand.  He was completely nude otherwise.  When Luke got his first glimpse of Caleb&#39;s prize piece bouncing over his nuts as he walked to the showers, Luke&#39;s own scepter rose instantly.  Just that would have been enough for Luke to take home and use as jack-off material for weeks, but Luke had to make his move.  He wanted to see it up close, to see it hard, to feel it in his hands.<br />
<br />
Luke heard the water start up, and he quickly shed all of his clothes and shoes.  His pink twizzler bobbed up and down over his peanut sack as he creeped along towards the showers.  The communal shower was set up in a large area with shower heads all along the three walls, and Caleb was standing in the far corner, in perfect view from where Luke was able to hide out.<br />
<br />
Standing underneath the flow of the shower, naked as a jay bird, Caleb&#39;s entire body was on display, and it was beautiful.  He was completely wet; the water dripping down his tanned skin, rolling over every crevice and vein.  Caleb had his arm cocked back, flexing out his triceps slightly, as he took a bar of soap and ran it up and down the crack of his ass.  As he finished soaping up, he turned to face where Luke was standing.  His arms were behind him, washing the soap from his anus.  But in front of him, with a small stream of water dripping down from the head, was the most gorgeous male genitalia that Luke had ever seen in person.  The dick was soft, but it still had respectable length to it as it hung forward from the groin and rested over his dark, hairy, heavy nutsack.<br />
<br />
Luke breathed out, not realizing that he&#39;d been holding it in as his eyes were feasting on Caleb&#39;s body.  Caleb looked and figured that it was just his imagination, for Luke was still just out of his sight line.  So he simply went back to the soap and began to lather up under his balls, preparing to clean his family jewels.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Luke made his bold move.  If Caleb reacted the wrong way, Luke could end up beaten up, or &#39;outed&#39; to the entire school, ruining his social life.  On the other hand, the risk might justify the reward...<br />
Luke stepped forward, still nude and hard, and introduced himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Caleb.&quot;</p>
