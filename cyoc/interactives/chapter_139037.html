<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Fuck! Fuck!&quot;, she whispered loudly to herself, her eyes scanning the bathroom for a towel that wasn&#39;t too cum-stained. She saw one hanging on the back of the door: off-white, thankfully. &quot;Mom? Anyone? Can you get the door?&quot; she yelled, wiping the cum off of her face and body. In her anxiety the once-massive penis had retreated to a more stealthy size, and she was thankful for that. The now 4-inch member hung over her pussy, off of which she was carefully cleaning cum.<br />
<br />
Now cleaned up, she heard the doorbell ring again. She grabbed her phone to see a message from her mother: &quot;Out tonight sweetie. Love u, take care&quot;. There was another, from a new friend at school named Emma: &quot;coming over, need to talk&quot;. So it was Emma at the door. She felt adrenaline rush through her body; the thought of any friend seeing her like this terrified her, but she was also a little nervous. Emma was fucking sexy.<br />
<br />
She climbed down the stairs in her towel and grabbed the door. &quot;Oh shit, sorry, I didn&#39;t know you were...&quot; Emma looked away, her brunette hair swinging cutely across her shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s ok, we&#39;re friends - come on in!&quot; Jennifer stole a peak at Emma&#39;s ass as she walked in. &#39;Tight little thing,&#39; she thought to herself. Feeling her dick start to swell, she quickly canceled the notion of it and thought about the flecks in the paint on the wall.<br />
<br />
Emma started towards the stairs for the bedroom, but Jennifer (after watching her figure turn and step for a few seconds) blurted out &quot;No, um, we can&#39;t go up there! It&#39;s too, er, messy!&quot; Emma started back down, confused but accepting. &#39;God... perky tits... thin waist... perfect legs... I want that pussy.&#39; She couldn&#39;t stop it this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t we go up there? We hang out all the time in your mess of a room.&quot; A thin smile crossed Emma&#39;s lips, and her head tilted to the side. &quot;Are you alright? You look a little - flushed.&quot; She couldn&#39;t help but notice Jen&#39;s nipples, barely visible through the towel, and instinctively scanned the rest of her figure. Her vagina got a bit warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m just, well, just had a shower, you see. Hot water and all that...&quot; she turned to hide her gradually-swelling penis, but the shape of it as it swung was too much for the towel. Emma, already attentive, thought she saw it but wasn&#39;t sure. Besides, Jennifer&#39;s nice, round butt was enough to look at anyway. &quot;Why don&#39;t we sit down on the couch? Mom&#39;s gone for the night - if I know her, might be another weekend-sort-of-thing.&quot; Emma was happy to oblige.<br />
<br />
Seated opposite Jennifer, she started &quot;So there&#39;s this kid at school... I think you know him. Kyle? That sound familiar?&quot; The name seemed to ring a bell in Jennifer&#39;s mind, but she couldn&#39;t really pinpoint it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure... maybe?&quot; she replied. Her mind was wandering, too... Emma&#39;s legs were open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well anyway, he texted me to come and see you. Except he spelled it with a &#39;u&#39;. Either he&#39;s a dumbass or a fucking perv. But I thought maybe you knew him, so here I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen had heard the words, but was in another place mentally. Her erection, around 7 inches again, had started to rise, and her precum rolled down the leather couch to the depression made by her balls. These, too, were growing heavier and fuller by the second.<br />
<br />
Now Emma had no doubt. &quot;Oh my god, is that? You have a... a...&quot; Jen, coming back ti earth a bit, quickly pushed her hands over it, but it was too late. Emma walked over to her and held her hands. A new look was in her eye, and she could feel herself getting wetter and warmer. &quot;It&#39;s ok... it can be our little secret.&quot; Jen leaned back against the couch, her eyes rolling into her skull and her dick throbbing.<br />
<br />
Emma reached a hand under the towel and grabbed the cock, her other hand rubbing her pussy through her leggings. She wasted no time in fitting it into her mouth. It was not quite rock-hard; there was a sponge-like texture to it, but it had weight nonetheless. It was, however, still getting thicker, and it approached the girth of her forearm before spurting two or three jets of hot cum onto her face and dribbling much more into the couch. &quot;Did you just - cum?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer, deep in ectasy, had not noticed the ejaculation. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she panted, mumbling and high pitched, &quot;don&#39;t... stop&quot;.<br />
<br />
Emma&#39;s pussy was dripping, soaking through her panties. She could no longer fight the urge to thrust her fingers into them, rubbing her tight pussy lips and sliding her bony fingers along her clit in the process. Of course, this only made her more wet. She slid her lips over the head of Jen&#39;s dick, feeling them expand to accommodate her size. More thick cum dribbled into her moutb, which she let run out for a bit before swalloeing the rest.<br />
<br />
She started to give the best blowjob of her life, squeezing the cock and running her hand up and down it while taking it deep in her throat. The messy pre-cum/cum liquid ran over her chin and down into her shirt, with her hair sticking to some in the process.<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s body started to burn, and she could feel more cum on the way. Her panting grew louder, and she started to moan, her hands pressing her breasts together and fingering her nipples. Emma took the hint and pulled the dick out of her mouth, jerking it with both hands as it folded slightly against itself at the base. &quot; You&#39;re really gonna cum now? Already? You didn&#39;t even fuck me yet, Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma&#39;s playful tone and smirk multiplied what was already going to be another earth-shattering orgasm for Jen. She tried to shoot cum, but was so overcome with euphoria that for five seconds straight she practically pissed cum, a single stream starting as a light dribble and intensifying to a blast that splashed off of Emma&#39;s cheeks and rebounded back to her breasts. After this, rope after rope of thick cum pounded Emma&#39;s cute face. &quot;So I&#39;m just your little cumslut for tonight? You&#39;re gonna cover me with cum? And leave me here all wet and sticky? I hope you have more in mind!&quot; she teased, pausing between words to dribble cum from her mouth.<br />
<br />
Finally, the blasts started died down. Emma now was going at her pussy with both hands, Jen&#39;s cock pulsating in her mouth. Emma came hard-she had never been so turned on before, and this was just the beginning of her friday evening. Realeasing her lips from their grip, Jen&#39;s cock slunked out of her mouth and onto the leather. It was massive, and Emma had a smaller orgasm again at the sight of it. When she finally pulled her hands from her pants and wiped the webs of her own cum onto her sweater, she smiled at Jen and licked her dick, slowly, from the head to the base. It answered with another dribble of thick cum, now pooling up between Jen&#39;s legs and soaking her pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;How much more can I have?&quot; She asked.</p>
