<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trent was a nerd... Scrawny, Teeth slightly buck toothed maligned with braces, bag acne, and carried himself with little confidence making him seem even smaller. He was at his local game store where he at least had some amount of respect for being good, but also willing to make a game interesting by playing some fun Jank strategies. A mysterious robed figure had entered taken a look, took out a few dice from a bag when they took a seat, rolled them, put them back into the bag, and then took off the robe as a cute teen girl seemed to be underneath. She took out a smartphone to look at herself, and then looked over to some fellow nerds and asked if she could join them. <br />
It wasn&#39;t the most healthy gaming session for them and Trent on the side didn&#39;t bother joining. He wasn&#39;t sure if... he took occasional glances and when they did a 4 player game where it seemed like it was a more 1 v 3 Trent took interest as the cute girl was beating the others somewhat easily. He then came over and asked &quot;How about we play a 1 on 1 if that&#39;s ok with you guys?&quot; The other dudes who were more interested in hanging out with a girl originally nodded interested to see how well Trent could do against the girl. The girl smirked as if wondering if Trent was simply cocky, but after the first game the girl realized she was losing, tried getting serious, but couldn&#39;t bring it back. Rematch time and Trent realized he was being beaten as the girl was going all out on her strategy... but Trent noticed a few things, her strategy, how she rolled the dice... &quot;Best 2 out of 3&quot; Trent offered and the girl looked in the eyes of a young man who wasn&#39;t salty but calculating. <br />
<br />
The girl smiled and said &quot;Sure, but how about we make things interesting. I&#39;ll wager this bag of dice of mine&quot; Trent looked for something to put up for ante that would be worth a bag of dice. He had seen some of the dice she had been rolling and they look custom built and those generally weren&#39;t that cheap. <br />
&quot;Umm... I can offer... The game itself? and maybe 35 bucks?&quot; Trent questioned<br />
The girl smirked &quot;Sure~&quot; and the final game started with the girl starting with a lead, but Trent&#39;s counter-strategy in the mid game was paying off. The girl noticed and tried pivoting strategies and Trent tried pivoting as well... and when the dice were rolled. Trent gave the table leg a quick boot as the girl had been doing to throw off her dice manipulation... With the final move made it was game over. <br />
Trent held out a hand and said &quot;Good game&quot; <br />
The girl took his hand and said &quot;Good game~&quot; then they seemed to be transported into an empty void aside from themselves and the game table. Trent looked shocked as the two unlocked hands and the girl said &quot;You won, congratulations. I don&#39;t mind losing my dice, but I suppose I should explain how to use them. Bad form to give a won prize without explaining how the magic works.&quot; Trent was just staring around shocked &quot;...I&#39;m a Wizard. I just sent us to a pocket dimension where time doesn&#39;t actually flow, and you just won my disguise kit.&quot;<br />
Trent looked at the dice and said &quot;...You rolled the dice and then took off your cloak... Those change you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes... a bit more than that but if you imagine an aspect of yourself you&#39;d like to change and pull out a dice it&#39;ll match all those types of aspects. You can also imagine whether or not reality will change with the change, who&#39;ll notice the change, etc... but you don&#39;t actually get to choose the exact aspect you want.&quot; The Wizard said as she pulled out a coin with a male symbol on one side and then she flipped it to show the female side on the other. &quot;You can also choose the target by imagining them, but it usually works best with some visual aid. Their actual presence for example... Don&#39;t try bringing the dead back to life with the dice... It wont work well.&quot; The Wizard warned. &quot;For this example I targeted you with this coin, technically a die but... either way, both of us will be aware you are currently a guy but reality will reshape as if you were born a girl and no one else will remember you being a guy.&quot; The Wizard then flipped the coin and it landed on male...<br />
The two stared at it for a second as the Wizard grabbed the coin and flipped it again... and again &quot;...Shows you true randomness isn&#39;t exactly what you may expect...&quot; Finally it landed on female and Trent felt his body shifting, shrinking just a smidge, and then his body got a bit curvier, that organ retracted, she got a bit cuter, and her clothes reformed to being a long skirt and a sweater vest with a long sleeve shirt underneath... and she could feel the bra holding her... not that sizeable assets. Trent looked at herself and her more petite features. The Wizard put the coin back into the bag and said &quot;It&#39;s technically a bag of holding as well, but good look fishing out whatever you put in... I&#39;ve lost a few things in there, but best to just use it for the dice.&quot; The Wizard then grasped Trent&#39;s hand and reality returned. <br />
The guys were clapping as one said &quot;Go, Tina!&quot; another &quot;Way to show strength for the locals!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tina chuckled a little and said &quot;Yeah...I think it&#39;s getting late. I should get going back now.&quot; Tina felt a little unsure of herself in this new body and reality, but when she packed everything she took the bag and instead of putting it in her... large purse... she just grabbed it, and as she started walking back home examined it... It felt like there were probably dozens of dice inside, but by what the Wizard had said... It probably just generated the magic dice on command and there wasn&#39;t anything in there... aside from whatever the Wizard had tried putting inside of it that weren&#39;t the magic dice. The sun was setting and things were getting late. For the time being Tina felt like she should just get home before trying anything with the dice.</p>
