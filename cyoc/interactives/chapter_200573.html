<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hannibal, Selene, and Donovan now waited inside their car, patiently waiting for the signal. &quot;How long before Lord Tepes signals us,&quot; Hannibal asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon,&quot; Donovan answered, gazing at his watch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once the signal is given I will take the Turner child while you two deal with the Carlson woman,&quot; Selene stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you have in mind Selene,&quot; Donovan asked, raising an eyebrow. Selene now smirked, smoothing out her blouse as she gazed at the Turner home. &quot;A bloodless battle Donovan,&quot; she smirked. &quot;I plan on casting a sleeping spell on the parents before taking the child. They&#39;ll never know what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt we shall be so lucky,&quot; Hannibal grumbled. &quot;This, Kellie Carlson is a wizard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A wizard that has not been in battle,&quot; Donovan stated. &quot;Think for a moment? We have seen the other elder wizards in battle yet not this one.  Perhaps she is not as strong as we fear.&quot; Hannibal now pondered what Donovan said. It made sense honestly. Perhaps he was just worried over nothing.<br />
<br />
A beeping now pierced the silence of the car. Checking his watch, Donovan now looked to his compatriots as they exited their car.<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed as she now carried Morgan to bed. Another long day of work had exhausted the young mother. Still, it was these moments that she savored the most.<br />
<br />
It struck the young attorney as ironic. When Morgan had been reborn, she had thought Katie was crazy to adopt the child. Now though, she couldn&#39;t think of life without her. This is why she always stayed behind with Morgan. Katie and her friends maybe fighting off vampires but Kellie&#39;s sole purpose was caring for Morgan. She would make sure her daughter remained safe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay sweety,&quot; Kellie smiled. &quot;Up you go.&quot; Kellie now assisted the 3 year old into bed, tucking her in tightly as she brought the child her favorite stuffed animals. &quot;Thank you mommy,&quot; Morgan replied sweetly. &quot;Hug. Kiss.&quot; Kellie now beamed at her adorable blond daughter, squeezing the child before kissing her tenderly on the forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy,&quot; Morgan asked. &quot;When will mom be home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After you fall asleep sweety,&quot; Kellie said softly. &quot;Mom had some business to take care of but she loves you very much.&quot; Smoothing out her daughter blond locks, she gave her a small smile before turning on the night light and closing the door.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Kellie stretched as she made her way towards her upstairs office. While she understood why Katie was hunting vampires, it didn&#39;t mean she liked it. They had a daughter now, jobs, responsibilities. Yes they still trained in magic but Kellie felt she was growing past that. Sitting at her desk, Kellie now turned on Morgan&#39;s monitor as she opened up one if the stack of legal files on her desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goona be a late night Kel,&quot; she sighed as she conjured a cup of coffee. As she now began to review a case, she paused.<br />
<br />
Something felt off. Kellie could feel a sense ofbdread washing over her. After almost a decade around magic, Kellie knew better than to dismiss those feelings. Something wasn&#39;t right.<br />
<br />
Sloqly the young woman now stood, anxiously making her way towards the front window of the house. Glancing out the window, she noticed an unfamiliar car parked in the street. Most people would have dismissed this if not down right not notice. Kellie though was far to experienced to simply dismiss it.<br />
<br />
Mumbling a spell, Kellie now slowly crept towards her daughters room, a small ball of fire now swirling in her hands. Morgan was quiet, which wasn&#39;t a surprise. The toddler fell asleep quickly once in bed.  As she slowly pushed the girls door open, she now screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;MORGAN!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie now observed two men now standing by Morgan&#39;s bedroom window. One was a thin man with nearly combed hair. The other, a massive individual with biceps thicker than Kellie legs. In the mountain of a man&#39;s arms was Kellie sleeping daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let go of my daughter you son of a bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannibal eyes went wide as Donovan was thrown back by the seemingly mundane spell. Glancing at the woman, Hannibal could feel the power emanating from her like a blast furnace. &quot;Go,&quot; Donovan bellowed as he kept to his feet. &quot;Go! I&#39;ll hold her off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannibal nodded, leaping out the open window as Donovan now stood. The elite vampire had hoped to kidnap the child quietly without alerting the wizard. With that plan now having gone badly, he would have to resort to plan B.<br />
<br />
Withdrawing a pair of swords, Donovan now sneered at the angry wizard. The vampire had killed wizards before. He would just add yet another one to his tally.<br />
<br />
Kellie was desperate, feelings of rage, desperation, and fear washing over her. She now watched as the vampire dodged one of her spells only to lunge at her with his twin swords. Gritting her teeth, Kellie now summoned forth the energy necessary to complete her guardian spell.<br />
<br />
Donovan screamed, looking to skewer Kellie with his blades. Instead the vampire was shocked as his swords deflected off a shimmering golden armor. Looking up in surprise, Donovan watched as Kellie now raised her arm, a golden shield now firming on the womans arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Selene,&quot; Hannibal bellowed. Selene paused, giving the massive vampire a sour look. The vampire witch now cradled a sleeping toddler in her arms. &quot;What is it,&quot; she hissed.<br />
<br />
An explosion now rocked the neighborhood, Selene and Hannibal wincing in surprise as they spun towards the sound. A massive hole now existed in the Carlson home, the two vampires watching as Donovan&#39;s body now crashed to the street below. <br />
<br />
&quot;Donovan?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Selene&#39;s eyes now went wide as a shimmering golden figure now lept from the Carlson home, soaring into the air before landing. Kellie now glared at the vampires, her mouth twisted into a murderous snarl.<br />
<br />
&quot;GIVE ME BACK MY DAUGHTER!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Selene,&quot; Donovan yelled ashe unsteady got to his feet. &quot;Take the children and go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie saw the female vampire nod, taking both Morgan and Lynne in her arms as she quickly now ran for the car. Kellie simply frowned, raising her arm and destroying the car in a fiery explosion. <br />
<br />
Selene and Hannibal were thrown back by the explosion, fiery debris scattering across the suburban lawns and freeing Morgan from the vampires grasp.<br />
<br />
Donovan and Hannibal now stood, the two elite vampires sharing a look before staring down the wizard. &quot;Selene go now,&quot; Hannibal stated. Selene looked to answer but paused, while she couldn&#39;t see where Morgan had gone, she still had Lynne. Staying any longer would be a death sentence. <br />
<br />
Kellie&#39;s breathing was ragged, hee eyes wide as she stared down the two vampires. She could see vampires were now armed, the smaller one holding a pair of swords as the larger one now held a rather large sword of his own. If she didn&#39;t take them out quickly, the other vampire would escape with her daughter. With a primal scream, the wizard now cast her spell.<br />
<br />
Donovan and Hannibal were speechless, watching in stunned silence as Kellie began to form a massive shimmering sword in her hands. The blade looked impossibly heavy, measuring over 6 feet in length yet this woman wielded it as if it were nothing. With a roar she now lept at them, the two vampires barely avoiding a blade that now cracked the very street.<br />
<br />
Kellie was incensed, desperately trying to destroy the vampires that were keeping her from her daughter. Tears now stung her eyes, she had to move quicker.<br />
<br />
Donovan and Hannibal now charged forward, the wizard had parried their blows individually. While Selene had escaped, they worried about their own lives at this point. With a yell the two charged forward, hoping to destroy this wizard once and for all.<br />
<br />
Kellie saw the attack before it even began. Swinging her massive magical blade, she now shattered the vampires swords before turning to Donovan. The last thing the thin vampire would see would be  the massive blade speeding towards his head as she cleaved him in half.<br />
<br />
Hannibal was shocked, watching as Donovan&#39;s body now split like a log, collapsing to the ground before bursting into flames. Miro would be furious with his failure but he would rather face the wrath of a vampire lord than this enraged wizard. Turning quickly the massive vampire now transformed into a bat before soaring into the night sky.<br />
<br />
Kellie collapsed, her breathing ragged as tears now streamed down her face. She may have killed one vampire but two had escaped, with her precious daughter. Sinking to her knees the young woman now sobbed, mourning the loss of her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellies head shot up, her eyes growing wide as she gazed at the blond toddler. Morgan appeared frightened, the girl sucking her thumb as she stood in her pajamas. Kellie now grabbed the girl squeezing her tightly as she cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby,&quot; she wept. &quot;I was so scared. I thought I lost you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thise bad men scared me mommy,&quot; Morgan whimpered, clinging tightly to her armored mother. Kellie now wiped her eyes, tilting Morgan&#39;s head gently as she gazed into her wide blue eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dont worry baby. Mommy will always be here to protect you.&quot;</p>
