<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad&#39;s day was a terrified blur. He had been blasted with a hose while Max was mounting him in the early hours of the morning. Maybe Brad was blasting Max to separate them. Chad recalls being soaked and shivering as Brad dragged his poodle ass to the suds filled metal tub next to his black van in the driveway.  Chad had expected that water to be warm. It wasn&#39;t.   Brad shoved the poodle into the tub, and began roughly washing Chad. The soap smelled weird. With his heightened sense of smell it took Chad a little while to realize that he was getting a flea bath.  He had fleas? He was itchy all over. The tub seemed to shrink around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand up, boy so I can properly dry you,&quot; Brad ordered. <br />
<br />
Chad looked down at his hands.  He had become human while in the tub. He stood on his feet. He was naked and shivering.  He didn&#39;t feel like he used to though.  Everything was different.  Brad was in charge. Max was in charge. Karl owned him.  Brad roughly pulled him out of the tub, and onto the asphalt driveway. He began to towel Chad dry like when Chad was a little kid. Chad couldn&#39;t help but notice that he was a lot hairier than he used to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Karl gave you back your foreskin, so be sure to clean and dry under it, boy,&quot; Brad said as he tugged on Chad&#39;s cock and rolled back his new foreskin. Chad wanted to ask if it was supposed to be covered with pubic hairs, but he knew his brother well enough not to speak until ordered to speak. He was still wearing the shock collar that Brad had put on him Friday night to stop his barking. Other guys didn&#39;t have hairy foreskins. Damn, Chad realized he was seeing only monochrome still, and he still had his canine sense of smell and hearing. Karl had turned him into a dog with a human appearance. <br />
<br />
Brad had dressed Chad in clothes he had grabbed from Chad&#39;s room at home.  He had picked out an old yellowed pair of briefs that were now too small, skin tight jeans, an old shrunken t shirt that felt like it was painted on his body. All his extra body hair acted like a barrier between his skin and the tight clothing.  Everything seemed to itch. The old athletic socks that Brad pulled over the bits of gravel embedded in Chad&#39;s bare soles from the crumbly asphalt driveway were loose as the elastic had long ago worn away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, your shoes don&#39;t fit right anymore.  I&#39;m sure your owner will get you a new pair of size 9&#39;s, if he decides not to keep you barefoot,&quot; Brad said.<br />
<br />
Size 9 mouthed Chad looking down at his size 12 shoes. They felt like boats around his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Karl explained that while he was leaving you bigger than him in most places, he has a thing about smaller feet. At least feet smaller than his size 10&#39;s,&quot; Brad said with a smirk. <br />
<br />
He handed Chad his Letterman&#39;s jacket, adding, &quot;put this on. Get in the passenger seat. Your backpack is there. Do any homework you need to do. We don&#39;t want any teachers complaining about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad left Chad stumbling in his oversize shoes toward Brad&#39;s truck. He went inside and had a hearty breakfast. <br />
<br />
Chad sat in the cold truck for nearly 45 minutes finishing up some homework before Brad joined him. Brad sat in the driver&#39;s seat. He pulled a foil bag of dog treats out of his jacket pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finish  your homework, Chad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad nodded vigorously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy!&quot; Brad said shoving a Snausage into Chad&#39;s mouth. Chad chewed the dog treat, it tasted so good. &quot;Oh, this soup thermos is filled with Gravy Train for your lunch. Be sure to use a spoon or fork when you eat it, boy,&quot; Brad admonished. <br />
<br />
Chad nodded. <br />
<br />
Brad started the truck. The radio blared. Cold air rushed out of the vents.  Five minutes later the air out of the vents was hot, Chad felt better. It seemed almost normal riding in his brother&#39;s truck to school. <br />
<br />
Brad glanced over at his brother the poodle boy and grinned. The kid looked broken already, and Brad had barely started with his training. <br />
<br />
Brad said, &quot;Speak, Chad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad barked. <br />
<br />
Brad laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, speak English, Chad,&quot; Brad ordered.<br />
<br />
Chad licked his lips, and flexed his tongue. Speaking didn&#39;t feel natural now. He pursed his lips and looked pleadingly at his older brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Puh-leash, Buh-bra-ad, don&#39;t do this to me. I don&#39;t wah-wahntah be a dog,&quot; Chad begged. <br />
<br />
&quot;What would I tell Max?&quot; joked Brad.<br />
<br />
Chad seemed to shrink in his seat at the mention of Max&#39;s name. <br />
<br />
Brad continued, &quot;Accept it, Chad. You were a dog born in a man&#39;s body.  You just are lucky enough to have Karl, Max and me to help you get in touch with your inner poodle.<br />
<br />
Chad whined softly.<br />
<br />
The truck pulled up at the corner across from the high school. Chad got out.<br />
<br />
The whole day, Chad was self conscious about his tiny feet and hairy body. Surely people would notice.  He had trouble focusing in class. There was so much noise, and so many scents. His senses were overwhelmed. <br />
<br />
At lunch, he found a spot to eat alone, but Bruno and Rick soon joined him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what are you eating?&quot; Bruno asked, &quot;it looks like the slop I feed my dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gravy Train,&quot; Chad answered. He giggled like it was a joke, and said, &quot;just some stew Brad gave me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of Brad,&quot; Bruno said, &quot;he&#39;s offered to give my dog a free week of obedience training. What&#39;s up with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick piped up, &quot;Yeah, he wants my St Bernard Clyde too.&quot;<br />
<br />
More dogs to hump and humiliate me, thought Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just whine, Chad?&quot; Bruno asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Food went down wrong pipe,&quot; Chad replied. He added, &quot;I  wouldn&#39;t be surprised if your dog slop is better than Brad&#39;s stew.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone laughed.<br />
<br />
A voice asked, &quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; It was Karl.<br />
<br />
Chad was terrified.  He wanted to bark. He wanted to sniff his master, but he had to play human.  Had to be human. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I was just saying that the stew Chad&#39;s brother made looks like my dog&#39;s slop. Chad said my dog&#39;s food probably tastes better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karl crinkled up his nose looking at Chad&#39;s half eaten &quot;stew&quot;. He nodded and sat down right next to Chad. Rick and Bruno were surprised that Chad didn&#39;t push Karl away. Chad always had a thing about personal space. Under the table Karl&#39;s size 10 shoe crushed the empty space in Chad&#39;s shoe where his toes used to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, um, Karl,&quot; said Chad avoiding the word master.<br />
<br />
Karl grinned, &quot;Hi, Chad. You ready for the math test in Mr. Kotter&#39;s class?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Chad said nervously.<br />
<br />
Chad hadn&#39;t thought a lot about Karl before. Karl was taking Advanced Calculus, but he served as a student aid in Kotter&#39;s regular Senior Math Class. He sat behind Chad in that class.  Was that where or when he decided to make Chad his dog?<br />
<br />
Chad overheard Bruno telling Rick that it looked like Chad forgot to wax this week. Oh, great, they were assuming that he always was hairy and used to wax. Some girls across the quad commented about him, Chad blushed and popped wood.  Damn, super hearing was something he would have to get used to...<br />
<br />
When the final bell rang, Chad hurried out to the parking lot. Sure enough there was a red pickup with an animal crate in back. He expected to see Brad or Karl, but there was a huge buff dark swarthy guy sitting in the truck.  He looked oddly familiar.  He was turning his head this way and that. Then he stared at Chad.<br />
<br />
Chad sniffed the air.<br />
<br />
Max? He stared at the truck driver. Max was human now?<br />
<br />
Chad swallowed hard, he walked toward the back of the truck. He planned to get in the crate, and strip inside it.<br />
<br />
Max apparently had other ideas. He got out of the pickup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heel, Chad!&quot; Max ordered.<br />
<br />
Chad froze. <br />
<br />
&quot;Strip now, boy!&quot; Max growled.<br />
Chad looked around.  Kids were pouring out of the school. The pickup somewhat shielded him from their view. He turned to face Max.<br />
<br />
Max was now at least 6&#39;5&quot;. He was dressed in the clothing Chad had worn to school Friday. The top 3 buttons were undone to accommodate Max&#39;s broad hairy chest. The jeans which had been a bit baggy on Chad, were skintight on Max. They would have been too short but they were tucked into shiny size 13 or 14 black cowboy boots. No wait, they were size 15. They were Chad&#39;s boots, a joke gift from Brad years ago. They had never fit, Chad had forgotten about them until now.  He glanced down at his now tiny feet swimming in his half empty size 12 shoes. So tiny compared to Max. Chad seemed to shrink and slump his shoulders in the presence of his mate. Mate? No, no, he had to stop thinking this way.<br />
<br />
Strip. Max&#39;s word echoed in his mind. Though Max did not repeat it verbally, the glare from his eyes conveyed it.<br />
<br />
Chad opened his mouth to protest, &quot;Ma- aack yeow!&quot; The shock collar was on again.<br />
<br />
Chad stole a glance at the school.  He hurriedly stripped naked except for his collar. He shoved the bundle of clothes, shoes and backpack up into Max&#39;s arms, Chad was only about 4 feet tall, and he dropped to all fours, and ran around to the back of the truck, and hopped up onto the pickup truck&#39;s bed. He struggled to open the latch as his fingers became toes. It wasn&#39;t 3:30 pm yet. Max appeared at the tailgate.  He set Chad&#39;s stuff next to the animal crate. He carefully inspected Chad with his hands and eyes.  He nodded. Then he locked the crate, closed the tailgate, got into the truck cab, started the engine and drove off.<br />
<br />
The poodle formerly human stared out of the crate at his classmates and receding school. He started to whimper.</p>
