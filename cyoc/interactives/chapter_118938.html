<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Then, in an instant, he remembered the safe word they had started the game with. He went back into his room and said, &quot;alright, I&#39;ve had enough. It&#39;s time to end this: Gumdrop!&quot; <br />
<br />
... Nothing happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gumdrop! Gumdrop! Gumdrop! Gumdrop!&quot; <br />
<br />
Karyn gave him a weirded out look and began to gather her things. She didn&#39;t have time to be around her friend&#39;s creepy meltdown. She knew that Jon&#39;s condition made him a little different but they had both come to terms with that as children. Now, because of this silly rock business he was acting all freaky. &quot;I&#39;m gonna go home. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow at school.&quot; She said grabbing her things. Then she went back over to fetch the rock. &quot;Don&#39;t freak out about this thing.&quot; She said while gesturing to the rock. &quot;I hate seeing you all emotional. I wish you would just go back to strutting around and groping yourself like the big horndog you normally are.&quot; With that, she put the rock in her bag and made her way out the door. <br />
<br />
Jon felt all the blood go from his face. &quot;Was that a wish?&quot; He thought. Then, as if answering his question, his right hand reached up and began to pinch and tease his nipple. <br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be happening.&quot; He whispered to himself as his other hand began to move against his will to fondle his giant cock through his grey jockstrap. He absentmindedly walked over to the mirror and began to watch himself play in the mirror. It didn&#39;t take him long to shuck the little bit of clothes he had and begin fully stroking and working his amazing body. His new cock was so huge it must have been at least 15 inches long. Looking at himself in the mirror seemed to really turn him on. &quot;I&#39;m the hottest guy on the planet!&quot; He said to no one in particular. Then after more pumping and groaning, he let out a deep groan and shot the most massive load he had ever seen all over himself and the window. <br />
<br />
Exhausted but feeling a bit better, he sat down on his bed. After catching his breath and surveying the situation, he decided his next course of action would be a shower. Thankfully his parents were still out so he just walked naked down the hall to the bathroom. <br />
<br />
In the bathroom, Jon realized that more than just his clothing options had changed. His old shower/tub set up had been replaced by a large glass shower with a bench in it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I wouldn&#39;t fit in the old shower.&quot; Jon thought to himself. Then with a glance at his cum covered body in the mirror, his extremely sexual subconscious drove him to another round of touching and fondling. <br />
<br />
He got in the shower and began to wash. As he lathered himself from head to toe, his python began to expand. He sat down on the bench and his cock hit him right between his muscle bound pecs. <br />
<br />
Staring down at the angry head of his own cock, Jon&#39;s lust addled mind decided to try something. Leaning forward slightly, he placed the cockhead between his eager lips. As he say there with his cock in his mouth he realized that it wasn&#39;t an unpleasant sensation. It tasted musky and soapy but not repulsive. <br />
<br />
He recoiled as he began to cum. Painting the side of the large shower as he did so. As he cleaned himself off, he heard his mom come through the front door. He was toweling off when he heard his mom say, &quot;Jon get in here!&quot; Jon wrapped the large towel around his waist and went back in his room to see what his mom was complaining about. <br />
<br />
As he walked in his room, his mom began gesturing to the semen that he had shot all over his mirror and dripped down the hall. &quot;You need to have more self control!&quot; She said as she gestured to the mess. &quot;We spend money on condoms for a reason.&quot; Then, realizing he was standing there in one of her good towels she said, &quot;No, No, No!&quot; but it was too late. <br />
<br />
While standing in front of his mom, the towel he was covering up with began to shrink. It shrank until it was little less than a wash cloth. &quot;You know that your condition prevents that kind of modesty. That&#39;s the second time this month that you&#39;ve ruined one of my good towels.&quot; His mom said with an exasperated sigh. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get dressed and clean up this mess.&quot; His mom said snatching the too-small washcloth from his hands and exposing him in front of her. Jon felt himself start to get excited at being so exposed but he fought his &quot;natural&quot; urges and pulled on another jockstrap. <br />
<br />
His mom laughed and gave him a hug. &quot;It&#39;s ok honey, I know you can&#39;t help yourself. Be a good boy and clean up your mess.&quot; <br />
<br />
With that, his mom left him to his own devices and went downstairs to work on dinner. <br />
<br />
Jon got to cleaning and only stopped once to jerk with one of the condoms that was in his bedside table. Once he was all finished, he went downstairs to see if dinner was on the table. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sport! How&#39;s it hanging?&quot; His dad said as he got to the table. <br />
<br />
Jon and his dad chuckled at what must have been a tired joke for both of them in this reality.</p>
