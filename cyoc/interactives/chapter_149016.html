<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Boys will be boys though (or at least Brad would), and a strict adherence to said rules had in short order lapsed by inches into following the rules a little outside of the times she had set. Then forgetting to bring her pussy on Monday and returning it Tuesday. Then forgetting her pussy Monday and cajoling her into letting him fuck her Monday evening. Then regularly keeping her pussy on Monday and Tuesday. Then texting rather than calling her when he was going to fuck. Jen was furious at all of these and she considered breaking up with him numerous times, but Brad’s sheer dedication to waiting on her hand & foot outside of this always changed her mind quickly, not to mention the scandal that would result when Brad would inevitably open his fat mouth afterwards and let slip that she was literally giving her pussy to him.<br />
<br />
After three months of this, it had reached the point where Jen hadn&#39;t touched her own pussy for over two weeks and woke up at 1am to the feeling of getting fucked and a text saying &quot;Babe gonna use ur puss&quot; not six hours after flaking on their date together to drink with the guys, and soon it got even worse than that. The football coaches were amazed at the recent improvement in Brad&#39;s performance during games, which Brad attributed to &quot;having more testosterone&quot;. In reality, Jen knew the reason was that underneath Brad&#39;s sweaty compression pants and jockstrap lay her quivering flower, Brad&#39;s domination of Jennifer&#39;s slit focusing him and putting him deeper into the mindset of dominating on the field. And so, during Glendale football games Jen found herself cheering Brad on from the sidelines with jumps and pom-poms while also cheering Brad on from inside his pants with cunt. The tightness of the football gear made sure she was kept fully-impaled on Brad&#39;s rod, and when Brad got sacked (which was thankfully rare) it translated into somehow getting penetrated even deeper. &quot;You really help me shake off a bad play.&quot; Brad had told her when she demanded an explanation the first time he did this.<br />
<br />
After one such game, Jen had had enough. <i>No call, no text, and he’s been at it for twenty minutes! How did he even get home so fast?</i> Jen felt completely disrespected and humiliated as she felt her wet tunnel continue to get pounded while she walked home in her cheer uniform. Taking out her phone, she called Brad to tell him they needed to talk. “Aw come on babe! I’m busy, having some drinks with the guys.” Brad replied.<br />
<br />
“NO BRAD! WE NEED TO TALK-….wait, but you’re having sex with me?” Jen asked quizzingly as the hard cock continued to rattle her insides.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Rodrigo kept asking me what my secret was. I told him it was you and he didn’t believe me so I showed him.”<br />
<br />
“You….you told him? That means that…” Jen felt sick to her stomach.<br />
<br />
“He was so jealous that I got to fuck on the go, you should’ve seen! So I let him take a shot at what he was missing.”<br />
<br />
“Brad….that’s my vagina….” Tears welled up in Jennifer’s eyes as Brad’s words sank in. “That’s my private place….and you just gave it away to RODRIGO?!?” Jen was full-on sobbing and shaking as she felt utterly objectified in a way no other woman had ever experienced before.<br />
<br />
“Babe, it’s just one time-“<br />
<br />
“NO, WE’RE THOUGH! BRAD, WE’RE THROUGH! FUCK YOU BRAD! IT’S OVER!” She was almost screaming at the phone microphone as her voice carried nearly over a block. Jennifer’s rage was terrifying even over the phone, and even as she was the one getting fucked. Elsewhere, Rodrigo entered the final stretch as he felt Jen’s hole tighten as a result of her anger.<br />
<br />
“Come on babe, don’t be like that…”<br />
<br />
“And stop calling me babe! I’m not your babe and my vagina isn’t yours to hand out! Return it!” Jen’s voice echoed across the empty street.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, Jen come on! It’s-“<br />
<br />
“NOW”<br />
<br />
“….Alright alright! I’m sorry Jen, I’ll give you back your stuff tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“Drive over and return it to me TONIGHT.” Jen’s voice was as cold as Siberia. “AND TELL RODRIGO TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY PUSSY.”<br />
<br />
“Tomorrow Jen, I’m drunk and you wouldn’t want me driving drunk with…?” Brad let the implication of his excuse hang (despite not being familiar with the word “implication”). While normally her angry tone had always whipped him into compliance, and despite still smarting every time she raised her voice, part of him put two and two together and realized she didn’t actually have a way to force him to return her fun tunnel immediately.<br />
<br />
“FUCK! TELL RODRIGO TO GET OUT!”<br />
<br />
Jen heard the phone get put down.<br />
<br />
<i>“….Yo Rodrigo, you gotta stop man!”<br />
<br />
“WHAT!!! I’m almost finished bro!”</i> Jen pursed her lips at the chorus of laughter that accompanied this.<br />
<br />
<i>“Jen wants you to get out.”<br />
<br />
“Really? I thought her ratchet ass was be loving this! She’s so wet man!”</i> Jen got even angrier (and embarrassed) at the comment. “That’s a totally involuntary response dickhead!” she hissed.<br />
<br />
<i>“I donno man, but she was pretty sure of it.”<br />
<br />
“Alright alright….”</i><br />
<br />
But instead of feeling letting her pussy finally rest, she felt the cock start pounding into her wet cavern even <i>harder</i>, Jen couldn’t prevent herself from vocalizing, grunting as she tried to maintain her anger while Rodrigo’s cock stamped into her cunt. “Uh!…oh!...ugh!…what the fuck is he doing!” Jen yelled into the phone, but the tinny output of her voice wasn&#39;t reaching anyone’s ears from Brad’s phone as it lay on the sidewalk outside the Glendale locker room. After a minute, Jen’s disgrace fell to new levels as she felt Rodrigo’s cum coat her walls.<br />
<br />
<i>“Hah! There, I’m done!” <br />
<br />
“Pretty good, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah bro, it’s awesome. You’re a lucky fucker man.” </i>Don’t refer to my vagina as an “it”! That’s me! Jen thought as tears of anger trailed down her face.<br />
<br />
A few seconds later, she heard Brad’s footsteps. “There, I’ve got it. I’ll return it tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“Tonight, Brad!” Jen’s voice was still stern, but it felt ineffectual to her. Shame washed over her mind as she knew that Brad could see that she had cum, her hole contracting around the slimy jizz oozing out of it while she made her demand.<br />
<br />
“Tomorrow, babe. I’ll just bring it tomorrow okay? Promise.”<br />
<br />
“BRAD, NO YOU RETURN IT-“ Jen heard a click as the line dropped dead. Jen tried to call him back but he had turned his phone off. Still shaking in rage, Jen kicked a trash can nearby before she begrudgingly began walking home again. As she round the next corner her blood ran cold, and she prayed that Brad would keep his promise as she felt another cock enter her slick vagina.</p>
