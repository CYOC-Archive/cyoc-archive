<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake from a nice, dreamless sleep to the feel of your sister's cheek and hand pressed into your chest.  Her skin is so warm, and soft as a puppy's paw.  That long auburn hair, that tan skin, that taut figure... oh, so perfect.  To bad she had to be your sister, and you had to sneak away from Mom and Dad to consummate your relationship.<br />
<br />
You're three years her senior: you eighteen, her fifteen.  You fell in love with her two years ago, when you saw her in a one-piece bathing suit and realized your baby sister wasn't a string bean any more.  You've spent endless nights up in your room, pulling your pud and pretending your exquisite baby sister was beneath you.  But you never thought it would come true.<br />
<br />
Not until eight months ago, when you and she had the house to yourselves for an evening.  You'd settled in for an evening of TV while Mom and Dad were out celebrating their wedding anniversary.  You thought she was up in her room, texting with her friends, until she swayed down the stairs in a thin cotton nightgown.  You couldn't tell if she had panties on beneath, but the thrust of her nipples made it plain she wasn't wearing a bra.<br />
<br />
Then she sat down on the couch next to you.<br />
<br />
You tried to focus on the TV, but she reached a hand up and began to stroke your hair.  She had turned fourteen six months earlier, but you'd tried to force that out of your mind.  But you couldn't ignore her touching you, stroking your hair, her pert young breasts just an inch from your chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Teach me to kiss, big brother,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Your eyes went wide, and you couldn't speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to know how,&quot; she went on.  &quot;A girl needs to know how to kiss in this modern world, but I want to learn with someone I trust and care about.&quot;  She poked you on the nose flirtatiously.  &quot;And that's you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You finally managed to find your voice.  &quot;But you're my sister!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your my brother,&quot; she said with a nod.  &quot;If a girl can't trust her brother, who can she trust?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to find yourself a boyfriend for that,&quot; you said, though you wished you had the strength to just grab her with both hands and plant one on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm young, there's time for that,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I'm not looking for a boyfriend, I just want to learn how to kiss.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she leaned over you, pressing her breasts right into your body, and planted her lips on your mouth.  Your ethics crumbled at that moment, and you reached one hand up to hold her head in place as you opened her lips and kissed back.<br />
<br />
She had been unwilling to go beyond kissing at first, even though you'd begged.  She'd said she didn't want to risk getting pregnant by her own brother.  But every time you two had the house alone after that, you practiced kissing together.<br />
<br />
After you'd been practicing for two months, she came into your room late one night.  You slept in a pair of sweat pants and nothing else, and when you saw her body in her satin nightgown, you couldn't hide your hard-on from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gather you like what you see,&quot; she said, and grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Completely and totally,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm ready to go to the next level.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
She sat down next to you on your bed and put a hand on your chest.  &quot;I want to make out.  I want to get physical.  Do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You'd been dreaming of when she'd let you do more, but you'd been scared that, if you asked, you'd frighten her off.  &quot;I do,&quot; you said.  &quot;I want it more than you can know.&quot;<br />
<br />
She put one finger on your lips.  &quot;Understand,&quot; she'd said.  &quot;I'm not offering you sex.  Both of us will keep our trousers on.  But I want to feel your hands on my body.  It's all I've been able to think of for weeks.  My grades have been slipping at school because I can't think about anything but you.  Please, be here for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; you said, as you reached one hand up and slipped her neck and pulled her to you.<br />
<br />
After months of kissing, it felt so good so see her take off her nightgown for you.  She kept her panties on, but she grabbed both your wrists and placed your hands on her breasts.  She was still only fourteen, but her body was so amazing, and as you stroked her shoulders and cupped her backside and kissed and stroked and made out with her and learned the feel of every inch of her body, she was every inch the woman for you.<br />
<br />
Before long, you'd given up on girls at school, because the most beautiful girl in the world came into your room every night and made out for hours.  She never let you go all the way, and you ended most nights jerking it down after she left, but the sacrifice was more than worth it.<br />
<br />
Then, the night of her fifteenth birthday party, she'd slunk into your room just when you expected, but just leaned against the door, looking sweet and shy and demure.  &quot;I need to change the arrangement again,&quot; she'd whispered so softly that you could barely hear her.  &quot;I'm not ready to give you my virginity yet, but I need to know what it feels like.  Keep your sweats on, but make it like we're... like we're... you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
You grinned at her, amused and enchanted by her inability to say it.  &quot;You want me to dry hump you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She only nodded.<br />
<br />
You were both virgins, and you still never got to see her with her panties off, but you and she became lovers.  You learned what pleased each other.  You learned to use your mouth to bring her to orgasm.  You became more and more hers, and she became yours.<br />
<br />
You two planned this trip together when you agreed you were both ready to lose your virginity.  You'd been lovers for months now.  Neither of you had ever been with anyone else, and you were ready to become one together.  It's finally happened.  And it was everything you ever dreamed of.<br />
<br />
Your sister stirs, and flexes her fingers over your chest.  That feels so good.  Her eyes float open, and she turns to look up at you.  &quot;Good morning, big brother,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, lover,&quot; you say.</p>
