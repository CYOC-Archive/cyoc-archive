<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David could barely believe his eyes as he watched Pam rocket through the water. She had never been much of an adept swimmer, or so she insisted, but if she could swim THAT well, it was a miracle she'd never been begged to join the local swim-team! The thought pestered David a little... what with their mediocre performances over the last few seasons, they could’ve used someone like that!<br />
She'd vanished, fully, into the blue. That was the second shock; how could she feel secure diving down so deep, never mind how quickly she'd done it!? With a flick of his tail, David swam down to meet her. It was a good job he had the thing, he mused. He'd never catch up if he was still legged!<br />
<br />
~<br />
<br />
The cool, fluent embrace of the sea brushed elegantly through Pam's long, red hair. She would've been ecstatic to see just how beautifully it wavered, or just how poetically she swam. For years, she'd wanted to be a better swimmer like David had been, and cursed herself for never taking more advanced lessons - she certainly had no time for them these days. Her eyes were closed in bliss, and her mouth was stuck in a playful smile.<br />
&quot;It's wonderful...&quot; She thought. &quot;Even better than I imagined!&quot; She always thought a swim in the deep would feel magical, in its own way. But how she felt now wasn't so much the feel of the sea as it was Maisar's potion working its magic, and doing away with what wasn't necessary....<br />
Her legs kicked as one, and had developed a pattern so smooth, she could've sworn there wasn't any knees at all hindering her. She kicked as though her legs were a wave themselves: flowing and elegant.<br />
She wriggled her toes, desperate to feel the light way the water tickled them... only to find they didn't respond. Confused, she looked back, and it was then that her mind snapped to reality.<br />
&quot;W-What on-!?&quot; She said with water filling her mouth.<br />
Her feet had broadened, flattened, and turned a stark grey. But oddest of all, they were fused together! She watched in amazement as they grew larger, becoming broad, wide and dark. Tailfins! &quot;A... A dolphin's...?&quot; she thought. They flicked lightly.<br />
She had no time to wonder about them, because the dark grey shade was slowly creeping up her legs! They seemed to change as she watched. They grew longer, far longer, and far broader too. Slowly, they melded together.<br />
&quot;W-What's happening to me? What is this? What's going on!?&quot; She thought in a panic. Her tail-in-the-making thrashed as she was caught between curiosity and blind panic. The way it flailed showed there was no remains of human limit in it, it could twist and bend however she wished!<br />
The grey crept up to her waist, and snapped away her undergarment as it widened her waist considerably. Shocked, she rose her tail to cover her now-exposed... *ahem* part. Oddly, it was easy to move as her legs had ever been. It felt natural. She studied her lower body in confusion.<br />
&quot;A dolphin...&quot; she mused. And indeed, it was a long, broad dolphin's tail she now sported. No different than they of the marine centre. &quot;A... A mermaid!?&quot; She swished the limb in wonder. She WAS a mermaid! Her fondest childhood dream, after all these years, granted so suddenly!?<br />
Before she thought further, she caught sight of a glimmer in the distance. Something swam towards her, a bright, shining blue...<br />
She recognised that face, as well as the bare body that held it. But she didnt recognise the huge shimmering scaly fishtail that pumped from behind it! &quot;D-David?&quot; she barely noticed she was now speaking and breathing underwater.<br />
<br />
~<br />
<br />
David's expression was just as shocked as Pam's. &quot;She's a mermaid!&quot; He whispered. His eyes caught sight of her tail, long, large and grey. A dolphin's! It was beautiful.<br />
&quot;Pam!&quot; He called.<br />
Pam swam over, pumping her tail just as she'd kicked with her legs. &quot;David! How'd you do this? You know I've always wanted to be a better swimmer, but...&quot; She began, hugging him. She had always been a bubbly sort. &quot;You should've saved it for my birthday y'know.&quot; She laughed.<br />
But David was confused. &quot;I... er... didn't do anything. I was about to ask what happened to you.&quot;<br />
&quot;I thought... I thought the lotion was a gift from you.&quot; She replied. &quot;It had your name, and your message.&quot; David's look didnt change. &quot;B-But never mind that, what about you?&quot; She gazed with awe at his shimmering blue tail. &quot;I don't see any legs on you, either.&quot;<br />
&quot;It... it was a lotion. Just like yours.&quot; David was starting to get confused. Come to think of it, he never really questioned what had changed him until now. It'd just felt... so right!<br />
Pam's gaze swept back and forth between their two new tails, before settling on the underwater seascape before them, riddled with vibrant flora and shoaling fish.<br />
&quot;It's beautiful.&quot; She whispered. &quot;Our... our dreams. Our fondest dreams, David. Granted! I'm not sure what happened, exactly, but I think I'm all the happier for it!&quot; She smiled with excitement. &quot;The whole ocean, so much to see! What should we do?&quot;<br />
David, though awkwardly, outstretched his hand for her. He had never really thought of making a move on her before, but now seemed as perfect a time as any. &quot;Well, first off, let's get you used to that REAL swimming-pro's body of yours.&quot;</p>
