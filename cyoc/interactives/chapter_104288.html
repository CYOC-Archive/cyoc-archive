<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a knock at Louis’s door. ‘Come in,’ Louis called.<br />
<br />
Warwick walked in wearing a wide grin. Louis hadn’t seen him since that morning, after he bought his sword. He had refused to say more about his ideas for how to make use of Louis’s power, but judging by the look on his face, he was ready to tell.<br />
<br />
However, his face fell when he caught sight of Louis. ‘Must you sit around like that?’ he said.<br />
<br />
Louis was still an orc. After wandering town a bit more, he had returned to his room at the inn and it had never occurred to him to change back.<br />
<br />
‘It’s easier to polish my sword like this,’ he shrugged, indicating his new sword sat on his lap and holding up the rag he was using to clean it. Although, he thought with a sly smile, Warwick was lucky he hadn’t caught him polishing a sword of a different variety. Something about holding one sword made him immediately think of the other. No wonder orcs were so prone to violence.<br />
<br />
‘Yes, well,’ Warwick grunted. ‘It’s a little… unpleasant, holding a conversation with the orc who attacked my convoy last night. Can I speak to my brother, please?’<br />
<br />
Louis shut his eyes. He’d been the orc so long it was a little reluctant to leave. But Louis focused, making it clear who was in charge, and the orc stepped back. Louis felt his body sink, sending a shiver running up his spine. His feet slid across the wooden floor as his legs shortened and his sword fell from his lap, no longer wide enough to support it. His broad muscles flattened and his fat slithered away, making his skin feel like it was hanging off his bones. It was somehow both strange and familiar. His tusks pulled back into his mouth and his the features of his face softened. He felt his beard retract back into his chin, quickly followed by the fur on his chest and legs disappeared back into his body. He stretched, feeling a bit like he had just woken after a long lie on. Finally, he opened his eyes, his old self again.<br />
<br />
Warwick, who had watched with fascination, held up a hand to block Louis from view. ‘And put something on.’<br />
<br />
Louis looked down. The makeshift kilt he had been wearing no longer fit him. It hung so loosely around his waist that his crotch was in full view. Louis blushed, and quickly dressed.<br />
<br />
‘Well?’ he prompted Warwick once he was fully clothed.<br />
‘Yes,’ said Warwick, his grin returning. It was a grin Louis recognised. He wore it whenever there was money to be made. ‘Here’s what you’re going to do.’<br />
<br />
He pulled a slip of parchment from his coat and handed it to Louis. It was a flyer, featuring a picture of a burly looking barbarian, swinging a sword.<br />
‘Stonewater Combat Tournament?’ Louis read aloud. <br />
‘It’s tomorrow,’ Warwick said excitedly. ‘They do it every month. First to draw blood wins. And they have different classes, see. So, get this, we enter you in the lightweight class because, well, that’s what you are as a human. Then we bet in your favour, and we’ll get great odds since, well, you don’t look like much of a fighter, do you? But then, after the fight starts, you become the orc and pummel your opponent!’<br />
<br />
‘That sounds like cheating…’ said Louis.<br />
‘Nah, it’s strategy.’ said Warwick. ‘It’s not like there’s a rule against it.’<br />
Louis grimaced. Truth be told, he was less concerned about rules and more about transforming in front of a crowd. The convoy workers hadn’t reacted too well about it, and it was clear it still made Warwick uncomfortable. But he seemed to have a blind spot when money was involved.<br />
<br />
‘I dunno…’<br />
Warwick huffed. ‘Why not? What did you buy that sword for if you don’t want to use it?’<br />
Louis looked at his sword, where it had fallen on the floor. Now he was human again, it was very clear how big it was. He wasn’t sure he could lift it now, let alone wield it. Even so, he remembered how it had felt in his hand. How would it feel to actually fight with it? And wasn’t it better to first try it in a tournament, and not a real fight. Even if he lost, he’d only get a cut. He’d already suffered worse than that in the last few days.<br />
<br />
The orc at the back of his head was restless, clearly very much in favour of this plan. The wolf, too, was eager, in the hope he might see some action too. Even Louis himself was starting to forget his doubts.<br />
<br />
‘You know what,’ he said. ‘Let’s do it.’</p>
