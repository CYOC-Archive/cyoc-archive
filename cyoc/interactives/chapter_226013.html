<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;There you are,&quot; Sharon purred. Jeff smirked, admiring the 17 year old blonde before him. It seemed that after Lisa had rebirthed her former husband, now brother, Sharon had awoken and undergone the same process as Lisa. Jeff now took a moment to admire the teenage Sharon.<br />
<br />
She looked like a prom queen, her blonde hair cascading past her shoulders with firm round C cups almost teasing him. The look on her face appeared flushed as she tentatively bit her lip. Obviously her hormones were running wild as Andy looked to be reborn. Approaching Jeff, she now planted a kiss on his face before whispering in his ear. &quot;The kids are sleeping,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Want to head to your room real quick?&quot; Jeff could do little more than nod, his manhood pressing firmly against his jeans.<br />
<br />
Giggling and kissing, the teenage couple locked the door as Sharon quickly discarded her shirt. Jeff could only marvel at the girls appearance. A taught stomach with incredibly firm C cups. Lisa had been incredible but Sharon was a ten out of ten.  &quot;No wonder Mikey is crushing on her,&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
Pushing Jeff onto his bed, Sharon giggled, unzipping his pants as she bit her lip in anticipation. &quot;Jeff,&quot; she blushed. &quot;This is my..um...first time. You&#39;ll be gentle right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise I will,&quot; he replied. This seemed to satisfy the blonde as she slowly lowered herself on top of Jeff and eased him in. Jeff gasped, shocked at the tightness of Sharon&#39;s vagina as she slowly began to rock back and forth. Already he could tell she was closing in on an orgasm as well as preparing for an eventual pregnancy. Jeff noted her hips widening, her stomach begin to bulge as Andy began to reform. Jeff tried to hold on, remain as quiet as possible as the two teens tried to muffle their screams of pleasure. As the orgasm subsided, Sharon slid off, the girl looking a bit nauseous as the morning sickness portion of pregnancy approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything okay in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Sharon hissed, the girl nearing the end of her first trimester. &quot;I can&#39;t let Stacey know I&#39;m having sex again. She almost killed me when she found out I got pregnant!&quot; Dressing quickly, Jeff noted the pretty blonde teens clothes appeared baggier as she sped through pregnancy. Gone were the trendy fashions of her teenage years, instead replaced with maternity clothes. &quot;Just a minute,&quot; Sharon called as she entered her second trimester.  Fixing her hair, the teenage Sharon opened the door, only to see Stacey giving her a knowing look. &quot;You behaving yourself Sharon,&quot; she smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh yes Stacey,&quot; Sharon replied in annoyance. &quot;Geez are you going to get on my case everytime I talk with my boyfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I should have been on your case 8 months ago,&quot; Stacey joked. &quot;Then maybe you wouldn&#39;t be in this mess.&quot; Sharon simply rolled her eyes, about to reply with a sarcastic comment before wincing in pain. &quot;Crap,&quot; Stacey said quickly, the nurse springing into action. &quot;Quick Sharon lay down!&quot; Sharon did as she was told, laying down as Stacey slid the girls maternity jeans off. &quot;Okay listen,&quot; the nurse said quickly. &quot;Sharon, the baby is crowning. Jeff take her hand, Sharon I need one big push.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sharon nodded, grunting before a small yelp of pain escaped her lips. As quickly as it started it was over, Stacey now cleaning off a newborn Andy before cutting the cord. &quot;Its a boy,&quot; Stacey said happily. &quot;Do you have a name picked out for him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrew,&quot; Sharon stated. &quot;But it&#39;s Andy for short. Can I see him?&quot; Stacey nodded, bringing the infant to Sharon as the girl smiled. Already Jeff could see the changes occurring to both Sharon and Andy. The infant was rapidly growing, his hair becoming thicker ss he went from 5 months to six. Sharon too was now going backwards, the pregnancy and birth now forgotten as she looked as she had when she originally entered Jeffs room.<br />
<br />
As Andy hit his first birthday, Jeff glanced at Sharon. The blonde high schooler still looked amazing but was probably only 16 years old now. Jeff could see her face had rounded slightly while her curves had diminished a bit. Still, Jeff figured she was the most attractive Sophmore in his school and he would be lucky to date her. Realizing his time was running out, he turned, planting a kiss on the attractive teenage girl.<br />
<br />
Sharon giggled, the girl racing past 16 and becoming 15. Only a Freshman, she blushed as she shyly gazed at the upper classman. She couldn&#39;t believe how lucky she was. She had just started high school and was already dating a Junior.<br />
<br />
The moment passed though as Sharon left high school in the opposite direction. Sharon&#39;s curves began to diminish, her height decreasing ever so slightly as she raced towards her preteen years. As she went from 13 to 12, Jeff watched as she became waifish, her breasts decreasing to softball sized mounds as she began to noticeably shrink in height. Soon puberty abandoned the girl, the tiny blonde now gazing at Jeff like a school girl with a crush.<br />
<br />
Jeff could only smile warmly, watching the once beautiful teenage girl race into adorable childhood. Sharon continued to grow smaller as she entered single digits, her face continuing to round while her body thinned. Soon she was once more an adorable kindergarten girl, only a tad bit taller than her 3 year old little brother.<br />
<br />
In only moments though, kindergarten was something to look forward too. Sharon dropped in age from 5 to 4, her face teetering on the edge between toddler and child. Sharon was small, her face round and innocent with whispy blonde hair. Blinking she now turned to her twin brother Andy, the boy a bit heavier than she was and sporting slightly darker hair. &quot;Cmon Andy let&#39;s see if Mikeys awake,&quot; she lisped. Grabbing the boys hand, she now sped out of Jeffs room, leaving Stacey and Jeff alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;That girl is such a firecracker,&quot; Stacey laughed. &quot;And such a cutey. Pretty sure all the boys will love her in another 10 years.&quot; Jeff chuckled, realizing Stacey&#39;s proclamation wasn&#39;t far from the truth.</p>
