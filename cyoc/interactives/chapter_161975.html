<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The car journey was fast, taking us only 10 minutes to get to the private hospital where the operation would be taking place,<br />
but to me, it felt like centuries. Mariah did nothing but rub it in, and not in an obvious way where mom could get <br />
involved but in ways of most subtle, like for instance, when Mom was looking at the oncoming traffic, she lightly<br />
punched my arm before squeezing her large boobs, smirking, or constantly looking at me and pointing between us before pointing at me and then her and giggling. <br />
<br />
The car came to a sudden halt and suddenly Mariah&#39;s teasing wasn&#39;t the most of my worries anymore. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright kids, we&#39;ve got to go inside now and check in, we&#39;re already running late!&quot; My mom grabbed her purse before<br />
quickly rushing us out of the car and inside the building.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, do we really have to go through with this?&quot; I protested, &quot;I&#39;ll find another job, heck, another two jobs if I have to! I don&#39;t<br />
want to swap out of my bodi-&quot; I was cut off suddenly by Mom,<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop being ridiculous, the amount that they are offering us is absurdly large. You having an extra job working stacking<br />
shelfs would barely even scrape the surface of what they are giving us.&quot; She yelled, before putting her hand over her<br />
mouth and becoming aware of her own volume, &quot;Look, I understand that it&#39;s going to be an awkward transition but you<br />
did sign up to swap. It&#39;s not like you were forcefully chosen, you offered to put your name up for the swap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, David&quot; Mariah laughed, &quot;Or, Mariah, now, I should be saying.&quot;,<br />
<br />
Her calling me by her name made me almost tumble up the concrete stairs towards the hospitals entrance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop calling me that for crying out loud! I am not even in your body yet!&quot; I screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you will be soon, so it isn&#39;t exactly far fetched of her to be calling you by her, or soon, YOUR name. You should be getting<br />
used to being called Mariah, since you will be her and she will be you very soon.&quot; She glanced at her watch, &quot;Now come on! Let&#39;s go<br />
check in, we&#39;re already running late and we don&#39;t have time for bickering!&quot;.<br />
<br />
We approached the glass doors of the ever-imposing hospital and they opened automatically with a satisfying hiss. Mom rushed over to the main desk with my sister and myself following in pursuit. Mom let the woman at the desk know our names and our appointment and she gestured for us to go sit down in the waiting area.<br />
<br />
Waiting felt like an eternity and my heart felt like it was beating at 100mph. It wasn&#39;t long at all before we were both called by a voice over the hospital speakers,<br />
&quot;Could Mariah and David please both come to room 23 for their appointment with Doctor Stevensen, thank you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, both of you get a move on. I&#39;ll be waiting here for you after your operation is finished&quot; Mom said.<br />
<br />
I glanced at Mom pleadingly and she gave me a reassuring smile, letting me know it&#39;ll be okay - which it won&#39;t. Opening my mouth to protest, I was quickly cut off by my sister who hurriedly pulled my arm along excitedly towards the room of which the operation will<br />
be taking place. <br />
<br />
We arrived at the room and knocked. The door opened up revealing a nice looking man who seemed to be within his mid 50s. He gave off a warm smile and began speaking,<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah yes. You must be the two willing swappees! I am Doctor Stevensen and I will be handling your operation. Please, come in and both take a seat whilst I call my assistant to examine you both once over.&quot; He gestured towards two white seats in the left corner of the room whilst be got up to get his assistant. I looked at my sister and she looked back at me, I studied her face once more, a face that would soon be mine.<br />
<br />
I could see her wide cheeks sitting on either side of some rather large, plump lips. She laughed, making the fat around her face and neck jiggle even more evidently. Honestly, my sister isn&#39;t at all a bad looking woman, but she isn&#39;t a stunner. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s ever had a boyfriend before, and her weight seems to cause her to be very self conscious and shy which is probably the reason why she doesn&#39;t have a boyfriend in the first place. I on the other hand am extremely athletic, handsome, and always is getting attention from women. Well, soon that attention will be directed at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you excited to be me, Mariah?&quot; she asked, still with a big grin plastered all over her face. &quot;Because I am certainly looking forward to being in your hunk of a body. Not only because I won&#39;t have to put up with periods, but also because I am sick and tired of walking around with consistent jiggling, feeling tired constantly, feeling pain in my back all the time due to my large tits. My average looking ass can&#39;t even score a guy. I&#39;ve tried plenty of times.&quot; she sported a frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just an excuse, Mariah. Your weight isn&#39;t even a problem. Look at Jennifer from school, she&#39;s not much thinner than you and she is beaming with confidence! She has had multiple boyfriends unlike you.&quot; I countered her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that hurts quite a lot. First off, I&#39;ve tried to be confident and look where that&#39;s gotten me.. no where. Secondly, don&#39;t call me Mariah, call me DAVID since that&#39;s who I&#39;ll be soon&quot; she growled, &quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry if you think being so confident is easy, but of course you would with the way you look - well, soon to be the way I look.&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;This will all be your problem now anyway!&quot; she sighed happily, gesturing downward at her body causing her large boobs to bounce, &quot;I&#39;ll love to see how you get by with that confidence of yours when you&#39;re me... MARIAH&quot;.<br />
<br />
This was a losing battle, I went to say more to her but then the doctors assistant came over, interrupting us. She looked us over, checking our temperatures, double checking on any allergies and making sure our overall health is fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, you two should be ready for the procedure. If you can just follow Doctor Stevensen into the operation room and follow his instructions&quot; She smiled.<br />
<br />
We followed the Doctor into the back room where it was revealed, a machine with two metal helmets and a bunch of tubes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is this safe?&quot; Mariah stuttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh so NOW you&#39;re worried?&quot; I snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bite me!&quot; She snapped back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now, that&#39;s a perfectly reasonable concern you two.&quot; Doctor Stevensen said. &quot;Yes, the procedure is entirely safe. You two will sit down on either seat before being administered with a sleeping agent, and once you are awake you will have successfully transferred into each others bodies, each with the others mannerisms and muscle memories. I assure you, it&#39;s perfectly safe and has been done multiple times. We just need to test our new equipment on some willing people, and we&#39;re paying you guys to do so&quot; he smiled.<br />
<br />
The doctor gestured towards the seats behind him, &quot;Now, if you could please both take a seat in each side and we will begin the procedure.&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mariah hurried past me, pushing into me on the way to her seat. I felt her body squish into me on the way past, a feeling I&#39;ll soon be all to familiar with. As I made my way to my seat, I glared at her and she only returned a mocking smile.<br />
<br />
The seat was cold to the touch but felt relatively comfortable on my back, so at least that&#39;s something. The Doctors assistant came over to us and made sure all the equipment was on safely then proceeded to put the helmets on each of us. She pulled out a pill bottle before giving us one each,<br />
<br />
&quot;This will make both of you go to sleep and prepare your bodies for the transfer. They should kick in relatively quickly&quot; she beamed, before giving us one of the pills each.<br />
<br />
Mariah hurriedly swallowed her one, whilst I did the same but more hesitantly. The effects seemed to occur quickly, my eyelids already getting heavy. The Doctor began counting down before suddenly pulling a switch. With a loud clunk, the hum of the machine began to roar, when suddenly I blacked out.</p>
