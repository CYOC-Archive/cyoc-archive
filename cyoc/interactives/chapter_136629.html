<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Authors Note : Sorry to whoever wrote the previous chapter, I altered it a tiny bit so that the rest will make sense, hope you enjoy.<br />
<br />
01’s life was pretty dull to anyone who’s ever lived a normal life, but to her it was fine. Never really having anything to lose her interest she had a strong attention span and followed orders, because she was raised and grew up doing that. She reached 15 and her body had filled out quite nicely, but nothing to the proportions of a Bimbofied person.<br />
When she was 19, she had nice orangey-brown hair and a few freckles under her eyes. Her eyes were green and her eyelashes were normal length. The similaritiy to a Bimbo was that she had above average lip size, they were under the minimum for a Bimbofied person but they were unnatural. Her chest was a B cup chest and a cute but not bimbo rear. She had a fine appearance and by the time she was 21, the base decided that she wasn’t a Bimbo. They took their last shot, ran it through the testing machine and concluded that she was in fact, not a bimbo. They released her among the other people and they all greeted her as an old friend. They’d say, “I saw you when you were just a baby,” or, “I remember doing ‘such and such’ with you when you were a child.”<br />
<br />
01 began to walk around the base, she met more people and got some food. She continued to walk when she noticed something that caught her eye, the fishing docks. Where the base would get some of their food from, she walked to the door and was stopped by some guards. They asked for her to tell them what she planned on doing down there. She responded with, “Well I’m 01, the little girl in the solitary box??” They both knew her and said, “Well I guess you’re just having a look around then aren’t you, just don’t stay out for too long, and stay around other people,”<br />
<br />
01 walked along the fortified bridge, she found herself standing behind two people sitting with their legs crossed fishing. She went a small bit closer then remembered what Winston told her, “If you are with companions, remember to announce that you’re going to them so they don’t panic and harm you,” so she shouted not too loud from a safe distance, “Hey, I’m coming over if that’s okay,” they both flinched in shock, one put their hand up in the ‘OK’ sign. She walked up and sat behind them, the first said, “Hello there, I’m Bryan,” they both shook hands, he was wearing gloves. He looked at the other and said, “This is my younger brotherJohn, he’s not used to people his age, even less girls that aren’t bimbos,” he hesitantly shook her hand. Bryan said, “and you are,”<br />
“Oh sorry, I’m 01, I was never given a name,”<br />
“Are you really, well you’ve changed since the last time I saw you,” said Bryan,<br />
“I’m not sure if you remember me.. we use to talk,” John finally said.<br />
“Yes I do remember, that’s where your face is from, and your name,” she said happily,<br />
“How about you two go and walk around for a bit, I think she’ll need a tour guide,”<br />
“But what about the fish??”<br />
“I can do it, go enjoy yourself, get to know each other a bit better,”<br />
<br />
John and 01 walked off, they talked for nearly the whole day. At 21:50 (9:50pm) 01 and John decided to get some rest, but just as 01 was walking off, John said, “Wait, I was just thinking, why don’t we simplify your name??”<br />
“To what??”<br />
“Well I just thought, ‘one’ sounds like Gwen,”<br />
“Gwen sounds great, I like it. I’m heading to sleep now, goodnight John,”<br />
“Goodnight Gwen,” he smiled, she smiled back, they walked their separate ways,”<br />
<br />
At 2 in the morning, Gwen woke up to screams of fear, she and many others ran into the centre to find a bimbo licking Ryan’s ear. Everyone saw and stepped back into their areas. As usual, the gates for each room closed shut. The executors walked out with radiation protection suits and machine guns. 4 of the 5 grabbed the bimbo and pinned it to the ground. The 5th walked and stepped behind her, he raised the gun to her head, and said, “Who was this before??” Ryan responded, “That was Carter, he found me getting a glass of water,”<br />
“How was he infected??”<br />
“I’m not sure, the last thing I think he ate was some fish,”<br />
“That was my fault then, I will be punished for this,” said Bryan,<br />
“You will, farewell Carter,” the executioner shot it in the head.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want you to kill me, I’ll do it, I don’t want to risk anyone else becoming infected,”<br />
He stood on edge off a nearby cliff, everyone watched from the tower, they all said in unison, “Farewell Ryan,” he shot himself in the head, he fell down the cliff and didn’t affect anyone else.<br />
<br />
After that, everyone had a shot taken from them and they were tested, luckily everyone was positive and weren’t infected.<br />
<br />
Most people got back to sleep, but Gwen couldn’t, she sat with her eyes wide open. She got up and went to get a glass of water. John walked in, “I’m not used to it either, apparently it happens every once in a while around here, so they’ve become decencitized to it,” She ran over and hugged him.<br />
