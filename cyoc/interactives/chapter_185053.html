<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The four newly turned were cats stood around and looked at each other and what they had become. Stacy ran her hands down her new black and dark grew fur covered panther body, while beside her Barbara stretched her new tigress body a bit she was already strong from years of kick boxing/boxing training but now she felt unstoppable. Lindsay was licking her new hand and using the wet fur to whip off James’ semen which still visible on her new short cut like muzzle, her snow leopard fur looked thicker than the fur on the others. The lion man James for his part looked a lot stronger but did not look the equal of Barbara, his short blonde hair had grown up and around his neck to make a thick mane. <br />
“What the fuck do we do?” inquired Barbara<br />
“We need to find a safe space.” Said Stacy as she eyed the path outside the little hidden garden area, they were currently in. The green while not full was busier then normal for this time at night and most people were heading away from them toward the nearby stadium where they could all hear the football game going on. Something inside her, told her they where in a bad spot and needed to find a safe place, that feeling was shared by them all, they need to get somewhere safe.<br />
“The house?” inquired Elizabeth<br />
“How do we get there?” inquired James “That is across town and towards the game and more people.”<br />
“The trees?” inquired Stacy as she looked up at the large trees which covered the green and lined the main road running from the college green on one edge of the school down pass the stadium to the side of the town where their house was. “We could climb them and use them, who would look up?”<br />
“That may work for you and Elizabeth but not James or myself.” Countered Barbara, something told her she wouldn’t be that graceful in the trees, she and James’ new bodies were made for power and not for climbing trees and stealth. <br />
“Where did you guys park your car?” inquired James<br />
“Parking garage near Smith Hall.” Answered Barbara “What are you thinking?”<br />
“Alright, Stacy goes get the car, and we meet her near that alley by the college bookstore, they are closed now.”  Stated James as he pointed across a semi-busy street toward some stores which had closed for the night.  <br />
“It’s our best bet.” Said Stacy as Barbara showed her new large fangs, but it wasn’t in anger more of annoyance, she didn’t want to risk her girlfriend going out alone, but they had no choice.<br />
“Alright.” Said Barbara as she went over to the remains of her pants and dug out the keys and tossed them to her girlfriend who caught it even in the near pitch blackness of the area, they were in. <br />
“Alright, I will be back soon.” Stated Stacy as she got down on all fours and moved with easy out the entrees into the night, before extending her claws and climbing a nearby tree. Barbara watched as Stacy took a massive leap from one tree, covering what had to be 25 or more feet and landing on the roof of a store on the other side of the street. Using the roof tops and trees it should not take her long to get to the parking building and their jeep.<br />
<br />
“We should pick up our cloths. It will raise questions.” Stated Elizabeth as they all nodded, for some reason they where not freaking out, they where enjoying the sense of power these new forms gave them, the increase senses and rush they got from simply being in this form. They quickly gathered their stuff and then moved toward the edge of the road, hiding in a darkened area by the road. <br />
<br />
“Ok…one at a time.” Said James as Elizabeth went first, running on all fours and staying low she ran across the road and into the ally behind the bookstore. There was a tense moment where they thought she was spotted but a human however he seamed more interested in something on his phone.  He passed by without not a care, Barbara and James went next and they where not spotted by any other human and together all three waited until Stacy returned driving Barbara’s jeep. They jumped into the vehicle and staying low began to drive back to the house. <br />
<br />
If anyone noticed that a Panther woman was driving a jeep they either brushed it off as something they where imagining or they simply didn’t believe what they where seeing. Soon they turned down the road where their house was and pulled into the driveway. Barbara pressed the remote garage door opener intending to have Stacy pull in, only to see her father’s pickup truck in the garage.<br />
<br />
“Crap, we may have a problem.” Cursed Barbara as Stacy came to a stop and turned off the jeep. They waited until the headlights turned off before exiting and heading toward the house. Once in garage they all stopped as Barbara bent down near a small pool of blood which sat on the concrete by the front of the jeep. <br />
<br />
“What is it?” inquired James as suddenly the door to the garage began to close as the door to the house open to show a large male humanoid lynx who which had blondish tan fur. <br />
<br />
“You need to be quieter.” Said the man with a playful grin.<br />
<br />
“Daddy.” Said Barbara who leapt forward and gave her father a hug, she had always been a daddy’s girl and now both of them had been transformed.<br />
<br />
“What nothing for me?” inquired a female voice as a reddish cougar women appeared in the darkened kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Mom.” Said Barbara as she was pulled into a hug by her now much smaller tigress daughter. She hug her as tightly as she could as her tail wrapped around her as well. Within a few moments a cheetah woman with short red hair joined them in the hug as well. A feline family stood in the kitchen hugging each other and purring together in happiness.<br />
<br />
“Little sister, you look great.” Said Barbara as they broke the hug and began to take each other in. <br />
<br />
“Thanks you too.” Said Lindsay as Barbara leaned forward and began to sniff her sister focusing on her neck. Lindsay would have blushed as she knew Barbara could smell Oscar’s scent on her and knew what that meant, instead she tensed a bit as her tail stopped moving. <br />
<br />
“Well…I guess we will talk later, now we need to figure out what we are doing.” Stated Barbara as all of them looked at each other. <br />
<br />
Lindsay a Cheetah woman, Oscar a Jaguar man, Barbara a tiger women, Stacy a Panther women, James a lion man, Elizabeth a snow leopard women, Lindsay/Barbara’s mother a cougar women and their father a lynx man. They knew that they could spread this gift and turn others like they had but they knew that was risky or they try to figure out what had happened to them.</p>
