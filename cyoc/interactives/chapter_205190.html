<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finally, Jason looked down at himself. And gasped. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Instead of the usual white t-shirt and briefs he normally slept in, Jason was now wearing a tie-died tank top and blue boxers that stretched down to the knees. But it wasn’t the clothes he wore that shocked him. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Overnight Jason had to have at least gained forty pounds. His arms and legs were thicker. with a rather noticeable beer belly stretching the waistline of his boxers. And yet he could still see the wide toes of enormous feet that he knew would fit perfectly into those clown shoes lined up in neat rows. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Now Jason was suddenly aware of his skin tone; instead of its usual tan it was a ruddy pink color. A touch of red filled the bottom of his field of vision. Gingerly he touched his nose, and felt a perfect, rubbery sphere a little bigger than a tennis ball. He gave it a squeeze. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
HONK! <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Jason stood up and walked to the dresser; with his new girth and big feet he could only move at a funny waddle. Despite what he was expecting, Jason’s jaw dropped at the reflection looking back at him. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
On Jason’s pink face white ovals surrounded his eyes and a white muzzle had formed around his mouth. The ovals around his eyes stretched up to his forehead and were topped with wide black eyebrows, giving him a surprised look. The look of surprise was accented by his eyes being outlined in black and topped with a vertical black bar making them look like exclamation marks. Inside his muzzle Jason’s lower lip was black and stretched halfway down to his chin with a little black circle on each end, forming a smile that mad his mouth look open all the time. Jason’s cheeks were blushed a rose-red with three black freckles that suited his chubby face quite well. And at the very center of Jason’s face his red nose stood out, big, round, and shiny. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
And the worst was his short brown hair was now a curly cherry red mass stretching out halfway across his shoulders-at least around the side and back of his head. But on top-Jason&#39;s hands went to his scalp; it felt bare and smooth. “Oh no, I’m bald!” he cried in horror. <br />
<br />
 “Don’t be silly, big brother, heheyaha.” Jason turned and somehow, he recognized his little twin sisters Marcy and Darcy standing just past the doorway. “Well, we are supposed to be silly, heheyaha,” Marcy added as she and Darcy waddled over to their brother. Marcy poked Jason’s big red nose. HONK! <br />
<br />
“Yeah heheyaha,” interjected Darcy. “After all-,” <br />
<br />
“WE’RE CLOWNS!” the twins said together simultaneously and squeezed their own noses. Honk! Honk! <br />
<br />
“I mean, heheyaha, your hair started falling out when you were twelve,” began Marcy. “You’ve been bald for more than a year-,” <br />
<br />
“-and you just started to notice now, heheyaha?” finished Darcy. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah, heheyaha,” he replied. Jason suddenly became aware of how deep and goofy his own voice sounded, and an involuntary giggle crept into his speech. <br />
<br />
 Jason looked at the twins. His sisters’ faces, like his own, had white patches around their eyes and white muzzles around their mouths but more feminine looking. Marcy’s eyelids were shaded baby blue and Darcy’s orange; both had long curly black eyelashes. Each twin had a dainty clown smile inside their muzzles; Marcy’s was black while Darcy’s was bright red. Both had red blush on their cheeks and a shiny red clown nose the size of a golf ball. The rest of Marcy’s complexion was sugary pink while Darcy’s was light orange. They wore their hair in curly twin-tails; Marcy’s was now cherry red like what was left of Jason’s and Darcy’s a dark green with orange highlights. <br />
<br />
The twins both wore long-sleeved turtleneck shirts coveralls; Marcy’s shirt had red and white horizontal stripes and her coveralls were blue with pink borders. By contrast, Darcy’s shirt was yellow with orange stripes and her coveralls green bordered with red. Each wore fingerless gloves matching their coveralls and socks that matched their shirts. Darcy was wearing green and yellow lollipop-toed mary janes; Marcy’s were red and blue.  <br />
<br />
“Now, c’mon, heheyaha,” Marcy continued in her silly voice. “You heard Dad; heheyaha. We’ve got a busy day ahead of us, first setting up the carnival for tonight, then our assigned jobs, and finally tonight’s performance.” <br />
<br />
“And remember, heheyaha,” said Darcy in a similar but slightly different voice, “he’s not just our father-,” <br />
<br />
“-he’s the BOSS CLOWN!” HONK! HONK! <br />
<br />
“All right, all right, heheyaha,” Jason replied. His own goofy voice irritated him, but he couldn’t do anything about it yet. He waddled over to his closet and picked out a long sleeved blue and white t-shirt, a pair of baggy blue jeans and a baggy yellow polo-shirt. He then from the clown shoes a pair of blue and white sneakers that looked normal enough-except for their oversized toes. He quickly put them on, then looked in the mirror. <br />
<br />
Marcy nodded in approval. “Lookin’ good bro, heheyaha.” <br />
<br />
Seeing a red flat-cap nearby, Jason put it on his head. He still looked like a clown but at least his bald pate was hidden. <br />
<br />
He waddled out of his room and followed his sisters downstairs. In the living room he saw his family and....</p>
