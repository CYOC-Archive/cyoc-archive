<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Al and Marcey, Rick's parents sat by the phone waiting and waiting for news on where their one and only son had wandered.<br />
<br />
Eleven-O-Clock and no news yet as the local police added Rick to a growing list of missing people and his car to the group of stolen.<br />
<br />
Al continued to sit up late as he urged his dear wife to retire. Tired, and needing to work the next day marcey did as her husband asked, but slept lightly that night.<br />
<br />
Morning came with the alarm clock, Six thirty, and Al was not in bed!<br />
<br />
Jumping out of bed, slipping on her slippers, robe, and off to the livingroom went Marcey.<br />
<br />
There sat Al, his head down, he'd fallen asleep waiting for the phone to ring. <br />
<br />
Soft loving hands touching his face awoke Al from his slumber. He looked up at his wife's face only to shake his head as if, no word!<br />
<br />
As both got ready for their day and Marcey was in the shower she heard the phone ring. Slam went the water off, a grab of her bathrobe as she darted out the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
Al stood talking on the phone, &quot;Yes, that's right, black, yup that's the license number, damaged, any sign of our son? Ok, you can call me on my cell phone I'll be home today, thanks officer, good bye!&quot; said Al.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Marcey.<br />
<br />
Al looked at his dear wife, &quot;That was officer Manning, they found Rick's car over at the Rankin Mill site parking lot. The car has some minor damage to the right front fender but otherwise is OK! They found some of Rick's clothing strewn about, it was torn, but no signs of blood or a fight. The nice officer Manning was still at the scene and will call me if anything new comes..... well I'll stay near the phone today!&quot; said Al as he took Marcey's shaking hands.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Officer Manning was standing by Rick's car as it was being loaded on the flatbed carrier to be taken to the Police impound lot. He was also calling animal control to come with their trailer and pick up the two wandering bovines.<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer Manning!&quot; blared his radio.<br />
<br />
&quot;Manning!&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenson, I'm inside Mill building nine, you need to see this!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;See what I'm busy!&quot; replied officer Manning as he waited on animal control.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not broadcasting what I found, you need to see it for yourself!&quot; said Officer Jenson.<br />
<br />
Moments later the truck and trailer from animal control rolled around the corner of the fenced parking lot. Office Manning pointed toward the two bulls as the two officers and their equipment headed in that direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm coming Jenson, Jenson, JENSON I'm coming!&quot; called Manning over the radio but with no response, this made him worried.<br />
<br />
Running toward the old stamping mill officer Manning was unstapping the holster of his gun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenson!&quot; yelled Officer Manning into the dank dark mill warehouse.<br />
<br />
A flick of his high powered flashlight moved about scanning for Jenson if standing or fallen and maybe out cold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenson! Officer Down, I need an ambulance to MIll number nine, warehouse, this is a code 3 ALERT ! called Officer Manning on his radio as he headed quickly toward the face down Officer.<br />
<br />
As Officer Manning approached his fallen Officer the sounds of Fire, Paramedic, and ambulance echoed the walls of the old mill.<br />
<br />
Kneeling down officer Manning looks at his fallen Officer. &quot;No bullets, no injuries, holy yuck what's all this stuff?&quot; says the Manning.<br />
<br />
Officer Jenson had found the one corner of the old mill where a eighteen year old boy was trapped and infected by one big Bull. The pints of white oily juices and cum was spread about the floor. Officer Jenson might have slipped and falling face first was then infected, yet all this Officer Manning was not then aware.<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer Manning I have a code 5 BIO Alert here!&quot; called Manning on his radio.<br />
<br />
&quot;Animal Control, contact Manning!&quot; ordered Manning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Animal Control, Becker!&quot; replied the officer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a code 5 BIO ALERT called, don't come in contact with those animals, they might also be infected!&quot; ordered Manning.<br />
<br />
&quot;HALT THERE !&quot; yelled officer Manning as the Ambulance and Paramedics came running toward Manning and his fallen Officer.<br />
<br />
&quot;But officer Jenson's ....!&quot; called the Ambulance driver.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nix it, unless you want to be infected and maybe die!&quot; yelled Manning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Manning you idiot!&quot; came the radio scream of the Chief of Police.<br />
<br />
&quot;Manning, Sir, I have need of the State police Bio Alert team and I need then NOW !&quot; said Manning.<br />
<br />
Silence, then, &quot;Right I'll call them myself!&quot; came the Chief's response.<br />
<br />
Urgent as it was the need to keep whatever had knocked Officer Jenson out cold was not to advance beyond the boudries of the old Mill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Base, Manning, I want a force of officers setting up a perimeter of security around the Mill's boundries! I want no, none, not on unauthorized person within these walls, do you understand me?&quot; broadcasted Officer Manning.<br />
<br />
Manning's broadcast was heard by amature radio buffs and all the way up to the State Police' main office. Law and order scrambled!<br />
<br />
Officer Manning removed his extra pair of laytex gloves from the back pocket, his one weapon for such an event. Slipping them on he kneeled down and rolled the fallen Officer over onto his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God!&quot; said Manning his voice and words of exclaim echoing the Mill's walls.<br />
<br />
&quot;What Manning what's wrong!&quot; came a radio call from one of the Officers standing outside the building.<br />
<br />
Officer Jenson had slipped in the juicy cum left by George when he infected Rick to the worst. As the Officer's bare skin face touched and was infected by the Radical Thyroid formula embedded in the semen and bodily juices of George the bull, he was in the first stages of physical change.<br />
<br />
Manning looked at his Officer and friend, that which was for the past minutes plunged into the yuck'o stuff covering that section of the Mill's floor had transitioned to animal hide. The beginning of white Hereford bovine hair was sprouting thickly out of the submerged part of Officer Jenson's face.<br />
<br />
Odd, and ugly for the sight of Manning was the constriction of Jenson's face as part looked and reminded Manning of those Hereford animals. One of jenson's ears had completely formed into that looking like a bovine ear. Pointed, long, covered in reddish short hairs with white hairs of two inches length sprouting within the curved lobe.<br />
<br />
As he moved the flashlight about Manning took quick note of officer Jenson's left hand. The hand too was pressed down into the thick slime covering the concrete floor. it too was infected and merged making a thumb, and two thick fingers. As Manning looked closer the thick fingers each had what looked and felt like hoof material covering the ends.<br />
<br />
A sigh from Jenson as his eyes opened. Manning flicked the flashlight to Jenson's face only to see the friendly smile change and dim to a face filled with the real agony of the man's transition of species.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy Jenson, I called for help, just lay there and take it easy!&quot; more or less ordered Manning his younger Officer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hia hora Hanna!&quot; Officer Jensen strained to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy buddy take it easy!&quot; Manning tried to calm the man.<br />
<br />
Jenson felt his hand changing and lifting the left hand up to look at why it felt so tough his eyes went wide open showing the terror me must have known.<br />
<br />
Manning looked at his friend's panic struck face and seeing the growing hair, his thick lips, merging nostrils to upper lip, and the cloven reforming of his hand, all this made Officer manning wonder about those two grazing Bulls.</p>
