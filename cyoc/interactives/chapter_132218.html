<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aiden heard the door click behind him which snapped him into focus, his anus and fully erect penis humming in pure escalate just laying there. With his sense of touch so heavily turned up he could barely focus on moving at all but he was able to vibrate his body slightly enough to give a tiny ounce of wiggle, but every twitch of motion only made his body&#39;s pleasure increase with no way to relieve himself with that permanently erect plastic cock.<br />
<br />
The thought of getting hazed a dude was definitely fully on his mind but a whole rugby team scared him. Aiden struggled with what little his body would move, he has to change these settings or if he even still can try to change himself back. Aiden continued to try to struggle to wiggle his stiff body off of the bed. The fabric rubbing against his plastic skin making it squeak with delight but Aiden was desperate and focused his feet was off of the bed and his legs were slowly wiggling off. He got his knees off in a few minutes and his thighs off of the bed after about 15. the further he went the slower his progress was. His whole body vibrating in pure bliss but he still had to get there.<br />
<br />
Suddenly his body&#39;s center of gravity shifted and he felt himself suddenly lift up and flipped backwards, his head banging onto the back of the desk with the keyboard just out of reach of his stuck open palms. Aiden stopped for a bit as his body wobbled with enjoyment from his flip, Aiden waited 30 minutes before attempting to turn around so his body would calm down a bit. Aiden found himself a lot easier to flip over since so little of his skin was touching anything but air. Aiden waddled back and forth and started to rock more and more until suddenly he flipped over, but now the keyboard was on his side and the only reason he didn&#39;t fall onto the floor was because the chair caught his fall, but now he was at an angle. <br />
<br />
Aiden had to reach that keyboard and change his settings but Aiden had so little mass and mobility to him all he could do was lay there and think of a solution. Aiden then thought of trying to snag his foot on the desk&#39;s side to pull the chair over to prop him up. He got his body sited in the armrest of the chair and began to wobble the chair back. After a few minutes, the keyboard was in front of him and the mouse...<br />
<br />
Aiden knew he couldn&#39;t type with his useless hands, so he had to bop the mouse with his wobbles to click around on the interface. With some effort Adien did manage to pull up his cronovac profile. Aiden felt so relieved that Geoff didn&#39;t sign out!. After a few more minutes, Aiden did manage to get the mouse to the UNDO button, and with a bit of pressure, there was a faint click... <br />
<br />
Aiden suddenly sighed as mobility returned and his body finally calmed down, his erect penis squirted out air to the sound only an inflatable can make, Aiden moaned in enjoyment to finally have release. Aiden gave himself a few more minutes just to enjoy the release before looking back at the screen, he got into position and his heart instantly sank. The cronivac only had a single undo button, meaning if he pressed it again he would go back to fully inanimate all over again. There was no way back to human again and the main menu was not opening, possibly due to Geoffs &quot;joke&quot; earlier where he made Aiden permanently a doll and hacked out of it. Even though he was permanently stuck as an inflatable doll, he did have some options Aiden wasnt skilled enough to try what geoff did to get to the main menu but he could try changing himself further before smashing the machine for good, or was he really just OK with being as he is now and disposing of the machine before he changed even more? Geoff would be home soon as it had been almost an hour for him to get to this menu so he had maybe 30 minutes tops to change what he wanted and dispose of the machine.<br />
<br />
Most of the options Aiden had were sensory changes and increases or body shape and and appearance, which seemed to be endless. Though a few others were the placement of his air valves and how many he had, if any; the option to add or remove body parts such as his fingers, anus or dick for removal or add paws, ears, horns, tails or wings, turn off his mobility again, and change from pvc plastic to latex rubber as well as his body&#39;s thickness and the option to add a squeaker like a dog toy as well as other balloon or inflatable related features. <br />
<br />
Aiden gave it some thought before making his decision, he had one last change to take his life back... given he can escape Geoff when he comes home and unlocks the door... Aiden took a single deep breath before deciding too...</p>
