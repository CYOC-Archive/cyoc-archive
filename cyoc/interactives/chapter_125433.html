<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob was an 18 year old man window shopping. He wasn&#39;t particularly unhappy with life, but he had graduated from high school over the summer and didn&#39;t know what to do with himself. After high school, he told himself he was just taking a gap year, but even in the 4 months that had passed, he hadn&#39;t applied to any colleges. He worked at a boring, low paying retail job. In fact, he hadn&#39;t gotten a raise in the 3 years he had worked there, even after switching to full time after school. Dwelling on this, he walked down the street, passing some boring shops.<br />
<br />
 He stopped in front of what he thought was a novelty shop. &quot;Magic Gifts and More!&quot; The name of the intrigued him, and he walked in. <br />
<br />
The store was relatively small, but it was filled to the brim with... Stuff. It looked more like a thrift store than a novelty store. Jacob found it odd that there wasn&#39;t a single other soul in the store, though he hadn&#39;t found the checkout counter yet. <br />
<br />
Still, he thought, it should be packed with people, especially in a town like this. Putting that aside, he explored the store before he heard a voice. &quot;Welcome, Jacob.&quot; Startled, he looked behind him, and saw a very attractive brunette lady behind the counter. &quot;How... How did you know my name?&quot; Jacob asked. &quot;You came to my store for a reason. I know your name because I summoned you here to fix your boring life.&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
 Jacob was stunned. &quot;With all due respect, how can I know to trust you, Miss...&quot; Jacob asked, hoping that he would both get an answer and know her name. &quot;Oh my, how rude of me.&quot; The woman said, and snapped her fingers. Jacob suddenly felt bad; he hadn&#39;t wanted to make her feel rude. &quot;You&#39;re not rude, Anna.&quot; Jacob said, and immediately covered his mouth. &quot;How... How did you do that?&quot; he asked, referring to the fact that she had just made her name known without saying a word. &quot;Now do you believe me, Jacob?&quot; Anna asked. &quot;Yes! Now please don&#39;t hurt me!&quot; Jacob said quickly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hurt you? Jacob, I need help, and I can help you in return. If you do not want to, you can leave now, and I&#39;ll never bother you again. Remember, most people will never see this store.&quot; Anna said. Jacob was skeptical but went along with it. &quot;What do you need help with, Anna?&quot; Jacob asked. &quot;There are magic mirrors that lead to different realities. These realities can be extremely outlandish, even fetish filled. One thing for certain is that these realities are much better than our own. They are created by magic picking random regular mirrors and enchanting them.&quot; Anna stated. <br />
<br />
Jacob was confused. &quot;Well, that&#39;s neat and all, but what do you need my help with?&quot; he asked. &quot;I have one here that no one has ever entered before. I want to find out what universe it contains.&quot; Anna explained. &quot;You want me to go in.&quot; Jacob said. &quot;Exactly.&quot; Anna said. Jacob was excited. <br />
<br />
Magic was real, and there was a different reality, better than his own that he could just go to? There had to be a catch. &quot;I must warn you, though, there are risks. This is a tall favor I am asking, I know, but I will reward you greatly.&quot; Anna said, confirming Jacob&#39;s fears. &quot;What kind of risks?&quot; Jacob asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, not all of them are known. But in the magic community, there a few theories. We measure happiness levels of these universes, and they far exceed normal human levels. This is either because the universe is simply that much better, or it&#39;s because the universe changes the inhabitants mental states. In addition, any subjects who go into the universe have their happiness levels rise as well. It&#39;s slow enough to prevent it, but there are also personality and body changes made when entering the other universes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Personality and body changes?&quot; Jacob gulped. &quot;Yes, to fit into the universe.&quot; Anna said. &quot;How many people have gone into these universes?&quot; Jacob asked. &quot;Only a few dozen have been known. The amount of people that returned seems to be greater than the amount that stayed, however.&quot; Anna replied. &quot;...stayed? As in, abandoned their own universe?&quot; Jacob asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, for lack of a better term.&quot; Anna said. &quot;Their happiness levels grow so high that they don&#39;t want to come back. Occasionally, this results in changes in memory to fit the new universe.&quot; Jacob was stunned. The last part scared him; memory changes? Happiness levels that go so high that you don&#39;t want to leave? This whole thing was freaky. But it was better than his own life. Anna interrupted his thoughts. &quot;Again, I understand that this is a tall order, but I promise it won&#39;t be boring. I believe you will come back, and once you do, you will lead a comfortable, fun life.&quot; Anna promised. <br />
<br />
<br />
Jacob couldn&#39;t argue with her. He was bored of his life. &quot;Fuck it, why not? Even if I do end up stuck in another universe at least I&#39;ll be happy.&quot; he thought. &quot;Oh, Jacob, there is one more thing. While you are gone, the magic will make it so no one notices you are gone. It will alter reality slightly, and only magical beings like me will notice that you&#39;re missing.&quot; Anna said. That gave Jacob the final push he needed. No one would be bothered by his leaving? He was excited. &quot;I&#39;ll do it!&quot; he said, and Anna smiled warmly. &quot;Thank you, Jacob. There is one thing I must do before you take the mirror.&quot; Anna said. <br />
<br />
She came up close to Jacob and pushed her forehead against his. Jacob was slightly freaked out, and then felt an odd feeling in his head. &quot;What... What is that, Anna?&quot; Jacob said, but words didn&#39;t come out. &quot;We need a way to communicate while you are in this other reality. We can now talk telepathically, and I can read your happiness levels.&quot; Anna said to him telepathically. &quot;That&#39;s so cool!&quot; Jacob thought. However, since he didn&#39;t think it specifically to Anna, she didn&#39;t hear it. &quot;I hope it&#39;s okay, Jacob. Maybe I should&#39;ve said something before hand...&quot; Anna started, but Jacob stopped her. &quot;It&#39;s more than fine, Anna, it&#39;s amazing!&quot; Jacob told her. Anna relaxed. &quot;Okay, Jacob, I will give you the mirror. You will bring it to your house and stand it in your room. You will slowly enter. From what I have gathered, your body will change, and you will enter the universe.&quot; Anna said, and Jacob nodded. <br />
<br />
Anna picked up the mirror from the back of the store and handed into Jacob. Jacob left, and about 20 minutes later returned home. He put the mirror in his room and left it, going to get a snack. Suddenly, he heard Anna&#39;s voice again. &quot;Jacob, I forgot to mention, if you stay in the universe for extended periods of time, the magic of it may attract other people unhappy with their lives. If you see anyone new in the other reality, don&#39;t panic.&quot; Anna said, and that made Jacob slightly worried. Permanently changing his own life, he was OK with. But he didn&#39;t want to mess up anyone else&#39;s. Still, Anna had said people bored with their lives, and this new universe was supposed to be infinitely better... &quot;Got it, Anna.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
At about midnight, he readied himself to enter. &quot;Anna, I&#39;m going in.&quot; he said to her, telepathically. &quot;Ok, Jacob. Remember, you must document what this universe is and what happens to your body.&quot; Anna said. &quot;Yes, Anna, I understand.&quot; Jacob said, and walked up to the mirror. He touched the mirror, and instead of the cold glass he was expecting, it shimmered and allowed his hand in. He felt a warmth on the other side. &quot;Woah... Guess it&#39;s now or never...&quot; he said as he stripped down before entering. <br />
<br />
He walked in and immediately felt odd. His body was changing, he could feel it. It was... Pleasurable, though odd. He felt his bones crack and rearrange, and felt expansion in places he hadn&#39;t expected. His hips cracked and expanded, his legs grew, and he gradually became a she. Massive breasts grew on her chest, and her hips and ass grew to what would be impossible proportions in her reality. Her waist thinned to the point where a corset wouldn&#39;t even exaggerate her figure. <br />
Finally, it stopped, and she found herself standing in a similar looking bedroom to her own. &quot;Anna?&quot; Jacob thought. Jacob felt that her name would be natural as Jenna at the same time. &quot;Jacob, are you female?&quot; Anna asked. &quot;Yes, and a very voluptuous one at that. My body would be impossible in our reality. By the way, could you call me Jenna? I think that&#39;s this form&#39;s name.&quot; Jenna said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting... So it does adjust your mind. By voluptuous, what do you mean?&quot; Anna asked. Jenna walked over to the mirror, which still functioned as a normal one, and replied. &quot;Sexy, impossibly so. I look like a photoshopped picture.&quot; Jenna said. She looked and found not a single blemish on her face or body. She was about 5&#39;6&quot;, 3 inches shorter than her male self. Her long, black hair was perfect, and she had a model&#39;s face, with striking green eyes and plump lips. &quot;Are you sure it seems impossible?&quot; Anna asked. &quot;It absolutely is. My face looks like it has makeup, though I think that&#39;s its natural look. There&#39;s not a blemish on this body. The breasts, hips, and ass would be too big and the waist much too thin without surgery, and I should be having crazy back pain.&quot; Jenna said. Anna was fascinated. &quot;Jenna, you don&#39;t think that this could possibly be a universe where women are sex toys?&quot; Anna asked. <br />
<br />
Jenna thought for a second and replied. &quot;I definitely don&#39;t think so. If it were, I think I&#39;d be attracted to men, but when I think of sex I think of women with similar bodies.&quot; Jenna said. Anna was even more fascinated. &quot;I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re in a female version of your bedroom. Can you find a measuring tape?&quot; Anna asked. &quot;Yes, I will look.&quot; Jenna said. She walked into a walk in closet, filled with risqué clothing tailored for her extreme body. Looking through, she found a measuring tape... And a box of sex toys, obviously made for both of her holes. &quot;This reality seems to have a lot more luxury items than our real one... And I feel a higher libido.&quot; Jenna said to Anna. &quot;Interesting... That reminds me.&quot; Anna said, and she used her magic to check Jenna&#39;s libido levels. What she saw shocked her. Meanwhile, Jenna was measuring her body when she heard Anna gasp.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Is everything OK Anna?&quot; Jenna asked. &quot;Yes... It&#39;s fine... I&#39;m just surprised you&#39;re not doubled over in lust right now. Your libido is thirty times higher than an average male in our reality.&quot; Anna replied. Jenna was shocked yet it still felt natural. She looked at the measurements she&#39;d taken. &quot;Its not just libido that&#39;s impossible here, Anna. My measurements are 50-22-56.&quot; Jenna told Anna. Anna let out an audible gasp. &quot;What kind of universe is this?!&quot; Anna asked. <br />
<br />
Jenna replied, &quot;I&#39;m not sure but I think I&#39;m going to find out. My brain is telling me something rather odd. Instead of having to use the bathroom, it appears the women of this reality orgasm and lactate instead. The milk is used in lieu of cow&#39;s milk.&quot; Anna was shocked again. &quot;This is crazy! Human milk instead of cows milk?&quot; Anna said. &quot;You did say that there would be fetishes at play.&quot; Jenna said. &quot;You&#39;re right, you&#39;re right. Why don&#39;t you keep exploring and tell me what else is new in this reality?&quot;</p>
