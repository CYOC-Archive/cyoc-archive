<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning Bobby woke up with a difficulty breathing.He<br />
<br />
remembered the flash of heat and light from the ring,and then his skin <br />
<br />
had begun to itch fiercely.After that he had blacked out,and now he seemed <br />
<br />
to be in his bed and the air was thin and cold.Though his furniture seemed to <br />
<br />
still be there with his clothing thrown sloppily over it,everything else was <br />
<br />
different.Where he should be staring at a light yellow plastered wall were<br />
<br />
dark shades of green,black and brown wallpaper which had the texture<br />
<br />
of sandpaper.The room was dim,and as his eyes adjusted to the dim<br />
<br />
light he noticed his video games and gameboy were gone.Had he looked<br />
<br />
further he also would have noticed there were no electrical outlets or any<br />
<br />
indication that this room belonged in a technologically advanced society.<br />
<br />
                  What he did notice was that where his cross and baptismal font <br />
<br />
used to be now towered a 7 foot tall statue of a dragon with its wings stretched <br />
<br />
over three smaller statues of dragons.The three smaller statues had their forepaws raised <br />
<br />
as if begging for something.Bobby looked for his bible and where it used to be on his dresser <br />
<br />
sat a 2 foot wickedly pointed ivory horn with various runes carved into it.Bobby took another <br />
<br />
look at that big statue and was startled to discover it held on one taloned finger the ruby ring.<br />
<br />
The talon was pointing out in one direction and that is how Bobby noticed his bedroom window.<br />
<br />
                He walked up to the window and looked about.He appeared to be living in a tall mountain<br />
<br />
and all along the rock face he could see other square windows like his own.His was about 3 by 3 feet<br />
<br />
square but others appeared to be extraordinarily huge,20 by 20 feet and he could see into the rooms<br />
<br />
the windows led into.He could see the white curved sticks and the round sheperical objects<br />
<br />
scattered about the floor of the other rooms.Then he went away from his window and looked on<br />
<br />
the inside.His room too had once had a huge window,but it had been bricked in.Where his door<br />
<br />
stood was more brickwork and Bobby got the sense that everything had been scaled down <br />
<br />
just for him.<br />
<br />
          He went back to the window and looked down just in time to see the huge horned dragon leap out <br />
<br />
of the window beneath his.The winged beast flew off into the clouds below and vanished from <br />
<br />
sight.Bobbys legs were slowly turning to jelly but he was a liitle more reassured when he heard<br />
<br />
his mom calling out to him that dad was going out to pickup some fast food and would be back in a <br />
<br />
few minutes.She wanted him to brush his teeth and get his clothes on as dad was getting a <br />
<br />
special treat for his son.<br />
<br />
               That all went out the window a few minutes later when the dragon returned carrying<br />
<br />
a screaming bundle,a female girl in its paws.Bobby just stared slack jawed as the dragon entered <br />
<br />
the window beneath him.Suddenly the screaming stopped with a CRACK sound and a few<br />
<br />
seconds later Bobby could hear his mom and dad and brother and sister chatting excitedly<br />
<br />
over the treat the family would have for breakfast.<br />
<br />
              BOBBY,YOUNG MAN COME DOWN THIS INSTANCE called up his mom<br />
<br />
WE HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR YOU<br />
<br />
                 Well by that time Bobby was already out the window and was scrabbling <br />
<br />
for a foothold as he made his way away from dragons,weird families and screaming <br />
<br />
girls.He didn't hang around for any explanations from his parents.<br />
<br />
                Bobby made his way away from the mountains and away from the nuturing care<br />
<br />
of his fellow dragons.He found his way into a large city of what he thought were his fellow humans.<br />
<br />
They told him of shape shifting dragons who lived in nearby mountain lairs who could take<br />
<br />
on a human form with the aid of their dragon goddess Histh.They talked of how the dragons would<br />
<br />
swoop down upon humans and seize a few to be taken back to their ovens for broiling.As the dragons<br />
<br />
put iT &quot;COOKED MAMMALS TASTE BETTER WITH KETCHUP&quot;<br />
<br />
            Bobby didn't say anything to them,but he looked carefully at his nails <br />
<br />
to see if they were sharpening.He was slowly realizing why those unholy thoughts and<br />
<br />
culinary urges were awakening in him.<br />
<br />
          When it finally came he was walking down a country road in the general direction of the <br />
<br />
mountains.The land was so flat and featureless,with not even a tree to hide behind.He was running<br />
<br />
along the road when suddenly his skin seemed to stretch thin and his ribs began to break as they<br />
<br />
burst out and expanded out of his chest.He just managed to make it behind a tall tobacco <br />
<br />
kiln when he began screaming from the pain.It was his first time after all.His mom and dad had <br />
<br />
done this sort of thing for decades and had learned hoe to block out the pain.<br />
<br />
         A neighbouring farmer heard the screams and ran out with his shotgun to help<br />
<br />
whoever was in distress.Then the screaming stopped and all the farmer could<br />
<br />
hear was the chirp of the cicadas.The fellow was looking at one tobacco kiln <br />
<br />
in the moonlit night when the building suddenly went dark.Something was<br />
<br />
blocking the moonlight.<br />
<br />
                 He looked up to see a great horned head slowly rising above the roof and could hear the <br />
<br />
sound of rippling growing muscles stretching out enlarging wings to blot out the night sky.<br />
<br />
The chirping was replaced by the slow stedy rythmic THUMPA THUMPA THUMPA<br />
<br />
of a swelling dragon heart.The tobacco kiln began to splinter and topple over as the<br />
<br />
beast continued to grow.<br />
<br />
                  Bobby felt an intense urge to eat and he roared thunderously<br />
<br />
as he lashed out his long coiled neck to snatch up the juicy morsel in his <br />
<br />
curved razor sharp teeth.Then he flew home to his mom and dad.</p>
