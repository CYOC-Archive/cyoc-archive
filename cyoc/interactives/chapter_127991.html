<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">     Derek shivered as his alterations began to take place. With the new memories of this altered reality, Derek remembered that he was now bigger than his father Elias, and knew that the man was now intimidated of his son. Though Elias would put his foot down and parent when he had to, he also understood that at the end of the day Derek could do whatever he wanted due to the sheer size difference between them. Despite this, he was still quite proud of his son.<br />
     Knowing he could take some spare time, Derek quickly went further up his mother&#39;s half of the tree, and altered his grandfather&#39;s father, Joseph. Previously, the man had been fairly large, but was not at quite the same level as his own son (Derek&#39;s grandfather). Derek suspected it was the combination of Joseph and his wife Romilda which allowed for the largeness and masculinity of their progeny.<br />
    After making some alterations, it was clear that Joseph was a god among men. Standing at 6&#39;08&quot; and 320 lbs., Joseph dwarfed those around him, as opposed to his previous 6&#39;01&quot; and 190 lbs.. Furthermore, his hair was coal black, and could be found practically everywhere on his body. In his portrait on the Derek&#39;s computer, Joseph had so much hair that it could clearly be seen spilling out the top of his severly stretched shirt. Also visible in the image was Joseph&#39;s chiseled lantern jaw; the man looked like he could take a chunk out of a steel beam with only his mouth. To top it all off, he was hung like a mule at a soft 11&quot;. Derek felt a little weird making such an alteration, but felt better in that he wasn&#39;t just changing the events and outcomes of his own birth, but also of those people from Joseph and later.<br />
     After setting the timer for a 15 minute delay, Derek pressed ok and watched the portraits of Joseph&#39;s kin change immediately. The most noticeable was that of his grandfather Antonio; while certainly big before, he was absolutely massive now, tower at 6&#39;10&quot; and 340 lbs.. His hair, already dark to begin with, shadowed over more. Like his father, his shirt made an ill attempt to hide his body hair. Furthermore. Another quick look found that his mother was now another inch taller and even more beautiful, despite the massive levels of masculinity present in her genetic line.<br />
     Now sitting at the dinner table, Derek held back a moan of pleasure. He felt himself sitting taller at the table than before, first feeling his vantage point change in conjunction with stretching feelings in his spine, and then after a brief pause in time with his ass inflating; it had grown so.much that it affected his seated height. derek now certainly had a massive squatters ass. The growth continued, and looking down past where his shirt was riding up, Derek could see his hairy abs carve themselves deeper into his stomach. After a minute, he noticed that a fourth set had cut themselves below his previously present six pack.<br />
     Derek was in such awe and pleasure that, after excusing himself from the table, went upstairs to his room. On his way past the table, Derek noticed his brother, who oblivious to any changes over taking him, was also sitting higher in his chair. <br />
     Out of sight of the table, Derek ran to once again look at himself in his mirror. In the time it took to get from the first floor to the second, Derek&#39;s massive biceps had inflated to cannon ball hardness, and definitely larger than that in size. Likewise, hi foreaems were like large ham hocks, snd were bigger than most mens thighs. His arms were attached to shoulders that were at least basketball sized, but were definitely firmer than any orange ball he had ever seen (which now reminded Derek; his hands were so much larger now he could easily palm such a ball). <br />
     Derek&#39;s pecs had suffered a similar fate, ripping his shirt slightly down the middle, and exposing his hairy chest. As he looked, Derek saw his all ready furry chest become absolutely covered in coarse curly black hair. Taking off his shirt, but ripping it off in the process, Derek saw that his entire torso was coated in the same hair, reaching down into his too tight shorts all the way up to his the base of his neck. Lifting up an arm to flex, Derek saw his huge hairy deep pits. They were so full of the coarse black hair he could not see the skin underneath. In the process of lifting his arm, he caught a massive wiff of his stink. While he reeked of sweat and testosterone, Derek also found that he enjoyed the smell somehow. <br />
    Derek looked down at his legs. Down on the floor, Derek&#39;s feet had long since ripped through his socks. His toes, now also hairy with whisps of black hair, stretched so far from his ankles that he suspected his feet were size 19 at least. Up past them, his calves were, like his forearms, larger than most men&#39;s legs and shaggier than a dog. His thighs stretched the shorts he was waring to nearly their limits, which had already been pulled high up his legs due to his increased height. As he watched, more black hair sprouted on them and the muscles carved themselves deeper, making the shorts strain even more. While it was incredibly hot to watch, Derek was getting uncomfortable, and with a flex of his thighs, he moaned in pleasure and the poor shorts ripped down the sides and fell to thr floor, leaving him only in his also strained briefs. <br />
     Looking down again, Derek felt a tug on his well sized junk. Sure enough, his crotch was expanding and showing through the briefs. He moaned again, this time deeper than the last, and watched as more pitch black pubes rose above his waist band. Gasping, Derek jumped as his dick stretched out longer and thicker, and felt his balls swell and lower. This continued for several more minutes, Derek eventually reaching down to massage his growing package, gasping, panting, and moaning all the while. Finally, with a immensely deep bass moan, which he quickly muffled as best he could. Derek&#39;s fat prick and hefty nuts burst from their fabric prison and out into the open air, shooting thick ropes of cum up and onto both Derek and his mirror. Derek came for several minutes, losing track of the number of times he shot after 15. These weren&#39;t quick spurts either, Derek noticed in his horny sex haze, but long extended jerks from his balls out his cock. <br />
     Taking a short rest on his bed, Derek examined his body. He was gigantic, and incredibly handsome. His dark hair had receded some, and straightened to reflect his great grandfathers. Furthermore, his eyes flashed a piercing blue, which was both an unnerving and incredibly hot combination with his olive Mediterranean heritage. Turning his head sideways, Derek looked at his jawline, which was now sharp and thick. His beard, which before had been full bit short, was now grown out at least an inch from his face. And covered much of his cheeks down under his chin and stretched to just touch his also reaching chest curls.<br />
    Derek rose and reached for the measuring tape which had appeared on his desk with the last reality change. Taking some quick stats and standing on his scale, Derek measured himself to be 7&#39;01&quot; and weighing 403 lbs. He was so astounded by his weight that he measured again to be certain. The second time reading his weight caused a stir in his balls, and quickly pulled out his tape again before his dick grew hard at all. The measure read 13&quot; long amd 8 around soft, and with a few long hefty tugs for a minute, Derek was able to find that those numbers increased to 18&quot; by 10. While he was one fuck of a shower, he certainly was a grower too. <br />
     Derek was getting ready to measure his other stats when his father called from the stairs.<br />
     &quot;Derek, you best get down here and finish your dinner! I heard a lot of banging up there and so help me God if you&#39;re on your weight set again I&#39;m taking apart and bringing it to the scrap yard!&quot;<br />
     Looking behind himself, Derek watched as his room grew, and in the added space a massive and expensive home gym appeared. Derek knew his new father would never even attempt such a thing with him, but he knew to respect his father&#39;s dwindling authority.<br />
     &quot;Coming dad!&quot; Derek boomed in his incredible deep bass, audibly shaking the house and the weights across the room. His voice was deeped than his dads now. His crotch stirred again, but he would have to attend to it again later as he stuffed it the best he could into a special order 4XL jock he pulled out of his dresser drawer.</p>
