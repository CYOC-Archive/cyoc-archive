<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike and Kevin both got dressed which was also an interesting situation. They fell over while trying to put their pants on because they still had not got the coordination of being two halves sewn together. The shirt was not so bad. Oddly enough, it had two neck holes already. It&#39;s a good thing they were twins already otherwise their halves probably wouldn&#39;t have come together very well. They were identical on either side. Unfortunately for them, so were the two doors. One lead to the outside world where they would have to cope with being conjoined twin brothers now or they could continue to try and fix this problem of theirs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead. Make your choice.&quot; The computer voice said. It was kind of rude, to be honest.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; Kevin said, to his newly joined brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the way I see it. Either choice is just as likely. We have no idea which door is which but each way we go would have equal results, so to speak. On one hand, we get out but we deal with everyone&#39;s questions about how we became conjoined and possible experimentation on us. On the other, we keep playing and possibly fix this or maybe make it worse. We&#39;re really better off just picking one at random. It doesn&#39;t matter either way, but that&#39;s my side. Your the other now.&quot; He said, jokingly. Mike thought about what his brother said and he agreed. The chances of either happening were exactly the same. There really wasn&#39;t a point to choosing one or the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just go left. Like you said, it doesn&#39;t matter.&quot; Mike and Kevin nodded to one another and stepped through the right door. It was a hallway that didn&#39;t really seem like an exit. Just a deeper tunnel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations subjects! You have chosen to remain as you are!&quot; The computerized voice said in obviously mock enthusiasm. Depressing party horn played over the intercom; black and white party confetti fell from the ceiling around the twins. &quot;The two of you are free to leave.&quot; <br />
<br />
At the far end of the deep tunnel, bright light poured through as a mechanical door creaked open. Neither of the brothers could tell what was on the other side, but with little other choice, they took very slow and careful steps in that direction. Their steps were slow not because they were hesitant to trust the voice, though they were. Their steps were slow and unsteady because of the lack of coordination. Moving their individual halves in tandem was a task in an of it self, and neither of them were looking forward to the idea of being this way for the rest of their lives if this truly was an exit. <br />
<br />
Kevin and Mike stopped just in front of the doorway to what did appear to be their freedom. They could clearly hear cars pass by and children laughing from a far. A smile crossed Mike&#39;s face when the undeniably distinct voice of their cranky neighbor Mr Wilson yelling at someone reached his ears. &quot;This really is an exit.&quot; Mike said, more to himself then his twin. &quot;We can leave.&quot; Mike tried to take the first step forward, but Kevin held him back. Mike felt the tug along the center of their chest. Kevin was leaning back towards the dark hallway. &quot;What are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike...&quot; Kevin whispered. If their heads weren&#39;t so close, Mike would not have heard his brother. &quot;We can&#39;t just leave. Look at us.&quot; Kevin motioned with his hand. &quot;That psycho conjoined us. How are we going to live like this? How are we going to explain this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we escape, we can get help. We can get the police to storm in here, and make the guy separate us!&quot; Mike exclaimed. &quot;We have to get out of here before it&#39;s too late.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin&#39;s voice rose in panic and anger. &quot;You really think the police will find anything!&quot; He stared at his twin with a hard expression. &quot;If we leave, he&#39;ll be long gone by the time the police arrive. He&#39;ll either take or destroy anything useful. We&#39;ll be stuck as conjoined twins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what&#39;s the other option!&quot; Mike fired back. &quot;Ask him to let us rejoin his sick game!&quot; He tried to hold back the fear he was feeling. &quot;I was turned into a freaking rat! I was almost eaten by a sn-&quot; It was difficult to mention the animal he was deeply afraid of. A tear fell from his eye. &quot;A snake. I was almost eaten by a snake.&quot; His throat was getting raw as some of the emotion from that memory was coming back. Panic. Terror. &quot;He fused us together! He can and will do worse if we go back! I--I&#39;m not going back!&quot; <br />
<br />
The computerized words from before rang in Kevin&#39;s ears. He remembered the voice warning them, &#39;However, now of two minds, both of you must agree on which path to take.&#39; Kevin looked away from Mike and glared up at the ceiling. He know that the psycho was watching them from somewhere, and probably laughing hysterically at their predicament.</p>
