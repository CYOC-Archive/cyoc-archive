<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jae and Park watched the newly born twins head away from the soccer pitch.  Jae felt a bit of pride fill his chest as he realized the diversity the crew he had created so far.  He knew that a lot of crews tended to be only one or 2 nationalities or races, but he wanted his to be as diverse as his imagination allowed.  As they reached the front of the building, Jae grabbed Park, wrapped his arms around him and embraced him tightly.  He then pressed his lips onto Park&#39;s.  &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
The night was pretty non-eventful.  Ever since his transformation, he hadn&#39;t seen hide nor hair of his parents...or his little brother for that matter.  Oh well, they were probably out at a movie and his was exhausted.  He didn&#39;t give it a second thought and crashed.  The next morning, as he was getting out of the shower, he wiped the condensation from the mirror and looked over his body.  The memory of his life before his transformation had become hazier with each passing day.  He only had a vague memory of the teen he was and that was blurry at best. He ran his hand over his pec and watched as the muscles in his 18 inch bicep and his forearm flexed.  He was mildly turned on, but he saw the time on his cell phone and realized he was running late;  he&#39;d have Park take care of it either during the day or after school.  He quickly pulled up a pair of boxers, followed by a pair of jeans that had rips in all the right places.  He then grabbed an adidas muscleshirt that looked like it was painted on, showing off his abs, pecs and arms.   He quickly put some gel in his hair and thundered down the stairs grabbing his backpack and put on his Osirus Decays and grabbed his board and left.<br />
<br />
***************************************************************************************<br />
What Jae didnt know, was the reason he hadn&#39;t seen his family was because they were in what can only be described as a kind of stasis.  When Jae made his changes, he ignored a couple of options:<br />
       &quot;Do you want changes that you made to your ethnicity/lifestyle/environment to impact family members immediately?&quot;  (he had left this as No where the default was 24-48 hours.)<br />
So when he left, it had been about 24 hours since he had made the changes to himself.  As the door slammed shut behind, unbeknownst to him, his brother&#39;s eyes opened.  <br />
<br />
When Kai woke up that morning, he had no memory of his life before as Kyle, nor any memory of the fact that he had gone from a pudgy 8 year old blonde little boy to a 13 year old rail thin Korean boy.  He had always marveled at his older brother because he was not just smart as hell but he was built and had amazing musculature.  He wasn&#39;t a thin Korean boy, he was built.  He had always looked up to Jae.  In fact if they weren&#39;t brothers, he&#39;s probably have a crush on him.  Thankfully, his brother&#39;s best friend, Park, had fulfilled any fantasy.  Kai had no idea that Jae and Park were dating.<br />
<br />
After splashing some water on his face, Kai made his way to his brother&#39;s room.  He was bored and his brother&#39;s room had all the cool stuff - the big tv, the most current game systems with some awesome games, even his computer was better.  Since his computer was still on, Kai immediately gravitated to it.  The maker program had still been running since its last use.  <br />
<br />
Kai opened up the program and on first glance, thought it was some kind of SIMS knockoff.  He immediately decided to create a profile for himself.  Upon entering his name, the program showed an image of him.  Kai assumed that it just scanned it from the camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can make myself into any kind of character I want!  I bet this game is more like Second Life.&quot;  Kai then considered what he wanted to do.  He considered making a character similar to the ones in his comics or manga but then remembered it was his brother&#39;s computer.  &quot;I wonder what I&#39;d look like if I looked more like Kai....&quot; he thought to himself.  <br />
<br />
He decided to make his character 19.  He then watched as the image on screen grew to 5&#39;9, but still rail thin.  He changed his height to 6&#39;0.  He found it odd that the next question the program asked him was what type of personality he had.  He added that he played soccer and swam in high school but the character had gotten into college on a swimming scholarship.  He knew how to skateboard, like his brother.  He decided to retain his intelligence.  Last he decided to keep his character gay and a member of the Nu Alpha Phi fraternity.  He then paused...and decided to click save....that way when he downloaded the game on his computer he would be able to play with the character.<br />
<br />
He felt a zap from the computer as energy ran through his body.  He grew from 5&#39;0 to 6&#39;0.  It felt like a stretch he couldn&#39;t quite finish as he body stretched.  &quot;What is happening to me?!?!?&quot;  He yelled out.  He ran to the ffull length mirror in his brother&#39;s room and watch as grew and aged to 19.  As soon as he reached 6&#39;0, he felt a cramp in his calves as they grew, then the same happened to his thighs.  They ballooned with the muscles of someone who spent hours in the water swimming, shredding his pajama bottoms.  He suddenly felt very horny as testicles enlarged along with his cock, which grew to 9 inches.  Then he felt his abs push out and enlarge.  The growth then spread to his chest and arms.  Kai watched as his pecs balloon out, stretching tight against his shirt.  Then he watched as his hands grew to a size that would paddle him through the water with great ease and speed.  His forearms grew next and then his biceps, until they were the size of softballs, shredding the sleaves of his shirt.  His waist had stabilized at a size 30 waist.  As his pecs and arms grew, his back muscles grew to muscles that had spent years in the pool.  Kai watched as his face matured.  His hair grew out a little longer.  &quot;whoa!&quot;  He said in a new deep voice.  Then he yelled out in pain, grabbing his head as his memories changed.  He remembered teaching his little brother the basics of soccer that allowed him to become a star on the field.  He remembered giving his brother his first skateboard and teaching him to skate.  He remembered taking his brother, and his bullied best friend, to work out and watching as they went from a tiny little boys to the buff teenagers.  He remembered thinking how cute Park was too.   He then watched as his clothes seemed to liquify and then reform.  He watched the briefs he had shredded reform into a black speedo.  He then watched as his shredded pajamas reformed into a tight pair of jeans.  His shirt became a red and grey striped muscleshirt.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude that was trippy!&quot;  Kai exclaimed.  He stood and admired his physique in the mirror.   From his size 11 bare feet to his chest and abs and arms, Kai was hot. He had no memory of being the weedy little brother...now he was the older brother that his younger brother Jae looked up to.  He then unbuttoned his jeans and firmly grabbed his cock.  &quot;Oh yeah....this is gonna rock!&quot;<br />
<br />
*********************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
After what had been a pretty run of the mill day, Jae and Park arrived back at Jae&#39;s house.  As soon as they closed the door, their hands were all over each other.  Park immediately ripped Jae&#39;s muscle shirt off and started devouring his chest.  As he did this, Jae guided him upstairs to his room.  The last thing he wanted was his parents to walk in.  Park slowly made his way up to Jae&#39;s inviting mouth.  They made their way down the hall to the end, where Jae&#39;s room was.  As they reached the door, Jae ripped Park&#39;s shirt off.  &quot;You are so damn sexy!&quot; He said as they crashed through into Jae&#39;s room and stumbled and landed on Jae&#39;s bed, not noticing that they weren&#39;t alone.<br />
<br />
Kai turned from the mirror and saw his brother and his brother&#39;s best friend making out passionately and exclaimed &quot;Well, Well....what have we here?&quot; as he grinned.</p>
