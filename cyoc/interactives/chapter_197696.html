<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the options, Jeff had selected the &quot;perfect for each other&quot; checkbox, he knew that even the best of couples have fights. Relationships take tons of work, and he didn&#39;t want occasional spats to hurt his father any more than he had been already. He&#39;s already been through so much. They all have. Jeff anticipated that this would ensure that not only is Jeff the perfect wife for his father but that his personality would mold to his father&#39;s in ways to ensure even occasional issues don&#39;t arise, being the best fit for the family as a whole.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s changes should take an hour to complete, turning him into the perfect wife for his dad in mind and body. He was eager to see what he would become. But a part of him was increasingly curious how the other three will interact with him during those changes, especially Mike.<br />
<br />
Wait, Mike? Jeff looked at his dad closely. Yep, that was Mike, er, his dad’s name. Wow, was his mind changing that quickly? He looked over himself. Had his body or his clothes changed yet? He was still wearing the leather jacket and the jeans. His shoes looked a little different. His watch had grown larger. Jeff did notice that his chest was sticking out a little more than it usually did. It didn’t feel like he was wearing a bra, yet.<br />
<br />
The doorbell rang. That must be the pizza. David, Mike, and Katie looked to the front door.<br />
<br />
“David, can you go get that? There should be cash on the counter behind you,” Mike, Jeff’s dad, said.<br />
<br />
“Me?” David repeated. “Why can’t Jeff do it?” Jeff looked at him straight in the eyes, questioningly. That was when Jeff realized he had become the same height as David now.<br />
<br />
“Because I asked you to do it,” Mike said curtly. David rolled his eyes and walked away. Jeff looked to Mike. Mike shook his head sympathetically. He seemed worried that Jeff would be upset. Jeff couldn’t help himself and smiled a little bit. Mike relaxed a little and Jeff noticed his frame seemed smaller. David came back in with the boxes of pizza and set them on the table. Jeff instinctively chose the chair next to Mike and grabbed a plate.<br />
<br />
“So,” Katie spoke up and asked, “have you started dating anyone yet?” The question surprised Jeff. He had never known his sister to be that upfront about Mike’s dating habits.<br />
<br />
David seemed just as surprised and nearly choked on his soda. “Jeez, twerp, you might need to work on your delivery there.”<br />
<br />
Katie scowled at him. “I’m fifteen now. Don’t call me a twerp.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, and I’m eighteen. Besides it’s just a nickname, not an insult,” David argued. <br />
<br />
&#39;Kids, they&#39;re something else&#39; Jeff thought to himself with a smirk... though that was s strange thought because he was the middle child wasn&#39;t he? Mike cleared his throat and spoke up, “To answer your question, Katie, I have not started dating anyone.” Mike&#39;s voice seemed higher than usual.<br />
<br />
“You know, it’s okay to date someone,” David added. “We’re okay with it.”<br />
<br />
“I know you are, and I’m immensely grateful,” Mike replied. He glanced at Jeff briefly with a smile before turning to his kids. Jeff took a quiet sip of his beer. This surprised Jeff once again. He wasn’t thinking about David and Katie as his siblings anymore. They were Mike’s kids. That, and Jeff was old enough to drink beer now. He checked the large, leather-strapped watch on his wrist. It was 6:15. He looked down at his body, expecting to see some more changes.<br />
<br />
He was surprised to find that he was still wearing a leather jacket and a blue flannel shirt. The shirt was pushed out significantly, but not by a pair of tits, but by a pair of large pecs. His hands were slightly larger and hairier. He scratched at his face, realizing there was a coating of stubble there now. Was this right? Jeff was turning into an older, muscular man! He wasn’t turning into a woman at all! Was Mike gay this whole time?<br />
<br />
“The truth is, I have noticed someone I&#39;m interested in.” Mike coughed again his voice climbing higher. “They do make me happy.” He nervously glanced at you before continuing, “So, it’s less that I don’t feel okay with dating someone, it’s more that there is a person, and I&#39;m working on trying to tell them.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” David and Katie both replied. They shared a look with each other.<br />
<br />
“Did you know?” David asked Jeff directly piecing things together.<br />
<br />
“I didn&#39;t realize,” Jeff replied, realizing with a start that his voice was much deeper than before. Michelle nervously rubbed her fingers together. “But this is excellent, you deserve nothing but happiness.” Jeff raised his beer to Michelle in a toasting motion and took a swig. Michelle looked at him with relief and relaxed her small shoulders. Her hair fell into her eyes and she brushed it away. It was kind of cute and endearing.<br />
<br />
“We just want you to be happy, Mom.” Katie slowly said. David nodded.<br />
<br />
“Any man to have you in their life is a lucky man indeed!” Jeff added, realizing with a start that his voice was even deeper than before. “And if you like this guy, you should go for it. The worst he could say is no, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
“Right,” Michelle said with a smile. They resumed eating their pizza in silence. Jeff glanced at his watch again. 6:25. He checked himself over once more and saw that his arms and shoulders had thickened. His sneakers had been completely replaced by some brown dress shoes. His jeans were black now. He wore a stylish brown belt now. His leather jacket was now hanging in the coat closet in the hall. Jeff took another sip of his beer while Michelle did the same with her glass of wine. Michelle looked different, though Jeff was having a little trouble placing it, maybe her chest was bigger, but not by much. Her face was flawless, and her eyes were stunning, even in the less than flattering light of the dining room. She wore a dark purple dress and some black leggings. She looked ravishing and more than a little sexy in that outfit.<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked, realizing that he was just checking his own dad out. Well, Michelle really wasn’t his dad by this point, nor even a man. So Jeff guessed it wasn’t too weird anymore. He couldn’t help but admire her ass in that dress as she stood to take the plates over to the sink. Jeff slowly got to his feet while Michelle’s kids cleaned the table and left the kitchen. She began to wash the dishes by hand.<br />
<br />
“Mind if I help?” Jeff asked, sidling up next to Michelle with a smile. Jeff was now taller than her by a good six inches. She looked up at him with a soft smile.<br />
<br />
“Thanks for coming over,” <br />
<br />
“Of course,” Jeff said. He rolled up the sleeves of his blue flannel shirt, exposing the thick muscles in his forearms. He took the watch off and set it to the side. He plunged his hands into the soapy water and began scrubbing the plates.<br />
<br />
“You know what you said about going for it?” Michelle asked. Jeff smiled and nodded. His heart was pounding in his chest. Was she about to say what Jeff wanted her to say? “Well, if it’s okay with you,” her hand found Jeff’s in the soapy water and grabbed onto it, “I’d like to try to go for it with you.”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled broadly. “I was hoping you’d say that.” He leaned in and kissed Michelle. He reached up to grab the back of Michelle’s head. His hand was still wet though, and Jeff accidentally splashed soapy water all over her face. Michelle laughed and splashed Jeff right back, breaking their kiss. Jeff laughed and grabbed the hose attached to the sink. He started spraying Michelle back. She recoiled and laughed.<br />
<br />
“Okay, okay! You win!” she laughed and giggled. Grinning, Jeff put the hose back and pulled Michelle in for a big hug.<br />
<br />
Jeff whispered into Michelle’s ear, “Sorry, sweetie. Forgot my hand was in there.” He kissed his girlfriend again.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay,” Michelle replied. “But now my shirt’s all wet.”<br />
<br />
“Oh darn, what a shame,” Jeff sarcastically complained. “I guess that means you should take it off.” Jeff took his flannel shirt off with ease, exposing the bright green tank-top underneath. It struggled to keep Jeff’s muscles in place. Michelle glanced down and bit her lip. Jeff flexed his pecs teasingly. He reached for the zipper on Michelle&#39;s dress. She swatted Jeff’s hands away.<br />
<br />
“The kids are just in the other room!” she hissed with a giggle.<br />
<br />
“Then let’s take this upstairs then,” Jeff replied with a raised eyebrow. Blushing, Michelle nodded and quickly turned to go up the stairs. Jeff picked up his watch and noted the time: 6:50. He glanced and smiled at the engagement ring on his finger before quickly following his fiancé up to their bedroom.</p>
