<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he layer in in the bask of his amazing climax Jacob heard a loud knock on the door.<br />
<br />
   For a second Jacob was scared that someone had heard him masturbating and was checking out what happened when a sudden idea popped in his mind.<br />
<br />
   Standing up as new ideas of lust hit his minding, the horny teen made two new wishes &quot;I wish that I emitted pheromones that made anyone who smelled them would get incredibly horny for my cock, I also wish that my buttplug would also keep vibrating at max power.&quot; Suddenly as his wishes came true, Jacob was immediately assaulted with a new wave of lust as his buttplug went to work instantly heavily vibrating in his asshole, absolutely dominating Jacob&#39;s prostrate as he fumbled downstairs the intense pleasure making his tasty red cock pop out of his sheath once more as Jacob was having trouble not to groan or scream in pure lustful rage.<br />
<br />
     Slowly he reached the door, getting ready to grab whoever was on the other side and pull them into his house where he would have his absolute way with them. As Jacob opened the door, a sudden flash of light appeared out of nowhere making Jacob go blind for a moment.<br />
<br />
    His vision was hazy as his eyes opened and saw nothing but a empty void, his buttplug was still inside him but was inert. Looking down he still had his canine member but it was back in it&#39;s sheath.<br />
<br />
      Then appearing out of nowhere was no ordinary man.<br />
<br />
   In a pristine black suit and a briefcase at his side was a lean muscular man with rough almost scale like red skin and two onyx black horns growing out of his head curling like a ram&#39;s horn.<br />
<br />
   The man with his pupiless orange eyes smiled at the naked teen and without lettting Jacob the chance to speak said.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Now now, I know I&#39;m a handsome devil but you didn&#39;t have to strip to quickly!&quot; The said in a spokesperson type of voice, laughing at his own voice.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Who are you?&quot; Jacob said, clearly confused but surprisingly not scared.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Well, if you couldn&#39;t tell, I&#39;m a demon, specifically the type who makes deals and boy do I have a deal for you!&quot; He said, pointing a clawed finger at Jacob.<br />
<br />
     &quot;What type of deal?&quot; <br />
<br />
  &quot;The same type your Grandfather made so many long years ago.&quot; The demon said.<br />
<br />
   &quot;My grandfather? Does this have to do with the gift he gave me?&quot; Jacob said, the pieces in his mind starting to come together.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Bingo! Now I&#39;ll keep it simple, your Grandfather after your parents had married was starting to get quite old and frankly missed the young lustful pleasures he had with all sorts of girls back in his twenties so did some research into the occult and made a deal with me. I gave him the magic buttplug that you have in your ass right now and in return he had to give me his soul which I would later use as a bargaining chip to elevate myself into a higher position of power in the underworld.&quot;<br />
 <br />
 &quot;So the buttpkug is yours? Do you want it back?&quot;  Jacob asked.<br />
<br />
      &quot;Oh no no, that deal is permanent but your Gramps wasn&#39;t some fool, he was smart and had me agree to a second part of the deal. He knew he had no chances of ever getting his soul back so he wanted to benefit his grandson who at the time was still only about a year old. That grandson wa story if you couldn&#39;t tell.&quot; The demon explained. <br />
<br />
  &quot;So what was the second part of the deal?&quot; <br />
<br />
  &quot;Simple, he knew your father would not have any part of my devilish mischief so he asked me if on your sixteenth birthday to deliver a note he wrote to you as well as giving you the buttplug.&quot;<br />
<br />
       &quot;Wow, so my parents don&#39;t know about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;Nope.&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;Then... what now?&quot; Jacob asked.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I&#39;m glad you asked, well given your little show you put on back there in your house, you gave me an idea... I want to make a deal with you, don&#39;t worry I&#39;m not interested in your soul, I got enough of those to fill a mountain if I wanted to.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Jacob stared at the demon, unsure whether to trust him or not but his curiosity won over him, cautiously asking the demon &quot;What do you have in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Well Jacob, the buttplug I gave your grandfather is actually quite weak, with it you would only be able to change minor parts of your body like for instance a animal cock like the one you have there, but it can&#39;t really do anything else. But if you accept my deal your buttplug won&#39;t just be version 1.0 anymore, it&#39;ll be version 12.0!&quot; The demon said excitedly.<br />
<br />
   &quot;What would it be able to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;Oh so much more, you would be able to change your gender, change your species, give your telepathic powers, allow you to shapeshifter into anyone or anything you&#39;ve seen before, and even allow you to cast some spells and possibly even allow you to turn into a demon yourself! But there are two main features I think we are both interested in...&quot; the demon said, drawing Jacob in.<br />
<br />
  &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;With your upgraded buttplug, you&#39;ll be able to create more subservient versions of them with the same powers as yours! Simply wish for another one and it&#39;ll pop right into your hands! But that&#39;s not all, if you manage to seduce another living thing the buttplug would infect them and they&#39;ll turn into fully loyal and subservient to you, they&#39;ll still keep their personalities but they would practically see you as a god! Even the strongest demons wouldn&#39;t be able to change that! Imagine, a town, no a nation of people each with their own buttplugs continuously fucking and spreading their infection to everyone they meet, and they would all be yours. &quot; the demon said, clearly trying to push into Jacob&#39;s lustful side.<br />
<br />
      It was working, even the thought of it was making Jacob horny, imagining his own parents coming home, only to become loyal members of his army as he spread his influence over everyone, the very thought of that almost made him orgasm right there on the spot! But that didn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t have his own doubts.<br />
<br />
  &quot;That sounds amazing... but what do you get in return?&quot; Jacob asked suspiciously.<br />
<br />
  &quot;What do I get? Simple, demons become stronger the more humans give into their dark desires, so for every human you corrupt, I&#39;ll be indirectly benefiting from them. You yourself will be paying no cost. You won&#39;t be giving up your soul, your body, nothing that you value or cherish will be affected in the slightest. It&#39;s actually a kinder deal than what most demons would give you, then again, I&#39;m not just some regular demon myself.&quot; The demon said holding out his hand. <br />
<br />
  &quot;Shake my hand and let&#39;s make that deal happen.&quot; He said, a grin on his face.<br />
<br />
   Jacob looked at his hand and...</p>
