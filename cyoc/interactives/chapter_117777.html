<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Backtracking<br />
<br />
Sitting in his study, Benton was pondering the possibilities of the flyer placed on his town car. Reading it as Amanda drove them home and silently chuckling to himself. It wasn’t long after arriving home that Benton hightailed it to his study; ignoring his butler George and the were-cheetah maids. Benton gets on his private phone making a few calls; putting out feelers for who might know who is the current leader of the Luna Brotherhood. Much to his surprise, Benton gets a phone call; not from one of his contacts, but from a person with a thick accent. Surprised to find out that the head of the Luna Brotherhood was in town, Benton was further stunned that the man was personally assisting a local werewolf in rebuilding the Seattle chapter.<br />
<br />
“Is there any way we can meet,” Benton speaking; “you and this local who left a leaflet on my car?”<br />
“What is it you wish to discuss,” the man on the other line speaking; “joining the organization?”<br />
“Not quite,” Benton speaking; “but I do have considerable resources that I’d be willing to contribute.”<br />
“The Luna Brotherhood has been self-sufficient since its inception,” the man responding; “since the days when we fought against the tyranny of the ruling nobles of Wallachia. We were even able to remain cohesive during the days of the Soviet Union controlling Eastern Europe with an Iron Fist. What can you provide?”<br />
 <br />
Benton paused for the moment; never thinking much beyond making initial contact, it was his intention to try and gather information.<br />
“I’m waiting for an answer,” the man on the other end speaking.<br />
“I’m Benton Knight,” Benton responding; “you know what I can offer. If you want to discuss this further, then come by my estate tomorrow afternoon. Both you and the Seattle head.”<br />
Benton hangs up the phone before the Romanian on the other line can respond. Leaning back in his chair for a moment as he thinks; Benton is interrupted with a knock on his study door.<br />
“What is it,” Benton shouting; irritated at being disturbed.<br />
“Frieda has arrived home,” George speaking through the door.<br />
“Oh,” Benton’s surly mood fading; “I’ll be done in a few minutes.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Leaving his study and walking to the kitchen; Benton sees his daughter sitting on a stool munching on a sandwich that Ethel prepared. His keen sense of smell picks up that Frieda had more fun that the travelling carnival provided.<br />
“Hope you got all that out of your system,” Benton opening the fridge door to grab a soda; “next time for that fun won’t be until Friday.”<br />
“Perhaps,” Frieda grinning; “but you never know what the next day might bring.”<br />
“Not while we are still under a were-alert,” Benton shaking his head.<br />
“A were-alert that everyone started to ignore dad,” Frieda scoffing; “even you had to have heard about that mobster from California getting arrested.”<br />
“Among other things,” Benton sipping his soda; “come with me so we can have a private talk.”<br />
<br />
Frieda grabs her sandwich as she follows Benton to his study; surprised to be in here as he has made repeated demands for her not to come in, demands that Frieda has repeatedly ignored. She is motioned to sit down in a nearby chair as Benton follows suit.<br />
“While Frederick Parker was arrested today,” Benton speaking calmly; “another situation has come to light. I’m sure you are well aware that I have been in a long running feud with Jack Crawford.”<br />
“Isn’t he the man that married the woman that announced she was running for mayor,” Frieda speaking up.<br />
“Yes,” Benton pausing as he holds back a growl; “she has a sordid past that your uncle was able to unearth. You will no doubt here about it tomorrow during your first day at school. But that is not what I want to talk to you about.”<br />
“Than what is it,” Frieda looking at her father as fidgets nervously; watching the were-panther try to do his best to remain calm.<br />
“Jack Crawford,” Benton unable to not growl upon mentioning the name; “had my therapy sessions with Frances Twist bugged. He violated my privacy as I discussed my feelings and issues in confidence with the doctor.”<br />
“Oh boy,” Frieda sighing; “I hope you don’t intend to do something stupid, like attack the man. Like you tried to do with Daisuke,” Frieda recalling the moment that made everyone realizes something was wrong with the Knight patriarch.<br />
<br />
“Can’t promise that,” Benton doing his best to remain calm; “that is entirely up to the elder council.”<br />
“Why is it up to them,” Frieda looking at her father as he uses some breathing exercises to try and not roil with rage.<br />
“Tachibana gave them both summon scrolls to appear before the council tomorrow morning,” Benton starting to speak a little more quickly; “they are to answer for some incidents that both are suspected of orchestrating. One being how the new elementary school was being delayed.”<br />
“Didn’t I hear you swearing over a Jack Ashford,” Frieda looking confused; “as the one responsible for the new school being delayed?”<br />
“Jack Ashford is an alias of Jack Crawford,” Benton unable to stifle another growl; “a fact that your uncle was able to point out with his investigation regarding Kenya Adaeze.”<br />
“Oh I know her,” Frieda recognizing the name; “she use to date Nate Anderson. Is this the same Kenya that tried to announce her mayoral plan earlier today?”<br />
“The same,” Benton absently crushing the empty soda can in his hand; “but how did you know her?”<br />
“Last year,” Frieda answering; “she kind of crashed the party I had for the former staff at The Local Diner. Asking Eric if he knew where his brother was. I don’t think Eric knew the two broke up then. From what got from Eric,” Frieda eliciting a half smile; “Nate was seeing a were-leopardess at the time. Around the same time he started to fall for the were-lioness he has been seen with of late.”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Benton nodding; “everyone knows of Jean Talbot. Leon’s daughter,” Benton remembering seeing her around the council building back when he was the were-panther rep. “Getting back on topic,” Benton shaking such thoughts from his head; “I want to remind you on what we discussed about talking to those you don’t know that approach you.”<br />
“Oh please,” Frieda rolling her eyes; “not this again. Only an idiot or a fool would risk trying to harm me.”<br />
“Never the less,” Benton uttering a low growl; “I want you to be extra careful, just in case someone tries anything foolish, like harm you in an attempt to come after me.”<br />
“They would have to go through Eric and Spencer first just to get to me,” Frieda snorting; “plus I’m not without ways to defend myself.”<br />
“Yes, claws and teeth,” Benton knowing where this is going; “but you know the risks in shifting during the daylight or in front of normals that do not know of our existence. But that doesn’t mean I’m not going to worry over you.”<br />
“Then get a couple of guard dogs,” Frieda looking bemused; “at least then we won’t have  repeat of last Saturday evening.”<br />
“Not this again,” Benton recalling the argument he had with Amanda yesterday over the benefits of such a security measure. A measure that would of kept several of Frederick Parker’s men from trying to break into his home while he and Amanda were out. Leaving Frieda, Eric a and Spencer alone with three were-tiger cubs they were minding while George was starting to retire for the evening.<br />
“You know me and mom are going to keep badgering you about this,” Frieda getting up; “the sooner you give in, the better.”<br />
“Your mother has made that clear already,” Benton grumbling; “just try and not worry over me if you hear me swearing and snarling more of late. It’s just new ways a certain thorn in my side has found ways to irritate me.”<br />
“Just as long as you maintain you medication and appointments,&quot; Frieda looking at her father.<br />
<br />
Benton nods as Frieda gives him a quick kiss before leaving his study. Sighing as he is alone again; Benton calmly removes his suit. Disrobing as he effortlessly shifts into his were-panther fursona. With black fur and menacing amber eyes; Benton gets up and stretches. His tail stands straight and horizontal as he tenses his muscles; a feline like sound emanates as he yawns while admiring his retractable claws after flexing his paws.<br />
<br />
Heading back to his desk, Benton sits back down just as his cellphone rings. Looking at the caller i.d, Benton growls as he sees the number. Knowing it was Tachibana he answers it only to growl even more.<br />
“I never expected you to call me,” Benton snarling; “what is it you want.”<br />
“My grandmother has instructed me to inform you,” Daisuke answering; “you should know that the council meeting for tomorrow will be postponed.”<br />
“For what reason,” Benton clearly letting the were-fox on the other end hear his hostility towards him.<br />
“Jack Crawford and his wife Kenya,” Daisuke knowing what will happen next; “have left town.”<br />
“So someone finally had the balls to tell you were-foxes to shove it,” Benton smiling as he knew he could do something to the Crawford’s without the council’s interference.<br />
<br />
“Before you do something stupid Benton,” Daisuke not taking the bait; “Jack Crawford sent a message to my grandmother. Said message was the summon scrolls he and his wife were given in ripped pieces along with a note,” Daisuke not giving Benton a chance to get a word in edgewise; “the note threatened to expose all the weres the world over if any harm comes to him or his family. Since you have had dealings with this man…”<br />
“If I had my way,” Benton snarling; “my code omega would have left him penniless and destitute. But the bastard had a way of coming through unscathed.”<br />
“Be that as it may,” Daisuke not caring about the feud Benton has with Jack; “my grandmother is taking the threat seriously. The entire council is being convened for and emergency session here at her estate.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not coming,” Benton responding sharply; “I have my own matters to attend to.” Benton hanging up the phone preventing Daisuke from responding. The were-panther feels an unbridled rage building with in him, yet he manages to suppress the urge to start tossing items and destroying his study in the process. Instead he makes a call to an unknown associate.<br />
“It’s me,” Benton holding back the urge to roar; “Jack Crawford has declared war on us all. Make the arraignments in case the existence of were’s is revealed to the world.”<br />
“No,” Benton growling; “Jack Crawford cannot be harmed. Physically that is,” Benton adding; “but if you see an opportunity to render him insolvent, you have my permission to proceed.”<br />
Benton hangs up and stares out the windows of his study; thankful for the glass separating him from the outside world is polarized and keeps those outside from looking in. Ensuring he and his family can walk about the estate in their fursona.</p>
