<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eli&#39;s chest heaved up and down as he felt his balls churn, goddamn did he find the tiny man breedable.<br />
<br />
Ricardo grabbed the camera, &quot;Hey lets take a picture!&quot; he said with a cute grin on his face. Eli huffed, eager to entertain. He smirked, and cockily leaned his head over as Ricardo feebly held the camera aloft. Easily, he support Ricardo&#39;s hand, before Ricardo reeled back and showed a peace sign as he kissed Eli&#39;s cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say cheese,&quot; Eli said, deeply as Ricardo grinned as cute as possible. Suddenly, Eli pushed the camera to Ricardo just as the tinier man spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Eli-&quot; And just like that, Ricardo found himself changing under the light of the camera once more.<br />
<br />
[FLASH]<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got <I>work</I>, kid, and so do you.&quot; Rich grumbled, running a hand through his bearded face. <br />
<br />
At 34 years old, Rich had built himself up from nothing, a beanpole in highscool but now a fitness coach and current Paramore of his bodybuilding trainee. He pushed Eli&#39;s camera out the way as the bulky man chuckled deeply, Rich still naked as the day he was born as he rose out of bed and made notes of his surroundings. The walls were a modern gray, and reality had changed to where what was once Ricardo&#39;s bedroom filled to the brim with boy band posters and statues of cartoon series was changed into Eli&#39;s bachelor pad. A picture of Eli flaring a most muscular pose in a skimpy silver poser displayed prominently across from the window, and a set of well worn weights took place of where originally was a bookcase for Rick&#39;s books.<br />
<br />
Eli growled, watching the generousness of Rich&#39;s hairy ass, and made clicking sounds as he pretended to take shots.<br />
<br />
Rich rumbled, &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be training?&quot; To which Eli flexed his bicep and licked it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Been there, done that, don&#39;t I deserve a break?&quot; He asked. <br />
<br />
Rich sighed, rolling his eyes as he looked for something decent to wear. He strolled to the dresser and pulled a drawer, only to see an entire half filled with speedos and posers, the other athletic socks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you have anything better to wear around the house?&quot; Rich asked.<br />
<br />
Eli smiled. &quot;Nah, I don&#39;t like to wear anything. I look better that way, don&#39;t you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
While Eli ogled himself and continued to worship himself as life&#39;s greatest gift, Rich peered into the mirror and took stock of himself. He was still thick, muscle gutted to the point his chest was waging war with the distended abs that peeked from years of heavy duty training, a retirement from the competitive scene, and then repurposing to labor. His thick brown beard had hints of red, a trait of his mother&#39;s side, and his short, shallow haircut was his hint that the years didn&#39;t stop coming. But the sledgehammer of a cock and the thighs that could break apart a melon excited him, as did the fur pelt that graced his barrel chest. He was a god, his veins trailed like a map across his arms and his back was enough to dwarf most doorframes on virtue of width alone.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he felt himself stiffen as Eli came from behind, his arousal touching and finding purchase between his ass cheeks as Eli kissed his neck. The gold chain that Rich wore jingled slightly, as he noticed and grabbed the gold Rolex watch he had set before Eli&#39;s incessant love making.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re insatiable, kid.&quot; Rich groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blame the roids, bro. Excess Testosterone.&quot; Eli retorted, cupping Rich&#39;s ample chest and rubbing a thick nipple. Rich hissed, hand grabbing Eli&#39;s before melting into him slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just another fuck sesh, coach...&quot; Eli said, dripping with lust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly, I&#39;m your coach, not your, mm, your fuck toy, boy.&quot; Rich asserted, but try as he might, he couldn&#39;t help but want it too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your loss,&quot; Eli said, kissing his cheek and smacking his ass before turning away. He walked to the bed, where a black tank top and shorts had laid out for him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Toss me my jock, will ya?&quot; Eli said. Rich humored him, he had reason to point out he wasn&#39;t a maid, but watching Eli sway to and fro &quot;pondering&quot; what to wear made him relish how lucky he was fucking and being fucked by a younger man. Women were great, but, nothing turned him on the pounding into Eli and vice versa.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what&#39;s with the vintage toy?&quot; Rich asked, putting on a pair of white briefs as Eli was already getting dressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dunno, think it was my dad&#39;s old thing. Wanted to use it for the fitness gram, but, you think it&#39;ll be too much?&quot; Eli snickered, making a pout.<br />
<br />
Rich smiled. &quot;Knowing you? Excess is your middle name. Grab it, maybe we can use it as a prop or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli held the camera aloft in his hands as Rich walked to the restroom, heavy footsteps falling and the hallway making a familiar creak. Something was off about this thing, something more than usual. Unaware of its powers or the reality of the camera, all Eli could think was simply that it was an odd family heirloom, but he had more important things coming up. For one, he had a workout session with his trainer to post.<br />
<br />
He grabbed a string bag that rested by the bed and stuffed the camera in, alongside his water bottle, some protein bars, and an extra poser or two for Rich to select for locker room shenanigans. Life was good.<br />
<br />
As Eli went down, he couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the weird item that laid in his bag. What was the damn thing anyway? And where did it come from? He didn&#39;t really <I>feel</I> like things were off, but were they? Was it Rich?<br />
<br />
He continued to ponder while Rich came down and grabbed a bottle of water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready?&quot; Rich asked, and Eli looked at him, as though analyzing him.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yeah,&quot; Eli said, quietly ruminating about life. <br />
<br />
Rich took a moment as he held the door open for Eli and noticed his change in demeanor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you mad at me?&quot; Rich asked, as Eli stretched and made sure his sneakers were laced.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No, I uh, it&#39;s this camera, I don&#39;t really remember what&#39;s this thing about.&quot; Eli said, pulling the string bag back to pull the item out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... Well, it&#39;s a camera, why don&#39;t you just, give it back to your pops or just, put it up?&quot; Rich pointed, clicking his car keys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Yeah, maybe I oughta.&quot; Eli murmured.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, do you mind if I just, take a picture of something real quick? I just wanna get this out the way before I do anything.&quot; He continued, pulling himself into the red muscle car that Rich painstakingly maintained.<br />
<br />
Rich stared at him for a second, but closed his eyes and nodded. He  and rolled down and flicked off the engine. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, take a shot.&quot; Rich noted, taking the time out to check his phone while Eli peered out the window. A woman with her dog were walking as they were talking on the phone. Children were playing and running down the street. And old woman was rocking her chair as a relative came to check on her. It was an idyllic, friendly neighborhood that Eli hadn&#39;t really taken the time to watch over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take your time, but I&#39;m not in the mood for anything.&quot; Rich said, rather grumpy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, big guy, you look amazing,&quot; Eli joked, still gazing out at the scene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I&#39;m old enough, we can see all we want of each other at the gym.&quot; Rich said, asserting his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright, but the more you deny how hot you are, the more I&#39;ll want to tell you.&quot; Eli spoke, eyes gazing.</p>
