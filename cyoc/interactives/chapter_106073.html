<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once Eric was finished changing his clothes, he came back down to see Nate finishing setting the table. It was shortly confirmed that the Twists would be staying over for dinner; the fact that William extended the dining room table further realized this. While Eric had no animosity to the Twists; he did find them to be nosey busybodies. Keeping this thought to himself, he takes a seat at the table just as everyone else does.<br />
<br />
With his newly enhanced senses; Eric could smell that his mother had cooked roast beef and baked potatoes with butter glazed carrots and candied yams. The yams were clearly a leftover from their thanksgiving feast, but Eric wasn’t complaining. Thanks to Julie, he barely had anything to eat and was clearly starving. He also smelled a key lime pie. Since key lime was his favorite, this dinner was also a celebration of him becoming a were-panther; despite all that happened at school today.<br />
<br />
“So, Eric;” His mother Martha asked.” How was your day?”<br />
<br />
While he knew that his parent knew what happened; with Nate telling them all about the school drama and getting a better understanding from the principal. It was clear that they also wanted to hear from him as well. Knowing full well that it wasn’t going to go away; He told everyone at the table everything that happen. Eric told them that Frieda scratched him at the start of school. He explained to them it was a precautionary act in-case Julie tried to spoil “their” after class plans. “Their”, meaning himself, Spencer Lawson and Frieda knight. Frieda was right to do that he stated; because Julie did try to spoil it all by trying to attack both him and Frieda during lunch period. Because of that he never had a chance to eat lunch.<br />
<br />
Martha hearing the part that Eric never had any lunch hurt her to a degree, but was glad her son was no worse for wear. Yet Nate decides to pipe up.<br />
“you going to share what you three did after class,” giving a wink and a sly smile.<br />
“NATE!” William shouts. “Did I not tell you that Eric will tell when he is ready?” Before Nate could answer, William continues, “Also that is not an appropriate topic at the dinner table; especially when guests are present.”<br />
Nate looks like he was made to swallow castor oil, after being chided by his father. Yet Eric knew he wasn’t going to let it lay. Fortunately with dad present, he was able to enjoy seeing his brother realize his mistake and keep his mouth shut to save himself from further embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“You know, Eric;” Samantha chiming in.” Frances here is an excellent therapist if you need to talk in confidence?”<br />
Eric is silent while he is finishing his second helping of roast beef. “No offense, Mrs. Twist, but I don’t need therapy.” Eric continues, “Besides, if anyone is in need of therapy, it’s Julie Stovall.”<br />
“True,” Frances chimes in. “But with what Julie tried on you yesterday; we thought you might wanted someone to talk to.”<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s face went red. Someone told the Twists what Julie tried to do when she shoved her hand down his pants. Apart from his after school paramour; that incident is something he was hoping to keep quiet. Clearly that was not to be. Yet before he could speak, Martha interrupted.<br />
<br />
“Who is up for pie?” Martha gets up to get the pie cooling in the fridge.<br />
Eric taking this as an opening gets up to help clear the table and enter the kitchen as well.<br />
Noticing Eric, Martha asks; “Is something wrong dear?<br />
“How did they know about the incident from yesterday?” Eric demands while trying to keep his voice low.<br />
“Your father and I only found out about it today Eric.” She continues, “Besides; you should have told us when it happened. Nate told us shortly after we arrived at school.”<br />
“That still doesn’t explain how they know,” Eric responds.<br />
“Slip of the tongue dear. Your father and I mentioned it while you were with Spencer and Frieda.” Melissa says apologetically. <br />
<br />
While William and Nate were doing their best not to overhear the conversation in the kitchen out of respect; the Twists however heard everything. While they only had the best intentions; they clearly crossed a line when broaching the sensitive subject. Frances was the first to speak up as both Martha and Eric returned from the kitchen<br />
“It think it is time for us to leave.” Frances continues, “I have a new patient I’m seeing tomorrow bright and early.” Why it was a lie, Frances knew Eric’s mood clearly soured upon the mention of Julie’s first attempt to turn Eric into a were-mer. Out of respect for her friendship with the Anderson; she knew that is one topic that will most likely stay within the family.<br />
“Are you sure you don’t want to stay for pie?” Martha answers; despite knowing full well why they were leaving.<br />
“No we really must be going,” Samantha chimes in. “It is getting late and we do have an early morning.”<br />
<br />
Both William and Martha understood and walked them to the front door.  Nate and Eric heard the Twist’s apologizing for souring diner with a touchy subject. With the Andersons accepting the apology; Samantha and Frances walk out the door.<br />
<br />
William and Martha walked back to the table to see Eric sullen. While they wanted to know what happened; the diner was mean to be a celebration. While dinner started out well enough, it clearly ended in disaster. William was the first to speak up.<br />
“Eric, I’m sorry. But do you want to talk about it?”<br />
“No,” Eric states.<br />
William knew better then to push the matter. “When you’re ready then,” he says softly.<br />
“You want some pie, Eric?” Martha speaks up.<br />
While key lime was Eric’s favorite; after what just happen, he didn’t feel like having a slice. Looking at the clock; it showed that it was approaching nine in the evening. “No thanks. I’d rather go to bed.” With that Eric gets up and heads to his room for the night.</p>
