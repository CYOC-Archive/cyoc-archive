<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once they were in Dustin's room Hanna rounded on Ty saying &quot;That was not a smart thing to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
Hanna sighed and said &quot;You were going to do something to Father Tobias. Don't deny it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would I be able to do anything to Father Tobias?&quot; Ty asked shrugging her shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are Amy's daughter&quot; Hanna said staring at Ty.<br />
<br />
Ty got a surprised look on her face and took a step back asking &quot;How do you know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Zeus told me&quot; Hanna said. &quot;You need to be careful Ty. The seal that was placed on you was broken prematurely. That means you do not have full control of your powers. The more you use them the more likely something major will go wrong. Also would you like to go through an exorcism?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's why I wanted to do something to Father Tobias&quot; Ty said. &quot;He could be a major problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you're stupid enough to do something to him&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Your powers don't affect the gods Ty and if you get out of control they will take action.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What action could they take?&quot; Ty asked. &quot;It's not like they can do anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Zeus was the one that changed me into a girl&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Before I was a guy. Though I'm thankful that he and the other gods finally decided to rectify that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why are you here?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy went to Zeus and asked him to send me to watch over you&quot; Hanna said. &quot;She knows what a prematurely broken seal can cause.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing has happened except my power backfiring on me a bit and me turning into a demon&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because you have not used your power that much yet&quot; Hanna said. &quot;If you continue to use them without a break or try to do too much at once your powers could go completely out of control. It could change the whole world in unpredictable ways. Maybe even kill everyone, including yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty turned a little pale at this and asked &quot;So how much is too much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not exactly sure&quot; Hanna said. &quot;I would think that anything on a world wide scale would be too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty thought about this for a moment and remembered that her demon form started manifesting after making everyone think something was normal. &quot;Why are you telling me this?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're careful with your power&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you've told me so you can leave now&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't understand&quot; Hanna said. &quot;I'm here to watch over you until your eighteenth birthday. There is another reason too and that's to see if I can find out who broke the seal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I'm stuck with you&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are&quot; Hanna said. &quot;I'll be sticking to you as much as I can. Hopefully I can help you to control your power better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty was silent for a moment and then said &quot;Well then I guess I'll just have to change you into something that won't be following me everywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your powers won't affect me&quot; Hanna said. &quot;You see Zeus had foreseen that you might try what you propose so he gave me protection against it.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a moment of silence June came in and said &quot;Ty, I have something I need to tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty sighed and asked in an exasperated voice &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm your mother&quot; June said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just my foster mother&quot; Ty responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't understand Ty&quot; June said. &quot;I gave birth to you. I am your mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't be my real mother&quot; Ty said. &quot;I've met my real mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That demoness Amy?&quot; June asked. At Ty's shocked look and wordless gasp she continued &quot;I know all about her and Loki.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Loki is involved with this too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Father Tobias told me that you knew about it&quot; June said with a quizzical look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;ZEUS!&quot; Hanna yelled looking up to the ceiling. &quot;WHEN WERE YOU GOING TO TELL ME LOKI WAS INVOLVED IN THIS?!&quot; When there was no answer Hanna threw up her hands and said &quot;This is just great. Not only are you the daughter of a demoness but also of the Norse god of mischief.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hanna, if you're done with your outburst I would like to continue&quot; June said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead&quot; Hanna said sitting down on the bed. &quot;I think I know who broke the seal now at least. It must have been Loki.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well regardless it's broken now&quot; June said. &quot;Do you want to know how I can be your real mother?&quot; When Ty nodded her head June continued &quot;I guess I should tell you that my name has not always been June. This does not leave this room. It was at one time Mary Sutton. I was a priestess for the Mau religion. We worshiped the demons of the underworld and at one point Amy and Loki kidnapped and raped me. After I had you Ty and I hid in a church. I met Father Tobias there and asked him to look after you for seven years and then to place you with me as my foster daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Dustin then?&quot; Ty asked finally finding the ability to speak again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your brother was born first to me and Mark&quot; June said. &quot;At the time Mark did not know that I was a priestess and it was only after your birth that I told him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand how you and Amy could be my mother and Loki my father&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The normal laws of procreation get tossed out the window when demons and gods are involved&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Just accept it for what it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hanna, would my power affect demons as well?&quot; Ty suddenly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would guess that would depend on the demon and where they're at at the time&quot; Hanna said. &quot;With Amy being the mother of all incubi and succubi I would say that there is a slim chance that it would affect her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why did she call me her daughter instead of her son?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you were a boy Ty?&quot; June asked.<br />
<br />
Ty nodded and Hanna said &quot;Maybe the seal changed you from a girl to a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But wouldn't I have changed into a girl immediately when the seal was broken?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;One would think so if that were the case&quot; Hanna said. &quot;When did you change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well after I found out I had this power I said I was a fifteen year old girl and that everyone would remember me that way last night&quot; Ty said. &quot;When I woke up this morning I was a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; June asked looking at Hanna.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure but it's interesting&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Oh and Ty, you may want to put clothes on. The longer you go around naked the more likely you will turn into your demon form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know this?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I'm a succubus too&quot; Hanna said. &quot;I'll show you.&quot; With that her clothes disappeared and bat like wings grew from her back and a long black tail with a spade tip grew from just above her ass. She smiled and said &quot;As succubi we do need to feed on energy Ty. What we feed on is sexual energy though we do not have have sex in order to do it. We can stimulate a person from a distance and feed on the resulting sexual energy. Where's the fun in that though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do not need to feed on sexual energy&quot; June said glaring at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we do&quot; Hanna said. &quot;While we may go for a long time without feeding we will feel the need to at some point. If we don't feed we will become more lethargic and it could get to the point that we could die. That is if we don't subconsciously feed of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the people you feed from?&quot; June asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh they'll just become a bit tired but they will bounce back quickly&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Unless we totally drain them which should not happen if we feed pretty regularly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I suppose that for the sake of everyone you should feed regularly&quot; June said. &quot;I have one condition though. Don't feed on any of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn't planing on feeding off of anyone in this house&quot; Hanna said. &quot;By the way, where are Mark and Dustin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Out getting a bed for you&quot; June said. &quot;Ty, will you be feeding off of any of us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty thought for a few seconds then said &quot;I don't think I'll need to. There are plenty of people at school who we can feed off of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then&quot; June said. &quot;Just don't drain them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We won't&quot; Ty and Hanna said at the same time with identical smiles on their faces.</p>
