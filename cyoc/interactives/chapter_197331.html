<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danielle lay exhausted, spread-eagled, on the bed.  They had been given a honeymoon suite by the manager of Kingsley House, and it came with a stupidly large bed.  The ceiling was covered in mirrored tiles, so she could see herself and Gemory laying naked in the reflection.  Which was good, because she was too tired to move.  Or was feeling too good to move, take your pick.<br />
<br />
Gemory, of course, had seemingly endless stamina, and was straddling her lover&#39;s waist, sucking on her right breast, while teasing the left with one hand.  Thinking about breasts, Danielle remembered something.<br />
<br />
“Hey Gem...?”<br />
<br />
Gemory lifted her head up to look at her beloved fiancee.  “I must be losing my touch.  You should be incapable of rational thought, my love.”<br />
<br />
Dani smiled lovingly at the demoness.  “I definitely was for awhile there.”<br />
<br />
“I guess I should have warned you- a little pain makes me go wild.” Gemory grinned.<br />
<br />
“All that because I spanked you?”  Danielle&#39;s eyes widened.<br />
<br />
“Yep!  Now imagine what happens if you bite me.”  The demoness pinched both of Danielle&#39;s nipples, eliciting a gasp from the other girl.<br />
<br />
“...I think I&#39;m at my limit, Gem.  If we keep doing this, I think you might kill me.”  Dani said, weakly.<br />
<br />
“Aw, did I break you?  And here I thought you had great stamina for a mortal.”  Gemory lay on her lover&#39;s body, her head resting on Danielle&#39;s breasts.<br />
<br />
“Here, let me make you more comfortable.”  Danielle whispered something that even Gemory&#39;s ears couldn&#39;t quite make out...and then, to her surprise, Danielle&#39;s breasts became larger and plumper, two perfect and soft pillows for the demon&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that&#39;s nice...”  Gemory stopped short.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.  Forgot I could do that.  Wish you would have reminded me earlier, after what I did to Toni.”  Dani couldn&#39;t manage to sound stern, but she was a little annoyed.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry, my love.  But a punishment is a punishment, you can go easy on someone, but you can&#39;t just rescind it.  Are you going to be ok with these heavy things?”<br />
<br />
“Eh.  Since we know I can make them smaller, it&#39;s not really a big deal.  They are a bit heavy though, you&#39;re right.”  Danielle had mixed feelings about her new breasts.  They were a bit uncomfortable, but they also felt more sensitive, and it felt good to have Gemory laying her head atop them, her golden hair tickling her a little.<br />
<br />
“Honestly, I was surprised you could shrink a specific part of someone&#39;s anatomy.  Just because I granted Toni&#39;s original wish, didn&#39;t mean I took the time to work out the nuances.  Generally I have legal figure that out.  I mean, I don&#39;t mind loopholes, I think they&#39;re fun, but I generally hate surprises.”<br />
<br />
“Does that mean you hate me?”  Dani asked.<br />
<br />
“No.  Never.  You&#39;re an exception- the most wonderful surprise I&#39;ve ever had.”<br />
<br />
Danielle found the strength to put her arms around Gemory.  “I love you.”<br />
<br />
Gemory felt the stinging, acrid burn of tears, but didn&#39;t care.  “Do you?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.  I didn&#39;t think so before, because this is all happening so fast.  But I do.  A part of me feels like you&#39;ve been missing from my life forever.  Like this is, I don&#39;t know, meant to be.  That&#39;s silly, right?”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s hard to say.  Not many people could set something like this up.  And if we&#39;ve met before, in another one of your lives, you&#39;d think I&#39;d remember.  But..I agree.  This feels so -right-.”  She snuggled a bit in her lover&#39;s arms, shrinking her body a little as she did so.  There, that felt good.<br />
<br />
“Hey, you shrank again.  Trying to get down to Toni&#39;s size?”  Dani smiled.<br />
<br />
“You like short girls, don&#39;t you?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m starting to.”  Dani really wanted to kiss Gemory right now, but she didn&#39;t want to end this moment.  It felt like their relationship was actually clicking.  “So.  Since I can&#39;t move, and I don&#39;t want you to, do you mind more questions?”<br />
<br />
“I never mind your questions, my love.  I enjoy teaching you.  So many things.”  Gemory grinned.<br />
<br />
“Ok, well, let&#39;s start with punishments.  Why are they so important?”<br />
<br />
“Ok, well, as you&#39;ve no doubt noticed, demons don&#39;t really have inhibitions.  Some who used to be mortal, like Toni, may retain some, but I mean, all demons ended up in Hell for one reason or another.  So we needed a way to enforce discipline.<br />
<br />
Originally, we ruled Hell through fear, and some of the Hierarchy still do, but a few of us got tired of it. What we eventually realized is a punishment, any punishment, is a sufficient threat.  It didn&#39;t even have to be unpleasant- but it had to be limiting in some way.”<br />
<br />
“So like, I could punish you with something you&#39;d enjoy, like, say, having to walk around naked all the time, but it would work because you&#39;re being forced to do it?”  Dani was starting to see the logic.<br />
<br />
“Oh, could you?  I enjoy it when you look at my body.”<br />
<br />
“It might be a bit of a problem here on Earth.  So what do you do when you...go too far with a punishment?”<br />
<br />
“You mean like with your Mother?  Well you can rescind it, but only after they show improvement.  It doesn&#39;t even have to be a big deal.  I&#39;ve found the best times are when the recipient doesn&#39;t expect it.  They seem to be more grateful.”  Gemory explained.<br />
<br />
“Huh.  So what if someone -likes- their punishment?”<br />
<br />
“Then that becomes something else you can take away.” Gemory sighed, feeling very content in her lover&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
“Still, you should have reminded me.  I felt terrible when I realized Toni actually liked having giant boobs!”  Dani frowned.  “I think I should punish you for that.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, now you&#39;re learning!  What will it be?”  The demon felt a shiver of anticipation.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;ll find out.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Toni was, curiously enough, similary exhausted.  And wearing out a Succubus was no easy feat- but Amielle apparently enjoyed challenges.  The Angel had been happy to show off her ability to shrink in size, and she was currently curled up comfortably -inside- Toni&#39;s pussy, her tiny wings tickling the Succubus whenever she moved.<br />
<br />
Toni had been licked, fucked, and probed in all manner of ways, but somehow, she liked this one the best of all.  It wasn&#39;t the physical sensation- being fucked by a ooze or slime was more intense, but there was a much stronger emotional component, to the point, that Toni had been able to feed off her -own- emotions for the first time!<br />
<br />
And it felt beyond amazing.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Ami crawled out of Toni&#39;s body, completely soaked in the demon&#39;s juices, her hair and wings damp and bedraggled looking.  She looked a bit tired herself, but she was smiling as she clambered up and crawled along Toni&#39;s body.  She was able to make herself a little larger, but she lacked the strength to do more than that.  She sat between her lover&#39;s breasts.<br />
<br />
She had liked Toni&#39;s larger chest, but this new, smaller and perkier one was nice too.  And apparently more sensitive, as she&#39;d found out when she&#39;d started sucking on the succubus.<br />
<br />
“I want to hold you, but I can&#39;t move.”  Toni whined.<br />
<br />
“Aw, it&#39;s ok, honey.  I&#39;m happy you enjoyed that.”<br />
<br />
“You...you have no idea how much.”  Toni shivered, still feeding on her own afterglow.<br />
<br />
“Are you...feeding?” Ami blinked.  “I thought you couldn&#39;t feed from me.”<br />
<br />
“I can&#39;t...but...you made me feel so good...”<br />
<br />
The Angel got it.  “Oh!  That&#39;s a thing?  So if we do this every night, you&#39;ll never have to feed again?”<br />
<br />
“I...I don&#39;t know.  I have to ask Gemory.”<br />
<br />
“Well I hope so.  When you drained that guy at the hotel...I don&#39;t know, it didn&#39;t really hurt him, but I didn&#39;t like it.”  The Angel leaned against her lover&#39;s left breast.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“Oh love, don&#39;t apologize.  It&#39;s a part of who you are.  You can&#39;t help it.  It just means we have to find ways to keep you happy and well fed.  I wish I could share how you make me feel though.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d like that.  The ability to connect with someone else&#39;s emotions during sex is the best part about being a Succubus.  I&#39;d love to be able to feel yours.”<br />
<br />
“Me too.”  Ami sighed.  “I need to make a report to the head office.  I&#39;ve been debating just telling the truth.”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;ll be punished!  They&#39;ll take your wings!”  Toni gasped.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.  Yeah they probably will.”  The Angel sounded dejected.  “But if that&#39;s what it takes for us to be together, then that&#39;s what I have to do.  I can skirt around the truth, but I can&#39;t really lie.  And I don&#39;t want to!  I want to stand on the summit of K3 and scream to the whole world that I&#39;m in love with you!”<br />
<br />
Toni found the strength to reach for her lover, picking her up gently, and brought her close, so she could plant a kiss on her nude body.  Then another kiss, and another.<br />
<br />
Soon she was licking Ami clean, despite the Angel&#39;s protests that she was ticklish.  Ami tried to push the tongue away and kick at it, but there was no strength in her blows.  Only love.</p>
