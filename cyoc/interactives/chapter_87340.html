<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After they left the mall and David, stopped at a park and had Jackes crawl around for the amusement of the bystanders. Jackes found himself over the laps of children who delighted in spanking him watching the burly man&#39;s hairy cheeks jiggle. David clapped and encouraged the children all the more.<br />
<br />
David loved watching the grown man almost start crying when he had him raise his leg up at a tree and ordered him to piss like a dog. Jackes tried to explain to David that this humiliation was not helping anyone and he should put an end to it but David was enjoying himself way too much. That is until the police cars pulled up.<br />
<br />
The police immediately cuffed David much to his protests. His Dad watched in shock as David was being dragged to a van. He asked &quot;what the hell was going on!&quot;<br />
One cop responded with a slap to David&#39;s face and told him that since his guardian was no longer human, it turns out, that David automatically lost his human rights too. The crowd in the park were flabbergasted and many took out their phones to record the 2 men being thrown into the back of a police van. Word quickly spread of Davids arrest.<br />
<br />
Back at the processing centre the 2 men were led before the panel again. This time David found himself on the same side of the yellow line on the floor as his naked father. It felt very different to be standing on this side! He looked around horrified. His father also was surprised at these turn of events but he wasn&#39;t happy about it.<br />
<br />
David was ordered to strip. &quot;no way!&quot; he protested, &quot;This must be some kind of mistake!&quot;<br />
He was answered by the shock of a electric cattle prod. When the guard held up the prod to do it again, David started quickly stripping.  He looked around furtively at the growing crowd of people who came to watch. He saw Judy the girl he like in the crowd. She was showing great interest in watching the toned muscled teenaged body come into view. He hesitated when he got down to his underwear, looking around with shame at the crowd and then pulled them off despairingly.<br />
<br />
He had a mostly smooth body but quite a thick pubic bush around his longish dick. He suddenly wished he had done some trimming there.<br />
A young trainer came in to teach David his new status. It was David&#39;s friend from school. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, don&#39;t do this to me please&quot; he begged his friend but his friend smiled cheerfully and said &quot;sorry dude, just doing my job&quot;&#8232;&#8232;David was inspected head to toe by his former classmate. The trainer ran his fingers through Davids unruly teenaged hair then with David standing with his hands on his head, the trainer checked out David&#39;s hairy pits. You need to use more deodorant his former friend laughed out loud. The room laughed as David blushed with shame when the young trainer reached down to the naked man&#39;s swinging genitals and rolled around his big balls and played with David&#39;s dick which quickly became erect. He looked around blushing at the crowd staring at his pulsating dripping boner.<br />
<br />
David noted that many of the people watching his humiliation were from the park and mall and just a few hours ago they were watching David being the cocky powerful one humiliating his father. Some were smiling and some shaking their heads scornfully. David felt like a bad little boy getting punished for his misbehaviour.<br />
<br />
The previously proud teen was then ordered to turn around and bend over and pull his smooth ass cheeks apart. More people came to watch as word spread about this hot teen being caught in his own trick. Soon the room was quite crowded. David&#39;s classmate commented on how David had a quite a hairy asshole in contrast to his smooth buttocks. David looked at his smiling x-friend from underneath his spread legs and wondered why his friend had such interest in his anus. David grunted and squirmed as his friend pushed a finger into David&#39;s tight ass. His hard cock dripped some precum when his x-budy massaged his prostate. A few people commented on this.<br />
<br />
Someone then asked to compare the two new &quot;pets&quot; so Jackes had to bend over beside his bent over son and also pull his but cheeks apart. People commented on the difference in asses of the father and son and their genitals were compared as well. A spread beefy hairy butt juxtaposed to a spread young smooth bubble butt. Both with pendulous low hangers and a long dicks; David&#39;s totally hard and his fathers limp and flopping about. What a sight the pair made; two men in a crowded room stark fucking bullocks naked spreading their asses for the amusement of there former friends and neighbours. <br />
<br />
While bent over like that Jackes turned and stared daggers at his remorseful son. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; David whispered to his Dad, tears filling his eyes.<br />
<br />
&#8232;Both men were then forced to do exercises. They were made to do jumping jacks, squats, crunches. Genitals flapping about, asses opening. Soon they were both blushing sweaty messes and there wasn&#39;t one inch of their bodies that the crowd was not well acquainted with.</p>
