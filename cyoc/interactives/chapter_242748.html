<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I don&#39;t know if I should do this... but it&#39;s either that or another night on the floor, and right now, I really need some good sleep. Everyone assured that their beds were completely safe, so mine shouldn&#39;t be any different... right? I decided to try to not overthink it, and slowly approached the bed, avoiding all unecessary contact with other objects. Placing my hands on the soft fabric, I felt a little of the blankets before pulling them out slightly, and slid below them. This feels so good... so comfy... a little like home... I miss home.........home..........<br />

<br />
The world around me is all a shade of green neon green and pink, kind of like a computer screen glitch. Everything is eratic, moving in strange ways, forming into different shapes and distorting. Everything but a single black dot in the distance. I walk, in the only direction that seems right. The shapes around me are all pulsating weirdly, as if telling me to not go that way, to not go see what&#39;s this thing in the distance, a warning of sorts. But I ignore them, I ignore them all as I pick up the pace. The dot is more elongated now, and bigger as well since I start distinguishing it more precisely. The forms bounce all around, now coloured of a deep crimson and a dark shade of blue. I shouldn&#39;t go that way. It&#39;s the wrong way, the dangerous way. But I&#39;m still going. The thing in the distance continue to grow in my vision, taking somethin close of a humanoid form. I&#39;m so close. I feel the shapes pressuring the air around me, it&#39;s becoming harder to walk. But I&#39;m still going. I hold out my hand, trying to touch the form, to see it through the barrage of  buzzling matter trying to prevent me from doing it. Wind push me the other side. I can&#39;t breathe, I can&#39;t see, I can&#39;t hear... and suddenly, my hand is taken, and I&#39;m pulled out of the chaos. Everything around me is now pure black. The one holding my hand is a girl. Long brown hair, floral dress, and cute all around.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s me.<br />
<br />
_______________________<br />
<br />
I wake up in sweats. What was that? I&#39;ve never had a dream of the sort... I don&#39;t understand it... As I try to stand up from the bed, my legs threaten to buckle under me. My head is spinning as I try to compose myself. I close my eyes and try to calm down... Deep breath...<br />
<br />
Myself: *Deep breath*...<br />
<br />
Abigail: Hey! Are you okay in there? It&#39;s almost noon and we haven&#39;t heard anything out of you! Farim started to get worried about you!<br />
<br />
Farim: I think you&#39;re reversing the roles here... I tried to calm you down as you wondered if your &quot;Little Vivian&quot; was okay.<br />
<br />
Abigail: Shut up.<br />
<br />
Hearing their voice is so refreshing. These people that I can trust... that cares about me... <br />
<br />
Myself: Y-Yeah *cough*... Yeah I&#39;m good! S-Sorry for worrying you...<br />
<br />
Abigail: You sure you&#39;re okay?  Your voice sound raspy...<br />
<br />
Myself: Yeah... Yeah don&#39;t worry... I&#39;m like that when I wake up...<br />
<br />
While it is true that good mornings were never my kind of things, I&#39;ve rarely felt this bad after a night... I hope I didn&#39;t contract any virus or something...<br />
<br />
Farim: Anyway the others gathered in the kitchen, they kinda made it their headquarters... We managed to sneak out some food though! Don&#39;t worry, it was a single big bowl of noodles, so we already tested it... It&#39;s not dangerous!<br />
<br />
Abigail: More like tasted it...<br />
<br />
I manage to get up from my bed, still wobbling slightly as open the entrance, seeing the two girls in front of me, a bowl in hand.<br />
<br />
Abigail: Wow! Are you sure you&#39;re okay? You look pale...<br />
<br />
Myself: I&#39;m fine... Do you want to enter?<br />
<br />
Farim: Wow... that&#39;s your room? It&#39;s all small and cuddly...<br />
<br />
Abigail: Kind of like you itty bitty!<br />
<br />
She ruffle my already messy hair saying that, her feline ears twitching in the process. I let them enter, and we sit in the cushionless corner. I start eating the noddle bowl while they talk a bit. Eating certainly did me good, as my headache faded away after a few bites. Maybe it was just because of my lack of nutrition from yesterday? Anyhow, the duo seemed to be very lively together, teasing and joking playfully with each other. They seem so close, even though we all met each other only a few hours back...<br />
<br />
Farim: Hey Abby! Theres something I&#39;ve meant to ask you for a while now...<br />
<br />
Abigail: What is it?<br />
<br />
Farim: When Tristan told us everything we &quot;did wrong&quot; to him, he talked about going to your tours and concert? What&#39;s that about?<br />
<br />
Abigail: Oh... well I guess I can tell you since we&#39;re stuck here. You see, as of recently, I was the lead singer of the pop group &quot;Daylight&quot;...<br />
<br />
Myself: You&#39;re Dawn!?<br />
<br />
They look at me curiously as I almost blurted out the words. I&#39;ve followed this group through their whole career, their music always inspired me to continue my work... The lead singer is Dawn, always wearing a deep purple outfit with a pink and orange gradient from top to bottom. Her intense voice makes the crowd tremble under her words... There is also the main guitarist, Day, who is wearing a cloudy light blue dress herself. She sometimes accompany Dawn in singing, but only in calmer songs, as her voice is so soft an peaceful... The pianist, Dusk, Is an energetic pile of enthusiasm. She is the eye grabber of the group, making the guys stirr to see her. And finally, the quiet Night... The drummer of the group... So mysterious, yet comforting...<br />
<br />
Am I kind of leeching over the groups members? I absolutely are. Their music leaded me through so much, I might be their biggest fan. Except Tristan I guess...<br />
<br />
Myself: S-sorry... I-I&#39;m kind of y-your biggest fan... I d-don&#39;t know w-what to s-say... I d-didn&#39;t recognize y-you at first... <br />
<br />
Abigail: Haha! Don&#39;t be like that Vivi! Don&#39;t see me differently because of that! It&#39;s still me! And plus... this is a thing of the past...<br />
<br />
Farim: What do you mean?<br />
<br />
Abigail: I recently decided to retire from the group... I... I had an argument with the others... And I decided to part away... I was about to leave after the release of our next album, but I guess fate decided to speed things up...<br />
<br />
Even though the new struck at me, I feel more simpathizing for my idol. I mean, for Abigail. I hope the problem she had with the group wasn&#39;t too bad...<br />
<br />
Farim: You sure you don&#39;t wanna go back? That tail would surely bring some new fans...<br />
<br />
Abigail: Oh shut up you little...<br />
<br />
Abigail pushed gently Farim. They were really getting to know each other better. I hope we get out of here soon... Every single one of us as  friends out here that might be worried of our absence...<br />
<br />
Abigail: And you Farim? Apparently your a robber?<br />
<br />
Farim: Yop! And cannot be more proud of it!<br />
<br />
Myself: For real? You didnt&#39; feel remorse for stealing?<br />
<br />
Farim: Well... at some points I wondered... but I just thought that I needed the moeny more that them. I guess I was wrong with Tristan though...<br />
<br />
Abigail: That dipshit deserved to get his ass robbed if he was so close to kidnapping people for revenge. For real, what is wrong with him?<br />
<br />
Farim: Probably a bunch of things.<br />
<br />
Abigail: I mean, he probably was not alway like that, check out his tastes in girls!<br />
<br />
This took me a while to comprehend that what she just said was a very indirect compliment. My face turned red again.<br />
<br />
Myself: I-I-I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re t-talking about!<br />
<br />
Abigail: Hahaha!<br />
<br />
We spent a lot of time like that together. I realize how boring it would be if there was no one to talk to... The place would get stale pretty fast... As we discussed, a knock on the door took my attention away from the conversation.</p>
