<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Had I known then what I know now, that my penis and testicles, my symbol of masculinity, would be the last to vanish as I became a three year old girl, I would've stopped checking that both were still present weeks ago. Had I known it, that there was no way for me to stop it, that I was to become a three year old girl, Katherine's younger sister and one day a beautiful woman, with B sized breasts, a S/M frame and height of five foot seven and a weight of one hundred and thirteen, I would have stopped worrying about the transformation. Had I known that because of the way I transformed, it prevented me from ever using the amulet again, I would have stopped looking for it.<br />
<br />
It's now two weeks after school had let out for the summer and I had been undergoing a strange transformation for the past month and a half, almost two now. Mommy called me Ashley and so did practically everyone else. No one said a word if they called me Marcus and pointed out that I resemble an eight year old girl.<br />
<br />
Currently I'm running naked through a girl's locker room, several people commenting on what a pretty girl I am, wanting to stop and point out the penis and testicles that dangle between my legs, but I don't. Now it's not so much mind slips, it's the fact that I can feel the inside of my body changing; something that I think might have to do with me growing a girl's reproductive system; weird, huh?<br />
<br />
But all this doesn't bother me, because the same changes that are affecting my body, are also at work in my mind, with my chemistry and at a genetic level. But I don't know this and won't know this until I'm older. Nor do I know that by September of this year, I'll be Katherine's little sister as the transformation will have finished about than.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley, that's no way for a young lady to act,&quot; Mommy called out, stopping me in my tracks. As Katherine came up behind me laughing, also naked, Mommy started scolding her too and then said, &quot;Girls, put on you bathing suits.&quot;<br />
<br />
Twisting about, seeing my mommy's naked body in front of me as she puts on her swimsuit, something inside of me saying, 'I want to look like that when I grow up', I tell her in an earnest tone, &quot;I forgot my suit at home. I thought it was rolled up in with my towel, but when I got here, I found it wasn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mommy sighed heavily and replied, &quot;Honestly Ashley, you'd forget your head if it wasn't attached,&quot; and fished inside the bag she had brought with her and pulled out one of my sister's old bikinis.<br />
<br />
After swimming, mommy bought us ice cream and we started walking home. It was apparent that I should be bothered by this whole situation and on some level I was, but at the same time I wasn't. I knew that I was losing myself, but at the same time I didn't really care. Currently I was wearing a pair of tight, cotton shorts, with no zipper or buttons on the front, no underwear and a white t-shirt with Angelina Ballerina on the front, which I was dripping ice cream down the front.<br />
<br />
Home I was told by mommy, &quot;Go wash your hands and change your shirt,&quot; and she disappeared into her room.<br />
<br />
Washing my hands was difficult now, mostly because I had to stand on a stool in order to reach the sink and knobs. After I'd finished that, I went into my room, which was now one hundred percent a girl's room, and stripped off my shirt. As I was putting on a new one, I heard from my doorway, &quot;Marcus, would you like to play dollies  with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
As I said, some people still call me Marcus, but treat me like a girl, weird huh?<br />
<br />
Nodding, I say to her, &quot;Lets play outside,&quot; as I collect Angelina and a couple of my dollies. Outside, Katherine and I set up a blanket on the front lawn and begin to immerse ourselves in our little game. We don't get far when a strange boy shows up.<br />
<br />
Looking at me, he says, &quot;You Marcus?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking my head furiously, something inside me screaming about strangers, I said in a defiant tone, &quot;No! My name is Ashley.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at me strangely, he shakes his head and says, &quot;Whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he is about to leave, he turns back and says in an urgent tone, &quot;Listen, I don't care what your name is. My name is Mario and my cousin is Thomas. We're both in trouble and he said that you warned him, but he didn't listen. And now we started to have these odd feelings we sometimes can't control.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was about than that I noticed that my sister had run back into the house and just as I was about to ask what this was about, I heard the front door open and mommy was saying, &quot;Get away from her, you pervert.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before I can stop her, she is picking me up and carrying me into the house. From behind us, I can hear Mario saying, &quot;Honestly Miss. Ericson, I meant no harm. I only wanted to ask if I could play....dollies.&quot; It was that last bit that caught my attention and as I looked past mommy, I saw that the boy had a strange dream like look on his face, but he fought it off.<br />
<br />
As we entered the house, I completely missed what mommy was saying and it was only once she had sat me down on the couch that she repeated what she was saying before; a bit about how dangerous it was to talk to strangers.<br />
<br />
I had no time to think on what I'd just been told as mommy saw fit to try and keep me busy for the rest of the day. After dinner, she called Samantha to baby-sit us and kissing me and my sister good-bye, she said, &quot;Be good for her,&quot; and left for an evening shift at the hospital.<br />
<br />
Thinking that I'd get some time alone, I was quickly disillusioned of such notion as Samantha insisted on keeping a close eye on us and at nine thirty, she announced, &quot;Bath time,&quot; and I was placed in the bathtub with Katherine.<br />
<br />
After I'd been washed, had a fresh pull-up put on, a pair of my favourite Hello Kitty pajamas pulled on over that, I lay in the dark, snuggling close to Angelina, wondering what sort of trouble Thomas had gotten into. Obvious it was the amulet, &quot;But what was I supposed to do about it?&quot; I asked myself. Having no answer, I drifted off to sleep.</p>
