<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ten people were in the living room as the meeting was happening. Half were merely curious what was going on while the other half was wearing borrowed clothes and wondering what had happened to them... or you could be Jeff as their mom said &quot;Apologies but... I may have played with a reality altering software while unware that it altered reality. As such I&#39;ve called this meeting to ask how you all are feeling about this and if you&#39;d like to change back?&quot;<br />
Kara raised his hand as he asked &quot;Why would that even be a question? And yes I&#39;d like to go back to having a heterosexual relationship with my boyfriend.&quot; Her deadpan delivery betrayed that Kara very much wanted to mess around as different sexes with Greg who wasn&#39;t comfortable with at least this type of homosexual relationship. <br />
Judy explained &quot;Well... It&#39;s a big change, but I thought. Perhaps you all may prefer being the opposite sex for one reason or another or may want to try it for a bit.&quot;<br />
Kaylee asked &quot;Why don&#39;t you ask if we wanted to be boys?&quot;<br />
Judy responded &quot;I&#39;d rather have your parent&#39;s permission first befo-&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Kara interjected &quot;Greg&#39;s practically and adult, he can make his own decisions.&quot; Mother and once daughter locked eyes for a moment an understanding was had as Kara was the dominant one in this relationship and probably wanted to mess with a female Greg and he wasn&#39;t that into it and left it like that. <br />
&quot;Ahem, like I said I&#39;d prefer to have your parent&#39;s permission before messing with your body. Now Jenny how do you feel?&quot;<br />
Jenny was blushing a bit as he said &quot;Umm... I&#39;ve felt kinda weird... Not bad but...&quot;<br />
Ashlynn got a bit closer and asked &quot;Are you feeling alright?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, is there something we could do to help you out? Kaylee said <br />
Judy chuckled a little and said &quot;Give the boy a little space. Jenny is still Jenny on the inside but he IS a boy.&quot; <br />
Jenny said &quot;It&#39;s not a bad, but it&#39;s... a weird feeling... I think I&#39;d like to give this a try for a day or two at least...&quot; He felt timid, but his changing feelings about his friends wasn&#39;t bad.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how about you Peter?&quot; Judy asked shifting to her youngest... daughter now. Peter was wearing one of Kara&#39;s shirts, and a training bra that she found in the back of her dresser along with her tidy whities and one of her looser shorts which felt off on her hips. <br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s the puberty talking but I feel... Good, but...&quot; Peter felt bigger, stronger, but also the stares from her friends...<br />
Kara said &quot;Don&#39;t feel awkward, embrace the popularity sister!&quot; Meanwhile Peter&#39;s friends were silently judging their now suddenly much hotter friend... especially since they had that girl&#39;s boobs fried into their pre-pubescent minds and they couldn&#39;t help but undress her at least a little. Peter knew that Kara would be her older sister soon and... <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try for now... I&#39;ll see how I feel later.&quot; Peter said unsure of the attention she was getting from her friends. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now I suppose you are left Jeff. Would you like to stay a girl?&quot; her mother asked <br />
&quot;What type of question is that? I didn&#39;t want to or was planning on being a girl. Obviously I want my...&quot; Jeff was about to self censor thanks to some little kids being around, but her mother picked up on the second of self-censorship<br />
&quot;Your beautiful Jeff.&quot; Judy said and Jeff blushed a bit &quot;You&#39;ve always been doing stuff by yourself, and I want your happiness. I think you may be happier as the young woman you are now.&quot; <br />
Kara pipped in &quot;OOO!!! How about we have a girl&#39;s sleepover tonight!&quot;<br />
Kaylee and Ashlynn asked &quot;Can we join!?!?!&quot;<br />
Judy responded &quot;We&#39;ll have to ask your parents first&quot; but sounded delighted. <br />
Jenny asked &quot;...could I join... even if I&#39;m not a girl anymore?&quot; the young boy felt a lot less sure of himself, but knew in some sense he was a girl at heart. Perhaps he could be temporarily made into a girl again.<br />
Kaylee and Ashlynn hugged the new boy and said &quot;Of course, we&#39;re BFF&#39;s forever!!!&quot; as Jenny&#39;s little boy instincts were making him feel odd about this. <br />
<br />
<br />
Greg was nice and was going to bring Leo and Ricky back in the car. The two little kids were trying to describe something in the backseat that Greg heard and said &quot;Boys... Make piece with one of you getting Patricia or whatever or admit neither of you are getting her... if she decides to stay as a her. Trying for polygamy is a mistake.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wha, no we were just...&quot; the two were saying in unison<br />
Greg sighed &quot;Two guys trying to Fuck the same girl is a recipe for disaster that&#39;ll split the two of you apart. Possibly the three of you.&quot;<br />
The summer child Ricky asked &quot;What&#39;s F-&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s what the two of you are heading towards doing with Patricia, and the three of you will decide who does it or none of you are if you cherish your friendship.&quot; Greg said with his hands gripping the wheel hard. The words gave the two kids something to think of.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to go an-&quot;<br />
&quot;Just point and shoot&quot; Kara said after having point and shot himself to his little brother. The two once sisters now brothers had the equipment to pee standing up, but Jenny was more hesitant to &quot;pull out her gun&quot; he eventually did and well it felt good being able to &quot;unload&quot; without needing to take care of her barrel anyways. <br />
&quot;How&#39;d you know how t-&quot;<br />
&quot;Boyfriend and I talk about a few different things. Came up once and you don&#39;t forget about that too quickly.&quot; Kara said before two B-cup breasts surged from his chest. Kara cupped her returning boobs as her hips widened and her feminizing voice said &quot;Looks like that Chronivac or something is running.&quot; Peter herself was looking at the pajama stuff that Kara had available to her and then she felt her identity changing as Peter turned to Patricia... it felt more odd than her friends staring at her breasts... Then Jenny was having a similar identity change. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok... So now Jeff and I have switched names&quot; The new Jenny said as the more tech savvy female in the room was wielding the chronivac. &quot;I&#39;m leaving Dad completely unaware for the time being... and now time to alter reality a bit...&quot; Judy gripped Jenny&#39;s shoulder as reality shifted but relatively minorly. Jenny&#39;s clothes shifted to something she&#39;d actually get herself, Patricia had something that fit her properly... and also some third-hand hand-me-downs from Kara and Jenny, and the new Jeff had on some kids boy clothes that fit his body. Judy then noticed Jenny had went to her profile. <br />
&quot;Umm, what are you&quot; then she saw Jenny change her age from 45 to conception with reality alteration and awareness off for everyone. The girl saw her regressing mother shrink rapidly as she said &quot;We&#39;re going to have some fun tonight, don&#39;t worry you&#39;ll be fine and in my womb. You won&#39;t even remember that you&#39;ll technically be my daughter.&quot; Then saw a little baby vanished as her torso swelled with a baby, and her breasts swell with milk till the pregnancy reversed. Jenny massaged her breasts as she noticed the lactation side effect turn off, and noted how big they were before pregnancy. &quot;Well gotta hand it to you mom... Maybe I did turn out with a lovely body.&quot; Dad was around, but he wasn&#39;t going to interfere much with the girl&#39;s + 1 boy&#39;s slumber party... now with a chronivac in tow.</p>
