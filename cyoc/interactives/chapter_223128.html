<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We...have nothing to offer in exchange for shelter--&quot;  I looked away and started haltingly, still off-kilter from the sudden overthrow of my common assumptions.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is my own fault that your home was destroyed,&quot;  Avar interrupted, and although his tone was as even as ever, after spending so much time together, I could tell he was slightly irritated that I had treated him with such detachment.  The realization shook me from my mental fog.  &quot;I would like to remedy my shortcomings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...it is not your fault...you were attacked more than we were, but you shielded us,&quot;  I looked down at Rehid, who was still clutching me, but his breathing had evened out.  &quot;Will we be safe with you?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Avar seemed to understand the tenor of my question.  I was not doubting his willingness to look after us, or his determination to assure our safety.  However, I had a responsibility to Rehid.  If we were attacked again under Avar&#39;s protection, Avar would be held back by having to protect us, and should he fall, Rehid and I would have no chance of survival.  If that were the case, it would be better to go our separate ways as soon as possible, for both our sakes.<br />
<br />
&quot;The estate is well-protected by my subordinates, and its nature has not yet been discovered by those who bear us enmity,&quot;  Avar replied openly.  &quot;I can assure your safety there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rehid lifted his small face to look at me, then gave a slight nod.  I faintly smiled, then turned to Avar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we will entrust ourselves to your care,&quot;  I said firmly.  His face was as unemotional as ever, but I seemed to see a smile reach his eyes.  At that moment, Rehid shivered in my arms.  Seeing it, Avar strode over and placed a black cloak around us, although not the ragged one he was still wearing.  As I gave him a questioning glance, Avar volunteered an explanation.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is made from my aura.  Most demons create their garments from their aura, except when trying to remain undetected;  to do otherwise would result in some awkward situations should one shift form,&quot;  Avar stated, indicating his ripped cloak and shirt.  &quot;We are far enough that use of my aura should not draw unwanted attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot;  I responded, a bit surprised at my ability to accept the sudden change in my worldview.  Although it was a bit embarrassing to consider that Rehid and I were now wrapped in something that could be considered a piece of Avar.  &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Having made our decision, we all re-mounted Avar&#39;s flying horse-like steed and continued our journey to his estate.<br />
<br />
**********<br />
<br />
When we caught a glimpse of a building surrounded by a wall in the distance, Avar brought his mount to the ground.  There, with us still astride, to my wonderment it shifted form back into the large, powerful horse I had ridden the first day I met Avar.  Avar had long since retracted all traces of his demonic appearance, and now seemed nothing more than a strong yet injured human.  In addition, when we landed, he dispelled the cloak which had kept us warm during the flight.<br />
<br />
It was clear these measures were to ensure no suspicion would be directed to the place we were headed, but as we approached the rather large manse, it still astounded me how...<i>normal</i> it looked.  Nearing the gate, a group of three dogs whined happily from inside the wall, and and old gatekeeper stepped forward with a lantern to open the entryway upon seeing the familiar steed.  As we rode past, the flame of his lantern seemed to flicker a greenish color, and for a moment, his wizened face took on an almost skeletal look.  I blinked, but saw nothing amiss.  It was only when the gate closed behind us and we dismounted did I begin to see the true nature of the estate.  <br />
<br />
The three dogs came running up to us happily, obviously recognizing Avar as their master.  However, noticing my curious gaze, Avar seemed to make a decision and nodded.  At that moment, as though an optical illusion had been dispelled, there were no longer three dogs, but one dog body sporting three heads, all just as cheerful as before.  I immediately understood that what I had glimpsed before was no illusion, but likely the truth about the residents of the manor.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, Rehid did not appear scared at all, but rather curious.  Under Avar&#39;s watchful gaze, Rehid reached out a tentative hand, scratching one of the dog heads behind the ears.  He could not help but let out a soft giggle as the other two heads, jealous for attention, tried to each shove themselves under his hand.  After Avar sent away his horse, he turned to us.<br />
<br />
&quot;I apologize for my presumptuousness,&quot;  he said matter-of-factly, and before I could work out what he was referring to, he had lifted both Rehid and I, one with each arm, as though I too were a child, and started walking toward the manor.  As Rehid and I both steadied ourselves with our hands on his shoulders, and while Rehid was nonplussed, I struggled to keep my face from burning with embarrassment.  It was obvious that Avar was doing so because, having no shoes, the sharp gravel of the path might harm our feet, but to be carried thus by a man at my age in front of strangers was flustering, to say the least, even if he was a demon.<br />
<br />
Letting us down upon the outer porch, we were about to receive our first introduction to the estate of the demons.</p>
