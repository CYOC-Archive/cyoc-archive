<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...head out to the pool deck.<br />
<br />
Holland was eager to find someone to fool around with, that much was obvious, and even though Andy remembered he had a girlfriend back home, she really wasn&#39;t much of a girlfriend, so he decided to go along with Holland. The guys promptly started to take out their swimsuits, Andy&#39;s was a more modest long set of swim trunks, whereas Holland&#39;s was, fittingly for his personality, a tight, flattering bright blue speedo. Not even thinking twice about it Holland stripped down to put on his swimsuit, and the more reserved Andy followed suit.<br />
<br />
Andy was rather surprised when he heard Holland whistle and then felt him lightly jab Andy&#39;s shoulder, &quot;You&#39;re more ripped than you give yourself credit for being, Andy. We have got to get you out of that shell of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy looked down at himself, rather confused, and saw definition in his chest and torso that had definitely not been there this morning. His abdominals were showing in greater relief than before, there were these two tight striations near his waist, and his chest seemed tighter and stronger. Andy turned and looked at himself more, seeing his shoulders looked a little more broad. &quot;Huh...wow...maybe you&#39;re right. I guess getting away from the ball and chain lets me appreciate myself a little bit more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holland chuckled and put an arm around Andy and started leading the way to the pool deck, whispering in his ear, &quot;You know, if we don&#39;t have any luck up there, I could polish your pole for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Whaaa---!?&quot; Andy blushed and looked at a smirking Holland, who elaborated, &quot;What happens in Vacay, Stays in Vacay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...thought that was Vegas, but---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look sharp and abandon your nerves, bro!&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, both of them exited from the lower decks on to the upper swimming pool deck, and Andy&#39;s eyes went wide. He saw a vast array of the sexiest numbers of both genders arrayed up on the deck, people were running around and swimming in the massive pool at the center, or catching up with their tan on a variety of tanning beds, and a lot of flirting was obviously going on. A muscular red head walked right past Andy and Holland, a giggling blond woman following after.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re all so...beautiful.&quot; Andy almost felt like he was as out of place as a nerd in the line of a college football game.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re no slouch, c&#39;mon man, let&#39;s get laid tonight.&quot; Holland said and then bounded off to go find someone apt to occupy his bed.<br />
<br />
Andy swore to himself and then headed off, first deciding to jump into the pool, being rather surprised by its depth and the well crafted look of the pool. And he was also surprised by how well he was doing. He had jumped right into the deep end, and despite usually not being exactly very into swimming, he was treading water very well indeed. As he swam across the pool, he saw in between breaths a couple of women in bikinis sitting by the edge watching...him? And they were...they seemed excited.<br />
<br />
He brought himself up for air as he reached the opposite end of the pool, and ended up seeing a dark haired woman sitting by herself in a pool chair with an umbrella set up over her. Figuring that it was better to try than to just languish, Andy brought himself out of the pool, glistening in water and chlorine. Heading over and taking a seat by her, he said, &quot;Hey, can&#39;t help but notice you&#39;re all by your lonesome...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And here you are.&quot; She commented, looking him over, &quot;It seems you take well to it. Growing into the physique of a strong knight...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh uh, thank you, people have been uh, telling me that. Are you---?&quot; He asked, but was cut off as she got up and looked him over again from her standing position.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m &quot;up&quot; to assuage our mutual needs, and I can tell that&#39;s what you came up here for, no?&quot; She said, observing his now tighter due to water intake swim trunks clinging to his half-hard manhood. <br />
<br />
Andy gulped and tried to get his swim trunks to look more modest, but he looked up at her and said, &quot;Uhh, I wasn&#39;t in it totally just for sex...&quot; He did admit that was probably 70% of the point behind his decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it just so happens I decided I&#39;m in it with you, particularly, for it. My name is Morgan, and yours, my quaint little boy toy...?&quot; She seemed to be taking some amusement from this.<br />
<br />
Andy spoke up and stood up, biting his lip a little bit, &quot;I&#39;m Andy. Andy Branton. Nice to uh, meet you, Miss Morgan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, Andy Andy Branton,&quot; she took hold of his arm and began pulling him toward the way back into the rooms, &quot;Less &quot;miss&quot;, it makes me feel old. And I do not need that in my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy had never known a woman to take such charge in wanting sex, let alone being so bold about it, but he guessed this was refreshing after how icy and cold Lucy could get. Honestly, fucking Lucy was like handling a doll. No cooperation, except a few recorded lines. Andy led the way down to the room, and wondered what luck Holland was going to be having. He swore, muscled guy like Holland could probably bring home a guy and a woman both...<br />
<br />
Morgan quickly began disrobing for a given value of disrobing, taking off her bikini and swim shorts, and then immediately stepped in to helping Andy. He let out a breath as she pulled his swim trunks down and he kicked them under the bed.<br />
<br />
Andy was rather surprised by how forward she was being here too, as she started kissing at his chest while rubbing his manhood with one hand, expertly polishing the head and then moving down, her free hand going from massaging his balls to lightly rubbing behind his balls and teasing his ass. Andy for his part took her generous endowments in his hand, and even though she lightly gasped and complimented him under her breath, she seemed to be really in control here.<br />
<br />
Falling on to the bed, Morgan set up and started to go down on him. Andy gasped, &quot;This never happens to me...&quot; He then felt her mouth, hot and wet, on his manhood, licking and bobbing up and down. Andy gripped the bedsheets, tensing his muscles and gritting his teeth. Think about Lucy&#39;s mother naked, think about tax numbers, think about the Presidency... Andy told himself. Morgan was damned good at this.<br />
<br />
Thankfully another form of distraction soon arrived.<br />
<br />
Holland returned with another guest to the opposite bed, the muscular blond bodybuilder already making out with a thinner young man with light brown hair and slate gray eyes, whose toned, muscular body was rife with sweat. Holland commented as he got ready to start making out with and then fucking his own date, &quot;Well, seems you found someone before even I did...impressive. Say Hi, Dale! This is my hot friend, Andy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Andy,&quot; Dale, the young man Holland had brought over, waved and blatantly checked out Andy even as Andy got that blow job.<br />
<br />
Andy couldn&#39;t even respond, and soon enough Morgan came back up, leaving his rod glistening and throbbing, fully engorged. She looked around and smirked at him, &quot;Two best friends having a, shall we say, fucking good time in the same room...lucky boy.&quot; With that, Morgan switched positions and beckoned Andy to come and fill her pussy.<br />
<br />
Andy breathed and grinned, heading in. Even as he heard the sound of Holland starting to make out with his date, Andy couldn&#39;t help but note it seemed Holland looked slightly different. Did he seem a year or so younger? Something like that seemed the case. His muscles hadn&#39;t been affected, definitely, and it seemed subtle. And was Holland&#39;s hair longer...?<br />
<br />
As Andy plunged in, he groaned, &quot;Ohh yeah, this is the best vacation ever...&quot;</p>
