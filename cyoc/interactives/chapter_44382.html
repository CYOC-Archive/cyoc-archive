<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I-I don't know...&quot; stammering like I was, Drew began to realize how much of a virgin I was and how little I knew despite of where I lived. It seemed impossible, but the proof that someone could avoid it all was standing in front of him with my hard on against his face. His brow furrowed, &quot;You are 21, right?&quot; He was starting to feel guilty,  'Oh shit! What if he IS just a kid... why didn’t I look him up before I had this dumb idea?!'  &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; I responded, managing it without a stammer this time. My eyes stayed down at him, honestly not knowing what he was talking about, &quot;Almost 22, sir.&quot; &quot;And you don’t know what to do with this shaft?&quot; He wondered if I was sane now... my dick upon closer detail, was in fact MUCH thicker than his own, still not as long, but thicker. My balls were even bigger than his. I was hung low, where his were closer to his shaft, a side effect from his early drug use. Luckily, he had never got caught and landed a job as a cop.  &quot;I uh.. jerk it...&quot; I said, never having seen any sex myself and never having any access to porn, I really did have no clue as to what a guy would do with another's dick, &quot;I guess... You can stroke it?&quot; I say, sounding unsure.<br />
<br />
	Drew laughed, standing &quot;Oh my...&quot; shaking my head, he could see in my eyes that I had no clue what to do. He picked up his pants, zipping and buttoning them as he walked out of sight and then came back not a minute later with a key, &quot;So you really are a virgin…?&quot; He unlocked the door and opened it wide for me, but instead of letting me pass, he stepped inside with me, which may be a stupid move on a the cop’s part, but he still had the key, which he slid in his pocket. So if somehow I could get it away from him, only then could he be in trouble. He just needed to remember that I was somewhat of a trouble maker if anything else, hardly much of a criminal. &quot;Y-yes... sir...&quot; I was standing there, not making any attempt to escape, and I probably wouldn't even if Drew hadn't been blocking it. My gaze and body followed to face him and I realized just how naked I was, my shorts around my ankles along with my shoes, my hoodie and shirt on the ground. I swallowed nervously and tried to cover my parts, not succeeding very well, though. Drew was a head taller than me, his t-shirt looked like a rag at this point covered in sweat and smelled of it as well, his dark chest hairs poked out of the collar, which was stretched out, exposing more chest than it normally would. &quot;You’re a fa-.. You’re gay right?&quot; Drew asked wondering just how 'pure and innocent' I was. He was really feeling the guilt, as if had defiled some sacred object. <br />
<br />
	I pause for a moment, then nodding, knowing I couldn't deny that I had gotten hard as he touched me and had started thinking about Drew sexually. &quot;Yes, sir...&quot; I said, quickly licking my lips, unsure of what I was doing. &quot;So... You want this to continue, then?&quot; He wanted this to happen on a regular basis, drugs or not. My name would be cleared, I would be off the police watch list. Drew would tell them,  the guys at the station, that I had been innocent and it would be settled quietly. He could probably expect Darnell to be in this cell next time for his own possession of drugs. I was nervous even more now, it seemed like Drew had started reading my thoughts. I nodded again, saying the most common two words that have been coming out of my mouth tonight, &quot;Yes, sir..&quot; I say, my lips pressing together and my heart racing, blood rushing to my head in fear and excitement.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Do you want it to happen again, then?&quot; It seemed like an interrogation at this point, however my cock was still hard as a rock and Drew’s was slowly rising, though covered by his pants, due to the excitement of having a regular sexual release other than my right hand. I didn't really want to get fucked again, so I didn't give Drew an answer. Instead, I stared at his pants, watching as it looked like he was almost ready for another round. He grunted in disapproval of my silence, but he had expected it. &quot;Should I... get back on my knees then?&quot; he wondered if he could change my mind by performing for me. Something he rarely did. Like he had said, he was a top and he meant a top. All he ever did was fuck, that was as far as he went. Drew rarely had a dick in his mouth and never one in his ass, for that matter. <br />
<br />
	I nodded and felt like I was taking a risk when I said, &quot;That'd be.. hot...&quot; I gulp, wondering about this huge cop’s reaction. He didn't seem the type to get on his knees for me, either. But when he first grabbed my dick as he was fucking me and then rubbed it against his cheek... I knew that I was hooked. Drew didn’t say anything, but he didn’t like the idea of me holding any power over him. He got on his knees again, slowly, and took my shaft in hand once again. He slowly pressed it on his cheek, since I seemed to like the feeling of his stubble against my pecker. My only reaction was a smear of pre across his cheek. I was afraid to do anything, getting the feeling that if I had 'forced' Drew into something like this, I'd be screwed, though not in the literal sense this time. I watched him, becoming even more excited at the way he was playing with my cock. Rubbing it across his cheeks like that, it was so different from his rough, authoritive figure.<br />
<br />
	He grinned up at me, but tried to remain serious. This was new to him for the most part, he had actually only given head once and only played with a dick like mine... now. Drew was used to scrawny, muscular or not, men. But since he had become an officer, sex had been few and far between. 3 years ago, it was a heavy set friend who came into town. He was a very easily pleased bottom. Most of Drew’s sexual encounters had been like that, arranged and hush-hush. Drew’s 'serious' grin made me smile, helping me to relax. As he looked up, rubbing my cock against his chin, I moved my hand carefully to the back of his head, just past his ear, and felt the short hair there.<br />
<br />
	My cock soon slipped against his lips and with a little help and a nervous gulp, I pushed my shaft inside. I never even thought this would happen. He closed his eyes and let his mouth conform to my thick shaft, he began to suck me off. Once inside his mouth, Drew took control, again showing his dominant side. I gasped as he deep throated me. I kept my hand on the back of his head, not pushing him on me, just softly playing the smooth short hair there, liking the feel of it. Drew’s hands and fingers naturally began to find my asshole. Though only teasing my rim, now wet with his own spunk, my cock filled his throat. Drew not having a gag reflex really came in handy as he pulled out my cock, licking the wet head and it plunged back in, all the way, into his mouth. It was hard to tell from my point of view, but Drew was hard again. He was remembering that he had enjoyed the taste of having that one other man's cock in his mouth. <br />
<br />
	Despite my previous quietness, Drew really had me groaning now. He was quite the cocksucker and, even though I'd never had my cock sucked before, I felt like I'd never feel this good again. Forgetting the part about my police record being cleared, this made me getting fucked more than worthwhile and I was getting really interesting in doing more, just... Only with Drew. It was amazing how my ass could be so perfect and almost smooth, while my bush was so thick. He knew the only action my cock had ever seen was my hand, probably by my own choice and insecurities. Though Drew could see no reason why I wouldn’t have a relationship by now, he sucked harder trying to prove that this 'older' cop was worth my time afterwards. And he was pleading his case exceptionally. By now, I really was hoping that this wouldn't be the end. I was hoping that Drew’s friends would skip work or something today, giving us more time. I was already worried about his partner, David, coming in on us because, I was already growing attached to Drew.<br />
<br />
	He was the late shift cop as well as his partner, however David almost always went home before his hours were up. Drew worked from 6pm to 3am and at 4am another cop would come in on the rotation, though everyone was on call in case of emergency. It was close to 2:30 now and while I began to thrust on my own, slapping my sac against Drew’s chin. He tried to regain control by sticking a finger or 3 into my ass. I did slow down, but once Drew’s fingers hit my prostate, my didn’t seem any less pleased than before. If anything, I seemed more pleased, I was loving this feeling. Drew playing with that... thing without the pain of fucking me… and his mouth... all over, I was feeling awesome. I wanted more, but really, what I really wanted was him, even if I was too scared to say it. Drew would pull my cock out of his mouth with a slurping sound, while his fingers tickled my hole, my cock looked swollen and veiny, more so now than when he had first started, obviously I was horny, but damn... he felt a gentle nudge on the back of his head, it felt unsure and I was. I wanted Drew’s mouth back on my shaft, but didn’t want to force him on. With a second nudge and with no complaints on his side, he slipped my cock back in his mouth, taking it the whole way down to my thick bush, my cock hitting the back of his throat. <br />
<br />
	&quot;Uh!&quot; Gasping, as soon as he had taken my cock in all the way, I, too excited to give any warning, started cumming down his throat. Recognizing that spasm going through my cock, Drew pulled out enough so that I was shooting on his tongue, just so he could taste it. I shot out as much as he did, if not more as my cum oozed out of his mouth. Drew moaned, tasting another’s cum, something that surprised him. His own hard member throbbing and leaking pre from the experience. My shoulders sagged with relief as I panted for air. I kept my hand on the back of Drew’s head, still not to keep him there, but just because I liked the feel of his hair. There was something about it, the soft, stubble-like hair, something about holding his head, that appealed to me, made me long for something more.<br />
<br />
	My cock slid out of his mouth while he sighed, wiping the cum with the back of his hand. &quot;Damn... good shooter, too..&quot; He grinned up at me, with my hand still on the back of his head, softly rubbing it. &quot;Thanks.. sir..&quot; I say, breathing heavily. This had been probably, the best experience of my life. Even if I didn't make any money, I was getting something, something great and I was afraid to let go. Drew stood up, but didn’t move away from me as he leaned down, still hard and I looked up at him in surprise as our lips locked. I gave myself into that kiss, glad that Drew had made no move to remove my hand from his hair. In fact, as we kissed, he brought up one hand to rub that arm as his other hand found it's way to my back. Drew found himself letting his guard down to have a connection, eyes closed as we embraced. It could have been a ‘fuck and suck,’ we did that, but we were bringing these feeling to the surface, and it had been a while since Drew had allowed himself to be in a relationship of any kind. <br />
<br />
	I was soaking all this in, and I was wanting more. I put my hand down and onto his broad back, mimicking him and stepping closer to him, getting as close as I could possibly get. Our bodies were fully connected in a much different way now. Drew felt like he wanted to take me home and keep me safe. Feeling my naked body against his clothed one, it probably would have had more of an effect if we were both naked, but it didn’t decrease the pleasure and fulfillment we were feeling at the moment. Drew finally pulled away his hands still tangled in my hair. &quot;You’re free to go, now.&quot;</p>
