<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">[18 months later]<br />
<br />
“Woooah… easy girl!” You slowed down to a walk as Vicky pulled hard on your reins. You had just been for a long ride through the countryside surrounding the farm. You felt tired but content after your work-out as you gradually started to catch your breath.<br />
<br />
Vicky patted your neck as she gently guided you along one of the many paths that criss-crossed the property. As you continued a bit further you came across Vicky’s father, who was busy walking the family’s dogs. Since Jasmine arrived the pack had been joined by a male mastiff and a female doberman, both of whom were here serving their punishments for causing problems back at the Zoo.<br />
<br />
“Hi daddy,” Vicky called out, “how is everyone doing?”<br />
<br />
“Good dear,” David replied with a smile, “three bitches are all close to birthing, while the males all still seem to enjoy their company!” As Vicky’s father said this a happy woof suddenly rang out from one of the dogs. You soon spotted that it was Jasmine, who was now panting with her tongue lolling out as she wagged her tail. “Yes, you’re looking forward to having your next batch of puppies aren’t you girl. What will that be… your eighth, ninth maybe?” Jasmine simply woofed again happily as Vicky’s father rubbed her head playfully.<br />
<br />
While Jasmine was busy getting all the attention, you couldn’t help noticing the contrasting reaction of the heavily pregnant labrador beside her. The dog that you knew was once Vicky’s ex boyfriend still clearly resented being trapped as a female animal. You could see that she was trying to plead with Vicky to change her back, but a slight chuckle above you told you that Vicky wasn’t interested.<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky waved goodbye to David and the dogs before she encouraged you to keep moving. You then turned off the path and headed into the main farmyard. You looked around at the various animals until you saw Vicky’s mother standing over the chicken coop as she performed the daily egg collection. In the meantime the hens were busy milling around outside as they pecked at the grain that had been scattered across the floor for them. You soon spotted Keira amongst their number as she clucked and strutted around as if she had lived like this her whole life.<br />
<br />
After seeing that Keira was doing okay, you looked around some more until you saw Olivia and Sebastian curled up together on a nearby wall. The two cats had obviously formed a close bond as you watched them grooming each other lovingly. From what you had heard they had also been busy behind the scenes as apparently Olivia had given birth to over fifty kittens across multiple litters. None of the little ones tended to stay at the farm for very long as they were purchased in advance, but Olivia didn’t seem too concerned given that she always had her loyal mate by her side.<br />
<br />
As you gradually passed Olivia and Keira, you found yourself heading towards the open fields that surrounded the farm. A friendly moo from nearby made you turn your head as you saw Bertha munching on a mouthful of grass. You whinnied out to her happily and were glad to see that she was enjoying herself. <br />
<br />
However, Bertha was soon distracted by a deep bellow from the neighbouring field. You looked over to see Freddie the bull calling your friend over to him as he looked at her intensely. You were a bit hurt when Bertha decided to leave you and go and talk to the bull. However, when she turned her fat ass away from you, your mind was put at ease as you understood why she had done so. Now, Bertha’s bovine pussy was wet and swollen with need. Clearly she was in season and destined to be mated soon.<br />
<br />
“Tomorrow morning,” Vicky said upon noticing your curiosity, “that’s when Bertha will be getting knocked-up for a third time.” Hearing this once would have made you feel disgusted. But now, as you watched the two lovers playfully licking each other and mooing happily, you felt nothing but happiness for your friend as you left her to it.<br />
<br />
Next on your list of notable destinations was the stallion’s field. You whinnied happily as the four closest studs trotted over to greet you. Vicky chuckled as you exchanged suggestive looks with the sexy males admiring you. You had it on good authority that you were pregnant, having already given birth to Harry’s child six months ago. Despite this though, there was no harm in having plenty of practice for when you were next available.<br />
<br />
You started to feel hot and bothered as you imagined being with the sexy stallions again. Vicky had to kick you and pull hard on the reins to get you to keep moving. “Come on Princess, keep going. If you’re good I may let one of your lovers pay you a visit later this evening.” Upon hearing this you instantly quietened down and went back to being on your best behaviour. Obeying Vicky’s orders for a short while was a short price to pay for getting fucked by one of those wonderful stallions.<br />
<br />
With this in mind you continued with a slight spring in your step as you reached the sheep field. You and Vicky entered the field as you searched for your parents and sister amongst the crowd. You soon came across Alice and Anna as they stood grazing together near the edge of the field. Both had adorable lambs nursing from between their legs whilst they looked over them protectively.<br />
<br />
When they spotted you both sheep left their food and came over to you. You bent your head down to lick at their muzzles as they looked up at you lovingly. Although you were no longer the same species you still saw these animals as your family. You felt bad that so much had been taken away from them, but you were at least glad they were safe and that they still had each other for company.<br />
<br />
You continued to nuzzle your sister and mum until a loud series of bleats caused you to look away. You turned to see your father fertilising another member of the flock as he pumped his virile seed deep inside her. He took a few moments to recover after dismounting, but soon came trotting over once he spotted you. You gave him a similar licking treatment as you expressed how happy you were to see him. And although it should have seemed odd that Aaron regularly fucked your mother and sister, and that the lambs currently nursing from them were both his; in your warped sense of logic you figured that at least your father was protecting them and making them happy.<br />
<br />
You remained with your family for a short while until Vicky told you that it was time to leave. You looked back and whinnied to them as you left, after which you saw Anna and Alice returning to their grazing while your dad started hunting for another ewe to impregnate. <br />
<br />
Having now seen that all of your friends and family were okay, you started to feel warm and happy inside; now that you no longer felt as bad for being partly responsible for bringing them all here in the first place. <br />
<br />
And now, as you headed back to your own field, you felt truly content. After all you were surrounded by your friends and family, and were cared for by three loving owners. You had everything you needed for a simple, care-free life out in the countryside, at-one with nature. Living as Princess was much better than your old human existence, most of which you had forgotten so that it now seemed like a distant bad dream.<br />
<br />
Before long you were busy standing in your field, merrily grazing with the other mares. Vicky’s promise of a stallion later that evening made you feel giddy inside. This also meant that when you shut your eyes and reflected on things you came to the happy conclusion that life didn’t get any better than this. <br />
<br />
You were happy as a horse. You were happy being Princess.</p>
