<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian Walker was unhappy, although uncertain who he should be mad at.<br />
Julie Stovall, for leading him on once more? Granted, the sex was always good between them, but the were-otter was getting sick and tired that the only time the were-mermaid showed any interest in him was when she wanted to get laid.<br />
Mr. and Mrs. Stovall, for interrupting his evening and giving him a ride home? Okay, they&#39;re Julie&#39;s parents and they had every right to be mad since she snuck out of the house, again. The fact they ran into each other at the lake was just pure coincidence, and thankfully the Stovalls didn&#39;t catch him with their daughter. Otherwise... who knows what might had happened? Yet the fact that they forgot he was in the back seat of their car until almost reaching their place, so he had to walk the rest of the way home anyway didn&#39;t help Brian&#39;s mood. At least they didn&#39;t see Julie on the way, because if she had spilled the beans about what happened between her and Brian with the mood her folks were in...<br />
Alyssa Cooper, for not keeping her promise about her and Brian having some private sex &quot;lessons&quot; before he had to go home for the night? The Stovalls&#39; ride offer was totally unexpected, yet the hot looking adult were-mermaid had disappeared before Julie&#39;s parents made the suggestion. Okay, he couldn&#39;t blame her for that part. If he could have, Brian would of gotten out of there the first chance he had too. Yet he had no way to contact the sexy blonde with the dolphin tail.<br />
The only consolations out of the whole night was that Brian had once again beaten his mother home for the night so she would never know he was out later than he should of been. Alyssa&#39;s pussy was REALLY tasty, which made him long for more time with her; and that come tomorrow morning at school, Brian would start telling everyone about Julie&#39;s new troubles and extended grounding, and would have the added satisfaction of telling Julie they were through, especially if he waited and did so right before the latest session of the history class they had together started!<br />
<br />
John Shaffer stood a way&#39;s off and watched Julie Stovall being yanked into her own house by an angry parent before the front door was slammed shut.<br />
Still in his fursona since it was well after dark, the young werewolf stared at the house down the street and thought he was glad it was her and not him.<br />
<i>Then again, maybe I&#39;d be better off in that situation. After all, despite the fact Julie Stovall&#39;s in self-made trouble with her folks, at least she has two capable and SOBER parents who love her,</i> he thought, turning to leave.<br />
He really didn&#39;t want to go home again, but what choice did he have? Tomorrow was a school day and he had to work tomorrow night anyway. <i>After all, someone has to earn a living and attempt to keep a roof over our heads and the bills paid,</i> John reminded himself, dreading what he might find once he did get home.<br />
&quot;Home&quot; was actually a small apartment over the garage at his aunt&#39;s house. His mother&#39;s younger sister, an ironic term for weres, especially considering the two women were actually only a year and a half apart age wise, did the best she could to help John out with life in general and his alcoholic mother specifically. <i>We both try to keep mom sober when she&#39;s home, which sadly isn&#39;t long between bar hops.</i><br />
Despite the fact all she ever did with it was keep her liver afloat and her sorrows drowned, John shuddered to think how his mother earned any money at all.<br />
As John Shaffer started to climb the staircase to the front door of the garage apartment, he wondered what would be waiting for him this time, provided his mother was even home at the moment.<br />
<i>Last time, I had to throw out a wererat who was searching the place for anything he could steal while mom was passed out drunk on the living room floor. Probably should of called the police on the bastard when I had the chance, but the fact the jerk&#39;s tail is now far shorter than it once was should keep him from ever bothering us again,</i> John thought happily.<br />
Yet even as he started climbing the stairs, John was surprised that he started thinking about Julie Stovall again.<br />
<i>I wonder what that uppity mermaid would think if she knew I only lived a block from her?</i><br />
<br />
That mermaid was too busy having an argument with her parents to give John or anyone else a second thought at the moment.<br />
&quot;VALENTINE&#39;S DAY? THAT&#39;S NOT FAIR!&quot; screamed Julie, finding out about the extended curfew and grounding.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the one who snuck out the house when she shouldn&#39;t have, so don&#39;t blame us young lady!&quot; shouted her mother in return.<br />
&quot;And where were you to begin with?&quot; her father demanded to know. &quot;We searched the lake but for once you weren&#39;t there. Even that were-otter you fuck sometimes hadn&#39;t seen you.&quot;<br />
Julie didn&#39;t know what shocked her more at that moment, that her parents had run into Brian Walker, or the fact that her dad just cursed in front of her. &quot;I went for a walk to clear my head. I thought about going to the lake, but in the end just decided to walk around for awhile,&quot; lied Julie. She couldn&#39;t deny the possibility since she had her swim bag with her, but thankfully her clothes were dry by the time she got home, so as long as nobody checked her towel...<br />
&quot;Well, we will definitely be talking more about this in the future,&quot; began her mother, &quot;but it&#39;s late and you still have school tomorrow, so get to bed.&quot;<br />
Julie was about to say something when her father added, &quot;NOW young lady!&quot;<br />
<i>What? Did mom and dad reconcile while I was gone and now he&#39;s totally on her side?</i> wondered Julie, as she ran upstairs before either of her parents saw her start to cry.<br />
Alone in her room, the upset were-mermaid cried herself to sleep. Her last conscious thoughts were thinking about how, despite the official promise Julie had to make to her father in his capacity as mayor of Moon Lake not to do so; she would eventually achieve payback against Eric Anderson and Spencer Lawson, as well as maybe Frieda Knight, Brian Walker, and her parents as well.<br />
<br />
Alyssa Cooper laid naked on top of the rumpled sheets of her hotel room bed, sexually frustrated, as one hand played with her clit while the other continued to ram the ribbed dildo in and out of her hungry cunt.<br />
The fact that Marty (Stovall) actually said no to her when she offered to resume their sexual liaison surprised her.<br />
The fact that his wife Melissa was at least intrigued by her offer of lesbian activity, if not a threesome between the ladies and her husband, was promising, but Melissa had yet to actually take the plunge with her fellow were-mermaid, no pun intended.<br />
Julie Stovall&#39;s pussy was tasty, and the younger mermaid looked willing, but how to get past her parents, especially in light of the new information about Julie having a curfew and being grounded, remained to be seen.<br />
That young were-otter certainly had a talented tongue and, provided he knew how to use it, his cock looked promising. <i>If only I knew his name, let alone how to get in touch with him...</i><br />
Yet the one thing Alyssa Cooper vowed to herself as she achieved another self-induced orgasm was that before her vacation was over and she had to go back to work, even if she couldn&#39;t arrange an orgy between all of them, the horny were-mermaid was going to fuck each and every member of the Stovall family at least once!</p>
