<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ty got the the entrance of the forest, he noticed a sign.  It wasn’t written in English, and yet he was able to understand it.  It read “Beware:  Forest Home of Faeries, DO NOT ENTER”.  Ty shrugged.  “Not like I have much of a choice,” he said as he continued on.  <br />
<br />
There was enough light in the day that Ty could make out the path before him, but beyond he could barely see into the dense sea of trees, although every now and then he would catch a glimpse of some bright light flicker by, or hear the sound of giggling in the distance.  He did his best to ignore it, but his senses as a monk were telling him to be on high alert.  Every twice snapping and leaf rustling tickled his ears and drew his notice.  The hairs on the nape of his neck stood on end and his tail flicked back and forth incessantly.<br />
<br />
After another hour of walking and with no end in sight, Ty decided to take a breather.  He had stopped at a small clearing where the path widened and what looked like the remains of a campsite were circled by a cluster of rocks and downed piece of wood to sit on.  He took a seat and rested his sore legs for just a moment.<br />
<br />
His ears twitched as he heard that giggling again, only closer now.  He looked around, but could see nothing.  Suddenly, a flash of bright green light flew in front of him, laughter following after it.  Then a blue light, and a pink light flew by, followed by dozens more, each a different shade.  Ty was unsure what to do, and so he stood his ground.  He though it would pass until he felt something enter his zone of comfort.  He should have reacted with his high dexterity, but he was too dazzled by the light show to think properly, so when one of the lights hit him in the face, he was utterly defenseless.  <br />
<br />
As soon as the light hit him, his vision began to shift rapidly.  He let out a yelp as his sight flew higher and higher up into the sky until he was turned around to look down upon a form sitting on a rock.  A large and very muscular tiefling woman was sitting on a rock, dressed in monk clothes and gripping her face.  No, Ty realized with horror, she was grasping his face. Or at least where it should be.  He felt hands claw at the blank skin of his head, finding no purchase where there should be.  <br />
<br />
His vision shifted again as the faeire sped off, his face firmly in her grasp.  She giggled madly as trees rushed by at breakneck spead.  Ty found, to his mounting horror, that the further his face got from his body, the less he could feel his face, and eventually his sight began to fade until finally connection was completely cut.  Back at the rock, Ty’s consciousness was solely in his faceless body now.  Frantic hands gripped and pulled at the featureless flesh, but it was no use.  He found, thankfully, that even without a face, he didn’t need to breath, and the sensation of not needing to inhale was unsettling to say the least.  Only touch and sound remained of his senses now, and the latter was picking up the horde of faeries buzzing around him.  They were cackling without rest, finding his struggles hilarious.  He could make out some of the chatter too.<br />
<br />
“…poor tiefling no face!”<br />
<br />
“…smile was ugly haha..”<br />
<br />
“…let’s give her a new face..”<br />
<br />
“…Yeah, a better face!  Now where did we leave those other tiefling parts…”<br />
<br />
A moment later, Ty felt something hit his face with great force.  Several loud thwaps hit his face in close succession and suddenly Ty could see and breath again, although he wasn’t so happy about that second one as each inhale brought to his nose a musky, sweaty scent of sex.  He could taste too, but the flavor in his mouth was… a little salty and left his mouth feeling slimy.  The faeries departed as soon as he stood, giggling as they disappeared.  “Goddamn faeries -ulp!?” Ty began to say, but when he spoke he notice two very wrong things.  One, while his voice was the same, there was now a subtle lisp to it, like his tongue was between his lips when he talked.  The other was that when he talked it made him feel… horny.  <br />
<br />
A hand went up to his mouth and he let out a yelp as, instead of lips, he felt something fleshy, and hairy.  He felt his stomach drop as he felt lips of another kind.  He traced the top, feeling the erect little nub, then made his way down the folds on either side of the drooling entrance to his unshaven pussy.  The one that had replaced his mouth.  “Oh my god, what the fuck is wrong with this place?!; he said putting his face in his hands.  This was a mistake, as doing so revealed that his mouth was not the only thing that had changed.  <br />
<br />
When his palms had met his face, instead of eyes, he had felt the undeniable sensation of a cock and testicles, big ones, where each of his eyes should be.  They were big, hairy, uncut things that dangled comically on his face, each one much larger than his had even been, and the ballsacks easily filled up his large fists.  His vision seemed somehow unaffected by them, but was certainly coming from them.  Horrified, Ty had to know if he at least had a nose.  Two fingers touched down in the middle of his face, and slid partially inside the unshaven asshole before Ty withdrew them at great speed.  <br />
<br />
Ty slunk to the ground, hands digging into the dirt.  In less than an hour of playing the game, he had already been turned into a freak, one who’s odd mishmash of genitals were proudly displayed on his face.  <br />
<br />
“No, “ came a stern voice from his face cunt.  “No, I will NOT let it end like this.  Those glittery assholes are going to pay for this and give me my face back.”  The be-genitalled tiefling stood up, assuming a more imposing posture as a monk of his strength should demand.  Using his classes focus, he ignored the rising sexual desire of his face’s new occupants and began the difficult journey of cutting through the forest, towards where he saw the faeries fly to…</p>
