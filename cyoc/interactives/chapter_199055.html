<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jen finally came to, she found herself inside of an office. But she was unable to move as she pleased. Looking to her sides, she found her legs were strapped out to the sides. She tried to move her forelegs, but to no avail. Her hind legs were also completely secured by the straps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t bother, they won&#39;t come off with your strength anyways&quot; said a voice from behind her. An older looking man walked beside her and petted her on the head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me go.&quot; Demanded Jen, but she was completely ignored. The man took a seat a few feet in front of her and looked right at her. Due to her being on top of a table, she was at eye level with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am a bit disappointed Jenny. Here I thought you were making a lot of good progress, but hiccups do happen along the way I guess. Dogs bite when frightened or threatened. So we will just have to make sure you are familiar with being around other people so you can stay more calm and relaxed.&quot; said the man. <br />
<br />
He sighed, then looked directly at Jen. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t be doing this, but I will speak to you once more as a person. This approach sometimes is more effective anyways. There are 3 things that are absolute truths that you should never forget. 1) I can train anything to be a well behaved dog. 2) You are a dog, even if you just haven&#39;t realized it yet. 3) There is no limit to your stay here. You will remain here until you are able to leave as a well trained dog. If it takes 5 years, then so be it. But the harder you struggle and refuse, the longer and harder you will need to be trained. Extending your stay here. Your kennelmate is scheduled for about a month long course. But he is flying through the basics, unlike his kennelmate. He may even get to leave early. So if you want to stay together, I would suggest you quickly fall inline and earnestly go through the training course. We all love dogs here, so if you are a good girl, you will be rewarded. Just something to think about.<br />
<br />
The man then pressed a button and a pair of women entered the room. One secured a leash to Jen&#39;s collar while the other fixed a ring gag in her mouth. Her straps were then loosened, allowing her to stand up. As Jen got up onto her paws, she looked at the older man. His words were still in her head and she couldn&#39;t stop herself from remembering them. She felt a tug on her neck and hopped down off the table. She reluctantly followed after the women holding her leash, and didn&#39;t struggle against it. She had no reason to do so at the moment. And she did not feel like being shocked or tranqed again.<br />
<br />
Jen was getting use to walking on all fours, though it wasn&#39;t like she had an alternative. But she wasn&#39;t as wobbly anymore. She was lead back to her kennel and was let loose inside after her gag was taken out of her mouth. Rex, who was sleeping, got up and ran over to her and licked her face happily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, he missed you.&quot; Said the woman, and Jen felt a little better. She understood that she didn&#39;t want to be separated from Rex. He was a familiar face. Jen without thinking, began licking Rex back a few times before stopping herself. The woman shut her kennel door and left. Jen saw that the hole she dug had been filled in too. She walked over to her water bowl and lapped up a drink. She was thirsty from being gaged and her mouth was very dry too.<br />
<br />
She was feeling tired still and walked over to the bed and curled up. A few moments after closing her eyes, something warm pressed against her and a wait covered her neck too. She opened her eyes to find that Rex had laid down next to her and rested his head on her neck. She could hear a thumping sound and saw a fluffy yellow tuff moving up and down near her butt. She understood that she must be wagging her tail. Dogs wag their tail when happy or excited, which meant that she was feeling one of those. Likely, she was happy that Rex had joined her.<br />
<br />
That night, Jen had a weird dream. She and rex were in some field together, only she was naked and on all fours along with him. She had dog paws, and a tail. For some reason, she didn&#39;t mind that and continued running after Rex who was carrying a branch in his mouth. His legs were better suited for running though. Her stiff hind legs were not. If only she could have normal hind legs, thought dream Jen. And suddenly she did. She looked underneath herself and found a pair of golden haired canine hind legs had replaced her original thigh hind legs. Like this, she could not only catch up to Rex, but she managed to grab the branch with her mouth and tug it free. Now she was the one being chased. She ran and ran with the branch in her mouth. Rex couldn&#39;t catch her. She eventually tired out and dropped the branch. Her tongue rolled out of her mouth and she began panting heavily. <br />
<br />
Then she heard a loud whistle and her tail began wagging fast. She took off towards the source and stopped in front of a human with a bag that smelled really good. The woman handed her a meaty smelling cube and she happily took it with her tongue. The woman held up a single finger and Jen knew that meant she would get another meat cube if she sat down. So she lowered her hind legs into a squatting position and was indeed rewarded with another cube. <br />
<br />
After performing several more tricks, Jenny heard the woman snap her finger and point down. She knew this one too! Jenny stood up and lowered her fore legs, dropping her front half into a laying down position while keeping her ass raised high. &quot;Wait&quot; said the woman, and so Jenny held the pose. Rex finally made it over to them, and seeing Jenny in this pose, he quickly ran closer to her. Jenny could see him, and her tail began wagging faster and faster. But she kept the pose as her owner had told her to. As Rex got closer to her, Jenny began feeling a bit horny. Suddenly, Rex got onto his hind legs and took a step towards her before lowering his front on top of her ass, mounting her. Jenny felt so excited to finally being bred by her mate! <br />
<br />
Then she woke up before anything further happened. In her still half asleep state, Jenny licked Rex&#39;s nose twice and got up. She took a step forwards, but stumbled. She looked behind her and remembered that she still had her thighs as her hind legs. Jen frowned, but turned back around to face forwards and moved over to the patch of grass so she could relieve herself. She knew people were watching her pee, but choose not to think about that and just did her business. The words the older man had said to her still were fresh in her memories. If she was good, she would be rewarded, and if she did as she was told, she would be able to leave here with Rex soon enough.<br />
<br />
On the other end of the camera, the older man and an unusual woman were talking. &quot;You didn&#39;t need to go that far, sir.&quot; Said the woman. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but sometimes doing things this way brings about the best results. Wouldn&#39;t you agree, seeing as how effective it was when my sister was training you into being a parrot?&quot; <br />
<br />
The parrot girl shifted along her perch, using her long, shaped and pointed toenails to grip onto the wooden dowel she was crouching on. Her arms were encased in a pair of special gloves that were covered in colorful feathers, and a feathered version of the same tunnel plug Jenny had in her was also in the woman&#39;s ass, permanently. Part of hooking it up involved merging her asshole and pussy together too, creating one hole that handled everything, a.k.a. a cloaca. The woman&#39;s nose, jaw and lips had been also altered to give her a proper looking beak too.<br />
<br />
The parrot woman bobbed her head in agreement. &quot;Yes, it was effective. Though I wanted to be a parrot from the beginning, where this dog seems to not want to be a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, but a dog is always a dog. She will learn as such in time as well.&quot; The man smiled and brushed a hand through his parrot&#39;s feather laden hair. She pressed herself into him, enjoying his petting and wished she was light enough to be able to perch onto his shoulder and stay with him all day.</p>
