<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Monday had been a pretty weird day.<br />
<br />
You woke up as normal, rolled out of bed, took a shower, got dressed, and somewhere in the middle of all of that, you came to the horrifying realization that your penis was missing. You seemed to have, you know, girl parts down there where it should have been. Everything else seemed fine you just... somehow woke up without your dick. Also without your balls, the whole package. You freaked out about this for a while but you&#39;d been on thin ice at work, and calling out sick because your junk was missing seemed like something that both wouldn&#39;t fly as an excuse, and was really just entirely too embarrassing to admit to. So yeah. You went into work on Monday. Nervous as hell, and hoping nobody would notice. Really you were so freaked out about what was going on in your pants that at the time you weren&#39;t much paying attention to anyone else, but in retrospect, every single man you saw that day looked pretty damn stressed out and in retrospect, that makes sense.<br />
<br />
Once you got home from work on Monday of course, you got on the internet, opened a private window, and started trying to search for something about, you know, suddenly having your penis disappear overnight, and you got a whole lot of results from that, but basically all weird fetish porn and stuff. Nothing at all was coming up on like, actual medical sites. So you were a bit resigned that this was just some freak thing and resolved to call a doctor in the morning about it, but then when you were going to bed, you... found your junk. It was right there, tangled up in your bed sheets. Just... your own disembodied genitals. Shaft, balls, some weird little nub thing where the rest of you would normally be. You freaked out at that quite a bit, and your immediate thought was to like, get a cooler and fill it with ice and take the whole thing to the hospital with you, but, there wasn&#39;t any blood or anything, and it didn&#39;t feel like anything got sliced off. Really, while it was weird to think about and you didn&#39;t want to dwell on it, your disembodied penis felt damn weird in your hand. It was all hard and mostly rigid, but still felt like, you know, meat, and it was room temperature. Super weird. Your crotch where it normally was meanwhile looked like what you&#39;d see on the average woman. At least, you were pretty sure. Your experience there was usually just in explicitly sexy situations not when staring at a bathroom mirror with your own disembodied dick in your hand. Eventually though you got curious enough to see if you could just kinda like, stick it back on there and... yeah. The little nub just stuck into that alarming new slit you had like a magnet or something and suddenly you were just back to normal. All quite freaky, but whatever, you went to bed.<br />
<br />
Tuesday was still pretty weird.<br />
<br />
No other way to say it. Your penis came off again in the middle of the night. This time you knew to check your bed for it though and popped it back on before you went about your day, and everything was fine. Well, it was fine for you, anyway. Plenty of other people you saw while out and about looked real freaked out. Lot of people seemed to be calling out sick from a lot of places, lot of nervousness and crossed legs. It wasn&#39;t quite occurring to you yet that there was like... some sort of worldwide magical change to the whole of humanity where any time anyone falls asleep their penis just kinda falls off (well, the people who have them to start with anyway). Weird enough for it to be happening to you, why would it be anyone else? Rest of the day was basically normal. You considered like keeping a journal or like, sleeping over the covers and finding a camera to set up and catch the moment it popped off but... that was a lot of effort.<br />
<br />
Wednesday morning, it happened again.<br />
<br />
Which... yeah, at a certain point you just accept that searching through your blankets for your penis to snap it back on is just part of the new morning ritual. And it kinda seemed like everyone else was calmer about it too. And frankly after work you decided to show the guy a little appreciation, so you loaded up some videos, and unloaded your load, and, well, as soon as that nut was done busting the whole thing just popped right off in your hand. And it was a little bit freaky this time around because it didn&#39;t just snap back on like normal, plus, hey, there was a mess to clean up, and you were pretty sure while this was detached you technically had a vagina and you didn&#39;t want to like, get yourself pregnant or something, so you cleaned up and took some deep breaths and waited an hour or so and thankfully then it popped back on like normal. But now you were a bit more concerned about the whole thing, and searching around on the internet some more didn&#39;t seem like a bad idea.<br />
<br />
So you were about to close out the porn site but then you noticed the little most viewed thing said something like &quot;T-Girl gives herself a sex change and rides her own...&quot; and that wasn&#39;t really your sort of thing generally but under the circumstances it seemed relevant and... yeah, turns out you definitely weren&#39;t the only one with this sort of problem. Well, OK, this girl in this video really didn&#39;t seem to be treating it like a problem at all, she seemed pretty thrilled, and she also seemed to be crowdsourcing a lot more research into how this whole thing worked than anything else you&#39;d seen, so you poked around her videos and comments and blog posts and such, and the rules to how all this works seem fairly consistent now.<br />
<br />
Penises just kinda pop off when you&#39;re asleep or when they, you know, pop off. Otherwise they&#39;re just as attached as ever.<br />
<br />
They leave behind fully functional vaginas which at the very least... respond normally.<br />
<br />
They&#39;ll kinda magnet back on if held in place, but they need like, 15-20 minutes first to... rest up or something.<br />
<br />
Anyone can pop on anyone else&#39;s penis so long as they had a vagina to hold it over. There was a whole lot of amateur porn making that pretty clear.<br />
<br />
People were kinda speculating that if you switched out your equipment long enough, the rest of your body would start to sync up. There wasn&#39;t a lot to support that, really. A lot of trans people who seemed to be pretty happy. Some hard to verify stories from people who&#39;d just... straight up lost their dicks somehow and couldn&#39;t find them all week feeling like they were growing breasts now or something. Some women who&#39;d been getting into role reversal stuff with their guys thinking maybe they were getting facial hair. Hard to say.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that&#39;s been your week. There still haven&#39;t been any like... big speeches from the government about the whole thing. Not everyone even necessarily knows this is a thing that&#39;s happening, or all the details on how it works, but, you&#39;ve gotta figure most people do.<br />
<br />
Point is, it&#39;s Friday, you just got off work, and it&#39;s probably going to be a really weird weekend.</p>
