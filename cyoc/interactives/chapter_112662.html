<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael woke up at around 9am.  He was confused at first at his room looking different but then he remembered that he made himself younger yesterday.  He then got up to have breakfast downstairs.  Once downstairs, he saw his Mom and Rachel and Rebecca in the kitchen.  Rachel was wearing her softball uniform so it looks like she will be going to practice today.<br />
<br />
“Morning Mom, morning Rachel, morning Becca” He said with a light yawn while rubbing my eye.  Mom and Rachel take notice of Michael while was yawning and rubbing his eye.  Unbeknownst to him, Rachel had to restrain herself from hugging Michael to death after seeing him.  His mom on the other hand did not hesitate.<br />
<br />
“Good morning Michael, did you sleep well?  She said after suddenly pulling him into a hug.  “Uh, I’m fine mom,” he said, embarrassed.  Rachel and Rebecca were giggling at his predicament.  &quot;Is this going to be a reoccurring thing with you?&quot; He asked, having to crane his head up just to look her in the eye. &quot;Well,&quot; she began playfully while still hugging him, &quot;It is not everyday that you could make yourself younger. I might as well savor every moment that I have my little boy back, especially since it will only be temporary.&quot; She finished. &quot;Erm, that&#39;s nice, but I would like to have breakfast.” He replied, still embarrassed. He did not hate the hug. It felt very warm and comforting in his mom&#39;s arms while he was this small, however it was still embarrassing and she could not hold him forever. &quot;Fine,&quot; she sighed, reluctantly letting me go so he could find breakfast.<br />
<br />
He got a box of cereal but at my reduced height, the bowls were out of reach.  “Hey Mom, can you get a bowl for me?”  He asked.  Amused, his mom reached up to the cabinet, got a bowl and handed it to him.  He filled the bowl with cereal and milk and started eating.  After breakfast, his mom had something to say.<br />
<br />
“Michael, I will have to work until around 5:30pm, your father will be gone until around dinnertime and Rachel will be at her friend’s house after soccer but will be coming back with me.  I know that you are not really 10 but it would be irresponsible of me to leave you and Rebecca alone in the house for so long while you are like this.  So your babysitter will be watching you both for that time.  Michael was shocked.<br />
<br />
“Babysitter?”  He exclaimed.  “Yes, you apparently have a babysitter.”  It is strange, I know what it was like when you were 16, but at the same time I have memories of how it is like when you are 10.  She is your regular babysitter and she should be coming soon.  That is not going to be a problem right?”  Michael stood there with several thoughts going through his head.  He was rather annoyed that he had to be babysat, but the he was reminded that he was the one who wanted to be younger for a week.  “Michael?”  His mom asked sternly.  “Fine, no problem.”  He replied, resigned to his fate.  Several minutes later, there was a knock on the door.<br />
<br />
“That must be her.”  My mom said, going to the door. Michael watched on, starting to feel dread as his Mom answered the door.<br />
<br />
“Hey Mrs. Drake,” a voice from the door said, a voice that Michael happened to recognize.  “Hello Abigail, here to see Michael?”  His mom replied and they started talking.  He then got a look at who his babysitter was.  It was Abigail Marcus, his girlfriend who happens to live nearby.  They have known each other for as long as they could remember.  My parents like her and Rachel and Rebecca see her as the big sister they has never had.   Michael then “remembers” that in this reality where he is 10 years old, she has known him since he was born.  Apparently she has been my regular babysitter for around 3 years now and she likes to watch me because apparently I am smart and “mature” for my age.  He also “remembers” that he has a “childish crush” oh her, which she happens to know about and does not discourage.  Although she is not exactly his girlfriend in this reality, she is not seeing anyone.  ‘Maybe this won’t be so bad after all,’ Michael thought.<br />
<br />
“So, I see Becca but where is Michael?”  Abigail asked.  “I’m here,” Michael said as he started to approach Abigail.  When he came up to her, he took notice of how huge she looked to him now.  When he was 16 he was quite a bit taller than she was, at 10 he now only reaches her chest.  He had to crane his head up just to look her in the eye.<br />
<br />
“Hey Abby,” he finally said, calling her by her shorter name.  “Hey Michael, waiting for me?  She asked playfully.<br />
<br />
“Hey, isn’t Abby Michael’s girlfriend?”  Rebecca asked innocently (not).  Michael flushed red with embarrassment while his Mom and Rachel looked highly amused at what Rebecca said.  Abigail however was silent for a bit, and then she laughed out loud for a full minute.  “Well he is certainly cute but I would rather wait till he is a little older.”  She finally said after calming down a bit.  This embarrassed Michael even more but he did like it when she called him cute and the fact that she never denied that she would not mind him like that.<br />
<br />
“Well, it looks like you have everything handled here so Rachel and I should be going now.”  Mom said.  She and Rachel then went to the car outside.  “See you later you two.”  She said to us.  “Bye Mom.” Michael and Rebecca called out.  We then went back inside with Abigail.<br />
<br />
“So, what do you two want to do?”  Abigail asked.  Michael then wondered what he could do with Abigail while he was now 10 years old.  “Well, why don’t we watch a movie?”  Rebecca suggested.  “Well okay, are you okay with that Michael?”  Abigail asked.  “Um, yeah that’s fine Abby.”  Michael said.  He was a little dejected that he could not suggest anything sooner though but decided he should not complain.<br />
<br />
“So, what do you two want to watch?”  Abigail asked.  “Well how about,” Rebecca then went to where we keep our blurays, “this.”  She said after pulling a bluray out.  “Hmm, Zootopia, why not?  I liked this movie anyway.”  Abigail said.  Well, at least it is a movie Michael was willing to watch.  They then watched the movie; Michael was able to lean on Abigail for most of the movie.  When the movie was done Abigail then checked the time on her cell.<br />
<br />
“Oh, 12 already, why don’t I make lunch for you two?  Abigail suggested.  “Sure/Okay.”  Rebecca and I replied.  “Okay, will sandwiches be okay for you two.”  “Yeah, that’s fine.”  I replied.  Abigail then went to the kitchen to make peanutbutter and jelly sandwiches for the both of us.  While she was making them, Michael was in thought about his current situation.  From what he saw, Abigail right now only saw him as just a kid with a crush on her.  While he did understand it was because he made it this way, he was not entirely sure that he could handle his girlfriend treating him just like a little kid.  While it would only be until Sunday evening, he did not think he could wait that long.  But then he remembered that he might not have too.  While he was going to go ahead and stay 10 for the allotted time, he could always use the Chronivac to make Abigail remember him when he was 16.  He then noticed his sandwich was ready and decided to make his decision after he ate.</p>
