<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To the bewilderment of the fairies that secretly hid in these woods, Isaac completely avoided the enchanted flowers, the cursed apples, and the various other traps they&#39;d placed in this forest for their own amusement... Though there was now fairies saying it was time for the games to end with the ever expanding Corruption set to devour everything in a black molasses of unlife. <br />
<br />
Isaac had paid attention during basic training as a Adventurer as they were called, of the many, MANY various styles of boobytrap set in place to capture and twist the unaware and the foolish... such as the foolish troll who still followed him.<br />
<br />
The troll looked in dismay as the torn apart maid outfit reformed itself back into pristine condition no matter how many times she tore at it. Isaac remembered what he&#39;d read about magic, mana was self-propagating, the more it was used the more of it there was. Which is what made it so practical for items such as ever-burning-torches and self-lighting lamps and why golems never needed to be refueled... but it was also what made the Corruption so dangerous, it would not stop until it had devoured everything and every was consumed into its mass. <br />
 <br />
Isaac wasn&#39;t about to stop the troll from following him, as she was clearly no threat for the moment, and was just a victim of the forest right now in spite of its childish malice it had shown before. <br />
<br />
The troll followed three steps behind the paladin, it just feeling... natural. <br />
<br />
As it grew dark, Isaac found a decent enough camp site and began to draw the rune upon the ground that would protect them from unwanted visitors. <br />
<br />
&quot;What should I do?&quot; The former-troll huffed, swishing her bright blue tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe help set up camp?&quot; Isaac suggested, then remembered the troll were so insanely self-sufficient she&#39;d likely never in her life... Isaac was stunned as the former-troll moved with such efficiency and precision that it borderline on magic. The tent was pitched, the fire set up, his bed roll set up, all in a flurry of motion, and once done the former troll stood at attention with their hands in their lap. With a dilated look in their eyes she asked, &quot;Have I done well Sir?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... Yes, yes you did, how did you know how to do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
The former troll startled. &quot;I... I don&#39;t know... I simply... I simply did... like I&#39;d done it a million times!&quot; The former-troll shuddered a bit. <br />
<br />
&quot;There seem to be some linger effects on... what should I call you anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;BAH! You pathetic weak-flesh and your stupid names! Troll is troll is troll!&quot; Her eyes dilated again. &quot;You can call me what you wish.&quot; Then huffed. &quot;If you want to that badly.&quot; <br />
<br />
They were interrupted by the howl of wolves, or what could have been a bad recording of a wolf howl played through a gagging throat...  They moved on four legs, were pitch black, and eyes glowed red, they moved with jerking motions like puppets on strings. These were not were-beasts, if the stink of the Corruption on them wasn&#39;t a big enough clue. <br />
<br />
Blast it! The damn troll had distracted him from finishing the rune! <br />
<br />
The former-troll&#39;s eyes dilated again. &quot;Do not harm my Master!&quot; She let out a feline screech, claws on her hands and feet slit out, her fangs bared, and she became a blue and black whirlwind that leapt at the nearest wolf tearing it limp from limp. <br />
<br />
Isaac was able to dispatch the other easily, these were just animal turned into slaves off the Corruption, mindlessly attacking everything still living (as the trail of torn apart plant life behind them was proof enough), and unable to spread the infection themselves. <br />
<br />
The Corrupted wolves weren&#39;t the danger, the former-troll in their reckless attack did stab themselves with a branch.<br />
<br />
&quot;AGH!&quot; She hissed, seeing herself bleed. &quot;Why... why isn&#39;t it just sealing up!?&quot; She asked in fear. For a troll, a lost limb was an annoyance, and a beheading was an inconvenience, they were infamous for being near indestructible  if you didn&#39;t have fire or acid handy. &quot;The branch wasn&#39;t on fire! Why.... why does it hurt?! ... What is water coming out of my eyes?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Those are tears... you&#39;re crying because you&#39;re hurt.&quot; Isaac said sadly, finishing the rune so they wouldn&#39;t have anymore surprises. <br />
<br />
&quot;I... I am now a weak-flesh?! I... I... Noooooo!&quot; The former-troll screeched, running around. She shuddered, and stood at attention. &quot;S-Sorry for that... it is... n-not proper.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac sighed. &quot;You can sleep in the tent... I&#39;ll stand watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But! That isn&#39;t right! It is your tent! I should stand watch!&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac wasn&#39;t sure he trusted the former-troll that much! <br />
<br />
&quot;You are injured, I am not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That means I&#39;m the weaker one, I should get the lesser share then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac prayed for strength. &quot;Sit down, I need to heal you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The former-troll sat down in a dainty lady like pose. Isaac channeled the power of his deity, and sealed up the injury, not even leaving a scar. <br />
<br />
&quot;... What is the word you weak-flesh use for when some does something else for you without wanting a reward?&quot; Eyes dilated again. &quot;Thank you Master!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
The former troll dreamed....<br />
He was himself in his dream... and before him was the creature he&#39;d become... so why wasn&#39;t he tearing her to pieces?<br />
<br />
She said in a seductive, commanding voice as she strutted over to him, growing bigger as he felt himself growing smaller. &quot;You live only for yourself. You have no name. No ambitions beyond spreading random misery. Master knows the truth, to live for something greater than yourself is true strength... you are weak... I am strong... and the weak are devour by the strong...&quot; <br />
<br />
The troll ran away the size of mouse as the cat girl maid chased after him on all fours through the halls of a giant mansion. <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Out of the forest they finally came the next day, Calmach&#39;s crypt still some distance away. But at least the forest was behind them. The fairies annoyed they hadn&#39;t been able to turn the paladin into a big busted woman wearing armor shaped like a swim suit with a ravenous libido. <br />
<br />
The former-troll looked behind at the forest, their lair, their cave, with other trolls... not that she&#39;d miss any of them... they were all troll after all... all created from the original troll and lopped off body parts that grew into new identical troll. <br />
<br />
Isaac was genuinely confused when they came across an inn along the road... getting closer to Calmach&#39;s crypt, then again, there was always treasure hunters and Adventurers along the road, seeking treasure and wealthy with monsters taking old ruins as their bases to collect wealth from random victims that Adventurers would then collect and spend in an endless cycle. <br />
<br />
Seeing no reason NOT to go inside and get supplies, the two entered, finding the place empty except for a barkeep. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello there! And who might you be?&quot; The large balding man asked, looking like he could snap a tree trunk in half. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am Sir Issac and this is my companion.&quot;  He looked at the troll turned into a half-cat folk and her blue ears and tail and hair.  &quot;... Lapis.&quot; <br />
<br />
The troll shuddered again and her eyes dilated again for a moment but she said nothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well! A paladin from the looks of you! Let me do my humble service for such a brave hero! Two drinks on the house!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t accept your charity. and I don&#39;t drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not alcoholic. I know you types. And just pay me a couple coppers if it makes you feel better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac placed the moment on the counter.<br />
<br />
Lapis&#39; eyes dilated as she said, &quot;Please Master, let me get your drinks for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our friends, and I&#39;ll carrying them myself.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lapis&#39; eyes wilted, then her eyes focused. &quot;Why would I get you drink anyway?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Here ya go! He pushed the drinks forward at the same time.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lapis took both drinks without think, and Isaac sighed again. <br />
<br />
&quot;A mouse!&quot; Lapis cried out, seeing one scurrying along the edge of the room, taking a step forward, only to step onto a loose floor board the inn keeper kept meaning to replace, and the drinks flew into the air, the inn keeper gasped in surprise, just in time for the contents of the drinks to fall into his waiting mouth. His eyes widened in absolute terror knowing what was about to happen to him, and his last thought being to hate this stupid half-cat that had killed him. <br />
<br />
The inn keeper was engulfed in red flames... and when the flames settled down... in his place was a humanoid fox woman in a harem outfit that was more jewelry than clothing, her body bright orange except for her white &#39;gloves and &#39;socks&#39; and her under belly, her ears a dark drown and her eyes amber. Her figure was impossibly alluring, with exaggerated hips and breasts, her golden brown hair cascading down her back. Her eyes focused on Isaac first. <br />
<br />
She bowed lowly showing her cleave. &quot;Master! I am ready to serve! I do apologize. The person I was created from intended to turn you and your companion into me. But now I exist but to serve you. Please allow me this honor!&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Isaac could say anything, a gaggle of goblins stepped through a hidden panel in the wall. <br />
<br />
&quot;So Mac! You got another one! We heard the big flame! The slave market is gonna have a... an dangit!&quot; The goblin with a red feather in his black hat cursed seeing the scene. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Master, these were associates of the man I was created from, I shall deal with them.&quot; The fox woman said, drawing out a pair of &#39;fans&#39; behind her back that on closer inspection were actually several blades set close together. Red flames appeared on top of them. She leap over the counter, spinning like a furry fire ball, the goblins crying out and running as the burning blade-fans began flying around the room, slaughtering them. <br />
<br />
The gruesome task done, the fox woman then turned around to face the paladin again smiling. &quot;You may call me Ruby, Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lapis&#39; eyes dilated again and she smiled. &quot;Yes Sister! I welcome you! May we both serve Master dutifully and loyally!&quot; <br />
<br />
The two hugged each other like old childhood friends before standing together at attention at Isaac. <br />
<br />
 &#39;This is gonna be a LOOOOONG quest to save the world,&#39; The paladin thought.</p>
