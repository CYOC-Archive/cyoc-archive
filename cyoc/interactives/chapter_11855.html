<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a special delivery letter that came just two days after Jeff returned the application, plans mustbe made to leave. Excited about a full time position with promises of career training in a new field of animal husbandry, Jeff was ready to go.<br />
<br />
The next morning his bags all packed he had everything in his Chevy Tahoe and was kissing the wife a good bye. &quot;Don't try to call me no matter what, I'll get a post office mail box set up at the first chance, then we can write and keep the company in the dark about us married!&quot; said Jeff as the wife agreed.<br />
<br />
Jeff was so excited he soon forgot the expressway speed limit and was tooling along mindless of what was going on till the siren began.<br />
<br />
Pulled over he sat there as the ecitement of the moment turned to a feeling of grumpie old man. The Policeman was friendly and noted Jeff was traveling at 89 in a 70 mph zone. Jeff began to explain why he was in a hurry but the Officer just handed him a ticket and accepted Jeff's credit card as payment on the spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;$625.00 fine, dog gone it that's a heep of money!&quot; Jeff exclaimed as the Office gave Jeff the reciept for his signature. <br />
<br />
Now as Jeff began to drive again the happy breezes of excitement were not at his back. Cruise control was set at 72mph and he let the vehicle go it's merry way.<br />
<br />
It was 5:35 pm. when Jeff pulled into the entrance to the research farm. The plushness of white four rail high PCV fencing and the paved long drive note a company well financed. As Jeff's vehicle topped a hill the farm's buildings came into view.<br />
<br />
A large two tone gray house sat to the west of a circle of barns all painted white with black trim. One barn sat in the middle of the circle with corrals and fencing which reminded Jeff of his Grandfather's ole term, horse high, bull strong, hog tight.<br />
<br />
Jeff wasn't out of his can before Professor Beaker and a nurse came walking toward his vehicle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings Jeff!&quot; said Professor Beaker.<br />
<br />
Jeff was surprised and turned to shake the man's hand in a vote of friendship and thankfulness for accepting Jeff as a trainee employee.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to tell you how excited I am about...&quot; started Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please do come right along we need to get started right now! I have a tight schedule now that some new facts have presented themselves! Please do come along, oh and leave the luggage in your vehicle I'll have them taken care of soon!&quot; said the Professor as the nurse stood by but said nothing.<br />
<br />
Jeff closed the door to his Tahoe and pocketing the keys he walked along with the Professor hanging on every word the man said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes our schedule is now tight but still workable. I want for you to go with Nurse Vandella here as she will ready you for a physical exam, and some injections!&quot; ordered the Professor as he walked away and the Nurse quietly tugged at Jeff's sleve to follow.<br />
<br />
Once in side Jeff was told to enter a small room and undress. A white surgical cape was hung and waiting. Jeff now excited all the more removed his clothing and laid everything out over the bench seat all neat as neat could be.<br />
<br />
Exiting the small room the Nurse escorted Jeff down a hall to what looked like a Lab made of chemical distillation. As he stood there looking about the Nuse walked up and jabbed Jeff in the neck with a small seringe.<br />
<br />
Jeff whirled about but in just three seconds the drug too effect.<br />
<br />
Moaning from the induced drugged state Jeff was coming around. The pained ache of wrists held in tight handcuffs helped awaken him to see what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Groaning, &quot;What the hell is this?&quot; said a still groggy Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seringe! Well our subject is awake, how nice!&quot; said the Professor in a crass sort of way.<br />
<br />
Jeff struggled with his cuffs and the chains holding his complete form off the floor and suspeneded in the air. His white surgical cape was removed and he hung there in his pudgy 54 year old glory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this some sort of test for employment I can say it's not very comfortable!&quot; said Jeff trying to be nice even though he was embarressed to death right then.  <br />
<br />
The Nurse chuckled at Jeff's statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ultimate placement has been decided simply after seeing your lazy and overly plump form. I noted it when we met outside and changed your original status to one more suited to a easier lifestyle to which someone like you could conform and accept.&quot; sort'a explained the Professor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I am a little out of shape, true enough, but...&quot; started Jeff to explain.<br />
<br />
As then the nurse took out a huge seringe and filled it with a light blue liquid she handed it to the Professor. He took it and with a swab began to rub the area just to the right of Jeff's half erect penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch, that smarts!&quot; said Jeff as the large seringe was plunged into his skin.<br />
<br />
Jeff's eyes grew wide as slowly the Professor pressed the liquid into Jeff's now sore groin. As if by some strange movement of the liquid Jeff's penis swelling to a huge erection and held that way for some hours to come.<br />
<br />
Jeff hung there as both the Professor and his nurse walked out of the room. Now Jeff was alone and still trussed up like some carcus ready to be sliced apart.<br />
<br />
Then the torture began as leg cramps and muscle cramps jerked Jeff about in pains upon pains. Soon his moaning was screaming as the cramps mover up his torso and into the chest and neck.<br />
<br />
Wishing he would black out Jeff just continued to scream as one pain jerked another as it went on for hours. At long last the pain and cramps subsided and the Professor entered the room again.<br />
<br />
&quot;If this was a test, I don't know what it's all about?&quot; wondered a tired Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;No this was not a test but instead it is a sort of work based reformation! The injections are of a Flux formula changing the DNA pattern only slightly in your case senario. It was your poor physical health which decided what was to be your ultimate contribution to the companies' bottom line.&quot; said the Professor with a odd smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand?&quot; wondered Jeff.<br />
<br />
The Professor smiled and presented another small seringe from his lab coat pocket. As he inserted the needle into Jeff's neck he then stood back to gaze over Jeff's naked body.<br />
<br />
Kneeling down the man took hold of Jeff's right foot and slowly turned and examined it as if looking for some infection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I pass inspection?&quot; asked Jeff still dazed by all that had occured.<br />
<br />
The Professor stood up and grinned at Jeff. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you will do quite fine I'm sure of that! Your muscles have accepted the Flux formula based on the appearance of the tensed manner to which they now stand out from the bones. Your penis is still erect making note of the sexual organs which are a needed part of your final positioning.&quot; said the Professor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand sir! I was told the job was in the realm of animal husbandry, what does my physical muscle and sexual ability to do with the placement for work?&quot; asked Jeff his thoughts still foggy yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh so dull of wit are some! Being single and unattached was the prime need for what I had planned for you. As then if you up and disappeared from the face of the earth hardly none out there would pause to wonder! Secondly was the physical health of a subject and trainee. Your plump form showed soft muscle, had it been tougher you might have found your term here as something even more to the sexual. Oh but no matter I'll help you along and with about the next four weeks you should see many enhancements to your physical self.&quot; explained more the Professor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a paper pusher, what does my sex have anything to do with working here?&quot; asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
The Professor sighed and plopped down on a tall stool.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust you won't just relax and wait for the final outcome, some just have to ask and not watch! (Sigh!) Mister Adams, no we will keep you on a first name basis as it won't mix your thoughts later. Jeff, I have injected you with the special DNA flux formula which over the period of four weeks will in very fact reconstruct you entire physical bone structure and the muscles attached there to! Your genus will not change all that much do to your poor physical human self. Had you been stronger I was planning on your placement with Yellowstone National Park they need strong males there!&quot; said the Professor in a sly fashion.<br />
<br />
&quot;So the injections will make me stronger, this is so I can work better?&quot; asked Jeff.</p>
