<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alibaba admitted, as a genie, he could not use his magic for himself directly, and he could do nothing to his master especially effect him mentally if he had not wished it. <br />
<br />
But just as there the classic loop holes that Alibaba had grown bored to death of that had once amused him so greatly, there were other loop holes for genies who were fond of their masters, that Alibaba himself had never used.<br />
<br />
Genies were allowed to give &#39;examples&#39; of their power, and were free to leave it unchanged if their master would have approved.<br />
<br />
Alibaba admitted, if he had wanted, the boy could have burned through all his wishes by now and would have been a dumb animal in a zoo by now... but... he had done it all before, over and over, with so many animal lovers and those who thought nature had cheated them. <br />
<br />
Not to mention that Alibaba had included that Leon be accepted as what he was, nudity and lionoid and all... same with the others. Rather than having him hated or feared or arrested for being different or public nudity. And the others were likewise accepted by their family and friends. <br />
<br />
Again, none of these were things Leon had actually wished for, and Alibaba knew there were laws even he had to obey or face terrible consequences, but as a loop hole for &#39;the example&#39;, combined with another loop hole, the &#39;expanded wish&#39; it was in fact, the other side of the coin the vague wish interpretation that genies used to torture mortals with their own desires. Genies could add in details and functioning parts of wishes that precisely given, after all, that was how a genie granted wishes as much as a wish for a boat appear in the desert rather than in the ocean outside the master&#39;s house for exaple. <br />
<br />
Leon had already proven more endearing than most of his masters, or at least entertaining, the boy had already embraced what the genie had made him purely as an &#39;example&#39; and didn&#39;t even QUESTION seeing the others become jungle animals as well or the boy becoming a bald lioness. Nor did he once ask Alibaba to change them back. <br />
<br />
Alibaba saw it, the excitement, the thrill... the young boy was feeling akin to Alibaba, that this was a game to be enjoyed, and it wasn&#39;t like those being changed were actually being technically harmed. <br />
<br />
The teenage lionoid walked away from the playground, his new friends all going in different directions back to their families who accepted them without hesitation. Of course now logically, they were a group of friends, they were the only humanoid animals in the world after all... but if Alibaba could guess right, things wouldn&#39;t stay that way for long. <br />
<br />
Alibaba admitted he might be a little sorry when Leon would inevitably use his three wishes and Alibaba would part ways from him, this was turning out to be more fun than abusing his previous masters. Alibaba could only stretch &#39;examples&#39; (or as humans called them &#39;freebies&#39;) so far.<br />
<br />
Alibaba was lucky it was summer for the boy and so school wasn&#39;t an issue. But if his age and species were to be accepted by all as normal, an adult age would have a job to look after. After all, having fur and being a nudist didn&#39;t make one immune to paying bills. Even if he was currently living with his family. <br />
<br />
As for Leon himself, he wasn&#39;t even THINKING about his wishes even if he&#39;d come to accept what was happening around him as real. He correctly guess that as long he didn&#39;t use the term &#39;I wish&#39; in a direct command to the genie, it wouldn&#39;t count towards his three wishes. <br />
<br />
He was still charged and excited at what had happened before. Seeing his new friends become like him, did indeed give him a thrilling sense of involvement in something great even if he knew it was all the genie&#39;s doing. And the idea he could three times ask Alibaba to do such marvels for him was both exciting and sad that he had a limited count. And Leon all things considered still knew better than to try wishing for more wishes. <br />
<br />
Realizing he was hungry, Leon realizes there were some drawbacks to being totally naked. He thought about simply going home to eat, but he wanted to experience the big outdoors more with this new body. <br />
<br />
That was when a pouch full of dollar coins appeared around his neck, and his mane that as a teenager was JUST starting to grow in. <br />
<br />
Alibaba said, &quot;Do not worry, they are not stolen, they are not counterfeit young lion.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure master.&quot; <br />
<br />
Soon sitting down at an outdoor restaurant, Leon ordered a double paddy hamburger. <br />
<br />
The teenage boy, still being a teenage boy even if he was no longer human, turned his head as three attractive teenage girls sat down on a table near him. <br />
<br />
Leon looked at them... and realized... he didn&#39;t feel much of anything... sure he KNEW they were pretty and good looking, but somehow... nothing clicked... he realized why...  they were humans, APES... he wasn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
Their clothes dissolved off them as brownish gold fur covered their bodies, finger nails became claws and hands and feet grew to resemble paws, their nuzzled formed and their round ears moved to the top of their heads. <br />
Their hair fell out, leaving them &#39;bald&#39; as proper lionesses. The only thing left that were still wearing was their jewelry and their purses. Which... given nudity was now completely socially acceptable... some of which had been moved to some other places to show off. <br />
<br />
Without missing a beat, the three of them got up from their table they were sitting at, and without being invited, sat down at the same table as the teenage lion cub. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there.&quot; One of the three lionesses said smiling at him. Aside from their jewelry and purses, it was actually rather hard to tell them apart... but he realized their SCENTS were very different, and from that he could easily tell them apart. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. You three come here often?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a little bit more if you&#39;re here.&quot; One said smiling.</p>
