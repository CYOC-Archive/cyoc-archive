<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon/Sparky started to snarl at his former brother but thought better of it. He retreated to a far corner and nursed his wounds.<br />
<br />
  After they got dressed and Mike assured himself that Sparky/Simon was just like a smaller version of himself,he started to relax. He sat at the computer while his brother, Sparky/Simon, sat on his bed, and they talked.<br />
 <br />
 &quot;Hey, weren't you supposed to have a date with &quot;Moan-a-Lisa&quot; last night?&quot; Sparky/Simon asked in that annoying tone Mike knew all too well. Sparky/Simon was all little brother all right. He was just as annoying and just as irksome as Mike's original little brother had been, which meant that Mike had the same feelings of brotherly-love he felt for Simon/Sparky before today. <br />
 <br />
 He smiled to himself. &quot;Yeah, well after what happened, I guess I won't be seeing her for a while.&quot; Mike grimaced at what he thought was a lost love. &quot;I'm going down to the gas station on the corner for a &quot;Slurry&quot;, you want one?&quot; &quot;No thanks, I think I'll stay here and see if we broke anything on the Chronovac. We sure put it through it's paces and I want to make sure it's all right.&quot; &quot;Okay, but be careful.You know how powerful that thing is.&quot; &quot;Sure, sure!&quot; Mike stared at his brother wondering if Sparky/Simon fully understood what he had just said. &quot;Okay.&quot; He shrugged, checking his pocket for change. <br />
 <br />
  After his Brother left, Sparky/Simon got to thinking about how the events of the last few days had messed up their lives. He wasn't all together sure that his brother hadn't turned gay on him after having to suck Simon's cock, even if he was just a puppy at the time. <br />
<br />
 working at the keyboard he called up the diagnostic program for the Chronovac. As the seemingly endless check-list scrolled across the screen,&quot;Perception-OK, Intuition-OK, Sensitivity-OK...&quot; with all variables flashing &quot;OK&quot;, he wondered if there was anything he could do for his brother. An idea suddenly occurred to him. Maybe he could use the machine to make a girlfriends for his brother. He ran to his brother's room and started scrounging. &quot;Aha! Here it is! Rosemont High School Yearbook.&quot;<br />
 <br />
 Sparky/Simon went back to his room and searched through the yearbook for a likely candidate. &quot;Mary &quot;Know-It-All&quot; Knoll, Susan &quot;Sump Pump&quot; Sumpner, Tina Lovelace! Perfect! He tore the picture of Tina Lovelace out of the book and feed it into the scanner.Tweaking the settings a bit he activated the Chronovac and...the computer screen flashed &quot;No Viable Target&quot; Shoot! I forgot. Where am I going to find someone...Oh, Sparky!&quot;<br />
 <br />
 Sparky/Simon looked up instinctively when his name was called. &quot;Come here, Sparky!&quot; Sparky/Simon summoned the dog to his side. &quot;Nice dog!&quot; Simon/Sparky growled, Indignant at his new life as a dog. &quot;Don't take that tone of voice with me, I'm about to make both you and my brother very happy!&quot; He aimed the emitter at the dog, hit the &quot;Enter&quot; key and in an instant Simon/Sparky was transformed into Tina Lovelace.<br />
 <br />
 Simon/Sparky was stunned for an instant. He stood before Sparky/Simon in all his/her full glory of womanhood. Her voluptuous  curves almost too much for Sparky/Simon's young Adolescent mind to take in. He panted involuntarily. <br />
  <br />
 It didn't take Simon/Sparky long to realize the implications of what had just happened. He smiled at the young boy and his eyes penetrated Sparky/Simon's soul. &quot;Hi there, sweet thing! What's your name?&quot; &quot;Simon.&quot; Sparky/Simon squeaked. &quot;Well, Simon, looks like your in for some fun. Do you like fun?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; the boy gulped as Tina ran her fingers across his cheek. &quot;I bet a Bright boy like you has all sorts of great things he could teach a girl like me.&quot; she crooned. &quot;Some&quot; Sparky/Simon answered meekly, unsure for the first time that he had done the right thing. &quot;Say, for instance, what this thing does.&quot; Tina picked up the emitter. <br />
  <br />
 &quot;Don't touch that!&quot; Sparky/Simon jumped from his seat and grabbed the emitter away from her. &quot;It's just a toy. Isn't it?&quot; &quot;No, it's dangerous!&quot; &quot;Dangerous? Oh, I don't think a boy like you could have anything that's &quot;dangerous&quot;. Why don't you show me how it works? Hmmm?&quot; &quot;No! I can't!&quot; &quot;For me? Please? You could at least show me how the thing starts&quot; Sparky/Simon started to melt under her charm. He turned to the keyboard and thought for a minute. He had one opportunity to make things right again. &quot;Okay,&quot; he said.<br />
 <br />
 &quot;Suppose you wanted to change someone into a dog.&quot; &quot;A dog? Oh, I just adore dogs! Do you like dogs?&quot; &quot;Um, yeah, anyway...you change the settings like this. Then you would aim the emitter..&quot;&quot;Like this?&quot;Tina said, grabbing the emitter and pointing it at the boy. Simon/Sparky hit the &quot;Enter&quot; key and instantly Sparky/Simon was returned to his former canine self.<br />
 <br />
 &quot;Whew!Easier than I thought!&quot; Tina/Simon said to herself. sitting down at the keyboard. In an instant she was Simon again. The boy got dressed just in time as his brother returned. Mike glanced around the room. Sparky was in the corner where he had been when Mike left. He was licking himself. Mike smiled at his brother. &quot;Serves him right! Now he can have all the self-satisfaction he wants.&quot; <br />
 <br />
 Simon smiled at his brother and aimed the emitter at him. &quot;Hey, careful with that thing!&quot; &quot;Okay. Truce?&quot; Simon said, returning the emitter to the desk and holding up his hands. &quot;Truce.&quot; Mike agreed, &quot;You know that thing has been nothing but trouble ever since we got it. Let's smash it! that way neither of us can have the upper hand. Agreed?&quot; &quot;Agreed!&quot; Mike went and got a hammer and they took turns &quot;disabling&quot; the Chronovac.<br />
 <br />
 When they both were satisfied that it could do no more damage Simon said &quot;I have a surprise for you.&quot; He kicked off his shoes. Mike stared at his brother wondering what he had done but the next instant he he knew. The beauty of his brothers feet was too much for him he fell to his knees and started licking them. Simon smiled down at him. Mike couldn't help himself all he wanted was his brother's feet. He smothered them in kisses and sucked on his toes. <br />
 <br />
 &quot;What have you done? You turned me into a freak!&quot; &quot;You turned me into a dog. All's fair...&quot; Mike couldn't argue with that, but he had a surprise of his own for Simon. While still engrossed in the pleasure of his brother's feet he managed to fish something out of is own pocket. &quot;oh, Simon!&quot; Mike waved the object over his head so that his brother could see it. What had been a moment of victory for Simon over his brother soon faded. <br />
 <br />
 Simon gulped. He bolted to his feet and made a grab for the object his brother held out to him. Mike was relieved that his brothers feet were out of reach for the moment. &quot;You Bastard! Gimme that!&quot; &quot;You want it? Does Simon want his pacifier?&quot; Mike teased. &quot;Give me! Give me!&quot; Simon pleaded wildly. He had never wanted anything so desperately in all his life. Mike threw the pacifier across the room. &quot;You want it? Fetch, boy!&quot; <br />
 <br />
 Simon scrambled after it and when he got it, he started sucking on it madly. &quot;Just a little insurance, Simon. I added that little bit of lust to the equation when I changed you into a dog.&quot; Simon looked at his brother from behind his pacifier, tears streamed down his cheeks. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
 <br />
 &quot;Boys! we're home!&quot; their mother called from the front hall. Their father echoed the call. Both boys ran down the stairs. Mike fell down at his mother's feet. The sight of her toes peeking out of her open-toed pumps too much for him to take. Their father stared at his older son in dis-belief. Then he looked up and noticed Simon compulsively sucking on a pacifier. &quot;So, what have you two been up to this weekend?&quot;</p>
