<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How do I have a horse vagina?&quot; Drake asked, caught off guard by the fact he had a large equine pussy between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wished to have that horse&#39;s genitals, master. You now have them, a full and complete mare&#39;s reproductive system.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean... you can change someone&#39;s species too?&quot; Drake was astounded, his nethers feeling a little sensitive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Beldazarr replied. &quot;I can change anything. I&#39;ve granted wishes where a man could transform himself into a tiger at will. One master wished to be a sphinx, in fact he became the very first sphinx that the Egyptians based their lore around. She lived a long and fruitful life, gathering knowledge from around the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. I didn&#39;t... that&#39;s amazing. You must have had your hand in a lot of history.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really. I&#39;m ancient, but I rarely influence the world. In fact I shouldn&#39;t be.&quot; Beldazarr stated, crossing his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s still amazing. That makes me think of whole new ideas.&quot; Drake rubbed his chin, pacing about the room as his mind was racing through so many ideas, the empty sensations of his nethers becoming noticeable. &quot;Jeeze, this thing is too large.&quot; He tried pulling up his pants, only to find they barely fit, his mare bits bigger than his former member, and he was having idle thoughts of taking horse cock invade his mind. &quot;I could wish my penis back, right? Exactly the way it was?&quot;<br />
<br />
Beldazarr nodded. &quot;Yes. Wishes can be made as if they never happened. Is that what you wish?&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake shook his head. &quot;No. I got a better idea. I wish to be a dragon, like what my name means. But...&quot; He looked around. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be big. In fact, make me biped, and... what&#39;s the word. Human like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anthropomorphic?&quot; Beldazarr asked, getting his magic ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that&#39;s it. Anthropomorphic. I want to have a fit body that is a mix of human and dragon, walking on two legs with some powerful wings on my back so I can fly. Hmm, that would make shirts impossible to wear, but at least I&#39;d have nice abs.&quot; He chuckled, stopping to take off all of his clothes so he could stand naked. &quot;All that. That is what I wish. And make me purple scaled? Similar to the ps1 game I played, but not exactly identical. Don&#39;t want someone to come after me with infringement.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beldazarr nodded, and waved his hands. &quot;I will use discretion on your features, master. As for clothing, you didn&#39;t have to remove any, as the magic would have adjusted what you wore to better fit your form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake blushed, looking away as he scratched his cheek. &quot;Oh. I-I didn&#39;t realize.&quot; He smiled a little as his body began to tingle, followed by paralysis taking hold, every muscle remaining in place, only able to turn his head and breath from where he stood. It startled him, causing a brief panic. &quot;Relax, master.&quot; Beldazarr said. &quot;Part of this change will be uncomfortable, but necessary, and might cause you to do something that would interfere with the change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake breathed a sigh of relief as he started to notice the room get a little smaller, but looking down he realized he was getting a little taller as his legs started to reshape, his feet stretching massively, at the same time his lower legs shrinking and pulling upward, giving his legs an awkward shape similar to the hind legs of some animals. His toes began to grow, nails expanding and curling out into sharp and powerful claws, scrapping against the floor, just as his skin began to dry and crack, hardening into scales, starting between the toes and move up the legs, itching badly. &quot;Jeeze! You weren&#39;t kidding about uncomfortable!&quot;<br />
<br />
The scales continued to progress up to his hips, with the change of color starting where the scales first appeared, moving from a pale tan to a dark purple, going up his legs at the same rate. Drake began to feel a bit of pressure at the base of his spine. He tried to turn his head, but he couldn&#39;t move it enough to look back. &quot;Uh.. Can I see behind me, please?&quot; He asked the djinn.<br />
<br />
Beldazarr teleported the mirror from the bathroom to his side, floating a few feet away, allowing Drake to see the start of a tail growing out and stretching from his spine, the scales having reached up and covered his lower body. Despite the size of the tail, he almost looked like a draconic version of a satyr, but with a large mare slit between his legs, very out of place. The tail caused his mind to momentarily imagine using it on his oversized vagina, sending a tingle between his legs.<br />
<br />
That all changes, as he noticed in the mirror that the equine genitals were getting smaller. Looking directly between his legs, he watched as the slit continued to shrink down as the scales started covering it up. It soon began flush with his crotch, no longer so out of place, while a lighter shade of purple began to form around his lower belly, stopping before his hips. A small thump was heard behind him, along with the sensation of a limb hitting the ground, causing him to look at the mirror, only to see his new tail had grown quickly in those brief moments.<br />
<br />
It was about 4 feet long, smooth and covered in purple scales, the lighter shade under the bottom, almost like he was a lizard, which for the most part he was. The scales continued up, the itching very intense, making him grit his teeth and gasp his breath, becoming unbearable. &quot;Is there anything you can do about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Beldazarr shook his head. &quot;Transformation into a magical creature requires adjustment that isn&#39;t easy for the subject. The first is the body, making it what was requested. Afterwards, the mind will be affected to adapt to it. Your mind will be altered to have a natural tolerance to the sensation of your scales, like you were hatched with them, instead of born with skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake gulped and nodded, groaning as the scales crept up to his shoulders, the mirror moving in front to let him see his torso begin to firm up into an eight pack, his pecs becoming firm. &quot;Wow. I&#39;m almost....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dragons are naturally stronger than wrestlers and even body builders. You look slightly above average by human standards, but you&#39;ll be able to lift a car without much effort.&quot; He heard Beldazarr say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; The scales moving up to his neck and down his arms, muscles growing on them as his nails started to stretch out to over an inch long, becoming claws as sharp as the ones on his feet. &quot;These aren&#39;t going to be a problem, will they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you aren&#39;t careful. Dragon claws can only be harmful if they want them to be, but again as magical creatures, they can naturally make anything deadly about them be as harmless as kittens. You&#39;re claws will always look sharp, unless you trim them, but unless you feel threatened or just want to slash something, your claws will be just extensions of your fingers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well shit. Dragons are amazing!&quot; He shouted, and felt a tongue of flame escape his lips. &quot;Holy shit! Th-that was fire! I bre-ghlkjjhfef!?&quot; He blinked, and tried to move his mouth, but it felt weird, like it wasn&#39;t the right shape, making his words come out all jumbled. His reflection in the mirror confirmed this, as the scales had surrounded his face, and the first thing he noticed was his nose had flattened against it, making two slits, almost giving him a Voldemort look.<br />
<br />
This however didn&#39;t last long, because immediately his jaw started to stretch forward, causing him to feel a little vertigo while it pushed, the lips curling back a bit and parting, showing his teeth having sharpened and grew longer. In fact, he could swear he had more teeth in his mouth now than before. The stretching finished up, the lips settling in to close his mouth, and for a second his vision blurred, causing it to hurt as he closed his eyes tightly to shake it off. When he next opened his eyes, he saw everything was super clear all around the room, and the colors were more distinct.<br />
<br />
His attention was brought back to his reflection, because he then saw that his eyes had changed. Instead of seeing round pupils and normal irises, his eyes were a golden-green color all over and the pupils were slitted. He also noticed that the lighter purple that had gone up his chest narrowed before going up the front of his neck, and the scales were a slightly different pattern, with V-like lines going down. What also surprised Drake was his belly button was still there, a sign of his human side, perhaps?<br />
<br />
Drake turned his head to get a look at it, the shape of the draconic snout he now sported. Attempting to open his mouth, he was met again by the large rows of sharp teeth he had, as well as a slightly longer tongue to better fit his head, with a sharp point, but not like what he read in books. He also saw that his ears, which were once round, were now very long and pointed, almost elf like, and two slightly curved horns were sticking out from his forehead, curving back a little over his still present hair.<br />
<br />
The next thing caught him off guard, but then he should have expected them. Where his shoulder blades were, 2 large sets of leathery wings were growing out, the thick membrane growing out, attached to the limbs that were outstretched. He could feel the weight of the wings on his back, as well as the power they held, to lift him into the air when he wanted, and let him glide where-ever he wanted to go. The growing stopped after they were almost as wide as he was tall, which he guessed was about 6&#39;11&quot;, and then they retracted, the muscles relaxing to let the wings settle against his back.<br />
<br />
The itching, however, was intense, covering every inch of his body, from his toes to his head, feeling it in his crotch and on his back. The shock of the transformation was almost enough to distract him from all of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now for the Change of the Mind, master.&quot; Beldazarr said.<br />
<br />
Drake could feel the itching subside, becoming numb to him, just as his body began to relax. He slumped over, grabbing the top of the couch to steady himself, thankful it was over. &quot;Sweet mother of god... That was... both amazing and excruciating!&quot; His tail twitched, and he managed to stretch the wings again, finding that his mind had been changed, the body feeling natural to him, as if he had always been one, even if he had no memories of being a dragon, or knew how to fly properly. &quot;Thank you Beldazarr.&quot; Drake smiled, a bit weird with the shape of his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is as you commanded, master.&quot; The djinn bowed before vanishing into smoke and floating back into the lamp.<br />
<br />
Drake stood there, breathing heavily as he looked at the mirror that was still floating in front of him. It took him a minute of looking at his handsome reflection to realize that the mirror was floating. &quot;Oh shit.&quot; Quickly grabbing it, he walked a little happlessly to the bathroom and placed the mirror back where it used to be, finding he had to kneel down to get a good view of his head, as standing would only show his lower torso and the draconic nethers.<br />
<br />
He thought it was a little odd that he didn&#39;t have a package down below, but then again dragons supposedly like reptiles and their genitals were inside. Plus like birds, since they needed to be aerodynamic. Still, he was curious and wanted to see what his draconic cock would look like. Not to mention he was feeling a little aroused, an itch in his nethers that he needed to scratch.<br />
<br />
Closing the bathroom door, he walked up to the toilet bowl and lifted both lids, something he would do whenever he planned to masturbate. A place to flush the evidence, he used to joke to himself. Drake stood in front, and reached down, sliding a claw into the slit. It elicited a his and a rumble, causing his hand to get wet rather suddenly, and surprised him. Pulling his hand out, he looked at the claws to see it wet and clear. Moving his hand close to his face, his nose picked up a nice, yet alien, smell.<br />
<br />
Back down between his legs, he saw the nethers had become stimulated, but instead of seeing what he hoped to be a massive penis slide out, he only saw the lips get a little swollen, and his arousal skyrocket, imagines of dragon cocks popping into his mind, spreading open a purple pussy. He reeled back in shock as he started to realize it was his pussy he was seeing, and his vagina was wanting a thick, barbed dragon cock.<br />
<br />
Drake wasn&#39;t certain what to do here, but he knew he had to get Beldazarr to change him into a proper male. However, he was horny, and knowing there weren&#39;t any males around, it got him curious. Sliding his hand back between his legs, he gently slide the claw around the lips of his nethers, rumbling from the sensation, his legs shaking underneath as he felt his body wanting to be more than just teased.<br />
<br />
Succumbing to the pleads of his body, he plunged his clawed hand into his waiting and wanting slit, and began to masturbate furiously, groaning and rumbling before he climax, collapsing in the bathroom as he squirted and dripped onto the tiled floor. &quot;Oh.. Oh gods.. My god that... Oh.&quot; He closed his eyes, a hand on his chest while his other was still in his tight cunt, trying to gather his senses and regain his strength. &quot;Fuck that was amazing. I&#39;ve never felt anything so powerful before. Fuck.&quot; Staring up at the ceiling, he started to chuckle at the idea of keeping it. &quot;Man, Ethan would be so fucking shocked. Hell... What would he do? Fuck me? No, he&#39;s not gay.&quot; Drake laughed, groaning as be picked himself up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to clean this up. Fuck, I made a mess.&quot; Standing up slowly, he grabbed a lot of tissue paper and began to clean up all of his release from the floor, grabbing a towel and soaking it in water to further clean things up to avoid the floor getting sticky. &quot;Shit. I need to speak with Beldazarr and change my sex back... And maybe have him change my history so nobody finds it weird a dragon is attending college.&quot;</p>
