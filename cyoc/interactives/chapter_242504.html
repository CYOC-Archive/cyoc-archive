<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff woke up to warmth.<br />
<br />
Soft, slow breaths against his collarbone. A small weight curled up against his side. The scent of shampoo and childlike innocence.<br />
<br />
For a moment, he forgot everything.<br />
<br />
Then reality crashed in like a tidal wave.<br />
<br />
His breath hitched as he opened his eyes and saw the tiny body snuggled against him—his little brother. Or rather, Emma, still trapped in Charly’s form, looking like nothing more than a peacefully sleeping kid. His face was buried against Jeff’s—Emma’s—chest, his little fingers clutching the thin fabric of the oversized sleep shirt Jeff had thrown on the night before.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s stomach twisted.<br />
<br />
What the fuck had he done?<br />
<br />
The night before had been a blur of confusion, humiliation, and reluctant compliance. After Emma—now Charly—had climbed into his lap kissing him, there hadn’t been much Jeff could do. He’d tried to resist, but Charly had been relentless, giggling and squirming, kissing and poking at Jeff’s new curves, treating him like his personal pillow, his personal toy. It had been so weird, so humiliating, and yet… he let Emma being charly go ferver and end up naked eating him while she... he Emma jerked off.<br />
<br />
Jeff exhaled sharply, looking at the small form curled against him.<br />
<br />
He hated how comfortable it all felt now.<br />
<br />
The warmth of another body beside him. The way Charly had clung to him all night, wrapping his little arms around Jeff’s waist, nuzzling against him like some kind of needy pet. Jeff had been too exhausted to fight it—his mind too numb, too overloaded with everything that had happened.<br />
<br />
And now… now he had woken up like this.<br />
<br />
A girl.<br />
<br />
Lying in bed.<br />
<br />
With his own brother cuddled up next to him, hating what he let her him do.<br />
<br />
Except it wasn’t his brother. It was Emma. His girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Or at least… the person who had once been his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Jeff squeezed his eyes shut. This isn’t happening. This isn’t happening. This isn’t—<br />
<br />
Charly stirred.<br />
<br />
A tiny yawn. A soft, sleepy murmur. Then, slowly, his little body shifted, arms stretching above his head as he blinked groggily up at Jeff. His expression was groggy and innocent—until he saw the look on Jeff’s face.<br />
<br />
And then he grinned.<br />
<br />
“Mooorning, my lovely girlfriend!” he chirped, his voice full of that irritating childlike energy. He snuggled closer, rubbing his cheek against Jeff’s chest like some kind of affectionate cat. “Mmm… you’re so comfy.”<br />
<br />
Jeff stiffened.<br />
<br />
His jaw clenched.<br />
<br />
His body—this stupid, soft, curvy body—was betraying him again, reacting to the simple warmth of another person way too naturally. The worst part was that it didn’t even feel wrong.<br />
<br />
It felt nice.<br />
<br />
And Jeff hated it.<br />
<br />
Hated how easy it was to just let Charly cling to him. Hated how the weight of a body next to his felt weirdly reassuring. Hated how, for just a second, he had almost relaxed, and remeber how good last night felt wanting to feel that again. but managed to posh that thort off himself.<br />
<br />
“Get off me,” he muttered.<br />
<br />
Charly giggled. “Awww, but I like cuddling with my big girlfriend.”<br />
<br />
Jeff shoved him off, rolling out of bed and standing up fast, as if shaking off something disgusting. His legs were shaky. His arms were still wrapped around himself, like he could somehow shield himself from everything that had happened.<br />
<br />
He turned, glaring at the small boy now sprawled across the mattress. “Alright, Emma. Enough. Change us back. Now.”<br />
<br />
Charly just grinned, propping himself up on his elbows. “Hmmm… nah.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s stomach dropped. “What?”<br />
<br />
Charly’s legs kicked back and forth like an amused little kid. “I like this, Jeffy! I love being Charly. And you? You make such a cute girlfriend. Don’tcha think? plus i thort you enjoyed last night hehe.”<br />
<br />
Jeff felt his hands clench into fists. “Emma, I swear to God—”<br />
<br />
“Charly!” the little boy corrected, wagging a finger at him. “You gotta call me Charly now, my  big hot girlfriend! Otherwise, people will start asking questions.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s blood ran cold.<br />
<br />
He hadn’t even thought about that.<br />
<br />
People.<br />
<br />
His parents.<br />
<br />
His real little brother, wherever the hell he was right now.<br />
<br />
The more time they spent like this, the harder it would be to explain. If Emma didn’t change them back soon…<br />
<br />
He swallowed hard.<br />
<br />
Charly was still grinning. He knew he had all the power.<br />
<br />
Jeff took a deep breath, forcing his voice to stay calm. “Emma. Please.”<br />
<br />
Charly just rolled onto his back, stretching with a lazy, satisfied sigh. “Nahhh. I think I wanna be your annoying little brother a little while longer.” His voice dropped into a mischievous whisper. “And I think you love being my big girlfriend.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s stomach twisted.<br />
<br />
“Just think about it,” Charly continued, rolling onto his side and propping his head up with one hand. “We can totally make this work. You be the sweet, caring girlfriend, I’ll be the hyper little bro who can make you feel good—no one will ever know the difference!” He kicked his feet happily. “And hey, who knows? Maybe you’ll start to like it.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s breath was shaky. His hands were trembling.<br />
<br />
He had never felt more trapped in his life.<br />
<br />
Charly just giggled again, rolling onto his back and stretching. “Mmm… I’m gonna love this so much.” He gave Jeff a wide, innocent grin. “You ready to be the best girlfriend ever now?”<br />
<br />
Jeff said nothing.<br />
<br />
Because for the first time since this all started…<br />
<br />
He was starting to realize he might never get his old life back.</p>
