<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pascal brushed his thicker, longer, redder hair from his bright blue eyes. &quot;Do you like redheads, Master Dan?&quot; Pascal asked coyly, lowering himself before the tiny Dom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah!&quot; Dan exclaimed, gesturing at Patrick and Marcus, &quot;I love redheads! The bigger the better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pascal moaned feeling his body flex and grow bigger in response. He shook his body with delight--feeling his larger muscles jiggle--happy he was a little better for Master Dan.<br />
<br />
“Actually, Professor, you&#39;re a lot bigger than any redheads I&#39;ve ever seen. What are you, 30 feet tall?”<br />
<br />
Pascal grunted as his body grew and pushed back his desk, swelling rapidly until he was exactly 30 feet tall.<br />
<br />
“Mmmff… Yes, Master Dan. I believe I&#39;m at least that tall.” Pascal was sweating hard, his balls were aching with an intensely erotic pain that kept increasing. He knew redheads were hyper sexual, but this was far more intense than he could&#39;ve ever imagined.<br />
<br />
“No way… You look way bigger than 30 feet tall. It looks like you can&#39;t even stand up in here.”<br />
<br />
Pascal&#39;s eyes went wide. He was suddenly so large he could only fit in the hanger on his hands and knees. He tried backing up, the cool metal roof creaked against his backside.<br />
<br />
“M-Master Dan… I&#39;m so sorry,” Pascal&#39;s eyes started to water, his heart clenching, worried he might disappoint the tiny Dom. “I&#39;m too big to sta--”<br />
<br />
“I order you to stand.” Dan cut him off, his voice powerful and confident, knowing full well the power he had over a submissive redhead.<br />
<br />
Pascal couldn&#39;t even process the command, his giant body reacting quickly, disregarding the loud tearing and crashing sounds as his shoulders pushed through the hanger. It wasn&#39;t until he stood upright and saw Master Dan down by his feet did he realize how big he had grown.<br />
<br />
“Good, pup.” Dan grinned, craning his neck up to see the giant. <br />
<br />
Pascal&#39;s mind was racing… The redhead hangers he taught in were 60 feet tall, and this one only came up to his waist! He had to be over 100 feet tall… But the damage to the building was staggering. Perhaps he could claim the building wasn&#39;t redhead accessible… Otherwise he worried he might be on the hook for repairs.<br />
<br />
“D-did you call me pup, Master Dan?” Pascal&#39;s inflection was timid, but the sheer power of his voice knocked Dan back against Magnus’ belly.<br />
<br />
“oh, did I? Sorry, professor. What an embarrassing oversight. ‘Pup’ is a privilege reserved for my slaves.”<br />
<br />
Pascal&#39;s heart sank; his body falling to grovel in the wreckage of his hanger. Pascal didn&#39;t care that his oversized balls were talking up the entire campus quad, or that his classroom was flattened. As a redhead, he had bonded to Master Dan, he NEEDED to be owned by this man or he would die of heartbreak.<br />
<br />
“PLEASE MASTER DAN!” Pascal started begging through tears, bringing his hulking 120 foot tall body as low as possible before the tiny Dom he loved with all his heart. “What does it take to be worthy of serving you?”<br />
<br />
Dan grinned, relishing the power he had over this literal giant. Throughout the day, Dan would catch bodybuilders and powerlifters cruising him. He had made himself irresistibly handsome, which gave him tremendous power in a world full of muscle bears. But the effect was even more pronounced over redheads. <br />
<br />
It started with Patrick: he had used the chronovac to make it so all redheads were total slave types, despite their massive size or otherwise alpha personalities. Where most guys found Dan irresistible, redheads would irreversibly fall in love with him, bonded for life with a glance.<br />
<br />
Dan needed to be careful during the day. His three slaves--Patrick, Marcus, and now Magnus--were extremely needy and had grown emotionally dependent on him. But here was the BIGGEST redhead he&#39;d ever seen… He had to own professor Pascal, but he&#39;d have some fun with him first. <br />
<br />
“Well. You&#39;re certainly a good starting size. I expect you to keep growing bigger though.” Pascal quivered, feeling the command hit him.<br />
<br />
“Y-yes! Of course, Master! I&#39;m 50, haven&#39;t stopped growing since puberty.” Pascal trembled, feeling his body inch larger. “In fact, I&#39;m growing faster than ever.” The air shimmered around Pascal&#39;s body as reality caught up.  Pascal looked down at his hand, he could feel the ground under his body shifting slightly as his body crept slowly larger.<br />
<br />
“Wow...a redhead who is always growing bigger and faster… More everyday!” Pascal winced as his body lurched larger still. <br />
<br />
“But size isn&#39;t everything,” Dan snapped, his three pups falling inline at attention. “Only the most loyal, loving, and submissive of redheads are worthy of serving me.”<br />
<br />
Dan watched his orders take hold; Redheads were blank slates for his dominant entreats. The slightest suggestion from Dan could permanently rewire a submissive&#39;s mind. <br />
<br />
Pascal&#39;s massive body faltered as his brain discarded anything that might interfere with his loyalty to Master Dan… While the chronovac altered reality to ensure Pascal was THE MOST loyal, loving, and submissive being to ever exist.<br />
<br />
Pascal felt for his ring, grasping for memories of his husband… But there had never been any. His eyes went wide as he realized he had always belonged to Master Dan. Waiting for his own personal God to find him worthy enough to consider for a collar.<br />
<br />
“P-please” Pascal&#39;s voice was forlorn, anyone in earshot felt the weight of his submission and love for Dan, “please, my God.”<br />
<br />
Dan blinked, surprised, eyes darting from Pascal, to his three pups, to his sudden boner from being called “God” by this 140 foot tall giant.<br />
<br />
“I didn&#39;t realize I was into that,” thought Dan to himself. There certainly was something extra special about his professor.<br />
<br />
With a “CLINK” heard across campus, Dan collared Pascal. The giant redhead was so happy he couldn&#39;t speak, tears rolling down his face.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re welcome, pup.” Dan smiled up to Pascal, his other pups already familiarizing themselves with their new brother in service.</p>
