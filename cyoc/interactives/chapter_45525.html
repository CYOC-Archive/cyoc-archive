<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Oblivious to what was going on, Blaze and Frost were being surrounded.  Though their Dragon forms allowed them strength, speed, flight, and a smattering of mystical power, it did not grant them common sense.  The nearby Wind and Water Dragons they had seen moments ago patrolled this land in search of an easy meal, but if such a meal were as easy as the one the twins had garnered, then there would be no roaming beef left on these plains.</p>

<p>However, at this moment, their were indeed two Players at the helms of the Dragons up in the air just a ways away, and they had been watching these two newcomers.  Just moments before, they had noted the Ice Dragon, but had let the issue be since it's obvious sibling (obvious to experienced Dragon players anyway) had been keeping watch over it.  Now, however, things had taken a different turn.</p>

<p>Tom as Frost and Dan as Blaze both delighted in the ripping and tearing of what to them as humans would have been quite large animals indeed.  Their maws were covered in blood as the two of them partook in a bit of a guilty pleasure.  Real or not, any game that let you rip a cow apart with your strong and sharp teeth, it's meat sliding slickly down your long throat and into one of your stomachs... nothing could touch that.  It was an amazing feeling.</p>

<p>Just as amazing, however, was the pain that shot through Blaze's neck as ice-headed arrow thunked in deep to the muscles there.  Blaze howled out in pain, grabbing at the wooden spike with his right hand, looking over a shoulder and growling in the direction of the attacker.  Just as a growl were to escape Blaze's throat, it's eyes latched on to one of ten men who were standing on the roof of the nearby barn, each with an arrow aimed at the large red dragon.</p>

<p>Tom jerked Frost's head up, looking over at his brother's character.  There was a moment of delay before Frost threw down the remaining cow bits and unleashed a frosty, ice-shard filled breath in the attacker's direction.  They all vanished behind the apex of the roof, and Tom thought for a moment that he had scared them away.  A sharp stab of pain from a broadsword through Frost's back and up through it's chest was a wake-up call, however, as on Knight came up from behind.</p>

<p>"This must be some farm," Blaze coughed, pulling the arrow out of its neck with a spew of blood shower.  "This zone must be higher level than us," Daniel said across teamspeak to Tom, Blaze's lips remaining still.  A moment later, a shower of arrows rained down from over the barn, impacting into the two dragons more than a few times.  Blaze's left leg was pinned to the ground with some mystical force and Tom and Dan became sure they would be experiencing the Graveyard very soon.</p>

<p>However true that might be, though, it was not to be.  As four Knights with flaming swords approached Frost from behind, Aqua, the Water Dragon, threw his hands wide as an arc of damaging and heavy water fell out of the sky just over the twin Dragons.  The Knights were knocked to the ground, and Aqua motioned his right hand towards them, blowing them away with the force of a water wall.</p>

<p>As Aqua landed, the Wind Dragon named Twister hit the earth between Frost and Blaze, kicking up a swirling wall of wind not unlike his namesake.  The next wave of arrows that had been on it's way flew back at the archers, and more than half of them fell dead with the return strikes.  The Wind Dragon growled a threat to the remaining foes, "We will take what is ours and leave, and you shall cause us no more harm," he began, "But if one more sword is raised, or one more bow gone taut, we will lay waist to these lands, and your families will regret your actions," he spat a gust of wind into the ground.</p>

<p>The Knights and the Archers each lowered their weapons and stepped back.  "We will issue our own punishments for our kind acting out of turn," Aqua said, turning his head to look at Frost specifically.  The twin dragons looked to each other as Twister and Aqua stepped over to them, their wounds many, their forms covered in blood.</p>

<p>Aqua was the smaller of the two new dragons with a slick and wet look to his scales and a mane of water from his head and on down his tail.  His wings were short, but powerful enough to hold his form in the air if needed, and the end of his tail was shaped like a hook.</p>

<p>Twister, on the other hand, was a long and thin Dragoon, somewhere between European and Oriental in appearance.  His white hair was thick over the top of his head, with horns parting to either side and lining his neck and tail.  His wings were thin but wide, and his tail ended in a tuff of hair.  His body was colored a tannish yellow unlike the greenish blue of Aqua's, and all his hair seemed to blow in wind even though there was none.</p>

<p>Frosts wounds were so deep that Tom could feel the body being unresponsive.  There was a lot of blood and hit points lost there, and he could not put up an resistance when Aqua wrapped an arm around Frost's body.  Blaze was even worse for the wear, it was true.  Twister had to wrap his form around Blaze just enough to be able to lift up the fire red dragon.</p>

<p>Aqua and Twister gave slight nods to all the assembled foes and kicked off and into the air.  They looked at each other, then to the dragons they held up in their arms, heading in the direction of the mountainside just west of the castle near by.</p>

<p>"Thank you for the help, fellow dragons," Frost said, trying to make everything sound friendly being the only Force Dragon present.  "We thought perhaps we would be spending time beneath the earth tonight."</p>

<p>"You may still spend time beneath the earth tonight," Aqua said, nodding his head in the direction of the mountainside.  "We expect your gratitude to be great," he said.</p>

<p>"What is it you want of us?" Blaze asked groggily as the ability to speak became more a chore the longer without healing.</p>

<p>"Let's just say we could have let you and your Force sister die for your stupidity," Twister noted, "But we decided that two young and strong females such as yourselves deserved better than die by the hands of some lowly humans."</p>

<p>Frosts head shot up in Twister's direction.  "Sisters?" Tom asked Daniel in teamspeak so that the other two dragon's couldn't hear.  "We're playing girls?"</p></p>
