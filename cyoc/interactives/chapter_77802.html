<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After which I saw a boy just like me...<br />
<br />
Tom’s breath came quick and short with excitement, and his eyes grew big with wonder and delight. Everything<br />
gave way in his mind instantly to one desire: that was to get close to the prince, and have a good, devouring<br />
look at him. Before he knew what he was about, he had his face against the gate-bars. The next instant one<br />
of the soldiers snatched him rudely away, and sent him spinning among the gaping crowd of country gawks and<br />
London idlers. The soldier said,— “Mind thy manners, thou young beggar!”<br />
<br />
The crowd jeered and laughed; but the young prince sprang to the gate with his face flushed, and his eyes<br />
flashing with indignation, and cried out,— “How darest thou use a poor lad like that? How darest thou use the King my father’s <br />
meanest subject so? Open the gates, and let him in!”<br />
<br />
You should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats then. You should have heard them cheer, and<br />
shout, “Long live the Prince of Wales!” The soldiers presented arms with their halberds, opened the gates, and presented again <br />
as the little Prince of Poverty passed in, in his fluttering rags, to join hands<br />
with the Prince of Limitless Plenty.<br />
<br />
Jeff said— “Thou lookest tired and hungry: thou has been treated ill. Come with me.” Half a dozen attendants sprang forward to—<br />
I don’t know what; interfere, no doubt. But they were waved aside with a right royal gesture, and they stopped stock still <br />
where they were, like so many statues. Edward took Tom to a rich apartment in the palace, which he called his cabinet. By his <br />
command a repast was brought such as Tom had never encountered before except in books.<br />
<br />
The prince, with princely delicacy and breeding, sent away the servants, so that his humble guest might not be embarrassed by <br />
their critical presence; then he sat near by, and asked questions while Tom ate.<br />
“What is thy name, lad?”<br />
“Tom Canty, an’ it please thee, sir.”<br />
“’Tis an odd one. Where dost live?”<br />
“In the city, please thee, sir. Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane.”<br />
“Offal Court! Truly ’tis another odd one. Hast parents?”<br />
“Parents have I, sir, and a grand-dam likewise that is but indifferently precious to me, God forgive me if it be offence to say <br />
it—also twin sisters, Nan and Bet.”<br />
“Then is thy grand-dam not over kind to thee, I take it?”<br />
“Neither to any other is she, so please your worship. She hath a wicked heart, and worketh evil all her days.”<br />
“Doth she mistreat thee?”<br />
“There be times that she stayeth her hand, being asleep or overcome with drink; but when she hath her judgment clear again, she <br />
maketh it up to me with goodly beatings.”<br />
A fierce look came into the little prince’s eyes, and he cried out—<br />
“What! Beatings?”<br />
“Oh, indeed, yes, please you, sir.”<br />
“Beatings!—and thou so frail and little. Hark ye: before the night come, she shall hie her to the Tower. The King my father”—<br />
“In sooth, you forget, sir, her low degree. The Tower is for the great alone.”<br />
“True, indeed. I had not thought of that. I will consider of her punishment. Is thy father kind to thee?”<br />
“Not more than Gammer Canty, sir.”<br />
“Fathers be alike, mayhap. Mine hath not a doll’s temper. He smiteth with a heavy hand, yet spareth me: he spareth me not <br />
always with his tongue, though, sooth to say. How doth thy mother use thee?”<br />
“She is good, sir, and giveth me neither sorrow nor pain of any sort. And Nan and Bet are like to her in this.”<br />
“How old be these?”<br />
“Fifteen, an’ it please you, sir.”<br />
“The Lady Elizabeth, my sister, is fourteen, and the Lady Jane Grey, my cousin, is of mine own age, and comely and gracious <br />
withal; but my sister the Lady Mary, with her gloomy mien and—Look you: do thy sisters forbid their servants to smile, lest the <br />
sin destroy their souls?”<br />
“They? Oh, dost think, sir, that THEY have servants?”<br />
The little prince contemplated the little pauper gravely a moment, then said “And prithee, why not? Who helpeth them undress at<br />
night? Who attireth them when they rise?”<br />
“None, sir. Would’st have them take off their garment, and sleep without—like the beasts?”<br />
“Their garment! Have they but one?” <br />
“Ah, good your worship, what would they do with more? Truly they have not two bodies each.”<br />
“It is a quaint and marvellous thought! Thy pardon, I had not meant to laugh. But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have raiment <br />
and lackeys enow, and that soon, too: my cofferer shall look to it. No, thank me not; ’tis nothing. Thou speakest well; thou <br />
hast an easy grace in it. Art learned?”<br />
“I know not if I am or not, sir. The good priest that is called Father Andrew taught me, of his kindness, from<br />
his books.”<br />
“Know’st thou the Latin?”<br />
“But scantly, sir, I doubt.”<br />
“Learn it, lad: ’tis hard only at first. The Greek is harder; but neither these nor any tongues else, I think, are hard to the <br />
Lady Elizabeth and my cousin. Thou should’st hear those damsels at it! But tell me of thy Offal Court. Hast thou a pleasant <br />
life there?” <br />
“In truth, yes, so please you, sir, save when one is hungry. There be Punch-and-Judy shows, and monkeys— oh such antic <br />
creatures! and so bravely dressed!—and there be plays wherein they that play do shout and fight till all are slain, and ’tis so <br />
fine to see, and costeth but a farthing—albeit ’tis main hard to get the farthing, please your worship.”<br />
“Tell me more.”<br />
“We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the cudgel, like to the fashion of the ‘prentices, sometimes.”<br />
The prince’s eyes flashed. Said he— “Marry, that would not I mislike. Tell me more.” <br />
“We strive in races, sir, to see who of us shall be fleetest.”<br />
“That would I like also. Speak on.”<br />
“In summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in the river, and each doth duck his neighbour, and splatter him with <br />
water, and dive and shout and tumble and—”<br />
“’Twould be worth my father’s kingdom but to enjoy it once! Prithee go on.”<br />
“We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside; we play in the sand, each covering his neighbour up; and times we make mud <br />
pastry—oh the lovely mud, it hath not its like for delightfulness in all the world!— we do fairly wallow in the mud, sir, <br />
saving your worship’s presence.”<br />
“Oh, prithee, say no more, ’tis glorious! If that I could but clothe me in raiment like to thine, and strip my feet, and revel <br />
in the mud once, just once, with none to rebuke me or forbid, meseemeth I could forego the crown!”<br />
“And if that I could clothe me once, sweet sir, as thou art clad—just once—”<br />
“Oho, would’st like it? Then so shall it be. Doff thy rags, and don these splendours, lad! It is a brief happiness, but will be <br />
not less keen for that. We will have it while we may, and change again before any come to molest.”<br />
<br />
A few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was garlanded with Tom’s fluttering odds and ends, and the little Prince of <br />
Pauperdom was tricked out in the gaudy plumage of royalty. The two went and stood side by side before a great mirror, and lo, a <br />
miracle: there did not seem to have been any change made! They stared at each other, then at the glass, then at each other <br />
again. At last the puzzled princeling said—<br />
“What dost thou make of this?”<br />
“Ah, good your worship, require me not to answer. It is not meet that one of my degree should utter the thing.”<br />
“Then will I utter it. Thou hast the same hair, the same eyes, the same voice and manner, the same form and stature, the same <br />
face and countenance that I bear. Fared we forth naked, there is none could say which was you, and which the Prince of Wales. <br />
And, now that I am clothed as thou wert clothed, it seemeth I should be able the more nearly to feel as thou didst when the<br />
brute soldier—Hark ye, is not this a bruise upon your hand?”<br />
“Yes; but it is a slight thing, and your worship knoweth that the poor man-at-arms—”<br />
“Peace! It was a shameful thing and a cruel!” cried the little prince, stamping his bare foot. “If the King— Stir not a step <br />
till I come again! It is a command!”<br />
<br />
In a moment he had snatched up and put away an article of national importance that lay upon a table, and was out at the door <br />
and flying through the palace grounds in his bannered rags, with a hot face and glowing eyes. As soon as he reached the great <br />
gate, he seized the bars, and tried to shake them, shouting— “Open! Unbar the gates!”<br />
<br />
The soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly; and as the prince burst through the portal, half-smothered with royal <br />
wrath, the soldier fetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him whirling to the roadway, and said—<br />
“Take that, thou beggar’s spawn, for what thou got’st me from his Highness!”<br />
<br />
The crowd roared with laughter. The prince picked himself out of the mud, and made fiercely at the sentry, shouting—<br />
“I am the Prince of Wales, my person is sacred; and thou shalt hang for laying thy hand upon me!”<br />
<br />
The soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said mockingly— “I salute your gracious Highness.” Then angrily— “Be<br />
off, thou crazy rubbish!”</p>
