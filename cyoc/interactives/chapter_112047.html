<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martin shivered in anxiety, feeling the incredible sense of dread and regret taking over him as he stood paralysed in fear and worry. Not knowing what to do next, he just slowly crept out of the locker room, body knowing that he needed to get out before that huge &#39;homophobe hunk&#39; returns. Though it was an understatement to call him just that.<br />
<br />
In fact, he was the perfect specimen, an alpha male. He longed for muscles like those but could never seem to get em despite working on them for ages. Sadly sighing away, as he made his way to the entrance solemnly, intending to leave for good...<br />
<br />
...<br />
....<br />
.......<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin snapped out of his regretful daze, he barely made any progress in his way out. In fact, he seemed to be at one spot no matter how much he burned off with cardio, like he was on a treadmill...<br />
<br />
...<br />
...<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
He simply responded, noticing his feet walking on the treadmill in a pair of black and white laced sports shoes, supported by a pair of soles made for running and socks barely reaching the top of his ankles. Both being labelled with a signature knock off logo that screams cheapness yet good enough for training.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha...&quot; He giggled slowly, and heavily. Thoughts and fear slowing down progressively as his feet continued to move to the treadmill, unknowingly getting used to the routine speed walk. <br />
<br />
&quot;How much is this ah?&quot; His voice casually and groggily spoke, sounding so laid back in contrast to what his normal anxious tone would be like. As he peered into the speed meter and--<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! So slow!&quot;<br />
<br />
Saying that, as the machine cranked up the speed to his expectations. Legs jogging greatly as a result of a boost in confidence to his system. &quot;7mph, you&#39;ve got this man!&quot;<br />
<br />
8mph, 9mph, his pacing kept increasing as the machine sped up. His formerly preppy feet gained more rough edges to them as they thickened with the capability and training through the fields. &quot;Hah! So easy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Overconfidence soaring through the roof, 10mph , 13 mph, and so on as his overconfidence SKYROCKETED THROUGH THE ROOF with his huge thighs and leg muscles forming a tough man&#39;s outline and THICKENED like they oughta, feeling prouder than ever like he&#39;s achieved his goal and more AND---<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, weights next.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stopping the running process abruptly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I want huge biceps.&quot; He spoke, casually as worries of whatever just became non existent, like his pride was more important than ever.<br />
<br />
While he did have strong, toned leg muscles, they barely jumped in height. In fact, it seemed as though with all the muscle gain, he DROPPPPEDD to a hefty 5ft 3. Not feeling the shame as he walked , understandably , to the weight station. <br />
<br />
His muscles were a priority after all. Khakis reaching down like a pair of jeans they are, not showing off his muscle gain like he wanted. <br />
<br />
Giving a tight slap to his butt, a lycra rubbery material instead of normal fabric, tightly expanding around his waist with his harder hips and BUTT! <br />
<br />
&quot;Man...this going to be easy.&quot; He smiled easily, wiping the sweat off his brow momentarily before brushing off the dust collected on his pair of lycra sports shorts. <br />
<br />
Black with a red stripe and similar logo on the side, supporting his hard-earned tosh with ease and protein shakes, groin pressing against the front underneath tight white undies as he reached for the 10kg Dumbbells with--<br />
<br />
&quot;Ughhh&quot;<br />
<br />
First grunt. The short man curved up his biceps in repetition , pulling up those weights with a tiny smirk but intense heat. He kept doing it repeatedly over 10 reps, and for each time he lifted those weights, its almost as though time flies by through years.<br />
<br />
LIFT! With a STOCK, growing up with muscle on his arms to complement his legs, inflating like a balloon with every curl--CURLLLLLLL---POP! His biceps inflated to the size of balls.<br />
<br />
Of course he&#39;s got balls! He&#39;s a man of course! No time for pussy shit as he set down the weights momentarily, mocking for a challenge. <br />
<br />
Fists clenching tightly on those new set of heavier 15kg barbells as the rough edges brushed against his palms, feeling the tension as he momentarily squinted, before letting loose for 10 seconds and allowing a supernatural adjustment to those fists. <br />
<br />
Growing meatier, rougher, more gym oriented as a growing man in muscle. He gripped the weights once more, braving through the tension as he continued to lift them up above his below average height. He oughta be proud of himself!<br />
<br />
With that thought, he pulled the weights all the way down, directly brushing against his knees as he remained straight and tall with a LIFFFFTTTTT back up to above his height, as high up as his heavy and muscle oriented arms could carry. Too bad they&#39;re as short as his ten reps.<br />
<br />
Doing the same process as he stretched his back muscles this time. Enjoying the contraction and relaxation as he remained firm and short. Reduced height compensating him with---<br />
<br />
MUSCLE! As his back flexes every time the weights go above his shoulders. Widening to the best of his genetic capability, but LARGE AND TONED LIKE HE OUGHTA BE!<br />
<br />
With a GRUNT! &quot;UGHH!&quot; He shouted, as any muscle restriction let loose as his back went wild and TONED! Feeling every inch of his rippling shoulders and back muscle as they just TEAAAARRRRRRRR apart those polo sleeves like nobody&#39;s business, popping buttons out like they&#39;ve never existed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ughhhhhh....MORE!&quot; He let those down, feeling a brief unsatisfactory gains to his bod. He wanted a CHALLENGE! Not some easy shit from his daily routine.<br />
<br />
With that thought, the man slid down under the  fitness bench, adjusting so that his head is just right around and past the 30k wide weight above him and---<br />
<br />
LIFFFFTTTTTTT!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh....UGH!&quot; He grunted in frustration, man this is heavier than his pecs thought, air pushing through back and forth past his lungs and diaphragm, surging in as he took a DEEP BREATH and---<br />
<br />
PECS EXPLODING INTO THOSE TIGHT SPOTS, DOING THE PEC BOUNCE AS HIS FABRIC OF THE SHIRT TIGHTLY PRESSED AGAINST HIS washboard abs~ WITH A poppopopopPOP! LIKE POPCORN! Not that his healthy tight ass would ever eat that shit.<br />
<br />
Sweating like buckets, melting and crusting away his skin with a foreign and CRISP yellowish tan, like he&#39;s an Asian off the eastern sea, Malaysian? His body and attire surely agreed, as his shirt completely shortened and lax~ and lazy~ itself to a black tank top, hugging his tight ass bod like how he&#39;d want a---<br />
<br />
BZZT!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Time for break!&quot;<br />
<br />
He easily said, lifting those heavy weights down with ease unlike the lift moments ago. He rolled his tough shoulders backward, and cracked his neck, feeling the toughness and a manly sensation echoing from within as.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! You better be fucking checking this out!!! Hahahaha such losers!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heheh!&quot; He chucked easily, feeling dumbness and asian memories running through him, after hanging out with tons of bros, of course the shit they send is gonna be funny--<br />
<br />
but not before he takes a selfie!<br />
<br />
As he unlocked his phone, pressing the lock-pad numbers without a cinch. 687253, typing in the numerical digit for &quot;muscle&quot; like the musclehead he is.<br />
<br />
He immediately tapped on the photo app, as his meaty fingers shift back and forth clumsily. Not even noticing that his other apps have been shifted as well to fitness and workout. And not to mention digital playboy-<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yEAh! The CHICKS gOnna lovE this!&quot; He accented, sounding so foreign and asian with a deep but Chinese pitch that ends of not-so-deep at certain vowels. Hair bristles turning pure dark brown, asian black.<br />
<br />
He swoosh back his hair like a douchebag, pushing it back and puffing and feeling it like it already had gel existing on it as it shaved off on the sides and solidified on the top, a modern pompadour. It felt hard, just like how he&#39;s doing down there.<br />
<br />
His face rearranged itself to give it a thicker, more oval and homely type experience. Being used to nature and villages for a while when he&#39;s younger and before he went to USA. It gave him a ovalish jaw-prominent looking nose with tiny beady eyes that represent his heritage and nationality.<br />
<br />
He gave it a good duckface, proud of his sexy self and sent it to Insta---CLICK ON THIS DUDE! HAHAHAHAHA WHAT A FAG! <br />
<br />
As soon as Martin tapped on his insta and posted his photo, another message popped up, now this time from his other bro back home. Though it wasn&#39;t the bro that startled him, it was the word...<br />
<br />
&quot;Fag huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as he said that, feelings of disgust breached his entire self. Memories of going to places with his own personal gay cliche just well...BECAME TOUGH ASS MEN. Getting beating up because he was---HE BEAT UP GAYS! DUH! THAT&#39;LL SHOW EM!<br />
<br />
Ma Ting stupidly followed the link to one guy&#39;s insta and responded &quot;NO HOMO ALLOWED!&quot; to that guy, and then responded more verbal insults to INSULT others cause he was like that, a homophobe, homophobic Gym jock.<br />
<br />
Laughing stupidly as he typed away in the text to his bro group, before changing topic and talking about some hot ass girl he saw in the gym. <br />
<br />
Gong Ma Ting was really one of those buff asian guys who actually got those gains despite being lazy, BETTER THAN GUYS ON ROIDS! He would always say.<br />
<br />
Sure he wasn&#39;t the brightest one in terms of personality, but the gong family was always the smartest and very clever in things. Which is why he managed to get so strong and also be able to study in a University in USA---<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT! You didn&#39;t know bro?Heheheh! Im owning the class.&quot; Being an asshole like he doesn&#39;t care, that&#39;s the reality of gong&#39;s life. <br />
<br />
Sure a lot of people didn&#39;t like him, plus he was short for pete&#39;s sake, and stocky...well buff. But he had his bros to back him up, and that&#39;s all his dumb asian ass mind matters.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHOA! BABE SPOTTED!&quot; His mind thought loudly and rowdily internally, as he noticed a girl with a tight ass walking out, immediately creeping up closer to her, taking hold of his camera and SNAP!ing a pic of her like the pervert he is.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heheheheh, SCORE!&quot;</p>
