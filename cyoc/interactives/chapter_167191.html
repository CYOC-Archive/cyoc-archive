<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was thinking of what to do with Aidan. He could change him however he wanted, and looking at him gave him an idea. But that would need a few extra people for it to look good, Mark decided. So, with a grin, he let the chronivac scan further, and found in the neighbor’s flat were three people. “Perfect” thought Mark as he added his “Mark rules” comment to their profile. With another text input, he gave one of the three, Geoff, the mental nudge to look for Aidan and bring the others over with him.<br />
Aidan didn´t know what to make out of Marks look. Beside the longer Mark thought about what to do with Aidan, the smaller the chance got he would just be himself afterwards. And what was he typing that long on the laptop?<br />
Mark than smiled about his idea. Oh, Aidan will hate it at first, that’s for sure. And the others most likely, too. While they waited for the others to arrive, not that Aidan would know right now, Mark started with his first command for him: “First I want you to strip out of the rest of your clothes, so I see the base for your predicament.”<br />
Aidan turned red in embarrassment for the stripping, but also feared what Mark had planned. His socks, jeans and underwear fell on the already discarded shirt right next to him as he stood now naked before Mark.<br />
Mark grinned at Aidan´s earlier mistake, thinking it was Aidan´s normal gear down there. But before he could say more, the doorbell rang. Aidan´s eyes widened, for what Mark wasn´t sure. Was it embarrassment someone could see him like this? Or hope to be rescued from Mark? Mark stood and moved to let his other prey in. <br />
Aidan was begging for Mark to not open the door. He would die from embarrassment if someone saw him now, frozen naked in his flat. He was sure Mark had made sure whoever it was would be under his control, so there was no hope of rescue, only fear for whoever it was.<br />
Mark opened the door and smiled at the three visitors. Geoff looked a bit confused at him and asked: “Huh? Who are you?” It didn´t stop Mark from smiling as he answered: “I´m Mark, a friend of Aidan. I guess you are here for him, come in. He is over in the living room.”<br />
Geoff, Mitch and Jeremy came in, feeling compelled to do what Mark said. Mark closed the door behind them, and all three stopped dead in their tracks seeing Aidan stand in the room naked, facing away from them. “What the hell, Aidan, why are you naked?” came Jeremy´s surprised question.<br />
Seeing as they didn´t move closer, Mark answered with a new command: “Oh, I ordered him to. Now go in, stand beside him and stop talking until asked to do so.” Much to the three´s confusion, and maybe shock, the did as they were tasked. Geoff stood to Aidan´s right, while Jeremy stood to Aidan´s left side, with Mitch next to him.<br />
Aidan´s eyes were near falling out as he recognized who had come in, and screamed at them to run away mentally, but as they moved to stand beside him, he realized also that they were already under Mark´s control and started crying a bit.<br />
Mark took his place at the laptop again, smiling at Aidan´s tears and the others shocked faces. Then he ordered: “Now, it´s unfair for Aidan to be the only one naked, so you three will strip your clothes off, too.” Grinning wide he watched as Geoff, Jeremy and Mitch begun to strip off their clothes, dropping them on top of Aidan´s on the ground. All three were now as red as Aidan from the embarrassment, and looked at Mark in shock. How was he doing this?<br />
When all clothes were on the floor, Mark´s grin did increase, if that was even possible. “Now, for what I want you doing next, I need you to grow fully erect, but for now none of you will be able to cum, only moan in pain or pleasure. As Aidan´s cock is a bit small, it will grow to a matching size to the other three´s cocks.” That resulted in each of them turning even redder in their embarrassment, even when Aidan deep down was happy that his cock grew bigger. But he could already guess that Mark didn´t do that with good intentions.<br />
“Now, as you stay there, this would be a boring picture, so let´s pep it up somewhat. Aidan, you will turn to look at Jeremy, while Geoff will move behind you, impaling your ass with his cock. He will, at the same time, lick you at your neck for raising the pleasure for you. But he will place his feet on top of yours, leaving his whole weight on top of them.” Mark explained with a slightly evil grin. Both Aidan´s and Geoff´s eyes widened in fear, but they couldn´t stop themselves from moving. Aidan would have screamed in pain as Geoff pressed into him unprepared, but only a moan was heard. He nearly didn´t notice as Geoff stood on top of his feet. As Geoff was a bit taller than Aidan, he had to bow a bit to lick his neck like ordered. Jeremy and Mitch looked also horrified at their friends, not knowing what Mark would do next.<br />
Mark laughed at them, that was even better than he hoped, as he felt his own pants tent a bit. But he wasn´t finished with his plan, so he continued: “Now that Aidan´s ass is dealt with, let´s deal with the next point. Jeremy, you will now kneel on top of Geoff´s feet above Aidan´s and start to suck on his cock, even licking and chewing a bit on its base. Wrap your arms around Aidan´s and Geoff´s legs and with your hands you will tickle and knead his balls. And Geoff, your body will shrink smaller until you don´t need to bow down to lick Aidan´s neck.”<br />
This wasn´t getting better for the four young men. Aidan, while the pain from being impaled by Geoff had subdued, was already horny to the brim, and someone sucking on his cock would only increase that further. If he could, he would already shoot his load, but Mark had not allowed that. He didn´t even feel the added weight of Jeremy as he knelt down on Geoff´s and his feet, only moaning in pleasure. <br />
Geoff wasn´t better. The tightness of Aidan´s ass was to much for him to deal with, and he, too, would already have shot his load if he could. A slight shiver run down his spine as his torso and neck shrunk shorter, until his mouth was on the right height for him to lick on Aidan´s neck, moaning into it like crazy.<br />
Jeremy was horrified as he dropped to his knees, placing them on top of Geoff´s feet, before wrapping his arms around the outside of Aidan´s and Geoff´s legs, which stabilized his body as a side-effect. Then he grabbed Aidan´s balls and started kneading them. At the same time his mouth connected to Aidan´s cock and took it in all the way to its base, hitting his own throat in the process. It was painful to him, and if he couldn´t breath through his nose right now he would surely suffocate. Adding to that was the taste of Aidan´s cock, which he was forced to lick and chew on.<br />
Now Mark grinned evilly at the last man standing beside his friends, Mitch. He was the last to integrate into the picture before him. “Now, let´s get you in as well, right Mitch? You will now climb on Jeremy´s shoulders, pressing your cock in his hair. Then you will kiss Aidan on his lips and wrap your arms around him and Geoff´s neck. That will lock Geoff in place, as you will be stroking Aidan´s hair. Your legs will wrap around their legs as well, your feet resting beside Jeremy´s cock.”<br />
Mitch couldn´t stop himself from doing exactly that. Jeremy moaned in pain as Mitch climbed on him, and wasn´t happy with Mitch´s cock on top of his well-kept hair. Mitch moved forward and locked lips with Aidan, locking Geoff´s head to Aidan´s neck with his arms on top to stroke Aidan´s messy hair. His underarms had grown a bit longer to do so. His legs also got a bit longer as they encircled Aidan´s and Geoff´s legs, as well as Jeremy´s arms, before his feet planted themselves right beside Jeremy´s cock on his tights.<br />
With their positions found, Aidan and Geoff were moaning in pleasure, Jeremy moaned in pain, and Mitch was silent. But Mark had some little things to change left. “Now, let´s get your posing finished. Jeremy, you will now raise your legs up until your feet stabilize your own ass by pressing into it. That will leave all your combined weight on Aidan´s feet alone, but you will be unable to tip over. Geoff, you will wrap your arms around both Aidan´s and Mitch´s body, and your hands will reach between their bodies and fondle with Aidan´s nipples. Mitch, your cock will grow longer until its tip connects to Aidan´s navel and press a bit into it. Also, your tongue will be more like a second cock, which will go through yours and Aidan´s parted lips and down his throat.”<br />
They didn´t even realize their changes this time. Aidan was to horny to feel the high pressure from their combined weight on his feet, and when Mitch´s cock-tongue slipped down his throat he gagged at it, but it didn´t stop the pleasure his body felt. Jeremy felt helpless as his legs bend up and pressed into his own ass, while still sucking onto Aidan´s cock. He was so firmly pressed into Aidan´s groin that he had small problems breathing. Geoff closed his arms around the others, they had grown longer so he could reach around Mitch´s back and in between them to fondle with Aidan´s nipples. Mitch´s cock pressed down onto Jeremy´s hair until it left his head and shot right into Aidan´s navel from there, pressing painfully into it. <br />
Seeing Jeremy was the only one moaning more in pain then the others, Mark added another little point to Mitch. “Mitch, your feet will move towards each other and cover Jeremy´s cock and balls. Then your feet will stroke his cock, so to not leave him out in the pleasure. Also, Jeremy, your feet will vibrate to pleasure your own ass additionally.”<br />
Jeremy would have yelped as pressure hit his cock from its sides, only for it to change into lustful moans as Mitch´s feet started to work on it. Adding his vibrating feet, tickling his ass by that way, raised him into pleasure levels near the other three men. <br />
Mark grinned at their pleasured moans, but one last thing had to be done to them. “Let´s finish your fate. All four of you will turn into life-like looking marble statues in the positions you are in now. While completely unable to move or make a sound, you will still feel what´s done by the others as if they were still moving. And while you still can´t cum, you will feel as if you did, and every spot the cum would reach will feel as if it did so. Your minds will be linked, so you will be able to feel what the others feel. To the world you four have never existed as living humans, and what belonged to you will be mine now, and I can decide what to do with it. Also, nobody questions me for where this statue came from.”<br />
Deep down all four reacted to this with a scream of “No”, as their fate was sealed for now. Each body stiffened further and further until it was unmovable for them. To the outside their bodies had become marble, while on the insides the four of them were now trapped. Suddenly they felt the others minds link to them, hearing their collective “No” screams echo through all of them. <br />
Aidan moaned still, but only mentally. For himself he felt as if every spot of his body was stimulated at the same time. His hair and head were stroked, his neck was licked, his nipples fondled with and his balls were kneaded. His mouth, navel and ass were filled with cocks, each dripping imaginary cum. Some down his throat, some up his ass, and some sprayed against his navel and flowing down his belly. Adding the sucking of his own cock with additional licking and chewing on it made him incredible horny, and even with the feeling of cum leaving his cock, the pressure in it made him go mad on the inside.<br />
Geoff felt incredible horny as well, moaning inside his head. From himself he felt his working on both Aidan´s neck with his tongue, as well as the fondling with his nipples through his hands. But terrible for him was the pulsing feeling of his cock deep inside Aidan´s tight ass. He felt the imaginary cum flow out, filling Aidan and tickling his own cock, but there was no release of it for him.<br />
Jeremy by now was as horny as Geoff and Mitch, but less than Aidan, and moaned to himself. He felt the stroking done by Mitch´s feet, sending waves of pleasure through him. He kneaded Aidan´s balls while sucking on his cock, chewing and licking it to increase Aidan´s pleasure, to his own disgust. Terrible to him was the feeling of the imaginary dropping cum on his head, flowing through his hair, as well as his own shooting out against Mitch´s feet, giving his own cock the feeling of being drowned in a pool of his own cum. Said cum was also never calm, as his vibrating feet against his ass shook the whole pool. And as it was only imaginary, he felt like his cock was bursting.<br />
Mitch was also moaning inside his own mind, horny as shit. The kiss he shared with Aidan was heavenly, added by his tongue-cock blasting imaginary cum down Aidan´s throat. He stroked Aidan´s hair and head with his fingers while doing the same with Jeremy´s cock through his feet. The pressure against his cockhead send him on the edge, where he couldn´t do anything as his cum was locked there. It didn´t help him that it felt as if cum run down his cock the whole time, and neither did the tickling from Jeremy´s hair against his balls.<br />
Satisfied, Mark deleted the “Mark rules” command from their profiles while locking them with a password before saving. Afterwards he lowered his own pants, which by now were painfully tented, and it took only a couple of strokes before he cummed all over his new statue, covering them in his white spunk. The only real cum they would ever feel again. When his glow was over, he cleaned himself, before sending his new statue home. He had added that they would absorb any liquid that was on them for more than two minutes, so his cum sunk into their flesh turned stone skin, further cementing them as his.<br />
The way they stood would allow him to use either Geoff´s, Jeremy´s or Mitch´s ass to fuck if he wanted to, but he had also enabled in their profiles that he could rearrange them. That way he could also use Aidan if he wanted to. Their original position would be what they stood like now, and if he said so they would return to it.<br />
Mark took some extra time to get their belongings ported to him to sort through it in what was former Aidan´s flat, before finally putting the laptop into its bag and left with it, never to return to that building. After all, why would he go there if nobody he knows live there?</p>
