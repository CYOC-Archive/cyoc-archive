<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian, scared to death was now on the busy sidewalk, running away and trying to hide from that giant rat who was chasing after him. He was panting very hard, almost out of breath when he finally took a pause, looking behind him to see if he was still in danger. It was not so warm and the fact he was barely 6 inches tall and naked, it was not easy to keep his heat. He heard a noise that seemed to be getting closer, not being able to immediately identify it. But after a while he realized that it was the sound of rollers on asphalt. Looking toward the noise&#39;s direction source, he saw a boy on his skateboard closing toward his position. <br />
<br />
The tiny naked man recognized the boy, that was Alex, a 13-year-old neighbour who lives in the house next to his. He always being a kind of weird kid, just a few friends, still playing with action figures, kind of geeky. Nevertheless, he was polite and very good at school. That day he was wearing beige cargo trousers and a red shirt with a blue tie. So he was probably coming back from his part-time job at the local youth centre.  Brian always thought he was a nice young fellow, kind of cute with his boyish face, blue eyes, and very short blond hair. But Brian was not so sure he wanted to reveal himself to that younger guy though.<br />
<br />
While he was puzzled to decide if he was trying to ask the boy for some help, he saw another guy passing by, so he hid under a burger wrapper as fast as he could. The other guy had not paid attention, but Alex saw that tiny creature ducking. Out of curiosity, the young teen stopped next to the wrapping box, and seeing a dead leafless tree branch, he picked it up and used it to lift the box. <br />
<br />
Brian was petrified seeing his shelter so effortlessly lifted, disclosing him. He yelled in panic when he looked up and saw the young giant face looking down at him.  It was not just because it was too cold for him that he was shivering, he was so afraid.<br />
<br />
&quot;SO COOL!&quot;, exclaimed the boy as he was reaching down at shrunken Brian with his hand.<br />
<br />
In no time, Brian felt that teen&#39;s fingers wrapping around his naked body and being lifted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t hurt me, Alex, I&#39;m Brian, your neighbour, I have shrunk, I just need help&quot;, Cried the tiny man<br />
<br />
The boy recognized him alright but had no idea what to do at the instant. However, it was out of the question to let anyone else see his lucky find. Without further delay, he opened his right cargo trousers pocket and gently shoved the tiny man safely inside. From Brian&#39;s perspective, it was very awkward to be held in a giant hand in his very birth suit. His skin was in contact with that huge warm flesh, witch was surreal but strangely comforting.  However, he freaked out a little when he found himself shoved in that huge pocket. When Alex withdrew his hand, his body has been rubbed a little, his tiny dick was accidentally stroked too. But the tiny man was almost in some kind of second state as if his brain had been turned off for its own good.<br />
<br />
Using his skateboard, the boy went back to his house. Inside the cargo pocket, it was not very shaky, but noisy because of the wheels on the asphalt. Obviously, Alex used his left foot to propulsive himself. Yeah, Brian was in the right pocket.  The light was very faint, it smelled a little like soap, and it was warm and kind of comfortable. Then the boy arrived home. He took his skateboard under his left arm and entered the house. It was more shaky because he was walking and not rolling anymore. But it didn&#39;t last very long.  Brian heard the kid talking to his dad for a little while before it started to shake again inside the pocket as Alex went upstairs to go to his bedroom.<br />
<br />
Brian was a little dozy when more light flooded inside the pocket right before he felt the giant hand picking him up again.  The boy was so gentle, his hand was so warm that for the tiny man, it was almost like a very comforting hug. Carefully, Alex laid his tiny man on his back on a fluffy towel he put on his desk.  Brian was, well sort of, intoxicated, or maybe it was something else, like when he just woke up after a dream, the threshold between fantasy and reality. Alex was simply looking down at him with a friendly smile, not saying a word. <br />
<br />
But after a little while, Brian came back to reality, and even though he almost forgot, he realized again he was naked. Without warning, Alex began to stroke his tiny man&#39;s body with his fingertip, which made the tiny guy feel very uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, can you tell me how you ended up like that and naked, Brian?&quot;, asked him while touching him a lot.<br />
<br />
The tiny man, blushing, hid his privates with his tiny hands.  He was not sure what to answer to that.  However, he needed help, like being carried to his house and finding a way to grow back.  But the boy was, if we may express it in that way, kind of hypnotized by the view of that tiny man, a perfect living action figure, well sort of. <br />
<br />
&quot;Listen up Alex, I can understand I&#39;m maybe the coolest thing you ever saw, but I&#39;m a real person who simply shrunk. So, I&#39;d need you to carry me to my place. A key is hidden behind the left light fixture porch near the patio door in my backyard.&quot;, said in a slightly annoyed tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well right,  I may help you, but first...&quot;, said the teen while still caressing the tiny man&#39;s every single limbs</p>
