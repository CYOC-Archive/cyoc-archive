<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning started differently than the previous one. Feeling anxious over what was to come, from Evan’s court hearing to preparing to home school him, Michael struggled to wake up. After a few minutes of tossing and turning in bed, Freddy briefly spoke up.<br />
<br />
“Would you mind staying in one place?” Freddy asked groggily. “Or get up and go downstairs. I’d like to get some more sleep before I have to get up for the day.”<br />
<br />
“Mmmm?” Michael moaned out in response. “Ok, Freddy. I’ll get up now.”<br />
<br />
Michael let out a loud yawn and stretched, before he left their bedroom to head downstairs. When he walked into the living room, he could see that the sofa bed was put back into the couch. <br />
<br />
“That means Chris is already up” Michael thought to himself, as he walked into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Standing by the toaster was Chris, this time fully clothed, save for his lack of shoes or socks. <br />
<br />
“Morning Mr. Scavolini” Chris said, as he waited for his toast to pop up from the toaster. “I was just making myself some toast. I’ll get out of your way so you can use the kitchen.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks Chris” Michael replied, as Chris moved from the counter so he could access it. “And thanks for remembering to put on a shirt this morning.”<br />
<br />
“No problem at all, Mr. Scavolini. The rules are the rules.”<br />
<br />
Michael nodded, as he took out some bread and got out some eggs from the fridge.<br />
<br />
“Making French toast?” Chris asked, as he watched Michael prepare his breakfast.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Chris” Michael replied. <br />
<br />
“You know, I have a really good way of making that if—“<br />
<br />
“I don’t need your assistance. Thanks anyway, Chris.”<br />
<br />
“Suit yourself.”<br />
<br />
Chris shrugged his shoulders, as his toast popped up from the toaster.<br />
<br />
“You have butter?” Chris asked. <br />
<br />
“It’s in the fridge” Michael replied.<br />
<br />
Chris grabbed the butter from the fridge, while Michael prepared to make French toast on the stove. A few minutes later, Evan came into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Morning dad” he said, as he went to give Michael a hug.<br />
<br />
“Morning Evan” Michael replied. “You’re in a surprisingly good mood today, considering what we’re dealing with.”<br />
<br />
“I’m just happy that you’re helping me deal with all of this.”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you appreciate it, Evan. I just wish Freddy did as well, considering he’s the reason I have to keep you home from now on. Speaking of which…”<br />
<br />
Freddy came into the kitchen, while Chris finished eating his toast.<br />
<br />
“Morning everybody” Freddy said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Freddy&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
“Morning papa” Evan replied, as he ran over to give him a hug. <br />
<br />
“Morning Evan. How is my boy doing today?”<br />
<br />
“Eh, ok. I’m just really nervous about court today.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, about that. Michael?”<br />
<br />
“Yes Freddy?”<br />
<br />
“I’m making a change of plans in my morning schedule. I’m going to be joining you and Evan in court today. I think this really needs to get the press’ attention, especially since there’s video out there now of the arrest.”<br />
<br />
“There is?” Evan asked curiously.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. It came out late last night.”<br />
<br />
While everyone in the household was asleep, one of Evan’s classmates posted a video they took of the arrest online. Within minutes, the video spread virally and was seen by over 4 million people. It brought new attention to Freddy’s campaign and restarted a national conversation about the issue of police brutality. The vast majority of the commentary was supportive of Evan, saying the targeted harassment for jaywalking was political and outrageous. It was an immediate vindicator of what Freddy was fighting for. This is why Freddy wanted to be there when Evan faced the judge today.<br />
<br />
“That’ll be good for when we’re in court today” Michael noted, as he finished making the French toast. “Can you get a copy of the video to submit to the judge?”<br />
<br />
“Sure” Freddy replied. “I’ll have my staff work on that before we arrive at the court house. Expect some reporters and photographers to be there as well. Evan?”<br />
<br />
“Yes papa” Evan replied nervously. <br />
<br />
“I want you to do your best to be brave today, ok? This is probably going to be one of the toughest days of your life. You have to do your best to stay calm and keep your emotions under control. Ok?”<br />
<br />
“Ok.”<br />
<br />
Evan and Freddy sat down at the table, while Michael served them the French toast.<br />
<br />
“How come you didn’t make any for Chris?” Freddy asked with his eyebrows raised.<br />
<br />
“I figured he made himself toast already” Michael replied “and so I didn’t need to make him anything.”<br />
<br />
“Michael, that was rude. You should have offered up a piece to Chris.”<br />
<br />
“It’s fine, Freddy” Chris replied, waving his hand dismissively. “Mr. Scavolini is right. I did already make myself breakfast. Besides, it’s not how I like my French toast anyway.”<br />
<br />
“How do you like your French toast?” Evan asked, as he dug into his meal.<br />
<br />
“Well, Evan, I like to leave the toast in the eggs for about 10 minutes or so, to let them soak in all the moisture. Then, I like to use butter on the pan, rather than vegetable oil, and give it a nice char on both sides. That way, it’s crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside.”<br />
<br />
“That sounds really delicious” Freddy remarked, as he ate his husband’s French toast.<br />
<br />
Michael frowned, which Chris took note of. <br />
<br />
“Of course” Chris added, wanting to be deferential to Michael “I’m sure how Mr. Scavolini makes his French toast is alright too. He’s a pretty good cook. You guys are lucky to have him around.”<br />
<br />
Michael let go of the frown he wore, but not did smile at Chris’ remark. Sighing, he dug into his French toast and ate along with the rest of his family.<br />
<br />
“You should cook for us again sometime” Evan said, just before he finished his breakfast.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to defer to your dad on this one” Chris replied. “My job is to protect you guys anyway, not be your personal chef.”<br />
<br />
“Come on, Dad. Please let Chris cook again sometime.”<br />
<br />
“Evan, don’t pressure you dad. He has a lot on his plate and if he wants to be in charge of the kitchen, then you really need to respect that.”<br />
<br />
Evan frowned, before he got up to leave the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“I appreciate you sticking up for me” Michael remarked, as he got up and took his and Evan’s plates into the sink.<br />
<br />
“I don’t” Freddy replied with a grumble, as he got up as well. <br />
<br />
“Listen Freddy” Chris said, as he joined them at the sink “it’s not that I don’t want to cook or don’t like to. It’s just that I want to do my best to keep things calm around here. We’re all dealing with some difficult challenges ahead and I want to do what will make everyone feel at home. This is your place and my job is to keep you safe in it.”<br />
<br />
“Michael, will you please get the stick out of your ass—“<br />
<br />
“Freddy, enough.”<br />
<br />
Michael smiled, as he washed the dishes. <br />
<br />
“Chris?” Freddy asked. “What the hell?”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, can I have a word with you please?”<br />
<br />
Freddy nodded, as he and Chris left the kitchen. When they walked into the living room, Chris whispered in his ear. <br />
<br />
“Can we talk privately in your room?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think that’s a good idea” Freddy responded. <br />
<br />
“I just would like to have a word with you without other people hearing us.”<br />
<br />
“What are you boys talking about in there?” Michael asked, as he finished cleaning the dishes in the kitchen sink.”<br />
<br />
“Mr. Scavolini” Chris replied. “I know this might be kind of a weird ask, but do you mind if I have a private word with your husband alone in your bedroom?”<br />
<br />
“Uh…”<br />
<br />
Michael walked out of the kitchen and into the living room towards Freddy and Chris.<br />
<br />
“What do you have to go into my bedroom to talk about?” Michael asked quizzically. <br />
<br />
“I need to have a man to man chat with your husband” Chris replied “and I would like to have it today. After we leave for court, I’m not going to have any other time to do it. It’ll take five minutes. We’re not going to do anything like what you might be thinking.”<br />
<br />
Michael groaned, before he held up his hands in resignation. <br />
<br />
“Find” he replied, as he slapped his hands on his knees. “Five minutes and then I’m coming up there. I have to get ready for court, so I’m going to need access to my bedroom.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Mr. Scavolini” Chris replied. “Freddy, after you.”<br />
<br />
Freddy hesitated for a moment, before he walked up with Chris to his bedroom. On the way up, they saw that Evan’s door was locked. <br />
<br />
“Evan” Freddy said, as he knocked on the door. “You need to get ready to go.”<br />
<br />
“I’m getting ready” Evan replied. <br />
<br />
“Did you shower yet?”<br />
<br />
“Not yet.”<br />
<br />
“You should work on doing that now” Chris replied. <br />
<br />
Evan opened his door and ran to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“Ok Chris” Evan said “as long as you promise me you’ll cook again soon.”<br />
<br />
Chris looked at Freddy, who gave him a nod. <br />
<br />
“I will talk to your dad about it and see if he’ll relent. I’m not going to disobey his rules if he doesn’t want me to do it.”<br />
<br />
Evan groaned, before he walked into the guest bathroom and closed the door to take a shower. <br />
<br />
“Did you shower yet?” Freddy asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes” Chris replied. “I just have to put on my dress clothes and then I’m ready to go. Now come on, let’s go inside your bedroom. We don’t have much time.”<br />
<br />
Freddy led Chris into his bedroom and closed the door behind him.<br />
<br />
“This is like the scene in a porn before the two guys hook up” Freddy said, as he let out a little chuckle.<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Chris replied sternly “focus here. It’s bad enough the two of us are alone together in your bedroom. We don’t need to say or do anything to upset Michael further.”<br />
<br />
Little did Chris and Freddy know that Michael had made his way upstairs a minute after they left the living room. He intended to stand by the door to listen to what they were talking about. Putting his ear to the bedroom door, he listened in on the conversation that was taking place. <br />
<br />
“Look, Freddy” Chris continued “we don’t have a lot of time, so I’d like to get to the point. You may think that Michael’s ground rules are a bit excessive and silly and slightly overbearing, but he has a right to set boundaries like this. This is his home, the home he shares with you. I’m a guest here and also your employee. You’re my boss and I think he’s right to want to establish a code of conduct between us.”<br />
<br />
“I think he’s being too rigid about this” Freddy replied in an exasperated tone. “No hugs? No shoulder pats? I mean, come on, it’s way over the line.”<br />
<br />
“You know why he’s putting these boundaries up. Don’t try to play dumb with me.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not playing dumb. I know why he’s doing it and I think he’s worrying unnecessarily.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” Why are you taking Michael’s side on this?”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, be honest with me. You have the hots for me, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
Freddy blushed, as Chris looked at him with a serious expression on his face. <br />
<br />
“Be honest, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Freddy continued to blush, before he sighed and spoke up.<br />
<br />
“I kind of think you’re hot” Freddy admitted. “But that doesn’t mean I’m going to try to put the make on you. I’m a loyal husband to Michael and I would never cheat on him.”<br />
<br />
“That may be so” Chris replied “but spouses always worry about infidelity, especially if it’s someone of the sex they are attracted to. I saw you staring at my hairy chest yesterday, Freddy. I have to be honest with you, man. If I had known you were going to ogle me like that, then I probably wouldn’t have taken this job if you could have found someone else to do it.”<br />
<br />
Michael gasped from the other end of the door. <br />
<br />
“Come on, Chris” Freddy said. “You don’t seriously believe I’m going to try to hook up with you, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
“You want me to be honest with you?” Chris asked. <br />
<br />
“Yes, Chris. I do.”<br />
<br />
“Honestly, I have no idea what you might do if we were alone together. Let’s say that, in the event that just sleeping downstairs isn’t enough, that I have to sleep in the bed with you guys to be absolutely sure I can immediately fend off an attacker. Do you think you’d be able to restrain yourself from trying to do stuff with me in your bed?”<br />
<br />
“Of course I would, Chris! How could you even say that about me? I love Michael very much. I would never do anything like that to harm him. The only reason I insisted that you had to sleep downstairs is because of how Michael would feel about you being in the bed with us.”<br />
<br />
Michael couldn’t believe what he had just heard Freddy say. <br />
<br />
“Wow” Michael thought to himself. “Freddy is really more considerate of my feelings than he lets on. He really just seemed so dismissive when it came to my feelings on Chris. It’s nice to know that he’s not totally ignoring my concerns.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sensitive to his concerns about that” Chris replied. “That’s a part of the reason why I don’t want to have to do it unless it’s absolutely necessary. But if it comes to the point where I need to sleep in your bed, I have to be able to trust you that you won&#39;t try to do anything with me in the bed. I’m a straight man, Freddy, and you’re a married man with a very good husband. You can’t do anything that goes beyond what is considered platonic. That’s why Michael is right to try to insist that we keep things professional between us.”<br />
<br />
Freddy sighed and fell totally silent. <br />
<br />
“Look Freddy” Chris continued “I’m not trying to be hard ass on you. You were my old friend for a while, until you stopped talking to me at Michael’s insistence. The reason we haven’t stayed in touch over the years is because of how I treated him and how you chose to cut me off. I really need to do a lot to prove to him that I am a changed man and not that kid that picked on him all those years ago. Will you please help me do that?”<br />
<br />
“How can I help you do that?” Freddy asked. <br />
<br />
“Just let him have his way on these ground rules and the things he insists on. It may seem uptight and rigid, which, admittedly, it is, but it’s what he feels comfortable with. I know you don’t like it, and yes, I admit, some of the rules drive me absolutely fucking nuts, but he feels better with them in place and I want to make sure he’s as comfortable as he can be with me being here in your house. Please just let Michael have his way on this. Besides the fact that you owe it to him as his husband, you should do it because I want you to.”<br />
<br />
Michael shed a tear from the other side of the door, as Chris’ defense of him hit him in the gut. <br />
<br />
“I can’t believe he really stuck up for me like that” Michael thought to himself. “I guess Evan was right about him. Chris really has changed.”<br />
<br />
Freddy sighed, before he spoke up. <br />
<br />
“I guess you’re right. I’ll respect his rules, but can you at least try to ask him to lay up on the cooking thing? Maybe he’ll agree to let you cook once a week.”<br />
<br />
“I can try” Chris replied “but I don’t want to push too hard, either.”<br />
<br />
Freddy nodded, as he extended his hand. <br />
<br />
“A Michael approve hand shake?” Freddy asked. <br />
<br />
Chris chuckled, as he extended out his hand to Freddy.<br />
<br />
“Of course” he replied. “A Michael approved hand shake.”<br />
<br />
The two of them shook hands, before they heard a knock on the door.<br />
<br />
“Are you guys done yet?” Michael called out from the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
“We’re done” Chris replied, as Freddy went to open the door.<br />
<br />
When Freddy saw Michael, he noticed a tear rolling down his cheek.<br />
<br />
“Michael?” Freddy asked nervously. “Are you ok?”<br />
<br />
“As ok as I can be” Michael replied, as he tried to smile. “I’m just a little nervous about Evan’s case, that’s all.”<br />
<br />
Freddy smiled, as he went in to hug him. Chris smiled, as he watched the two men embrace. <br />
<br />
“See, Freddy” Chris noted. “This is what I was telling you. You and Michael are a great couple.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks Chris” Michael replied, as he moved to push him out of his bedroom “but you have to leave now. I need to get ready to go.”<br />
<br />
“Of course. I’ll meet you guys downstairs.”<br />
<br />
Michael nodded, as Chris left their bedroom. Getting ready for their court date, Freddy and Michael got dressed, gathered their things together and prepared for the stressful day ahead. When they were ready, they made their way down the stairs to see that Chris and Evan were dressed and ready to go. The four of them stood together at the front door. <br />
<br />
“Ready Evan?” Freddy asked, as he put his hands on his son’s shoulders. <br />
<br />
“As ready as I can be” Evan replied nervously. <br />
<br />
“Let’s get to the car” Chris ordered. “Say nothing to the press. Let’s just focus on getting out of here without incident.”<br />
<br />
The three of them nodded, as Chris led them out the door. A horde of reporters and photographers hounded them while they made their way to Freddy’s car. Getting into the vehicle, Chris carefully pulled out of the driveway and made his way to court. <br />
<br />
When they arrived at the court house, Chris parked the car in the lot and escorted them to the court room. More reporters tried to ask Freddy and his family questions, but Chris pushed them away. When they got inside the court house, they found they were not the only ones in the court room gallery that day. Sitting there were the parents of the bullies from Evan’s school.<br />
<br />
“Your son must be the one who got my boy arrested” one of the father’s said to Freddy.<br />
<br />
Freddy ignored the comment, as he went to the defendant table with Evan. Michael sat down in the gallery with Chris. Noticing the parents of the bullies, Chris leaned into the father’s ear. <br />
<br />
“Listen, sir” Chris said. “You should see this experience today as a valuable lesson for your son.”<br />
<br />
“You have no right to pass judgement on my boy” the father replied indignantly. <br />
<br />
“I know a thing or two about being a bully.”<br />
<br />
“My son is not a bully. I don’t why you would suggest such a thing.”<br />
<br />
Before Chris could respond, the court was called to order. Led into the court room were Evan’s bullies, fuming as they were dragged while in handcuffs. <br />
<br />
“My son!” the father of one of the boy’s exclaimed. “This is a travesty!”<br />
<br />
“Quiet in the court” a court officer reprimanded. “The court is coming to order.”<br />
<br />
The people in the gallery stood, as the judge made his way into the chamber. It was the older gentleman who presided over Freddy’s hearing. <br />
<br />
“This isn’t good” Freddy thought to himself, as he looked at his son standing next to him.<br />
<br />
“All may be seated” the judge ordered. <br />
<br />
The people in the gallery sat, before the judge spoke again.<br />
<br />
“Alright, this isn’t how I expected to be spending my morning, but I’m just going to get this over with. Evan Benson-Scavolini. Please rise.”<br />
<br />
Evan gulped, before he stood up. <br />
<br />
“You are charged with the crime of resisting arrest. How do you plea?”<br />
<br />
“Not guilty, your honor” Evan replied.<br />
<br />
“Your honor” Freddy said, as he stood up. <br />
<br />
“Sit down, Mr. Benson” the judge reprimanded. “I know who you are.”<br />
<br />
“Your honor, I’d like to put some video footage into evidence.”<br />
<br />
The arresting officers entered the court room, glaring at Freddy as they did so. They sat down on the plaintiff side of the court room, along with the district attorney who was already seated there. <br />
<br />
“I don’t need you to put the footage into evidence” the judge replied. “I’ve already seen it. The whole world has seen it at this point, frankly. Your son is obviously not guilty of the crimes he has been accused of committing—“<br />
<br />
“Your honor” the district attorney interjected, as they stood up. “Objection.”<br />
<br />
“Overruled” the judge replied, as he banged his gavel. <br />
<br />
“Your honor—“<br />
<br />
“I said, overruled.”<br />
<br />
“Your honor, this is not proper procedure. Any evidence from the defendants needs to be admitted into evidence.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t have to admit it. I’ve already seen it and I’ve already made a decision on this.”<br />
<br />
“The mayor won’t be pleased to hear about this” one of the arresting officers said. <br />
<br />
“I don’t care what he thinks anymore” the judge replied sternly. “Quite frankly, I have had enough of that man. He’s lost his damn mind in trying to stop Freddy from defeating him next month. This arrest was blatantly an attempt to intimidate him into dropping out of the race. A summons for jaywalking? When have you ever heard of someone being given one of those before yesterday, Mr. District Attorney?”<br />
<br />
“Your honor” the defense attorney replied. “That’s not relevant here. Evan Benson-Scavolini was caught committing the offense of jaywalking and—“<br />
<br />
“Has your office ever seen a summons issued for the offense of jaywalking before Evan’s citation yesterday?”<br />
<br />
“That’s not—“<br />
<br />
“Answer my question.”<br />
<br />
“Your honor—“<br />
<br />
“That’s an order, Mr. District Attorney.”<br />
<br />
“Our office has no records of a previous jaywalking citation issued in this town in the last sixty years. However—“<br />
<br />
“Then this was clearly a targeted summons, especially since all those other school children did it in the officer’s visible vicinity and they said nothing to any of them. This was a politically motivated act and I won’t stand for it. I am throwing out Evan’s charges and dismissing his case. The rest of the cases against the other boys can proceed now. You are free to go home, young man.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, your honor” Evan said with a sense of relief, as he got up and followed his father back to the gallery. <br />
<br />
Seeing Chris standing up, Evan made his way over to hug him. <br />
<br />
“See, kid” Chris said, as he embraced him tightly. “I told you it would be ok.”<br />
<br />
Evan nodded, as he let go of Chris. Seeing his father looking sad, he ran over to Michael and gave him a hug. <br />
<br />
“Dad” Evan said, as he let out a tear in his eye. “It’s going to be ok now.”<br />
<br />
Michael gently patted his son’s back, before holding his hand and taking him back to the car. When they were walking to the vehicle, Freddy briefly stopped to chat with reporters. <br />
<br />
“I’d like to make a brief statement to the assembled media today” he spoke, as Michael and Evan walked away towards the car. <br />
<br />
“Can we ask your son a few questions?” a reporter asked. <br />
<br />
“You may not. Any discussions with my son are simply off limits. As I was saying, this court hearing today was a blatant example of what my campaign has been fighting for for the last nine months. This was a blatant example of political retaliation. Fortunately, the judge had the good sense and courage to defy the pressure by the mayor’s office in seeing these charges dismissed. Although this was done to scare me into dropping out, the result has been just the opposite. It has made me more determined than ever to stay in this race and see it through to the end. My campaign is only four points behind the incumbent mayor of this town in the polls and I believe I will overtake him come election day. I am not available to answer questions now, but will be happy to take phone interviews in just an hours time. Thank you all very much.”<br />
<br />
The cadre of reporters rushed towards Freddy with questions, as he made his way back to his car. Chris did his best to hold them at bay, but they were becoming increasingly overwhelming. Fortunately, in the nick of time, they made their way to Freddy’s car, where Michael and Evan were standing. Freddy let them all in and Chris carefully drove them away from the court house. <br />
<br />
Before Freddy was to go back to the office, he agreed to drop Michael and Evan back at the house. When they got there, the two of them got out of the car, before Chris drove Freddy back to the office. Making their way inside, Michael began preparations for his first day of home schooling his son.<br />
<br />
Across town, the mayor was having another fit of rage in his office. The news of the dismissal of Evan’s charges drove him to scream at the top of his lungs. <br />
<br />
“Son of a fucking bitch!!!!!!” the mayor yelled. “That judge royally fucked me over!!!!!! He cannot be allowed to get away with this!!!!! This was your bone headed plan to avoid me ordering another hit on that communist&#39;s life and it&#39;s blowing up in my face!!!!!!! All the instant polls are saying that the police department went too far and were targeting that brat to hurt the commie!!!!!! 75% blamed the officers and 25% blamed that fucking fat kid!!!!!! No one said that Evan was in any way, shape or form was responsible!!!!!!! There’s no way my poll numbers won’t suffer after this!!!!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
“Sir” an advisor said nervously “please calm down. You don’t want people to overhear this.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t give a fuck!!!!!!!!! I’ve had it with your boneheaded ideas!!!!!!!! I want Freddy killed tonight!!!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
“Sir, no—“<br />
<br />
“That’s an order!!!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
“I really think you need to reconsider this.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve had it with trying it your way!!!!!!!! I want him dead tonight!!!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
“Sir” another advisor spoke up “you can’t risk doing this so soon after a targeted arrest like this. If you order a hit now, then there’s no way you can avoid getting investigated for conspiracy to assassinate. You could face serious jail time for this, whether it works out in killing him or not.”<br />
<br />
“Just have him killed!!!!!!! Stop talking and just do it!!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
“Sir” a third advisor said. “Would you be willing to wait a few more days before we order another hit?”<br />
<br />
“There’s no time to wait!!!!!!! The race is less than three weeks away!!!!!! I need him gone now before it’s too late!!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
One of the advisors sighed, before he pulled out his communication device. The other advisors looked on nervously, as the man made another ominous call. <br />
<br />
“Sal” the advisor said on his communication device. “We need two men at Freddy’s tonight. Bulldozer and Cleanup.”<br />
<br />
Things were less fatalistic at Freddy and Michael&#39;s home that afternoon, even if it was stressful in its own unique way. Michael’s efforts to try homeschool his son were challenging, to say the least. Evan struggled to learn, while Michael struggled to teach him the material. After two hours of trying to explain various mathematical formulas, Michael sighed loudly.<br />
<br />
“Let’s take a break” he said in resignation, as he got up from the couch in the living room. “I’m going to make us some lunch now. Grilled cheese ok?”<br />
<br />
“Mmmhmm” Evan replied, as his dad prepared to cook in the kitchen. <br />
<br />
Seeing his father standing over the stove, Evan made his way into the kitchen. He sat down at the table and spoke up.<br />
<br />
“Dad. I want to tell you something.”<br />
<br />
“What is it, Evan?” Michael asked, as he put the sandwiches in a pan. <br />
<br />
“Dad, I know I don’t say it often enough, but I love you.”<br />
<br />
Michael paused for a moment, before he turned his head to see Evan sitting at the table. <br />
<br />
“Evan” he replied. “That’s so nice of you to say that.”<br />
<br />
“It’s true, dad. I love you very much. You’ve always been there for me when I was sick, when I needed help, when I needed a shoulder to cry on and when I was having fun. You went to all my graduations at school and all of my soccer games. You’ve always been there for me and I guess I don’t show my appreciation for you often enough.”<br />
<br />
“That’s so sweet of you to say all of that. It really means a lot to me. What prompted you into saying it, though?”<br />
<br />
“Your help with my court case today.”<br />
<br />
“I see.”<br />
<br />
“And also Chris.”<br />
<br />
Michael finished flipping over the sandwiches, before he looked at Evan again with a confused expression on his face. <br />
<br />
“Chris?” Michael asked. <br />
<br />
Evan nodded his head. <br />
<br />
“Chris had a talk with me yesterday. He said that I should do more to show my appreciation for you, considering how much you do for me. He said it would make you feel better if I told you how I felt for you.”<br />
<br />
Michael started to tear up, as Evan got up and gave him a hug, <br />
<br />
“I love you, dad” Evan said. “Chris may be a cool guy and all, but he’s not my dad. You’re my dad and I love you.”<br />
<br />
Michael began to sob, before he smelled something burning. <br />
<br />
“The sandwiches!” he exclaimed, before he grabbed some plates and put the sandwiches on them with a spatula. <br />
<br />
Michael brought the sandwiches over to the table and turned his sandwich over to the burnt end. <br />
<br />
“Sorry about that, Evan” Michael said apologetically. “I just got a little distracted by what you said just now. I have to admit, I really appreciate you saying all that stuff. You really can’t imagine what it means to me to hear you say that.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about the sandwich too much” Evan replied, as he saw the burnt end of his sandwich. “As long as it’s edible, then I’m good.”<br />
<br />
Michael chuckled, as he dug into his sandwich.<br />
<br />
“It’s just” Evan continued while he ate “you know.”<br />
<br />
Michael put his sandwich down and looked at his son nervously. <br />
<br />
“It’s just what?” Michael asked. <br />
<br />
“Well, maybe you could let up a little and let Chris cook for a change.”<br />
<br />
“Evan, I—“<br />
<br />
“Not all the time or anything. Just like maybe every once in a while.”<br />
<br />
“Was your ‘I love you, dad’ spiel just now a way to try to get me to let Chris cook for us again?”<br />
<br />
“Dad, no. It was just—“<br />
<br />
Michael got up and put his plate in the sink.<br />
<br />
“Dad, it wasn’t like that” Evan replied, as he got up and tried to hug him again. “I swear.”<br />
<br />
“Uh huh. Sure it wasn’t.”<br />
<br />
“Dad, I mean it. I wouldn’t have even brought it up, but you asked.”<br />
<br />
“It’s all about Chris in this household, isn’t it? Chris trying to manipulate my husband and my son to let him do things I’m not comfortable with.”<br />
<br />
“No dad, it’s not like that, I swear. Chris just said—“<br />
<br />
“Chris said what?”<br />
<br />
Michael angrily looked at his son, while Evan started to well up in tears.<br />
<br />
“Chris said I should let you know how I feel about you, that&#39;s all. He said I should show you how much I care about you after I told him how much you meant to me.”<br />
<br />
Michael stood silently, as he thought to himself for a moment. <br />
<br />
“So Chris wasn’t lying about that. Evan really did tell him that he loved me.”<br />
<br />
“Dad” Evan said, as tears fell from his eyes. “Please don’t be mad at me and please don’t be mad at Chris. I’m sorry I brought up the cooking thing. I should have just kept my big mouth shut about that.”<br />
<br />
Evan hugged Michael, who tentatively patted him on the head. <br />
<br />
“Please don’t be mad at me” Evan stressed again. “And please don’t be mad at Chris. He didn’t ask me to ask you to let him cook again. I just asked because he’s a good cook and you know that papa and I like what he makes.”<br />
<br />
Michael sighed, as he continued to pat his son’s head. <br />
<br />
“I’ll think about it” he replied. “Now come on. Let’s get back to work.”<br />
<br />
Evan nodded, gobbling down the remainder of his sandwich, before running back into the living room. Michael continued his attempts to try to home school him, but found that he wasn&#39;t successful. A few hours later, the front door of their home opened up and Freddy and Chris walked inside. <br />
<br />
“Papa” Evan said, as he looked up at Freddy. “You’re home early.”<br />
<br />
“I know” Freddy replied, as he went to kiss his son on the forehead. “I did what I had to at the office, so now I’m going to spend some time taking some phone interviews from home. I don’t need to be in the office to do that.”<br />
<br />
“We’ll try to be quiet” Michael said. “We’re almost done anyway.”<br />
<br />
“Chris?” Freddy said. <br />
<br />
“Yes, Freddy” Chris replied. <br />
<br />
“I’m going to take some phone interviews now, so I’d prefer you not be in my vicinity while I do so. I need some privacy to think and concentrate. Would you mind keeping an eye on my husband and son while I’m working?”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing, boss.”<br />
<br />
Freddy smiled, before he made his way upstairs. <br />
<br />
“I don’t want to be too much of a bother” Chris said, as he stood over Michael and Evan “so I’ll just grab a chair from the kitchen and keep an eye on you guys, if you don’t mind.”<br />
<br />
“You can sit on the couch with us” Michael replied, as he scooted over to make some room. “The two of us and Evan shouldn’t be too tight of a squeeze.”<br />
<br />
“You sure?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah Chris” Evan replied happily. “Come on. Sit next to me. Dad would probably prefer you weren’t next to him, anyway.”<br />
<br />
Michael chuckled, as Chris sat down next to Evan on the couch. <br />
<br />
“I hope it’s not too nosy of me to ask what you’re working on” Chris commented. <br />
<br />
“We’re finishing up with history” Michael replied. “It’s the last thing for the day.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t mind me then. I know you might find this hard to believe, but I like to learn.”<br />
<br />
“I thought you weren’t a very good student.”<br />
<br />
“That doesn’t mean I don’t like to learn. It’s just hard in a classroom setting, that’s all. It can get boring after a time. I tend to lose interest.”<br />
<br />
“Tell me about it” Evan agreed. “I have the same problem. It’s just so boring and you get to a point where you get tired after a while. It’s hard to concentrate on what you’re supposed to be learning all day without a break. We get lunch and gym twice a week and that’s about it.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s finish up the history lesson” Michael insisted, as he continued to read from the notes on Evan’s communication device. <br />
<br />
Michael tried for about thirty minutes, but Evan didn’t seem to comprehend the material. After a time, Chris spoke up.<br />
<br />
“I know it’s not my place to do this” he said nervously “but can I please make a suggestion?”<br />
<br />
“Argh” Michael replied with an annoyed tone in his voice. “What is it, Chris?”<br />
<br />
“Never mind.”<br />
<br />
“No tell us” Evan said insistently. <br />
<br />
“I knew I shouldn’t have said anything.”<br />
<br />
“Dad, let Chris say what he wants to say and then we can finish up.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh, fine” Michael replied with an annoyed tone. “What is it, Chris?”<br />
<br />
“I was going to suggest” Chris replied “that maybe there was some way to bring the text material to life. Perhaps Evan is a visual learner and it’s harder for him to learn from you reading it to him or reading it in a textbook.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not a bad idea” Evan replied. <br />
<br />
“How would you suggest we go about doing that?” Michael asked, unhappy with Chris’ suggestion.<br />
<br />
“Maybe tomorrow, Mr. Scavolini, you can put on a documentary about the subject matter in the book. Maybe if Evan sees the images on the screen with some narration, it’ll bring the subject matter to life in a way that just reading it can’t.”<br />
<br />
Michael groaned, before Evan spoke up. <br />
<br />
“That’s a great idea, Chris. Dad, you should consider doing that. Maybe it’ll help me out with learning this stuff.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not even sure how to go about doing that for this particular subject material, Chris” Michael replied. “I have no clue what would be approved by the school district and what would explain everything Evan needs to know to pass this course.”<br />
<br />
“I know you don’t want me to overstep my boundaries” Chris replied “but if you would like, I can look over this material and do some research tonight before I go to bed. Help you out a little, you know?”<br />
<br />
“I mean, you can try, but I don’t see what you could possibly find that I wouldn’t be able to pull up myself and get the school district’s approval at the same time.”<br />
<br />
Chris shrugged his shoulders. <br />
<br />
“Worth it to try&quot; he replied. &quot;What do you have to lose?”<br />
<br />
“My ability to homeschool him, Chris” Michael replied with a strong sternness in his voice. &quot;That&#39;s what.&quot;<br />
<br />
Freddy came down the stairs to briefly look at his family and Chris sitting on the couch together.<br />
<br />
“I’m surprised you let Chris sit with you guys on the couch, Michael” he noted. “I thought for sure you’d make him sit in a chair.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not as bad with the three of us” Michael replied. “Three adults is different than two adults and a kid.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll just be another hour or so and then I can come back down to join you guys.”<br />
<br />
“Take your time” Chris insisted. “Focus on your work. I’ll stay here with your husband and kid. That is, if Michael is ok with it.”<br />
<br />
Chris looked at Michael sympathetically, hoping for a positive reaction. Sighing, Michael nodded in approval. <br />
<br />
“Chris can stay” he said.<br />
<br />
Freddy nodded happily, before making his way back into the bedroom. <br />
<br />
Michael tried for a couple minutes more to help Evan with the subject material, before he decided to give up.<br />
<br />
“I think we’re done for the day” Michael said, as he shut off the communication device. <br />
<br />
“Dad, can I go play with Chris now?” Evan asked. <br />
<br />
“You need to stay indoors” Michael replied. “We can’t risk you being outside with those reporters hounding us.”<br />
<br />
“Evan” Chris said “would you mind going into your room please?”<br />
<br />
“Why?” Evan asked, showing a frown on his face. “Am I in trouble?”<br />
<br />
“No, kid. I would just like to have a private word with your dad. Can you give us some privacy, please?”<br />
<br />
Evan reluctantly nodded, before he made his way up into his bedroom. Sighing, Chris turned to Michael and looked at him with a sadness visible on his face. <br />
<br />
“Mr. Scavolini” he said “I’m sorry for overstepping my boundaries earlier. You’re his dad and the teacher and it wasn’t right for me to try to interfere with that.”<br />
<br />
“I appreciate you saying that, Chris” Michael replied. “I just need to ask you something.”<br />
<br />
“Shoot.”<br />
<br />
“Did you have Evan tell me that he loved me so you could try to get your way back into the kitchen to cook again?”<br />
<br />
Chris slapped his forehead and groaned loudly. <br />
<br />
“Of course not, Mr. Scavolini. I was only trying to have him tell you how he felt about you and nothing else. The whole point of my pep talk was to try to get him to cheer you up, not to use it as a means of trying to get you to let me cook again. I can’t believe he said that. Ugh.”<br />
<br />
“So that wasn’t the whole point of his ‘I love you’ speech?”<br />
<br />
“Of course not, Mr. Scavolini. No way in hell. Look, I know you have your concerns that you think I’m trying to be Evan’s substitute dad or something. I’m not. I was just trying to get him to show his appreciation for you more because you said to me that he didn’t say it to you enough. It wasn’t about trying to butter you up so I can go back to cooking for you guys.”<br />
<br />
“But do you want to cook for us?”<br />
<br />
Chris paused for a moment to cough and compose himself. <br />
<br />
“Listen” he answered honestly “I’d like to do anything that will help keep you all in a good mood so we can deal with the threats we’re facing as a cohesive unit successfully. My job, first and foremost, is to protect Freddy and protect you and your son. Anything beyond that is something I offer as a gesture of good will and also as an olive branch.”<br />
<br />
“An olive branch?” Michael asked quizzically. <br />
<br />
“Look, let’s get to the bottom of things. I know you still don’t feel entirely comfortable around me for many totally legitimate reasons. I was your bully in high school. I regret that so much, that I want to make it up to you as a full grown adult. I have not done a very good job at that so far.”<br />
<br />
“You haven’t done a bad job, per se.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve clearly irked you on more than one occasion and you know what those are. We don’t have to dwell on them. The point is that I’m not here to be Evan’s parent or your husband’s lover. You and Freddy are Evan’s parents and you are Freddy’s lover. I have to be honest with you, man. I notice that your husband has the hots for me and it makes me just as uncomfortable as it makes you. In that sense, you and I are in the same boat.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not really that concerned with him cheating on me, Chris. I just don’t like him gawking at you. I also have to be honest. You kind of remind of me of my father and it’s a bit of a sore subject for me.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I can’t do all that much about that except to let you know that I will respect whatever you ask me to do and whatever rules you set. I just…”<br />
<br />
Chris paused, as Michael looked at him with concern in his facial expression. <br />
<br />
“You just what, Chris?”<br />
<br />
Chris sighed, before he spoke again.<br />
<br />
“I’d just like to make a request to alter the rules a bit.”<br />
<br />
Michael raised his eyebrows, as Chris looked down at his lap.<br />
<br />
“I don’t really care so much about the cooking” Chris confessed. “You can let me in to your kitchen if and when you feel comfortable. I’d just like you to ease the rules a bit on the intimacy stuff. It’s driving me nuts, man. We’re in a very difficult situation here and it hurts me to see you and your husband suffering so much. All I’m asking is that you let me in a little bit. Consider me as more than your protector. Maybe it’s unprofessional of me to say this, but I’d like you to consider me a shoulder you can lean in. Someone to talk to if you need a sympathetic ear. What I’m trying to say is that I want to help you out, that is, if you allow me to.”<br />
<br />
Michael looked at Chris, who continued to stare at his lap.<br />
<br />
“What would that involve?” Michael asked.<br />
<br />
Chris looked up and stared into Michael’s eyes.<br />
<br />
“Would you give me a hug?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think that’s such a good idea.”<br />
<br />
Chris motioned to Michael, who continued to stare at him.<br />
<br />
“Hugging is a great way to release endorphins when you’re feeling sad. It’s not a sexual thing. It’s how people connect with each other on a human level.”<br />
<br />
Just as Chris finished this sentence, Freddy walked out of his bedroom and headed downstairs. <br />
<br />
“What’s going on down here?” Freddy asked. “Where’s Evan?”<br />
<br />
“He’s in his room” Michael replied nervously.<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Chris replied with a smile. “Let’s have a chat. You sit here and I’ll get up.”<br />
<br />
Chris stood up, but Freddy would not sit in his spot on the couch. Noticing this, Michael stood up next to Freddy.<br />
<br />
“I was saying to your husband” Chris continued “that I had some time to think over what we talked about earlier. I want to open myself up to both of you with more than just formal contact. That is, if Michael is ok with it.”<br />
<br />
“Seriously?” Freddy asked, as he turned to look at Michael.<br />
<br />
“Uh” Michael replied nervously “well he said he&#39;d open it up with me. I didn’t think it also meant with you too.”<br />
<br />
“It’s an open invitation to the both of you” Chris said “so you don’t think I’m getting in the way of your marriage. Either you both agree or I’ll keep my boundaries between you.”<br />
<br />
Freddy looked at Michael, with a hopeful expression on his face. <br />
<br />
“Can I have the night to think about it?” Michael asked.<br />
<br />
“Certainly” Chris replied. &quot;Don’t rush to a decision on account of an artificial deadline, though. Talk it over with each other and when you’ve come to a mutual agreement, you’ll get back to me.”<br />
<br />
Just as Chris spoke, Evan came out of his bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Are you done now?” Evan asked, as he ran down the stairs. <br />
<br />
“Yes” Michael replied. “Let me get dinner ready.”<br />
<br />
Chris sat with Freddy and Evan in the living room, while Michael made dinner. The night began relatively peacefully, with a fun game of Uno after dinner. They laughed and had a good time with each other, feeling like a family for the first time since Chris moved in. When it was time for bed, Evan was tucked in by Michael, while Freddy briefly spoke to Chris in the living room. <br />
<br />
“I’m going to try to talk to him when we’re in bed tonight” Freddy said. <br />
<br />
“Don’t rush it is my advice to you” Chris replied. “Let him feel comfortable with whatever you two decide.”<br />
<br />
“I’m surprised you made such a 180 on this from this morning.”<br />
<br />
Chris shrugged his shoulders. <br />
<br />
“I had some time to think about it. I may have been too rigid with you. I trust you not to go too far in your physical contact with me.”<br />
<br />
Freddy shook Chris’ hand, before heading up to bed. <br />
<br />
“Good night Chris” Freddy said .<br />
<br />
“Good night Freddy” Chris replied. <br />
<br />
After Freddy and Michael showered and cleaned up, they settled into bed together. <br />
<br />
“Can we talk about Chris?” Freddy asked, as he snuggled up next to Michael.<br />
<br />
“Can it wait until tomorrow?&quot; Michael asked in response. “I’d like to go to sleep now.”<br />
<br />
Freddy groaned, before he nodded and cuddled up to Michael. They only managed to sleep for an hour before a disturbance hit their home. In front of their house, a car pulled up and dropped someone off in front. As the car sped off into the distance, a man, dressed in all black, approached the front of the house. Peering into the window, the man spotted Chris sleeping on the sofa bed in his pajamas. <br />
<br />
“I have to be quiet” the masked man thought to himself, as he blow torched the front window from the top of the frame. “This man complicates things.”<br />
<br />
After burning the window plane from around the frame, the masked man placed the glass in the grass and jumped into the house. Carefully landing on his feet, the man quietly tiptoed away from Chris and moved up the stairs. He managed to make his way to the door of the main bedroom, before he could tell it was locked. Picking at the lock with a hair pin, the masked man quietly turned the knob and opened the bedroom door. When he got inside, he found what he was looking for. Sleeping on the bed was Freddy, cradling Michael in his arms. <br />
<br />
Pulling out a needle, the masked man snuck his way over to the bed. As he got onto the bed, he accidentally leaned into Michael’s foot. <br />
<br />
“What was that!” Michael yelled as he woke, before he noticed the masked man leaning on his bed. “Ah!”<br />
<br />
“Huh!?” Freddy yelped, as he woke up from his sleep. <br />
<br />
“What’s going on up there?” Chris thought to himself, as he was jolted awake and immediately ran up the stairs. <br />
<br />
“Oh shit” the masked man said, as he pulled out a gun. <br />
<br />
“Freddy!” Michael exclaimed. “Look out!”<br />
<br />
Before the masked man could aim the gun at Freddy, Chris ran towards him and body slammed him onto the bed. Freddy got up and ran with Michael into their bathroom. Chris wrestled the masked man down on the bed and held him firmly in place. Pulling some handcuffs from his pajama bottom pocket, he fastened them to the masked man’s wrists and secured them in place. The body guard Freddy hired had successfully done his job. Freddy’s assassin was subdued. Chris had saved the day.<br />
<br />
With the masked man successfully subdued….</p>
