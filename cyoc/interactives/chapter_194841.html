<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rays of sunlight seeped through the thin drapes and warmly caressed Ethan’s face, gently beckoning him to open his eyes and greet another morning. Just like any other day, the groggy teenager rummaged for his phone to check the time, he then stretched out his arms as much as he could, yawned and hopped out of bed; Ethan proceeded to head straight to the bathroom to take a leak.<br />
<br />
Ethan lowered his pajama pants and blindly reached down to grab the little guy, but strangely kept grasping at air. He rubbed his eyes before looking down.<br />
<br />
The events of yesterday seemed like a weird dream, yet seeing it now Ethan couldn’t deny, it all really did happen.<br />
<br />
“Whoa…” Now more focused, his hand… no, rather his fingers successfully pinched between a short, thin, fleshy nub. Ethan raised an eyebrow in bewilderment; it didn’t feel as squishy as he thought it would be, “Am I…is this hard?”<br />
<br />
Surely enough he had morning wood. Ethan stared at the tiny penis jutting out from between his legs, it wasn’t the first time he’d seen it, sometimes when they were struggling to pay the water bills, the two brothers would jump in the shower together to save money, but this time it was different. Eric’s penis was on him. Standing here was a pretty well built 17 year old, 6’2 of height, toned muscles, sinewy from years of being in the swim team but with a smooth prepubescent package that didn’t even compare to the size and length of his index finger, hard; it was comical to say the least. Ethan knew that Eric was self-conscious about his size, however he never imagined it could be this small, back when Ethan was Eric’s age he had already hit 4 inches soft and that number would double when he was erect- coming up to 6 inches soft and 12 inches hard at present day. It seems unlike him, Eric was neither a grower nor a shower. Out of sheer curiosity, Ethan flicked it with his fingers; it did a little bounce and sent shivers down his spine.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the door swung open and Ethan instinctively scrambled to cover himself up. Eric had walked in, half-asleep.<br />
<br />
“Morning”<br />
<br />
“Jesus, don’t you knock?!”<br />
<br />
“Never bothered you before” Eric said, grabbing a toothbrush from the sink.<br />
<br />
Ethan froze with his hands at his crotch and eyes momentarily on his brother’s. Eric was a short scrawny kid, which only made the appendage he was carrying much more startling. Regardless of it being soft, the weight of that meat couldn’t help but spill out of Eric’s tiny briefs. That cock seemingly engulfed him. Ethan could feel a small stirring in his lions.<br />
<br />
Feeling the eyes burn at the back of his head, Eric stopped brushing his teeth, spat out and turned to face his big brother.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay?” He asked.<br />
<br />
“Y…yeah, yeah I’m fine” Stammered Ethan.<br />
<br />
Eric’s eyes wandered to Ethan’s hands, which were still covering up his crotch. Eric furrowed his eyebrows.<br />
<br />
“You’re not gonna take it back are you?”<br />
<br />
There was a short silence.<br />
<br />
“What? Haha, no…” Ethan shook his head vigorously, “Like I said, it was my idea, go blow their minds”<br />
<br />
Eric walked across the compact bathroom and hugged his older brother. His cheek lay against the back of Ethan’s hand whilst his junk, or rather borrowed junk, pressed against Ethan’s leg. This was awkward.<br />
<br />
“Thanks Ethan, you’re the best!” said Eric.<br />
<br />
Ethan let a small grin escape his lips; he was glad that he could help his little brother out. However, he really felt like being alone right now.<br />
<br />
“Um, could you give me a little privacy?”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure everything is okay?”<br />
<br />
“I just really need to take a dump”<br />
<br />
With that Eric immediately let go, “Gross” he laughed before finally walking out.<br />
<br />
Ethan sighed a breath of relief and let his hands fall to his sides.<br />
<br />
‘That softened it’ Ethan thought to himself, ‘It looks even more pathetic now’. The tiny little snub had shrunk even further, retreating into Ethan’s body; it looked like the tip of an acorn peeking through after being buried into the ground. The balls were almost non existent, was it too cold in here? Or was that how they always looked. Ethan tried to cup the balls, but they were too far up there, he decided to use two fingers to pinch and roll the tight sack, searching for testicles. They were there, just a little smaller than quail eggs. Ethan noted how soft and hyper sensitive the skin felt, he felt the stirring again and immediately stopped, it would be difficult to take a piss were he sporting a stiff one.<br />
<br />
‘Would it though?’ the thought crept inside his head for a second and that made him shake his head, “Snap out of it” Ethan said to himself, “I’m not going to jerk off with Eric’s cock, that’s weird”.<br />
<br />
Ethan tried to release, but the piss trickled down his balls and leg, he buried two fingers in the fleshy bird’s nest and pinched the head, stretching it out, the pinching made the stream come out in little weak bursts.<br />
<br />
Ethan inhaled deeply, held the air for a few seconds before exhaling. He put the toilet seat down and sat. Elbows on his knees and head in his hands, he let go of the piss.<br />
<br />
He had never peed sitting down before, for some reason it felt…emasculating…and yet, he couldn’t help but notice the stirring.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Miraculously, Ethan was able to distract himself from the morning’s confusing start by dedicating all of his concentration on his classes.<br />
<br />
Although, during lunchtime he’d catch a glimpse of some people whispering to each other, possibly looking at him and laughing. They couldn’t have known how could they?<br />
<br />
‘Impossible, it’s not like you’re waving your cock out and around to the whole school…’ Ethan mused internally, but it had only deepened his paranoia. He stopped in his tracks, his heart beating faster and faster as he came to a realization, ‘Why did I wear skinny jeans today?’<br />
<br />
“You aight dude?” Greg, Ethan’s friend and teammate, waved his hand in front of Ethan’s face.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… You know what? I’m not really that hungry” Ethan placed the tray of food he was carrying down on the long table, where the rest of his teammates sat.<br />
<br />
“Hey, you sure you’re okay? You look real pale dude”<br />
<br />
“Haha… yeah, you know what, maybe I should pop over to the nurse’s office”<br />
<br />
“Want me to come with?”<br />
<br />
“Nah man, it’s okay man, just a little under the weather, probably nothing”<br />
<br />
“Suit yourself”<br />
<br />
One of the other team members asked what the hell was up as Ethan made a beeline to the male lavatories.<br />
<br />
Once there, he locked the main door and checked underneath every cubicle. He was alone, great. He closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths. Exhaling for the fifth time, he turns around towards the mirrors and slowly opens his eyes.<br />
<br />
His crotch looked flat. Of course his crotch looked flat, it WAS flat, he knew exactly how he would look in these skinny jeans yesterday when Eric and he made the switch. Ethan turned his hips to the side and looked at the profile, which looked even worse; he appeared no different than one of the girls down there. Ethan spread his hand down to his flat crotch, did people notice? He put these skinny jeans on out of habit and didn’t notice until now, maybe they didn’t.<br />
<br />
‘Maybe they did’.<br />
<br />
Ethan bit his bottom lip and noticed a little bit of development. He was getting hard.<br />
<br />
“Really, right now?” How much did it poke out? Ethan didn’t have a ruler on him, but he estimated maybe an inch or two… No, this morning his erection didn’t even encompass the length of his index finger… two inches is pushing it.<br />
<br />
Ethan fell to the floor, there was a tightening in his chest and it was getting a little harder to breathe. He hadn’t felt like this since his mother left.<br />
<br />
“I’m having a panic attack over something so stupid” he murmured to himself, wasn’t it he who always told Eric that the size of his penis didn’t matter? “Right, it doesn’t matter”.<br />
<br />
Ethan started with his breathing again, he managed to calm himself down a bit until the bell rang and he remembered.<br />
<br />
“We have a swim practice after school”.<br />
<br />
Ethan got up, trying his best not to freak out; he stared at the reflection in the mirror. He was still aroused for some reason. It didn’t do much, but at least it wasn’t flat, if he could just stuff something in there…maybe everything will be alright?<br />
<br />
He scurried through the cubicles and got as much toilet paper as needed. He shoved it down his underwear and squished it about, attempting to shape it where it would look believable.<br />
<br />
He observed his handiwork in the mirror, it looked fine, he thinks, perhaps but it did feel somewhat off, “This will have to do”.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Going into the locker room had never been such a big ordeal to Ethan before, but now with what he was currently packing, he tiptoed in, as if he were an intruder, encroaching on some wild beasts’ cave.<br />
<br />
“So, feelin’ all better now?” Greg patted Ethan’s shoulder which made him jump a little.<br />
<br />
“Ha… yeah… it was nothing” Greg looked at Ethan with a raised brow, indicating that the deflection wasn’t much convincing, “Seriously” Ethan continued, “It was…gas, just gas”.<br />
<br />
“Ah well, lay off the cheese yah?”<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, someone had grabbed the rim of Greg’s pants and pulled them down, it was Jared.<br />
<br />
“How’s it hangin’ baby dick!” Jared laughed loudly as he ran away, Greg following suit and chasing after him.<br />
<br />
“Shut up asshole!”<br />
<br />
All the color ran out of Ethan’s face. That could have been him.<br />
<br />
What made it even worse; Greg wasn’t even that small, his penis is literally 5 inches, that’s average as hell. It dawned to Ethan that no one on the team was lacking in that department…no one, except him. Greg had the smallest package on the team, but that was an unfair assessment, since everyone else on the team were pretty well endowed and Ethan was the biggest, was; he never had to think about it, but now it’s glaringly clear.<br />
<br />
Ethan sat down and pretended to be preoccupied with his phone while he waited for everyone to be done changing. After they left, he surveyed the area to determine a possible blind spot, in case someone walked in to check on him or something- The far corner of the showers should do, if this place had separated cubicle showers that would have made things easier.<br />
<br />
Forgetting that he had toilet paper in his underwear, they fell onto the wet floor and Ethan frantically picked up the soft disintegrating pieces. He swore under his breath and put on his red Speedo. Much like how Eric looked yesterday, there was a lot of loose fabric in the front. What Eric had said rang in Ethan’s ears so clearly.<br />
<br />
‘How do you not feel embarrassed wearing this in front of people?’<br />
<br />
“I had no reason to be…” Ethan murmured to himself as he stuffed the mushy toilet paper into his Speedos, hoping to high heaven, they would stay put when he goes swimming.<br />
<br />
The afternoon was going good, being smoother and smaller down there did actually seem to have improved Ethan’s time and soon he was done with his laps earlier than the rest.<br />
<br />
“New time! You’re doing great Ethan! Amazing!” The coach yelled from the opposite end of the pool, Ethan beaming and feeling proud with his progress, pulled up out of the pool, ready for the day to be over.<br />
<br />
“Dude I could see your butt!” Greg shouted laughing.<br />
<br />
Ethan’s hands had never reached for his crotch so quick in his entire life. In all the excitement and adrenaline, he did not notice his Speedo had slipped off, since it didn’t have his previous junk to anchor it, he really should have anticipated this.<br />
<br />
Nobody saw it right? He was so fast today no one was in front or beside him for this last lap. He couldn’t see anyone sitting in the bleachers; no one could have seen him from this angle, surely! Ethan looked behind him, left to right and that’s when he noticed it. There was something sticky on his palms.<br />
<br />
“I came”.</p>
