<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The girls had voted as a whole that during the next full moon they'd sneak out just before <br />
midnight and on the thirteenth hour (don't ask) use their magic on their familiars to try and <br />
form the link Grissele had with Solome and learn the real names of their friends, forging <br />
their link between Master and Familiar.  <br />
<br />
&quot;So what kind of magic are we going to use?&quot; Goldwyn asked as the girls entered what <br />
counted as a 'sunday school' in Glendale. <br />
<br />
Even the girls were not stupid enough to release totally blind magic at something let alone <br />
their precious familiars.  The fact that Goldwyn had her vision of Lucky before the bird was <br />
likely hatched didn't matter a bit to either of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno,&quot; Gita admitted, &quot;maybe change their colors for a little while? Maybe make them <br />
younger, would be good practice for us saving other kids from becoming adults.&quot; <br />
<br />
Goldwyn nodded, that was a sacred and honorable task for them. Many of the parents of <br />
the children they had rescued wondered why they had waited so long to have children and <br />
a year or so later were taking care of a newborn having no idea children they no longer <br />
remembered having were nearby as a doll, a relief, a totem, a statue or statuette, even one <br />
who Gita had turned into a child shaped tree. And of course all the Golden Dear Fawns...  <br />
They both knew better than to change them simply into other species of Man... Man, all of <br />
those species, were each just slaves to law. <br />
<br />
Golwyn being ten and Gita eleven were in what counted as separate 'classes' if they could <br />
even be called that. At this point, the girls didn't even ASK anymore if someone wanted to <br />
be saved or not, they knew what was better so what did it matter what the people they <br />
were saving thought?  They were smarter than the puritans.  They avoided doing the entire <br />
town just cause they KNEW their foster father WOULD notice, and Princess had warned <br />
them deeply that they couldn't risk doing such things until they were powerful enough that <br />
no one could oppose their saving of the world. <br />
<br />
As a bit of brief review, the teacher in the class did a quick account of the Apple in the <br />
Garden of Eden and a snake (concluded by most now to be the devil in disguise), luring <br />
Adam and Eve to take the apple and leave paradise. <br />
<br />
Gita of course in class declared of course, &quot;Snakes aren't bad!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This snake was.&quot; The teacher said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;And why did they have to leave Eden then anyway?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause they broke the one rule that God gave them. Not to Eat from the Tree of Knowledge <br />
of Good and Evil, or Knowledge of All Things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is having knowledge a bad things-?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Because the more you know, the more aware you are of your world, and the less innocent <br />
you are, and once Adam and Eve were no longer innocent, they could no longer stay in a <br />
place meant for innocence. That is the price of being something more like becoming <br />
adults.&quot; Ironically this teacher was being more understanding than some and doing her <br />
best to answer Gita's questions. <br />
<br />
Gita however, just saw her as throwing her questions back in her face. &quot;Then everyone <br />
should just STAY children!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is actually a passage about returning to having the faith of a child actually. But <br />
becoming children again in of itself?  You can't turn back time or take back your own <br />
choices, if we could, then free will would become meaningless.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I'll turn back time! I'll take back all the bad choices! Me and my sisters will make <br />
everything right! Everything as it SHOULD BE!'  Gita then recklessly using her magic to take <br />
years off the age of the teacher, making some students gasp, the teacher didn't notice, and <br />
Gita's common sense got her attention before the grown woman became a toddler. Of <br />
course, no one had even the slightest idea that Gita could have done this. The teacher <br />
spoke again only to hear her higher voice and look at herself and realize her age had been <br />
cut in half!  Gita left the class then, not really caring what happened next as the teacher <br />
and her students broke into a commotion over the strange happening and ignoring the <br />
words of her class mates at how bizarre the sight was. <br />
<br />
Hiding Solome in a small bag Grisselle waited for her sisters' lessons to be done for the <br />
day. She noticed two sisters about her age hugging, &quot;See you in three months.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gissle didn't even ask what their problem was, because their problem wasn't about to <br />
matter!  The sisters' clothes dissolved as one grew older and the other younger until they <br />
were the same age, and their features changed until they were identical twins. They had <br />
time to gasp and point at each other and themselves and would have screamed in alarm if <br />
a wave of peace hadn't washed over their minds then as they stepped on the edge of a <br />
garden held hands and then leaned back from each other and turned to green metal with <br />
little wings that molded from their backs a minute later, both of them having a frozen <br />
laugh on their faces. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well done Master. Well done. The speed at which you improve would make many tremble.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
That night, all three girls wearing witches cloaks (really their security blankets tied around <br />
their necks like super hero capes), stood in a circle (more like a triangle).  The moon was <br />
rising, and the witching hour was nearly upon them where in theory (or at least according <br />
to fairy tales) their magic would be strongest.  Various creatures watched them from the <br />
edge of the clearing where they'd logically make tempting targets to any nocturnal <br />
predator looking for an easy kill.  With them of course were &quot;Lucky&quot; Solome, <br />
Princess(Herodias), and Daisy (Lilith) held by each witchling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay girls! Let's do this!&quot; Gita declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;This shall be so gay!&quot; Goldwyn laughed.<br />
<br />
Glass Marie said, &quot;It had a different meaning back then, moving on.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sisters you are gonna love it!&quot; Gissele encouraged, &quot;The link I have with my familiar is <br />
wonderful! I feel like I'm whole in a way I never imagined before!&quot;<br />
<br />
The other two nodded, looking very foreword to this. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't Griselle -lose- Salome, Lucky, whatever, before the end?&quot; Betty asked remember <br />
her time as living crystal twins doing the dance of chaos in Kurse's honor on Big Bad Island <br />
and the feeling of the missing familiar. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Glass Marie said smoothing out the folds on her black and red dress, &quot;When they <br />
were women in their late 20s, handing out candy to children. Candy that left children's <br />
minds completely vulnerable to the Infinite Chaos, and drove them utterly and completely <br />
mad like an animal with rabies, they saw this as 'saving them.' <br />
<br />
A Jewish Leoman cub named Mal'Akh lost her big sister that way. Mal'akh's dog smelled <br />
something wrong with the women and attacked Gaal. Gaal side stepped the animal who <br />
then in the same trajectory got his jaws on Soleme's neck and broke it... The poor dog's <br />
insides were boiled alive by the vengeful witch less than a minute later.  Her sister <br />
however, took the candy that had been dropped and foolishly ate it anyway... You can <br />
guess what happened next.  <br />
<br />
Twenty years later, as a police officer, Mal'Akh was one of the first victims of the game <br />
when a fellow officer who was an anti-semitist used it to turn her into one of Glendale's <br />
first living art.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lawrence looked surprised, &quot;?! A WOMAN as a police officer in 1710?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddex asked in turn, &quot;They HAD police officers in 1720?&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha remembering her time as Glass and thus her time as a part of the curse asked <br />
ideally, &quot;Mal'Akh, was that not the name of one of the Leoman that Penny saved from being <br />
trapped as artwork at the Glendale gallery?&quot; <br />
<br />
The little witch answered all the questions in turn, &quot;Being a Leoman, she was begrudgingly <br />
accepted for being effective, and with the extra amount of trouble the game caused during <br />
the first couple generations the police accepted all the help they could get. And 'police' I <br />
guess isn't really the right word, since law enforcement wasn't really centralized or fully <br />
institutionalized at the time, but she was an agent for what counted as law. And yes, that <br />
was the name of one of the people Penny saved, I know because I know everything the <br />
various bits and pieces of the curse knew at the time of Kurse's death, and yes, it is the <br />
same Mal'Akh.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lilly and Casandra hugged each other at the story of the children the witches had driven <br />
mad, the statues they had a bit of an acceptance given the japanese lupmen's time as living <br />
art, but reduced to nothing but mad dogs was truly frightening to them. Maddex held his <br />
daughters close him two arms and one head each as they shivered. 'I'm beginning to <br />
wonder if my girls should really be hearing all this!' He looked at Samantha, who seemed <br />
to be holding up well. Then again, while the Alphas' oldest children had been as immature <br />
as children would be but smarter than most collage graduates, the Alphas' younger <br />
children were surprisingly almost frighteningly mature at time. <br />
<br />
Betty asked trying to divert the subject,&quot;How old were they by this point? 1675 I mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gita was six in 1670 when they fled what would become Germany, that makes he eleven <br />
in 1675 when she began attending confirmation classes. Her adopted sister Goldwyn was <br />
around five, and Griselle was four.  Marie Cruz was a between Goldwyn and Gita's ages. <br />
Meaning she was also just under eleven when she began blooming early.  Gita would be <br />
thirty-six when she died. She would be around sixteen when she and her sisters crossed <br />
the point of no return though their foster father for some time wouldn't stop trying...&quot; <br />
<br />
Samantha said, &quot;Goldwyn was supposed to be deformed since birth that half her face <br />
resembled a death's head, I remember that from when I was Glass. But from what you <br />
describe it was a gradual process.&quot; <br />
<br />
Glass Marie nodded, the shock wave entered the past as well of course, not just the present <br />
or future. &quot;Repairing her birth deformity was actually the first gift her birth father gave her. <br />
But it seemed fate was determined to return her face to how it was at birth one piece at a <br />
time as she stepped away more from what her family taught her... And more her own ideals <br />
and that of her sister that Herodias encouraged her master.&quot; <br />
<br />
Samantha, being Alice's sister, also pointed out, &quot;And Marie's hair when she started <br />
gathering allies in 1685 was blond, but it was black when Garbiel adopted her.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Funny story that one,&quot; Glass Marie said honestly, &quot;that would have more to do with <br />
'Maurice' needing to ultimately 'go away.'  and no one ultimately connecting 'Maurice' with <br />
'Marie' and the power of habits after it was no longer an issue.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lawrence having been a schoolar before he had let his insecurities make him and Roger <br />
become a muscle builders pointed out another inconsistency, &quot;Cholera came from India <br />
and didn't appear in Spain for over fifty years I'm sure, Marie's parents died in 1669 or <br />
1670. And the symptoms she described 'bleeding in places' sounded more like the good <br />
old black plague! And if Gabriel was to pass for a plague doctor, there's no way he'd <br />
mistake two different diseases for each other. And I'm fairy certain the disease hadn't even <br />
APPEARED YET when Gabriel mentioned it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Glass Marie wondered how many of those were due to errors of her own memory, or due to <br />
reality repairing itself from the shock-wave released from Kurse's destruction. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Father Mike asked, &quot;So after it goes into the water supply, we bless the entire town, and <br />
hope that kills the game?&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity answered, &quot;It's better than reading from the phone book since we're likely to miss <br />
someone, and if we do this one person at a time we're bound to miss someone and even if <br />
we don't, don't forget there are plenty of people who DON'T want to give up the power the <br />
game gives them and that could turn messy and ugly very fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand... I just don't wish all we're making to be gone with the rainwater if it turns <br />
out it doesn't work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we're lucky the cure isn't bound by the same 'five at once only' rule that the game is. <br />
And to be frank? If we're lucky it won't be, because I think deep in my gut, that Glendale <br />
itself, the town, is sick of this curse too, and wants it to end as badly as the people who <br />
live in it do.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Things don't have hearts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not... but there was been so many object victims over the years that maybe their <br />
souls have pretty much become Glendale...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a big if.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better than fighting house to house and facing someone who'd rather waste their turn <br />
turning one of us into an eggplant than let their chance at using the game go.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Jacob said to the lioness, &quot;What about good old fashioned hypnosis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just get a professional to hypnotize you into forgetting the previous worlds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a bunch of mumbo jumbo and stage magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, hypnosis can work fairly well if the subject is knowing, willing, and has their <br />
guard down. And since hypnosis is actually better at messing up memories rather than <br />
restoring them you'd have a fairly good shoot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gill thought about it, if Serenity's scheme worked and they finally killed the game, that <br />
would be the end of it, no more changes to reality related to the game, and this would be <br />
the only life she'd have.  However if it didn't work, she'd just be scared and confused when <br />
someone used the game again to twist existence. <br />
<br />
Gill said, &quot;Only -after- the game is destroyed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Destroyed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A cure to finally wipe it is out is being worked on. If that works, fine, I'll try you silly magic <br />
trick suggestion, though I seriously doubt it'll work! The curse was for me to remember <br />
every change to reality!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did it say how you'd remember him?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe just get hypnotized into thinking they're a dream or fiction, you'd still remember <br />
them but not think of them as real...&quot;<br />
<br />
Gill groaned, &quot;Fine, whatever, okay, I'll try it, but again, only AFTER it works that the game <br />
is gone! If I could undo every twist to existence it's done I would.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't Gillie.&quot; He said to the lionesses he had known for decades according to his own <br />
memories. <br />
<br />
&quot;HOW THE HELL CAN YOU SAY THAT?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't suppose you ever heard of a game called Final Fantasy Tactics? One of friends of <br />
my son, another cub from the Pride, has it, and once I heard him explaining the game to <br />
his mother. Apparently a sad little boy used a magic book to completely remake the world <br />
into something fantastic. With only the main characters remembering. In spite of a lot of <br />
things being better, the main character wanted the boy to use the book to undo things so <br />
his friends would stop trying to run from reality and actually face their problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And that was what the narrative was going for I think. But I always thought, 'isn't reality <br />
what exists?' If something existences, isn't it therefore part of reality? Isn't THIS reality <br />
right now we're in? We're not in a giant VR machine as far I know, and we aren't in a <br />
massive shared dream... we're solid, we're real, we're alive... I'll admit I guess I have it <br />
easier cause if what you say is true Gillie, which I won't say weather I believe it or not, that <br />
since I don't remember how things used to be it's easier for me to cling to what I KNOW <br />
opposed to what I don't... but... is existence right now really so bad? Sure there's criminals, <br />
wars, assaults, injustice, diseases, but most of those are part of free will aren't they? Is the <br />
reality you remember any better or worse than this one? Doesn't it have it's own right to <br />
exist?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie recounted a historic event. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're kidding! That didn't happen before? That's impossible! And this was part of what <br />
turned you into you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it was way before this, decades ago, but it's now taught in the history books... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't imagine the world without that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can because I lived in a world without it... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Gillie...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's... never mind, I need to get used to that name now anyway...&quot; Gillie would have to see <br />
if she was still three-forths native American... <br />
<br />
Jacob leaned over and hugged her again, &quot;I don't care about former realities or new <br />
realities if they come after this one. In THIS reality you're my pack mate, and that is a <br />
GOOD THING! And I'll stay -by- that good thing. I'm proud to have you as part of our <br />
Pride...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Jacob...&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;This room... it's normally a lot more crowded isn't it?&quot; Penny asked, having been to the <br />
Wolf Manor before of course. And the dinning room had never been this empty at feeding <br />
time whenever she had been here. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes My Mistress.&quot; Umeko said pushing her along holding out her arms long so her breasts <br />
didn't bump the wheel chair. &quot;But with many of your Pride mates, and my Pack mates <br />
injured in battle, and those at their post of being at their side for those who can not help <br />
themselves... you have much more space to yourself My Mistress.&quot; Umeko spoke the <br />
obvious performing her duty in her status as Penny's proxy slave to the hilt. <br />
<br />
With so many recovering and so many asleep from having been up all night, no one <br />
bothered to take role call. With the Alphas recovering and the Betas indisposed, and and <br />
even the GAMMA healing from battle, and there was no way in hades that Epsilon-Nick <br />
was leaving Epsilon-Nicole's side, everyone turned to Mr. P to hold dinner along with their <br />
guests...</p>
