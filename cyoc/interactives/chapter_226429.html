<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the pardoning of turkeys has been a tradition that has been performed by presidents for years and several governors have also done, not a lot of attention is called to what happens to the turkeys afterwards. Being domesticated turkeys, they could hardly be released into the wild. Most often, they&#39;re sent to animal sanctuaries where they can live out the rest of their lives, which are often still rather short. This is particularly true of the Broad Breasted White Turkey that is so commonly used in commercial farming. They&#39;re bred to grow to a large size and thus have several obesity-based health problems as well as being flightless.<br />
<br />
Gus, Maple, Matilda, and Pumpkin were four such turkeys who were pardoned by the governor of Colorado this year. However, the four of them wouldn&#39;t be spending their short lives on a sanctuary. As a gesture of good faith (and good PR), these turkeys were being sent to Mesozoic Enclave. They weren&#39;t going to be simply uplifted, like most other animals. Project Niwrad had proven it was possibly to turn animals into prehistoric versions of Animalians. Though admittedly, it wasn&#39;t commonly done. Most people would prefer to make birds into bird Animalians, whether they be pets or wildlife rescues. The process could theoretically be applied to other animals, though it would most likely only be able to turn them into direct ancestors or close relatives. Thus, a modern feline couldn&#39;t likely be turned into a saber-tooth cat.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The four turkeys were left in the changing room by themselves. Uplifted Animalians often needed some time to coordinate their new bodies as well as come to terms with their increased intellect. The treatment to start the reverse-evolution was rather simple. A pan of corn had been sprayed with the formula and turkeys aren&#39;t so concerned that their foot is a little wet. As for the particular kind of dromaeosaur they would be becoming, there has been voting and debating about that. Eventually, they settled with <i>Velociraptor</i>.<br />
<br />
It was rather noticeable when the treated Animalian virus started to kick in. The turkeys shuddered before they started growing in size. There was some feather-shedding mostly for their tails as they started growing out into thicker reptilian ones. Gus was the one losing the most feathers as well as several other features of his turkey nature. The first thing to go was the beard on his chest. His waddle and snoot were pulled back into his flesh as it became scalier. His beak started cracking apart as a reptilian muzzle grew beneath it.<br />
<br />
The other three were going through their own changes as they gained more height. Their claws grew sharper before one of their toes became the famous sickle claw of raptors. Their wings lost some excess feathers as new digits grew out of the tips. Quite soon, they had functional arms with clawed hands. Their more humanoid features became more obvious as they entered their final stage. Their waists became more defined as their hips and rears rounded out into pleasing shapes. There was a bit of soft moaning as their turkey breasts swelled out into substantial Animalian breasts.<br />
<br />
When they were finished, there was very little indication that the four raptor Animalians had once been turkeys. Even their feathers weren&#39;t much of a giveaway considering how white they were. The four of them were looking over their new bodies with interest. &quot;Well, this is different,&quot; said Matilda, cupping her new breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I like it,&quot; said Maple, flexing her arms, &quot;I feel so strong and powerful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy for you to say,&quot; said Gus.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re big and strong too,&quot; said Pumpkin.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I feel so...emasculated,&quot; said Gus, &quot;I have no beard, no waddle, no snood. What do I have left?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you have...big, bulging muscles,&quot; said Matilda. Her new hormones were starting to kick in the longer she looked at Gus.<br />
<br />
&quot;And an appealing masculine musk,&quot; said Mable, taking in a deep sniff. Gus breathed in through his new nostrils and was surprised how much more he could pick, particularly the pheromones being released by the other raptors&#39; increasing arousal. He soon started feeling aroused himself and his new penis soon emerged from its sheath.<br />
<br />
Pumpkin licked her lips and said, &quot;And you&#39;ve got such a big drumstick.&quot; Not long after that, the three raptors converged on Gus. Gus wasn&#39;t really inclined to decline their advances. He wasn&#39;t quite sure who was the first one he mated with, but all three of them would be getting their turn. It was quite some time before anyone could get in to tell them what Animalia and Dinotopia is.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Of course, there was more to being a Dinotopian than just having an improved body and mind. There were remedial classes for the lot of them so they can catch up and join society. For the moment, it was unclear if they would remain a pack as Colorado&#39;s laws are different from Nevada&#39;s. Though there were plenty of guys who would be interested in a sexy <i>Velociraptor</i> babe. Especially since they were looking into dying their feathers different colors, particularly Pumpkin.</p>
