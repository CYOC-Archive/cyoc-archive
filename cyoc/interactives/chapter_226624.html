<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was already December and it was the last day of classes before winter vacation. Today Hana and I were eating our lunch on the third floor of the annex building. I think this place was planned to be some kind of living room, but due to the fact that it was small, not anywhere near to the cafeteria and people would need to climb two stores through the stairs to reach it, it wasn’t very popular. Apart from that, it is a great place to eat when you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of people. It has a great view,  comfortable sofas, and a great heating now that the weather is getting colder. <br />
<br />
Today we were not buying lunch from the cafeteria, because we brought lunch from home. I was eating a tuna, lettuce and cheese sandwich and Hana brought an egg and avocado wrap. We were both sharing a thermos of warm tea that I prepared for today.<br />
<br />
The reason that we were here instead in the cafeteria with our usual group of friends is because of Hana. These days since the weather has gotten increasingly cold, we could not go for a jog around the neighborhood as usual, instead we replaced it with using the treadmill at the gym. It was only normal for me, but Hana came from a city where the weather didn’t fluctuate that much between summer and winter; therefore, she was feeling a bit sad from the cold weather and from her increased time indoors. It wasn’t that bad at the beginning but since yesterday her mood suddenly dropped and she has become more irritable, so we decided that today we should eat in peace and tranquility while appreciating the view.<br />
<br />
“That dress you bought last time is pretty cute you should use that kind of clothes more often, it really suits you” Hana said between bites<br />
<br />
“Thank you, we bought quite a few things last time so I am trying them one by one; it’s just that I am not used to this look” I said and made a gesture with my hands to emphasize the casual white and blue dress I was wearing<br />
<br />
Since the last time I borrowed Hana’s clothes and was complimented by my family, I have become more comfortable with wearing feminine clothing. Since Hailey, now Oliver, was transexual, he seemed to favor shirts, shorts and pants over dresses, skirts, blouses and other more girly clothing.  When I inherited all his clothes, I thought that it was a small blessing that I didn’t had to start dressing like a girly girl from day one, but now that I have fully accepted my new gender and identity, I decided that it was  fine to try different looks to see which ones suited me better<br />
<br />
With that Idea in mind, I went to the mall with Hana and bought some new clothes. In truth, it was not just the curiosity of trying on dresses and skirts that drove me to the mall, but also the need to replace my old clothes that due to my recent growth have gotten a little too tight. Anyway, these days I have been trying and switching different styles almost everyday; geeky, sexy, tomboyish, trendy, girl next door… I have already tried a few. Not all of the styles have suited me, but I have grown more comfortable wearing any kind of clothing. <br />
<br />
I have realized that the freedom of using any clothes is a privilege that only women have and it is something I should enjoy now. Sure, a man could use a dress or skirt and nothing big would happen, but realistically if one day you saw a boy in your class wearing a dress, you would think that he lost a bet or is gay or transexual, but if you saw a girl wearing pants, you would think nothing of it. I guess this is just a quirk of the society we live in.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, I need to use the bathroom” Hana said while putting one hand in her abdomen<br />
<br />
“What happened?” I said after swallowing the last bit of my sandwich <br />
<br />
“Nothing, just a stomachache” Hana stood up and walked to the bathroom, I quickly packed the empty thermos in my bag and followed behind her. Luckily, there is a bathroom near here,  on this same floor.<br />
<br />
Hana entered one stall and a moment later I entered the one next to her and hung my bag on the door. Peeing while wearing a dress is different than with pants or shorts; since this one is a simple one,  I just need to raise the dress and lower my panties to relieve myself.<br />
<br />
“Eeep!”<br />
<br />
However, before I could do anything I heard a short surprised scream from Hana’s stall<br />
<br />
“Hana!? are you ok?” I ask with a bit of trepidation<br />
“Dahlia, come here, quickly!” Hana says with a bit of panic in her tone<br />
<br />
I quickly exit my stall and see the door to Hana’s one unlocking. I enter swiftly and lock the door behind me. Before I can ask what is wrong, I see the form of Hana sitting on the toilet with her panties down, but the problem is that her panties and crotch are coated in a red substance…no I clearly know that it’s blood<br />
<br />
Hana and I both stay still for a moment without saying anything. We both know that the day where the body declares its fertility has finally come for Hana; and with that, the not so enjoyable experience of being on your period once a month. I stare at Hana’s face and by the look on her watery brown eyes, I know that she is doing her best to not cry. I embrace Hana tightly and she quickly return the hug<br />
 <br />
“It’s fine, everything &#39;s fine, don’t worry” I whisper to her ears while cuddling together and start caressing her hair. When she finally separates from me, she looks much more calm and focused<br />
<br />
“Thank you, I feel a lot better.” Hana says after taking a few deep breaths, but after looking at her bloody panties again, she scrunches her brows “What, should we do now?  <br />
<br />
“First, give your panties. I am going to wash them in the sink.” Hana raises her legs and I carefully take her panties.<br />
<br />
 “Do you have spares?” I ask while looking at the bloody spots, but Hana looks resigned and shakes her head. “There is no problem, either way” I reassure her, “just wait a moment.”<br />
<br />
I go out and start to wash her panties, the blood is still fresh so with a little of hand soap and plenty of water it comes off easily; I look for a hand dryer I could use to dry them, but this bathroom doesn’t have one, just paper towels. Probably, because this bathroom is rarely frequented, the school decided it wasn’t worth it; luckily it did have a small vending machine where I could buy Hana a pad. First however, I took a plastic bag, the thermos and my wallet from my bag. I gave the zip lock bag I brought my lunch in a quick wash and after wringing the water out of Hana’s panties I put them inside. I also washed the thermos we used to drink tea and filled it with water.<br />
<br />
After buying the pad, I gave a few knocks on Hana’s door and after she unlocked it,  I quickly stepped in. <br />
<br />
“Use this to wash yourself, I filled it with water”  I said after handing her the thermos. I could see that she used toilet paper to clean herself, but presented with water she let a continuous stream fall in her crotch and used one hand to rub her pussy and thighs clean. After patting herself dry, I gave her the pad I just bought and she gave me a quizzical look, but before she could ask anything, I took out my own panties and everything clicked for her.<br />
<br />
It is not the first time I lent Hana some of my panties, she had come to my house and I extended the same offer to take a bath after working out after all, but the big difference is that those were clean panties and these… Well, just a moment ago,  I was using them already.<br />
<br />
Hana hesitates for a moment, but her next question surprises me, “are you ok going pantyless for the rest of the day?” <br />
<br />
Hana is really too kind, she was actually worried for me even in this moment. “ I still have your panties, they are wet,  but if we go to the bathroom in the main building, I could dry then on the hand dryer and use them… if you are fine with it”<br />
<br />
“That’s fine” she says while blushing and takes my panties. She probably practiced for her first period because after putting my panties between her legs, she dexterously placed the pad and moved them to her crotch. The pad formed a small bulge in her panties and that sight made me think that sooner or later I would need to use one as well.<br />
<br />
“There are still warm”, she whispered and gave a small nervous smile<br />
<br />
Before leaving the stall, my bladder reminded me that I really wanted to pee before helping Hana. I was going to ask her to leave first, but thinking that she just showed me everything, I decided otherwise.<br />
<br />
“Hey, I just need to pee first, let&#39;s change positions.” Rotating counterclockwise, I reached the toilet and Hana stood with her back against the door. Since I didn’t have any panties, I just raised my dress, sat down and let the urine flow. Hana’s gaze fixated between my legs and with a red face, stared at the flow from start to end. When my pee finished striking the bowl, she had already prepared a tissue for me so I just took it and patted myself dry<br />
<br />
After washing our hands, I took my bag with me and we quickly walked to the bathroom of the main building. I felt extremely exposed walking through the hallways in a skirt and without panties, the air touching my pussy directly while in public started to make me feel a bit weird.<br />
<br />
When we reached the bathroom the bell for the end of the lunch was already ringing but I took a few minutes to dry Hana’s panties. After they were dry, I put them on and we ran to the classroom. We were the last two to arrive, but luckily since the teacher hadn&#39;t started the class yet, we weren’t late.<br />
<br />
In the moment I just acted in a rush, but for the rest of the day I could not think on anything else but Hana’s period and that we just exchanged panties</p>
