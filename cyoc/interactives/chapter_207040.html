<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...a Private Transfer room. That way we can enjoy the process fully without...&quot; she broke off, chuckling slightly, &quot;...being interrupted.&quot;<br />
<br />
She released your cock, and you both tucked your genitals away. She took your hand and led you through a set of double doors marked &quot;PRIVATE TRANSFERS.&quot; On the other side was a carpeted space that looked vaguely like a hotel&#39;s reception area. Low couches were arranged in L-shapes with side tables and reading lights. A couple of plush chairs were occupied by people reading through brochures. Against one wall stood a desk, with a carpeted path on either side leading into a hallway beyond.<br />
<br />
The pair of you walked up to the desk, behind which stood shelves filled with bottles with inscrutable labels. Two employees in lab coats appeared - a taller woman with refined features and a stout man with a cheerful smile below a bushy mustache.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening, friends!&quot; said the woman, as her companion continue to smile. &quot;This is the Private Transfer center. Here, you can take full advantage of our offerings in the privacy of our fully furnished suites. We&#39;ll supply you with targeted lotions, salves, or potions as needed. Follow the simple instructions and enjoy the results! What are you two interested in today?&quot;<br />
<br />
The redhead responded, &quot;We&#39;re here to transfer masculinity.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman smiled, while her companion looked the two of you up and down, glancing at the shelves of bottles. &quot;Of course,&quot; said the woman. &quot;Is this a complete or partial transfer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Complete!&quot; said the redhead. &quot;It&#39;s time for me to finally get rid of this thing between my legs.&quot; She pointed at her groin with both hands, her erection clearly straining against her boyshorts. You noticed your own erection had faded since the redhead had stopped stroking your cock.<br />
<br />
The woman turned to you. &quot;And you are prepared to accept this person&#39;s masculinity, however much of it there may be? It might be a bit of an intense experience, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
You frowned. &quot;Why do you say that? She told me the same thing,&quot; you said, gesturing at your companion.<br />
<br />
The man behind the desk finally spoke up. His voice was slightly raspy, with something of a New York accent. Though it was perhaps unexpected given the circumstances and the lab coat, it fit his demeanor. &quot;Remember puberty?&quot; he said. &quot;Remember how your body and mind were caught in this hormonal frenzy for a few years? Looking at this one here,&quot; he gestured at the redhead, &quot;you&#39;re going to be absorbing quite a bit of masculine essence over, like, a few minutes. It&#39;s not just taking someone&#39;s cock and slapping those inches onto yours. It&#39;s a whole gestalt. It&#39;ll fuck with your very spirit, not to get too technical here.&quot;<br />
<br />
He paused as he saw the expression on your face. &quot;But don&#39;t worry. It&#39;ll feel real good. It&#39;ll be a bit of a ride, but it&#39;ll feel real, real good.&quot; He glanced at the redhead, whose nipples were tenting against the fabric of her bra. &quot;For you too. Don&#39;t worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
You hesitated slightly. The man was clearly trying to look reassuring, but the woman&#39;s expression was less clear. Was there some anxiety showing on her forehead? &quot;It&#39;s safe, right?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
The man and woman spoke at once, stopped, and then the woman continued. &quot;It&#39;s perfectly safe. Actually, to be honest with you, this kind of transfer is one of the more fun ones for us. I love seeing the results when people walk out of our rooms. And if you don&#39;t like the results, we can always reset you to the way you were when you arrived... with or without your partner.&quot;<br />
<br />
The redhead lifted her hand to her forehead in mock offense. &quot;What, you mean to say that my relationship with this lovely fellow might not last? Why, we&#39;ve come all this way together? Nearly... ten minutes so far! We&#39;ve already admired each other&#39;s cocks and pretty soon we&#39;ll even be on a first-name basis, and you know how serious that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
You turned to her, realizing she was right: neither of you had made introductions. You opened your mouth to give your name and the redhead quickly rose a finger to your lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to know,&quot; she said. &quot;That&#39;s part of the fun, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
You smiled and nibbled her fingertip lightly. &quot;Fair enough,&quot; you said. You turned to the staff behind the desk. &quot;Let&#39;s do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man and woman smiled at you, and the man strode over to the shelves, grabbing a couple of bottles half-full with differently colored liquids. He took the bottles over to a table with a mess of lab equipment: tubing, pipettes, a burner, and a carton of smaller flasks, all empty. He took pains to measure out contributions from each of the larger bottles carefully, running them through what looked like a warm water bath before stoppering off a mixture in a pair of flasks which he then brought back to the desk. He gave one to the redhead, and one to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;The instructions are simple,&quot; he said. &quot;Take off your clothes first, that&#39;s very important. Then drink your medicine. The rest will come naturally.&quot; He gave you a confidence smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Room 6 is free,&quot; said the woman. &quot;Have fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
You strode off down the hallway, arm-in-arm with the redhead. Room 6 was cozy. The floor space was dominated by a large bed with plush pillows. A mirror was mounted on the wall opposite the bed and on the ceiling. On each side was a small door leading to a bathroom.<br />
<br />
The two of you looked at each other, excitement and anticipation and a hint of anxiety swirling through your mind and body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they did say we had to strip first, right?&quot; said the redhead, pulling off her bra. You both pulled down your shorts. Seeing your companion&#39;s breasts, large, round, and capped with deliciously suckable pink nipples returned some of the blood to your cock.<br />
<br />
The two of you watched your erection grow until it was straining in the air. You opened your flask. &quot;Time to drink this, I suppose,&quot; you said. &quot;Cheers!&quot; You clinked your flask against hers, and drank the contents in a single swallow.<br />
<br />
You immediately felt a warmth in your stomach, a gentle tingling that contrasted with the slightly cool air. You felt your cock jump at the thought of the process beginning. The warmth spread in all directions, a slow, oozing feeling of tingling sensitivity that travelled through your back and chest, delighting your nipples and making the hair on your neck stand on end. As the warm travelled downward, your cock began to throb slightly more insistently. Your balls felt heavier, as though you could feel them churning out a particularly thick batch of cum. As the warmth spread through your legs down to your feet, you felt a sudden urge to lie down, as though your legs simply did not want to support your weight any more.<br />
<br />
You laid on the bed, your cock sticking straight up in the air. One hand began to stroke it slowly. You looked over at the redhead. She was still standing, though she had moved to be next to the bed, her cock pointing straight at your body as she jerked a hand up and down its length. Her eyes were closed and she let loose a small moan. Her hand began to stroke faster as her cock jumped and seemed to get even harder. As you gazed at her, you noticed that she almost seemed to be shimmering slightly -- was she glowing? You looked down. Your cock had the same sort of appearance: a slight glow, almost like a heat haze. Her breasts jiggled back and forth as she stroked, faster and faster. You noticed that you were stroking slightly faster as well. Not to the extent that she was, but still accelerating. You tried to change pace and realized that you weren&#39;t in control of that hand.<br />
<br />
The transfer process had begun.</p>
