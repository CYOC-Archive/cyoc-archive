<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sierra Belville rang the doorbell in front of Meadow Larkin&#39;s apartment. Sierra hoped going to the movies with perky, bubbly Meadow would take her mind off of the ungodly nightmare that was the past week.<br />
<br />
Sierra came from a wealthy, conservative family. Her mother was hardly what a person would call body positive. When she wasn&#39;t praising the latest fad diet, Mrs. Belville was complaining about &quot;angry, hairy, wannabe-male feminazis.&quot; When Sierra&#39;s body hair had begun to grow in at the onset of puberty, the girl had been absolutely enchanted. It was all so beautiful and soft! Mrs. Belville, however, was another story. She told her daughter that female body hair was ugly and disgusting, and that she would never find a boyfriend if she didn&#39;t get rid of it. Sierra had wisely kept her mouth shut. Being the daughter of Sharon Wheatley Belville meant keeping your mouth shut about a lot of things. It was then that Mrs. Belville introduced Sierra to the razors and the concept of shaving. Oh the endless shaving! Shaving her legs, her armpits, even her pussy! Sierra grimly reflected on those times, remembering how her 12-year-old self always felt like she was betraying her own body whenever she was made to shear off her precious, beautiful hairs. If only she had known then about the betrayal the future had in store...<br />
<br />
Things had gotten better for Sierra when she went off to university. She became friends with a cute hippie girl named Meadow Larkin and a badass punk called Krystal Brock. They&#39;d both been super nice to her and helped her understand that she was beautiful the way she was born and encouraged her desire to grow out her body hair away from the prying eyes of her ogress of a mother. She listened and loved being hairy. Sometimes she would lie in bet all morning just running her fingers through her lush, soft armpit hair. She even had a few girlfriends who were totally into her girlfur. Life was sweet... and hairy.<br />
<br />
Then it all went horribly wrong. Sierra had a nasty breakup with her girlfriend Alejandra Salazar, who got revenge by phoning Mrs. Belville and telling her EVERYTHING: their lesbian relationship, Sierra&#39;s rebellious new friends... and the body hair. Bitch. When Mrs. Belville contacted her daughter, she was furious. She ordered Sierra not to simply shave her body hair, but to have it laser removed so she could never grow it out again. Sierra had tried to refuse, but her mother threatened to disown her and get her blacklisted from every job she applied for. Terrified out of her wits, Sierra reluctantly agreed.<br />
<br />
Sierra had gotten the procedure done just last Monday. Tears streamed down her face. She felt like a stranger in her own body. She mournfully felt her armpit, smooth as a baby&#39;s. All that gorgeous sexy hair... gone. Forever. Sierra wondered if this was how a lion would feel if he lost his mane. Probably. She reached down below her designer shorts and felt her horrifically smooth leg. Crying again, she dried her tears on her long red tresses, the only hair left on her body besides her eyebrows and eyelashes.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the door was answered by Meadow in a towel. She was smiling just as cheerfully as ever, perhaps a bit more. She&#39;d obviously been getting some pussy action, perhaps with Krystal; the punk had been secretly crushing on Meadow for, like, forever. About damn time she went for it. But there was something different about Meadow. She looked off... but a good off. What had changed?<br />
<br />
Then it hit Sierra. Oodles of dark hair was spilling out of Meadow&#39;s armpits, and her arms and legs were so hairy that they looked like four mossy tree trunks. Sierra blinked. This didn&#39;t make any sense. Try as she might, Meadow had never been able to grow much body hair. She&#39;d always been jealous of Sierra&#39;s ample carpet. Now look at her! Even Meadow&#39;s upper lip looked a bit hairy. Where had all this sweet fur come from?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiya, Sierra!&quot; Meadow chirped. She suddenly squinted at Sierra. &quot;What in Gaia&#39;s name happened to your legs? They&#39;re all bald! You start shaving again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Worse!&quot; groaned Sierra. &quot;Mom bullied me into getting it lasered! I know what you&#39;re gonna say, Mead. I should&#39;ve stood up to her, right? Maybe, but you don&#39;t know what a woman as rich as her can threaten you with. So yeah, this is me now: smooth and bald as a baby&#39;s ass. It sucks and I hate it!&quot; Sierra kicked the doorframe in frustration. &quot;But what about you, huh? Just look at you, girl! Hairy as hell! Much more of that fur and you&#39;d be a sasquatch! I love it, but what gives? You been taking hormones in the two weeks since we last hung out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Meadow beamed. &quot;I&#39;ve got something way better than hormones, Sierra.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is it, Mead?&quot; called Krystal&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Sierra, Krys!&quot; Meadow called back. &quot;And she needs our help!&quot; She turned back to Sierra. &quot;Come on in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sierra followed Meadow into her apartment, getting swatted in the face by a dreamcatcher in the process. She found a naked Krystal sprawled out on the sofa, idly stroking her aroused pussy. &quot;Hey there, Sierra!&quot; the punk called. &quot;Ya picked a kinda shitty time to come over, but—&quot; Krystal&#39;s green eyes bugged out as the took in Sierra&#39;s hairless body. &quot;Holy shitballs, Sierra! What the motherfucking hell happened to your leg hair?! You were just talking about how much you loved it two weeks ago! Said you&#39;d never shave again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom happened!&quot; Sierra groaned. &quot;She basically told me she&#39;d make sure I&#39;d never work again if I didn&#39;t laser off my body hair. I&#39;ve been crying ever since. I&#39;ve lost an integral part of myself forever!&quot; Fresh tears streamed down her pale face, and she buried her face in her fiery red hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; said Meadow as she dropped her towel, revealing her hairy nipples and giant pussy bush to Sierra. &quot;I know how to fix this.&quot; She picked up a brush from the coffee table. &quot;Krys, take your fingers out of your pussy and let me brush it. I think Sierra could use a demonstration.&quot;<br />
<br />
Krystal paused her masturbation and spread her legs, giving Meadow and Sierra a clear view of her narrow landing strip. Meadow kneeled in front of the sofa. She carefully brushed the bare spots around the landing strip, causing short blonde hairs to sprout. Krystal moaned orgasmically as the ticklish hairs grew in. Sierra gasped as the magic did its work. Krystal now had what appeared to be a full bush, albeit a neatly trimmed one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Longer, Mead!&quot; pleaded. &quot;Give me a true cavewoman bush!&quot; Meadow nodded and began brushing Krystal&#39;s bush. Each brushstroke add a few more centimeters as well as more volume. Soon Krystal&#39;s pussy was completely obscured by a forest of dense, 3-1/2-inch-long pubic hair. Sierra loved it. It was like a natural bikini!<br />
<br />
Meadow moved on to the finishing touches. She gave the insides of Krystal&#39;s thighs a few brushstrokes, causing a fairly dense thicket of yellow hairs to curl their way out of the skin of Krystal&#39;s inner legs. Meadow then gave Krystal&#39;s lower abdomen the same treatment. After taking in the hypnotic moment of hair growth, she gave a few more strokes to a narrow strip from Krystal&#39;s bush to her bellybutton. She Sierra watched with arousal as a thick treasure trail of dark blonde hairs sprouted like coily weeds.<br />
<br />
Meadow stood up. &quot;That&#39;s all for now, Kryss,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#39;ll do the rest of your body later. We&#39;ve got to get started on poor Sierra. Just be content with your epic bush for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Krystal nodded. &quot;Okay, but don&#39;t forget, Mead. I REALLY fucking want that areola hair you&#39;re rocking! I&#39;ve never been able to grow any hairs there. And I want a hairy ass, too. Hey, how badass d&#39;you think I&#39;d look with a unibrow? Used to have a thin one in high school before dad put his foot down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meadow gave her friend a thumbs up. &quot;Got it!&quot; She turned to Sierra. &quot;As you can see, this is a magic brush that grows hair. I bought it from this groovy new shop to thicken my own body hair, but I think the Goddess had a higher reason for directing me there. To restore what you&#39;ve lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sierra began to sweat. &quot;But what if Mom finds out?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She won&#39;t,&quot; said Krystal. &quot;Even if she goes snooping around like a bitch, she&#39;ll find out you paid for the lasering and close the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sierra smiled. &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll need to strip now so I can start brushing,&quot; said Meadow. Sierra nodded and began to unbutton her shorts. It was going to happen! She was going to get her body hair back!</p>
