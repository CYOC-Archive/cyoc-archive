<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Dave turns the key in his car and ready to head to work his phone suddenly goes off with a bzzt. Giving an annoyed groan, he looks to the phone annoyed to see who was poking him right before work. His eyes scan over the message, his work buddies asking him if he wanted to go to the bar in a few hours.<br />
<br />
“Are they kidding me? We have a job to d-“ Dave blinks, before giving a halfway relived facepalm. Today was the day of the investors meeting, and the boss has given them a few days off because of it. He had been so worried about Erin that the tired worker completely forgot, leaning his head on the steering wheel with annoyance. Maybe it would of been better to have work today so he won’t feel obligated to fret about Erin and his 2D self.<br />
<br />
“He makes a crummy roommate like that, can’t pay for rent or even clean dishes...” Dave grumbles, his mind drifting back to the dream he had the night before. The dream version of Erin seemed almost ecstatic to be painted over, would the real one be as well? Erin didn’t seem against the idea when he told him, maybe even a bit intrigued? “Heh, maybe then he would at least provide some entertainment.” Dave chuckles to himself, opening the car door as the young adult walks back into the house.<br />
<br />
Erin leans back in the canvas as he tries to rub one out, being 2D was a dream of his and now that it was true he couldn’t even get off? He curses his luck as he flops over annoyed, wishing that he asked Dave to paint something for him to not be so bored. Even being horny all the time wasn’t enough for him. About to try again, Erin hears the loud clunk of the door, sitting up with the noise being the telltale sign of Dave returning, having stayed over at his house multiple times to hear. Dave walks back into the room while giving a look to the canvas which currently housed his flat friend who waved to him. Dave glances back at the door, the memory of the pizza man still fresh in his mind. Erin couldn’t help but to continue rubbing himself however, feeling on edge from the constant experience of his fetish come true. <br />
<br />
Dropping off his keys, Dave heads to the phone to ring up Erins college. He wonders what he should say, that he was sick? In the hospital?... missing? He shakes his head, knowing he would have to say something as he dials the school.<br />
<br />
“Hello, this is Midterm College. Are you calling to let a teacher know of your absence?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, yes see my friend Erin Talon is um...” Dave wracks his mind, trying to think of a good excuse, however the person on the other sigh just sighs.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure they have a great reason... let me check which class he is in.”<br />
<br />
Dave sits at the call for a few minutes before the receptionist responds.<br />
<br />
“Look, there’s no Erin Talon on any of our classes or files. Either you’re just wasting our time or you called the wrong school.” Dave sat at the phone confused, shaking his head.<br />
<br />
“Well... thank you anyways...”<br />
<br />
Dave hangs up and starts to call anyone else who knew Erin, friends and family alike didn&#39;t recognize his name as Dave realized just what happened. Erin was gone to anyone else besides him, so whatever he did nobody would ever know... dismissing the thought as he heads back to the living room.<br />
<br />
 Dave walks over to Erin’s flat home and catches him unaware as Dave places his hand on the side of the frame. Erin freezes, forced still once more with his hand down his pants.<br />
<br />
“I-I-ca plai-“ <br />
<br />
“Quiet... I need to concentrate on moving this. I don’t want a repeat of last night...” Dave says with annoyance, Erin feeling the familiar stiffness as he couldn’t even talk. Dave unhinged the canvas and carefully takes it up to his room, Erin feeling jumbled as everything was moving around him. He was surprised he wasn’t dizzy, or even hungry or tired, being in the painting seemed to have removed all need for such. After a few minutes of jostling, Erin found himself placed in Dave’s room, the entire place filled head to toe with random junk and art supplies. Figurines and cards lay scattered about as Dave lays the canvas on an easel. <br />
<br />
Dave let’s go of the painting, Erin feeling himself able to move once more as he quickly removes his hand from the embarrassing position, his semi painted look giving a blush. “...” Erin tries to speak, realizing that Dave never gave the command to let him, forced to stare at the artist with confusion.<br />
<br />
“So I got good news and maybe bad news. Good news is that for the next couple of days I don’t have work so we can figure this out, maybe bad news is that for some reason you have been seemingly forgotten by everyone and everything. Not even databases have you on file anymore though I’m guessing it will go back to normal once you get out.”<br />
<br />
Erin’s eyes widen as what Dave said hit him, he didn’t exist in the world right now. The only person who knew of his existence was Dave, and he could do anything he wished to him without repercussions. However instead of scaring Erin, the idea instead made him even more aroused. He was not just 2D but now literally owned by someone, Erin gives a small quiver of lust as he lays on that thought, his hand once more reaching downwards before Erin remembered that he had an audience. Dave rubs his forehead, looking more amused than annoyed at Erin and his constant masturbation attempts as a familiar idea forms in his mind.<br />
<br />
“I’ll take that as good news then... say Erin, if you like getting off like that do you mind if I make it a more... pleasing experience for me as well?” Dave expertly flicks with a paintbrush as Erin watches, looking a bit nervous. “Don’t worry, I won’t do anything that you don’t want. Plus during my testing if I just paint you normally again you’ll come out fine. Plus you did seem interested in the idea of being a French maid...” Dave trails off, Erin starting to rub himself despite knowing that Dave was watching. The idea of having his form be changed not just into a woman, but anything was exciting to him, but also scary. What if it messed with his mind or he couldn’t go back... he thinks for a second, and then...</p>
