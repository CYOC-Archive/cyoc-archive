<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;My planet only has humanoid females&quot; the girl said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But aliens don't exist&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But 'aliens' do exist&quot; the girl said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't believe in aliens&quot; I said starting to get a little scared. This little girl had a device that could change me and she had quite an imagination. There was no telling what she'd change me into next.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will soon enough&quot; the girl said.<br />
<br />
Before I could say anything else white light flooded the bathroom and I wasn't able to see anything. It was about two seconds before the light disappeared. Strangely I was able to see right away again but what I saw was even more strange. I was no longer in my bathroom. Instead I was in a gold colored room with strange symbols on one wall. Standing at something that looked like a wide podium was a woman that looked to be about twenty-five. She came around the podium thing and I saw that she wasn't wearing any clothes. She looked at me and smiled then said &quot;You've done well Qa'chea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Mommy&quot; Qa'chea said taking off the clothes she was wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me introduce myself&quot; the woman said. &quot;I am Sa'chea and you have already met my daughter Qa'chea. I should tell you why you are here. I want another child but I am unable to carry a child. My mate carried her but she was killed in an explosion on one of our space stations. I was unable to find another suitable mate among my own people so I came to your planet. After being on your planet for a few weeks I came to the conclusion that I would have a hard time finding a suitable mate. We created the house and fire to find one who would be able to bond with me. That someone turned out to be you. You proved it when you tried to enter the burning house and then getting my daughter out.&quot;<br />
<br />
I shifted on my feet a little uncomfortably. Here I was in an apparently alien ship being told that I was a suitable candidate to be this alien woman's mate. Also, it looked like she expected me to carry her next child though I didn't see how we would be reproducing. I opened my mouth to talk but I couldn't say anything.<br />
<br />
Sa'chea saw that I wasn't going to say anything so she said &quot;I know that this is a lot for you to process and I hate to add to it but I need to ask something. Will you join me in the bonding ceremony?&quot;<br />
<br />
I was shocked. It sounded like she wanted to get married. I took a deep breath and said &quot;I think this is going way too fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand&quot; Sa'chea said. &quot;Take as much time as you need. We have five days until we get to Erathos and I'm certain that you'll have an answer before we arrive. Follow me to the pod.&quot;<br />
<br />
I shrugged and followed Sa'chea having nothing better to do. Walking along in a hall I kept seeing the strange symbols on the walls most often by doors. It took me a bit to figure out they were signs. We came to one door and went through it. Looking around I realized that it was the bridge of the ship. There was a large view port and I could see stars and Earth through it. Sa'chea sat down in a seat up front next to another woman. This woman looked to be about twenty years old. Qa'chea sat down in another seat and motioned for me to sit in one of the other empty seats. I did and just as I did Qa'chea said &quot;Incoming projectile launched from one of the satellites. Impact in ten seconds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sa'chea pushed a couple buttons. A green light appeared in front of us which reminded me of the hyper space window on the Stargate TV series. We suddenly accelerated into this light pushing me into the seat. Once the force of the acceleration wore off I asked &quot;What was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I activated our hyper light engines&quot; Sa'chea said. &quot;Sorry for not warning you about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at Qa'chea and asked &quot;How old are you Qa'chea?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I look like an eight year old girl on Earth but I am really twenty-four years old&quot; Qa'chea said surprising me.<br />
<br />
&quot;We age slower than humans&quot; Sa'chea said. &quot;I'm seventy-five and Ma'nok is sixty. Oh, Ma'nok is my sister. She took the family name of her mate otherwise she would be Ma'chea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well since I seem to be going to Erathos I have a few questions&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll be glad to answer them&quot; Ma'nok said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How far is Erathos from Earth?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fifty light years&quot; Qa'chea said.<br />
<br />
That answer shook me. We would be covering fifty light years in five days. After my shock wore off I asked &quot;How do you speak English?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just a coincidence that our spoken language is the same as your English&quot; Sa'chea said. &quot;You won't have any trouble communicating verbally. You will have to learn our written language so you can read and write it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay&quot; I said. &quot;How long is a year on Erathos?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's almost as long as a year on Earth&quot; Ma'nok said. &quot;It's 364 days long with each day being twenty-four hours long like Earth. Our year is divided into thirteen months of twenty-eight days. Each month is four weeks long and a week is seven days long.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at Qa'chea trying to decide if I should ask my next question. I decided to since she seemed more mature than her body suggested. &quot;How do you reproduce?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have male genitals too&quot; Sa'chea said standing up and turning around. She pointed to her crotch and a dick emerged from the hair where a dick should be. Seeing my stunned expression she said &quot;It's easier to see with no pubic hair.&quot; She nodded toward Qa'chea and when I looked I was surprised to see her sitting toward me with her legs spread so I could see her little slit or slits as the case maybe. There was the regular slit common to girls but on the front of her crotch was another slit. She reached into this slit with a couple fingers and pulled out a penis. Unlike her mother's her's was limp. Sa'chea continued &quot;Qa'chea won't be able to extrude her penis until she starts puberty. She has to pull it out until then. Now you have a penis too and you'll learn how to extrude it when you want and how to pull it back in when you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked down at my own crotch and moved my hand to it. Probing with a couple of fingers I found the slit and reaching in I touched the head of my penis. A shudder of pleasure ran through my body. It was more pleasurable now than it had been before. I took my hand away and tried not to move it back to experience more of the pleasure. It was hard to do though. To get my mind off of it I asked &quot;How long does a pregnancy last?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to scare you but our doctors go from the date of our last period&quot; Sa'chea said. &quot;With that the average pregnancy lasts 120 weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
That did scare me. My friend has a baby and she seemed to have been miserable during her pregnancy. She had said that it was forty weeks or about nine months. I couldn't understand how she was able to get through it. Now I was a woman and if I got pregnant it would be 120 weeks. That would be a little over two years of carrying a child around in me. I didn't think I could handle it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Sa'chea asked looking at me with genuine concern in her eyes.</p>
