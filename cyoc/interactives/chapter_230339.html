<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scott looked over the costume collection in their office. There were a lot of options. He could just start going through all the canines or big cats they had brought home? Lion manes looked fun? Foxes could be a fun way to push his small the costumes could go? He had a lot of options.<br />
<br />
He had enjoyed his time as Spot, but he had to admit that he was curious would it would feel like to be a large cat instead of a small dog. To have so much physical strength and yet still remain loyal to his roommate.<br />
<br />
In fact, the more he thought about it, the more excited the idea made him. He was going to a costume contest after all, and getting a realistic looking dog to rest beside you was easy - quite unlike a tiger, which would be nearly impossible without some costuming.<br />
<br />
Scott picked out the tiger costume and brought it downstairs, showing it to John as he said: &quot;Hey John, mind if I try out the tiger costume? It was a little tricky to get on by myself, just like Spot. But I figure it would be way cool to be a wizard with a tiger instead of a wizard with a dog, wouldn&#39;t you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott could swear he saw a small flash of uncertainty in John&#39;s eye, but John immediately gave a laugh and said: &quot;Yeah, I think you&#39;re right about that. Let&#39;s give it a try.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott wasn&#39;t sure how to react to the uncertainty he thought he saw, but then he put on a wide grin: &quot;Come on, it&#39;ll be rad as hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
This seemed to put John more at ease who started smiling mischievously.<br />
<br />
Scott turned the tiger over in his hands. It felt amazingly realistic, right down to the feel of the tiger&#39;s fur. It felt kind of like a big dog&#39;s fur. Scott had never touched a tiger before, so he didn&#39;t know if that was what a tiger&#39;s fur felt like, but somehow he felt it probably was.<br />
<br />
Unlike the dog costume, it was easy to see how he would fit into this costume. As a matter fact, it was way too large. He held it up on front him, looking at the mask and through the masks&#39;s eye holes. His head could fit two times in there, and the rest of him could probably fit three to four times in the rest of the costume. He noticed with this costume, unlike the dog costume, the zipper was in the back, but that wasn&#39;t really a huge issue, especially with John&#39;s help.<br />
<br />
John noticed Scott&#39;s amazement at the size of the costume: &quot;Remember, all sizes fit perfectly. Whether they look too large or too small, a snug fit is guaranteed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott unzipped the costume. He managed to find the clasp on the zipper, pulling it all the way down. Scott&#39;s foot slipped into the costume, reaching the bottom of it easily, but the leg was far larger than his own, so it sat somewhat loosely around it. He kept pulling up on the leg, and it started to feel as if the leg was shrinking, but when he looked at the costume&#39;s leg it strangely wasn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
As he kept pulling his heel was pulled up, elongating his feet and merging and padding his toes. Scott nervously wiggled his toes and saw the costume&#39;s toes spring to life.<br />
<br />
Excited but nervous, Scott held his costume against the table and inserted his other leg. The same exact sensations happened, and then he pulled the legs up over his own, causing the legs to reshape. It became hard to stand on his tip toes and he started leaning on the table, looking back over himself. The illusion was incredible, and became even more incredible as he pulled the tiger costume further up over his ass and saw the tail begin to swish behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;This costume is also really weird,&quot; Scott said it an exhausted, trailing voice.<br />
<br />
He lifted his left arm up and, leaning on his right hand, forced it as best he could. Each of his five fingers found their own spot in the glove, each corresponding to a digit in the paw. His thumb felt at an odd angle though. He kept using his right hand to pull and stretch the fabric over his left hand. It felt weird and it only got harder.<br />
<br />
John noticed his struggling and got over to help his friend. He put Scott&#39;s right arm into its proper glove, then went behind Scott saying &quot;Alright, there we go!&quot; as he furiously pulled back, stretching the costume far further back than it would seem he had to while simultaneously shoving Scott even further into the costume.<br />
<br />
The costume stretching taut. The suit started clinging to Scott&#39;s skin, stretching itself to fit him - or stretching him to fit the skin. Once John felt that he had been inserted properly he zipped up the costume.<br />
<br />
Somehow, despite all the extra apparent room behind Scott&#39;s back inside the costume, the costume kept its shape. Scott stretched forwards, pushing the table in front of him and landed on all four legs. When he stopped stretching he expected to go back to his normal size, but he didn&#39;t. Instead he maintained most of the length he had just gotten from stretching and the tiger costume&#39;s mask fell on top of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh yes, this feels amazing,&quot; Scott was grinning. John was also very impressed with the results.<br />
<br />
Scott was feeling a surge of power the likes of which he had never felt before. Every fiber of his being felt like it was ready to spring and coil to pounce with amazing force. Yes, he had lost his thumbs, but he had gained so much more. He swished his new tail and started wiggling his body, making ready to pounce, though he had no actual plans to do so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Silly, silly Scott,&quot; laughed John. &quot;You&#39;re not going to be pouncing any mice before we get that head on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
John walked over to Scott and unfolded the mask lying on top of his neck and pulled it into place of Scott. Scott&#39;s world was momentarily covered in darkness until the eye-holes lined up. Having the weight of the muzzle in the middle of his face yet again felt as odd as ever, and this time it was a far wider nose with massive whiskers. John pulled the mask tight against his jaws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, it&#39;s done,&quot; Scott tried to speak, but instead what came out was a chuff.</p>
