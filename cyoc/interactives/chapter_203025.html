<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy loved playing soccer. He played it throughout middle school and now he was looking forward to playing it some more in high school. He was lucky that there was a small soccer team for boys at his school, since most boys decided to join the football team instead. <br />
<br />
He always thought he was small and too short to play football, plus he hated getting tackled and thrown to the ground all the time. That’s where soccer was the perfect sport for him, since it was mostly non-contact and all he had to do was kick a soccer ball using his cleats. There was usually little contact with the other players and the strategy involved more shooting and passing the ball to others. It was perfect for him in the end. <br />
<br />
Playing soccer involved a lot of passing and shooting drills during PE class, which was fine by him. There were several other members of the team who were in his class as well, and they often got to practice their shots on the soccer field while all the other kids played basketball or dodge ball inside of the gymnasium. A few kids even went into the weight room to work out, but Andy was never interested in that. He just wanted to be on the soccer field with his cleats on his feet, kicking a ball into a goal. <br />
<br />
Soccer involved a lot of running and jumping. Plus, he had to use his legs all the time. So, it was no wonder that he was drenched in sweat once he entered the locker room following a grueling practice session in the hot sun. What was even more astonishing was the fact that, once he removed his clothes and got ready to take a shower, his muscles were aching and feeling sore all over, especially his legs. But it didn’t end there. <br />
<br />
Andy sat in on his American history class after playing soccer, and his muscles were still feeling sore from practice. Not just his legs, but his abdominal muscles, his arms and his chest were hurting as well, which seemed strange to him. Why would all his muscles be hurting like this? As he sat in this boring class, he constantly had the feeling that his t-shirt was feeling tighter and tighter. I was as if his arms and chest were constantly and gradually expanding on his body. He could explain the reason his jeans were feeling tight, after an hour of soccer, but why were his arms and chest feeling so tight as well? <br />
<br />
The pain was getting so great that Andy almost raised his hand to request a hall pass when his t-shirt ripped apart, tearing right down the middle from the collar to the abdominal section, right after Andy had taken a deep breath. <br />
<br />
CRRRRAAAAACKKK… RRRRRIIIIIIPPPPPPPPP!!!!!<br />
<br />
As the shirt tore apart, it left a big, gaping hole in the thin, cotton fabric, leaving Andy’s large, round, and bulging pectorals exposed. You could clearly see his deep cleavage, separating the two big pecs, in addition to the impressive, well-defined six-pack abdominal muscles, which were readily visible for everyone in the classroom to see after the loud tears of his t-shirt. Of course, everyone burst out in laughter.<br />
<br />
“Andrew! Please wear a shirt when you’re in my history class!” the teacher said to him. <br />
<br />
“I was… I AM wearing a shirt! It’s just… My chest just burst out of the shirt and tore it apart… Right here, in the middle of class! I couldn’t help it!” Andy tried to explain to the history teacher. <br />
<br />
“Well, class will be over in ten minutes. Please bring a new shirt to school tomorrow. And bring an extra shirt just in case your muscles decide to burst out of your clothing again, is that understood?” the teacher hissed. <br />
<br />
“Yes, sir. I’m sorry!” Andy sighed, feeling very embarrassed. He had not expected his pecs to blow out of his t-shirt during class. On the other hand, several of the girls were staring at him, giggling over his big, bulging muscles. <br />
<br />
When the bell finally rang, he immediately grabbed his book and his backpack as he left the classroom and rushed through the hallway as quickly as possible. It was bad enough to be seen with a torn shirt in class, let alone being seen in the hallway by hundreds of other students. Unfortunately, several other students did see him, a few of them snapping pictures of him with their cell phones as he rushed out the door so he could get home. <br />
<br />
Once he got home, he showered and put on comfortable sweats, which were big and roomy on him. He was starving, so he ate several sandwiches before tackling some homework assignments at his desk in his bedroom. Finally, he retreated to his bedroom where he shut off the lights and crawled in bed, only to doze off almost immediately. <br />
<br />
Little did he know that muscles would grow overnight, making him even bigger and stronger. He would notice the changes when he got up, hours later, the next morning. </p>
<hr/><h3>
Which changes would he realize after he wakes up the following morning?</h3>
