<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David zipped up his duffel bag. The sound made Jason flinch, ears flattening. His heart beat faster. Every sound was too loud, too sharp. The TV flickered in front of him, but it might as well have been static.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to stay at my aunt&#39;s place. It&#39;s a good thing she&#39;s out of town,&quot; David said quietly.<br />
<br />
Jason’s nostrils flared. He caught the faintest trace of David’s scent. It made his cock twitch in his sheath. His chest ached.<br />
<br />
He nodded. &quot;I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
David hesitated. &quot;I’ll call you tomorrow. Just… to check in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
The door clicked shut.<br />
<br />
Jason’s ears rotated, searching for something that wasn’t there. The absence of David’s scent hit him like a slap.  His body trembled, half-aroused, overwhelmed by need.<br />
<br />
He paced—sometimes nose to floor, sniffing out the ghost trails of David’s musk. He whined low in his throat, a sound pulled from some deeper part of himself. Logic told him to stop. His body didn’t listen.<br />
<br />
He found a shirt—David’s, still faintly damp from the gym—and dragged it to the couch. He buried his face in it. His cock emerged, dripping. He licked at the shirt absentmindedly, then caught himself and curled into a tighter ball, ashamed and still aching.<br />
<br />
By midnight, he’d built a den from cushions. He settled into it, panting. His sheath was full. His balls throbbed. He didn’t touch himself. He couldn’t. The rules were clear. But he whimpered until sleep took him.<br />
<br />
The phone buzzed at dawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; David said, voice raw.<br />
<br />
Jason perked up instantly, tail thudding against the floor. Just hearing his voice made his cock swell again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn’t sleep,&quot; David said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me neither.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason licked his lips, trying not to pant.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought getting space would help,&quot; David continued. &quot;But it feels like it&#39;s getting worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason’s voice caught. His throat felt tight. He hung up before he said something he couldn’t take back.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
David knocked at eight.<br />
<br />
&quot;I forgot my laptop charger,&quot; he said quickly when Jason opened the door. But his voice was tight, strained. His eyes flicked over Jason’s body, already reading the tension there, the hunger.<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s on the table,&quot; Jason said, but didn’t move.<br />
<br />
David stepped inside. Their arms brushed.<br />
<br />
That was enough.<br />
<br />
Jason growled low, his body shifting forward, tail flicking behind him. David didn’t speak. He just grabbed Jason and kissed him, mouths crashing together like a dam bursting.<br />
<br />
Jason&#39;s shirt tore as it came off. His cock throbbed free from its sheath, already slick, already pulsing. David’s hands were on him—hot, rough, trembling. Jason whimpered as his back hit the wall, then the couch, then David&#39;s weight settled against him.<br />
<br />
They didn’t talk. They couldn’t.<br />
<br />
Jason dropped to his knees, muzzle brushing the flared tip of David’s shaft. It was thicker now—wider, darker, impossibly hard. A deep, primal sound rumbled in David’s chest.<br />
<br />
Jason opened his mouth, lapping at the tip, feeling it pulse in response. David groaned, gripping Jason’s head gently but with growing urgency. Jason couldn’t take much, but he didn’t need to. His tongue worked lower, over the medial ring, down to where the shaft disappeared into a sheath.<br />
<br />
Jason turned and crawled onto the couch, presenting himself. His tail rose without conscious command. David was there immediately, hands gripping Jason’s hips. His cock pressed forward—and Jason moaned.<br />
<br />
The first push burned, but it fed the fire.<br />
<br />
David made a strange nickering sound behind him, his voice deeper now. His body moved with new force, new weight. Jason clawed at the cushions, head down, ass up. His cock dripped freely below him, untouched. He didn’t need to stroke. The rhythm, the pressure, the sheer overwhelming scent of David was enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... fuck... yes...&quot; Jason moaned, words disintegrating into whines, into need.<br />
<br />
David thrust harder. His ears twitched. His body trembled.<br />
<br />
Jason came hard, muzzle parting in a sharp bark as his cock exploded in ropes onto the couch, onto his fur, onto nothing at all. The orgasm tore through him like lightning.<br />
<br />
David followed with a final thrust, letting out a low, shuddering bray as his cock throbbed deep inside Jason, seed pumping with each spasm. Jason felt the flare lock them together for a moment, the heat of it unforgettable. He was amazed to have taken it all.<br />
<br />
They collapsed next to each other, panting, slick with sweat and still trembling.<br />
<br />
And then the changes began.<br />
<br />
Fur thickened down Jason&#39;s legs, dark and dense, sweeping over his calves and thighs. The sensation prickled like fire beneath his skin, but it didn’t hurt—just itched with urgency.<br />
<br />
His tail wagged uncontrollably. Then his face pushed forward all at once, bone and cartilage cracking subtly beneath the surface as his muzzle finally completed its shift. His nostrils stretched and flared at the end of a blunt, canine snout. His teeth ached briefly as his canines lengthened further, fully adapted for a new kind of bite.<br />
<br />
Short black fur spread rapidly across his cheeks, his forehead, and up over his scalp, replacing hair entirely. His ears stretched higher, now fully upright and mobile, pivoting to every sound with perfect clarity. Only his chest, arms, and hands remained smooth, still human enough to remind him what he was losing.<br />
<br />
David groaned as the heat surged through him. His nose flared wider, darkening and moistening, while his upper lip pulled back involuntarily to reveal thickening teeth. His jaw pushed forward subtly, reshaping—not into a muzzle, but into a distinctly equine taper. His ears lengthened and flicked backward.<br />
<br />
A sheen of short gray fur spread from his groin, crawling up his stomach in uneven waves, growing denser along his thighs and over his hips. His balls swelled against his groin, darker, heavier, churning from the inside. Jason could see the muscle knitting itself deeper into David&#39;s legs—his calves thickened, knees shifting higher. His toes flexed, cracking audibly, feet reshaping into the blunt beginnings of hooves.<br />
<br />
Jason stared, panting. The air reeked of musk, magic, and need.<br />
<br />
David’s eyes fluttered open—wider now, the brown deepened with gold flecks like polished amber. He looked down at Jason with something between awe and confusion, breath ragged, chest heaving with every inhale.<br />
<br />
Jason felt his own sheath pulse in time with David’s heartbeat.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can’t do this again,&quot; Jason whispered.<br />
<br />
David pulled him closer. &quot;But it felt like the only thing that made sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason didn’t respond. He was too busy listening to the rhythm of David&#39;s breath, still syncing to his own.</p>
