<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rose eagerly kissed to Nate as the two seemed to awaken from a night of passionate lovemaking in a rather amorous mood. Some of it had been long building since their transformations completed, and Nate being a &quot;crown prince&quot; had nothing to do with it. Some of it was a bit of jealousy at all the glowing reviews of mer-sex that Kenny and Kelly had given it, but a lot of it was real love that had been there. The two of them had been inseparable through their college years and Rose had been happy that her family and friends approved of Nate. It was something that contributed to the fact that cruise that Sam had secured on his family&#39;s yacht had included as many as there was, and Rose was not shy about sharing her planned goals with regard to her future with Nate, especially with regard to talking with Taylor.<br />
<br />
Becoming a mermaid didn&#39;t change that, particularly when Nate revealed he had plans to propose to her before his heritage could be confirmed. Their love was still there and even grew, the biggest change was going to be some of the specific changes that Nate was going to have to experience as a result of the doctor that had supervised his and his friends transformations into merpeople that Nate was in face a lost prince in their society. It brought all sorts of changes that went beyond just learning about how basic laws worked, technology, medical science, and so on, but added responsibilities that would come as a result of a &quot;royal marriage.&quot; And that added to some of their personal stresses, but getting her engagement neckless the previous afternoon was enough for Rose to be ready... and that desire was still there.<br />
<br />
And as Rose watched a sort of &quot;vent&quot; that was at Nate&#39;s waist open to reveal a long and thick penis telescoping out of it, she could see that Nate was still feeling very amorous as well. His hand&#39;s drifting to her bosom added to it, and made Rose moan softly, as memories of their pleasure filled night came back to her and confirmed what Kenny and Kelly had said about what sex was like as a merperson, though Rose also had to admit privately that she didn&#39;t think that either of them were experts on sex, even before becoming merpeople, but it did feel good.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; Rose said to Nate as she felt her own &quot;vent&quot; open and exposing her vagina to the water around them in their bedroom and her pelvic fins vibrating a little in anticipation of Nate positioning his body to resume their love making session as the new day started. <br />
<br />
And it was something that had been part of the anatomy lessons they&#39;d got as their transformations began and re-emphasized as they began learning more as part of their acclimation lessons. For while merpeople had features that mixed fish and human beings, many parts of their bodies had more in common with whales and dolphins. While their dorsal side at their waist could look like they still had their &quot;butt&quot; was where it had been when they were human, but in reality it had moved to that vent on the front of their tails. That was similar to what Rose knew of whales and dolphins, with the obvious difference between merpeople and whales/dolphins was that their tails had fish scales and they had the additional fins that were more fish like.  Though, those specific details weren&#39;t too much to worry about.<br />
<br />
Some of the bigger changes were more in the bone structure. When their group were &quot;attacked&quot; by the specialized fish that started their transformation into merpeople, they still had two legs that were pulled inside the long &quot;stomach&quot; of the fish that bit them. However, while they still had their human hips, likely a result of the fact of a vertical orientation when floating in one place, after their transformations they didn&#39;t have their leg bones anymore. Or at least they didn&#39;t have them as &quot;leg bones&quot; wrapped in a fish tail. It was more that their spinal cord lengthened from her hips and running he length of her tail, with the ray like bones making up her tail flukes. It let her swim far more effectively and even pivot in the water in ways she never would have expected. She also found out the previous night that this also created various pleasurable outcomes in that the angle of Nate&#39;s penis being thrust into her often changed how the pleasure was felt and was part of why it had felt so good.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I love you too,&quot; Nate answered as he slowly thrust his penis into Rose&#39;s ready opening. While he didn&#39;t know how long Rose had been waiting for him the previous evening, but he got the sense that she was more than ready physically and as he felt the &quot;ankle&quot; fins grip the end of Nate&#39;s tail as he eased himself into Rose, he could also tell that her arousal came on quickly and she was ready quickly. He could even see her nipples being fully erect, even after a few kisses and rather light attempts at for-play, that she was ready. Particularly as she wasn&#39;t flinching in pain at his penis stretching her vagina.<br />
<br />
The two kissed again, with both of them shuddering in pleasure as they felt each other&#39;s fins grip at the other&#39;s tails. It was like the scales of their tails opposite where their partner&#39;s fins were were pleasure centers and that it was more than just the thrusts made as they gripped each other with their arms and fins, but that added contact. It raised the levels of passion and Rose loved it as she nibbled at Nate&#39;s neck and as he massages her breasts and flicked at her nipples, all while managed to thrust their tails forward and back. They also twisted their tails slightly sot that Nate&#39;s penis changed its angle of entry into Rose&#39;s vagina, only driving their passion on with some heavy moans soon coming from both of them. Rose mentally loving how deep Nate&#39;s voice had become, in addition to the massive rod stretching her lower lips that he&#39;d grown as a result of becoming a merman. Of course she also expected Nate was happy with her enlarged bust, as becoming a mermaid had taken her from a decent sized B to a small C cup to a clearly D cup, possibly larger, chest. Amanda was still bigger than her in that department, but after becoming a mermaid that difference wasn&#39;t as pronounced as it was before they all became merpeople.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harder... Nate...&quot; Rose moaned out feeling her whole body quiver in orgasm and with another building, &quot;Harder!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... my precious, Rose!&quot; Nate moaned back and doubled his efforts and feeling his penis being to twitch inside her<br />
<br />
They kept at it as Nate could feel his only pleasure building, particularly as Rose did her best to lay kisses not only his lips but on his neck and upper chest  and shoulders while rubbing her hands on pectoral muscles. She only paused in this when he brought her to another amazing orgasm which made her whole tail and body shake, and in turn aroused him further.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost...&quot; Nate managed as he gazed into Rose&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
Rose tried to gaze back, but her eyes fluttered a little bit as their passions had built, her orgasms were coming in more rapid fashion as she could feel Nate&#39;s penis beginning to twitch as his own climax was liking coming. It was wonderful and she loved every second of it, and could understand what Kenny and Kelly had liked about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Nate,&quot; Rose managed in between pleasure filled moans. And from there, both of them soon felt their final climax of their morning love making session. With a hearty &quot;oh yes&quot; both grasped each other closely as Rose thrust her hips forward and tried to pull as much of Nate&#39;s penis into her as she could. And as their hips met, Rose felt her body shudder in orgasm again as Nate erupted inside her again. After a few moments they relaxed a bit and simply laid together.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; Nate said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re very handsome,&quot; Rose replied, &quot;before and after you became a merman... and a prince.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically, you could say I was always a prince,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;but didn&#39;t know it... though there is so much about being here and knowing who I am... or who I am to be...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s overwhelming?&quot; Rose asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Nate agreed, &quot;new responsibilities, new expectations, all sorts things... a new name.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose nodded at the last part. She didn&#39;t think she&#39;d called him &quot;Cain&quot; at any point during their love making session during the previous night, but then, they were at it for so long that it was possible. The sex did feel that good, and it was possible that she did call it out at some point, particularly as Nate&#39;s biological parents and most of the others that they&#39;d met continued to refer to him as Crown Prince Cain, a name Rose had never known Nate by before. Until the merpeople determined Nate was a lost prince, she&#39;d always known him as Nathan Waterson.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s one of the things that... bothers me,&quot; Rose answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name, but I&#39;m still me,&quot; Nate answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but no one ever called you Cain on the human world, not when we met, not when we went on dates, not when you met my family, not when we had sex for the first time,&quot; Rose answered, &quot;You were always Nate... and here... it&#39;s like many of the guards, your parents, and others look at me... or our friends in an odd way when we call you Nate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I suppose many of them were living with the stories of what my biological uncle did, and thus they knew an infant Prince Cain,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;I&#39;d think many of them can&#39;t understand why I would have been given a different name or why I wouldn&#39;t keep the name I was given... not knowing that I have very little memories of when I was little, and all of them come AFTER I was on land as a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate cuddled himself to Rose and she hugged him back.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that doesn&#39;t make me or the others wrong?&quot; Rose asked, &quot;Does it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;I was actually thinking on this all through the past couple of days, with Sam, Taylor, and Amanda off to see her mom and Kat... our lessons here, and so on... maybe I could ask my dad about a legal change of name for people to recognize. Have it hyphenated between both the name you and the others have known for years and the name the merpeople here remember. After all... with that official conference that had us announced as part of my return... and engaged to the most beautiful woman and mermaid I could ever know... and my one true love... while my grandparents seemed surprised at me having the name &quot;Nate,&quot; they didn&#39;t say it was a bad name. So... I&#39;d be Nate-Cain or Cain-Nate and anyone can use either Nate or Cain. It might make things easier and people won&#39;t think you odd for using the only name you&#39;ve known me by.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; Rose answered as she kissed him response to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Nate answered and kissed her back before he heard Rose&#39;s stomach rumble, &quot;though I suppose we should get cleaned up and ready for breakfast.&quot;</p>
