<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I picked the tighty-whities from the drawer and went back to my room. I sighed. Had I really sunk this low? I look at my watch and notice I only had 30 minutes to get to work. &quot;Well at least they&#39;re clean&quot; I said. I had already taken a shower so all I needed was to get changed and head to work.<br />
<br />
I put the tighty-whities on and change into my uniform. I quickly grab my keys and drive to the bakery. I couldn&#39;t afford to be late. My boss was a huge dick and said he would deduct my pay if I was late again. I park and as I walk to the front door I notice I feel odd and a bit sluggish. &quot;Must be the weather&quot; I said. It was over 90 degrees and I was sweating like crazy. I check the register as my boss booms &quot;Bout time you got here! I swear all you teens only care about youself!&quot;<br />
<br />
I respond with a faint &quot;Sorry&quot; and get ready to waste another 12 hours behind the counter. While I still felt funny throughout my shift nobody acts different towards me and after taking a few breaks in between to check my phone and eat some lunch I felt relatively good at the end of my shift if not odd. I close up and notice my boss, Ben, walking toward me. &quot;Nice job today, Andrew&quot; he said with a smile. I looked at him confused. My boss HATED me! In fact he hated all teenagers. I only got the job since my dad knew him. Why was he acting so friendly all of a sudden?<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you sir&quot; I say although my voice sounds a bit rougher. Was I catching a cold? &quot;No need for formalities. After all you&#39;re a working man too&quot; Ben said. I noticed his statement was a bit strange since he usually addressed me as a lazy teen. &quot;Well gotta head home&quot; I said with the same deep tone from before. I rub my throat and wave goodbye to my boss. That was strange I thought as I get into my car and drive home. <br />
<br />
When I pull in I walk inside to an empty house. My parents were still gone on their trip and I was slowly becoming adjusted to a solitary lifestyle. &quot;Man I smell!&quot; I say nothing the odor protruding from my body. I walk upstairs noticing the stairs creaking under my footsteps and head to my room. I quickly undress not bothering to look at the tighty-whities from before and head to the bathroom to take a shower.<br />
<br />
I walk in and notice dad NAKED in front of the mirror! I slam the door. &quot;Sorry Dad!&quot; I said trying to erase the image from my head. Wait... how was Dad home? He hadn&#39;t called and even his car wasn&#39;t in the driveway. I reopen the door and still see dad. &quot;Hello?&quot; I say noticing the man repeating the same word. Was that man... me?!?!<br />
<br />
I barge in and walk close to the mirror and place my hand on it only to be shocked by its appearance. My hands were enormous! They were covered in hair and had plump fingers. I stare at my reflection. Now that I was up close I could see that although I resembled my dad there were some differences. <br />
<br />
Starting with my face I had a receding hairline although not as bad as the one my own dad had. I was also starting to bald in the center of my head. My face looked rougher and slight wrinkles had formed near my eyes from age and exposure. I also had a magnificent beard that rivalled my dad&#39;s except it was a light brown. <br />
Overall, I didn&#39;t look too bad, a little older of course but I could pass off for my mid-thirites.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, my body wasn&#39;t in the best shape. I had two large moobs along with a protruding stomach. Next I notice my thick arms and legs and the layer of fat on them. There were also large bushels of hair everywhere. My entire body was covered in layers of hair including my once bare chest and stomach. &quot;Damn! I&#39;m so fucking hairy!&quot; I say in my deeper voice. I notice my Adams apple was also a bit more prominent. <br />
<br />
My legs were much or less the same. I had grown taller about a few inches but I was still overweight and old. But the biggest shock was my member which had grown quite a bit. At the moment, it was only 5 inches flaccid. &quot;Woah! I never knew I had such good genes in this department&quot; I said remembering my smaller member. I look in the mirror and see myself for what I appeared as. A dad! I had somehow gained my own dad bod and aged 24 years in a day.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to sit down&quot; I said feeling uncharacteristically tired. I walk to my room and sit on my bed much to the dismay of my bed, creaking from the weight of my new form. &quot;How the hell did this happen to me?&quot; I say aloud. I try thinking about how I began to feel strange after heading to work and how no one treated me any different... in fact even Ben didn&#39;t say anything.<br />
<br />
I look around my room and notice it was now empty and sparse and that a picture laid on a dresser. It showed my dad, my grandfather, and I. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; I say noticing my phone buzz from a recent text. It was from my dad.<br />
<br />
Luke: Make sure to water the plants Little bro<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is my dad named Luke and what does he mean...&quot; that&#39;s when it dawned on me. Reality had altered and I had now become the younger brother to my father. If that wasn&#39;t distressing enough I was only a house sitter to my once so called home.<br />
&quot;Where do I live? How did this happen? Who am I?&quot; I think starting to become overwhelm with nausea.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the doorbell rings and I hear a faint knock. Hoping they would leave I remain silent until they say &quot;I have a package for Luke Turner&quot;. I curse and get up noticing I would have to change and get the package. I look through the closet only to remember it was now bare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess I&#39;ll just borrow something from dad&#39;s&quot; I began to walk to his room when I walk past my older brother&#39;s room. He had moved out a few years ago and had left some belongings within his room. &quot;I am in a rush...&quot; I say. Should I take my chances and wear my brother&#39;s clothes or put on dad&#39;s?</p>
