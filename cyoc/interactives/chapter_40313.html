<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Knowledge seemed to flow into Mary's mind. It felt like being here was letting her remember things she had no idea she'd forgotten. <br />
<br />
Mary now knew who the fox approaching her was! She couldn't believe she could forget and wanted to smack herself.<br />
<br />
A sense of being overdressed hit Mary. People let males get away with wearing only gloves and shoes! There was no reason females couldn't!<br />
<br />
Mary removed everything but her gloves and shoes. She sighed as she felt the warm sun over her body. It was a warm and wonderful feeling. She realized that she was decent in the way males were decent without clothes. Oh the parts the were still there; they stayed hidden until Mary would need them.<br />
<br />
The fox landed before her. He was a little taller then she and boy was he ever cute. Mary remembered him much like remembering an old friend. She couldn't help but embrace him in a hug. <br />
<br />
His fur was warm and he smelled wonderful. Mary wondered if he'd showered just for her. He brought back even more memories. Mary's mind reeled with the memories which included knowledge that could have taken years to acquire had she not started to remember it again.<br />
<br />
Tails definitely wasn't a kid. If anything, he seemed to be in his late teens which indeed, Mary's new body seemed to be. <br />
<br />
That Mary knew this when she'd never played any of those games may have shocked her hours earlier. <br />
<br />
Recent events tempered such shock.<br />
<br />
Mary released her hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I saw you appear out of nowhere,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's been so long. I can't believe I'd forgotten,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
If these memories were implanted, Mary couldn't tell. They felt as real as her human memories.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, do I know you?' Tails asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tails, don't you remember? It's me, Mary! I guess you might not, it's been years since we've seen each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary did her best not to give a goofy smile. Tails was older then when she last saw him but he was as cute as ever while still maintaining an aura of maturity and dignity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, um do I know you?&quot; Tails asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look closer, it's me, Mary!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tails looked closer, blinked his eyes and then jumped back holding his head as though in pain. Mary was on him in a second, holding him to try to comfort him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tails, are you all right? Speak to me,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
Tails opened his eyes and looked into Mary's eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, I -- is that you?&quot; Tails asked.<br />
<br />
Mary nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd forgotten you, I can't believe I forgot you!&quot; Tails said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay, I forgot you too,&quot; Mary said. &quot;But now I remember,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fascinating,&quot; Tails said. Tails started rubbing his chin. &quot;I wonder why we both forgot?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary shrugged her shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how come you're not wearing clothes?&quot; Tails asked.<br />
<br />
Mary folded her arms. &quot;You guys get to be naked, why shouldn't us girls? I mean seriously, have you guys ever tried wearing dresses or high heels?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tails gasped. &quot;No but -- it's just, I'm used to seeing girls always wearing dresses! Seeing one, especially you naked is really weird. Actually, I kinda like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary started remembering that she had speed abilities. She didn't remember using them much though.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, wana race or something? Turns I have speed abilities now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tails smiled. &quot;Really? That's awesome!  Where do you want to race to?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary thought about it. &quot;We're close to the coast. How about we race to the beach? Last one there has to buy drinks and rub the other's feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tails grinned. &quot;Okay -- wait, what? Why would you want to rub my feet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing feet and perhaps hands as something to excite became more normal in Mary's mind. Indeed, what one normally cannot see on a person often invokes curiosity and a sense of adventure. When people only wear gloves and shoes, hands and feet tend to become objects of such curiosity and affection.<br />
<br />
Mary shrugged her shoulders. &quot;I sometimes wonder what you're hiding in those shoes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tails blushed. &quot;I'm not hiding anything! Maybe *you're* hiding something!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary winked. &quot;We'll see. Ready, set go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary took off in a cloud of dust. Running fast was natural to her. She couldn't run as fast as Sonic or other top Speed Types but she could still maintain a good clip.<br />
<br />
Places zipped by. Amy was amazed that she didn't feel tired or lost. This place was growing as familiar as home. It was a wonderful, welcoming feeling. She stopped when she reached the beach. Someone was sitting in a beach chair was in front of her. Mary walked around it to see Tails sitting in black swim trunks.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get here so fast?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
Tails winked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you said something about rubbing my feet?&quot; Tails said.<br />
<br />
Mary shrugged her shoulders and felt rather brave all of the sudden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be shy, I won't hurt you. It's just that seeing you makes me feel good,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you want to rub my feet then it's okay,&quot; Tails said. &quot;They're actually a little sore.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a smile, Mary undid Tails shoes and removed them before removing his socks. Mary took off her gloves and went to work. His feet were cute and soft. Sure, there was a bit of an odor, but Mary knew to expect that. Tails enjoyed the massage, that much was obvious by his smile, closing his eyes and how relaxed he grew.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Mary looked back and forth. Seeing that no one was looking, she leaned forward and licked the bottom of his feet. They tasted wonderful which only encouraged Mary to lick more. She managed to do it in such a way as to not tickle him. Tails was laying back with his hands behind his head and his eyes closed. Mary doubted he knew what she was doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't stop,&quot; Tails said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be right back honey,&quot; Mary said. &quot;I'm going to get something interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tails opened his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary winked. &quot;You'll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary was off in a small cloud of sand, leaving Tails wondering what she had planned.</p>
