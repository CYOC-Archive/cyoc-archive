<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You rummage through the shelf, looking through each package and the animal they advertize. Even if the clerk said there were a total of fifty to choose from, there&#39;s just so much variety, you don&#39;t even know where to begin. And to think the Earth housed so many more species of animals, you cannot help but imagine a warehouse full of these things, one for every single kind of animal...<br />
<br />
You decide to close your eyes, spin, and point at something random, and, for better or worse, try them out. Even if you pick something weird, it&#39;s not like you HAVE to use them all the time... right? Hell, you don&#39;t even NEED to buy anything, you could just walk away if the choice is too bizarre. No harm, no foul.<br />
<br />
When you open your eyes, you find your hand was pointing to a clamshell package under the name &#39;HIPPOLARISERS&#39;. Huh.<br />
Handling the package, sure enough, there&#39;s a smiling hippo plastered on it. Bemused more than anything, you decide to take these for a spin.<br />
Walking over to the counter, you place the container in front of the clerk, and he scans it for another 20$.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you wanna take these two, or just one?&quot; He asks expectantly. 40$ would be a lot for your wallet, so you politely decline, settling for the Hippolarisers. You still had groceries to buy, after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Be sure to check the instruction manual provided with the glasses if you have any questions. Have a nice day.&quot; The clerk says dismissively. You nod and make your way outside. You couldn&#39;t help but feel a little curious in trying the glasses out, but first things&#39; first, you needed to get your groceries done.<br />
<br />
After a short while, you got back home with the stuff you needed and deposited the plastic bags on the kitchen counter. It was time for a little experiment. You remove the glasses from their packaging and give them a look-over. They were sturdy and thick, and would most certainly make you look like a nerd, but perhaps their function could alleviate that.<br />
You notice several small dials on the arms of the glasses, near the temples. These are marked only with an arrow notch meant to signify what position it is in. Testing the forward right dial shows that it clicks into place three times, and was originally in the middle position. The other three dials seem to have four clicks, all currently at what you decide to call &quot;1st position,&quot; the final setting of a counter-clockwise turn.<br />
Grabbing the manual, you flip through the pages until you have a picture with the information on the dials. The first one you fumbled with, apparently, was the &#39;gender&#39; dial, allowing to choose from Male, Female and... Futa? Oh, right... Hermaphrodites.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof... better leave that set on &#39;Female&#39; for now.&quot; You mutter, quickly adjusting the dial for the middle setting. Looking over the second dial, you learn that it controls the weight of the target you&#39;re looking at, and it was set to the lowest setting. You make a mental note to adjust that dial whenever you find a test subject to experiment with.<br />
The forward left dial leaves you holding your breath, as it controls the reality of the target. As explained by the manual, you could make it so that the person still retains their memories of who they were before, or make it so that they think they&#39;ve always been a hippo, and more. But would the same apply to everyone else, though? &quot;Food for thought.&quot; You muttered to yourself.<br />
The second left dial adjusts one&#39;s loyalty, meaning you can choose how you want them to perceive you, be it a stranger, a friend, a servant, a lover... you swallow at that last one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welp, let&#39;s see what these can do...&quot; you exhale, feeling a little bit anxious. Glasses in your hands, you approach the window and look outside. A female jogger is approaching your house, and as she gets closer, you recognize her as Kimberly, a college senior that lives in the house next door. She was a blonde woman in her 20s, with her hair tied up in a long ponytail, wearing a summer jogging outfit that was comprised of a cropped sky-blue shirt and tight gray leggings that hugged her toned lower body.<br />
You quickly adjust the dials, and as she neared your house, you slip on the glasses and look at her. Gone is the athletic woman, replaced by an anthropomorphic hippo woman, her chunky body glistening with sweat and shaking uncontrollably as she stomped about. She was rather heavy-set, with breasts that looked bigger than watermelons, an ass that could easily crush the hood of a car, thighs as thick as tree trunks and a gut that partially covered her privates. She briefly stops as if lost in thought, and then starts walking towards your house. You quickly withdraw from the window before she notices you, and are startled when you hear the doorbell ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ho-lee shit, this really works...&quot; You exhale, trying to compose yourself before answering the door. As you do, you suddenly realize just how much bigger Kimberly is compared to you. She looms over you, probably standing at just shy of 8 feet of height, with an earnest smile curling her lips, and she leans forward to press her snout on your forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiya, hun. Didja get your groceries?&quot; She asks, her voice slightly huskier than you remember.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Huh?&quot; You stammer briefly, before it dawns on you that you set reality so that she believes you&#39;ve always been a couple. &quot;O-Oh, yeah, I got some for myself, yeah.&quot; She snorts at this and squeezes her bulk inside, taking a quick moment to wipe the sweat from her brow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you did, silly. You don&#39;t have to worry about mine, me and the girls got it covered.&quot; You froze at this. Other girls? What other girls? She must&#39;ve noticed your nervous demeanor, because she leaned over and looked you in the eye, her expression full of concern. &quot;Hun? You alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, sorry, I&#39;m just a little out of it today.&quot; You reply, and though Kimberly doesn&#39;t seem too convinced, she does stand up straight again. <br />
<br />
&quot;In any case, I just dropped by to say &#39;hi&#39;, I need to get back for a quick shower and then catch up on my studies before the – OH! That&#39;s right!&quot; She exclaims suddenly before placing her hands on her wide and chubby hips. &quot;Me and the girls are having a &#39;movie night&#39; tonight as part of an assigment we gotta do, and soooo... I was thinkin&#39;... maybe you&#39;d wanna join us, hun?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking fast, a lightbulb turns on in your mind as to who these &#39;other girls&#39; were: Kimberly&#39;s housemates and her best friends. Being college students and friends, it made sense for them to share a space where they can be comfortable and hang out. And that gave you an idea...<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure thing Kim. I&#39;m game for it, but what about your housemates?&quot; She snorted and giggled, which looked incredibly bizarre for you to see such a large woman having such a girly laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pshh, I&#39;m positive they won&#39;t mind. Anyways, I&#39;ll be seeing your cute mug in a bit, like say, around seven?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m just gonna run an errand real quick and I&#39;ll be there.&quot; You nod and give her a smile. Kimberly squees and promptly bear hugs you, lifting you off the ground, and plants a fat kiss on your face. Setting you back on your feet, she saunters to the door, blows you another kiss and once again squeezes her bulk through the door, leaving you stunned and a bit shaken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just what have I gotten myself into?...&quot; you mutter, with part of your face completely smeared in lipstick, and your gaze slowly shifts to the glasses resting on the table.<br />
<br />
A few hours later...</p>
