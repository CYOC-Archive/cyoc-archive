<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse's hands shook as he grabbed the bottom of his shirt and began talking while pulling it <br />
over his head. &quot;Anyone of you having some&quot;, his speech became muffled, &quot;difficulties seeing <br />
a naked guy turning into a werebear,&quot; he threw the shirt down on the floor, &quot;might want to <br />
look away now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jesse looked down at his body and saw a light dusting of hair in the middle of his chest <br />
that wasn't there before, but went right back to the task at hand kicking off his shoes to <br />
the side and brought his fingers together to open the fly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesse, what the heck!&quot; Josh exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it's the new me, remember?&quot; Jesse said and twisted around looking at the bartender, <br />
getting a big hairy thumbs-up in return and a killer smile.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This the best time to show off, and well... wouldn't want to miss anything honestly.&quot; he <br />
added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm keeping my clothes on once it's my turn.&quot; Josh added sourly.<br />
<br />
Jesse rolled his head a bit and shrugged off his little warning, then focused his attention <br />
back to the fly. After a bit of wriggling out of his pants he now stood in only his boxers <br />
in front of the crowd, adrenaline pumping through his body as he blushed and began to feel <br />
for that weird new thing inside him. He involuntarily twitched his bear-tail behind him as <br />
he concentrated, now feeling  that new something inside of him very clearly. It was like his <br />
whole body wanted to stretch out, like it was trying to tell his mind of the shape to come. <br />
His limbs twitching as a pleasant surge ran through his body and kept going at low buzz like <br />
the warmth after a good excercise. The itching grew worse across his body as Jesse tried to <br />
frantically scratch it. Then he felt something that made his body spasm all of a sudden, the <br />
onlookers jerking back in surprise, and then as the silence before the storm it all <br />
evaporated to a slight tingling as he felt something concentrating in his gut.<br />
<br />
Moaning softly he felt his belly grew increasingly warm to the point of hot to the touch and <br />
that sated feeling the bartender talked about made it feel like he really just loosened the <br />
belt, but were usually it would settle in a moment, here it kept on expanding and expanding. <br />
Looking down he saw his gut grow bulbous, reaching from right underneath his pecs to his <br />
crotch into a strong-man belly with padding. The skin across it grew tight like a drum when <br />
suddenly he saw something creeping up from his crotch; a wave of hair protruding out of his <br />
skin. Carressing the swelling gut he felt the stubble of hair growing in on his fairly <br />
substantial and hard beer-gut, as it thickened bravely and spreading out. He stroked it <br />
slowly as the hair turned into soft bear-fur, a thicker line in the middle of the belly that <br />
bristled and stood out from his body. It was a mix of brown across the whole span and dark <br />
chocolate brown in the bristled protrusion. The crowd saw a weird combination of an average, <br />
somewhat stocky guy with a great furry bear-belly that looked quite out of proportion on his <br />
frame.<br />
<br />
Jesse gasped for air as his concentration lapsed, looking down he saw the extent of the <br />
large furry gut in front of him and the thickness of the pelt, temporarily holding the <br />
transformation as he just opened his mouth and began fondling it without consideration of <br />
the crowd around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh god... I just realized why I became a werebear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It looked intense dude. Can I give it a pat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh poked it at first, surprised as it sank in but not as far as he had expected, it was <br />
quite solid in fact. Then proceeded to give it a full stroke with his open palm. Jesse <br />
looked down and enjoyed the petting of his fur, now probably sharing the same enjoyable <br />
experience that a dog might feel being petted on the belly. Jesse coughed a bit as to mark <br />
that it was enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;That pelt feels pretty great dude,&quot; then as he felt the comment was somewhat inappropriate <br />
he added, &quot;sorry to sound a bit weird&quot;. Josh withdrew back to his bar-chair again and felt <br />
humiliated from all the people looking.<br />
<br />
Behind the counter, the bartender had actually transformed himself a bit too out of sympathy <br />
from watching the display, his chest now barreled out and his clothes ripped a little here <br />
and there as brown fur was seen from the tears in the fabric around his chest and the belly <br />
was even larger. He looked down at himself and guffawed in surprise, his voice seriously <br />
deeper now as he scratched his now bearded neck that had grown thicker too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like I'll transform before you do son, get a move on!&quot; he said with a grin splitting <br />
his big beard.<br />
<br />
Jesse smiled too as he went on to fondle his tail... so naked without any fur enclosing <br />
around it. That needed to be fixed. He prodded again for the change in his mind, now easier <br />
to find and just like a muscle he tensed and felt that familiar sensation course through him <br />
again. Slowly fur began to grow out originating from the tail as his lower back grew wider <br />
and his ass growing thicker and more muscled. Unfortunately he couldn't see behind him so he <br />
stroked with one hand and feeling the pelt spreading underneath his fingers.  Then he saw <br />
the fur on his front on the large distended belly connect with his back rolling it into one <br />
delicious and continuous bear-package around his midsection. He moaned and closed his eyes <br />
as the change finished, but now it erupted elsewhere like a contagion from his tail which <br />
jolted towards his hand which me them tingle and expand. Bringing it back in front of him <br />
again and saw it grew larger as the fingers bulked out and grew to a magnificent man-hands <br />
right in front of his eyes. <br />
<br />
Hairs spread across it like wheat on a field but the palm and fingers grew callouses that <br />
expanded and turned dark; his bear-pads making it's first appearance. The fingers began to <br />
look somewhat like a grizzlys paws now as the black claws protruded from his bulgeoning <br />
fingertips, and once that was finished he was now the owner of two complete humanoid bear-<br />
paws with opposable thumbs. Roughly twice the size of his former human hands, he contracted <br />
and and turned them around. The fur however continued to progress up to his shoulders, his <br />
arms now looking buff and bestial as his biceps and torso also gradually caught up with the <br />
change, slowly growing stocky, wide and thick.<br />
<br />
Jesse looked down at his torso, seeing the large gut now not looking so small against his <br />
enlargening pecs, but his weight was beginning to grow sky-high as his burly and taller <br />
build was weighing down on him like a sack of bricks. However as he felt himself stretch out <br />
and grow taller, his legs gave the impression of flattening out under the pressure, growing <br />
sidewise but decreasing his ascension upwards as the strain on his legs slowly grew more <br />
bearable. Looking up at the crowd he noticed he was quite definitively a couple of heads <br />
height above them now, and his increased girth had managed to widen the distance from the <br />
circle of onlookers quite a lot. Looking down again, he saw his thighs were stockier now and <br />
with a touch of his paw on the side he confirmed the width they had assumed. His human feet <br />
grew so wide that he had to constantly shuffle since the sole of his naked feet stuck to the <br />
linoleum floor beneath. They grew larger and larger but finally he saw the familiar outburst <br />
of fur on the top that morphed the dish-sized feet underneath into a grizzly's massive paws, <br />
the pads growing and cushioning from below. <br />
<br />
&quot;You look just... awesome dude. Kind of makes me want to start early but I think this is <br />
your turn, obviously.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You don't know your tail yet?&quot; said Jesse, now with a bit of reverberation through his <br />
large changing the tone of his voice, not exactly lower but it sounded a bit more powerful.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I feel something warm at the end of my tail-bone but that's about it at this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But go on, I don't want to hold on it longer than I have to, it's itching to grow out of me <br />
now seeing how well you've done!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright&quot; said Jesse.<br />
<br />
But before he could continue, he saw something come into view as a slender hand petted his <br />
large furry belly. It was the woman from before, her request from before quite clearly <br />
betraying her true interest as she now walked forward and hugged him, or as far as she could <br />
reach at least. &quot;I'm not going to lie, I've been waiting for a bear like you to show itself <br />
here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm... you're...&quot; said Jesse, softly trying to use his new bulky paws to gently guide her <br />
away and not ending up hurting her, but it felt too good. She snugged her face into his <br />
belly-fur and sighed.<br />
<br />
However this time around the transformation continued without his consent, Jesse in throes <br />
of passion from feeling her perky breasts and humid, uneven breath into his taut belly which <br />
all made him quite aroused. Below he felt his paws tingle again as the fur from them quickly <br />
climbed upwards towards his crotch, trying to release his body from the human genital <br />
confinements in light of this sexual contact. Below he felt it edging towards his crotch and <br />
cover the balls in warm fur as his junk gradually grew far above an average human's size, <br />
and a sheath slowly rising from the base of his ever expanding libido.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... ooh... this is not quite right little missy.&quot; He caught himself calling her 'little <br />
missy' when in fact she was probably the older one of the two, but she looked quite small to <br />
him now from this viewpoint. His penis betraying his true interest as it slowly rose,  his <br />
boxers that was basically in tatters at this point, barely holding together, snapped and <br />
fell down on the floor. She quickly picked up on this as she felt his dick pushing against <br />
her stomach and in turn began to fondle his enlargened furry balls. <br />
<br />
&quot;You absolutely sure about that? Your little friend here seems to think otherwise&quot; she said <br />
with a husky, low voice, &quot;I can handle myself, so don't be afraid about hurting the 'little <br />
missy' now...&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd cooed as Jesse looked down and around at them below, his face gleaming hot, as a <br />
thick and dark-brown beard grew across his jaw down his neck, a bull-neck slowly pulsing up <br />
in pace with his frantic heartbeat. Jesse couldn't help it but stand helpless as she fondly <br />
groped his balls, the change velling up from inside as he felt a prickling sensation on his <br />
chest which made hair spring up like a fountain that then turned into thick fur tufting up <br />
to a small mound on his ample pecs. Jesse's face expanded to a larger and more rounded form <br />
as rounded half-moon ears slowly slided up through his hair, and a muzzle growing slowly <br />
outwards.  He blinked unregularly from pleasure as he looked at her, growling like a beast <br />
in lust, a deep baritone that made her purr amorously below as she felt the reverberations <br />
from hugging his large furry gut. Jesse could swear she saw ears growing on her too, vaguely <br />
feline or lupine it looked like. He felt something slowly growing down his head, a mane <br />
covering the broad shoulders and majestic upper back, across the muscled shoulderblades <br />
bunching up at the upper back to a mound and then finally connecting with his twitching <br />
tail. His neck-beard flourishing across his neck into a vigorous and warm neck-protector of <br />
fur as his face began to morph into the proper shape of a fine grizzly-head. <br />
<br />
&quot;OOOOOOOH...&quot; he moaned deeply as she began to slide on slender hand along the shaft towards <br />
the point, his moan was so deep it made the crowd feel it in their chests. His muzzle now <br />
painfully slowly extending as his nose grew moist and fur covered the entirety of his face <br />
and his beard absorbed by bear-fur as he grew a lush goatee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Name's Teresa.&quot; <br />
<br />
And then she lowered her head.<br />
<br />
Jesse's escelated bestial roar was heard throughout the pub as the climax was imminent, her <br />
tongue savouring his glans before he finally giving into it, his incisors growing out, <br />
tongue thickening in his mouth and his body now tensing up. His eyes now an amber orange. <br />
His cum now flowed thickly from his tip as he roared his climax, she quickly withdrawed and <br />
feverishly licking the shaft as it sprayed. This powerful body and the aftermath of his <br />
intense orgasm with the girl still caressing his balls made Jesse feel like he was embedded <br />
in a warm euphoric blanket.<br />
<br />
It was an awkward silence as Jesse panted with his tongue out in an animalistic fashion <br />
after the release, and Teresa who finally got out of the moment, looked shamefully down at <br />
the floor. You could basically hear dust fall.<br />
<br />
Then the unbearable silence ended as they heard a mighty slam on the counter behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drinks on the house! And anyone who wants a little special something tonight with an Animal <br />
Revealer; raise your hands now!&quot; shouted the bartender, now completely an anthropomorphic <br />
bear with a broken vest and pants gone, most likely lying in tatters on the floor. The group <br />
of people cheered loudly and Jesse could see several hands flying into the air. He heard <br />
Josh yell out his name through the commotion and held out a fist. &quot;Bump it, you just kicked <br />
your life up a notch dude.&quot; Jesse produced a smile using his new muscles from his remapped <br />
facial anatomy and drew a fist that could easily swallow his, giving Josh's a prod.<br />
<br />
Then the bartender patted Jesse on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
