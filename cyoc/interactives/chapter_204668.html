<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ralph and Carlos suddenly began to grow younger. Tracey had decided that if Emily and Rick were going to become parents, they might as well become parents to all their former parents. <br />
<br />
The twenty-nine year old Ralph was the first to show visible signs of getting younger, as the bit of beer belly he&#39;d acquired began to deflate as he grew younger through his twenties. Carlos, who had lacked a beer belly, didn&#39;t seem to change at all at first, aside from a few weathered features on his skin here and there clearing up and smoothing over--the same with Ralph. Rather quickly where before had been pushing-thirty young adults, suddenly there were college age coeds, and their demeanor had completely changed as they were now equals in age to Rick and Emily.<br />
<br />
Ralph dropped the intimidation first, &quot;Look, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re having fun, dude, but save it for a bedroom--last thing you want is to get sunburn on your dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You talk like you&#39;ve got experience with that,&quot; said Rick, his did still leaking a bit of precum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three words, Bahamian Nude Beach,&quot; said Carlos with a wink, which caused Ralph to shoot him a dirty look, and for Rick and Carlos to laugh.<br />
<br />
The regression continued though as the athletic college-aged young adults began re-entering their teen years, slimming down as years of after class visits to the gym were being wiped away, soon Ralph and Carlos had gone from looking like two knowledgeable seniors to fresh-faced freshmen who were now doing their best to avoid looking at Rick and Emily, who suddenly felt less of a need to cover up but instead were enjoying the embarrassment of the younger teens. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... maybe try doing that... uh... elsewhere?&quot; said Carlos<br />
<br />
&quot;What, haven&#39;t you boys seen a grown woman naked before?&quot; teased Emily as she playfully revealed herself, causing them to shield their eyes before she grabbed her bikini.<br />
<br />
But fresh-faced college freshmen they didn&#39;t remain long as their regressions picked up speed and sent them into High School territory, where the nervousness of Ralph and Carlos only escalated as all their hard-earned muscles seemed to melt off them, leaving them skinny sixteen year old bean poles with the hints of the men they&#39;d later become beginning to mix with the boys they had been.<br />
<br />
Rick and Emily&#39;s demeanor changed from playful teasing to one of irritance as Emily carefully stepped into her bottoms, and Rick fetched his own trunks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez, give us some warning before you come walking out here like that. Just because our Moms said you could come visit us, doesn&#39;t mean we want you hanging around us all the time,&quot; scolded Rick, as though he were talking to his annoying little brother and his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Rick, we just heard noises and thought-- umm...&quot; said Ralph<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought it might be a bear or something,&quot; said Carlos<br />
<br />
&quot;A bear, in the middle of the suburbs? You&#39;ve got to be joking,&quot; laughed Emily as she clipped her top back on.<br />
<br />
Driving licenses were soon lost as much as height and and voices quickly began to change. Ralph screeched once as he lost what almost looked like a foot in height rather suddenly as he went from being a high school sophmore to the other side of puberty in what looked faster than Carlos did, whose slow and stead shrinking showed that Ralph must have been a later bloomer while Carlos had been an early one, but soon even his stretched out skeleton began to compress itself to more childish proportions as he left the double digits of life and joined Ralph in being nine years old--completely a child.<br />
<br />
&quot;But there coulda been a bear!&quot; insisted Carlos, no longer with the tenor of his former voice but instead a boy soprano.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, there coulda!&quot; added Ralph.<br />
<br />
Rick rolled his eyes, while Emily simply waved for them both to approach, &quot;Come over here, and see for yourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Ralph and Carlos approached, they grew younger still, growing smaller and pudgier as baby fat slowly returned to them as they dropped down through the single digits, left grade school, then preschool, before re-entering toddlerhood. By the time they&#39;d arrived at Emily they were now the former ages Rick and Emily had been at the start of this entire event, two years old. Rick and Emily also seemed to changed their demeanor once again, their thinking of Ralph and Carlos switching from annoying little brothers to their fraternal twin sons. Carlos&#39;s formerly light brown-dirty blonde hair having lightened to fully blonde in comparison to his darker-haired twin Ralph.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is the mean scawwy bear gone?&quot; asked Ralph before inserting his thumb in his mouth to suckle it.<br />
<br />
Emily shot Rick and look, and for her sake, he tried to look abashed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you, they weren&#39;t asleep,&quot; mouthed Emily as she picked up her sons, who were still growing younger in her arms as hair began to thin, baby fat intensified further, and they shrunk from toddlers to infants, who began to cry while Emily&#39;s breasts grew somewhat larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, hold them while I get ready to nurse them,&quot; said Emily to Rick, who obliged her to quickly open her bikini top and let her engorged breasts free. Rick then handed over the less than a year old Ralph and Carlos over to her one by one, and each of his sons quickly latched on to their mother to feed. As they did, Tracey saw Emily&#39;s belly begin to stretch, as months of exercising to lose the weight from child-rearing undid themselves, which looked somewhat odd as Ralph and Carlos shrank in her arms--making it look like Emily was gaining the mass the two babies were loosing. And then suddenly in a flash Emily&#39;s already stretched out belly, filled as Ralph and Carlos settled in their new mother at nine months, and then began shrinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just go without a top then, if this thing won&#39;t fit anymore,&quot; grumbled Emily as she threw her bikini top away from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your body&#39;s getting ready to have our twins, Em, of course nothing&#39;s going to fit like it used to,&quot; said Rick, as he sat at Emily&#39;s feet and began massaging her clearly swollen ankles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh... that feels so good... don&#39;t stop...&quot; said Emily as her breasts, ankles, and belly began to shrink back through the months of pregnancy and Rick&#39;s massage became less about easing the pain of late stage pregnancy, and more foreplay as he ran his fingers gently up her leg before pulling at her bikini bottoms, and pulling it down. Emily, by this point had returned to the part of her pregnancy where she was incredibly horny, and grabbed Rick&#39;s own trunks and pushed them back down and off of him. Soon, while Emily&#39;s twin filled belly had passed the first trimester, Emily and Rick had gone from foreplay to outright sex, as he was in and out of her and doing his best to have Emily&#39;s needs met.<br />
<br />
Another moan of ecstasy from Rick and Emily signaled on the Game as the unconception of Ralph and Carlos, as well as Heather and Jennifer once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Rick... that&#39;s the third time today... think it&#39;s enough, or are you ready for a fourth round?&quot; asked Emily with a wicked grin.<br />
<br />
Rick didn&#39;t need a second invitation and soon the two were at it once again, and soon the game acknowledged that Emily and Rick were now pregnant with Heather, Jennifer, Ralph, and Carlos.</p>
