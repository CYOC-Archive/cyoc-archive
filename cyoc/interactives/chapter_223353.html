<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the three knocked on the door of the Van, they expected their researcher, Lucky, to open the door. Well, guess you could say that was true in a way, but instead of the Lanky Stoner they came to know, it was a buffed-up knight version of Lucky. He had put on the slacks but remained shirtless. Probably so that the first thing the guys would see was his new shredded muscularity. <br />
<br />
All three men quickly put two and two together and figured out that Lucky had used the device while they were away. Yet they still couldn&#39;t believe that this man was Lucky. Dazzling. That was the word that described Lucky&#39;s new form, and all three men were dazzled by him. <br />
<br />
Scottie was instantly infatuated with him. Not only by Lucky&#39;s new muscular physique but also by his newfound charisma. There was something about the smile that drew Scottie in and calmed him. Like he was wordlessly saying that everything would be okay. It almost made Scottie forget about his concerns about the mental changes. God! If Lucky could get this attractive, Scottie could only imagine what that device could do for him.<br />
<br />
Martin was feeling split on this matter. The leader of History Hunter was concerned. How would Mr. Hartmann react when half of the team he sent to find this device used it? Not to mention that Lucky didn&#39;t tell him about doing this. Yet, the new warrior side of him welcomed this. Another person to add to the platoon and some to spar with. Ultimately, the warrior side won out just because of how happy Lucky seemed now. Plus, there might have been some other &quot;feelings&quot; influencing his decision that he wasn&#39;t aware of just yet. Either way, Martin wouldn&#39;t be mad if Scottie or Owen used that device, too.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Owen was feeling all sorts of emotions. Fear, Anger, Amazment... Lust. This was an even more drastic change than with Martin! How could that scrawny stoner end up looking like he could be a model on a magazine cover?! <br />
<br />
Scottie was the one who spoke first. &quot;Lucky? That is you, isn&#39;t it? W-wow. You look great.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, pretty marvelous, right?&quot; Lucky flexed one of his new biceps and watched as Scottie&#39;s eyes widened. How cute. &quot;I think I become a knight in someone&#39;s court. I certainly look strong enough to be one. Fuck, dude, it feels so good to be this strong!&quot;  Lucky rubbed his new abs. Each of them just felt so good to rub his hands over.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll say,&quot; Martin interjected while looking over Lucky&#39;s body one more time, &quot;I wonder which one is stronger. A Roman legionary or a knight of the Round Table? Care to find that out later?&quot;<br />
<br />
Judging from the smirk on Lucky&#39;s face, it seemed like he was interested in finding out. He was going to say something, but this time, it was Owen&#39;s turn to chime in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you fucking with me?&quot; Look at him! This is an even more drastic change compared to yours. Why aren&#39;t you mad that he did this behind our backs. Or did that orb turn you into a degenerate as well!&quot; Whoa! That was a lot of anger. Usually, Owen didn&#39;t shit-talk Martin. The legionary was going to say something, but Lucky stepped in for him. Out of all of them, Lucky was probably the member of the History Hunters who disliked Owen the most. Despite that, he could really stand up for himself since he didn&#39;t want to get beat up. Now though? He wasn&#39;t scared of Owen anymore. In fact, he probably could go toe to toe with him now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, knave, you have every right to be angry at me. And I apologize that I did this behind your back. That being said, you don&#39;t have the right to talk to Martin like that. If you&#39;re going to show someone respect, at least show it to your leader.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! Big talk for someone who needed to use magic to finally become a man. I&#39;m not scared of you, Blyden. Even if you now have the body of a knight, you&#39;re still just a stoner fag on the inside. Oh, guess that&#39;s why you used that orb. Just another trip for you, isn&#39;t it.&quot; Lucky glared at Owen. You know, he could have grabbed that sword and cut down Owen right here and now. But he was a knight now, and that wasn&#39;t chivalric, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t like me, then you&#39;re free to leave at any time. Just know I may have used that device bulk up, sure. But at least I don&#39;t mistake being a man for being an asshole.&quot; The skinhead looked pissed. Did he just imply that he wasn&#39;t a man!<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what? Fine, I&#39;ll leave. Good luck without me faggots! You&#39;ll crawl back to me eventually!&quot; Not long after saying, Owen stormed off, but not before flipping the bird.<br />
<br />
&quot;Owen, wait!&quot; Martin chased after Owen. As Lucky looked on, he wondered if could have gone better? Heh, to be honest, it probably couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
While Martin chased after Owen, Lucky and Scottie went back into the van where Lucky thought it was a good time for Scottie to use the device. After teaching him how to use it, the knight put on the extra clothes that the others had bought and did a quick search on their client. With the information Scottie had told him, it wasn&#39;t hard to find more info on Bruno Hartmann. Seems like this man had fingers in many pies, but one venture stood out to him. A security firm, huh? Yeah, it would make sense that Mr. Hartmann would use the device to expand that business venture. However, Lucky could be wrong since he wasn&#39;t sure how much involvement he had in that business.<br />
<br />
Hmmm? Wait a minute. Scottie should have activated the device by now. Was something wrong? Turning around, he saw Scottie just holding the device. &quot;Something wrong, friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh, uh, nothing really...&quot; Scottie was so lost in thought he almost forgot that Lucky was still with him. &quot;It&#39;s just... uh, I just wanted to know how you were feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
What? That was a weird question. &quot;Huh, I&#39;m feeling fine, I guess. Well, actually, I feel more than fine. I&#39;m feeling great. I have so much more energy now. Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no, I didn&#39;t mean that. I meant mentally...&quot;  Scottie sighed. Maybe it was best to tell Lucky everything. &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m just kind of having second thoughts. I really do want to use this device and get a body like yours or Martin&#39;s. But I&#39;m also worried about the mental changes. I still want to be me, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, so that&#39;s what the techie was worried about it. Guess he needed some reassurance. So, Lucky gave Scottie a warm smile. &quot;Hey, you don&#39;t have to worry about me. I&#39;m still me. I have all my memories and skills. I still remember you helping me track down that artifact in Peru with your drone. I just, well, I guess it feels like I went to military school on top of it all. Still, you don&#39;t have to do anything you don&#39;t want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh god, that smile. Was that the smile a knight gives before he rides into battle to protect his people? If it was, it was working, as he felt like everything was going to be okay. &quot;No, I&#39;ll do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucky&#39;s smile got a bit bigger. He was hoping that would be Scottie&#39;s decision. &quot;Well, if sure. So, do you want some privacy or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! No, you can stay. In fact, I was thinking we could have a little fun while... Uh, maybe said too much.&quot; Scottie looked away, blushing slightly. God, why did he have to say that? Lucky, on his part, was surprised, but this wasn&#39;t unwelcome.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, and here I thought you were straight. You know, I&#39;ll tell you a secret. I think you&#39;re attractive now, but now I&#39;m wondering how hot you can get. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be hot. After all, I am Lucky.&quot; Well, that made Scottie roll his eyes. Though he was still smiling despite that.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must say that to everyone. Well, here I go.&quot; Following the instructions Lucky gave earlier, Scottie activated the device, and those familiar red numbers appeared. Right. Now, the best chance to keep his intelligence was to choose the highest number. Theoretically, the closer year to the modern era, the more intelligent the warrior would be. There! 1509A. He could have missed some higher numbers, but he rather not run into a time limit, so Scottie locked in those numbers.<br />
<br />
It was long before the spike of pain and pleasure hit Scottie. He somehow managed to hand over the device before slumping down against the van wall. This pleasure, this heat, it was more intense than anything he had ever felt before. He was pawing at his now almost painfully erect dick before something unexpected happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allow me, good sir,&quot; Before Scottie could even process what was happening, he gave a loud moan as Lucky was giving him a hand job. Fuck, those rough, calloused hands of his felt so good rubbing his dick. Every tug sent shockwaves through his body, and those shockwaves made his body grow. Arms, pecs, back, legs, abs all expanding at once. He loved how much room he was taking up now, he was finally getting the body of his dreams! God, if he wasn&#39;t careful, he might cum early.<br />
<br />
Lucky, for his part, was enjoying seeing the process up close. It was really hot seeing Scottie bulk up right before his eyes. However, there were other changing that he was noticing. His friend&#39;s skin tone was changing ever so slightly. It lighteing slightly. He couldn&#39;t tell what warrior Scottie was becoming, but it didn&#39;t look like he was changing into an Aztek warrior. Not only that, but the hair he had was straighting and getting somewhat longer and his face... Yeah those were Asian features. An asian warrior, Lucky had a few ideas what that could be. Shifting his focus, he saw the clothes shift to an all black outfit with a scattering of various tools and weapons. Yup, Scottie was turning into a ninja.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucky, please. Faster!&quot; Scottie cried out in what both of them assumed to be an old japaneses accent. Well, who was he to keep his ninja friend waiting. So, Lucky sped up faster and faster until sweet release. This was easily Scottie&#39;s best orgasm in his life. A wave of pleasure washed over him, putting a cap to his transformation. Lucky waited for Scottie to catch his breath before saying anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how are you feeling? Any regrets?&quot; Lucky was using that knightly smile again, and this time Scottie smiled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, no regrets.&quot;</p>
