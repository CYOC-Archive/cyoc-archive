<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, Jake figured as he went ahead with his shower, he wanted to see what else could be done with this Chronivac, how much else he could do. He remembered the relationship with Zeke&#39;s mom, and there was a mutual agreement to separate when Jake came out - he wasn&#39;t exactly gay, but he certainly wasn&#39;t straight either. He had needs that couldn&#39;t be met in the confines of a singular domestic monogamous relationship, so they amicably separated. Jake didn&#39;t say much about what he got up to to his son, but then, Zeke probably didn&#39;t really want to know about what kinds of people his dad preferred in bed.<br />
<br />
After Jake got done with his shower, and more than a bit of appreciation of his well honed if somewhat bulky physique, he wondered if there was something off about all of this. It was like something in the mist far off that he could no longer see quite so clearly. His memories were dominated by remembering himself as---as Zeke&#39;s brother, before, and now Zeke was his son. He much preferred this alignment. Plus, it had helped give Zeke a much healthier self esteem.<br />
<br />
And thankfully he wasn&#39;t abusing that self esteem on anyone smaller than himself.<br />
<br />
Once he got dressed and headed downstairs, he saw Zeke at the dinner table, dressed in a white thin material tank top that left little to the imagination and a pair of blue shorts. He seemed to be texting someone on his phone. And it seemed pretty urgent, going by his expression. &quot;Hey, anything going on there, big guy?&quot; Jake asked, curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s just a girl I like from school. Her name&#39;s Christie, and she&#39;s...having some problems with a guy.&quot; Zeke said with a frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guy problems?&quot; Jake contemplated, &quot;Well, good on you for hearing her out. Do you mind telling me what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s kinda complicated...&quot; Zeke responded, &quot;She and I have started uh, seeing each other recently, but she had a relationship before with Roy Brant, the lead linebacker on the football team. Roy&#39;s...not a great guy. He&#39;s always picking on people, apparently he was nasty to her when they were together - any time he wanted to be uhh, intimate, he&#39;d badger her. And now she left him, he&#39;s leaving her crude, cruel messages both on her phone and on the school&#39;s blog.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a real winner of a personality,&quot; Jake nodded, deciding he had his next target for the Chronivac. &quot;How&#39;ve you been handling this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t interact with him, I don&#39;t humor him if he makes a remark,&quot; Zeke stated, &quot;And I don&#39;t let him bother Christie if we&#39;re together. If he rolls up with his clique, we just move to another location. He&#39;s...really not worth a fight or any sort of confrontation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good on you,&quot; Jake said and got up, putting his hand on his son&#39;s shoulder, &quot;I know this kind of thing is weird and difficult, but maybe I can try and talk to some people and get Roy off of you and Christie&#39;s back.&quot; And by talk to some people, Jake had a very specific program on the computer he intended to do some talking to.<br />
<br />
Shortly after dinner, Jake went right up to his room to consult the Chronivac. It took a bit to find the right Roy Brant, but when he did and uploaded the data he observed what he saw;<br />
<br />
Roy Brant was a figure where it was obvious where he got his intimidation factor. He was 19 years old (seemed he got held back a year sometime), about 275 lbs, six foot five inches tall, and built like a tank. His features were a brutish sort of handsome, somewhat deep set very dark brown almost black eyes that&#39;d probably make him look even meaner when he was angry, his hair almost blond / light brown and cut into a buzz cut. Some of the personality data was a bit revealing - it showed Roy was on the sexuality spectrum listed as 45% heterosexual, 55% gay - but &quot;deeply closeted&quot;; Roy exclusively dated women. The only man Roy acted on his gayer instincts with was his underling Clyde Lansing, another linebacker on the varsity team.<br />
<br />
An idea came to mind.<br />
<br />
Jake could already tell that the Chronivac was capable of changing people pretty quickly, so he was curious to see what might come of a change occurring over a certain period of time? About a week sounded nice. Roy needed a bit of an attitude adjustment - and a lesson in how smaller people lived. So he decided starting now, and proceeding over the course of a week, Roy was going to be turning into a tight, toned and very libidinous twinky looking guy...with the catch that his actual preferences wouldn&#39;t change.<br />
<br />
Roy would just have a stronger libido, a different body, and well, Jake would see where things went from there. He had a feeling Roy would be less destructive and toxic this way.<br />
<br />
Once he set up the change, he decided to wait and see - he had his eyes on that Clyde guy as well for a change. But for now, when Jake saw that he could observe what Roy was doing right now, he decided to take that opportunity. And he wasn&#39;t exactly surprised by what he saw.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, man...&quot; Clyde winced as he and Roy went up to Clyde&#39;s room. The smaller jock - with his bushy blond hair, bright blue eyes, smooth body and muscled physique - had been Roy&#39;s &quot;secret boyfriend&quot; ever since Roy discovered a certain thing about himself. However, Clyde wasn&#39;t as strongly into guys, though he wouldn&#39;t lie  he did have some attraction to Roy. Mostly explaining why the two hanged out. Clyde however didn&#39;t really like the rough and rather pushy sex the two of them had. Clyde by and large preferred girls, but he was willing, when Roy needed it, to help his friend out sexually. He just wished there&#39;d be more a sense of...well, a relationship.<br />
<br />
Roy however shook his head, &quot;Come on man, I need this. Christie broke up with me and is---is officially going out with that fucker Zeke.&quot; Roy already had his shirt off, revealing his enormous body - though he didn&#39;t exactly have no complaints. It was common knowledge that Roy didn&#39;t like any reference to how hefty he was - he had something of a complex about his gut. His arms, shoulders, back, chest, legs and even glutes were all packed with muscle and very well toned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say, man,&quot; Clyde started, &quot;Can you uhh, just not get quite so rough with me this time? My fucking ass still hurts from our last date.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Sure. I won&#39;t jackhammer it.&quot; Roy didn&#39;t even know personally why he got so into it. He usually dated women, but when he went out like this with Clyde, he just...lost control of himself. He was not GAY, that was for sure. He&#39;d cum in enough women to make that obvious as far as he was concerned. But he just...could not quite help himself. Yet he was too macho and caught up in posturing therein to ever admit it to himself.<br />
<br />
A breath of relief from Clyde, followed by the smaller jock taking off his shirt. Roy exhaled, and admitted that he found Clyde really hot. He moved forward, large hands roaming over Clyde&#39;s body, the smaller jock kissing Roy&#39;s chest, rubbing his gut as well. &quot;Ahh yeah...&quot; Roy blushed and felt Clyde&#39;s tight, toned ass with one hand, making his date gasp and start to erect in his shorts...<br />
<br />
But then Roy felt Clyde&#39;s mouth on his nipple, and something suddenly seemed so tremendously sensitive about that. Roy bit his lip to stop a long, loud moan from ripping out of his mouth. Fuck, but he needed whoever he went out with next to do that to his nipple... Roy didn&#39;t even realize, of course he couldn&#39;t, that that was only the starting phases of a change that would take him places over the course of a week...<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s...something.&quot; Jake commented as he ended the Chronivac&#39;s spying. He didn&#39;t exactly want to see the entirety of the sexual session between the two of them. Jake decided every day he was going to use that function though to see what went on with Roy when he could, and inquire to Zeke to see if anything had changed so far. Jake leaned back in his seat, and pondered how the program would handle this kind of a change.</p>
