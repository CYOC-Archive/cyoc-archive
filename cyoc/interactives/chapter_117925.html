<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Between work, the other threads of our ongoing Moon Lake Saga, work, life itself, and work, unfortunately I haven&#39;t been able to get back to Earth 3 as often as I wished to either blackjack88. But even if this visit&#39;s brief, welcome back!—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; began Barbara Masters, as the long drive from Oregon back to Moon Lake, Washington was underway, &quot;you and Ryan...&quot;<br />
&quot;Me and Ryan what?&quot;  asked Claire Robertson, turning to stare at her friend behind the steering wheel.<br />
&quot;You two serious?&quot; wondered Barbara.<br />
&quot;Well, he hasn&#39;t proposed yet, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking me, but considering that I&#39;m moving into his apartment...&quot;<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a good man. Any woman would be envious to be in your position.&quot;<br />
&quot;Even you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Once, but unfortunately, that ship sailed off a long time ago,&quot; admitted Barbara. &quot;I had my chance, but things just didn&#39;t work out, despite both of us being werewolves. But I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret. Ryan&#39;s crazy about you. As a long time friend of his I can tell, and hopefully on my way to becoming a long time friend of yours too, I hope it works out for you both.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Claire, easing back in her seat. &quot;But what about you and Chris?&quot;<br />
&quot;Puma Boy?&quot; Barbara asked in return, referring to the young coed she spent most of the day with. &quot;He&#39;s a great fuck, but having the equipment and knowing how to use it properly does not a relationship make.&quot;<br />
&quot;True,&quot; agreed Claire. &quot;I wasn&#39;t a virgin before stumbling into my new life in Moon Lake, but a woman definitely needs more than just an enthusiastic sex partner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hoping this was her chance, Barbara carefully began broaching the subject that was on her mind. &quot;By the way, did you like what you saw?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmm...?&quot;<br />
&quot;Me and Chris in bed together. Did you like what you saw?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I was surprised to discover Chris was a were too. After all, I knew him the whole semester and never suspected a thing. How wide spread are weres?&quot; asked Claire.<br />
&quot;If anyone knows the full answer, they&#39;re not talking, but I can say that while were&#39;s might be a minority in the make up of this planet, we are a global community,&quot; replied Barbara. Then she paused for a moment before adding, &quot;He does have a nice cock.&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe, but I like Ryan&#39;s, as well as the rest of my furry wolf,&quot; admitted Claire, to which both ladies smiled.<br />
&quot;Does he still keep his tongue hanging out of the side of his muzzle for a bit after sex, like a tired dog?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. Cute, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Adorable,&quot; agreed Barbara, but Ryan wasn&#39;t the one she wanted to have sex with.<br />
After about another mile or so, Barbara asked, &quot;What did you think of my fursona?&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;My were form. A lot of people refer to them as their fursonas, although the name certainly can&#39;t apply to most of the aquatic weres.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh. It was...&quot;<br />
And then Claire paused. &quot;It was...&quot;<br />
&quot;Sexy?&quot; suggested Barbara.<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; agreed Claire.<br />
&quot;Have you ever...&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you trying to ask me if I&#39;ve ever had sex with a woman?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, yes,&quot; admitted Barbara. &quot;While we&#39;re are in control, weres do have higher libidos than normal humans. Couple that with the fact that we also live for a couple of centuries, it&#39;s good to keep your options open when it comes to finding willing sex partners, regardless of what your marital status might be.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Claire in disbelief.<br />
&quot;I mean, after all, swingers do exist among regular married couples, so who says they can&#39;t exist among married were couples too?&quot;<br />
&quot;I... never really thought about it that way,&quot; confessed Claire.<br />
&quot;Of course, I also know couples where just one of them swings with the other&#39;s permission. But either way, no matter who they have sex with, they still go home with the spouses they love at the end of the night.&quot;<br />
<br />
The silence resumed for a while as Barbara Masters continued to drive.<br />
Then Claire finally said, &quot;You did look hot.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? Thanks. I thought you were attractive even before joining were society, but now...&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Claire, accepting the compliment. &quot;And to answer your previous question, I have been... tempted a couple of times in the past, but never had the opportunity or the nerve to discover whether or not I would have even tried lesbian sex. I come from a small town in Alaska, and the last thing I would want people to do is talk if the word got out.&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; said Barbara. &quot;It&#39;s supposed to be the 21st Century, but not everyone is as enlightened as they should be. For now, I&#39;m just going to put the offer out on the table. If you would ever like to experience intimacy with a woman, I&#39;d be more than willing to... tutor you.&quot;<br />
&quot;What about Ryan?&quot;<br />
&quot;What about him?&quot;<br />
&quot;Me, you, and him?&quot; asked Claire in return. &quot;Like you were suggesting between me, you, and Chris?&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s called a threesome, or a menage a trois. If you would ever like to experience that too, just talk to Ryan first and I&#39;d be more than willing to participate in one with you two. But I honestly feel that a lady&#39;s first time with another lady should be more private than a group setting. Besides, there are also threesomes where it&#39;s just one woman and two guys,&quot; explained Barbara. &quot;I&#39;ve done it, because I honestly feel that there&#39;s nothing better than having a hard rod in both my cunt and ass at the same time. And if I can be sucking on another cock at the same moment...&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? I&#39;ve always been a one on one person, although maybe in time I should at least consider expanding my horizons to an extent. At least consider women, if Ryan ever does want a threesome.&quot;<br />
&quot;A threesome, no matter what the group dynamic, should be for all the parties involved, not just the man,&quot; replied Barbara.<br />
&quot;You know, come to think about it, there was some pretty wild stuff going on after the weretiger meeting where I was initiated,&quot; said Claire, recalling her entrance into were society.<br />
&quot;A lot of everybody&#39;s group meetings usually end in sex, if not outright orgies,&quot; agreed Barbara. &quot;If you haven&#39;t discovered it for yourself already, sex is a lot more fun as a were than it ever was as a normal human.&quot;<br />
&quot;It certainly is,&quot; said Claire with a smile.<br />
&quot;Plus, as long as you take your were birth control pill every day, you don&#39;t have to worry about becoming pregnant until you actually want to, and for some reason weres are naturally immune to all sexually transmitted diseases unless we&#39;re dumb enough to do drugs and use a dirty needle. Then we&#39;re just as much at risk for hepatitis, HIV, AIDS, and anything else as much as the next person.&quot;<br />
&quot;Something to think about,&quot; was all Claire said aloud, but inside she was starting to wonder whether or not to take Barbara up on her offer, let alone how long it would be before they got back to Moon Lake and Claire could enjoy Ryan&#39;s hard lupine red rocket diving deeply into her again.<br />
<br />
Barbara Masters could smell the heat and pheromones coming from the inexperienced Claire Robertson, but remained silent on the matter.<br />
She could easily Jill herself with one hand and safely continue driving if necessary, but didn&#39;t want to scare off her potential new sex partner.<br />
<i>Besides, I still want to see what Ryan&#39;s raving about concerning Claire&#39;s fursona. White stripes on an otherwise black furred body? Sounds yummy,</i> she thought to herself as they crossed the state line from Oregon into Washington.<br />
____________________________________________________________________________<br />
Okay, I&#39;ve left the door open for the possibility of Claire and Barbara ever being intimate, but regardless of what happens there and within the rest of our ongoing plot points, hopefully it won&#39;t be so long until the next Earth 3 episode.—tmw.</p>
