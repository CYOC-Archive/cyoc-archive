<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>- Klyde Earl, Lvl. 8 Half-Elf Rogue (4)/Sorcerer (4)<br/>
- Titus Pine, Lvl. 7 Human Paladin<br/>
<br/>
- Luma Lerouge, Lvl. 69 Kitsune Sorceress (10)/Wizard (23)/Courtesan (36)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two men had been overwhelmed by surprise, as well as numbers. Not in the classical sense, but in that they simply had not been prepared for regular guards backed by a slutty mage. She had been the undoing of Klyde, getting him too hot and bothered to defend himself efficiently. Titus had been able to shrug off her lust magic... but not so much the loving caresses of an Orc&#39;s warhammer.<br />
<br />
And so here they were, together in a cell, naked. Metal bands on their wrists, ankles and necks were fixed to magically extendible chains, currently holding them tight to the wall in an &quot;X&quot; position. Titus still had fading bruises, but his injuries had otherwise been healed by a slave cleric.<br />
<br />
It was an unsual dungeon in that it was clean, well-lit, and featured simple amenities -- their cell had a pair of cots, a low table, a toilet and a sink. Their shackles were lined in velvet -- although they were also enchanted to dampen magic, as neither man could access any of their abilities. The walls were smooth brown stone on three sides, sturdy bars in the front; leaving them exposed to the view of the two guards patrolling the hallway beyond.<br />
<br />
It was not these features that worried Titus, however. There was a sweet scent that hung in the air, a perfumy incense that wafted from the lamps in their cell; enflaming the passions and clouding the mind with lust. Klyde was uncontrollably erect, and indeed from his movements the paladin was sure his companion would have sought to pleasure himself if it had not been for their restraints. Even Titus had had to struggle at first, especially while being tended by the cleric, a busty cowgirl who, while gentle, had not been entirely &quot;professional&quot; in her examination of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t shy from my touch,&quot; she had told him. &quot;Luma alone knows what she will do with you, but whether your keep your manhood or not, sex is your life now.&quot;<br />
<br />
But Titus had managed to centre himself and withdraw into meditation, clearing his mind of lewd touch and the ambient fog. He was calm. But that did not mean he was not afraid. They had been warned, and now they were caught. He had endured much already, but --<br />
<br />
&quot;Titus!&quot; Klyde&#39;s hoarse whisper stirred him from his musings. Coming back to the moment, he heard the sound of boots on stone, and soon the guards came back into view -- only this time someone else was with them. A tall, naked Kitsune hermaphrodite, fur shimmering in the firelight, nine tails flicking in amusement. One of the guards unlocked the cell, then they stood back, bowing as the voluptuous femme walked between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luma Lerouge.&quot; The paladin&#39;s voice was measured. &quot;I was not expecting you in person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I make it a habit to personally inspect all of my new slaves,&quot; she replied, smile tugging at the corners of her muzzle. Klyde flinched.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you think you can command us already?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luma did not answer immediately, instead looking them over. She took the man speaking, on the left, as the one her slaves had identified as knight or paladin. He was tall, broad-shouldered, well-muscled; tanned, somewhat weathered, a few scars. Long blond hair, blue eyes. Even good-sized cock and balls for a vanilla human: a real stud. It was almost too bad that breaking him would almost certainly entail a drastic makeover.<br />
<br />
On her right hand hung the other -- definitely a rogue; she had confirmed from his equipment. He was a bit shorter and more lean, though still with some nice wiry muscle. Slightly pointed ears and narrow features betokened mixed Elf-human ancestry. His dark brown hair was close-cropped, and there was a pleasing mix of fear and lust in his brown eyes as they strayed over her heavy boobs and down to her virile sheath and balls. To the red tip peeking out of that sheath as Luma savoured his reaction.<br />
<br />
But for now she directed herself to the larger man. &quot;Hmhmhm, you are in my power, from which no-one has ever escaped. It&#39;s only a matter of time.&quot; She put her left hand on her hip, while she teased lightly over her body with the other. &quot;Before you worship this... Now: Since you know my name, I must ask. Are you newcomers to this world, who knew not the peril they faced; or are you just fools?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is not foolishness to risk it all for a noble cause,&quot; replied Titus evenly. Luma&#39;s lips drew into a full smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fools, then. &#39;Nobility&#39; is one of the greatest delusions to bedevil the worlds. But fear not, I shall free you from its sway; in my service, you shall know the only true nobility -- my flesh and my seed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been through a lot in this twisted world, Luma. I&#39;ve held true to my code through it all. I was told of your reputation, and am prepared.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some things can never truly be prepared for,&quot; she responded. She stroked her hand down across her belly, stopping just above her sheath, then put it back on her breast. &quot;You <i>are</i> a paladin? Your kind often does present a challenge, but Kitsune need something to test our ingenuity against every so often. I will see you worshipping my cock, one way or another.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fighter shrugged in answer. &quot;Words, fox. Is that all you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want more?&quot; she teased. This time she ran her hand all the way down, to gently stroke her fingertips on her sheath, drawing out more of her red member. &quot;But -- ah -- you must give me something first before I can give you... your reward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reward?&quot; burst out Klyde. &quot;What&#39;re you talking about!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally she turned to him with a laugh. &quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious, slave? In my world, taking my cum is the greatest reward. Here I reign as goddess; and what devotee does not wish to be made one with their deity -- to be blessed with their essence?&quot; She strutted towards him, slowly, stroking along her growing spire until she stood before the rogue fully erect. She gathered her strong-smelling pre-cum on her fingers, than reached out to lube Klyde&#39;s own cock with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! God!&quot; he cried sharply, making the chains rattle as he tried to wrench himself away from her. &quot;What are you doing!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, I&#39;m going to interrogate you, little man,&quot; she replied. Given that her face was level with his, despite being suspended off the floor, Klyde felt an uncomfortable sting in the taunt. But that was quickly replaced by a new embarrassment as, with a whisper, Luma sent a rush of arousal through him.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-Not again...&quot; he moaned, recognising the spell now after his encounter with the wizardess outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Klyde!&quot; Titus said sharply. Luma chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t bother, Sir Nobility. Your friend is too weak to resist. I shall get everything I want out of him...&quot; She changed hands, taking Klyde&#39;s cock in her left while scratching under his chin with her right. &quot;And in return, I&#39;ll let you cum. How does that sound, slave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nnnnn.&quot; But, though he didn&#39;t admit it, Klyde was desperate for release. The slave mage&#39;s body and magic had driven him crazy without letting him orgasm, and the aphrodisiac incense had kept him close to peak. Now, with Luma edging him, his mind could offer no resistance as she cupped his chin, forced him to meet her gaze, and cast her scrying spell.<br />
<br />
She hummed to herself, absent-mindedly tightening her grip to keep the man from cumming before she was ready. His mind was not too difficult to read, and she learned a great deal from him. Not just names and classes, and confirmation that they had been with her new werewolves; but full details of their encounters with the bandits and battle with the Stone Witch. And before that, the many narrow escapes he had had. She even got a glimpse into his humdrum life as an accountant before playing the World of Change.<br />
<br />
&quot;My, such a varied life you&#39;ve had,&quot; she commented as she finished. &quot;And you&#39;re a sorcerer as well as a rogue! That could be interesting. Now, as promised, your reward.&quot;<br />
<br />
She let go of his chin and took hold of his balls instead. With both hands working him it wasn&#39;t long before he shot out his load, whimpering as he fought against the pleasure shaking his body, rattling the chains.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy.&quot; Luma patted his cheek, leaving behind traces of his own cum. She started to turn away, then as an afterthought held out her dripping fingers to him. &quot;Would you like to taste yourself? It <i>may</i> be your last chance as a male.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shied back, aghast at the suggestion, already burning with shame at having been unable to resist her probing and at his body&#39;s betrayal in enjoying her &quot;reward.&quot; Luma laughed and licked her hand clean.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah well,&quot; she commented as she sashayed back to the centre of the cell. &quot;You didn&#39;t miss much.&quot; She turned to face them, noting the paladin&#39;s reaction as well. He had given his friend a look that shifted from disappointment to sympathy. But then his attention had fixed on Luma.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can feel your rage,&quot; she told him. &quot;It is delicious -- so much hatred... so much impotence! And deep down you know that one day, you will love me and live for sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never,&quot; the paladin growled through clenched teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I had a gold piece for every time I&#39;ve heard that. So let&#39;s review: You came here for Tyana -- whom you know as Ty -- and Stephanie. Far too late, of course. Even if you&#39;d gotten to them, they&#39;d have fought you tooth and claw to stay with me. You split into two teams of two. I captured one -- oh yes; I had a lot of fun with Steven and Mariel. And my slaves captured you. So foolish; had you come peacefully you could have just bought some time with Stephanie, learned how happy she and Tyana are, and still been free to depart. Now however...&quot;<br />
<br />
She began to stroke her cock again while she pretended to think.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I&#39;ll have to punish you for trespassing and assaulting my slaves. You&#39;re both men, and I do have a soft spot for turning men into lustful, cock-hungry working girls. Ahhh...&quot; She let herself relax, tongue lolling a little as she moved a free hand to play with her breasts. <br />
<br />
Both men watched in horrified fascination, until Klyde shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.. My cum is... ahhh... infused with my magic... ah! to help bind my slaves to me. Sooo much as a splash on your skin will -- a-ah! -- <i>encourage</i> you to see me as your Mistress. As I am... Sooo... who shall I bathe first?&quot; Shifting her stance, she swayed to aim first at Titus, then at Klyde.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re <i>disgusting!</i>&quot; shouted the paladin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahahaaa you say that now, but just wait until my cream... ahhhh...! covers you; you&#39;ll feel so good. Horny... submissive... happy little slaves! Ahhh... you came here for Ty -- why not join her? Beg me to cum on you, and I&#39;ll let you live a &#39;normal&#39; life as my whores, with special privileges of servicing my concubines when they request.&quot;<br />
<br />
Klyde looked at Titus. Titus shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;No? Then I give you half-an-hour. If I do not hear from the guards that you are begging to be my slaves by then... I shall devise a more <i>unusual</i> way for you to reunite with and serve Tyana. But -- haaaa! -- let me give you a bit of encouragement first --! Ahhh... ahhhhhhh...!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both men flinched away as her voice distorted into a vulpine howl. A long white jet shot across the cell and splattered hard -- against the wall in between the two. But, though she pumped out stream after stream, scarcely a drop hit either man. She had merely been baiting them --<br />
<br />
Or had she?<br />
<br />
While the minute droplets that had managed to reach the prisoners gave only a little nudge to their arousal, the hot, steamy scent rising from the potent load was another matter. A cup -- or more -- of Luma&#39;s semen now dribbled down the wall, filling their nostrils with her musk. There was perhaps no magic in the scent alone, but there was still virility. They knew she&#39;d missed on purpose, her display of power searing just how helpless they were into their minds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh... I have more,&quot; she promised, patting her still-heavy balls. &quot;Remember -- half an hour! Time goes faster than you think, so don&#39;t dally!&quot; She turned, numerous tails swishing in amusement. They gripped the metal-barred door and slammed it to behind her. She confirmed with the guards that they were to report to her if either prisoner submitted, then strode off, her laughter echoing in the dungeon.</p>
