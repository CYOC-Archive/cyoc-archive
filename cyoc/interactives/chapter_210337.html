<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Then let&#39;s make them new babies for our performers!&quot; said the Ringmaster with a twinkle in his eyes.<br />
The audience was most intrigued ands waited with a bated breath. What did that entail? What would happen? Anything was possible and all the possibilities swirled in the public&#39;s mind.<br />
&quot;But let&#39;s have a bit of fun first,&quot; the Ringmaster said.<br />
With a wave of his hand, he utterly changed the appearance of the two formers teenagers. They became younger but not smaller and in no time, he had two children-sized babies with folds of baby fat. They were gurgling and cooing and just seeing these two phenomenons of nature made everyone gasp and stare intently. With a snap of his fingers, the Ringmaster made their children clothes disappear in a puff of smoke and under a vey juvenile melody of a lullaby, a set of two giant diapers, safety pin and bottles of talcum skipped and wobbled on to the scene, seemingly out of their own accord. The diaper clothes slid themselves beneath the giant butts of the two babies and the talcum powder sprinkled itself generously. Then the diaper clothes folded themselves up and the safety pin set itself swiftly. The audience now saw two giggling giant babies bursting with healthy baby fat and rosy cheeks. The Ringmaster smiled. Perfect. But now, for a bit of fun. He made with another snap of his fingers the two babies lying on their backs sit up and the diapers started to move on their own, bouncing all around the round scene, as if it was made of rubber. The two babies bounced and bounced, exposing their jiggling folds of fat and giggling smiles as the audience roared in laughter. Disturbingly, for them it was like watching two overweight freaks innocent of their condition, assuming all this was an illusion and so should not worry about being mean. And the two beaming bumbling giant babies seemed to havre fun. It was always fun to mock oafs, even if the audience members were not ready to admit their bullying flaws openly. After a few turns, the Ringmaster put a stop to it. Time to get serious.<br />
&quot;After acting like little clowns, how about making these babies meet their new mommies?&quot; he asked tentatively.  <br />
&quot;Yes!!!&quot; shouted the public, impatient to see what would happen next.<br />
&quot;Very well, very well,&quot; chuckled the Ringmaster.<br />
He walked over to the two giant babies who had stopped bouncing around like clowns for the amusement of the audience. His silver sphere was shining again and the two former teenagers could do nothing else but stare at it intently, completely hypnotised, at the full mercy and suggestions of the Ringmaster. They had become slaves to his will, much to the ignorance of the viewers, unaware of these two victims having become mere puppets and toys at the hands of the performers, something they would hate and dread themselves.   <br />
&quot;Tayla and Jared, listen to them very carefully, everything I say to you is true, no ifs, ands, or buts... It simply is. There is nothing to worry about, nothing to think about, let my voice become your thoughts, let what I tell you become reality,&quot; he said, his voice becoming fully friendly and caressing, a pure soothing delight to the ears of his two new victims waiting to become what he wanted them to be.&quot;Do not be afraid, do not worry, don&#39;t fret, there is nothing to be scared of. Be happy. Everything is going to be fine. I assure you. Soon you will be on your way to living happy, happy lives!&quot;<br />
The two babies somewhat recovered their adult minds, nodding at the soft words of the man, not realizing they were just fun playthings for him and instead completely trusting their new master. After all, the person they trusted most and that directed their entire lives, that had their well-being at heart and as a priority, said that they would lead joyful, blissful lives. So it must the truth. Hooray! Their hearts filled with gratitude. They couldn&#39;t wait to see the amazing lives and pleasures their dear master was about to so gracefully offer them! <br />
&quot;Jared, you&#39;re now a baby monkey and your name is Giggles. You&#39;ll soon discover why you have such an adorable name. Tayla, you are a baby dragon, all pink and your name is Sugar-And-Spice, the girliest dragon around. What cute names, you two must be the cutest, the the most adorable babies ever! The rightful pride and joy of your parents! But that must mean you miss your mommy and daddy, right? Yes, yes it does. Both of you are so cute, utterly cute and small for our audience. And you know what&#39;s cute right? Babies that act adorable and sweet and that absolutely love their mommy and daddy! A couple of cute little babies doing the things that are nothing quite as enchanting to mommies and daddies! You know all the little things that make babies so sweet to mommies and daddies! It&#39;s so cute when our two adorable sweeties do adorable activities with their parents, isn&#39;t that right? Yes it is. You WANT to be adorable babies and receive love and attention, it&#39;s what makes you happy, it&#39;s what makes you fulfilled.&quot;<br />
Tayla and Jared grinned wider and wider at the ring master&#39;s words, happy baby thoughts filling their heads as he spoke. They were babies. They were a baby monkey and a baby dragon. They wanted to be oh-so-enchanting to their parents, oh so badly! It was what they wanted more than anything in the wrong! They&#39;d do anything to get their love and reach out to them!<br />
&quot;And when I clap my hands three times, you will no longer be in my power and you will act according to your own wills, but everything I&#39;ve said will be the truth and your undeniable reality. Do you understand? Yes? Good.&quot; <br />
The Ringmaster clapped his hands three times, loudly, having both the complete attention of his audience and his two little slaves. A purple and blue smoke bomb went off right afterwards. When it cleared, there were now two little different babies where Tayla and Jared had been. They  were in fact utterly different. Jared, now baby Giggles, was of the same size but what looked indeed like a baby monkey, albeit a giant one. He resembled a living soft toy, complete with his remaining diaper that had now a hole for a tail. However, he made for an adorable baby monkey, even though his feet were human still. The Ringmaster, still annoyed by Jared&#39;s attitude, had left him with a part of his mind intact, yet overruled by new baby tastes and motives. At worst, his bouts of protests and rebellion would be viewed as him just being &#39;fussy&#39;. Worst for him, not only he&#39;d stay aware of his condition, opposite to Sugar-And-Spice but he&#39;d remember his brief time as a baby clown bouncing around in a diaper while being the literal butt of the public&#39;s laughter. So even if Jared was now prisoner in both body and mind of Giggles, the monkey was gurgling and happily babbling at nothing, the crowd finding him adorable and oblivious to the plight of the former teen inside. As for Jayla, her new personality ruled her fully and she just had been regressed to what she liked as a child, girly fun and joys. A simple mental spell and emergence of new interests, quite nothing and the usual for the powerful Ringmaster. Yet Sugar-And-Spice was calling out for her daddy, eliciting stares of pity from the public. She had no diaper but her soft round figure indicated her young age. <br />
&quot;Shall we call out to their mommy and daddy?&quot; asked the Ringmaster.<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; clapped the audience, who could not wait for the next creatures to appear.<br />
And they did. First a giant ape, a female as indicated by her lashes and big flower at her ear. She grunted a bit but beamed at the sight of giggles, clapping and then picking up her new darling boy. She pressed him to her cheek and swung him wildly, acting as if Giggles was a darling favorite doll. She kissed him, bringing out peals of laughter from the poor transformed youth. The audience found it just endearing but his own humiliation was just beginning. His new doting mother wasted no time in openly mollycoddling him by tying a frilly blue bonnet to his head, and thrusting a bottle to his mouth. He resisted a bit but a chiding noise from the female ape and a pressing of the bottle forced the milk down his throat. Then it was spoonful after spoonful of pureed banana. By the time she was done and the audience had stopped laughing, Jared felt full to the brim. But his new mommy was not sure at all and poked and patted his extremely paunchy belly. It was uncomfortable. He could feel all the food and liquid swish and swirl inside of him. And the diaper would receive what would later come out... But for all uncomfortable that it was, the prodding, poking and gents pats had another effect. The sp[ell had rendered him extremely tickling and he was unable to let out many, many giggles. Everyone saw he was worthy of his  name, and enthralled by the cute sounds, the female ape proceeded to continue what soon became a tickling torture. The simian fingers were deftly finding all of Jared&#39;s weak spots and they were many. And he was too feeble and uncoordinated to fight back. The ape uttered &#39;coochie coochie coo&#39; and the public laughed just as much. Giggles did indeed giggle, and for a long time as giant nails assaulted his armpits, feet and belly. Worse, the Ringmaster handed a feather to the ape, prompted by a very enthusiastic audience. After a long time, Jared was nothing but a sobbing, shaking mess, which the ape picked up, placed upon her shoulder, patted and Jared finished his first performance with a burp that resonated loudly under the tent, resulting roars of laughter. Well, not quite as Jared was then set down with a pacifier and rattle, which he shook with more laughter as his cutie baby tastes took over and he could not help himself from shaking and finding most amusing and entertaining. The Ringmaster had the viewers applaud and ape retreated with her new sweetest babe.<br />
As for Tayla, she was not forgotten.  A light blue dragon arrived. A male but with effeminate mannerisms that got the audience laugh on the spot. Tayla seemed to recognize immediate and called him her &quot;dearest daddy&quot;. The dragon daintily put bows on her, all silk and velvet, as he said, an d had tea with his new daughter, at a tiny table, with cakes and surrounded by dolls and teddy bears. Afterwards, they danced in a clumsy waltz and they both tried on more bows. The dragon also put crowns on his new daughter&#39;s head and called her princess without fail, pushing her on a swing and both enjoying a carousel with girly ponies on it. The audience found this incredible enchanting, ridiculous and funny at the same time. As the two dragons retreated, ski[ping and holding paws together, the Ringmaster bowed, relishing in the acclaim he was showered with. He made the two magical replicas of Jared and Tayla arrive, both telling all the amazing puppetry and clever tricks they had seen as they were spirited off stage through elaborate trapdoors. These clones would vanish after a few days, seemingly with no connections to the circus. The new Jared and Tayla were much too loved by the ape and dragon who had demanded children for a time now. And the tricks of the two new recruits did seem popular. Yes, a new life for them was better for the circus and what was more, Jared deserved to be punished a little.</p>
