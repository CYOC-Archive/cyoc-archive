<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After driving for a while, Jeff feels the car, in which the thief had stuffed him into to, slow down then come to a stop and he feels the engine shut off. ‘Finally,’ Jeff thinks to himself, ‘I wonder where he brought me to. It felt like hours,’ he then hears foot steps coming closer, then the hood of the trunk opens.<br />
<br />
“I see you are still nicely wrapped, my little package,” Jeff hears the familiar voice taunt him, “let’s get you out of the trunk and into the house.” Jeff feels the strong arms of the man grab him and through him over his shoulders, “you are such a light weight, even though you seem to have a pretty athletic built,” the thief says as he starts to walk, “once we are inside, we’ll get to know each other more and I believe that you would like to hear more about your dad’s dark secret.”<br />
<br />
Jeff, even though feeling terrified and scared of what this man might do to him, has to admit that he is curious to know more about his dad, and this guy seems to know a ton. It does not take long until Jeff feels himself being lied on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Let’s get you out of your “package”,” the thief says.<br />
<br />
Jeff feels the rope being untied from his body and then he feels the thief roll him out of the blanket, Jeff is still gagged and blindfolded, his arms and legs are also still tied together.<br />
<br />
“Now, let’s get you into an armchair and get those blindfolds and gag off,” the thief then says.<br />
<br />
Soon, Jeff is able to see and talk again, the teen blinks a few times, his eyes not used to the light, but soon his vision clears and he looks around.<br />
<br />
Jeff finds himself seated in a leather armchair in what appears to be a huge living room: on his left there is a huge open fireplace, in front of the fireplace there is a big round coffee table. Opposite of Jeff there is another armchair and to Jeff’s left there is a leather couch. The walls are covered in bookshelves which reach the ceiling, the books themselves look old. Jeff turns his eyes back to the fireplace and notices a huge portrait of a happy looking family: a beautiful woman dressed in a blue and expensive looking dress, a man with short black hair and beard, wearing an expensive looking suit and in the middle a young boy around 10-year-old also wearing an expensive looking suit.<br />
<br />
“So, Jeff,” he suddenly hears a deep voice say, causing him to let out a surprised squeak, he turns his head and sees the thief, who is still wearing his black outfit and mask, standing nearby, “what do you think of my humble library?”<br />
<br />
“I… wait, did you just call me “Jeff”? How do you know my name?!”<br />
<br />
The thief chuckles, “I know a lot about you and your family,” the thief says, he walks in front of Jeff and kneels down, “I can tell that you are trying to be brave, but I see the fear in your eyes. I also can sense that you have hundreds of questions.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “y-yeah,” he says, “I… I may be scared, but I am also so confused and really would love some answers.”<br />
<br />
The thief nods, “understandable,” he says and straightens himself, “let me get changed and I promise that we’ll have a talk.” The man then gets adds warningly, “but if you should try and escape, I will have no choice but to kill you. So, don’t do anything dumb while I am gone.”<br />
<br />
“I… I promise, sir,” Jeff says, “e-even if my body tells me to run, I know I will not have the chance to get away, besides I have no idea where I am. So, I promise, I’ll be good.”<br />
<br />
The thief smiles under his mask, “smart boy,” he says, “I’ll be back in a few minutes,” he turns and starts to walk away. When he reaches the door he stops and turns to look at Jeff, who is sitting in the armchair with his head hung. The man thinks for a while, he then says, “Jeff,” the teen looks up at him, “I know you don’t trust me, and I am not sure if I should trust you keeping your word, but…,” he trails off.<br />
<br />
“B-but what, sir,” Jeff asks, “I… I promise I will not go anywhere.”<br />
<br />
The thief tilts his head thoughtfully, he then nods, “I guess it won’t hurt to risk it,” he says, “besides, as you pointed it out yourself: you have no idea where you are. So, I guess I should trust you to behave.” The man then walks over to Jeff, after a short look at Jeff, the man kneels down and unties Jeff’s feet, “stand,” he then says, Jeff does as told. The thief turns Jeff around and unties his hands, “sit,” he then says.<br />
<br />
Jeff sits back down, rubbing his ankles and wrists, “th-thanks, sir,” he mumbles.<br />
<br />
The thief nods, “don’t let me regret my decision,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff shakes his head, “as I said: I promise to be here when you return,” he says.<br />
<br />
The thief nods, “very well,” he says, he then turns and starts to walk off, “I allow you to have a look around my study. You may read a book or something, just do not wander off, stay in this room, I’ll be back shortly.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, sir,” Jeff says, the door then shuts behind the man and Jeff hears the footsteps walks away until they are no longer hearable. Jeff looks around the study, “man, if this is the study,” he says to himself, “I can’t imagine how huge the house must be. This place is massive! I guess it won’t hurt to have a look around the room.”<br />
<br />
Jeff gets up from the armchair and starts to walk around the room, “man, he really has some old books,” he says to himself, “some look ancient.” The teen walks over to a window and pears outside, “bloody hell,” he says, “it’s pitch black outside. That must mean, we are no longer in the city, we must be somewhere isolated. Maybe a Plantation or Ranch? I most CERTAINLY would not have a hells chance of escaping.” Jeff continues to look out the window for a while, “even if my body and mind are telling me to get out of here,” he says to himself, “I really don’t wanna risk getting hurt. Besides, my curiosity is stronger than my fear, if I behave, he might just let me go soon.” The teen lets out a deep sigh, he then turns away from the window, he walks up to the fireplace and looks up at the portrait, “they look so happy together,” he says, “I wonder who the family is, they must be bloody rich, they way they are dressed.”<br />
<br />
“I see you have taken interest in my family portrait,” a familiar voice says from behind him, causing Jeff to jump.<br />
<br />
Jeff turns around, “dude,” he says, “stop doing that,” his eyes then widen when he sees the thief in his natural appearance: the thief is now wearing a grey suit, with a button up shirt and tie and black leather shoes. He looks around 40, he has short grey-silver hair, his face is shaven, his ice-blue eyes give him a kind of mysterious look. He also has an athletic and well trained body.<br />
<br />
The man chuckles, “sorry, Jeff,” he says, “sneaking around is part of my job. Come, let’s have a seat and start talking. Would you like a drink? I have some Coke, or would you prefer something else?”<br />
<br />
Jeff blinks a few times, “um… a Coke would be nice, thanks,” he says, taking his seat in the armchair.<br />
<br />
The man nods, he then walks to the bar in the room and grabs a can of Coke out of the fridge. The thief also grabs a Whisky bottle and two glasses, he then returns to Jeff, setting the can of Coke and glass down in front of the boy.<br />
<br />
“Th-thanks,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
The thief nods, they both fill their glasses and take a sip, the man then leans back into his armchair, “okay, Jeff,” he says, “ask away.”<br />
<br />
“First, how do you know my name,” he asks, “I never seen you before. Who are you and what is this… story about my dad being a “Secret Agent”?”<br />
<br />
“I guess I’ll start by introducing myself,” the man says, “my name is Darren Dean Thomas, Thomas being my surname. As for how I know your name: I have been watching you and your family for over five years, so it was just a matter of time for me to catch your name?”<br />
<br />
“Wh-why have you been watching my family,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“I think that question will be answered when I tell you about what business I have with your dad and who your dad truly is,” Darren says.<br />
<br />
“I… I dunno if I want to hear the… truth,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Why?”<br />
<br />
Jeff looks down at his Coke, “I… I am afraid, that the picture I have of my dad, being the loving father and hard working family man, will be destroyed.”<br />
<br />
“Listen, Jeff,” Darren says, Jeff looks up, “no matter how bizarre, weird, confusing or scary the truth may be: John is still your dad, he is the same person who loves you and would do anything to protect you. Let me explain everything to you, I think you’ll be proud of your dad instead of hating him for lying to you. Besides, we all have our secrets.”<br />
<br />
Jeff thinks for a while, he then nods, “okay, Mr. Thomas,” he says.<br />
<br />
Darren smiles, “please, call me Darren,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Very well,” Jeff says, “so… Darren, please explain all this to me.”<br />
<br />
Darren nods, “I will,” he says, “let’s start at the beginning, before you and your brother were even born, before your dad met your mother. Get yourself comfy, it’s a long story.”</p>
