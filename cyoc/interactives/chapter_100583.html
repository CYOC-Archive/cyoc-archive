<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kim struggled in Heather&#39;s grasp, but it was no use.  The Dragon was just too much more powerful.  Her struggles seemed to accelerate her growth, and soon Kim was too large to remain in Heather&#39;s lap.<br />
<br />
Heather released Kim from her grasp.  She knew it was too late, and that Kim would soon become a dragon just like her.  She watched as Kim&#39;s skin hardened into thick red scales, the same color as her hair.  The freckles on her shoulders and arms became soft white scales, matching the soft white scales on her belly and jaw.  <br />
<br />
Long sharp spikes erupted from her back as she continued to grow.  When the spikes reached her ass, a large red tail erupted from her back and rapidly grew several feet long to match her size.  Her feet and grew long and wide, ending in sharp black talons.  <br />
<br />
Her thighs grew longer, thicker and more muscular. Her calves became shorter and thinner.  Her fingers grew thicker, and her forearms shrank.  Her head itched terribly, as her short red hair receded into her scalp, but the shape of her new arms would not allow her to reach her scalp to scratch it.  Her neck began to get longer, allowing her to bring her head down to her front claws so she could find relief.  <br />
<br />
As her head moved, it continued to grow and enlarge.  Her nose flattened against her lips as her jaw extended into a snout. She snapped her wide snout open and closed as it grew longer and filled with jagged sharp teeth.  Her tongue grew longer, with a  thin forked tip.  Finally it was over.  <br />
<br />
Heather was pleased to see that Kim was now identical to her - a 20 foot dragon - except Kim&#39;s scales had a red color pattern instead of Heather&#39;s green one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, how do you feel?  That wasn&#39;t so bad now, was it? &quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
Kim shook her head.  She had to admit, she did feel good.  She was full of energy, almost like when she had the boundless energy of a small child.  And her muscles felt good, warm and tense like after a good workout.  They begged to be stretched and pushed to their limit.  She desperately wanted to run, or smash something,  just to test her new strength.  <br />
<br />
Kim was about to try, when she got a look at Heather&#39;s face.  She was staring at her with a lunatic grin, encouraging her to use her power, to destroy.  In short, to be like her.  But Kim had no desire to lose herself, and become a slave to her body like Heather.  Kim turned away from Heather and started to walk towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, where do you think you are going?  Aren&#39;t you forgetting something? &quot; said Heather angrily.<br />
<br />
Kim turned to face her.  &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me, silly, me.  You were going to help me get out of here, remember?  Well, now you should be more than strong enough to help me break these chains and get out of here, &quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why should I?&quot; said Kim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, for one thing you owe your fabulous new body to me.  The least you could do to thank me was set me free, &quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
Kim scoffed.  &quot;I never asked for this body.  You just made me this way to help yourself, not me, &quot; said Kim.<br />
<br />
Heather pouted.  &quot;Maybe.  But you can&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t enjoy it.  I can tell by the look on your face.  Besides, you need me, &quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
Kim turned to face her, lay down on her belly, and placed her head on her front claws.  She stayed just out of Heather&#39;s reach and stared at her with a smile.  For the first time since she had met the Dragon, Kim was now the one in charge, and she liked being the one in control for a change.<br />
<br />
&quot;How so? &quot; said Kim.<br />
<br />
Heather sputtered.  &quot;How so?  Well, for one thing, I am the only one who can lead you out of here, &quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
Kim yawned.  &quot;I think I can read a map.  How do you think I found my way here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather was getting desperate now.  &quot; But..... but.... who will watch your back?  Who can you trust?  We are the only dragons in the world now.  Our kind needs to stick together. &quot;<br />
<br />
Kim laughed.  &quot;Trust you?  After what you just did to me?  I think I would be better off on my own, &quot; said Kim, as she stood up and walked to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, please don&#39;t leave me.  I can&#39;t take it anymore.  I&#39;ll die or go crazy or something.  Please take me with you, &quot; begged Heather.<br />
<br />
Kim turned and looked into her eyes.  They were so pitiful and full of sadness that she almost considered fulfilling her request.  But then she remembered the contagious nature of her condition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Heather.  But it is just too dangerous.  I can&#39;t risk you infecting more people, and causing some kind of epidemic.  I am afraid you will just have to stay here, &quot; said Kim, as she exited the cavern.<br />
<br />
As the door swung shut behind her, she heard a loud thud, as an electronic bolt slapped shut in the large metal door.  Apparently, the lock was time-sensitive.  <br />
<br />
Heather roared from the other side of the door, causing the entire cavern to shake.  The door suddenly got very hot, as Heather let loose a large jet of flame against it from the other side.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bitch!  I won&#39;t forgot this.  I won&#39;t forget how you betrayed me and left me behind.  I will have my vengeance.  I will have my revenge. Even if it take my entire life, my thirst for vengeance will be sated, &quot; screamed  Heather from the other side of the door in a blind rage.  She sounded insane, and Kim wondered how she had ever believed that this wild beast was just a scared girl.  She quickly made her way out of the exhibit, as Heather&#39;s curses echoed in the room, following her as she left.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t forgot this, Kim.  As long as I live, I will not forget this, &quot; thundered Heather.  &quot;And dragons live a long time.  A very, very  long time!&quot; yelled Heather.<br />
<br />
She began to cackle wildly, only stopping to punctuate her laughter with an occasional burst of flame.  Kim shuddered, and silently prayed the monster would never escape.  She left the exhibit, and began to slink away in the dark of night in the closed Zoo.</p>
