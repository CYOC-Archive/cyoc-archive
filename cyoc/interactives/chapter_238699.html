<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Abigail sat at Jeff’s desk, her lips curling into a smirk as she pulled up the Chronivac program. The week had only just begun, but she—no, *he* now—was already feeling the thrill of power coursing through him. He had spent years envying and yearning, but now the pieces had fallen into place. He was Jeff now, the older brother, the one in control. He thought of himself as Jeff naturally now, his identity and purpose aligned with the body he had stolen. <br />
<br />
&quot;First order of business,&quot; Jeff said aloud, relishing the sound of his new voice, smooth and slightly husky. He leaned back in the chair, running a hand through his messy black hair. The laptop screen glowed softly, showing two profiles side by side: his own and Arthur&#39;s. &quot;Time to make some upgrades.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff focused on his profile first. He hated the idea of merely living in his brother&#39;s shoes; he wanted to refine himself into something extraordinary. Clicking on his name, he opened the customization panel. The sliders appeared, representing every aspect of his appearance. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
### **The Transformation**<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes scanned the options carefully. He slid the **Height** bar down, shortening his frame until he stood a petite 5&#39;2&quot;—small, but perfectly proportioned. Next came his **Build**: He adjusted the slider to make his body slim and fit, with a lean swimmer’s frame that highlighted soft curves in all the right places. His shoulders narrowed, his waist tightened, and his muscles took on a subtle definition that screamed agility and youthfulness. <br />
<br />
He smirked and moved to **Facial Features**, shifting each element with precision. His jawline softened, his cheekbones sharpened, and his lips plumped slightly, giving him a cherubic yet undeniably attractive appearance. His **Eyes** became larger, with longer lashes, their vivid green hue practically glowing. He grinned at his reflection in the screen—irresistibly cute and disarmingly charming.<br />
<br />
The **Hair** tab came next. He selected “Long, Messy,” dragging the slider until his glossy black locks tumbled to just below his shoulders. He tweaked the messiness to a perfect balance: artfully tousled, like he’d just rolled out of bed but somehow looked effortlessly adorable. <br />
<br />
Finally, he turned to **Age Perception.** He adjusted his appearance to look like he was barely 13, with a youthful glow and a boyish charm. The juxtaposition between his real age of 16 and his delicate features would make him the ultimate enigma—a boy no one could take their eyes off.<br />
<br />
He hit *Save* and shivered as the changes swept over him. His reflection in the mirror confirmed everything: He looked like a dream, a boy who belonged in a photoshoot or a romance novel. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
### **Arthur’s Transformation**<br />
<br />
Turning back to the laptop, Jeff switched to Arthur’s profile. “Now for my boyfriend,” he murmured, the words rolling off his tongue with ease. It felt right calling Arthur his. Arthur wasn’t just some silly crush anymore; he was going to be the perfect partner—everything Jeff deserved.<br />
<br />
He started with **Build**. Arthur’s body, already athletic, expanded with broad, powerful shoulders and defined pecs. His abs became a rippling six-pack, his arms sculpted and strong. Jeff lingered on the sliders, tweaking until Arthur’s frame struck the perfect balance between manly and approachable. His height increased to 6’3&quot;, towering over Jeff’s newly petite form.<br />
<br />
Next, he adjusted **Facial Features**. Arthur’s jawline sharpened, his nose straightened, and his skin became flawless, the faint freckles on his cheeks only enhancing his boyish charm. Jeff highlighted his **Eyes**, making their icy blue hue brighter and more piercing, the kind of gaze that could stop someone in their tracks.<br />
<br />
He refined Arthur’s **Hair** too, styling it into a clean-cut look that was effortlessly cool. No more of that messy, nerdy mop. He also boosted Arthur’s **Confidence**, ensuring his personality matched his commanding new appearance.<br />
<br />
With a mischievous grin, Jeff clicked *Save*. From downstairs, he heard a faint groan as the changes took hold. He imagined Arthur shifting in his seat, stretching his now-massive arms, the adjustments settling into his body. Jeff closed his laptop and sauntered downstairs, eager to see his handiwork.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
### **Seeing the Results**<br />
<br />
Arthur was sitting on the couch, rubbing his temples, seemingly unaware of the changes yet. Jeff’s breath hitched as he took in the sight of him. The transformation was perfect. Arthur’s body filled out his clothes like they had been tailored for him, his new confidence shining through even in the way he sat, relaxed and commanding. <br />
<br />
Jeff walked over and perched on the edge of the couch, his smaller frame immediately noticeable next to Arthur’s. He tilted his head, letting his long, messy hair fall into his face just enough to look playful. “You okay?” he asked, his soft voice brimming with concern.<br />
<br />
Arthur looked up, his dazzling blue eyes locking onto Jeff. For a moment, he seemed caught off guard, blinking as if trying to place something. “Yeah, I’m fine,” he said, his voice deeper and smoother now. He gave a small smile. “Just felt... weird for a second. Like I stretched in my sleep.”<br />
<br />
Jeff grinned. “Must’ve been a good stretch, huh?”<br />
<br />
Arthur chuckled, the sound warm and rich, sending a shiver down Jeff’s spine. Arthur’s hand brushed Jeff’s knee absentmindedly, the casual touch sending sparks of satisfaction through Jeff’s chest. This was what he had wanted. No—this was what he *deserved*.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
### **Settling In**<br />
<br />
The rest of the week passed like a dream. Arthur seemed oblivious to the changes, treating Jeff as if they had always been this close. They spent hours together, talking, laughing, and, increasingly, leaning into one another. Arthur’s touches became more frequent—an arm around Jeff’s shoulders, a hand lingering on his back—and Jeff savored every moment.<br />
<br />
By the end of the week, Arthur’s affection had blossomed into something undeniable. They sat together on the couch, Arthur’s arm draped casually over Jeff’s shoulders, their faces inches apart. Jeff tilted his head up, his messy hair framing his face perfectly, and Arthur leaned in, closing the gap.<br />
<br />
The kiss was everything Jeff had imagined and more—sweet, passionate, and utterly consuming. He melted into Arthur’s embrace, feeling small and cherished against his boyfriend’s powerful frame.<br />
...............................................................................................................<br />
OLD JEFF/ NEW ABBY&#39;S &quot;POV&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff seethed, her small fists clenched tightly in her lap as she sat on the floor, pretending to watch the stupid rom-com Arthur had picked. But her attention wasn’t on the movie—it was on the couch behind her, where her former body, twisted and reshaped by Abigail into some impossibly cute 13-year-old boy version of herself, leaned into Arthur’s embrace. The sight of her old lips pressed against her best friend’s—*her* best friend—made her stomach churn with fury.<br />
<br />
She couldn’t believe how crazy her sister had become. Abigail, now the new Jeff, didn’t just steal her life—she had *warped* it. Watching her old body with its boyish face, youthful glow, and irritatingly perfect messy hair made her skin crawl. The only consolation was that no one else seemed to notice. Everyone acted like this was normal, as though *she* had always been the “little sister” with no claim to her old life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Abby,&quot; the new Jeff’s voice cut through her thoughts, dripping with mock sweetness. &quot;Enjoying the movie? Or are you just mad you’re not big enough to sit on the couch with the grown-ups, and have such a hot boyfriend as Arthur?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff’s jaw tightened as she ground out, “Shut up.”<br />
<br />
But New Jeff’s laughed—*his* laugh—only deepened her humiliation.</p>
