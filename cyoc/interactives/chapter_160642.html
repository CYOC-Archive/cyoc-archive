<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry snuck out of Betty&#39;s suburbia style house, and began again his dashing from tree trunk to bushes, trying to hide, not wishing to being seen. He began marveling his satyr style sense of stealth. It was almost noon and on a weekday when schools were in session there were few children anywhere around to see a horny, horned half goat man running about naked as a Jaybird.<br />
<br />
A mild wind from the north kept the daytime temperature in the 70F* range, making for a comfortable day to be alive. Henry had come about seven blocks when a blue Chevrolet Cruze 4 door drove up and a window ran down, it was Betty waving for Henry to get into her car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello again, could you give me a ride to where I once lived with my?&quot; Henry asked, he being blunt, was direct about his plans to surprise his wife. Betty had called in sick, or love sick after enjoying many fun hours letting Henry do to her whatever she or he did to make her groan or giggle. Instead, Betty suggested, &quot;It is such a nice day, and you were such a spark to my living my life, I would really appreciate you coming with me to my house, and there we can frolic until nighttime, when I could drive you safely to meet your wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry just smiled, and waved a hand a Betty to drive on, as take him where she wished to go.<br />
<br />
When they arrived to where Betty live, she pressed a button in her car and the garage door opened automatically. As she drove inside and the door closed, those inside the car were drawn into darkness. The dark had Betty reach to help Henry to leap across her between seats console. Henry leaped, as feeling his oats, he grabbed Betty around her neck and proceeded to force his satyr sheath and half erect cock as inside her mouth. The sexual attack was wholly unexpected by Betty, and due to the leaping force of Henry, the two lovers bowled into the garage, to end up lying on the garage floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mowaw, mowaw, mowaw, oh Henry,&quot; Betty exclaimed, as she first suckled on his cock and received a generous serving of his satyr semen. &quot;Henry, I want to ask you a question, is satyr semen infectious, and not for making me pregnant, as rather would it harm me, cause my body to change, maybe in time make me a Satyress?&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry was still new at being a satyr and did not know how or if his semen was infectious, dangerous, or harmful in any way to men or women, and he told her so. As from 2:25 pm and until 9:45 pm, Betty and Henry enjoyed their mutual fun time together. It would not be wise to list what all thy did during that span of time, as it might be easier to specify what few things they failed to do. As the showered again, Henry was very much appreciative of Betty, and similar to how he paid her body hommage he did as he had when they showered that morning, he ate a satyr style diner of vaginal discharges. <br />
<br />
Betty stood in the shower stall as Henry finish his third course of her deliciousness. He stepped out of the shower stall and turned to smile as witness Betty, she by then shared his satyr form, although of different genders, they looked alike, Betty being the taller.<br />
<br />
Betty went to start her car as planned, as promised to drive Henry home to see, as astonish his wife as to how he had changed. Henry waite, as waited, and waited but Betty did not back out of her garage. Henry wondered if something bad had happened, and he walked to enter the garage, to find Betty seated inside her, she crying.<br />
<br />
Henry asked what was the matter of Betty, and she crying, told him he had cursed her with his sexual debauchery.<br />
<br />
&quot;I cannot drive my car, my feet are now cloven hooves, and my legs cannot work the pedals. You made of me to be a monster, my life is ruined!&quot; Betty said as Henry offered a hand to lift her from out the car. As Betty leaned forward to come out of her car, her eyes met with those of Henry and she again entered into a mental trace. Henry had her as his sex slave for throughout that night and into the next day.<br />
<br />
Satyr sex with a human causes a satiric infection, degrading first all morals even learned by an individual. The worse as secondary degrading came as Betty noted and from her lustier mindset she thought becoming as a furry human was great fun. She told Henry how much she enjoyed being furry from head to toes, and of her pussy, the lips becoming as stretched tightened, enhancing the sensations of when he was thrusting.<br />
<br />
Henry just offered her his lurid sort of smile, and kept at her with either his long tongue or his goat cock, invading her pussy, anus, or mouth; until she was so inebriated by sensations she could not utter a coherent sentence.<br />
<br />
Henry never felt better, or stronger, he rutted Betty, to where her pussy began to dripping blood. He had her then suckle his cock, bringing the horny satyr to orgasm after orgasm, one every thirty minutes, until Betty said she could not swallow another load.<br />
<br />
Henry chuckled when he saw his semen trickling in a long as thin string from her sore crotch that she continued to message.<br />
<br />
Betty felt enthralled by her changing body, but wailed of pains when her human legs and feet began to contort, cramp, as they conformed to being the hind quarters, legs, feet, and cloven hoofs of the doe goat she would be by the next morning. It would be then when Henry planned to discard her as a lover, he wanted nothing more to do with a furry doe goat named Betty.<br />
<br />
Satyr sex had taken a fuller control over Betty, and the semen infection renewed her physical changing, causing her body to conform to becoming as all goat. Henry was learning what a real satyr could do to as for people, no matter in male or female.</p>
