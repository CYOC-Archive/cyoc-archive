<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not knowing or even caring about the activities of everyone else, Samantha Twist walked back over to the hill behind the Twist and Anderson&#39;s houses. On the other side, among others, was where Alex Ramsey, Ben&#39;s boyfriend lived. But that didn&#39;t matter right now.<br />
After she sat down against a tree, smelling the lingering presence of Ben and Alex, as well as other couples, Samantha broke down and cried.<br />
<i>It&#39;s just curiosity,</i> Samantha tried telling herself after she ran out of tears. <i>Should of happened ages ago, but Frances has always been inquisitive. One of the many things I still love about her.</i><br />
Samantha still sat there long after she ran out of tears, lost in thought, when she heard footsteps approaching.<br />
&quot;Samantha?&quot; called out Frances.<br />
&quot;Over here,&quot; replied her wife, wondering how this meeting she wasn&#39;t prepared for right now was gonna go.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry,&quot; cried Frances, before falling down next to her wife and hugging Samantha. &quot;I let my curiosity get the better of me and...&quot;<br />
&quot;No. Being werecats, that part I understand. It&#39;s the <i>timing</i> I don&#39;t comprehend. I thought you were planning to wait until it was just us and the Andersons.&quot;<br />
&quot;Originally, I was. But with the Lawsons being there, I thought it was the perfect opportunity to try two and get it out of my system.&quot;<br />
&quot;And is it out of your system?&quot; wondered Samantha.<br />
&quot;For the most part, yes,&quot; admitted Frances. &quot;My questions were answered. Someday, if the urge ever strikes me again, I might try William&#39;s again, but definitely not Evan&#39;s.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sushi with barbecue sauce?&quot; asked Samantha, remembering what Frances thought the werewolf&#39;s semen tasted like.<br />
&quot;Yeah. His definitely tastes better mixed with Maggie&#39;s cream. You don&#39;t have any problem with our leftovers practice though, do you?&quot;<br />
&quot;If I did, I wouldn&#39;t be going down to the Andersons basement on a regular basis for the orgies,&quot; pointed out Samantha. &quot;Martha&#39;s, and now Maggie&#39;s pussy cream does taste more interesting at times with their men&#39;s leftovers. Besides, we&#39;ve helped the male werecats out before at pride meetings.&quot;<br />
&quot;Only as far as helping them manually obtain erections and aiming their cocks to enter their partners and husbands when needed,&quot; pointed out Frances, knowing that there was no oral sex involved in that. &quot;But in truth, what I experienced last night was a whole lot of effort compared to the actual reward. I just don&#39;t see how the bi and straight women can do it on a regular basis,&quot; she said, moving closer to snuggle her wife.<br />
&quot;Probably takes practice, like how good we are now with acquiring cream from each other and all our female partners,&quot; said Samantha with a smile.<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; agreed Frances, before laying her head on her wife&#39;s shoulder and purring.<br />
<br />
Samantha couldn&#39;t resist putting her arms around Frances and holding her close. But she had to be honest too. &quot;Last night did hurt a little.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. How?&quot;<br />
&quot;Seeing you on your knees, orally tasting the men... I don&#39;t know what was going through my head.&quot;<br />
&quot;You never act this way when we&#39;re with other women. Are you afraid of losing me? Because that will never happen!&quot; vowed Frances.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s partially it,&quot; admitted Samantha, &quot;but... I have to come clean here. There&#39;s something in my past that I&#39;ve never told you before.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Frances, looking up at her.<br />
&quot;The summer before we met... I saw one of my moms having sex with a guy, and it almost broke them apart when her partner found out.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh honey. I—&quot;<br />
&quot;It turned out to be my biological father, or sperm donor if you prefer,&quot; said Samantha, recalling the incident. &quot;Turns out that after he and Eve... coupled to create me, that awakened the bi side within my mom&#39;s werecat nature, and they kept seeing each other on and off over the years. When Sharon found out, it was like being at ground zero witnessing World War 3 breaking out. Technically, they were only legally married as far as Moon Lake was concerned, because no other part of the world would have recognized a wedding between a same gender couple as valid back then, but it almost led them to divorce,&quot; recalled Samantha, shivering.<br />
<br />
Frances pulled her mate closer to her. &quot;That must have been terrible for someone so young. Considering you were only 12 at the time, since we both met the summer of my 13th year and you were still a couple of weeks from turning 14 then...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. Sharon and Eve managed to work things through and are still together now. Eve doesn&#39;t see Steve any more though. I don&#39;t even know if his partner Raul ever found out about him and Eve. I do know I seriously lucked out and found the woman I&#39;d be spending the rest of my life with when I met you, but every time we introduce a new, male oriented something into our relationship...&quot;<br />
&quot;Like...&quot; said Frances, briefly slipping into therapist mode.<br />
&quot;First the toys. Got over that one. After all, they&#39;re just inanimate objects. Then when we started helping the male pride members. Still a bit revolting to me at times, but I just keep reminding myself that we have responsibilities as co-pride leaders and their... penises are just a different kind of toy,&quot; said Samantha. &quot;Then the concept of William&#39;s... leftovers inside Martha. Finally got used to the taste, but never wanted to try it straight from the source. Then William&#39;s and Evan&#39;s inside Maggie. That was a tad easier. I figured since we were already tasting William inside of Martha... Now your taste test...&quot;<br />
&quot;Every time, you somehow flashback to Steve and Eve and fear this might be the beginning of the end for us?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; admitted Samantha, before she started crying again.<br />
<br />
Frances held Samantha and waited until her crying ended. Then, after using a tissue from her purse to dry her wife&#39;s eyes, said &quot;I fell in love with you the moment I spotted you across the street from my folks&#39; house, even before you came over and introduced yourself,&quot; Frances reminded her. &quot;You&#39;re my heart, my soul, my love, and my life past, present and future. No matter how many others we play with, no matter what stupid things my curiosity might lead me to do, I have been and will always be yours darling,&quot; she said, before kissing Samantha again.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Samantha between sniffles.<br />
&quot;REALLY!&quot; swore Frances. &quot;The day we first met. The first time we kissed. The first time we made love. My surprise transformation into a werecat when my folks wanted me to become a weredog like them. Our dates. Your proposal. Our wedding, which thankfully is legal now in many parts of the world. Adopting Ben. Our... EVERYTHING! You&#39;re the only one who has my heart and soul. You complete me and I complete you. We&#39;d be empty shells otherwise. No matter what else happens in our lives, no matter who or what else we play with, it has been and always will be you,&quot; she declared.<br />
&quot;Do you know how much I love you?&quot; asked Samantha, before kissing Frances.<br />
&quot;More today than yesterday, but not as much as tomorrow,&quot; answered Frances, quoting one of their favorite songs. &quot;Now. What say we go home. I&#39;ll fix you a nice soothing cup of tea, then draw you a nice warm bath.&quot;<br />
&quot;For two?&quot; asked Samantha, as that old, familiar twinkle returned to her eyes.<br />
&quot;Whatever you wish darling,&quot; promised Frances, before standing and helping Samantha up.<br />
&quot;Sorry I&#39;ve been such a putz,&quot; whined Samantha.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I put you in such a putzy mood,&quot; said Frances, as she linked arms with her wife. &quot;Maybe we can stay in our bedroom for the rest of the holiday weekend, and only come out for food.&quot;<br />
&quot;That sounds very promising,&quot; replied Samantha, nuzzling her wife&#39;s neck as they started walking back to their house.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Some very interested parties were watching the interactions of Samantha and Frances Twist from the rear windows of the Anderson house that faced the hill.<br />
Even with their acute were hearing, no one could make out what was being said between the couple because of the distance involved.<br />
But as the married lesbian couple were heading back to their place, Martha announced, &quot;It looks like everything&#39;s going to be all right between them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; was the consensus, with smiles all around as the mega breakfast in the kitchen continued.</p>
