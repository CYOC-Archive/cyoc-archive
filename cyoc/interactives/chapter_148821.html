<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    With him and Cynthia still bound by the dark chains conjured from his own spellbook, Thorin&#39;s amber eyes glance on hopelessly at the group of reptilian mages. The soul that had overtaken Kairos was radiating pure murderous intent. In such an unstable emotional state, magic tended to be highly lethal, and even uncontrollable!<br />
<br />
    The kobold&#39;s yellow scales tingle and prickle as the immense magical energy from the group of clansmen flooded him. Even if this being that had overwritten Kairos&#39; personality was a potential enemy, he held no doubt they would kill the serpentman before them if provoked. <br />
<br />
    &quot;Thorin.&quot; <br />
<br />
    The lizardboy&#39;s eyes widening, his neck cranes to meet the grey mischievous yet gentle eyes of Cynthia. Unlike him, the chains that constricted the librarian only coiled around her knees, arms, and torso. His bindings wrapped around most of his body, leaving his head and feet free, the latter much to his mortification.<br />
<br />
    At this thought, an embarrassing idea forms within the kobold&#39;s mind, although he had to make sure it would work. Glancing over to Kenos, the serpentman held only one tome within his claws, the black cover a far cry from the white of his own. With the snakeman currently being held up by the group of cultists, he&#39;d most likely focus his attention on the bigger threat.<br />
<br />
    Experimentally, Thorin thrashes within his bindings, finding the chains to have loosened enough to where they could potentially be broken off, no doubt due to his tome no longer being used and the current mental state of Kenos...<br />
<br />
     Wriggling his body, the yellow scaled apprentice shifts his position, pointing the claws of his toes to the chains coiled around Cynthia&#39;s bound arms. The librarian gazes at him curiously, a grin spreading across her face as she takes notice of their positions.<br />
<br />
    &quot;You&#39;re awfully thoughtful, little one. I didn&#39;t have to say a word.&quot; The kobold&#39;s eyes clench shut in embarrassment, his face flushing as the librarian inches towards him without any further comment.<br />
<br />
    Shifting into position, Thorin&#39;s teeth grit as he swings his legs downwards, the claws on his feet shattering the chains and tearing them to pieces, freeing Cynthia&#39;s arms. Craning his head back to the group of lizardman, Thorin exhaled as they had somehow failed to catch sight of him and Cynthia. <br />
<br />
    A quiet yelp slips from the kobold&#39;s jaws as the aforementioned librarian pulls him towards her, positioning her bound knees atop his claws. Grinding his toes into the chains, with a clink they unbind, vanishing into the air.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Remind me to give you a pedicure later.&quot; Cynthia remarks in a playful tone, laying aside him. The kobold could only blush as she quickly undoes his chains, helping him rise to his feet alongside her as they break away. <br />
<br />
    Cynthia&#39;s expression of playfulness vanishes as she spectates the blue form of Kenos and the white scaled lizardman a few paces away. At least six hooded figures stood behind the red-eyed leader, a clan. Little had occurred within the seconds she and Thorin had spent breaking free, the snakeman hadn&#39;t even noticed.<br />
<br />
    In fact, the group of reptilians seemed to be so caught up within their own matters they all had yet to notice either her or the kobold apprentice beside her. Quietly inching towards the group of unsuspecting lizardmen, Cynthia&#39;s gaze quickly falls to Thorin, motioning for him to slip into the library and retrieve his tome. Nodding with hesitance, the yellow kobold crouches low, the dark color of his robe blending into the thick shadows that had begun to blanket this part of the town. <br />
<br />
    Sliding her back up against a nearby wall of stone, the sorceress&#39; face peers out from behind, her grey eyes narrowing as she strained her ears to eavesdrop.<br />
<br />
    &quot;The energy of my sssoul led you here back to me, just as planned.&quot; Kenos whispers, a shallow smile spreading across his serpentine jaws.<br />
<br />
    The white lizardman&#39;s maw curls into a twisted grin in response, his crimson gaze filled with contempt as he stares down the blue serpentman before him. <br />
<br />
    &quot;When I came across your lifeless body in the forest hours ago, an unusual feeling overcame me. It was unlike any other... My heart ached, my soul screamed.&quot; He pauses, gazing up to the sky. &quot;...I felt… wrath...&quot; <br />
<br />
    Kenos&#39; purple eyes narrow, gaze becoming needles at the pale scaled reptile&#39;s words.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Hah! You &#39;<i>felt</i>?!&#39; I thought you no longer had anything left to feel, &#39;<i>father</i>!&#39;&quot; The blue snakeman&#39;s tone oozes with pure venom, venom that could not pierce through the skull of the white lizardman in front of him. The serpent&#39;s clawed hand clenches into a fist, his teeth gritting in rage. &quot;No, not &#39;father.&#39; A worthlessssss bag of flesh ssssuch as you hass no right to be called by ssuch a title!&quot;<br />
<br />
    Deranged laughter flies forth from the lizardman&#39;s maw, spare spittle falling to the dirt road beneath him. His head falls back, chest heaving as his laughter echoes throughout the mostly empty streets of the small town and up into the sky. <br />
<br />
    Panting, his maw twists into a devious smile, contempt spilling from every inch of his being as his head falls back, his piercing red orbs impaling Kenos&#39; own.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Just as I have no obligation to call you my son, <i>snake</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
    At hearing these words, Kenos&#39; expression darkens, his eyes igniting with pure malice. The black tome within his palms vibrates as it threatens to flip open. <br />
<br />
    His scales reflexively tense up as the white scaled reptile steps towards him, maw twisted into a confident unflinching grin.<br />
<br />
    &quot;The man in red, he was your murderer was he not?&quot; Kenos&#39; expression freezes, magic threatening to burst from his fingertips. The lizardman&#39;s robed form freezes mere inches from his own, a hand outstretched.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Ahhh, so he was a knight! A pathetic human knight is who your soul bound itself to. It seems even before then, magic always existed within him, dormant. Your death awakened it, and through it you&#39;ve been reborn.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Kenos&#39; breath had long frozen within his throat. <br />
<br />
    &quot;But tell me, how does it feel knowing you&#39;ve become one with your murderer? Knowing that in the end, you&#39;ll be nothing more than a mask to hide himself beneath out of fear? Knowing that he&#39;ll be able to remove you from himself without any struggle?&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;I-I… am more…&quot; <br />
<br />
    &quot;You were always nothing more than a failure. A mask to be discarded when its usefulness as a disguise has ended.&quot;<br />
<br />
    The blue serpentman&#39;s pupils dilate, his purple eyes dull with the realization.<br />
<br />
    He truly was… just a mask…<br />
<br />
    &quot;No…&quot; The serpent&#39;s head shakes, his eyes closing.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The human that I have transformed through the merging of our ssssouls… Thisss... <i>Kairos</i>.&quot; The snakeman&#39;s eyes brighten as they open, a feeling unlike anything he&#39;d felt before building up within him. <br />
<br />
    &quot;When he killed me, I only had one regret...&quot; Kenos&#39; finger points to the lizardman before him, his arm shaking in pure rage.&quot;That regret... Wasss that I had rejected your help. Had I accepted your aid, he could have killed you too!&quot; The tome within his claws flips open, the pages swirling about as the scent of blood floods the air. &quot;The human beneath these ssscales and sssserpentine exterior, he has given me the chance to do sssso. This ssstrength...&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;Thiss strength, it causes my ssscales to shiver with courage. My fate as this mask…&quot; Kenos&#39; slit eyes examine the palm of his scaled hand, clenching it into a fist as his tome flies above him, dirt scattering about from the magic emanating from his spirit. <br />
<br />
    &quot;It givesss me more meaning than I ever had only being known as the offssspring of a pathetic excuse of a bag of flesh! Being the heir to a clan filled with the unforgivable!&quot;<br />
<br />
    Bending one arm across his chest and placing the other atop, the claws on Kenos&#39; toes dig into the dirt ground below as a shockwave of darkness explodes from him, knocking the white form of the lizardman back. <br />
<br />
    His eyes igniting in rage, Kenos&#39; father easily recovers. Turning to the group of lizardmen behind him, his maw twists into a depraved grin, his eyes glaring into the snakeman that contained the soul of his son.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Very well then, Kenos. How unfortunate that you&#39;ll be unable to prevent your fellow clansmen from adding more to our ranks while you satiate your desire to kill your own-&quot;<br />
<br />
    <i><b>Bang!</b></i><br />
<br />
    The sound of flesh impacting the ground caused Kenos&#39; father to spin around, rage flooding the expression of the pale lizardman, his eyes bulging from their sockets as his gaze fell upon one of his followers. The lizardman&#39;s hood had fallen off, revealing a hole in-between his eyes. Brain matter and blood oozed from the backside of his head, puddling beneath. <br />
<br />
    The remaining five clansmen were immediately on guard, their hands glowing and crackling with various magical energies as they scanned for the threat. <br />
<br />
    The gaze of all the reptilian men immediately shift towards the direction east of the library, where the ruins of an old abandoned building lay. The familiar clicking of heels echoed throughout Kenos&#39; mind, his purple eyes shining as the black clothed form of the librarian stepped out from the walls of the home. Adjusting her glasses, confidence radiated from the woman, causing his scales to shudder. <br />
<br />
    &quot;Add more to your ranks?&quot; Cynthia challenges, the mocking tone of her voice masking the venom beneath. Her grey eyes narrow to slits. <br />
<br />
    &quot;I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s going to be no more ranks to add to after you&#39;re dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
    The form of the white scaled lizardman begins to tremble in rage, his teeth as sharp as daggers clenching as his eyes took in the form of the woman before them. &quot;No… This essence of power that radiates from your soul… You carry the bloodline of-!&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;I could care less about a history lesson from the likes of you.&quot; Cynthia&#39;s voice dropped an octave, her glasses glinting as she glared at the shaking form of the clan leader. &quot;After all, I have no sympathy for your kind.&quot;<br />
<br />
    The clan of lizardmen remain steadfast as the sorceress&#39; form struts over to the slim form of Kenos, the serpent eyeing her curiously. &quot;Ssorceresss.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;Kenossss.&quot; The librarian hisses in response, mockingly drawing out the rest of the serpentman&#39;s name. Adjusting her glasses as the reptile&#39;s head tilts in confusion, she smiles. &quot;It seems you&#39;re not as depraved as I thought. Be happy you didn&#39;t get on my bad side, unlike your former cohorts.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Focusing her attention back to the group of lizard clansmen, her expression turns sour once again. With a snap of her fingers, a blade of blue energy forms between the librarian&#39;s hands. Grasping it, in a flash of light a metallic blade engraved with various runes sits within her hand, its shape reminiscent of a rapier. Bending her knees, she positions the blade in front of her face, pointing the tip in the direction of the group of clansmen before her.<br />
<br />
    With a nod, the tome in Kenos&#39; hand shines once again, a circular rune of magic forming outside the outstretched palm of his vacant hand. <br />
<br />
    Regaining his composure, the robed figure of Kenos&#39; father merely chuckles at the stances both his former son and the sorceress assume. &quot;A descendant or not, in the end, all that matters...&quot; He pauses, his cold reptilian eyes glowing as runes of red shine from beneath his cloak.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Is your demise.&quot;</p>
