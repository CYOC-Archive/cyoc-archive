<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The program on the computer claimed to change anything you wanted. Eddy didn&#39;t recognize or know what the heck a Chronivac was. &quot;What is this thing? I don&#39;t know how do I turn it off.&quot; Ignacio looked at his computer and sighed. &quot;I have no idea either...&quot;<br />
Eddy saw that the Chronivac program had both him and Ignacio&#39;s stats and general information listed as options. He clicked on one of them and saw that he could control Ignacio&#39;s actions. &quot;Hey, what are you doing?&quot; Ignacio asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a program that lets me control your actions,&quot; Eddy explained, reading the information.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see if it works,&quot; Eddy said. He scrolled down to a section that listed &quot;Current Mood&quot;. He read, &quot;Angry: 75%&quot; and thought for a moment. &quot;You&#39;re angry right now. I wonder if I made you angry?&quot; He clicked on the button and waited for the program to work.<br />
<br />
&quot;You little faggot!&quot; shouted Ignacio, as expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently it worked!&quot; Eddy laughed nervously. &quot;Let&#39;s try other things.&quot; On to the next option and he read, &quot;Bored: 67%&quot;. &quot;You&#39;re really bored, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Click.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; groaned Eddy as the program again worked just as he had hoped. &quot;Ignacio, you&#39;re bored! Aren&#39;t you excited to go to the fair with me? Let&#39;s go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; came the monotone reply.<br />
<br />
Eddy frowned then thought for a moment. &quot;Do you want to go out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Click.<br />
<br />
Eddy frowned at the screen as he read, &quot;Ignacio doesn&#39;t have many positive things in his life. He is not enthusiastic about much. He doesn&#39;t have many friends.&quot;Eddy saw he could use the program to even change Ignacio&#39;s age and body type. He decided to make Ignacio&#39;s mood and personality match whatever new type of body and age he would give him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Eddy with a chuckle, &quot;let&#39;s see what we can do to make you feel young again or even older. What do you want your body type to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; Ignacio replied.<br />
<br />
Eddy&#39;s eyes widened as he read, &quot; Ignacio has no preferences.&quot; On the screen, it seems making Ignacio so bored, also made him indecisive. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is so unfair!&quot; he complained to the screen. &quot;Fine, I&#39;ll choose for you. Let&#39;s make your body type Hot and your age 25. Are you excited for that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Click.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s...better,&quot; Eddy admitted. He thought for a moment and then tried another option. &quot;Let&#39;s try another age. I want to be in control for this. What about age 35?&quot;<br />
<br />
Click.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s...frickin&#39; older! I don&#39;t want to be an old person!&quot; Ignacio suddenly shouted. But it was too late the Chronivac aged Ignacio up to 35 years old. His body and mind maturing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do you think of your new body?&quot; Eddy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s big and hairy,&quot; Ignacio responded.<br />
<br />
Eddy turned off the computer as he started laughing. &quot;Ignacio, you&#39;re a pervert! You like being a horny, older man!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignacio groaned and crossed his hands over his bare chest. Eddy walked over and gave him a small smack on the head. &quot;Hey!&quot; he complained. Ignacio got up and stretched. He was now two decades older. He did indeed feel great, despite being 35 years old.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I look?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Eddy thought for a moment. &quot;hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignacio laughed as he unbuttoned his shirt a couple of times to reveal more of his hairy and muscular body. Eddy handed him a virtual mirror so that he could see his reflection. He looked at his body with interest. His face was the same, though some wrinkles had appeared near his eyes. His hair had also thinned a bit. But his body was hairier and more muscular than his earlier 18 year old body. He flexed a muscle and looked down as his large pecs flexed tightly. He looked over his abs, which were much more noticeable, and then to his thick, long legs. He flexed and stretched them out, admiring their size. He looked back up to his face. His face had a few more lines on it, but other than that, he still looked pretty hot.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I look?&quot; he asked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You still look pretty good,&quot; Eddy replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s try one more,&quot; said Ignacio.<br />
<br />
&quot;One more what?&quot; asked Eddy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Option. I want to see if there is anything that can make me feel even better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you want to be young again?&quot; asked Eddy.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I&#39;m happy with my body. I just want to try something new.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignacio thought for a moment. &quot;I don&#39;t know. Change my mind make me think like a 35 year old man...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man. Seriously?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignacio looked at his muscular body and said &quot;Yes make me believe I am 35 years old. Make me know how to act in this body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddy stared at him with a blank expression. &quot;Um...okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddy pressed a few keys and Ignacio felt his mind changing. He could feel his personality changing too. He could feel an old man&#39;s personality coming in. New memories started to fill into Ignacio, and the added years were added to his knowledge. The Chronivac had to make reality alteration due to Ignacio being 35 years old and Eddy still being 18. The reality for why Ignacio was in Eddy&#39;s room was created as well. Ignacio had to forget all that had happened before in order for the alteration to take affect.<br />
<br />
Ignacio suddenly remembered why he was in this room with an 18 year old named Eddy. He was filled with feelings of instant lust. A feeling he thought had left him long ago. &quot;I&#39;m a horny pervert now,&quot; he laughed. Eddy suddenly lost all memories of Ignacio his twin brother, and instead had a brand new memory of Ignacio the hot sexy 35 year old man he met on Grindr.<br />
<br />
Eddy looked at Ignacio&#39;s body in awe, extremely attracted to him. Ignacio could see Eddy&#39;s eyes wandering his body and could feel the young man getting hard.<br />
<br />
Eddy gulped as he remembered why he was here. He was supposed to change his mind into something else. He couldn&#39;t though, as every part of his mind was fixated on the male body in front of him. His mouth went dry as he thought about licking some of that hair covered skin.<br />
<br />
All Ignacio had to do now was continue acting like a horny pervert. He looked around at the rest of Eddy&#39;s room and said &quot;Hmm, this seems familiar...I was in this exact same room a seventeen years ago with my identical twin brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Eddy said. He was confused he had no idea what Ignacio was talking about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll understand everything in due time. Especially now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddy gulped as Ignacio looked around and then at Eddy&#39;s bed. &quot;Well, I guess we should take this somewhere else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like where?&quot; asked Eddy, as he followed Ignacio&#39;s gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your bathroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect,&quot; said Ignacio.<br />
<br />
Eddy couldn&#39;t believe what he was doing, but he followed Ignacio out to the bathroom. He turned on the light and locked the door. He looked at Ignacio as the man started taking his clothes off. Eddy&#39;s eyes couldn&#39;t help but wander. He couldn&#39;t believe he was here doing this, but his eyes were taking in every bit of skin on display. Ignacio&#39;s body was just as impressive as Eddy thought it would be.<br />
<br />
Eddy couldn&#39;t stop staring at Ignacio&#39;s package as it bounced around while the man walked over to Eddy. It was then that Eddy finally caught a good look at his face. It was an older face with a strong chin. The rest of his body was covered in all sorts of scars, making Eddy think he had seen battle at some point in his life.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like what you see?&quot; Ignacio asked.<br />
&quot;You have no idea,&quot; Eddy said as he finally tore his eyes away from Ignacio&#39;s manhood and began taking off his own clothes.<br />
<br />
Soon, the two of them were fooling around in a position similar to how Eddy&#39;s friends saw him do it with his twin brother. But instead of two men, it was a man and...well...a boy.<br />
<br />
The pair of them laid there locked in an embrace. Eddy could feel Ignacio&#39;s manhood rubbing up against his own, and Eddy couldn&#39;t believe he was actually enjoying this. Ignacio then suddenly kissed him. At first Eddy was surprised, but then he returned the kiss. His tongue entered Ignacio&#39;s mouth, sparking the desire inside of him to perform fellatio. After a few minutes of performing this act, Eddy knew he could get used to this.<br />
<br />
But just as he was starting to enjoy himself, Ignacio suddenly rolled over and sat up. &quot;Hold on,&quot; he said. Ignacio took a bottle of baby oil out from under his bed and poured some into his hands. He quickly got up and began slowly running it over his body. Eddy watched in fascination at what was probably the most beautiful sight he&#39;d ever seen. He couldn&#39;t tear his eyes away as the man ran the oil over his body. His muscles would ripple as he moved the oil across his chest, stomach and finally his manhood. He pushed himself up and then turned around to show Eddy his face. He was beaming with happiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your turn,&quot; he said as he poured some of the baby oil into his hands.<br />
<br />
Eddy was about to refuse, but then he saw Ignacio&#39;s face again. He sighed and got up. He sat beside Ignacio and prepared to be oiled. He couldn&#39;t believe how good this felt. It was weird, but he actually wanted to feel good-looking for a change. He couldn&#39;t ever remember wanting that before.<br />
<br />
Ignacio began massaging the oil into Eddy&#39;s body, and Eddy leaned his head against his shoulder while he was doing so. His hands roamed over Eddy&#39;s chest and abdomen, but stopped right before reaching his groin. &quot;Your hands need to stay here,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Eddy, confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to do this,&quot; Ignacio explained. &quot;This is something only a lover can do.&quot; He moved closer and began kissing Eddy. His hands began to caress Eddy&#39;s body once again as the pair of them embraced. After about a minute of this, Ignacio rolled over onto his back, pulling Eddy with him.<br />
<br />
Eddy could feel the cold floor against his back, but it wasn&#39;t really that bad. It was more of a reminder that he was only here because Ignacio wanted him to be. Eddy didn&#39;t want to think about that though; he wanted to enjoy himself. Ignacio&#39;s hands were back on his body, running all over him. Eddy raised his own hands to Ignacio&#39;s head and ran his fingers through his hair as their lips locked once again.<br />
<br />
It seemed that the baby oil was having a positive effect because Eddy felt like he was floating as Ignacio pleasure took him over. His body tensed up and he gasped into Ignacio&#39;s mouth. His heart beat rapidly as his body shook. Ignacio didn&#39;t stop what he was doing either; in fact he sped up. He groaned into Eddy&#39;s mouth as he tensed up. His warm liquid covered Eddy&#39;s stomach and chest.<br />
<br />
After they both came down from their high, Ignacio pulled away and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. His breathing was heavy; Eddy knew he was feeling exactly how Eddy was. &quot;I&#39;m glad we did that,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Eddy couldn&#39;t agree more.</p>
