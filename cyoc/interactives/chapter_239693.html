<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Something about the bus ride made Jennifer feel more anxious than normal. Was it the acne, braces or having more bushy hair. She could hide the hair but acne and braces we fully visible on her face. On the ride she started to daydream about the drawn raccoon. It made Jennifer&#39;s anxiety melt away. Rubbing the small part of long-sleeved shirt made her think as if she was petting the raccoon&#39;s fur as it sat on her lap. She had no idea why she thought this way but to her that specific raccoon acted as her spirit animal. A guardian angel so to speak. No wonder she kept drawing it but it didn&#39;t explain the weird pictures she had drawn about it. What was up with that?<br />
<br />
Jennifer mind hadn&#39;t accepted her furry side but the idea intrigued her. It wasn&#39;t a normal hobby. Far from it. It felt very abnormal hobby. The students in her school would definitely freak out the moment they knew that she was into this kind of thing for sure. It would start her high school career as &#39;that girl&#39; if the word got out. Her social life would be ruined if they knew that she was drawing dodgy pictures of that anthro raccoon person. She had to keep her niche hobby to herself. After some time the bus had finally reached it&#39;s destination.<br />
<br />
The classes this time were moderately harder as the subject matters were something she couldn&#39;t pull out of her own memory. With some thinking she was able to concentrate on the questions she was presented and thought the solution for them. It felt really disconnecting how her body knew more than her mind. Was she really that dumb? It put things into perspective as she had no memories of her being this good at school. It was like her body was doing all the heavy lifting for her while her mind was there to just agree and accept that those seemed to be the right answers. She didn&#39;t know but her body knew. It was like her mind was acting as a torchlight for her torso who knew how to to run but was too scared to go full speed.<br />
<br />
During the first recess Jennifer felt an urge that she must draw the raccoon but she ignored it. She had to act normal. The urge to draw popped again during the second period as she really had to draw the raccoon right then and there. Jennifer, wanting to ignore her raccoon friend, refused to draw it. On the third period&#39;s last minutes the urge was getting really bad. She had to draw it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay geez...&quot; Jennifer murmured herself as the thoughts were teasing her. &quot;Let&#39;s draw that damn raccoon then.&quot;<br />
<br />
 After the lunch Jennifer went to the school&#39;s public bathroom stall to quickly doodle the raccoon. The picture started out nicely as it was her petting the raccoon. Nothing wrong with that. It was a cute quick sketch. Then she had to draw another one. Another cute raccoon drawing where the fuzzy being was hugging her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Two raccoon drawings. That&#39;s good enough. I really need to attend the next class...&quot; Jennifer whispered to herself but she had to draw one more picture. <br />
<br />
&quot;FINE! One more.&quot; Jennifer sighed.<br />
<br />
She begun to draw her frustration on the paper. She wanted to express her feelings on to the paper. Her pent up emotions pouring with every flick and swirl from the pencil. At some point Jennifer had to stop and think what she was drawing. She got so blinded by her feelings that she had drawn something she shouldn&#39;t have had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god. No!&quot; Jennifer gasped as she dropped her pencil on the bathroom floor and quickly closed the sketchbook.<br />
<br />
She quickly stashed the sketchbook on to the deepest end of her backpack and run outside from the bathroom stall to the school hall full of students. She felt conflicted what she had just done. She let her arm do it&#39;s work but her own frustration had caused it to make something she shouldn&#39;t have made.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was too busy in her headspace that she didn&#39;t notice the student in front of her. Accidentally bumping into them as something flew out of her half-opened backpack. It spun to the floor as Jennifer saw one of the other students reaching for it with their hand.<br />
<br />
It was her sketchbook. Jennifer yelled them to stop. Begging them not to open it.<br />
<br />
The kid smiled as it made them even more curious to see what was inside it. Opening the page she had just drawn in the bathroom. Jennifer had dread in her eyes as she knew what was going to happen. The kid&#39;s eyes went wide as they dropped the sketchbook back on to the floor. The kid looked confused as more students approached the mysterious sketchbook and begun to look through it&#39;s contents. Jennifer was in full panic mode as she put both of her arms to her ears to comfort herself. That damn raccoon was ruining her normal life. Why? Why did she had to draw it? Why-why-why!?<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Annabel! Jennifer&#39;s drawing porn!!!&quot; One of Jennifer&#39;s classmates boldly yelled as one of the teachers noticed the commotion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Porn..? Did you say porn!?&quot; Mrs. Annabel asked with a loud tone in their voice and grabbed the sketchbook from the hands of one of the students. Even she couldn&#39;t believe what she was seeing as it broke her mindset of a perfect student.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Jennifer Smith! In to my office. Now!&quot; Mrs. Annabel shouted as Jennifer was dragged to her office by her wrist. &quot;We need to have a meeting with you parents as soon as possible. This is unacceptable! You should know that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn&#39;t hold her tears. This meant more to her than anyone else. She was so careful and had good normal life ahead of herself. Now it was ruined by a single raccoon picture she shouldn&#39;t have drawn. It was like rug being pulled her or maybe even worse. She was sure that it was back to the seventh grade. Again...<br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn&#39;t think of a good reason what to say to her teacher as she had already made her mind. Bringing porn to school was prohibited but bigger problem to Mrs. Annabel was that it was drawn by one of their students. Mrs. Annabel was worried that Jennifer could corrupt other students with her smut work thus ruining the school&#39;s reputation and it&#39;s potential funding. Jennifer had no words to say as the teacher showed her the picture she had done and asked what made her to do it. She didn&#39;t know. She had no good answer why she did it. To her it was just a drawing. Nothing more. Sure it was little bit lewd, okay maybe little wasn&#39;t a good word to describe it, but that&#39;s all. The picture itself didn&#39;t present any harm to anyone. So why was it such a big deal?<br />
<br />
Minutes went by and Jennifer&#39;s mother came straight out of the work to listen what was happening. She was flabbergasted to see what Jennifer had done. Jennifer&#39;s mother tried her best to apologize for her daughter&#39;s weird behaviour but even she had no idea that her daughter was drawing porn inside her sketchbook as she had never opened it. Teacher gave Jennifer a warning and said to keep her drawings hidden from the public eye during the school day. She was allowed to draw at school but porn was unaccepted at their establishment. Mrs. Annabel asked from Jennifer if she wanted to continue her classes for today or go home. To which she replied that she just wanted to go home. Jennifer with her head hanging low hopped inside her mother&#39;s car. Inside there was an awkward silence. Both of them being silent as Jennifer&#39;s mom drove Jennifer back to home and then her mother went back to her work. Jennifer knew that her mother was disappointed at her. First skipping the soccer match and now this.<br />
<br />
Jennifer quietly went to her room to sulk. It was noon and she felt tired. Mentally and physically exhausted. Should she still continue her path with the homework or should she instead do something else to occupy her mind? At this point it felt like that whatever she decided to do didn&#39;t matter that much. Jennifer had a full day ahead of herself but she was feeling off.</p>
