<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">THEN (the story so far)-James had never much enjoyed magic tricks, certainly not enough to volunteer to take part in one as it was pure bad luck to where he ended up being dragged into the apparent rehearsal in the first place while The bigger problem for him was that this turned out not to be a rehearsal. yet it was no trick either as He was a fairly average kind of guy in his late 30s. Tallish, with blue eyes, short dark hair and a shy and slightly awkward disposition that He was handsome, but only in an ordinary, every day sort of way. He had chanced upon the circus after arriving early to meet up with friends and found himself at a loose end with nothing else to entertain him.<br />
<br />
with nothing else for entertainment, he decided to explore. It didn&#39;t seem like it was anything he hadn&#39;t seen plenty of times before, with all of the usual rides, games, and attractions that he was about ready to leave when he felt a pair of eyes resting on him for it was a young woman as she asked him for something. &quot;Hey, could you help me a minute?&quot;<br />
<br />
James turned round to be confronted by one of the most stunningly beautiful girls he had ever laid eyes on as She was around medium height, with long dark hair, piercing blue eyes and a perfect hourglass figure that It was hard to guess her age. even so, James figured she was probably in her early twenties while dressed kind of like a goth, but somehow not quite like the ones he might see on the street. trying not to seem thrown by this gorgeous woman&#39;s sudden request that James&#39;s natural urge to refuse was overcome by his inability to think of a good excuse on the spot, even if all she wanted was someone to be a volunteer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks! Please, come through!&quot; the girl beamed as James followed his new acquaintance into a nearby tent that There wasn&#39;t much in there of note, Just a few dusty old books and some trinkets he didn&#39;t have much interest in taking note of.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Kayla by the way.&quot; she said. he shortly introduced himself to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please to meet your acquaintance. Sorry if I was being pushy earlier, but it would be a shame to waste any time for It&#39;s just so rare that my father would give me any space to practice my magic with.&quot; Kayla said as he figured that maybe she was a magician when he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yeah. a magician? sure.&quot; Kayla replied shiftily as she leafed through one of the books she had laid out on a table in the corner of the room. being her volunteer that what she basically need help with was one of her tricks as it was called &#39;animal magic&#39; for Kayla smiled with a glint in her eye while telling James to just stand still for he even asked if should be in a box or something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, just let me concentrate.&quot; Kayla ordered pushily again as she muttered something under her breath and waggled her fingers into James&#39; direction. James stood politely for a while as Kayla finished her strange incantation that saying she was done, Kayla winked mischievously at James.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, ok.? So what was the trick?&quot; James asked for he was clearly confused about what was going on here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I guess it didn&#39;t work.&quot; Kayla half smiled as if she was trying to hide something, which bothered James a little. as he was starting to figure she was somewhat of an oddball now anyway that he didn&#39;t pay too much attention.<br />
<br />
asking if she needed James any more that James couldn&#39;t help but feel like he was missing something as she grinned back, surprisingly happy. her trick apparently hadn&#39;t worked. &quot;Nah, I&#39;ll probably come and find you later though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, ok. well, catch you later then.&quot; James waved and removed himself from the tent while still confused by the whole experience that Kayla let out the giggle for she had been stifling once James was out of earshot as The spell had worked for sure, but the effects just weren&#39;t immediate.<br />
<br />
she knew he would come and find her again, once he realized that he was turning into an alligator for James was attempting to clear his mind from the strange encounter with Kayla when he left the tent while at a lost in thought though. she could of just been mocking him in some way that she could of been a really bad magician, but she was nice Either way. thinking it was about time to leave as there was no point in hanging around this carnival anymore that He may of well just head back home for he was stuck in this strange backwards town, but at least it was home.<br />
<br />
It seemed like there was nothing else to do at the carnival today that before James arrived back home is when after a short walk is when a cute girl who always seemed to be his next door neighbor smiled at him as he walked past. &quot;hi James, How was the carnival today?&quot; She enquirer. &quot;I was thinking of heading over there myself sometime later today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;don&#39;t bother on going there today. there wasn&#39;t much there, all except a magic show...(low gurgle)!&quot; James responded as The pretty girl politely pretended to not notice the strange involuntary gurgling noise he had let out at the end of his sentence, but she had to ask on Where did that come from that James wondered about it himself.<br />
<br />
the young lady asked if he was ok there as there was anything he may need while thinking on giving it a rain cheek and miss it with a smiled. The lady was visibly trying to look concern while holding in a laugh now that James soon replied. &quot;No, no! I&#39;m good, but thanks anyways -gurgle!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um sorry, just got a little something in my throat.&quot; a little embarrassed for James mumbled by in a way of explanation while he quickly headed into his house that When he got to his room is when he fell and laid down on his bed as he spent a few moments trying to convince himself he didn&#39;t just made a complete fool of himself to her. it was probably just been a strange case of hunger issues when all of a sudden he let out the loud gurgle sound again once more, but This time that he hadn&#39;t even made an attempt to speak as He clasped his hand firmly shut over his mouth when he noticed something strange happening to him.<br />
<br />
it was even more bizarre to him for it was clear to him as it was unmistakable when he saw his hand had scales that He checked his other hand to find it was in the same condition while they ended in claws. they were mostly alligator hands now that James softly said to himself with a panic in his throat. &quot;Ok, they were DEFINITELY not like this before-gurgle.&quot;<br />
<br />
thinking about that girl from the carnival tent for a moment is when James then thought about the girl from the carnival for she did said something about &#39;animal magic&#39; before she muttered some kind of incantation. no, there was no way it could be true for there must be a reason to this that he thought it was a rash, a trick, or something as James was way too logical to believe in witchcraft or anything supernatural like that. panic spreads as James started thinking that There had to be an explanation for this as Jame&#39;s hands weren&#39;t the only problem, so was part of his skin for James took this moment and sat up straight on his bed and tries to figure out what was going on.<br />
<br />
There was no logical explanation he could think of for what was really happening to him, but he felt certain as there must be an answer within the name of science that reaching over for the phone and picked it up to began googling his symptoms. efficiently as he could with his now scaly hands that There was nothing of much use he could find for there were mostly general information about alligators and crocodiles, yet feeling frustrated as He puts the phone down is when he later noticed something even more disturbing for his skin on the back of his hands were now turning into a bluish gray. He quickly pushed up one of his arm sleeves to see that the unwelcome new abnormal pigmentation had spread even further than just his hands, but with no debating as to what&#39;s going on here With a sense of urgency is when he quickly tore off his clothes and stood in front of the tall mirror at the end of the room while unaware of the horror to yet await him.<br />
<br />
looking in horror at What he saw shocked him as an unwelcome shade of bluish gray not only covered his hands, but it also gone and covered most of his body that it was going to his arms, legs, even feet for he simultaneously noticed webbing between his fingers and toes while The rest of his body seemed unaffected by this, for the time at least. For the first time in his life, he had considered the girl from the carnival really had done something unnatural to him for it was clear there were no other medical explanation on what was happening to him that James was quickly trying to collect his own thoughts for a moment, almost beginning to doubt his own sanity on What was happening to him was beyond words as he thought of returning back to the carnival. he also thought of someone seeing him like this that if he knew what was happening next for his changes is where he knew one thing Before long In a panic, he needed help.<br />
<br />
in the mist of the panic, James quickly decided to return back to the carnival as he reclothed himself, even his black speedos for he was naked while despite the moderately warm weather that he soon was slipping on a pair of gloves to cover his hands and rushed out. avoiding eye contact with the girl who by now was sure viewing him as an oddball and jumped into the nearest taxi he could find that Before long, he was back at the carnival as he rushed up to the uninterested young woman who was manning the ticket stall for James tried to appear calm and unphased. he could reasonably manage under the circumstances as he tried to talk to her when a low alligator noise of a gurgle escape him, but he didn&#39;t care about it right now that once they said their hellos is when he asked the ticket lady if she knew where he could find Kayla is when she looked at him with a vacant expression on her face.<br />
<br />
as she felt obliged to ask who she was is where you told her she was with The magician that was working in the tent next to the coconut shy while thinking if it was when another low gurgle escaped from him, yet he was trying to hide it this time. she later told him that There were no magicians here by the name of Kayla with the info of no tents next to the coconut shy as she was then being rude enough to him on asking why he even sound like a gator at her while James felt embarrassment for this conversation. Not wanting to extend this any further is when he pulled out his ticket from earlier and walked briskly past the girl to find Kayla himself, but To his horror that when he got there is where he sees it was longer there as there wasn&#39;t anything to see where the tent had been standing, not much more than an hour ago for he instinctively ran up to the man on the coconut shy which was pushing past a queue of bemused onlookers.<br />
<br />
&quot;excuse me sir, can you tell me Where did the girl in the tent go? the one that was right next to you earlier?&quot; he said as his low alligator gurgle sounds were getting worst for he almost lost his cool, but he didn&#39;t care if he seemed crazy to this stranger now that the man thought James was being funny to him while telling him almost the same thing the ticket lady said to him with the info about there being a few girls which he been next to earlier today in hopes of he mean one of them for the man thought if James was crazy.<br />
<br />
he was beginning to get used to the reaction he was getting at as James then walked away from him and stood alone while trying to collect his own thoughts for a moment for he was beginning to doubt his own sanity on What was happening to him today that standing alone while being Humiliated enough already, James immediately wanted nothing more than to leave this stupid carnival. to his unlucky day though as he had little choice of the matter that even if searching for Kayla while nobody here had any idea on who she was now, there was nowhere else for him to look for her. He figured for as long he didn&#39;t attempt to speak to anyone is where he could still blend in well enough with the crowds, which were dwindling by this point anyway that wandering around for a bit while looking for anything to which might be of use to him. even if it wasn&#39;t Kayla herself that James thought maybe there was a poster, or a flyer which could give him a clue as to her whereabouts are, Unfortunately, there wasn&#39;t any.<br />
<br />
he suddenly felt a strange kind of pressure in his legs without warning as it was also happening on his shoulders which seemed to be forcing him down on all fours for he soon found himself in a crawling position with his belly touching the ground while his arms and legs were spread apart, Despite James resistance that is. trying desperately with all of his might is where he quickly realized he couldn&#39;t stand up anymore on what he was used for escaping this undignified posture now was an impossibility as All hopes of blending in with the rest of society were slipping away from him that the people around him were Already giving him strange looks for this included a few people he recognized from the line up at the coconut shy earlier. Unable to walk anymore is where James started to crawl forwards for He was surprised by this behavior as he was also a little dismayed on how natural it felt with him, almost like really was walking that he could maneuver himself more quickly away from the crowds at least while some of the people were polite enough to pretend to not notice him.<br />
<br />
he soon had attracted to much attention of a group of kids and young adults that they pointing and laughing while following after him for one sounded like a girl quickly shouted out at him. &quot;oh, my, god. look at him. he thinks he&#39;s some kind of reptile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ah cool, it&#39;s a reptilian man!&quot; another chimed in as One of the older boys began filming this strange grown up on his camera phone while a young teenage girl climbed on his back, strapped on a ball gag over him, and did a kind of role play that she was ridding him now. Mercifully, a strange young woman of James&#39; own age had rushed over and pulled them away from him and scolded them for their misbehavior that he assumed it was Kayla for She looked briefly at James with a strange mixture of sympathy with a hint of a smile and disgust before she disappeared when she walked away quickly.<br />
<br />
Trying not to dwell on the incident anymore is when he then did his best to quickly rush out towards some woodlands and found himself a few hundred meters away from the carnival area as he was Alone at last for he had separated himself from the rest of humanity that it was in some senses of relief to him, but this also made him feel more like an animal now then what he did before for he was now even further away from resolving his problems while ripping off his gloves, shoes, socks, and all he could for His hands and feet were now almost fully those of a reptile. he could move about more easily now as His attempt to decide on his next move was cut short by the sudden distraction of a woman&#39;s laughter is where James was unsure how anyone had managed to sneak up on him like this for when he look up, he was in shock for James was soon confronted by the beautiful sight of the very source of his problems that Try as he might is where he quickly forgot about the ball gag. still strapped on him as he struggled to get it off of him that it was to no use with his alligator like hands while feeling humiliated as he cried for help to her for it wasn&#39;t long Before he had finally found who he was looking for, Kayla.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s cute how you&#39;re still trying to resist my spell for it&#39;s Completely futile of course, but cute nonetheless. still though, you Having fun yet?&quot; Kayla said with a quick winked at him that James was looking up at her with a mixture of anger and apprehension, yet he forgot he still had a ball gag strapped in his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;muhd! muud mmmhph -low gurgle- Mmmmptpm!? (translated from muffle talk) why! Why are you - &#39;&#39;low gurgle escaped slipped from him as he tried to hide it this time&quot; - doing this to me!?&quot;. James demanded to know as Kayla soon approached to remove the ball gag he was wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I kinda know what you said there that the answer is, Because I can.&quot; Kayla responded nonchalantly while unfastening the gag that once fully off him, she inspecting her fingernails for she was anything but malicious as Any pretense had now been dropped.<br />
<br />
&quot;please. *cough x3* Will you - gurgle - reverse this curse?&quot; James asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I will, maybe I won&#39;t as it&#39;s Probably not going to happen anytime soon that You won&#39;t be very interesting on changing back though. once you&#39;re fully transformed into just a regular alligator that is though, I&#39;ve would of eventually found myself another sucker to toy around with instead by the time it happens. Kayla said as she shrugged your plea off.<br />
<br />
&quot;w- wait a minute, - gurgle - You can&#39;t do this! if you don&#39;t turn me back, - gurgle - I may end up probably attacking you!&quot; James said as he try to plea again with her, while making a very good point to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta be honest with you James, being stuck as a gator while spending the rest of your life like this..., is not as bad as you think. still, I think we&#39;ve already established that I can by now. so don&#39;t get mad at me&quot; Kayla began to say while slowly kneeling down next to him that she began petting him, like a pet.<br />
<br />
&quot;yet you do make an excellent point there, so I&#39;ll let you retain your human mind as you&#39;ll appreciate every moment of things that I&#39;ll even preserve your human lifespan while also giving you a ripped humanoid structure, but everything else as your face will begin to grow out more into an alligator&#39;s with a snout for the tail will soon come after words. oh, And because I&#39;m such a nice witch that you won&#39;t fully be larger for you&#39;ll only reach to be 7 feet tall.&quot; Kayla said nicely as she tossed two kinds of out items out near the lack for one of them was a pair of red shorts while the other were a pair of black speedo like underwear, once she was out of the water that is.<br />
<br />
&quot;hear, you&#39;ll need these. I won&#39;t be sticking around though that when you&#39;re ready, you&#39;ll come find me in the carnival area. I do hope that you like what I did for you as It doesn&#39;t get to boring for you, but you&#39;d better watch out for any stray eyes wandering around you. who knows what they will think, or even do to you if they even see you like this now.&quot; Kayla sneered while picking up his discarded clothing that James could hardly believe what this crazy witch was saying to him as it was coming out from her words.<br />
<br />
&quot;y-you&#39;re joking, right?&quot; James asked. thinking that this had to be some kind of a sick joke, right?!<br />
<br />
&quot;sorry, but i&#39;m not the one who&#39;s joking here. Oh, and that reminds me of an idea to make this more fun and speed things up a little. until you become into your new form that From now on, every time you make those alligator noses you start to make will is where you&#39;ll be transformed further. Pretty cool huh?&quot; Kayla finally said as she then waved her hand that all of a sudden, there was only one thing he knew actually what to do to satisfy his strange craving for James became ravenously nervous of making them now.<br />
<br />
he tried to keep his yap shut, but it didn&#39;t help to stop his new urges though while she saw the conflicted and confused look on James&#39; face is where James fears started to become panics as something deep down wanted to tell her off for he struggled to keep himself from doing so that he may accidentally let out a gator sound is when he quickly shoved his scaly alligator hands over his mouth in desperation. Kayla winked as she laughed up a bit that James knew this was done by Kayla&#39;s magic for there was no escaping, nor stopping it. &quot;Haha! not being talkev now, are we? well then, We&#39;ll see about that now, won&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;this way, the transformation will be finished in no time. Oh! and by the way, you&#39;ll find that I&#39;ve made you one more thing to expect later on in the future as it will be more effective to see how nice I am to you. catch you later! I got bigger fish to fry! remember, I&#39;ll be watching.!&quot; Kayla finally said as she then vanished from his sight, leaving James now a very poor unfortunate gator-man to contemplate on what just happened to him that it wasn&#39;t a complete lost though for he was somewhat necked, but he could fully stand up now while fully able to use his arms and legs once more while knowing James had to figure out a plan out of this.<br />
<br />
slowly walking out of the lake is where James couldn’t believe his luck for there he was, stuck in the pond midd-ways while turning into some kind of alligator that could completely walk on twos, covered in scales, and had webbed hands and feet of an alligator. How could he have been so stupid to follow Kayla’s desires on Staying afterwards from the show as it was the dumbest thing he had ever did in his life. Honestly though…James did it because he thought Kayla was super hot! Stupid, dick!<br />
<br />
James looked around for he was sure that the sorcerer was there in the trees, or somewhere while trying to see his demise. out of the water as He couldn’t really go back naked for He had no idea what he was going to do next that Maybe she was right…he had to content on being some kind of gator-man, forever. Even if he didn’t continue to transform fully that she would either turn him back completely when he returns, or he’d have to live out in the woods and starve to death as James looked down ashamed and noticed how his feet were although human sized were completely reptilian while The same thing could be said for his hands.<br />
<br />
“Damn it…gurgle!” as his throat involuntarily made an unexpected alligator noise they make that James only wished it was only his own voice talking, but what could he do for it sounded...good. He swore so much in his mind that Kayla had made him so mad as James looked at the water and spotted his reflection for in the water surface, he saw his reptilian mouth grew out into a snout.<br />
<br />
“no! Don’t do it! James, Don’t do…gurgle.” his new voice was cut short for it was almost as if uncontrolled. he soon started to panic for what was now coming out of his voice were the sounds of what you would hear from an alligator.<br />
<br />
“Gurgle gurgle! Gurgle gurgle gurgle? jaw snapped opened wide as he quickly snapped his newly snout shut tight! Gurgle gurgle! Gurgle! Gurgle.....Gurgle!? GURGLE!&quot; James made these noises in frustration as he attempted to make human noises once again, but it was all to no avail for What Kayla had threatened to him was true. making these strangely noises had now cost him his ability to communicate with other humans, not that they would be able to help him anyway as there might be one person who could rescue him now for it was probably Kayla.<br />
<br />
Just as these thought hit him, James started hearing laughter echoing around him from the trees for it was as if in a mocking response to any optimism he may still hold that he didn&#39;t want to give this crazy woman the satisfaction of reacting. he Instead walked away from the pond and the temptation of the possibility of what it may bring James as he He looked back with disgust at the thought of swimming in the mucky water behind him. there was No way he going to stay here and become one hell of a monster that&#39;s part man and part gator for there had to be some way of reversing this magic, there had to be.<br />
<br />
thinking about the things Kayla said that Didn&#39;t she mention something about her father he wondered for he Surely wouldn&#39;t approve of this behavior, not from her own daughter. perhaps there was someone else at the carnival who knew about her malicious magic and how to counteract it, but embarrassing as it was that James knew he had to head back to the carnival in his current form and try and find someone there who&#39;s willing to help him out of this mess. looking back at the clothing she had left behind for him that he did felt embarrassed on thinking to get help naked as he soon grabbed them and slipped on the tight black speedo like underwear for it even showed off his bulging crotch that once it was fastened, he slipped on his red boxer shorts.<br />
<br />
Even if all he could do was make nothing but gator noises now that at least people could see there was something wrong and try to help for it was better then his other option to accept spending the rest of his life here, until someone out there spots him. Apart from finding anyone who would be willing, or able to help him out that there was another pressing problem as it was almost an unnatural level of letting out gator sounds which were readily available to him in great abundance. He knew he had to resist though, if he didn&#39;t want to change more for there was no telling what, or how significant the next change would be.<br />
<br />
NOW (back onto the story at hand)-James decided that it was best to find Kayla&#39;s father now for maybe he could help him out of this mess he got himself into. for What he had heard of him, he sounded like a serious man that would disprove of his daughter&#39;s ways...or could simply resent James annoyance and punish him even harder then what he&#39;s already is. still though, he was desperate At that moment to go through with his plan now then anything to go by.<br />
<br />
moving from the murky waters and across the wasteland to get back to the Carnival area, he would go around the tents and sneak in his head each one at a time while a show would be on. finally arriving at the Carnival behind the thickets line van that He was sweating as he felt it dripping from his armpits and joints for not only was his scaly skin getting more of a bluish gray, but it was also getting wet and humid for his demise. James sighed as he passed trough the Carnival behind the tents - so far so good for nobody had watched him that he got nearby the main circus tent when he heard the announcement yell out: &quot;the marvelous Zarusto, the oriental magician&quot;.<br />
<br />
An alligator&#39;s bellow out of him! He said that it was Zarusto for he had to be clearly Kayla&#39;s dad. He heard footsteps and was quick to rush in fear of getting discovered that he dashed over to the end of the Carnival and rested near a tent as it smelled like manure, unaware of his size growing by a foot.<br />
<br />
There was an ample space between that tent and the main tent in which any person walking there could spot him. still, fearing of being discovered by a circus artist, or anyone at the mater that James raised the drapes and entered the tent. once Inside, there was a complex of jails with caged animals that one of them was A lion who was sitting near the edge looking curiously at him almost like a house cat looks at a toy.<br />
<br />
telling himself to wait There unit the show was over, so he could talk to the magician. Meanwhile, he only had to wait in the tent full of smelly animals and manure. Quiet happily with this for there seems to be a bear in one as your thoughts were to fight it in a ring, tasting him while in the ring as another bellow escape your throat.<br />
<br />
he cursed himself as he felt the magic working immediately for his air in his lungs involuntarily filled up, changing his trachea and with a deep hipcup that something changed. Something he wasn&#39;t quite sure as to what it was. It had to at least be something with the sensations he was getting for he couldn&#39;t quite point it out.<br />
<br />
when he later looked at his reflection on the metal of the jails, he discovered it to be his eyes for they had became gator like. eyes with an inner eyelid to your outer eyelids, beautiful thin diamond shape of pupils that could be mistaken for a cats, and sparkling greenish yellow iris. not only They can see all around, could track down different targets, but they are retractable in battle for they could also see well at night.<br />
<br />
taking the advantage that everyone was in the main show this was the time to exit out of there and noisy on around the circus tents to sneak inside Zarusto&#39;s tent. A yellow velvet cloak was spread over the main pole that even His tent had an oriental touch in everything: a circular mantra rug on the middle, a mahogany desk, and piles of books. James thought that they were Probably magic books and looked around with more hope in his fate as He could probably find something there to turn him back, Or maybe he shouldn&#39;t because bellowing like an alligator wouldn&#39;t be the best way to communicate with Zarusto. The best part: the tent reeked of incense for it was also quiet, so there was no bugs crawling or flying around as it was the best place where he wouldn&#39;t make a sound.<br />
<br />
James leaped and checked into some of the books for his gator hands were still functioning to an extent. He tried to flip some pages to see their content, maybe he would be lucky enough to find one with a ritual to end this spell he&#39;s under that The books were the most variable for Zarusto was an avid reader it seemed. He had cookbooks, philosophy, and political books, children books and of course magic books.<br />
<br />
still looking though them at a time that there was still nothing about rituals or spells to undo anything he was under, not even about alligators. How? How was this possible?!<br />
<br />
BELLOWING so loudly that James cursed his luck, more then what he expected to be as something started to slip out of his shorts. Everything about what witches and warlocks did, was to change people into animals, right? well, That would be a basic spell for he then spotted a massive book that it could of came from the medieval times as it was with a hard red cover.<br />
<br />
James walked over a pile of books while splatting them on the ground that he put his hand in the heavy book by opening it up to turn the page after page. Each one had a picture with acute writings on their side as he continued to flip them, until he&#39;d finds a gator. He was sure it would be in here soon, but That&#39;s when by turning one page over to see a few pages were torn from this book. THE PAGES WERE MISSING!<br />
<br />
It took him a second to realize that the page he was looking for might of been one of those torn pages he needed to turn back as it was now hopeless to find it here. like someone wanted James to not find the pages of the book that this made him bellow up inside. giving off with a big roar that you bellowed out uncontrollably as you just wanted this to just end.<br />
<br />
regaining back control that James told himself to closed his eyes and tried to numb his senses for He couldn&#39;t see it, but his mouth started to water. quickly opening his eyes back up again to see that James had cursed Kayla in the head as he felt his face being stretched out like putty, fully becoming his snout! what was once James to be noticeable as a human were now gone for he still had a bit more of his tail yet to grow while reaching seven feet tall.<br />
<br />
CRACK! CRACK!<br />
<br />
James&#39; spine shifted it&#39;s placed as His tights squeezed his pants which magically stayed on. He stumbled back scared and fell on the rug for His belly button was gone, and so was his genitals. worse of all, he was now a giant gator without most of its tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this I see?!&quot;, the potent voice shocked me. With a jump of a scare, James faced Kayla&#39;s Father coming from the other side of the tent.<br />
<br />
&quot;bellow! bellow!&quot;  James tried to explain. clapping his butt cheeks to his tail fully grow out, as it somehow felt a shamefully pleasant to the touch that his tail wagged like a dog when they&#39;re happy about something.<br />
<br />
just then, the tent&#39;s cloak opened up as Kayla was now entering, grabbing her father&#39;s arm and doing the sweetest girly voice she could. &quot;there he is daddy! that&#39;s the man that tried to harass me!&quot;<br />
<br />
BELLOW?! translate to what James just said. WHAT?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, father, I only cursed him to teach him a lesson while defending my self. what are you going to do with him?&quot; she said as James couldn&#39;t believe what she was saying about him. not only she was lying about harassing her in front of her father like that, but she was trying to make James look more like the bad guy here. still, it was MR. Zarusto&#39;s decision.</p>
