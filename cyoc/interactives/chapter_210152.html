<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot; Thad,  come on! Last one in the pool is a rotten egg!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no you don&#39;t!&quot;<br />
<br />
Thad ran to the pool and dove in. Chad was holding his breath after being submerged.  Thad seemed to have forgotten he was wearing Chad. Maybe he thought he was imagining things. Thad had swum over to where the other water polo players were gathered around Coach Sanchez. Chad was bored, as Coach explained basic water polo to the new players, but being a new player Thad hung on every word.<br />
<br />
They started with a basic passing drill. Chad found himself correcting Thad&#39;s form. Coach praised Thad as a natural water polo player.  As practice continued,  Thad realized how he was channeling Chad, absorbing his skills, memories and thoughts.  Chad briefly tried to resist but being Thad&#39;s Speedo,  Chad realized that Thad totally pwned him.<br />
<br />
In the sauna afterward, Thad joined in with the players&#39; circle jerk ritual despite Chad&#39;s pleas and protests. <br />
<br />
Thad started to dress over his sauna dried Speedo. Chad was furious. Thad&#39;s whole attitude had changed since he found that he could acquire Chad&#39;s abilities just by wearing Chad. Any thought of helping Chad become human again took a long second place to getting as many of Chad&#39;s abilities, and skills as possible. Thad felt he had only scratched the surface of getting Chad&#39;s abilities as his own. He know longer thought of his new Speedo as his poor transformed swimsuit, he thought of it as his magic Speedo.<br />
<br />
He figured that Chad&#39;s prowess in the pool was just starting to siphon into Thad. Now he&#39;d go clubbing tonight, and gain some of Chad&#39;s prowess in the bed. He popped wood just thinking about putting as many names in Chad&#39;s blackbook in his own black book.<br />
<br />
 Chad tried to convince Thad that if he just helped him turn back into a man, Chad would tutor him in whatever he wanted. Thad just scoffed at that thought.<br />
<br />
That night, Thad stood in front of the mirror checking himself out before going clubbing. It was Chad&#39;s turn to scoff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what should I wear, if I&#39;m going to get lucky? His t shirt, athletic socks, baggy jeans and sneakers ended up on the floor.  Chad guided Thad to dress in a red tank top, tight black skinny jeans, black socks, black boots, and a dress shirt worn open with the sleeves rolled up. <br />
<br />
Looking good, now to accessorize, thought Chad.<br />
<br />
Turned out Thad didn&#39;t have any necklaces or bracelets. He did have a bunch of leather cords in his desk drawer.  Chad soon had Thad cutting and twisting and tying them until he was wearing a leather choker and a couple of bracelets.<br />
<br />
Now you look like somebody, the ladies will like to go to bed with, thought Chad. He was figuring after he got Thad bedded l, Thad would be grateful,  and give up on wearing Chad 24/7. Before Thad left, Chad had Thad empty his wallet, and put his ID and cash in his front pockets. Got to show off your butt, Thad. Oh, and take a few condoms. Be safe.<br />
<br />
It was kind of cool seeing through Thad&#39;s eyes, as he drove to the Waterfront District where all the good Clubs were. Chas had expected him to stop at Checkers or The Spot, but he drove passed them. When he pulled into Club Adonis, Chad exclaimed, &quot;But Thad, this is a gay club!&quot;<br />
<br />
Thad just smiled, and adjusted his crotch. He said, &quot;I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thad easily banged a couple strangers in the bathroom, took one outside and did one behind a curtain.  Chad&#39;s playbook for bedding women worked surprisingly well on guys. Just change beautiful breasts to handsome bulge, thought Chad. Then Thad had spotted number 5.<br />
<br />
Thad slept in Chad, and only Chad that night. While Chad lay awake under the dark warm covers the whole time reliving Thad&#39;s successful bedding of a half dozen guys including Chad&#39;s college going brother Brad. <br />
<br />
Brad was the last score of the night. Brad had been two sheets to the wind, when Thad spotted his ass from 10 feet away. Brad was dancing with a shirtless swanky bleached blond 30 something. Chad didn&#39;t recognize his brother at first. It was Mardi Gras Night at Club Adonis, and while Thad sported the little paper masks that were handed out at the door, Brad was wearing a leather executioner&#39;s hood, black leather harness, and tight black shorts with black cowboy boots as he danced. Chad advised that Thad cut in, and sweep the cowgirl - er cowboy off his feet, then get him to go outside, and do him in his car. Thad came up, and following Chad&#39;s tried and trusted moves grabbed Brad&#39;s butt cheek and spun him around so that their flesh pressed together.  Bare skin and leather grinding into cloth, bulging crotches grinding into each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;So handsome want to go outside for some private action?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I usually deliver that line, stud. Got a van out in the lot, if you think you&#39;re man enough,&quot; said the husky male voice.<br />
<br />
Chad didn&#39;t make the connection.  Brad was taller than Chad, and looking down from Thad&#39;s eyes, Chad forgot how much taller Thad was than either of the brothers. In truth Brad was only a half inch taller than Chad, but Chad still had looked up at him.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s playbook took over. Maintain control. Aggressive bitches can&#39;t get the upper hand, Thad. Invite yourself into his van.<br />
<br />
Chad dictated like Cyrano to Thad, as he spoke to Brad, &quot;I&#39;m more than man enough cowboy. So show me to your cozy van, and we&#39;ll 69 and wrassle for a bit. I&#39;ve got condoms for each of us.<br />
<br />
Chad didn&#39;t recognize Brad&#39;s van in the weird orange low sodium lighting of the parking lot. All the colors looked wrong. Besides checking out the van wasn&#39;t a priority.  <br />
<br />
After Thad scored with the first guy in the bathroom stall, Chad discovered he could share Thad&#39;s orgasms. He had been lukewarm at first to hitting on guys, but sex was sex and Chad was all about sex.<br />
<br />
The van was upholstered, and a half dozen wadded up used condoms suggested Thad wasn&#39;t the first guest that night or maybe week.<br />
<br />
Chad and his unknown brother really did their best to outdo the other in giving head. The first one to cum would be the other&#39;s bottom. Thad didn&#39;t mind the idea either way, but Chad had to top. He used every trick girls had used on him. He got Brad to cum first, and keeping cumming until his balls were dry. The whole time he concentrated on sports stats to keep Thad from succumbing to Brad&#39;s wicked tonsilar ministrations. Finally, the hooded stud was drained, and Thad couldn&#39;t hold it any longer. So swiftly, Chad had Thad get up, lift the hooded stud&#39;s legs over Thad&#39;s shoulders, and popped the former stud&#39;s cherry. Chad was getting off pumping Thad&#39;s cock in and out of the masked stud, when the hood slid back off his face revealing Brad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brad?&quot; gasped Chad and Thad as their minds were one in rutting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? Oh, fuck you&#39;re good. Do I know you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re Chad&#39;s brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thad. I go to school with Chad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet. Don&#39;t mention this to him okay?&quot; Brad asked looking down at his own boner with the entire hard length of Thad&#39;s shaft buried inside him, he added, &quot;Are you done?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad was angry and horny now. Brad was keeping secrets. <br />
<br />
Thad felt Chad&#39;s invigoration,  and said, &quot;Not by half.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thad and Chad resumed thrusting. Brad&#39;s ass was sorely pounded, and Brad&#39;s cock managed to spurt out a few more drops of cum, as Thad relentlessly pumped 3 more loads into Brad&#39;s sorry ass. Both young men were drenched with sweat. Brad passed out. Thad managed to pull Brad&#39;s blanket over them before exhaustion and alcohol took him too. Chad discovered that Speedos never sleep.</p>
