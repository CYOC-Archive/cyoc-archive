<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wolves have been enemies with humans throughout history. Though ementy was mostly one-sided on the humans&#39; part. Wolves are apex predators that are meant to keep prey species from overpopulating. And as man encroached more upon their habitats, they came into more and more conflict, particularly where livestock was involved. The North American population of grey wolves had been nearly wiped. But now people were a lot more aware of how they were affecting their environment and the role wolves played. Wolves have made quite a comeback since then.<br />
<br />
However, some people are a little too accepting of wolves. To them, wolves were not any different from the domesticated dogs they&#39;re related to. But wolves are wild animals, not to be kept as pets. There was a man in Wyoming who thought he could keep a pack of wolves on his property and feed them mostly with kibble. Authorities had busted his private zoo and removed the wolves from his custody. Letting the wolves go was not possible, considering how familiar they are with humans and unafraid of them. Such wolves would most likely end up going to proper zoos, but Animalia had an interest in these wolves.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Four wolves were brought to Horizon Labs. They were accustomed to humans and they&#39;ve been given plenty of meat to keep them full. But they did growl a bit at the handlers as they were being led to the changing room. These wolves won&#39;t simply be uplifted, like many of the members of the APD. These wolves were going to be a part of Project Hermaphroditus and things were expected to be a bit messier.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope these wolves won&#39;t react to the change too badly,&quot; said one scientist, &quot;Being uplifted is one thing, but changing genders is another.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what I&#39;ve seen, uplifted animals react pretty well,&quot; said Judy, &quot;The hermaphrodites did say they were confused, but they adjusted pretty well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; called a female voice. Judy and the scientist turned to see a woman running towards them. She stopped to catch her breath as soon as she got close enough. &quot;You haven&#39;t started that uplifting yet, have you?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were getting ready to start,&quot; said the scientist, &quot;And you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Lunette. I&#39;m volunteering to join with those wolves,&quot; said Lunette.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you need to be cleared with Dr. Jones before-&quot; started the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it right here,&quot; said Lunette, holding up a piece of paper, &quot;I&#39;m ready as ever to go herm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er...what are you wearing?&quot; asked Judy, calling attention to Lunette&#39;s clothes. She looked like she was wearing a sexy version of Red Riding Hood. That was not something that uncommon in Lyre or Animalia, though this was an odd time of the year for it. What was odd was that it looked to be mainly made of cheap plastic and cotton.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this is one of the Ripaway costumes from Ms. Vivian&#39;s boutique,&quot; said Lunette.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ripaway?&quot; asked the scientist skeptically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, some people want to really roleplay with their conversions, including the parts where their clothes get destroyed,&quot; said Lunette, &quot;Ms. Vivian has these special one-use costumes designed to rip easily so people can have that fun without getting hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If they&#39;re not meant to be returned or worn more than once, I imagine they must cost a lot,&quot; said Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s part of the reason for the cheap material,&quot; said Lunette, &quot;But they are a bit pricey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, her paperwork checks out,&quot; said the scientist, &quot;If you just wait a few minutes, we&#39;ll have the wolves uplifted and ready to convert you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m not waiting for them to change first,&quot; said Lunette, &quot;I&#39;m changing with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you shouldn&#39;t be in there when they&#39;re changing,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s gonna happen? Am I gonna get infected?&quot; asked Lunette sarcastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;The wolves will be going through an intense change,&quot; said Judy, &quot;You could get hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those wolves are used to people, aren&#39;t they?&quot; asked Lunette.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes, but they aren&#39;t used to you,&quot; said Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;But they could use someone to help them get adjusted to be sapient,&quot; said Lunette, &quot;As well get used to their new bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
The scientist and Judy exchanged looks before the scientist said, &quot;Well, the wolves have recently been fed and she <i>is</i> wanting to be converted like them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don&#39;t do anything too stupid,&quot; said Judy, &quot;It may take them a while to become more than wild animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m good with dogs,&quot; said Lunette.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Lunette was soon put into the same room as the wolves. The meat they had been given had been given a generous helping of salt, which made the wolves pretty thirsty. As soon as Lunette poured the water that had been treated with the hermaphrodite strain of the Animalia virus, the wolves started lapping it up. Lunette just sat on the bed and waited. While they didn&#39;t seem particularly aggressive, she didn&#39;t want to push her luck until they had more human minds.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the wolves started groaning and whining. Their bodies quivered as they started growing. Their shoulders became a lot broader and more flexible as their front legs bulked up, paws expanding into functional hands. Their legs were getting bulky too as their hips adjusted to a bipedal position. Lunette didn&#39;t keep track which were originally male and which were female. But they all started moaning as a large pair of breasts started pushing out of their chests. At the same time, their canine dicks were growing larger than ever, some emerging from newly-formed sheathes. The former males grunted as the skin behind their balls opened into new vaginas while the former females grunted as a new pair of balls dropped down between their dicks and vaginas.<br />
<br />
In the end, four anthro wolves stood in front of Lunette. Each of them had the standard amazonian combination of curves and muscles. Though their shoulders were a bit broader than most females and while they each had a very sizeable pair of breasts, they also had an erect dick and balls between their legs.<br />
<br />
One wolf looked around the room and asked, &quot;Where are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are these?&quot; asked another wolf, holding up hir new breasts.<br />
<br />
A third wolf was stroking hir dick. &quot;I don&#39;t remember having this before,&quot; shi said.<br />
<br />
The last wolf reached behind to feel hir vagina. &quot;I don&#39;t remember having this either,&quot; shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where you guys are is Horizon Labs,&quot; said Lunette, &quot;You were brought here to become part of Animalia, a community of uplifted animals like yourselves. Though with you four, you also became part of Project Hermaphroditus, which is why you have both male and female body parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are?&quot; asked one wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Lunette and I can help you guys get adjusted to being like this,&quot; said Lunette. She spread her legs and added, &quot;But first, I want to be like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As was well-known, freshly-changed Animalians are rather horny and these wolves have a double dose of hormones in their bodies now. &quot;Well, I think I&#39;d like to give this new thing a try,&quot; said one wolf, tugging at hir dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s room for all of us,&quot; said another wolf doubtfully.<br />
<br />
The closest wolf moved over to hir and hugged hir, allowing their breasts and dicks to rub against each other. &quot;We can make room for each other,&quot; shi said in a seductive tone.<br />
<br />
The other two wolves moved in on Lunette. One wolf easily tore her panties off before shi started rubbing hir tip against Lunette&#39;s pussy. Lunette moaned as she felt the wolf starting to enter her. &quot;Let me have a taste of those,&quot; she said before holding one of the wolf&#39;s tits and putting her lips to the nipple. Warm wolf milk started pouring down her throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t forget me,&quot; said the second wolf, hir cock close to Lunette&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
Lunette took her mouth off of the first wolf&#39;s nipple and stroked the other wolf&#39;s shaft. &quot;I&#39;m not gonna leave you out,&quot; she said, giving the head a few licks. She could feel warmth going through her own breasts as they started growing bigger and fur start appearing on them. She also could feel her clit getting bigger and thicker. &quot;Just give me a few seconds and you can start riding my cock,&quot; said Lunette, her smile getting a little more predatory as her teeth grew sharper and her lips turned black.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Judy was waiting a little impatiently at the changing room&#39;s door. They had been in there for over half an hour now. Shouldn&#39;t they be done? Judy knocked on the door and said loudly, &quot;Lunette? Are you finished in there yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
She heard the sound of pawsteps approaching the door. The lock clicked and the door open. The herm wolf standing at the door was Lunette, though shi could only identified by hir blonde hair and the tattered remains of her red cape. Shi was taller, buffer, curvier, and covered with tawny fur, which happened to be matted down in a few spots. There was little question by what, considering the smell of sex was really thick on hir. Hir dick was still halfway out of its sheath. &quot;Oh, hey there,&quot; said Lunette, &quot;I guess we lost track of time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I can see the conversion worked perfectly,&quot; said Judy, backing up a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a dream,&quot; said Lunette, &quot;Those guys really know how to have fun in bed. You wanna join us for a romp?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No thank you,&quot; said Judy. While she was hardly prudent about sex (she was a rabbit after all), having sex with predators was a little too daunting. The dual-sexed nature of this particular predators wasn&#39;t a big hindrance, but it made it more awkward. &quot;But I do need to remind you that the five of you will need to be evaluated physically and psychologically,&quot; said Judy, &quot;It&#39;s a policy for new species and...deviations from species.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, fine,&quot; said Lunette, &quot;I guess we need to get cleaned up. But there&#39;s no shower in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a room where you can wash up,&quot; said Judy, &quot;I&#39;ll get you some towels and you can head over.&quot; She headed off, a waft of air blowing some of the smell in that room after her. Judy&#39;s nose wrinkled a little at the heavy smell of sex. That changing room was going to need a thorough cleaning before it could be used again.</p>
