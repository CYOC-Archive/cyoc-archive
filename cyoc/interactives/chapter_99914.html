<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frances was quiet for a moment regarding Yvette&#39;s statements. Some of it seemed to indicate that her parents&#39; relationship was incestuous, which according to the basics that she got in the medical program that was more of a &quot;graduate school program&quot; that the Moon Lake college ran to deal with were-biology and psychology specifically, that weres were not immune to genetic difficulties that resulted from incest, and that might explain what was medically wrong with Yvette Smith. She made a mental note to update the detectives investigating Bartholomew Smith on that possibility. It might not fully help them, but it would at least give them more information to work with.<br />
<br />
Frances checked her watch for a moment and saw that she still had some time and figured to keep going with the consultation with Yvette. If she could get enough information down in fewer trips, that&#39;d be better for everyone trying to wrap up the case and clean up the mess that Yvette Smith had caused. A part of her did want to know more regarding Yvette&#39;s claim of her sexuality changing, but that was more a personal curiosity and could wait until AFTER she&#39;d gotten enough information to determine the reasoning for Yvette&#39;s actions in relation to picking out William Anderson out of all the men in Moon Lake, forcing him to become a werefox, and the obsessing over him. The switch in her sexuality would have to wait for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... when we&#39;d last talked... you&#39;d said you were essentially looking to show your mother that you could be a better mother than she could,&quot; Frances began, &quot;How was to relate with wanting to be a model? Or with what you&#39;d done in the past before you made that decision?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t it matters all that much... I mean... models can have families,&quot; Yvette commented, &quot;and as a were... my metabolism would easily chew up the pregnancy fat after the kit is born. And...all weres are beautiful and sexy... things people want in models.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances didn&#39;t directly answer to that. Weres were definitely attractive physically and a modelling agency could surely look to wanting a female were for those reasons, though in Frances experience, most normals when they looked to a female weres were looking more for someone to have sex with rather than seeing true beauty. Frances even remembered from one of her med school classes that she had to take outside of Moon Lake. By that time, she had been a werecat for years, was fully mature, and engaged to Samantha, and she overheard some other classmates at that med school make their commentary, which Frances had overheard as: &quot;did you see the rack on her? I would to examine them, if you know what I mean.&quot; And while Frances was flattered at being thought attractive, she knew that the man&#39;s mind was on one... or rather two things... that wouldn&#39;t necessarily turn to a career as a fashion model.<br />
<br />
In fact, from what Frances and Samantha had seen on some television programs, most fashion model agencies seemed to prefer women who were not as voluptuous as female weres were. The only ones that they had figured would likely interested in female weres would be swimsuit modelling agencies, or agencies that catered more toward &quot;sex&quot; with lingerie models, FHM, and Maxim being the most tame and all out porn being the most common for weres, as far as Frances knew. In fact Moon Lake&#39;s lone strip club also ran a monthly magazine of were-porn for both males and females. However, if Yvette turned to that, she would pretty much be doing exactly what her mother had done in the past, which she had said she wanted to get away from in their first consultation.<br />
<br />
&quot;But wouldn&#39;t such work keep you busy?&quot; Frances wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;For awhile, I suppose,&quot; Yvette commented, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t mean I couldn&#39;t do better than mom did. And if I did find a bonded mate... he&#39;d be there and could help while I&#39;m pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Frances commented as she continued writing her notes, &quot;did you have any choice of male when you decided to go looking for an actual mate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvette raised a hand up to her mouth for a moment, and then shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;On some level... the choice didn&#39;t matter,&quot; Yvette answered, &quot;I was quite happy to settle down with anyone who would have wanted to... but in the end I really had to settle for the older men...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any reason why?&quot; Frances asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably my past and the things I&#39;d done... it isn&#39;t like my classmates didn&#39;t notice that I was going to see the sugar daddies... even if I didn&#39;t give them sex... it&#39;s not like others didn&#39;t notice and didn&#39;t assume that,&quot; Yvette answered. Frances then watched as the werevixen looked down and sighed heavily, &quot;and I suppose that was my fault. That... I&#39;d wanted to show my mom up so much that I wrecked a lot in my life in the process.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on...&quot; Frances urged.<br />
<br />
Yvette was quiet for a moment, and was still looking down, as if she was actually collecting herself before she answered, &quot;Anyway... I was left having to settle for looking toward older men... many of them were some of the sugar daddies that I&#39;d gone to in the past. Though... many of them proved to be interested ONLY in sex. They were too wedded to their own money to really want to connect with me beyond sex. It made me realize that I wouldn&#39;t get a mate from within Moon Lake... at least not easily.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you started following those who moved too Moon Lake?&quot; Frances asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Yvette admitted weakly, &quot;I suppose that&#39;s why I actually settled on William Anderson. He was older... which meant he had to be experienced and fit in with those who had accepted me. He was fairly handsome even as a normal, which was nice. And at first... I didn&#39;t know he was married and when I went his house for the first time to introduce myself...&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvette paused again and looked away from Frances. It sounded as if she actually was regretful with regard to her actions, which was a bit of a surprise to Frances, but so far, Yvette was getting to why she had picked William out so firmly, which was the prime reason for Frances&#39;s present task in the sense of evaluating Yvette&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;And well... I heard him arguing with someone... a woman... who I found out later was his wife Martha,&quot;  Yvette answered, &quot;they were arguing about whether or not they had made a good discussion in coming to Moon Lake... like it wasn&#39;t a good place or that they were risking who they were and couldn&#39;t afford a move again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you decided you&#39;d give him a reason to stay in Moon Lake?&quot; Frances asked, figuring that this had to have happened some time after Samantha&#39;s first official meeting with the Anderson family but before Yvette had jumped William in the college parking lot, though Frances couldn&#39;t hazard a specific guess on what day that was.<br />
<br />
&quot;It didn&#39;t sound like they were all lovey-dovey together,&quot; Yvette said weakly, &quot;and when I went about a bit of spying through the windows I could see that I was better looking than Martha... and figured I could give him someone to love and someone that would love him back. I mean... people don&#39;t ague with their true loves... do they?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances didn&#39;t know how to answer that. Arguments could be a sign of problems in a marriage, but they weren&#39;t necessarily a sign that love wasn&#39;t there. She had even had her fair share of arguments with Samantha from time to time, but they had generally been small and usually over small things that they worked through quickly. It seemed to make Frances further think that Yvette&#39;s upbringing had helped give her a poor understanding of love and family life. Her mother had been left alone and was never really there, and her only potential father figure might not only be her father but her biological uncle as well... and he wasn&#39;t even there all the time. It only fueled what could have started as teenage rebellion into a series of poor choices with little instruction on what was either the right thing to do or the best guidance on how to behave.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you the truth, Ms. Smith,&quot; Frances said carefully and formally, &quot;It can happen from time to time. An arguing couple can be a sign that the relationship is strained... but it doesn&#39;t mean that love is non-existent. In fact... couples that truly love each other generally manage to work through their disagreements... In that sense arguing doesn&#39;t mean that neither party loves the other. I would tend to think that Martha and William Anderson did and do love each other firmly... but were in a bit of a bad place when they came to Moon Lake. They were trying to recover from stresses on their marriage that were there before they moved and were in the process of working through that. It would seem to me that you only caught on that there was stress and misinterpreted what that meant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvette only looked down again and said weakly, &quot;I suppose it&#39;s too late to say I&#39;m sorry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With regard to how the Anderson family will see you... probably,&quot; Frances said slowly, &quot;but in a way it can&#39;t hurt. The real thing is going to be coming to a real decision on what you will do in the future and how you intend demonstrate that you are apologetic for your actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Yvette admitted, &quot;I&#39;ll accept that I&#39;d made real mistakes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances again watched as Yvette looked down and sighed heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to prove myself better than my mother,&quot; Yvette summarized, &quot;and that limited who I could date as a result of the things I did... and then...&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvette looked up the werecat in the room with her with a sad frown and a look of realization on her face that Frances did notice. She didn&#39;t say anything for the moment and only listened to what Yvette said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I then in that desire... decided to force the issue,&quot; Yvette said slowly and weakly, &quot;I forced myself on someone to try and make him love me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And clawing Jennifer Harper?&quot; Frances asked, if only to confirm what Yvette had said to earlier in an earlier visit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Purely to get a distraction,&quot; Yvette answered, &quot;I wanted William... I wanted to MAKE him love me... and wasn&#39;t about to let anything get in my way. If I could get the police to stop chasing me... I was willing to do that. Jennifer Harper seemed like a good enough distraction at the time... Especially when she seemed to be getting everything I wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Frances said slowly and checked her watch again, by now they were approaching the time that was scheduled for the visit with Yvette. She actually felt quite successful in that she had a lot to put together a psychological picture on Yvette&#39;s make up. It was born in how she had been raised or rather how she had been ignored by her mother and from there, things spiraled out of real control. It wasn&#39;t necessarily a real sign of clinical insanity, but a sign of a mistaken ideas and a lack of real parenting skills. It made her figure that had Yvette&#39;s mother done more to be there for her daughter that many of the mistakes that Yvette had made might have been avoided.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything else you want?&quot; Yvette asked as she noticed Frances looking to her watch.<br />
<br />
Frances looked up and gave a soft smile to Yvette. There was more that she would want to know and figure out. This was where her revelation that completing Jenny&#39;s transformation had made her a lesbian or at least bisexual came into the picture. It was such a rapid change that it was hard to really explain truthfully. It was a sign of flighty thought, which could be at least partially explained by the medical tests that had been run on Yvette&#39;s system, but the numbers weren&#39;t quite enough to be completely certain on that. In that she would need to find out if there were any other times in which Yvette had made decisions that were similarly flighty in nature. However, they were beginning to run out of time for the day and wouldn&#39;t be able to talk more about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will... but I think we&#39;ve used up all the time that we have for today,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;will you need anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Freedom, obviously,&quot; Yvette answered, &quot;but I suppose I won&#39;t be getting that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for awhile,&quot; Frances answered.<br />
<br />
Yvette nodded and then sighed, &quot;I don&#39;t think I need anything at the moment... and the hospital staff has been helpful and haven&#39;t outright attacked me or anything...&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances nodded, &quot;Okay then. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow for your next session.&quot;<br />
<br />
While there was technically still some time, Frances had knew there wasn&#39;t enough time to move onto the next part of Yvette&#39;s evaluation. With a last nod to Yvette, Frances placed her notes in a folder and placed it under her arm, picked up her purse, and left the room.</p>
