<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Barry barely concealed a smirk.  &quot;Hey Sash, I know I said I&#39;d stop giving you hints, you can see the cards I play on you by holding your hand up like this?&quot;  He held his hand in a pausing motion, with his palm facing his newly-female opponent.  &quot;It&#39;s useful for playing Instant effects in response to your opponent.  Here, let me show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barry slowly raised his hand above his head as before, and Sash quickly raised his hand as Barry had said.  There was a flash and Sash flinched, but then noticed a new card floating in front of him.<br />
<br />
THE MILK MAIDEN<br />
Choose one of these effects:<br />
1. Grow an udder and fill all mammaries to full capacity.  <br />
2. Become Anthro cow.  <br />
3. Double your size and capacity for all current and future mammaries.  <br />
If the target is currently female, choose a second effect.  If the target also was male during this match, choose all three effects.  <br />
Target: Sash<br />
<br />
Sash noticed that last line, and quickly realized he&#39;d be getting all three if it went through!  &quot;Barry, now wait a s-!&quot;  However, his train of thought was interrupted as the card disappeared, and his body began to shift.<br />
<br />
First, his breasts began to bulge with newfound growth.  There was an uncomfortable pulse as new flesh bubbled forth, forcing the fine dress to stretch to meet the new demand for space.  The sudden shift in weight caused Sash to topple forward, but he caught the ground before landing on his newly-enlarged chest.<br />
<br />
His shoes started to strain, painfully so.  Sash felt the high heels he was wearing tear away as his elongated foot continues to grow, his blackened toes curling into themselves and forming a hoof.  A nauseating sensation traveled from his feet, slowly climbing up his body.  Sash twisted to look, and realized that small white hairs were rapidly growing in the wake of this strange feeling.  It rapidly thickened into fur as the bones of his legs subtly shifted into an alien proportion.<br />
<br />
As it traveled past the hem of his dress, he felt it travel over his rear, then focus within the base of his spine.  An unknown force pulled harshly on his rear, until it started to give way.  A tube of flesh and bone crawled out from the hem, which also rapidly gained a whitened pattern similar to his legs.  A brown tuft sprouted from its end as the tail reached nearly two feet in length.  The fur continued to crawl up his body, his breasts growing more pale as soft, fine hairs covered them.  As it moved down his arms, his fingers began to contort as well, growing a similar black as his feet, his fingers melding together until two thick digits and a thumb.<br />
<br />
However, Sash was not prepared for what happened when the tingling reached his neck and face.  Bones began to crunch within his face as it pulled outward into a small snout.  His ears lengthened, flopping onto the sides of his head as horns pushed from the sides of his forehead.  <br />
<br />
As the tingling started to dissipate, Sash tried to get back to his feet, only to double over once more.  His stomach fell out from under him, straining his dress until it touched the floor, making him look heavily pregnant.  Soon, four noticeable lumps started to show through the dress, presumably the teats of his udder.  As one final injustice, both his breasts and gut-mounted mass began to press outward even further.  It felt as though someone took a hose and was filling it with what Sash assumed was milk.  His clothes began to tear as they tried to hold back his assets, which now felt painful between their confinement and the internal pressure.<br />
<br />
His chest and gut were unimaginably heavy compared to before, causing his arms to briefly give out.  However, this caused him to hold his body up using only his tits, making the pain increase tenfold.  After a short yelp, Sash heaved himself onto his hooves, practically over-correcting until he used a nearby table to steady himself.  &quot;What the hell, Barry?!&quot;  His clothes reshuffled once more, the threads <br />
<br />
Barry was laughing the entire time.  &quot;Man, I love newbies.  Always so dramatic the first few times.  We&#39;ve got at least 40 transformations in this match, and only one person is going to keep one card permanently.  Besides, my kind of deck isn&#39;t that unusual.  It&#39;s just a control deck.  I control what you add or make you too big to compete, then I win.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sash gave a heavy sigh.  &quot;This game seems stupid so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about it.  You&#39;ll grow to love it.  If you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll tell ya how to undo transformations after you lose.  By the way, your turn!&quot;</p>
