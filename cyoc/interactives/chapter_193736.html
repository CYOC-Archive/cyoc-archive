<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Natalia laughed softly, flashing a smile to Reiko as she refilled her drink. The purpose of this get together for the vampires was simple, gather information.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Hannibals familiar the vampires had learned of the extensive connections the wizards had. What was more important was learning about the children. <br />
<br />
Natalia had already seen first hand the power Yuriko had but, she needed to know about the others. From estimates the vampires had been able to discern their were around 7 or 8 children most under the age of 3. If the vampires could capture these children, turn them or use them to strengthen the vampire nation it would make them perhaps the most powerful of all the supernatural families.<br />
<br />
The idea of accompanying Reiko to this event was simple. The party consisted of women. Mothers, grandmother&#39;s, aunts, all of which would be quite willing to show off their adorable family members after a few drinks. With luck Natalia would be able to not only get pictures of the children but learn where they were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having fun Natalia?&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalia turned, giving Reiko a warm smile. &quot;Yes Reiko I am,&quot; she grinned. &quot;Thank you so much for inviting me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well after that incident at my house I wanted to make it up to you,&quot; Reiko replied meekly. Natalia now laughed softly assuring Reiko that it was alright. While her memories were fuzzy about what had happened, she clearly remembered regressing into a 13 year old girl. After returning to normal, Reiko had apologized before asking Natalia to keep the secret of magic. Natalia, in order to maintain her cover, promised to say nothing. At least to anyone human.<br />
<br />
Now, after winning Reikos trust, Natalia had positioned herself in a way that she was privy to the movements of the wizards. Movements she was only to eager to share with Lord Miro.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its quite alright Reiko afterall they are still just children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Children with power I can&#39;t even begin to fathom,&quot;  Reiko whispered. &quot;Still, it was kinda fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you certainly were adorable in your youth,&quot; Natalia grinned, causing Reiko to bluah and giggle nervously. Natalia certainly still knew how to charm Reiko, as she was about to flirt with the woman once more she shivered. &quot;Reiko did you feel that,&quot; she asked. Turning to Reiko the vampires eyes went wide in shock. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no not again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Reiko looked like she was in her 30s again, the small amount of grey in her hair now completely black. Natalia now noticed the fine lines vanish completely, leaving the woman with smooth youthful skin. Quickly glancing around, Natalia noticed it wasn&#39;t just Reiko that was growing younger, everyone at the party was as well.<br />
<br />
Nina Moreland, (Natalia had recognized the hunters wife almost immediately), looked close to 30 now. The womans sandy brown hair looking much healthier, her skin appearing flawless, while her body appeared quite fit. Natalia had heard that the woman had been a hunter before she had children and was now seeing how she looked at that time. &quot;Damn last thing I need is her figuring out what I am,&quot; she thought in alarm.<br />
<br />
Excuaing herself from Reiko for a moment, Natalia now made her way into a side room to inspect herself. Much to her chagrin it appeared she wasn&#39;t immune to what was happening. Natalias body appeared leaner, her breasts firmer, while her face appeared younger as well. Unlike the others though it appeared Natalia still possessed her mental faculties. &quot;At least for now,&quot; she grumbled.  Watching the paft it appeared none of the guests were aware of what was happening. Everyone now tried to adjust ill fitting clothing as they raced backwards in age, completely oblivious to the fact the entire party was now populated by 20 somethings.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to figure out whose causing this,&quot; Natalia thought. &quot;And quickly. Who knows how long before my mind is affected too.&quot; <br />
<br />
Natalia now began to search quietly, trying to stay out of sight. The rapidly regressing vampire reasoned that whoever was doing this was safely out of sight. As Natalia went from her late 20s to her early 20s she was beginning to grow anxious. Everyone was getting younger too quickly with no sign of stopping. As she was about to place a call for help, she paused as she saw a woman who looked around 30 and a toddler.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lynne,&quot; Ann said quickly. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t use your magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why,&quot; Lynne asked innocently.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think everyone will have fun being little,&quot; Ann stated. Lynne giggled, shaking her head as she now smiled up at her aunt. &quot;You silly Annie,&quot; the toddler smiled. &quot;Eveyone likes being little. You little all da time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap,&quot; Ann thought. &quot;I can&#39;t believe a freaking toddler just pointed out how much I change my age. Beaten in a debate by a girl in diapers, Ann you really need to evaluate your life.&quot; As she turned to respond, she was surprised to see Lynne had run off to hide. Chances were Ann wouldn&#39;t be able to find the girl before the changes were complete. Taking out her cellphone, she now quickly called her niece Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pick up pick up pick up,&quot; Ann whispered frantically. Ann now cursed as she went straight to voice-mail. Who knows how long before Katie checked her phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie its Ann,&quot; she said quickly. &quot;Lynne snuck into your moms party. Right now this place looks like a college mixer but it&#39;s quickly heading for high school. Please come quickly.&quot; Hanging up her cellphone, she now sighed as she studied herself carefully.<br />
<br />
Pulling out a small mirror from her purse, she winced. She looked about 30 instead of her usual 45. Ann&#39;s face was young, flawless while her body appeared lean. Even Ann&#39;s modest breasts appeared just a bit perkier. &quot;Great,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Looks like I&#39;m not exempt from this either. At least I still have my mind intact.&quot; <br />
<br />
Looking out towards the party goers, Ann could tell that they were certainly acting more youthful. Instead of a room of adults talking over drinks, the women were acting like a group of hard partying coeds, slamming down shots and dancing. As Ann now sent a text message to Gloria and Ann she couldn&#39;t help but nervously watch, wondering just how young they were going to be when this finished.</p>
