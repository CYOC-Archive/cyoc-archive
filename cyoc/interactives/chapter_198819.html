<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the case of a newbie being someone’s date to this vacation, the newbie was allowed to pick their gifts simultaneously with their partner and make a double entrance with their partner to quell their nervousness. Drew opted for this, asking Arthur to escort him.<br />
<br />
Arthur picked a yellow box since they were more often than not at least men. Drew picked a pink box because there were so many left and he thought it seemed rude that people were ignoring that pile. Opening the boxes, both college boys found a pair of large tighty whities.<br />
<br />
“I guess we both got men, at least by the looks of it. I forgot to warn you not to pick pink but I guess a few of the pink were bound to be men anyway,” said Arthur, putting on the underwear that were one size too big.<br />
<br />
The two men had to hold up their briefs until they touched the stone and became the bodies which properly fit them. Arthur had gotten his pervy uncle Frank’s body. He had to admit, aesthetically this was a pleasing body. Lots of body hair and muscle, and good bit of chub, which just made the muscle stand out more somehow.<br />
<br />
To Arthur’s surprise and intrigue, Drew touched the stone and became Arthur’s dad, Jace. He probably would’ve gotten hard right away in his uncle’s body, but he was a bit nervous about the runway show they would have to do in a moment. <br />
<br />
“And next it seems that next we have Arthur in his uncle Frank’s body with his lover being in none other than his own dad Jace’s body! Folks, this a once in a lifetime swap! Never before has a couple switched into the bodies of biological brothers!” Said this year’s announcer, who was way too excited about this admittedly kinky turn of events.<br />
<br />
Arthur and Drew strutted their stuff down the runway in their tighty whities holding hands. Uncle Frank was watching from the body of somebody’s 60 year old female date he had been swapped into. He looked mortified, but as the one with the biggest reputation for doing perverted things in the bodies he’s swapped into, he had no place to be upset. When Arthur and Drew got to the end of the runway, Arthur bent his new body over and put a hand over his mouth. Drew took his boyfriend’s hips and started fake fucking him for a few pumps. Arthur tried not to think too much about how good his dad/boyfriend/brother’s cock bulge felt against his new ass. Arthur then got up, kissed Drew in front of the audience and they turned around, holding hands again and walking the runway back. Drew was surprised at how confident he felt in Jace’s body, but he knew he was an absolute dilf in this body and that was a serious confidence boost. The body that his boyfriend had gotten swapped into had him pretty hyped too. He found himself wanting to look under Arthur’s briefs.<br />
<br />
“There you have it folks, some brotherly love to stiffen up your evening,” the announcer said, winking to the horned up audience.<br />
<br />
It was all in good fun but both young men were getting a bit erect in their new forty year old bodies. They ironically had great sexual chemistry in these bodies of brothers. Everybody was cheering...except for uncle Frank of course. He was all for perving out in different body, but he only liked women and he hated seeing his body acting so gay, especially in unison with his own older brother Jace’s body. He shuddered at the fact that only a couple of layers of cotton separated his big brother’s penis from his former asshole when they were fake fucking.<br />
<br />
The night went on and Arthur and Drew hardly noticed anybody else’s swaps. They were basking in the good luck of both getting attractive male bodies. Arthur initiated some foot play under the table. His boyfriend had his dad’s body and therefore his feet. He’d never thought about playing footsie with his actual dad, but it felt great! Drew played back, clearly down to explore these bodies more in private.<br />
<br />
An oldish woman came up to Drew and Arthur’s table. Arthur recognized her as the body that his uncle Frank had been swapped into.<br />
<br />
“Listen you little punk,” said the lady to Arthur, “I don’t care if you are in college, do anything more sexual with your boyfriend while you’re in my body and I’ll have your dad ground you till the next millennium!”<br />
<br />
“Ah uncle Frank, it is you. What’s a matter? Don’t like the shoe being on the other foot?” Asked Arthur, putting a hand into his new briefs and fondling his uncle’s cock right in front of him.<br />
<br />
“You little pervert!” Frank almost shouted with his old lady voice.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m the pervert? Wanna tell my boyfriend Drew here what happened on the runway last year when you swapped into my cousin Emily’s body? You know, the one who was barely 18 when you swapped with her?” Asked Arthur.<br />
<br />
Frank was dumbfounded, so Arthur continued, “You fingered yourself to completion in front of the audience under your panties. So forgive me if I feel entitled to do whatever brings me joy while I’m in your body. Including being with my hot boyfriend.” Arthur leaned over and made out with Drew, feeling his dad’s tongue for the first time.<br />
<br />
Frank walked away in a huff.</p>
