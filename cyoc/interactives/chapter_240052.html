<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the trio of college friends enjoyed their meal, each bite carried the remnants of Jeff deeper into their digestive systems. The manburgers, still warm and tender from the grill, were chewed thoroughly by each bovine, breaking down the soft, juicy patties into smaller pieces before they swallowed, sending the fragments down their throats and into their stomachs.<br />
<br />
Inside their stomachs, the acidic environment immediately began to work on the manburger pieces, churning and mixing them with digestive enzymes. These acids and enzymes broke down the patties even further, turning them into a thick, nutrient-rich paste that seeped deeper into their bodies. Tiny fragments of Jeff, proteins, fats, and various minerals, were absorbed into the lining of each bovine stomach, where they traveled into their bloodstream, fueling their bodies with energy and strengthening their muscles.<br />
<br />
In the stomach of the black bull, who’d ordered a double, Jeff’s nutrients were quickly processed, giving him a surge of energy. His body, strong and athletic, absorbed each molecule, sending it to fuel his limbs, brain, and heart. The black bull, who enjoyed weightlifting in his spare time, relished the sense of fullness and strength he felt after his meal. Little did he know that some part of Jeff now resided within his biceps, fueling the very workouts he performed.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, inside the white cow’s stomach, Jeff’s nutrients were also being absorbed. Unlike her friends, she had only ordered a single manburger, but it was enough to satisfy her hunger. Her body eagerly took in each particle, the protein aiding in muscle repair, while the fats gave her skin a healthy sheen. She leaned back, content, feeling the pleasant fullness settle in her stomach as her body used Jeff’s remnants to replenish her energy reserves, preparing her for an evening of socializing with friends.<br />
<br />
For the brown bull, Jeff’s nutrients did something different. Known for his love of running, he felt a boost of energy as the calories and proteins were distributed throughout his muscular legs, preparing them for tomorrow’s early-morning jog. Every morsel of Jeff, broken down in his gut, was transformed into pure fuel, strengthening his body and giving him endurance.<br />
<br />
Within hours, the nutrients from Jeff’s former self were fully assimilated into the bodies of the three young bovines. Once a young man with hopes and dreams, Jeff had now become an indistinguishable part of these three friends, scattered through their muscles, skin, and bones, supporting their lives in ways he would never know.<br />
<br />
The black bull was the first to feel the inevitable call of nature. After finishing his manburger meal earlier, he had returned to his dorm, sprawled out on his bed, scrolling absentmindedly through social media while listening to music. As the evening wore on, a subtle pressure began to form low in his abdomen, growing steadily more insistent. At first, he ignored it, shifting slightly in his position to ease the discomfort, but the sensation soon demanded his full attention. With a sigh, he set his phone down on the nightstand and rose to his feet, heading toward the small attached bathroom.<br />
<br />
Stepping inside, he flicked on the light and closed the door behind him. The tiled floor was cool beneath his hooves as he adjusted his pants, lowering them and settling onto the toilet seat. He leaned forward slightly, resting his elbows on his knees, and allowed his body to do the rest. His digestive system, having worked efficiently over the past few hours, was now ready to discard the remnants of his manburger meal.<br />
<br />
The process began slowly, his body pushing out the waste with steady effort. The sound of it hitting the water below was accompanied by the faint odor of digestion, an unmistakable reminder of the meal he had so thoroughly enjoyed. With each contraction of his abdomen, more of the remnants of Jeff were expelled, reduced to nothing more than biological waste. The black bull’s muscular frame relaxed as the pressure in his stomach subsided, leaving him feeling lighter and more comfortable.<br />
<br />
When he was finished, he reached for the roll of toilet paper, cleaning himself before pulling up his jeans and flushing the toilet. The swirling water carried away what little remained of Jeff, erasing his existence entirely. The bull washed his hands at the sink, running the water over his dark fur before drying off and returning to his room. Lying back on his bed, he felt refreshed and ready to relax for the rest of the evening.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in her own dorm room across campus, the white cow was seated at her desk, diligently working through an assignment for her biology class. The soft glow of her desk lamp illuminated the page as she scribbled notes, her curly white hair tied back in a loose bun. As she leaned back to stretch her arms above her head, she felt a dull ache in her abdomen. At first, she ignored it, choosing to focus on her studies, but as the minutes passed, the sensation grew stronger, signaling that her body was ready to release the waste from her earlier meal.<br />
<br />
Setting her pen down, she pushed back her chair and stood, her hooves clopping softly against the floor as she made her way to the bathroom. She closed the door behind her, pulling down her baggy jeans before sitting on the toilet. With her hands resting on her thighs, she took a deep breath and let her body take over.<br />
<br />
The white cow felt the muscles in her abdomen contract, the waste sliding out of her effortlessly. Her body had extracted every bit of nutrient it needed from the manburger, and what remained was now being discarded. The soft plopping sounds in the water below were rhythmic, accompanied by a slight sense of relief as the pressure in her stomach eased. She couldn’t help but let out a small sigh of satisfaction as the process came to an end.<br />
<br />
Reaching for a few sheets of toilet paper, she cleaned herself thoroughly before standing and flushing the toilet. The remnants of Jeff swirled down into the pipes, soon to be forgotten entirely. Washing her hands at the sink, she glanced at herself in the mirror, adjusting her hair before returning to her desk. Feeling lighter and more focused, she resumed her work, her mind already moving on to the next task.<br />
<br />
The brown bull was the last of the trio to experience the effects of his meal. An early riser, he had just returned from his morning jog, his body glistening with sweat as he stepped into his dorm bathroom for a quick shower. The run had left him energized, but as he dried off with a towel, he felt a familiar pressure building in his gut. Tossing the towel onto a hook, he stepped over to the toilet and sat down, his damp fur cool against the seat.<br />
<br />
He relaxed his muscular frame, leaning back slightly as the process began. His body, efficient and strong, expelled the waste with ease. The remains of Jeff, now broken down into unusable material, left his body in steady intervals, the sounds echoing softly in the small bathroom. The brown bull stared idly at the tiled wall, his mind drifting to his schedule for the day, giving little thought to what his body was discarding.<br />
<br />
When he finished, he grabbed some toilet paper and cleaned up before standing and flushing. The remnants of Jeff disappeared into the plumbing, leaving the brown bull feeling refreshed and ready for his post-jog breakfast. After a quick rinse of his hands, he left the bathroom and began preparing for the day ahead, completely unaware of the significant role his meal had once played in reshaping the world he now inhabited.</p>
