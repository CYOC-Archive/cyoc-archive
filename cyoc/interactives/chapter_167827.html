<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vincent followed Carter into the locker room. Vincent still felt oddly pumped from the work out. It felt great! His muscles in his chest and biceps and shoulders were sore, but in a good way. The veins stood out and, wait, were his muscles a bit bigger? Nah, it was probably just a trick of the light. It was a great feeling; totally different than the lame cardio he was used to doing. Maybe he would lift with Carter more often! He took another big swig of the water bottle. He noticed the water tasted funny, but didn’t think too much of it; he was too thirsty to care!<br />
<br />
As he entered the locker room, he was hit with a humid stench of sweaty men and BO. Vincent coughed and sputtered; it stunk! Carter saw his reaction and laughed, slapping the scrawny nerd on his back. Carter took a deep sniff and laughed; “Smell that? That&#39;s the smell of men! Men who work hard and train hard for football! Don’t worry, you&#39;ll get used to it, bro. In fact, if you keep working out with me for a bit, maybe you’ll be stinking up the place soon enough like me hehehe”, Carter said. He theatrically lifted his arm showing off his hairy pits and took a deep sniff. “Woooo! Yup , I sure do stink!”. Carter saw Vincent giving him a look of minor disgust. Carter grinned and wrapped his big muscled arm around Vincent. Vincent could feel tons of Carter’s sweat rub off on him and Carter’s pit hairs tickled his shoulder. Gross! “Come on bro, you better get used to it if you want to play football! Guys stink and sweat and smell! That’s all there is to it bro, nothing you can do about it!”.<br />
<br />
Vincent grimaced; he liked the idea of working out but was grossed out by all these funky smells. He could smell Carter from here and it wasn’t pleasant at all. Carter had said that soon enough he would be smell like he did! He was doubtful he would every become one of those stinky hulking football jocks who always had a funky BO musk cloud over them. For one thing, Vincent was very diligent about hygiene and showering! He lifted up his arm and took a sniff just in case; nope, it didn’t smell too bad, but it did smell a bit off. Hmm, he would make sure to use extra soap. He also noticed something else. Did he always have that much hair in his armpits? He only had a few wispy hairs before, but it looked like there was more hair or they were thicker? He shrugged and put his arm down.<br />
<br />
They got to an empty locker room bench and Carter began to unceremoniously strip out of his sweaty workout gear. His tank top made an audible SPLAT as it hit the dirty floor, showing off his muscular torso that was covered in thick curly brown hair. Carter stripped out of his shorts just as fast, leaving only his jockstrap! Vincent saw, with a tinge of disgust, the jockstrap was old and yellowed with sweat. It had holes from being stretched by Carter’s obviously large package, and from overuse. Pubes stuck out from the holes. It all seemed just pretty nasty! Carter smirked as he saw Vincent staring; “Come on, Vince Bro, are you gonna shower or what. Football bros are always naked in the locker room, it’s not a big deal!”.<br />
<br />
With that, Carter took the jock off and his long thick cock and balls flopped down into sight. Vincent gulped; he had to be 8 or 9 inches, soft! With huge balls to match! He had a huge bush of hair all over his crotch too, which made sense. Carter was a hairy dude, with lots of hair on his stomach, chest, pits, and arms. Looking at Carter, Vincent felt a strange twinge in his crotch. Was he getting turned on? No, no way! He was 100% straight, and had never had a sexual thought about a guy ever before! Carter walked off into the steamy shower room as Vincent shook his head to clear these strange feelings away. He looked down, not sure if he was ready to strip in front of his friend. Vincent knew his dick was pretty tiny, and he was especially self conscious after he had seen Carter’s python. He was gross and sweaty, though, so he knew he had to shower. He took a deep breath and stripped off the old clothes, letting his tiny cock into full view. Flaccid, It was maybe an inch or two, and he only had a few wispy brown pubes above it. He covered himself up with a cupped hand and walked into the shower!</p>
