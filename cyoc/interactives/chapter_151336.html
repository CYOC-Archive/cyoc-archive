<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She dived her hand in the bag and took of a Ken doll, dressed like a prince. She posed him, unanimated, in front of the dolls.<br />
<br />
“Let me use my magic to make it alive!”<br />
<br />
She ran out of the room laughing. Jeff was petrified and was staring the man in front of him while the Barbies around him where over excited. Soon, the Ken dolled started moving, stretching, as the dolls cheered. Sarah came back to her room.<br />
<br />
“I know you sent me no prayers, but your friends did for you.”<br />
<br />
She smirked as Jeff looked at Betty and Marry who were clapping.<br />
<br />
“You seemed to be wondering if there was a Prince among you. I have no doubt that you wanted to fully hold your princess role, so I filled this dream for you… I present you James, your new Prince and lover ! James, here is Lily, your sweet princess !”<br />
<br />
The Ken dolled moved forward and took Jeff by the hips, holding him closely as he was saying how beautiful his princess was and how he loved her.<br />
<br />
“Go on sweetie” the Barbies voices said “Don’t be shy and show your love to this handsome prince”<br />
<br />
Jeff was exploding inside. How could she had done this to him ? He was about to punch the Prince and run to his sister in order to fight for his honor, and had already raised the arms to strangle the doll in front of him, but as he was seized by the new comer, he realized how short and thin he was compared to him. A fight now would do nothing good, and Sarah was still here, with the Chronivac not far. He calmed himself and unwillingly passed his arms around the Ken’s neck like a girl would with her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“I love you too, my prince” he replied, and all barbies around clapped.<br />
<br />
Sarah guessed from the clapping that his brother had surrendered to his new lover, and stood up, towering the whole gang of dolls.<br />
<br />
“Now that you were blessed with my gifts, enjoy them and be prepared to be played with !”<br />
<br />
The Barbies bowed, and the prince did too. As he was holding Jeff closely, one hand on the hip and the other holding his hand, the reluctant princess was forced to show her sister her neck as well. The giant girl seemed satisfied and picked up Jeff and his new partner, moving them next to the castle.<br />
<br />
“The prince and his princess should be next to the Castle, it’s their home and natural place. Now Prince you are allowed to treat your girl like the princess she is  while I look after the others.”<br />
<br />
She went back to the front of the dollhouse and started playing with the remaining Barbies, leaving her brother alone in the corner with the Prince.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked around, hoping something would happen and end his misery, turn him back to normal or at least free him from this new and unwanted boyfriend. He had tried until now to play the princess role, but he didn’t expected to see a Prince enter the equation. <br />
<br />
“Are you all right my love ?” asked a voice behind him<br />
<br />
He turned back to the Ken doll who was getting closer. As he was taking his hips again and hold him closer,  Jeff noticed a small bulge at the doll’s crotch. Not very big, but sill bigger than the common Ken. As the Prince started “kissing” his princess’s neck, she strangely felt aroused. The transformed boy felt a doubt. An awful doubt. Pushing away his lover, Jeff felt his own crotch under his gown, and knew immediately there was something. Not something missing this time. Something new. The truth hit him like a ice bucket : when she was giving life to the prince, she also had altered him… and given him a doll pussy.<br />
<br />
Jeff panicked and run as fast as he could with his heels and gown while the Prince seemed lost about his princess’s reaction, unable to catch her in time. He suddenly heard heavy paces then was seized and hold in the air by a giant hand. He had forgotten Sarah. She had caught him… and didn’t seemed pleased.<br />
<br />
Jeff was hold tightly by his sister, but didn’t tried to fight back. He was way too afraid by what she could do to him. she had turned him into a doll, then given him a pussy. What was about to happen now ?<br />
<br />
“What did I told you about running away, Lily ?”<br />
<br />
She seemed really angry, and Jeff looked down, not wanting to meet her eyes. She carried him out of the room, and back to the office, his old bedroom, where the PC was turned on. She opened the Chronivac, and selected Jeff’s file.<br />
<br />
“What should be your punition ? what should I do with you now ?”</p>
<hr/><h3>What do you do now?</h3>
