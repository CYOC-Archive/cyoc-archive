<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well Kelly where do you suggest I start on this intriguing idea you have given to me” said Jacob as he stood up from the now filled and resting Brightmane.<br />
<br />
“I think it would be best if we fixed this place up first before I brought anybody here” answered Kelly as she gestured around to the dusty barn they were all currently in. Jacob agreed with the suggestion and wished that the barn would change to match what Kelly thought it should look like. This was the greatest change that the ring had been wished to bring about so it wasn’t as instantaneous as the rest of the wishes. Jacob and his harem got to watch as the barn around them morphed from a neglected old horse stable to well crafted and pristine grand hall. The whole building had expanded to include multiple separate bedrooms, a communal bathing complex, and kitchen. The main room of the barn had changed from a collection of horse stalls and hay bails, to a throne room equipped with its own well padded throne for Jacob to sit in.<br />
<br />
Jacob walked up to the throne and sat in it while Kelly and Mrs. Perth looked around at their changed surroundings. Brightmane had been moved with the change and was now resting on a couch that was to the side of the throne. Frankie would have still been with her by the couch had he not abandoned the toy that he had been impaled upon and rushed to the throne right after the change had completed. He was now kneeling between Jacob’s legs rubbing his petite body against the huge horse ball sack the hung over the front of the throne.<br />
<br />
“Oh master your balls are still so big even after filling all of your mare. I could never have competed with these magnificent orbs, these cum factories, theses belly stuffers, these femboy fillers” said Frankie as he kissed, fondled, and drooled over the massive testicles. His efforts were rewarded as the flat head of Jacob’s horse cock that had retreated into its sheath after finishing with Brightmane reappeared. <br />
<br />
“Now you’ve done it Frankie, I had thought about returning some of your manhood to you so that you could assist me with all the new girls Kelly will be bringing here but now I see that my initial choice was right. You will remain forever as my most devoted cocksleeve” said Jacob as his shaft fully emerged from his sheath marking his full erection.<br />
<br />
“Yippee” exclaimed Frankie before climbing onto the throne with Jacob and planting himself back atop the cock he had been shaped for.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, dad why do you have to be such a slut” said Kelly as she marveled at how comfortable Frankie looked completely stretched around Jacob’s cock<br />
<br />
“I am not a slut I am a sleeve. Master will take care of my family so I must take care of his cock” said Frankie sitting proudly as if he were on his own throne and not in the lap of a larger man with the clear shape of a horse cock bulging through his skin. <br />
<br />
Hearing this Jacob felt his own surge of devotion towards the petite Frankie and swore to himself that he would never let any harm come towards his now self identified cocksleeve. <br />
<br />
After placing a hand on Frankie’s thigh Jacob spoke saying “Now Kelly there is no need to insult Frankie for doing what makes him happy. I would hope that you all find happiness within my harem”. Jacob even went so far as to lean down to kiss the beaming Frankie who was elated to be defended by his master. There was some hesitation at first from Frankie but he surrendered to the kiss and the former horse and former master now made out as master and cocksleeve. <br />
<br />
“What was the matter Frankie you seemed tense at first” asked Jacob.<br />
<br />
“Well it is a little strange kissing my old face” said Frankie blushing from embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“Yeah it’s kind of weird you’re still wearing dad’s old face and his body. You should make yourself into something special” said Kelly <br />
<br />
“I agree, while I still love you Frankie. the Frank I married is gone and Jacob needs a body deserving of that cock” added Mrs Perth standing next to her daughter.<br />
<br />
“You’re right, you’re right. This body will no longer due for me. Let me think on my new form” said Jacob quieting the members of his harem. <br />
<br />
Jacob didn’t want to return to his old body as a horse but the stature of a human wouldn’t due either. The thought of becoming a centaur crossed his mind as it was a mix of both man and horse but the unwieldy nature of that body turned Jacob off from it. Another form came to mind, one that was a better mix of the two and would suit his purpose. With a wish for his body to change to the one he was imagining for himself, Jacob’s body began to change and expanded. <br />
<br />
Frankie who still sat on Jacob’s lap warming his cock yelped as the change began to occur underneath him. The first thing to happen was Jacob’s body began spreading a coat of short dark brown hair across his skin. The color was the same as it was as a horse and much like horses hair it laid sleek against the body. Before the coat could cover the whole body the expanding began. The previously 5 foot 11 Jacob grew to be nearly 8 feet tall. now towering over the tiny in comparison Frankie. As the coat of hair finished covering the body and began to spread to the face, Jacob’s head began to shift from that of a human’s to that of something more closely resembling that of a horse. It was not one that was truly of a horse as the eyes of it sat forward and muzzle only extended from the nose and mouth, but it was definitely recognizable as being horse-like. The transformation concluded with his feet changing to hooves and a back jointing added to his now strong and muscular legs.<br />
<br />
Frankie who had rode the lap of the transforming Jacob had leaned back and clung the chest of his master as he was unsure what changes would occur.<br />
<br />
“Oh forgive me my little one. I should have removed you before I began the change” said Jacob he leaned over and wrapped his now much larger hands around the cowering Frankie.<br />
<br />
“No don’t be sorry I would have wanted to stayed right here regardless of the change, but a little warning would have been enough.” Said Frankie as he held the hands that were now more than twice the size of his own.<br />
<br />
“I will keep that in mind” said Jacob in a seductive tone before leaning down further and giving Frankie another kiss. This one held no hesitation or timidity with the two passionately joining together. Once the kiss was done Jacob straightened and focused on the waiting Kelly and asked her “So what is next”.</p>
