<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I am done with men! Pigs! All of them! I swear!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Asian American woman took another swig of wine before she continued her drunken ramble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck David. I mean what an asshole! For real! And with Miriam of all people? Fuck that bitch and fuck David.&quot; Janet rattled on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Janet, you&#39;ll be alright.&quot; Victoria tried to console her. &quot;Who cares about him. You know you deserve much better than that guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janet and Victoria were two college students rooming together. They have been best friends since they first met in high school. Currently they were sitting on the couch of their tiny rented apartment.  Janet was drinking away her sorrows from her recent breakup and Victoria was doing her best to support her bestie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Victoria, you&#39;re a great *hic* friend!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww. That&#39;s so sweet. Janet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nono. Like Victoria, you&#39;re like so amazing and great and stuff. I love you.&quot; Janet slurred.  &quot;Like, I&#39;d rather much much more date you than all those stupid guys. Too bad I like dick. Like if you were a man. I&#39;d date you like so fucking hard. Imagine if you were born a man. So much fucking better. Like, I wish that, that you had been a man so I could have dated you instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-thanks, I guess.&quot; Victoria replied.<br />
<br />
With all of her rambling and Janet acting more drunk by the minute, Victoria figured Janet had had enough wine. She&#39;d have to make sure this would be Janet&#39;s last glass of the night.<br />
<br />
Janet babbled some more before Victoria managed to convince Janet it was time they should sleep. The two girls went into their separate beds in their shared bedroom. Janet quickly dozed off. Meanwhile, Victoria struggled a bit to fall asleep. She had an somewhat early lecture tomorrow that she didn&#39;t want to miss and here she was going to bed super late. Her original plan was to fall asleep many hours ago. She couldn&#39;t help but stress, delaying her sleep even further, but after some time, she also managed to also fall asleep.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Victoria was beginning to wake up . She shifted around in her half asleep half awake state. Her movements felt off. Weird. Why? It&#39;s not like she had been drinking that much. Why did she feel strange all across her body?<br />
<br />
Her alarm had yet to go off, but Victoria couldn&#39;t rest with all these strange sensations. She opened her eyes, and with her eyes open, there was suddenly a lot to take in. Immediately she spotted her chest. It was flat. Boobs were gone. All she had was flat hard pecs. Further down her body, between her legs, she felt something. Something that shouldn&#39;t be there. Victoria gulped. She pulled her blanket down, revealing her crotch area. Instead of panties, she was wearing boxer shorts, and there was something pressing against those shorts. There was no mistaking what that thing was. She reached towards it. Just a tiny touch. It was sensitive. A little too sensitive. Shivers went through her body. She quickly retracted her arm as if she had just touched a hot stove.<br />
<br />
Victoria jumped out of her bed, startled awake by her discovery. She almost fell over as she stood up, her center of gravity was way different. She spent some seconds getting balanced and then she noticed another thing. This was not her bed. Her bed was not a single-sized bed, but this one was double-sized. And she hadn&#39;t been in the bed alone. Janet was there on the other side of the bed. Luckily she was still fast asleep. For now. What if she were to wake up. Victoria dreaded having to deal with Janet like this. Would Janet even recognize her or believe her? She started to fret.<br />
<br />
Calm. Victoria figured she should be calm. She tried breathing deeply. In. Out. In. Out. It helped a little. She was slightly less stressed. But what should she do? Maybe the first thing was to see exactly how she had changed. That seemed like a good first step. A standing mirror was in their bedroom. Victoria turned around to face it. There was her new self. Her reflection showed a man. She was a man. Though, it did resemble her. It could have been her long lost brother. Was this how she&#39;d look if she was born a man? At least she wasn&#39;t bad looking. In fact she looked kind of cute or maybe handsome. She had worked out rigorously as a girl, and that appeared to have translated to a fit and muscular male body. She flexed her bicep. It was big. Much larger than her old one. She felt a little proud of herself. She had always been jealous of how much easier it was for men to gain muscle.  Though, when she spotted the image of her flexing male body in the mirror, she felt a little embarrassed. Here she was playing around. No time for that! This was a crisis.<br />
<br />
Victoria quickly paced around the room. Back and forth, back and forth, hoping she&#39;d have some sudden realization on how to fix her predicament.<br />
<br />
Victoria&#39;s train of thought was interrupted as she head a sound. Janet was moving. Was she waking up already? Victoria froze.</p>
