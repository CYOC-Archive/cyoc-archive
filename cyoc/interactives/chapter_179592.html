<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As your plane was landing at the Amsterdam international airport,  you thought back to what had brought you here with your girlfriend in the first place. <br />
<br />
Six years ago, back during your first year of collage, you had met Eliza by chance while studying in the library when you both went to check out the same book. The two of you connected over your shared interest in ancient history, but while you were at collage on a sports scholarship and were only studying it out of personal interest, she had plans to become a professional archaeologist. As you spent time hanging out your friendship blossomed into a full blown romance, with the two of you going steady halfway through your second year. Over time you realized that a career as a professional athlete didn&#39;t really appeal to you, so you began to take classes alongside Eliza so you could explore your interests alongside her. When the two of you graduated, you had agreed to be Eliza&#39;s research assistant. <br />
<br />
The two of you spent the next two years travelling around to various dig sites across the globe, and researching the various ancient peoples and cultures from before recorded history. One mystery that plagued researchers all across the world though, was what had become known as the “Myth Idols”. <br />
<br />
References to these idols had been found all across the world, and while the specifics of each one was slightly different the general idea remained the same. Each idol resembled a hermaphroditic animal/human hybrid of some sort and depictions of them seemed to indicate that they had the power to transform those that touched them into the creatures they resembled. The forms the idols were depicted with bore a basic resemblance to various mythological creatures, so people took to calling them the “Myth Idols” collectively. The strange thing was that depictions and legends of these idols were usually not from anywhere near the same location that the mythological creature that they were named after was. Most researchers agreed that even if the idols existed, any magical powers they held were most likely myths of their own. The only mysterious part was that while the artifacts many other myths were based off of had been found over the years, no one has found anything matching the descriptions of the myth idols in the areas they were supposed to be from.<br />
<br />
About a month ago, while you were taking a break from travelling the world, Eliza managed to find a lead on the possible location of one of the idols. One of her contacts had managed to interview an Alaskan native about their legends, which mention an idol that granted people the ability to fly like a bird, as well as warm feathers so they could endure the cold. The person mentioned that the bird-people lived on an island that towered above the sea that only those blessed with flight could reach. After doing a bit of digging the contact found an island off the coast that might have fit the description long ago, though most of it had been eroded to the point it was now only a few feet above sea level.<br />
<br />
The two of you jumped at the opportunity to find one of the mysterious idols and immediately began preparing for the trip. This could be a huge chance for the two of you, because while you both loved archaeology the amount of travelling you did put a lot of strain on your finances. This was one of the reasons the two of you hadn&#39;t gotten married yet, but finding the idol and selling it to a museum could remove any financial barriers standing in your way.<br />
<br />
So now You and Eliza were in Alaska, driving over two-hundred miles to the western coast in search of the harpy idol. Once you reached the coast you rented a boat and rode it, along with your equipment, over to the island Eliza&#39;s contact mentioned. Upon reaching the island, the two of you set up camp and went right into surveying.<br />
<br />
It was after two days of diligently surveying the island that you found the entrance to what appeared to be underground ruins. After another day of preparations you enter the ruins. The passage descends down beneath the ocean floor before opening into the ruins of an ancient temple. Traversing the ruins was difficult as their were basically no stairs or ladders, forcing you two methodically climb up and down with ropes and pitons. The ruins contained tons of pottery and inscriptions in various states of decay, but you and Eliza were focused on exploring before you started examining the artifacts in detail, though the prominent pictures of bird-human hybrids gave them confidence they were in the right place.<br />
<br />
After several hours of exploring, you arrived in a room that Eliza theorized to be an ancient temple. At the back off the room was an alter with an idol sitting atop it. The idol was carved in exquisite detail and depicted a woman with a pair of bird wings in place of arms, her feet were four toed talons, three facing forward and one backwards. Most of her body was covered in feathers the only exceptions being her face and her large breasts. The detail that made you completely sure this was the legendary harpy idol though, was the fact the idol had a large cock as well as a sizable ballsack between her avian legs.<br />
<br />
You looked over at Eliza, the excitement visible on both of your faces as you approached the idol. Eliza pulled out the foam-lined case she prepared to transport the idol and reached out to grab the idol before you stopped her.<br />
<br />
“Wait! Remember what the legends say about people who touch the idol?”<br />
<br />
“Come on Billy, magic isn&#39;t real. It&#39;s just a statue, albeit one with incredible historical value.” Your girlfriend scoffs.<br />
<br />
“Even so, we should still be careful with retrieving it, don&#39;t you think?” You plead<br />
<br />
Your girlfriend lets out a sigh before she...</p>
