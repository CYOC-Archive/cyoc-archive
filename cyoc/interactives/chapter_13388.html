<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark barely restrained his urge to claw the hell out of whoever had a hold of him.  He found himself looking up from his overturned perspective at Frank Reilly.  <br />
<br />
Frank stood 6'5&quot; tall and weighed a rock hard 270 pounds.  He was an all district defensive end on the football team.  But despite his fearsome presence, he was a very easygoing guy and nothing like the stereotype of a football player.  He knew that Mark took ballet and didn't particularly care one way or the other.  He'd come by the ballet school to pick up his younger sister one night and saw Mark talking to her, obviously making a pass at her.  Since then, he would make little jokes to Mark when he saw him at the mall or elsewhere but never told anyone else and never tried to intimidate Mark.<br />
<br />
Frank laughed at the sight of werewolf Mark.  &quot;What'd you do to yourself, Marky?  Is that stuff all over you?&quot; He asked, referring to the fur that he could feel at the ankle by which he effortlessly held Mark in the air.<br />
&quot;Yeah, it's sprayed all over me&quot;<br />
Frank turned Mark around in the air, inspecting him.<br />
&quot;What about your face?&quot;<br />
&quot;Come on.  I'm a werewolf.  I have to have a werewolf face to make the costume work, don't I?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, it's not really a costume is it?  It's more like makeup, in a way&quot;<br />
&quot;You could look at it that way, but, uh . . would you please put me down now?&quot;<br />
Frank shook his head.  &quot;Sorry, Marky.  But you're a freshman and my buddies and I are seniors.  So . . &quot;<br />
&quot;No I'm not&quot; shot back a worried Mark.  I'm not out of 8th grade for another 10 days and you're not seniors for another 10 days&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry, Marky.  It's starting now.  But don't worry.  The first kids who get their little asses paddled always get off pretty light.  It's the ones who finally get caught after a couple months who really get their buns busted&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark sighed and half nodded to Frank.  If it had been anyone else but Frank, Mark might have resisted but Frank was nearly guaranteeing that it wouldn't be too bad.  Even with his extra muscle, Frank easily carried Mark down the street, gathering Mark's other furry ankle into one hand and presenting Mark like a prize fish on the dock to the other seniors back at the pickup truck belonging to one of them.  <br />
<br />
The laughed at Mark's werewolf costume and its completeness, rubbing his fur coated shoulders and face, pushing a thumb or two against Mark's moist black nose and inspecting his long fangs.  Mark was a good sport about it and in response to a question about how the hell he came to look like that, made up a whole story of transformation.  He and Tony had seen an add in a movie magazine.  A guy who had done movie makeup was opening a shop in the city.  He was looking for volunteers to try out new materials and processes.  Mark said he'd had to strip and was sprayed from head to toe with some kind of new adhesive and then stepped into a special chamber where fur was applied to him by being sprayed at him through an air nozzle and kept in the correct orientation by a series of magnets outside the small cylindrical chamber.  Finally, his nose, teeth, ears and claws were done by the makeup specialist and his clothes were ripped to simulate the effects of transforming from human to werewolf before he put them on.<br />
<br />
The seniors all bought it and all complimented him, saying, to a man, that he looked like he really was a werewolf.  But then, they threw Mark into the back of the truck.  Frank and another guy almost as big sat on top of Mark squeezing the air out of his lungs and preventing escape.  They drove to the back of an abandoned stip mall, a nice secluded spot and dragged Mark just off the gate of the truck.  They were positioning him for his paddling when one of the ten seniors gave Mark a joking half punch in the lower back to move him into place.  Mark swiped at him with his clawed and missed him but ripped right through the waistband of both his pants and his shorts with his razor sharp claws.  Both his pants and his shorts dropped to the ground and the seniors fell all over themselves and him laughing at Mark having stripped himself.  Mark pushed and pulled trying to get free but though he was a lot stronger than any 135 pound boy should be, 270 pound Frank was a lot stronger still and held Mark in place from the truck bed in a sort of reversed full nelson.  All Mark succeeded in doing by struggling was to accidentally step out of his shredded shorts and pants.  He was left with just the remnants of his shirt and his converse all star low rise sneakers on his fur covered body.  Laughing seniors then wrestled his legs together and duct taped Mark's ankles so that he couldn't kick or run.  <br />
<br />
Than the paddling began.  While Frank held Mark in place and muttered encouragement like &quot;Just get through it Marky&quot;, the other seniors teed off on Mark's exposed, furry little ass, taking home run baseball cuts with a specially made paddle usually sold to college fraternities.  Each of the other seven seniors game Mark about 10 wallops across his buns, laughing all the while.  Some called out baseball situations &quot;Three-two count . . and the pitch! -WHACK- It's gone&quot;.  Others laughed all the while.  Still others became deadly serious about delivering the greatest possible force to the tight round, fur covered ass before them.  They gave Mark the best walloping that they could but though he yelped with almost every blow he absorbed, Mark really didn't feel that much pain.  Maybe it was the thick coating of carmel brown fur over his buns.  Maybe it was his new wolf hide.  Whatever it was, his ass was just a little sore at the end of it.  He wanted to just try and get his clothes together and make his way home.  But they had other ideas.<br />
<br />
They threw Mark back onto the bed of the truck leaving his pants and shorts behind.  Then, as they drove along, they pulled off the remains of Mark's shirt and threw it away.  Finally, they took off Mark's sneakers.  He was now completely naked.  He wondered where they were taking him as a couple of them pulled at his hand and foot claws, laughing at how well they'd been glued onto Mark.  &quot;I bet you they super glued those onto you so well you'll have to go to school like that Monday&quot; laughed one senior while tugging at the claw of Mark's right big toe.<br />
<br />
Finally the truck slowed.  In the distance, Mark could hear dogs.  Hounds.  He could smell them when the truck was still about a quarter mile away.  It was odd that the smell of a few dogs should be so strong thought Mark, still spread eagled on the truck bed.<br />
<br />
But it wasn't just a few dogs.  As Mark discovered when the seniors, as a group, picked him up and started running with him toward a fence, it was a bloodhound training school.<br />
<br />
Oh shit.<br />
<br />
But Mark only had a moment to panic.  A second later, with a rush and a jump and a grunting throw, they tossed Mark with his duct taped ankles over the 8 foot high chain link fence and into an enclosed area 100 feet long by 200 feet wide that contained some 3 dozen hounds.  Mark landed roughly and was dazed for a few seconds while a handful of hounds immediately surrounded him and sniffed at him.  As Mark frantically clawed through the duct tape and freed his legs, the yelps of the first group of hounds was attracting all the others and the seniors rushed back to the truck laughing about Mark going back to his dog friends.  But Mark was lupine, not canine.  He quickly got to his feet to emphasize his human aspect.  The dogs were perplexed.  They sniffed Mark's furry body.  Wolf.  Yet, he was standing on two legs and speaking to them.  &quot;Good doggies.  Good doggies.  I'm both your cousin and your best friend.  No need to attack me, doggies&quot;  Mark swatted them away from his rear and considered not doing so, but remembered that he'd last shit as a werewolf at the Tollivers' and not as a human so any traces of scat back there would be the product of lupine digestion.  Still, Mark felt a few dogs got their cold wet snouts back there and those hounds were even more convinced that Mark was just a wolf.  They barked aggressively at him and soon all of them were barking at Mark.  When a few started baring their teeth, Mark ran and then leaped onto a nearly bare tree in the middle of the enclosure.  He looked down out the pack of furious hounds.  &quot;How am I going to get out of this?&quot; he wondered.  He looked up at the full moon on a mid june night.<br />
&quot;Ow-owooooooooooooooooooooooo.  Ow-owooooooooooooo!&quot;  Mark bayed at the moon and then straightened up on the branch 8 feet above the dogs, where he sat.  &quot;What the hell was that?&quot;  In a moment of pure emotion, without any conscious thought or direction, he had behaved like any other wolf might have.<br />
<br />
His introspection was broken by the sound of a door opening in the distance and a couple human voices.<br />
&quot;. . the hell has got them going this time.  Another damn wolf?&quot; Mark heard.  But he also heard the sounds of a shotgun being loaded.  <br />
&quot;Oh shit&quot;<br />
<br />
Dogs or no dogs, Mark had to get out of there.  He frantically assessed his options.  Then he ran out two quick steps toward the end of the branch on which he sat and jumped off to the ground below.  Only a couple hounds were near him as he got to his feet and sprinted madly for the fence furthest away from where the men were coming with guns.  Two digs nipped at his legs and he had to give one a running back style straight arm to get it out of the way but he reached the fence almost unscathed.  In one leap, Mark was atop and then over the fence.  He heard a shotgun blast just as he landed on the ground.  His heart raced as pellets whizzed overhead.  For the first 50 feet away from the fence, Mark stayed low to make the men have to shoot through their hysterically barking hounds to get him.  It worked as there were no more shots and Mark heard the men curse the lack of a clear shot.  Near the edge of woods now, Mark straightened up a bit and ran as fast as he could into protective cover.  <br />
<br />
He made his way 100 feet into dense woods while trying to figure out where the hell he was and how to get home from there.  In the distance, he heard the men leashing up a handful of dogs each and talking back and forth about what kind of wolf that was.  Eventually, one said &quot;Doesn't matter anyway.  It's a dead wolf now&quot;<br />
<br />
But Mark knew they weren't counting on dealing with a human intelligence.  He saw a couple houses and roads in the distance that gave him an idea where he was.  Then he made his way to a nearby stream to get a drink.  He found himself bent over on all fours lapping at the water with his elongated tongue while his conscious mind was busy plotting how to get away.  He need to reverse direction and go generally toward the hound enclosure to get home.  He started that way and found that the stream he'd drunk from joined a larger one.  Mark intended to just run down the stream.  But there was also a network of paths running through those woods and Mark made use of it.  Every time a path crossed the stream, Mark rubbed his buns and his asshole on a branch or two up the path to give the dogs something to pay attention to.  In no time, the dogs were onto Mark's scent, but as they led their handlers down the stream, they kept turning off onto olfactory dead ends.  Mark ran way ahead and saw them still going in circles from a hillside almost a half mile away.  <br />
<br />
From there, Mark was just a furry streaker.  He ran across the interstate, easily running between groups of cars, across 3 lanes each way.  Into a residential neighborhood, he actually stopped in some shrubs just a few feet from a police cruiser.  Over the radio, he heard the dispatcher giving a description of a &quot;young african american male, five eight 130 with a, um, very small penis&quot;<br />
Hey!  Mark looked down indignantly at his wolf penis.  It's not *that* small.  Besides, it gets a lot bigger and that's when it counts.<br />
<br />
After 20 more minutes sprinting, Mark was in the bushes outside the St. Martin house.  He called up to Tony's open window.  He saw male model Tony's face at the glass.  He called for Tony to open the window and a moment later leaped up a tree and then climbed into Tony's room.  Tony gave him a hug.<br />
&quot;Hey, where are your clothes?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, some seniors got 'em&quot;<br />
Jack was also there and he also welcomed Mark back.  Jack was again 16 and not 76.  They told Mark that Jeff was due any minute with the chronivac.  Mark told them of his experiences including his surprise at his own baying at the moon.  Tony wondered why Mark was so surprised and Mark said that he thought his mind was always working.  Tony and Jack talked about the party and then in full sight of both, Mark bent forward where he sat on the corner of Tony's desk and pressed his chin to the base of his abdomen.  He stuck out his elongated tongue and licked the mussed up fur over his balls for a minute.  Mark straightened up as though nothing had happened and then looked at Tony and Jack staring at him.  His eyes grew wide.  What did I just do?  And all three laughed hysterically.  <br />
<br />
Finally, Jeff arrived and Mark saw the emitter glow yellow for a moment as he faced it.  His full body coating of fur became a bit less full and then sparse and then his skin showed over the length of his body.  His claws thinned and shortened and finally became mere nails.  The bridge of his nose grew higher and his nose resumed human shape and color.  He felt his olfactory senses dull dramatically.  His thin black lips became his own full pink young male model lips and he felt the tongue in his mouth shortening.  His fangs retracted into mere human canine and incisor teeth and he was his human self.<br />
&quot;I could definitely do that again&quot; pronounced Mark.</p>
