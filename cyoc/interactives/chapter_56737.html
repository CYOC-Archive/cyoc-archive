<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy (not Ami, that part of her has served it's purpose and returned to whence it came) <br />
walked groggily through the entry way to break, having spent the evening praying for the <br />
souls that how existed as the Gold Deer with limited forms of self expression and destine <br />
to be prey for her own kind and the leomans. <br />
<br />
She stopped right in front of Luna, Sunny, and Kira, and stared at them for three whole <br />
minutes with a calm almost serene look on her face. <br />
<br />
Luna and Sunny for their parts felt something shiver and shift inside them as the little white <br />
and red pup looked at them.  She who had the power to restore those trapped as -things- <br />
back into Lupman just as Penny had the power to restore those trapped as Leoman. <br />
<br />
Finally, Amy placed a few minor offerings to the goddess statues and their consort. Shinto <br />
was, if nothing else, encompassing and polytheistic.<br />
<br />
As Amy left without a second look, Luna and Sunny felt an odd feeling spread through <br />
them after Amy had placed her minor offerings in a small offering bowel they were sure <br />
wasn't there a moment ago and they hadn't willed into existence either yet was very much <br />
a part of them.  <br />
<br />
Kira meanwhile thought, 'Could I say that I'm part of the still world now so the code of <br />
honor doesn't apply to me? Ah who am I kidding? they'd say I was trying to have it both <br />
ways. There's only one honorable thing to do.' Kira then mentally spoke/thought/sent with <br />
all sublimity of a freight train to to the silver moon and golden sun goddesses  he hadn't <br />
known for more than a few days now with tiny souls within them.  'Luna. Sunny. Will you <br />
marry me?' <br />
<br />
Luna and Sunny were distracted from the strange feeling triggered by Amy's offerings. <br />
Honor strictly dictated that should a she-wolf be left with a male's seed, they were <br />
expected to wed. <br />
<br />
'Are we supposed to wait six months? Or can we be wed as we are somehow?' Luna <br />
thought. <br />
<br />
Sunny meanwhile, likely many who fought for a goal for so long they had nearly forgotten <br />
the purpose and reason for the goal itself, it felt -alien- to be proposed to, let alone have <br />
the almighty binding power of honor to back up becoming a bride at long last.  It was like <br />
climbing a long mountain, and now she was finally at the top and left with the confused <br />
thought of what to do now. <br />
<br />
Honor aside, common sense screamed that they had known each other for only a few days, <br />
and given Kira's life style choice, they were either going to be wed to a statue (which would <br />
leave most thinking them insane) or spend the centuries or eons to roll by as people <br />
around them LIVED their lives, growing up, growing old, and dying and being forgotten. <br />
<br />
And then there was their pups, would they be able to change 'back' when they would have <br />
been -born- as artwork with souls of their own opposed to that of the artist that made <br />
them? <br />
<br />
Luna sighed, letting the pack's basic laws of honor guide her, she knew the risks, she <br />
chose to play the game, and this was the consequences of her own choices.  &quot;I accept.&quot; <br />
Luna said/thought/sent first. <br />
<br />
Luna felt it strange, Sunny, the one who had always been in a blind rush to get married, to <br />
find a powerful lupman to be the trophy wife to and leech off him to live the good life, now <br />
found herself with a lupman who spend his life as a -decoration!- without a penny to his <br />
name. Not in the least what she had planned. But maybe, on the other hand, maybe it was <br />
what she had earned for herself. &quot;Your sun goddess also accepts.&quot; Sunny <br />
said/thought/sent at last.<br />
<br />
Kira now wondered if Glendale herself marrying the three of them would be legally <br />
binding... <br />
<br />
And the three large statues assumed more regal poses for the day. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
The dreams for Gillie were horrible. She dreamed that she was chained up in a cage in a <br />
circus like a Carnival sideshow freak. That was the bad part of the dream, the -worse- part <br />
of the dream was when the men came to pay the ring master to have sex with her... All of <br />
them with the faces of her officers before their change into lion-women. <br />
<br />
She was so glade when morning came. She did her best to ignore her grandparents as she <br />
did her best to be a good host and make breakfast for him, not sure what was supposed to <br />
be cooked and what was supposed to be eaten raw (never mind the number of diseases <br />
that could come about from raw egg). <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for your hostility dear.&quot; Mother Glen said. <br />
<br />
Gillie just grunted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marilyn and I are going to be going through the houses the Pride has to pick one for us so <br />
we won't continue to impose on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you fetch the directory dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie blinked and came back with the phone book.<br />
<br />
Mother Glen didn't so much as twitch, &quot;I meant the directory for the Pride houses dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie replied, &quot;I... don't know where it is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's rather odd for you Gillie considering you're the most organized woman I know.&quot; <br />
Mother Glen answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot has happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand dear.&quot; Mother Glen nodded, remembering the loss of Fox and Elise, <br />
wondering if Jensen would foot the bill to have a statue of the two made in their honor. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's all right I'll find it.&quot; Gillian said returning with a book Gillie hadn't seen before in her <br />
life but apparently was listed with all the names of the Pride and their houses... and as <br />
Gillie watched, but unnoticed by her grandparents, the list was growing before her very <br />
eyes. <br />
<br />
'I need to throw up.' Gillie thought with disgust. <br />
<br />

<br />
Present Day, Present time.<br />
<br />
Mal'Akh read the maps of Glendale, seeing what precious little remained of her world from <br />
three hundred years ago in the past. Of these colonies that were suddenly a nation that <br />
swept across one third of the entire continent while England's hold on the world was gone. <br />
<br />
She noted that Joella's orphanage was still standing, or at least what claimed to be it <br />
anyway, of course, who was to stay it wasn't just a shop or a field of grass now? Mal'Akh <br />
didn't know, but she made a point to visit  her friend's home when she could walk again.  'I <br />
didn't even get the chance to say goodbye. Joella, Aimiliona, Lark, Rosalie, Jimmy, I'm <br />
sorry.' <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
The four love dolls in her car, Serenity drove to Smith, er, Wolf Manor. Hoping to get some <br />
more answers from the odd witchling pup. Not knowing that Glass Marie was NOT part of <br />
the Big Bad Wolf Pack, and none of the Pride save or those listening to her tale at the <br />
moment except maybe Amy knew anything remotely about Kurse's adopted daughter. <br />
<br />
She considered visiting Trevor then remembered he'd be at school. She ignored the image <br />
of Trevor and Queen playing with a ball of yarn knowing it to be just a project of her <br />
imagination. <br />
<br />
She ignored the giant naked wolf people, and the even more giant naked lion people, let <br />
alone the statues she could no longer be sure were just victims of the game or stone <br />
beasts as the ultimate security system. She also did her best to ignore the brightly colored <br />
(if mostly clothed) cat people that were actually SHORTER rather than taller.  She also did <br />
her best to ignore the clothing stores that seemed to not be around as much anymore and <br />
the fur parlors that were... <br />
<br />
She saw a perfectly normal male human embrace a walking winged lizard/dragon creature <br />
female that was apparently visiting from Japan. It was a harsh reminder that the game did <br />
not just effect Glendale, it effected all existence. <br />
<br />
The love dolls for their part, LOVED the ride, getting to see the sights with each other and <br />
not being put in some black box away from each other was a very nice change of pace.  <br />
Serenity made sure to make a cell phone call to Father Mike that she'd be late dealing with <br />
some victims of the curse. <br />
<br />
Penny meanwhile, in another part of Glendale, had to deal with Umeko engaging in a <br />
cooking war with Penny's mother over who got to cook breakfast, Umeko citing honor and <br />
duty to serve Penny in all things, and Penny's mother of course citing sovereign rulership <br />
over her linoleum kingdom.  Penny just hoped it didn't come to blood. <br />
<br />
A little letter meanwhile, after many a hardship and near disaster, had finally arrived in the <br />
hands of the family of the little boy it was meant for, having been written by a 'cat and <br />
felman are just better' teenage girl felman, containing her genuine and heartfelt thanks for <br />
his selfless and heroic rescue from the thug who had tried to violate her after daring her to <br />
sing all the songs from the 'Aristocats.' <br />

1689 <br />
<br />
Being the witches familiar, Gaal, Golgatha, and Gamorrah could have easily seen through <br />
Lark's senses to see what had happened. But all three were at this time distracted by the <br />
games they were playing in honor of their foster child's birthday oblivious that she had <br />
slipped out during the festivities. <br />
<br />
Lark kept her word her friend/sister Joella to be silent, even to her friend/brother Jimmy <br />
who was always willing to listen to anything she had to say and thus Lark spoke everything <br />
to.  And while the witches could do many things, read the memories of the familiars was <br />
not one of them. <br />
<br />
Lark too her turn at body painting, but had changed her mind of having feathers painted <br />
on her as a joke on her name, now the image only made her shiver. Instead she went with <br />
a white, blue, red, and yellow square pattern  with thick black lines she had seen in her <br />
dreams. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;That's Piet Mondrian's work.&quot; Lawrence, the scholar still in spite of giving into his <br />
insecurities that had driven him to beef up his body. &quot;What you just described, that's Piet <br />
Mondrian post world war two paintings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza nodded, &quot;Indeed. The familiars were connected to their masters after all, and <br />
many of them would go on to develop the gift and/or second sight on their own after <br />
having been exposed to the infinite chaos and the witches were dead. Though as mana <br />
was being pulled all towards Glendale, this made it easier for such talents to manifest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just find it rather odd,&quot; Lawrence said, &quot;Considering Piet Mondrian's work in that period <br />
was dedicated to the sense of order and stability that people craved following the chaos <br />
and madness of the second world war.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps Lark was subconsciously seeking to balance out the chaos that was a part of her <br />
now, maybe it was dumb luck, or maybe she just liked the color, whatever the case, <br />
Aimiliona followed her like a shadow until the pattern washed off and wore off later... Daily <br />
bathing was not yet a common practice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty asked, &quot;Would Golgatha have her vision then? The one that decide everything?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was Eliza, Marie-Eliza's mother, still in her Victorian era dress that spoke, &quot;That would <br />
happen, the day before the final battle.  And Golgatha, Joella, and her child familiar <br />
bodyguard, would arrived at 'Grandpa's House' after Marie and her crew had already left, <br />
Golgtha having no idea Marie and her group had been there. She'd share final words with <br />
her foster-father, though not knowing they'd be final. She'd then transform a slave <br />
retriever from the south into one last Gold Deer for old time's sake. She'd by pass Marie's <br />
group twice by sheer chance, with Marie Cruz and Golgtha both having no clue due to the <br />
massive chaos within Glendale fogging her second sight.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Marie was more surprised than Running-Bear that he could come to and from the town of <br />
Glendale without ill effects, opposition, or bringing down the witches' attention: then <br />
again, as 'misguided' and 'brainwashed' as Gaal and her sisters thought their foster father <br />
was, the idea of him betraying them simply could not be comprehended by the witches. <br />
<br />
Perhaps it would have been simpler, easier, less bloody, quicker, and far more effective for <br />
Running-Bear to come to them, waited till they slept and killed them in their sleep. <br />
<br />
But, 'I can't do it.' Joseph Running-Bear thought, 'I don't care what they've become, they're <br />
still my little girls.' He knew it was a lie, but it was a lie that held fast much stronger than <br />
the truth, maybe it wasn't a lie, in their hearts, the witches had always refused to grow up.  <br />
<br />
While Vatican took it well, Kathrine was surprised and a little discomforted, while the <br />
bombs were nothing truly new, they were new to her, not having had an in-depth <br />
experience with modern warfare.  And like anyone seeing a new killing tool for the first <br />
time, Kathrine saw it as something that should not exist, while at the same time accepting <br />
the devices of death she had grown up with as simply being part of the world. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do we HAVE to use these?&quot; Kathrine asked. Not wanting to accident set herself on fire <br />
again and possibly permanently damaging herself even more so this time. <br />
<br />
&quot;If our plan is to work. Yes.&quot; Linus said simply. <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz and Running Bear meanwhile, took note of the people trickling to Glendale <br />
from the praying town each day now.. Marie Cruz seriously considered the very practical <br />
solution of simply tying them up until the witches were dead or even more simply breaking <br />
their legs so they couldn't want to meet their doom. <br />
<br />
Less and less actual genuine work was getting done in Glendale ever since the dawn of <br />
August. If the Puritans had been themselves free of the fog in their minds, they would have <br />
been sickened by the lazy, slothful and lethargic attitude most of it's people had taken on. <br />
<br />
And the natives now came to join the fun and games like the married couple (now brother <br />
and sister) had first. <br />
<br />
Only one child had used the term, 'savages' and that child could not longer no much as <br />
mutter a sound. The witches did not tolerate the term 'savages' in reference to their Foster <br />
Father's people, something they felt that placed them above the Dog of God and her <br />
fellows. <br />
 <br />
Gloria was not a part of the former mob. Nor was Grace, Donna, Ashton, Codey, or <br />
Chadwick.  The three boys and three girls were among those struck down by the wandering <br />
demons and taken from their parents by the witches and placed within their orphanage. <br />
And had a pair of lioness leoman body guards there to protect them as well. They had been <br />
Frank's prime mate and one of his secondary mates before the evil hunters had murdered <br />
him and Meranda.  <br />
<br />
The puncing/boxing trees waved welcome to those who Glendale had called out to, and <br />
who had answered the witches call to their paradise. <br />
<br />
Gloria was the first to see them coming, Grace was the first to declare their approach, and <br />
Donna was the first to greet them as they arrived. <br />
<br />
Ashton was the one who eased their minds of any confusion and worries and threw out <br />
things they didn't need to know about or know or feel anymore. Codey was the one who let <br />
the years slide off them, returning them to the purity and innocence and childhood for <br />
each step they took closer. And Chadwick was the one who turned their clothes and <br />
belongings into rainbow colored grass, no longer being needed and of no value to the fair <br />
and free world that was coming. <br />
<br />
The lioness Dawn was the one who stayed with six of the children driven mad by the hexed <br />
candy, ready to eat the bones of anything that dared to try to harm them that somehow <br />
made it past the protective geass that surrounded each of them.  <br />
<br />
The lioness Twilight as was her name was the one who took the new children by the hand, <br />
either leading them to the witches to become familiars, or simply allowed to roam free in <br />
Glendale which was exponentially becoming an unreal place, the younger and younger <br />
adults practically giving away their wares and foodstuffs. (THe fruits now growing from <br />
strange plants containing magical versions of LSD).  <br />
<br />
The fairies secretly 'spoke' with the punching/boxing trees, promising their nuts would <br />
serve as honored guardians to the fae when they became fully grown trees even if the <br />
current punching/boxing trees would not be there to see it.</p>
