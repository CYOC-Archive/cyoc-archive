<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The hot water streaming over Terri was a very convinient way to let her pretend like she wasn&#39;t crying. With a dejectedly slow and meandering pace, she set about trying to get herself cleaned off, washing away the various... <i>fluids</i> that had accumulated on her body throughout the past 24 hours. God, she just couldn&#39;t wait until her parents asked about the state of her clothes, and why she smelled like so many strange different things that a good girl definitely shouldn&#39;t have smelled like. Yet more reasons for them to yell at her, browbeat her, make her feel worthless like they always did. It was practically their hobby ever since she&#39;d made the mistake of coming out.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts couldn&#39;t help but drift back to Aubrey as she showered, just the image in her mind of that gorgeous girl making her chest tingle. Hands idly rubbed up and down her breasts as she thought about her, about how so very close she&#39;d been to actually finding happiness with her crush. And of course, she&#39;d just ended up throwing it all away, running off when things got too hard. She wanted to tell herself the weird demon thing, that it had soured her - but it hadn&#39;t. She knew Aubrey hadn&#39;t been herself. She knew that the redhead still cared about her, that if she went running back right this second she&#39;d be welcomed with open arms. And yet here she was, crying in the shower as she kneaded her breasts.<br />
<br />
Platinum blonde hair fell around her shoulders, all the way down to a huge pair of mammaries, soaking wet as she just quietly sobbed. If she&#39;d just had a spine, maybe she&#39;d still be back there. Maybe she&#39;d be with Aubrey, loving her, enjoying a night with her that would&#39;ve pissed her parents off and cackling madly at the thought of how angry they were. But instead, she always came back here, always looped around to being miserable and sad and submitting to the will of her stupid, bigoted parents. Part of her wondered if she could ever break out of this stupid cycle, ever manage to just let herself be happy instead of sabotaging herself every single goddamn fucking step of the way.<br />
<br />
She really was her own worst enemy - because even now, as she stood, completely trasnformed back into a bimbo, sex was still only at the back of her mind. Through the fog and haze, the forefront was dominated by the ever present loneliness, the sense that she&#39;d never get to be happy - and that it was her own fault, because she was too cowardly to ever just stop getting in her own way. Her parents hardly even needed to shame her - she did that herself, kept herself down in the gutter with all the effort she could possibly muster. It was all her own damn fault.<br />
<br />
Sniffing aloud, she let out a quiet, fruitless little muttering. &quot;I wish I had a spine.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Raize was already having enough of a fitful rage right now. Trapped in this bottle, feeling her golden vessel stuck in crushing depths as it drifted down to the bottom of the ocean, wondering if anybody would ever find it. Thus, when she felt a subcouncious copulsion - the distant uttering of a wish by a soul bound up with another soul bound up with the soul of a master she&#39;d inherited - Raize about wanted to screech. So infuriated was the genie that she snapped her fingers and granted it without a second thought - no clever wordplay, no trying to find a way to make it backfire, just granting the wisher exactly what they intended before turning her attention back to looking for a way out of this nightmare.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
There&#39;d been an odd tingling in her gut as she finished her shower, but she hadn&#39;t given it much thought. By the time she stepped out of the water, she was back to dark-haired, plain, average-looking Terri, staring into the mirror at her naked body with a frown. Not much to do, she supposed, but go down there and face her parents, get yelled at, get grounded, probably have them threaten her with being sent to some sort of conversion therapy camp. One of these days, they might even follow through on that threat. She sighed, wondering briefly if it at least might be an opportunity to meet some other cute lesbian girls before they started resorting to electroshock or something.<br />
<br />
They were just bastards like that. Complete assholes, who&#39;d never respected her. Never treated her like she was anything more than a pet, a plaything, a toy to dress and do as they pleased. Never letting her be herself. She... she hated it, so much. She kind of hated them - she&#39;d always denied that to herself, of course, but now? Now, as she started herself down in the mirror, leaning against the kitchen counter, Terri couldn&#39;t hold it back anymore. She hated them - so what if they&#39;d raised her? They were terrible parents, complete narcissicists who didn&#39;t even treat her as a human being most of the time. Why the fuck should she respect or love them if they weren&#39;t going to return it?<br />
<br />
Why the fuck was she even here?<br />
<br />
She&#39;d asked herself that question so many times, in the context of questioning her life itself. Now... now she merely wondered why she stuck around. Why she didn&#39;t go strike out on her own. It&#39;d be hard, sure... but she was an adult. She could get a job, do as she liked, and her parents had no real legal recourse to stop her. They didn&#39;t own her unless she let them own her... and as her eyes narrowed, Terri quietly made her reflection a promise, delivered in an upswell of newfound courage. &quot;Fuck &#39;em. I&#39;m never gonna let them own you.&quot;<br />
<br />
No. Never again. They were yelling for her, asking what the delay was - and she suddenly found herself shouting back with a tone far more confident than any she&#39;d ever used. &quot;Fuck you!&quot; A grin crossed her face as her dad sputtered and swore, and she hurried to throw her clothes back on, grab her wallet and her phone and keys. That was the most dangerous thing she&#39;d ever said to him, and it felt amazing. God, why hadn&#39;t she told them both to go to hell so many years ago? Terri wasn&#39;t sure why she&#39;d delayed, but she wasn&#39;t waiting a second longer.<br />
<br />
She tossed her pants and shoes back on, along with the bra - but she took a second to rip her shirt before heading out, tearing away the sleeves and midriff to leave behind a messy, sexy little number. Still soaking wet otherwise and not even caring, she stormed right out of the bathroom, passing by her parents in the hall and flipping them a dual bird. &quot;Do me a favor and go fucking rot in hell, dickweeds!&quot; she shouted, cackling with delight as they started swearing back at her - but they didn&#39;t stop her, and she was still flipping them off as she headed out the door, hopefully to never go back into that house again.<br />
<br />
The night was still young - and Terri knew exactly what she needed to do. She needed to get back to that beach and find Aubrey, or track her down wherever she&#39;d ended up - and when she did, she was gonna tell that gorgeous woman how much she adored her, make sweet love to her - and hell, she was gonna turn into a bimbo again for a while. Fuck it! It was hot! She liked being hot! Bimbo Past Terri was fucking smoking, and she didn&#39;t care who knew it! &quot;You hear me, world?!&quot; She shouted as she headed down the street, feeling free for the first time in her life. &quot;I&#39;m Terri Zhang, I&#39;m a fucking hot bimbo, and I fucking love Aubrey Chambers!&quot; Who even cared about the weird looks from people on the streets? She was finally happy - and she was never gonna go back to being sad.</p>
