<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Ryan, still fighting against his bonds, found that he was not going anywhere anytime soon unless someone got him out of his situation. At the moment, there was no hope, so Ryan just sood there in the dark while calling out to his friends anytime he heard a noise around him.</Br>
<Br>Meanwhile, Eric the werewolf moved silently and steathilly through the halls, following Ryan's scent. Eric the werewolf knew that he was getting closer since Ryan's scent was even stronger than it had been. Suddenly, Eric stopped when his lupine ears detected the sounds of chains rattling somewhere. It was faint, but Eric the werewolf knew that it must have been Ryan moving the chains. Eric dropped to all fours and sniffed the ground, seeing if Ryan's scent would get stronger. As Eric the werewolf brought his snout to the vent in the floor, Ryan's scent flooded his nose. Then when the werewolf Eric stood up on his hind legs, the weight of his body made the floor beneath him creak and Ryan shouted for help. Knowing that his prey, his soon to be werewolf brother, was within his grasp, Eric the werewolf howled in purposed triumph.</Br>
<Br>Having thought that there was no way that someone would find him like this, Ryan just stood there and saved his breath just incase someone were to come near him. Then, as if God Himself sent someone to help, Ryan heard the creaking of the floorboards above him in the ceiling. Ryan rattled his chains furiously and shouted for help, but then Ryan got the sense that maybe his idea was not a good one, for he got the attention of sounded like a wolf from it's howl. Ryan quieted down and hoped that the wolf would just leave, but he feared that would not be the case.</Br>
<Br>Knowing where the secret doors were, Eric the werewolf entered the one just ahead of him. Once in the secret passage, he knew that he was in luck because a staircase that lead downward was within a few of his massively long steps. Slowly he moved down the steps and smelled the air, ripe with not only Ryan's scent, but his fear as well. Continuing on, the beast reveled in the fragrance of fear, coming from one who his human side knew that never showed fear and was thought to be fearless. The beast loved the fact that Ryan was not fearless afterall. At the end of the secret passage, the door slid open loudly and Eric the werewolf stepped into total darkness, but with his perfect night vision the werewolf could see Ryan's perdicament. The werewolf felt that Ryan was too easy of prey now, but that was not going to stop him from making Ryan one of the pack.</Br>
<Br>When Ryan was silent, he heard the sliding of a door somewhere, then clawed footsteps faintly clicking against floor material, then down steps and finally a loud sliding sound that told Ryan that the creature was there with him. Hoping that he could not be seen, but knowing that he was probably as clear as day to the creature, Ryan knew that he was done for. Whoever it was that chained him up wanted this exact scenario to play out. He was always supposed to be like a pig led to the slaughter for this creature. Ryan's fate was sealed, he was going to die... or so he thought. Ryan watched on as the creature turned to face him, only being able to see its luminous amber eyes seemingly floating high off the ground. Ryan knew that whatever this creature was, it was no animal he had ever heard of. As the eyes hovered even closer to him now, Ryan heard the creature make a low gutteral and clicking sound within it's throat. Not wanting to even see what was coming, even though he really couldn't with his eyes open, Ryan shut them tight and braced for immense pain.</Br>
<Br>Seemingly, out of nowhere, Ryan felt razor sharp claws tear through his decently muscled chest. He felt the excruciatingly painful burning and stinging of a fresh and deep laceration. Ryan also felt the coolness of blood drip down his hot skin while soaking his shirt with his life source. The creature howled, which was ear piercing and sunk it's teeth into Ryan's neck muscles. Ryan screamed out in agony, overwhelmed now with pain and wished that the creature would just end it for him by tearing out his jugular. However, that was not what happened, whick shocked Ryan. Ryan felt the creature pull it's fangs from his flesh then rip his shackles open, allowing Ryan the chance to escape. Even though Ryan knew that this was not quite what he wanted, Ryan stood there feeling new things come over him. Feeling a rush to his brain, Ryan closed his eyes till it passed and when he opened them, he realized he could see as clear as day, then looked upon the creature before him. Ryan knew that what he was looking at was a real-life werewolf and because of the creature's inflictions, he was becomming one now too.</Br>
<Br>within minutes, Ryan's entire body transformed into it's new werewolf form and the two howled together. Now three existed and the two moved to make Sei a werewolf like them. Ryan and Eric the werewolves knew that Sei was very cunning and he wouldn't be taken down easily, so two against one was much more favorable.</Br></p>
