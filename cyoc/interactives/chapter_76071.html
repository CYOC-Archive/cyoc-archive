<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you watch Gene walk away you start getting ideas. Yeah, the flashlight is kind of kinky, but the more you think about it, the more you realize that it's also pretty silly. There are so many strange and silly things that you can do with it, making a half change on someone, using the intensity settings to shrink or grow parts, giving guys boobs or taking a girls boobs away. Heck, you could even use it to play pranks on your friends and they'd never get mad since they'd never know about it and thinking about pranks...<br />
<br />
You had planned to hang out with your boyfriend after your shopping trip and you get a great idea for an awesome trick to play on him.<br />
<br />
Just in case, you find a bathroom and duck into one of the stalls and brace yourself for what you're about to do.<br />
<br />
Pulling down your pants and panties, you put the light to a medium blue setting and shine it on your pussy. Immediately you feel a warm tingling start up, accompanied by a slight pressure. Your clit plumps up and begins to swell while your pussy lips start to feel strange. Curious, you put a hand down there and feel that your slit has closed up and your pussy lips have fused into an area of loose, baggy skin. The changes continue and with a slight popping sensation your balls drop and begin to grow. For a moment you play with your new balls, feeling them move slightly beneath your skin, then you move on to your clit, which has grown considerably and taken on the unmistakable form of an uncircumcised cock. Gently, you pull back your foreskin to get a better look at your new anatomy.<br />
<br />
What you see pleases you in more ways than one, and you continue to play with yourself, enjoying the sliding sensation and watching as your cock hardens. It's enough to make you understand why guys think of sex so much, it was never this easy for you to get aroused before. If nothing else, you realize that this light is going to make sex a lot more fun. Just the thought is enough to send a little jolt of pleasure through you and to start a dribble of precum from your cock. Curious, you run your finger over your cock head, smearing precum across in in the process. The slickness in amazing and without even thinking you grab onto your cock and give an experimental thrust into your hand. Lost in the moment, you forget where you are until you hear footsteps outside the stall and freeze.<br />
<br />
Realizing that you're about to start masturbating in a mall restroom you take a deep breath and try to clam yourself down. It takes longer than you would have expected and your still half hard when you start to pull up your pants.<br />
<br />
The sight of you underwear makes you let out a little giggle. It's a bright pink thong, the sort of thing your boyfriend thinks is incredibly sexy, but it's also obviously designed for a guy to wear, if the way it comfortably cradles your new anatomy is anything to go by. The feeling of the smooth fabric against your cock and balls is enough to start you getting hard again and you quickly pull up your pants, smiling at the way the crotch bulges slightly due to your new anatomy.<br />
<br />
Not down yet, you put the light to the lowest blue setting and lift up your shirt and bra. The light again causes a tingling sensation, but this time there's a feeling of lightness rather than pressure. You watch as your breasts shrink, going from a b-cup to an a-cup and smaller still until you're flat chested, and not just flat chested either. There's a slight hint of muscle that wasn't there before.<br />
<br />
Pleased with what you've done, you pull your bra back down, which is now padded to create the illusion of b-cup breasts and adjust your shirt over it. The feeling of lightness now that your breasts are gone is strange, but not exactly unpleasant. There's almost a strange sort of freedom about not having breasts.<br />
<br />
Ready to see how your boyfriend will react, you slip the flashlight into your purse and walk out of the restroom. For a moment you consider doing a bit more shopping, maybe going back to see what other items the magic shop might have, but you decide against it. There's always tomorrow and you can't wait to get back to your boyfriend. The feeling of tightness coming from your pants lets you know you should probably stop thinking about him, which only makes things worse. Having a cock is going to take some getting used to, but you think it'll be lots of fun and if it isn't you can always use the light to get rid of it.<br />
<br />
Walking through the mall you find yourself more aware of how guys look at you, the way they're staring at your breasts, not that they know you're really as flat chested as any of them, but you also realize that it doesn't bother you, or at least not the way it did before. Instead you realize you're checking them out too, undressing them with your eyes and wondering how big their cocks are. It's as though you never before realized how many hot guys there are out there.<br />
<br />
It's kind of startling, but also exciting, seeing things in a new way. Even waiting at the bus stop is interesting for you, giving you the chance to sit down and watch all the cute guys, though you discover that there are downsides to it as well. When a particularly good looking guy winks at you you feel your cock getting hard, straining against the fabric of your thong and the crotch of your jeans so hard that it's almost painful. You're sure that the bulge created is obvious and you look around to see in anyone is staring before carefully putting your purse on your lap.<br />
<br />
When the bus finally comes you carefully climb up the steps and sit down, careful to pick a seat all the way in the back where there's no one else near. Taking advantage of the relative privacy, you try to adjust yourself as discreetly as possible.<br />
<br />
Once you're back at the college, you practically sprint to your boyfriend's dorm, which is another discovery. Though it feels strange to have the weight of your new cock and balls down at your crotch, the lightness that comes from not having breasts is especially noticeable when you run. <br />
<br />
You collect yourself as you go up the stairs and knock on your boyfriend's door, grinning ear to ear the whole while.<br />
<br />
He opens the door and you throw yourself at him, giving him a big hug. <br />
<br />
&quot;I had an amazing time at the mall today. There's the coolest new store there!&quot; you gush, as your boyfriend nudges the door closed with his foot so he can return your hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; he laughs, &quot;Did you get anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; you lie, &quot;But I was thinking maybe later the two of us could go there and check things out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm-hmm,&quot; he nods, bringing his hands up to slide them under your shirt.<br />
<br />
For a moment you freeze, wondering how he'll respond to your padded bra, only to recall that the light adjusts reality so no one will notice. Still, it's exciting to feel like you're pushing things, on the verge of being discovered. To push things farther, you take off your shirt, allowing your boyfriend to see that you're wearing a padded bra.<br />
<br />
In response he licks his lips, &quot;Is this how we're doing things?&quot;<br />
<br />
He takes off his own shirt, revealing his well muscled and slightly hairy chest and you let out a soft hiss as your cock becomes rock hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Horny, are we?&quot; he reaches out and puts his hand between your legs, feeling the weight of your balls and the hardness of your cock.<br />
<br />
You expect him to say something, to show some sign of alarm, but all he does is smile, &quot;I think you are, aren't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no idea,&quot; you giggle.<br />
<br />
Really?&quot; he gives a gentle squeeze, causing you to groan, &quot;I think I have a pretty good idea. Take off your bra and I'll give you a little teaser.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hands shaking, you fumble with the clasp of your bra, wondering if he'll say anything about your flat, masculine chest.<br />
<br />
He doesn't say anything, of course, he just leans forward and flicks his tongue over one of your little nipples, gives in a gentle kiss and runs his lips over your chest to give the other a kiss, just like how he always did in the past. Every previous time you had sex, he would start out by playing with your tits, and you realize that nothing has changed, or at least nothing has changed on his end of things. For you it's a lot less fun having your chest played with. The way he flicks his tongue over your nipples still sends little jolts of pleasure through you, but they're nothing compared to the waves of pleasure that wash over you every time he gives your cock a gentle squeeze  through the fabric of your pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tasty,&quot; he stops to smile at you, &quot;A good start, but I think I want something more substantial now. Do you know where I can find anything like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
For good measure he gives you another squeeze and you practically fall backwards onto his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you?&quot; he starts to unzip your fly and pull down your jeans, &quot;Is it here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Yes!&quot; you gasp as he runs a finger under your thong and starts to pull it down, allowing your throbbing, erect cock to spring free. You lift your head to watch as he sticks his tongue out and runs it up the length of your cock. The sensation is like nothing you've ever experienced, a droplet of precum forms and he eagerly laps it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Delicious, but is there more?&quot; he smiles wickedly at you before taking your entire length in his mouth. His tongue flickers across your cock, up and down, teasing across the head as he slowly pulls back until just the head is in his mouth, before plunging back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; you gasp as he shoves you roughly onto the bed, keeping his lips firmly clamped down on your cock the whole time. You start to thrust into his mouth and he matches you pace perfectly, eagerly giving you a blowjob as though it was the most natural thing in the world for him.<br />
<br />
With you on your back on the bed he climbs up to join you, very carefully maneuvering to bring his crotch up to where your face. Knowing exactly what he wants, you fumble with his fly and pull down his pants and boxers until his own cock, big and hard is before your face. Taking it in your hands, you guide it to your mouth and begin to suck, surprising yourself with your willingness to go along. Normally you don't like giving your boyfriend blowjobs, but maybe it's because he's giving you such a good one that it's more fun.<br />
<br />
You can taste his salty precum and you smile around his cock, knowing that he's experiencing the exact same thing. You suck hard, trying to take him as deep as you can, but falling just short of being able to take his full length, like he's doing for you. Then again, he's at the advantage there since your cock is about half an inch smaller. Still, you're determined to give him the best blowjob ever, so you try to match what he's doing to you. When he flicks his tongue over your cock head it feels especially good, so you do the same to him. Every so often you change things up, bobbing your head up and down rapidly, sliding your lips and tongue over his cock as fast as you can.<br />
<br />
As you suck your boyfriend off you become aware of a growing pressure coming from somewhere around your balls, there's also a wonderful tension growing ever greater, driving you to thrust harder and harder into his mouth. The feeling grows stronger and stronger until you're in a frenzy of thrusting, gasping around your boyfriend's cock and practically sobbing because of how good it feels.<br />
<br />
Just when it becomes too much, reaching the point where the aching pressure is almost painful you reach climax, an orgasm rushing through you with such force it's like being electrified. Your cock twitches in your boyfriend's mouth, streams of thick cum down his throat and to his credit he drinks down every drop. Lost in your own orgasm you fail to realize that his thrusting into your mouth has reached a fever pitch until you feel a blast of cum shoot down your throat. The taste, which you've never been fond of, makes you want to gag, but if he swallowed all of your cum, you feel driven to do the same for him until at last he is done.<br />
<br />
He rolls off of you with a loud sigh, &quot;Man that was good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; you agree weakly, feeling tired and drained. The tension is gone, replaced by a comfortable ache and a feeling of deep contentedness.<br />
<br />
Shifting position so that you're laying along side him, you snuggle against him and he wraps his arms around you. Because of how the dorm rooms are arranged, there's a mirror on the wall across from the bed. It's partially obscured by the shirt your boyfriend has hanging off the corner, but you're still mostly able to see the reflection of the two of you.<br />
<br />
The sight makes you smile. Your long brown hair is a a mess from the amazing sex the two of you just had, the tangles framing your soft and feminine face. Below that are narrow shoulders and slender arms, again perfectly feminine, right down to your long, carefully manicured arms, but your chest looks like that of a particularly delicate young man. Lower still your stomach is lean and your hips are wide, but then there's your cock and balls. Looking at them in the mirror, you realize that you sort of like the way they look. They're not too big, now that it's soft your cock is probably only about four inches, and in your opinion it's a very good looking cock, feminine almost, if that makes any sense. Especially how it looks against your soft, sensuous thighs, but maybe that's because you always felt that your legs were always your best feature, long and slender, looking good even when you're not wearing shoes with heels.<br />
<br />
Cuddling with your boyfriend, you drift off into a deep sleep, comfortable and content.</p>
