<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A soft clattering filled the pantry as Peter started to hop around on his new hooves. The young satyr looked positively giddy. For the first time, Mark truly sized up the figure of his fellow pledge. He couldn&#39;t help but like what he saw.<br />
<br />
Peter&#39;s legs had been completely transformed by Mark&#39;s seed. They were covered in scruffy goat fur, and ended in a pair of familiar cloven hooves. Mark&#39;s eyes lingered on Peter&#39;s sheath a bit, watching his thick goat cock bob up and down in the air. Peter was clearly pent up. There was a trail of pre dribbling down his shaft, dripping onto the pantry floor. Peter&#39;s upper body was a bit more recognizably human. His fur tapered off, and he didn&#39;t have nearly as much body hair as Mark. His horns were a bit shorter as well. Rather than a massive pair of ram horns, Peter just had two short nubs poking out of his hair. Peter&#39;s whole appearance struck Mark as a very &quot;new satyr&quot; look. He still had the telltale pair of goat ears however. They flickered in a really cute way and... and...<br />
<br />
Fuck, Peter was hot.<br />
<br />
Mark felt his sheath stir again. He had to actively fight the instinct to go over there and take the new satyr up on the offer to return the favor. It would be so easy to just-<br />
<br />
Baah! Focus! Mark took a deep breath, looking over at his friend, &quot;We can go party in a minute. I just need to do something real quick first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah, seriously?&quot; Peter gave Mark an incredulous look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes seriously!&quot; This was all impossible, and he really needed to start calling for help...! Mark reached down for his phone, and instead just patted the fur on his thigh.<br />
<br />
Peter watched the gesture, clearly misreading it. &quot;I&#39;m not giving you another blowjob.&quot; He grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No, I-&quot; Mark reflexively patted his fur again. Right, he wasn&#39;t wearing pants. No pants means no pockets. He scanned the room nervously. Where had he left his phone-<br />
<br />
Ugh, right, all his belongings were still tucked away in the common room. &quot;I need a phone, can I borrow yours?&quot; He bent down onto the floor, starting to fish the device out of his friend&#39;s discarded pants.<br />
<br />
Peter stared, &quot;What do you need a phone for right now? Come on...!&quot; He wagged excitedly, starting to make his way towards the door.<br />
<br />
Baah! Shit! Mark had to think of something quick...! How about uh, &quot;I... want to get a picture of this!&quot; He pulled the other satyr back into the pantry, awkwardly posing for a selfie. When the phone&#39;s lock screen shined back at them, he held it out to Peter, &quot;Oh, could you unlock it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter bleated in frustration, &quot;One quick picture!&quot; The device&#39;s facial recognition software protested at the pledge, but a few quick taps of a PIN brought the device to life.<br />
<br />
Score! Now Mark just needed to figure out how to keep Peter in here long enough for him to call The Second Skin and-<br />
<br />
&quot;There you two are!&quot; A familiar voice called out from the doorway.<br />
<br />
Oh no... Mark spun around, watching Travis hastily enter the pantry. The pledge shut the door shut quickly, &quot;I thought I heard clops in here and- Hey!&quot; He stared at Peter, &quot;You got one of those costumes too? No fair!&quot; He crossed his arms.<br />
<br />
Peter&#39;s eyes lit up, &quot;Baah? Oh, you want some fur of your own? I think I can help with that...&quot; He quickly clopped over to Travis, pulling him further into the pantry.<br />
<br />
Baah! This was bad! Mark was a few minutes away from having yet another satyr to deal with, and... Actually, this would take a few minutes, wouldn&#39;t it? Mark clopped to the side, shutting the pantry door. He found a nice storage container to sit on in the corner as he fiddled with the unfamiliar phone. Glancing up, he could see Travis lustfully exploring Peter&#39;s fur while the satyr helped the human out of his clothes in return.<br />
<br />
Mark pushed aside a twinge of jealousy. He pulled up Google Maps, quickly punching in the name of The Second Skin. To his frustration, it didn&#39;t immediately pop up. He dismissed a few unrelated taxidermy places and tried to remember what costume-related keywords he put in earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, you&#39;re huge!&quot; Mark looked up, watching Travis get down onto his knees. Travis never stuck Mark as the sort of person to give a blowjob in the back of a walk-in pantry, but there seemed to be something about satyrs that just drove humans wild. Mark reached down, teasing his sheath as he enjoyed the show. He had just climaxed moments ago, but he could already feel his manhood swelling again. Baah, just how many rounds could he go in an evening?<br />
<br />
Mark hopped up off his storage container, intending to find out. Peter&#39;s phone slid off his lap, harmlessly landing on the plastic lid. Baah! Right! Getting help!<br />
<br />
He begrudgingly sat back down and picked the phone back up. Naturally, a lock screen stared back up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah! Hey Pete, what&#39;s your PIN?&quot; Mark waved the phone.<br />
<br />
The satyr flashed him an incredulous look. &quot;For Pan&#39;s sake, I&#39;m kinda busy at the moment!&quot; He reached down, holding Travis&#39; head between his crotch. The human was looking... less human. Travis always struck Mark as a naturally hairy fellow, but there was no mistaking the two goat ears on the side of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna take a video!&quot; He lied, grinning back over at his friend. He mimed holding up the phone sideways. Thankfully Mark was starting to figure out what made satyrs tick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine! I-&quot; Peter&#39;s breath hitched as Travis&#39; tongue slid over the head of his cock, &quot;One-two-three-four-f-f-five-seven!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark stared, &quot;Really?&quot; He punched the number in. Peter&#39;s response was just a lusty string of bleats. Mark could... almost understand them actually. Something told him Peter was going to climax soon.<br />
<br />
Turning back to the phone, Mark typed in a more generic search for a &#39;Costume Shop&#39;. Sure enough, The Second Skin&#39;s entry popped right up. Score! He quickly scanned through the details and- Baah! There wasn&#39;t a phone number!<br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t a web page either. Just a name of a shop, and address, and no images. He scowled at the screen as the room started to fill with the sound of eager bleats. This was clearly some community-made entry for the shop. Merlin didn&#39;t strike Mark as the kind of guy who&#39;d be tech savvy enough to navigate listing his store on Google Maps.<br />
<br />
Ugh, he&#39;d just have to clop back to the- Err, walk back to the shop. It wasn&#39;t that far away, but it might be tricky to convince three randy satyrs to abandon a party. Mark&#39;s tail flickered a bit when he realized he&#39;d mentally put himself in that bucket. He turned to his friends, clearing his throat, &quot;Baah, hey guys, I really think we should-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Baaaaaah! Don&#39;t stop...!&quot; Peter moaned desperately as Travis sat crouched on the floor, stroking Peter&#39;s massive shaft with both hands.<br />
<br />
Travis grinned, leaning forward for one last lick. &quot;Mhmm, someone&#39;s close?&quot; He leaned back, making a show of lifting both of his hands off Peter&#39;s cock, &quot;I&#39;ve got a better idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pledge&#39;s goat ears twitched playfully as he started to climb up off the floor. Baah! He was already so far along! Travis was now a hairy beast of a man, and Mark could see his new horns from across the room.<br />
<br />
Travis turned around, presenting his ass to Peter. A scruffy goat tail curled up into the air, inviting the satyr in. &quot;Why don&#39;t we give this a try?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah! Now we&#39;re talking!&quot; Peter grinned, clopping forward. He pinned the young man against a nearby drink cart, pushing his cock towards its prize.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooooh! Easy, I-&quot; Travis&#39; legs buckled as he felt Peter start to probe his rear. His tune quickly changed however as Peter found his mark. &quot;Baah! Oh my- Baaaaaah! Harder!&quot;<br />
<br />
Strands of fur quickly started appearing on Travis&#39; legs. Each time Peter thrust into him, a bit more of his humanity melted away.<br />
<br />
Mark heard the hollow sound of the smartphone bouncing off the container&#39;s plastic lid. He hadn&#39;t even processed that he had dropped the phone, and he didn&#39;t look down to verify that&#39;s what the noise was. The observation left his mind the moment it had entered. Mark was already back on his hooves, coaxing his shaft out of his sheath.<br />
<br />
He could... deal with whatever it was later. The urgency of the moment that had been gripping him so fully washed away as he watched the two fornicating pledges. Right now, all he knew was that he needed to get up in there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah, room for one more?&quot; He bleated playfully in Peter&#39;s ear. Before the satyr could respond, Mark slid his cock up underneath Peter&#39;s tail.<br />
<br />
Peter let out a startled bleat. He moaned, feeling himself sandwiched between the two satyrs. Mark quickly joined the two&#39;s rhythm, prodding the pledge&#39;s rear. With one last thrust, he entered Peter, and the three began to move as one.<br />
<br />
The sound of muffled bleating started to fill the frat house. Discreteness was the last thing on the three satyr&#39;s minds as they rocked back and forth. The party was in full swing at this point, but their bestial moans of pleasure could still be picked up underneath the party&#39;s pounding music.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Travis&#39; eager body couldn&#39;t take anymore. His new satyr shaft climaxed onto the drink cart he had been pinned against, staining the tablecloth and splashing into a punchbowl. Mark came a moment later, filling Peter with more of his potent seed. It was more than the sandwiched satyr could take. He let out a moan of pleasure, climaxing into Travis in return. The experience of being fucked while fucking someone in return was nearly too much for Peter to handle. His English skills got pushed further back into his mind as he let out a string of lust-filled bleats.</p>
