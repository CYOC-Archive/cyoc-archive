<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cameron was staring at Elliot like the cat was some kind of poisonous viper. The cat reached out to grab the tanuki&#39;s paw, but he jerked back. The sudden movement made Patrick jump and he bumped his tray causing pancakes and sticky syrup to fall down the front of his shirt and his lap. The milk went in the other direction, quickly spilling across the table and soaking Zach&#39;s uniform.<br />
<br />
Cameron didn&#39;t even seem to notice, instead getting up and away from the table as quickly as possible. Something about Elliot seemed to really bother the jock. Patrick just looked down at himself and sighed, though Zach was looking a bit more annoyed. Milk in fur was just unpleasant. &quot;G-guess I need to shower.&quot; Patrick stood and cleaned up as much of the mess as he could before throwing out the rest of his meal and running back to his cabin.<br />
<br />
Zach wasn&#39;t far behind, though he left his tray sitting on the table. Luckily he wasn&#39;t glaring at Patrick but rather Elliot. The mouse wasn&#39;t sure he could deal with either of the beefy jocks being annoyed with him.<br />
<br />
Patrick made it to the cabin, where Cameron had gone to hide from Elliot. He was deep in thought, barely noticing when the mouse came in to swap into his bathing suit and grab his showering supplies. The soiled clothes went off to the side to be dealt with later. Patrick looked at the tanuki then to the door. They weren&#39;t friends, but the guy had been trying to look out for him. &quot;Um.. you okay, Cam?&quot;<br />
<br />
The tanuki looked over at the mouse, looking shocked and confused. &quot;Yeah, sorry, something about that Elliot reminded me of one of my exes. Not a good sort. I should probably warn Zach..&quot; He seemed to finally realize the mouse had prepped himself for a shower and waved him off. &quot;Don&#39;t take to long, we got a game to run.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patrick nodded and ran off to the showers. He didn&#39;t like the idea of public showers, all those guys in one spot, it felt like the high school locker rooms all over again. Why was he worried? Locker rooms had never bothered him before? Hell, he practically owned them. But memories of teasing and towel whips came flooding in and overrode the feelings. Luckily, it should be empty as most showered before breakfast.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t though. There was one counselor in the showers. A completely naked Zach, his usually upright mane slicked down from water, his muscled body almost seeming to glisten as the water ran over him. Patrick pointedly left his swim trunks on as he turned on one of the faucets.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need to be ashamed. We&#39;re all guys here.&quot; Zach said as he noticed Patrick coming in. If Cameron was going to look out for the odd little mouse, he supposed he could help. It might win him points in his teammate&#39;s book too. Points he could maybe exchange for a little alone time.<br />
<br />
Patrick scoffed. That was easy for him to say. The cock hanging between his legs looked twice as big as his own when it was hard, and the zebra was still soft. He didn&#39;t have anything on Cameron&#39;s plump balls though. He gritted his teeth and turned back to lathering up his fur. Why was he even thinking like that? Something was seriously wrong with him. He shouldn&#39;t be thinking about other guys&#39; junk. And yet, he kept looking over to the Zebra and biting his lower lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna touch it?&quot; Zach had turned to face Patrick, one hand on his hip, the other around the base of his cock, giving it a little flop.<br />
<br />
Patrick nodded. He reached out and wrapped his paws around the zebra&#39;s shaft. He had never touched another guy&#39;s cock before. He thought it couldn&#39;t be that different from handling his own, but it was. It was warm and he could feel it hardening in his hands, the steady rhythm of Zach&#39;s heartbeat as blood pumped into it. He opened his mouth and ran his tongue along the head, teasing the slit. It was salty and musky, with just the slight hint of the soap Zach had cleaned himself with.<br />
<br />
Then he let go, taking a step back. He could feel heat rising in his cheeks and ears. &quot;S-s-sorry..&quot; He mumbled and ran out of the showers, barely taking time to even dry himself off as he ran back to his cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.&quot; Zach took a few steps after the mouse, but he had already run off. The zebra let out a small sigh. He hoped that didn&#39;t get back to Cameron in some way that made him look bad.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Soren watched from one of the picnic tables as Patrick burst out of the showers and went scrambling into his cabin. &quot;You couldn&#39;t have, I dunno, just turned him into an eight year-old girl for the weekend and kept him out of my hair?&quot; Of course no one was near Soren, but he still felt a stiff breeze roll by him. &quot;Right. Alex&#39;s rule number two, don&#39;t question the camp.&quot; The next breeze was softer.<br />
<br />
&quot;But between him and that cat Elliot you&#39;re really testing me this weekend, aren&#39;t you?&quot; He swore the rustling leaves in the tree sounded like laughter.</p>
