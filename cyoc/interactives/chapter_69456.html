<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tricia looked down at the remote and couldn’t believe any of it.  She went from being an eighteen-year-old high schooler ready to graduate to a 24-year-old woman who graduated in college and is ready to take on the world.  Not only that, but also her reality and memories went forward with her, making sure it matched her age.  It was almost like a dream come true.  This remote can change anyone into anything they want and now she has it right at the palm of his hand.  The possibilities are really endless.  She can shrink in size, change her gender, turn into an animal, modify her body, pretty much anything she wants.  But looking at herself in the mirror, she didn’t want that.  Since she aged to six years, she got a brief glimpse into the future.  Sure it cost her a dad but time does heel wounds right?  So feeling more eager then ever, she pressed forwards on the remote and watched the changes take place.<br />
<br />
Looking on, she saw her body continuing to mature with her breasts expanding, her hips widening, and her cheekbones moving high up.  Tricia could tell that she was developing into a fine woman.  All around her, images around begin to flash before her eyes again.  She saw flashes of her apartment back and forth in between flashes of the city and the restaurant where she has a part time job as a waitress.  She even caught flashes of a guy she seen constantly since she started out as a waitress and she thought he was cute.  Then flashes of a fashion company where she was working as a designer and going to fashion shows and the like.  She then saw flashes of going to exotic locations like Paris, London, Italy, and Japan.  She continued to watch all this happening around her until she let go of the fast forward button.<br />
<br />
When she did that, she looked around and noticed that she was in the back room of a church.  Wondering why she was in there, she turned to the mirror and discovered her answer.  Standing in front of her is a 34-year-old woman wearing an elegant dress with frillies at the bottom hem, silky white gloves that go up to her elbows, a strapless blouse with a V shape down her back and low cut to show off her C &frac12; cup breasts, and a veil covering her face.  She soon realized that it was herself, only aged ten years in a matter of seconds.  It was unbelievable!<br />
<br />
Then, her mind started to go foggy as she placed her hand on her head.  What is actually happening is that her memories were catching up to her body, making her remember stuff after 24.  For example, after three years as the waitress in the restaurant, Tricia was founded by an agent who works for Costello Tagliapietra who liked her designs.  The agent then gave her a job and she was completely ecstatic about it.  At first she started off as part time designer with monthly payments $1,000 - $2,000 to boot.  But as years passed, she left the waitress gig and became a full time designer, making $500,000 to $750,000 a month.  She kept on moving up in the world as she went from a small apartment to a penthouse sweet up over at a popular building.  She even went to foreign countries to get some inspiration for her fashions since she saw those images whizzed by that fast.  In fact, the wedding dress she wore is one of the outfits she designed.  She wanted to make the dress look like that of a fairy tail.  And boy she made it all possible.  The wedding dress she had on is that a princess would wear head and toe.  She made such a huge accomplishment for her wedding.<br />
<br />
Another memory came to her that’s also important.  She started to remember this young man named Henry Walter that came to the restaurant she use to work as a waitress.  He continued to come to the restaurant everyday just to see her and it made her feel a little nervous.  But after many months, she was getting comfortable around him.  Soon enough, they started talking and hanging out under a couple of times, slowly becoming friends.  When she got the job as a fashion designer, the two grew closer together.  They started going to plays, expensive restaurants, and shop for the finest of things.  They even went to a couple of trips in Europe just to look at the sites while Tricia looks for inspiration for fashion.  Then she remembered what happened two years ago.  On a trip to Paris, France, Henry did something she didn’t expect.  On top of the Eiffel Tower, he placed one knee on the ground and opened a small box containing a shiny diamond ring that sparkled in the sunshine.  Upon doing that, he asked for marriage, marking this to be the most wonderful moment in her life.  Tricia was completely ecstatic about this and couldn’t believe this was happening.  So feeling caught in the moment she said yes to him and put the ring on her finger, ending it with a hug and a passionate kiss.  Now after all the years of planning and invites, and money, it has come down to this day.<br />
<br />
Tricia looked down at the remote one more time and was amazed at what it did.  She got a huge glimpse of her future and liked it.  Happy with this, she wondered what she was going to do now.  Is she going to return back to eighteen, completely satisfied that she already has a bright future ahead of her?  Continue to move forward in time to see what other surprises she has in store for herself.  Or remain in this time period and enjoy her new life.  After this much thought, she came to a conclusion.</p>
