<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The boys grinned at one another, each noticing the wood the other was sporting in front of one another and in front of their father... their father who was looking more and more like a sexy beast as time went on. They just enjoyed taking in the sight, not shying away from the fact that they were hard as a redwood tree standing tall, firm and proud in those shorts that they were wearing. The more that they were in their father&#39;s presence, the bolder they both felt, knowing that he was the one in charge and if he wanted them to let their wood show, then that&#39;s what they would do!<br />
<br />
Brandon, a bit bigger than his brother Ethan stepped up with a boastful puff to his chest as if he was trying to show off, feeling a little cocky... though it was more than that. It wasn&#39;t self-pride either. It was a sense that he wanted to make his father proud of him, just like Ethan did, but it was more than that. It was like he wanted to have his father first... to taste the manliness that Ryan exuded, submitting to him as their dominator... their owner so to speak. &quot;You know dad... I think we should see if there is a secret passage or something like that around here. The foyer screams secrets... don&#39;t you agree. Maybe there is more to this place that is hidden away.&quot; Brandon said with a sly grin as the house itself took to know his meaning as it developed a secret dungeonesque place right beneath their very feet.<br />
<br />
The house slowly modified itself, transfiguring the very ground beneath it as a stone stairway developed following the stair&#39;s own descent, delving deeper and deeper into the earth below. Lights popped up every few feet to illuminate the stone stairwell as it corkscrewed around until it reached the wooden oak door with the framing being all made of moonstone... a stone that wasn&#39;t real, but the house made it so and added something beyond the door to talk about it to make the owners feel as though it really was real. The room beyond the door was massive... nearly the full size of the foyer entrance above it with the ceiling appearing as though it was see-through like a two-sided mirror that the police used to watch interrogations of criminals for a case. In the room along the majority of the wall were books and movies all dedicated to werewolves, mostly the big, terrible and monstrous beasts they all thought werewolves should be free to be... if they were real, not knowing that the house was making them a reality starting with the three of them. In the center was a U ring deeply anchored into the ground with silver chain links that clasped to a thick silver neck ring to subdue whoever was wearing it and making sure they weren&#39;t able to grasp on anything to use it to escape if they so tried... which the monstrous werewolf would try as it would seek out food and others to add to their pack. Fortunately for them and the house itself... these three wouldn&#39;t dream of tying themselves up and they would embrace the wolf as it was their deepest fantasy to do so. However, the U ring was in the center of a giant Satanic circular pentagram painted with the blood of virgin humans who desired the Dark Lord to be born into the world. If anything, the house was going to be thorough giving the trio everything that they could ever want with such a place as this. Outside of the pentagram were five, thick and black candles that looked fresh and have never been burned. Inside the pentagram at the five points of the secondary pentagram, five more candles sat atop of each point as if to draw power into the center to bring forth more changes than just a beast. Between the pentagram and the entrance to the room, which separated that point of power from the stairs, was a large and old slab of wooden planks that looked incredibly rustic as if it was a huge piece of a doomed vessel that tried to make its way across the vast ocean, failed and was repurposed into a table. In the center of that table was what looked like an altar that flowed upward, palms open with five fingers each, with thick, curled talons for claws that had an old-looking tome placed inside of the palms and opened to the middle of the book. The middle describing the Alpha that was foretold. The Alpha that would bring about the end for humanity and the beginning for the demonic gods to rule over them... the wolf beasts from hell... all of which was written in what looked like blood. Again... if the house could grin from the work it had done, it would be grinning wide and wryly right then. Proud of the work it had accomplished for the trio once again, the house focused its work upstairs, creating the well hidden and highly camouflaged door that would open with a secret lever mechanism of its own design and making.<br />
<br />
Back upstairs the trio of men were looking around, trying to see if they could find a seam or a split of some sort to indicate the placement of a hidden door or something but could not find a thing that could be what they were looking for. &quot;Hey, Dad...&quot; Ethan called out near the head of the werewolf that made up the banister&#39;s end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, son... what is it?&quot; Ryan asked as his voice seemed to boom with power and dominance that made Brandon and Ethan both quake with need at their knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... um...&quot; Ethan said as he lost his train of thought for a moment. &quot;I think I may have found something. This werewolf head at the banister seems to be movable... like the more tusk-like fangs were meant to slide over one another like real teeth. It is either that or it was made with such attention to detail it was impeccable!&quot; Ethan said with a bit of giddy excitement as he watched his father and brother walking over to him to investigate what he had potentially discovered.<br />
<br />
As Ryan approached it, his body was slowly filling out his clothes thicker and thicker, making them tighter and tighter, accentuating his thick and burly and nicely haired muscles that made up his arms and sexy as hell thick chest. His arms swelling to seventeen inches in diameter at first, his shoulders rounding out nicely to cap off the thick and burly pectorals that were swelling underneath the cloth as it stretched a bit taut. Ryan couldn&#39;t help feeling sexy, manly and like a true masculine beast. The only thing that was missing was a uniform like that of a cop or a military man. Sadly, the house couldn&#39;t help there... there was no way to change that much without the sons noticing their father changing so very deliberately. The house wanted what they wanted... for it to be natural... for it to be a true part of them and if the house changed something like that, it would be breaking their desires. However, the house could bend reality a bit and offer a closet nearby with an officer&#39;s uniform that would fit their father perfectly. Ryan drew closer and closer to the head, however, noticing that there was a point of depression in the head like it was a hidden button carved perfectly into the carved tuft of fur and pushed it down, which released the jaw and the open muzzle slid down, closing perfectly and audible click could be heard by the thickest portion of the stairs that Brandon was closest to. As it popped open, just barely, Brandon&#39;s eyes caught it and shouted for the others to head over to where he was as he slowly opened the door. Initially, he thought it was just a closet as several police uniforms hung there, but noticed a secondary panel behind the clothes as he moved them aside, wondering what else could be contained there, only to find another secret door hidden in an already secretive room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan... dad... you gotta come see this! Not only did you guys find a secret hidden closet with police uniforms... three to be exact... there is another hidden door behind it!&quot; Brandon cried out as he looked at one of the uniforms that looked like it would fit him perfectly, shrugged his shoulders like &quot;what the hell&quot; and started to strip right there... not taking any thought about his brother or dad there. In fact... he wanted them to see... wanted his father to look and be the subject of attraction for his father and that he would wear anything to please his dad... especially since he knew that all three of them had a little bit of a uniform fetish.<br />
<br />
Ryan stared at his son as he walked closer, watching him strip down to his undies and just grinned to himself. The thought of just taking him then and there was running rampant in his mind, but at the same time... something in him wanted to wait for the perfect moment and that moment wasn&#39;t it. &quot;Ah... wanna be in a cop uniform... just like your old man eh?&quot; He asked with a sly grin as he walked closer. &quot;Hope there is one in there for me... for starters! Though... what did you say about a secret door?&quot; Ryan asked as he was near enough to reach out for Brandon and embrace him in a lustful and seductive kiss.<br />
<br />
Ethan didn&#39;t say anything as he followed behind, entranced by his father&#39;s broader and thicker back in the shirt he wore for the drive there, but if his father could see him... he would be proud of how open Ethan was being about his sexual appetite as his mouth hung open slightly while drool started to flow from his lips. Ryan on the other hand continued to feel stronger, more dominant, knowing his boys would listen to him as he commanded that they get on their knees and service the drippy and slickened cock he could feel throbbing in his pants while at the same time, he hungered to taste both of their thick and drippy cocks as well. There had always been the fantasy of him being on his knees for two virile men and now... instead of just some bearish muscled men... it would be his boys as the bearish muscled men he would taste sometime soon. <br />
<br />
Ryan peered into the closet as he saw the other two police officer uniforms, which he thought was quite fitting for what he wanted and what he liked. Pulling out the one that would have been in the middle, he noticed that it was bigger to give him room to grow into while a pair of nice looking black and polished leather boots rested on the floor directly below the pants. However, as he peered into the closet, looking at the uniform, he noticed the same secret secondary door behind the closet and was curious about what was inside. First, however, Ryan decided to strip and give his boys a bit of a look of what was to come as he quickly changed into the uniform, teasing them with just a glimpse and felt far more relaxed in the bigger sized and better fitting uniform. Ryan, Ethan and Brandon could all feel a strange pull from beyond the secret&#39;s secret and they wanted to see what was down there.</p>
