<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer was mentally and physically beaten. Wasn&#39;t this what she wanted...? Jennifer cackled in the floor as she was starting to lose her sanity and wanted more. Her brain trembling as the thirst got stronger. The parental love had turned into an unsatisfiable incestuous lust. The mental images of herself being her mother&#39;s so-called customer had turned into a reality. Jennifer rolled over and thought about the love between her and her mother. The love that... Huuahh-ahhh!!! NO! no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-NO-NO-NO, ABSOLUTELY NO!!!<br />
<br />
Jennifer panicked as her 18-year-old mind returned back. She had blanket out for a moment and backed into a corner. She could feel the presense of someone else inside her brain. If she was Jennifer who was the other one. The lust demon inside her who begged for more. The one that had constantly given into the despair and enjoyed this. Jennifer didn&#39;t like this. Jennifer didn&#39;t like this at all. She named the sex pest personality Lucifer. She imagined Lucifer being a horned succubus who looked like Jennifer and tempted her to think these devious thoughts. She couldn&#39;t talk directly with other entity but every time she felt excited or fearful Lucifer would take over her and make Jennifer to blank out. This she just thought that or did the Lucifer explain that... How many people she had inside her brain? Jennifer was losing her marbles as she curled up once more and didn&#39;t notice her devilish smile she had put on her face. It was similar like what her mother had.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Jennifer screamed as she hit her head to the wall. &quot;Lucifer if you are in there! Don&#39;t make things worse! I beg you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer leaned on the wall and thought about how much she wanted to fuck her- NO! No she didn&#39;t want to do that. But maybe a little... NO! Jennifer didn&#39;t want to do anything to her mother and... Jennifer&#39;s mind... No her mind was getting dizzy from all the thinking. She had to get some water from the kitchen as she walked outside. Still wearing the warm black hoodie smelling of... ugh... nevermind... Jennifer decided to push one of the chair and drink water from the kitchen tap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Going somewhere?&quot; A graveling voice asked.<br />
<br />
Jennifer noticed a big puff of smoke passing through her and she noticed her grandma Mary who looked even worse than her mother. Smoking a cigarette inside the house she looked at Jennifer. Mary was wearing a full-body tight black latex skinsuit that made a leathery sound as she moved. Only her shoulder lenght hair and face were visible as she took a huff from the spud. The awful boys locker room smell with the worst smelling mynthol tobacco made the sniffing experience even worse. It was like her grandma worked as a football coach who never showered or even worse as the coach&#39;s personal whore who he banged when no-one was looking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- I- I got thirsty that&#39;s all...&quot; Jennifer spoke softly and with a hint of distress.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-ha.&quot; Mary said and took a long inhale from the rest of the cigarette and then placed the used spud into a metallic case. &quot;Kid. Listen, can you make a promise with your granny? Come bang my door as loud as you can if your mother ever mistreats you. If you promise me that I get you something to drink. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhmm.&quot; Jennifer thought and agreed with a little bit hesitation.<br />
<br />
Then out of her room Mary handed Jennifer a light blue colored sports drink and said to drink it fast. Jennifer opened the cork and Mary begun to rant a lot of things as she watched Jennifer drinking the whole bottle. One particular sentence struck in Jennifer&#39;s ear as she tried her best to pour it&#39;s content down her throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;...I&#39;ve havent seen you like in months. I trust in Sylvia, but like, I always have to remind her daily to feed you guys. I have no idea what she does to you. I&#39;m worried sick but like I&#39;m busy with my own... uhmmm... work stuff... sooo, anyway. I think you are good kid and...&quot; Mary spoke but was interrupted as Sylvia opened front door. Jennifer quickly was pushed inside Mary&#39;s room as Sylvia hold something inside her hand.<br />
<br />
Mary&#39;s room stank awful. Even worse than the bathroom which was already in level of public urinal. The combination of cheap bod spray, cheap perfume and the fish market smells made Jennifer to almost gag as she had difficulties to breath. The red and pink LED-lights made the whole place look like a different room. The velvet and silken bedsheets and plankets made the whole place look like a fantasy room. The crown in the middle of Mary&#39;s bed was the massive purple dragon cock with a pump that was pointing upwards like middle finger. Mary tried to keep Jennifer hidden as Sylvia pushed Jennifer deeper into her den. Jennifer couldn&#39;t believe how much imported smut her grandma had in the small room. It was like a library for exotic reading from all over the globe. Uncensored magazines full of tits, cocks, fantasy creatures and the semi realistic dragon models were filling the bookcases. It was like her grandma had a fixation for fantasy sex or even worse. This was her kink. Jennifer saw an opportunity and pocketed one of the magazines under her hoodie and tried to kept it hidden. Jennifer could hear that Mary&#39;s and Sylvia&#39;s conversation evolved into a shouting competition and from there to name calling and cursing. Luckily Sylvia went to her own room while Jennifer was quickly escorted out of her grandma&#39;s sex dungeon.<br />
<br />
Mary didn&#39;t say anything as she shooed here way and slammed the door. Jennifer, now belly full of liquid, looked the very dusty and unclean living room and decided to take something that resembled a planket. A XXL-sized man&#39;s blaiser looked fitting as she dragged it inside to the bathroom with her. Jennifer almost forgotting the whole morning ordeal was fixated on the grandma&#39;s book and even if she couldn&#39;t read the weird scribbly lines. The book had enough pictures of drawn women and men that made her exited. The book had 70-pages but it was enough for her to reread it&#39;s content four times. She tried to keep the blaiser hidden under the towel pile as it was now hers. Jennifer was starting to get calmer as she was able to keep her brain busy.</p>
