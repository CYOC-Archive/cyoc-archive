<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Sargent&#39;s barber shop was a quick ten minute walk from the edge of the property line. The driveway itself was a little under two miles long, so if the Cadets could keep a modest pace they should arrive at their destination within the hour. Obviously one of the two Cadets was determined not to go anywhere Cadet Corporal Stevens would want, but fight as he might he could not resist the command to march. The marching command is one of the most fundamental and powerful orders in the army, not easily ignored, not even from a mildly superior officer. At least for one of the Officer&#39;s Cadets. In the end the Cadet Corporal was able to get his subordinate officer to the small building in less than fifty minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the literal fuck Cadet Corporal Stevens! I don&#39;t need a hair cut! This is ridiculous. I&#39;m practically bald as it is.&quot; Cadet Stone protested<br />
<br />
 &quot;Then you&#39;ve got nothing to lose, sport.&quot; Cadet Corporal Stevens gloated, leaning heavily into his inflatedly superior roll.<br />
<br />
The Sargent new insubordination when he heard it and set aside his work to tend to the matter.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can I help you fine young men?&quot; He offered politely<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Sargent. You might remember me I was here 5 days ago with my father. I&#39;m Cadet Corporal Stevens from the at home boot-camp down the street. This is my platoon mate Cadet Stone&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yes. I recall your visit, and I&#39;ve noticed your facility. It looks like just the sort of place a pair of strapping young men like you need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you very much Sir. We&#39;re proud of our program, and of our platoon. Only, we&#39;ve been having trouble getting everyone on board with the process, you see.&quot; Cadet Corporal Stevens explained, gesturing to the captive Cadet beside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I here for a hair cut or is this guy going to play military counselor?&quot; Cadet Stone interjected acerbically<br />
<br />
The Sargent also knew a conversational shortcut when he saw one and pounced at the opportunity to expedite this Cadet&#39;s visit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, a hair cut of course. You ARE looking a little seedy. Take a seat and I&#39;ll get you taken care of you right away.&quot; <br />
<br />
Cadet Stone realized he&#39;d shot himself in the foot by imposing himself into the conversation. He might have let the two waste more time with pleasantries before having to get buzzed. At this rate he&#39;ll be back digging trenches before breakfast. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine!&quot; Cadet Stone relented slumping down into the barber&#39;s chair &quot;Shave me bald. Whatever&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s what you&#39;d like.&quot; The Sargent responded cheerfully<br />
<br />
&quot;What I&#39;d like is my hair back. My curly mop they shaved off when I enlisted in that boot-camp... Fat chance of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense, boy. I&#39;m a professional. Hair is my business after all.&quot; The Sargent said draping the styling cloth around the young Cadet and raising him with the chair to a workable height. &quot;Lets start fresh with a quick shampoo.&quot; He rotated the chair 90 degrees and gently leaned the boy&#39;s head back into a curved sink, applying globs of fragrant goop and massaging his scalp gently. After rinsing away the suds, he raised the boy back up, holding his head concealed within a medium sized towel and dabbed away the excess moisture.<br />
<br />
Cadet Stone was skeptical of the whole process, he didn&#39;t believe for a second he could get his hair back, but the water felt nice and he had to admit it was better than digging a trench. As far as he was concerned he was still goofing off.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s that then?&quot; The Sargent inquired, pulling the towel away and revealing a springy head of tight curls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit&quot; Cadet Stone said, &quot;My hair! It&#39;s back!&quot; and then with raw concern, &quot;Can I keep it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s what you&#39;d like.&quot; The Sargent said, &quot;but it&#39;s not the hair cut of a Cadet, now is it? You&#39;d have to give up your friends. Your peers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even better!&quot; Cadet Stone explained joyously &quot;I don&#39;t have friends in the platoon; everyone hates me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why should they hate you?&quot; The Sargent pressed, pulling to bring out the truth<br />
<br />
&quot;I let them down, I guess. They... worked really hard and I got them in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s no reason to abandon them now.&quot; The Sarge prodded &quot;When you let your friendships down, maybe it&#39;s best to build them back up again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cadet Stone couldn&#39;t argue with that. He did miss having his friends and running away from them wasn&#39;t going to fix that... Wait, what is he saying, that place is nuts. It&#39;s literally torture town, he&#39;s even tormented in his sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t understand, Sargent. That place. It&#39;s evil. Every day it&#39;s nothing but work, uncomfortable clothes, grueling exercise, bad food, and doing what you&#39;re told.&quot; Said Cadet Stone, scoffing mildly through his nose shaking his head<br />
<br />
&quot;I think, I&#39;ve got a pretty good idea of what that&#39;s like&quot; The Sargent laughed hardily, &quot;I&#39;ve been through the real thing myself you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, yeah&quot; Jason laughed lightly, releasing some of his built up tension and lowering his guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it isn&#39;t easy Jason. Sometimes you feel like you&#39;re not strong enough to endure the load. But remember why we admire people who overcome the most difficult trials. Nobody cares if you climb a little dirt mound, but a man who has scaled Mt.Everest is inspiring to the whole world. In a way, the difficulty of our trials is what defines our worth.&quot; The Sargent pushed the idea into his head <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh he can endure the worst of it, trust me!&quot; Cadet Corporal Stevens interjected &quot;He&#39;s endured more than any of us and always asks for moor!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so, Jason?&quot; The Sargent asked, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so. Yeah. I mean. I take the punishment over the work. I like to choose my own way. I don&#39;t like taking orders.&quot; Jason admitted<br />
<br />
This was a tough boy the Sargent realized. He&#39;d need to use that to his own advantage.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a wonderful gift you have Jason. Imagine if you used it to help your friends accomplish their goals instead of setting them back. Think of what you could accomplish, think of the Everest&#39;s you could climb.&quot; The Sargent let the thought linger in the boy&#39;s mind then added, &quot;They need you.&quot; and pushed the idea deep into this mind while simultaneously pushing a mental fog over his memory of any friends he had that hadn&#39;t joined the platoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot; Jason admitted<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Jason, it was nice talking to you. You&#39;ve got your hair style back so I guess my work is done.&quot; The sarge announced pulling back the styling cloth to reveal Jason wearing his old cargo shorts and hoodie.<br />
<br />
The Sargent pushed a thought of his platoon friends and a sense of duty to foster teamwork.<br />
Then he enhanced his longing to use his special gift of resilience to push his platoon friends to be better people.<br />
Then he associated the idea of &quot;better people&quot; with &quot;obedient Cadets&quot;, but so subtly that he would never notice.<br />
<br />
Jason sat there dazed and, somehow unhappy at the sight of his old self. He wanted to help his friends, and it felt wrong leaving them there to face the boot-camp alone...<br />
<br />
&quot;But do I really still have friends at the boot-camp?&quot; Jason asked himself in a daze, not realizing he&#39;d said the words out loud...<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m your friend&quot; Cadet Corporal Stevens offered cheerfully<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d be my superior officer. That&#39;s not friendship.&quot; Jason dismissed the notion outright. No, he was friendless no matter where he turned. There was no point in going through all the turmoil and bullshit if he wasn&#39;t with his friends.<br />
<br />
The Sargent sensed the mood and pushed a bit of teamwork into Cadet Corporal Stevens as well...<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I mean it. I&#39;ll give up my rank to prove it. We&#39;ll be equals again. We&#39;ll push each other to be the best we can be. We&#39;ll advance through he ranks together. What do you say?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean it?&quot; Jason said, sort of touched by the offer - but the Sargent pushed the gratitude much deeper and you could almost see Jason start to get misty.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really do.&quot; Cadet Corporal Stevens admitted &quot;and Cadet Carter isn&#39;t really mad at you. He wanted this whole mess to be over with long ago. He&#39;ll be happy if we all just decide to enjoy each other&#39;s company again and work together!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Sargent pulled away any barriers that would cause Jason to doubt the truth or sincerity of those words. And made his move to drive Cadet Corporal Steven&#39;s gesture home.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a true friend Cadet Corporal Stevens. Allow me to relieve you of your senior duties.&quot; Gently sweeping one of his brushes over the Cadet Corporal&#39;s shoulders revealing his rank insignia had disappeared into thin air.<br />
<br />
At that, Jason let out a tender laugh of deep emotional energy... Looking Jason over he could see the boy was ready, it was time to lay the options out in front of him.<br />
<br />
The mirror Jason was looking into had a thin seam down the middle, the Sargent swung the two mirror panels outward to reveal an image of Jason in his street clothes on the left and an image of Cadet Stone wearing his dress uniform on the right.<br />
<br />
He allowed the boy a minute to take in the imagery before assigning each of the two options a specific name to be considered by.<br />
<br />
&quot;How will you choose to live?&quot; the Sargent began &quot;As the selfish loner, or the honored friend?&quot; Pushing Jason to accept that those were accurate descriptions of the two images he saw... and waited for the inevitable conclusion.<br />
<br />
Jason considered both options honestly. Somehow his old self wasn&#39;t what he remembered. He saw so little of value in him. But when he looked at the cadet he saw honor and dependability and integrity. He was a hero to his friends and a credit to his platoon. He never settled for doing things the easy way. He was a fighter, and he fought to make those around him better... <br />
<br />
......&quot;Honored Friend!&quot; He said, releasing more pent up emotion with a bout of choked back joyous laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s what you&#39;d like.&quot; The Sargent said, replacing the styling cloth in one swift motion.<br />
<br />
He began by taking the clippers down to a number two all over the boys head. Jason&#39;s curls falling to the ground and forming a springy pile in his lap.<br />
<br />
The Sargent impressed upon the the youth the ideals of teamwork and loyalty and friendship making those his paramount moral pillars. He included appreciation and respect for exacting obedience but even greater respect for going above and beyond that which was necessary or expressly requested, but above even that a respect for pushing oneself past the limits of what is even practical to expect a person&#39;s capabilities to allow! He would seek to bring out the best in others and encourage his greatest traits to develop in those around him. <br />
<br />
He continued with a number zero setting around the sides and back, bringing the hair follicles practically level with the skin. And swiped just along the crown with a number one setting to soften the fade between top and sides.<br />
<br />
Then he made sure to give the boy more than he bargained for: He would readily accept the Officer&#39;s directions and happily conform to whatever the man saw fit to require. He would gladly put other&#39;s needs before his own and he would conduct himself with politeness and class in all situations and never feel any shame in doing so. He would be blindly loyal and fiercely naive to any point of view that conflicted with his new aspirations.<br />
<br />
For the last step he sprayed a layer of water around the boys head and performed a final pass on all three sides with a straight razor. He gently patted the boy&#39;s head dry and took a couple quick swipes behind his exaggeratedly protruding ears with a clean towel.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are cadet. How do you feel?&quot; The Sargent asked, removing the styling cloth to reveal Cadet Stone&#39;s clean and tidy dress uniform.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel incredible.&quot; He admitted freely. &quot;Truly uninhibited... I feel like I could take on the whole world! Thank you so much Sir. You&#39;ve really given me a lot to think about. Everything is just so clear to me now. I simply can&#39;t thank you enough!&quot; The Cadet exclaimed, beaming a thousand watt smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was truly a pleasure, son.&quot; The Sargent said genuinely &quot;I know you&#39;ve both left a man in the field, and you&#39;ve got to get back to his aid, but, I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve seen him in my shop before is that right? Cadet Carter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right; he&#39;s our good friend! I can&#39;t wait to get back and help him knock out that construction job.&quot; Cadet Stone said practically shaking with anticipation...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, do me a favor and send him over soon for a free hair cut. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s been a while since he had one.&quot; The Sargent said mentally inviting useful details from the boys.<br />
<br />
&quot;He got his the same day I got mine, but his HAS grown out quite a bit more than mine. Heck, I&#39;m not sure mine&#39;s grown at all now that I think about it&quot; Cadet Stevens offered innocently rubbing his head with a chuckle &quot;But I noticed Cadet Carter&#39;s hair cut appointment was penciled in on Sir&#39;s calendar when I was in his office just earlier today, he&#39;s supposed to be coming here tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cutting it pretty close at 6 days, Officer&quot; The Sargent thought to himself... &quot;I suppose that will be fine&quot; he said &quot;But no later, and best to make it early tomorrow if you can.&quot; He impressed a drive into the boys to encourage the visit as best they could. The stone&#39;s influence was bound to wear off eventually... No sense risking an incident.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Anything else I can do for you Cadets before you continue your grand adventure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well..&quot; Cadet Stevens started, &quot;I was wondering....&quot; his unease was apparent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be shy boy, I like to help&quot; The Sargent encouraged<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a way you can give a person Cadet Stones special gift? Make them more resilient against discomforts and irritations. I have a real hard time working and thriving in uncomfortable situations. Id like to be better about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid that kind of thing is innate for the most part, but I&#39;ll bet you&#39;ve got a lot more of that in yourself than you know. I remember when you first came in just 5 days ago, you were even more feisty than Cadet Stone over there in some ways.&quot; He said chuckling, &quot;I&#39;m sure I can help you bring a bit more of that out in yourself if you&#39;d like to take a seat.&quot; He gestured over to the chair in a welcoming way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; The Cadet said, quickly mounting the chair.<br />
<br />
The Sargent started by wrapping the cadet in the styling cloth and brushing the head gently with a soft bristle brush, He coaxed about a millimeter of hair to grow out all over the Cadet&#39;s head. Then he buzzed the entire head evenly with a number 2 setting.<br />
<br />
He impressed upon the boy to redirect his energies to fortify his own resiliences. The numb himself to pain and discomfort. To hunger and thirst, to fear and irritation. He would now be more able to bear extreme distress and would also be made to use this skill to benefit his team. To push his friends to better themselves and become more obedient, more fulfilled Cadets. But he would not be so numb as to remove the sting of justified punishment, that would would always strike as deeply. And character building discomforts would always yield their intended effect, he would just not find them so difficult to endure.<br />
<br />
He continued with the zero setting around the sides of the head and number one setting around the crown. Then he cleaned up the back and sides with the water and straight razor.<br />
<br />
He would also strive to emulate the ideals of his good friend Cadet Stone and find that his energy is infectious and compelling. He would strive to embody the same presence and composure.<br />
<br />
Having finished his task the Sargent wiped away the excess water and swiped the towel gently behind the boy&#39;s out-turned ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that about do it for you?&quot; The Sargent asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure does.&quot; He said excitedly. &quot;I fell ready for anything. Thanks for everything Sargent. I think you saved our whole platoon today!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m here for. Now you&#39;d better be going and get your platoon mate a little relief!&quot; He said smiling<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing&quot; &quot;You bet&quot; &quot;Bye Sir&quot; &quot;Goodbye Sargent&quot; &quot;We should run back the whole way!&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll race ya&quot; &quot;Come on let&#39;s hustle, hustle, hustle&quot;...<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
Cadet Carter had been digging non-stop for the last 2 hours and he had little to show for it. He&#39;d barely made a dent in the trench. You wouldn&#39;t even have any concept of the intended size of the planned trench by looking at the Cadet&#39;s meager progress. He liked to think the hard part was breaking through the grassy surface, but in reality was just in over his head doing this alone. He decided to take a quick water break when he heard a pair of voices whooping and shouting in the distance, accompanied by a heavy thud-toned patter of boots clamoring his way. Shortly, a pair of Cadets filled to the brim with energy rounded the corner. His platoon mates had returned. Cadet Stone even skipped the last few hundred feet playfully bounding into the construction area with gusto.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry we left you alone so long but we&#39;re going to make it up to you. You can count on it!&quot; Cadet Stone breezed along past Cadet Carter grabbing the shovel right out of his hand leaving him in a stunned silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead and take a break. We&#39;re both feeling fresh and ready to move some dirt!&quot; Cadet Stevens added noting the shocked look on Cadet Carter&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re both in a peculiar mode. I take it the hair cut was... Helpful, somehow?..&quot; Cadet Carter asked bewildered<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure did. We both got hair cuts. From the Sargent! He&#39;s a great man.&quot; Cadet Stone blurted out excitedly. &quot;You should go see him soon. Your hair is looking really long, it&#39;s almost touching your ears!&quot; The boy was simply brimming with energy. Moving shovel after shovel of earth as he spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re on the schedule to get a hair cut tomorrow, but I&#39;d be happy to take you back right now if you want.&quot; Cadet Stevens offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tomorrow? From the Sargent?&quot; Cadet Carter inquired<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, it&#39;s already scheduled but he&#39;s not busy right now, I wouldn&#39;t mind bringing you in.&quot; Cadet Stevens pressed again as he effortlessly tossed another scoop of soil.<br />
<br />
Observing the wildly changed behavior of his platoon mates made the prospect of visiting the Sargent a truly terrifying one. He didn&#39;t like the idea at all. What kind of barber cuts a persons hair when it looked like Cadet Steven&#39;s hair did. It was perfectly presentable, it doesn&#39;t look any different now than it had when he left. And how does a round of hair cuts turn mortal opposites into best pals?<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we&#39;ve got a lot of work to do here. Sir comes back tomorrow so we should really try to finish our work first before we worry about grooming.&quot; Cadet Carter presented reasonably.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d get more work done if you talked to Sarge first.&quot; Cadet Stone promised &quot;He&#39;s a great motivator!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you unmotivated&quot; Cadet Stevens asked concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all!&quot; Cadet Carter perked up as much as he could, trying to put this topic to bed &quot;I&#39;m just glad you two clowns are back to lend a hand and I&#39;m not going anywhere until this trench is done.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two cadets seemed satisfied by the answer, but Cadet Carter was scared to death by the prospect of going wherever those two just came back from. He had to find some way to keep from having to go, but if his hair cut was on the schedule, it was as good as unstoppable.</p>
