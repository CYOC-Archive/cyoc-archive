<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wonder why the real need to make a changeling subject as dumb; when if able to remember and could understand commands, would learn to obey?&quot;<br />
<br />
What Ken asked caused then one of the men to step forward, as facing up to Ken; as then directly motioning for his associate friends to as well surround Ken. The technician then looked Ken in the face as if waiting for some other question or statement. <br />
<br />
However, Ken stepped past the technician, he showing a disregard for the man, and went closer to gaze upon a woman becoming more a goat. The woman tries to plead with Ken as though he were some manager there; her larynx having changed leaves her tonal quality about that of a born goat. She bleated loudly, that made Ken take a step back and away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, as don&#39;t feel scared by her tries to plead, they all beg for compassion; beside the fact her head is showing major changes, and some noises that goats can make sound rather humanlike. Don&#39;t pay her no minding, what she might now be capable to think as hear are but actual bleating. Goats, you should know have a variety of bleats, and each individual goat, whether a Doe or a Billy has its own distinctive voice. Bleats can range in volume, pitch and depth. She shall when fully transitioned to her new species shall feel content when in good health. Generally speaking, but goats, Does mostly are usually quiet creatures of habit, full of energy, very playful, if foolishly curious; just as the Billy goat tends to act rambunctious and as well sexually mischievous; but you should already know all that, right!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken was listening intently to the explaining of detailed information about what the changing lady would act like, as do when she were all a goat. The men noted how Ken, he contorted his face when the goating&#39; woman let go her bladder control and did urinate a stout stream upon the floor. As Ken&#39;s face grimaced a little as if of thinking if he could direct some manner of compassion, was about to ask a fool question as to her not going through the final phases of changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I demand to see your company identification if you please sir, as you ask of too many imprudent questions and ideas suggesting of offering clemency to her a changeling,&quot; the bigger as tall and stronger than was Ken, the technician asked of Ken.<br />
<br />
The asked question dealing with ID brings Ken&#39;s thoughts back from the sensual furry fantasy hung struggling before him, and reminds him of his reality right then and there.<br />
<br />
Although to try as act tough, Ken turned to facing the technician, and with a scowl at the man and then turns again to pickup the clipboard. His hand is blocked by one of the other men, as if the three men see a commoner action as an obvious maneuver or ploy.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fun is over, he&#39;s a nobody, good try buddy but your inquisitive nature has won you a place in our files,&quot; said the technician to Ken. As then three pairs of strong hands take a firm hold of Ken by his arms as the questioning tech-man looked Ken in the face for any suggestion of seeing fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tough guy huh,&quot; said the man to Ken. As did Ken stood there not struggling, he considering, thinking, as looking for any possible escape. Ken came to this erotic amusement park with likely the hope for such a situation. A furry fun fantasy enthusiast, Ken held a hope that of his joining the fate as one of those many Pleasure Island&#39;s lucky, sexual beasts.<br />
<br />
Seeing that Ken felt a wanted for, the Technician smiled as he turned to look at the tray of syringes laying spread out just ready for such a fool and/or a willing victim as Ken.<br />
<br />
Ken watched the man as if thinking to guide the man&#39;s hand away from picking one syringe, as rather to another, something different than he becoming a Billy goat; as more perfect for Ken to live as and enjoy. It suddenly strikes Ken that his thoughts are plainly stupid, because whatever the man would chose, was going to rob Ken of his human form, mentality, and future.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven syringes, but only three real choices, let me see which one would fit a tough guy, someone so stupid enough to get himself into such as this situation, hmm..., now what then Buddy,&quot; asked the Technician as he wondered aloud.<br />
<br />
Ken musters up his strength and asked, &quot;Do I have a choice?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Technician reacts quickly, he turning to look at Ken, as the Tech-man&#39;s face shows his wonderment at a human about to be sent into the animal world, and wishing to have a choice. He offers a smirking grin to Ken as if willing to hear Ken&#39;s request.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw on the clipboard the names of my three friends listed being a group of transitioned males. They were specified to being as male donkeys, Jackass studs, virile donkeys, as I would appreciate and prefer to join my friends,&quot; remarked Ken, his face lacking the usual tweaks of fear.<br />
<br />
As then one of the two men left holding Ken begins to laugh, and then the other man looked at the Tech standing by the platter of syringes, just as he smiled broadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your friends, they were cowards, crying, and pleaded for not to be as donkeys! <br />
<br />
So now then there is you mister tough guy, and here wanting to become and live as a timid donkey ravaged by sexual urges. No, buddy that fool life ain&#39;t your style but, I think we can still send you along to live by their side,&quot; says the man to the Tech, just as he picks up a syringe filled with a light blue liquid.<br />
<br />
Ken can only stand there and watch as the syringe is poked into his left upper arm, and that blue liquid of change is pressed out and then into his bloodstream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prepare him further, while I inform transport we shall have two more coming,&quot; says the one quiet man holding Ken, and shuffled Ken to standing close beside the mostly changed nanny goat woman.<br />
<br />
Quickly Ken&#39;s wrists are cuffed and he is shackled so most any movement is kept quite minor. He watches as scissors come and cut away his fancy trousers, shirt, and then underwear leaving him stock naked, and feeling rather chilled, wishing he had a fur pelt. Although with his heart then racing, as breathing becomes rapid, Ken holds his hand to his chest. A case of the shakes begins, as he shivering, wonders how much pain he will soon know and whether he can still escape somehow?<br />
<br />
Knees are knocking of the deep seeded fear Ken is having over what he&#39;s got himself into; just then one of the man returns holding a small box, and when opening it, he shakes out two more syringes. He then turning to look at his victim, the man smiles seeing Ken&#39;s first sign of obvious discomfort; he left standing butt naked and not fully knowing his fate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey tough guy, your not looking so rough and tough anymore! <br />
<br />
Oh hey but just you wait and see what the science lab sent down, as these serums were ordered just for one nosey guy like you,&quot; he chuckled, as he picks up one long needle syringe, as walks toward Ken. &quot;Prepare to join your friends,&quot; says the man just when he jabs into Ken&#39;s right thigh the syringe filled to full with a brown liquid.</p>
