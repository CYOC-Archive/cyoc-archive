<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the days progressed, Barbara would get into a mini-cycle during the breakdown. She would wake up, mess around with her fusion, mixing with mostly her blown-in air and every other day or two helium inside her body, to perfect and see what she likes through her left palm. Playing around with her light body and floatiness, she would either way go down and just binge-watch the shows she likes to watch, sometimes taking selfies and video-calling Martin. She would keep up to date with the records and reports as the wave still goes at force, hearing and seeing the poor stories of some humans, animal-hybrid, objects with mouths, and literally anything in between. However, as the night rises high, Barbara reverts her form to her &#39;deflated&#39; state, as she would start to coin her body states, and she goes to bed, forming extremely realistic dreams about needing to inflate herself against danger.<br />
<br />
After each night of terror and fear, Barbara would wake up, beading sweats. Keeping the days recorded, she realizes today is finally the day for her full check. Remembering the doctor&#39;s note, Barbara prepares herself for the best form she could get herself in. Going over to the now new helium tank she has been slightly using during her experiments, Barbara prepares her body to be slightly filled with helium, only expanding her stomach a little and making her float only a few inches above the ground. Now in her air-filled state, Barbara pushes down the air within her stomach into her thighs and butt, making her have that busty fill she once had. Getting prepared in a nice dark green sundress, Barbara grabbed her phone and purse, and not even putting on some footwear, started to swim over to her door and into the hallway. Now with more experience, Barbara has picked up a posture of laying flat back up above the air, making it easier and more efficient for her body to move around. As she effectively goes out, Barbara swims over to the flight of stairs above, and now moves her back up to stand, jumps over the rail, floating down and safely floating above the floor still. After repeating her notion twice, Barbara now waits in front of her building door, waiting for the ambulance to pick her up.<br />
<br />
After some time, Barbara sees the ambulance vehicle pulling up, this time seeing a man with a missing right arm. After going out of the building, Barbara was prompted by the door opening to see a couple of other people in the back, as the man says in a deep chill voice, &quot;Please come in here Barbara.&quot; After floating up to the level of the vehicle, the man holds Barbara&#39;s right hand and brings her to the back of the space, which has a tied robe against a hook. The man informs Barbara that she will have to be tied up by the waist and after a deep knot against her body and sundress, the man walks out and closes the back of the vehicle. Looking at the others, Barbara sees two women sitting across from each other. One with a head full of leaves and branches, and the other with a big mouth and noticeable sharp teeth. As the vehicle started its&#39; drive, Barbara felt her body floating towards the back doors and against the robe, being pulled back to be just in front of the other two.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look like a perfect fusion,&quot; the leaf-haired girl said to Barbara with a soft valley tone. &quot;It&#39;s because I am,&quot; she responds and hears their surprised reactions. The big-mouthed girl speaks with some bass afterward, &quot;Nice. What&#39;s your fusion?&quot; Showing off her left palm, Barbara answers, &quot;A balloon. I worked at a party retail store in the early morning, and was filling them up as I got fused.&quot; The leaf-haired girl responds, &quot;Oh wow, Me and Heather here are only minor fusions. I was up on a tree for better odds of impact, and now I have to hydrate greatly and get an outdoors permit to let my head consume proper sunlight.&quot; Heather continues, &quot;Yeah, as Holly was out doing plant stuff, I was all prepared for the fusion. But I completely forgot to feed my piranhas in their tank and tried making a quick run to feed them. I wasn&#39;t fast enough, and now I have to get a carnivore diet for my dental support.&quot; &quot;Oh wow,&quot; Barbara reacts to their stories, &quot;I didn&#39;t get anything at all, but I already had a couple of helium tanks to achieve my floating state.&quot; The three girls would form a small talk about themselves, their background, and their week coming up to the full check.<br />
<br />
The vehicle would make its full stop, and Barbara would slowly float back to the rope&#39;s origin. The man from earlier would open up the doors again, and Holly and Heather would get off. But as he got to help out Barbara, the man says, &quot;You are recommended to be held by this rope during your visit here.&quot; And so, the man unties the rope holding onto the hook and drags Barbara tied up in the air into a small room with other fused people, including the two girls from earlier. After being tied to one of the chair arms, Barbara would see a nurse bring in people one by one, but a different nurse would come up to untie and grab her rope, and pull her in a room shortly after the third person she saw go in. Being put in a room with a lying chair, Barbara would be unleashed by the nurse and be told to stay afloat in here. At this point, Barbara&#39;s toes were barely grazing the floor standing up, but she put her purse down and lay just above the chair, waiting for the full check to start.<br />
<br />
After some time, Barbara sees two men, one in a full doctor&#39;s coat and one in a fancy vest and proper clothes, coming in with the nurse who pulled her in. &quot;Hello, Barbara!&quot; the man with the coat starts, &quot;My name is Dr. Jack Bromes, and this is biologist Greg McGraw.&quot; After Greg&#39;s greeting, Jack continues, &quot;So Barbara, may I ask you how much you know about your fusion?&quot; &quot;I only know that I am a perfect fusion with a balloon,&quot; Barbara answers truthfully. Greg questions her, &quot;And do you know what that means for you?&quot; After a head shake, Greg starts to educate Barbara, &quot;So there are different states of fusion. From minor to severe, organic and inorganic forms are mixed and made to be fused, with no certainty of anything beyond any of their functions and service to life. But a perfect fusion is the point where it is not only guaranteed both proper function and service for all involved forms but achieved even above the forms standards. As a result, perfect fusions are in themselves an entirely different species from their original counterparts, having new or altered functions and purposes of their life. As you lay there, floating above your seat, your body is now fused and built to be in this state of being as light as a balloon, potentially as a defense mechanism or a new meaning for your survival.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Barbara would absorb all that the biologist had to give to her with her being a perfect fusion, Dr. Bromes would take back the handle and prepare for some work. &quot;Now Barbara, before we get started for your full check, we are gonna need to make an updated record of your weight and height. Is there a way we could make you deflated?&quot; Barbara didn&#39;t have the chopstick she would use to loosen her knot, but she told Dr. Bromes about her tactic to unknot her balloon lip. Dr. Bromes told the nurse off to get some chopsticks, and they went off. After a minute, they came back with a metal pair, and Dr. Bromes shoved it under the balloon knot as Barbara told, making her immediately lose what little gravity she dominated and turn her back to being deflated. Now being fully on the floor, Barbara would be taken to a stadiometer out in the hallway, and have the nurse record her height. &quot;Okay so five-foot-nine, no change in height.&quot; Barbara was feeling neutral about that now, it didn&#39;t bother her as it did back at her check-up. Now being taken back to her room, Barbara would stand on the weight stand, and look even more confused as it went even lower than the check-up. &quot;And ninety-five pounds, making it a negative thirty from the check-up.&quot; Barbara could only be in shock, last time she lost fifty pounds, now she has lost an additional thirty. It was a moment of pause to her, but Dr. Bromes would bring Barbara back, &quot;Alright Barbara, now we shall start doing some exploration with your fusion.&quot;</p>
