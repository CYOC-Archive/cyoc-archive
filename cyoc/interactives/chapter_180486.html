<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cute blonde Krissi was a mess. Moments ago so had been forced to deal with her boyfriend spontaneously turning into a big mosquito. She had held him in her arms as he was seemingly shrinking away into a full insect. And now, he was so big that any more growth might destroy the basement.<br />
<br />
Oh God, if her parents came home right now...<br />
<br />
The audible stretching picked up again, and Krissi braced herself for the worst. It never came, though. Something else entirely strange began to happen. As Krissi watched the surreal display of a struggling giant mosquito, suddenly Dustin began to shrink down again, but he wasn&#39;t staying a blood sucker. To her joint confusion and fresh terror, her boyfriend was contorting into something entirely different. His legs began to thicken, another set began to emerge behind him. His wings shrank, his abdomen seemingly began to pulsate and grow in size, and his long snout began to shrink down, his antennae turning into two wicked pincers. He seemed to be getting heavier, his form was bulking up and gaining back size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God!&quot; Krissi stared in realizing horror. &quot;Oh fuck, no!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin stretched, crackled, hardened, grew, filled out, and rapidly altered, still shrinking all the while. His legs grew huge and spindly. His head seemed to round and enlarge, eyes seperating into an array on the front of his head. He gurgled sickeningly, dripping acid saliva into the carpet and sizzling portions of it away, he prickled and grew long dark and brown hairs over his entire body and very suddenly he jolted and stopped.<br />
<br />
Krissi stared at a literal nightmare vision of an uncanny giant eight foot tall wolf spider. Dustin turned, head following Krissi, and he raised his front leg up to examine himself with one of his other eyes.<br />
<br />
He caught his reflection in an old bathroom mirror that had yet to be thrown away under the stairs, and he seemed fascinated by it. He turned to get a better look, shaking his body, flexing his eight legs, raising up and down carefully, and seemed to consider his new body. He turned back to Krissi, who was in a state of shocked disbelief, and waved her forward gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You&#39;re not gonna... gonna fucking eat me, are ya big guy?&quot; She stammered, carefully stepping forward, if reluctantly.<br />
<br />
Dustin approximated a belly laugh, shaking his head, and mimiced touching his hairy spider leg.<br />
<br />
Krissi approached him, suddenly curious, and stared up at his unreadable alien face for a moment. She reached forward gently, hesitantly, and rubbed his hairy leg. She went pale, giggling nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is some shit, huh?&quot; Krissi laughed.<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded his agreement and was almost about to try and say something else, but quite suddenly he jolted again. Another shrinkage. He staggered slightly as he reduced to knee height of the human girl and now found himself staring up his girlfriend. She kneeled down, startled, and with a slight bemused grin she began to stroke his back. The spider let her happily, leaning under her hand as she rubbed his needle hairs. He twitched, throwing his abdomen up, and almost wagged it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we just have to ride this fuckiness out, huh?&quot; Krissi gulped. &quot;God, what else do we do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded his agreement, delighting as Krissi&#39;s fingertip strokes calmed him down, and felt another twinge.<br />
<br />
The spider began to warp again. Krissi gasped and stepped back, climbing onto the couch once more and putting her hand over her mouth.<br />
<br />
Now, Dustin was becoming something entirely different. His abdomen pulled over his back, it began to turn into a big brown shell. Krissi stared with mortified fascination as her boyfriend now softened. He turned snakelike, longer, with almost reptilian texture to his skin. Or... like... a diamond skin pattern. He began to turn to a sickening beige, two of his eyes began to extend from his face, his pincers shrank away, all of his legs were now dwindling too. For a moment, he looked like he was melting.<br />
<br />
Krissi gasped again. Dustin had become a rather typical dog sized snail. He raised his dangling &#39;head&#39; up and turned his eyestalks backward, startled. He snapped them back to the front and turned his head, visibly reeling as he saw what he had become. His strange fleshy sides undulated as he tried to move and he slithered forward, watching as he trailed slime behind him. He circled the carpet in fascination, watching himself move in a circle slowly, and turned his head back to Krissi. She could make out the absolutely weird opening of his mouth, the black centers of his long eyestalks, the totally inhuman and boneless anatomy of his body, the texture of his flesh, and the rugged pink of his underbelly.<br />
<br />
Dustin, too, looked himself over as Krissi got down on the floor with him. With a trembling hand, she touched the top of his head with her palm and giggled a gross girly &quot;ewww&quot; as she pulled her palm away with a trail of slime attached to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re disgusting!&quot; Krissi giggled, rubbing her hand off on Dustin&#39;s shell.<br />
<br />
The snail was actually big enough to register facial expressions. He cocked his shapeless head to the side and drew his eyestalks in slightly. Annoyed?<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you didn&#39;t pick this.&quot; Krissi shrugged.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, though, the snail shook and seemed to vibrate, raising his head and neck up past his hard brown shell as he began to blow up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit, oh shit!&quot; Krissi cried, scrambling back up onto the couch. Dustin grew forward again, stretching noisily, and surged up into a larger and larger gastropod. When he was done, Krissi was staring in shock as a snail that stood as tall as a human being.<br />
<br />
Dustin&#39;s spiked mouth parts emerged and he made a high pitched hum.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said it, D.&quot; Krissi&#39;s eyes were wide. She watched the giant sized snail turn slowly and looked over himself. His eyestalks raised in alarm and he slithered toward Krissi, undulating, slick under his slime trail.<br />
<br />
To Krissi&#39;s horror, she found herself face to face with Dustin&#39;s giant face. He glistened under the fading light.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, for a car sized invertebrate, you&#39;re kind of cute like this. I... I bet we won&#39;t have to use lube anymore, huh big guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin visibly blushed under his eyes, the area flushing, and Dustin&#39;s eyes atop his eyestalks suddenly widened slightly in surprise. He angled them down toward the middle of his head and was greeted by something pink emerging from between his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; Krissi gasped. She put her hands over her mouth and went deep red as the snail sprouted a boner. It was the weirdest penis she had ever seen, but it was definitely a big hard dick, growing out from his head and filling up to full.<br />
<br />
Dustin looked away in shame, turning his head away towards his shell to hide the still hardening dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey!&quot; Krissi consoled him, reaching out a touching his slick slimy hide. &quot;It&#39;s okay, D! At... at least you&#39;ve still got a cock, right? I mean, it&#39;s still *your* cock. You&#39;re still big and manly. That has to feel good, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin shot his head back to Krissi, startled, and shook his head from side to side. His stiff penis was at full mast, over two feet long, and wiggled between his eyes. The strange bulbous tip seemed to swell a little fuller.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean no?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin seemed to sigh in exasperation, and turned his head down beneath his shell. He raised his &#39;skirt&#39; slightly and pushed his giant mass off the basement carpet. Krissi gasped in realization as he showed her a very feminine very distinct opening tucked tight under his bulky ribbed underside.<br />
<br />
&quot;C-Can you fuck yourself?&quot; Krissi lit up, ever the kinky bitch.<br />
<br />
Dustin was startled and looked back at her with wide beady eyes. He narrowed them slightly, and seemed to shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try it! You&#39;ve got a hard dick, a slimy body, and a pussy. Might as well enjoy yourself. Maybe it&#39;ll change you back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Startled his Krissi&#39;s insistance, Dustin pulled up his skirt again and lowered his head. He stared at Krissi, falling onto his side a little, and watched her with twisted eyestalks as he carefully and gently positioned his penis tip at his own pussy opening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do it!&quot; Krissi encouraged.<br />
<br />
Dustin the snail penetrated his own vagina and visibly trembled, his huge slimy bulk tensing, tail pulling around his head more naturally to allow access. He began sliding his member in and out, his slit mouth pulling into an obvious &quot;O&quot; as a strangely alluring musky scent began to fill the air.<br />
<br />
Krissi laughed hysterically and watched with delighted arousal as a giant snail that was formerly her jerkass boyfriend literally fucked himself in front of her. It was too weird and surreal not to enjoy.<br />
<br />
Dustin began thrusting faster and more confidently, his big snail dick hitting his snail pussy in all the right ways, and he began frantically pumping himself, pushing his dick in to the soft fleshy base of his head. He jolted, his eyestalks shrank back into his head, and he kept going. His skirt undulated wildly, he tensed... he was sweating slime... his eyes clenched tightly. He audibly moaned. A high pitched mmmmmm. He drew his head back, and Krissi was startled to see Dustin&#39;s cock dragging half limp and dribbling cum from the tip. She looked down to his slit and saw it was nicely creamed, pouring his oddly thick seed.<br />
<br />
The snail turned back to Krissi lazily, his eyestalks reemerging, and even though his face was expressionless she saw the deviant pleasure in his black glassy eyes. She smiled wide as Dustin jolted, raising his neck back in shock, as Krissi sat on the couch with her legs spread, knees up, pants off, her wet pussy visible for the snail to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got some for me, snail boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin blushed deep red on top of his head again, his mouth falling relaxed, and he nodded enthusiatically. To Krissi&#39;s delight, his limp cock began to pump back up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and so soon after getting down with yourself!&quot; She grinned with delight. &quot;God damn! Such a virile slimy boyfriend!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin blushed deeper and lowered his head almost perfectly horizontal. Krissi grinned and gave his eyestalks a pet. He was... damp. She reached down and gave his huge gastropod dick a stroke. At his current size, it was almost as long as her entire arm. It twitched from her touch and the giant snail moaned again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya like that, you big jerk?&quot; Krissi giggled, grabbing the shift in her fingers and pulling them tight around it. She jerked up and down, the naturally slippery shaft throbbing thicker under her grip, and released a fleshy full sized cock, the tip nearly as big as a pear and just as close in shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okaaay.&quot; She licked her lips. &quot;Let&#39;s try it, big boy. Come on, before you change again. Hurry!&quot;<br />
<br />
The snail pushed forward, his eyes watching intently from his twisted stalks, and he carefully pressed the tip against Krissi&#39;s waiting snatch. She mmmphed a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Slow! Slooooow!&quot; She urged, gasping, as she gripped his swollen tip and guided him forward. The giant snail pushed his muscled body foward a little, wriggled his tail excitedly, slapping it on the basement floor with a wet smack, and very gently pressed forward.<br />
<br />
Krissi took the tip in and bucked. &quot;Ooohh fuuuck!&quot; She gasped. &quot;Okay, give me a sec... oh shit... you&#39;re... you&#39;re BIG!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the snail jolted and reduced a little, pulling back from Krissi as he shrank suddenly. She gasped as the warmth of her gastropod lover left her. Frustrated, needy, Dustin ignored his shrinkage and slithered forward back into position. His eyes looked back to Krissi and she nodded. &quot;Oh, hurry! Come on! Before you get smaller or... or... change into a fucking centipede or something!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded, determined, and carefulyl slid his member back to Krissi. She guided him, now much more manageable, and smiled in utter sexual perversion as the still massive snail slipped his meat into her. He was still HUGE compared to a human being, and as he slipped halfway into Krissi she jumped as he hit her cervix.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit! Your pipe is too long. Back out! Fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded, forgetting his dick was attached to his head, and nearly lifted Krissi off the couch. She went pale and moaned. &quot;Careful, slime head!&quot;<br />
<br />
He shrank into himself sheepishly and then raised his eyestalks over Krissi&#39;s head. He started thrusting gently, undulating back and forth. As he built up a rythym the human actually found herself enjoying this whole bizarre situation. She grabbed hold of Dustin&#39;s eyestalks, which weren&#39;t nearly as slimy as the rest of him, and urged him on, bucking into his huge snail shaft and starting to cry out. Together, a giant snail and his human girlfriend banged in the basement. They had done it many times before as the same species. This was surreal and weird, which seemed to excite Krissi more than usual. Very soon she was throwing her head back and whimpering.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-Finish us, you big slimy bastard! Come on!&quot;<br />
<br />
The snail gurgled excitedly and drove them home. He thrusted madly, his dick swelling puffier, and then...<br />
<br />
Krissi came just as Dustin began to shrink down again. She felt him slip free of her and panted as she opened her eyes, filled with alien jizz was trailed from one hole to another. She fingered it, startled at how thick and viscous it was, and looked down over the couch to see a heavily breathing Dustin shrinking down on the carpet, approaching his &#39;proper&#39; size as he reduced to the scale of a coin. Once his mind cleared, he looked around again, his dick pulling back into his now tiny head. A shadow loomed over top of him and Krissi giggled as she got off the couch and got down on her hands and knees to look down on her now tiny snail lover.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, little guy!&quot; She beamed, watching the snail look up at her and cringe. &quot;You did great!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin the snail wagged happily and made Krissi giggle. &quot;Hopefully it was good for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He bobbed his head happily and swayed from side to side, slithering over the carpet and forming a heart shape with his own body&#39;s mucus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. You&#39;re obviously not done cha-&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin suddenly trembled again and shot up, Krissi squeeling and grabbing hold of a giant snail shell that was suddenly supporting her body. Dustin jolted, even more massive than before, and looked back to see his half naked girlfriend holding onto his shell for dear life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa.&quot; She said simply, blinking.<br />
<br />
Dustin nudged her face with the gooey end of his &#39;snout&#39; and she gave him a sick look as he pulled away and left her face covered in thick slime.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, buddy.&quot; She said sarcastically, wiping the goo off her face with her shirt, and giggled again.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... I guess we wait again.&quot; She sighed.<br />
<br />
The snail nodded and relaxed, splaying out and curling into himself. Krissi couldn&#39;t sit up on his shell, she was too close to the roof, and slid down the back of his tail instead, coating all of her lower body in snail slime on the way down and emerging soggy and blushing behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what? This isn&#39;t that great after all. Hopefully you change into something less icky soon.&quot; She kicked off some of the slime and made a sick face again.</p>
