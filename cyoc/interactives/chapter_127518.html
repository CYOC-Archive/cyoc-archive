<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The following day, Katie told Lisa what happened with Kellie and she was still depressed about it, but even with her mom&#39;s encouraging words, she still felt more depressed than she had felt in a long time. When school resumed the following week, Mika found that most of her school friends were apologizing for what they had done and some had become slowly accepting of her and Claudia. Though while Claudia, Mika, Samantha, and Mary Elise were having a good week, Kellie and Katie were not. The two of them barely talked to each other but talked to the rest of their friends more and while their friends tried getting them back together, nothing it seemed was working until lunch on Friday happened and Katie and Kellie got notes it seemed from the other and met at a lunch table together.<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie now sat across from the table not saying anything and they were both trying to come up with something to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....what did you want to talk about?&quot; Katie asked Kellie.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did I want to talk about? You sent a note to me, you wanted to talk with me.&quot; Kellie replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, the girls did this. They want us to try and make up.&quot; Katie realized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, don&#39;t you want to make up?&quot; Kellie asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do, but only because you want to make up not because somebody else is forcing us to make up.&quot; Katie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then tell me you want to make up.&quot; Kellie insisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do, but not if it&#39;s like this. I want us to do it on our own terms.&quot; Katie argued<br />
<br />
&quot;Then say it.&quot; Kellie argued back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, for the love of god will you two just kiss and make up already!&quot; A female voice shouted to them.<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie looked to where the voice had come from and spotted two girls nearby that they recognized but thought couldn&#39;t be possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, you should probably just come out now, because we saw you.&quot; Kellie insisted.<br />
<br />
Both girls were surprised by now of all people in the school to actually show up, it wasn&#39;t their friends and it wasn&#39;t one of their parents, it was Ashley and Jennifer, the two girls who had bullied them the most were now actually trying to help them get back together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay first: what is this? is this some kind of cheap prank or some kind of revenge scheme you two have for us?&quot; Katie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Jennifer answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well is it to make us more miserable than I have been all week? Because it certainly feel like it.&quot; Kellie asked them.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO, DAMN IT, IT&#39;S NOT!&quot; Ashley shouted to them.<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie were now quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;After....after Claudia&#39;s father gave us a stern talking to, we started thinking about our lives and then we started thinking about your lives.&quot; Jennifer explained to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We then began to realize that the reason we were bullying you, wasn&#39;t because we hate what you are, it&#39;s because we what what you have or had as it seems.&quot; Ashley tells them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, are you saying you were jealous of me and Katie being an item?&quot; Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we just began realizing we were jealous of you two because you two were always so close and trusting with one another and you&#39;ve stuck by each other no matter what shitty thing we may do or say to try and hurt you.&quot; Jennifer said to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you can imagine to our surprise as well as your friends surprise that you two weren&#39;t speaking with one another. So, Jennifer and I decided to set up this little arrangement to get you guys to work out your differences with one another and get back together because....because I think what you have is something Jennifer and I have never quite really gotten from our parents: time and actual love.&quot; Ashley explained to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah and if I felt the way you two felt about one another, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to be split from the other. I mean the only person I&#39;ve ever really felt close to is Ashley. I can always count on her to back me up, to be on my side, to be there cry on her shoulder....I love you Ashley.&quot; Jennifer said with tears in building in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too Jen.&quot; Ashley said hugging her best friend.<br />
<br />
Both girls wiped tears away from their eyes and looked back at Katie and Kellie.<br />
<br />
&quot;So listen, now that we&#39;re here we also want to try a fresh start with you two. To try and actually be friends, it&#39;ll be a slow process but I hope we can work it out. If you can forgive us, I&#39;m sure you two can forgive each other.&quot; Ashley said to them.<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie had sat there in complete silence listening to them until Kellie finally spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....o....okay.....uh.....could you give us a moment then?&quot; Kellie asked them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, take all the time you like, we&#39;ll be over here...far over here.&quot; Jennifer said as the two walked away from Katie and Kellie.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....that happened.&quot; Katie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it did. The most unexpected thing I never expected to happen, happened.&quot; Kellie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It did. Listen, I&#39;m sorry that I frightened you, I never meant to scare you. All I ever wanted to do for anyone with that...thing was help people and I admit when someone has that kind of power in their hand, they can get carried away with it.&quot; Katie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah and I missed talking to you, like really talking to you. I just missed being with you all week.&quot; Kellie admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hardest week of my life. I didn&#39;t even think or touch that...thing. All I thought about was you. I really did miss you.&quot; Katie wholeheartedly admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I did too.&quot; Kellie agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....does this mean our break is over?&quot; Katie asked as she leaned in toward Kellie.<br />
<br />
Kellie leaned over and kissed Katie on the lips, which Katie returned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take that as a yes.&quot; Katie said as the two of them got up and  began to walk away.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, do you want to use that thing later?&quot; Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually I barely missed it at all, but what do you say to dinner and a movie tonight? my treat?&quot; Katie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;On your allowance?&quot; Kellie giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it still pays pretty well.&quot; Katie laughed as the two walked off together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what about us?&quot; Ashley asked as the girls continued walking away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Ash, thanks Jen! We owe you!&quot; Kellie shouted to the girls as they left the lunchroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, did I really just say that?&quot; Kellie asked Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did and I can&#39;t believe it either.&quot; Katie said holding Kellie&#39;s hand.</p>
