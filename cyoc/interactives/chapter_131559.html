<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Introducing Jen to Animalia&#39;s &quot;megafauna&quot; proved to be harder than planned. Mostly because &quot;megafauna&quot; would allow for only a limited number of possibilities. Among Animalians based on modern Animals, the only ones that would fit the size qualifications would be the African and Asian Elephants, the White and Black Rhinoceros, and the Hippopotamus, all of which had had members that were part of the Lyre Zoo before the initial outbreak. However, there was only about twenty of these in total and that included those humans that had converted willingly after the outbreak. The rest were either Animalians based off of Cenozoic Mammals or Mesozoic reptiles, primarily the Dinotopians. <br />
<br />
There were plenty of them as Manfred had become a Wooly Mammoth and Martha&#39;s parents had become Giant Ground Sloths, Megatherium. However in their specific cases there were other issues limited access to them. Manfred was frequently working for Animalia in shoveling sidewalks and helping with the plowing of roads, which helped given the lengthy winter that hung over them. It made his schedule difficult to work with as Judy knew that she couldn&#39;t expect Manfred to drop everything to converse with someone who wanted to become an Animalian at the drop of a hat. And Martha&#39;s parents, Sidney and Brooke, didn&#39;t even live in Animalia or Lyre. They&#39;d become Animalians, yes, and became Cenozoic megafauna based Animalians, but they returned to their home town, and from what Judy managed to hear through the proverbial grapevine they were accepted and were doing well, though they were excited to hear that Martha was now pregnant.<br />
<br />
There were more Dinotopians though, and Andrew was rather easy to get in touch with, as the Meat Market was pretty easy to get in touch with. The fact that &quot;Jen&quot; seemed to know English fairly well also made things fairly easy for her. It took a little bit, but she did manage to get in contact with Andrew, who made his way to Horizon, ducking his neck down a bit as he made his way through the main hallways as he walked, which was to greater degree than even the Giraffe Animalians, which as a Sauropod Dinotopian made sense. After all, Sauropods were the largest land animals to ever live. Brachiosaurus might not be the largest Sauropod but it was still big and Horizon wasn&#39;t built for Animalian&#39;s of a giraffe&#39;s height, let alone a Brachiosaurus&#39;s height.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Ms. Judy,&quot; Andrew spoke politely with a small smile, &quot;You called to invite me to talk to someone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Judy nodded, &quot;We have a young Japanese woman who has a rather unique condition and wants to join Animalia to treat that condition as part of Project Phoenix.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She wishes to be a dinosaur, I take it?&quot; Andrew wondered, sounding very curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually she wants to be something that is strong and potentially big,&quot; Judy answered, &quot;largely a result of her condition... though she wishes that the species is not bovine... which you will be aware of.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew nodded and then followed Judy into Judy&#39;s office. It wasn&#39;t unlike what he would have expected from a scientist, though the slim Japanese woman with gigantic breasts seated in a wheelchair was not what he expected. Her body was rather slim and was almost devoid of muscle. Yet, she had huge breasts that were especially massive on her small and slim body. Andrew was fairly familiar with seeing women with large breasts, particularly after joining Animalia, as the smallest cup size on an adult Animalian was a D cup, and that wasn&#39;t exactly small by any means.  The young woman appeared to have left even most Animalians well behind in terms of her cup size and with her slim frame, she couldn&#39;t carry the weights she carried on her chest. He also thought it pained her as her hands rested top of them and was almost as if she were hiding behind the dress she wore to cover her mummeries.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll leave you two alone for a few moments,&quot; Judy spoke and walked around Andrew to go back out.<br />
<br />
Andrew nodded and then looked back to Jen who looked up to him with a bit of amazement that balanced with what pain she had feel as a result of the weight she was carrying.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re one of the Dinotopians!&quot; she said with her eyes wide and her mouth hanging open for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, presently the tallest in Animalia,&quot; Andrew smiled, &quot;I&#39;m a Brachiosaurus. You may call me Andrew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen,&quot; Jen answered in English, &quot;Well... in English... it should be Jin, but I&#39;ve had enough Americans pronounce my name Jen that it&#39;s not worth fighting over. Besides... I have BIGGER concerns than my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew gave a cringing smile and scratched the back of his shoulders for a moment with one arm, wrapping around the front of his own chest. He didn&#39;t want to be rude, as this woman was clearly struggling with the weight on her chest. Eventually she took away his need to worry about what to say by speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can go ahead and say it... I&#39;m a misshapen freak, too much breast and nowhere near enough muscle,&quot; Jen sighed and looked down, &quot;It&#39;s pretty much immobilized me. I can stand... but only for short periods and I easily feel the strain. It&#39;s easier for me to sit... but with these things even that is difficult.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May I ask...?&quot; Andrew slowly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A P cup... I won&#39;t get into the band and bust measurements, as that&#39;s all in the metric system, but the CUP size is P,&quot; Jen answered, &quot;So... big... and dense. I can&#39;t move with these things and that&#39;s why I want to join Animalia. I&#39;ve seen things that would indicate that Animalians ARE stronger...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Animalians are stronger, yes,&quot; Andrew spoke in warning, &quot;but I can&#39;t say for certain as to whether or not your chest will get smaller. A good many parts of me got considerably BIGGER when I changed... and I&#39;m not talking about my arms or my neck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Jen managed a shrug, &quot;Animalia is more open and honest with things like sex and so on... it&#39;s on all your web pages and info books... though there is a lot of info on Animalians being driven more for true love than purely for sex...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably a result of all Animalians being built to be sexually desirable,&quot; Andrew shrugged, &quot;If everyone is sexy and proportionately built along the same general form, just to different scales... it&#39;d be hard to really with the sort of differences that are often used make that definition on what is sexy... Maybe that leads to more being willing to listen and support others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew wasn&#39;t a sociologist by any means, and for all intents and purposes he&#39;d had a lot of fun working for the Meat Market, especially while there was still a lot of debate over the various offers over where the Dinotopian colony would be, or if there would be one or two colonies. He&#39;d heard one rumor that the Texas site would be set up for the dinosaurs and pterosaurs while the Caribbean island site would be for the various marine reptiles and pterosaurs. Though, so long as buildings were built to better fit him, he didn&#39;t mind. However there were times when there was a sort of emptiness...<br />
<br />
He watched Animalia Ambassadoria as often as he could. He noticed that they tried to pair off as often as they could. Abby with Samson, Sophie with Roland, Sarah with Travis, Malice with Simon, and Jessica with Roger, and he could see that they loved each other and carried themselves as happily married couples. Even Sophie and Roland, who were for the moment still human, seemed to have that great level of devotion to each other. He could see it even the other Dinotopians. Jeremy and Heather might not ever have much interest in the Meat Market, but they were fiercely devoted to each other, and in a way, Tyra and Rex had forged a similar bond. For the latter pair, there might be some genetic issues, as the Syntixisaurus Rex was a hybrid Theropod, and while Andrew didn&#39;t pretend to know much about genetics, he did know from Tyra that Rex had some testing projects running to identify the specific genetic markers, which would likely have something to do with breeding rights. And that was a big thing across Animalia, and that was something that Tyra talked to him about with regard to Rex... and that if they couldn&#39;t breed under Animalia&#39;s edicts, they&#39;d have to adopt. It was something that he could see real love there... and they weren&#39;t the only ones.<br />
<br />
He was fairly certain that Luke and Marjorie wanted to get married, and only hadn&#39;t because the two Diplodocus Sauropods were willing to wait until they had the room to live comfortably. He&#39;d seen Annie and Ralph together with their son, and they looked happy together, and he&#39;d heard that Annie was pregnant with at least three eggs, but that was just a rumor. All the same, he saw Animalians in love and happy together, which made him realize he didn&#39;t have that. Nessie was fun, but their relationship was more a &quot;friendship with benefits&quot; sort of thing. It wasn&#39;t hatred or anything negative, but neither was it true love that was on par with what he saw with others, and Andrew had the sense that he wanted that. To have someone he could hold gently, tell her about his day, and promise her the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Jen answered, &quot;Your news hasn&#39;t reported any Animalian divorces... though my issue is to gain the strength to live with these things... finding love is a secondary issue...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone deserves to be loved,&quot; Andrew found himself telling her, &quot;and from what you&#39;ve said to me... I think you deserve your own happy ever after even more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get me on my feet before we go THAT far,&quot; Jen sighed.<br />
<br />
Andrew nodded and then lowered his head, giving a tighter curve in his neck so that he could scratch his chin with the one over-sized claw/hoof that Sauropods had on their front feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could go with a Sauropod species,&quot; Andrew offered, &quot;that&#39;d definitely give you the strength...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How many are there?&quot; Jen wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just me and two others, though they&#39;re Diplodocus,&quot; Andrew answered, &quot;though the female... her chest is about the same cup size as yours... maybe a bit smaller, but proportionately speaking... not by much. She and her love do a lot of exercise videos and drum up support for sports in Animalia, things like basketball and volleyball and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do YOU do?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... uhh...&quot; Andrew found himself blushing with scales darkening a bit, which Jen found rather intriguing. This big male Dinotopian being embarrassed and humbled by her? He had more muscle in one hand than she had in her whole body. &quot;Well, you see there is this club called the Meat Market. And since Animalians tend to have a higher libido that normal humans... we sort of use it as a strip club...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re a male stripper I take it?&quot; Jen actually giggled at his shyness at saying this, &quot;as big and buff as you are... I&#39;m sure the women go mad for you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Many do,&quot; Andrew nodded, &quot;Though... that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;d be opposed to finding a special someone and being with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded. Eventually Andrew cleared his throat and continued, &quot;Anyway. The big thing would be with your strength. Sauropods were big animals and big EVERYWHERE. So... while your breasts may not get much smaller or proportionately much smaller, you probably would gain the muscle mass to let you out of that wheelchair. Brachiosaurus... especially.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And later that evening as she rested at the hot springs with Andrew on one side and Marjorie and Luke on the other and Tyra seated across from her, Jen found herself quite welcome. And when she looked to Andrew, she could swear she saw a soft twinkle in his eye that seemed to indicate that he quite the catch for more than just his reputation in bed. In that, Jen figured that even if things didn&#39;t work out long term with her and Andrew, she&#39;d at least have a good friend.</p>
