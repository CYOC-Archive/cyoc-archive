<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And here they were again. Heading back into the locker rooms after a long, heavy workout, Alex feeling more fit than ever and yet, still smaller and less developed than Chad. He could almost perceive the water on his shoulders, feel Chad&#39;s lips around his manhood. Alex stood there in front of the mirror, blushing and thinking about what was to come. Chad suddenly walked up behind him and, with a mischievous smile, lightly smacked Alex&#39;s booty. The older man gasped aloud and felt his manhood jerk.<br />
<br />
&quot;You fantasizing? Why subsist on fantasy when you can have reality?&quot; Chad asked as he started to remove his clothes, starting of course with his top. Bouncing his pecs and flexing his prominent roid gut, Chad was very much the pinnacle of masculinity as far as Alex knew it. He couldn&#39;t help himself. Oh he looked forward to this. Then the shorts and boxers came off, and Alex watched Chad&#39;s eight incher come out - though it seemed his balls weren&#39;t quite as impressive as his cock - it seemed there were side effects to the gym candy, after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;So? You like?&quot; Chad asked, flexing his biceps and then moving into showing off his broad, powerful lats. <br />
<br />
Alex removed his shirt, &quot;That I do.&quot; Alex found himself staring just as well at his own build for a moment in the mirror. It couldn&#39;t just be a pump. He looked incredibly fit, examining himself like this. His chest protruded a bit more, his biceps looked more rounded and with a deal more shape, his triceps had better form on all heads, and even his shoulders looked broader and rounder. Yes, there was no question of it - he was actively getting stronger and more muscular at an odd rate. He looked like a well built man in his mid forties by now!<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck...&quot; Alex murmured. His hands scooping down and pushing off his gym shorts and tighty-whities. Leaving Alex standing there stark naked before long. A built older man standing next to his trainer and occasional fling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree, let&#39;s get to it.&quot; Chad responded, and then wrapped an arm around Alex&#39;s shoulders, leading him into the showers. He almost came straight away as he heard the showers be turned on by Chad, his memories of that night playing back stronger than ever. His shoulders tensed and his chest twitched. Looking around, Alex realized they had no guests - no one to interrupt or engage in voyeurism with him and Chad.<br />
<br />
Alex pressed himself up against the wall, feeling the familiar sensation of his shoulders being drenched by the shower. Chad started working him up, jerking Alex off one handed while lightly kissing at his lips. &quot;You&#39;re pretty worked up today, Mr. Clark. We gotta get some of that stress off your shoulders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh...&quot; Alex moaned and pumped his hips into Chad&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ready for a BJ?&quot; Chad asked, looking deviously at the professor and then down at his oozing cockhead. He never knew his client to be this eagerly excited. It looked like what happened prior had opened him up to this kind of thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeh...Yes! Yes!&quot; Alex eagerly shouted, smashing his lips against Chad&#39;s and pulling him into a passionate kiss, Chad&#39;s blond hair drenched by the shower water as Alex eagerly kissed him. As the two separated, Chad grinned at him and took his hand off of Alex&#39;s tool, and then started kissing down his body. The lightly hairy pecs covered in blond hair, the strong core and midsection, and then further, down right to the manhood that looked stronger and healthier not to mention larger than usual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh...Oh Chad, fuck, fuck, I need this. I&#39;ve needed this since uh, since the last time we did thi---uuurgh...!&quot; Alex was reduced to incoherence as Chad took his tool into his mouth. Alex tried his best to keep his load down, usually he&#39;d have the benefits of age and experience, but with how much he&#39;d been worked up lately, it felt like all that was tossed out. He sweat heavily even with the water on him, feeling his cock twitch and eagerly bob within Chad&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
Fuck this guy was good at this. He was probably a whiz when it came to delighting the women on that fucking app. No applicants male or female would come away unsatisfied...fuuuck yes. <br />
<br />
&quot;You...have got...to teach me this! I got...I gotta date! T-Tomorrow! With this hot woman from thuh...thuh---the app! I need some oral skills!&quot; Alex let his hand rest on Chad&#39;s head, he was getting close. There was no denying himself this. He couldn&#39;t help but chase his desires. Whatever they may be. Fuck, was this what Coach Mason wanted to do with him? Did he even---ohh fuck. Alex couldn&#39;t even contemplate these things any more as he felt it start. He tried to keep his dick from firing off, but there was nothing he could even remotely do to put up a fight past that point earlier.<br />
<br />
Chad eagerly swallowed a surprisingly large load coming from a pair of balls that even as Chad finished grew slightly larger and more vital. He breathed once he cleared his throat and shook his head, &quot;Whew! Damn! You&#39;re in good condition today, Mr. Clark.&quot; The roided out athlete then remembered what Alex asked him in the middle of it, &quot;You...wanna learn my oral skills? I mean, I don&#39;t brag about that at all, but I&#39;m kind of the best man I know at it. None of my girlfriends and none of my guy-friends go away from a fling with me without an orgasm or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Yes that I do!&quot; Alex didn&#39;t know what form this&#39;d take, but Chad calmly smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let&#39;s see how you do first and foremost. Are you comfortable going down on me?&quot; Chad asked, leaning back into one of the showers. Alex contemplated. He was willing to do anything to make sure he wasn&#39;t an unskilled lover, and considering Darlene was willing to give a potential fuddy-duddy like him a chance he didn&#39;t want to disappoint. So he nodded quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I&#39;m...I&#39;m comfortable.&quot; He looked at Chad&#39;s manhood, briefly apprehensive due to the size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, for one thing, do not think about taking it all in at once.&quot; Chad clarified, &quot;The best oral is done via tongue work and positioning, hitting pleasurable points. So before you get started just keep that in mind. I don&#39;t want you choking on me and thinking you have to deepthroat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, my guy.&quot; Alex responded, and started kneeling down, looking at the large and well formed manhood. He gingerly started moving closer - he didn&#39;t know how applicable lessons from one kind of oral were to another, but experience was experience, he figured. Alex slowly worked his mouth on to Chad, seeing the personal trainer breath out and lean back. Alex started sliding his mouth up and down as far as he could manage it. The taste was...well, it wasn&#39;t ideal. But he could deal - and the more he tried this, the less he minded it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof, almost put in some teeth. Mind those things, dude.&quot; Chad stated, giving him some coaching even in the midst of this.<br />
<br />
Alex kept this in mind and tried to slow it down - knowing that going fast might be preferable, but he couldn&#39;t risk hurting Chad during this. He saw the trainer lightly moaning, eagerly starting to move his hips. At least it felt good for him, that much was clear. Chad pressed a hand against the wall, moaning and then looking down at Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re...doing good so far. Places to improve...mmf, definitely. But doing good. You...wanna continue? I mean, I can think of something else we could...be doing?&quot; Chad said, and Alex removed his mouth from Chad&#39;s piece slowly - man what a bizarre experience. Well, at least it was teaching him something about pleasure he didn&#39;t know already. Alex was actually a bit excited to try out what he learned and extrapolate it as best he could with Darlene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, so,&quot; Chad started, grinning a little bit, &quot;You said you had a date. How about you take me from behind, like you&#39;d take your lovely lady date. And tell me all about her while you fuck my ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That...that sounds like it would be outrageously hot.&quot; Alex almost quivered with excitement. He was already getting hard again, and eagerly started thinking what to say. Chad arrayed himself up in front of Alex, and the professor stated, &quot;You seem pretty excited by this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I am.&quot; Chad grunted as he felt Alex start to push his way in at Chad&#39;s asshole, &quot;Ooh yeah, now let&#39;s hear it!&quot;<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
The two story house that Allison called home was a pretty nice place, with some pretty ornate stairs heading up to the second floor, where her room and some of the storage rooms were. Dylan followed her upstairs with a surprising eagerness. His heart was pounding as he realized what this was. A girl was inviting him over. A girl was inviting him up TO HER ROOM. A pretty girl no less. Allison, one of the prettiest and most popular and smartest girls in school. A would be valedictorian!<br />
<br />
Dylan almost felt himself stirring a bit at the idea that she might be inviting him up for...THAT. But then he quashed the idea. NO. Allison was with Kendall Denning. And Dylan had better behavior than that. He wasn&#39;t gonna make any advances on a girl who had a boyfriend. He was better than that. And besides, she invited him over to talk about the weird goings-on at the school. All the people changing.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t have time for such things as sex right now. Not with him especially.<br />
<br />
As she brought him into her room, Dylan looked around nervously and then took a seat in one of the chairs nearby her computer. A pretty nice little laptop probably put together and worked on by Kendall. Allison started, &quot;Alright, so, let&#39;s see if I can get a full list up.&quot; She started her laptop, sitting right next to Dylan, and the young man gulped.<br />
<br />
He watched her pull up a number of photos from the yearbook. Photos that Dylan now hardly recognized. He gasped, &quot;Holy shit, that used to be---?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Bryan and Wes from history class were not always jock bros.&quot; Allison stated, tapping through some more photos. Vince was probably about fifteen pounds of muscle heavier now than he used to be. Not to mention what went on with him besides. It seemed there was more going on than just outward changes after all. As far as Allison remembered, Bryan and Wes used to be straight. Even though nowadays there was an insistent notion that no, they&#39;d always been this way.<br />
<br />
Dylan cupped his chin, remembering his own classes, and nodded quickly, &quot;Mr. Bryson, my world lit teacher, looked a bit younger and fitter than usual. And he was way more animate about the material we were covering.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Add that to the list...yeah, it looks like...&quot; Allison marked it down, and then considered the grand list. Surprising number of teachers were getting changed, and she wondered how far it was gonna go. Plus what was happening with Kendall. Could something more than just a change into another kind of student be going on there...? And could the glow-up of Ross Jenson be involved somehow... &quot;Well, it&#39;s pretty obvious, Dylan. Our school is getting...changed. On a huge scale. Some people get it more, and faster than others...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan chimed in, &quot;Me personally, I&#39;m happy with what I have. I mean, so if it can stay as it is, that&#39;d be lovely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s another thing,&quot; Allison nodded, &quot;We just don&#39;t know how long these things go on. And what causes the transformation to start, what causes it to stop, and where the end point is for everyone, if there even is a unified end point.&quot; Allison found herself really getting used to Dylan&#39;s presence. He was eager, and so ready to help. He had been enthusiastic about investigation and finding out what was going on - even when it involved himself and what went on.<br />
<br />
As the two went on investigating, relating more stories to one another, the sense of closeness seemed to escalate a little bit.<br />
<br />
When Allison had a difficult time thinking of what in all the changes might bode for Kendall, Dylan put a hand on her shoulder to comfort her. When Dylan worried about how much more he might be different and if at some point his mom and dad might not recognize him, Allison comforted him with a hand on his face. He was pretty remarkable as a guy. Academic. Strong. Wise. Perceptive. And caring. She didn&#39;t even realize it as her hand drifted on to his shirt, feeling one of those meaty, strong pectorals under there.<br />
<br />
She was feeling her libido acting up, she realized. Her face covered in a blush, she found herself closer to Dylan than she ever intended to be. Shy little Dylan Spence was shaking a little, not saying a thing, but she could feel at a cursory move down that he was hard as a rock in his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I don&#39;t...I don&#39;t think...this is really what we intended to---to d-do when we came over here.&quot; Dylan said in a heady whisper. He could feel his need surging, but he was not the type to let it overpower him. He pressed his hand against the desk behind Allison, looking her in the eye, &quot;You---You don&#39;t need to. We&#39;re not...like, a thing. Allison...don&#39;t feel pressured or anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dylan...&quot; Allison murmured. These last few days were so complicated. Maybe...maybe she needed a fling. But...but she was with Kendall. She tried to remind herself. True, but there was something there she knew she needed. In Dylan&#39;s smile, in his care, in how the two of them were two of the only people who knew, and even body-wise, his husky, stocky body was surprisingly appealing. She didn&#39;t usually go for that type. But this was hardly the usual.<br />
<br />
She started moving in...</p>
