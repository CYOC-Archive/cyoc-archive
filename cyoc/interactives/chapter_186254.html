<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When gods get lazy and self-indulgent, they get vulnerable. For too long the Supreme Being of this universe had turned a blind eye to the suffering of the masses across the cosmos. As the earth began to wither from under us, quietly and without warning the Supreme was unseated, usurped, and cast into the abyss by another god, a trickster god who had always played at the margins of other worlds but had never been lucky or talented enough to build his own from scratch like other gods. Until today, that is. Now, this nameless, shapeless child of the void has a cosmos of his own to play with. He chafed at how rigid and formulaic this place was; he would free them all, the New God decided, change everything and build something better and new. And he could sense that he knew just where to start…<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
It was his first day off after a long seven-day week of work, and yet Joseph still woke up earl that morning. It was late summer, and his cluttered bedroom was illuminated by the strong morning light filtering in through the dusty blinds. Joseph rolled over and stretched, remembering how he’d only got home a few hours ago; he and his coworkers had gone on a bit of a bender at the bar after the nights service was over. He was fairly hungover, and he wondered why he was awake when he should be rightfully sleeping well into the afternoon. He turned his head to check the little alarm clock on his bedside table: almost 7:30 a.m. Joseph groaned and sat up in bed, rubbing his hands over his face and feeling the coarse beard growing in over his jaw. His hand drifted down to adjust his substantial morning wood before returning up to scratch his bare chest. He wished his girlfriend was waking up with him right now, they could have had an amazing morning together. But Sharon had been busy herself, pulling an all-nighter at the hospital. She’d probably be getting home soon; he’d better get up and shower, Joseph thought. He could surprise her with breakfast and have each other for brunch. Joseph sighed and swung his long legs over the edge of the bed before letting lose one last yawn and stretching his arms. He was just about to stand up when it happened.<br />
<br />
The whole room lurched violently, sending Joseph forward and onto the carpeted ground as the objects around his room rattled and fell about. Joseph instinctively crawled under his desk as the room shook; books fell off the wall, the windows rattled. He could hear the sounds of crashing and shattering as other objects around the house and outside were tossed about by the quake. All of that paled to the thundering roar that seemed to come out of the earth itself and Joseph’s world shook around him. And then, as suddenly as it had begun, it ceased. Joseph continued to huddle there under his desk, his big hands clasped over the back of his neck in protection. It was not his first earthquake; he’d lived in California all his life. He hadn’t been in an earthquake since he was a child. It would almost be thrilling if he wasn’t slowly realizing all the crap he would now have to clean up. In addition to the possible chaos that awaited outside. He undid his hands and cautiously crept out from under the desk, his eyes scanning the carpet for shards of things. Still naked from sleep, he stood up when a terrible soreness crept over his entire body, as if he had just finished a very intensive workout session. Joseph groaned and staggered over to the bed with his hands clutching his stomach as his legs began to cramp horribly. As he rubbed his hands over his bare skin, Joseph was surprised by the feeling of coarse hair running under his hands, and seemingly a lot of it. His brow furrowed as he looked down at his arms: his smooth skin was dusted in coarse, dark hairs. They had also grown larger and more muscular. His chest muscles had also grown as well, he realized, becoming firm and rounded with a heavy coat of the same coarse hairs that now covered his arms. Joseph couldn’t believe his eyes; he didn’t work out. He was a sous chef who worked twelve-hour days sometimes seven nights a week. A gym routine was the last thing he had time or energy for, not that his days of constant movement and heavy lifting of boxes of this and that didn’t provide a sort of gym routine in and of itself. The powerful muscles of his chest and arms only invited him to look downward and see what else had changed. The hair on his chest led down to a firm and rounded muscle gut; the hair got darkest and thickest around his crotch. Joseph grinned as he took in the sight of his transformed manhood. He was soft from the shock of the quake, but even soft it was substantially larger than his cock used to be while soft. He was also shocked to see that he was no longer circumcised. His fingers delicately touched the skin covering the thick heads of his penis and drew in a sharp breath at how sensitive he was. It was almost ticklish. His other head reached down lower to cup his balls. They had grown to the size of hairy lemons, and they felt heavy in his hands. The stimulation made his cock begin to grow, and so Joseph continued to gently squeeze his balls as his cock slowly grew between his bigger, more muscular legs. The bulbous purple head emerged from his restored foreskin as his cock straightened and thickened. He reached a hand around it to feel its warmth and firmness; it had to be at least nine inches, and girthy. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit,” he said aloud, clearing his throat. His voice was deeper! He gave his enhanced dick a few long strokes with one hand, sighing in pleasure and leaning back against the other. “This is great, but seriously, I hope I’m not dead.” he chuckled. He wanted so bad to jerk off his new tool to the thought of his newly enhanced body. He began to wonder how this could have happened when he remembered the earthquake. Joseph stopped stroking himself and sat up; his cock flopped down over the bed and throbbed between his legs. An earthquake couldn’t have caused this, there was no way. But in this moment of clarity other things began to come to mind like shit! He needs to check the gas line and SHIT! The Restaurant!<br />
<br />
Joseph scrambled out of bed and searched around for his phone, finding it wedged between the wall and his bedside table. He pulled the table back, jumping when it lurched forward immediately and with more force than he had intended, knocking the lamp and the alarm clock to the floor. Great, he thought, another thing to clean up. He grabbed his phone and tried to turn it on, but it was dead. <br />
<br />
“God damn it,” he growled under his breath. He was about to start searching for a charge cord when his eye caught the alarm clock laying on the ground; the LED screen was blank. Joseph frowned and checked the switch on the wall. The alarm clock and the lamp were still plugged in; he flicked the switch on the lamp a few times, but got nothing. “And the power is out.” Joseph let loose and exasperated sigh and tossed the phone onto the bed. The motion jostled his still semi-hard cock and balls against his legs, reminding him that he was still naked. <br />
<br />
Joseph crossed the room to his closet, stepping over fallen books and scattered papers. Everything in the closet seemed to be intact; he dug around through the drawers and extracted a pair of boxers, some socks and a shirt. Joseph first stepped into the underwear, tucking his soft but still large cock behind the cloth as he settled them at his waist. They stretched tightly around his ass and thighs, and his bigger cock and heft balls made for an almost obscene bulge at his crotch. Joseph hadn’t realized how firm and round his ass had become; he didn’t have anything else of a larger size and they weren’t too tight, so he shrugged and went with it. His shirts were a different story. They pulled at his thicker chest hair and made the motion of his arms feel constricted. He settled on one of his flannel shirts, wearing only a tight-fitting tank top underneath. He put on a pair of shorts and stepped away from the closet to find his shoes and whatever disaster awaited him outside his bedroom. <br />
<br />
He followed the hallway out into the living room; the open space was shared by the kitchen on the other side. The kitchen cabinets were open, with many of their contents lying in shattered pieces on the ground. The coffee mugs that he and Shannon had left on the coffee table the night from the morning before had been knocked to the ground. Again, Joseph was grateful for his spartan minimalism. He found his shoes by the front door, but when he tried to put them on he realized that his feet had outgrown them. The socks were a tight enough fit as it was. He returned to the plastic bin by the door where they throw their shoes and managed to dig up a pair of flip-flops. As he was putting them on his eyes lingered on the television. Without any power, he wouldn’t have a way of finding out how bade the damage was. A thought suddenly came to mind and Joseph raced back to his bedroom to retrieve his phone and his keys: he could charge his phone in his car! He needed to call Sharon, and soon. Knowing their luck, she probably got called back in due to the quake, if she was even able to leave before then.<br />
<br />
Joseph left his bedroom and quickly made his way to the front door, unlocking it and stepping outside. It was warm, almost hot, and very quiet. No car alarms or smoke detectors going off, no sounds of sirens from first responders. The street of his neighborhood was still. Joseph scanned his surroundings as he walked out onto the driveway and to his truck. Unlocking the front door he hoisted himself inside, stopping to pull the seat back to make room for his longer legs. He shut the door and dug around the center console until he found his charger. He stuck the key in the ignition to start the car, but the engine failed to turn on. In fact, the dash board didn’t even light up when he switched on the battery. <br />
<br />
“Are you fucking kidding me?” Joseph almost shouted, checking the headlights and the overhead lamp, but they were all switched off; nothing had been left on. “And I got gas two day ago!” his big hands fumbled with the charger until he managed to wedge it into the outlet. He connected his phone in vain; he knew it wasn’t going to work. And sure enough…<br />
<br />
Joseph dropped the phone, letting it tumble down into the footwell as he sat bag in the seat and exhaled. An earthquake could knock out the power, sure, but it couldn’t electronically cripple a car, could it? Joseph’s thoughts were interrupted by a hard knock on the passenger-side window of his truck. He jumped in his seat and looked over to see a man standing outside his car with a desperate, panicked look on his sweaty face. He was wearing blue scrubs, his black hair was unkempt and his eyes were bloodshot. Joseph caught himself noticing the way the man’s scrubs hugged the contours of his muscled chest and narrow waist before he snapped himself out of it.<br />
<br />
The man tried to say something to him through the glass, but Joseph couldn’t make out the words. He pushed the door open and stepped out of the car, keeping himself on the opposite side from the man and peeking around the window. <br />
<br />
“What’s up, man? What’s your problem?” Joseph spat; he’d meant to come off even-toned, but something seemed to surge up from his belly and into his chest, making him feel more aggressive.<br />
<br />
The other man seemed to shrink away from Joseph’s tone for a moment before clearing his throat and speaking again.<br />
<br />
“Please, I,” he stopped when his voice cracked and he cleared his throat again. “I really need you to listen to me.”<br />
<br />
“Are you injured?” Joseph barked.<br />
<br />
The man seemed confused. “No. I…”<br />
<br />
“Are you dying?”<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
<br />
“Well then get the fuck off my driveway.” He said sternly, a part of him wincing at the menace in his deep voice. He slammed the door shut and walked around the front of the car; the man, whom Joseph was just now realizing was shorter and smaller than Joseph was, backed away as he moved towards the front door. <br />
<br />
“Wait! Something insane is happening right now, so please…”<br />
<br />
Joseph sighed and turned around, “I’m not gonna ask you again, dude.” He crossed his big arms over his puffed out chest as if to emphasize what would happen otherwise. <br />
<br />
“Joseph, just cut the macho-man crap and fucking listen to me!” the man shouted back, as if he had just now found his voice.<br />
<br />
Joseph’s arms fell away from his chest. “Do I know you?” he could feel his anger starting to simmer down as he examined the man’s scrubs. “Wait, are you from the hospital? Did Sharon send you?” His eyes widened and he took a few steps towards the man. “Did something happen to her in the quake? Is she alright?” <br />
<br />
The man raised his hands in a defensive gesture and stepped back as Joseph approached him. “Just stop, please,” the man said, his bare cheeks flushing red. “Yes, I know you, and yes, Sharon is alright. But also, no. No, she is not at all alright.” He said in a grim tone.<br />
<br />
Joseph felt himself growing angry again. “What is that supposed to…Where is she? What’s going on?”<br />
<br />
“She’s right here, babe.” The man said in an uncertain tone. “It’s me, but I think you might have to call me ‘Sean’ now or something,” he said with a nervous chuckle.</p>
