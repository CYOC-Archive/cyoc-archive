<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa had climbed into the backseat where she now curled into the fetal position and cried. She was so young and so scared of what happened that curling up was the only thing she could think of. As she looked at the ring she could only sniff.<br />
<br />
What had terrified her the most was the fact that for a moment she had changed things so much that she had become her own nieces little sister. If she hadn&#39;t wished for Katie to remember she feared what may of become of her. As it stood now she had taken the ring off and now just stared at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am never useing that thing again,&quot; she whimpered. Lisa silently cursed under her breath, still shaken by how young and fragile she sounded.<br />
<br />
It had been almost 30 minutes since she had talked with Katie. While she was getting nervous a text she received a few minutes ago put her at ease. Claudia had picked Lisa up and the girls were on there way. Lisa hugged her legs closer to her body. She hated having to ask for help.<br />
<br />
Working up enough courage the young girl peaked out at the road.  Thankfully the lot was still deserted. As she looked out at the street she could see cars pass by. The girls heart seemed to thump out of her chest everytime a car passed by. Lisa wimpered again as she laid down once more drawing herself into the fetal position once more.<br />
<br />
Katie and Claudia pulled onto Exxess Rd. The commuter lot was just down the road and Katie was nervous. She feared that something could possibly happen to her aunt. Lisa had no experience with the ring and had made a bit of a mess. Katie shuddered as she thought of how she originally thought of Lisa as a kid sister and not her aunt. It proved to be difficult toexplain to Claudia as well. <br />
<br />
When Lisa had chamged herself she had changed reality. Claudia remembered Lisa as Katie&#39;s little sister. It took alot of convincing but Katie was finally able to convince her after explaining the effects of the ring. Now the two girls pulled into the parking lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats the car over there,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Okay,&quot; Claudia answered. &quot;You want me to pull up next to it?&quot; Katie nodded and Claudia complied pulling in close by. As the two girls exited the car they gazed at the car.<br />
<br />
The car looked empty, which made Katies heart beat faster. As the two girls stared at the car they noticed a young girl peak up in the back before quickly retreating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god is that her!&quot; Claudia exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Katie nodded as they slowly approached, peaking in the two girls gasped in surprise. A young 11 red head girl was curled up in the back seat. The girl was dressed in overly large clothing. Her shirt sewmed to billow aroumd her while the pants half covered her barefeet. Katie and Claudia were hit with a mixture of pity and sympathy as they looked down at the frightened girl. Taking a deep breath Katie approached the back window.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa its me,&quot; Katie whispered. &quot;You can open the door.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa wiped her eyes and looked up.  &quot;Katie,&quot; the girl cried. Lisa quickly opened the door amd laumched herself at her niece. &quot;I was so scared,&quot; she cried as she hugged her now taller niece.<br />
<br />
Katie hugged her now childiah aunt tightly, ignoring the fact Lisa&#39;s overly large pants had snaked there way down her thin legs. &quot;Its okay I&#39;m here,&quot; she soothed as Lisa sobbed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; Claudia gasped. &quot;This is nuts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked in the car and saw the ring. Taking it in her hand Katie wished that everyone remembered Lisa as her 35 year old aunt. Claudia shook her head as she looked down at the 11 year old Lisa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Ms. O&#39;Toole,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;You were seriously the cutest kid ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa laughed as she thanked Claudia. Turning slightly she now looked up her niece. &quot;Im sorry,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;I never realized just how powerful that ring was.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded as she lovingly wiped the tears from Lisa&#39;s face. &quot;Its okay,&quot; she soothed. &quot;Im just glad your okay. Why dont ee juat head home now okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa nodded as she began to make her way to the drivers seat. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said. &quot;Just make me an adult again so I cam get us home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie grimaced as she rubbed her neck. &quot;I was kind of hoping you would let me drive,&quot; she said. Lisa opened her mouth to protest but quickly closed it. As she looked herself over she sighed. She was 11 right now and a hysterical mess. Even if she grew up again she would still be in an awful state. As she looked over herself she blushed, her pants had fallen away leaving her skinny legs and bareefeet exposed. If she let Katie grow her back up the shirt, which covered her to her knees would rise up exposing her panties. Lisa felt bad enough already without embarassing herself further in front of Katie amd her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; she whispered. &quot;You can drive. Just have Claudia lead the way okay and please be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as Lisa slowly got in the backseat. &quot;Trust me mom I&#39;ll get us home safely,&quot; Katie said. Lisa nodded her head slightly as she stared at the floor. &quot;Oh and dont worry about your date I called Jason. I told him you were sick so he said he would stop by later with some chicken soup.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled and thanked her niece as she wiped her eyes.<br />
<br />
The drive home was uneventful as Claudia kept the speed limit. Katie, who had some drivers ed classes under her belt, impressed Lisa as she navigated the streets and followed the rulse of the road. Lisa couldn&#39;t help but fell a little bit of pride watching Katie. Her niece seemed so mature, eapecially considering you diminshed status. As the girls slowly pulled into the driveway Lisa exited the car and trudged slowly inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks so much Claudia I owe you,&quot; Katie said as she hugged her friend. Claudia smiled as she looked at Katie. &quot;Hey dont mention it,&quot; she smiled. &quot;You and your aunt always treated me so well and beaides it got me out of some chores this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls giggled as they said goodbye, promising to call eachother later once Claudia was done with her chores around the house. As Katie walked into the house she could see Lisa sitting on the kitchen stool.<br />
<br />
The young girl was staring at her narefeet as she slowly squng them baxk and forth. Katie couldn&#39;t help but feel adoration for the young girl. Lisa looked so sad and helpless it made Katie want to hug the young girl. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for helping me Katie,&quot; Lisa said sadly. &quot;Ive never been so scared in my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as she embraced Lisa in a tight hug. &quot;Im just glad your okay,&quot; sge soothed as she felt Lisa cry fresh tears. &quot;You really scared me their for a minute. Now you knoq why im so careful with the ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa nodded sadly as she wiped her eyes on her overly large sleeve. <br />
<br />
&quot;Still I think you need to learn a lesson,&quot; Katie smirked. &quot;So your grounded for two hours. Head up to your room. In a couple of hours you&#39;ll be your old self again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa frowned before smirking. &quot;I dont think ill ever get used to this,&quot; she giggled. &quot;But fair is fair. I said you could ground me so i got to take my medicine. Besides could be fun being 11 now that im safe. &quot;<br />
<br />
Katie and Lisa hugged as the 11 year old trudged upstairs. Katie grinned broadly knowing if Lisa evwr borrowed the ring again she would be more careful.</p>
