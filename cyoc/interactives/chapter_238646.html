<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny watched Jeff type away. She wanted to take a look at what he was going to do, but the surprise was something that thrilled her to no end. Her mind was completely at his disposal. She knew at any second, she could be a completely different person. Jeff gave her one final look before pressing enter. The smile across his face told her something had changed. It was true that her sweater suddenly felt scratchier, but other than that everything was normal.<br />
<br />
“So… what did you write?”<br />
<br />
Jeff pointed at her crotch, “Touch yourself and find out.”<br />
<br />
Jenny raised an eyebrow. She was expecting Jeff to do something perverted; she probably would have done the same, but everything still felt mostly normal.<br />
<br />
Jenny made a little show for Jeff. She bit her lip and slid her leggings down her legs to halfway up her thighs. Then, she used her well-manicured hand to stroke her pussy, just as she had countless times before when she was alone in her room.<br />
<br />
Except this time was different. Instead of the regular buildup that came from foreplay, her vagina felt achy, like it was sore from overuse. She pulled her hand away when that pain seemed to spread up her spine. <br />
<br />
“Jeff, what did you do to me?”<br />
<br />
Jeff let out a light chuckle, “Watch this.”<br />
<br />
Before Jenny could react, Jeff slapped her as hard as he could across the face. Jenny fell to the floor, not from the pain, but from the shock. She couldn’t understand why Jeff would do something like that to her. Then she realized that the normal sting on her face that she would feel after a slap was missing. Instead, that warmth she would normally feel during foreplay, seemed to be coming from her cheek. <br />
<br />
That feeling of pleasure spread through her face, like Jeff had just hit her G-spot, but if her whole face was the clit. She shuddered and climbed to her feet. Jeff had waited patiently for her to recover. Still shuddering, Jenny stumbled over to the Chronivac and read what Jeff had typed. She was surprised how simple the inputs were. On the left, it had Jenny’s name, and in the box what just ‘Pleasure’. On the right was her name again, and written under it was just ‘Pain’. Jeff had taken his time with this, so she thought it would be something of more substance, but it appeared that simple was better.<br />
<br />
Before she said anything, Jeff grabbed her from behind, reaching his hands around her neck. He grabbed hard. Jenny tried to make a scream, but his grip was tight enough that barely a whimper could be heard. She knew this was dangerous. Jeff made literally everything that should harm her now give pleasure. Jeff once again pulled her to the ground, now ready for the fun part of his little plan.<br />
<br />
She put up no resistance to him. Indeed, she seemed to be enjoying how forceful he was. He pinned her face down on the floor, her face forced into the carpet. With One hand still holding Jenny down by the neck, he used his other hand to open his pants and release his throbbing shaft.<br />
<br />
Jeff traced his penis around her behind until he found her anus. It took him a moment to line up properly. During that time Jenny tried to say something, but her words were muffled by a mouthful of carpet. With a powerful thrust, he forced his way in. Jenny would have never tried anal. It wasn’t just that she wasn’t into it, she knew that trying something like that for the first time with no prior experience would be incredibly painful. But here she was not needing to worry about that.<br />
<br />
Her asshole was tight, and put up heavy resistance, not that Jeff minded. Jenny felt more aroused in that moment than she had in all the times she and Jeff had sex before. Even the carpet burn on her urethra with every thrust was turning her on. But the best part was when Jeff started slapping her ass cheeks. Each slap was like its own orgasm. She came each time in perfect rhythm with his hands.<br />
<br />
With a final thrust, Jeff finished inside her, filling her rectum with his seed. As he pulled out, her tender anus quivered in pain, but Jenny was still feeling pleasure from how sore it was. Jeff took a moment to admire the mess he made. Jenny was breathing heavily and biting her knuckle, something she only did while they were cuddling after sex. This contrasted with Jenny’s Leggings and panties around her ankles, and the redness of the left cheek on her face that he slapped earlier, as well as the redness of her two ass cheeks. If she wasn’t letting out soft coos, he would have thought she needed some major aftercare.<br />
<br />
Jenny felt pure bliss. She knew that what Jeff had done could easily be called rape, but she still felt so good. The way he just carelessly left her on the floor to recover on her own, it would have normally made her feel lonely and abandoned, but even those feelings seemed to have been swapped for relaxation and contentedness.<br />
<br />
Jeff grabbed her by the hair and started dragging her across the floor. Jenny once again didn’t put up any resistance and moaned from the pleasure. He dragged her out of his room and all the way through his house, not even caring about her bottoms still sitting around her ankles. When he reached the front door, he picked her up and threw her outside.<br />
<br />
As she collided with the pavement, she scraped her knee, creating a cut on her leg. The feeling was ecstasy. She grabbed at it with her hand, and the normal stinging feeling was like aftershocks after reaching climax. She looked back at Jeff and he shot her that same wicked grin he made after he swapped her emotions, then he slammed the door. Jenny was left on his doorstep, injured, bottomless, and her emotions still completely backwards.<br />
<br />
Jenny knew she couldn’t stay there forever, so she pulled herself together and drew her legging back up her legs. She knew, logically, that what Jeff just did was awful, but she still felt like it was romantic in a horrifying way. Clearly Jeff intended to keep her this way for a little longer, and she still had things she needed to do tonight. She looked around and figured felt a little bashful. She was almost hoping someone had seen her with her leggings down, even though she knew how bad that would be for her reputation.<br />
<br />
After making sure she had her phone and keys, she started walking home. Jeff lived a good distance away, so she figured she should try jogging. As she did, she noticed something new. The aching feeling that she normally got while running made her feel energized and lively this time. That made her run faster, despite her short breath and tired legs. By the time she got home she was in a full sprint, her breath short and her head light.</p>
