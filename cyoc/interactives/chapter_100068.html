<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frances returned to her office and consultation room to find Harry returning to his human form and rubbing Jenny&#39;s shoulders. She could clearly see some stress on Jenny&#39;s face as she looked down. Her cheeks were still wet with tears and gave her the sense that she wanted her family to be happy for her and wasn&#39;t getting it. On some level, Frances could understand that, but griping about the difficulties she&#39;d had with her own parents wouldn&#39;t work well as a therapist. Even if Jenny felt that Frances was sympathetic, it wouldn&#39;t be professional on Frances&#39; part.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; Frances began slowly as she came in and sat down. Her voice sounded slightly nervous, as she knew that she already knew at least part of the answer to the question she was going to ask, &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny looked up slowly and sighed, &quot;I really don&#39;t know... I mean... you heard what Ms. Tachibana said...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, I did,&quot; Frances nodded, &quot;and believe me... I can understand the position of dealing with parents who have ideas and plans different from their child&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
Frances nodded, &quot;though from what you&#39;ve told me... I will have to admit that my parents haven&#39;t gone as far as yours have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances then swiveled in her chair to collect the notepad that she was keeping her notes for Jenny&#39;s recuperation on. For the most part she didn&#39;t think the new werefox had any true mental problem. It was more that her transformation, and the length of time to complete it, put a lot of stress on her mind, and stress that she would need work out. And from what Frances had studied in supplementary psychology courses in Moon Lake that dealt specifically with were psychology, this was fairly typical of weres that were in positions like Jenny&#39;s. The only way for them to truly heal was to talk about it and get it off their chests, not unlike soldiers who had gone through a great of stress in a war. They needed to let all the things that troubled their mind out in order to deal with it. The actions of her parents would only make the situation worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though we aren&#39;t here to compare stories,&quot; Frances then finished and swiveled her chair back to look toward Jenny and Harry. &quot;We&#39;re here to help you get your feet back under as it were... gain your confidence back... accept being a were... and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny gave a weak smile and rubbed her eyes, &quot;I actually think I&#39;m fine with being a were. So long as I have Harry with me... to make love to... to cuddle with... He&#39;s wonderful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry gave his fiance a soft smile and squeezed her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Frances smiled, &quot;how have you been doing on your own? When Harry isn&#39;t there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rather well,&quot; Jenny said slowly, &quot;but everyone&#39;s been so friendly to me... helpful and welcoming to me after everything that&#39;s gone on. Even apologizing for the rogue&#39;s actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s rather common,&quot; Frances assured her, &quot;we tend to have a rather tight knit community here in Moon Lake and we try very hard that we aren&#39;t mindless monsters. Yvette&#39;s actions would counter very much what we try to be. The people of Moon Lake will want you to feel welcome here and that we aren&#39;t all like her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded. On some level she&#39;d figured that out already, and that situation would even relate to new weres, based on the offer that Mr. Anderson had given her. To a great extent, all of that did make her feel welcome. She was truly glad to feel that welcome in the town.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...you are feeling welcome and that&#39;s good,&quot; Frances mused, &quot;but we all know about the stresses that your parents appear to be putting on you... and I&#39;m sure that can&#39;t be easy for either of you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, Mrs. Twist,&quot; Harry held Jenny to him for a moment and answered first, angry and suspicious about the fact that either Jenny&#39;s parents or Dieter Wilhelm had bought a return ticket for Jenny and gave her Dieter&#39;s surname, &quot;If they&#39;re seriously going to pull stunts like this... I could care less about her parents, and tell them to take their Medieval method of parenting away and leave Jenny with those who truly love her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure, and as the man who loves her, I&#39;d expect nothing less from you,&quot; Frances nodded, &quot;but is that entirely what you want Jenny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... not really,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;they&#39;ve put a lot of stress on me over the years and I can&#39;t say that they were the best parents without lying... but even with many of the things that they&#39;ve done... it wasn&#39;t as if they wanted me hurt or in a bad place to be... It&#39;s... it&#39;s more that they can&#39;t figure that I could make good choices on my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances nodded, &quot;And perhaps they will see that you have made good choices and that Harry will be eager to protect you from anything that may try to hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny briefly smiled and leaned her head against Harry&#39;s shoulder. Frances took some relief in that, though it made her next question particularly difficult.<br />
<br />
&quot;And suppose they cannot be reached?&quot; Frances asked, &quot;suppose they either don&#39;t see Harry for who he is or are too blinded by whatever Mr. Wilhelm has offered them to listen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny gave a weak sigh, &quot;then... then I&#39;d suppose I&#39;d need to burn all bridges between us... because I&#39;ve made my decision. I&#39;m not going back. I&#39;m going to stay here, be the best werevixen I can be... have as many kits as Harry and I agree to have... and help people...&quot;<br />
<br />
What Jenny said next caught Frances by surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you,&quot; Jenny finished.<br />
<br />
Frances very nearly dropped her pen at that. While patients had thanked her for her help to them, she&#39;d never had a patient who drew inspiration from her before. It made her feel rather flattered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Frances spoke after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... it&#39;s really me who should be thanking you... listening to me voice my concerns with my folks... and other things... offering to pay for the second ceremony,&quot; Jenny said slowly, &quot;it&#39;s more than I&#39;d probably get at &quot;home.&quot; Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances slowly nodded, but caught on to one of the things that Jenny had said. &quot;And other things&quot; echoed in the back of Frances&#39; mind, which drew her to keep the session moving  in order to help Jenny in the best possible way.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mention other things,&quot; Frances commented, &quot;Is something other than your family&#39;s pressure on you troubling you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny looked to Frances and then Harry nervously. Harry comfortably rubbed Jenny&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your nightmare, Jen,&quot; Harry told her, &quot;that&#39;s what she&#39;s been asking about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been having nightmares?&quot; Frances asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes...&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;but I&#39;ve... I&#39;ve never thought they would be a problem...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They can be a sign of it,&quot; Frances spoke, &quot;weres that have have gone for a lengthy period of time being incomplete in their transformation may often have nightmares about the were that turned them or involving the were that turned them in some way. Usually it&#39;s the fear of being left incomplete or struggling with the fact that the new were is no longer a normal human, or that the were that turned them has some personal hatred, even when it&#39;s not real. It represents the issues that are rather typical for weres that have had long periods of being incomplete in their transformations. If things have been bothering you at night, it&#39;s best to let it out. It&#39;d help...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Jenny said slowly, &quot;Well... I have had some trouble with nightmares. The latest one had just about everything that has been stressing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances wrote down her notes as Jenny answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It started with Dieter Wilhelm seemingly buying off everyone to make me marry him,&quot; Jenny spoke, &quot;when I... took care of him and went looking for Harry, I found my self facing my folks... dressed like I was some kind of prostitute. They rejected me... said that only a prostitute would have a body like the one I have now... they wouldn&#39;t let me try to explain. Then Yvette came out... and acted like a pimp and that I was a prostitute working for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That seemed to cover just about all the issues you&#39;ve had to face,&quot; Frances commented, &quot;and all the things that have been stressful on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what does it mean?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a guess on my part... but Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s presence is likely knowledge of whatever he&#39;s done to try and woo you, regardless of whether or not that you wanted him too,&quot; Frances commented, &quot;that he&#39;s simply going to keep trying the things that you&#39;ve rejected before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your parents and their rejecting you... along with Yvette&#39;s involvement has more to do with many perceptions and fears,&quot; Frances continued, &quot;You don&#39;t want to lose your family, which is perfectly understandable, but you know they&#39;ve been strict that that your body&#39;s gone through tremendous physical changes in becoming a were. Like every female were, your hips are wide, your bust is ample, your stomach trim, and your muscles firm and toned, regardless of how big your muscles are. And to a degree... that creates the sort of image that many people have of prostitutes... People commonly see them has highly sexualized women in tight or revealing clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m not a prostitute... or anything like that,&quot; Jenny protested, &quot;Harry&#39;s been the only man I&#39;ve ever loved or truly dated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure, you aren&#39;t,&quot; Frances nodded, &quot;but your fears... be they conscious or subconscious aren&#39;t going to sit with the facts. It&#39;s why our fears are things that we worry over and give us stress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny looked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... is that a fear?&quot; Frances asked, &quot;Do you think your parents will just see you as a prostitute because of your new form?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny sat quietly for a moment, and said weakly, &quot;Yes... I mean... it&#39;s not like I&#39;m built for anything other than sex now... I know I&#39;m not ... I mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Frances assured her, &quot;It&#39;s an understandable fear. Especially for someone who&#39;s had as harsh a childhood as you&#39;ve claimed. I&#39;ve talked with plenty of new weres who&#39;ve been incomplete for longer than is normal... maybe not as long as you, but still longer than what is normal... and they&#39;ve all had the same fear. That their new bodies gave them the look of prostitutes or other things that society has generally frowned on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So this fear is normal?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;for new weres that haven&#39;t had much knowledge about were society before as they try to adapt... The big thing for you will be to remember the phrase that you can&#39;t judge a book by it&#39;s cover. Yes you&#39;ve gained a farm more voluptuous body... but that doesn&#39;t change WHO you are. You&#39;re still just as smart as you were before. You&#39;re just as brave as before. You&#39;re still as kind as you were before, and you&#39;re surely just as loving as you were before. It&#39;s normal to have the fear. And recognizing the fear is there is a good start. Knowing specifically what scares you is what will give you the ability to confront that fear... Remember that regardless of what your body looks like... you aren&#39;t what they might perceive you as.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded as Harry held her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never let your fears govern you,&quot; Frances continued, &quot;your fears are just that. And while your parents could very well cause trouble... you must not let THEIR opinion determine what you do. It will only fuel your fears. Can you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Frances gave a smile, &quot;I think we&#39;ve made good progress day.&quot;</p>
