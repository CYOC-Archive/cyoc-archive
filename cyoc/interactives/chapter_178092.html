<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle blinked a bit as Andy came into the room, looking between him and Jim then down to his beer.<br />
<br />
Jim just laughed. &quot;No, man, not seeing things. This is my twin brother Andy.&quot; Jim motioned to his brother who was getting his own beer out of the fridge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two of you?&quot; Kyle said, sounding a bit foggy, or drunk. He reached down and rather obviously adjusted himself in his pants. The thought of these two muscular hunks being his new neighbors was getting him pretty riled up. Even the slightly musky smell the two had post work-out wasn&#39;t seeming to bother him as much as the moments ticked by. &quot;Is it hot in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim shrugged. &quot;Take off your shirt then, we&#39;re all guys. &#39;Sides, you&#39;ve sweated right through that thing. It&#39;s probably starting to smell pretty ripe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle lifted his shirt and gave it a little sniff. Jim was right, it was starting to smell a little. He peeled off the shirt and tossed it aside. He didn&#39;t seem to notice the fact that his torso was slowly growing. Muscle shifting beneath his skin as years of running just to stay lean became years of pumping iron and lifting weights. His pecs becoming round and plump, his faint layer of chest hair running down the middle and fanning out a little near the top. &quot;I can&#39;t stay long.&quot; He murmured, looking right at Andy&#39;s crotch for a moment then his eyes shifting away as if burned. &quot;My girlfr.. My..&quot; He shook his head to clear out his mind. Something was off but he couldn&#39;t put his finger on it. &quot;I only have the rental truck so long, need to unload furniture still.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, Jim and I can help you get it unloaded. Three guys like us? We&#39;ll have it done in no time.&quot; Andy said as he took his own seat, Jim flexed an arm and clapped his bicep with a wink. Jim was playing his meathead game with Andy. He liked people thinking he was a dumb jock, but Andy knew his brother was far from dumb. The dumb act just put people at ease. They both did it, especially when trying to get laid.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do? He seems off?&quot; Jim whispered to Andy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Altered reality. He was straight and in a relationship. Now he&#39;s gay and not. I made sure he&#39;d be unaware of anything changing, only we&#39;ll know.&quot; Andy kept his voice low, but Kyle was absently hefting one of his pecs, like it was the first time he was seeing them.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can do that?&quot; Jim asked a little surprised.<br />
<br />
Andy grinned. &quot;And a whole lot more. You can even make the changes stretch out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle laughed and leaned back in the chair as his once flat stomach hardened into abs. &quot;You&#39;re right. Glad to know I&#39;ve got such good neighbors.&quot; He tossed one arm along the back of the chair, as both of his arms grew almost to match the twins. &quot;I should be giving you guys beers for offering to help.&quot; Kyle had to reach down to adjust himself inside his jeans again. Not because he was hard, he had been that since he saw the twins side by side. His cock was getting bigger, not that he seemed to notice. But Andy was licking his lips.<br />
<br />
Jim smiled. He knew his brother had a thing for bottoms with big dicks, said he liked watching them swing as he fucked them. Jim had to admit he liked it himself, but Andy loved it. Jim on the other hand.. Kyle&#39;s nipples seemed to grow a little where they tipped his pecs, a bit larger and plumper than you&#39;d find on most guys, perfect for playing with. Jim looked at Andy who just shrugged. He knew he could count on his brother.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s jeans had gone up a few sizes to accommodate his thicker legs and a firm, rounded rear. Andy really had gone all out on finding them a perfect bit of stress relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;So tell us about you.&quot; Andy said, still grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?&quot; Kyle blinked a few times. &quot;Just graduated. Got this place and a new job coming up. Not much to tell.&quot; Kyle rather unremarkable brown hair was getting a bit of a curl to it, shifting to an auburn color. Stubble was growing along his somewhat sharper jaw as well. &quot;What about you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still in college.&quot; Jim answered. &quot;What job?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A, uh,...&quot; Kyle seemed to blank, then snapped back to reality. &quot;Doing promoting and event management for a bar. Jesse&#39;s.&quot; He was rubbing his chest as a bit more hair started growing in, a line forming up the center of his abs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesse&#39;s.&quot; Jim said. &quot;I know the place. Gay bar a few blocks from here.&quot; He looked to Andy who nodded.<br />
<br />
Kyle seemed to perk up as they recognized it. &quot;Oh! You guys been?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy laughed, shifting seats to sit next to Kyle on the couch. &quot;I wish. We&#39;re only twenty. Can&#39;t get in yet. We were planning on celebrating our twenty-first there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twenty? Really?&quot; Kyle was eyeing the two hunks, trying to put that thought in his head that these two were still under drinking age. He was only twenty-three himself, but these two surprised him. He shook his head, trying to clear his thoughts once more. &quot;Sorry, the truck. I really need to get it unloaded.&quot; He stood up and drained the beer. His beard had completely filled in now. Rust red and a bit fuller than the twins wore, even if they were hairier elsewhere. Andy grinned as his changes completed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me get on some pants and we&#39;ll be right down.&quot; Andy said. Kyle nodded and headed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to get laid, not move furniture.&quot; Jim muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think of it as a pre-sex work out.&quot; Andy replied as he slapped his twin on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;So. He had no memory of being changed?&quot; Jim called after his brother as he vanished to get his pants. Jim busied himself with getting his shoes on. It had been hot watching Kyle changing in front of them going from average joe to bearded hunk. He had to admit, Andy was an artist with this program.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. He thinks that&#39;s who he&#39;s always been. He&#39;s also a bottom and has a twin fetish. You can do so much with this thing.&quot; Andy said as he came back out with his shoes on and a pair of jeans. Still no shirt though.<br />
<br />
&quot;So in other words...&quot; Jim started.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re his walking, talking sex fantasy.&quot; Andy finished with a grin. &quot;He&#39;ll be thanking us after we get him moved in. I promise.&quot;</p>
