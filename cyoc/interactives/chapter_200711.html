<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you finish inhaling your pudding, you begin to wonder if there is any other form this delicious purple goo can take. With the tingling from the pudding still rattling through your body, you call the waiter over.<br />
&quot;Can the chef make this special in any other ways? Like a 5-course meal or something?&quot; he asked inquisitively.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he can whip something up for you. Would you like something to drink? You&#39;re sweating an awful lot.&quot;<br />
Surely enough that craving for more of whatever that special was has left you burning up. It&#39;s as if you had a fever just coursing through your body and only a cold bath could make you comfortable. Or maybe...<br />
&quot;How about a milkshake good sir? Complete with extra whipped cream.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure thing!&quot; the server said with another one of those smiles that was just a little too big. He rushes off into the kitchen to place the order and you feel the heat begin to centralize in your head into two little bumps. Your ears also start to feel hot but you think that must be just the fever.<br />
But before you have any more time to think about it the servers comes back with a lavender milkshake in a classic glass cup, topped with whipped cream that barely touches the edges and drizzles with that delightful orange glaze from before. You feel your tongue hang out as you lock eyes on it, suddenly unable to think about anything but guzzling down that delectable milkshake as fast as you can.<br />
As the server sets it down in front of you he mutters something under his breath about his boss being late and leaves you to it. You can barely wait as you grab the straw,rip off the wrapper, and poke it into the shake without a second thought. You take that first sip and it tastes just as good as it did before. NO. Better than it did before. It had an almost earthy taste that you couldn&#39;t quite place. Little did you know that as you chugged on the milkshake, the heat turned more into a buzz as you could feel things happening to your body. The bumps on your head began to extend outward, making them go from soft bumps to big, rock hard horns. Not that you noticed of course. You&#39;re barely through your fist sip of the shake when your ears begin to grow hair on them and extend outward as well. They grew little muscles that made you want to wiggle them with every sip you took it tasted so good. And you did. Your ears barely perked up when you heard someone else enter the shop and begin talking with the server that had brought you this delicious masterpiece.<br />
As you finish your first sip you look over to the server and say: &quot;Mooy compliments tooo the chef!&quot;<br />
You do a little chef&#39;s kiss with your already blackening hands and go back to your milkshake. The second your mouth hits the straw, you feel someone&#39;s hand on your shoulder. You look up with the straw still in your mouth. You hear them say: &quot;Don&#39;t mind me, just keep on drinking you dumb cow.&quot; You find yourself compelled to follow his words and you look up to see it&#39;s the man who gave you the flier! It vaguely comes back to you that maybe you shouldn&#39;t be doing this, but for some reason, you are unable to stop. You try pulling your mouth away from the straw, but that only causes the tingly feeling to rush back to your head as you successfully pull your head away but your mouth and nose stays in place. You move your eyes downward to see that you now have a muzzle with a black leathery nose and the end of it. You look back up at the man in horror as he sits across from you at the booth.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the one who asked for the shake aren&#39;tcha?&quot; he says in a gravelly voice.<br />
You try to tell him that this isn&#39;t part of what you wanted, but with your new muzzle stuck to the straw, it only allows you to nod or shake your head. <br />
&quot;By what Johnny over there told me you were. Great question by the way. No one has ever asked us that before but yet here you are. Man I&#39;m sure she had fun with that one!&quot; He chuckles a little to himself.<br />
&quot;Almost makes me want to try that shake myself, but let&#39;s see all of what happens with you first ya?&quot;<br />
You shake your head emphatically and it seems to send tingling sensations up and down your body faster than before.<br />
&quot;Look my guy, you can&#39;t resist here. The more you resist the faster it&#39;s gonna happen. So relax; enjoy the ride.&quot; He sits back with his hands behind his head as your head start feel real fuzzy.<br />
&quot;Yeah, I should relax.&quot; You think to yourself. You begin to chug faster as you feel a poking sensation at the base of your spine. the poking sensation gets faster and faster until finally you you hear a loud pop and your eyes roll back into your head in pleasure as your tail finally releases from your body and wags lazily above your pants. You feel you dick begin to shrink down smaller and smaller while your balls also begin to shrink back from whence they came into a leathery vagina just below where your new tail is. You begin to feel your legs thicken with layers of fat, and as you realize this the Boss that is sitting across from you decides to say something:<br />
&quot;Go ahead and stand up, I get the feeling that booth isn&#39;t going to fit you much longer. and go ahead and bend over to drink that shake, I want to see everything jiggle.&quot;<br />
You begin to do as he says, feeling really horny all of the sudden at seeing his pants tenting at the table. As you feels your toes fuse together and your ass begin to expand, your shoes fall of and your pants rip from bending over to drink the shake. By now the shake is only half gone, and with so much left to go you finally figure out what that taste is. <br />
&quot;It&#39;s grass!&quot; Just the thought of it being grass make your tail wag and your stomach churn. The churning continues as your gut begins to expand, stretching out your boxers to their limit but not quite ripping yet. You find that the added weight makes it easier to lean over to drink the shake. Your stomach begins to split and become 4 so that you can enjoy the shake more thoroughly. You let out a small toot after it finishes forming and giggle a little to yourself because that felt so good. The burning sensation returns as it hits your nipples, turning them rock hard and making them longer as they turn into teats. You feel the newly forming breasts filling with something but you can barely think at all this point. It&#39;s like all of you now is all jiggly and sloshy except for your magnificent hooves and horns. This includes your head, which seems to be filled with thoughts of only milk and cum. You giggle as you realize this, because of course it is! It&#39;s all you&#39;ve ever thought about, so why would that change? You feel your milky tits move downwards as another pair forms on your pelvis. They merge together and expand even further to become a massive udder. As your almost finished with your shake your feel your entire finish off by getting absolutely covered in nice, soft, leathery hide where it hadn&#39;t already. <br />
And then you remember the whipped cream.<br />
Uh-oh.<br />
Your animal instincts begins to kick in as your ability to stand on two legs goes out the door completely. You ignore the straw and stick your tongue right down to the bottom of the glass. Your realize your tongue is longer and thicker making it easier to lap up all of that delightful whipped cream and orange sauce. The whipped cream seems to make you even bigger. Your ass begins expanding to the point that you can stand on two legs again but then your stomach gets more layers of jiggly fat again which almost drags you back down, but the orange sauce makes it that she can now be either on two or four legs now. You get your tits back one again, a pleasant experience to be sure to feel them grow and expand once again. Your udder and vagina swell as you feel a new sort of heat. The one that makes you so horny you can barely stand it.</p>
