<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Solrss felt good about his new [lover] levels... he had somewhat mixed feelings about it being with a human... it also being Zoe of all people... Not that he didn&#39;t like Zoe, if he didn&#39;t he wouldn&#39;t have a shared [lover] class... it&#39;s just... she could be fixated on puzzles. Solrss woke up to find that Zoe had locked them both in a Force Cage with a puzzle lock that Zoe had told him was linked towards both of their bodies, and with a few illusion spells he had some access to some spells she had... and Zoe was in some Succubus form that was illusioned to look like a Draco of sorts. <br />
&quot;Zoe... I like you, I like puzzles, this may be neat... but I need to have SOMETHING to eat and get ready before class starts...&quot; Solrss was groggy, and while being forced to solve puzzles to literally start the day may get his mind more active... He just wasn&#39;t in the mood for anything kinky NOW. <br />
&quot;[Dispel]&quot; Zoe muttered as a good sex puzzle was just dismantled... &quot;I hear you guys were always ready or something!&quot;<br />
&quot;Dracos? It&#39;s you humans that fuck enough to have a significant population around the world.&quot; Solrss retorted <br />
&quot;Huh? No... I meant men.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ugh... maybe? I never really paid attention to that&quot; Solrss muttered as he went to prepare some tea. He then took a look and the whole Succubus/Draco form wasn&#39;t an illusion. The image of a succubus was mostly portrayed by their main &quot;prey&quot; of humans but Solrss supposed they could probably adapt to most sexed species with enough cognitive function... and of course she looked a little put out. Solrss put in a teabag and spoke &quot;I realize we&#39;ve spoken mostly about puzzles, I&#39;ve helped you with meals and such, and there&#39;s something here. It&#39;s just... I&#39;m an average Draco with a pension for magic and puzzles. If we had started last night maybe I&#39;d have said yes, but... there are things we need to do, and I have duels to practice and spells to master. Don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
Zoe felt confident in her ability to pass the trial for new freshman, but... she could always use more... that was a lesson drilled by both Avram and Loveheart. You could be at the top, but you can always use more time for yourself and diving deeper... or at least Zoe could dive deeper into her puzzle... or find some hole somewhere where Loveheart wouldn&#39;t find her so she could do her own thing for maybe a day... but diving deeper. Zoe had decided to dig deep with the help at that thing behind the levels and classes in a way that only a [pervert] and [lover] could with this deal... She at least wanted to make some progress today... still with [emotional empathy] she could easily tell Solrss wouldn&#39;t budge right now. <br />
<br />
Zoe had to figure out what she wanted to do with the day. Loveheart was talking about maybe giving her a budget to start enchanting some things... Solrss&#39; puzzle was in her escape room so both were out since she didn&#39;t want to be discovered that quickly... She could just study from her spellbook... for sure she didn&#39;t have enough money to get someone to transcribe more enchantments into one of her spellbooks for her skill to work off of... She decided to go to what was described by Loveheart as the &quot;adventurer waiting room&quot;. Turns out this magic school had a lot of magical corridors and whatnot whose knowledge, treasures, or dangers were forgotten or sealed away. So that made adventuring parties of a certain degree of power interested in plumbing the edges of the known school. There was a good chance of finding highly magical loot that they could either use or pawn off onto a [Wizard] who actually cared about the loot... or finding some curse or monster that would instantly kill you. <br />
<br />
The actual &quot;waiting room&quot; had some space magic on it so entering it you saw it was more vast to allow for hundreds of adventurers to pack up together, and camp for awhile as they discussed strategies, made alliances, etc. She made illusionary words above her that read &quot;Enchanter between 20-30, willing to enchant appropriate gear with single use spells.&quot; ...The right enchantment could be worth a lot to the right person. Even low level spells could be life saving... and if she may be able to catch the right person&#39;s eye maybe some of her hornier enchantments may be worth someone using a bit of their personal gold for experimentation. She sat for awhile till she saw someone she recognized &quot;Fluffball! how are you doing!?!&quot; Zoe called out to the [Wizard] she had nearly ignited. The Gnoll was fluffy in terms of his hair mostly sticking out thanks to being charged with electricity. probably some skill that let him store his magic in his fur. Fluffball in the middle of his party glared at Zoe as others in his party snickered. <br />
&quot;My name isn&#39;t Fluffball! You little twerp. Follow me to the dueling arenas and I&#39;ll show you your little stunt wont work twice!&quot; The Gnoll who didn&#39;t give his actual name yelled<br />
&quot;nah... I&#39;m more of an enchanting type. Could even give you a sample that&#39;ll last about half an hour!&quot; Zoe said smiling and wondering how he&#39;d handle something like [Change Sex]. The party began discussing with each other... a sample was nice... also if Zoe liked &quot;Fluffball&quot; perhaps she could give the party a discount on a few things. Fluffball was the only magic user so more magic items could always be.... <br />
Fluffball held out his paw and asked &quot;So... how long is this going to take?&quot; <br />
Fluffball was lucky his hair was so thick, luscious, and poofy that he usually didn&#39;t need to wear clothes. His fur had enough enchantments and skills that he didn&#39;t even need robes. That said Fluffball felt his muzzle redden a bit as the shape of his fluffball turned slightly more curvy and shorter. Just a slightly higher pitched fluffball asked &quot;The heck did you do?!?!&quot; as she felt her more masculine parts disappear. <br />
Zoe grinned and said &quot;[Change Sex] Silly little spell.&quot; she looked to the party members &quot;I&#39;ll extend it an hour per silver.&quot; A more [rougeish] member tossed a gold coin which was worth about 20 silver. Zoe smiled and [redefined] the duration for roughly 20 hours and 30 minutes. Fluffball turned and glared at her party member as Zoe said &quot;Ok... ok... I had some fun. Did anyone have an enchantment they needed. Maybe some more pure metal that can hold something like a [burning hands]?&quot; Fluffball then turned to look at Zoe<br />
&quot;What are you just offering it for free?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well... I got paid a gold piece... and I kinda like you in a way... So sure, one [burning hands] on the house.&quot; Turns out the enchantment went to their [guardian] where the [burning hands] turned more into a [burning shield]. Zoe really had undercharged for her services, but actually enchanting things felt good... Working actual magic into actual items and the formulae burned in her mind making her think of puzzles she could potentially make with them. Plus now she had some actual pocket money, and she had an adventuring group she had made some bonds together with. They hadn&#39;t actually named themselves yet, but most of the members aside from Fluffball agreed to call themselves &quot;The Fluffies!&quot; It didn&#39;t hurt that she had managed to get their more [rougish] member a few enchantments on some metal coins for [change sex] or [change species]... now that she thought of it those would make for good disguise spells... or maybe the [rogue] just liked to experiment. She happily skipped her way through to Solrss&#39; room having gathered something nice to eat [Just how he liked it], but as Solrss got back he seemed even more tired than yesterday... more scales missing and the one&#39;s that existed were more discolored with ash or weird magical things. When Zoe saw him she wished she had made some relationships with [healer]-types... He&#39;d need sleep and maybe a few days of studies to even get to a proper state. All she could do was... <br />
When Solrss was in a more lucid state from having wandered back to his room he found that his head rested in a scaly lap of another Draco, the scales near his earholes being scratched slowly... as Zoe hummed a certain tune that wasn&#39;t quite a lullaby his mom would hum to him, but it had a similar feel. <br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got something for us to eat...&quot; Zoe then fed Solrss till he was too tired and fell asleep... <br />
<br />
Zoe felt exhausted after that and she really wasn&#39;t expecting Loveheart to appear and say &quot;So, how was your first day or two of freedom?&quot;<br />
Zoe looked and said &quot;So you were watching all along?... I just wanted to be with Solrss more than jus this.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll say that he&#39;s doing better. He has some actual drive, but he wont be an [illusionist]. At this point the [puzzler] part of him is a waste. I&#39;d consider him a sub-optimal partner. He&#39;ll probably do well for himself, but maybe just slightly above average.&quot; Zoe couldn&#39;t say much else... she didn&#39;t know what to say other than something stupid and rash... &quot;You know the [Lovers] class can evolve or switch to others right?&quot;<br />
&quot;I want to go to sleep... please leave me along with now professor.&quot; and then the illusion faded. The couch they lay on was cramped, but she was there with Solrss... that was enough for now.</p>
