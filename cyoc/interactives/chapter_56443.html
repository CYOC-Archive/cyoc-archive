<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as he went through the Library's doors, Leo was dumbfounded. To him, it looked like a bunch of colorful, leafless trees in an extremely sunny, shiny, plain. He excited went to the nearest one and noticed he could pull out the colorful parts - which were books. He read it, and was surprised that he understood what it said. He decided to take it to one of those table things Ty was talking about, and cracked it open. Again, he was surprised he could understand what he was reading. Before he knew it, his eyes were gliding over the pages of the book, his brain absorbing all of what he read and processing it as if he were a super computer. After the first book was done, he went to the shelf and grabbed as many books as he could carry - which was practically one whole row of books.<br />
<br />
Now he sat at a table that had a mountain of books on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ehem. So. You have a very wide range of interests. Like reading epic novels and dictionaries. So you've read all 50 of these, or are you one of those musclebound idiots trying to look smart?&quot; The librarian said as he stood across from Leo. Leo quickly dropped the book, and with that, the librarian's jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... You're not supposed to read these types of books?&quot; Leo quickly covered his mouth after he heard what came out. He didn't sound like that before. It was all thanks to Ty's previous spell.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no... Not exactly... Who're you?&quot; The man asked, feeling that his authority were no match to this gigantic visitor. <br />
<br />
The nervous man was dressed similar to Leo, except he had shorter, black hair. He wore thick rimmed, plastic glasses, hiding blue eyes behind them. He was lean, and stood at 6'0&quot;, but was virtually hairless. To Leo, he looked strange, though he was attractive nevertheless. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Leo, and you are?&quot; He replied, the words still feeling foreign as they came out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leo...&quot; The man replied, feeling as if he were melting. &quot;I mean, I'm Ryan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, Hector, huh?&quot; Leo replied taking a sniff. He paused briefly, his look of harassment begin replaced by a sensual, more confident one. Leo slowly walking around the table, his eyes glaring at Hector as if he were Leo's soon-to-be breakfast. &quot;You're attracted to me, aren't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No! I'm n-&quot; Ryan stopped mid sentence, due to a large, strong hand grabbing his package.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're in heat.&quot; Leo said, squeezing slightly harder. &quot;That makes two of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leo may have had a new take on things thanks to those books, but he was still a lion instinct wise. When something's in heat... Fuck it. Just this time, he has the vocabulary to demand what he wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take me to a secluded room or it's happening right here, Ryan.&quot; Leo said, now rubbing Hector's engorged manhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-uh... F-fine...&quot; Ryan replied, his body flushed red from both embarrassment and sexual stimulation. Ryan quickly led Leo to his office, which he locked as soon as Leo was in the room. &quot;The couch here pulls out...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Leo said, taking off his clothes, causing Ryan's member to push even harder up against his slacks. Ryan eagerly opened up the couch, and then removed his clothes. While he was doing that, Leo wished to have some sort of lubrication. After reading some anatomy and physiology books, he knew he'd need it. He generously coated his enormous manhood with it.<br />
<br />
Ryan just stared, laying on the bed, not knowing what to expect. He was so confused, especially about how this all happen. It was just something about Leo, an air of dominance accompanied by an intoxicating aroma. &quot;That's huge... It has got to be at least 10 inches... I-I never did this before, you know... I mean, I'm not a whore or anything! I jus-&quot; Once again, Ryan was cut short by Leo's actions.<br />
<br />
Leo pinned Ryan down on the bed, looking into his eyes. Ryan couldn't help but think he saw those eyes somewhere before, but that was the last thought he had. Leo had pulled back slightly, and used all his muscles to force himself into Ryan. The force from the thrust penetrated him with ease, quickly reshaping Ryan's insides to withstand Leo's manhood. Though unbeknownst to Ryan, Leo made it so it would work like that. Ryan screamed, followed by a series of pants and moans. Then he felt a hot, sticky substance fill his insides. Ryan thought this was a joke, seriously, just two minutes? But then he noticed that Leo kept thrusting, with the same vigor as he had from the start. The only difference was the added intensity from the heated jism within him.<br />
<br />
Then Leo came again, the burst just as strong as before, and his thrusting still on par. Despite the pleasure, Ryan's brain was trying to make sense of this. A man doesn't cum twice this fast and keeps on going. Then Leo came a third time, only ten minutes into the session. By this time, the lubrication had been used up, but now there was enough of Leo's seed inside Ryan to keep the same slick action going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leo, this is incredible!&quot; Ryan shouted, suddenly not caring about how weird all of this was. He decided to just enjoy it. <br />
<br />
Ryan began caressing Leo's muscles, kissing them, groping them, all of which just made Leo want to thrust harder. Ryan was now moving his hips into Leo's making the sensation even more intense, he just couldn't stand it and then he too, blew his load. Yet, Leo still didn't stop. This insane sex act kept going on for two hour straight, the final orgasm for the two men coming at the same time. Over the course of two hours, Leo had cum 30 times, each time with the same amount of seed. There was so much that it coated most of the couch bed.<br />
<br />
Leo, now sexually satisfied, rolled over and fell soundly asleep. Ryan, on the other hand, felt like he was electrified. There was no way he'd be sleeping... Or walking properly right after all of that. Ryan cleaned himself up a bit, and went right to the computer at his desk. He went right to his resources and looked up lions. Sure enough was a picture of a male lion staring at a camera as if it were its prey - the same type of stare Leo had. Upon further reading, he also found that Lion's 'did it' multiple times within a day, albeit, Leo condensed it into two hours rather than doing it over the span of an entire day.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way...&quot; Ryan said, looking over at Leo. &quot;Big teeth... Yellow eyes... He's so huge too... But... Arg! I'm going nuts here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leo awoke after hearing Ryan's frustrated rambling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ryan, what's wrong?&quot; Leo asked, getting up. This time he acted much less like a predator. <br />
<br />
&quot;N-nothing.&quot; Ryan lied, quickly shutting down his computer. &quot;That was sure, uh, some great stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it was. That was the first time I ever mated.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Mated?' Ryan though to himself. 'What guys says mated.' Ryan decided to just ask. &quot;Leo, what are you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As of yesterday, a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... And before that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lion. Cool, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you are! But how?! And... Wait, is this considered bestiality, what the fuck?!&quot; Ryan was now freaking out. It was too crazy to be true, but the teeth, the eyes, the sex, the word usage. It was far too convincing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a human now, so no. And another human with powers made me this way.&quot; Leo said, slowly scooping Ryan up out of the computer chair and gently laying him on the bed. Leo hugged Ryan close, and rubbed his face up against Ryan's in attempts to calm him down. &quot;Just calm down, Ryan. It's okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan didn't bother to struggle, especially since Leo's actions and tone of voice were oddly comforting. &quot;So why me?&quot; Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were the first person to be so obviously attracted to me... And I'm attracted to you.&quot; Leo said, hugging Ryan even tighter. &quot;It's weird. I never thought about mating with human, but as of late, I'm feeling more and more human than lion. Do you regret it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I don't think so. It just look and feel so amazing. So handsome and virile... But this is just a physical type of attrac-you know what, never mind...&quot; Ryan drifted off, thinking about what else Leo said. &quot;And what do you mean powers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure. This other human used them to change me into a human, and he let me have those too. I used it on you before mating so I wouldn't hurt you and it worked.&quot; Leo replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;What else can these powers do?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want them to do?&quot; Leo shot back with another question. &quot;Just toss anything out there and we can see if it works...&quot;</p>
