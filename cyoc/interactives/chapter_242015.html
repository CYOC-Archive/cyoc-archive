<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With no idea what she had discovered in her nephew&#39;s bedroom, she sat at the table and scrolled through what had popped up on the emitter. Accidentally clicking on something, June watched as the information the thing claimed it&#39;d scanned from the sleeping young man switched, she had enough time to read, &quot;Pre-saves accessed,&quot; before she was looking at another series of information. Seeing it was something for a Siamese cat with a lion&#39;s cock, June frowned.<br />
<br />
She knew about her nephew&#39;s weird fetish involving cat&#39;s, no matter how much he believed he kept it hidden. But never would she believed he&#39;d go so far as to have what she was seeing layed out on whatever the remote-thing was. Curious to know what the point was, why Damion had built the emitter, as she still assumed, she scrolled through the information. Screen blinking, she withdrew her hands, thinking she might have clicked something. But not sure what, she waited a moment to see if it would do anything else before returning to what she&#39;d been doing.<br />
<br />
At a loss to explain what it was she&#39;d taken from the young man, as she reached the bottom of the screen, she wondered how to go back to what she&#39;d seen before when she&#39;d somehow gotten it to scan her nephew. Seeing options to save the new data, alter the subject in question, set a timer, adjust awareness, June still didn&#39;t see what she wanted. Trying to swipe left, she watched as the awareness shifted from Damion being aware to both her and the young man. Wanting to know why her name was on the device, thinking it might be time to put it all back, or confront the young man about it, she tapped a finger, saw, &quot;New Presets Saved,&quot; flash across the screen, and still trying to get back to previous screen, she clicked again. Starting to vibrate, another message flashed across the screen, &quot;Or could have been a load bar,&quot; June thought, and unsure what she&#39;d done, she found herself looking at information for Damion.<br />
<br />
Inside his room, Damion moaned and shifted in his bed. Images coming to him, he lifted his leg and let forth a squirt of piss on a bin to mark his territory. Unsure how he&#39;d become a cat again, but, at the same time, not caring, he went on the prowl. Soon finding a female, he breathed in the heady scent of her body, and starting the process to indicate he wanted to mount her, everything seemed to leap ahead. Seeing her tail up and held to the side, his cock sliding from its sheath as he gazed at her vulva, and stepping closer, he sniffed at her vulva.<br />
<br />
Things shifted again, and he was now atop her. Shifting his front legs to better wrap around her, nipping at the back of her neck as he positioned his erection, he set to work. Feeling himself insert his penis into her folds, he had a brief flash as he wondered if maybe everything had leapt forward, but then it passed as he began to screw the female cat. Hearing her, the noises he was uttering, Damion almost missed it as his body began to change. Muscle mass and size dropping, he couldn&#39;t explain it as he tried to adjust his hold. And then, to his horror, he felt his privates begin to transforming. Regressing back up into his body, his balls were the first to go before his dick started to shrink. Happening faster than he thought was possible, he meowed out in dismay as his six teats appeared and his neo-vulva finished forming. Holding his tail up, it suddenly came to Damion he was no longer fucking a female cat to satisfy a biological need, but was now a female cat himself, humping another female, all to assert dominance.<br />
<br />
As the dream continued to play out, in the waking world, the young man began to look less and less like a human. His face flattening out, and seal point fur growing across his body, as more of his dream played out, the more he looked like a cat. Shrinking, his clothes ballooning around him, he was soon growing a tail as his penis and testicles shrank and twisted inward. Female genitalia forming, then shifting to better suit what he, now she, was becoming, it didn&#39;t take long before the Damion had ceased to be a human and had turned back into a Siamese cat, but, unlike before, was now female.<br />
<br />
In the kitchen, still unaware of what she had, and what she&#39;d done, June used the USB cable to plug the remote into the laptop. Watching as the information on the screen blinked, she was able to catch how it went from reading a human profile to one of a Siamese cat. Wondering why, and if she&#39;d done anything, June considered going to try and wake her nephew and confront him about the programme. But deciding, &quot;Fuck the punk,&quot; she began to scroll through the profile, learning as she went.</p>
