<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The gang made a group chat, all four of them messaging each other fairly frequently.<br />
<br />
On one day, Isabella and Judy decided to meet up and go on a Shopping Day at the local mall. They got a lot of stares, but they couldn’t deny they were loving the attention.<br />
Harry and Milo met up on another day, they went to browse around the city. Just like old times. Milo was still in awe of Harry’s new look, and his miraculous hair growth.<br />
<br />
As the days went on, their game-night was pushed back further. One week. Two weeks. Before long they’d been in their bodies for over a month! And none of them were complaining, either.<br />
<br />
In the first few weeks, Harry had found his hair to have suddenly grown down to his shoulders. Isabella decided to take him on a trip to the hairdressers, whereupon he got his hair cut, styled, and even dyed a dark shade of blonde. While they were there, Isabella also decided to get her hair cut a lot shorter. Really short. And she was loving it!<br />
Milo found his own hair to be growing rather quickly, but nothing a stop at the barbers couldn’t fix.<br />
Judy was loving her body. She knew her body looked overly exaggerated, but she couldn’t help but love the feeling of implants, even if they were much too big for her.<br />
<br />
The group was having so much fun, that they decided that maybe they could live like this for even longer. So they scheduled to push the game back even further.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“Good morning, baby,” Isabella said, stretching as she rubbed her eyes. She laid in bed, waiting for her partner to reply, “baby?”<br />
“Hnnngh…” Harry groaned. His voice sounded coarse, must’ve been from how groggy he was, they had stayed up pretty late,<br />
“You okay?” Isabella asked, pushing herself up. She made her way to the bathroom. She looked over her shoulder at Harry, he had covered himself up completely with his blanket. Isabella sighed. She entered the bathroom, reaching down to the grab her toothbrush as she rubbed her eye. As she put the toothpaste on the brush, she looked herself in the mirror,<br />
<br />
“AHHHH!” Isabella screamed. Harry couldn’t help but try and jump out of bed to rush to her aid, even in a sleepy state he was there. But something felt off. He felt… tired. Very tired. Like his entire body was aching nonstop,<br />
“Baby?” He groaned, barely opened his eyes. Isabella ran out of the bathroom, the toothbrush fallen to the floor and toothpaste smudged onto the tiles. As Harry opened his eyes wide, he saw Isabella. A shocked expression on her face as she looked at him. But he struggled to focus on himself when he could see his girlfriend was completely green!<br />
“What happened to you!” They both said to each other. Harry was more focussed on the peculiar colour his significant other had become, but she replied,<br />
“Have you seen yourself!?” Isabella yelped,<br />
“What?” Harry asked. He looked down at his arms and relatively decent sized… sagging breasts, “AHHH!” He screamed, his voice still sounding hoarse. He looked behind Isabella and caught himself in the bathroom mirror. He still looked as he had done for the last month or so, yet he appeared old, wrinkly. His hair was grey, his skin was lighter. He had to be at least eighty years old,<br />
“W-what happened!?” Isabella said rhetorically, “it had to be the game, right? Or is this some kind of punishment?”<br />
“N-no…” Harry said, touching his arms and feeling his stretchy skin, “it’s the game. It’s because we haven’t played it, I’m sure,”<br />
<br />
The two went about their morning trying to contact Judy and Milo to find out if they’d been affected in some similar way. Indeed they had. And they were unable to reply due to this.<br />
<br />
Milo had awoken to find himself completely covered in hair. A giant Afro atop his head, a large bushy beard. Even his eyebrows had grown immense. And the moment he tried to shave it off, it immediately grew back. He was a thick mass of black hair!<br />
He went to look for Judy, and instead of finding her, he found what appeared to be her… but plastic. She still appeared to be in there, still asleep however. Her skin, bones, everything… replaced entirely by a silicone-esque plastic.<br />
When Milo woke her up, she attempted to scream, only to find that she could not produce any kind of sound,<br />
“Babe, it’s me! It’s me!” Milo explained, “I don’t know what happened, we just woke up like this!” He said. Then he saw Judy’s phone lighting up. A call from Isabella. He rushed over and tried to swipe to unlock it, but all his hair blocked him from swiping. Judy nudged him with her barely moving hands. He put the phone in front of her and she managed to get it to swipe, despite the texture of her skin.<br />
<br />
“Finally, we’ve been calling for like an hour!” Harry said,<br />
“Yeah we just woke up, sorry,” Milo said,<br />
“D-did you guys wake up looking… a little different?” Isabella asked,<br />
“Yeah,” Milo replied, “I woke up covered in hair, and Judy’s made of… like plastic or something,”<br />
“Okay, good,” Harry said, then quickly added, “n-not good, I mean it’s not just us. I woke up like fifty years older and Isabella…”<br />
“I’m green,” she chimed in,<br />
“Shit,” Milo said, “Judy can’t even talk,”<br />
“Well what do we do then?” Isabella asked, “we have to play the game, right?”<br />
“Yeah. That seems like the right move,” Milo said, looked at the closet he’d stashed the box away in,<br />
“So what time. We can’t exactly go outside looking like this,”<br />
“I’m sorry but I got a meeting in like two hours, and it’s online. I can’t afford to miss it!”<br />
“O-okay… so what about…” Harry tried to figure out the best way to organise it,<br />
“We can do six o’clock, right?” Isabella said, silencing everyone, “everyone can make it. We’ll get to yours by six, and then we’ll start playing and get everyone back to normal. Okay?” Isabella said, sternly. It was pretty obvious she was a teacher from the way she conducted everyone,<br />
“Okay,” Harry and Milo said in unison, Judy silently in agreement.<br />
<br />
The call ended, Harry and Izzy had to figure out the best way to get to Milo’s place. They’d have to ask a friend. God forbid they have to ask John again. He was always available. Just a creep.<br />
Harry thought, they could ask Tonya or David… but they seemed pretty busy with work at the moment. Tamika was always busy with her kids. Everyone was busy, especially for a Thursday night, it wasn’t the best day for last minute questions. The only person they could guarantee wasn’t free… because he was unemployed, was…<br />
“What about Betty?” Izzy suggested<br />
“Huh?” Harry said, thought for a moment, “does she have a car?”<br />
“Yeah. It’s just pretty small. I’m not sure how comfortable I’m gonna be,”<br />
“Then we’ll just ask John,”<br />
“No no, it’s fine. I’ll cover myself so she won’t see me,”<br />
“I don’t know… I don’t want to lie to Betty, she’s sweet,”<br />
“I mean how’s she gonna react to me being green, you being… well looking like a woman, and old?”<br />
“Alright fine, you hide yourself, I’ll just have to pretend to be… your mom,”<br />
“WHAT!?” Izzy exclaimed, “you wanna be… is that insulting my mom!?”<br />
“NO! I JUST… I meant…” he stuttered and stammered, “I just mean, she’s not gonna believe I’m me. I’m… I look older. And she doesn’t know what your mom looks like, right,”<br />
“No,” Izzy said, “okay I guess, but I’m going to have to cover myself up completely. No makeup in the world is gonna be able to hide all this… colour,”<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Betty arrived outside Izzy and Harry’s apartment. The two of them waiting in the lobby. Harry walked over to her, dressed in the most appropriately ‘mom’ clothes, “hi sweetie,” he cringed,<br />
“Uhm, hey. You’re Penelope, right?” Betty asked. She was a sweet looking girl, a couple years younger than the two of them… at least before the changes. Clearly her defining feature was her bright orange hair. She was wearing a t-shirt and shorts, as well as a pair of converse boots. She looked very comfortable, and a lot happier than the last time Harry had seen her. Must’ve been because she wasn’t with John anymore.<br />
“Indeed I am,” Harry lied, “I’m afraid my daughter is rather under the weather, so she’s covered up. Very shaky and cold… and stuff,” he continued,<br />
“It’s all good, it’s not contagious, is it?”<br />
“Absolutely not…” Harry also lied, he assumed it wasn’t contagious. He hadn’t turned green, at least as far as he could tell, “so we’ll just be in and out, no trouble. And we’re happy to pay for your—”<br />
“No no, it’s all okay!” Betty said, “I owe Izzy anyway,” she smiled,<br />
“G-good,” Harry said. He walked back and grabbed Izzy. Everything beyond her hair was covered up. A pair of sunglasses over her eyes, a scarf around her face. Considering it was the middle of Summer, she was practically melting in all these layers,<br />
“Let’s get this done quickly,” she panted.<br />
<br />
The two sat down in Betty’s car,<br />
“So how’s Harry?” Betty asked,<br />
“O-oh… I mean,” Isabella stuttered. She looked to Harry, he shrugged, then gave a thumbs up, “he’s good. Just a little… sick as well,”<br />
“Oh…”<br />
“Different sickness though!” She corrected, “that one is contagious. There’s a reason he’s not here,” she said, forcing a chuckle,<br />
“Oh I’m sorry, I hope he’s feeling better soon,”<br />
“Thanks…” Isabella said, “I always forget, but how did you guys meet?” Harry’s eyes went wide. He couldn’t tell if Izzy was teasing him or she’d genuinely forgotten,<br />
“Oh…” she looked at Harry, “sorry Mrs. Abel,” she apologised to who she believed to be Izzy’s mother, “well, we had a relationship in College. Didn’t end badly or anything, just not made for each other. When I met you, y’know, after you started dating. I knew you were perfect,” she giggled.<br />
Izzy looked at Harry, he seemed somewhat flustered. Stuck between his Ex and his girlfriend talking about a past relationship, and he was posing as Isabella’s mom.<br />
“So what happened with your boyfriend, John?” Harry asked, aiming to change the subject. Izzy looked shocked as he asked the question, Betty seemed a little stunned, “I must’ve heard about that from Isabella,”<br />
“R-right… well we broke up. He was… difficult,”<br />
“We know,” Izzy said. Betty couldn’t help but chuckle,<br />
“He’s… he’s intense. He’s sweet sometimes, and I’ll admit I liked him. He just… he had no respect for me. Or anyone. He was just so obsessed with himself, y’know?”<br />
“Oh I know…” Harry said, then quickly corrected, “from what I’ve heard!” He said.<br />
<br />
After a twenty minute drive filled with various small-talk and questions, they arrived at their destination,<br />
“Okay, well,” Betty said, “we’re here,” she smiled, “have I been here… wait, is this Milo’s place?” She asked,<br />
“Yes,” Izzy replied, “we’re just here to catch up. Y’know, parents meeting parents and stuff. Relationship things,” Izzy lied, forcing another chuckle,<br />
“Right…” Betty said, “well I hope you feel better soon, Izzy,” Betty said, “maybe we can meet up again soon. Do something,”<br />
“Yeah sure!” Izzy said, “shoot me a text and we’ll sort something out!” As she exited the car, she noticed Harry had dropped his phone, “uhm… mom?”<br />
“Huh?” Harry replied, then spotted the phone on the seat, “right. My bad. Not used to the lack of pockets,” he reached in and grabbed the phone. But not before making eye-contact with Betty. He shared no romantic, sexual, or intimate feelings with her, but he missed hanging out with her like they used to in college,<br />
“Thanks so much, we owe you!” Izzy said,<br />
“Yes, and thank you dear!” Harry said, Izzy cringing,<br />
“No problem…” Betty said, rather quietly, “let Harry know I hope he feels better, and yourself,” she smiled,<br />
The two of them smiled as they made their way to the entrance of the apartment complex, and the pressed the button to be rang up.<br />
However Betty had noticed something. That phone… the last time she’d seen Harry. He’d had the exact same phone. The same case. And the same giant crack through the screen that looked just like a spider-web. She’d noticed it last time, and she’d noticed it this time.<br />
Maybe he’d given Penelope his phone… she had no idea. But she was sure she wouldn’t be able to shake the thought out of her head.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Harry and Izzy exited the elevator, finding their way to Milo’s door. They knocked. No answer. The two of them looked at each other, shrugging. They knocked again.<br />
After a full on phone call (which was unanswered) they went to knock for a fifth time, they finally heard the door unlocking, “sorry!” Milo’s voice said. It was still deeper, like the last time they’d seen him.<br />
He revealed himself, still completely covered in thick hair, “nice wig,” Harry joked,<br />
“Nice saggy tits,” Milo fired back,<br />
“Seriously guys,” Izzy said,<br />
“Sorry,” Milo said with a smile, “good to see you,” he said,<br />
“You too. Where’s Judy?”<br />
“She’s in the living room, by the box,”<br />
<br />
Izzy made her way into the living room, finding Judy posed on the couch, “oh my!” Izzy said. She unwrapped the scarf from her face, removed the sunglasses, and revealed her baggy sweater and joggers clinging tightly to her large figure. Despite her plastic appearance, her eyes still seemed to widen upon seeing Isabella’s green skin,<br />
“Looks good, right?” Izzy joked, “your skin looks… weird,”<br />
Judy shrugged, she moved her arm to gesture to her body,<br />
“Huh?” Izzy replied. Judy once again gestured to her body, “d-do you… like can I touch it?” Judy nodded.<br />
Izzy approached Judy and poked her skin. It really felt like rubber, like silicone. She grabbed at it, stretching it. Judy seemed to wince, Izzy let go quickly,<br />
“Sorry! Kinda forgot it was your skin,”<br />
<br />
“So what’s it like, being old and stuff?” Milo asked, still looking like a mop,<br />
“It’s… well it’s weird. Everything is aching, my skin feels all loose,”<br />
“That’s what I thought. Guess I shouldn’t push you around too hard,”<br />
“Yeah. As much as I’d like to challenge you, I think you might actually snap me in half,” Harry admitted, “how’s the hair situation? Not tried cutting it?”<br />
“Yeah I did. Just grows back, even longer. It wasn’t this long this morning either, it keeps growing. The same for Judy, I think she’s gotten harder as the day went on,”<br />
“Oh shit… wait. That means I’ve probably gotten older,” Harry realised, “and Izzy, she’s gotten…” he pondered,<br />
“Greener?”<br />
“No idea,” Harry shrugged, “the sooner we start this game, the better,”<br />
“Agreed,”<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Everyone was in the living room. The same living the first game had been played. They looked at the box, everyone hesitating to open it.<br />
“Who’s gonna do it?” Milo asked,<br />
“Well I don’t think I should do it,” Harry said, “considering what could happen, my body is prepared for it,”<br />
“I don’t think I can even get my hands on it. Like a solid grip,” Milo said, “and I don’t need to speak for Judy… but,” he looked at her, she squinted her eyes slightly,<br />
“I’ll do it,” Isabella said, “I won the last game. I made the wish. If anything, I should reopen it,”<br />
“You sure, baby?” Harry asked,<br />
“Absolutely,” she said, not even looking at him. She approached the box, she placed her green hand on top and began to lift it open. As she did, it started to move, and her hand started to change from green to her regular (now tanned) skin tone,<br />
“Whoah!” Milo said,<br />
“It’s struck!” Isabella said, her hand starting to slow down from reversing, “I need help,”<br />
Harry quickly jumped over, grabbing at the box. It lifted up even more, his skin beginning to look younger and smoother, “I got it,” he said.<br />
Milo didn’t hesitate, but quickly helped Judy up, realising that everyone needed to help. He angled her so she could pulled it as well. She touched the box and it started lifting even higher, her silicone fingers gaining bone and muscle, letting her move normally again. And finally Milo grabbed onto the box, immediately the hair around his fingers shrank. He pulled as well. The box slid more and more, all their hands began merging together to before one big hand.<br />
<br />
FLASH!<br />
<br />
The group each felt a bright flash on white light, they each rubbed their eyes, opening them to adjust to the light. They found themselves sitting in a circle, exactly the same as they were the first time they played. This time, with their bodies changed.<br />
<br />
Milo was a big, buff bodybuilder. He was the shortest in the group, but his wide shoulders, six-pack, giant muscles and even larger bulge made up for his lack of height.<br />
<br />
Judy was the tallest, as opposed to her boyfriend. Platinum hair, big pillowy lips, tiny waist, massive round fake breasts, a big bubble butt. She was hardly real, but looked amazing despite her disproportionately built body.<br />
<br />
Harry looked almost entirely female, if it wasn’t for the cock between his legs. He had both a vagina and a penis, C-Cup breasts, a reasonably sized butt, a fair build all over. But also had the ability to change the shape and size of his penis.<br />
<br />
And Isabella. She was large. Wide hips, thick thighs. A massive butt and a big bulging belly. Resting atop her belly was here bust, each breast the size of a watermelon, not so disproportionate considering the rest of her size. But she was comfortable.<br />
<br />
The group appeared how they had for the last month or so. Each received a card, placed face-down in front of them. They looked around, checking each other. They looked a little afraid, but a part of them was also quite excited!</p>
