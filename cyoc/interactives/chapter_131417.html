<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff began to look through the options when something interesting appeared that he hadn&#39;t noticed before. What was reality shift? He clicked the option and read what it said, &#39;when the subject transforms everything around him will except his change.&#39; As he read it over and over he began to understand. Would his parents understand him being someone&#39;s poop. He then began to think who&#39;s poop to become. He thought of his older sister and brother, then he imagined being his baby sister&#39;s poop who was still wearing diapers. He typed up that information and looked back at what he had.<br />

<br />
He tried to think what else he could add to make him happy with this transformation. It was all too surreal, turning into something disgusting yet he knew not what people would think. He hesitated until he pressed the enter key. He closed his eyes waiting for the transformation when he noticed nothing happening. He opened his eyes and there was a pop up screen it said, &#39;you have set your transformation to permanent, is this what you want?&#39; He shook and clicked okay.<br />
<br />
Everything changed into complete darkness, for the first time Jeff was now worried of this machine, he now knew it could transform himself. Now he felt nothing like he was in fact not a single bit of matter. A new space started to appear as it started to tighten around him. He  began to feel again as was now just a turd, which he guessed was in a colon, his sister&#39;s colon. He began to feel new memories fill into his mind.<br />
<br />
From the very first diaper change, Jeff&#39;s family learned that he was their son. He was able to speak to them perfectly, and they treated him as both a son and trash. Jeff&#39;s body would reform into his sister&#39;s next turd and the next, so being thrown away was a normal adventure. He was perfectly happy since he wasn&#39;t treated too badly. Usually after every change, they wouldn&#39;t throw him out just yet, he did have a nice smell until he began to rot which didn&#39;t take long. Jeff would ask his family about their day, and such to kind of invite familiar life. His parents also tried to get Anna to speak so Jeff was able to talk to her, and comfort her. She began to speak well, and now she&#39;s only nineteen months old. He was able to teach her to call him Jeff, but when she learned the word poop, she always called him &#39;poopy Jeff&#39; or &#39;poopy brother&#39; which he didn&#39;t mind. Sometimes he liked it when his sister would release him in the night since he would get rather comfortable in her diaper. Jeff&#39;s old room was turned into his baby sister&#39;s room, and now seeing this was now his life, he wasn&#39;t too unhappy it had to be permanent. Now all he had to look forward to was to be released into his sister&#39;s diaper.<br />
<br />
Anna was able to feel her brother inside her butt, and froze trying to release him out. Jeff could feel her anus pinch him out of her and into her diaper. He felt her butt rubbing himself on the the diaper. Like many times before when her diaper got full she would usually ask her parents for a change. Some cases, she would leave him in and have her own fun. Though she felt this time she needed a change. She went in where her mom was, in the kitchen. She pulled her shirt, &quot;Mommy, Jeff needs a change.&quot; She then looked down and picked her up. She sniffed her diaper and concluded the same. &quot;Well, it seems so. Let&#39;s get you into a new diaper.&quot;<br />
<br />
Inside the diaper was nice and warm were he was nothing but lumpy remains of his sister&#39;s meal, and it seemed normal around here. He was just relaxing when he was exposed to fresh air where he saw his mom already changing his sister. His mom was busy cleaning her off and putting a new diaper on which he would later be more acquainted with. As soon as that was done, both his mom and sister looked at you smiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s your day been?&quot; Jeff asked his mom, which he wondered how on earth he was able to talk. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve just worked all day. I hear Anna had some trouble earlier at the daycare.&quot; Jeff began to think back, and he soon remembered some kids were picking on him when he was being changed, and Anna got into a fight. <br />
<br />
&quot;They were calling him mean names. I don&#39;t like people when they mess with my brother.&quot; She folded her arms. Though his mom seemed alright with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love the bond you and your sister has, she really likes you, and would fight for you.&quot; She smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;I love my brother, even if he&#39;s poopy all the time.&quot; She giggled and hugged her diaper. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright let&#39;s roll him up and take him to the diaper pail.&quot; His mom did so and wrapped him all up. Anna gave him a kiss and he was then tossed in with his other bodies. With a quick breath, Jeff was reformed into Anna&#39;s next turd which won&#39;t come out for a while.</p>
