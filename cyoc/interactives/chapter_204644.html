<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Maybe... maybe Vexi? B-because it is vexing how-how attractive you are?&quot; Suggested Jeff awkwardly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Vexi... Hmmm, I like it. Vexi. Yeah, that will fit perfectly. It has both sexiness and a mysteriousness to it. Good idea Jeffy&quot; applauded Mariel as she pushed her son up against her body in a tight hug. She then got up and sauntered out of the room to go explore her new closet. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jeff was doing his hardest to fight off his growing erection. How could he be attracted to his own da- mom? But there was no denying it. And it seemed that Mom was not too strict on &quot;boundaries&quot; anymore, with wanting her own son to attend her debut performance. Well, if he was being forced to attend, then so be it. But, he would be attending in a manner of his own choosing. <br />
<br />
As he had no intentions of becoming a &quot;human prop&quot; for his &quot;Mom&#39;s&quot; routine, he would have to attend in a manner where she couldn&#39;t bring too much attention to him directly, or in a form where people wouldn&#39;t recognize him. Basically as incognito as possible. And after racking his brain for a few minutes, it finally dawned on him as to what the perfect manner would be. So he spent some time setting it all up, making sure he thought of everything, every possible risk in doing something like this, and plenty of safety nets incase something went unexpectedly wrong.<br />
<br />
And how would Jeff be attending his &quot;Mom&#39;s&quot; debut performance? Why as her stripper heels of course. That way he will not be discarded as she strips and will be there, literally supporting his &quot;Mom&quot;, for the entire night. He couldn&#39;t think of a more perfect form to be in. <br />
<br />
He had set himself up as a tall pair of pleaser heels initially, but those could slip off if she wasn&#39;t careful. So he went for a much more secure kind of shoe. A pair of ballet heels with locking ankle straps in fact. That way there would be no chance of him ever sliding off her feet mid routine, or being stolen or left behind on accident. <br />
<br />
He did make it so that Mariel could wear him comfortably for months nonstop before she even needed to consider being concerned for her foot health. Sure that span of time was overkill, but it guaranteed that no matter what happened, she wouldn&#39;t get hurt from wearing him at least, and that was the most important part. And if by chance, she happened to lose the key to unlock him, he would automatically unlock after 8 hours, as the lock itself would be fully removed from his design. And he would turn back to normal  once they arrived back home, or 18 hours have elapsed since the initial transformation. <br />
<br />
In addition to that, he and his &quot;Mom&quot; would be able to communicate telepathically and her wearing him wouldn&#39;t hurt whatsoever, regardless of what she stepped on or hit him against. If anything, it would be pleasurable. As she was about to head out, he pressed confirm and ran the program.<br />
<br />
Jeff was forced onto his feet and found himself suddenly in his Mother&#39;s bedroom. Mariel jumped upon seeing her boy suddenly appear before her, but then quickly understood that he had done something, and just patiently stood by and watched. <br />
<br />
Before her, her son split in half, becoming twins, though sharing one consciousness between both bodies. Her &quot;boys&quot; then bent at their waists, and put their heads onto the floor. Jeff could feel his arms suck into his sides, and both of his erections grow nice and hard. Then to his surprise, Jeff felt his legs lift off of the ground before being forced to put his feet together above him. <br />
<br />
Jeff would have fallen over right away, if it hadn&#39;t been for his cock growing to 4 feet in length and pressing into the floor, fully rigid and straight. This was mirrored on his other body too. Then he began shrinking down. As he grew smaller and smaller, his legs flattened into black straps with a metal locking clasp on the side and his cocks thinned significantly until they were just thin rods which turned black and hardened into his soon to be heel spikes. It was then that Jeff felt something unexpected. His assholes gaped, stretching wider and wider while everything else inside of his bodies thinned out of existence, including his necks, which vanished when his heads merged into his shoulders. <br />
<br />
Seeing what her son was doing, Mariel grinned and didn&#39;t wait for his transformation to finish. She grabbed his right body and slid her foot into his asshole, the did the same with his left body. She fastened his straps and stood up. As her son continued to conform around her feet, he was made to take on a much more perfect fit for her feet. And by the end of it all, Jeff had fully become his Mom&#39;s new footwear for the rest of the day as a pair of small padlocks secured his straps shut, and their key fell into the palm of Mariel&#39;s hand.</p>
<hr/><h3>
What does Mariel do now that her son is part of her outfit?</h3>
