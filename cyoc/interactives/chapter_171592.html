<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This essay&#39;s deadline is not until the end of the month but Craig is going to do it already. With the classes canceled and this stall in the coffee shop all for himself, he has enough time to finish this essay and free him up for the rest of the week. That&#39;s a bold talk for someone who has his week open regardless if he did this essay or not.<br />
 <br />
The problem with this essay is he does not know where to start. There is this lump in his mind preventing him from typing the first word, let alone the first idea. He sipped on the warm coffee and allowed it to fill his system with its ichor of life. He stared at the blank word file for minutes. The blinking word cursor is mocking him, spitting in his face telling him that he is too much of an idiot to think of an idea. He needed to write something. Anything. But it just won&#39;t come out. He sipped another coffee. Then another, and another.<br />
 <br />
Too much drinking and it&#39;s making him pee. He left the stall with his laptop for the bathroom. He trusts the barista to keep an eye on his stuff since there are not many people in the shop anyway.<br />
 <br />
Craig relieved himself in the stall as he whistled the tune of a forgotten 80s song. Afterward, he went to the sink where he washed his face. Splashing water might rile up his creativity. His blue eyes stared at him. His cheeks, pink and drenched in water sparkled in the warm lights of the bathroom. He let his face stay like this for seconds. He let the water drip from his strong chin.<br />
 <br />
Craig heard the door behind him open and lock. He looked up to see the new customer in the shop - a guy wearing a blue polo and square-framed glasses. Craig has seen people like him all over the city ever since the storm warnings blared day and night throughout the districts. He paid him no mind but him locking the door was suspicious. The man just stood there, its eyes staring into yards-long nothingness.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Hey man, is everything okay?&quot; Craig asked.<br />
 <br />
The man said nothing. He did nothing. Then suddenly, something poked out of the man&#39;s chest. It was an arm, a long twig arm clawing its way out of the man&#39;s torso. One arm turned into two, then two feet came out. A guy&#39;s head groaned as he slowly, like an alien xenomorph, burst forth from the man&#39;s chest. The guy was naked, his sorry state of a dick hanging flaccid for Craig to see. The naked person breathed for a moment then he set his sights on Craig, who is processing what the fuck just happened.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Wh- what the fuck!?&quot; Craig said. &quot;Stay away from me!&quot;<br />
 <br />
His pleads fell on deaf ears as the guy jumped in the air, pinning Craig on the cold tiles of the bathroom floor. He tried pushing him away but by some unexplainable reason, the naked guy&#39;s arms stuck to his own. His hand fused into his. It sank inside him and left no traces except for the numbness Craig felt on the fused limb. He looked at his left, the same thing is happening on his hand and arms. Below him, the same thing on his legs. He was about to scream but their heads connected into one. The guy&#39;s lips connected with his and made a sick rendition of a kiss.<br />
 <br />
Just as his vision turned to black, an imaginary lightbulb lit inside Craig&#39;s mind. He now has an idea for his essay about the supernatural and extraordinaire. Too bad his body is now the control of this mysterious person, and there is nothing he could do about it.<br />
 <br />
---<br />
 <br />
Alec rose from the ground, still feeling the onslaught of this teenager&#39;s memories. He looked beside him and saw Eric waking up as well. He was asking himself where he is and how he got here. It seems that he had no recollection of the things Alec did in his body. It would be embarrassing if he remembered Alec masturbating with his dick.<br />
 <br />
Alec got out of the bathroom, his head still feeling worse for wear. This guy&#39;s name is Craig - a smart dimwit currently studying at the local university. He is a total neat freak that vehemently hates procrastination and an obsession with the supernatural and paranormal. It&#39;s not a formal club but he is a member of a group of supernatural-obsessed individuals. They go around haunted places in the city in hopes that they can interview ghosts and poltergeists. So far, they found none and that&#39;s why the school board is not legitimizing the existence of their club.<br />
 <br />
Alec closed the laptop and bid his farewell to the barista, whom he somewhat knows from a common colleague. The air outside is a lick of cold wind and the sprinkles of water dripping from the trees. Good thing Craig now has a thick sweater that protected him against the cold. There&#39;s also this headset on his head that is not playing anything. He pulled the cord and saw that it&#39;s not attached to anything. This headphone is just decoration. He hid the headphone in his backpack and returned to his dorm.<br />
 <br />
His dorm wasn&#39;t special or anything. It&#39;s decent and he shares with a guy studying chemical engineering and plays in the local bar. Olivier, as he is called, is mostly out and only comes home during the evening. This left the dorm solely for Alec and this gave him time to inspect his current life.<br />
 <br />
His room is neat but a mess of supernatural posters. &quot;It&#39;s out there!&quot; says a poster with a UFO beaming a cow. There&#39;s a poster with cartoonish ghosts inviting to a Halloween party from 2018. I guess the design fit his aesthetic that he used it as a bedroom poster.<br />
 <br />
Alec opened the wardrobe and found an array of different colored sweaters designated for a day. They all looked similar, aside from the colors. On the side was a stack of underwear that Alex sniffed. They smelled like lemon-scented detergent.<br />
 <br />
After silently judging his host&#39;s lifestyle, Alec went to the bathroom where he feasted his eyes on the reason why he took over this body. He undressed his clothes to see a more than a decent body. Not bad, he thought. Not bad. His abdominal muscles are dense but not defined. He has muscles on arms and legs. His face was devoid of any blemish. Above it, his dust ash hair is somewhat long, but not too long that it reaches past the nape. They formed small curly locks at the edges and the top is matted down thanks to the thick headphones he wore all morning. His eyes are chilly orbs of blue that always had this look of half-opened eyelids to it. Down below, Alec smiled. Dicks like these belong to larger men but lo and behold. It&#39;s thick, dark, and suffocating thanks to his tight underwear. Alec peeled the foreskin and stared in awe at how much it&#39;s growing.</p>
