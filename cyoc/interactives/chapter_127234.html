<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{The nightmare that was the 2017 Christmas retail season is finally over, so I will now hopefully be back to ALL the Moon Lake threads soon.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
Melissa Jenkins basked in the moment.<br />
She was laying upon her boyfriend Trevor Tyson, his thick werebull penis fulling her completely despite the fact she had just ridden it to another fantastic orgasm.<br />
She was now a werecow. HER choice, not that of Moon Lake rules or even any attempts by the sadistic Alice Decrux to ruin her life because her father chose another woman over the were-raccoon.<br />
But better yet. Melissa Jenkins was not only happy, she was in love too!<br />
&quot;Trevor,&quot; she cooed, moving her head just enough to stare deeply into his eyes. &quot;Thank you. For <b>everything!</b>&quot; she added, before passionately kissing him again.<br />
&quot;Mel,&quot; he began, after their lips finally parted. &quot;Even if you are fully over the effects of Decrux&#39;s <i>Love Potion #9</i>, you&#39;re still in an euphoric state from your first transformation.&quot;<br />
&quot;Does it matter?&quot; she wondered, even as Mel began gently moving her hips to encourage Trevor once more. &quot;I&#39;m happy. I&#39;m in love. What more does a woman need?&quot;<br />
&quot;A change of clothes?&quot; Trevor asked in return. &quot;You&#39;re new regular form will be different than how you were before the dance, and I think your father would appreciate it if I had you home before dawn.&quot;<br />
Mel stopped in mid-hip movement and thought about that for a moment. &quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; she realized, as a frown crossed her new bovine features. &quot;But why do I have this continued craving for you? Even after the number of times we&#39;ve done it already, I still seem unfulfilled.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; admitted Trevor. &quot;There are a lot of people who claim a were&#39;s favorite pastime is sex. Then again, like I said, it could just be the euphoria of this being your first time, not only as a were, but no longer being a virgin too. I&#39;ve felt something special for you from the moment we first met,&quot; he confessed to her. &quot;I&#39;m honored to have been your first, and I&#39;m hoping to see you on a regular basis too. Not just for sex, but actual dates and everything.&quot; <i>Yet the more I&#39;m with you, the more I definitely want only you,</i> he realized, but didn&#39;t say aloud.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re very sweet Trevor Tyson,&quot; said Melissa, before kissing him again, &quot;and I definitely want to see you on a regular basis too. Does this mean we&#39;re a couple now?&quot;<br />
&quot;If you&#39;ll have me,&quot; he replied.<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be honored to be your girlfriend.&quot;<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m proud to be your boyfriend,&quot; said Trevor, hugging her close before they kissed.<br />
Then, reluctantly, the couple separated and stood up.<br />
Helping to brush the grass off each other first, they gathered up the discarded Halloween costumes and walked toward the front door of the Tyson house, each holding the other&#39;s free hand while their tails romantically entwined with each other.<br />
<br />
They entered the house quietly, hoping not to disturb anyone.<br />
But the fact that Trevor&#39;s parents were sitting on the living room couch in their fursonas proved that was a lost cause.<br />
&quot;At this point, I think it&#39;d be redundant to ask if you had a good time,&quot; said the werebull that was Jacob Tyson.<br />
&quot;Wonderful is more like it, sir,&quot; commented Melissa, while leaning against Trevor. The fact that they were still holding hands wasn&#39;t lost on the older couple.<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t we go upstairs Mel,&quot; suggested Jacob&#39;s wife Irma. &quot;I&#39;ve got a bunch of old clothes that will probably fit the new you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay Mrs. Tyson.&quot;<br />
&quot;Please. If you&#39;re going to be part of the family, it&#39;s Irma.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. Irma,&quot; said Mel with a little more confidence. She gave her new boyfriend a quick peck on the cheek, then followed his mother upstairs, carrying her borrowed Halloween costume.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit down son,&quot; said his father, once he heard the master bedroom door upstairs close.<br />
Trevor placed his costume on the coffee table then sat down on the sofa, but not as physically close to his father as his mother was.<br />
&quot;So...&quot; began Jacob, trying to find the right words. &quot;What are your plans?&quot;<br />
&quot;To have Mel home before dawn. Apologize to Mister Jenkins if he complains about his daughter being out so late, and be back here as soon as I can,&quot; answered his son.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all well and good, but I was wondering more about your long term agenda.&quot;<br />
&quot;Finish high school and then go on to college for business and agriculture courses to help me better run the farm with you. Remember?&quot; asked Trevor.<br />
&quot;No. I mean, what are your plans concerning Melissa?&quot;<br />
&quot;I love her dad,&quot; replied his son quickly, much to both Tyson&#39;s amazement. &quot;I&#39;ve never met anyone like her before, and I doubt I ever will again. I certainly don&#39;t have the right to ask Melissa until at least after high school graduation at the earliest, but the more I think about it, the more I can&#39;t see spending the rest of my life with anyone but her.&quot;<br />
&quot;How does she feel about you?&quot; wondered his father.<br />
&quot;The same, at least at the moment. We haven&#39;t discussed anything beyond being boyfriend and girlfriend right now though.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know what you&#39;re going through Trevor,&quot; admitted Jacob. &quot;When I first met your mother...&quot;<br />
Then there was a brief pause as his father got lost in thought before continuing. &quot;Anyway, it&#39;s different for you and Mel.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you mean?&quot;<br />
&quot;You sired her.&quot;<br />
&quot;Now wait a moment,&quot; Trevor began to protest. &quot;Mel took her first werecow birth control pill willingly before we—&quot;<br />
&quot;Calm down. That&#39;s not what I meant. I mean that she was a normal and you made her a werecow.&quot;<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t against her will. If anything, I saved her tonight and fulfilled her heart&#39;s desire,&quot; replied Trevor, before telling his father everything that happened during the Halloween dance.<br />
When he finished talking, Jacob Tyson just stared at his son before saying, &quot;I&#39;m proud of you Trevor. You were an honorable gentleman all night, and it&#39;s good to see your mother and I raised you right.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you. I try my best. But Mel is just so special...&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand. I feel the same way about my mate. Just treat Melissa right and come what may, everything will be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
UPSTAIRS...<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s just t-shirts and blue jeans. There isn&#39;t really much call for fancier dresses and formal wear out here on the farm,&quot; began Irma Tyson, while showing Melissa Jenkins the pile of clothing scattered on her side of the bed she shares with her husband Jacob. &quot;But I did do the best I could on short notice.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mrs. Tyson, you have absolutely nothing to apologize for,&quot; said Melissa. &quot;I&#39;m sure these will be just fine.&quot;<br />
The older werecow looked at the latest member of the Moon Lake herd. &quot;You&#39;re right, and remember, it&#39;s Irma. After all, some day the two of you will–&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think Trevor and I are that far along in our relationship yet Mrs.... Irma. We just started seriously dating tonight.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh. Right. But don&#39;t sell either of yourselves short either. Many of us weres believe Moon Lake is a truly magical place where <i>anything</i> can happen. After all, you <i>are</i> a werecow now,&quot; said Irma. &quot;By the way, I love the hint of red in your fur and hide. It goes wonderfully with your normal form&#39;s hair.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks. My mother and father were both natural red heads, and dad&#39;s regained his since becoming a weretiger. Miss McCoy, I mean–Virginia, has even talked dad into attempting to grow a beard,&quot; replied Mel, while sorting through the clothing.<br />
&quot;Really? I heard the two of them were an item since that incident...&quot;<br />
&quot;More than that. They&#39;re engaged and plan to marry during school&#39;s upcoming winter break at the end of the year.&quot;<br />
&quot;Congratulations.&quot;<br />
&quot;Which one can I have?&quot; wondered Mel, going through the clothing.<br />
&quot;All of them, if you want. I know how tough the relationship between weres and clothing can be at times. Most of those outfits are before I had Trevor, so a lot of them don&#39;t fit me very well any more.&quot;<br />
&quot;He was a big boy?&quot;<br />
&quot;Almost eleven pounds. All muscle,&quot; said Mrs. Tyson proudly. &quot;He&#39;s certainly becoming a fine young man too.&quot;<br />
&quot;That he is,&quot; agreed Melissa, smiling as she spoke.<br />
&quot;By the way, are you curious?&quot; asked Irma, while holding out a tape measure.<br />
&quot;Now that you mention it...&quot; said Mel, while catching sight of her new bovine body in the master bedroom&#39;s full length mirror.<br />
<br />
After a few careful measurements...<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a decent D+ cup furry now,&quot; announced Mrs. Tyson, while writing down the rest of the statistics.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Mel in disbelief.<br />
&quot;And still being a growing young lady, I won&#39;t be surprised if you wind up at least an H before you&#39;re legally an adult.&quot;<br />
&quot;<b>WOW!</b> I was barely a B before...&quot;<br />
&quot;Welcome to were society,&quot; said Irma with a smile, &quot;and there&#39;s nowhere to go but up. It&#39;s a good thing us were females don&#39;t need support bras except for modesty, nor do we experience back problems because of nature&#39;s bounty,&quot; she bragged, while briefly cupping her own large bosom. &quot;I&#39;ll measure you again after you&#39;ve changed back and gotten dressed.&quot;<br />
&quot;This is all so new to me,&quot; said Mel, looking at herself in the mirror again.<br />
&quot;I understand. Fair warning. The very first change back won&#39;t involve any physical pain, but emotionally it will seem like a deep loss. Like you&#39;re saying goodbye to a <i>very</i> close and dear friend who you&#39;ll never see again. Don&#39;t let the emotions get to you though,&quot; advised Mrs. Tyson. &quot;Your fursona, as most weres call their other selves, will only be a thought away.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. And Irma...&quot; began Mel, as the other woman started toward the bedroom door.<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; she asked, turning back to face Mel.<br />
&quot;Thank you. For everything.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re very welcome sweetheart,&quot; said Irma, coming back to give Melissa a motherly hug. &quot;And I meant what I said about my welcome to the family. No rush, but if it ever comes to pass, I&#39;d be proud to call you my daughter-in-law.&quot;<br />
Despite still being in her werecow form, Melissa could feel herself starting to blush. &quot;Well I, that is...&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand. The men in our lives are really something, aren&#39;t they?&quot; she asked rhetorically. &quot;I&#39;ll be right outside in the hallway if you need me,&quot; said Irma, before leaving the room and closing the door behind her.<br />
<br />
Melissa Jenkins turned back to the mirror to take another look at her new shape before resuming human appearance again, but there was already the image of a red haired female staring back at her.<br />
&quot;So you can moo now. Congratulations!&quot; said her mirror image, looking at the werecow before her.<br />
&quot;I was wondering when I&#39;d see you again,&quot; replied Melissa in a low voice. &quot;After our chat in the attic before the dance, considering I wasn&#39;t asleep or dreaming...&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; advised the mirror. &quot;Grandma Irma is right. Moon Lake <b>is</b> a magical place.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait. Grandma? That means...&quot;<br />
&quot;You were bound to figure it out eventually <i>mom</i>,&quot; the mirror image said proudly. &quot;What your mother and you call <i>women&#39;s intuition</i> is kind of more like a true psychic talent with me. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t do anything truly amazing like pick winning lottery numbers or lift heavy objects with just the power of my mind. But whatever you want to call my gift has kept me out of trouble and helped out with running the farm by instinctively knowing the right decisions when needed,&quot; the mirror image said proudly, before changing to become a werecow too, although its different hide pattern instantly denoted the other girl as being a totally different person entirely.<br />
&quot;But—&quot; was all the real Melissa could say, despite seeing the proof before her eyes.<br />
&quot;I know the family history because you, dad, and the others have told me chapter and verse so much, I can recite it in my sleep. In fact, the only reason we&#39;re even able to have these conversations is because right now I am asleep on my end. So if I didn&#39;t know better, and I do,&quot; added the mirror image with a wink at Melissa, &quot;I&#39;d swear this is all a dream too. The initial move to Moon Lake and Alice Decrux&#39;s interference were critical periods in our past,&quot; explained the Mirror Werecow, while staring at her mom. &quot;Being the oldest, I couldn&#39;t leave everything to chance that it would all come out like it was supposed to. That might have affected myself, let alone my brothers and sisters.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait. What?&quot; said the real Mel in a state of shock.<br />
&quot;You kept telling me about your <i>Spiritual Adviser,</i> as you called me when all of this originally happened. So when I figured it out, the rest was easy.&quot;<br />
&quot;But what about Trevor, let alone...&quot;<br />
&quot;Grandpa and Grandma Jenkins are still with us, along with Uncle John and Aunt Lillian. Grandma and Grandpa Tyson still maintain the house you&#39;re in now, while the rest of us are in our house elsewhere on the property. Which, by the way, is a lot bigger and more profitable in my time than it is in yours.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait. Wait,&quot; said the real Melissa, trying to clear her head. &quot;What about—&quot;<br />
&quot;Alice Decrux does get her comeuppance, but I&#39;m guessing that hasn&#39;t happened yet, if the display on that clock on the nightstand in the corner is right,&quot; the mirror image said. &quot;Although she was everyone&#39;s biggest problem in the early days, unfortunately I can&#39;t say everything after that was always smooth sailing. You know how life is. But you and Daddy Trevor are still alive and well, and as much in love in my time as you are in yours.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; demanded the real Mel. &quot;What about Spoilers and the risks of—&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry River Song. I&#39;m as much a <i>Doctor Who</i> fan as you are. This won&#39;t be the last time you ever see me before my birth around your second wedding anniversary, but I&#39;m not about to risk any time paradoxes. Place your hand on the mirror,&quot; advised the reflection, while doing the same on her end.<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; asked Melissa.<br />
&quot;Trust me,&quot; said the mirror image with a smile on its face.<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t you at least tell me your name?&quot;<br />
&quot;You and dad spent months going over possible names before I was born, but you&#39;ll know it the first time you hold me in your arms mom. Now, if you want to insure the future happens the way it&#39;s supposed to...&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Melissa, as she slowly raised her right hand.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll keep in touch, and you have a lot of family and friends who love you and will help whenever the need arises,&quot; said the mirror, as a reassuring smile crossed the other woman&#39;s bovine face.<br />
<br />
Melissa Jenkin&#39;s right hand touched the mirror.<br />
What should have been a cold glass surface actually seemed warm to the touch.<br />
That pleasant warmth soon spread across her whole body as Melissa Jenkins closed her eyes.<br />
A smile crossed her own face as she basked in the moment. It was like being cocooned in a warm blanket of happiness.<br />
When she opened them again, Mel was alone in the Tyson&#39;s master bedroom, staring at the plain mirror image of herself: the newest werecow of Moon Lake.<br />
Not recalling anything that might have happened since Irma Tyson left the room, save for admiring her new fursona, Mel turned this way and that, watching her tail swish in relation to her body movements.<br />
Then, recalling Irma&#39;s words, Mel closed her eyes and willed herself back into the form of a regular human being.<br />
It was weird feeling her tail recede back where it came from, let alone the other changes involved in reverting to what she was before her wonderful time with Trevor. The feeling of loss as the werecow disappeared was overwhelming, but Mel took comfort in the fact that her new life was just beginning, and that her fursona was close by and at her beck and call whenever she wanted to be... whole(?) again.<br />
<br />
When she opened her eyes once more, Melissa Jenkins saw her human self in the mirror.<br />
Sort of.<br />
Her hips, while not of young werecow proportions, were more shapely and fuller than before the dance. She was definitely a couple of inches taller and her bosom, by her estimate, was probably either a B+ or a C- cup size now. The tape measure would say for sure when Irma came back into the bedroom.<br />
Her naturally red hair was longer and a bit of a brighter shade than before, and Mel actually blushed when she noticed the greater amount of red hair between her legs above the entrance to her most private place.<br />
<i>This certainly has puberty beat,</i> mused Mel. <i>I&#39;m definitely more of a woman now than I was before breakfast this morning.</i><br />
Then, realizing she had spent enough time in the bedroom alone and shouldn&#39;t keep everyone else waiting for so long, Mel hurried over to the pile of clothing on the bed and started picking out an outfit to wear.<br />
<br />
And somewhere in the future, the daughter Melissa Jenkins-Tyson would one day have smiled in her sleep.</p>
