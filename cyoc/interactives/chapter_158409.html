<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Both boys dressed with the same clothes as the day before due to the fact that they were brand new and that they really enjoyed how they felt. Moreover, they had only wore them for a few hours before they both were stripping down, so it wasn’t like they had the opportunity to show them off. <br />
<br />
Dustin was wearing his titanic US36 sports sandals, which had a combining weight of a 150 pounds. He had asked Ty to add the weight after his brother had mentioned what he had done with his while they were in the shower. His furry cannonball-sized calves were naked, as his tight white dress shorts only covered them up to the beginning of his knees. The piece of clothing did an awful job at hiding the mountains hiding beneath; his thighs, his ass, and his bulge. His cock looked so big it was downright grabbable, like he had a whole bottle of water hiding in his pants. His navy polo looked like it was sawn into him as the hem was as narrow as his waist, though it expanded to cover his ballooning hairy pecs and wide back. The sleeves of his shirt should have rolled up as his titanic biceps were too big for any sleeve, however, as if they were glued, both short sleeves still did their job and with almost no wrinkles, expanded and covered a third of Dustin’s biceps. Additionally, Ty had prepared for him a pair of modern sunglasses and a silver watch with embedded diamonds. He was looking fucking dandy and Dustin loved it. He actually looked like a rich dad, but the god-like version.<br />
<br />
Ty, on the other hand, was wearing his size 51 leather sandals, the same he had his daddy warm up during the night. His feet were not just titanic, but also just like a model’s feet. His toes were long and meaty, and most importantly, extremely powerful. The top of his feet was covered in black hairs which got denser and denser as you kept looking up. His calves were thicker than Dustin’s, but what really stood out was the explosion of muscle that you could notice when looking at his veiny 84-inches-thick hairy thighs. Ty’s shorts were shorter, only covering half of his defined extremely thick quads. His bulge protruded from his crotch as if he had hidden pair after pair of socks inside his pants. You could clearly see the outline of his massive balls and how his 18 inch soft cock rested upon the beginnings of his left leg. Ty’s ass, as well, was massive and easily protruded over a whole foot from his behind. Moreover, since he was so tall, his ass was at the same height as the face of any 5’10 guy. Then, there was Ty’s sculpted-by-the-gods furry torso. His washboard abs were hidden by his thick blanket of manly dark hair, which was further hidden by his slick and tight black hoodie. Not unlike Dustin’s polo, the hoodie narrowed down on his waist which closed tightly against his body. The zipper was only halfway closed, leaving it completely open once it reached his mammoth sized furry pecs. His hairy cleavage was bigger than most girls at hooters and his thick nipples were clearly outlined as well. His sleeveless hoodie gave his godly arms a freedom he loved. The hair from his chest connected with the tuft of manly musky hair exploding from under his arms. In similar fashion to Dustin, his right wrist now held a heavy thick black watch that matched his outfit. He said a no-go to the shades as he was in love of his new vibrant emerald eyes. He did get a piercing on his left ear just to look a tad more modern. Besides, he always wanted to have one. <br />
<br />
Once both boys were readily dressed, they headed downstairs with the aim of eating a lot. After releasing so much cum over the night and now in the morning, both of them were starving. Ty had been eating the same usual meals during the last years and so now craved to taste all kinds of flavors. Once both of them got to the dining room, Dustin saw what Ty had prepared for them.<br />
<br />
The sit-8 common wood dining table they had before had been replaced for a much taller and longer one that could easily sit 20 people. On top of it, laid a fine-crafted white tablecloth. And on top of that, however, was a feast. Trays and plates full to the brim with all kinds of food filled the table. Around it were only two seats, one at each side. Behind the bigger, which was clearly for Ty, and a little bit to the side was Mark, waiting patiently for his sons. He was also accompanied by several carts full of steaming meals.   <br />
<br />
Mark immediately bowed. He could only smile as he saw both of his statuesque kids. They were so big he couldn’t help but get hard as he saw Ty’s massive bubble ass go down on the enormous seat. If it wasn’t for the fact that it looked like a simple chair, Mark knew it could easily be described to be throne-sized. Likewise, Dustin’s pecs bounced up and down as he got comfortable on his chair right at the other end of the table. Hadn’t Ty made those chairs, Mark knew they would have exploded with how heavy they were. <br />
<br />
Despite how long the new table was, Ty and Dustin’s legs were so long they still touched each other’s feet. Right before they started to eat though, Mark crawled underneath the table and kissed Ty’s feet, as he couldn’t do it while he was bowing or while Ty was walking to the table. As Ty got his well-deserved kiss, he opened up his massive legs for a massive manspread and then snapped his fingers so his dad could shove his face against his crotch. Once Mark had gotten to work, Ty smiled at him and messed with his hair as if he was a puppy and then got to eat. <br />
<br />
“You know, I’ve been thinking about where we are going to live”<br />
<br />
“Got any place in mind?” Asked Dustin as he cleaned some of the rice that had fell on his hairy shelf of pecs. It was clear that as the alpha men they were, it was impossible for men of such status to live in something as mundane as suburban home after all.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think the place matters much, as long as it’s in the middle of the downtown area, right?”<br />
<br />
“That makes sense, but then why do you ask where?”<br />
<br />
“Think about it big bro, are we going to live in a mansion? Or maybe I could make something like a gigantic Greek temple”<br />
<br />
“Like Zeus and stuff?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah”<br />
<br />
“That would be sexy, but it would look kinda off if it’s right in the middle of the city”<br />
<br />
“How about in a solid cloud?”<br />
<br />
“Can’t fly”<br />
<br />
“Can make you fly”<br />
<br />
“So… permanent shade for the little people down below? Because I don’t imagine that temple being small”<br />
<br />
“Hmm… I’ll keep thinking about it”<br />
<br />
“So, how big you wanna make it?”<br />
<br />
“How big do you want it to be?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. Massive. I kinda really want to have a big ass family and make you an uncle”<br />
<br />
“You want to be a dad?”<br />
<br />
“I look the part, don’t I?”<br />
<br />
“I mean yeah, you are drop dead gorgeous Dustin, you could have anyone you want, but you want have kids now?”<br />
<br />
“I just feel like I have a lot of love to give haha you don’t like it?”<br />
<br />
“I would love to have a bigger family full of alphas, of course. I just thought it was a bit fast”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I guess, I don’t really know much about how to take care of a kid anyway”<br />
<br />
“How about you get one from our school?”<br />
<br />
“We going back to class?”<br />
<br />
“Only to have some fun, not to really learn anything as I can just make us know all of it and more”<br />
<br />
“So what did you mean by ‘get one’?” Asked Dustin right before crunching the chicken he had in his hands.<br />
<br />
“Pick one of our classmates that you like, a teen, I’ll make him your son. Though any love interests I’ll leave them for you to handle on your own”<br />
<br />
“Hahaha thanks bro. I think I know the right person I want to cuddle”<br />
<br />
“Heard that dad? Dustin is going to make you a grandpa” Commented Ty with a smile as he patted his dad’s head as he kept on rubbing Ty’s cock. Mark really wanted to worship Dustin and show him how happy that made him, but he had to follow orders and couldn’t remove his face from Ty’s crotch. Mark knew he was never going to forget such a manly smell. It was so powerful and musky it made him feel week in the knees. <br />
<br />
Once both boys ate everything on sight and had their big ripped furry bellies full, they stood up ready to go to the mall. Ty wanted to show Dustin his restaurant, but first decided he wanted to pay a visit to Hunter, the little guy who had helped him buy shoes. He wanted him to meet Dustin as he was in dire need of new clothes. “This is going to be fun” thought Ty as he stretched his gigantic limbs, ready to depart.<br />
Due to the fact that the boys were leaving, Mark ran to his boy’s side and kissed their cocks very tenderly and with a lot of love. Both alphas couldn’t help but smile as they saw their daddy down below doing as ordered. After they got kissed goodbye, Ty teleported them both to the entrance of the mall. <br />
<br />
Inside, Ty made sure no one got freaked out. Not because he cared about the people being scared, but because it would be annoying. Thus, from one second to another, everyone in the world knew that a man taller than 8 feet was considered a true alpha, which needed to be respected at all costs. Alphas were also above the law and they could do whatever they wanted. <br />
<br />
As both of them appeared out of nowhere, everyone who was there couldn’t keep the shock from their faces, not only from their sudden appearance but also because of their titanic size. Some people bowed and some even got to their knees, but mostly people just pretended like they hadn’t seen anything. They wanted to stare so badly, but staring was rude, and you couldn’t be disrespectful to a true alpha male like them, so everyone continued with their day without saying a word.<br />
<br />
Ty and Dustin tried to not pay much attention to the common people, though it was clear they loved how people reacted to them as their cocks couldn’t help but twitch as they bounced while the boys walked. The sea of people just parted as the two behemoths walked through the place as if they owned it.<br />
<br />
As they were walking, however, Ty came up with an idea. “As if we owned the place…”<br />
<br />
“Dusty, I think I know where we can make our home, it’s gonna be awesome”<br />
<br />
“Where?” Replied the other giant. <br />
<br />
The voice of both titanic teenagers was deep and low, but at the same time quite loud. People knew better than to listen on purpose to what they were saying though.<br />
<br />
“Here of course!” Replied Ty but not aloud, he said it directly to Dustin’s mind so as the commoners didn’t find out. Dustin knew his brother was quite smart so he replied through his mind as well, hoping his brother had given him the ability to do so. He did. “Here at the mall? I mean, the place is big, but I wouldn’t call it massive”<br />
<br />
“I know. I was thinking on adding a building on top of it. The tallest in the world. Over 500 gigantic floors. Only family, friends, and slaves will have access to it, and the first 30 floors will be the biggest mall in the world.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck, 500 floors? That’s a long ass elevator” Thought Dustin as he went to the back of the line of an ice cream store. As the people who were in front of him noticed the massive shadow he cast, everyone started to give him their place, so as he could be first. Most people didn’t even reach his massive pecs, so they mostly saw a massive hairy shelf of flesh right on top of them. Dustin hadn’t been on the queue for more than 20 seconds when it was his turn already. The girl who worked there didn’t overly react to his presence, she just did her job as best as she could, but Dustin could see the cold sweat on the back of her neck as she did everything to perfection.<br />
<br />
“Come on buddy, of course we would have teleporters installed”<br />
<br />
“Ah, that makes more sense” replied Dustin as he gave an ice cream to Ty<br />
<br />
“Thanks, thanking me all this with ice cream?” Commented Ty with a smirk<br />
<br />
“Nah, I just wanted to do it. Can’t a big bro just buy his little bro some ice cream?”<br />
<br />
Ty just laughed as he finished his cream in two bites.<br />
<br />
“Here we are”<br />
<br />
Said Ty while welcoming Dustin to go in first. Since the store was pretty fancy and expensive, it had the luxury of having high ceilings and a big doorframe, sadly, the doorframe was only 10 feet tall, so Ty had to Duck to get it. He noticed, however, that the store was completely empty with the exception of the one and only clerk he recognized. Apparently, the “leave the story alone” command was still at work, so hence there was no other staff member either. <br />
<br />
“Hey there little guy, remember me?” Said Ty as he approached Hunter who was behind the counter looking like he might pass out any second. <br />
<br />
“Y-y-yes sir! You have… grown”<br />
<br />
“Told you I was in the middle of a growth spurt” Said Ty with a smirk as he approached until he was right in front of the counter. His bulge so big that the base of his cock was just a mere inches from Hunter’s face.<br />
<br />
“This is Ty, my big brother, I kinda took a liking to the way you do things around so I thought you would be great to help him out, right little guy?” Ty asked him while looking down in between his pecs, Dustin now to his side doing the same thing.<br />
<br />
“Of course! Of course! Anything you say sir, I’m… I’m… at your service!” Said Hunter as if he was about to have a nervous breakdown.<br />
“Hahaha, chill little guy” Said Dustin as he patted him on the back and started to led little Hunter to one of the little seats.<br />
<br />
“Bro, can you make the couch here bit sturdier? Don’t wanna freak out the little man by obliterating this thing” Asked Dustin telepathically to Ty.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you try? Just think of it being sturdy enough. I did give you the ability to change reality to some extent”<br />
<br />
“Oh? Didn’t even notice, thanks” Answered back Dustin as he lowered his massive ass onto the little seat. Dustin couldn’t help but show a smug face as he realized the seat didn’t burst into 100 pieces. He sat with his titanic hairy legs spread open as he stretched his feet. Hunter was right in between each leg, looking nervous and a bit scared as well.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you take my sandals off first?” Asked Dustin calmly<br />
<br />
Hunter could only nod after a gulp and then used both hands to remove the leather strap that tied his foot to the shoe. Then, with the utmost effort, he lifted Dustin’s leg so he could try to take his shoe off from the heel, but his leg barely budged.<br />
<br />
“You okay buddy? I don’t like to repeat myself” Said Dustin with an authoritative tone.<br />
<br />
“I’m… I’m so sorry sir, I can’t lift your leg sir” Replied Hunter, you could hear in his voice he could break down in tears any time. An alpha was asking him to fulfil a task and he couldn’t do it, he felt like crap.<br />
<br />
“Awww, come’re little guy” Said Dustin as he took Hunter in a bear hug. Hunter’s cock was hard as steel since the very second he noticed Ty’s silhouette, now he couldn’t help but explode in the warm embrace of the titanic blonde teen. He didn’t notice of course, he just apologized for his incompetence.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry little buddy, I like your honesty” Said Dustin with a smile as he put Hunter down. “Let me help you out a bit then” Added the alpha as he took off his first sandal as if it was nothing and then just let it fall into the store’s floor. The sound it made was very loud and even made the floor shake a little. Like nothing was off though, Dustin continued with the other shoe and did the same thing.<br />
Hunter looked in disbelief, but tried to make himself useful by taking the shoes and arranging them neatly near Dustin’s seat, but as he took hold of one of them, he realized 2 things. First, that the shoe was extremely heavy, and second, that the musky manly smell radiating from the sandals was so strong that he felt weaker.<br />
<br />
Hunter had jacked off all night smelling the shoes Ty had given him yesterday. The smell was so powerful that if it wasn’t because he took a shower at the locker room after going to swim, he would smell just like Ty’s godly masculine feet, as his whole apartment did. There was no room for the smell of food, or the smell for his own clothes, the stink of Ty’s shoes was so overpowering that that was all you could smell at his place, and Hunter loved it. But now, he was faced with an equally manly smell. Different, yet just as delicious. Hunter just wanted to kiss and lick and clean Dustin’s titanic feet, but he couldn’t just do as he pleased. <br />
<br />
“Haha, sorry little guy, I think my shoes weight more than you do, they are 75 pounds each” Said Dustin as he did what Hunter had been trying to do all along.  Of course Dustin’s leg was way heavier than his sandals, but he didn’t want to make feel little Hunter too weak. <br />
Hunter, on the other hand, froze in place when he heard the number, his mind was going crazy while his body was too, as he came for the second time, though he didn’t notice. Hunter was doing everything in his power to not jump into Dustin’s titanic massive feet and worship them, but his massive hairy legs that led into those huge musky powerful boats he called feet were making everything much more difficult.<br />
 <br />
“So?”<br />
Hunter turned around and stared at Dustin’s hairy pecs, too shy to even look him in the eye.<br />
<br />
“You are not expecting that my feet touch the dirty floor, right?” Said Dustin with both of his legs slightly raised into the air, just a couple of inches.<br />
<br />
Hunter’s eyes bulged out for a second as he looking for a solution to the problem. Immediately, without a second thought, the grabbed 2 XL brand new jackets and put them on the floor, right in front of Dustin. <br />
<br />
Happy, Dustin lowered both of his feet onto the big jackets, his feet relaxed while he wiggled his long thick smelly toes.<br />
<br />
A few seconds passed and Dustin asked again. “So?”<br />
<br />
Hunter almost passed out. He really didn’t know what the giant in front of him needed this time, he didn’t know how to please him. Did he need to go get a random pair of shoes? Of course they didn’t have his size, Dustin’s feet were titanic, he had never seen feet as long as his torso!<br />
<br />
“P-Pardon me sir, please. I-I don’t understand”<br />
<br />
“Why, don’t you want to suck my toes, little one? Worship my feet? I thought in a fancy store like this I would get the treatment I deserve” Said Dustin calmly, a cute smile on his face. He was clearly enjoying this.<br />
<br />
For the first time since the guys had shown up in the store that Hunter looked Dustin in the eye. Hunter stared at him blankly for two seconds before he knelt on the floor and started on massaging and licking Dustin’s left foot as if he didn’t have any other mission in life.<br />
<br />
“There you go” Said Dustin as he added a little bit of strength and pinned Hunter to the ground just before adding his other foot, his heel right on top of Hunter’s little dick. He came immediately a 3rd time but kept on worshiping both of Dustin’s humongous smelly feet using both hands.<br />
<br />
Ty on the other hand was busy expanding the size of the already big shopping mall into the biggest in the world. He made it 8 times bigger by making all new buildings create a gigantic circle. Right in the middle of this circle and surrounded by his now owned shopping malls, he added the biggest building in the world. A 1500 meters high building that easily surpassed anything man made in history. Since he didn’t really want to deal with the buildings and residents nearby so he could have room for his god-sized home, he just made the earth expand. He moved every single building in the zone while he just made the whole country grow just enough so he could enough space for his new abode as well as an amazing entrance.<br />
<br />
The god-made building was almost 5000 feet tall, its architecture itself was so grandiose you could only watch in awe, if not in fear. Right down below, at its base, the puny buildings surrounding where Ty’s now owned super malls. The only exception was a bigger building right at the front of his home which he would get to call the ‘reception’. The reception had two entrances, one for all the people living in his godly home, and one for the little people who might have business with anyone living there. Additionally, the mall who used to be surrounded by other edifices and whatnot typical of any city, now only had an entrance of titanic proportions with massive greenery and even a lake to the side. There was a side road that went straight into the basement of the malls so normal people could go and make him even wealthier.<br />
<br />
Ty had no use for money, so he intended on using any earnings he had to help people.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, I’m such a great god” Thought Ty turned on. He was about to summon his dad so he could fuck him when he decided to check on Dustin.<br />
<br />
Dustin was still sitting on the little seat, however, he had his titanic legs bent as he had pinned down Hunter to the ground with his massive feet. He hold him steady while his massive cock head was right in front of little hunter’s face, Dustin’s cock hard as a diamond as he stroked it furiously. <br />
<br />
“I’M GONNA CUUUUUUM” <br />
<br />
Dustin roared as little Hunter stopped sucking one of Dustin’s toes and he opened his mouth wide to receive his seed. Quickly, Dustin thrusted his cock into Hunter’s mouth and just when the massive head of his cock clogged his whole mouth, Dustin released his load like a dam had broken and gallon after gallon he filled little Hunter like a pastry with his hot semen. Dustin even had to remove his big foot from Hunter’s stomach as he realized the little guy needed the room.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, that was fucking nice” Said Dustin as with one arm he reached for another brand new jacket in the rack and used it to clean his cock which was bathed in his spunk. His arm full with bulging veins as he had worked himself a bit after stroking his big cock with so much strength. Dustin couldn’t help but laugh as he threw the jacket covered in semen to the floor and then started to get his cock back inside his underwear and tight shorts.<br />
<br />
“Pretty nice actually, is the little guy okay?” Asked Ty as he approached<br />
<br />
“Yeah he’s okay, I think he’s just in a semen-coma. He’ll come around” Said Dustin as he picked Hunter, who came over 8 times during the whole encounter, and then took him to his chest. Hunter was barely conscious anymore. Too tired to do anything he only said “I love you sir” Right before passing out on Dustin’s right pec.<br />
<br />
Ty’s big brother chuckled and let him rest against his chest while he held Hunter with one arm.<br />
<br />
“I’ll keep him as a slave, he’s pretty cute”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you’ve been needing one since yesterday”<br />
<br />
“By the way, I felt the ground shake a little, what did you do this time?”<br />
<br />
Ty grinned and told Dustin to put his shoes back on.<br />
<br />
“We’ll get you clothes later, let’s go grab lunch at my restaurant while I talk to you about ‘The tower of God’”</p>
