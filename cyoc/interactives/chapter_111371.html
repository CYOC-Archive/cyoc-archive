<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They were still tired from their respective grueling events of the past day, but Samantha and Frances Twist couldn&#39;t deny they enjoyed the meal prepared by Frances&#39; brother Samson Carter. Of course, the fact that Samson had let himself in with the key that was only to be used &quot;in case of emergencies&quot; was another issue, but one that could be dealt with later, for the Twists&#39; adopted son Benjamin and his boyfriend Alex Ramsey had just arrived, all excited about their day at school...<br />
<br />
&quot;She got 150 years!&quot; exclaimed Ben, while setting his stuff down on the sofa and joining everyone at the dining room table.<br />
&quot;Julie Stovall?&quot; asked Samantha, for no one had bothered to check since they got up, and the sentencing hadn&#39;t been announced before they went to sleep.<br />
&quot;Yes. Guilty of 2 counts of violating Statute 1-A,&quot; confirmed Alex, coming up behind his boyfriend after his stuff joined Ben&#39;s on the couch.<br />
&quot;I wonder if the Stovalls tried contacting me while I was asleep?&quot; said Frances, getting up to excuse herself. &quot;When I called Rudy this morning, I had him put them on the office&#39;s emergency contact list through the weekend. Better go check my phone. Be right back,&quot; she added, before giving her wife a quick peck on the cheek.<br />
Samantha couldn&#39;t help watching Frances dash upstairs. The way her hips swiveled as her feline tail swished sexily with every step...<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Ben, you better sit down. Your mom already knows this, but I still have to tell you. Alex, I don&#39;t mind you or Samson being here, since you are both part of our extended family, but what I&#39;m about to say does NOT leave this house!&quot; Samantha said.<br />
It was the first time Ben could recall his mother ever raising her voice in ages, and readily agreed as he and Alex sat down in the empty chairs across from where Frances was, leaving Samson and Samantha on opposite ends of the table.<br />
&quot;Okay Mrs. Twist,&quot; agreed Alex, as Samson shook his canine head affirmatively.<br />
&quot;What is it mom?&quot; asked Ben, concerned something was wrong.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know exactly when this will happen, but everyone at the Town Hall is growing concerned that Mayor Stovall will have to step down because of his daughter and when he does, I&#39;ll become Mayor Pro-Tem, at least until the regularly scheduled election next fall,&quot; revealed Samantha, not mentioning what she already knew about Martin Stovall also resigning because Andrew Curtis had asked him to become the next were-merman representative on the Elders&#39; Council when he retired after all the Council&#39;s business concerning Benton Knight was concluded sometime next month.<br />
&quot;WOW! Really?&quot; exclaimed Ben.<br />
&quot;Congratulations Mrs. Twist,&quot; said Alex.<br />
&quot;Actually, you don&#39;t sound too excited about it Samantha,&quot; observed Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;No word from anyone,&quot; said Frances, coming back downstairs carrying her cellphone. &quot;Guess the Stovalls are trying to come to terms with everything themselves first before possibly calling me. What did I miss?&quot; she asked, while sitting back down next to her wife.<br />
&quot;I was just informing everyone else about my potentially becoming the next mayor of Moon Lake, even if it&#39;s only on a temporary basis, and to answer your question Samson. Truthfully? I&#39;m not,&quot; admitted Samantha. &quot;I&#39;m perfectly happy just being Town Chancellor and only filling in as mayor just when it was absolutely necessary, like if Martin was on vacation or out of town on business.&quot;<br />
<i>Monkey business is more like it,</i> thought Samson, not knowing that Melissa Stovall was less than 2 weeks pregnant and that her husband was seriously trying to mend his ways.<br />
&quot;Who replaces you as Town Chancellor mom?&quot; asked Ben.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know. Choosing my successor will probably be my first official act once my administration begins,&quot; realized Samantha, uncertain who she could get for the job. &quot;My problem is that I&#39;ve already had one district rep try to take advantage of me in hopes of getting his way, and Martin hasn&#39;t even officially announced he is stepping down yet,&quot; she complained, thinking of District 1 representative Arnold Stewart Stevenson hoping she&#39;d swing some of the new elementary school&#39;s construction work toward his company.<br />
&quot;What!&quot; growled Samson, his canine teeth showing fiercely. &quot;Just tell me who and I&#39;ll arrest them so fast..&quot;<br />
&quot;I appreciate the offer, but thankfully I recorded the conversation and gave a copy to Tachibana no Akane, who has promised the Elders&#39; Council will take care of the matter once the more serious issues before them have been dealt with,&quot; said Samantha.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you want us to do mom?&quot; asked Ben, as he reached out and took Alex&#39;s hand in his, since the two of them were the only one&#39;s still in their normal forms at the moment.<br />
&quot;In all honesty I haven&#39;t decided whether or not I&#39;m even going to bother seeking the office outright, although I will have to before the primaries next Spring. Since Town Chancellor is an appointed position to begin with, any opponent I might develop between now and then could try anything to discredit me, <i>especially</i> trying to find something to use against any of us in hopes of hurting me politically, like my friendship with Martin Stovall and my strong support of his administration over the years. So keep your noses clean, but otherwise be yourselves,&quot; replied Samantha, while reaching out to take her son&#39;s other hand. &quot;Politics is a dirty business as it is, so I also wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there are people who might try to use who we are against us.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean being weres?&quot; asked Alex, concerned.<br />
&quot;No. Different as in preferring someone other than what is considered <i>normal</i> to love,&quot; answered Samantha, while taking Frances&#39; paw in her free one.<br />
&quot;They do know it&#39;s the 21st century, right?&quot; asked Samson, realizing part of this conversation might be about the father he and Frances share. The one who disowned his sister once it was discovered she was a lesbian, let alone no longer a virgin when she changed into a werecat instead of becoming a weredog like the rest of the family.<br />
&quot;I think that might come as a major shock to them Samson, so we&#39;ll just have to take this one day at a time,&quot; said Frances.<br />
&quot;Well, whatever happens, you can count on me. I&#39;ve got everyone&#39;s backs,&quot; promised her brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Sam,&quot; said Frances, smiling at him, before she turned to face her wife. &quot;Samantha, have you made a decision yet whether or not you&#39;re going to run for the office yourself?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sort of,&quot; she admitted. &quot;Part of me really wants to, because despite his daughter I don&#39;t want to see all of Martin&#39;s good work go down the drain.&quot;<br />
&quot;I agree. A few of the people who were mayor before him, let alone a couple of the ones that tried to run against him over the years have been real bums,&quot; growled Samson.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; agreed Samantha. &quot;But everyone in this room is MY top priority,&quot; she added, while squeezing Ben and Frances&#39; hands. &quot;I will not do anything that might hurt any of you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry mom. We&#39;re tough and can handle it,&quot; said Ben. &quot;After all, who&#39;d be crazy enough to go against two werewolves, a canine cop, and two ferocious werecats?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know. Then again, most of the people Martin has gone up against prefer sneak attacks rather than physical, directly in your face confrontations,&quot; pointed out Samantha. &quot;So I honestly don&#39;t know yet whether or not I will seek the office outright, but I have until next March to make that decision, so let&#39;s see how January and February go once I am Mayor Pro Tem. Besides, we still have the Christmas holidays ahead of us once school lets out at the end of next week,&quot; she added with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then Samson, what&#39;s for dessert?&quot; asked Samantha, while licking her lips in anticipation, for she knew what was on the menu much later, when she and Frances were alone in their bedroom once more.</p>
