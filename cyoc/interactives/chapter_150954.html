<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He scrolled down the screen and paused. He remembered a beautiful girl he had a crush on, she was a senior at school.  She was a Latina by the name of Dana and Edwin remembered she hadn&#39;t taken any interest in him but instead was always flirting with other Hispanic male classmates. Edwin didn&#39;t know anything about Latino culture but always thought they had it tougher. He was apprehensive of making making his life more difficult for a girl. But he thought, &quot;Maybe if I&#39;m Latino, I could actually ask her on a date, and she&#39;d take an interest in me.&quot; He scrolled to &quot;Latino&quot; and selected it. <br />
<br />
This opened a sub menu which read: &quot;Due to this relativity new feature, and Beta testing, we can only gauruntee selection of sex (male/female), age, reality change or temporary body-only change. Additionally, though rare, users have occasionally experienced irreversible circumstances (mental, lifestyle, body). Due to early testing, you accept these terms : Yes / No. It read like one of those warning in pharmacy drug commercials. Edwin paused. This seemed a little risky for just getting the attention of a girl. He looked around his room, pictures of his family on his nightstand, academic acheivements on his desk, and a pile of unfinished homework  he intended to finish but was too tired to. He then realized he didn&#39;t have any pictures of friends, no girlfriend, nothing. He was lonely and the loneliness nagged at him for a fleeting second before he said, &quot;fuck it, whatever, I&#39;ll give it a try&quot; and selected Yes. <br />
<br />
The next menu allowed him to select sex, age, and reality repercussions. He chose &quot; male&quot;, and looked at the age for a bit.  &quot;I&#39;m 16 right now, she&#39;s probably 18, I want a serious, more mature relationship&quot;, he thought. He changed his age to 23, wondering what it would feel like to be older and then chose &quot;reality change&quot; because he wanted Dana to be the same age. After all his changes were selected, he clicked &quot;Transform&quot;. A similar warning popped up again, and Edwin selected Accept. He waited with anticipation, his heart racing, excited that he and Dana might have a fresh start in this reality. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when it hit him. His body felt hot, like he had a crazy fever all of the sudden. He was sweating, he got off his bed. When he got off his bed, he thought he felt a pang of vertigo and his bones cracked. His back was killing him as he stared at his bookshelf which was formerly at eye-level, and now a touch lower.  His pant legs raised to &quot;high water&quot; pants. He gasped as he realized he must now be 5&#39; 5&quot;, growing 4&quot; in seconds. Still sweating, he tore off his clothes while scrambling to his Chronivac to see if he could pause it for a second. It read &quot;Error&quot;. <br />
<br />
Edwin became anxious, thinking &quot;I wonder what will happen to Diego... I mean, Dana, wait, who the fuck is Diego?!”  He ran back to his mirror. The changes were speeding up as he stood there naked, trying to observe every one of them. His formerly pale skin darkened to a beautiful carmel brown. His hair became more coarse and slowly changed to a jet black color, with a neatly trimmed skin fade and fashionable side part that was shiny, thick,  and smelled of Suavacito pomade. &quot;Meirda!&quot; He clapped his hands over his mouth, surprised that he naturally spoke Spanish and that his voice sounded two octaves lower. He looked closer at his face. His pimply skin smoothed into a beautiful brown complexion with dark circles showing slightly under his eyes and cute dimples near the side of his mouth as he smiled. A well groomed dark beard appeared, disconnected from his haircut, giving him a young, sexy look. He hated having a beard but kept it because he became self-conscious due to his brothers&#39; teasing him for not having enough Machismo,  calling him a &quot;fag&quot;, and being an embarrassment to his Catholic Mother. He grimaced as the memory passed over him, pursing his now plumper lips, and his now dark,  thick and strong eyebrows. Then shock registered- &quot;Soy gay?!&quot; The thought was momentary as he noticed his hands were becoming smaller, his face thinning, becoming... less boyish and more mature. His baby fat disappeared from his torso and he could see his ribs and viens popping out on his arms. His teeth were less straight and off-white then they were previously as he now realized he&#39;d never had braces before because his familia couldn&#39;t afford them supporting his three younger brothers.  His arms became larger, defined  and veiny but not gaudy. His chest inflated some, after all the time he put into el gimnasio daily. An Eagle, Globe, and Anchor tattoo appeared faded on his chest. New thoughts entered his mind, he was accepting his name was now Eduardo or &quot;Eddy&quot; as his friends called him. He was 23. He moved in with his Dad after he&#39;d done his 5 years in the Marine Corps, a temporary fix while he looked for a better paying job in town. His Mom split and moved back to Mexico with his other relatives after he&#39;d come out of the closet two years ago.  He paused a second and looked down. Eduardo didn&#39;t know if it was hormones or his realization that his cock didn&#39;t resemble it&#39;s previous form, but it grew hard and longer, the sensation almost made him cum. As the skin grew over his previously uncircumcised penis, a tingly feeling ran through his body and he shivered. He noticed the neatly trimmed hair around his now uncircumcised,  7 inch, crooked-shaped penis . He couldn&#39;t tell if it was his newly found horniness but Eduardo let go as he slid his hand to his darkened nipple. He moaned, surprised with the sensitivity and elation it brought, encouraging his hardened cock to pulse with pleasure. He continued sliding his hand down his now hairless chest, feeling additional muscle that wasn&#39;t there before and onto his cock. The feeling of foreskin was incredible and drove him to pump harder. He slid his other hand to his butt, feeling the beautiful curve of his ass that all those squats carved out. His middle finger grazed his hole and he let out another gasp, picturing Diego&#39;s finger there instead, like when they first started experimenting in the showers back in the Marines. His lips quivered and he bit his lower lip, eyes closed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, I see you&#39;re a little excited tonight&quot;, Diego said with a coy smile, walking through the bedroom door and quickly shutting it. Eduardo turned around, startled. &quot;Where&#39;d you come from?!&quot;<br />
 &quot;Work, mi amor, where else? I know I told you I was gonna be here an hour ago but our asshole jefe needed me to stay longer&quot;, he said, taking off his shirt and throwing it on their bed. Eduardo was shocked, a headache hit him as new memories flooded his mind, his eyes taking in his new room which now had peeling paint in a corner, a nightstand with a tilted mirror reflecting not his academic acheivements but Marine Corps plaques, and awards, dogtags appeared around his neck. On his walls were pictures of both he and Diego in full dress uniform, holding hands. They both left the service, wanting to try life together, not married but dating for the last three years. Diego&#39;s shirtless chest reveled what looked like healed wounds which Eduardo remembered he helped heal as a medic in the Marines for his Infantry man, and more tattoos covering his right pec and all the way down his right arm to make a beautiful colored sleeve tattoo. While Eduardo looked decidedly of Mexican heritage now, Diego looked a little lighter, maybe Brazilian, Puerto Rican?  He couldn&#39;t determine which. Eduardo&#39;s mouth was agape, looking on in both shock and extreme horniness. Diego smiled, &quot;you want to have some fun amor?&quot; Eduardo nodded, walking almost automatically to his boyfriend, helping with his belt. Eduardo looked into Diego&#39;s eyes and knew with certainty he was in love as their lips locked and they fell sideways onto the bed, embracing each other, naked, dogtags clanking as they tussled.  They lay there, kissing and looking at each other, cocks rubbing against one another. He too was uncut, his mushroom head slightly larger,  and penis not as long but slightly thicker than Eduardo&#39;s. Eduardo&#39;s hand traced the familiar muscular curves of his boyfriend and around his ball sack, which made Diego growl in horniness.  &quot;You ready baby?&quot;, Diego whispered. &quot;Si, papi,&quot; Eduardo said with a joking smile at the phrase. <br />
<br />
Eduardo was beyond aroused, the former memory of himself distant, a day dream perhaps. His dick was erect and pulsing in anticipation of what would come next.  Diego manhandled him onto all fours, Eduardo&#39;s head testing on the pillow. He felt a pleasurable, and familiar tongue tickle his hole, which sent waves of pleasure up Eduardo&#39;s spine, giving him Goosebumps. Diego flipped Eddy back over, moving forward, his cock inches from Eddy&#39;s face. Eddy instinctively opened his mouth and let all 6.5&quot; of cock in his mouth, gagging while Diego grabbed his head by Eddy&#39;s hair to drive his head to the hilt of his shaft. Diego shivered as the pleasure rose but didn&#39;t want to waste his load yet. Diego sat back and moved to raise Eddy&#39;s legs. Diego was on his knees, spitting on his hand and rubbing his now engorged, wet cock. He did so again and used his middle finger to stimulate Eduardo. Eduardo gasped and moaned in total extasy, His head arching back unwillingly, looking at the bed headboard, which had a Mexican flag and a pride flag draped over it. He looked back at Diego who now held Eduardo&#39;s legs on his shoulders. Never had Eduardo imagined such pleasure as  Diego&#39;s penis thrust inside of him. Never had he felt so safe, so loved, so secure with another person. With all of the hate his family threw at him,  Diego and Eduardo were now one, and he felt incredible and safe. Thrust after thrust, new memories of their time in Iraq together, their sharades in their platoon, his younger brothers shunning him and leaving with their Mom to Mexico. Spanish became his dominant language and his thoughts flowed in Spanish. He moaned to Diego, &quot;faster mi amor!&quot;, he shouted with a heavy accent, &quot;rápido mi amor!&quot;.  &quot;Aye papi, si papi!!&quot;. Diego&#39;s beer-can-thick penis moved inside of him, every vein in his dick hitting his male G-spot, and eventually, with a final groan from Diego, Eduardo could feel warm cum filling his insides, like part of Diego was now a part of him, changing him, somehow sealing his newfound life as a second generation Mexican-American, and any memory of a previous life as Edwin seeped out like the cum from his asshole. They made love in their bed and eventually passed out in each other&#39;s arms. <br />
<br />
Eduardo woke up to the sound of the neighbor&#39;s dog barking outside, and the train shaking his Dad&#39;s modest apartment as it passed. Strange but familiar gupera music filled the downstairs, the tin of Mexican trumpets and Fritos filling the stale, cum-smelling air, as his Dad made breakfast for the two. He remembered his Dad loved him and supported his relationship with Diego, even defending him when his older brothers scorned him, called him a fag. That memory brought a weird sadness upon him  that washed away as fast as the smell of tamales, eggs, and bacon did. &quot;That&#39;s weird, I don&#39;t remember having a train nearby, where are we?&quot; , he thought. He opened up his phone, all the prompts en Español. He navigated them easily and another migrane attacked his head as new memories overwrote his old ones. He opened up maps on his iPhone, which had seen better days and was in an old Marine Corps themed case. The blue dot, his location, didn&#39;t immediately make sense, he zoomed out- &quot;Los Angeles?!&quot;, he quietly exclaimed not wanting to interrupt  Diego&#39;s snoring. He was so cute when he slept.... He then remembered both he and Diego left the service when they were stationed at Camp Pendleton just down towards San Diego. &quot;Mios Dio&quot;. He didn&#39;t fully understand why his voice sounded different but it did, more gruff, like he was a smoker. He looked over and noticed a half empty carton of smokes next to his bed and immediately craved one. He looked on his phone and noticed multiple conversations with friends including some dick picks from who knows where, a lot of meetups in West Hollywood, a few notifications on Grindr - &quot;Are we in an open relationship?&quot;, he thought for a second, grabbing a smoke instinctively inserting it in his mouth, followed by a lighter, then back to the phone- a lot of pictures of both he and Diego in jock straps at a bar. &quot;Wait&quot;, he thought, &quot;We&#39;re Gogo dancers?&quot; Confusion passed as the thoughts were confirmed in his subconscious, gone as the smoke left his lips. A day before, he wouldn&#39;t have even known what a GoGo was, but that was a previous life, one that barely remained.  He remembered he needed employment shortly after the Corps and used his muscular appearance, cute features, and desire to be  involved in the LGBT community to go earn money dancing and stripping at bars with Diego. He looked over and saw a wad of crumpled dollars and a Mexican flag jock strap next to a device that looked strangely familiar. &quot;Que es esto?&quot; He said, rising from the bed, his morning wood catching on the sheets. It read Chronivac. He pressed a button and it lit up....</p>
