<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alyssa squirmed in the driver side passenger seat as Lilith watched the road while driving, occasionally glancing over at her daughter seeing what she was doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alyssa, can you please not fidget in your seat so much? Your making me a little nervous.&quot; Lilith asked her daughter as she watched the road exit signs as she drove by them.<br />
<br />
Lilith and Alyssa were in their car driving to meet up with Caleb Moreland and talk with him about the church. Eliana had never been to Caleb&#39;s home out of fear of safety for her daughter, but Lilith wanted to go and see Caleb personally to thank him for what he did for her daughter. Alyssa had only met Caleb Moreland once before and had gotten a good vibe off of him, but still what her mother&#39;s ex-girlfriend had told her made her feel a little uneasy about meeting this man again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure this is even a good idea mom? I mean, doesn&#39;t the church keep tabs on people who work for them, like spies or whatever? How do we know they don&#39;t have someone watching their place right now?&quot; Alyssa asked sounding a little worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Caleb Moreland and his family are many things, and the one thing I know for sure about them is that they&#39;re honest and good people. Plus, they don&#39;t agree with everything the church does. Like for instance keeping on that Ezekiel bastard after he did a bunch of fucked up things and just waved their fingers at him before kicking him out when he went too far.&quot; Lilith said whilst shaking and her head and Alyssa heard the anger in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, grandpa was a fucked up guy.&quot; Alyssa commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was a fucked up man, but that man was not and will never be your grandfather, and he wasn&#39;t my father either. A parent is supposed to love you, raise you, take care of you, be there for you when the world seems like it&#39;s against you. That man is not part of our family anymore. You and I are going to bring back the good name to the &#39;Kane&#39; name.&quot; Lilith said holding back her tears.<br />
<br />
Lilith now noticed the road to turn off and drove down it. Alyssa and Lilith watched as they went from the smooth asphalt road went to a more gravel one, before the road finally became a dirt path.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boy, talk about living out in the sticks, I thought where we lived was far from civilization.&quot; Alyssa commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;They just like their privacy and their family is more country folk as you probably remember from Caleb&#39;s accent. Which reminds me, when we see them, don&#39;t make fun of the way they talk or anything like that.&quot; Lilith said as they drove close to the house, but a little far away.<br />
<br />
As Lilith and Alyssa got out of the car, they noticed that the place was relatively quiet, even though there were some cars in the driveway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello! Any yokels out here?!&quot; Alyssa called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alyssa!&quot; Lilith hissed at her daughter with a glare as she blushed a little immediately forgetting what her mother had said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry mom.&quot; Alyssa blushed.<br />
<br />
Before either Kane woman could do anything, two spotlights turned on in front of them and they heard the voice of a woman calling out from the porch as she pointed a gun at the woman, as did a woman next to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! It&#39;s just me, Lilith Kane, and my daughter, Alyssa. We just....we just wanted to come here to talk to Caleb.&quot; Lilith called out as both she and Alyssa held up their hands in surrender.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well as I live and breath, Lilith Kane herself back from the dead.&quot; Charlotte Moreland said as she lowered her gun. &quot;Chase, Andromeda, it&#39;s alright, these two are old associates of ours. Well, at least Lilith is.&quot; Charlotte Moreland said as both Lilith and Alyssa were turned around to see a young man who looked in his twenties standing beside a beautiful young woman who looked his age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, we weren&#39;t expecting any company and we have sensors set up half a mile back down the road to let us know when someone&#39;s coming by car.&quot; Chase Moreland explained to the two Kane girls. As Chase was talking, Alyssa was looking at the girl standing next to her with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you&#39;re really beautiful,&quot; Alyssa complimented Andromeda. &quot;Are you two already married?&quot; Alyssa asked as both Chase and Andromeda now blushed a little on their faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thanks, we&#39;re....we&#39;re not married. Not right now anyway, we&#39;re just dating, but....I&#39;m Andromeda Tepes, a princess of the vampire nation. This is my boyfriend, Chase.&quot; Andromeda explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Moreland dating a vampire, and a princess at that? I never thought I&#39;d see the day.&quot; Lilith said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Life has a way throwing curve balls.&quot; A voice said as Alyssa and Lilith turned to see Caleb Moreland being led by a woman that Alyssa assumed to be his wife with a man younger than him walking with a cane and another woman walking beside him who she guessed to be his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilith Kane, Eliana told me that you were back. You don&#39;t have to explain how, I&#39;m just happy to see you alive.&quot; Caleb said holding out his hand to shake hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, but we came here for a few reasons, namely....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To ask you why the hell you&#39;re still working with assholes that wanted to train me and be their own personal lap dog?&quot; Alyssa asked crossing her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alyssa!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No mom, they think they have some holier than thou morality, but from everything I&#39;ve heard, they don&#39;t know shit.&quot; Alyssa grimaced at her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it Alyssa found out what the church had in store for her.&quot; Caleb guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Annie Pendragon visited me and told me she personally came to you and asked she put Alyssa into hiding. I wanted to thank you for that.&quot; Lilith nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a bit more complicated. Found out years ago about you Lilith, the last survivor of the Kane dynasty. The girl who didn&#39;t know any of her history. Then you had Alyssa over here. When you passed, I realized taking her from the only family she knew was wrong. That&#39;s why I kept your location a secret. As far as the church knows, Alyssa is dead. She deserved a shot at a regular life. You won&#39;t have to worry about the church again.&quot; Caleb stated. Lilith looked Caleb up and down, as well as Connor and sighed before continuing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that....that actually brings me to my next question I wanted to ask.&quot; Lilith said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry Amberhill. Eliana and I both know that he still wants Eliana&#39;s land and will no doubt be coming after us. But you&#39;re clearly in no shape to go all Conan after them anymore.&quot; Lilith partially joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s Conan mom?&quot; Alyssa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind Alyssa. My question is, even with the four of us there, how can we be assured you can still protect us?&quot; Lilith asked as Caleb gave a deep sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately I&#39;m still recovering. Probably won&#39;t be a 100% for a while, but my brother Connor here is more than capable of handling Amberhill. You can trust me on that&quot; Caleb reassured her.<br />
<br />
Alyssa looked both Caleb and Connor Moreland over and seeing their bodies and how they stood up to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, are you sure these Moreland men know what they&#39;re doing? They seem a little stubborn.&quot; Alyssa asked as Caleb&#39;s wife, Gloria, Connor&#39;s wife, Spark, and Chase&#39;s girlfriend, Andromeda all laughed at that comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moreland men are notorious for being the most lovable stubborn men we know. Trust us when we say that my husband will make sure you&#39;re in good hands.&quot; Spark Moreland said to Lilith and Alyssa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you. Thank you Caleb. I don&#39;t know how I can ever repay you for protecting my daughter.&quot; Lilith said holding Caleb&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just do two things,&quot; Caleb smiled. &quot;Raise Alyssa right and enjoy your time together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Done and done.&quot; Lilith replied as she reached over and carefully hugged Caleb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful Caleb, the doctors weren&#39;t exactly thrilled you checked out to begin with.&quot; Gloria cautiously warned holding onto Caleb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I&#39;ll be fine. You worry too much.&quot; Caleb said brushing it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s only because I love you so much.&quot; Gloria replied back as they walked back to their house.<br />
<br />
&quot;However I can help, I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re all protected I swear it to you.&quot; Connor said to Alyssa and Lilith who nodded in approval.<br />
<br />
Although Lilith was a little unsure just how well Connor Moreland could carry out his promise, she knew a promise from the Moreland family was definitely one well kept.</p>
