<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay Mary,&quot; Samantha said. &quot;I&#39;ll go along with the plan but to you think you can actually control this. If I&#39;m right in about five minutes we won&#39;t even be legal adults anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary glanced at the clock. Samantha was right she needed to halt her original wish before anything else could be done. &quot;Okay here goes nothing,&quot; she said happily. &quot;I wish we would all stop slowly getting younger every hour.&quot; Glancing down at the ring Mary could see a soft glow emanate from the gem. &quot;I think it worked now we just wait and see.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group of teens now anxiously watched the clock click forward curious to see if Mary had halted their regression. After twenty minutes of clock watching with no tingling and no signs of physical regression they let out an audible sigh. &quot;Well that&#39;s a relief,&quot; Claudia stated. &quot;Guess that ring really can control ages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Mary,&quot; Mika said. &quot;So what do you have in mind for this morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary smiled as she looked at the group. &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking,&quot; she stated. &quot;We should try out a bunch of different ages throughout the day. Their are six of us so why don&#39;t we each choose an age to be. If it&#39;s ok I&#39;d like to go first.&quot; The girls all nodded in agreement with Mary&#39;s plan. &quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; Tricia said. &quot;So how old you want to be this morning?&quot; Mary anxiously looked around the room, while her friends were open to the idea she wondered about how they would take the age she had decided on. &quot;I was thinking maybe we could become twelve again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twelve,&quot; Samantha exclaimed. &quot;Jeez Mary why so young?&quot; Mary bit her lip as she looked at her friend. &quot;Well I still remember our first sleepover fondly,&quot; she said. &quot;I was thinking we could have a chance to relive that a little. Plus it would give us a chance to pig out on some of the sugary stuff I have that we would never touch now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group looked at Mary curiously before looking over each other. The idea of returning to first grade frightened them slightly, after a few moments though they sighed and gave Mary an accepting look. &quot;Ok,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;We&#39;ll go with your plan. Just as long as it&#39;s not all day, I mean reliving your childhood for a couple hours could be fun but I don&#39;t want to be stuck like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary smiled broadly as she looked at her friends. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said gleefully. &quot;Well here goes nothing. I wish we were all twelve years old again.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group looked anxiously at each other as Mary&#39;s ring began to glow. &quot;So how long is this going to take.....Oh.&quot; Claudia exclaimed as a tingle spread over her body. The other girls had similar responses as they swooned slightly. As they recovered they looked at each other curiously. &quot;Hey did you guys feel that,&quot; Mika exclaimed. &quot;Yeah that was weird,&quot; Tricia stated as she rubbed her arms. &quot;My whole body felt like I got shocked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika paused as she looked at Claudia. &quot; uh Claud,&quot; she said cautiously. &quot;Did you get shorter?&quot; Claudia looked at her friend curiously before noticing that the height difference between the two seemed to have lessened. &quot;Quick lets check out the mirror,&quot; she exclaimed as she rushed into the hallway. The group followed closely as they gazed at their reflections. The group no longer looked 18 anymore, they looked closer to 17. Another tingle spread through the group as they watched themselves shrink down to 16.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe it,&quot; Samantha exclaimed in a youthful voice. &quot;It&#39;s actually working, we&#39;re.....we&#39;re getting younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group watched their transformation intently as they began the slow descent back through high school. The high school sophmores ran their hands over their young bodies ran as they adjusted their ill fitting clothes. Another tingle spread over the group as they dwindled to a group of fresh faced high school freshmen. &quot;This is incredible,&quot; Claudia exclaimed as she adjusted her ill fitting nightie. &quot;Look at us were barely old enough to be in high school now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um Mary,&quot; Tricia exclaimed as she cleared her throat. &quot;Can me and Sammy get something to wear. Our clothes are getting too big.&quot; Mary glanced over at the young black teen and her brunette friend. Both girls were trying in vain to hold up their increasingly loose jeans. Looking at the others Mary thought it best that they should all find something to wear. &quot;Yeah follow me,&quot; she said as she adjusted her loose clothing. Another tingle spread through the group leaving them young 14 year olds. Samantha and Tricia&#39;s jeans gave up the fight and cascaded down their coltish legs. The others suppressed a giggle as they examined their own bodies. The girls were now in that awkward phase of adolescents, on the verge of growing up but still children. Unhappily the group grasped their dwindling breasts that were slowly receding into their bodies. &quot;Maybe we should all find something else to wear.&quot; Mary exclaimed. &quot;We all look like we&#39;re about to fall out of our clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group now ran to Mary&#39;s room as they shrank to 13. Tricia and Samantha left their shoes behind as they ran while the others found themselves trying to hold their clothes on their waifish bodies. Mary reached into her dresser producing six shirts for the girls to wear. Quickly the girls disrobed and now stood in Mary&#39;s bedroom sporting tshirts that acted as nightgowns. &quot;This is actually kind of cool,&quot; Samantha exclaimed as she kicked off her overly large socks. &quot;Speak for yourself,&quot; Claudia grumbled. &quot;At least you guys still have boobs I&#39;m flat as a pancake over here,&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls looked at the mortified blonde and giggled. Claudia once prominent breasts had been reduced to two small mounds on the young girl. &quot;We&#39;ll if it&#39;s an conciliation none of us are going to have boobs in a minute,&quot; Mary exclaimed as she watched her once impressive breasts shrink down to softball size. &quot;Just wish the shirts covered more of us,&quot; Tricia exclaimed as she pulled the shirt down trying to cover herself. &quot;I don&#39;t want to show off my panties.&quot; &quot;Pretty sure that won&#39;t be an issue in a few moments,&quot; Mika said as the group shrank down to 12.<br />
<br />
The young preteens watched each other in wonder.   &quot;I can&#39;t believe how short we are now. Your room is starting to look huge Mary.&quot; Samantha said as she touched what was left of her chest as it dwindled to a pair of small bumps.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just thankful I still have a little something up top,&quot; Tricia gleefully stated as she stuck out her small chest. &quot;I remember you guys teasing me mercilessly about developing early. So what do you think now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia and Mika looked at the young black girl enviously as they looked at their preteen bodies. Both girls were bodies were devoid of any adult assets and found themselves to be the shortest girls in the group. &quot;Laugh it up beanpole,&quot; Claudia said glumly. &quot;Those bee stings won&#39;t be there much longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls giggled, most of them devoid of the blessings of puberty.  Mary gazed at her reflection noticing the freckles she so despised as a child returning to her face. &quot;Ug I look like Ronald McDonald now,&quot; the fair skinned red head groaned. &quot;I don&#39;t know i think their cute,&quot; Mika squeaked, &quot;I always did. You were always such a cutey Mary and besides your the one that wanted this so guess you have to deal with it.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Mary glanced around to the other girls now.   &quot;So, what shall we do?&quot;</p>
