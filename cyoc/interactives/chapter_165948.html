<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the initial excitement, the party gradually returned to a more normal state. Unless you were Ophelia that is. Ever since the second she sat down in the booth, she had literally caused a line to form with guests wishing to meet her. Some asked her about her clothing, while others wished to hire her on as a model. However, the vast majority were there wanting to ask her out, propose to her, invite her to their residence for their &quot;private after party&quot;, etc... For the first few people, she simply declined politely, saying she already was dating someone. But that too started to be less and less effective as more and more alcohol was comsumed by the guests. A few even told her she shouldn&#39;t waste her time with her current partner,  and insisted that she would be far happier with them. Surprisingly, a number of them were women too, and they also were by far the more bolder. One older lady even tried to offer her a marriage with her 12 year old nephew, saying that she could babysit him until be was old enough to marry her. Heather had even laughed at that one.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Heather, much to Ophelia&#39;s relief, she didn&#39;t seem to be getting mad or hostile with the seemingly endless line of &quot;potential suitors&quot; as she called them. It actually seemed like she was satisfied with her girlfriend being constantly asked out right in front of her. &quot;Make sure you don&#39;t enjoy this too much Sis, or Opheliamay actually dump you for one of them&quot; cautiously reminded Lexi, seeing her sister&#39;s unusual delight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not gonna ever happen. Both she and I know for a fact that she belongs to me, and me alone. Furthermore, there isn&#39;t a single thing that anyone can do about it either. So I am nkt worried in the slightest. The reason I am enjoying this so much is because I get to see my most prized possession being sought after. With so many people here having acknowledged her beauty, how could I not be happy and proud for her. She is and will always be enough for me. So if she is being praised, I also share that joy with her, as both her loving girlfriend and owner&quot; explained Heather, absolutely beaming with pride and support for her girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. I don&#39;t know if that was sweet, sexy, or concerning. So I will take it as something both of you fully understand, but that is also complicated for others to do the same&quot; compromised Lexi. She was only slightly concerned with Heather&#39;s blatant objectification of Ophelia. But knew her sister well enough to know that it was just her inner dom comming out a bit. So she just left it at that and continued enjoying her party.<br />
<br />
[Damn this is so annoying. Is there ever going to be an end to them?] Thought Ophelia to herself. [I wish Beldazarr was here so I could just wish Me and Heather out of here without being rude to Lexi or her guests.] Suddenly, she noticed a rather heavy weight resting on her lap. Glancing down, she realized she was holding Beldazarr&#39;s lamp. Thankfully the tablecloth blocked everyone&#39;s view of it. <br />
<br />
[Can you hear me Beldazarr?] Thought Ophelia, trying to see if he could her here thoughts. <br />
<br />
[I can Mistress. Are you in need of my assistance?] She heard in her mind. <br />
<br />
[Yes. Thanks for comking here. I wish me and Heather could leave the party without anyone being disappointed or sad at out departure, especially Lexi.] Requested Ophelia. <br />
<br />
[I will do what I can to help you Mistress. Granting your wishes is my current purpose after all] thought a prideful Beldazarr. <br />
<br />
Suddenly a loud snap echoed throughout the banquet hall, as Beldazarr&#39;s magic began its work. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you guys, didn&#39;t you have somewhere you needed to be soon?&quot; Suddenly chimmed in Lexi. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? We do?&quot; Asked a confused Heather.<br />
<br />
Ophelia slightly tapped her heel on Heathers leg, causing her to look down, seeing the lamp resting in Ophelia&#39;s lap. Putting 2 and 2 together, she quickly remedied her previous response. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, we did. I&#39;m so glad you reminded us. I am sorry we have to bail early though. Enjoy the rest of your party though.&quot; She said, leaning over to give Lexi a hug goodbye. Ophelia got up first, and moved aside so Heather could leave the booth. After which she slid back in and also said her goodbyes to both Lexi and Kyla. However before she was able to leave, Lexi had quickly kissed her lips, and Kyla slipped one of her business cards into her cleavage so that she could get in contact later. Kyla actually was the only other being besides Heather and Ophelia who was not affected by the magic. And as Ophelia gave her a hug too, she whispered in her ear &quot;That was an excellent use of a Djinn&#39;s magic dear. Subtle but practical. I love it. Please just remember to make sure you protect that lamp, or anyone could take it from you. I am glad we were able to meet tonight. In all my time spent here, you guys are the very first people which I have ever wished to get to know better, well, following my husband of course. Enjoy that girl&#39;s big dick you horny bitch. You can tell me all about it later, okay?&quot; After saying that, Kyla gave Ophelia a wink, while she skillfully dragged a finger across one of Ophelia&#39;s nipples in such a way that only the 2 of them would ever know that she did it.<br />
<br />
A bit taken aback by her forwardness, Ophelia simply stared at her for half a second, but then smilled, happy that someone else existed which she could brag to about her mate. Kyla just returned the smile, though hers was more of a satisfied grin which only deepened her aura of maturity and sexiness.<br />
<br />
Finally leaving the party, Hearher and Ophelia quickly ran to the nearest jewlers to solidify Ophelia&#39;s place beneath Heather. Entering the store, she was shown to a display of the various bands she could choose from, as well as a display containing the gemstones available.<br />
<br />
Beldazarr chimed in again inside both of their heads this time. [If I may suggest an idea I had, why not enchant the choker to do a specific effect based on the gemstone you pick to wear that day?]<br />
<br />
[Sounds fun] thought Heather. &quot;We will take one of each stone miss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pardon?&quot; Said the women, not believing she heard her correctly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you bring us one of each of the gemstones on display here please, we wish to buy them.&quot; Echoed Ophelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;C-Certainly, one moment please.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she left for the back room for a minute. After which, she brough out a small bag containing one of each of the many different gemstones. &quot;This will be rather expensive, so I will add a band free of charge. Did you have one in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That small black one please.&quot; Directed Ophelia, pointing at a choker which was only a 1/2 inch wide band colored a glossy pitch black. The band was super thin too, seemingly made to appear like it was tattooed on instead of an accessory.<br />
<br />
Picking up the band and placing it in to the bag, the clerk began to check them out. &quot;Your total will be $87,000, to which we have applied our house diacount, rounding it down to $80,000, as our thank you to you, given the amount you are purchasing tonight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect, we appreciate it.&quot; Said Heather handing her a check. <br />
<br />
[My girlfriend is so damn rich she buys me $80,000 sex toys] joked Ophelia in her head.<br />
<br />
Excited to put it on and finally begin the evening&#39;s main event, the fuck fest. Heather makes the wish to apply special features to the gems, altering Ophelia somehow for as long as she is wearing the choker with the gem attached. After which, she selected a random one, fitting it into the choker&#39;s interchangeable slot. The gem she selected was...</p>
