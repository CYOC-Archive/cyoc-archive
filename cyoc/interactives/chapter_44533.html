<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake had a little time to think about what happened. He figured that he shouldn't have spoken the words out loud. He could still see but all he could see was the ceiling. He could not blink or look elsewhere. He heard a knock on his door and his younger sister ask &quot;Are you in there Jake? Do you have any female Fighters in the pack you bought?&quot; If her could have groaned he would have. He had promised Elizabeth that he would give her any female Fighters he happened to get.<br />
<br />
He heard his door open and Elizabeth ask &quot;Jake? Are you in here Jake? You're not going to scare me are you?&quot; Suddenly he could see her standing above him. He would have closed his eyes if he could have since she was standing right over him and he could see up her dress. She stood there for awhile maybe looking around. Finally she moved a little bit and her foot caught on him. She was wearing sandals and she evidently felt the card because she looked down and smiled. She picked him up saying &quot;An elf is exactly what I need against Danny. Thanks Jake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake could have groaned as she slipped him into a pouch at her waist. Danny was a bully who used his Fighter to bully other kids. His Fighter was an adult which gave him an advantage. Though that wasn't the only advantage he had. His Fighter was also a werewolf. The Magic Card 'Full Moon' made his Fighter bigger, stronger, and deadlier. Now it looked like Beth was going to battle him.<br />
<br />
Jake bounced a bit as Beth raced out of the house. He vaguely heard his mother asked Beth where she was going and Beth respond &quot;To a battle.&quot; Their mother must not have thought much about it since she didn't say anything. If she had known who Beth was going to battle she would have stopped her. Danny didn't battle unless he had a Capture Card. If Beth lost he would add her and her cards to his collection.<br />
<br />
Sometime later Beth came to a stop and said &quot;I'm here Danny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you had chickened out Beth&quot; Danny had said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just had to go home and get some new cards&quot; Beth said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well summon your fighter so we can begin&quot; Danny said.<br />
<br />
Jake felt himself being lifted out of the pouch and was looking at Beth's face. She was determined but there was fear in her eyes. She knew what would happen if she lost and she was counting on her cards and Jake to win. No pressure there. She selected him from the cards and turned him to face Danny saying &quot;I summon you Emily.&quot; There was a white light and Jake was able to move and breathe again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You send a girl elf against my werewolf&quot; Danny said in a condescending tone. &quot;This will be a piece of cake.&quot; He drew out a card and turning it said &quot;Full Moon.&quot; The card glowed white and floated into the sky changing into a full moon. The area grew as dark as night and his Fighter changed. His face pushed out into a muzzle as his ears migrated to the top of his head and became pointed. His muscles bulked up and his feet elongated. He was forced into a digitigrade stance as his finger nails became claws. Black fur spread across his body as his eyes turned yellow and slitted. &quot;Marcus is beautiful&quot; Danny said in a revered tone. &quot;Now what other cards should I use? How about these? Equip Werewolf Armor, Equip Razor Steel Claws.&quot; The two cards glowed and then flowed around Marcus. When the glow subsided he had black armor on and his hands had even deadlier claws on the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;My turn&quot; Beth said a little quiver in her voice. She was afraid. Beth whispered so only Jake heard &quot;We need to win this Emily. I hope you can beat Marcus.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Way to pile on the pressure Beth' Jake thought. He would have told her who he was but she might lose her nerve if he did and they would lose. He had to depend on her to provide support via cards. If she didn't they would lose and would be added to Danny's collection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Equip Elven Shield, Equip Elven Armor, Equip Elven Sword&quot; Beth said her voice shaking.<br />
<br />
Jake felt and saw the cards flow around him. The dress he was wearing was replaced by golden armor. A golden shield appeared on his left arm and a sword with strange symbols carved in the blade. He could tell that it was a heavy sword but he was able to hold it easily. He took a few practice swipes and found he could handle it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember Beth that when I win I get all your cards and you&quot; Danny said with a sneer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same goes for if I win&quot; Beth said the fear of losing evident in her voice now.<br />
<br />
'I need to say something' Jake thought. He noticed a spot in the armor that he could use. It was small but if he could get to it and avoid being shredded in the process they would win. Putting all the confidence in his voice that he could he said &quot;We will win Beth. I know how to defeat this werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny laughed and said &quot;Keep dreaming. Now Marcus, Attack!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily watch out!&quot; Beth said as Marcus attacked.<br />
<br />
Jake barely raised the shield in time to catch the attack. Marcus had moved so fast. Unfortunately the shield didn't block the attack and the claws made it through to slash him. He went down to the ground bleeding from the wounds made by the claws. They were able to penetrate the shield and armor. Fortunately the wounds weren't deadly but the next ones would be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finish her&quot; Danny commanded.<br />
<br />
Jake was a little stunned from the blow and would not be able to get up in time. He saw Beth frantically searching through her cards. Jake was already imagining the claws piercing his back and heart. Beth pulled a card out of her deck and said &quot;Substitution!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake's view quickly shifted from one looking up at Beth to one looking at the back of Marcus with his claws in a log. Danny and Marcus must have been stunned and Jake took advantage of this. He raised the sword and slashed. Marcus looked back but it was too late. Jake's sword sliced through the little crack between the head and body pieces cleanly slicing off Marcus' head.<br />
<br />
Marcus' head hit the ground before the rest of his body did as Danny yelled &quot;NO!!! MARCUS!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a white glow coming from Marcus and his armor and claws. The glow shrank and Marcus' card fell to the ground along with the Equip cards. The darkness lifted and Jake could see the onlookers plainly. He hadn't noticed them before. &quot;You will pay for that&quot; Danny said. Turning Jake saw him draw a card and say &quot;I summon you Gaurdune!&quot; When nothing happened he looked confused and asked &quot;Why isn't Gaurdune coming out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I am Gaurdune's owner now&quot; Beth said moving toward Danny. &quot;You lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Danny said. &quot;That couldn't have been a legal card. I've never heard of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How was she able to use it if it wasn't a legal card?&quot; Jake asked. He was satisfied to see that he obviously had no reply to that.<br />
<br />
Beth took the deck Danny had and looked through it. As she did Jake began to think about the battle he was just in. He had enjoyed it even when he had been injured. He actually liked being a Fighter instead of an Owner. His first battle and he had become hooked. Maybe he would ask Beth to release him from this card and make him a male again. Jake saw Beth grin as she pulled a card from the deck and said &quot;Thank you for bringing this Capture Card along. I can capture you now instead of later.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Beth turned the card toward Danny Jake saw the color of the border was...</p>
