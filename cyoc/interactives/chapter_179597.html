<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seth strode into his AP Chemistry coarse on top of the world. The mood of his life had shifted completely. He felt like he was top dog at a non-stop party where everyone around him was super excited for life and just wanted to chill with each other. He was feeling so outgoing and social. He rarely ever felt like talking to people before, but now he felt like he needed to greet people everywhere he went. Every time he did, people seemed to perk up and appreciate the attention, and when he saw the smiles light up on their faces he got a small hit of addictive endorphins to encourage more of the same behavior in the future.<br />
<br />
He sat down at his desk smiling dumbly, ready to take on another day of learning. His teacher reminded the class that today they&#39;d be taking a unit test covering the material they&#39;d just finished learning. Seth wasn&#39;t worried, he&#39;d studied the material in depth and was more than familiar with the periodic table.<br />
<br />
The students organized themselves and put away their belongings while the teacher distributed the test packets to the class. Seth glanced at the title &quot;Stoichiometry and Balancing Equations&quot;. He signed his name to the cover sheet, and flipped the packet open to the first page.<br />
<br />
1.) Write Avogadro’s relationship for krypton.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, yeah.&quot; Seth thought. &quot;Avocados, are related to krypton.... sure... The relationship is mostly because of being green. Like kryptonite is green and so is avocados.&quot; The more he thought about it the more he was convinced that he&#39;d stumbled upon the right line of thinking and wrote the answer down with conviction:<br />
<br />
-- They are both Green<br />
<br />
2.) Balance the following reaction:       Pb(OH)4+H2SO4&#8594;Pb(SO4)2+H2O<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow&quot; Seth thought to himself feeling overwhelmed by the look of all the numbers and letters together. &quot;Ok, this is probably easier than it looks. I just need to remember what I studied. Now, the first thing I need to do is... Ok, well what it means by &quot;balance&quot; is.... Alright. I&#39;m over thinking this obviously... It already looks pretty balanced, so, do I need to cross multiply? You know what? This is one of those gottcha questions the teacher puts in so you&#39;ll waste your time and not do the rest of the test. I&#39;ll just move on and come back if I have time.&quot; He rationalized<br />
<br />
3.) What is the limiting reagent in the reaction from the previous question?<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I&quot;ll have to skip this one for now too... He thought getting worried that he maybe wasn&#39;t as prepared for this as he&#39;d thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
4.) What is the molar mass of C6H1206?<br />
<br />
&quot;Now this I remember.&quot; He realized with relief. &quot;You need to add the numbers all together so first is 6 and 12, and when 2 and 6 are added you get 7, I mean 8, and then you take from the tens place and you add 9 to the 8 and you get... uh, 16 plus the other 6 too and that&#39;s... 22.&quot;<br />
<br />
22<br />
<br />
5.) Balance the following reaction:       CO2 + H2O &#8594; C6H12O6 + O2<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, not another one of these.&quot; He thought... &quot;These questions are way harder than I expected...&quot; Getting frustrated he looked ahead in the test at the rest of the questions to see what he had to look forward to. <br />
<br />
6.) Balance the following reaction:       SiCl4 + H2O &#8594; H4SiO4 + HCl<br />
7.) Balance the following reaction:       Al + HCl &#8594; AlCl3 + H2<br />
8.) Balance the following reaction:       Na2CO3 + HCl &#8594; NaCl + H2O + CO2<br />
9.) Balance the following reaction:       C7H6O2 + O2 &#8594; CO2 + H2O<br />
10.) Balance the following reaction:       Fe2(SO4)3 + KOH &#8594; K2SO4 + Fe(OH)3<br />
11.) Balance the following reaction:       Ca(PO4)2 + SiO2 &#8594; P4O10 + CaSiO3<br />
12.) Balance the following reaction:       KClO3 &#8594; KClO4 + KCl<br />
13.) Balance the following reaction:       Al2(SO4)3 + Ca(OH)2 &#8594; Al(OH)3 + CaSO4<br />
14.) Balance the following reaction:       H2SO4 + HI &#8594; H2S + I2 + H2O<br />
<br />
&quot;SHIT!&quot; he accidentally exclaimed out loud, provoking an uproar of laughter from the class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr.Danton, if you cannot keep your composure you&#39;ll need to leave.&quot; The teacher stated<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Sir.&quot; Seth replied apologetically. &quot;It won&#39;t happen again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seth decided to look back at his first answers for inspiration. Those had come much easier, maybe reminding himself of his other answers would help something click and he could finish the test.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are both green? What the Fuck?&quot; He thought to himself. &quot;I didn&#39;t write that, did I?&quot; He furiously erased the words with a huff. This is ridiculous... I know this stuff. I&#39;m a good student. I&#39;m a tutor. Now what is Avogadro&#39;s relationship?&quot;<br />
<br />
He was drawing a complete blank. He looked up at the clock and saw that his time was running out. Feeling frantic and panicked he decided his original answer was better than nothing so he scribbled it back in.<br />
<br />
Then as the seconds dissolved away he started manically copying letters and numbers down with arrows and anything he could to fill in the blank test in front of him. To his horror the bell began to rang and the rest of the students filed out into the hall leaving him alone scratching gibberish as quickly as he could.<br />
<br />
The teacher came up behind him putting a hand on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to pack it in Mr.Danton.&quot; The teacher said pulling the test out from under Seth&#39;s pencil.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh..... Mr.Danton.....&quot; He said disappointedly , looking over the product of Seth&#39;s efforts. &quot;I think we need to have a serious discussion about your place in this class.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I got some answers wrong, Sir, but I really do know how to do storkomenatry, stokometry, stomommory. I think I just got a little overwhelmed. I know I didn&#39;t give 110% this time, but I know if I give 110% next time, I&#39;ll do a lot better. I promise.&quot; He said with hopeful pleading eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright. It&#39;s alright. Calm down, Son.&quot; The teacher said understandingly. &quot;Tell me.. Why did you enroll in AP Chemistry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought it would look good on a college application.&quot; He answered honestly<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true; it would if you were able to earn high marks.&quot; The Teacher said thoughtfully. &quot;But you have a clear lack of fundamentals that&#39;s going to keep you from moving forward academically.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can work on my fundamentals, Coach. I mean Sir.&quot; He replied enthusiastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good. That&#39;s really good Seth.&quot; He said with a caring smile. &quot;I just think we&#39;re too far along for you to catch up at this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you think I need to go to the normal chemistry class?&quot; Seth asked worriedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you know chemistry isn&#39;t required for graduation. I was thinking maybe you should meet the basic science requirement in the remedial life science course and then leave it at that.&quot; He said uneasily.<br />
<br />
Seth looked completely crushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;But if you do well in that you can always try one of the other science classes, if that&#39;s what you&#39;d like.&quot; He offered eagerly trying to cheer the boy up.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that won&#39;t look good on a college application.&quot; He said starting to tear up, partly from the humiliation and partly because his hormones were going crazy.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no. That&#39;s not true Seth. Good grades always look good on an application. You&#39;d be much better off getting a passing grade in life science than a failing grade in Chemistry. I promise. And They&#39;ll take into account all the other things you do, your extracurricular activities and your hobbies. It&#39;s not all about who gets the highest grade in the hardest class. You&#39;ve got a lot going for you. You just need to try to leverage your strengths. That&#39;s all.&quot; He said reassuringly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; He relented, &quot;I guess that makes sense... But I can still stay in my other AP courses, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t your only AP class?&quot; The Teacher asked concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; He replied sniffling. &quot;I&#39;ve got Calculus, British Literature, Macroeconomics, And Capstone Research Study&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; The teacher said stunned. &quot;Well, I can talk to your teachers and we can work out some kind of reasonable placement for you in other classes... Whatever makes the most sense. The most important thing is that you graduate. You don&#39;t want to limit your future by trying to run too fast too soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mental imagery of running fast was soothing to Seth... He didn&#39;t want to run too fast too soon. He wanted to do it right. Train up his mind at its own pace. And the teacher said the other classes would look even BETTER than the AP courses so he really had no reason to feel bad...<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Sir.&quot; He said starting to feel better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, Seth.&quot; The Teacher said in a caring voice. &quot;Let me write you a hall pass so you&#39;re not tardy for your next class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seth grabbed the pass and walked out the door into the empty hall. He was still feeling a little dejected, not knowing what classes he would be taking from now on. He wished the hallway wasn&#39;t so empty... He could really use a good barrage of social interaction with the other kids... As he passed the boy&#39;s bathroom, his penis began to swell in his pants. He became aware of his balls beginning to tighten with a tinge of sexual longing. His mind wanted its endorphin fix and it had just discovered a way of getting it.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; He thought to himself. &quot;I&#39;m supposed to be in Macroeconomics right now. I don&#39;t have time to mess around in the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
But his sexual equipment was only growing more insistent. Images of bro-bodied sports fanatics inundated his mind&#39;s eye. He wanted... No he needed to indulge the fantasies, to feel the release he felt this morning... and he probably wasn&#39;t even going to be taking Macroeconomics anymore anyway... His hall pass would still be good when he was done, what was the harm?<br />
<br />
He clambered into the Men&#39;s room making his way to to the second to last stall. Closing the stall door he pulled his basketball shorts down eagerly. As the waistband passed his swollen member it forcefully lashed upwards bouncing haphazardly until it came to a rest standing proudly upwards. It was fiercely hard, pointing in a straight line to the open space just about a foot in front of his nose. He could feel it continue to grow firmer, a feeling that was becoming more and more familiar to him. He had memories of draping his soaked bath towel over it when he styled his hair when it was longer, an ability he was exceptionally proud of and eager to show off.<br />
<br />
He pulled back his foreskin causing a glob of trapped pre-cum do erupt over his shaft. He began stroking with vigor, savoring the blissful energy he was generating. His hips began to buck intermittently, out of his control. He thought of his changes this morning, the images were driving him wild... Then he remembered those changes were real. He shucked off his shirt and began pressing and massaging his mammoth dong against his fir-trailed belly. &quot;Fuck, yes.&quot; he bellowed uncontrollably. He imagined himself with his good friend Brian. He imagine Brian&#39;s smelly jock feet rubbing all over his cock, milking him to oblivion. He imagined Brian dressing him up in his sweaty football gear, placing locks on all of the joints to make the uniform impossible to remove. He couldn&#39;t take any more, he was past the point of no return. For an instant he felt complete calm, and then his balls pulled up the pressure built exponentially and he erupted his load. He could feel the muscles inside his dick contracting, seizing, pushing glob after glob of smelly, potent jock jizz all over his belly, the wall, his lap, the floor his pants. It was getting everywhere... How was he going to clean all this up? It didn&#39;t matter he was in Ecstasy. His mind was flooding with endorphins insuring the clandestine bathroom jack-off session would recur again.<br />
<br />
Coming down from the exulted high into the dreamy creamy afterglow, he smiled dopily and began to clumsily wipe himself off and look himself over for any additional changes. He didn&#39;t notice much difference... Maybe he had more chest hair? It was kind of looking like the dozen or so hairs that had been congregated in the middle of his chest had blossomed out into a respectable superman diamond shape. The rest of him seemed relatively unchanged, though his armpits were drenched in sweat and the smell they were broadcasting was well beyond uncouth. Of course, he hadn&#39;t applied any deodorant this morning, he hadn&#39;t had any to put on... Maybe he should go to the nurses office and borrow some?<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, who cares?&quot; He thought to himself &quot;It doesn&#39;t really even smell BAD anyway. It smells, sporty.&quot;<br />
<br />
He finished cleaning himself off and exited the stall. Looking himself in the mirror he could see his clothes were covered in random blots of wet spooge juice. He couldn&#39;t go to class looking like that. He turned the nozzle on the wall dryer up his shirt and let it run for a  few cycles until the cum spots were dry and only slightly perceptible and he proceed to treat his pants in kind.<br />
<br />
 Pleased with the results of his halfhearted clean up job, he swaggered out of the bathroom and road the remaining buzz of his sexual pit stop into second period.</p>
