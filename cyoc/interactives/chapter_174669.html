<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a warm day and the sun shined through Walter Smith&#39;s bedroom window. Today started like any other he got up and used the bathroom first. With his old age it can be a bit of a hassle but none the less he did. He then made breakfast in the case of this morning he had oatmeal with cinnamon with two bananas and a coffee. He had is breakfast on his screened-in front porch were he could watch the neighborhood. Walter enjoyed the changing dynamics of the neighborhood seeing new cultures come in was a delight. It was especially delightful that Walter had the ability to watch women of multiple ethnic backgrounds walk around the neighborhood. You see Walter is a perverted old man that loves to jerk off to just about any and all women he sees. His neighborhood had a fine selection of women to choice from all from different walks of life and this made Walter even hotter with lust. He would spend ours jerking off to many women in the neighborhood. The best part was these women didn&#39;t know how much of a pervert he was so they and their families would sometimes drop treats over to Walter&#39;s house to cheer him up about living alone. For example, his neighbor Debbie brought him over a pie last week. It was apple and it taste amazing. Walter also had his own family which visited him from time to time. The family consisted of His Son Stan  and His daughter in law Blair and Walter&#39;s granddaughter Elizabeth but most call her Liz. Stan is a lawyer, Blair is an accountant, and Liz is a college student enrolled at a local big state university. His Son&#39;s house is two hours away from Walter&#39;s house but at this time of the year Liz&#39;s university and dormitory was an hour away.  <br />
<br />
Walter stayed on the porch for a while until he had to use the rest room. He then heard a knock on the door. He rushed down the stairs thinking it was either family or a neighbor. He made sure to put on his best clothes while addressing a neighbor or family but the only thing awaiting him was a box. He read the box to make sure it didn&#39;t belong to a neighbor although he did hope it belonged to a neighbor because it would give him an excuse to talk to them and have a closer look at the women in the neighborhood. But the label said ship to <br />
Walter Smith 12467 Falliction Way. Walter was confused he did not order any package but he took it in his house to see what it was because after all it was his. <br />
<br />
He used his box cutter to open the box. Inside was a computer and an instruction manual. The title of the manual read &quot;Chronivac version 4.0&quot; Intrigued by the name Walter grabbed his reading glasses and decided to indulge himself.  After about 1 hour of reading the manual Walter learned the rules of Chronivac version 4.0. <br />
<br />
The rules are <br />
&quot;Chronivac version 4.0 includes a CD-ROM that contains the altering software, a portable emitter, and a USB connection to a PC.<br />
<br />
The portable emitter can be programmed with up to ten customizable changes that can be processed without the use of a PC (although higher detailed altering can only be made with the help of a computer). The portable emitter also contains a revert button to undo any changes made.<br />
<br />
Connected to a computer the Chronivac program can now change almost anything imaginable both physically and mentally. The only main limitation is that only living things can be changed into something else living (excluding any type of plant). So a person can be altered into any type of human or animal.<br />
<br />
When connected via PC you have the ability to scan any possible transformee to upload their personal information to make alterations easier.<br />
<br />
Here is a list of major alterations that can be made: Age, Species, Gender, Nationality, Height, Weight, Eye Color, Hair Color, Body Sizes, Hairiness, and almost anything you can think of. Many mental changes can also be made; major mental changes include: Age, Species, Sexual Orientation, Perception of Reality (EX: transformee either knows that he has been changed or thinks that he has always been the what he is), and much more. Most alterations use a slider bar to control the change.<br />
<br />
Alteration can be made through the software by selecting the feature to be changed from a list or by searching through the entire list at once.<br />
<br />
Chronivac version 4.0 does not offer a preview of changes being made but will apply the changes once the save button has been pressed. If the save button is not pressed again within one hour of the first save the change will be reverted for safety reasons.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac emitter will transform whatever being is in front of it and has a maximum distance of 20 feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Walter laughed his ass off when he finished. A magic computer would really have the power to change reality  give him a break.  He was about to throw out the computer until he realized he would be bored for the rest of the day. He decided just to keep himself entertained  for a little bit longer he would plug in this computer just to fuck around. He fired up the computer and was greeted with a normal startup screen and usual bullshit user agreement run around. Once in Walter saw a computer screen that looked familiar to something Walter first saw when he was a young man. The interface was like an old computer with command lines and a black screen. Until ZAP!! Walter felt a bolt of electricity go through his hands. The shock did hurt a little but Walter survived and was shocked to see more of a modern interface although the command line prompts were still present.  <br />
<br />
Walter saw his name and stats such as his height and weight and race. He also saw the stats and names of family members under him. Walter decided to play around with the reality altering feature. He input a command to change his eye color from black to blue. He walked to the mirror and saw they did indeed change. Walter had a mini heart attack when he saw this. After recovering Walter realized the power he had and what he could do then he had an idea.</p>
