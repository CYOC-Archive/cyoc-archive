<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nurse Manami had taken care of many elderly tenets at the senior center. She had attempted to not become too attached to them, as many of them didn&#39;t have so many years left. It was difficult for to not become fond of her tenets though, particularly when it came to a certain old man who survived both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Despite the radiation poisoning that was slowly eating away his body, he was kind, differential, and always had an open ear. Manami was thrilled when he would finally get the Animalian conversion that will save and prolong his life.<br />
<br />
Though when that old man became the wolf Tsukuyomi, things had changed. Now she was seeing him in a younger, virile body, her affection had gotten stronger. She was only human and few women would not be weak-kneed in the presence of a huge, muscular wolfman. She also felt rather...protective when she heard about Tsukuyomi&#39;s interest in Ami. Why should Ami claim Tsukuyomi when she didn&#39;t even know him? Much to her delight and good fortune, Tsukuyomi had similar feelings towards her. Still, he felt obligated to meet Ami at least once. Much to Manami&#39;s relief, Ami herself did not desire Tsukuyomi. Not even factoring that the gods they&#39;ve renamed themselves after were brother and sister, Ami was too busy to pursue any relationships considering having to deal with Interpol, the rescued girls, and the pandemic. Anyways, Ami could clearly see that Manami and Tsukuyomi were meant for each other.<br />
<br />
Though for Manami, it wasn&#39;t quite as simple to uproot herself and move to Heiya Island with Tsukuyomi. Mostly, if she converted, she couldn&#39;t hold the same job as before. As welcoming as much of the world has been of Animalians, a wolf working at a retirement home would work as some of the older tenets could get scared to death. But Manami quickly found employment at the hospital on Heiya Island and was developing a rapport with the rescued girls. After that, moving and converting seemed like a mild formality.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Manami felt a little bit nervous as she waited in the room she and Tsukuyomi rented in the inn until they could move to a proper residence. It wasn&#39;t that she was shy about having sex with Tsukuyomi. They actually had rather passionate sex after his conversion. It was just that most of that sex had been oral, considering Tsukuyomi&#39;s very impressive wolfhood would have ripped her apart if he had tried to put it in her while he was still vaccinated. But now that he was being de-vaccinated, it would be in her soon enough. And she was a little bit anxious about having a monster that huge in her most sensitive orifice.<br />
<br />
Tsukuyomi stuck his head into the room and said, &quot;Well, my virus is active again. Are you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As ready as I&#39;ll ever be,&quot; said Manami as she fingered her oriental dressing gown. She opened it, revealing her petite body underneath, &quot;I just hope you&#39;re not too big for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I&#39;m going to start by ramming myself into you?&quot; asked Tsukuyomi, &quot;I don&#39;t want our first mating to be painful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what do you propose?&quot; asked Manami as she let her gown slide off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, all of my bodily secretions are infectious, right?&quot; asked Tsukuyomi. He picked up Manami easily before putting her on the bed. Spreading her legs open, he started licking up her slip.<br />
<br />
Manami moaned as she felt his tongue start to probe in deeper, lapping up the juices that started to flow. A wolf&#39;s tongue is significantly longer than a human&#39;s and an Animalian is able to stick out their tongue while keeping their mouth closed. This made wolf Animalians particularly adept at oral sex. Manami already knew this at Tsukuyomi had serviced her before. But now his infectious saliva was mixing with her vaginal fluids.<br />
<br />
The first sensation of change Manami felt was the feeling of growing. Like many Japanese women, she was short and petite. But now she was slowly stretching across the bed. She felt a slight tickle as hairs started growing thicker across her body. She watched with fascination as her palms darkened as they developed pads, her fingernails extending into claws. Her feet were also getting longer as her arches lifted up, the ends of her feet becoming paws. She shifted out of a little discomfort as her tailbone grew out. Her moaning took on a different pitch as her face started pushing out into a muzzle. Eventually, she managed to say, &quot;Tsuko, I think I&#39;m ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tsukuyomi looked up to see how Manami was changing. She looked about halfway turned, having put on at least a foot and a half of height. She was bulking up in muscles and curves, her hips and ass being at least twice as big as they were before, a toned trail of abs going across her stomach, and her A-cup breasts had swollen to at least C-cups. Her fur was coming in, looking mostly tawny but with a white underbelly. And more importantly, she had grown to the point where she wouldn&#39;t be harmed by his entrance.<br />
<br />
Tsukuyomi removed his shorts, allowing his large wolfhood out. Crawling on top of the bed, he carefully positioned himself. &quot;Are you ready?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;More than ready,&quot; said Manami before yelping as he impaled her. It was certainly a tight fit at first, but it soon became bearable when he started pumping. Her body was still growing underneath him. She now towered over her old height and her breasts were as big and growing bigger than what her head was. Her head was taking on more lupine features as her muzzle finished forming and her ears moved to the top of her head. Her tail had grown long and was covered in luscious tawny fur. She gripped the bed as her mate continued to thrust into her. Now he didn&#39;t overshadow her quite so much. Using her new tongue, she licked at his face. Playfully growling, Tsukuyomi bit at her neck.<br />
<br />
That caused Manami to feel even more turned on and she started thrusting back hard against Tsukuyomi. His knot bounced off her several times before it managed to get inside. Manami yelped and howled as she felt herself clamping hard around Tsukuyomi. The black wolf let out his own howl as his seed pumped deep into his mate.<br />
<br />
The two wolves panted as their bodies cooled down a bit. &quot;That was...amazing...&quot; panted Manami, allowing her longer tongue to loll out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re amazing,&quot; said Tsukuyomi before looking at her, &quot;And you got even bigger than I thought?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have I?&quot; asked Manami as she tried to get up. But a tugging sensation kept her pinned. Tsukuyomi was knotted inside her and she wouldn&#39;t be getting out for some time. But she did notice that her body easily dwarfed her human form. In fact, she was closer to Tsukuyomi&#39;s height and he was not a small wolf at all. &quot;Well, this is unexpected,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess my particular virus carries more than just wolf DNA,&quot; said Tsukuyomi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least you won&#39;t have to treat me like I&#39;m made of paper,&quot; said Manami.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder how our pups will turn out,&quot; said Tsukuyomi.<br />
<br />
Manami hadn&#39;t considered that. Her mate&#39;s exposure to both bombings had left him sterile. Now that he was an Animalian, he was more virile than ever. She might already have been impregnated. But she found the thought comforting. One of the reasons she became a nurse was for her motherly disposition. Starting an actual family, even a wolf pack, sounded good to her.</p>
