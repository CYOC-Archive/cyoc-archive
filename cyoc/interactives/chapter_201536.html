<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Really, before now if one were to have asked Jeff what the most outrageous experience in his life had been it would have been difficult to come up with something.  As of now though...well there would be absolutely no topping being turned into a speedo for his older brother.  Well, not like he would ever actually tell anyone about this in the first place.<br />
<br />
In truth he was actually relieved when he felt the bag that he was in be picked up.  It meant that his imprisonment would be almost over.  Even better was as Ryan walked past Jeff’s bedroom the Chronivac was able to send a message to Jeff’s brain.<br />
<br />
“Attention User.  Remaining Duration: 3 Days and 16 hours.  Must be within 400 meter range of Chronivac for transformation to occur.”<br />
<br />
Jeff mentally sighed, it was quite a bit longer than he would have liked to be transformed, but considering the distance requirement he figured that it was a mixed blessing.  His brother’s swim meets usually took 2 days.  He could only be relieved that yesterday had been Wednesday when he was transformed, which would most likely mean that he would be turned back Sunday evening.  Hearing the car door open and shut, followed by the car ignition...he could only begin to mentally prepare himself for the ordeal he would have to deal with.<br />
<br />
As Ryan pulled into the parking lot for the Aquatics Building at UGH, he grabbed his swim bag and got out of the car.  Jogging, he made his way over to the team’s locker room and entered.  He saw that a few of his teammates were already there and in the process of getting ready.  He sighed in relief, once again glad that he, unlike many of his teammates, still had his car due to actually living close by off campus.  Walking over to his locker, he nodded at Mike and Aaron as they looked up and noticed him walking in.<br />
<br />
“Glad to see you could make it, Ryan,”  Aaron said with a lopsided smile, lightening his blue eyes.  “I was worried you wouldn’t have been able to make it.  You had mentioned that you had misplaced your speedo, you do have one right,” he couldn’t help but ask as he looked at Ryan.<br />
<br />
Ryan just nodded and opened his bag to pull out the speedo, “Yep I got one.  Thankfully they were doing rapid shipping so I was able to get one delivered before the meet.”  He placed his bag on the bench along with the speedo, and proceeded to undress.<br />
<br />
Jeff could only watch as his brother stripped in front of him, baring his body to the room.  He wasn’t the only one that Jeff was forced to watch though, as he watched his brother’s teammates putting on their own speedos.  Usually he would enjoy the sight (being bisexual really was the best in his mind) of nude men in front of him, but given the situation he was unable to truly enjoy it.  Not even the gorgeous view of his brother’s newly arrived teammate Damian, with his warm tan skin and shining blue eyes, was enough to make up for the fact that Jeff’s brother had just grabbed a hold of him and was gradually pulling him on.<br />
<br />
“Hey hold up everyone.”  A voice sounded off alerting everyone, even the speedo Jeff, to the new person who had just walked in.  The Swimming Coach, William Ryder, had joined the guys and was carrying a decent-sized box under one arm.  The coach was a decent man to the team, but each member of the team knew that that wouldn’t stop him from grinding them to the bone for the sport as well.  Don’t get them wrong, they loved the guy, but there was such a thing as being too enthusiastic.<br />
<br />
Mike crossed his arms, leaning against the lockers, “So what’s the deal now, Coach?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing bad or anything Mike.  I’m just glad I caught you guys before any of you got out there.  I just got something delivered from the college’s sports administrations office,” Coach Ryder said as pulled the box out and set it on one of the benches.<br />
<br />
‘Well that certainly explains the box,’ Ryan couldn’t help but think sarcastically, catching Kaito’s eye who was clearly thinking the same if the weary look was any determination.<br />
<br />
They each watched as the Coach opened the box, “You remember how when I mentioned how I was trying to get us monogrammed equipment, so that we would be recognized like the other sports teams?  Well admin finally came through for us.”  Here he smirked as he pulled out a speedo in yellow and red, with a UGH emblem across the back.  “I made sure that we would get them in the school colors so we shouldn’t have to worry about that either.”<br />
<br />
He tossed the speedo over to Mike, who caught it with wide eyes.  After that, each member got thrown a speedo in their size, Damian and Aaron were clearly admiring the new suits and the feel of the fabric.  Ryan noticed that it was of a higher quality than he had expected from the college, especially for a first time uniform.   He caught the Coach’s eye, “So what’s the catch, Coach?  Don’t get me wrong, I’m not complaining or anything, but these seem to be a bit much for a first go?”  Mike looked over from where he had just pulled on the speedo, and nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
Coach Ryder sighed, “Well like any other team, they do expect you to place well and maintain a good image for the team.  Hence the color scheme and logo on them.  However, they do want to make it clear that these first suits are free but if anything were to happen to them, the fees for new uniforms would be coming out of the funds we receive.  You also are required to wear them at any practice or meet that you partake in.”<br />
<br />
Aaron tilted his head in contemplation, “Those are reasonable conditions, but what about the equipment we have spent money on and have been using?”<br />
<br />
The Coach just shrugged, “Up to all of you.  You can keep them and use them for personal use, or you can just leave them here for whoever.”<br />
<br />
At that moment the intercom went off, “ATTENTION ALL TEAMS. THE FIRST PORTION OF THE INTERCOLLEGE SWIM MEET WILL BE BEGINNING IN 10 MINUTES.  ALL TEAMS ARE TO COME TO THE POOL.  THAT IS ALL.”<br />
<br />
The Coach closed up the box and started rushing out of the locker room, “Alright guys, put on the suits and hurry it up.  We’ve got a meet to win.”<br />
<br />
Jeff felt as Ryan’s grip on him was released, leaving him to fall onto the bench below him.  He watched as his brother pulled on the other speedo.  ‘You have got to be kidding me.  He turns me into a fucking speedo, and then he decides to not even use me?!  For god&#39;s sake, at least I’ll be back home soon.  He wouldn’t leave me here after going through the trouble of getting me in the first place.’<br />
<br />
Yet Jeff could only sit there in growing disbelief as Ryan and his teammates walked out of the locker room.  Leaving him still lying on the bench in the now empty locker room.  ‘Damn it Ryan!  Please don’t leave me like this!’</p>
