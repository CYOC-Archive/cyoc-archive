<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just a little variation on the last part of the previous chapter. <br />
****<br />
Tim went to bed, fed up with Dougs behaviour, luckily he fell asleep quickly. Unfortunately for him, the last few hours of constant arousal from his room mate had him dreaming highly erotica dreams about Doug. Impossible dreams. <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon Tim, I could use some help,&quot; Doug said from his bed, his dick brushing Tim&#39;s shoulder, getting it all sticky with precum.<br />
<br />
Tim sighed, &quot;ugh, fine, but I&#39;m not sucking it and I&#39;m not coming over there, you can just fuck me from there,&quot; he relented. <br />
<br />
&quot;really, You&#39;ll let me fuck you?&quot; Doug asked a little surprised. <br />
<br />
&quot;yeah, this curse thing is tough on us guys, you can&#39;t get your self off, and I&#39;m not going to get off, its just helping you out, that&#39;s all.&quot; Tim said. <br />
<br />
Doug grinned, &quot;ok cool, well I guess you can bend over your chair or desk, and line me up, shouldn&#39;t take me long,&quot; he said, his grin turning more sinister as Tim turned away. <br />
<br />
Tim pushed his chair aside and leaned over his desk, pushing his backside out as he grabbed the end of Dougs long cock, which was very slippery with lube. It was thick, but no thicker than he could handle, at least before the curse. He lined it up and pushed back a little saying as the mushroom head popped in, &quot;go easy, its been a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;no problem,&quot; Doug replied as he slowly rocked back and forth, moving his massive cock in and out of his room mate ever so slightly, all the while he kept jerking his dick, slowly making it grow longer, and a little thicker. &quot;oh man that feels good!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim closed his eyes and moaned softly, he forgot how good it felt to have a thick cock in him, but he was also concentrating on making Doug blow quick so he didn&#39;t get off himself. He felt Dougs cock creep deeper into him, hitting the spots that had been untouched for months, he softly moaned again, &quot;mmm, oh yeah, deeper.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dougs smile widened, he barely heard Tim moan for it deeper, above his own pleasured moans anyway, but he slightly quickened his jerking, making his cock grow a little faster, eliciting a louder moan from Tim, &quot;mmm, yeah man, faster, deeper!&quot; Doug was only happy to do so. <br />
<br />
Tim started to feel like he was getting gently pushed forward into his desk, and his ass felt fuller, but it felt too good, his own hard cock was drooling precum all over his desk. He didn&#39;t care, it had been so long since he&#39;d had a good fuck, he wanted to feel good. &quot;mmm Doug, push that big cock deeper, I want to feel good!&quot; he moaned. <br />
<br />
Doug stood up from his bed, pushing a good foot of his many feet long cock into Tim&#39;s ass forcing a loud pleasured cry from Tim&#39;s mouth as his massive cock continued to grow and lube his room mates ass with precum. <br />
<br />
Tim held onto his desk as he moaned with more pleasure than he&#39;d ever felt, his ass felt so full suddenly, but it felt like he could take it, his ass felt really slippery to him. He could feel Doug pull back then push back into him, and it felt effortless. He just stayed there moaning and panting for more. <br />
<br />
If Tim had opened his eyes he would have seen that his dick wasn&#39;t leaking precum onto his desk, in fact, had he not gotten so caught up in feeling good, he&#39;d have noticed that his dick had started leaking a constant stream of white cum, puddling on his desk. <br />
<br />
Doug grinned evilly as he took two steps forward, forcing more than 2 feet of his cock into Tim&#39;s ass at once, a cock that was getting close to fist thick. &quot;Mmm fuck yeah Doug, give it to me hard!&quot; Tim moaned loudly. <br />
<br />
&quot;sure thing man, what ever you want!&quot; Doug said as he rapidly jerked his thickening cock and took a couple more steps forward, getting more loud moans and noises from Tim. <br />
<br />
Tim was constantly moaning and panting and telling Doug to give him more, and to go faster and harder, when suddenly he felt two arms wrap around his back and pull him upright. He opened his eyes as Doug pulled him to his chest, &quot;well look at that, my cock made you blow all over your desk!&quot; Doug said triumphantly. <br />
<br />
Tim looked down at his wooden desk, now almost painted white with his cum, he looked at his own cock, it was still hard, but it wasn&#39;t leaking anything anymore, it bounced with what he was feeling in his ass, and now body, but it was dry. He gave it a few strokes, but he felt nothing from it, it felt the same as brushing his own ear, or touching his arm, he felt it was there, but it wasn&#39;t a pleasurable feeling anymore. <br />
<br />
Then suddenly Doug tightened his grip on Tim&#39;s upper body, moving his hips back, he pulled as much of his long, thick cock out as he could then drove it back in hard. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH, FUCKING HELL!!&quot; Tim screamed and moaned at once, he felt Dougs cock ram into him, all of that long, hot cock, filling every part of him, hitting every nerve, making him feel pleasure like he never felt before.  He loved the feeling. <br />
****<br />
Suddenly Tim woke up. <br />
<br />
He breathed out a sigh, relieved he was dreaming. Just then something... No someone behind him in his bed moved, sending indescribable pleasure throughout his body. <br />
<br />
&quot;you OK there Timmy?&quot; Doug asked, smiling widely as he wrapped his arms around Tim&#39;s body and pulled him to his chest. &quot;you were mumbling quite a bit in your sleep, mumbling, moaning, begging for more, deeper, harder... It was so hot, I couldn&#39;t help myself.&quot; Doug added. <br />
<br />
&quot;b.. But, I.. Was dreaming, that didn&#39;t happen... I wouldn&#39;t let you fuck me... The curse...&quot; Tim stammered, he was feeling so much pleasured as Doug hadn&#39;t stopped rocking in and out of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I figured you wouldn&#39;t let me, so I waited til you were asleep, my cursed cock is long, thick, flexible when I want it to be, and makes a lot of precum, it was pretty easy to slip it into you, good thing you always sleep commando, I just gently pulled the cover back and lined up and waited,&quot; Doug explained as he quicker his sawing of Tim&#39;s dripping wet hole. <br />
<br />
&quot;w.. Waited?&quot; Tim moaned as he started moving his hips back to meet Dougs thrusts. <br />
<br />
&quot;yeah, I figured I made you so horny those last few hours that you&#39;d do anything to feel good, so I just put my cock head at your hole, jerked slowly, lubed you up, and it wasn&#39;t long until you were pushing back, like you are right now,&quot; Doug grinned, &quot;it helped that the more I jerk, the longer and thicker my cock gets, and the more lube it pumps out.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;mmmm, faster Doug!&quot; Tim moaned. <br />
<br />
Doug smiled, Tim was pushing back hard and moaning, but wasn&#39;t asking anything about why. He whispered into Tim&#39;s ear, &quot;I knew you were crushing on me, surprised you didn&#39;t pick up that I had a crush on you too... Looks like now I&#39;ve made you my own fuck toy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;mmm, fuck yeah,&quot; Tim moaned back, Doug stopped moving and helped Tim in place. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tim, seriously, this is ok isn&#39;t it? I mean, I&#39;ve probably fucked you over pretty good, I don&#39;t know how bad, but you seem to be stuck on me fucking you,&quot; Doug asked, he felt a little guilty now, but he wasn&#39;t sorry. <br />
<br />
Tim laughed sending pleasured thrills throughout his body, in turn making him moan, &quot;mmm, Doug, really, now you&#39;re guilty? I really don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m gay, I&#39;m a bottom, I haven&#39;t done anything sexual in months, not since this curse thing happened. And right now I feel so fucking good! And you did that! So thanks. I was just worried that my dick might fall off or something, not that I was using it, but I&#39;d miss it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug laughed, &quot;cool, can I fuck you now?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;go for it big boy, go your hardest!&quot;</p>
