<br />
<br />
When Harry Jenkins left with Jenny Harper for her first counseling session with Doctor Frances Twist, Karen Yuletide couldn&#39;t wait to rush back upstairs to the dorm room the coeds shared and look through the Moon Lake Town Handbook some more, but after the first few pages, realized something was wrong.<br />
The weres still interested her, but for some reason, her fur fetish wasn&#39;t as strong as when she went through the book last night.<br />
<i>Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve already been through this once,</i> she thought, remembering how close she came to having an orgasm last night before Harry and Jenny came back from dinner.<br />
Karen knew her fur fetish existed since childhood but if asked, especially since she never told anyone about it, would be hard pressed to explain its origin.<br />
The interest grew as she aged, to the point where it now influenced her career decision to be an animator of anthropomorphic characters. The sexual aspect of her fetish first manifested itself as a teenager when she accidentally sat, naked, on her fur lined jacket while trying to get dressed on a cold winter morning.<br />
There was just something so exotic, let alone erotic, about the sensation of fur on bare skin, that led to some self-discoveries and being seriously late for school that day.<br />
After discovering they existed through seeing first hand Jenny and Harry&#39;s transformation into werefoxes, Karen felt all her dreams could come true by becoming a were-creature herself, although what type was still undecided.<br />
Yet that might be the biggest decision of her life, for once a person became a were, there was no going back.<br />
Frustrated she was getting nowhere with her self pleasure efforts, Karen decided to put the handbook back amongst Jenny&#39;s things, grab some breakfast, and get ready for her first class of the day.<br />
<br />
Walking across campus, Karen kept staring at everyone, wondering who might be what.<br />
Yet it was only idle curiosity that kept her mind occupied.<br />
There was no sign of her fur fetish at all.<br />
<br />
Karen&#39;s first class on Tuesdays and Thursdays was Art, a prerequisite to the more advanced animation courses she would begin in the Spring semester. Karen loved to draw, and wowed the administrative board with her entry sketches to enroll in Moon Lake College&#39;s art program. She was always at her assigned work station and ready to start before even the instructor entered the room. Yet today, Karen couldn&#39;t help noticing there was another man with him. One she couldn&#39;t recall seeing before, but found quite handsome. The art instructor escorted the other man to the storeroom in the corner. As the stranger entered it, the instructor turned to await the rest of the students before class began.<br />
<br />
As the clock on the wall reached 10 AM, the art instructor said, &quot;Okay class. Let&#39;s get right to it, for we have a lot of ground to cover today,&quot; as he walked over and knocked on the storeroom door. The stranger came out wearing only a bathrobe, as Karen quickly realized what was going on.<br />
&quot;Class, this is Peter. The life model for today I promised you. Don&#39;t worry gentlemen, the lady will be here Thursday. Now then, Peter will assume a new pose every 15 minutes until the top of the hour. You know what you&#39;re supposed to do. Begin.&quot;<br />
With that, Peter let the bathrobe fall to the floor, revealing a well toned, yet not muscle bound, body underneath, and no other clothing.<br />
Everyone, including Karen, began drawing Peter.<br />
For his first pose, Peter just stood there. When the first fifteen minutes elapsed, he turned slightly to his left and smiled.<br />
If Karen wasn&#39;t already interested in the model before, she certainly was now.<br />
Six feet tall, brown hair a tad longer than what the average man wore, but by no means out of place on him, and evidence of a very strong jaw line. Yet no matter how much she tried, for some reason Karen just could not capture Peter&#39;s eye color accurately.<br />
<br />
Two more poses later and it was suddenly the top of the hour. Karen quickly looked back through her drawings as the art instructor started checking everybody&#39;s work and saw she filled up almost a dozen pages with images of Peter. A few were full figured, some spotlighting an arm, leg, or profile. Yet, as the instructor came around to examine her work, it was Karen&#39;s very last drawing that she felt the most embarrassed by. She had drawn herself standing next to Peter, both of them fully dressed, in a church getting married!<br />
The instructor took a look at her last drawing, then whispered to Karen. &quot;I can&#39;t blame you. If I was still single...&quot;<br />
Then he went back to stand near Peter.<br />
&quot;Okay class. We still have about 90 minutes left, and I have a surprise. Peter, if you&#39;re ready,&quot; said the instructor, before walking away.<br />
<br />
With that, Peter simply stood there as blondish brown fur began to appear on his body. Quickly, he began gaining muscle mass and height as his feet and hands showed evidence of gaining claws. A long tail spouted from his rear even as his face began assuming more feline features.<br />
Moments later, a fully transformed, eight foot tall werelion stood before the class.<br />
&quot;Same rules as before,&quot; said the instructor. &quot;An hour&#39;s worth of drawing, with the pose changing every fifteen minutes. Begin.&quot;<br />
Most of the students just accepted Peter&#39;s transformation as a normal occurrence of every day life in Moon Lake and began drawing the new subject before them.<br />
Karen felt her fur fetish return.<br />
It was more intense than any effort earlier this morning, but was by no means the sometimes out of control lust that occasionally over took her, like last night. This time SHE was in charge. With a growing feeling of confidence, Karen began drawing.<br />
Karen had no idea why she felt the way she did, until a memory of Jenny trying to comfort her after a nightmare before dawn came back to her. <i>&quot;Don&#39;t worry. When you find the right someone, everything will be as it should.&quot;</i><br />
Karen smiled at Peter, not realizing that he was smiling back at her, as she drew him in all his werelion glory.<br />
Then she drew another sketch of Peter the werelion, but this time he was standing next to Karen the werelioness, as they held each other close like happily married couples did.<br />
Several more drawings of the mated pair, including one of them with two cubs, an older boy and a younger girl; were created, until the art instructor said the hour was up.<br />
With that, Peter the werelion bent down to pick up his discarded robe and went into the storeroom as the instructor went around examining the new batch of drawings.<br />
When he came around to Karen&#39;s work station, the art instructor studied her drawings and smiled. &quot;Very talented work. Well detailed and quite imaginative,&quot; he said, while pointing at the last one of the werelion family.<br />
&quot;Okay class. The lady will be here Thursday, and don&#39;t forget your drawings of outdoor landscapes are due next Tuesday. Class dismissed,&quot; said the art instructor.<br />
<br />
As Karen Yuletide packed her things to leave, a fully dressed and human Peter came out and approached her.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a normal,&quot; he realized, catching her scent.<br />
&quot;Is that a bad thing?&quot; she asked.<br />
&quot;No. Just different. I was wondering why you seemed so interested in me in both forms when the rest of the class was just looking at me the whole time like I was another display to draw.&quot;<br />
&quot;Trust me, you ain&#39;t,&quot; said Karen. &quot;Just another display to draw, that is.&quot;<br />
Peter smiled at the compliment as the art instructor walked past them.<br />
&quot;You should see the drawings she did. I can never say something like this publicly, but Karen is the most talented student it has ever been my pleasure to teach,&quot; said the instructor. &quot;You can stay and chat for a bit, but the next class will be here at the top of the hour,&quot; he added, before leaving the room.<br />
Peter looked at Karen and asked, &quot;Would you like to grab some lunch? My treat.&quot;</p>
