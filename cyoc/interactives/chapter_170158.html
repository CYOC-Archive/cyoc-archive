<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Isabella sat down next to three girls, she just felt drawn to them in a way, like some magical force was compelling her to sit next to them. The first had long blonde hair and blue eyes. She LOOKED like a bimbo with her neon pink short showing off massive cleavage from her breasts... not that Isabella was looking or anything. The girl wore blue shorts and could be mistaken for male underwear given how short they are. The second one had red, curly hair and brown eyes. She wore the exact thing did. And so did the last girl, but she had brown hair and hazel eyes. Isabella smiled nervously next to them and looked up at the teacher. She didnt notice the girls smiling mischievously.<br />
<br />
Issy was taking notes when she felt something tap her shoulder. She turned around and saw the busty blonde giving her a bottle of scented perfume. She looked confused but thanked her and put it in her bag. The red hair girl spoke to her, her voice was high and bubbly, but also sassy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you should totally, like, sit with us at lunch. I mean, you really have no choice, sooo~&quot; She said and this confused Isabella. Didn&#39;t have a choice? What does that mean? So, Isabella asked her. The brown haired girl giggled and looked at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Silly, didn&#39;t you know? At this school, whatever group you sit with you automatically join them. Your tastes, personality, attributes and attitude, memories and voice, sometimes even age and height get changed depending on the people you sit with. Lucky for you, you like, sat with us.&quot; The spoke, subconsciously twirling her own and Isabella&#39;s hair. Isabella was a bit weirded out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm... I&#39;m sorry but that&#39;s not how that works... anywhere...&quot; She mumbled shyly and looked back up at the teacher, but her mind kept drifting to the perfume sitting in her bag. She decided she&#39;d use it in the bathroom before lunch. The girls smiled between them, already imagining what the nerd would look like once complete<br />
<br />
~~~ <br />
<br />
Isabella stood infront of the mirror with the pink perfume bottle in her hand. She was alone in the bathroom. She sprayed the perfume all over herself and waited. She smelt strawberry, but that was it... or so she thought. Little did she know, some changes would start at home She loomed co fused and walked out of the bathroom, suddenly nearly all groups and clubs looked away and backed up in fear. Some people praised her for some reason and hell, even the scary looking punks seemed nervous. She didn&#39;t know what was happening, but she didn&#39;t really mind it.<br />
<br />
She entered the huge cafeteria and Immediately walked over to the girls. She learnt their names. The bimbo-looking girl was named Bree, the red-haired girl was named Trish, and the brunette girl was named Lexi. She looked around and people looked away. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Isabella asked and Bree responded. &quot;Your just showing them who&#39;s boss. You see, we are some of the popular girls. But unlike those goody two shoes over there, we are mean. We bully people to get our way and we dont feel bad. We don&#39;t pay attention in class and we get everything handed to us.&quot; She went on to explain that their group is allies with all of the rude or sporty groups, like the bullies, girljocks, punks, etc, but that doesn&#39;t mean they are safe from bullying. <br />
<br />
Isabella didn&#39;t want to hurt people! She had always been known to be super kind! She didn&#39;t want to become what she hated most! Yet, she kept quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;For example,&quot; Trish began with a giggle. She stood up and walked over to the nerds, who gulped. &quot;Hey nerds, give us your money, or else.&quot; About a minute later, she walked back with 20 dollars. Isabella looked at her amazed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are also great at manipulation. Like that girl from the loner girl, thinks we are ACTUALLY her friend. It&#39;s hilarious!&quot; Lexi said, and the trio all laughed, and Isabella found herself joining in. She started to like this position of power she was in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I go try something? It&#39;ll be hilarious.&quot; Issy asked, coming up with an idea. The girls nodded mischievously and she stood up. She barely noticed that she grew an inch. She strutted over to the nerds, feeling powerful. They looked at her nervously, but knew she wouldn&#39;t be that bad, since she was still just a newcomer, but that would soon change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you, ple- I mean, give me 10 push-ups, now!&quot; She resisted the urge to apologize or say please, and instead shouted at them with an authoritative voice. All four of them got up and dropped down to the floor. They tried to do push-ups, but they like barely do three without falling over exhausted, like they had just ran a marathon. Isabella and the trio behind her broke out laughing and Isabella walked back to the table.<br />
<br />
Isabella smiled and talked with them more and more throughout the day, joining them in their shinanigains. She tried to pay attention in class, but she barely could. She join the girls in teasing and bullying kids and teachers and she walked out of the school building with a hundred dollars in her pocket.<br />
<br />
She returned home and looked around suprised. The walls were painted pink and her TV was much bigger. Her books and video games were replaced with magazines and other things her friends liked. She made her way to her bedroom. There was a huge make up station with a tons of expensive products there. Her bed was massive and pink, probably being able to fit ten people. <br />
<br />
Her posters changed to posters of guys and girls (she appreciated the girl posters more) and newspaper clipping of the latest gossip or photos of skimpy girls. Her gaming computer changed as well. The background was a picture of the four of them nearly nude in a room she didn&#39;t recognize, like it was a picture from the future or something. They all seemed happy. Her tabs, which were previously YouTube and school things, now changed to wattpad, cyoc.net which she would never go on willingly, PornHub and more things for pleasure. Her YouTube subscription were of famous youtubers or those girls with attractive profile pictures, and she even had links to the dirty sites in her notes! Her phone was also changed fairly similarly. Her old online friends were gone, as if she never met them, and replaced with skimpy or rude people, including her friends, who were starred. She smiled and fell on her bed. Instead of putting on pajamas like always, she felt compelled to just sleep in her underwear. clothes in her closet changed to whatever her friends liked or wanted her to wear. She slowly drifted off to sleep, unaware of the changes that would happen in her unconsciousness</p>
