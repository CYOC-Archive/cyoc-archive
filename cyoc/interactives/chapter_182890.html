<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tucker looked down at the objects on the table. He decided that he is going to use the razor first; he was very pleased with his new body hair but he was getting impatient and wanted some more! He grabbed the new blades and went to hop into the shower. He quickly undressed and got into the hot steamy shower. <br />
<br />
Looking down at his naked body, he was mostly pleased with his progress. He was about moderately hairy at this point. Looking at his torso, he saw lots of thick brown hairs sprouting in a V shape down his chest, around his nipples, and spreading out all over his stomach. They went down his pubes. However, the hair was still very short from his last shaving. He wanted to leave the body hair a bit longer to see how thick it could grow. Lifting his arm, he looked at his armpits. He had a substantial bush now, the thick brown hairs sticking out even with his arms down. He touched ran his fingers through the thick bush. He decided what he was going to do. Tucker wanted to leave the hair on his body alone, but he got the razor and began to shave away the hair in his pits. He had always loved hairy pits in other guys and he wanted a real bush. As soon as his armpits were bare of their new hair, Tucker got a mischevious grin. He ran the razor over the skin for a second and a third time. He wasn&#39;t sure if this would count as 1 or 3 shaves with regard to how much new hair will grow, but he hoped he would be left with a lot of pit hair after this.<br />
<br />
After Tucker&#39;s shower, he hopped out and grabbed a towel to dry himself. After putting on some clothe, he walked back into his bedroom and decided to check out the other two items. He glanced at the small bottle of cologne with the football on it. &quot;Athlete&#39;s Cologne; Smell Like a Man&quot;, it promised in big bold letters. He shrugged, thinking it was probably a sporty style smelling cologne. <br />
<br />
He experimentally spritzed the mist all over his body; if this product was magic, like the rest, he wanted to make sure that he put on enough for a noticeable effect. Tucker began to cough; the cologne was pretty smelly. Rather than a good smelling cologne, it smelled a bit like old sweat and BO. A kind of dirty locker room scent. Tucker grimaced at the smell and put the bottle down; &quot;oh well, lets see what this cologne does!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Tucker put on his clothes and went about doing some chores around the house. Every so often he would get a whiff of the musky, BO scent again, but he was slowly getting used to it. Unbeknownst to Tucker, the cologne was being slowly drawn into his pores and his skin, and it was beginning to have an effect. He didn&#39;t notice it, but his sweat glands under his arms, around his crotch, even around his feet, were beginning to sweat a bit more and produce a bit stronger, musky scent. His ball were tingling and itching a bit as well, but Tucker chocked it up to the newly grown hair. Soon enough, he had a couple wet sweat stains under his arms. Doing his chores, however, he failed to notice. <br />
<br />
After he finished cleaning up the kitchen, he decided to take a break. Heading back up to his room, he spied the last item; the fleshlight with the stallion on it. Tucker decided now was a good time to try out his last item. He felt his crotch twitch with anticipation.<br />
<br />
Taking it out of the box, it looked just like a normal fleshlight, except the tube looked a bit longer than normal and the hole looked a bit bigger than a standard one. &quot;Huh, maybe this will feel too loose?&quot;, he muttered to himself. <br />
<br />
Tucker quickly shucked his shorts and boxers and stood their in the nude. With his boxers off, he noticed his balls smelled a bit funky or musky. He ignored this and focused on the new toy. His average sized 5.5 inch cock already hard from the anticipation, Tucker quickly applied some lube he had lying around, and lowered his slick head to the toy. &quot;Well, here we go!&quot;....</p>
