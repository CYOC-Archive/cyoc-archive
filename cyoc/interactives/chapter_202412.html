<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Today was going to be a good day as far as Matteo Torres was concerned.  <br />
<br />
He always started his mornings early with a good gym session around 6 a.m. before making his way out into the larger world to, in his own words, “get it.” <br />
<br />
This morning was no different from any other day in his mind. <br />
<br />
He didn’t have a full time job as it was — he ran errands, took odd jobs, and plucked up one gardening gig that paid decently for the work he did, but was excellent when it came to perks. Paul and Ivan basically gave him free rein of their backyard any day that he came over, and he came over often. They could find tasks for him around the house on any given day, and Matteo did most of them in various stages of undress — which probably added to the growing list of tasks the couple invented for him to do for them. <br />
<br />
Today had been a gardening and landscaping day, and he’d started hours ago after arriving at the property. Paul and Ivan had watched him working from their back porch during their breakfast and, unbeknownst to him, from their shower as well. When they had gone out for the afternoon some fifteen minutes earlier, they’d told him to take his time and to help himself to any of the food in the fridge.  <br />
<br />
Matteo wasn’t 100% sure how he felt about being objectified by the older gays, but it kept him paid, fed, and boosted his ego. <br />
<br />
With the home owners gone, Matteo decided he’d earned himself an afternoon of relaxation, and with the high fences surrounding the yard Matteo felt secure that he could do it in the buff.  <br />
<br />
He’d stripped off his final layer of clothing, a pair of skimpy shorts, and reached into his bag for his tanning oil. While he did have a natural tan thanks to his Latinx heritage he preferred to make sure he was tanning evenly, and the smell of this coconut variety was, in Ivan’s words “divine.”  <br />
<br />
Slathered up he laid down on the padded bench next to the pool, popped his AirPods into his ears and relaxed to listen to some tunes as he tanned.  <br />
<br />
Sighing contentedly at the moment of respite, Matteo was blissfully unaware that he was being watched. Not that he would have considered the many-eyed insect a watcher. From his perspective bugs were minor pests that he hardly considered beyond the momentary annoyances they could bring.  <br />
<br />
Matteo had nearly started to drift off into a light nap when he felt something drop down on his ass. He barely noticed until he felt the tell-tale sign of movement that implied an insect of some kind had decided one of his round glutes was a landing pad.  <br />
<br />
Without much thought Matteo shifted positions, flipping over on the padded chair, catching a glimpse of a fly hovering in the air nearby before settling himself, arms behind his head, back into relaxation. <br />
<br />
He heard the faint drone from the buzzing of wings as the insect kept hovering. Still drowsy, Matteo fell into a light slumber, his well-defined muscles glistening in the sun, and the smell of musk, sweat, and coconut oil made an enticing intoxicant for one very curious bug.  <br />
<br />
——— <br />
<br />
Brad thought that he remained in control, but the more time he spent in the fly’s body, the more the fly’s instincts took charge. How else to explain the ease with which he learned the intricacies of flight or the mundane reflexes of feeding with his weird proboscis.  <br />
<br />
Brad was almost a slave to the insect’s hard-wired instincts, and with the combined lure of musk, sweat and coconut oil becoming a cloying miasma in the neighbor’s backyard, he let himself be tempted closer to the attractive behemoth. <br />
<br />
He felt like an astronaut landing on the moon. Touch down! One small step for fly, one giant step… <br />
<br />
He shook his tiny head. He was becoming giddy. The tanning oil with the overtones of male musk and sweat overwhelmed him. <br />
<br />
His six tiny legs scurried across the gradual slope. He wasn’t at all ready when the landscape just flip-flopped! <br />
<br />
A tiny man would have been thrown willy-nilly into orbit, but as a tiny fly, Brad regained his equilibrium and veered off as fast as his wings could take him as the giant shifted position and flipped over on the padded chair. <br />
<br />
Arms behind his head, looking very relaxed, Matteo’s dark eyes focused on the hovering insect.  <br />
<br />
Daringly, Brad hovered in place, his eyes practically drinking in the sight of the young man’s defined muscles. Rows of rippling abdominals, a navel like a deep pit, and firm pecs all there for him to feast his strange eyes on. <br />
<br />
Drool practically dripped from Brad’s dangling proboscis.  <br />
<br />
But his buzzing wings were only one part in an entire chorus of insect chirps, chitters and buzzes in the yard, and together they lulled the giant into a drowsy slumber. <br />
<br />
Brad watched the giant’s dark eyes close. <br />
<br />
He knew that he SHOULD get back to Mark and/or Russ, but this was new. This was why he enjoyed the perspective of a tiny voyeur so much. <br />
<br />
Plus the fly was drawn to a pool of sweat that had formed between Matteo’s pecs in a thin cluster of chest hair on an otherwise nearly smooth torso. <br />
<br />
Not having learned his lesson with his landing on the giant’s massive glute, he zipped forward and navigated into the canyon formed by the massive pecs. <br />
<br />
His proboscis dipped into the pool and drank some of the sweaty brine the moment his tiny feet sat down. <br />
<br />
——— <br />
<br />
For his part, Matteo never stopped in his life to think about what the world would be like for anything smaller than a person. Why would he? The smaller the creature, the less he’d considered it. So he had no way of even knowing what his well defined musculature might look like to them. How the small amount of hair that met between his pecs and travelled down his abs in a very fine happy trail might be considered something closer to a thick lawn of hair to a fly for instance. <br />
<br />
He drifted off for several long minutes, dead to the world as music from his earbuds kept him locked off audibly from the rest of the world.  <br />
<br />
He didn’t even notice on a conscious level as a common housefly landed on his chest, moving into the space between his pecs.  <br />
<br />
However, Matteo’s unconscious mind received the signal that there was an irritation to be dealt with. So his hand raised and dropped without warning onto his chest, missing crushing the fly by only the narrowest of margins between fingertip and muscle.<br />
<br />
Panicking the fly buzzed loudly, attempting to move, to free itself from beneath the powerful hand.  <br />
<br />
It might have made an escape if not for the fact that Matteo received a text, prompting his phone to ding loudly through his AirPods. Stirred from his nap, he felt a tickling sensation against his chest and hand. Startled, he drew back his hand and in one panicked strike flung the insect away from his body towards the large pool adjacent to the bench. <br />
<br />
Grimacing, Matteo turned his attention back to his phone, shuddering at the sensation, whatever it had been. He studied the text and saw it was just from one of the guys he was seeing.  <br />
<br />
“Fuck it,” he growled. “Guess I’m not getting any sleep today.” He chuckled, opening the phone and seeing his suitor had sent a racy photo.  <br />
<br />
This caused his thick meat to stir, as he grinned at the voluptuous ass the guy had sent him.  <br />
<br />
“Oh!” With a wicked grin Matteo sent back a peach emoji with several sparkles and an eggplant. <br />
<br />
Within moments he had a text back with just an eggplant emoji and a drooling face emoji.  <br />
<br />
Matteo cackled and sent back a snapshot of his easily roused, and currently aroused, manhood.  <br />
<br />
‘When can I see you?’ Came back another text. <br />
<br />
‘I have a few more things to take care of before I’m done for the day. Let’s meet up this evening.’ <br />
<br />
‘Hell yeah papi. See you at my place.’ Came back a final text.  <br />
<br />
Stretching as he stood up, Matteo glanced at the pool. A quick dip before he finished up would probably be a good call, both to cool off… and calm down.  <br />
<br />
As Matteo dropped himself into the pool, he didn’t notice the small black fly that was struggling to stay afloat with soaked wings in waters that only became choppier with Matteo’s presence.</p>
