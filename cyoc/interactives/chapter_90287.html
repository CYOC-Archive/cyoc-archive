<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As I was doing my best at keeping mom from her going into Linda&#39;s bedroom and her becoming infected and demoralized, what did we hear but the shrill bleats of a brother realizing his changed self.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baa, baa..., Ma..., baa..., aw, baa, baa,&quot; Tim cried out with a shrill tone similar to what he was fast becoming, he a buck goat of equal age and maturity to what he was as a person. He was rather striking of coloring his thick body fur being a dark brown, as was his belly black and his legs too. Tim retained his hazel colored eyes though the pupils conformed to being rectangle shapes, proper for him being a goat. I had reasoned that age of the person infected by the virus caused the quicker conforming of change to a body with an efficient metabolism. As Tim was younger than Linda of me, his transitioning of species went quicker, being less painful, and he retaining more of his human intelligence to his credit.<br />
<br />
Linda changed, but partially or three fourths of her was similar to being a doe goat, while her intelligence had degraded, she willing to accepting as wanting to be satiric nymphomaniac. I suspected that she too would go whole goat in due time, as from seeing how dad changed where Linda tainted his face, the rest of him seemed unchanged before she thrust his face tight to her furry-slicked groin.<br />
<br />
I pleaded with mom, telling her the truth as of Linda being infected by that raging notorious virus, it able to transcend what was born human to look and become dehumanized. The evening news reports on the TV told of numbered people changed, as most of those living inside cities became as common farming animals, as those who lived in the countryside tended to become as wild animals of that region. This thesis suggested and later specified when reported on TV of a rural farm family in South Dakota all became as Bison. Mom knew the details of what the virus caused, and she looking me in the face, asked, &quot;What is my family becoming?&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, and without need for me to choke out an answer, Tim bolted from out the bedroom, as ran and leaping along the upstairs hallway, he coming to stand there looking up at she who bore him into this cruel world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baa-Ma...,&quot; Tim said, as he then danced his way down the stairway, he changed fully of form to being a mature male goat. His sign of his rather obvious state of being a mature goat was the seeing of his Kiwi fruit size of furry testicles bouncing off his hocks as he walked the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goats?&quot; Mom said as if questioning me, she looking at me as if to ask if I were infected, to which I said, &quot;No mom, I am fine still!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just about then did dad come up for a clean or fresher breath of air. How he did it I do not know, but his fatherly attitude I suspect played a part, as he rose up and walked away from Linda. Mom and I saw then father walk to the bedroom doorway, he casting a wary eyed look to she his wife before he walked along the hall to their bedroom.<br />
<br />
Mom was ready to follow after dad, but I held her from going upstairs, as not knowing what Linda might do to mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;My Linda,&quot; mom said in asking of her present condition.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is unrecognizable as my sister, your daughter, she being the primary infecting force, caused Tim to change, as infected father, if you go up there she might infect you too!&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Mom stood there, she being tense, was not without her love for her family. I held her there, and we waited, as waited, the scent of those sweet cinnamon rolls dying away before Linda walked out from her bedroom. She stopped by her bedroom doorway and having to hold onto the door casing to keep her footing steadied, she cast an evil glared stare at her older brother and her dear loving mother.<br />
<br />
It was then that I noted my sister had changed more. Linda, her face had regulated to being more goat-like, as that pouted upturned nose of hers had merged with the mouth to form a goaty shaped muzzle. She had sprouted horns, hers being different than those of Tim, Linda had gray colored horns!<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama, baa...,&quot; Linda expounded with an exhaled force of her lungs. She had conformed of face, head, and voice to being as much like a doe goat, her furry naked self standing on hind-like legs of a strong goat.<br />
<br />
A moment later and our father did exit his bedroom, he his face that of a goat, his head all furry, the fur trailing in stripes of fur along his neck to under his shirt. He came out into the hallway and there in his hand he held his army revolver. He was aiming it at Linda, and she able still to know he meant deadly business, she bowed her head in submission.<br />
<br />
Mom and I stepped down as off the stairs to allow then Linda followed closely by our dad with his gun to shoo the Satyress from our home.<br />
<br />
We stood there and watched in silence, dad being the stern army trained man he was, moved Linda from the house to the storage shed where he bound her with ropes. The morning was a chilly time of early fall weather, and the furrier a body was the more comfortable to the weather. As much the weather imposed something on the virus, and those changed and still changing, it tended to slow the changing.<br />
<br />
When dad returned to the house his face had lost most of the reddish roan colored fur. His ears remained those like a goat, but changed again to looking Caucasian. He came in and gave a hug to his dearest wife, and just offered me a head nod as to show his respect for my act of restraint.<br />
<br />
&quot;Linda is bound with rope and locked inside the shed. Tim ran off, as to only god knows where. Myself, our damned daughter infected me, so I need call the doctor and have myself interned to some holding camp, lest what I was becoming should affect and infect you two!&quot; So said dad, as he went to phone the doctor and report yet another case of the &quot;Beast Influenza.&quot;</p>
