<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter noticed a look of surprise and almost bewilderment on the part of the young werewolf that stood before him and Karen. A part of him wanted to chuckle at the surprise that Ben displayed, but another part of him also wanted to sigh in frustration. He guessed that Ben was surprised that Karen was dating him and that he wasn&#39;t seriously involved with someone who was already a werelion. In that sense it was a bit of a curse that came along with some of the were-groups in Moon Lake that more &quot;singular&quot; leadership. A good many in Moon Lake followed and paid a great deal of respect an homage to Akane Tachibana and her children and grandchildren as a result of their leadership in the Skulk and the fact that Akane came from a Japanese noble family raised more interest. And while the werelion prides weren&#39;t quite so united as the Skulk was for werefoxes, the fact that his father did sit on a sort of &quot;throne&quot; to keep differences between prides &quot;friendly&quot; made for a lot of attention being paid to him because of it.<br />
<br />
It was actually one of those things that made him like Karen very much. While she was curious about how werelion society worked and seemed quite willing to be his lioness, she didn&#39;t seem to care about the things that many of the others seemed to pay attention to. She didn&#39;t want the potential power that would potentially come along with being his wife, she just wanted him. Being humble wasn&#39;t a bad thing in Peter&#39;s opinion.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look a little surprised,&quot; Peter commented, &quot;Young wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben managed to shook himself out of his initial surprise and managed a response, &quot;Sorry... I guess I didn&#39;t... well you see...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the other werelionesses in the high school have told you about how they want me or how I&#39;m only for a high end lioness?&quot; Peter finished for Ben.<br />
<br />
Ben glanced to Karen, who had taken everything that Peter had just said in stride and barely responded to it. And if she did, it was more loving than some of the responses that Ben might have expected. He then looked down sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Ben said weakly, &quot;it&#39;s just a lot of idle gossip I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t listen to it,&quot; Peter instructed, &quot;gossip never does anyone any good, and it rarely touches the truth behind a heart&#39;s decisions. Karen may be a normal... for now... and she may not have come from some super rich family, but neither is she looking lord it over people. It&#39;s one of the things I love about her. Being humble and being more interested in me as a person rather than interested in me because of my position.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... I take it you know about were-beasts?&quot; Kenya asked to Karen as politely as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I laughed at all the waivers I had to sign to promise not to say anything if I saw some rather furry creature running on two legs and all that... but it makes sense I suppose,&quot; Karen commented, &quot;and some of the art classes, particularly the introductory ones will include anatomical studies, and on one day, Peter was one of the models... and he was magnificent. We met and have been dating ever since.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that does sound good,&quot; Ben commented, regaining some confidence and being a bit more at ease, &quot;will you be staying in Moon Lake after college, or...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope to stay with Peter and go where he goes,&quot; Karen answered and looked over to him and smiled. He smiled back and held her to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That does sound good,&quot; Kenya agreed, &quot;all surprises aside, we wish you both well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ben agreed and said to Peter, &quot;sorry about...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; Peter said holding up a hand to stop Ben, &quot;It&#39;s the rumor and gossip mill that I don&#39;t like. You aren&#39;t at fault for that, as that&#39;s been going on my whole life. I don&#39;t fault you for hearing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you were talking about art when I came up,&quot; Peter commented changing the subject, &quot;are you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ben Twist,&quot; Ben answered, &quot;and I might consider an art major. I&#39;d honestly never thought that much on the future before...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is good though,&quot; Karen said to Peter, &quot;and has a family history in art.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter noted Karen pointing to the picture on the wall of the Student Center. He hadn&#39;t seen the pictures that Ben had on his cellphone, but he did trust Karen&#39;s judgement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Moon Lake&#39;s art program is very friendly,&quot; Peter commented, &quot;even for those who aren&#39;t art majors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Ben commented, &quot;So uh... the modelling...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is nude, yes,&quot; Peter answered, &quot;nothing wrong with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you into art too?&quot; Karen asked to Kenya.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like looking at it,&quot; Kenya gave a chuckle, &quot;My major is more in the field of economics and business dealings. Maybe if Ben here succeeds well in the art world we could go into some form of partnership. I&#39;d handle the business end of things with the sale of his work, and Ben would give the world marvelous things to look at and enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I think I&#39;ve seen you around that area from time to time,&quot; Peter commented, &quot;though your scent... it&#39;s rather familiar... like one I remember when accompanying my mom to a florist...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Kenya Adaeze,&quot; Kenya answered, &quot;the florist you met was probably my Aunt or Uncle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Peter said slowly, &quot;well, tell them that they still are growing and look very well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; Kenya answered with a nod.<br />
<br />
Peter nodded and glanced back to Ben, &quot;So what do you think of the college?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I is a nice college, from what I&#39;ve seen,&quot; Ben commented, &quot;I may want to check with some of the other colleges too... just keep all my options open. Though for certain reasons, Moon Lake&#39;s college has some bonuses that others can&#39;t offer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter chucked and nodded. The fact that Moon Lake College allowed Moon Lake natives to stay close to home where they could be more secure in their were forms  was something many enjoyed. Some didn&#39;t, but that was usually when someone had a really good idea of what they wanted to do and had the money or opportunity to go to a college that gave them the best chance for success with what they wanted to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though we do have some more to see,&quot; Kenya spoke to Ben, taking his arm.<br />
<br />
Ben nodded and Peter even smiled at the sight. On some level he rather liked more small family centered prides that wereleopards/panthers and weretigers formed. They didn&#39;t the sort of power grabs and gossip issues that frustrated him at times. In that sense it was something he envied a little, but he did have Karen and thankfully Liz hadn&#39;t made an appearance so far today as she seemed to be at the center of many of the rumors among the werelion prides.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we won&#39;t hold you up,&quot; Peter said to her, &quot;and besides, Karen and I still need to have lunch. Have a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben watched as Peter walked with Karen, though not toward the main cafeteria but more to one of the other restaurants that were within the Student Union building. Karen waved to him and Kenya, and once the two of them left, Ben and Kenya turned to make their own way out. Kenya smiled as they did so, as it would be her way of showing Ben her part of Moon Lake.</p>
