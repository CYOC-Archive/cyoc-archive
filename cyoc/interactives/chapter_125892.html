<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, why not? Wilson may be a sausage not unlike those packs of seven identical frozen wieners you mother always bought at the supermarket (and the hot dog buns came in six-packs! What was up with that anyway?) but this pink cylinder wearing a miniature suit, bowtie and glasses was still Wilson!<br />
<br />
“Sure-”<br />
<br />
The words hadn’t completely escaped your mouth when Wilson jumped straight at you. Holy shit, this sausage sure has a more muscular lower half than it looks! You were surprised with Wilson’s sudden advances so you tried to shake him away from your clothes as if you were being attacked by a squirrel.<br />
<br />
Except that Wilson didn’t have fur. He was pink and featureless, but his oily skin was getting your clothes dirty anyway, so you yelled at him.<br />
<br />
“Wilson, stop!”<br />
<br />
Wilson didn’t care, he dived under your shirt and forced his way through your chest (eww, he was cold and sticky) until his small pink upper tip (the one that wore glasses, apart from that it was identical to the one that wore pants) stuck out from your collar.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, I’m damn horny. You’d better hide somewhere if you don’t want everyone to see you being fucked live.”<br />
<br />
“You’re being too rough, besides, I’m a top and-”<br />
<br />
Wilson’s featureless head dived under your shirt again and the next thing you knew he was inching like a worm towards your virgin buttocks.<br />
<br />
“Holy crap!”<br />
The sausage wouldn’t listen to reason. It was too late now. Under your clothes the pink worm oogled the hairy forest that was your ass with the clear intention of assaulting it.<br />
<br />
You ran and ran, making sure nobody would notice the strange bulge moving on your shirt, and hid out in the park’s restrooms.<br />
<br />
Thankfully the men’s restroom was completely devoid of any people-<br />
<br />
A hairy beggar snored away in the corner.<br />
<br />
Thankfully the men’s restroom was completely devoid of any decent people, so you locked yourself inside one of the stalls and got ready for the worst.<br />
<br />
Wilson was rubbing his cylindrical body against your buttocks, clearly teasing you.<br />
<br />
“So these are the buttocks that my manly seed will have to honor to deflower first... They are beautiful!”<br />
<br />
Could Wilson even cum in this form? Nevertheless you could feel the sausage becoming harder by the second.<br />
<br />
The sausage shook his lower tip in order to remove his pants and underwear which he threw away through the waistband of your own human pants. Wilson looked with pride at his exposed tip, a pink fleshy tip with a small ‘X’ ready to pierce the hairiest of assholes.<br />
<br />
Wilson kept silence, you were about to ask him what was wrong when you felt something very cold and rubbery enter your rectum.<br />
<br />
“YES! LIFTOFF IS ABOUT TO COMMENCE!” Wilson yelled, unintentionally waking the homeless beggar up.<br />
<br />
Being fucked by Wilson was... weird. Not entirely disappointing, but a rubbery and squishy sausage is not as hard as an actual cock, although it wasn’t like you had any experience to compare it to.<br />
<br />
Wilson’s upper half swayed to side to side with excitement, while his lower half didn’t put much force in its trusts. All in all Wilson was like a fish that had gotten out of the water and was now blindly trying to return to the sea.<br />
<br />
But of course you didn’t want to make Wilson feel bad, so you moaned like it was the best experience of your life.<br />
<br />
Wilson was in ecstasy. “I’M GONNA CUM!!!”<br />
<br />
And Wilson came. However not a single drop of semen came out from him because he was a sausage. What you felt though was Wilson’s body contracting for a few seconds and then... Wilson’s body deflated and fell out from your butt and through your pant leg towards the dirty floor.<br />
<br />
There wasn’t anything wrong with Wilson shrinking after a good orgasm, but you didn’t know that, so the first thing you did was to pick Wilson up to ask him what was happening to him.<br />
<br />
However, the sausage was even more rubbery and oily than you expected, and the moment you grabbed Wilson he slipped out from your grasp and the shrunk sausage fell right into the toilet.<br />
<br />
“No! Wilson!” You cried out at the fallen sausage, its tiny glasses had broken in the fall. You saw bubbles coming out from the toilet water... Was he asphyxiating? You tried to fish him out by grabbing him from the remaining upper half of his suit but it slipped out off him and now the bare naked sausage floated in the toilet water like a pink turd.<br />
<br />
You tried to fish him out again, this time from the middle part, and succeeded.<br />
<br />
“Wilson! Wilson! Are you alright?”<br />
<br />
The sausage didn’t respond. Maybe it had swallowed too much water?<br />
<br />
You burst out from the stall in a hurry.<br />
<br />
“Quick! Call an ambulance, this sausage needs medical attention!” You told the beggar. The homeless person just looked at you like you were nuts.<br />
<br />
“Shit! I’m serious! This is bad!” You laid Wilson flat on the floor. You put your ear on his body but didn’t hear any breathing. You promptly pressed your finger on his middle part but it was no good, you didn’t know how to resuscitate a person, much less a sausage.<br />
<br />
You remembered all the movies you saw when they made CPR to an unconscious person... You looked at Wilson... He was just a naked featureless sausage! What were you supposed to do?!<br />
<br />
You took a deep breath, and engulfed in your mouth Wilson’s tip. Your tongue made contact with Wilson’s sensitive x-shaped mark on his tip, and Wilson’s body jerked back to life.<br />
<br />
“Wilson! You’re alive!” You said with pure joy.<br />
<br />
“Where are my glasses?” The sausage looked down at itself. “...Why am I naked?!”<br />
<br />
As you celebrated, the beggar looked down at his empty bottle of cheap wine. “I’m not ever drinking this crap again...”<br />
<br />
“You fell into the toilet and they got wet, but it’s ok, I have some spare doll clothes at home that I can lend to you.” You explained to Wilson.<br />
<br />
It was certainly different from what you had imagined, but your date with Wilson had been a total success. You’d definitely hang out with him some other time, and who knows, maybe you end up becoming a couple. You still wondered why you had some faint memories of him as a human being, but it was probably something completely outside your control.<br />
<br />
“That doesn’t explain why you applied CPR to the tip of my dick, you doofus.”</p>
