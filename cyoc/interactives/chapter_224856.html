<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex was half asleep in his algebra class, as usual. His elbow rested on his desk, head in hand. A strange fly buzzed around him in the hot air of the classroom, but he was too tired to let it bother him. Suddenly, Alex felt the world spin around him and became dizzy. He sat up straight, sweating as his heartbeat increased. He fell to all fours as he felt his body change, unknowingly shrinking. Two painful appendages protruded from the sides of his body, with another sharp sensation on his back. A burning sensation ran through his legs, arms, and feet as they gradually transformed.<br />
<br />
The numbness disappeared, and he began to focus after a few long seconds. He was on all fours on a strange, hard surface, and as he looked down at himself, he realized that he was naked. Even stranger, he now had two additional arms that he was fully capable of controlling. As he reacted to his new body movements, he felt an unaccustomed sensation on his back. He now had two transparent wings, twitching slightly from his back.<br />
<br />
Wondering what had just happened, he looked around and saw a giant pencil in front of him. He crawled towards it, and after noticing the texture of what he was crawling on, he concluded that he was shrunk on his desk. Especially since he could hear lecturing going on in the background. Confused as to what was happening, he looked up and saw a horrific sight. Beyond an ordinary blue t-shirt was the head of a humongous fly, its massive red eyes staring blankly ahead. It was a disgusting sight as Alex could make out every detail of the vile creature&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Alex, still dumbfounded as to what was going on, turned to the classmate sitting next to him but was shocked to see that it wasn&#39;t her, but a giant humanoid ant. Behind the ant sat a termite. Alex crawled out on the desk to get a better view of the rest of the classroom. There were no other humans, just giant bipedal insects, fully clothed and all sitting at desks. It was like some strange parallel universe. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the fly was unaware of all this. His once simple mind now flowed with new memories until he remembered it was an ordinary school day, like any other, and he was in his algebra class. While paying attention to his teacher, he noticed something out of the corner of his eye. A tiny pink creature, less than an inch long, with wings, crawled around on his desk. A human. &quot;Ew!&quot; he thought as he flicked the tiny vermin off the desk with his fingers.<br />
<br />
Alex didn&#39;t see it coming as the giant finger struck him, sending him flying off the desk in free fall, eventually landing on his back on a stiff surface. Of course, he didn&#39;t know that he&#39;d landed on a notebook, which was a little softer than the tiled floor surrounding it. He thought he had died, but somehow he was alive. Little did he know, his body was much more resilient at his new miniature size.<br />
<br />
Lying on his back, he couldn&#39;t figure out how to roll over. He wasn&#39;t capable of doing it like before. In fact, he couldn&#39;t even remember how he used to flip over. He rocked back and forth like a pathetic bug until he finally rolled over onto his stomach.<br />
<br />
When he turned over, he realized that he was on top of a notebook. Then he looked up and saw a monstrous dark-skinned foot dangling above him. He looked around and saw other books, school supplies, and legs and feet in the distance. He figured it must have been a long fall if he ended up on the ground, though at least the notebook cushioned the fall a bit. <br />
<br />
Next to the notebook was a gigantic moccasin that the giant insect must have slipped off. Alex jumped off the notebook and crawled on the ground toward the moccasin, finally realizing his true size difference. He was small compared to the shoe, let alone the giant insect above him. He was a mere bug. <br />
<br />
While he was deep in thought, the monstrous foot slipped into the moccasin. Suddenly, Alex was surrounded by two huge feet. The ant casually moved her feet back and forth, unaware of Alex on the ground. As for Alex, he prayed that he would not be crushed to death.<br />
<br />
Alex realized it was too dangerous to stay on the ground, and since he had wings, he had better figure out how to use them. He jumped up and his muscles immediately took over. Though his wings took over, he couldn&#39;t control them that well, and he ended up straight into the jeans of the insect who sat next to the ant. Fortunately, his hands were sticky enough to stick to the jeans without falling off. It was a pretty scary but cool experience. He had always dreamed of flying, though perhaps not under these particular circumstances.<br />
<br />
He wanted to try it again, so he jumped off the jeans and flew to the insect across from him. Once again, it was a thrilling experience, and this time, it was a little less frightening as he began to learn how to control his wings. He did it a third time and jumped off, flying to another insect across from him. However, Alex did not expect to land on bare legs, as the insect wore shorts instead of pants. Even though it startled Alex, and the foreign skin was a little disgusting, he kind of enjoyed crawling on the fuzzy skin of the giant insect. It felt funny on his hands and feet.<br />
<br />
While Alex was amusing himself, it didn&#39;t occur to him that the insect could feel him. Though to the massive beetle he was interacting with, it felt like an ordinary itch. Slightly annoyed, the beetle went to scratch her leg with her hand. Alex felt a gust of wind and instinctively flew out of the way as the beetle&#39;s giant hand scratched the spot where Alex had been. <br />
<br />
Alex flew to the nearest surface, which was the underside of the desk. Looking on, he was tempted to try it again. He flew to the other leg and started crawling until the beetle noticed. As before, the beetle&#39;s hand went to scratch the itch, and Alex flew out of the way in time. Alex was amazed at his new lightning-fast reflexes.<br />
<br />
Alex decided to have some fun, so he flew around to the top of the desk and started crawling. The beetle was busy writing when she noticed him on her desk. She shooed him away with her hand as Alex dodged it. Then, Alex began to play a game of annoying the insects. He would fly around and test his reflexes. When someone would notice him, they&#39;d try to hit him or smack him away. But each time, he avoided being hit. It was an amusing sort of role reversal.<br />
<br />
Eventually, after having fun and forgetting his situation, he heard a bell ring. On cue, all the students gathered their belongings and stood up to leave the classroom, while Alex rested on the ceiling to watch. Only the teacher, a bee, stayed behind. While everyone was leaving, Alex took the opportunity to go to the teacher&#39;s desk where the giant bee was going. <br />
<br />
He landed on a coffee cup with some coffee still in it and watched as the bee sat down in her chair. She focused her attention on the computer as she tapped away at the keyboard. After typing something, presumably logging into her computer, she turned to the coffee cup Alex was sitting on. The two made brief eye contact, her massive black eyes staring down at him until she shooed him away with her hand.<br />
<br />
Alex flew away and started flying around the bee&#39;s head. He buzzed around as the bee drank her coffee, taking in the unusual perspective he thought he would never experience. He flew around her antenna, making sure to annoy her as much as possible. The constant buzzing would undoubtedly drive anyone crazy.<br />
<br />
The bee was beginning to get annoyed. Dealing with a class of students was enough of a hassle, now she had to deal with pest control. She put down the coffee and flailed her hand around her head, unable to hit the pesky human. Alex, still enjoying himself, decided to land on the desk. In the meantime, the bee saw an opportunity to get rid of him once and for all.<br />
<br />
The bee scanned around her desk, looking for something to hit him with, while Alex was unaware of her intentions. She grabbed a nearby packet of papers and rolled them up, holding them in her hand as she slowly moved toward the pesky bug.<br />
<br />
SWAT<br />
<br />
Alex didn&#39;t see it coming as the large object struck him, smashing him into mangled bits. He lay there in pain, unable to move any part of his body, although his wings and one of his legs twitched.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotcha!&quot; teased the bee in triumph as she grabbed a nearby piece of tissue paper. Alex was unable to move as she picked him up with the tissue wedged in her hand. He was thrown into the trash like a piece of garbage. He lay in agony for about an hour, his body in immense pain, until he finally passed away like a pathetic little bug.</p>
