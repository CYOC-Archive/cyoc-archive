<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For John and myself the planned vacation was one we'd looked forward to for these many Wintery months. As with the coming of Spring as nature refreshs the land giving great contrasts of color our photo trip should bring wonders to behold.<br />
<br />
Leaving Michigan we traveled by train to Chicago and then boarding another train we traveled to the great state of Wyoming. A rented Jeep would help us go where the roads stopped as we wanted to be well away from mankind and out in the true wilds.<br />
<br />
That was us, two bright and happy young guys just finished with college. As I look back on us we had our lives to live with nothing but success coming our way.<br />
<br />
Instead we found that life to some is not viewed as a time of joy. We were unlucky enough to meet such a man and found our lives to become twisted about his damned desires.<br />
<br />
On our second day we had made a base camp just South of the boarder to Yellowstone Park. Sandwiched between the Park and the steep mountains to the West we had ourselves set for a week of photoing nature.<br />
<br />
The third morning was to be for us an eye opening experience. John and I set up our tripods with camera's attached at two locations along what looked like a worn path near a stream and in a groto valley.<br />
<br />
Then a sound broke the silence as we looked each at the other. Ready to shoot our first frames of nature we wondering what we were hearing.<br />
It was more the sound of a person babbling in anger than the wild sound of some animal. We looked at each other again and went hunched down ready to take a picture of what might burst into view.<br />
<br />
Out from the stand of Aspens came a dark form of some brown to black woolly creature walking uprightly but seemly having the arms of a human with legs of some animal.<br />
<br />
The dark form was rambling about some thought of being captured and now let loose to become a part of nature. It was John who stood up and called out to it as if he took maybe some compassion about the creatures problem. He told me later it was his long range lens which gave him the best view, thus he thought he understood what we saw.<br />
<br />
The creature stopped, turned to look up the hill at us and then a quick look to it's rear made a bolting run up the hill.<br />
<br />
Snorting, huffing and out of breath the creature came up the hill as I clicked shot after shot.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must go, leave go quickly!&quot; said this strange creature.<br />
<br />
As we stood there gawking she came to stand before us her naked raw beauty something to behold!<br />
<br />
A woman in part she was that to be sure but from head to foot covered in a dark almost black skin and her shoulders thick with a brown wool. Her breast though human in form was looking quite bestial as the nipples now black loomed out like teats of some cow.<br />
<br />
Breathing very heavily she was trying hard to warn us of some terror which was following her back in the woods. She turned looking back up the path as we then both had a much better view of her strange form.<br />
<br />
A black skinned face the nostrils looked quite bovine. Her eyes a deep almost black color were like pools a man might get lost within. Yet her upper body was one of great muscled strength. Arms too were black and hairy with a covering of some beastly hair.<br />
<br />
I noded to her thighs as she turned they had such taunt muscle and covered over the that black hide and a thin but dark brown layer of hair. Her foot long tail wisked over wide spread buttocks as sights of her sex was laid bare in our view.<br />
<br />
As we both gazed downward her human thighs merged with a sort of hind leg, hock, long foot and cloven hooves making her like some wierd Minotaur, maybe Buffalo cow.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's coming, you must leave and not come back! I hear him!&quot; she said as her bovine ears twisted and turned to capture the sounds coming down trail.<br />
<br />
John asked who she was, but this seemed to cause her heavy breathing to stop as tears welled up in those large round brown eyes.<br />
<br />
She told us of her travelling to Wyoming and hiking up into the steep ragged clifts for an afternoon's fun. It was well into the backwoods when she came upon a cave but the opening was cleary man made. She entered and looked down seeing bright lights. Wondering she entered deeper into the cave finding not some miners working but instead the science lab of one strange Doctor Louis.<br />
<br />
The Doctor had some other person strapped on a surgical steel table and was injecting the boy while his assistant made physical changes to the boy's ears.<br />
<br />
She told of watching in horror as the two men worked making the boy, maybe in his mid teens change. It was as the Doctor finished his injections he informed the scared teen of his ultimate part in a game of life and death. As the Doctor explained his was to become a human rational minded specimen, a bull Elk! He would bereleased and allowed to finish his changing while learning to live in the open country. Then with the approach of Fall it was his part to be hunted by the Doctor and some associate. It was all a big game of fun between the hunter and his prey.<br />
<br />
The teen screamed as he watched his skin become the hide of some animal. It was as she turned to leave and run out the cave that the Minotaur lady was captured.<br />
<br />
The Doctor's associate was just coming up the mountain to check on what progress was occuring for their Fall hunt. It was he that nailed her with his fist and knocking the lights out.<br />
<br />
She told a horrid story of her rape and then being strapped down to the table as they laughed when she screamed. He informed her of becoming a Bison cow and once a cow she would be placed with the Park nearby for ultimate use as what a cow is for, mounting!<br />
<br />
Having been kept there a month in a cell she was about out of her mind with the feared feelings of changing from woman to a cow Bison.<br />
<br />
She took hold of my arm and urged we leave before the Doctor and his friend come that way. John grabed his camera and was first down the path and heading toward the base camp. I held back with the Bison Lady as out from the trees came the Doctor, his friend, and both sitting high on what looked like fine formed Arabian stallions.<br />
<br />
They did not see us up the hillside but instead took out after John.<br />
<br />
I made mention that the Doctor was well prepared for hunting his specimens, having such horses and all the equipment they carried.<br />
<br />
The lady Bison stared at me and then informed me that the two horses were a pair of brothers caught hiking and made over the Winter into total animals. She had seen them and was told of how the Doctor toyed with them as they changed. He made them mate and mate often when almost totally changed as the sexual feelings would remove their human mentality leaving them as common animals for his enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Seems she had been told that the Doctor was some millionaire and enjoyed his mountain retreat. He had invented a serum which when injected into a human body made it accept the animal cell enhancer to work making the human body change to that of any animal form he desired.<br />
<br />
We talked so long I forgot about John and his plight down trail as the Doctor caught up to him in no time at all. Yet the lady Bison was becoming very affectionate toward me and for some wierd reason I too felt the love growing between us.<br />
<br />
Picking up my camera we went hand in hand down the hillside and in a round about way walking down to the camp. As we came into the camp it was a trampled mess of hoof prints smashing the tent and all our camping equipment.<br />
<br />
Not a sign of John, I looked around expecting to see a pool of blood or maybe a clue. It was as I stood there the Lady Bison suggested he was maybe taken to the cave for some adjustments.<br />
<br />
Her almost cruel manner to which she suggested my good friend was to become some forest animal for the hunt made me mad. I started to yell and with that she ran to me knocking me down and to force me quiet a black nipple was jammed in my mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be quiet and suck this if you are nervous, or the Doctor will return for your sorry hide!&quot; she said rather forcible.<br />
<br />
I imagine it was her tit stuck in my mouth and the sensual touch of her hairy body laid over mine but I began sucking hard. Her milk flowed and with it we began to become both ensensed into making wild bestial love from then to well after dark.<br />
 <br />
With the darkness we parted and my thoughts of John returned. She and I worked our way to the cave and there as she stood watch outside I entered. Like she had told there in the cave made to be a science lab of a wierd Doctor laid John in the midst of a change. <br />
<br />
There was nothing I could do but end up joining him there so, turning I left my friend to his ultimate animal fate.<br />
<br />
The Bison Lady returned to the camp and then went with me in the Jeep as we left the area never to return. I kept the rental and drove us both back to Michigan where she accepted her life here. I got her inside a game preserve and she has over the months changed now to a Bison cow. I visit her often as she remembers me and we frolick together.<br />
<br />
Oh, you ask how we play together? Well having sucked her black nipple of Bison milk that terrible night her body fluids were still quite healthy with the good Doctor's serums. She transfered those animal enhancement properties to me during our time together. Since then I have begun to change and I suspect in time this guy will sneak into the game preserve.<br />
<br />
Oh you think I'm crazy! Here, see this, is this the penis of a man hung from my belly. No its a sheath, the sheath of a Bison bull! See here too as my pants drop down the balls are those of the Bison Buffalo bull and make lots and lots of semen for my love making!<br />
<br />
Then too the color of my lower body, the skin now a bestial thick hide and the browth of the hairs, true it is that maybe within the year I too will become a closer part of nature than my parents ever thought I might become.<br />
<br />
Now here, I show you a map of Wyoming and our encampment was there! If you go make dumb sure you want to be an animal, cause your going to become one like it or not!</p>
