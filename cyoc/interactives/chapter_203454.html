<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Happy Birthday Ty!” Michelle yelled as she waltzed into the room,<br />
“Oh lord…” Ty said, yawning as he just woke up. She was holding a wrapped box in front of her, “you’re kidding,” he said, rubbing his eyes, “I always tell you, you don’t have to get me anything,” he said, unable to remove the slight smirk from his face,<br />
“I’ll stop buying you presents when you stop opening them,” Michelle said, jumping onto the bed next to him,<br />
“What if I just don’t open it then?” He asked,<br />
“Then I’ll be sad,” she replied,<br />
“I guess I’d prefer you be happy…” he said. They both smiled at each other, Ty leaned over and kissed her on the lips,<br />
“So take it already!” Michelle said, unable to keep her excitement any longer, pushing it right onto Ty’s chest.<br />
“Alright, alright,” he said, taking the box. He tore it open with one swift hand movement, almost like a knife to butter despite the excellent wrapping on Michelle’s behalf<br />
<br />
He pulled the two halves of the paper off, and looked upon another small box, this one made of cardboard. Ty realised he could simply lift it up, and lift it up he did.<br />
Inside the box was a small pocket-watch. Ty looked at it, a little confused, but not disappointed by any means. He looked up at Michelle and simply asked,<br />
“What is it?”<br />
“It’s my fathers,” she said, “and his fathers, and his fathers before that,” she explained, “it’s an heirloom that gets passed down through every generation through the first daughter of each generation.”<br />
“S-so… you’re giving it to me?” Ty said, almost feeling like he was going to cry,<br />
“Yeah.” Michelle said, tears welling up in her eyes, “I think…” she struggled through the tears now running down her cheeks, “…I know you are the one,” she said, smiling wide,<br />
“Oh my god, Michelle…” Ty said, unable to hold back his tears. He grabbed her and wrapped his arms around her, hugging her so tightly, knowing he was never going to let her go, “I am so… genuinely privileged that you think I’m… I’m…”<br />
“Deserving?” She said, still hugging him, “because you are,” she said. She pulled her arms away from his body, and held his hands, “you are the man I want to spend the rest of my life with, and I will always be proud and loving of you, no matter what you do or who you are, or whatever is thrown your way. I promise that.”<br />
<br />
Ty was absolutely speechless. He couldn’t do anything but just cry tears of joy and love. He pulled himself together for a brief moment to sat, “thank you, Michelle… thank you so much. I promise, with all my heart, that I will be exactly the man you marry.”<br />
They both stared at each other, and kissed.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
Ty was given his powers at the age of 15. On his birthday exactly, he was given a miraculous power that allowed him to essentially do anything he wanted.<br />
Over the years, with everything gradually going right for him with and without this power, he met Michelle.<br />
Smart, funny, exactly his type at the ripe age of 19. But as their friendship built, Ty found himself admiring her for everything she was. She improved his life significantly, allowing him to move on from his past trauma.<br />
Something about her was so influential to him, so unique that whenever he was around her he didn’t feel the need to use his power.<br />
After he graduated college, he moved in with her, officially dating her. As he spent more time with her, he never used his powers, and eventually they simply disappeared. Ty hardly noticed as it was such a different part of his life.<br />
<br />
Today was his 25th birthday. 5 months ago, he proposed to Michelle in the cafe they first met. Of course she said yes. Their Wedding was close, but they wanted to hold off until they found somewhere they really liked.<br />
But that wasn’t entirely true…<br />
<br />
Michelle’s job, formerly the Accounting Manager for a Law Firm in the city, was laid off due to ‘budgeting issues’. This was of course bullshit, which Michelle saw straight through. She was replaced by a less experienced, less qualified, but ‘bigger’ woman.<br />
The boss, Mr. Peter Fordwick, was always a pervert. He hired Michelle because she was competent. He hired Miss. Anita Reese because she had the best ‘assets’ to handle the ‘assets’.<br />
So of course, Ty was happy to postpone the wedding until Michelle was more confident with her career issues.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
After a long, very amazing breakfast, Michelle walked into the kitchen. She was wearing a tight suit with a low cut blouse, a knee length but somewhat tight skirt, and a pair of formal yet walkable heels.<br />
“What do you think?” She asked, giving Ty a little twirl,<br />
“Oh wow,” he said, looking her up and down, “what’s the… occasion again?” He asked,<br />
“Right, sorry…” she said, brushing herself off, “that meeting for my old job, it got rescheduled to today,” she tried to explain, clearly looking like she had kept this from him.<br />
<br />
“Elle, seriously, it’s fine,” he assured her, “I mean yeah, I would’ve preferred a briefing… but if it got moved, it got moved. I’d prefer you went to it rather than avoided it,” he said,<br />
“Thank you, Ty,” she asked. She turned to face the mirror, “god I hope I get it back…” she explained, “ever since Ms’ ‘fun-bags’ got pregnant, they’re looking for an assistant,” she explained, looking at herself in the mirror, clearly looking at her cleavage, “and I just want that assistant job, then I can replace her when she leaves on maternity, and be better than her so they never want her back!”<br />
“Sounds like a pretty excellent plan,” Ty said, “I know you can get the job. I mean hell, you already got the damn job! Who says you can’t win it back, you’re more than qualified for it,”<br />
“Yeah…” she said, still looking at herself in the mirror, “I’m just not sure they’re looking for my kind of… qualifications…” she said, once again looking at her bust… or lack thereof.<br />
<br />
Ty knew she wasn’t particularly busty, but he never really wanted her to be. She was perfect in every way she needed to be, at least for him. No part of him had ever wanted her to change. But of course, he really wanted her to get this job, so a small part of him kind of wished she had larger assets on file…<br />
<br />
Then it happened… for the first time in almost 4 years… he made something happen…<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
He watched as Michelle’s chest rose slightly. It wasn’t by a lot, perhaps an inch at most, but it wasn’t about the size on the outside. She turned back to the mirror and leant herself down.<br />
Just the same as Ty, her eyes widened.<br />
“Whoah!” She said, looking shocked, staring into her own fairly deep-cleavage, “I-I…” she couldn’t believe it, “d-did I just…” she said, unable to understand what just happened. She stopped, turned to Ty, and said, “a-are… this is gonna sound a little crazy…” she said, looking down into her cleavage, “are my breasts… bigger to you?”<br />
“Uhm…” Ty said, remembering everything suddenly, coming back to him in a blurry form, but definitely there, “…yep…” he answered, nervously,<br />
“S-so… I just made my own boobs bigger… just by saying it…” she said, still in absolute shock.<br />
<br />
After their conversation about honesty not even five minutes ago, Ty knew he had to be totally honest about all of this. He took a deep breath and said, “they’re bigger… but it wasn’t exactly you who did it…” he said.<br />
“W-what?” Michelle responded,<br />
“I think you might want to sit down for a minute…”</p>
