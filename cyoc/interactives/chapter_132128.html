The Reality Watch <br />
- <br />
Nolan made his way up the stairs with the last box of his possessions &quot;Why didn&#39;t I look for a <br />
ground floor apartment...&quot; he sighed to himself reaching the third floor of the small complex <br />
and turning the corner to his door. He opened it and was reminded why, the large window that <br />
filled most of the wall with a view of the roof tops and the green forest covered hills in the <br />
distance. He took in a rewarding breath as he was fully moved into his new apartment. Well... <br />
not FULLY, as the room was still packed with unopened boxes and furniture thrown about it. <br />
He took a deep breath then let out a heavy sigh, discouraged he began unpacking his things <br />
and moving the furniture. <br />
<br />
Nolan or Noal as his friends like to call him, was always very good at creating things. Ether <br />
taking something existing and giving it a twist or sprouting ideas on a whim and applying it to <br />
paper or writing. Some days he&#39;d spend hours on his laptop typing away stories, plots, or <br />
character bios or doodling to the point he&#39;d have nothing left of his pencil. Naturally he<br />
graduated high school, and entered into an art academy which only helped fuel his creative <br />
juices. <br />
<br />
He had just positioned his desk in front of the window when he heard screaming and shouting <br />
coming from outside, a young couple in their mid-twenties paced back and forth in their yard. <br />
The woman was thin with not many curves and had long dishwater blond hair, she was<br />
wearing a black T-shirt and cutoff short-shorts. The man was in a garage uniform, he was tall <br />
and well-built, his hair cut to a short buzz atop his head.  <br />
A yelling match between the two of them so loud it could be heard clearly even from his <br />
height. &quot;I know you&#39;ve been sleeping with that slut Jenny! Angie told me so! Said she saw you <br />
too making out at the field party last week! Which- why the fuck did you lie to me?! Working <br />
overtime my ass, you fucking pig!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I WAS working overtime! And what are your doing talking with Angie? That crazy bitch loves  <br />
starting drama for other people! I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d trust that attention WHORE over me!&quot; <br />
<br />
The argument continued as Noal set up his computer on the desk, during college he&#39;d been <br />
able to sell a few of his pieces and set aside money to pay for it. It was one of his most prized <br />
possessions. Not only was it custom built for his works, but Nolan had another hobby. For <br />
Nolan was a complete, and utter perverted deviant! The computer was home to his vast <br />
collection of porn, hentai, erotic literature, and animated videos. Almost every fetish had an <br />
appeal to him, from mind control and futa to transformation and furry, Nolan was guilty of it. <br />
Even addicted to it in some cases, barely able to go a day without making his rounds throw all <br />
his favorite sites in search for new pieces to add to his collection, but lucky for him he had the <br />
perfect outlet to express it; anonymously posting his works and writings across the web. <br />
<br />
Glancing back outside the couple were still fighting, their neighbors closing their windows <br />
trying to escape the slur of profanities littering the nice neighborhood. &quot;People like those really <br />
need to be taught some common decency.&quot; Nolan said to himself as he to closed the window <br />
in a fleeting attempt to ignore the fighting. <br />
<br />
He continued to sort out his things and arrange the furniture making little progress. Tired, he <br />
collapsed onto his not-yet positioned couch to rest. He yawned and stretched out his legs, <br />
kicking a box over. Its contents spilled out onto the floor, Nolan scrambled to clean it up <br />
realizing it as his old collection of comic books. They&#39;d been in his parent&#39;s attic for years now, <br />
somehow unharmed on that note. <br />
<br />
As he placed them back a torn page fell out of the pile, it was a cliche add for a watch. A <br />
rather  <br />
advanced looking , black and smooth watch with a touch screen, a caption underneath it, <br />
&quot;Control time and space, memory and matter, the advanced and other worldly Reality Watch <br />
by CheckMate industries, order yours today!&quot; <br />
<br />
Clearly this was some kind of joke, though it did look rather cool, and it was only a few dollars <br />
if  <br />
anything it still be a good stylish watch for a few months. Digging through his boxes he found <br />
his  <br />
envelopes and stamps, tore out the add ticket, and sealed with the money enclosed. He <br />
walked to the mail drop box and sent it on its way. The decided to take a walk and explore the <br />
new part of town. <br />
<br />
Noal had only just arrived in the growing city of Dellwyn. His roommate Dan from the <br />
academy had pulled some strings and gotten him a job at his graphic arts studio as a <br />
consultant in advertising, leaving most of the city unknown to Noal. <br />
<br />
He made his way down the sidewalk through the suburbs and into the outskirts of town which  <br />
happened to be a market district apparently. Shops lined the sides of the road, bakeries, delis, <br />
a few restaurants, and even a pottery shop. Soon Noal&#39;s nose couch whiff of a delightful <br />
aroma as he passed a small coffee shop, it almost seemed to call to him. He was greeted with <br />
the warm smell of fresh ground coffee and the sweet bell of a voice from the store clerk &quot;hello! <br />
Welcome to The Local Brew!  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? You new in town?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow is it that obvious?&quot; Nolan replied.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, it&#39;s just the only people who really come here anymore are regulars, I didn&#39;t recognize <br />
you so I went out on a hunch.&quot; The barista had a slight blush to her face. She was a slender <br />
girl about 5&#39;6 with velvet red locks of hair done up in a ponytail and wore a black apron <br />
overtop a brown shirt &quot;I&#39;m Nicole, what can I get you today?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I AM new in town, what&#39;s good?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, how &#39;bout you try the chai latte, it&#39;s quite popular here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds great! I&#39;ll take a medium.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Half or whole?&quot; it was at that moment Nolan&#39;s gaze fell upon Nicole&#39;s breasts, though she <br />
wore an apron her cleavage was still laid out to the world. And a healthy view they were.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Um what?&quot; suddenly returning his gaze, luckily she didn&#39;t seem to notice <br />
<br />
&quot;Your cream, do you like it half n&#39; half or whole?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Whole please.&quot; she turned back to the coffee machines and did her work, quickly returning <br />
with his drink as he pulled out his wallet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hun, no. this ones on the house&quot; she said with a sweet smile, &quot;Consider it a <br />
house-warming gift!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well thank you, that&#39;s very hospitable of you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, just be sure to stop by again!&quot; <br />
<br />
He took his drink to one of the nearby tables and began to browse through a magazine left <br />
there by another customer, occasionally glimpsing Nicole&#39;s round and firm ass as she bent <br />
over behind the counter doing her work. He couldn&#39;t help but imagine what it be like to watch <br />
it expand inside her shorts till it ripped them apart. Before leaving, he doodled a little <br />
sequence of the idea on a napkin and stuffed it in his pocket. <br />
<br />
By the time he finished his drink the sun was starting to set so he decided to make his way <br />
back home. He had been hoping to stop by Dan&#39;s and thank him of the opportunity, but that <br />
would have to wait till tomorrow. Entering the complex he was pleased to see the couple had <br />
stopped their fighting and was nowhere to be seen or heard from, for that matter. Exhausted <br />
he unpacked his blankets and sheets, sloppily made his bed and collapsed onto it. <br />
<br />
Nolan awoke the next day and slowly began to unpack the remaining boxes. An hour in, he <br />
became hungry and having just moved in, his kitchen was still empty. &quot;I think I remember <br />
seeing a McDonalds not far away...&quot; he muttered over his growling stomach. As he stepped <br />
out the door his foot kicks a small box placed outside of it. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; He picks it up and <br />
finds that it&#39;s addressed to him its light and the size of a softball. <br />
<br />
It was his, but he only just moved here. Curious, he opened it to find the watch he had only <br />
just  <br />
ordered yesterday. &quot;Okay...? This is weird, and almost impossible.&quot; he muttered to himself, <br />
not only did it seem to take only a day to be delivered, processed, and shipped to him, but <br />
today was also a Sunday.  <br />
Though he was puzzled by this, there was no point in dwelling on it. He lifted the watch out of <br />
its  <br />
casing and clasped it around his wrist. Immediately its display lit up the screen stated, <br />
&quot;System setting up...&quot; It flashed for only a moment and before reading, &quot;Designate target&quot; a <br />
small icon of a crosshair below it. <br />
&quot;Haha, this is kinda cool, it&#39;s like one of those little spy toys I had as a kid, I bet it&#39;s got a laser <br />
or something too!&quot; he pointed it at the refrigerator and taped the icon. There was a pause and <br />
then the screen displayed a perfect rendering of the fridge, a list of options trailing under it. <br />
&quot;Oooookayyyyy...?&quot; Nolan said aloud unsure what to make of this. The first option in the list <br />
was stock, and being curious he tapped it. The refrigerator shook just once before the watch <br />
let out a quiet *Ding* and displayed &#39;Task Complete&#39; across its screen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Task complete...? what&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot; he questioned. He approached the fridge <br />
and opened it slowly. His jaw dropped as the refrigerator was filled to the brim with food. Milk, <br />
fruit, steaks, salads, sodapop and even his favorite beer brand! &quot;Okay! This is impossible this <br />
was empty I&#39;m sure of it!... unless...! <br />
Unless this watch really works...&quot; he turned his gaze towards the watch in wonder. &quot;Okay, let&#39;s <br />
test this again. If this thing does work, then I&#39;m not going crazy.&quot; <br />
<br />
He pointed the watch at a stack of boxes yet unpacked and taped the icon and selected <br />
&#39;Organize&#39;. In a flash, the lids unfolded and their contents lifted into midair before darting <br />
around the room and into their proper places. Books aligned alphabetically on shelves, <br />
pictures and art attached to the walls, even his PS3 hooked itself up to the TV and began its <br />
startup process even connecting to the PSN. Finally the boxes themselves collapsed on their <br />
folds and packed into the closet. Hours of work done in under a minute. <br />
<br />
&quot;This thing really works! I don&#39;t know how but this thing really works!&quot; Nolan exclaimed <br />
cradling the watch. He ran back to the box and turned it over hoping to find a instruction <br />
manual but found only a small card that said &quot;Enjoy, from Checkmate Industries&quot;. <br />
<br />
He sat in his computer chair still taking it all in, he thought to himself &quot;If this watch can control <br />
reality then I could stop world hunger, cure cancer, stimulate the global economy, discover <br />
new life in space, I could-!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh so now you&#39;re just going to leave! Is that it James? Just keep running away from your <br />
problems, huh?&quot; the couple started screaming across their lawn again just as they did <br />
yesterday  <br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to work Maggie! You know that thing that pays the rent and for you to sit at home <br />
and yell at me all day!  <br />
<br />
&quot;God, they&#39;re at it again.&quot; Nolan peeked out the window and sighed. Then a twisted grin came <br />
onto his face as he looked back down to the watch &quot;Hmmmmmm, I wonder what this thing <br />
can do to humans.&quot;  <br />
<br />
He pointed the watch at the couple and selected them. This time the display showed most of <br />
their information: Name, Birth Date, Work, Mother and Father, and a tab for Personal History. <br />
Underneath that still were more tabs: Control, Read Mind, Filter, and Edit. <br />
<br />
The first two were easy enough to understand, the second was a bit difficult to grasp, and  <br />
selecting it unfolded the tab into four other options: Unfiltered, Target Aware/Public Unaware, <br />
Target Unaware/Public Aware, Selected Aware, and All Unaware.  <br />
Confused by this, he continued onto Edit, which had him excited the most as be believed just <br />
what he could do with it. It expanded into four options: Personality, Size, Appearance, and <br />
most promising of all, Transformation. Nolan grinned ear to ear, Edit would let you completely <br />
change a person or persons, as he&#39;d suspected. <br />
<br />
Transformation was one of Nolan&#39;s earliest and most favored fetishes, having an entire<br />
external hard drive dedicated to that branch of his collection. Suddenly the filter made more <br />
sense now, allowing Nolan to transform his targets without arousing the public or vice-versa. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, lets see who&#39;s telling the truth first before I go any further.&quot; He looked at their personal <br />
histories for the past few entries. It seems James wasn&#39;t lying; he had been working overtime <br />
on the accused night. Maggie, on the other hand, was worse than she sounded, for the past <br />
month she&#39;d cheated on James with one of his coworkers while he was working. &quot;Tisk tisk <br />
tisk, Maggie. Seems you will deserve this. Now what was it you called James yesterday? Oh <br />
yes! I remember now...&quot; he turned the watch and entered the commands being sure to make <br />
everyone unaware, not wanting panic on the streets for a test. He did a drum roll on his desk <br />
then slammed the Apply icon. <br />
<br />
The couple still fighting over Maggie&#39;s general mooching didn&#39;t notice the changes happening <br />
to her thanks to the watches filter, but Nolan watches anxiously for his handiwork to take <br />
effect. Soon Maggie&#39;s face becomes smug as her nose turns up, he clothes become tight as <br />
she began to gain weight. Her gut flopping out under her shirt, and her ass quickly filling in the <br />
short shorts that she wore, the seams already starting to burst.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;s this always about me? Why don&#39;t you grow a pair and demand a raise from your <br />
boss!&quot; Maggie screamed to James as her mouth pushed out along with her nose creating a <br />
snout, two teeth growing sharp and pointed reaching out past her lips turning into tusks. Her <br />
ears grew pointed and crept higher up her head.  <br />
<br />
Underneath her shirt three matching sets of breasts began to form and grow under her<br />
original pair. This strained her shirt to its breaking point as each pair of breasts exploded into <br />
something past double D&#39;s. As her stomach inflated to the size of a beach ball, forcing her <br />
new breasts to part to the sides around it, her pants soon followed suit- as her thighs and ass <br />
cheeks became filled with fat, each cheek now the size of basket balls with a small curly tail <br />
sprouting from just above her crack. <br />
<br />
As Maggie stood in the open, completely naked now and none the wiser, she continued to <br />
accuse James of more untrue acts, pointing her finger at him rapidity her fingers merged into <br />
three digits, a thick nail forming around their tips as her feet did the same, merging together <br />
and fattening into trotters, bursting her shoes to bits. Thick hair began to grow under her arms <br />
and likewise between her legs, the follicles coming to a peak at her belly button which had <br />
become an outie, and similarly filling her ass crack. <br />
<br />
The final changes took place as she seemed to double in weight, causing rolls to form around <br />
her ankles, knees, wrists, elbows and ending with a jiggly double chin. Her hips widened to <br />
help support the new weight and also make room for another expansion. The bush between <br />
her legs parted as her nether lips bloomed through, growing three times their size.  <br />
<br />
&quot;SNORT, Whatever James go bang that slut Jenny, you GRUNT pigs belong <br />
together! I&#39;m SNORT done with this shit! PFFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTT&quot; A loud and <br />
monstrous fart exploding from her ass as Maggie trotted back into the house, now outwardly <br />
the fat, lazy pig that she truly was.  <br />
<br />
Nolan&#39;s jaw dropped. &quot;Thathahataha really just happened... I turned that woman into a<br />
massive pig, she didn&#39;t even know it was happening, I just watched it, and I still can&#39;t believe <br />
it!&quot; he looked to the watch which displayed &quot;Task Complete&quot; then went back to the menu <br />
screen. Nolan set his hands on his lap still trying to take it in when he felt the rock hard bulge <br />
in his pants. He&#39;d been so overwhelmed by the event that the ecstasy of it was drowned out. <br />
He fought the urge to take care of it and finally relaxed. <br />
<br />
Looking around the room he was all moved in thanks to the watch, he also had plenty of food <br />
again, thanks to the watch. He didn&#39;t have his first day of work till tomorrow so now he had the <br />
rest of the day to himself. Thanks to the watch. He lifted it into the air and said &quot;Well what <br />
should I do with you next?&quot; the devilish grin returning to his face.</p>
