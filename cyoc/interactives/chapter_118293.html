<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kevin awoke to Barbara slowly pulling out of his pussy, she was resting her body weight still on Kevin. Kevin felt her cock was still quite rigid, and knew that was a normal thing for her youthful body.<br />
<br />
Barbara noticed Kevin stir beneath her and slid off onto the bed next to him, with a loud slurp from Kevin&#39;s pussy when she was finally free. Kevin opened his eyes, wanting to be filled again. Both remained silent, as they walked into the shower, as they were both slick and shiny from Kevin&#39;s strong scented body lube. Kevin relaxed his body a couple of times in the shower, letting the egg white globs wash down the drain.<br />
<br />
Barbara noticed this, and broke the silence by saying, &quot;Uh...that is egg white mucus, which would mean your ovulating, or at the very least you are about to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin noted, &quot;I don&#39;t thing either of us have normal reproductive systems. Hell, the last time I had a bowel movement was the morning we went out and bought that box. I am not hungry for food, rather I am hungry to suckle from your cock. I drink when I get thirsty, but you have taken care of that since you got here. I have read the first volume and most of the other two, and I feel that we have just barely experienced what is possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barbara knelt down behind Kevin, and closed her hand into a fist, then slowly slid it up and into Kevin&#39;s ass. Kevin stood rigid, bracing himself against the wall of the shower while Barbara worked up to her elbow before she found a blockage, possibly a cervix. Barbara pressed firmly on the blockage, causing Kevin to cry out in both pain and pleasure. Barbara slowly pulled her hand out while keeping her hand in a tight fist. Barbara moved around to Kevin&#39;s front and repeated the same exploration into Kevin&#39;s pussy, watching the bulge of her fist slide above his navel before hitting a blockage there. Barbara wiggled her hand deep inside Kevin, &quot;You seem to have a very female system, but not a normal one.,&quot; observed Barbara. She pulled her coated arm from Kevin&#39;s pussy and stood up to clean off the egg white slick mucus from her arm.<br />
<br />
Kevin caught his breath and relaxed a little, &quot;It felt like you put your whole arm inside me. How far did you go?,&quot;asked Kevin.<br />
<br />
Barbara showed him the point right before her elbow. &quot;Here.,&quot; she said. &quot;Do you want to research how to restore your body?,&quot; Barbara asked.<br />
<br />
Kevin shook his head no, &quot;Not for a while. We both have the same fantasy that we are living out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barbara held her cock up and rubbed the semi-rigid but full length member under her breasts, &quot;I have to agree with you there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin put on a robe and went to get the paper in his front yard, finding the box John left. It was another box of paper. Kevin took the box back to his bedroom. Barbara was  in his desk chair, naked, reading one of the volumes. Kevin took two books and resumed his seat on the toilet. The two of them would spend their time reading or having sex in the shower, since Kevin&#39;s bed required bedding changes the first few times they used the bed for sex.<br />
<br />
The first week came and went, before Barbara took an idea to Kevin she found in a book.&quot;Right here,&quot; she said, touching the words on the page, &quot;We can have the books put into our minds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin read the passage, but did not get the same conclusion, &quot;We need to study more.&quot; Kevin went to the box, and dropping two reams in one at a time, and pulling out two more volumes, one at a time. Kevin and Barbara were thorough in their research, but not happy. Hours later, Barbara re-read the large letters by Kevin&#39;s finger, that the keeper of the box, Kevin, was not able to receive the complete explaination of the box and its workings. That was only for the prime designee, which was Barbara, according to how the prime designee is chosen and registered with the power of the box. Kevin was adamate, he would not allow Barbara to understake the the process. Kevin warned her about the lack of specifics in the text, and that there was a big risk that he might lose her.<br />
<br />
Barbara was respectful of Kevin&#39;s concern, but she insisted, knowing that the risks were unknown based on the vague wording in the text. Barbara took the box and Kevin&#39;s biggest bed spread into the bathroom, and made it so that the bed spread was tucked into the four corners of the box, closing the bedspread was closing the box. Barbara put in the items, or at least their equivalents, into the box end of the bedspread before crawling into the middle and wrapping herself into darkness.<br />
<br />
Kevin watched from the toilet, wanting only to sit still and not touch the extension Barbara had made. Every few minutes, Barbara would pull back the bedspread and wave Kevin over to do his part.<br />
<br />
Barbara finally got out for good about an hour later. &quot;Fine,&quot; she said, &quot;I will search for more information.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin woke up on the shower floor with Barbara, who was suckling on his sensitive breasts. Barbara sat up when she realized Kevin was awake, then said, &quot;More time, and we found nothing. We can get back to sleeping in a bed with cloth sheets if we know how to control this better,&quot; then Barbara smeared her fingers on Kevin&#39;s wet, slick pussy.<br />
<br />
Kevin sighed, &quot;Alright. I cannot prove it, but I know we are missing something and we are rushing this. Let&#39;s do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barbara crawled over to the bedspread and closed herself inside it. The floor was too slick to stand, so Kevin also crawled over to the box. Kevin put his hand up and said, &quot;I do this in protest, but you are right...it feels good, but we need to know how things thing works.&quot; Kevin touched the box.<br />
<br />
Barbara then opened the bedspread, &quot;Touch it already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did!,&quot; exclaimed Kevin.<br />
<br />
Barbara got up and pulled the bedspread out of the box, and shook the bedspread over the floor, nothing fell out. Barbara looked to Kevin, &quot;Something happened. The other items are gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin looked to Barbara, &quot;Maybe we did it wrong, or those were not the right items.,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Barbara looked at Kevin, &quot;Hell, I don&#39;t know. Let&#39;s keep digging, if it&#39;s in these books, we will find it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin sighed in relief, Barbara was still here. He was so afraid when he touched the box hat she would disappear and be replaced by something else. Still, he did agree with Barbara that something happend, and the vague text about this process kept him watching Barbara for any signs of change. Kevin smiled, &quot;Do you think you could find something to let me control this mucus as you call it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Barbara thought for a moment, &quot;I read something about that. Hold on.&quot; Barbara went through parts of five books before leaving the bathroom and returning with two items, and she grabbed something from his medicine cabinet, putting those into the box. &quot;That might do it,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you put in there?,&quot; asked Kevin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two golf balls, some medical gauze, and a latex glove.,&quot; responded Barbara. Barbara took the closed box over to Kevin.<br />
<br />
Kevin touched the lid for a moment before opening the box, and pulled out a rubber thong that was slightly bulged where it would rest against his anus and pussy. Kevin stood up and stepped into the slim rubber, and pulled it up and into place. He felt the thong get sucked into his ass and pussy. Barbara watched as the latex went into the bottom of his pussy, then came out of the top. A few moments later, for the first time in nearly two weeks, Kevin no longer had that urge to release the next glob of lube.<br />
<br />
Barbara touched Kevin&#39;s pussy lips, split apart by the latex, &quot;Well, did it work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin craweled back into the shower, turning on the water for a thorough cleaning. Barbara took the opportunity to clean the bathroom floor of Kevin&#39;s slick fluid. Barbara met Kevin at the entrance to the shower with a towel.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does it feel&quot;, she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It feels like someone is pulling my ass and pussy apart, but other than that, it&#39;s freedom. I had the urge to constantly go before this, and I haven&#39;t felt the need to in over 30 minutes.,&quot; Kevin proudly proclaimed, and hugged Barbara.<br />
<br />
Kevin slowly knelt down, bringing his face level with Barbara&#39;s crotch, &quot;I do feel a different need right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barbara gasped as Kevin took her cock all the way into his throat, and begain rocking back and forth while swallowing and massaging her cock. Barbara did not last long and erupted deep into Kevin&#39;s throat. Kevin leaned back and took several deep breaths after holding his own for a long time.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s next?,&quot; Kevin asked as he smiled and looked up to Barbara.</p>
