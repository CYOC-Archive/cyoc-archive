<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle waddled his way up the wheelchair ramp, Jarred following close behind. His cock blocked most of his view, and his hips threatened to rub on each side of the ramp. Every few steps he&#39;d bump into one side, then the other, his steps uncertain with all of his hanging, swinging, jostling flesh. Each step was almost too much for his dainty hooves, and threatened to send him careening back onto Jarred, not that he would have minded. Kyle was anxious about it though, since he knew he weighed almost 800 lbs now, and didn&#39;t want to crush his friend.<br />
<br />
Eventually they made it up to the door, where Kyle froze. He pressed his six and a half foot long cock into it, feeling the soft, flaccid flesh push against it as he tried in vain to hit the handicap button. Jarred squeezed past him and hit it for him, much to his relief and embarrassment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kyle said, blushing, and got a squeeze on his ass in return.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Anything for you,&quot; Jarred said, smiling.<br />
<br />
Kyle pushed on inside, glad that Jarred had let him go naked from the waist down. His hips dug in painfully on the doorframe, and he was sure if he had been wearing anything more suitable for modesty than his thong, he&#39;d have torn it in half in the process. His balls dragged on the ground, further destabilizing him as he pushed through. Jarred leaned against his ass, pressing far into it, but with a grunt and a stumble Kyle was in the building. He stumbled forward a few steps, finding his hooves less than adequate to get grip on the laminated floor, before finally catching himself against an adjacent wall. His ass heaved back and forth as he caught his breath. He dabbed sweat from his brow, and huffed. Jarred stumbled forward too with the sudden motion of his friend, barely able to stop from falling onto his friend&#39;s soft, pillowy rear, or his massive beanbag-like balls.<br />
<br />
Kyle collected himself, and started waddling towards his first class. He pushed himself sideways through the door this time. It was easier, except for his cock bobbing several feet in front of him. He was getting used to leaning around it already, but the bobbing was annoying. He snaked it through the doorway while he stepped sideways through it, entering the classroom with a loud plop. Everyone looked up briefly, and some laughed quietly as he took his place at the front of the class. Awaiting him was a specially reinforced desk, three normal desks in width. He plopped into it, and it creaked and groaned from his immense mass. His cock slammed into his face from the motion as his ass sloshed behind and around him. He sighed, and rubbed his sore face while it settled back into its more forward position. He almost wished he didn&#39;t have a sheath running halfway up his torso, so it could rest on his balls, but there wasn&#39;t anything he wanted to do about that now. Not here, not with any of these people. Who knows how they might change his curse now, in this universe.<br />
<br />
His next few classes went by as smooth as they could. He could hardly pay attention, not with his churning balls, massive cock, and soft ass begging to be squeezed. He had to fight himself from absentmindedly slapping and playing with it all morning, especially because of how soft his skin now was. He noticed as the day progressed that he had less and less leg hair, until he was almost smooth as a baby. He was glad, not knowing how he&#39;d shave this much flesh.<br />
<br />
Each bell made him painfully aware of his subtle growth spurts, each doorway slightly harder to fit through than the last. Finally, 2 hours later, and a full foot longer than he was this morning, the lunch bell rang. He waddled his way to the cafeteria as quickly as his bulky lower half would allow him. His stomach growled.<br />
<br />
He got into the lunch line near the end, due to his slow pace. A few jocks behind him laughed, before one gave his ass a loud slap. He yelped, a higher pitched noise than he anticipated. It stung, and he had to keep himself from crying in front of them. They laughed as another pinched his ass, and pressed their hand an entire foot into his soft flesh. One pulled on his tail. Now he had to stop himself from moaning, wishing that they would stop playing with his ass like that. It felt... wrong, too forward a taunt. But maybe being (nearly) naked from the waist down gave his bullies a bit more leeway, he thought, as another pushed his cheek up and down while the rest snickered to each other.<br />
<br />
Finally, he got to the front, and the custodial staff layered pound upon pound of food onto his tray. He looked around, and it seemed like he was getting 10x, now 15x the amount of food as everyone else. Evidently this was normal, since no one was looking at him weird, but the tray was soon hard to carry. He had to set it on his ass behind him, the shelf finally coming in handy for once as he walked to find Jarred.<br />
<br />
It pressed warmly into his shelf as he walked, distracting him. His balls dragged beneath him and his cock bobbed ahead of him as he peered around it, looking for Jarred.<br />
<br />
 &quot;KYLIE!&quot; A familiar voice rang out, and he looked to the side to see Jarred waving him down. He waddled over to the seat and sat his tray down before maneuvering into the seat(s). He squeezed his nuts under the table first, so they wouldn&#39;t get pinched later. His legs splayed out as he shuffled into the seats, pinned between them and the table. His thighs dug in as the seats creaked, close to breaking under his mass, but he didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bit bigger, huh?&quot; Jarred asked, looking at his cock. Kyle blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; He swallowed. &quot;I just... can&#39;t believe I&#39;m still getting bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait to see how big you end up,&quot; he said, smiling. Kyle hadn&#39;t even thought about that, too caught up in the moment. >i>I still have 24 hours to go after this, don&#39;t I?</i> he thought. He put the thought out of his mind as he scarfed down his mountain of food, his belly pressing against his sheath by the time he finished. The two talked and talked, while Jarred stroked his hand lightly against Kyle&#39;s thigh. His torso was a few feet from Kyle&#39;s due to his spread, but he didn&#39;t mind.<br />
--<br />
The rest of the day went as well as it could, with minimal taunting from his classmates. Jeers here and there, but he was used to that. He sighed as the final bell rang, and his cock and lower body lurched again. He&#39;d started out the school day with a six foot cock and ended it with an eight foot one, much to his dismay. It pulled even heavier on his sheath as he walked, his hips a good three feet wider, too. He was a few inches taller, by his reckoning, as well. His legs still felt powerful, but they had to support his 900 lb body. He was out of breath constantly, fighting the motion of his cock and his cheeks with every step, his tail swishing behind him. Jarred was already waiting for him, tailgate open.<br />
<br />
He heaved his bulk into the bed of the truck, causing its suspension to sag again. &quot;Keep it up and you&#39;re walking,&quot; Jarred joked, and Kyle wanted to remind him who was making him grow like that, but it was clear Jarred knew. They drove home, and Kyle practically fell out of Jarred&#39;s truck. His hooves clacked on the pavement as he waddled his way back inside. His mom wasn&#39;t home yet. He opened the fridge, looking for a soda, and found a note he hadn&#39;t noticed before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to be out of town this weekend. Here&#39;s $300 bucks, have as much pizza as you want! I know my growing boy needs it! XOXOXO Mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
He ordered pizzas to his heart&#39;s content, tipping the delivery guy graciously. He just stared, slack jawed, at the hyper-cocked horseboy who answered the door, barely registering that all of the pink flesh in the doorway was him. He stammered, clearly hiding a rock-hard erection, and bolted for his car after taking the money. Kyle shut it, blushing, before digging in. He sent his mom a thank you text, with the pizzas laid out on his thighs.<br />
<br />
He squeezed into his bedroom. He pulled off his hoodie and mesh undershirt, tossing them to the side. He also tried to slide off his thong, but it snapped halfway down his ass. He jumped a bit, and it stung. &quot;Guess that&#39;s the last of you, huh,&quot; he said aloud, rubbing his ass. It had grown visibly since this morning, so he wasn&#39;t very surprised. He waddled over into his bathroom to clean up. He debated how he was going to reach the sink to wash his face off. His cock stuck out almost 9 feet ahead of him, and his hips jutted out comically to the sides. He settled on pressing himself diagonally into the wall, with his cock pushed against one side and his hips digging in at the other. He could barely reach the sink, but he splashed his face and cleaned the makeup off. He then turned, slamming his cock into his shower painfully. With a yelp, he stepped back, his huge hips hit the sink. He cried out, defeated by his proportions, before leaning into the shower again and turning it on.<br />
<br />
Stumbling into the shower, he hosed himself off. The grease from the pizzas ran down into his newfound folds, and he forced his sponge between them. It felt odd to dig into his own soft flesh like that, but it also felt really, really good. He then held his sheath out a bit from his huge cock, plunging his sponge deep into it to clean it. Normally he didn&#39;t do this on his own, but it felt good. <i>Normally I don&#39;t do this at all!</i> he thought, protesting the normality of his new life for a second, before going back to his routine. An industrial blow dryer awaited him now, not unlike a car wash. It dried his ass well, but left his tail looking poofy. He brushed it and his hair out, before climbing into bed.<br />
<br />
His bed protested as he put his full mass onto it. Shuffling into the middle, he managed a comfy enough position to sleep. On his side was uncomfortable, and on his belly was out of the question, so he laid on his back. He put a pillow down by the end of his ass shelf, and laid back on it. It felt bizarre, laying on himself like that. He tried not to think about how huge his thighs were, each much larger than his torso now. His ass was warm, and it felt like laying on a heated mattress. His tail was pinned uncomfortably between his torso and his ass, but there wasn&#39;t much he could do. As soon as he laid down, his cock slumped back onto his face again, the sheath pulling it down. He grumbled, pushing it off to the side, but it returned like a heavy, meaty pendulum. He settled on holding it, like a body pillow, and quickly fell asleep. His phone buzzed with a text from Jarred with a few too many heart emojis, and he fell asleep with a smile as his body surged again.</p>
