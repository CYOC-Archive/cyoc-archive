<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler Pug&#39;s stay at the hospital in Dino City wasn&#39;t all that long and once their staff was &quot;confident&quot; that he was recovering well enough that he was allowed out and would move from the hospital and then Horizon&#39;s facilities in Dino City, which were surprisingly connected to the hospital. He had to go through a set of hallways, but they were still connected. As he came in and the nurse from the hospital staff departed, he was met by Albert Slash and Jeremy Green. The two standing together gave for an interesting comparison between two, though Tyler also figured that he would be different from them. After all, Amargasaurus was a Sauropod, not a Theropod.<br />
<br />
&quot;This won&#39;t hurt, will it?&quot; Tyler wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It shouldn&#39;t,&quot; Jeremy spoke from beside Albert, &quot;some things may feel &quot;odd&quot; at first... but the only way it&#39;d hurt is if you try to keep your clothes on all through the transformation... Amargasaurus might be &quot;small&quot; for a Sauropod, but you&#39;ll still be big enough that what you&#39;re wearing right now won&#39;t fit. I can handle the shot for the double dosing and you will have the privacy for the transformation... and anything related to it... and fresh clothing that will fit you will be available when you&#39;re ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The shirt might need to be a button down one,&quot; Tyler spoke, &quot;or really loose... I don&#39;t know on how long the neck spikes will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy nodded as Albert stepped forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;And once your transformation is complete... I will show you to where you will be staying while performing your community service,&quot; Albert spoke, &quot;and perhaps you can even tell me a bit on how well your band has done...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler smiled and nodded at that. It was still surprising at how accommodating Dino City&#39;s Police Chief was with regard to things that related to his music.  He then followed Jeremy into the conversion room. They weren&#39;t too different from those at the Horizon facilities in Lyre/Animalia in layout, but were scaled up to suit the larger sizes that Dinotopians could reach. The most that Tyler did was to pull off his shirt and toss it to a side on the bed. He managed to climb up on top of the bed and began slipping off his shoes and socks. His shoes clattered a bit as they hit the floor and he put his socks down next to his shirt on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rex may wish to run a base examination with you once you&#39;re done... he has some other work that he&#39;s been on with the museum and park facilities where he&#39;s doing a lot of his research with regard to Dinosaur and Dinotopian anatomy,&quot; Jeremy spoke as he rubbed a spot on Tyler&#39;s arm with an alcohol swab and then delivered the injection with the volume of the Amargasaurus strain to equal a second dose, &quot;and some of that may end up counting toward you community service, but a lot of that will be up to you and Sergeant Slash.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler nodded as Jeremy finished the injection and gave the welcome to Dinotopia and then left. Tyler could already feeling things getting warmer for him as the cells in his body began to morph and change as the Amargasaurus strain of the Animalia Virus entered his system. Some things were pretty quick and Tyler could see it as he looked down to his hands. They were already darkening into a reddish-brown color as the nail the index finger swelled on it. Some of the other fingers were also growing thicker and more robust, which fit in with what was seen with Sauropods in that their front feet was more of a hoof-like structure than anything else and he&#39;d seen with regard to Dino City&#39;s present Sauropod Dinotopians was that their hands included some similarities with the hand bones in hooved mammal Animalians in many ways, but MUCH larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome,&quot; Tyler managed as he flexed his and felt a surge of power go through his body and made everything feel alive in a way.<br />
<br />
This surge of power made his pants and underwear feel rapidly tight, as though Tyler was growing in size and growing quickly. The room&#39;s décor was pretty spartan in nature, but with the bed&#39;s height becoming less of an issue, Tyler could also be aware that he was growing and growing into the sizes that some of the larger non-Dinotopian Animalians reached and as such he needed the room to grow and didn&#39;t want to destroy his old clothes. As such, he rapidly slid his pants and underwear down and stepped out of them. As he did so, he could also noted that the bed&#39;s height was also more acceptable, a little high but he no longer had to climb onto the bed. He could actually sit on it if he wanted to. And with his belly, arms and legs turning to a brownish red color with surprisingly &quot;bird-like&quot; skin/scales covering his body. He couldn&#39;t see any feathers, but the scales weren&#39;t exactly lizard-like either.<br />
<br />
Tyler also found that surge of power had also seen his muscles enlarge in a way that stood out on frame. His biceps, triceps, pectorals, and every other muscle group surged outward and pulsed with each movement and Tyler found himself flexing and looking over to his shoulders and arms just to see that pulse in his growing muscle. As he did so, he also noted that the coloration of the scales at his shoulders was darkening into a blackish-brown with some grayish-white striping that seemed to band around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Tyler commented as he felt his head begin to rise up and push away from his body. The bones in his neck seemed crackle as new neck vertebrae formed and created for him the sort of physical build that all Sauropods were known for, their long necks. Of course, from what he&#39;d read, Amargasaurus belonged to the family Dicraeosauridae and their necks weren&#39;t as long as other Sauropods were, at least with regard to their proportion to rest of their bodies, but in a way they were longer than other comparably sized Dinosaurs. For the moment, his neck was still flexible enough as the vertical spines hadn&#39;t grown out yet. In this, Tyler was able to see and a small nub begin to push out from the base of his spine. Again, he could hear the crackling sound as new vertebrae formed to form his tail, but it didn&#39;t hurt... and his interest in this had left him not noticing that his hair had all fallen out, as it had for all Dinotopians.<br />
<br />
And then the changes in his head and neck hit their final stages. His face cracked and snapped as it pushed forward into the low muzzle that Dicraeosauridae Sauropods had, which wouldn&#39;t be too different from the relatives of Diplodocus as well. The alterations to his skull would change how his teeth fit together, but as Tyler ran his tongue around the inside of his mouth, he found that the only changes to his teeth had been to see the molars grow larger be better able to grind plant matter. It was different from how Sauropod teeth were in the fossil record, but Tyler wouldn&#39;t complain. The other thing was pushing sensation on the back of his neck, as two spines grew out on the back of his neck and grew to a relatively impressive length for his overall size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... this is what I&#39;m talkin&#39; about!&quot; Tyler declared and flexed again while also moving his neck to test and see how much the spines on the back of his neck limited his movement.<br />
<br />
He found that the spines could be a bit of a limiting factor, as if one spine hit another it couldn&#39;t bend any further. It limited the rage of motion that Tyler had with regard to twisting or turning his neck in a way that would let him look around. Thankfully he found that his neck was long enough he could still see around him and that was good. The best thing, though, was that after the time he&#39;d had with his addiction to  ecstasy, the conversion into an Amargasaurus Dinotopian had cured him of it. He no longer felt the need for it. For the first time in a long time, he felt healthy and clean. It was like the way he felt before he&#39;d accidently been exposed to ecstasy for the first time and it felt good to be clean again.<br />
<br />
He carefully made his way to the door and opened it enough to stick his head out, &quot;If my new clothes are ready... I&#39;m ready for them...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The post transformation exam wasn&#39;t too bad and eventually Tyler was able set about getting himself settled in. He walked with Albert along the sidewalk that lead to the hotel tower that was set up.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re setting me up in a hotel?&quot; Tyler asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since what records we have indicate that ya&#39;ve come from out of state, there wasn&#39;t anything available to live in,&quot; Albert answered, &quot;and since you&#39;ll have some community service to fill... there will some official business to handle. And while there are plenty of houses that are open for sale in Dino City for new residents... I can&#39;t say how furnished they are. It might be easier for ya to move in if ya want to, once ya&#39;ve got some reliable source of income.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically I could do that if you have a recording studio,&quot; Tyler answered, &quot;my band hasn&#39;t sold too many albums... and we&#39;re normally in Oklahoma...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why Oklahoma?&quot; Albert wondered as he looked over and down a bit. Tyler was now taller and the size difference between them wasn&#39;t as great, but it was still pretty clear that the Amargasaurus Dinotopian was smaller than the Giganotosaurus Dinotopian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... my base player and drummer were from there,&quot; Tyler commented, &quot;so we stayed around there and lived along the Red River. And we could then travel south to Dallas or north to Oklahoma City and record there. And on occasion we got some concert gigs in Dallas and Houston, too. And if you have a recording studio... we could record here and sell locally as well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I don&#39;t know about a recording studio,&quot; Albert commented, &quot;but I&#39;d think you&#39;d want to sell to more than just Dino City and Glen Rose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We do try to sell all over,&quot; Tyler answered, &quot;though some times it takes time to come up with songs for an album... as you can&#39;t go over the same theme all the time...&quot;<br />
<br />
Albert nodded. He traditionally preferred the style of rock that Elvis started with, but he did grow to like some of the bands that came later and he liked that to a degree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... I&#39;ve had some ideas in relation Animalia... Dinotopia and my own conversion,&quot; Tyler continued, &quot;I might be able to talk the others into moving down and you could have your own local band.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be up to you, though,&quot; Albert answered, &quot;remember my job is to enforce the law... and right now building a department for Dino City. So I can&#39;t be scouting out houses, recording studios, and so on for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Tyler answered as he looked around at some of the building fronts. They looked clean enough, and in this it was likely that picking up litter might not be the only thing that his community service would be. &quot;In the meantime... do you know what my community service mission will be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now as we&#39;re building up to Christmas... the plan would be to work with some deliveries,&quot; Albert answered, &quot;both Dino City&#39;s Council has put in some deals with Glen Rose&#39;s to provide some gifts to shelters and the elderly in the area. Some of it is take a sort of wagon and carry the gifts to them. Some are pretty generic toys for kids or gift cards for adults... Things would help them along. Both groups have small group that&#39;s agreed to work together on the whole party. You&#39;d come to Dino City&#39;s City Hall and come in, the council member associated with the project will meet with you and you&#39;ll then head over to Glen Rose as part of the delivery plan. It should be something fun to do for Christmas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And after that?&quot; Tyler wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That might just be some picking up any loose litter in the park,&quot; Albert answered, &quot;if you don&#39;t fill out all the hours that will be assigned before the school year starts... the Glen Rose School District might even accept you as a guest speaker to talk about staying off of drugs... since you converted to get clean and recognizing the battle against addiction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t Dino City have a school?&quot; Tyler wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have the buildings,&quot; Albert answered, &quot;but right now... all the Dinotopians are adults... I think there is one whole family of Maiasaura, but I think they&#39;re all in Lyre/Animalia in Nevada... I think for right now... they&#39;re just waiting for when people start settling into Dino City as it were. In this they&#39;ll have to wait for awhile before Dino City will need a school... though with some of the married couples, it won&#39;t be too long before the first eggs in Dino City are laid... And some of that could mean either family conversions are coming or some parents convert and move here, and even if their children don&#39;t convert they&#39;d need school to. But that&#39;s still something for the future. And a present, only Glen Rose would have a school that has students for you to talk to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; Tyler answered as they walked along.</p>
