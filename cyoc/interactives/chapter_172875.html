<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Still here, but definitely need a safer and saner job. Maybe chain saw juggling? he says with tongue firmly in cheek.—tmw.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The newest werelions of Moon Lake cuddled together as Rose and Richard Van Direstag laid in bed together.<br />
Neither had initially planned to join were society in any form, but after Richard accidentally became a werelion, the more his wife stared at the new version of her husband, the harder she found herself able to resist him until it reached the point where she became his werelioness.<br />
&quot;After all, if we are going to stay together like I want us to, I&#39;d have to become a were at some point, and in all honesty, I&#39;d prefer the were to turn me to be the man I married... regardless of what kind of were he is,&quot; she told him.<br />
Yet neither could resist their new hormones and had another intimate encounter of the sexual kind.<br />
The fact that Rose didn&#39;t have any were birth control pills, regardless of what species she became, was a moot point now. They would welcome any cubs they were blessed with.<br />
Yet Richard couldn&#39;t help wondering what his wife was thinking about now as another smile crossed Rose&#39;s muzzle.<br />
&quot;Penny for your thoughts,&quot; he said, his paw gently caressing her furry back as she felt his leonine rod still deep within her.<br />
&quot;Remember when Sheila Wiggleston offered to induct me herself last night?&quot; Rose asked, looking up at him.<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; he said cautiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just thinking. She said that it was only natural for male lions to form their own prides and as long as they didn&#39;t try to claim any already spoken for lionesses, the werelion king of Moon Lake, err... what was his name again?&quot;<br />
&quot;Talbot, I think,&quot; replied Richard.<br />
&quot;As long as you don&#39;t try to claim someone else&#39;s woman or are foolish enough to challenge him for his title, we&#39;ll fit right in with the rest of the werelions around here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. So?&quot;<br />
&quot;I was just wondering...&quot; Rose began, snuggling closer to Richard until their noses were touching. &quot;How would you like to start our own pride? Together.&quot;<br />
&quot;What? You and me? Having some kind of co-leadership?&quot; he asked in disbelief.<br />
&quot;Sure. Why not?&quot; Rose asked in return. &quot;After all, it would technically still be the Van Direstag Pride, unless you can think of a better name for our group. With all this new werelion knowledge running through my head and what I recall seeing in that handbook Samantha Twist gave us, I don&#39;t remember anything against it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Err...&quot; Richard began, not knowing what to say. On one paw, the thought of doing so thrilled his werelion self no end.<br />
On the other hand, to have all those women AND his wife still bothered Rose&#39;s otherwise faithful husband. Sheila was one thing, but <b>this?</b> &quot;You&#39;re proposing us having an open marriage?&quot;<br />
&quot;Now that we&#39;re both werelions, we&#39;re gonna be having one anyway, right?&quot; Rose asked in return.<br />
&quot;I hadn&#39;t really thought about it. The only thing on my mind since that mountain lion attacked you was making sure you were alright and trying to save our marriage,&quot; admitted Richard. &quot;I never should have been so pig headed about weres, let alone thinking we could escape Moon Lake without one of us complying with the town&#39;s Mandatory Were Law. I just didn&#39;t foresee it being me, let alone what would happen afterward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I have absolutely no problem with my new life on the horizon,&quot; Rose said with a smile, as she nuzzled her husband. &quot;Besides, I couldn&#39;t admit it to myself before then, but Sheila&#39;s offer was tempting. I had a few... options in college, but I never took anyone up on their offers. Now I can&#39;t help wondering what it would be like to taste a werelioness. Especially one that had just been fantastically fucked into multiple orgasms like you&#39;ve given me so far.&quot;<br />
&quot;Umm...&quot; Richard said, trying not to stutter or make any more mistakes. &quot;Well... I mean... that is... how—?&quot;<br />
&quot;We definitely start with Sheila,&quot; Rose answered, as another smile crossed her muzzle. &quot;Just picture it. Our proud male lion having wild sex with one of us while the other lady receives pleasure from the one being taken care of by you. Or just us two women doing what comes naturally as you take a short rest break before seeing to our needs again.&quot;<br />
&quot;Rose, I...&quot; Richard began, and then before he knew it, the werelion was ejaculating into his mate again just from contemplating her words.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re interested. I can tell,&quot; she said slyly, before Rose started purring in contentment.<br />
&quot;I never could lie to you,&quot; Richard said, once he calmed down again. &quot;But are you sure about being willing to share me? And what about you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not talking about bringing any more werelions into the picture. Just lionesses. You&#39;re the only man I&#39;ve ever loved or want in my life,&quot; Rose said before kissing him. When their lips parted, she added, &quot;Besides. You have to remember. I wouldn&#39;t just be sharing you. I&#39;d be sharing myself with whoever,&quot; Rose reminded him. &quot;We&#39;ll just keep it simply between you, me, and Sheila for now. And as for whether or not I&#39;m sure...&quot;<br />
Before Richard Van Direstag knew what was happening, his wife had shifted positions and was now on top of him. Her furry breasts bounced before his eyes as she voluntarily went up and down on his still hard shaft, urging it even deeper into her moist depths.<br />
Richard couldn&#39;t help himself and reached up to caress and suckle at his wife&#39;s tits, even as he thrust his hips harder in unison with her movements.<br />
Neither one would last much longer before experiencing orgasmic bliss together and collapsing into each others arms again, but so enraptured in the moment and each other, neither Van Direstag glanced at a clock nor realized what time it was.</p>
