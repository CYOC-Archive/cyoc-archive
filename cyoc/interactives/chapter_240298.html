<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vince stared out the bus’s barred-up window, his eyes glazing over while he watched as city turned into suburbs turned into the endless fields of nothing characterizing rural America. The other juveys bustled around the transport bus, the three dozen teenage boys stirring up a heat wave of body odor as they opined on the change in venue where they’d serve their terms. At first they thought they’d just end up in a juvenile detention facility, but suddenly they were just told they were going to some dingy old farm far out of state.<br />
<br />
“It’s great!” a smirking, sixteen-year-old Latino boy named Marcel chuckled. “Fuck! I would have gone insane if I was locked up all day! Thank Christ I’m not gonna be couped up in fucking kiddie-jail!”<br />
<br />
“Bullshit! Fuck you!” Another Latino boy who looked no older than fifteen spat. “They’re just doing this cause those fuckers wanna save money by renting us out as slaves instead of just locking us in prison! They’re gonna be whipping us to plow the fields and shit every day, man!”<br />
<br />
“Does it look like I give a fuck, Dante?” Marcel leisurely folded his hands behind his heads to confirm he didn’t. “Vacation for me when I was a kid was going to my gramp’s farm where he worked me half to death every day! I don’t give a fuck what they want me to do, at least we get room to move around!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah?” Dante growled, “I got a whole year just cause I tried to fucking drive away from some cop that pulled me over, I was just in my mom’s car, I wasn’t doing shit!” Dante fumed, face turning red. “I swear the fucking cow shit fumes are gonna drive me mad come this time next year! It’s on them for putting me here if I try something!”<br />
<br />
“Well, If you ‘try something’ and start some shit, they’re gonna make your stay even longer!” Martel snorted. “I gotta do a whole year for robbing some old bitch’s house. Every kid here has at least a year, so don’t get all pissy about your sentence!”<br />
<br />
Dante threw his head back against the bus seat, just thinking about the next year infuriated him so bad that he instantly cut off conversation with the other boy. Marcel, even the blabbermouth, looked around to try to find someone else to shoot the shit with.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Darius, right?” Marcel stood up, nudging the sixteen-year-old black kid that was sitting in front of him on the shoulder. “What are you in for? How long do you gotta stay?”<br />
<br />
“Fuck off. I’m not saying shit to you, man.” Darius cursed, clearly in no better shape than Dante was. He glared out the window, looking at the simple pastural surroundings with utter distain. “I swear, touch me one more time and you’re gonna regret it, kid.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, whatever.” Marcel mumbled before retreating to tap on Vince’s shoulder. “How about you, man? What’s your deal?”<br />
<br />
“I did nothing.” Vince murmured in a dull monotone; eyes fixed on the nearby farms with a thousand-yard stare.<br />
<br />
“Come on, man, that’s fucking weak! Just be a man and admit what you did.”<br />
<br />
“I swear I was framed.” Vince’s voice rose a little as he finally averted his gaze towards Marcel. “I was doing good, and god dammit I was getting good grades for the first time in my life. I had this community college lined up for me to go to…”<br />
<br />
The fifteen-year-old’s head drooped down, trying to recall what happened.<br />
<br />
“These fuckers who I thought were my friends said I helped them bash some middle schooler’s teeth in!” The boy’s fists were trembling, his head shifting to a seat several rows in front, eyes sneering at the boy in the aisle seat.<br />
<br />
“Fucking Julian over there…” Vince grit his teeth. “That fucker’s girlfriend was then one who curb stomped that kid and he wanted to save her ass so both in them tied me into it! Now I’ve got a year in juvey and my prospects are completely fucked. I’d be lucky if fucking McDonalds hired me now!”<br />
<br />
“Huh. Sounds bad.” Marcel smirked, joining Vince in staring at Julian. “Are you gonna try and do something to him to get back? You gotta be careful not to get caught, but hey, it sounds like he deserves it if you ain’t lying.”<br />
<br />
“I’m thinking about it…” Vince murmured. “He’s gotta tell the truth to unfuck me, if he turns on his girlfriend, I can totally get off. But if he doesn’t – yeah, I’m gonna do something to him. Might not be anytime soon. Might be years from now. But he’s gonna get his karma someday.”<br />
<br />
The bus bolted to the side. Marcel toppled on top of Vince as it screeched into a bumpy turn, running up a dirt road to the farm they were going to be held on.<br />
<br />
The warden ordered them out, the line of three dozen orange-jumpsuited teenage boys vacating the vehicle as they lined up just outside one of several barns on the property, Marcel snickering as he turned to whisper in Vince’s ear.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” He wheezed, “Look, it’s a fucking petting zoo! They’re making us tend to a fucking petting zoo!? What the fuck is even going on, man!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it’s fucking crazy.” Vince agreed, peering out in the distance seeing no clear end to the property. “Looks like it’s a lot more than a petting zoo though. They’ve got cattle and horses. They’ve got their fingers dipped into a bit of everything it seems.”<br />
<br />
The two were interrupted as the juvey transport bus unceremoniously left in a puff of smoke and dust, warden and all. For a stretched-out half-a-minute, none of the boys said anything as the authorities just left them stranded in the middle of nowhere. No one said a thing until they realized no one was there but them now.<br />
<br />
“Did they just fucking haul ass outta here? Not even a word?” One of the juveys finally broke the silence. “The warden left too? Are we just alone?”<br />
<br />
More murmurs rose from the crowd of boys, some worried, others already giddily discussing whether to just walk away and commute their own sentences. There planning was interrupted as the barn door abruptly swung open, a group of kids coming into view as they addressed the crowd of boys.<br />
<br />
“Sorry! My dad owns the place but he’s busy, so I gotta handle orientation!” a brown-haired boy in glasses called out. He looked about thirteen-years-old and awkwardly rubbed the back of his head as he got their attention, “My name’s Lou, and this whole farm program my dad got us into is brand new to us too, so y’all just bear with us and cooperate and it should be over right quick!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah! Behave, criminals!” another kid stepped up from behind his brother pointing an accusing finger at the group of boys. He looked like he was just maybe nine or ten years old.<br />
<br />
“Hey, don’t antagonize them, Kyle.” Lou pulled his little brother back, making sure to hold back the younger girl who stood to his side just for good measure. She looked similar to Kyle, having the same dirty-blonde hair as him, suggesting they could be twins. “That goes for you too, Cara.”<br />
<br />
The little girl didn’t say anything, instead opting to stick her tongue out at the juvenile delinquents, convinced they deserved a good bit of teasing. Some of the older boys just started to chuckle, one of whom even started to advance on the trio of farm kids, cackling deviously along the way. It was Darius.<br />
<br />
“The fuck are you gonna do?” He smirked, standing two heads taller than Lou, folding his arms to his chest, self-assured. “How about you tell me what’s gonna keep us here? Do you have a gun or something?”<br />
	<br />
Lou looked nervous but stood his ground, pulling out a boxy looking tablet strapped to his shoulder. The back read “Chronovac”.<br />
<br />
“Darius, right?” Lou asked, pointing a sensor on the back towards the encroaching prisoner. “Oh dear, eight years? It looks like you were supposed to spend two years in juvenile detention before getting swapped to adult jail to do the remaining six. I guess you’re lucky you’re gonna be spending those eight years with us instead.”<br />
<br />
Darius tensed, twitching a little as he looked over Lou, surprised that the kid knew so much about him.<br />
<br />
“And you’re in for. Oh.” Lou bit his lip nervously. “Sexual assault, battery, ra-“<br />
<br />
“Alright! Shut it! Shut your mouth!” Darius roared, grabbing the boy’s shirt in a fist before raising Lou up in the air, slamming his back against the barn door. The Chronovac on his shoulder dropped out of his hands, Lou wincing as Darius’s other hand looked poised to cave his face in. “I’m tired of your shit! You’ve got ten seconds to give me the keys to one of those trucks you’ve got parked over there by the house, or shit’s gonna get messy!”<br />
<br />
“Put him down!” Kyle leapt against Darius’s jumpsuit leg, tugging at the rough polyester fabric before the six-foot-tall offender easily kicked him onto his butt. Kyle hit the floor hard but instantly got back up, this time grabbing the boxy object hanging from his waist and pointer it towards the attacker! It was another Chronovac.<br />
<br />
“Take this!” Kyle shouted dramatically like he was summoning a make-believe superpower, causing Darius just to laugh right in Lou’s face.<br />
<br />
“What, did you take a picture of me?” He began laughing harder, his fist squashing Lou even harder against the door. “You farmer pieces of shit are so fucking retarded! Buncha country bumkin retards up in- “<br />
<br />
A skid and a ‘thunk’ sounded at as Lou suddenly fell to the ground. Darius wasn’t even paying attention to the kids anymore, instead shaking as he saw why his grasp on the boy failed.<br />
<br />
The rest of the onlooking prison boys could hardly see what had happened, but they could hear it. Sickening crackles sounded emanated from Darius. It was the same sound you’d get from cracking your knuckles, but it occurred at an impossible rate, with the frequency of popcorn kernels bursting over a hot pan. The black kid’s face reflected his sheer horror as he realized what was happening. In a matter of moments, he no longer had a hand in front of him anymore. It was replaced with a cloven hoof.<br />
<br />
The terrified juvey turned to look at his fellow prisoners only to see them gawking at hist hand. He rotated back towards the farm kids, wordlessly asking what the hell was happening as his stiffening arms forced both his hooved limbs in front of him, his jumpsuit starting to feel tight.<br />
<br />
Lou was still gasping for breath on the ground as he slinked away to recover, but Kyle was more than happy to tell, pointing at Darius with a sanctimonious grin.<br />
<br />
“Not so tough now, huh?” Kyle snickered, enjoying the sight of the offender beginning to keel over, the crackles lengthening into disturbing snaps as bone and muscles cleaved and reformed, tightening and reattaching to new insertion points fit for something other than a human. “This is what you deserve! This is how you’re gonna spend the next eight years here!”<br />
<br />
Darius bellowed out a terrified gasp at the revelation, his vocal cords trying to strum together human words, but only managing strained, bestial cries. In a burst of orange fabric, his ass shunted free of the confines of his jumpsuit, chocolate-colored human skin growing taut as his ass stretched like it was getting filled with lard, splotchy paths of black and white peach fuzz sprouting from his where his body hair should be. An extrusion of flesh sloughed out his spine like toothpaste getting squeezed out of its container, a foot-long tasseled tail draping between his ass cheek as they pouted and fattened obnoxiously.<br />
<br />
The crowd of teenagers looked on with the opposite reach to Kyle, mirroring a terror no different than Darius’s. The black kid’s body fought to stay upright, limbs flailing as they lengthened and bulked up like he were being controlled by the strings of a marionette doll. Vince thought the sight was reminiscent to a monster from Alien. It looked like something big was crawling under his skin, adding mass to his thighs, ass, and belly as it wandered underneath his skin!<br />
<br />
The impressive musculature that Darius was so proud of got seeped in hefty layers of fat, strong cow muscles buried under a plush body as his cow hide started to thicken, swiftly removing and trace of humanity from his rear as the snickering Kyle approached the older boy’s flank with a Magic Marker.<br />
<br />
“So, let’s see!” Kyle hummed with a smug smirk as Darius fought to stay on two legs, his prison-issued shoes peeling away as another pair of growing bovine hooves stole yet another part of the boy’s body. “It was eight years, right?”<br />
<br />
Cara nodded, the boy happily returning a nod to his sister as he uncapped the marker and brought the felt tip to Darius’s inhuman flank. He made a single stroke, causing steam to erupt from the juvey’s new cow hide as if he was getting branded, the dark-shaded line Kyle drew tattooed permanently into the changing boy’s flesh, Darius’s flabby body shaking like Jell-o as he saw it!<br />
<br />
It didn’t seem to cause Darius any pain, but at this point he was afraid of anything the kid wanted to do to him! Kyle grinned pompously at the changing teen’s head as his neck started to lengthen, taking the opportunity to draw yet another vertical line then another and another.<br />
<br />
Each stroke made the prisoner’s ass vibrate like an earthquake was happening, a burst of thickening cow flesh billowing outwards over and over again with each damning strike that Kyle drew. The smaller boy finished, drawing a final strike through the first set of lines, revealing that he was physically tallying Darius’s eight-year sentence into his hide, the prisoner splaying his front legs to prop himself up against the barn door, knowing that once he drops onto all fours he won’t be able to get back up.<br />
<br />
“And he was bad here too! He hurt Lou!” Cara added, Kyle agreeing again with his sister. “How about you give him even more time to serve, Kyle!”<br />
<br />
If the horror shown going on in front of them wasn’t enough, the other juveys gawked at what Cara suggested. They couldn’t just add more time! Even the dumbest among them knew it was in contempt of the whole justice system to make a punishment like that without a trial. Kyle carried on anyway, smoke searing Darius’s flesh as he added even more tallys, stealing away more of his humanity with each stroke.<br />
<br />
“One, two…” Kyle giggled as he branded Darius with a new set of five strikes, signaling ten whole years as livestock, but he wasn’t done yet.<br />
<br />
“Three, four…”<br />
<br />
Darius’s teeth began to clattered as if her were shivering in fright, but instead they were changing too, devolving into blocky herbivore gnashers to suit his new diet. Along with his changing teeth, his nose suddenly extruded right out of his face forming a long bovine muzzle and a thick, dopey pair of lips where his mouth used to be. His nostrils flared, snot drooling from his pinkening nose as tears dripped down his fuzzying cheek. His eyes grew and pulled to the side of his face, short black hair shedding as his ears tugged to the top-sides of his head, also getting buried in cow hide.<br />
<br />
Darius let out a miserable guttural groan as that tight orange jumpsuit that once loosely draped his body now clutched him so tight it was hard to breath! The buttons tensed as they tried to hold in the tidal wave of bovine girth that was forming underneath. Yet as pounds and pounds of fat continued to heap underneath Darius’s thickening bovine hide, the buttons started to pop off one by one until the jumpsuit was little more than a shredded tarp over top the juvey’s fat, bulky body. The boy that had been standing there just three minutes earlier was now almost completely lost to his new bovine form as Kyle made a final thirteenth strike.<br />
<br />
“Five extra years sounds good!” The younger boy said decidedly as he playfully slapped Darius on the flank, the former-human whining with a distinctly bovid moo! “While you’re here, your our property, ya hear? Ya better get on my good side and be a good cow or I could just draw a few more years as a cow whenever I want!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah!” Cara balled her hands into fists as she cheered her brother on. “And if you’re really really bad we’ll just make hamburger out of ya, so you better shape up!”<br />
<br />
Darius lowed out another remorseful moo, his body shaking as he strained to prop himself up against the door, hardly holding on! Kyle kept laughing at Darius’s efforts to retain even a sliver of humanity, the boy dipping underneath the cow’s belly as he started to pinch the spotted hide at the tail end of that massive, fatty barrel of cow stomach. Cara giggled along as she watched Darius squirm, the little girl’s head twitching to the side as if something caught her attention before abruptly running off into the side of the barn, remembering to get something.<br />
<br />
“Come on, girl, give it up!” Kyle snickered as Darius stomped and spat out moo after moo. It quickly became clear what the little farmer boy was doing, that skin where he was pinching starting to grow raw, the skin disfiguring like putty as Kyle rolled it in his hands, forming several fatty sausage-shaped protrusions of flesh!<br />
<br />
By now, the onlookers were all frozen in fear, watching what was one of the strongest kids among them almost entirely shifted into a hearty, over-sized dairy cow! The cow turned to the other boys, mooing as if pleading for help, but none of them dared stand for him, lest they suffer the same fate. Each of the other delinquents wordlessly wondered what could possibly going on in the cow’s head. They could only guess as to whether Darius was still in there or if he was being slowly erased, whether he was in intense pain or some sort of sordid pleasure that are at his human soul. Some even wondered what it’d be changed into a girl like Darius was; an animal girl, no less.<br />
<br />
Each of them knew what Kyle was trying to create, after all there was one thing every cow needed. Kyle started to tug on each over-sized pink nipple, squeezing them so hard that Darius screamed bellowing moo, suddenly losing his footing on the door as his spine cracked, trapping him on four legs! However, Darius didn’t seem to want to bother with standing anymore. At this point he was just trying to move away, stomping his clumsy hooves and arching his head back to try to dislodge the boy from the super-sensitive spot. But Kyle was very experienced at milking.<br />
<br />
Right from the start there wasn’t a hint of gentleness in how Kyle was yanking Darius’s teat, the boy putting all his weight on those over-extended nipples, tugging so hard it looked like the cows belly was distending. A beachball-sized mass of hot-pink cow flesh began to pull away from Darius’s belly. It was the rest of the udder, throbbing and gaining size until it got squashed right between the former-human’s pudgy cow thighs, leaving the cow in utter shock. He lowed and kicked like he was in a frenzy, the cow rearing his head and stomping his hooves, Darius clearly in distress as his new mammaries leaked tiny drops of milk as his hindelegs clamped around them. Despite wanting more than anything to get away and save himself from this feminine fate Kyle was forcing on him, he didn’t dare try to run – he was risking even longer like this if he made him mad.<br />
<br />
“Come on, I know that feels good!” Kyle said as he stopped tugging, patting that meaty protrusion of cow udder, leaning against that squishy bulb of feral tits. “Cows looooovve getting milked, and you’re gonna be no different, big mama!”<br />
<br />
The cow tried to deny it with a moo, but he was starting to look dizzy, all those bursts of pleasure rocking from her udder giving him a high that no drug could replicate. He sloughed out drool-slickened moos, his shuddered cries starting to sound more than a mating call than a siren of distress! That sustained moo grew higher pitched, the former-human rearing his head up as he almost collapsed, feeling Kyle setting both his hands on her rear two nipples to tug yet again. But this time, Darius felt something extra, Kyle setting his mouth on one of the front teats, starting to suckle like he was simulating a calf!<br />
<br />
Kyle lavished him with the full calf experience as he bit and sucked and tugged and licked, felating that thick cow nipple as Darius bucked and writhed, the animal fighting to deny how much he enjoyed it – what he had become.<br />
<br />
As Darius blasted out bellow after bellow of shameful lust, Cara returned to the front of the barn holding an absolutely gigantic black bull in tow. It lacked any tally on it’s rump, signaling this animal was an au naturel bull, and he clearly viewed Darius like an au naturel cow.<br />
<br />
A long tube of black bovine sheath gleamed with sweat as jostled underneath the bull’s belly, steam glistening from the tip as it leaked out what at first looked like a rather small penis at first, but it didn’t take long to see it was anything but a shrimp dick! Cara smiled at her teenage-boy audience gawking at her as she yanked the bull’s sheath back, showing that just a few inches down it became as thick as any human boy’s and the longer it got, it just kept getting thicker and thicker. As the bull obnoxiously mashed his snotty black nose right underneath Darius’s tail, Cara tugged the bulls sheath all the way back to his testicles, his watermelon-sized oblong balls shaking as the bull’s entire dick plopped free for all to see. From tapered tip to sheath it was 28 inches and judging by how ravenously he tongued the former-boy’s ass, he intended to use all of it!<br />
<br />
Darius was torn between unimaginable, mind-melting pleasure and what feeble hope he had to retain his humanity. At first, he half-heartedly tried to throw Kyle off as the little boy breastfed from him, but as the milk began to flow his hooves stayed flat to the ground, the cow humping his udders against the human’s face as if asking for it even harder!<br />
<br />
But that giant bull coming on scene changed the trajectory of the cow’s lust, the newly minted beast lowing out shuddering animalistic cries as the male anima’s tongue sank into his ass. It was the sloppiest kiss Darius had ever had, the bull literally rasping that tongue so deep inside that he tugged out some of his rectum, causing it to swell into a door-knob-sized ring of doughy, pink cow anus.<br />
<br />
The bull lapped that thick tongue against his chops as he inspected lower, finding a shriveled nub of chocolate-skinned human-cock barely holding onto existence, stubbornly trying to maintain Darius as a male. For the bull, that wouldn’t do at all, and he sunk his mouth over it just like he did the cow’s tail hole, thick rubbery lips caked in webs of syrupy drool sucking that pseudo-penis into his maw. The bull pinched they wrinkled excuse for manhood deep between his lips until it unceremoniously spat out the last ball-full of human cum Darius would make for at least 13 years. The bull swallowed it, adding that sticky fluid to his sopping wet drool as he began to focus that tongue on Darius’s nub of dick. As he jabbed that flaccid human dick against cow’s rear, it caved inside a rapidly forming sinkhole of feminine heat, Darius’s once proud manhood inverting into a birth canal as the tip fused to the surface, creating a blushing pink stubble of cow clit.<br />
<br />
Darius broke. In that cacophony of new sensations and sex, the cow jammed his rear at full-power against the intruding bull, swallowing his muzzle in his fat bovine muff for a few seconds as his beefy labia kissed the sides of the male’s snout. The bull huffed and lapped before he withdrew, shaking the gobs of cow cum from his lips as he hopped his massive frame atop Darius’s body, laying on the former-human’s rear and clutching her fatty haunches as he began to do what studs do best.<br />
<br />
The of juveys could hardly watch as Darius lost all sense of fight, the bliss piling upon bliss becoming far too much for him to withstand. His once turgid, strenuous bleats for rescue had changed into lurid bellows of pleasure, his body glistening with sweat as he voluntarily subjected himself to sex with a beast – accepting himself as a beast… as a female farm animal.<br />
<br />
The cow’s legs strained but held, her body that was evolutionarily designed for little more than this one task, able to withstand a bull that was more massive than a car! She rocked back, her newly formed cunt gushing a waterfall of boiling hot bovine lube as the bull’s near meter long dick speared against her giant wobbly ass, spewing super-soaker-sized blasts of watery bull pre that clung to her rear, making her entire ass slick with his lube. Cara giggled as she grabbed the bull’s cock in both hands, guiding the male in to ensure the naughty former-boy became a mother!<br />
<br />
Darius was now in full agreement, drool seeping from her lips as Kyle kept milking her, that river of cow cum splashing across her throbbing labial lips as the bovine’s udders suddenly bulged out yet again. They grew thicker and fatter, those pink nubs of nipples capping her udders bulking into mouthfuls of tit that even Kyle struggled to fit inside his mouth! Her body was preparing for her inevitable station as a brood-cow even before her new black bullfriend came, Darius already dreaming of all the calves she would birth for him.<br />
<br />
The air around the two sizzled with an acrid fog of bovine sex, the smell so sultry it would be hard to breath it in without getting erect! The two tons of beefy bovines got fixed into a rhythm, cow butt and bull loins slamming together in loud, raunchy thrusts. The bull’s penis slurped deep inside Darius’s rear, her old male gonads transforming into bovine ovaries just as the beast on top of her mercilessly hammered his thick, meaty maleness deep inside her still transforming cunt.<br />
<br />
Darius’s belly bulged out even fatter as her new womb formed deep inside her, the bull’s hot-pink rod of bovine pride already prodding against the depths of her bestial cervix, spelling the end for his testicles as they changed into bovine egg-makers. Darius moaned like an animal, eyes glazing over in unrelenting bliss as that tapered cock tip kissed that last, tight sphincter of her womb, the cow’s lust overflowing into a climax right as the bull stuffed several inches of slimy cock tip deep inside her uterus!<br />
<br />
Darius’s swollen cow pussy burst like a dam, an off-white deluge of girl-cum painting her mate’s giant scrotum in in a gooey glaze of steaming hot female need. The bull wasn’t far behind her, his balls immediately seizing up, injecting her with a liter of bestial sperm each time his thighs mashed against her rear, stuffing her so full with seed that every inch of her new reproductive system was painted white. Darius could practically feel the sperm claiming his womb, intertwining with her calf, forcing her to experience motherhood as a feral animal!<br />
<br />
A puddle of cum widened around the pair, their hooves soaking wet with their lust as they continued to slam into each other for another two minutes straight, Darius riding at the throws of post-coital bliss as just another farm animal. The bull unceremoniously pulled out, his giant length nearly scraping against the floor as a splash of seed glutted from cow’s cunt, one final errant cum shot splattered against the back of her udder, smearing it on Kyle’s face. Darius was in a daze, just standing in place as her pussy lips throbbed, dribbling out streams of cum that oozed down her ass, further painting her mammaries in a glaze of steaming hot, goopy semen.<br />
<br />
Kyle strapped a halter to her head without any fuss from Darius, pulling her deep into the barn as the cow obediently followed next to him.<br />
<br />
“There we go, finally being a good girl!” The boy snickered, “Darius, was it? Well, it’s Dalia, now.”<br />
<br />
The cow didn’t oppose it. In fact, it looked like she was nodding along with him as she strode along the boy that had sentenced her to thirteen years as a cow. Dalia occasionally nudged the boy towards her belly as they walked with her snout as if she was begging for him to tend to that full, throbbing udder of hers and milk her again.<br />
<br />
As Dalia was brought into the barn, vanishing among the other animals as she went to spend the next decade as a cow, Lou came back into view, the eldest of the farm children having finally recovered from his bout Darius, a bandage fixed along the bridge of his nose.<br />
<br />
“Alright!” Lou adjusted his glassed, pulling out his Chronovac again. “As all y’all can see, you’re not gonna be able to resist it and fighting will just get you a longer sentence. Whatever livestock ya change into is pretty much random so don’t ask for your favorite animal! If you don’t fight it, it’ll happen quicker and smoother too! So now I need all y’all to line up so we can deal with you one at a time!”<br />
<br />
The group of juvenile delinquents began to panic, realizing that the loss of humanity of wasn’t just a punishment for trying to fight, it was the reason why they were all here! The line of boys jostled around each other as every teenage boy tried to swap to the back of the line to delay the end of his personhood! A few tough guys looked like they were about to cry, others calculated whether they could make a run for it, and Vince just stood there, unable to believe that a damned fluke of the legal system was about to turn him into livestock!</p>
