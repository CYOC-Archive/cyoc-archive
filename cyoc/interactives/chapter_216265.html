<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas woke up to the alarm going off. Both is parents were already driving to work when his 7am alarm went off. Half asleep, he staggered to the kitchen, his ass was so empty, he reached for the sack of fresh eggplants, taking two out and slicing off the top and the stem. He felt so empty....he rubbed olive oil next to the stove onto the eggplants, and in a few moments, was working and clenching his ass, pulling both eggplants deeper into his bowels. He was better now, and more awake. He prepped a third eggplant, one of the smaller ones in the bag, and slid the oiled eggplant into his anus. He was steadily clenching and relaxing his ass as he rubbed between his legs where his cock once was. The orgasm was slow, building deep in his ass and prostate, until it crashed throughout his body, his finger doing a steady work of rubbing and pressing a very sensitive spot left by his former penis, where he was able to come down slowly from the multiple waves of throbbing pleasure. Thomas realized it was his job to get more eggplant when the bag got low. Thomas was aware of this reality more, and slowly went back to his bathroom to get a shower. He turned on the massage jet and pointed it on his tight anus, then on the spot where his cock once was. &quot;No hands free showergasm,&quot; thought Thomas. Thomas stepped out of the shower and dried off his chest and back. He put on his new shirt, socks and shoes and went to school. He was the tallest person at his school, but that was not the biggest change. The whole school was into one or more sports, and every teacher was a coach. Thomas sat through several classes and was thinking how basic this all was to him. Thomas knew what he was having for lunch, and that was in the locker room for the school pool. His three relay teammates were eager for Thomas to milk them dry, which usually took 45 minutes. The next three hours were spend doing laps, sprints, working on the cardio machines, and weights. Thomas and his friends went their separate ways when the final bell rung. Thomas carried only his shirt out to the car, wearing his socks and shoes, then drove to the mall. He was having a hard time keeping the old reality straight as the new memories replaced or were added to the old. Thomas walked into the magical clothing shop, but not recognizing why...it felt like he had been here before. The shop keeper at the sales counter was an older man, and Thomas went up to ask a question, but he did not know what to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thomas, welcome back sir,&quot; the old man answered.<br />
<br />
Thomas in a blink had his memory fog cleared, and had total clarity of both realities. Thomas looked around, sure this was the same shop in every way from the place he came from. &quot;I don&#39;t have 10,000 dollars, but I&#39;ll pay $99 more. I just need to know what is going on, I know it&#39;s magic, but why all the changes?&quot; asked Thomas.<br />
<br />
The old man reached out to Thomas, &quot;Your credit card sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon Thomas signed the receipt for $99 and the old man smiled and handed Thomas his copy and his credit card. The old man whispered quietly, &quot;In a word sir, you. You are the reason for the changes. I am prepared to alter the deal since you don&#39;t have $10,000.&quot; The old man ducked down behind the counter and when he stood up he was the young girl from the other reality holding a piece of paper. The young girl whispered, &quot;Your curious why you cannot remove your legsuit. That is because it is a living thing and has bonded to your body. You have let the suit make quite a home with your body, as it is as much a host for you as you are for it. If you were to bring me one of your offspring, another legsuit, then I would consider your $10,000 paid and the suit would be yours to keep and you would be able to race competitively for as long as you wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas leaned forward, &quot;Okay, so what is the catch?&quot;<br />
<br />
The young shop lady smiled, and whispered, &quot;Easy, you breed with the suit....or rather the suit breeds with you. I noticed your penis gone. If you allow it, the legsuit will grow a womb inside you.&quot; Thomas started to object, but the shop lady pointed at the wet spot between Thomas&#39;s legs, &quot;The suit is already working on that for you now, and the suit will not go against your will or desires. Remember, I am only asking for one, not your first born, just one. This is a new suit and the need to breed is strong with both of you. The more you want it, the faster the changes happen. Come, stand over by the mirror and see what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas stepped over to the change room door&#39;s full length mirror and the vacuum formed camel-toe was unmistakable. &quot;Puffy,&quot; Thomas said aloud.<br />
<br />
The shop lady said, &quot;The deal still stands, you are welcome to return the suit, but we have an amended agreement? Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas went over to the register to sign and date the addendum. Thomas felt a stirring inside him, as the suit started to work deeper into his just forming vaginal canal. Thomas looked up and asked, &quot;What is with eggplants and me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The shop lady said, &quot;The legsuit processes all of it for it&#39;s food, and it&#39;s waste product is essentially semen released into your intestines for your body to absorb and feed from. It&#39;s a super food that you can swallow into any of your two, soon to be three orifices. So are squash, cucumbers, oranges, apples, grapefruits, grapes, dates, peeled pineapples, and bananas to name a few. Your the fastest open water swimmer in this reality and races where your legsuit is considered a legal uniform. You will also find after a while, your legsuit can shorten to a jammer, speedo, or be pulled entirely inside your body...but you have to craw before you walk. The legsuit can also encase your entire body. It&#39;s part of you, a living thing now, and for as long as you want, provided you keep to the terms of our agreement.&quot; The shop lady smiled as you stepped back over to the mirror to slide your finger into your new opening, the signed addendum in your other hand.<br />
<br />
Thomas felt the fog return and clear once again. Thomas left, thanking the shop lady for her time and help. Thomas stopped by a produce store on the way home and picked up some more eggplant and romaine lettuce. Both of Thomas&#39;s parents where home when he pulled into the driveway. They were both eating at the table, when Thomas put the groceries he bought on the counter, then joined them at the table. Both of his parents were naked at the table as they ate. Thomas listened in silence as he ate, finishing just after his parents got up with their plates to put in the sink.<br />
<br />
Thomas&#39;s dad turned to Thomas, &quot;When do you want to leave for swim practice?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas put his plate in the sink, and grabbed two of the romaine lettuce heads and the olive oil, &quot;A couple of minutes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas&#39;s mom said, &quot;We will be in the car, just lock up behind you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas had to push and stretch a little for the first head of oiled lettuce to slide into his ass. The second head went in easily. His new vaginal opening throbbed, but not to be filled. The lettuce was expensive, and Thomas stopped at two even though he felt he could hold three. Thomas washed his hands and went into the garage where his mother just started the car. Thomas was lost in the anticipation of becoming pregnant with a new living legsuit.</p>
