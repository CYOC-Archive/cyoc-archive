<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was 6am. Someone was knocking on my door. “Wake up sleepyhead” It was Sarah. I stumbled out of bed and opened the door. “Just wanted to give you adequate warning. You are doing a Pilate&#39;s class with me at 7”<br />
<br />
“I was thinking of going on a run”<br />
<br />
“We can do that afterwards. Get dressed and have a light breakfast”<br />
<br />
“Do you need some clothes?” She was just in her nightie.<br />
<br />
“No I came prepared this time”<br />
<br />
“Umm excuse my ignorance but what should I wear?”<br />
<br />
“What you wore jogging last week would be fine. I’ll see you in the kitchen in 10”<br />
<br />
I went to the toilet and was happy to see my period was almost finished there were just a few spots on my pad. After washing my hands I removed the turban. A shake of my head and the curls tumbled down, looking reasonably neat. It was actually easier than brushing tangles out.<br />
<br />
The gear I had worn jogging with Sarah last weekend was still in the washing basket. I looked through the drawer where Jenna kept her sports gear to see what alternatives I had. I leafed through the contents. There were several one-piece swimsuits and a collection of bikini’s including a shiny gold set. It had a matching band about of gold material about 20 cm wide I didn’t know the purpose of. <br />
Underneath were some purple and black patterned knee length leggings with a matching sports bra. There were also some full length bright pink leggings and some full length floral leggings with lace trim. I chose to put on the purple and black outfit. I put on some white anklet socks and the pink runners I had worn jogging last time.<br />
<br />
Sarah was already in the kitchen eating a bowl of muesli. She was in a similar outfit to mine but in grey and had a singlet over her top.<br />
I made myself some muesli and while eating told of my swimsuit discovery. Sarah laughed and said she could remember me wearing that gold bikini while washing Mum’s car out in the front drive. I had chosen to do so while Tony next door was trimming his front hedge. She was amazed that he didn’t chop a hand off. She explained the gold band was actually a very short miniskirt I wore over the bikini bottoms.<br />
We finished breakfast and went to the bathroom together to clean our teeth. Sarah pulled out a spray can of antiperspirant deodorant and offered to spray me at the same time as she did herself. I agreed. It was only after it had been applied that I realized it was scented deodorant. I now smelt very floral.<br />
<br />
Sarah asked “Do you have your membership card?” I remembered the gym membership card in my handbag. So that is where we were going. I checked it was still present, then we departed, taking Sarah car.<br />
<br />
As we walked in Sarah said the class we were going to was one that she regularly attended. She said Jenna had never attended this particular class as it was too early in the day for me. She used try to avoid Jenna if possible. <br />
<br />
I mimicked Sarah as she showed her membership card at the front desk then walked down to one of the gyms. We put our bags down on some shelves and Sarah took off her shoes and socks. I did the same. She introduced me to a woman called Trudy who was the trainer. Sarah said I had done Pilate&#39;s before but not this particular class. Trudy said she could recall my face, probably from when she had filled in on and evening class. <br />
<br />
While we were waiting other women wandered in. A woman with short brown hair came over and started talking to Sarah. Sarah introduced her as Annabelle. Annabelle knew about the funeral and said she would see us there, wasn’t it tragic. She asked if we were coming to coffee after the class. Sarah said we would.<br />
 <br />
We moved across and found a mat each. I was beside Sarah in the rear corner. There were 11 women in total in the room. Once everyone was on a mat Trudy said “Let’s start. 50 seconds each exercise then 10 second change over. We will start with an exploding plank” She demonstrated the exercise once then her phone beeped “Start now” Everyone tried to mimic what she was doing, rocking backwards and forwards on arms and legs. I found it easy. After a minute Trudy moved to a new position and demonstrated the next exercise. We just had to copy her movements. She kept talking telling us what we needed to concentrate on with each exercise. This continued for about 25 minutes, changing every minute or so. <br />
<br />
Trudy then paused told us to get a drink and grab a ball. I copied Sarah took a drink from a water fountain and collected a large blue plastic ball from a shelf, returning to the mat. We did another 20 minutes of exercises with these balls. Finally Trudy said “That’s enough for the day, thank-you ladies I hoped you enjoyed the class” <br />
<br />
We put away the balls and I noticed some of the other woman were using towels to rub themselves dry. I had barely raised a sweat. I had found all the exercises simple and thought I had mimicked Trudy’s movements pretty well. Trudy approached me. “Jenna, you did very well. I hope it was challenging enough” She moved off.<br />
<br />
We put our shoes and socks back on and walked over to join Annabelle and another woman who was introduced as Alecia. Sarah explained that the 3 of them generally went and had a morning coffee after Pilate&#39;s at a little coffee shop about 200 metres from the gym. We walked down the street and into a plant nursery. Within the nursery was a small coffee shop where we ordered some drinks and sat down around a table in a very pleasant garden setting. <br />
<br />
Annabelle and Alecia asked Sarah all about her week and were very sympathetic towards Sarah, saying they couldn’t imagine how they could cope if something similar happened to them. Alecia eventually turned to me and asked how I knew Sarah. I explained I was Sarah’s sister. Alecia was a young mum trying to regain her body shape after giving birth 4 months ago. She was 25, the same age I would be in a week. Her young son was at home with his father. She, Sarah and Annabelle only knew each other from the Pilate&#39;s class and had buddied up as they were all about the same age.<br />
<br />
Our coffees arrived. They were very nice. Annabelle was having a tea and the waitress had forgotten to bring her some milk. She had to wait while the waitress returned to the kitchen. Alecia joked “If you had asked, I could have supplied the milk. Look I’m leaking again” Sure enough her top was wet around her nipples. <br />
<br />
I asked how she found breastfeeding. “I love it. They get so full and you crave for them to be emptied. But I’ve been warned that once Zach starts teething it could hurt.” I glanced at Sarah. She had caught the babies name and gave me a wry smile. Alecia continued. ”Actually I really love it when Paul has a suck. It’s so erotic” The other girls giggled, I gather Paul must be her husband. I’m sure I must have blushed. <br />
Sarah took the opportunity to stir me further “Well sister, that’s something we will have to look forward to”<br />
<br />
Annabelle was single and worked as a receptionist at an Optometry practice. When she found out where I worked she chatted about some of the weird phone calls she sometimes got. A lot of her patients were older and often had memory problems. Eventually we finished our drinks and departed. Alecia needed to get home to give Zach a feed. Annabelle said she would see us both tomorrow. <br />
<br />
Once back home Sarah asked whether I still wanted to go for a run. I said yes but wanted to put a load of washing on first. Mum said she had done her washing yesterday and the machine was all mine. I took my basket down and got a coloured wash happening. Sarah was in the bathroom putting some sunscreen on her face and shoulders. She suggested I do the same. <br />
<br />
She then showed me some shampoo and conditioner that I should use when it came to washing my hair. I needed to follow the directions properly or risk the curls not holding. She also told me how to use a wide tooth comb to remove any tangles and suggested I put away brushes until the perm runs out. She also said to use a diffuser when drying my hair. When I looked puzzled she found a plastic attachment and showed me how it fitted on the dryer. She said to use it always, so heat didn&#39;t damage my curls. <br />
<br />
5 minutes later we set out on our run. We decided to copy the run from last weekend to the playground by the creek. I asked if we could slow the pace slightly to see if I could last better. The slower pace worked. I was very tired by the end of the run but I never had to walk. I had managed to complete the 10km. As we got back towards the house we met Dad who had decided to take Biddy for a walk.<br />
<br />
Once back home Sarah had a shower while I put my washing on the line. I was sitting with Mum showing her the hat with the mauve ribbon on it when Sarah came down in a yellow sundress. She said she would head home once Dad and Biddy were back. Mum arranged to visit her on Monday morning and take her to the funeral. I said goodbye to Sarah and went and had a shower myself, remembering not to wet my hair.<br />
<br />
I put on jeans and a blue floral t shirt. I also remembered it was time to start my contraceptives again. so swallowed a pill.<br />
<br />
I still had a pile of white washing in the laundry so set another load in motion. I went to the kitchen and could see Mum chatting with Linda over the fence. I decided to make myself a cup of tea. I was just sitting down when Mum came in the back door. “Jenna I was just talking to Linda. They have a dinner party tonight and her babysitter has just cancelled due to some illness. I said I would ask if you might be able to mind Chrissie for a few hours. She said they could be home by 10, You usually don’t go out till then. Could you?” <br />
<br />
“Umm, I suppose so. What time would she need me?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure. They are out in the yard gardening. Why don’t you ask?”<br />
<br />
I took my tea and wandered down to near the clothesline.<br />
<br />
“Mummy, there’s Jenna” I could hear Chrissie say. 5 seconds later she was climbing on the fence grinning at me. She was covered in dirt “We are planting flowers”<br />
<br />
“That’s very clever of you. What sort of flowers?”<br />
<br />
“Pink ones and blue ones”<br />
<br />
“Hi Jenna” said Linda “Has Eileen spoken to you?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, she said you needed a babysitter tonight” <br />
<br />
“Yes we are going to a dinner party. I had Maddy Brown lined up but she is in bed with some sort of bug”<br />
<br />
“I can do it. What time would you need me?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe about 6 pm. We would be back before 10”<br />
<br />
“Ok I’ll come around at 6”<br />
<br />
“Thanks so much Jenna. If you are happy I can have a Pizza in the oven that you and Chrissie can share”<br />
<br />
“Yippee!” Yelled Chrissie. “You’re my favourite babysitter and pizza is my favourite dinner”<br />
<br />
“See you later”<br />
<br />
I went back inside and told Mum of the arrangements for this evening.<br />
<br />
“We will be heading out for dinner ourselves tonight. Over to the Mcguane’s…… I think your washing is ready. The machine just beeped”<br />
I took the load out and hung it on the line. I could see Chrissie making mud pies in the garden.</p>
