<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What are you talking about Megan?&quot; Steve whispered.<br />
<br />
Inside, the self conscience Steve was wondering if he was really that bad at passing for a woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember how you taught me how to read auras six months ago? I can see that something is clearly wrong with <br />
you. Now what is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
What the heck was Megan talking about? Auras?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I...um...uh...well, I'm not quite myself today. I...lost my perspective on things...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm hmm?&quot; mumbled Megan, arms still crossed. &quot;What perspective?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve was floundered. If he told her the truth, he would look like a crazy woman, but if he didn't, he would <br />
be trapped this way.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...Megan, you said something about auras. What were you talking about?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Auras, duh. Y'know what they are, it's like background magic where you can tell if someone is happy or sad, <br />
or possessed by something. It shows a whole bunch of stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey...are you a witch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohmigod, you really don't remember, do you?&quot; Megan's eyes went wide.<br />
<br />
Steve breathed in deeply, thinking Well here goes nothing...<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, are you OK in there?&quot; asked Janet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine mom!&quot; shouted Megan. &quot;It's OK, you can go ahead. You were about to say something.&quot; said Megan again, her <br />
voice back to a whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I'm not really your aunt. I'm actually your dad. Not the guy who just left, but your real dad. I was <br />
enjoying some rest and relaxation outside, and I was about to go fishing with Carl next door. Your mom got <br />
upset, so did Wendy, and a few seconds later, I ended up in this body, and Carl ended up in a woman's body <br />
too. I know it sounds crazy, but it happened like ten minutes ago. I swear it. If magic really exists, and you <br />
can do anything about it, please help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK&quot; said Megan nonchalantly. &quot;This is way over my head. If you really don't know who you are, here's a <br />
refresher. You're my aunt, and yes, I know some magic. You teach me a little more about it every time I have a <br />
sleepover at yours and Uncle Gene's house, which is like once every three or four weeks. Love spells, auras, <br />
and all that stuff. You don't teach me the really dark stuff, but you're into that too. I don't know why you <br />
think you're my dad, but I think I remember you saying that you were working on a spell that would give me and <br />
Alan a better dad and my mom a better husband. It's not like dad is mean or hits us or something, it's just, I <br />
guess my mom and dad don't love each other any more. You said you might have had a way to fix that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God&quot; moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;And who's Carl? Don't you mean Carly, Brooke's aunt?&quot;<br />
<br />
Later that day, Gene told Janet that he and Stephanie were heading home. Steve gave one last goodbye to Megan, <br />
as well as to Alan, who had been away all day at a baseball game. Of course, one could imagine this as being <br />
one of the worst day's ever for Steve: not only did he not get to go fishing with Carl, his kids weren't <br />
really his in this reality, his wife was married to some idiot, and worst of all, he was now a strange woman <br />
going home with, eek, a man who said said he was her husband. On the way home, Gene made some small talk about <br />
what they wanted to do, where they wanted to go next weekend, etc. Steve played it by ear and tried to give <br />
vague, appealing answers just to shut the guy up. Yeah, he was nice and all, but Steve Donaldson isn't going <br />
to be a woman for much longer if he could say anything about it.<br />
<br />
When the couple reached their home, which was out in the country(and FYI for you frequent readers and trivia <br />
buffs, their home was within walking distance of the so-called &quot;House Of Doom&quot;), Steve immediately searched <br />
around for any arcane stuff or spell books that might help him. He didn't know diddly-squat about magic, he <br />
didn't even really believe in it until today, but if this Stephanie was teaching Megan how to be a witch, <br />
maybe he could pick it up quicker in her body.<br />
<br />
The den looked more like a library than anything else. At least ten bookcases filled the room from top to <br />
bottom, some cases stacked right on top of the other. At least three of these bookcases were reserved for <br />
Stephanie's magic books. Steve looked through them, some of them incredibly old and withered, others the <br />
umpteenth &quot;Updated&quot; edition of older books, and so on. In one bookcase, there was a sheaf of papers sticking <br />
out obviously. Pulling on them, Steve read the front page:<br />
<br />
&quot;If your name is Steve Donaldson and are currently trapped in the body of Janet Donaldson's sister Stephanie, <br />
I regret to inform you that you are not real. You are an illusion granted temporary sapience by myself, <br />
Stephanie Seaton-Crowley. I designed you and your parallel reality so that my sister could live with a loving, <br />
caring husband for a while, something that I myself enjoy so much. As you might have guessed, her and her <br />
husband's relationship isn't doing so well. Your &quot;time limit&quot; expired the moment that Janet had a quantifiable <br />
amount of anger towards you. In other words, if you had done something recently to her to make her very angry, <br />
that is what caused you to regress back into me. This is not a body swap. I repeat: you are not real. You are <br />
just a figment of everyone's imagination. You will soon turn back into me. Please refer to the spell at the <br />
bottom to delay your eventual termination so you can set whatever affairs you feel you need to deal with in <br />
order. I am sorry Steve.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S It looks like I screwed up and made the spell's radius too large. If your name is Carl Matson and you are <br />
currently in the body of a woman named Carly, please refer to the reversal spell below. You were not meant to <br />
be changed. Sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
{Reversal Spell}<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The other pages covered how the time, place and process of the spell that brought Steve into being, and some <br />
theoretical stuff about the nature of reality.<br />
<br />
What next?</p>
