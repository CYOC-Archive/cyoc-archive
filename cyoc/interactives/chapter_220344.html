<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joan had fun singing and dancing.  Any reservations he might have had about going out in public and becoming the center of attention for a song at karaoke were now gone.  Granted, the Long Island iced tea might have helped, but he was feeling really good.  &quot;Yeah, let&#39;s stick around a bit longer.  We should pick a song quick so we can get back in the queue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie flipped through the notebook looking at songs.  &quot;Want to try a duet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan sipped his drink which was almost gone.  &quot;Sure.  Got any ideas?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie continued flipping.  &quot;I don&#39;t think we can do our usual &#39;Love Shack&#39; duet.  Hmmm...&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan leaned in and helped look for a song.  &quot;Oooh!  How about this?&quot;  His French manicured finger landed on Cyndi Lauper&#39;s &quot;Girls Just Want To Have Fun&quot;.  &quot;It&#39;s a fun classic 80&#39;s song that I&#39;ve never been able to sing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a duet though,&quot; Katie pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can trade off!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, you seem to be really into it and this is your first night to &#39;have fun&#39; as a girl, so sure.&quot;  Katie wrote down the song information and their names.  She ran it up to the DJ and hurried back to her seat.<br />
<br />
Joan had a huge smile on his face.  &quot;Yay!&quot;  He drank the last of his drink and put the sweaty class down on the coaster.  &quot;Uh oh.  I need to pee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay.  I&#39;ll go with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan got up and started toward the restroom.<br />
<br />
Katie put her hand on Joan&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;Hold on a second.  Take your purse.&quot;  As Joan walked back to take his purse, Katie leaned over and got Danny&#39;s attention.  He wasn&#39;t far away and walked over.  &quot;Hey Danny, can you watch our drinks for a moment.  We&#39;ll be right back.  Going to the restroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny saluted Katie with two fingers.  &quot;No problem.  Gotcha covered.&quot;  He put a coaster on top of their unfinished drinks and took away Joan&#39;s empty glass.<br />
<br />
Katie grabbed her purse and the two walked along the bar to the ladies restroom in the back.  The restroom had two stalls with one of them being a larger accessible stall in the back marked by a typical blue wheelchair icon on a small sign.  To Joan&#39;s relief, there was nobody else in the restroom...at the moment.<br />
<br />
Katie reassured Joan.  &quot;I&#39;ll be right out here if you have any questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; replied Joan.  He went into the regular stall and hung his purse on the hook on the back of the stall door.  He looked down at his legs.  &quot;Should I hike the skirt up or unzip and pull it down?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie stood at the sink looking into the mirror and adjusted her hair.  &quot;Sometimes if I&#39;m wearing a loose skirt like I am now and no hose or tights, I&#39;ll pull it up so it doesn&#39;t touch the floor.  If it&#39;s tight, I&#39;ll pull it down.  With what you&#39;re wearing, it could go either way.  It&#39;s short enough, I&#39;d probably go up...but you&#39;re also wearing pantyhose and have to go down with those anyway.  Also, I guess since you&#39;re used to going down, stick with that so you don&#39;t have to hold it up.  Make sure it doesn&#39;t fall on the floor or into the toilet.  That&#39;s the most important part.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan wiped the toilet seat with paper to make sure it wasn&#39;t wet and was reasonably clean.  He then unzipped the skirt and pulled it down to his knees along with the pantyhose and panties.  He looked down at his crotch.  It was strange for him to see his body from this angle and not have his penis sticking out from his pubic hair.  He felt his crotch and was tempted to explore his body, but knew there would be time for that later.  Right now he really had to pee.<br />
<br />
He sat down.  He was used to using his right hand to point his penis down into the toilet bowl, but was at a loss for what to do with his hand now.  He placed it on his lap and leaned forward a bit and waited.<br />
<br />
Katie was curious when she heard silence.  &quot;How&#39;s it going in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really need to pee, but, uh...  I&#39;m not doing it.&quot;  Joan didn&#39;t know how to describe it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just relax.  Pretend I&#39;m not here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure that helps,&quot; Joan admitted.  A moment passed.  He sighed.  As he relaxed, a little pee came out.  It immediately stopped as it surprised him with a new and unfamiliar sensation.  &quot;Oh!&quot;  He tried relaxing again and a steady stream exited his body.  He grinned with relief.<br />
<br />
When Katie heard the pee stop, she helpfully offered some advice.  &quot;Don&#39;t forget to wipe so you don&#39;t drip or get infected.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan replied from behind the door.  &quot;Yep!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Joan finished up, someone else entered the bathroom.  It was a short, slightly overweight woman with curly red hair.  Katie recognized her as the woman who sang Lady Gaga.  &quot;Hi,&quot; Katie greeted her.  &quot;Good job with &#39;Bad Romance&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she replied.  &quot;You were great too.&quot;  She looked into the mirror and adjusted her mascara.<br />
<br />
Inside Joan&#39;s stall, the toilet flushed. Joan emerged and went to the sink to wash his hands.<br />
<br />
The redhead greeted Joan.  &quot;Hi!  I loved your rendition of &#39;I Feel Like a Woman!&#39;  Such a fun song.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot;  Looking into the mirror, it was strange for Joan see a different person reflected in the mirror.  When he finished washing and drying his hands, Katie handed him some lipstick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here. Why don&#39;t you touch up your lips?&quot; Katie suggested.<br />
<br />
Joan eyed the redhead just beyond Katie and took the lipstick.  &quot;Okay, thanks.&quot;  Looking closely, he could see that some had worn off while he was drinking.  He applied the lipstick as if it was lip balm on a cold winter day and pressed his lips together before making a kissing face and admiring his own look.  He didn&#39;t notice Katie watching and grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve seen you in here before,&quot; the redhead commented toward Katie.  &quot;Aren&#39;t you usually with a guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked at the redhead&#39;s reflection in the mirror.  &quot;Yeah.  That&#39;s my boyfriend, John, but I&#39;m here with my friend Joan tonight while she&#39;s visiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Joan,&quot; the redhead said as she waved.  &quot;I&#39;m Sandy.  You from around here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah.  Kind of.  I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie laughed nervously.  &quot;She&#39;s in the process of moving...so it&#39;s complicated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan put his hand inside Katie&#39;s arm.  &quot;Can we go back now?&quot;  He wanted to get out of there and was not in the mood for a conversation.  It was a bathroom, not a social club.<br />
<br />
Katie looked down at Joan&#39;s hand and up at his face.  &quot;Sure.  See you out there, Sandy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sandy looked at her own reflection as Katie and Joan walked out.  &quot;Break a leg!&quot;<br />
<br />
Back at their seats, Joan chuckled to himself.  &quot;Do women always talk so much in the bathroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked confused.  &quot;Huh?  We hardly talked to her at all!  You were in such a rush to get out of there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys will go in, do their business, and leave.  Absolutely no talking.  It&#39;s an unspoken law.  The most you could do is grunt a &#39;hey&#39; at someone you know when you accidentally make eye contact at the sink, but we try not to look at anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie&#39;s eyes opened wide.  &quot;Wow!  That doesn&#39;t sound like fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a bathroom.  Who said it&#39;s supposed to be fun?&quot;  Joan shook his head in disbelief.<br />
<br />
They continued enjoying their drinks while discussing bathroom etiquette, the &quot;pink tax&quot; on items &quot;designed for women&quot;, and other gender differences in society.  Before they knew it, the DJ called their names.  They each took one last swig before waving to Danny.  He nodded as acknowledgement that he&#39;d watch their drinks again.<br />
<br />
The bar clapped as they took the microphones.  They both had quite a buzz going and Joan was definitely well past the point of being able to drive.  A little more and he might have trouble walking.  The bar cheered again as the music started and people recognized &quot;Girls Just Want To Have Fun&quot;.  Katie started singing first and Joan took a turn for the next verse.  They alternated back and forth with whomever wasn&#39;t singing filling the role of a backup dancer.  As they got near the end of the song, Joan sang the lyrics as Katie took the backup vocals.  When the song ended, the crowd applauded and cheered.  They smiled and waved as they went back to their seats.<br />
<br />
As they sat down, Danny came over.  &quot;A couple more drinks for you two courtesy of a couple of hopeful admirers.&quot;  He nodded toward a couple guys at a high-top table between the bar and the dining area before sliding over another Midori sour and Long Island iced tea.<br />
<br />
Katie and Joan looked at the drinks then over at the guys who waved back.  They each gave a polite wave and smile.  Joan leaned toward Katie.  &quot;<i>More</i> free drinks?  Is this typical?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded.  &quot;It could be.  If we were dressed in some sexy dresses, we&#39;d probably be getting a lot more attention...and more drinks than we could handle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan shook his head in disbelief.  &quot;Wow...&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie eyed Joan&#39;s drink.  &quot;You don&#39;t have to drink that, you know.  Remember, you&#39;re a lightweight now, but that doesn&#39;t mean I can carry you out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan reached over to Katie and rested his hand on hers.  &quot;I&#39;m good.  I&#39;m feeling <i>real</i> good!&quot;  He leaned in and kissed her.</p>
