<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eileen removed her feet from Ty’s hands, “hey come on we can talk more in the kitchen,” she had stated as she tightened her robe. Ty smiled as he stood up “yeah you’re right I was starting to get a bit hungry,” he offered his hand to the young Jill who still was on the couch. She timidly took his hand it seemed as though as a teen she was a lot more timid still learning about the world much less about boys. Jill stood up with her robe practically falling off.  she blushed and fell to her knees “sorry you can go without me I’ll just be a minute” Ty understood she was still shy around boys having not broken out of her shy habits quite yet at this age. “It’s ok I have my eyes covered so you can take as long as you’d like” he said honoring his word by covering his hands over his eyes. Jill blushed though Ty could not see it she had felt a sense of calm around the boy who she had grown a crush on since they were in middle school. Jill had stood up and tightened her clothing around her body she breathed a sigh of relief “Thank you Ty, I… I really appreciate it” she said, Ty then removed his hands from his eyes and smiled, Jill smiled back. “Guys Cmon I didn’t spend that much time cooking for the food to be cold” Eileen yelled from the kitchen in annoyance. <br />
<br />
As the trio sat at the table eating their breakfast Ty spoke up “you always make the best breakfast Eileen” he says with his mouth semi full as he shoves another bite in, Jill nodded in agreement keeping her manners. “Well of course I do, my parents are always off at work before I wake up and since Becca has been going to high school in the early morning I have to do things myself” she said with a smile as if she always enjoyed being independent as this trait would carry on into her adulthood. Eileen took a sip of juice and glanced at Jill who while eating would stare slightly at Ty as she ate. Eileen hit her leg with her foot lightly as if to get her attention without letting Ty see, Jill looked to her she could see Eileen was moving her head slightly to Ty as if to say “now’s your chance.” Jill blushed and swallowed her food “uh Ty” Jill stated her voice shaky as if she has her whole life depended on this question. Ty looked from his plate and swallowed “yeah?” Jill looked at Eileen as if to say “help me out please” Eileen laughed “she wants to know about your powers and what you could do with them” Eileen said knowing that’s not what Jill had meant but is glad for the diversion away from her and her real question. Ty thought about everything that he has done with his power including what he did to Eileen and Jill who both seem to be ok with the way things are right now. “I guess I can really do anything like there’s not really a limit to what my power can do.” He stated thinking back to when he shifted reality to make this world possible with two full grown adult women now sitting at a table as young teens in their freshmen year. “That’s amazing and you only got these powers on your birthday” Eileen exclaimed knowing this since they’ve been friends since they were younger. “You think you could use them on us?” Eileen asked Ty as if somewhere in her mind she knew what kind of fun this could lead. “Like me” Jill said adding to the conversation. “Do you think you could use them on me?” She asked again, Eileen smiled happy that her friend would be so outgoing “yeah I could do that what would you want to have happen?” He has asked her “I was wondering if maybe you could…yknow…” she started but was too shy about the idea to continue “…make me older?” She had asked sounding scared of what he might think. Ty thought about this and smiled “of course if that’s what you would want I can always change you back” he stated “if she gets to be older I want to be older too!” Eileen exclaimed Ty laughed at how excited she was “how about we all become older? Like we can all age up 5 years just to see what we would be like” Ty said to the group. Jill blushed even harder and nodded in agreement “yeah that would be fun, I wonder what Becca’s going to say when she sees how much older I am than her” Eileen started to giggle at the thought of being older than her older sister. <br />
<br />
The trio made it to the living room standing side by side “are you guys ready?” Ty said to the girls as they all stood side by side holding hands he concentrated on the group aging them up 5 years each he kept thinking of them growing up, however his thought process was broken when he heard the door open “Becca” Eileen said surprised “she’s not supposed to be home until tomorrow night! What’s she going to do when she sees you here” Jill looked scared of getting into trouble and quickly hid behind the couch as to not be seen by Eileen’s older sister. “I knew this was a bad idea Eileen” she said slightly freaking out. Ty’s concentration on the group was broken as he heard Becca’s voice call from a few feet away “Eileen I’m home!” Ty had to think quick the moment he saw Becca “hey Ty what are you doing here” just then she stopped a slight moan escaped the 17 year olds lips as she pressed her back against the wall “oh… ohhhhh it feels so hot” she said her eyes closed her hands against the wall Ty had realized what he had done. “Ty what’s going on with her why is she doing that” Eileen said to Ty who was already cursing at himself “I think I might’ve made her 5 years older” he said to Eileen who looked back at her sister “5 years that’s not so bad.” She stated to Ty. Ty shook his head “no 5 years each one that was meant for each of us.” Eileen now understood why Ty was worried Becca was growing 5 years old she was growing 15 years older. <br />
<br />
Becca’s body was pressed against the wall as she moaned in ecstasy “oh yesssss, fuck yessss” her body at the moment was growing ever so slightly. Becca was the spitting image of her mother with a cute face, long legs, shapely ass, wonderful curves that any woman her age would be jealous of even some older women would be jealous of such a body as Becca’s, not to mention her breast which were already a good D cup at her age covered modestly by her sweater. She was now becoming a full grown woman her body grew from the age of 17 to the age of 21 already in a few Moments her clothes tearing slightly to the new body they were on but Becca couldn’t focus on that now she was focused on the insane pleasure she was feeling in her body. “Fuuuuuck” she said her voice growing from a cute polite girl to that of a sexy seductive voice as it deepened slightly. Her body was still aging as her pants had been ripped to shreds as her thighs and hips were too much for her jeans. Her sweater wasn’t safe from the transformation either as he beautiful body was starting to peak through the seems of her yellow sweater ripping and tearing away to make room for her now growing bust and arms. “She’s already hit 28 years old” Ty said to the girls who were watching all of Becca’s transformation take place “she is going to be half naked when this is over” Eileen said watching her sister grow more mature or was it her mother she was watching she couldn’t quite remember. Becca turned around her breast now rubbed against the wall as her ass hung out for everyone to see the nice shape it had become. Not soon after her hair would grow slightly longer reaching the lower part of her back, her bra straps exploded off her body as her massive breast were no longer able to be contained. She was now a 32 year old woman full grown and on full display, however something was different. “Becca are you alright?” Ty had asked the now adult Becca as she sat on the floor as she panted her pleasures away “I think I’m ok” she said her voice had amazingly gotten even sexier and seductive then it was a few years ago almost sounding like her own mother who was now her own daughter. Eileen came up next to Becca “mom are you sure you’re ok” she said noticing the tattered clothing and the sweat on her now mothers body “Eileen I told you no boys in the house” she said faintly before passing out from the sheer transformation and pleasure. “She’s ok she’s just been through a lot” he says to Eileen who looks relived to see her mother wasn’t in any real danger she actually felt a sense of calm as if she knew in Ty’s hands she would be the safest person in the world. Jill stepped out and saw Becca in full view as she laid on the floor “Eileen is this… Becca?” Jill asked Eileen who nodded “yeah, but for some reason I feel like she’s my mother rather than my sister now” Eileen said to Jill. “Reality has switched again which means she had you at the age of 16 and you are now her daughter” Ty had stated to the young teenager “wait so you’re saying soon I’m going to think of her as my mom” Eileen said kinda excited by the idea as she would’ve been if she were still an adult some things never change Ty thought and smiled.<br />
<br />
After a while I’d getting Becca to bed Ty came Down the stairs only to be greeted with Eileen and Jill standing there “Ty this has Been a really creative day but I feel like I need to ask this” Jill said to Ty “We aren’t your age are we?” Jill asked Ty. Eileen looked at Ty with some hint disappointment but not for him but the answer he would say “yes you both aren’t my age, you both are 48 year old women who I wanted to hang out with.” Ty stated with full honesty as he knew lying would only push them away. Eileen looked sad almost as if she knew this was true but didn’t want to except it “my sweet little Ty” she stated “you’re always a good boy and you always look after us no matter what the case may be, I’m not mad or upset with you I just wish that this,” she waved to the home and the pictures of their friendship with each other “were real” Eileen stated to Ty who sighed “sadly it’s not, you two have memories of growing up with me and us being a fun playful trio until we got to high school but that was never the truth, you both have lives and you both loved them without me” he said to the girls. Jill was still silent after hearing this Eileen hugged Ty and gave him a small kiss on the lips. Jill spoke “my feelings may have been fake but I know what I want now” she said reaching for Tys hand. “I want to spend my life with you and Eileen as a trio like we did or should I say like we thought we did” she said building the courage to give Ty a kiss on the cheek. “But what about your old lives” Ty said to Jill and Eileen wanting a future where they could grow up together. “We can still go back if we want to or even if you decide that’s best” Eileen said to Ty and Jill as she grabs his other hand “we could stay young and grow up together, or we could go back to the way things were” Eileen said leaning her head on his shoulder and Jill doing the same to the other <br />
<br />
“We will let you make the decision Ty” Jill said finally feeling at peace.</p>
