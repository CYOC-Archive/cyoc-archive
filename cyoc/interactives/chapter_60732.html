<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next few days were fairly quiet. The two ranchers at in their cell, and I hoped they were thinking about what they had done and understood they were wrong, but I doubted it. Officer Howard contacted the Animal Control officers to inform them that we already had them on criminal charges to see about combining the civil case for the custody of the animals seized with the criminal case. From what Officer Barnes and I were told later, the were &quot;OK&quot; with combining the two cases.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do now?&quot; I wondered, &quot;Call one of the judges or call the DA?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ordinarily we'd call in the DA to prosecute,&quot; Officer Howard sighed, &quot;However, he's already volunteered his services for the defense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That Regus character is from the DA's office?&quot; I gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;He isn't the DA, but he does work for the DA,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;He handles the work around Columbia Falls to the northern county line for the DA. Usually in gathering evidence for him and such. But since it appears that Beauregard has hired him, the DA's office is out of this case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could we go down to Kalispell ourselves?&quot; Officer Barnes wondered, &quot;Pass Regus altogether and talk with the DA.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Personally, you two probably could, but Regus has already taken the defendant's case,&quot; Officer Howard said with a sigh, &quot;which means the DA's office has taken the defendant's case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A DA's job is to prosecute criminals, not defend them,&quot; I grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I agree,&quot; Officer Howard nodded, &quot;but he's an attorney all the same. His chief concern is usually money. This mess will cost the DA's Office dearly when they learn about the stunt that has been pulled in this case, which will thorough piss a lot of people off, because the current DA has done a very good job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Jason Regus messes it up because Beauregard calls him,&quot; I grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Regus has done a good job as an employee of the DA,&quot; Officer Howard replied, &quot;but his case is different. He and the current DA ran head to head in the last county elections and he lost. The DA has proved to be a very gracious man and offered Regus a post as a researcher for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet Regus resents working for the guy he wanted to beat,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;That may be it, and may be why he took the case,&quot; Officer Howard sighed, &quot;which means WE will have to do the legal work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should be fairly simple,&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;We have good evidence. Animal Control has good evidence and the Game Wardens have good evidence. All they have are excuses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but we'll still need someone who knows the procedures that go with law cases,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;but figuring out that headache will be my job. You two have done more then enough in regards to this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So when will the case be?&quot; Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;First hearings is in week,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;and that will be to assign bail and formally make the charges. And since the worst charge that will stick is falsely accusing an officer, we can't speed it up any.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes and I only nodded.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
I returned home later that evening to find Molly already working on dinner and in a perky mood. And that made me happy... that she was happy anyway. I had found that I wasn't to terribly concerned about raw meat, which was probably a given, since that was one of the problems Molly had trouble adjusting to. And I wasn't going to ever tell Molly she couldn't work or that she couldn't do what she wanted... with reason of course. I loved her and wanted her to be happy. Having her happy made happy, and that was the most important thing in my life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything smells good,&quot; I commented as I came into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything smells good to you,&quot; Molly teased, but moved for a brief hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially you,&quot; I teased and hugged her back, lifting her up a little, though it couldn't be that much, because of our height. &quot;And it does me good to see you happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly nuzzled me, &quot;I know. You've been so good to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and set Molly down.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did your day go?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;about the same as always. Most of what I end having to do is keep them focused on Mrs. Fitzpatrick's lessons. The kids' favorite activity is still playing with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They have hurt you, have they?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;and while being petted only reminds me of what I am... they're only kids. If they grow up to treat me as a person, I'll endure it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her pause was somewhat awkward, and I didn't say anything to let her complete her thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;And part of me wants it,&quot; Molly answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kids climbing on you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cubs,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;our own children. To love and cherish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We agreed that that would wait until we've settled down into Bandhavgarh more,&quot; I told her, &quot;and you've gone out of heat for the time being.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Molly nodded, &quot;and I will wait... but being around those kids... it brings forth the desire. But I'll wait. And I can wait... and it'll make the day we become parents all the happier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just remember that when you're roaring at me for getting you pregnant,&quot; I joked and hustled out to get changed. And I heard her give a call back as I went up the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get you for that one!&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
I changed and returned downstairs to offer my help with whatever Molly was presently working on cooking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got it, George,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;Really.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're sure?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;in fact we're at a point were we can wait a little while. Let me set the timer and we can talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll wait in the living room then,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
Molly was right behind me. We sat down on the couch that we had, which appeared to be stronger then I thought, but so long as it stood, I wasn't going to complain.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did your day go?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty quiet today,&quot; I told her, &quot;we're still waiting for the court to begin the hearing with those two ranchers...&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly gave a really heavy sigh. I had told her what I could about the case, and she obviously didn't like that people would do this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wish people would accept us,&quot; Molly sighed, &quot;I have no desire to hurt anyone... and the only person I could have harmed was you when we first...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Water under the bridge, Molly,&quot; I told her, &quot;so long as I have you by my side, I don't care what I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly nodded, &quot;but these people are not so caring. The Choirs are good friends, and you've been telling me that you're getting along well with Officer Howard and Officer Barnes... but a good many aren't as fair and caring as they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
A lot of the situation we were in worried me a lot, but I was still determined to be successful. If only to spite Beauregard's hatred. And right now, voicing those worries would only make Molly feel worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll be together for a long time,&quot; I told her, &quot;and we'll show them that we are the bigger people... and not just in weight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;George,&quot; Molly gave a soft chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will survive,&quot; I told her, &quot;and we have a free weekend coming. No school, no shift. Just some quality time for the two of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly nuzzled me slightly, &quot;Yeah, but even that will be busy. We need to work out the photographs to make the order for our hunting gear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I sighed, &quot;I'm not sure how to do that. The tailor will need our stripe patterns, but we'd need to be nude to get it. I had thought on sketching it... but I don't think I'd get it done accurately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We may just have to bite the bullet and censor off the inappropriate parts,&quot; Molly sighed, &quot;the stripes on my chest don't come to my nipples, and on a shirt, that part probably wouldn't matter... and they'd only need a profile of our stripe pattern. Not a front on shot. I could hold up a board and cover up the... unmentionables.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can go topless all the time,&quot; Molly teased, &quot;I'd even prefer it. But you can use the board to cover up your unmentionables.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That tailor is going to go nuts, getting pictures of naked tiger people,&quot; I sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luckily I still got that digital camera,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;we can take the pictures and develop them here. We don't need to spread them around... or run the risk of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
We ended up dismantling the shelves in the little utility closet to get the boards needed for the photos, but that still did not remove the nervousness that I had on the issue. While I fumbled with the camera, which Molly had had for years, Molly held one board to block the camera from catching an image of her nipples. We only took pictures from the side, but Molly did hold the other board at a height to make absolutely sure no one saw her genitalia.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you like what you see?&quot; Molly quipped, which only added to my own embarrassment.<br />
<br />
I DID like what I saw, and my fully erect member easily betrayed that.<br />
<br />
&quot;This would be a lot easier if the buttons weren't so small,&quot; I mumbled trying to stay focused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Use a pen,&quot; Molly urged.<br />
<br />
Having no other solution, I went with it. Taking a ballpoint pen from our desk, I used the back end of the pen to press the button to take the picture. It finally worked for us.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what do I do?&quot; I mumbled in a low voice, hopping Molly wouldn't hear, but I knew she would.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me check,&quot; Molly set the boards on bed and came over. Once she had looked at the camera she gave the last of her response, &quot;You did well... you cut off my feet, but my stripes don't go down that far.&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave a visible sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, your turn,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;you'll probably need both boards.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fully erect penis between my legs only made me feel more embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don't look so glum,&quot; Molly teased, &quot;we can play with that later.&quot;<br />
<br />
I collected both boards and my best to make sure that they blocked the camera's view of my member. Molly tried her best to help from her point of view.<br />
<br />
&quot;Up a little... too much, go down a millimeter... there. Perfect. Hold still.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then repeated the same method I had used to take the picture and committed both photos to memory. While she did that, I set the boards down and began looking for my shorts. When I found them, Molly had finished her work with the camera and had come up behind me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you going to print them out?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Later,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;Right now... both of us have other things on our mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
I glanced at Molly and saw her nipples erect and poking through the white fur on her chest, and I caught a faint scent of arousal on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've only just gotten married,&quot; Molly spoke as she approached, &quot;shouldn't we get the chance to act like newlyweds?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her advance had pushed me back into sitting on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no idea how much,&quot; Molly spoke as she positioned herself in my lap and lowered herself onto my member.<br />
<br />
&quot;The barbs may hurt you,&quot; I said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;All... part... of... being... a... cat,&quot; Molly gave a slow moan as she began to thrust her hips forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tiger,&quot; I corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.&quot;</p>
