<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Three members of the Pack were now together with most of the Pride. The two largest <br />
masses of Turns for the Game brought together for the first time in a long time. And of <br />
course the turns held by the gallery statues who had been together for a long time, some <br />
for centuries, were now with both the pack and pride. Like like a network cable for two <br />
computer systems, the two masses of Turns for the Game connected, and in that moment, <br />
the curse KNEW! <br />
<br />
It was aware! It felt! It knew! All across the board it KNEW! All together. Serenity. Gill. <br />
Trevor. The Pack. The Pride. The gargoyles. The deer. The Shadows. All together. The <br />
number was now at over a hundred of course victims or those who held a turn!! At this <br />
number. It was fully aware of itself. It fully knew itself. Golgatha, Gomorrah, and Gaal. The <br />
three witches of anarchy and havoc who had been executed and spat their curse on <br />
Glendale with their dying breaths. Was the curse itself the combined spirits of Golgatha, <br />
Gomorrah, and Gaal? Or did Golgatha, Gomorrah, and Gaal only transfer their knowledge <br />
and intent into the curse? Even the curse didn't know, it didn't care. <br />
<br />
And with becoming aware, it felt it, emotion, full and complete, and it knew -fear-! It was <br />
massive enough to feel the senses the ideas of it's victims now. And now it felt what <br />
Serenity was intending with the turn that stayed with her unable to use it: and it knew, that <br />
she now had the instrument and the intent, to destroy it utterly and completely! After the <br />
turns within the pack and pride were exterminated, she would move onto putting he <br />
dreadful concoction in the city's drinking water! And have the priests bless the whole town <br />
to completely and utterly eradicate it! <br />
<br />
Normally these schemes to end the curse once and for all amused it, because they would <br />
fail! Like when the police the week of the Stock Market Crash had everyone with a turn use <br />
the game outside of Glendale where it was worthless. Oooh how the game had made sure <br />
the entire world suffered for that one, for DARING to hope. <br />
<br />
But... BUT THIS... THIS WOULD WORK! It would be the utter and complete destruction of <br />
the curse! <br />
<br />
It couldn't be allowed to happen! It must not happen! The curse felt like an armless legless <br />
man forced to sit watching the executioner come with the axe.<br />
<br />
While it had lost the annoying taste of peaceful acceptance and serenity that the statues <br />
slowly gained as their panic and despair turned sour and became serene meditation <br />
almost, it now had the awful taste of -freedom- in it's mouth. <br />
<br />
At least the conflict between the pride and pack had stirred up something nice in it's taste <br />
buds. The bitter sweet guilt from Margot, Megan and Ashley. The confusion and anxiety of <br />
Abbey. And of course Kaylee dislike of having to give up her precious video games. And <br />
the entire sprinkling of defeat the entire pack felt at having to retreat from the manor. <br />
Sadly the agitation and betray the pride should have felt when they failed to understand <br />
their lion selves were their fate now wasn't last nearly as long as it should have. They were <br />
quickly becoming as horrid tasting as the pack! <br />
<br />
And that one, Amy. In her own way she was as dangerous as Alice! The curse had no clue <br />
what she really was, but she was no mere wolf child! Amy couldn't figure out what she <br />
actually was! So the curse couldn't sense it either! It was like the warmth from the sun <br />
followed her wherever she went... and it left a horrid sun burn on the curse. <br />
<br />
And the curse would -swear- that Amy looked over her shoulder and SAW the curse that <br />
connected to her like a second shadow, she was looking right at it! <br />
<br />
The curse didn't like that either in the least. <br />
<br />
Sadly, the curse's option were limited. It could cause a transformation or alteration outside <br />
of a transform or dare, and it couldn't kill someone who didn't even have a hurt or bring -<br />
direct- harm on someone who was curse since that would be hurting itself (and would <br />
end that line of the curse and thus that line of human misery). <br />
<br />
But it had to do something. It had to survive! IT MUST SURVIVE! IT WAS THE GAME!!! It was <br />
the only thing that gave this no face worthless town any meaning!!! All the miserable <br />
mutant freaks of nature, all the absurdly endowed men and women, all the sapient objects <br />
screaming screams no one could hear! ALL SO BEAUTIFUL!<br />
<br />
And these ants sought to ruin it all?! FAT CHANCE! <br />
<br />
Like it's ancestor the rings of invisibility mention in Plato's play (both rings long since <br />
destroyed and annihilated along with their magic). It basic talent was simply removing <br />
sociological restrictions on a person's mind, letting their id run wild, letting their selfish <br />
and petty side in total control. <br />
<br />
The wolves ha grown far too cautious of it. And the pride had no intention of using it again <br />
except to put the shackles of civilization back on the wolves' brains! DISGUSTING!!!<br />
<br />
It couldn't allow this! It must not allow this!!! <br />
<br />
Kaylee, and Jensen, yes, Kyle and Jennifer, who all this smaller and beautiful pettiness had <br />
started and then exploded into something much larger and greater in just the curse of a <br />
week! <br />
<br />
And all too soon it was all coming to an end-?! It was too soon! Too soon! IT MUST NEVER <br />
EVER END!!!<br />
<br />
If only it could influence Jensen just a bit, just influence him a tiny bit, and encourage <br />
Kaylee's love of seeing a statue transformation, if only it could muster enough influence to <br />
do that, to have Jensen turn the two AWOL she-wolves who held turns and turn them into <br />
new statues as examples of what happened to those who defied the authority of their -<br />
MASTER-, Alpha Male and Alpha Female. If only it could do that, then the conflict would <br />
need never end! <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Amy looked at the lavender and purple wolves. Sarah and Ulysses. One a young woman, <br />
the other an early teenager. They looked back. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's us, you're Zack's little girl right? Amy?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is the name I have for this incarnation yes.&quot; She said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Came all the way up here to say hi before we head to the island?&quot; Sarah asked simply, <br />
wonder what she'd look like in victorian era dancer girl dress in the mirror world. <br />
<br />
Yomato had apparently been in full Samurai armor, while the four other japanese wolves <br />
had been geisha girls without the face paint or bonnets. Though Chiyoye might have been <br />
a konichi, contrary to movie land, most ninjas on the job didn't look like ninjas (which was <br />
the entire point). <br />
<br />
They hadn't talked about what the art wolves had been dressed as. Their bodies were <br />
statuesque however as any of the pack could see, like they were still statues only now <br />
were flesh and blood instead of marble. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Amy shook her head, &quot;I'm just here to ask. Do you really care about Ulysses-kun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Sarah said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;And do you care about Sarah-san, er-chan?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I do.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... And Mary-chan is your friend... right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know about Mary?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy wondered that herself. &quot;That doesn't matter. The point is, do you still wish to be with <br />
Mary-Chan? As your friend?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though the Nippon wolves and I saw that their forms are locked like ours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.....&quot; Ulysses started, then said, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah only stood back and observed, she loved that there was now some determination in <br />
the man-pup's eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then you know a war between the pride and the pack will have the exact opposite effect, <br />
you two would be forced to fight each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I don't want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want that either.&quot; Amy said, &quot;Which is why it has to end. We are becoming <br />
something beautiful, this pack of 'Big Bad Wolves.' But if this war comes to pass, the scars <br />
will never go away, and we shall remain ugly.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ulysses didn't know what to say to that. <br />
<br />
That was when Hope and Grace, two of Kaylee's replicas, stood before the gargoyles and <br />
asked them the game. Amy wondered what they were doing... until she heard Alice's <br />
phrasing that sealed their forms.<br />
<br />
Amy felt like she had been run through by a kodachi.... she was horrified, she felt, <br />
ASHAMED, like she should have been able to do something but she hadn't done anything <br />
at all! She actually held her head and fell over on her side!<br />
<br />
IT WAS WHAT MASTER WANTED SO WHY THE HADES SHOULD IT BE WRONG?! IT DIDN'T <br />
MAKE ANY SENSE!!!<br />
<br />
But something that went deeper than her gut, deeper than her base instincts told her that <br />
she had failed, she had failed the six who were now living statues for eternity.  And she <br />
had every right to be ashamed. <br />
<br />
Sarah managed to grab Amy before the white and red she wolf fell over the side onto the <br />
ground two stories below. <br />
<br />
&quot;AMY! Are you okay-?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Sarah saw the red and white pup look up, and Sarah realized shockingly that Amy was <br />
crying.</p>
