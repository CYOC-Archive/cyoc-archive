<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Before any of the disbelievers could come forth Madame Illusia came up to 
Stephan and whispered in his ear. She pointed at one man who stood apart. Stephan 
nodded and said, "Well those disbelievers in back will have to wait. Madame Illusia 
has just spotted a gentleman who looks like he could use a bit of magic in his life. 
Come on up here sir."</p>
<p>The crowd murmured amongst themselves as the guy Madame Illusia pointed out 
came forward and up onto the stage. "Who is he?" several men asked.</p>
<p>"Well it seems these people don't recognize you," Stephan said with a smile. "Tell 
us who you are and why you're here in this town."</p>
<p>"My name is Rick and I'm visiting some friends," the man said looking a little 
nervous.</p>
<p>"Are your friends in the audience here Rick?"</p>
<p>"They had a family emergency to attend to so I decided to come here."</p>
<p>"Well we all hope that things turn out alright with them," Stephan said drawing out 
"all" and sweeping out his hand to included everyone in the tent. "Now will you us your 
age?"</p>
<p>Rick shrugged and said, "I'm thirty-seven."</p>
<p>"I hope you don't mind me saying this but you look a bit pale."</p>
<p>"I don't go out in the sun," Rick replied guessing at what Stephan wanted.</p>
<p>For his part Stephan's eyes got wide and he took a couple steps back saying, 
"Looks like we have a vampire here." This earned a chuckle from the crowd. He 
became a little more serious as he said, "You do need some color and Madame Illusia 
can provide that. First though you must take off your clothes so the audience can 
watch the change. Of course Madame Illusia could remove them for you but you 
wouldn't see what you have in your pocket again. It's your choice though."</p>
<p>Rick had a few things he wanted to keep and he really believed that Madame 
Illusia possessed real magic. There was no way he could figure out that a chicken 
could appear to regress in plain sight of everyone. That couldn't have been a trick like 
a lot of these people probably thought. He also had the suspicion that they would be 
proved wrong by the end of the night. Even though he was a bit shy he took off his 
clothes to give everyone a good look. "Now what?" he asked playing along with 
Stephan. "Do I get in a box?"</p>
<p>"Just stand right there while Madame Illusia works her magic," Stephan said 
gathering up Rick's clothes. "I'll just take your clothes in back and bring you something 
else to wear after your transformation." With that he headed toward the back of the 
tent.</p>
<p>Madame Illusia stood behind Rick and began reciting spells in her language that 
he felt like he should know. He felt something sweep through him and he closed his 
eyes shuddering from... pleasure? He felt his dick get hard but he didn't care about it. 
He didn't care that there were a bunch of gay men staring at him. Slowly his skin 
started to darken until it was the same olive color as Madame Illusia. The change didn't 
stop there though as his hair darkened from brown to raven black and started to grow 
longer. As his hair was growing he was shrinking from a height of five foot eight to a 
height of five foot four. The hair on his body fell out leaving a patch around his 
genitals. His waist narrowed as his growing hair reached it and stopped while his 
stomach flattened and his hips widened. His adam's apple disappeared while his neck 
slimmed. His arms and legs grew slim while his hands and feet grew dainty and 
feminine. His face took on more of an oval shape as his lips plumped up a bit. His ass 
grew a bit while his areolae darkened a bit and grew in diameter breasts growing 
behind them until they were about a c cup size. All throughout the change he had 
been getting younger going from thirty-seven to eighteen and there was only one 
change left. His dick jerked as it started to shrink his balls pulling up into his body and 
his ball sack also shrank. It was a few moments before his dick had shrunk down to a 
little nub while the urethra slid out of it and made a new opening below the remnants 
of his dick. What was left of his genitals moved down to between his legs as a new 
hole began to open and drill into him. Soon he had a pussy and with the change 
complete he had his first orgasm as a woman dripping cum from her urethra. A few of 
the guys were asking why she was taking a piss on stage.</p>
<p>Rick opened her eyes as Stephan came back out and said, "I'd like you all to meet 
my sister Trinity."</p>
<p>"Sister?" Trinity asked looking very confused as Stephan handed her some 
clothes.</p>
<p>"Mother saw something in you and wanted you as her daughter," Stephan said 
smiling. "She did that with me too and I couldn't be happier about it. Now get dressed 
so you can help me with the next part." As soon as Trinity had dressed and looked 
very much like a younger Madame Illusia Stephan turned back to the audience and 
asked, "Is there anyone here who still doubts Madame Illusia's power?"</p>
<p>The same men again made rude gestures and one even said, "You're just frauds 
and scammers trying to get our money like all sideshow freaks."</p>
<p>"He called us frauds, scammers, and freaks. He shall pay for that," Madame Illusia 
murmured behind Trinity the anger and venom in her voice barely concealed.</p>
<p>"There's one in every crowd," Stephan muttered sighing. He then put on a smile 
and said, "Madame Illusia will make you into a believer if you care to come up to the 
stage."</p>
<p>"I doubt it," the guy said standing and coming toward the stage.</p>
<p>"We would like another volunteer from the audience so any of you brave enough to 
have Madame Illusia work her magic on you please raise your hands." Many hands 
went up into the air some a little hesitant. Stephan smiled more and said, "We do have 
a brave crowd here. Now Trinity will move among you and select on of you to join us 
on stage." He lowered his voice and said, "Follow your instincts and smile. I know you 
probably have some more questions you want answered and we'll answer them as 
best we can after the show is over."</p>
<p>Trinity nodded then went out into the audience smiling. Stephan had said to follow 
her instincts and right now her instincts were pulling her toward a specific man. 
Reaching out and touching him she said, "Come on up to the stage sir."</p>
<p>The man looked a little nervous but followed Trinity up to the stage where the 
other man was now.</p></p>
