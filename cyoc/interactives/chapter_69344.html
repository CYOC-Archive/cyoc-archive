<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You look at the girls, amazed at the changes you have made to them with the flashlight. Even though you hardly know any of Stacy's friends, you can tell that their personalities have changed almost as much as their bodies.<br />
<br />
Megan looks down at her flat chest, then to Tammy and you and then amazingly well endowed Stacy before her eyes fall on Jenny's manly physique, &quot;Since we're talking about that sort of thing, I'm really dying to know, how did Jared react to you asking him out back in high school? There were all sorts of rumors I know, but I want to know what was true.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was cool fine with it. Maybe it surprised him a little at first, especially since I first asked him out in the middle of my first season on the football team,&quot; Jenny let out a deep chuckle at the memory, &quot;It was now or never though. He was one of the best players after all and several of the cheerleaders were starting to pay way too much attention to him&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were one of the other best players,&quot; Stacy reminded, &quot;Don't forget that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but I was afraid that if I didn't make the first move Jared would ask one of them out. I mean I was afraid that he thought of me as just a friend even though I'd had a crush on him since middle school,&quot; Jenny smiled at the recollection, &quot;It was right after the game, we were heading back to the locker room and I asked him right there in front of the rest of the team. The guys thought it was a riot and looking back I guess it was. Jared said yes and that was it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tammy nodded, then asked, &quot;Did he get made fun of at all for it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; Jenny laughed again and flexed her muscles, &quot;The guys on the team knew I'd kick their asses if they said anything. I mean with the way I was working out that season I was really starting to get muscular, and no one off the team would dare make fun of the captain of the football team.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you feel about that,&quot; Tammy pressed on, &quot;I mean with all the working out you were doing you were really starting to look like a guy by that point. Didn't it make you feel awkward?&quot;<br />
<br />
At this Jenny looked thoughtful and after a long moment she shrugged, &quot;Not really. I mean I always was a bit of a tomboy and sports were my thing. The only really awkward time was when I first realized that I was going to have to start shaving, but I got used to it pretty quick. Being part of the football team made it easier, most of the other guys had started growing facial hair around the same time and I'll tell you this, it beats the hell out of having to shave my legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
She gestured at her hairy legs to emphasize this before continuing, &quot;How about you Tammy? I mean I'm really curious about what it was like for you. I can tell you from checking out the guys in the locker room that even back in high school you were better endowed than any of them. What does Mark think of your dick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tammy blushed, &quot;Well, it was kind of awkward at first. I mean Mark had suspected as much before he asked me out, but I don't think he'd realized just how much it was. Despite his best efforts I put off sex for nearly two years after we started dating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh,&quot; Stacy purred, leaning forward excitedly, &quot;Tell us about your first time!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jenny encouraged, &quot;If you tell I'll tell too and I'm sure you all want to know what Jared's like in bed. I bet it'll surprise you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite her embarrassment, it was too much for Tammy to pass up, &quot;Okay. It was in our senior year of high school. My parents were out for the night and Mark and I were watching a movie together at my house. We were all cuddled up next to each other, he had his hand on my thigh and I had my hand in his pants, playing with his balls. Before that point I'd given him lots of handjobs and sucked his cock a whole bunch of times, but I'd never let him do anything more than play with my breasts. He was begging me to let him do something to me, but I kept telling him no. The thing was, he was adamant about what he wanted to do, which was sixty-nine. The way he was describing it was so hot that I was rock hard and he could tell. Before I could stop him, he reached over and gave my cock a squeeze through my pants and I nearly fainted right there on the spot. It felt so good. For a few minutes he played with me that way, then he undid my fly and he nearly fell off the couch. He hadn't expected me to be bigger than him, but he handled it really well. While he recovered he started stroking me, giving me a handjob just like I'd done for him all those times. I was dripping pre like you wouldn't believe and he actually bent down and licked it off. The way I was squirming and moaning must have encouraged him, because he got up on the couch and sixty-nined, just like he wanted. His mouth felt so good that I came in no time at all, nearly choking him...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tammy closed her eyes, lost in the memory. Her swim trunks were tented by her massive cock and she was squirming like she was trying to hide it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn...&quot; Jenny let out a whistle, &quot;I'd forgotten how big you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eyes snapping open, Tammy looked at Jenny like a deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming truck. Red with embarrassment Tammy adjusted her swim trunks over her rapidly wilting erection, &quot;Your turn now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Jenny stretched, &quot;The first time we had sex was after a football game. We'd totally crushed the other team so we were all in high spirits. By that time I wasn't changing in the girl's locker room any more because by that point I looked so much like a guy that the coach tended to forget. I'd just gotten out of the shower and was walking around with nothing on but a towel. The other guys were joking and teasing, telling me to drop the towel. They'd all seen me naked before, so it wasn't any big deal and I went along with them. I think their original plan was to sneak a few of the cheerleaders in there and we were going to try and pressure one of them into eating me out. All the talk was getting me horny, and Jared too, probably because every time he got near I leaned against the wall and spread my legs, fingering myself and generally doing what I could to teas him. The guys were really egging us on and you know how it is, in high school you do a lot of stupid stuff. The next thing I knew I was up against the lockers and Jared was balls deep in my pussy, fucking me like there was no tomorrow. All the guys were cheering and I must have come at least five times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow,&quot; Stacy bubbled with laughter, &quot;That's where the infamous football orgy rumors came from. Did you make a tradition of it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah. Every time we won Jared got to fuck me in the locker room. It was real motivation for the two of us to play our best,&quot; Jenny gave her pussy a pat through her bikini bottom, &quot;But here's the real kicker. Both Jared and I like rough sex and though Jared doesn't like to admit it, I'm stronger than he is. Unless I let him, I'm always the one on top and calling the shots.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; Megan's eyes light up, &quot;That's pretty hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You like submissive guys?&quot; Stacy asks her, then looks at you with a smile.<br />
<br />
Considering what you'd used the flashlight to do to yourself that day, giving yourself breasts and an otherwise androgynous figure, you suppose that you are a pretty submissive guy. You smile back at her and she licks her lips and mouths the word 'later'.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but since everyone else is confessing things I might as well too,&quot; Megan shrugs, trying to act like she's not uncomfortable with the situation, &quot;I don't like men, I like women.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh damn!&quot; Jenny exclaims, jumping up and laughing, &quot;No wonder you wanted us to take our tops off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it's hot,&quot; Stacy says, winking at you. Apparently the porn star body the flashlight gave her also made her quite kinky, &quot;So does looking at my titties make you wet?&quot;<br />
<br />
For good measure Stacy leans forward and presses her enormous breasts together.<br />
<br />
Megan nods.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about his titties?&quot; Stacy gestures at you, &quot;Can those make you forget that he's a guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Megan lets out a nervous little laugh, &quot;If he hadn't asked you out back in high school I would have asked him out myself. Not because I could get over the fact that he was a guy. I don't like cock at all, but because I really like breasts a lot. Probably because I don't have 'em.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; Stacy licks the tip on one of her fingers, then runs it around her nipple, &quot;Would you be up for a threesome? You get to play with our breasts, I could eat you out and he could fuck my pussy. It would be so hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
You cross your fingers, hoping that Megan will say yes, but much to your disappointment she shakes her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's way too kinky for me. I might be a lesbian, but I'm not the adventurous sort,&quot; Megan says before quickly changing the conversation, &quot;How about we have something to eat now? I'm starving.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other girls agree and you go into the house with them, pondering what else might come from this most exceptional day.</p>
