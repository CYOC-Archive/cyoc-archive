<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mike snickered at what became of his friend; Drake stood there suddenly transformed by the power of the Genie, making of his masculine self a well defined form of a mature very male donkey.<br />
<br />
Embarrassed at the first realized feeling of what he so suddenly became, Drake reacted with common poise as would any a member of the Equine linage, he became aroused, and his elongated donkey pecker fell down in all its sexual glory.  <br />
<br />
Those fellows enter into the bathroom saw the animal, and thinking it was some elaborate particle joke, they stepped closer to Drake and tried to befriend the beast. <br />
<br />
Wagging tail and with every taken step a wagging flank slapping donkey cock swung and flopped, having such girth and swelled mass, that some of those there knelt down, and with still soapy hands, did begin stroking Drake into his having a true donkey size climax.<br />
<br />
Braying his feelings of being so touched and humiliated, Drake found his animal instincts beginning to prevail on him to act accordingly to what is common for a donkey to do.<br />
<br />
As the laughing boys crowded around the masturbated donkey, those kneeling watched with wide eyes and opened mouths as Drake with his remarkable new able libido, held his cock horizontal, and then blew out the load. Spewing forth in s stout rush, the semen of both human and donkey mixed and blended, making of the load a highly infectious liquid.<br />
<br />
Those kneeling and with wild wonder at seeing their first ever donkey blowing off a load, they caught some of the semen inside those mouths. <br />
<br />
Laughter and friends doing friends a real wrong, those who stood behind those kneeling close, laid hands on them, forcing the boys down low to take the brunt of all what Drake the donkey stud fired.<br />
<br />
Soaked faces, coughing friends, a couple got more than did others, they choked, swallowed some of the very infectious semen, and coughing, went to get a drink and wash out the yuck'o taste.<br />
<br />
As someone entered the bathroom, Drake saw his chance, he bolting past those still laughing and finding the situation as quite humorous, the donkey wishing to be outside, free of captivity, Drake then ran away, entering then gleefully into the world and realm of being a stud male donkey.<br />
<br />
Mike stood there not knowing what tot do, he had wished his friend to be a donkey, something they had many a time done as a role play if just in fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Genie, I must return Drake to be again as he was, being human as as my friend.&quot; Mike said, he felt a sense of worry for his changed friend.<br />
<br />
The Genie remained silent, and Mike turned to see the Genie, he the only one there in that bathroom that could see the powerful spirit, and said to the Genie, &quot;Do it, make Drake a human again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My young master, the transforming of a person to being as is an animal does more than change their body and soon their mind. It causes a ripple in time, changing what was into was you wished it to become. As is your friend Drake was never born now as a human, but dropped out the standing womb of a jennet donkey, he is as a son to her, losing soon all his learned memories, and becoming a fine breeder Jack donkey.&quot; The Genie informs Mike, as before he can ask the Genie another question...<br />
<br />
&quot;My Master, something more, the masturbating of Drake as a donkey, his expended semen, those who were fortunate, or unfortunate to have ingested, swallowed the semen, they too will discover their bodies changing, becoming partially likened to being as a donkey, each gaining a male tool with increased hormones to drive them sexually mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob Nines stood by a sink trying to gulp water as he washed his face clean of the congealing sticky semen blow over his face.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Bob stood up, his eyes and face expressing much of what he felt.<br />
<br />
Turning on one heel, Bob charged for a toilet stall, slamming the door shut, locking it, he stood inside trying to puke.<br />
<br />
Fellow students laughed, and all but Mike exited the bathroom, as for Bob standing in the stall, his future home would be that as well of a stall, but one made in a barn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh holy crap, damn, what did that stuff do..., do to me!&quot; Bob yelled with a sound of surprise, he having dug out his pecker to pee, finding it and the giant penis of the donkey as suddenly a kin of one with the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cripe, look at this monster, I must be tow feet long, the thing as thick as a pop can, and the head, golly, the frickin' thing looks like a toilet plunger. Oh, oh damn, the feel of it, it is so much more sensual that mime, mine..., hell's bells, the thing is mine, its part of me!&quot; Mike said as he began to release his bladder and the force with flow that followed had him moaning, as if appreciative of what he had and felt.<br />
<br />
Mike thought to knock at the stall door and verbalize his regret, but as he approached the stall door, Bob stood upright, and sticking higher than his head, he had two tall and furry donkey like ears.<br />
<br />
Moaning as if feeling a drastic urgent need, and Mike standing outside of the row of toilet stalls, did see clothing removed and let to drop onto the floor about the toilet. <br />
<br />
More moans, Mike wondering, had to say something, he knocking at the toilet stall door to announce his being there, said then, &quot;Bob, this is Mike, and I think I am the reason you are seeing a change...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike got just that far in his short sermon, when the stall door swung open, and standing there with a glaring look of hate and anger, stood a naked Bob, naked, but covered with a thick coat of donkey red colored fur. He stood with the same huge donkey cock and dong as what Drake seemed to have enjoyed. Standing there, Bob, his thighs changing as feet elongated, heels became as hind hocks, and toes bled a black ooze fro around toenail curricle, forming into a surrounding solid hoof. <br />
<br />
Lips thickening, Bob groaned out saying, &quot;You, somehow..., you did this, caused this, praise be, thank you Mike, thank you, you do not know what wonderful thing you did by allowing me to change, to become as this, oh how I will adore becoming and living my life as is a donkey, thanks so much, thank you, thank you, than...k...hee..., hee-haw, hee-haw!&quot; Words became impossible for Bob to say, his lips and tongue, mouth and muzzle, his face and head, all changing rapidly, becoming donkey. <br />
<br />
&quot;He is happy to become as a donkey, Genie, why?&quot; Mike asked as then the Genie appeared, to Mike, and as well allowed Bob to see the embodiment of what a genie looks like, when and if he allows one to see him.<br />
<br />
&quot;He likes it because he once fantasized the idea of his becoming like an animal, Bob there had many times wished he was an animal, a horse quite often, a few times liking the thought of his being likened to a bull, once even wihing he was a pig boar, he is thrilled at the delight. As for bob, his change comes by way of infection and wanting of it, as he will remember everything about his being human, of what he learned as to date, and thinking rationally, he will have more fun being a donkey.&quot; Genie explains, and to Mike he shakes his head in disbelief, seeing Bob changing faster, the student friend turning to stand his changed arms then forelegs on the toilet seat, stretching out his then hind legs long, he hung his donkey cock toward the toilet and let flow again a river of stench.<br />
<br />
Mike remembered he was or should be in class right then, and not knowing whether he should stay to let Bob out the bathroom when he did his final changing, the Genie smiled, and announced he would remain and then let Bob run out and be free.</p>
