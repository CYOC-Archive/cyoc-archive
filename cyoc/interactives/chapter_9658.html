<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The last bell had finally rung and Ty and Allen were just walking out the large doors of the main building where the classrooms were, when they were stopped by a female voice.<br />
<br />
“Ty! Tyler!! Hold on for a second!” the girl said out loud. It was Jennifer, one of the girls in Ty’s English class. Jennifer was short and skinny with long, blond hair. She looked a lot like Brittany Spears, in a way, and she always dressed in jeans and really nice and colorful shirts.<br />
<br />
“Hey Jen! What’s up?” Ty answered, allowing the girl to catch her breath from running after him.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Ty, I need to ask you a big favor” she replied. Ty immediately smiled, for he knew that this girl had knowledge of his powers and he figured she was going to ask him to change something to her body.<br />
<br />
“Do you know Eric? The short guy in English class?” she asked. Ty thought about it for a moment and then nodded that he did know who this was. “Well, I kinda like him, but he is horribly shy and he really doesn’t think high of himself at all. Can you do something to make him feel good about himself?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll take care of him! Don’t worry! He won’t be shy anymore!” Ty replied happily.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Ty. Please be nice to him. He’s always down on himself, you know? Just make him feel more confident! Thanks, you’re the BEST!” she said excitedly. Then she wrapped her long, slender arms around Ty’s neck and gave him a kiss, causing Ty to blush all over.<br />
<br />
“Boy! It pays to know a little magic, huh?” Allen said, after Jennifer had left. Ty had a big, red lipstick imprint on his cheek.<br />
<br />
“It sure does! Come on, Allen. Let’s sit down at the park so we can tune in to our victims, shall we?” Ty responded. Both Ty and Allen walked over to the park which was down the street from Ty’s house. There were several benches there, which were facing the empty basketball court, where Dustin, Peter and Ryan have had so many encounters already. The teens sat down there and closed their eyes.<br />
<br />
“So, what’s my cousin up to?” Ty asked Allen, who had the power to change Peter any time he wanted to. <br />
<br />
“He’s still at school! He’s at the school’s newspaper office!” Allen replied. Then Ty tried to tune in to Eric. Eric was a short, stocky guy. He wasn’t very popular, for he was known as a bit of a geek. He was one of Peter’s friends, and he was also into the school computer club and the school newspaper.<br />
<br />
“Well, what do you know? We’ll kill two birds with one stone! Eric is with Peter!” Ty replied. Eric was wearing a sweater and jeans while Peter was wearing a sweater with shorts.<br />
<br />
“You work on my cousin’s skinny legs while I work on Eric’s height and pecs!” Ty said to Allen.<br />
<br />
“Roger that, Tyler!” Allen replied. <br />
<br />
Eric was only 5’4” tall, and at 17 years old, he was one of the shortest juniors in school. Ty concentrated on him and right away his legs began to grow three inches longer. Eric felt a weird tingling in his legs, as he looked down. Both Peter and Eric were sitting at a big meeting table in the conference room. Eric had to adjust his position in the chair, for the growth in his legs had pushed his knees against the edge of the table. Then he stretched his legs out more and sensed that his legs had grown longer?<br />
<br />
Then he felt the same tingling feeling in his pectorals. His pecs began to inflate a little, and Eric noticed how his sweater began to fill up around his chest. He grew 3 inches wider, and he noticed that the sweater was no longer hanging loose on him. What was going on?<br />
<br />
The meeting was over and Peter and Eric had gotten up. Daniel, one of the editors, immediately noticed something different about Eric.<br />
<br />
“Hey Eric, have you been working out?” Daniel asked him. Eric’s sweater fit too tight around his bulging pectorals. But Daniel noticed something else, too. “Hey dude, have you grown? You seem a bit taller…”<br />
<br />
“I dunno… I guess…” Eric said, while looking down at his chest. Peter and Eric had walked out of the room. Eric was feeling a little confused. Peter didn’t say anything, but he sensed that somebody was using some power on his friend.<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter?” Peter asked Eric, who was walking very slow coming out of the building and was constantly feeling his pectorals with his hands.<br />
<br />
“Peter, do I look bigger to you? I mean, do I look taller? Does my chest seem bigger to you as well?” Eric asked him.<br />
<br />
Peter was about to answer when he felt a tingling sensation in his own legs. His calves began to itch like crazy. As he bent down to scratch them with his hands, he noticed that the muscles were getting bigger and harder.<br />
<br />
“Holy crap! Look at your legs! Your calves are growing!” Eric said, while pointing to Peter’s legs. Peter looked down and noticed that his calves were getting huge, almost freakish. They were like two softballs, jutting out from his lower legs, below the knees. They were becoming massive, and Peter almost began to look like a cyclist or a soccer play!<br />
<br />
“Hmm… I think I know who’s doing this. Well, I have to go home. See you tomorrow, okay?” Peter said to Eric. The two parted ways, as Peter walked right passed the park, where Ty and Allen were.<br />
<br />
“Good job, Allen. Let’s play with our victims some more, now that they have separated!” Ty said, showing an evil grin.<br />
<br />
“And you had better help your guy with his confidence. Now, what should I do to your cousin?” Allen asked Ty. Ty just turned to him with the widest grin on his face.<br />
<br />
“Blow him up! Let him see what REAL muscle growth feels like!” Ty responded sarcastically. Both Ty and Allen laughed, as they closed their eyes and focused on their victims.</p>
