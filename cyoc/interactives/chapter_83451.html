<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cal couldn&#39;t stop there. There was something keeping him from stopping.<br />
<br />
The Devil&#39;s greatest weapon: temptation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I had some muscle - no. I wish I had loads of muscle!&quot; Cal roared like a drunk.<br />
<br />
Cal had to wait almost no time for the changes to set in.<br />
<br />
His long chest tightened as impossibly huge pectoral muscles embossed themselves into his chest. With every breath, his lungs pushed out further, but when Cal breathed back in, his chest did not pull back. Instead, he had huge muscles obscuring his feet from his view.<br />
<br />
The tightening moved down to his abs, where, in the mirror, he saw himself getting stronger by the second. Criss crosses of humongous muscle was completely visible. Impossible not to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeaah! This is great!&quot; Cal yelled.<br />
<br />
Cal felt the pleasure surge settle near his shoulders. He felt a strong tingling, like an electric shock. His shoulder blades put on layers and layers of muscle and his shoulder muscles stuck out from the back of his body, while the actual shoulders themselves broadened at great speed, giving him a V shaped back and chest. It looked great.<br />
<br />
His arms next - his biceps layered on muscle like overly large amounts of icing on a cake. His biceps stopped bulging at the size of watermelons, and Cal&#39;s arms became thicker than a tree trunk, and his hands were huge and meaty.<br />
<br />
The top half of Cal&#39;s body was huge, bigger than anything Cal had seen in his life, and it was followed by pound after pound of muscle being added to Cal&#39;s legs, until they were twice as thick as his arms.<br />
<br />
To hold all the weight, Cal&#39;s feet widened and got bigger, and he could never fit his feet into his shoes. Not in a gazillion years.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I had tight clothes and shoes that I could wear with this big body!&quot; Cal shouted with pleasure, and a neat set of clothes lay on his bed.<br />
<br />
[|=|]<br />
<br />
If anything, Cal looked better while wearing clothes. All the parts of his muscular, huge body were visible. Every single detail, from his bulging pecs with a huge trench in the middle to the crosses of his powerful abdominals.<br />
<br />
It was an amazing feeling, but there was one thing that Cal had forgotten.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh! Man! Gotta take this thing off quick!&quot; Cal hurried to take his trousers off as the tingling finally settled in his genital area.<br />
<br />
Before there had been almost nothing to fill Cal&#39;s small boxer shorts, but Cal could feel his genitals bubbling up.<br />
<br />
Looking in the mirror Cal could see his boxers beginning to fill with his new and growing package. Cal&#39;s boxers couldn&#39;t take it much longer and he was forced to remove them.<br />
<br />
He had balls the size of basket balls, and his member was about to join in on the fun. It twitched and convulsed, slowly gaining length, from just two inches to something unimaginable.<br />
<br />
Cal yelped in happiness as his member surpassed five inches, to seven, to ten. Something Cal had never experienced before... he began to get hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, man! What&#39;s this?!&quot; <br />
<br />
His manhood continued growing, passing a foot and reaching a foot and a half. Even longer it grew and it finally stopped at four feet long.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... man... wait till Jones sees this baby!&quot; Cal whispered to himself, as his manhood began to harden and straighten out.<br />
<br />
At full length it was almost six feet long.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that... is going to be difficult to hide.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal made another pair of trousers and boxers appear, which he put on as his member softened again.<br />
<br />
There was a huge bulge... and he loved it.<br />
<br />
Keep the love, Cal. Keep the love.<br />
<br />
[|=|]<br />
<br />
Cal walked downstairs to the kitchen, where his mother was making dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi... mother...&quot; Cal said, and his mother turned around.<br />
<br />
She turned around again, but Cal was sure that he could see his mother shake her head, just slightly before turning around.<br />
Cal was doing it wrong. He wasn&#39;t keeping the love.<br />
<br />
But he had to keep his body.<br />
<br />
[|=|]<br />
<br />
At school, no one could resist looking at Cal. Boys and girls alike marvelled in fear and admiration at his amazing structure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jones. You&#39;ve GOT to try this!&quot; Cal said at lunch with Jones again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cal. You know that you ain&#39;t doin&#39; it right, man. You ain&#39;t keepin&#39; the love like the note said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jones! It&#39;s fun though! It&#39;s great!&quot;<br />
<br />
And Jones was the second person to shake his head.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cal&#39;s life was beginning to crumble apart. And it was all his fault. But he loved it.<br />
<br />
Life over pleasure? <br />
It was the most difficult decision of his life.</p>
