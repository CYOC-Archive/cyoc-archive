<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What Frances didn&#39;t mention to Samantha and Akane was that the biggest issue with Jenny&#39;s condition wasn&#39;t Jenny or Yvette. It was Harry. The new werefox&#39;s bond to Jenny was firm and strong and when the doctors voiced the conclusion that Jenny&#39;s vitals were beginning to fade, he very nearly went nuts. Frances could only watch, almost with tears as he implored Jenny to speak to him, rubbed her hands in ways that Frances had done for Samantha at times when she was trying to console her wife over something with her work that Samantha was frustrated with, and then periodically turned to whoever came into the room, be it a doctor or Frances, herself, and begged them to save Jenny. It very much reminded Frances of the end scene from the movie &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; in which the Tin Man said to Dorothy, &quot;Now I know I have a heart... because it&#39;s breaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
After relaying the instructions to the hospital staff, Frances returned to Jenny&#39;s room, where Harry hadn&#39;t moved. He was still seated there and looking nervously to Jenny. It only made her sigh. The emergency interrupted what had been her schedule for the morning, and her scheduled appointment would have to be changed, but at the same time, she was also certain that this was still more important than one of her standard appointments. She could see just how close Harry was to breaking at seeing the woman he loved in such a state.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t fair,&quot; Harry said weakly, &quot;I love her... I became a werefox for her... and now she&#39;s dying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; Frances said slowly, &quot;there is still time and when Yvette regains consciousness we will make sure that she completes Jenny&#39;s transformation. And she is in the room next to Jenny&#39;s... we&#39;ll know when she wakes up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry looked up to the werecat and Frances could see that his eyes were red with tears, not transformation. In a way it even broke Frances&#39; heart to see the young man in such pain. She hoped that things could be handled quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Harry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t let her die if we can help it and we do have her,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;once she&#39;s complete... Jenny can begin to heal...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry only sighed and looked back to Jenny, who was still semi-conscious on the bed that she had been placed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yveeeeetttttteee... I... I neeeeeeeed yooooooooouuuuuuuu!&quot; Jenny moaned in a sort of delirium-like state.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
In another room, Yvette woke up to find that she was no longer in the courtroom and back in human form. Her head hurt a little, but she also could tell that she was rapidly healing. While concussions hurt, unlike normal humans that could take weeks or months to fully heal from a concussion, were-beasts healed from them quickly. It was all part of the natural regeneration ability that allowed were-beasts to survive most injuries. The second thing she found was that she was handcuffed to the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where... where am I?&quot; Yvette asked trying to get a sense on things.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re in the hospital,&quot; grunted one of the weredog officers guarding her, &quot;your little stunt in the courtroom gave you a concussion... not to mention that you&#39;ve put the second victim into quite a state because of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvette blinked, but didn&#39;t really care. She watched as the two officers than looked to each other. The first then said to the second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go let Mrs. Twist and the hospital staff know that she&#39;s is awake,&quot; the first spoke, &quot;We&#39;ll see if we can get that poor girl completed before things get much worse for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
The second nodded and left the room while Yvette only looked on quietly. She figured that this related the girl that she had clawed in the tent. A good part of Yvette really didn&#39;t care, though. They had their happy bond and each other, and what did SHE have? Nothing. All she wanted was a mate to love her and sire kits with her, and she found William Anderson to be prime material for that role. He was fairly good looking, even before she turned him and he had to be an experienced lover, and that was all Yvette wanted. She couldn&#39;t understand why he kept refusing her. She was sexier than Martha, she knew that, and as a female werefox she instinctively knew how to please a man in a way that Martha would never be able to. She wondered why he turned his back on her in favor of Martha. The question of why burned a hole in her mind along with a desire for revenge against the attorney who promised he&#39;d fight for her and then plead guilty to crimes she was sure she didn&#39;t commit.<br />
<br />
A few moments later and two people entered, one was Harry who to Yvette was now carrying a scrumptious werefox scent along with one of the two werecats from the Anderson home. Both were in their human forms and Yvette thought she saw a look of recognition go through Harry&#39;s eyes. He probably recognized her from the class they all had with Mr. Anderson.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did this to Jenny...&quot; Harry said in a low voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that you&#39;re complaining,&quot; Yvette answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any understanding about what you&#39;ve done to that girl?&quot; Frances asked as she placed a hand on Harry&#39;s shoulder, &quot;she&#39;s incomplete... and at present... it&#39;s eating at her, quite literally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So?&quot; Yvette answered, &quot;Let him have her. That&#39;ll do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t work that way,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;Jenny needs YOU to complete her transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good luck with that,&quot; Yvette snorted and looked away.<br />
<br />
Harry gave a low snarl and moved forward before Frances and the policeman could even respond. He grabbed Yvette by the front of her dress and lifted her up toward him. Yvette actually gave a pained grown as Harry lifted her in such a way that her arms were bent against the way her shoulders would allow her to bend while handcuffed to the bed. Yvette looked to him and actually cowered a bit at two glowing red eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did this to Jenny,&quot; Harry growled, &quot;the woman I love more than life itself. I became a werefox for HER. If you have ANY good in you, you will complete my bonded mate&#39;s transformation and return her to me in full health and no damage to her lady parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if I don&#39;t?&quot; Yvette asked, trying to sound defiant.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will kill you as slowly and as painfully as I can manage, and I&#39;ll gladly go to the chair for it... because if you don&#39;t... Jenny will die... and I&#39;ll have nothing left to live for,&quot; Harry answered as Frances and the police officer managed to pull him away.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can consider reducing your sentence if you cooperate with us on completing Jennifer Harper&#39;s transformation and accepting the medical and psychological tests,&quot; the officer offered, &quot;but a lot of that will depend on how you cooperate. So far, miss, you&#39;ve only made your position worse. Do the smart thing... and the DA might consider a potential deal...&quot;<br />
<br />
They then proceeded to escort Harry out. The officer stayed behind to keep an eye on Yvette as Harry was escorted out.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm yourself! Calm yourself!&quot; Frances urged and barely holding Harry back, clearly noticing the werefox&#39;s drive to protect the one he loves and the desperation that came along with the details related to the situation, &quot;You aren&#39;t helping!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You heard her!&quot; Harry insisted, &quot;that bitch shared classes with Jenny and I! And she had no intention of completing her transformation! She clawed Jenny to get distract the cops and she doesn&#39;t care if Jenny dies!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we won&#39;t let her do that,&quot; Frances insisted, &quot;she will be made to complete Jenny&#39;s transformation. You can be assured of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances then looked to see the tears flowing from his eyes. In a way it broke to see anyone as distraught as Harry looked, especially with the fact that he was faced with losing the one loved more than life itself. He then clutched at her and continued to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were going to get married... live happily ever after... have a family... and that rogue will just rip out my heart,&quot; Harry cried. &quot;It&#39;s not fair!&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances could only pat him on his back as it was clear that he was emotionally breaking down. High hopes for happiness being threatened with complete destruction, and from what she knew of werefox&#39;s bonds, would leave him sad and lonely for a long time. Akane&#39;s loss of her mate in 1945 had been a tragic story, but the Skulk leader&#39;s sons survived the war and she had her grandchildren to pass on a legacy that she could be proud in. If Jenny died, Harry wouldn&#39;t get that and would live out his life loyal to a love he had known only briefly.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, there,&quot; Frances assured him, &quot;We&#39;ll make sure things are set right. We won&#39;t let Jenny die.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the present time, that didn&#39;t help Harry very much, and as Frances caught Samantha&#39;s scent along with Akane&#39;s coming toward them. She turned see them come around a corner to see Frances trying to console Harry. Akane&#39;s grandsons were just behind them. Samantha only raised an eyebrow to Frances as she noticed the werefox clutching at Frances.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yvette has woken up... but has been resistant to the idea of completing Jenny&#39;s transformation,&quot; Frances reported, &quot;which has only made Harold Jenkins&#39; situation worse... as he&#39;s essentially seeing the one he loves die...&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane&#39;s eyes narrowed angrily, &quot;this will not do.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Yvette had relaxed and returned as defiant as could be managed being handcuffed to a bed, and despite the guard&#39;s attempt to get her to accept the mission, Yvette wasn&#39;t going to be moved by promises that likely wouldn&#39;t be met. The one promise she wanted was William to to be given to her and the two of them allowed to leave Moon Lake, but Yvette was smart enough to know that police officers wouldn&#39;t have the power to actually make the plea-bargain deal and it was doubtful that the DA and her traitor attorney would accept such a bargain with regards to her sentencing. And if she wasn&#39;t going to get her personal &quot;happily ever after,&quot; Yvette saw no reason to give anyone else happiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re really not going to do this, in spite of transforming the girl?&quot; the guard asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did it so that you wouldn&#39;t follow me,&quot; Yvette answered, &quot;as I was trying to free MY William. My mission...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was limited to selfish gains that dishonored the entire Skulk,&quot; came an aristocratic voice from the doorway.<br />
<br />
Yvette looked over see Akane standing in the doorway with a deep frown on her face. The guard looked over while he remained ready in case the Skulk leader threatened anything, he also gave a respectful nod, knowing that Akane Tachibana was not the sort of were to threaten violence against anyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;We as werefoxes are always to value intelligence and cunning over brutish actions,&quot; Akane spoke firmly, &quot;but that isn&#39;t an excuse to put others over ourselves or to do things that others do not find fun. You clawed an innocent human to get what you wanted. There is nothing noble in that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... but...&quot; Yvette began, &quot;everyone else gets someone to be with! Martha Anderson doesn&#39;t love him! All I want was to provide him with a mate that is worthy of him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that excuses the death sentence you&#39;re willing to give to an innocent?&quot; Akane asked back, &quot;are you so important that no one else in Moon Lake matters?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Answer my question, KIT,&quot; Akane commanded.<br />
<br />
Yvette only looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will take that as a &quot;no,&quot; kit,&quot; Akane then spoke, &quot;so the life Jennifer Harper and her happiness is not less than yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But no one&#39;s loved ME!&quot; Yvette argued, &quot;she has Harry! Who do I have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Life is not always fair, kit,&quot; Akane said firmly, &quot;if it were, my Osamu would still be alive and by my side. But it is not and he died seventy years ago and I have had to carry on without him. I have not used his death as an excuse to pry an man from his wife... REGARDLESS of whatever difficulties his marriage may have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvette didn&#39;t answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as a vixen of the Skulk you have a responsibility to it to insure that ALL new members join us in a way that they are healthy,&quot; Akane finished, &quot;and you will mean that responsibility in completing Jennifer Harper&#39;s transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Yvette tried to argue.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do realize that to complete her transformation all Jenny needs to do is give you an orgasm, right?&quot; Akane asked, playing to the simple way that were-beast transformations were completed, regardless of what specific were-beast species it was. Yvette nodded. &quot;So you do realize that I could have my grandsons hold you down and let Jenny go to town on you to complete her transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t dare!&quot; Yvette gasped at the threat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Akane asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;She would be forcing herself on me! And I&#39;m not gay! I&#39;m not even bi!&quot; Yvette protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither is Jennifer Harper,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;and yet YOU clawed HER. I have two werefoxes to welcome to the Skulk and I will meet my responsibilities. And since you have shown yourself to have no honor, I do not see the reason not to bend a few rules as it were. Besides... you&#39;ve had no qualms with forcing yourself on others. Perhaps it would be fair that you experience such treatment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what you do for me if I agree?&quot; Yvette asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can request that your sentencing give you the best hope for healing based on future testing,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;nothing more... and if you aren&#39;t going to cooperate, I will take what measures to make sure that Jennifer Harper&#39;s transformation is completed.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Jenny&#39;s opened for a moment to find Harry seated by her. His eyes were red and he had clearly been crying which puzzled her a little. She could also see Samantha Twist and another woman behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harry?&quot; Jenny said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny!&quot; Harry looked up and pulled her into a hug, &quot;You gotta fight, Jenny! Don&#39;t give in!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not complete, Harry,&quot; Jenny said weakly, &quot;Never will be... no one wanted to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Harry insisted, &quot;We do want you complete! And I LOVE YOU! Don&#39;t you die! I can&#39;t go on without you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And with Yvette regaining consciousness recently, we are taking steps to make sure that your transformation is completed,&quot; Samantha told her, &quot;I know things haven&#39;t gone as fast as they should have... but they are things that couldn&#39;t be sped up. I apologize for any difficulty you&#39;ve had to go through with all of this... but we are doing our best to make sure your transformation is completed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially since we&#39;re going to get married,&quot; Harry spoke up, &quot;You don&#39;t think I wouldn&#39;t let you be left incomplete before our wedding would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Harry...&quot; Jenny said weakly.<br />
<br />
Harry only hugged her as the door behind them opened. It revealed one of the nurses who came in and began to remove the IVs and other equipment that Jenny had been hooked up to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Ms. Harper, Yvette Smith has regained consciousness and lycanthropic regeneration is dealing with her concussion,&quot; the nurse said, &quot;given things, we are going to get your transformation completed before moving onto the assorted medical tests on Ms. Smith.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ll be complete?&quot; Jenny asked as she looked to the nurse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, dear,&quot; the nurse answered.<br />
<br />
At this the heart monitor actually gave a stronger beep as though Jenny felt stronger about being completed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you stand?&quot; the nurse asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting better,&quot; Jenny spoke as she actually sat up and then collapsed into Harry&#39;s arms, &quot;but I could probably stand to have my mate&#39;s help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; the nurse commented and then looked over to Harry, &quot;sir, you will understand that in this situation you cannot be present for the completion of her transformation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as she is complete, I don&#39;t care,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;I&#39;ll anything I can to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nurse nodded and let Harry help Jenny back to her feet. Jenny&#39;s stance was rather shaky, but Harry placed one arm around her and placed his body under one of her arms. The nurse then moved around the bed to provide similar support under Jenny&#39;s other arm. They then began to make their way out into the hallway. As they passed Samantha and Frances, Frances turned to Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure Samantha gave you my card... I&#39;m Frances Twist,&quot; Frances said to her, &quot;If you ever need anyone to talk to... I&#39;m here... I&#39;d even encourage it, just to make sure that everything has worked out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Jenny nodded.<br />
<br />
They then made their way out into the hallway as Yvette was lead out into the hallway. Yvette&#39;s hands were presently handcuffed behind her for the moment and an officer had her by the arm. Behind them was Akane with stern eyes focused on rogue. After a moment she turned to look at Jenny and the Skulk leader&#39;s eye&#39;s softened.<br />
<br />
&quot;She has agreed to complete you,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;You will be complete and we won&#39;t let you die... not when there are plenty of years of happiness before you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha and Frances walked calmly up to Akane as Jenny and Yvette were helped down the hall toward the Hospital&#39;s safe room. Frances gave a curious look to Akane, as Yvette had made it clear that she didn&#39;t want to help Jenny. She wondered how Akane had gotten the rogue to actually agree with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I may ask...&quot; Frances began.<br />
<br />
&quot;How I got her to agree?&quot; Akane asked back, &quot;let us just say the threat of giving her a taste of her own medicine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha and Frances both blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t see young Jenkins go through my pain,&quot; Akane said firmly as a tear escaped her eyes, &quot;He deserves the right to have his love with him...&quot;</p>
