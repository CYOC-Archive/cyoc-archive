<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Al-Kiyudh moaned as he sat in his personal onboard massage chair. It vibrated away the day’s aches and pains. What a delightful invention!<br />
<br />
The room around him was equal to any royal chamber on an official vessel. Nay, perhaps even better, for it had ice-cold refreshments awaiting him after he used the sauna. In all his forty years of sailing, the dwarf had never been so relaxed. His hard muscles were softened and he never even noticed them diminish slightly, a layer of fat replacing what was lost. Only a pound, if that, but with it went a week of combat training and spying, replaced with a week at a culinary school.<br />
<br />
He remembered having the honor of being called upon by the Golden Caliph along with many others who were experienced in sailing, each with valuable knowledge of the water and dangers that lay within the chain of islands. Every one of them were considered some of the best in the field, their loyalty to the Caliphate unquestionable. They were mostly human, working to make their names. Al-Kiyudh frowned, something about his memory feeling off. He almost thought of himself as human, which was nonsense. He’d always been a dwarf.<br />
<br />
“I need all of you to attempt to join a new crew of adventurers. With your skills and talents you will most likely be chosen by them.” The Golden Caliph said.<br />
<br />
The Caliph was a ruggedly handsome man with a gleam of mischief in his eyes. He wore a grand golden robe that trailed behind him as he paced his grand throne room. It was clear the matter was of great importance to him. <br />
<br />
“Pah!” Mangoth-Shurabi, an orc mercenary captain and one of the few demi-humans, spat. “Why not just assemble all of us as a war fleet? We have enough experience to put an entire navy to shame. Why waste our time as lackeys on a crew that hasn’t even got their sea legs?”<br />
<br />
The Grand Caliph narrowed his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Honestly, if these were regular adventurers, I would have done just that. But these people show immense potential to save or destroy our lands.” The Golden Caliph shifted his gaze to each man in the room as he spoke, voice cold.<br />
<br />
“So you want us to kill them, right?” The orc grinned toothily. “That won’t be a problem out at sea.”<br />
<br />
“No!” The Caliph spoke sharply, making the orc flinch. “That is not what I mean at all! If they even get the notion you are deceiving them or that you pose a threat they can easily dispose of you and then come after me. At NO POINT will you attempt to harm them. You are there to observe and help them only. To be reliable and have their ear, understand what I’m saying?”<br />
<br />
“You want a spy to whisper in their ear and steer ‘em as you want.” The orc snorted. “Aye, I can parse that, Caliph.”<br />
<br />
“Be wary of the otter as well.” The Caliph remarked. “He’s capable of mind control without spells. He opens his mouth and you’d better hope it isn’t a Suggestion.”<br />
<br />
“Dangerous.” The orc nodded.<br />
<br />
“Exactly. But moreover…” The Caliph held out a platinum coin. “Do you all see this? Here, pass it around.”<br />
<br />
They all took a moment to examine the platinum coin. Everyone else looked disinterested. They were printing their own coinage, then? Illegal and executable. But Al-Kiyudh had a discerning eye. He perceived the coin was pure. No coin in the world was pure, not even gold. <br />
<br />
“It’s pure.” Al-Kiyudh spoke.<br />
<br />
“Precisely.” The Caliph smiled. “100% pure, according to my alchemists.”<br />
<br />
There were murmurs. Not even platinum coins were this pure.<br />
<br />
“However, even if they do have many of these coins, why send men undercover on their small ship?” Al-Kiyudh spoke. “Send a tax collector, not a sailor.”<br />
<br />
“Small ship, eh?” The Caliph mused. “Al-Kiyudh, you’re familiar with ship designs, correct? Most of you?”<br />
<br />
There were murmurs of assent.<br />
<br />
The Caliph threw him a copy of the blueprints. The others gathered around Al-Kiyudh to see. He opened them and stared in shock on the level of detail and advanced mechanics of it all. If even half of it worked they way they intended it to…Moreover, the parts required were small and intricately detailed, made of precious metals. To even build it would take years in order to be so precise. The ship also seemed to have multiple cannons and the ability to propel itself by the very sea water it sat upon.<br />
<br />
“By the Gods, that’s a beautiful ship!” The orc said in awe.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” The Caliph spoke from over his shoulder, making the orc jump. “And dangerous. My spies cannot get close. The magic emanating from it can rival a few of our warships.”<br />
<br />
“What would happen if they use it against us?” The orc asked.<br />
<br />
“They won’t…for now. Get ready and my Vizier will hand you communication crystals that would allow you to remotely contact me. If you manage to get in, I want daily reports on everything, including the human, kobold and otter.” The Caliph paced. “Also, lean as much of their technology as possible. Schematics and such. If you have a chance to safely gain one of their artifacts, do so.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Golden Caliph!” They said in unison.<br />
<br />
“Good. Dismissed.” The Caliph waved his hand. “And don’t disappoint me.”<br />
<br />
Al-Kiyudh went back out into the city. It seemed more lively than his last visit here. Many stores were selling fresher product or had their best items on display for any passerby to see. Perhaps they, too had heard of these strange adventurer&#39;s coins? That would explain the horrendous price gouging he was seeing.<br />
<br />
“Did you hear? That otterfolk is looking for crew mates and anyone can try to apply.” A young man in front of him was saying.<br />
<br />
Al-Kiyudh slowed his pace and eavesdropped on the conversation.<br />
<br />
“Yeah and they’re supposed to be incredibly wealthy. They throw money around here like it isn’t a problem. We might end up loaded if we join them!”<br />
<br />
He continued listening to the conversation until he bumped into the back of a rather large, bald man with a gold ring in his nose.<br />
<br />
“Sorry about that, sir.” The man said, voice rather deep. “I was, uh, listening in.”<br />
<br />
“I as well.” Al-Kiyudh smiled. “Thinking about signing up?”<br />
<br />
“Aye. You as well?”<br />
<br />
Al-Kiyudh nodded. <br />
<br />
“Well…good luck to you.” The man ambled away quickly, as though embarrassed.<br />
<br />
He made it to the harbor. Al-Kiyudh stared. There was a huge line of people, from land-lovers to veteran sailors, all of whom had heard of the vast wealth and unique ship. He even heard a few ne’er-do-wells talking about attacking them and stealing their ship. Al-Kiyudh wondered what would happen if they did that. Nothing good, if the Caliph was to be believed, and he placed a rather large amount of trust into the man.<br />
<br />
It took hours, waiting out in the hot sun, sweat dripping from his brow. Only the breeze from the port offered him any solace. Many people came in and very few left. Even the people who talked about attacking them and stealing their ship never left. Hopefully, none of them were crew. Of those who were rejected, most of them were Caliph’s chosen! Al-Kiyudh couldn’t believe his eyes. How could they deny such veterans? Or perhaps they seemed too good to be true. He’d have to be careful when he spoke to them.<br />
<br />
Once Al-Kiyudh got into the warehouse-and noticed it was covered in lead-his mouth was agape. The warehouse was well-maintained, with high grade materials and parts neatly put away in labeled containers. He saw bricks of adamantine on a desk that would be hard to even get a pound of, were he lucky. Yet he saw stacks of adamantine. The place was absolutely spotless on top of all that.<br />
<br />
The ship itself was a disappointment-at least in size. He’d expected a hundred-fifty, two-hundred foot galley. The blueprints must have been an exaggeration or…this was a prototype and the real thing was moored at some hidden port. The current ship looked as though it would fit 10 people at most. If that truly was the ship, it would likely only fit ten people and it would be a long, cramped trip.<br />
<br />
His name was finally called and he was lead into a room. A handsome otter grinned at him as he entered and bade him to take a seat. Al-Kiyudh did so, and he introduced himself as Rashid, Captain of the <I>Uzrivoy</I>. A man walked in behind them, the human, introducing himself as the First Mate Icarian. Then everything went hazy. It all sounded so pleasant, his mind just listening to whatever Rashid had to say.<br />
<br />
Time passed in a blur, and when he resumed some of his senses, he found Rashid’s glistening shaft was right before his eyes, the otter’s legs splayed lewdly open. That might have been enough to jolt him back to his senses, but the otter’s spicy musk and lovely cologne hit his nose, making his manhood achingly stiff. A gentle paw held the back of his head, lowering him towards Rashid’s drooling shaft. He couldn’t be sure if the otter told him to suck, or if he wanted to do it.<br />
<br />
The taste was strange at first, oddly sweet. The otterfolk’s small member twitched and throbbed between his lips. Focusing on the scent, he let his tongue explore and bobbed gently. The otter moaned softly at his attentions. Rashid’s soft moans were all the encouragement Al-Kiyudh needed to keep going.  After a while, he got used to the taste, even started to crave it.<br />
<br />
“I’m hardly going to have to train you at all.” Rashid chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Captain?” Al-Kiyudh paused. A shiver ran down his spine as he wondered what the otter meant by training him.<br />
<br />
“It’s how I’m hiring people. Only the best cock suckers get on my ship.” The otter’s tongue lolled as Al-Kiyudh frantically resumed bobbing. “Yeah, that’s it. This is your job interview. I Suggest you suck my dick like you mean it.”<br />
<br />
Thank the Gods he had a mouth that had sailed to every brothel in the seven seas! He sucked and bobbed, moving his mouth, deepthroating the shaft, fondling the otter’s balls. Al-Kiyudh used every trick he’d ever learned in his forty years on the sea to make a man cum on Rashid. The otter’s moans grew louder, his soft paws kneading Al-Kiyudh’s neck.<br />
<br />
Finally, the otter’s legs clutched him close and the otter gasped. His member twitched and Al-Kiyudh found himself swallowing down the otter’s rather substantial load, almost choking on it. He kept sucking, licking the otter’s meager pink shaft clean. <br />
<br />
The otter released him and he stood up, wobbling, feeling like the world was suddenly bigger around him. Al-Kiyudh licked the otter jism from his lips and stroked his long, braided beard for a moment, wondering why that seemed wrong, somehow.<br />
<br />
“You’ll be the ship’s cook.” Rashid said, panting and sagging in his seat in the afterglow.<br />
<br />
“Cook?!” Al-Kiyudh was indignant. “I’ve worked forty years-!”<br />
<br />
“You. Will. Work. As. A. Cook.” Rashid’s eyes narrowed and spoke a few words and everything grew hazy again.<br />
<br />
He woke up to the snap of the otter’s finger’s.<br />
<br />
“Al-Kiyudh?” Rashid smiled as he caught the dwarf’s attention and held out a hand. “Welcome aboard, assistant cook!”<br />
<br />
Something about that felt wrong to Al-Kiyudh, but he shook the otter’s paw anyways and stumbled away to the ship. <br />
<br />
As he walked out he saw that the line had been dispersed. There were a little over a dozen applicants who made it through the process, looking excited to join the crew. Strangely enough, they looked nothing like the applicants that had come in. All of them, save one or two, were demi-humans of some kind. To his dismay, none of the other men chosen by the Caliph had made it, just him.<br />
<br />
He stared at the assorted races, most of them rather burly, and bumped into a big wall of devilishly soft fur. Al-Kiyudh looked up and saw a minotaur, parents clearly more on the oxen side. The minotaur turned, a gold ring in his nose.<br />
<br />
“Sorry about that.” Al-Kiyudh said, eyeing the virile young minotaur.<br />
<br />
“Oh, it’s you!” The minotaur grinned, acting oddly familiar.<br />
<br />
Al-Kiyudh cocked a brow, wondering when he’d ever met a minotaur like him. “Who are you-”<br />
<br />
“Oy! Get over here you lot!” A rather large gnoll with hand-axes at his side shouted. “We’re about to start the tour!”<br />
<br />
He walked up the gangplank and entered the ship. His mouth dropped as he was given the tour. At the entrance…hall, A kobold was waiting for them, wearing a metallic dragonborn suit that looked incredibly realistic. If he saw it at a distance, Al-Kiyudh wasn’t sure he’d be able to tell it apart from the real thing.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to my husband’s ship, my name is Sulpu. The gnoll you just met was Gnuz. We have chosen all of you based on your…skills. And how we believe you can help us.” Speakers in the robotic dragonborn’s mouth said.<br />
<br />
They traveled the ship. Many small, robotic kobold were working around the ship doing multiple jobs that would normally require a ton of manpower. Now wonder why the crew recruitment was for so few positions!<br />
<br />
A few of the robotic kobolds appeared…vaguely familiar. Al-Kiyudh thought he recognized a few tattoo-like paintings on their arms and torsos. Not Crimson Corsair. Actually, the man who stood in front of him in the line, the young man with no experience whatsoever, had a tattoo like one of the robot kobolds that were cleaning. <br />
<br />
Very peculiar.<br />
<br />
The inside of the ship was massive compared to the outside and all of it was well-lit with a soft white light that came from alcoves in the ceiling and along the walls. Al-Kiyudh couldn’t actually imagine how big the ship truly must have been. It was almost as if…as if they had needed more space and simply added more rooms. They walked down some stairs and down a corridor and the dwarf caught a whiff of a barnyard stench.<br />
<br />
They entered a huge room filled with stacks of hay and plants in pots on one side of the room and animal pens on the other. Cows, chickens, pig, and riding lizards were kept in neat, clean pens covered in fresh straw. They would have fresh dairy and eggs every day, from the looks of it. The potted plants were filled with fruit trees, ensuring they would have citrus to keep the scurvy away.<br />
<br />
The group walked past the pens and into the galley. The kitchen had completely high-tech items he vaguely understood the use thereof. A few big boxes kept things inside of them cold or permanently frozen without any spells. There was an oven and stove-top that heated food without any wood. They were, each and every one, marvels of engineering.<br />
<br />
“Right, so a few of you haven’t been assigned a job. If you have, I’m going to remind you.” The Kobold said.<br />
<br />
The armored kobold assigned each one of the crew a job. The two humans, both burly, bearded men covered in tattoos, were chosen as lookouts. Two bugbears were assigned stock and inventory management. Four orcs were placed on moving crates. The ogre would manage the armory, keeping everything in working order. Two satyrs were assigned to the animal pens. Lastly, he assigned the minotaur and Al-Kiyudh to galley duty.<br />
<br />
“Sir, why do you even need us? It looks like you have a crew yourself.” The minotaur pointed at the small kobold drones.<br />
<br />
“As Captain Rashid always says, you need a crew who will have your back. Ones who will help you make the correct decisions when needed.” Sulpu’s speakers crackled. “Sorry, my speakers are on the fritz. Obviously, the drones can’t really do much when it comes to combat. Yet. Anyways, follow me to your rooms.”<br />
<br />
They all followed the metal dragonborn as he walked around the ship. They paused at a small game room, filled with board-games and a strange scrying screen with colorful images playing on it. Rashid was playing chess with an older half-orc. He saw them and hopped out of his chair and scurried up into the Dragonborn’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Hello all!” Captain Rashid said from his perch on the metal dragonborn. “Have you shown them…everything yet?”<br />
<br />
“You want to do that today?” The kobold asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, why not.” The otterfolk smiled.<br />
<br />
Next to the game room was a gym filled with lots of workout equipment. Even here, some of the equipment had those same strange tattoo-like paintings on them, recognizable from the people who were standing in line. Had they painted them on it and left?<br />
<br />
The air in the gym had an odd, musky aroma that made Al-Kiyudh’s cock stir in his pants. It filled him with an odd energy. Music was being pipped in from some hidden speaker. It wasn’t anything like the music Al-Kiyudh knew, something foreign, but he couldn’t deny it made him feel pumped. A half-gnoll, half-giant was over in one corner lifting a heavy bar covered in enormous weights-possibly 500 pounds, judging by the numbers.<br />
<br />
“Hey newbies!” The half-giant grunted, muzzle curled in a snarl. He was wearing incredibly tight pants that displayed a very prominent bulge at the crotch that would make most male concubines blush. “One of you wanna lift with me?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, me.” The ogre said, taking off his shirt, displaying scars and tattoos across his heavily muscled torso. <br />
<br />
The heavily muscled ogre took the half-giant’s place on the bench and started to lift weights. They all watched as the giant pressed his face next to the ogre’s sizeable bulge, snuffling and nuzzling the increasing stiff bulge. The ogre couldn’t stop blushing, squirming as the half-giant’s tongue began to lap at his sack.<br />
<br />
Everyone had to adjust themselves as they watched the scene play out. The half-giant pulled the ogre’s pants down, the ogre hard, stein-thick shift springing erect. Then the half-giant began to-<br />
<br />
“Oy!” The otter clapped his hands, getting everyone’s attention. “Shall we go on?”<br />
<br />
They shuffled behind the otter, leaving the gym-and the lusty moans and wet slapping sounds-behind. The group passed back down and through the stable areas again. Al-Kiyudh still couldn’t get over how many animals they had…and the strange markings some of them bore. All of the animals were health.<br />
<br />
“This is where we get our fresh milk and eggs.” Rashid said. <br />
<br />
“I told them that.” Sulpu spoke.<br />
<br />
“I want to make sure they understand. It’s kind of a group effort, taking care of them. Make sure they have food and water if you see a trough empty. I Suggest you treat them like pets.”<br />
<br />
The group shuddered. The animals somehow looked cuter and more lovable to them, now. Al-Kiyudh watched as one of the humans who had, originally, been reluctant to approach the lizards, walked towards one. Riding lizards were strong and dangerous when someone they didn’t know handled them. And yet, Al-Kiyudh watched as the timid man held his hand out and the lizard…pressed his snout into it.<br />
<br />
“Aww, they’re so cute!” Al-Kiyudh found himself gushing, getting closer to the lizards himself.<br />
<br />
They were calm and acted a lot like a dog, wagging its tail as he approached and nuzzled into his hands, giving off strange sounds and grunts of pleasure and he scratched under its chin. He couldn’t help but notice that all of them had a mark that looked distressingly similar to the Crimson Corsairs somewhere on their bodies.<br />
<br />
“I think I’ll call this one Bessie.” One of the Bugbears said, rubbing a nearby cow’s head and scritching the base of its horns.<br />
<br />
“Alright, that’s enough.” Rashid spoke. “I believe that Minos and Alky are working in the galley?”<br />
<br />
“It’s Aziz.” The minotaur said.<br />
<br />
“I’m Al-Kiyudh.” the dwarf chimed in.<br />
<br />
“I Suggest that you accept your new nicknames.” Rashid said.<br />
<br />
The two shuddered.<br />
<br />
“Where was I?” The otter mused. “Oh right, the galley! Follow me.”<br />
<br />
The otter took them back into the kitchen. He explained in painstaking detail all the utensils, the recipe books, systems of measurement. What fridges were, what a microwave was. All of it was rather a lot to take in at once.<br />
<br />
The traveled lower, to the decks just above the engine compartments. Many rooms lined the hall. The doors were well-decorated and on them, instead of locks, were number pads with buttons one them.<br />
<br />
“These are your rooms. Each one is filled with things I recommend to help make this journey safe and enjoyable. If you need anything else added to your room, just ask. There is a working bathroom, a big bed, books, and some kinky stuff if you want to pass the time.” Sulpu said, then showed them how their pass-codes worked, making sure it would only open the door when pressed in sequence.<br />
<br />
No one could believe what they saw in the room once it was opened. It was incredibly fancy, with a huge canopy bed that made it seem like a captain’s quarters. Bookshelves lined the walls. The bed, centerpiece of the room, was big enough to fit multiple people and was made with clean, fresh sheets. There was a desk along one wall with a quill pen. At the side of the bed was an ornate dresser. In one corner of the room was a big chair.<br />
<br />
“That’s a massage chair.” Sulpu spoke, making the dwarf jump.<br />
<br />
“What, is this your room?” Minos said.<br />
<br />
“No, this is what all of your rooms look like. Everything here is for your comfort. It even has accommodations I think everyone should have…even though ‘someone would rather not’ have them.” Sulpu said cryptically.<br />
<br />
“Who?” Alky asked. And blinked. Was that his name?<br />
<br />
“Nothing, forget I said anything. Anyways, we also have an onboard armory and workshop. If you need to use it, please inform us and put in a time and we will get you the materials and deduct the costs from your hourly pay.”<br />
<br />
“Hourly?!” They all said in unison.<br />
<br />
Sulpu and Rashid looked at each other in confusion.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you all get three gold coins for every hour you work on the ship. It’s 10-12 hour shifts with one day off. We pay you during lunch and dinner break as well.” Rashid said.<br />
<br />
Alky was floored at how well-paid they were all going to be. With that much gold…he did some calculations…he could buy a villa in the noble’s quarters along with rich merchants. So long as he continued sailing with them. To put it in layman’s terms, he was paid 3 gold per WEEK working for a noble.<br />
<br />
“Uh, why are you doing so much for us?” Minos asked.<br />
<br />
Everyone glared at him angrily.<br />
<br />
“Great question!” Rashid grinned. “It’s called loyalty. We are going to be with each other for a very long time. I want all of you to feel comfortable. It wouldn’t be fair if we didn’t share all the perks with you.” The otter winked.<br />
<br />
The tension in the room lessened. Everyone felt much more relaxed. Thus far, Al-Kiyudh hadn’t noticed any criminal activities and he was sure that was the exact line of thought the others had. These adventurers must be incredibly powerful. Journeying with them was an opportunity of a lifetime!<br />
<br />
“Now,” The otter clapped. “Choose your rooms!”<br />
<br />
Everyone rushed to a room. The kobold went in, individually, and showed them how the bathroom fixtures worked and the music system. Al-Kiyudh chose to stay with the room they already opened, the one with the massage chair. When he told the kobold that, the otter on his shoulder grinned.<br />
<br />
“I guessed you’d say that.” The otter hummed happily. “Go ahead and try out the massage chair when you’re done showering. I made it just for you.”<br />
<br />
“Uh..thanks, captain!” Alky saluted sharply.<br />
<br />
“None of that, thanks. You guys are going to get new clothes. Here, write down some design that will fit you. It’s hot outside, so we’re going with white linen as the cloth. Very breathable.”<br />
<br />
“A uniform?” The dwarf asked.<br />
<br />
“Yep.” The otter grinned confidently. “It should be done by the time you shower. Wear that. You’ll have the rest of the day to do whatever you want. We leave port in the morning.”<br />
<br />
The dwarf jotted something down and handed it to the otter. The otter smiled and left. <br />
<br />
Al-Kiyudh closed the door and sighed. Somehow, he’d managed to keep his composure. The Caliph was counting on him to understand all the inner workings of the ship. He checked the music system and some of the oddly soothing music that reminded him of the strange tunes from the gym began to play.<br />
<br />
He got in the shower and gasped as the warm water washed over his squat, hairy body. The shampoo and conditioner and beard conditioner were all there for him. He performed his ablutions and toweled off. There was a knock at his door. He strode over and opened it, and found a neat uniform, perfectly tailored to his specifications, folded in front of his door.<br />
<br />
The dwarf pulled on his lightweight, breathable uniform, admiring the trim and professional design. He remembered what the otter had said…something about the massage chair in the corner. Al-Kiyudh sat in the chair and turned it on and OH GODS it felt amazing.<br />
<br />
And so that’s where he found himself vibrating pleasantly on a cloud of bliss, contemplating his journey thus far. He gave another happy sigh when a knock rang out from the hall. The dwarf turned off the chair and opened the door. <br />
<br />
Minos stood there, chest fur ruffed, his uniform appeared to be a simple pair of shorts that left very little to the imagination. Besides him stood Rashid, the otter idly cleaning his nails. Al-Kiyudh looked from one to the other.<br />
<br />
“Can I help you?” The dwarf asked.<br />
<br />
“Hey…I guess we’re roommates, or something?” The minotaur’s tail wagged behind him as he twiddled his fingers.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, turns out we just don’t quite have enough rooms!” The otter feigned surprise. “Oops!”<br />
<br />
“But I only have one bed.” Al-Kiyudh said flatly.<br />
<br />
“What? Now way!” The otter smirked. “I Suggest you two sleep together in every sense of the word.”<br />
<br />
Al-Kiyudh shuddered and shook his head. “Uh, sure. Come on in, Minos.”<br />
<br />
The otter smirked and left, whistling a tune. Minos walked past Al-Kiyudh, his heavy musk wafting off of him, making the dwarf’s dick hard. The minotaur sat on the bed and it managed to support his weight. The dwarf closed the door and walked over to the desk, trying not to think about how sexy the oxen-like minotaur was.<br />
<br />
“Hey, um, I have to ask. How do you deal with all the travel?” The minotaur asked, placing his hands behind his horns, muscles flexing and bulging, and spreading more of that heavy barnyard musk into the room.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” The dwarf said, unable to wrench his eyes away from the minotaur’s gorgeous body.<br />
<br />
“I mean, you’ve been on ships before. How do you deal with boredom?”<br />
<br />
“On our ships, we have many ways to pass time, but my favorite way is to have sex.” The dwarf blurted out.<br />
<br />
“Isn’t that gay? I mean, I’m gay, but most people are straight.” The minotaur said, becoming more interested.<br />
<br />
“When the last woman you see is a month away, your taste in partners becomes…more diverse.” The dwarf adjusted himself.<br />
<br />
“Oh. Well then, maybe you can…pass time with me.” Minos said, ears waggling cutely.<br />
<br />
The music in the air became…vaguely sexual. Al-Kiyudh blinked, feeling his heart-rate rise, cock achingly hard. He’d never been this turned on in his life!<br />
<br />
“You’re a young bull. Are you sure you don’t want to pass time with other men on the ship?”<br />
<br />
“I’m looking for someone who likes a power bottom.” The minotaur said eagerly. “Are you interested?”<br />
<br />
“Are you okay with this? I’m an older guy.”<br />
<br />
“And short! I like that. I wanna get plowed and filled by a smaller guy.” Minos said, getting on his hands and knees and pulling down his shorts, revealing his hot, musky pucker. “Ready to ride me?”<br />
<br />
Al-Kiyudh licked his lips and lunged forward. He gripped the minotaur’s wide hips and swabbed his lower deck with his cock. The bull’s pucker winked and slick fluid spilled from the hole as he teased his cock around it. Then, with a gasp of pleasure, his cock slipped right into that black donut. Minos shuddered below him as the dwarf slid in a few inches into his squishy hole.<br />
<br />
The dwarf reached around and grabbed the bull’s hefty cock. Al-Kiyudh thrust and slid back and forth, sawing into the minotaur’s tensing depths. The bull’s cock was wonderfully fat, he almost couldn’t get his hand around it. He started to tug and pull on it, savoring its girth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ready to be milked, my sexy bull?&quot; Al-Kiyudh asked.<br />
<br />
Minos let out a moaning moo and tossed his hips back and forth, bucking between the cock in his ass and the hand on his cock. The bull was snorting and huffing, clearly loving every second. Alky built up speed, going fast and harder. <br />
<br />
“Fuck me harder!” The bull demanded, clenching around the dwarf’s stout cock.<br />
<br />
Al-Kiyudh snarled and thrust harder, balls slapping balls, the bull’s cheeks rippling with every thrust and buck. He couldn’t hold back, the pleasure growing too much for him. His heavy, hairy balls tugged up just before his cock throbbed and pulsed and cum gushed into Minos’ ass.<br />
<br />
The bull mooed and came as well, the warm wetness of the dwarf too much for him to bear. Thick ropes of semen splattered across the fresh sheets on the bed. The dwarf continued thrusting, miling the bull beneath him for all he was worth. He churned his cum in deep into the minotaur before he came for a second time, then sagged on the furry bull’s back, exhausted.<br />
<br />
He basked in the after glow. The minotaur below him started snoring and he carefully pulled out.<br />
<br />
After helping the minotaur ‘find his sea legs’ so to speak, the dwarf went to the bathroom to wash up. He cleaned off his cock and balls and walked back into the bedroom. The sleeping, furry giant still lay there, he wasn’t dreaming, and the gods of homosexuality clearly smiled upon him today. The minotaur snored lightly, flaccid cock still leaking precum.<br />
<br />
He grinned and poked around the room, looking for something to read. Most of his journeys, he rarely even got a hammock, let alone a whole room! There were some strange, colorful books with pictures in them, one of them about a pirate that could stretch his body. The first book looked like a good place to start.<br />
<br />
As he was about to open the book, he saw a glow out of the corner of his eye, coming from his discarded pants. Al-Kiyudh’s face went from relaxed to panicked as he realized he needed to give his daily report. He looked around the room. How the hell would he even explain any of this to the Golden Caliph?!<br />
<br />
The dwarf scrambled to put his clothes on, the sounds of him hurrying stirring the minotaur awake.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm, is everything alright?” The minotaur said groggily, his dick growing erect as he watched the dwarf dress.<br />
<br />
“Oh, the captain just forgot to tell me a few things. I’m going to see him and be back in a few, okay?” The dwarf said, hiding the glowing stone behind his body.<br />
<br />
“Alright. When you’re finished, I think I’m ready for round two.” The minotaur grinned.<br />
<br />
“Same here, friend.” The dwarf smiled.<br />
<br />
“Actually,&quot; the minotaur hoisted himself to his hoofs. “I think I’ll use that massage chair. It works, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, sure, go ahead. I gotta go.” The dwarf stuffed the stone in his pocket and rushed off.<br />
<br />
He closed the door behind him just as the minotaur sat in the massage chair and turned it on. Trying to find a place to be alone was going to be a problem. The kobold drones were everywhere. He found solace at the stern of the ship.<br />
<br />
Al-Kiyudh answered his crystal. It glowed in anticipation and he spoke the code-word into it. A small hologram appeared in the air above it, showing the Caliph in full regalia. It appeared that he was in his personal chambers.<br />
<br />
“Al-Kiyudh, it pleases me to hear from you. I feared they had found you out and killed you.” The Caliph spoke.<br />
<br />
“No, Caliph, I was simply preoccupied with my assigned duties.”<br />
<br />
“Understandable. The ship appears to be calmer than normal. Are you anchored?”<br />
<br />
“No, we’re moving very fast, Caliph. The boat is incredibly stable. We’ve been appointed rooms with incredible accommodation.”<br />
<br />
“Can you tell me more about the accommodation in full detail?”<br />
<br />
He wanted to tell the Caliph everything about the ship. About the advanced tech that would be a grand advancement for their country were it to be known. But every time he tried to force the words from his throat, he fell silent. Even thinking about telling the Caliph made him feel like his balls were being squeezed in a  vice.<br />
<br />
“I…cannot.”<br />
<br />
“You felt a strong sense of pain trying to tell me, right?” The Caliph asked, staring at him.<br />
<br />
Al-Kiyudh could only nod.<br />
<br />
“Fine. It appears the otter pulled out all the stops to keep their secrets from prying eyes.” The Caliph stroked his beard. “Any changes with the group? Anything about the human’s power?”<br />
<br />
“No sir.” Al-Kiyudh said, surprised he could even answer. “He hasn’t shown any powers yet, but the guns at his hips are artifacts based purely on the rare metal they are made from.”<br />
<br />
“And the crew? Only you were chosen out of all my men. My spies tell me the people they did choose weren’t as skilled as any of you combined.”<br />
<br />
“No idea. They treat us all well.” The dwarf rubbed the back of his head. “I may have to stay off the radar for now. It’s too risky to call you everyday. They have…eyes everywhere.”<br />
<br />
“How did they manage to fit a hundred people into that ship?” The Caliph asked.<br />
<br />
“Caliph?”<br />
<br />
“They chose everyone except my people. There were almost a hundred people in that line.”<br />
<br />
“There’s only fifteen of us chosen as crew, oh Caliph.” The dwarf replied, confused.<br />
<br />
There was a pause. <br />
<br />
“Fine. Keep doing what you are doing. But be on your toes. Many people who are investigating them or are known Crimson Corsairs went missing. I heard they applied to be members of the crew.”<br />
<br />
“Did you find the bodies?”<br />
<br />
“No, that...might not be possible. There were no bodies or scents of blood around the warehouse. However, we did detect incredible Transmutation magic. Anything odd or out of place may be…well, one of the missing people.”<br />
<br />
Al-Kiyudh stared, remembering the strange markings on the animals and equipment and shuddered.<br />
<br />
“Aye sir.” He hung up.<br />
<br />
The dwarf stared down at the dark crystal and out across the ship’s deck. He sat down, feeling the ocean spray on his skin. Suddenly, he was very worried. How many times had he felt odd during the tour, or during all his interactions with the adventurers? Had something about him been changed?<br />
<br />
He stood up and headed back inside. The main mess hall was lively with many of the crew including the original seven adventurers. They were relaxed and eating a strange meal of noodles and a tomato and ground beef sauce. Minos ladled up another plate and smiled up at him as the dwarf walked in. Rashid waved for him to come in.<br />
<br />
“Everything okay?” The otter smirked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Captain.” The dwarf said.<br />
<br />
“I Suggest you relax in that massage chair whenever you can.” Rashid said.<br />
<br />
The dwarf shuddered  and nodded. “It is good.”<br />
<br />
“You’ll feel right at home in no time, I promise.” The otter smiled.<br />
<br />
“Here you go!” Minos said, ladling noddles and sauce onto his place. “And this is a ‘carbonated beverage’.” The Minotaur poured him a strange, sweet, fizzy drink.<br />
<br />
The dwarf felt reluctant at first, but after a few tastes, dug in.</p>
