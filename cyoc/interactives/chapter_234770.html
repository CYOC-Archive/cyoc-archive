<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up 2 hours later than David. My eyes unable to open, still feeling tired and dreading of getting out, feeling that I haven&#39;t slept for days. &quot;Wait, what if David hasn&#39;t slept for days?&quot; I mumbled quietly. I hear the heart-rate-monitor as the scientist comes to me. &quot;There, you&#39;re awake now.&quot; I try get up but I&#39;m too weak to even lift up a finger. &quot;I can tell that you are trying to get up, but David- I mean, now Sam, probably drank and got hungover last night but it was easy to tell because of his breath pre-surgery...&quot; the scientist murmured. &quot;What?&quot; I said, louder and clearer. I get a shock from the deep voice and I sit up. &quot;Surprising after you were hungover...&quot; the scientist pointed. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; I asked. &quot;Nothing for you to know.&quot; he answered quickly and then changed the subject. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now here are a few points.&quot;<br />
&quot;You will have David&#39;s muscle memory and some of his past and core memories which that means you will pretty get used to and to behave what he normally does all the time.&quot; he passes me a plate of salmon and rice; which I dread. But did I really dread it? It doesn&#39;t look nasty the more I look at it, and it is high in protein. Which I would never think of normally, but that scientist was correct. I did behave like him as well. Having a high protein diet and less carbs and more vegetables and... jeez I do remember some of his memories.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, try it.&quot; the scientist said. So I tried it, ate it all up in a minute. I was hungry, and I didn&#39;t even think of one bad thing of this meal. It was in fact not bad, that it was actually great! I wanted more of these dishes. How did I not like this before? I drank the last bit of my water then stood up. Woah, I felt taller. And stronger. &quot;I&#39;ll leave it to you. The best way to get used to your body is letting your scientist let you be. But also because it&#39;s one o-clock and I really need my chicken sandwich.&quot; he said and left the room to me. &quot;By the way, when you&#39;re ready your family will be waiting outside for you. But don&#39;t take too long! David- I keep mixing it up, Sam is not really enjoying his new appearance.&quot; he added before he popped out.<br />
<br />
I take off one of my hospital-gown and also take off David&#39;s weird Adidas shirt. Which I don&#39;t wear because I usually wear H&M.<br />
It smelt funny. He smelt funny. Wear was it coming from? From there?! Not my armpits? Oh jeez I forgot this would happen. And why is it so hairy. Why is everything have hair?? I mean there, and my stomach... and my legs and a tiny bit under my nose... jeez I can&#39;t wait to turn back into my old self, which is in... never. But hopefully, in a few weeks Larry can change us all back and we can go do our own stuff. He looks down to see a huge bulge on his pelvis. And everyone in the waiting room could hear, &quot;There&#39;s hair over here too?!&quot; Sam [Originally David] feels a bit embarrassed and wished his stupid brother to shut up.<br />
<br />
I decided to leave the room, wait. Not naked. So I wear the black, smelly Adidas shirt and my shorts and I look at the mirror again. I felt strong but, the fat on my Belly couldn&#39;t show the abs. I guess I&#39;ll have to go to the gym later. I exited the room and expected my mom to hug me and be like, &quot;Oh Sam you&#39;re fine!&quot; and give me kisses and hug me. But instead she was more focused on David, making sure he&#39;s fine and entertained, and he was actually enjoying it. She saw me and told me that we were going to go into the car and I replied, &quot;Okay.&quot; which I got a small shock to because of my deep voice. I repeat what I said but how David would usually talk.<br />
<br />
At the car, I sat beside David, who was sitting in the middle. Which is weird, because it&#39;s usually the opposite. We do have each others muscle memories. I ask him, &quot;How&#39;s your new body? Sam.&quot; He looks at me and gives me a look. &quot;Don&#39;t call me Sam you ogre.&quot; he called me an ogre? That&#39;s what I do! &quot;Wait why did I say ogre? I didn&#39;t mean to say that on-purpose... what&#39;s going on?&quot; he asked in his new baby-ish high voice.<br />
&quot;Larry,&quot; I answered. &quot;Who&#39;s Larry?&quot; he asked. &quot;Larry, the scientist. He said that we would do what the other person would do: Actions, behaviours, and more.&quot; &quot;So that&#39;s why I said, &#39;ogre&#39;.&quot; David said. And the car stopped at our house. &quot;We&#39;re here!&quot; mom told us, and opened David&#39;s door from his side, which is what mom usually does to me; but she&#39;s treating us like the opposite. Probably because we&#39;ve swapped bodies but yeah... But the more I kept thinking that I wanted hugs and kisses from mom, I felt like I was too old for them.<br />
<br />
So I opened my own door and we went inside to go to our rooms and we ended up in each other&#39;s sub-consciously. I look in the mirror. So what? It&#39;s gonna be my body for probably my whole life now. So I take off my shirt, pants and underwear. I try flex my muscles a bit. At least there was a lot hiding underneath my fat. I take a sniff of my armpit again and it smelt a bit nasty but good? I never had armpit hair, or sweat so much in my old body. Actually there wasn&#39;t that much body hair, comparing to dad. There was just hair under my belly button, armpits, junk... and a tiny one growing under my nose. It felt a bit funny. And it tickled a lot; so much that I laughed in a deep voice which sounded weird to me so I stopped. <br />
<br />
I wanted to talk to Sam, which is what I decided to call David now. Since I&#39;m in his body and that we&#39;re probably going to stay like this for a long time. I went to my old room&#39;s door, I was going to knock until Mom called us for dinner. It&#39;s usually at 6 or 7PM but since I woke up 2 hours late post-surgery, dinner was at nine. I hear Sam&#39;s voice say &quot;coming!&quot; in my old voice, which I didn&#39;t miss at all. It was really high for my age and loads of my classmates had slightly deeper voices which made me feel like &quot;the ugly duckling.&quot; I hear his footsteps so I hide quickly into the bathroom. It was 10 metres away so thanks to my new tall, kind-of-strong body I was able to get there before Sam opened the door. He went downstairs so I decided to come as well, but I saw something on my old bed. It was my unitard?  That thing was deep in my closet and Sam was able to find it and it looked like he wore it too. I shout &quot;coming!&quot; as well but in a deeper than David&#39;s usual voice. <br />
<br />
I go to the dining room and choose where to sit. I decide to sit beside Sam, so I could go talk to him. Which is what I thought. He ignored me when I started tapping him or calling his name but I think he answered when he kept hearing his old voice. What should I say to him?</p>
