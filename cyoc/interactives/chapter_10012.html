<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian entered the tavern, scantily clad.  Well, scantily clad for an elf.  They tended to have different ideas about what scantily meant.  Humans didn’t seem to notice that elf women showing less than human women were, for them, showing more than they should.  However, that mattered not.  Brian could seduce the paladin wearing monks robes with the skill he now possessed.  <br />
<br />
Brian was the very essence of feminine grace and elfish beauty.  His moves and gestures inherited from Kral and those from Kral’s master and his master’s master and so on down the long line of doppelg&auml;nger sires.  Centuries of experience passed on through the melding with his beloved master; skills and customs of art, religion, magic, war and theft.  Killing a doppelg&auml;nger was like destroying a library.  Brian knew and saw histories of long dead peoples.  Knowledge none but perhaps the elves still retained.  What his master had done to him was give him a gift, one that he gladly would repay with his thralldom and Sir Tomas would share in this too, when Brian had accomplished his task.<br />
<br />
Brian wished beyond all things to please his master.<br />
<br />
Brian scanned the common room and in one corner Brian found his prey.  It appeared the burly paladin had just sat down to eat a hearty meal.  Brian saw the great mountain of a man piously giving thanks for his meal.  Sir Thomas’ manners were well practiced, his thick red beard neatly trimmed and groomed, his attire immaculate, his holy symbol of highly polished silver on his barreled chest.  Brian saw the man lift a goblet of water to his lips and in looking about the room saw Brian.  Brian could see the fire in the man’s eyes and knew he would enjoy this exceptionally hearty male’s sex; then he would enjoy watching his master claim him, draining him of his seed and then filling him full again.  Perhaps his master would allow him to fill Sir Thomas’ belly with his own seed as his master filled the Paladin’s ass.<br />
<br />
It would be so wonderful to participate in the process of transforming this awesome beast into one of their own.  Searching his memories, Brian knew that Kral granted such pleasures to thralls that served him well.<br />
<br />
Brian pulled a harp from the soft leather case Kral had given him and found a seat by the fire.  Brian knew a multitude of skills now and volumes of song.  Kral had enthralled an elfish harper centuries ago and the music that played in Brian’s head as he tuned the harp was both beautiful and ancient.  Brian began low and slowly, not looking at his prey, but he could tell Sir Tomas’ interest in him had increased threefold as he began a soft, bittersweet lament in antique elfish.<br />
<br />
The song grabbed the attention of all who heard it but it riveted Sir Tomas and as the song grew to crescendo, Brian looked deeply into the paladin’s eyes and sung the words “… ‘tis you alone I cry for.  You’re voice I seek here under the stars.”<br />
<br />
Of course, Sir Tomas, not speaking antique elfish only caught part of the meaning.  But enough of the words of modern elfish matched that he knew what the beautiful elf harper meant.<br />
<br />
As the song ended, the tavern roared with applause.  Brian demurely bowed from his seat and once again looked over at Sir Tomas.  The man was on his feet, roaring like the rest and Brian noticed the lump that had appeared at the front of his pants.  <br />
<br />
“Success!”  Brian thought.  “He is both charmed and aroused.”<br />
<br />
Coins were placed in a bowl and put at Brian’s feet.<br />
<br />
After an hour of singing, Brian ended his performance to standing ovation.  The bowl was full of silver and gold.<br />
<br />
He picked up the bowl and approached Sir Tomas.  Brian withdrew three sliver and one gold from the heaped bowl and then lifted it to the huge man before him.<br />
<br />
Holding the bowl out to the paladin, Brian said, “Please, give this to those of poor fortune.  I only take what I need, such is my pledge.”<br />
<br />
The paladin’s eyes grew misty with tears and he spoke in his deep bass, “Thou are as kind as thou art beautiful, m’ lady.  These coins shall provide food and warmth for orphans and widows.”<br />
<br />
Brian’s eyes sparkled with delight and a winsome smile touched his lips.<br />
<br />
“You are too kind, good Sir knight.”  Brian could feel the man melt in his gaze.  Sir Tomas took out a large leather pouch with the holy symbol that matched the one on his medallion tooled into the leather and emptied the coins into the pouch.<br />
<br />
“Prithee, m’ lady, if I may be so bold; what dost thou call thyself?”  Sir Tomas asked.<br />
<br />
“I am Arwyllen of the Silver Strings, a poor harper.”<br />
<br />
“I am Sir Tomas of Greyford and I am at your service.”  The paladin said with pride in his voice.<br />
<br />
Brian notice that the knight’s cock had increased in size by about half again and was sure the monster in the man’s pants was now its full size.<br />
<br />
“I thank you, good Sir Tomas and ask a small boon.”  Brian said and he could see the knight almost drool.<br />
<br />
“Anything within my power that is right and proper, m’ lady, is yours.”  Sir Tomas said and Brian noticed a wet spot at the top of that huge lump in the man’s pants.<br />
<br />
“Could you tell me if this inn is reputable and safe?  I have no place to stay in this town and I am considering staying here in the rooms above.”  Brian said and could feel the hooks of seduction sinking deeper into Sir Tomas.  This was fun, the best of sports!  He had no idea how much fun luring a man could be.<br />
<br />
“M’ lady, this tavern is very reputable and safe indeed.  However, if you fear for your safety, perhaps a room close to mine own wouldst salve thy troubled mind.”  Sir Tomas offered.<br />
<br />
“Indeed it would!  An excellent suggestion good Sir knight!”  Brian said as he mentally began reeling the paladin in.<br />
<br />
Brian arranged for a room across the hall from Sir Tomas on the third floor and with Sir Tomas as escort, made his way to the apartments above.</p>
