<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joe wakes up slowly, feeling the weight of his new reality pressing down on him. He runs his hand over the fur of his abs, feeling the muscles beneath, and swings his legs over the side of the bed, cupping his massive cock as he stands. The room is unchanged from the night before, except for the faint scent of ancient Egypt. He slips into a pair of gold-trimmed boxers and a white T-shirt that stretches tightly over his broad chest, adorned with the image of Anubis&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
His scent was musk and power, a potent mix that filled the room. Joe took a deep breath, savoring the newness of his form. The fur covering his body was surprisingly soft to the touch, and his muscles rippled beneath it with every movement. He stretched his arms out wide, feeling the strength that now coursed through them. His tail swished back and forth, the tip brushing against the gold trimming of his boxers, sending a delightful shiver up his spine. His new body felt like a second skin that he had been born to wear. He looked down at his paws, flexing the powerful digits, feeling the strength in his grip. His eyes sparkled with excitement and anticipation for what the day would bring.<br />
<br />
He stepped into the hallway and was shocked to find it transformed. The walls were now adorned with gold trimming and hieroglyphs telling tales of Anubis, the god of mummification. Each light fixture had morphed into the fiery eyes of the jackal-headed god, casting an eerie glow upon the corridor. The window at the end of the hall had become a stunning stained-glass depiction of Anubis, with his flexing, bare-chested form and a tail that swished with power. The curtains had turned into fine Egyptian silk, with gold threads weaving through the fabric. Even the light switches had been replaced with gold-plated replicas of his new form. The lower jaws act as the switch.<br />
<br />
Joe felt a thrill of excitement and a power surge through him as he descended the grand staircase, which had become a monument to his transformation. Each step was a gleaming slab of marble, and the banisters were now sculptures of jackal heads, with eyes that seemed to follow him as he moved. At the bottom, a colossal statue of Anubis loomed over the new living room; however, it was smaller than him at only 15 feet tall, and Joe couldn&#39;t help but feel a smug sense of superiority. The room was vast and open, with a couch that could easily accommodate his towering frame. The TV was now an elaborate golden frame, with a screen at least fifty inches wide.<br />
<br />
The floor of the living room had changed into a mosaic, depicting the Nile River with all its creatures. He could see fish, crocodiles, and hippos frolicking in the waters, all made from small pieces of gleaming stone. The walls were stone, but the ceiling was a deep blue, with golden stars scattered across it like the night sky above the desert. Above the couch, a massive fan made of ostrich feathers lazily spun, offering a gentle breeze.<br />
<br />
Joe looked down at his new form, his paws flexing slightly on the cool stone floor. He wasn&#39;t Anubis, not truly. But he was something new, something powerful. His legs were like tree trunks, covered in sleek fur that shimmered in the dim light. His chest was broad and muscular, and his arms ended in sharp claws. His cock, still hard from his earlier transformation, lay thick and proud between his legs, a stark contrast to the elegant art that surrounded him. He was a creature of power and strength.<br />
<br />
The smell of breakfast filled the air, making his stomach rumble. The kitchen had undergone a similar transformation, with gold counters and gleaming copper pots hanging from the ceiling. A massive fridge, adorned with carvings of the Nile, hummed quietly in the corner. He stops when he sees a seven-foot jackal anthro cooking breakfast. &quot;Good morning, master Joe, your breakfast is almost ready.&quot; The jackal said with a deep bow, his fur sleek and a deep brown with a brown underbelly. He wore a simple loincloth of fine white linen and a gold necklace with a single emerald.<br />
<br />
Not knowing who this was, Joe asked, &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The jackal looked up from the stove, his eyes wide with surprise. &quot;I am Seth, your devoted servant, created from your very essence and transformed by your power.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe&#39;s mind reeled, trying to make sense of the bizarre situation. &quot;But where&#39;s my mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seth paused in his cooking, his tail swishing thoughtfully. &quot;Ah, the woman you knew as your mother has been transformed as well. She is now a part of me, a servant in your new form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe&#39;s jaw dropped, his eyes widening in shock. &quot;What the... no, you can&#39;t be serious!&quot;<br />
<br />
Seth nodded solemnly. &quot;I am your mother, Susan. However, I prefer my new form so I can serve you better.&quot; He paused, then added, &quot;But fear not, I retain all her memories and knowledge. I am still your mother in essence, but now in a more... obedient form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe was stunned, his mind racing. He looked down at Seth, trying to reconcile the image of his mother with the jackal before him. The creature&#39;s eyes held an eerily familiar warmth. &quot;But why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seth looked up, his expression calm and submissive. &quot;Master, the transformation was necessary to align my being with your divine essence. Your mother&#39;s spirit lives within me, but now I am tailored to serve your needs, to cater to your every whim.&quot; He paused, then added, &quot;And I must admit, I find this form... appealing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe nodded, still trying to absorb everything. He watched as Seth brushed over his fur with a gentle hand, making sure every strand lay just right. His pecs, muscular and covered in short fur, had two human-like nipples that stood out, begging for attention. The jackal-man&#39;s loincloth was a simple piece of fabric, but it barely contained his impressive cock, which was currently at rest but still looked massive against his waist. He adjusted it slightly, ensuring that he looked as proper as a 7-foot anthropomorphic jackal could be in such attire. His Egyptian-style makeup was flawlessly applied, accentuating his features and making his eyes gleam like polished onyx.<br />
<br />
The makeup was something that Joe hadn&#39;t noticed at first glance. It was subtle yet striking, with gold outlining his eyes and a black kohl line that stretched out to his temples, giving him an exotic, almost otherworldly look. It was the kind of makeup you&#39;d see on the face of a statue in a museum, but here it was, on a living, breathing creature that had once been his mother. He blinked, and for a brief moment, he could see the love and care in Susan&#39;s eyes, looking back at him through Seth&#39;s gaze.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t even notice the way his cock grew hard, straining against the gold trimming of his boxers, magic leaked from it and wafted up to his ears, whispering in his mind. It told him that Seth was now his servant, a loyal and devoted follower of his every command. The thoughts of his mother&#39;s transformation into this creature were pushed aside as he focused on the power coursing through his veins. The magic was potent, and it filled him with a sense of dominance he had never felt before.<br />
<br />
Joe nodded, accepting his new reality. &quot;Alright, Seth,&quot; he said, his deep voice resonating in the grand hallway. &quot;What can you do for me today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seth&#39;s tail swished in excitement. &quot;I shall prepare a breakfast for your divine form, master.&quot; He gestured to the dining room, which had been transformed into an elaborate hall, the walls adorned with images of Anubis feasting on foods like a king. The table was made of darkened oak and had been stretched to an impressive length, with enough space to accommodate Joe&#39;s massive form comfortably. One seat was replaced with a throne, carved with intricate images of Anubis.<br />
<br />
Joe sat down on the throne, his furry buttocks sinking into the cushion. The aroma of freshly baked bread and exotic spices filled the air as Seth laid out a spread of food that could have fed an entire army. There were platters of roasted meats, fruit carved into the shapes of sacred Egyptian symbols, and a pyramid of what looked to be a sweet pastry filled with honey and nuts. Seth served him with grace and precision, pouring him a goblet of rich, dark wine that smelled faintly of berries.<br />
<br />
As Joe took a bite of the succulent food, he felt his senses heighten. The flavors were intense, the textures of the meats and fruits melding together in his mouth like a symphony of divine indulgence. Each chew felt like a declaration of his newfound power and status. He swallowed and took a sip of the wine, feeling it warm his throat and spread through his body like liquid fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your breakfast pleases you, master?&quot; Seth inquired, his deep, gruff voice filled with concern.<br />
<br />
Joe nodded, his mouth too full of food to answer properly. He had never tasted anything so heavenly. The combination of flavors danced on his tongue, and he could feel his new body reveling in the sustenance it was receiving. He took a moment to appreciate the view of his servant, who had transformed into a magnificent jackal. Seth&#39;s muscular form was covered in sleek fur, and his eyes gleamed with loyalty.<br />
<br />
As Joe finished his meal, Seth cleared the plates and bowed again. &quot;Is there anything else you require before you depart for your educational institution, Master?&quot; he asked, his voice a low rumble that resonated through the grand room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I need to get dressed,&quot; Joe replied, licking the last bits of honey from his fingers. &quot;Fetch something from my closet that suits my new... attire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seth disappeared and returned with a gold-trimmed shorts-and-shirt combo that somehow fit Joe&#39;s new form. The material was lightweight, but the design was regal, with an elaborate collar that framed Joe&#39;s jackal head and broad shoulders. The shirt had images of Anubis woven into it, and the shorts hugged his muscular hips and thighs, leaving his tail free to swish back and forth as he walked. Joe had to admit, it was a pretty snazzy look for school.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like?&quot; Joe asked, twirling to show off the outfit. Seth&#39;s eyes lit up with admiration. &quot;Indeed, master. You look... formidable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe chuckled, his tail wagging with excitement. &quot;Good to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
But as the meal settled in his stomach, a gurgling sound echoed through his large intestines. He frowned, realizing that his new body had certain...needs. &quot;Um, Seth,&quot; he began, his voice a little shaky, &quot;I need to use the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seth nodded, his ears perking up. &quot;Of course, master. This way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe followed his servant into the hallway, his new legs feeling strange and powerful with every step. The bathroom was unrecognizable. It had been transformed into a marble chamber with a sunken tub large enough for his massive form and a toilet that looked like a miniature throne. &quot;Well, I guess I should get used to this,&quot; he murmured, shutting the door behind him.<br />
<br />
With a bit of trepidation, he lowered his haunches over the gleaming porcelain. His stomach rumbled again, and he knew he couldn&#39;t put it off. He pushed, and his body responded with a force he&#39;d never felt. A thick, warm log of waste slid out of him, and he couldn&#39;t help but feel a little impressed by the sheer size of it. He watched as it plopped into the water, creating ripples that touched the edges of the bowl. The smell was surprisingly pleasant, reminiscent of the musky scent of the desert. It was as if his body had produced a bouquet of exotic spices instead of waste.<br />
<br />
Once done, Joe cleaned himself with the plush towels, feeling the softness against his fur. He looked into the mirror and couldn&#39;t help but admire the powerful creature that stared back at him. He flexed his muscular arms, watching the gold bracers glint in the light. His eyes were still human, but the rest of him was a walking, talking embodiment of a 25-foot-tall jackal man. He grinned, his teeth sharp and pointed. &quot;I am going to love this,&quot; he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Making his way to the garage, Joe felt his new body move with surprising grace. The gold sandals made no noise on the polished black marble floor, which was adorned with gold Anubis paw prints leading to the grand garage door. The garage had undergone a dramatic transformation as well, now resembling a chamber from the tomb of a Pharaoh, complete with hieroglyphs depicting scenes of Anubis driving his boat and chariots pulled by jackal-headed men. His car, however, remained mostly unchanged, aside from a gold trimming and the headrest embroidered with the image of Anubis&#39; head.<br />
<br />
Joe slid into the car, feeling the seat magically conform to his new shape, and with a nod to Seth, the door closed and the engine roared to life. The garage door opened smoothly, revealing the quiet neighborhood outside, untouched by the transformation within. He backed out, the wheels rolling over the freshly laid stone driveway that led to the road. The sight of the pyramid-inspired exterior of his house made him laugh with a deep, resonant sound that was a mix of man and beast. The garage door closed behind him with a gentle thud, and he drove off to school, feeling every eye in the neighborhood on him.<br />
<br />
No one batted an eye at the 25-foot-tall jackal driving a car. Cars passed by as if it were the most normal thing in the world. Children playing in their yards continued their games without a second glance. The neighborhood pets, usually barking at any unusual sight, remained silent. It was as if the town had collectively agreed to accept Joe&#39;s new form without question. The only difference in their perception was a slight nod of respect, a subtle bow of the head, or a wag of the tail from the animals, acknowledging his divine presence.<br />
<br />
Joe pulled into the school&#39;s parking lot, where his classmates were milling about, chattering away, completely unfazed by the massive Egyptian god-like creature stepping out of the car. The whispers grew louder as they approached, but it was not fear or shock that filled their voices. It was excitement, curiosity, and perhaps a hint of envy. His second day at school as a jackal man began now.</p>
