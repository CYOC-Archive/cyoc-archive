<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sandra stared at her new body in shock.<br />
<br />
What .... what has happened to me?  thought Sandra, as she examined her new body.  She was covered in dark scales from head to foot.  Her hands and feet were long reptilian paws ending in sharp claws. She had spikes trailing down her back to a very long thick tail.  Two larger leather wings extended from her back.  She could not see her face, but she could tell that her neck was now much longer.  She could twist her head down to her lower body easily.  She was immense in size, her chest towering over the treetops.  Her small house lay in tattered ruins around her, destroyed by her growing body.<br />
<br />
I am a dragon, she thought.  But how?  I have to figure out how to get back to normal.  <br />
<br />
As she looked around her tail absentmindedly swiped the side of her car, sending it flying several feet across the yard.<br />
<br />
Wow, thought Sandra.  That didn&#39;t hurt at all.  And I knocked it so far.  I must be very strong.<br />
<br />
She flexed her powerful thigh and arm muscles.  Sandra walked on all fours over to a large tree.  With a powerful swipe, she sent it flying several miles in the distance.<br />
<br />
Yes, very powerful, thought Sandra, as she smiled evilly.  She saw the box of vials far below her on the ground.  They had survived unharmed by the destruction of her house.<br />
<br />
Amy, this is her doing, thought Sandra.  This is not a curse, but a blessing.  She has given me the power to get revenge on the creatures who stole my child - those evil Gryphons!<br />
<br />
A sudden quick movement in the corn fields attracted the slit that was now her reptilian eye.  She quickly stomped over there, hoping to catch the Gryphons. She was surprised to find two little fairies, picking the kernels off the cobs of corn. Her corn!<br />
<br />
Those little thieves, thought Sandra angrily.  So it wasn&#39;t just the Gryphons, huh?  All manner of magical creatures were trying to destroy my farm and family.  They are all trying to ruin me. They are all out to get me.  Well, I&#39;ll show them.<br />
<br />
Sandra ran in into the cornfield, stomping her precious crops flat as she chased after the fairies.  She snapped at them, trying to catch them in her massive snout.  But they were too quick, and easily dodged her attack.  In frustration, she let forth a large jet of flame, setting her cornfield alight.  The fairies hovered above the burning fields then disappeared, seemingly teleporting away.  <br />
<br />
Sandra roared in frustration, surrounded by burning flames.   The fire did not hurt her.  Her thick leathery scales were much too tough for that.  She knew she should be concerned that her crop was destroyed.  There was no way she could ever pay the bank back now.  But it didn&#39;t seem to bother her anymore.<br />
<br />
Crops, banks, the farm, even her house..... Sandra scoffed.  Those things were part of her old life.  She had no need of them anymore.  She was a dragon, and she had no intention of returning to her old life.  Fate had seen fit to give her a better body, a better life.  And she wanted to embrace it.  She roared in celebration, setting fire to more of the field.<br />
<br />
Sandra felt a slight tingle on her thigh.  She turned and looked down.  A patrol car from the Sheriff&#39;s department had arrived, and the policeman was firing his pistol at her.  Sandra smiled.  She wondered if the townspeople would believe her now .... now that she had become a god!  It would have given her perverse pleasure to reign fiery death on all those who had doubted her.  It was almost ironic.  They would be destroyed by the very thing they refused to believe existed. <br />
<br />
 She felt another tingle as the patrolman fired again. It didn&#39;t hurt, but it was beginning to annoy her.  She considered killing him just as a punishment for his disrespect.  After all, he deserved it.  The whole town deserved to die.  But for now, she had bigger fish to fry.  She flew off in search of the accursed in Gryphons.  Perhaps she would return to terrorize the town later, after she had sated her desire for vengeance with the Gryphon&#39;s blood!<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The deputy watched the massive creature fly away.  He was glad it left.  It didn&#39;t look like his gun was having any effect.  He shuddered to think how he could kill a creature like that.  Besides, he had a bigger problem.  The fire it had started was beginning to burn out of control.<br />
<br />
He lifted his radio and began to call it in.  But what would he say?  He now knew that Sandra was right - magical creatures did exist.  But he also remembered her status as a pariah.  Did he really want to tell everyone he had been attacked by a dragon and be treated the same way?  He decided to just call it in as fire, and prayed that he never saw the beast again.<br />
<br />
After the fire was put out, the only thing that survived from Sandra&#39;s estate was a large wooden box filled with strange vials.  It was surprising that it was not burned, considering it appeared to be made of wood.  But the bank cared only about the dollar, and not about mysteries.  It was sold as part of the estate to pay off her debt, and ended up in a local antique store, quietly awaiting its next owner.</p>
