<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler couldn’t help but look at the calendar again: only three more weeks until his eighteenth birthday. He recently graduated high school, one of many young men to finish high school before their transition. He remembered the handful of seniors who had turned eighteen in their senior year, their black graduation gowns tented by their fully developed dicks, swollen with pride. At least he would transition by the time he left for college. Looking away from the calendar, he daydreamed about going off to college with his best friend, Colby, enjoying their large-dick status as they chased girls and maybe even got lucky enough to find a small-dick or two to feed and humiliate. Colby was a young man much like Tyler; Dark hair, dark eyes, tall and broad for their age. Colby was more into sports than Tyler was, but that didn’t stop Tyler from joining in on Colby’s work-out sessions along with their usual binge-gaming. Both young men were fit and lithely muscled, but Tyler had noticed that Colby had started to grow a bit bulkier and hairier than he had lately. Other than his pubic hair and his armpits, Tyler’s body hair had yet to fill in. Wheras Colby’s chest was starting to sport the beginnings of a rug, let alone his face and his arms. It made Tyler a little jealous, and in the back of his mind he knew these were the early signs of a large-dick’s transition, and that underdeveloped body hair was sometimes a sign of the opposite. But he pushed those fears from his mind. Small-dicks were one in a million, literally! There was no way he would turn out to be a small-dick. <br />
<br />
Tyler pushed himself away from his desk and leaned back in his chair, looking around his spartan bedroom. It was a weekday, with no school as the summer vacation had officially begun. Tyler had worked hard all year to sock away a nice savings for himself ahead of college, and so he’d quit his job to give him more time to enjoy his last summer before college. His parents were away at work; he had the house to himself. Smirking, Tyler unbuckled his pants and pulled them off, along with his boxers. Like most men his age, his cock small and under-developed; only eight inches when fully hard and six, maybe seven inches in girth. It was almost half the size of his father, who was the proud owner of a fifteen inch cock that stuck out prominently from his beneath his pleated kahki’s. Tyler hoped he would inherit his father’s endowment, maybe even make his old man proud by gaining a few inches over him. The thought made his cock stir to life, and without hesitation Tyler wrapped his hand around his cock and began to stroke himself as he fantasized about the months to come, when he’d have a man’s dick just like his friends and his father. His heavy balls clenched and heaved as Tyler stroked himself to climax, erupting a all over his black t-shirt. Tyler groaned and squirmed in his chair as he came, his lips and hiss asshole tingling in a way they never had when he’d jerked off before. He took a deep breath as the last of the aftershocks rolled over him. He stood up from his chair and pulled off his soiled shirt before tossing it into a corner. Tyler stumbled over to his bed and crawled under the sheets, feeling content from his orgasm, but his lazy day had left him feeling relaxed. A little nap couldn’t hurt, he rationed to himself. Not like he’d get the opportunity very much this fall, he mused to himself before drifting off to sleep.<br />
<br />
Tyler awoke to a heavy shaft of sunlight beaming in through his bedroom along with his usual case of morning wood. Leaning over to grab his phone, he rubbed his eyes as he checked his phone. Ten-thirty AM…the next day? He groaned as he realized his cat-nap hard turned into a eighteen-hour semi-coma. He was surprised his Dad hadn’t come in to wake him; maybe he did and Tyler just slept through it. He was about to step out of bed to use the bathroom when he noticed a message from his friend, Colby.<br />
<br />
“Dude,” it read, “Remember how a month ago we measured our dicks so we could keep track of our changes as we transitioned? Morning, btw.”<br />
<br />
“Morning,” Tyler fumbled as he replied, “and yeah? Why?”<br />
<br />
He was about to try and go for the bathroom again, but Colby must have been excited because he responded back almost immediately. “Well, I was seven and a half inches yesterday, now I’m almost nine!” and then another message, “If it keeps up at this pace I’m gonna be huge!”<br />
Tyler laughed and replied, “Congrats. Now you’re slightly less of a small-dick.”<br />
<br />
“Haha, asshole. Check yourself lately?” Colby asked.<br />
<br />
Tyler thought about it. The last month before a man’s eighteenth birthday is usually the time when his large-dick traits start to fully develop. Colby’s birthday was a week before Tyler’s, so it made sense that his dick was already starting to grow. The thought reminded him of his own morning wood, still hard after all this dick talk. Colby’s cock might be bigger than mine now, Tyler thought to himself. For some strange reason, his cock grew especially rigid and hard between his legs. Tyler didn’t think much of it, but went for his nightstand where he knew he kept a length of tailor’s tape somewhere. His left hand was absentmindedly stroking his cock to keep himself hard. Finally finding the tape, he focused on his cock trying to make it as stiff as possible, applying the beginning of the tape to the base of his shaft and measuring all the way up to his throbbing head. Just a tad over seven inches. Tyler frowned and wrapped the tape around his shaft; five, five-and-a-half inches, tops. Had his dick gotten smaller? At that moment, Tyler’s phone buzzed.<br />
<br />
“Well?” Colby asked with multiple question marks.<br />
<br />
Tyler bit his lip as he thought of a reply before typing, “Nothing yet. Still the same eight inches.” He sent back.<br />
<br />
A moment later, “Aw, don’t worry, small-dick. There’s still a month left to go.”<br />
<br />
Tyler took a deep breath when he read that word, small-dick. His cock throbbed and leaked a bit of pre-cum, and despite the pleasure Tyler was suddenly filled with a feeling of dread. Was he becoming a small dick?<br />
<br />
A heavy knock on the door pulled Tyler from his thoughts. Judging by the force, it was probably his father.<br />
<br />
“Tyler, you up?” his father boomed through the door in his deep voice. Tyler had seconds to find a pair of boxers and a shirt to throw on before his father opened the door.<br />
<br />
Tyler’s father, James, entered the room, his hand lingering on the door as he peered into the room and at Tyler with a piercing glare.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” he almost shouted, making Tyler jump.<br />
<br />
“Nothing…” he mumbled, but his father’s face broke into a smile.<br />
<br />
“Lighten up, buddy. You’d think eighteen hours of sleep would make you a lot less jumpy,” James said, stepping into the room. He was dressed in a plain button-up shirt and tie that hugged his broad chest and round shoulders nicely. Tyler also noticed that he was wearing his signature pleated khakis; he had always though they were a of a dorky choice for his father. But he supposed nothing is dorky when its bulging from having a giant cock stuffed in it. The bulge ran almost all the way down his father’s left thigh to his knee; hie father sometimes joked he was more of a shower than a grower. <br />
<br />
“Yea, I can’t believe you guys didn’t wake me up.” Tyler yawned.<br />
<br />
“We tried,” his father said, chuckling, “But you were out. Smoke a little too much pot on your day off, Mr. High School Graduate?” James laughed, his thick beard parting in a toothy grin.<br />
<br />
“Just, zonked out, I guess.” Tyler said, sitting down on the bed and rubbing his eyes. “Do you have work today?” he asked, wondering why his dad was home so early in the day.<br />
<br />
James shrugged his shoulders. “I took an early weekend. One of the benefits of making your own schedule.” His father sold insurance from his home office, often bouncing around town to meet with clients. “Now, get dressed and come eat something.” He said before stepping out of the room. Tyler reached for his phone again and saw that Colby had sent him another message.<br />
<br />
“I get back from my vacay on Monday. Wanna kick it?” it read.<br />
<br />
“Sure. We’ll go to the river.” Tyler wrote back, smiling. It had been really hot these last few days, but he’d been waiting for his friend to get back from vacation in Mexico before going to the river with the rest of their friends. <br />
<br />
“Sounds like a plan. Later.” <br />
<br />
Tyler tossed the phone onto his bed and stood up to find a pair of shorts. He grabbed his shoes and socks on the way out and sauntered down the hall, trying to push the thought of his lost inch out of his mind.</p>
