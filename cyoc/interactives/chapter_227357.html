<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tuxing was delighted to see Lenard and Mikey come to visit Heiya Island for Christmas and Dongzhi. She knew that they would have to return to Idaho before New Year&#39;s Eve, but a lot of that would have to do with Lenard and Mikey needing to be back in school shortly after. Still, they would have some time on Heiya Island before Christmas and a day or two after, that would be more than enough time enjoy some time together and work on some of the wedding plans that would be coming up. The biggest thing was Mikey coming up to present Tuxing with a brightly wrapped box with wrapping paper with a cartoon tigress in Chinese clothing on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;We got you a Christmas gift,&quot; Mikey announced as he offered the box to Tuxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... though, the best gift is you and your brother coming to visit,&quot; Tuxing replied and accepted the box and smiled as Lenard approached while carrying his and Mikey&#39;s bags, &quot;was your flight well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It went well,&quot; Lenard smiled, &quot;tiring from being in the air for so long... but it went well. Probably because a lot of the issues with transportation coordination weren&#39;t as bad this year as last year... though a lot of the area east of us is supposed to get hit by some bad winter weather.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tuxing nodded and they made their way out. There was some visible excitement as Mikey was excited for the holiday, it was something she&#39;d long expected. For the Elements time in Lyre and Animalia was enough to show them how Americans looked forward to the holiday and with Shuixing marrying Nate, there were elements of that that were also coming along in much the same way. Nate had managed to find a red and green onesie that he had Maya Quin Yuan in, and the little Water Buffalo Animalian also seemed to love it. Tuxing supposed she&#39;d see a lot more of it when the move to Idaho for her came, though, certain elements of the Christmas season weren&#39;t too bad. They returned to find Shuixing seated with Maya in her lap while watching Nate decorate the tree. Mikey was quick to notice Maya.<br />
<br />
&quot;You had your baby,&quot; Mikey said as he approached Shuixing, &quot;is he okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She is,&quot; Shuixing answered with a small smile, and then introduced the youngest Bowman as Maya turned to look to Mikey while blinking her eyes, &quot;This is Maya Quin Yuan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s very cute, but won&#39;t her horns come in now?&quot; Mikey wondered, remembering questions he&#39;d asked last Christmas when Shuixing was pregnant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Horn growth isn&#39;t instantaneous in cattle,&quot; Nate commented as he placed an ornament on the tree, &quot;and with some breeds... the horns are actually cut when young so that when they grow up, the horns aren&#39;t there... and some breeds only have relatively short horns. I would assume that a lot of the development there for Water Buffalo aren&#39;t too different from domestic cattle. So, it may take a while before Maya has horns as big as her mother&#39;s, which I&#39;m sure Shuixing will teach her the appropriate lessons in balance and use in self-defense in her style.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... well, she is very cute,&quot; Mikey then spoke.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And of course, the days went by peacefully and with a fair amount of fun going back and forth. Some of it produced some skirmishes between Huoxing and Muxing over who would get married first, the outgoing Red Panada Animalian dating the Human who seemed to forever be extremely shy, or the more repressed Viper Animalian trying to hide that she liked the two headed uplifted Viper of the same species. Though, at some point with both Mikey and Maya present, some of the teasing was forced to be cut short. And the dinner went quite well, and Tuxing was pleased to see that Mikey enjoyed a lot the local foods and styles, though he ended up eating more than any was expected and was taken to the guest room that he and Lenard shared while Nate took Maya to his and Shuixing&#39;s room and leaving the baby monitor with Shuixing. The rest soon sat around the dinner table as the topic of the coming summer wedding took center stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll take care of Tuxing, right?&quot; Shuixing asked to Lenard as he returned after making sure that Mikey was down and in bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... meeting her last year... it&#39;s ignited something that really wasn&#39;t there since when my folks were alive,&quot; Lenard answered, &quot;as... after they died, so much of my spare time was devoted to looking after Mikey and providing him with some cheer, as losing one&#39;s parents when you&#39;re young is hard. And that kinda put a major cramp on my social life. Your sister... and talking with her by phone or skype or zoon... it&#39;s all precious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Huoxing said softly, &quot;and don&#39;t mind Shuixing being a bit protective... Tuxing has held us all together and been the Elements leader, even before we became the Five Elements. I think she was a bit surprised that Tuxing would be moving to Idaho to live with you rather than you coming here as Nate did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... that&#39;s all rough, but I am under contract as a school librarian, and Mikey has made some friends there,&quot; Lenard replied, &quot;I can&#39;t uproot him... particularly as I&#39;m also pretty sure your school library here won&#39;t have any openings for one who is not familiar with Chinese or Japanese literature at any level.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were some nods at that, though Lenard assumed that the discussion would soon move over onto other subjects related to the wedding.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d take it you&#39;d want your local pastor to provide the service?&quot; Muxing wondered slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wouldn&#39;t necessarily have to be a religious ceremony,&quot; Lenard commented, &quot;though I do have some coworkers and friends that I would like to have present for the wedding... which would make it easier to have the wedding in Idaho.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They can&#39;t afford to come here?&quot; Jinxing asked, &quot;we could probably pay for their tickets if need be... I mean, we have some independent jobs here, but things connected to the Elements do provide some money for all of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be very generous, but money wouldn&#39;t be the ONLY concern, and with the summer being the best time for me, with regard to my work schedule, there will be other things, like little league, the various rodeos, and other summer activities would be a potential issue,&quot; Lenard replied.<br />
<br />
Lenard watched as the Elements looked to each other and he heard Nate&#39;s hooves clopping on the floor as he returned. He noted that most of the eyes ultimately turned to Tuxing, as if they were expecting her decision. Though, Tuxing remained silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I suppose that could work,&quot; Huoxing said after a moment, &quot;and it&#39;d be close to this big park...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yellowstone,&quot; Lenard answered, &quot;and yes, the part of Idaho I live in is pretty close to the western entrances to the park. And I do have some camping gear if you&#39;d actually want to go... though, you may need to pay to get in and follow the Rangers&#39; instructions on specifically where to go... but AFTER the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Huoxing answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are some mountain trails in the guidebooks...&quot; Tuxing commented after a moment to Jinxing, &quot;some of that terrain may be interesting to explore... though following the rules regarding bears would be a must.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of that would depend on WHEN in the summer you&#39;re wanting the wedding,&quot; Muxing pointed out.<br />
<br />
This time it was Lenard and Tuxing who traded glances.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were thinking mid-June,&quot; Tuxing spoke, &quot;it&#39;d be far enough after school ends that we wouldn&#39;t be messing with the end of school hustle and bustle and early enough that we wouldn&#39;t get in the way of the July fourth travel and celebrations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes sense,&quot; Nate commented as he sat down next to Shuixing, &quot;and might give us time to then go see mom and dad... let Maya meet her Aunts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shuixing relaxed a bit a that and then looked to Lenard, &quot;would you need help on anything... looking after your cabin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I might ask that whoever comes and decides to have a bit of a vacation look after Mikey over the honeymoon,&quot; Lenard commented, &quot;though... if you can&#39;t manage... there are some friends that I would trust him with for a little while...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can manage it... you have taken him to Yellowstone, right?&quot; Jinxing wondered, saying this mostly for Tuxing and glaring occasionally to Muxing to make sure that her serpentine sister didn&#39;t back out of anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I might be able to arrange a few days off to go with you to the wedding, my dear, Jinxing,&quot; Mitsue said to her, &quot;but not much more than that... as a lot of my work is pretty steady too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Jinxing answered, &quot;we can still manage, though...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where were you guys thinking on having the wedding?&quot; Shuixing asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s this park that&#39;s in the downtown area that&#39;s pretty nice,&quot; Lenard spoke, &quot;it has lots of trees and a nice sort of picnic area and something a bandstand on a raised platform. I&#39;d sent some emails to Tuxing... that I think that area would do well, and the justice of the peace could officiate the ceremony there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can show you all the pictures,&quot; Tuxing commented, &quot;it is a good spot. And if absolutely need be for any sort of &quot;cultural&quot; thing, we could do something like what we did for Nate and Shuixing here. Let the justice of the peace do the official ceremony for Idaho&#39;s state laws for marriage licenses and all that... and the paperwork, I&#39;m sure will be extensive... but also have someone from Heiya Island to provide something similar for us afterward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like you&#39;ve all done a lot already,&quot; Jinxing commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve discussed some things on email, but hadn&#39;t been able to fully confirm things,&quot; Tuxing explained, &quot;and much of this was to see on what you&#39;re all thinking on what we have before getting into the nitty-gritty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it&#39;s not my wedding, so it really isn&#39;t my place,&quot; Muxing spoke and tried to hide the fact that she was absentmindedly rubbing her tail over the tip of Li-Wei&#39;s tail beside her. Thankfully, she didn&#39;t think anyone but Li-Wei noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;The heads up now isn&#39;t a problem, as we can all spread things out... or maybe bring them all together,&quot; Huoxing commented, &quot;make it a big wedding! I know I&#39;m making some progress with Gang... I&#39;m sure either he&#39;ll get the courage to propose without fainting...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s tried?&quot; Shuixing asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he started... but I got excited and jumped up and down, he got a nosebleed and then ran off,&quot; Huoxing answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you wearing?&quot; Jinxing asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That black dress you said I looked good in,&quot; Huoxing answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That dress wasn&#39;t for jumping up and down in... you might have shown him a lot of bouncing cleavage, if not a full boob,&quot; Jinxing answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may be best to let all things develop at their own pace,&quot; Tuxing spoke, noting that Gang had left shortly after dinner to be with his sister, &quot;particularly as adding other weddings now would only complicate the plans as they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Huoxing and Jinxing nodded while Muxing remained still.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it does sound like a good plan,&quot; Shuixing spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two just put your plans into motion and keep us informed,&quot; Nate urged, &quot;we&#39;ll then do our best to make sure we can meet with your schedule.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Tuxing said, finding herself smiling.</p>
