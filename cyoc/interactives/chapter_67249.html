+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
You were slightly nervous as Elizabeth covered up the &quot;cave&quot; in which the articles of clothing the mermaids had collected over various years of &quot;feeding&quot; on humans or transforming those they felt worthy of becoming mermaids. Most of this related a feeling you felt without you. Your nipples were growing erect underneath your shirt and you could feel a &quot;tingle&quot; between your legs. Your body was growing aroused, you could feel it and you somehow knew it.<br />
<br />
But this was unlike any arousal you had had before. And it had nothing to do with the fact thanks to the mermaids you were female and not male anymore. This felt more like a need. It wasn't like you were horny and wanted to have sex. It was, you were horny and NEEDED to have sex. And you could feel that urge growing as you stood there.<br />
<br />
&quot;There,&quot; Elizabeth spoke as hiding of the trunk was done and she stood up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Won't someone find that?&quot; you wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our little stretch of beach is not one that people tend to use, at least not to swim from,&quot; Elizabeth answered and lead you toward the path you had initially followed to go down to where the mermaids were, &quot;most use it look out at the ocean from various scenic points... though there is also a fair amount of magic that we use to insure that those who do go down there to swim don't find it... or they see us and are lured into the water...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To be killed,&quot; you gave a shudder.<br />
<br />
&quot;If they're female, we usually transform them,&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;and as for feeding on them... that depends on whether or not we judge the man to be good or not. Good men we transform into mermaids... they're usually the ones who try to resist our pheromones, as you did. Those that are bad... our pheromones may attract them toward us, but once they're close enough to either transform or feed on... it's usually clear that they would try to force themselves on us even without our pheromones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you let them rape you?&quot; you ask, not noticing that that was something a transformed woman would say rather then a transformed man.<br />
<br />
&quot;We must feed to survive, Michelle,&quot; Elizabeth said weakly, &quot;If we don't feed... we die.&quot;<br />
<br />
And dying was not something you wanted to do, but you could feel your arousal growing. It felt like some strange inhuman hunger, but you also knew that if you satisfied it, you would end up killing someone. You didn't want to do that. What you wanted was to be a human male again and to forget the mistake you'd made. But you didn't want to die, and a part of you was rapidly seeing Elizabeth as a &quot;sister&quot; of sorts, and you didn't want to make her feel bad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I gaining mermaid's instincts now?&quot; you silently wondered to yourself, &quot;the more I stay a mermaid... the more I begin to think like one... Elizabeth is not my sister... I am not her sister... my name is Micheal and I'm supposed to be a man...&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked up to see Elizabeth's blond hair and bare back, other then the back of the bikini top she was wearing and then sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;But she will kill me if refuse to follow their deal... she will feed on me, and I don't want that,&quot; you then thought with a sigh, &quot;Damn... I'm getting so horny... I... I... I need to feed... but I can't... I don't want to kill anyone... but... I'm so hungry... so horny...&quot;<br />
<br />
By now the two of you had reached the top of the path that you had earlier descended. You were about to head toward your home to try and collect your wife when Elizabeth called you back to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me, Michelle,&quot; Elizabeth instructed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...? Why?&quot; you ask, &quot;My house is that way. That is where my wife will be. Don't you want me to transform her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;and then the three of us can be sisters... but right now, YOU are the only sister with me at the moment, and right now I'm looking to make sure you don't die before you can transform your wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean to keep me from dying?&quot; you asked, &quot;I thought this whole mission was to keep me from dying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The mission is to keep you from being fed on... to keep you a sister and keeping you with your wife,&quot; Elizabeth gripped your hands, like the way a best friend or blood relative would, &quot;right now... you need to feed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've become a mermaid, and since you were an adult when you changed, you are an adult mermaid,&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;Our children, born from our couplings with humans feed off of our breast milk and various small fish and crustaceans that we or they catch... but once they become adults they must feed on human sexual energy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and a lot of mermaids don't,&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;but we must... and I can feel your hunger. You're putting out twice as much of our pheromones then I am. You need to feed, Michelle, I know you don't like the idea... but it is something you must do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know...?&quot; you began to ask, trying to look at yourself. You had tried to dress yourself conservatively, but you feared that your body had done something that alerted Elizabeth to your arousal.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a way of sensing each other's arousal,&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;you'll even be able to sense when I'm hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made you shudder. A lot of it was at the horror of what you'd become. What they'd turned you into. Another part of it was horror at the fact that a part of you actually wanted it. A part of you wanted to feed. To have sex with a man. You were trying that part, but as you continued to grow more and more aroused, it was clear that you were losing that battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I... I... feel so... horny,&quot; you said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;And I'll be taking you to a portion of town where you won't need to worry about some human you know or care about. Come on...&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth then continued on in a different direction from where you lived. You looked toward where your house was, sighed and feeling unable to fight the hunger you had... the sexual hunger to feed on some's &quot;energy&quot;, you followed her. As you walked though, a lone thought went through your mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a monster.&quot;</p>
