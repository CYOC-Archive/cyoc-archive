<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leo Skye had been worried before he was converted and some time after it. Not that being a king cobra would have major drawbacks, getting used to slithering was a bit of work, but he mastered it. Not that he would be in bad health, his health has never been better and he scored pretty high with the A-BC tournament, even if he didn&#39;t win. But what worried him was the fact that his Animalian mating instincts will inevitably make him attracted to the opposite sex and he considered being gay a big part of who he was.<br />
<br />
However, thanks to Dr. Jones&#39;s Homosexuals Anonymous program, Leo had been adjusting to his new identity while realizing he hadn&#39;t lost his old one. The program was not, as some bigots would like to call it, a deprogramming treatment for gays and lesbians. Rather, it was meant to help gays and lesbians who have converted who were worried about how their new bisexuality will affect them. The program was rather effective in helping the first few patients adapt. Ella and Simone made no secret of how they&#39;ve been having regular trysts with Tom and Frank as well as each other. And he&#39;s heard that Brawn has had a big night with Petunia, though Leo hadn&#39;t heard whether or not Brawn was looking for a boyfriend.<br />
<br />
As for Leo himself, he was finding the female cobra he has been paired with, Corona, to be very pleasant company. He was a little anxious about dealing with someone of the opposite sex, like he was being pigeonholed into heterosexual conformity. But Corona was never pushy with him. She just wanted to be his friend and make him feel comfortable. She had been plenty of help with training for the A-BC tournament. Though Leo was pretty sure Corona was using the training sessions to non-verbally flirt with him. The old Leo wouldn&#39;t even give a thought for her gestures. But the cobra could see a mate that was interested in him. And while Leo wasn&#39;t ready to be committed to anyone, particularly a woman, that didn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t open to being &#39;friends with benefits&#39;.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
While Corona was pleased that Leo wanted to take the next step, she wasn&#39;t about to rush him. It would be easier to not have Leo as a mate than it would to not have him as a friend. She wasn&#39;t going to take advantage of him when he was so emotionally vulnerable. In Leo&#39;s bedroom, they removed their clothes while trying to remain casual. Though Corona teased a little bit with unveiling her bare breasts. She hadn&#39;t felt particular pride in them before meeting Leo. There were snakes with bigger boobs, but she was still a substantial handful. Leo&#39;s bare body wasn&#39;t particularly offensive to human sensibilities, at least until his hemipenis was fully erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t have to be really quick with this,&quot; said Corona, &quot;You might find it a little uncomfortable at first. We can take the time you need to adjust.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leo rolled his eyes and said, &quot;Corona, I&#39;m not a virgin. I&#39;ve had sex before, just not with a woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Corona, &quot;Well, maybe we should try sex that you&#39;ve had before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, with two guys, there isn&#39;t particularly a lot of room for variation,&quot; said Leo, &quot;I suppose we could anal but, well...&quot; He glanced down at his and Corona&#39;s serpentine bodies and said, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t even know how that would work with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s something we should try at first,&quot; said Corona. Her anus was located in a much different place than a human woman&#39;s and she wasn&#39;t sure she&#39;d like Leo sticking anything in there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s still oral,&quot; said Leo.<br />
<br />
&quot;That, I can do,&quot; said Corona. She lowered her head to Leo&#39;s hemipenis. Stretching out her tongue, she took a long lick of one penis, both tasting and smelling it. Her tongue darted it over some more before she wrapped her hips around it. The other penis was not forgotten as Corona began stroking it with her hand. Judging by the way Leo was hissing, he was enjoying this as well. This was a bit of an atypical thing for Corona to being doing. But what she&#39;s seen and heard suggested that is one of the best ways a woman could please her man. Eventually, Leo gave a low hiss and started ejaculating from both rods. Corona caught most of the stuff with her mouth and the other stuff  ended up on her chest.<br />
<br />
Corona licked herself clean, which was not snakelike and her experiencing the flavor of Leo was a little overwhelming. But as soon as she was cleaned up, she gave Leo a lusty look. &quot;Ready for the main course, big boy?&quot; she hissed seductively.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will be in a minute,&quot; said Leo. Corona raised herself up, letting her body slide against Leo&#39;s as she did. As soon as her vagina lips touched the tips of his dicks, she pushed against them, letting them slide into her. Leo moaned as he felt a pleasurable tightness around his dicks. He pushed into Corona, allowing his rods to go in deep before pulling them back out.<br />
<br />
Leo and Corona moaned as they fucked harder. Corona&#39;s breasts were starting to bounce at the force of their exertion. Leo grabbed them and massage them. He was definitely starting to lean towards bi, but he wasn&#39;t comfortable enough to really enjoy them. So he rubbed Corona&#39;s nipples with his fingers. Corona hissed as she started producing milk from her breasts. She was so close, she could feel it.<br />
<br />
Then both let out a loud hiss as Leo finally shot his loads into Corona. There were some difference between this and doing this with another guy, but he still liked the experience a lot. He was still going to look for a boyfriend, but having sex with Corona wasn&#39;t half bad.</p>
