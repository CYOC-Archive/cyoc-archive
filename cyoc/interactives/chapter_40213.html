<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dani awoke, realizing that it was Sunday. Sliding out of bed, he thought, &quot;What a nice dream,&quot; and exited his room.<br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom, he reaches down and pulls his penis out and begins to do his business, not paying any attention, still trying desperately to wake up. &quot;What shall I do today,&quot; he asks himself, as he finishes his business and walks to the sink, glad his parents are out of town visiting relatives.<br />
<br />
Turning on the sink, he stops. Turning off the sink, he turns sideways and thinks, &quot;What the hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning so he's facing the sink, he looks into the mirror and then lifts up his shirt. Where's it's normally flat, Dani sees two, firm and pert C cup sized breasts. Touching one, and being torn between liking the way it feels and something telling him it's inappropriate to be touching them, he drops his shirt and thinks, &quot;It's not a dream. I need to find that arcade that, that...&quot;<br />
<br />
For some reason he can't think of who showed him the arcade and washing his hands, he dries them off and opens the door.<br />
<br />
Only to run into Maria, who tells him, &quot;We need to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani grinned sheepishly and hugged himself, hoping that Maria couldn't really see that he had breasts. Telling her, &quot;Look, if this about me wearing your clothes, I'm sorry. I've done it for years now and thought you knew. If it bothers you so much, take me shopping so I can buy my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking her head, Maria said, &quot;This isn't about that. Though, to tell you the truth, I've always suspected you were doing that. It just threw me through a loop when I found you doing it yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani tried to move past her and as he did so, he asked, &quot;Are the others still here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria shook her head and said, &quot;No, but we still need to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't this wait until I get dressed and have a bite for breakfast,&quot; Dani asked, wondering how to hide his breasts from his sister.<br />
<br />
Maria sighed and completely out of patience, replied, &quot;No!&quot; and before Dani could stop her, she reached up her shirt and pulled off her pajama pants. Seeing the look on Dani's face, Maria reached for the hem of the shirt and lifted it up.<br />
<br />
Her breasts, penis and testicles barred to her brother, Maria tried to cover up one, then the other, tried to cover her breasts and then finally said, &quot;I got an egg. From who, I don't remember. When I opened it, I found a pair of boxer briefs inside. When I tried them on, I grew...this,&quot; and gestured to her new set of genitals.<br />
<br />
Dani nodded and reached down and pulling up on the hem, removed his shirt. Breasts exposed, noting that they're just about the same size as his sister's, Dani replied, &quot;I think we have the same problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
For the next couple hours, they discussed quietly amongst themselves how best to solve this problem. During this time they both got dressed, both Dani and Maria dressed in girl's clothing, and had breakfast. As they sat in the living room, Dani brought the conversation back around and stated, &quot;I still think our answer lies at the arcade, where this forgotten person got the eggs. Where is the egg you had?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria shrugged and said, &quot;That's the strange thing. When I woke up this morning, I couldn't find it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to come up with a response, Dani stood and looked down. Taking in the tight white shirt that fully displayed his C cup breasts and hourglass figure, the tight button fly pants and the ankle socks, he asked, &quot;Should I go like this, or change into something different,&quot; all the while thinking of the tight floral printed panties that just barely covered anything.<br />
<br />
Maria shrugged and without thinking about it said, &quot;You look really cute like that. If you weren't my brother, I'd screw you in a second,&quot; and then stopped as she realized what she just said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's really creepy,&quot; Dani said as he stood and went to find a pair of shoes that would fit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no idea,&quot; Maria said, following. &quot;Not only did I say it without thinking about it, but I can feel my penis getting hard just thinking about being with a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani just shakes his head and says, &quot;We really need to figure this out and soon,&quot; as he puts on his coat and a pair of shoes that belong to Maria. Seeing that his sister is ready, they leave the house and begin to walk toward the mall.<br />
<br />
Inside the mall, the two quickly located the new arcade and begin to search it, looking for an answer to there problem. Half an hour later they meet in the food court with no new answers. After lunch they were right back at it; this time Dani and Maria wanted to try a couple of the machines.<br />
<br />
Taking a card from the machine near the door, they began to peruse the arcade. The first machine that Dani tried was the claw machine, seeing many strange items in it that looked like they might have also come from the eggs. After several unsuccessful tries, Dani used the last fifty cents on his card on a fortune telling machine and all it told him, via a card, was 'The sea calls'.<br />
<br />
Maria was trying several different machines, most being the type where you had to maneuver a coin, ball or some type of toy car toward a specific hole in order to win a prize. So far she was having no luck whats so ever and finally in frustration, when she'd used the last bit of cash on her card, she began to use quarters out of her purse.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to waste all her quarters, she finally called it quits when she placed a quarter inside a old, crank-like vending machine. Turning the handle, she listened as springs and cogs went to work and then seconds later a click could behind the metal flap.<br />
<br />
Lifting it, she nearly squealed with delight when she saw a purple and pink plastic egg sitting inside the tray. Scooping it up, she went to find Dani. Finding him near the entrance, she whispered, &quot;I think I might have gotten something that may be of help. Follow me.&quot; and with that said, she exited the arcade and started making her way through the mall.<br />
<br />
Dani followed her and soon both had exited the mall. Getting on a bus with Maria, he asked, &quot;So were are we going?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria took a seat and as soon as Dani had sat down, she replied, &quot;I think the best place to examine this is at the beach house. After all, we don't know when mom and dad will be home. We certainly don't walking them in on us as we transform again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we transform,&quot; Dani said with a bit uncertainty. But deep in his heart, he knew his sister was right and certainly didn't want his parents walking in on them.<br />
<br />
For the rest of the ride both remained silent and when they got close to their destination, they exited at the closest stop. Three blocks away and down a set of steps, Maria let herself in, while Dani first paused to look at the ocean, feeling for some reason it calling to him. Shrugging, he instead entered the beach house.<br />
<br />
Inside he found Maria inside trying to open the egg. Not being to open, she handed it to Dani, who also tried. It was several seconds of passing back and forth before the two realized that they were doing it wrong and Maria finally remembered to push in and then twist. Opening the egg, three nondescript rolled up pieces of fabric fell out. Picking one of them up, Dani asked, &quot;Are these for males or females?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria shrugged and said, &quot;Only way to find out,&quot; and picking up one of the pieces of fabric, she started to head for her room.<br />
<br />
Selecting a pair, Dani unrolled it and looked at the fabric. It was obviously a pair of underwear, but for what sex Dani could not tell. &quot;They're bikini briefs and they could easily be for either male or female,&quot; he thought while looking at the black fabric.<br />
<br />
Thinking his sister was right, he made his way toward the back of the house and toward his room, but stopped and instead headed for the bathroom. &quot;Want to see the change in the mirror,&quot; Dani thought as he let himself inside the bathroom. Closing the door, he began to strip off his clothes.<br />
<br />
Holding the underwear up in front of his privates, Dani still couldn't figure out what sex and gender they were for. Sighing, he pulled them on.<br />
<br />
At first, nothing happened and Dani thought they might have been a joke. And then he doubled over in pain. Sinking to his knees, he looked up just in time to watch as his C cup sized breasts shrink down to a B, an A and then prepubescent breast buds. Grinning, Dani watched as they shrank until he was completely flat chested.<br />
<br />
But his ecstasy quickly turned to horror when he saw that the bulge in his underwear also was quickly disappearing. Swearing, he hastily began to take the underwear off, but it was all in vain as the area between his legs split open and the vulva began to form.<br />
<br />
Looking up, Dani gasped as vertigo washed over him and in front of him, he watched as the image in the mirror began to shrink. As he, now she, began to shrink, Dani's hair turned dark red and started to grow down past her shoulders. As the vertigo passed and the pain subsided, Dani realized that the transformation was over. Reflected back was a four year old girl.<br />
<br />
Wanting to cry, Dani reached up and tried to open the door, but it was simple to high. After a couple of tries, she managed to open the door. Wandering toward Maria's room, Dani said in a voice that surprised her because of how high it was, &quot;Maria? Those weren't underwear for a boy,&quot; but stopped when she saw that her sister was not in her room.<br />
<br />
Wandering the house, Dani eventually found Maria outside, but almost ignored her on account that she now looked about six years old. What clued Dani in was that she too was also naked.<br />
<br />
Rushing out to her, Dani was about to say something when she not only felt the ocean calling her, but also what Maria said.<br />
<br />
Turning to Dani, she asked, &quot;Do you here it? The ocean calls to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani, completely overpowered with the call, nodded and taking Maria's hand, the two began to walk out into the surf. When the water was up to their waist, the two dived forward and disappeared beneath the surface. Swimming was difficult at first, but as their legs fused together and started to turn into a fin, it became much easier. Within in minutes, the two human children were gone and what was in there place was two very young mermaids.<br />
<br />
Listening to the call, Dani and Maria swam further and further out. And the farther out they went, the more their old life faded.</p>
