<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Trish waited for Sam to calm down after her sudden near-regression into a fox. "Okay, now that we know what we're doing... Are you ready?"
<P>"Yeah. Let's get this makeover started."
<P>"Come on over here by the mirror," Trish motioned. "I'll take this one idea at a time."
<P>Sam stood in front of the mirror, placing the remote in reaching distance on the dresser next to it.
<P>"You could have a lot going for you," Trish mused. "First I think, let's start with your hair. Since you and I seem to love it long, it will now grow a foot every minute until I think it should stop."
<P>Sam felt a faint tingle on her head, signaling the start of its rapid growth.
<P>"While that does its thing, let's grow some fur. Orange with black stripes. What do you think? With a white area in front, all the way down to your thighs."
<P>As Trish spoke, the changes occurred across Sam's body. From head to toe she became covered in orange fur, with black stripes on her arms, back and legs. White fur covered her chest and disappeared under her clothes.
<P>Trish walked in between Sam and the mirror, closely examining her face. "Some stripes on your face would look nice as well." She slowly pressed her index fingers into the thin fur on Sam's face, tracing a line from her tear ducts, over her cheeks and ending at the sides of her mouth. "Here...and here..." The fur began to turn black along the path Trish indicated. Meanwhile, Trish drew another set of curving lines from the outer edges of Sam's cheeks to the bottom of her jaw. She drew another, longer line parallel to it just in front of her ears. Black stripes drew themselves in wherever she traced. She drew a line going straight down from Sam's hairline to between her eyes. Then she drew perpendicular stripes branching off of it across her forehead.
<P>Trish backed off so that Sam could see her artwork. "Not bad, huh? You're looking pretty cool. Those ears need to come up, though, and look more like a tiger's ears."
<P>At Trish's command, Sam's ears slowly moved upward on her head. They grew larger and furry, tipped in black. Soon she had a pair of round feline ears sitting proudly atop her head.
<P>"Your hair is coming along nicely," Trish remarked. "It's down to your tail already."
<P>"I don't have a tail," Sam said, confused. "When did you say that?"
<P>"I just did," Trish smiled. She watched as a small bulge formed in the seat of Sam's pants.
<P>"Ouch...that hurts," Sam winced.
<P>"No problem," Trish said nonchalantly. "Your pants have a trendy hole in them for your tail, complete with a button flap above it so you can put them on and take them off without having to string your tail all the way through it. I know that could get pretty uncomfortable."
<P>A hole exactly like the one Trish described appeared in the pants. The waist of the pants separated above it and became fastened back together by a button. The orange and black striped tail easily worked its way out of the new hole.
<P>"Actually, pants in general won't be practical for you anymore, now that you've got so much fur and those tiger-like legs."
<P>Sam faltered for a moment as her legs shifted into something between human legs and the strong hind legs of a tiger, but she was still able to stand upright. Her thicker thighs constrained her pants, and the fur on her legs itched against the fabric.
<P>"You'd feel a lot better in a short skirt. And you'd look a lot better too. Those socks can go as well, since your feet are gonna be large padded paws now."
<P>The changes continued as Trish commanded. Sam watched her pants shift into a short blue skirt that still had a hole for her tail. She could just see the white patches of fur on her thighs under the bottom of the skirt. Her socks disappeared. Her feet pushed her upward as she was forced to stand on her toes. Surprisingly, this wasn't uncomfortable at all. Her feet became padded and clawed, looking much bigger than before.
<P>"Hmm...you're a bit too tall now," Trish said. "You should be my height."
<P>Sam shrank down a few inches until they were eye-to-eye.
<P>"I'm thinking your hair should be a different color," Trish remarked. Sam's hair now reached past her butt and was still jet black. "It should be dark orange with two black streaks in the middle."
<P>The hair quickly brightened to orange, leaving two thin black streaks running down the length of it.
<P>"See, that's much better. It goes great with your light orange fur, and your yellow cat-like eyes."
<P>Sam blinked as her vision suddenly turned to black and white. She knew her eyes had now become slitted and yellow, like a tiger's.
<P>"Your shirt is probably itchy, too. You can wear a little tank top instead. Your fur will take care of keeping you warm and covered.
<P>Sam's shirt shrank into a black shell top that showed off a bit of her cleavage and her white midriff.
<P>"It's so gracious of you to let me do this," Trish said softly as she squeezed Sam's furry shoulders. "I think you look terrific. What do you think?"
<P>"I do like it," Sam admitted. "But I think I'm dressed a little skimpy."
<P>"I told you, with the fur--"
<P>"I know, but I still think it's too much."
<P>"You'll thank me later," Trish cooed quietly into Sam's tiger ear. "Oh, and your hair can stop growing now. Knee-length is perfect for you. Now how about a little kitty nose and some fangs to complete the look?"
<P>The changes finished up and Sam stared at her reflection. "It's...I'm...beautiful," she said. She turned to Trish. "I really thought you were going to do something ridiculous to me."
<P>"Nonsense," Trish said. "Welcome to the furry club."</p>
