<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey Dad! That sock is mine, Mom mixed it up in the wash and its that new one I showed you a day or so ago, can I have it back? Also I think this one is yours....&quot; you begin hopping on one foot to remove the magic from your foot. <br />
<br />
Your dad (agonizingly slowly) sits on his bed and begins removing one of the socks. &quot;Yeah.&quot; Dad moves removes your non magic sock and offers it to you. Seeing you&#39;re still fighting on one foot he laid it on the bed. It was obviously yours. but not the one you really wanted!<br />
<br />
Was the transformation triggered by wearing one normal and one other person sock, or by two different people wearing a magic sock, or a mixture of both? How much did you change? Was your voice deeper? Crap. You couldn&#39;t tell... How much taller did you get? <br />
<br />
&quot;The other one too!&quot; you grunt offering an awkward smile. As you gaze on you notice his gray hairs lessen with each second that passes by and wonder how you&#39;re ever possibly going to fix him... The idea of him becoming younger in any other setting is preposterous... maybe you could let him stay like this if its not too obvious. You finally get the magic sock off and feel a wild sense of dizziness and suction as the sock seemed to want to stay on your foot. <br />
<br />
Having only just gotten the socks you never messed with them enough to stop mid transformation before. Was the dizziness normal? Some level of bad? You doubted it would be good.... You lean against the doorframe and easily pull off the other sock wondering why you didn&#39;t use a wall in the first place.<br />
<br />
Dad had pulled the magic sock off by now and was waiting... you walked over and handed him his big sock and took the other three, &quot;Thanks Dad.&quot; you said noticing it sounded more like a grunt... &quot;Appreciate it.&quot; you followed up trying to raise your voice back to normal and succeeding...<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a second&quot; Dad said as you started to try to leave. He stared at you for a long minute, smirked, and then just said. &quot;Okay, you can go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Weirded out you just walked out without a word. That was a really close call, and all because you didn&#39;t hide the socks well enough. You raced back to your room seeking a better hiding spot for your magic socks. Once satisfied you remembered you&#39;d been effected too, not just your dad.<br />
<br />
Going to the bathroom you immediately found why your dad was staring at you funny when you left his room. You were growing a beard! Well maybe that was dramatic... but yesterday your chin had two strands and today dark specks filled your jawline... That was the most obvious change... Your height and weight was probably different but that was less obvious... <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kiddo!&quot; Dad called from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; You called back again noting your normal voice was audibly deeper...<br />
<br />
&quot;I asked you to take out the trash yesterday morning, so now I&#39;m telling you to take it out now...&quot;<br />
<br />
You winced. He was right. This was a show of respect that went both ways. He doesn&#39;t demand you be at his beck and call when the situation allows and you get it done within a reasonable timeframe. Tv shows, movies, video games, can be enjoyed without interruption so long as the task gets addressed, but once forgotten... Drop everything and take care of it immediately. <br />
<br />
Feeling embarrassed and ashamed you went to the kitchen and grabbed the overflowing garbage. You slipped your shoes on while apologizing and trying to not make excuses. He hates conflict and this system is his way of trying to avoid it... The shoes chaffed your feet because you forgot to grab a new pair of socks after finding a hiding spot, and they felt tight, you might be a size 12 like your dad now... another problem to fix...<br />
<br />
You took the garbage out and returned to the kitchen to find your dad relaxing with a cup of coffee... &quot;So son...&quot; he started...<br />
<br />
You fought to remove your shoes; wearing them sockless, and being a tiny bit too small, the insides stuck to your feet. &quot;Uh-Huh?&quot; you grunted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had noticed your beard&#39;s starting to come in...&quot; Dad said taking a sip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, yeah... me too?&quot; you said unsure how to respond... crap, guys don&#39;t start then stop growing facial hair, him noticing your change means reverting back to normal will create a situation too... Then you remembered that you just wore your shoes in this new form... you really were stuck this way! Maybe your old pair of dress shoes? But you hadn&#39;t worn them since... your cousin&#39;s wedding last summer? So be a year younger or (you guess) roughly a year older than you should be... Ugh, and what will everyone else notice changed about you?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you okay? You just got a really weird look on your face...&quot; Dad eyed you carefully...<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yeah, just, uh, a thought crossed my mind, that&#39;s all.&quot; You tried to calm down and act normally, Dad wants to say something... just let him get it out, then you can figure this out...<br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t notice how much you&#39;ve grown up sooner. Obviously, you&#39;ve been shaving for a while and I just want you to know that if you need anything, you can come to me. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve been sneaking in and using my razor?&quot; Dad asked raising his eyebrows in surprise with a smirk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; was all you could get out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren&#39;t in trouble... I&#39;m honestly surprised I hadn&#39;t noticed sooner, it looks like you could almost grow a full beard, at least a chinstrap.&quot; he said quickly. &quot;You don&#39;t have to hide it or be embarrassed. I can get you your own razors if you&#39;d like. I can&#39;t stop you from growing up but I can make it a tiny bit easier.&quot; Dad offered a friendly smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Dad, that&#39;d be great!&quot; You replied. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for using your razor, I just... didn&#39;t want it to show until it wasn&#39;t patchy and weird looking.&quot; You chuckled nervously, uncomfortable lying to your Dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, I felt the same way in high school and it looks like you&#39;re ready to show the world. I&#39;ll pick up some supplies for you but since when did you start drinking coffee? I&#39;m trying to take this in stride but you&#39;re kind of flooring me here.&quot; Dad asked with an awkward chuckle.<br />
<br />
You looked down realizing you had grabbed a cup of coffee and had already drunk half of it... You hated coffee, well, you had hated coffee. Dad drank pots of it throughout the day, obviously the socks gave you one of your dad&#39;s mannerisms and you hadn&#39;t even noticed what you were doing. &quot;You like it so much, I figured I&#39;d like it too... It&#39;s taken some getting used to but it&#39;s okay.&quot; lying again.<br />
<br />
Dad chuckled and shook his head. &quot;God they grow up so fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
The conversation done, you finish the last few gulps of coffee and rinse out the mug putting it in the dish strainer for later use, just like your dad does... Turning back to him you take a moment to try to appraise how different he is from this morning and aside from a few less grays and wrinkles he looks much the same though younger... He can probably be left as is and it could be discounted as him looking livelier or well rested... probably? There is the rest of him beyond his face... Are his arms less muscular? He looks slimmer. And did he pick up any of your mannerisms? How would that play out? Has he noticed yet?</p>
