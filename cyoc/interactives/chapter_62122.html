<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oooh, cool, a bewt!&quot; cooed a lyrical voice.  <br />
<br />
Both Konstantine and Tim jumped. Behind them in Tim's room was a lithe long haired pale skinned creature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get passed us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm your new room mate, sillies,&quot; the slight creature laughed, &quot;Though I guess I shouldn't have sneaked up on <br />
you.  I shade instinctively, and must have been a shadow when I came into the room.  Is the bewt yours human <br />
or yours plantman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plantman?&quot; Tim asked turning to look at Konstanine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I'm sorry, you were just getting introduced. I'm Fa'ie Kur Vyl, and you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Konstanine and I am only partly herbaceous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't that what I said?  Plantmen are partly herbaceous right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plantmen put down roots and are covered with bark and leaves.  My great grandfather was a Plantman.  I am <br />
what they call a sprout man - mostly human, but with a bit of the herbal magic still residing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaah, see that's why I'm at college to learn things. And I just learned something, sproutman, thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, and you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim. But how can you be our room mate - this is the boys' dormitory?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nix. Tim, he's a he, not a she.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's okay, it's happened more than once already. Tim have you never seen a wraith fairy before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've never even heard of one- what's that?  Is that what you are? You're a guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
The lithe creature literally doubled over with laughter. &quot;Oh, stop, stop,you're killing me. Let me guess <br />
neither of your parents have magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one in my family does, but I guess because I'm the seventh son of the seventh son of the seventh son, I <br />
got lucky.&quot;<br />
<br />
The musical laughter stopped suddenly, and the wraith fairy shrieked and leapt to the far corner of the <br />
ceiling above the bewt.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did I say?  And how are you clinging to the ceiling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wraith fairies are very powerful practically immortal creatures,&quot; explained Konstanine, &quot;They have the power <br />
to bend nearly all of nature, time and space to their will.  With the exception of seventh sons of Adam, and <br />
you are a seventh son thrice over, I've never met one before and I daresay Fa'ie hasn't either.  He's <br />
positively terrified. Look at those 3 inch fangs he sprouted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, Fa'ie, I didn't mean to scare you.  Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never heard of a wraith fairy before today?&quot; hissed Fa'ie through his needle-like fangs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never.  Like I said my whole family's human. No magic in the lot.  That's why they send me here to learn to <br />
control what I've got.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Learn to control it?  But if you can't control it, if you can't cast spells, how did you ever pass the <br />
entrance exam?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He passed admirably.  Didn't answer a single question right, but when the proctor looked as his paper, he <br />
said to Tim, &quot;The only way you're getting into a wizard's school is if you transport us all there right now.&quot;  <br />
And he did, the entire group of students, and the building we were taking the exam in - you passed it when you <br />
checked in with the registrar,&quot; said the latest addition to their group. <br />
<br />
&quot;How would you know?&quot; challenged the wraith fairy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you were there. I am sorry, I really wanted to go to the Wizard University, you see. I guess, the proctor <br />
only meant to transport the people in the classroom and not the entire school building. Bet the first thing <br />
they'll teach me is how to put that building back where it belongs,&quot; Tim laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did the building come from and what is it made of?&quot; asked the wraith fairy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's mostly steel and glass and concrete.  It was a new building at a community college in Oregon - the <br />
United States.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeek. All that iron!  But no one can magic that much iron - not even dwarves and they'd have to hammer it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that's why he's here because he moved the whole place with his mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait. An entire building went missing from a US college and no one noticed?&quot; Konstanine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The proctor was the Illustrious Emeritus Professor of Illusions.  The building appears to still be there, but <br />
with its all wrapped in yellow tape and marked BIO HAZARD SITE - QUARANTINED BY ORDER OF CDC.  I attended art <br />
classes at the Community College. And the Art Studio Building was next door to it.   The nerds are royally <br />
pissed, it supposed to have top notch science labs on the upper floors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so what kind of art do you do? Paint, sculpt, draw or something else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I was the life model,&quot; he said somewhat sheepishly.<br />
<br />
The wraith fairy's eyes glittered with green light, &quot;Demonstrate what that is,&quot; he snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you shouldn't do that!&quot; Konstanin shouted.<br />
<br />
Dreamily the newcomer drawled, &quot;Sure thing, mister. A life model is the nude model that the art students draw. <br />
It's fucking boring, and cold sitting there naked for an hour or more, but the pay is incredible.  Twenty <br />
students each pay $15 for to be their model, so I make $300 a class. Nice body isn't it?&quot; he seemed proud and <br />
unaware that he had just stripped naked in front of his new room mates.<br />
<br />
He blinked.  Looked down at his nudity, and gasped. He grabbed up his clothing covering his crotch, and <br />
covered his bum with his shoes as he made his quiet exit. Muffled sobs could be heard as he retreated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you do that, wraith fairy?&quot; Tim asked angrily.  He had accepted the new fellow who seemed now kind of <br />
intoxicated as his friend and he wasn't liking the long toothed creature on the ceiling too much right then.<br />
<br />
&quot;What of it, hooman?&quot; he snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wish you knew how it felt to experience what you just did to him! And I wish he was here to see it!&quot; <br />
Tim said closing his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; shouted Konstanine.<br />
<br />
The wraith fairy shrieked.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did I get back in here?&quot; the newcomer asked. He was just buckling his belt and was barefoot and <br />
shirtless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unbridled, irresponsible magic. Just roommates getting acquainted,&quot; said Konstanine with a shrug.<br />
<br />
The fairy was off the ceiling and staggering like a drunk in the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is how it feels, huh?  Actually, it's quite pleasant. I bet I could be a life model too. All I have <br />
to do is sit still naked, right?&quot; Fa'ie asked as he pulled off his tight clothing. He was lithe, and <br />
definitely male. &quot;So what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the spell ended. Fa'ie burst into tears and sat on the floor pulling his clothing toward him.<br />
<br />
Tim rushed over, and put a hand on Fa'ie's shoulder.  &quot;I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, but you were so mean. You <br />
spelled him first.  I guess, I am gaining control just by doing. I wish your clothes were back on you, Fa'ie. <br />
I hope you will forgive me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fa'ie burst into lyric laughter. He was dressed again, sort of.  His arms were inside his trousers, and his <br />
head was sticking out his fly, and his shirt covered his legs. &quot;It's a good thing I have thin legs or my shirt <br />
would have been ruined. I am sorry, when our kind gets spooked our hormones go wild.  I guess putting me under <br />
my own comehither spell calmed me down a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Comehither? You comehithered me?&quot; asked the half naked stranger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry is it Tom or Tim or Tony?  I can't quite read your aura?  I did and I'm sorry,&quot; the wraith fairy <br />
answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's James. Tim must have quite an aura if his extends all the way over here.  Guess that's why it's hard to <br />
read.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;James?&quot; the wraith fairy turned to look over her shoulder at Tim, &quot;Tim?  Your aura extends at least 10 feet <br />
in every direction. How is that possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My aura?&quot; Tim asked looking down at his hands, and around the room to see what the wraith fairy was talking <br />
about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind. You'll learn about it in Magics 100,&quot; Fa'ie said with a sigh. &quot;All this magic has made me hungry. <br />
Do you think the cafeteria's open yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Sorry, the program said that meal service commences tomorrow at breakfast, and today we're on our own at <br />
the town.  They requested magical restraint too,&quot; said Konstantine reading from a parchment that he extracted <br />
from his orientation packet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, can I treat you to something to eat?  All of you?&quot; asked Tim, &quot;I'm afraid I got off on the wrong foot <br />
with you all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wrong foot!&quot; howled Fa'ie with laughter as he waved his trouser clad arms around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want me to try again?&quot; Tim asked helpfully.<br />
<br />
Konstantine stepped between the wraith fairy and human, &quot;No, no. You don't want to do it. Next time instead of <br />
upside down, you might put them inside him.&quot;<br />
<br />
There a stifled yelp from the wraith fairy. Green and dark purple lights sparkled, and the wraith fairy was <br />
dressed again but instead of green, this time the outfit was black and purple with a green sash and green <br />
shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need.  But if you're serious about feeding me. Bewts are delicious barbecued,&quot; Fa'ie said eyeing Devin.<br />
<br />
The bewt suddenly flapped madly against the glass shrieking wildly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like he understands you,&quot; Konstantine commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Never mind about eating him.  He's obviously a trained pet.  I bet one of the shops in town sells bewts <br />
on stick.  It's a very popular dish in the Murkwood.  Did you train the bewt yourself?  I didn't think they <br />
were teachable?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Devin was a gift,&quot; Tim said, &quot;But I plan to take over his training. Maybe make him a familiar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Familiar?&quot; Fa'ie said in a confused tone, &quot;A bewt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's human, not wraith fairy, little one. I'm kind of hungry too. Let's take Tim up on his generous offer of <br />
a meal,&quot; Konstantine said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; said James, &quot;Let me finished getting dressed. No, Tim, I can do it myself,&quot; James said dashing <br />
from the room.  This was all too much for him. His room mates were all freaks.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Fa'ie tell me what it's like to be a wraith fairy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me what it's like to be human, Tim?&quot; Fa'ie challenged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't we just talk about our lives at home, that will probably be illustrative enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, did you say you were hungry?  I thought plants just ate sunlight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm only 1/8th plantman remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Right,&quot; Fa'ie nodded, &quot;And you're really seventh son, Tim?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, do you need to ask after that demonstration?&quot; James said re-entering, &quot;I'm ready to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim patted his wallet in his pocket, and locked his room behind him. He closed his eyes and concentrated.  Woe <br />
to anyone other than Tim who tried to pass through that threshold.<br />
<br />
Fa'ie grabbed his head.  &quot;What did you just do, Tim?&quot; he asked accusingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a little security spell of my own design,&quot; Tim confessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That much power?  Anyone who triggers it is likely to create a crater where our dorm building use to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want me to-&quot; Tim started reaching for the door handle.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, leave it. I'll spell the suite door. Anything that can get pass my spell deserves to be vaporized.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it's not a vaporization spell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not?  Well, whatever it's supposed to do it will do, but it will also vaporize right afterward, it's <br />
just charged with too much power.  Not even the mystic crystal emits that much energy at once,&quot; Fa'ie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Fa'ie, I don't want to end up vaporized, so make sure that any of us can enter our room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Konstantine, I didn't realize you were part plant. Of course, you can have the southern exposure room. <br />
I'll move my stuff to one of the other rooms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you that would be great. For a moment I was afraid you were going to remodel the building so my room <br />
had a southern exposure too,&quot; laughed Konstantine.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a great idea!&quot; said Tim. He closed his eyes tightly and said, &quot;All of can have a southern view of the <br />
fountain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; shrieked Fa'ie as he grabbed his head and doubled over in pain. James and Konstantine caught him. They <br />
stared at Tim. They heard an awful creaking and crashing as the stones and mortar shifted. The main room was <br />
longer and narrower now and opened on to four separate identical rooms.<br />
<br />
Fa'ie sat on the floor rubbing his temples. &quot;Do me a favor and don't stand so close to me next time you do <br />
that!&quot; he whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry. I didn't realize my magic hurt you like that. But what do you think. We each have identical rooms <br />
now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice, but don't you think someone will notice the change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What change?  I just willed that it was this way when they built it. You were near me so your perceived the <br />
change but I doubt anyone else will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eek. Now I understand why wraith fairies are at odds with seventh sons!  They have the same manipulative <br />
powers!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, turn James back to white!&quot; snapped Tim.<br />
<br />
&quot;White?  But James is Korean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I always have been Korean,&quot; James explained.  He was now thinner and his skin had a golden hue and his hair <br />
was jet black.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, he wasn't. Make him back the way he was!&quot; Tim demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Relax, I was just demonstrating. You're impervious to any changes a wraith fairy makes, if you know <br />
what it was before. I could change the man walking down the hall, and since you can't see him and don't know <br />
him, you shouldn't notice the difference,&quot; Fa'ie said standing in the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever. Turn him back first and make it so he remembers what you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
James' shoulders broadened.  His hair lightened to dirty blond. His brown eyes turned green, and his skin <br />
became white again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What just happened?  And why do I know what kim chee tastes like? And why do I crave it - you changed my <br />
racial heritage?  My parents, grandparents and all my ancestors?&quot; roared James suddenly furious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change Konstantine back too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Change me? But I haven't changed.  I'm still one eighth plantman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was your great grandfather?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was a lumberjack that's how he met my great grandmother, she was a plantman. But I told you that already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you said your great grandfather was the tree man or plantman,&quot; Tim said.<br />
<br />
Konstantine glared at the fairy boy, &quot;Did you change my lineage?  My family history?  Family means everything <br />
to plantmen!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, everything goes back to normal. Calm down. I just was testing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I understand now why they made the wraith fairy and the seventh son roommates,&quot; laughed James. &quot;I bet <br />
your folks sent you here to learn restraint and self control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you the clever one? Well, I can play fair when it comes to my flatmates,&quot; Fa'ie said. &quot;There <br />
everything's back to normal.  Satisfied?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Put their dicks back too,&quot; said Tim with a sigh, &quot;What are you gay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you're the crotch watcher who noticed James' extra inches and Konstantine's loss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait. You mean I haven't always had a fourteen inch cock?  But I remember my first time, I could only get a <br />
third of it inside her,&quot; James said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I always thought my two inch dick was too small,&quot; Konstantine said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a crotch watcher, but whatever you change seemed to create warp around the object you change. Maybe <br />
that's the aura you were talking about earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't see the aura, but you can see the skew?  Incredible, this time no tricks, no tests. Everyone in <br />
this room is just as they were.&quot;<br />
<br />
A collective sigh of relief rose up as Tim confirmed that everything looked normal now.</p>
