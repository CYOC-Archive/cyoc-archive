<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason Tungsten walked through the automatic doors of the local mall. While <br />
this might have seemed uneventful to some, it was a rare experience for Jason. <br />
You see, Jason's family was rich. His dad owned about seven precious metal <br />
mines across the world and his mom was the daughter of the owner of a large <br />
hotel chain, not to mention her numerous fashion lines. <br />
<br />
However, unlike the unattentive rich parents on TV, Jason's parents were <br />
extremely overprotective. For the most part, Jason was kept isolated from <br />
others his age. His parents feared he would get kidnapped or bullied, so he was <br />
kept either in their huge mansion and on its hundred acres of private land or on <br />
the small island they had bought in the Pacific for their vacation home. <br />
<br />
This week, though, both of his parents were out of town and, understanding his <br />
desires, his assistant / bodyguard / best friend had allowed him to go to the mall <br />
alone. He would sit outside in the car where Jason could easily call him with a <br />
wristband homing beacon that his parents had forced him to wear. <br />
<br />
Upon entering the building, Jason was awestruck at how many people were in <br />
one place at the same time. He saw couples and families and groups of other <br />
teenagers all enjoying their time at the mall. Tentatively, Jason took his first few <br />
steps into the mall and stepped to the side in order to avoid being swept away <br />
by the crowds. He walked along the wall in order to keep his sense of direction <br />
and headed toward the closest store he saw, a music store. <br />
<br />
Jason's parents had read about classical music making babies smart and taken <br />
it to heart. Jason had never heard rock, country, pop, rap, oldies, blues, or any <br />
other type of music. He was amazed at all the CDs and albums of people he <br />
had never heard of but were clearly famous. He walked over to a sampling <br />
machine and put the headphones on. Pressing the first button provided a <br />
smooth and calming jazz selection; the second button, a classic rock ballad; the <br />
third, a fiddling bluegrass tune; the fourth, the street beat of an oldschool rap; <br />
and so on until his mind nearly exploded with all of the new possibilites and <br />
styles. <br />
<br />
After that, Jason walked next door to an arcade where a congregation of <br />
teenage boys was gathering around two more playing a game on two systems <br />
side by side. He tried to squeeze in to watch, but was rejected from the group of <br />
entranced teens. He walked over to a large box with glass sides and various <br />
prizes inside. A claw hung from the top of the box and descended upon the <br />
prizes whenever someone played. The boy in front of him tried to grab a DVD <br />
stuck in a corner, but the claw slipped off the plastic coating. When the boy <br />
stepped off to the side to fish some more change out of his pocket, Jason <br />
stepped up and put some quarters in. He moved the joystick around the box, <br />
amazed at the mechanics of the game. He brought the claw back over to the <br />
DvD and dropped it with the red button. The claw wrapped around the corner of <br />
the movie where the plastic was scrunched up and returned the case to the <br />
prize slot. Just as the other boy pulled an empty hand out of his pocket with <br />
disappointment on his face, Jason reached in, took the DVD, and handed it to <br />
the boy. The boy's eyes grew wide with happiness and he went to thank Jason, <br />
but he was already walking out the door, heading towards the food court. <br />
<br />
Jason walked past a sandwich shop where a man was holding a plate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here, kid, try our California Chicken Wrap!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jason accepted the food-on-toothpick with a &quot;thank you&quot; and walked away, <br />
munching on the sweet and spicy snack. All of this was starting to overwhelm <br />
him, so he started towards a more spacious area. It appeared to be an indoor <br />
park with trees, a fountain, and benches. Not many people were sitting there <br />
yet, as it was still early in the morning. Jason finished the wrap and threw the <br />
toothpick away before sitting on one of the benches. He continued to look <br />
around at the numerous shops and stores and all of the people when he <br />
noticed a tall black box in a corner of the rest area.<br />
<br />
Jason got up and walked over to it. It was just a large black box with a door. <br />
The handle was white and there were some white ornate designs on the box, <br />
but it was otherwise unmarked. Jason knocked on the door, but there was no <br />
answer. He turned the knob and found that it was unlocked and open. He <br />
stepped inside and the door latched behind him. The inside of the box was <br />
much more technical than the outside. Several cameras peeked out of the walls <br />
and a large screen was on the one in front of him.<br />
<br />
The screen flicked on and a title &quot;Welcome to Trans-Booth&quot; appeared. After a <br />
loading symbol appeared and spun a couple times, the title moved to the top of <br />
the screen and shrunk along with a new sub-title that read &quot;Fulfilling Your <br />
Transformative Needs&quot;. The screen was now dominated by a large green <br />
button that said BEGIN. Jason touched the screen on the button and it <br />
disappeared, replaced by the word &quot;Scanning...&quot;. <br />
<br />
The booth was suddenly filled with green light as a laser line appeared and <br />
moved up Jason's body from toe to head. When it was done, the screen split <br />
into two. On one side, there appeared a picture of Jason, although completely <br />
naked, and on the other, a list of options. <br />
<br />
Jason was amazed at the machine's ability to scan his whole body with clothes <br />
on. He took a moment to study his digital avatar, making sure all the features <br />
were correct. The picture was a perfect replica of Jason. He was a 16-year-old <br />
boy with light brown, almost blonde, hair cropped short and straight. His eyes <br />
were a saphire blue and his skin a golden tan from spending a lot of time on the <br />
beach. His body was halfway through puberty, his muscles lean and strong, <br />
having lost their baby fat long ago. He was slim and lithe, his young body strong <br />
and smooth from constant exercise and surfing. His muscles were starting to <br />
gain definition and a six-pack was clearly visible. He was completely hairless, <br />
however, and his tan line was visible where his shorts stopped. He noticed that <br />
even his junk was detailed. His cock and balls were quite large for his age and <br />
he was uncut. <br />
<br />
Everything seemed to be in order, so Jason turned his attention to the other <br />
side of the screen. It read:<br />
<br />

• Age Regression<br />

• Size (Shrinking / Growing)<br />
• Transgender<br />
• Other<br />
   - Preset<br />
   - Random<br />
• Exit<br />
<br />
Jason didn't understand what most of these meant, so he randomly chose...</p>
