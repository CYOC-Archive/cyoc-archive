<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty sighed as he quickly went to find the bathroom of his new house, entering and smiling at the massive bathroom with a luxurious shower fit that took up a good fourth of the room. Ty was quick to pull the tight bikini off him and place the underwear on the counter before turning on the hot water for the shower before smiling and looking at the full body mirror in the bathroom.<br />
He was still completely male aside from the one area it counted and Ty was quick to sigh before looking at the shower, where steam was filling the top of the fully enclosed space. Stepping away from the mirror and opening the shower door Ty stepped in and closed the shower door behind him before making another wish. &#39;I wish this shower is watertight, there is no drain and the door is seal to prevent water from getting out.&#39; Ty thought as he looked down at the shower drain, which disappeared as the door sealed behind him. &#39;I wish that I was unaffected by the temperature of water.&#39; Ty thought, doing the this to prevent himself from getting burned by the hot water as he ducked under the spraying water and sighed in relief as the heat washed over him and the hot water soothed him. The shower was so big he could comfortably lay down on the floor and have more than enough extra room to move.<br />
And lay down he did as Ty quickly laid on the floor and rolled over, letting the water roll across his back as the water slowly built up on the floor of the shower. &#39;I wish that I had gills.&#39; Ty quickly thought, knowing that if the water got high enough he wouldn&#39;t be able to breath as small silts opened on the sides of his neck. Ty sighed as he closed his eyes, feeling the water slowly rise around him in the shower before thinking about something. &#39;I&#39;ve got a vagina, I&#39;ve got gills... might as well slowly go all the way.&#39; Ty thought before making his wish in his head. &#39;I wish that I would slowly become a girl before slowly becoming a mermaid.&#39; Ty thought as he closed his eyes and sighed. <br />
The hot water around him slowly built up until it had reached his neck, the gills on his neck taking on water as Ty smiled while laying his head on his arms, feeling the air from the water rush into lungs as his body slowly started to shift. Ty&#39;s adam&#39;s apple was quick to disappear, his voice rising in pitch even though he didn&#39;t know it as Ty quickly stood up and turned the heat of the water down before quickly laying back down to enjoy the water as he let it rise.<br />
Closing his eyes Ty slowly drifted off to sleep and his body slowly slimmed down towards female proportions. Any muscle he had was slowly going away as the water rose up to his face, completely covering his arms as water flowed into his nose. Ty started coughing as he sat up before sighing in his new female voice. &#39;I wish that I breathed through my gills only and that I didn&#39;t have a nose.&#39; Ty complained in his head as his nose shriveled up on his face before disappearing for good, leaving his face with just his mouth and eyes as Ty quickly lay down in the water to let water flush into his gills and lungs. &#39;Lovely...&#39; Ty complained in his head, realizing he had just made himself a water breather only before just accepting it, knowing he could fix it later. The water was quickly rising to the point where it was above his neck, completely covering his gills as Ty once again fell asleep under the water. <br />
His body was still changing as the water rose above most of his body, leaving him underwater as his body finished sliming down, his waist having caved in as small mounds formed on his chest. By the time those mounds had grown to small A cup breasts he was completely underwater, his hair starting to float in the water as his legs and arms shrunk down to petite feminine limbs. By the time her breasts had reached nice and perky C cups the water in the shower had half filled the shower and she was starting to float in the water as her hips bloated and her ass expanded. Her changes into a full female finally finished with her breasts growing to D-cups, her hair long and silky and her body very petit and beautiful as Ty moaned before opening her eyes as the shower finished filling with water, Ty swimming down to the tap and turning the shower off as she floated underwater before opening her mouth.<br />
Bubbles floated out of her mouth as water filled her body, but Ty didn&#39;t care as her body had adapted for underwater life. Wide awake Ty tapped the space on her face where her nose had shrunk into and tapped it, feeling nothing but skin as Ty started blowing bubbles with her mouth. <br />
Ty giggled as she did a flip underwater in the filled shower, her next set of changes starting as Ty felt a tingling in her ears. Her eyes sealed up before slowly flattening out and growing blue scales. Her ears turning into fins as most of the sound dulled out. Ty stretching underwater as her hands started to change, webbing growing between her fingers and toes as scales started spread across her legs. Her legs started to pull together as Ty giggled underwater, bubbles floating out of her mouth before she felt her spine start to extend and her legs started to merge. It was actually rather pleasurable as her legs were completely overtaken by scales and covering her vagina as her legs completely merged, leaving only her feet before they grew out into a tail and leaving her a complete mermaid.<br />
Ty giggled as she looked at her tail before flipping underwater, her change had finished and now she needed to figure out to work.</p>
