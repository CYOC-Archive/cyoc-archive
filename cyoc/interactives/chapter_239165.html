<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer was really starting to hate her luck. The D20 had yet again won against her. Seventeen was not an okay number. By no rights did it equate to the possible chaos of a Nat 20, but it was enough to do something very terrible. She could only wonder what was in store as Abby picked the die up from the ground.<br />
&quot;Huh, definitely feels like mine,&quot; said Abby. &quot;I wonder how someone else got it. Unless Jen was lying to me last week. Ugh, she can be so irritating.&quot;<br />
&#39;So can you, sis. So can you,&#39; Jennifer thought.<br />
&quot;I need one for tonight anyway. That dungeon is gonna be sick!&quot; With that, Abby left the bathroom, the die in tow.<br />
&quot;Shit.&quot; Jennifer slammed her hand on the thin wall. She needed that die if she wished to keep things under her control, and now her sister had it. And she was going to use it that night. &quot;Of all people, and of all times, too. Why did it- Huh?&quot; Jennifer paused her frustrations as she felt a new heat take over her body. It went from head to toe and seemed to burn consistently throughout her. Crawling out of the space, Jennifer felt... off. Again. It&#39;s like things were at a different angle.<br />
A quick glance at the mirror confirmed her suspicions. The newest addition, as a seventeen, was seventeen inches, or a 1&#39;5&quot; of height added onto her. Now, she was a pretty decent height already; being 6&#39;3 was a blessing in her books. It was &#39;Dutch blood&#39; according to her mother, who had heritage from Amsterdam. Considering she was already tall, gaining more than a foot of height was about to complicate things.<br />
Jennifer felt herself inch upwards bit by bit. Her skirt was getting tighter now, and her cock heads were almost on show. Her bra over her upper breasts dug in while her top battled against the strain. Up and up, reaching higher, her body chugged on. It felt amazing to her, as most of her nerve endings were increasing in size and amount. Rips were heard as her shirt wanted to give in to the chest area. Her cleavage showed through the wide neckline, while below, the skirt had lifted enough to see the curve of her penis tip poking down. Even her shoes got tighter and started squishing her toes in. She crunched over as the last stages of her change went by. Then it stopped.<br />
When it was finally over, Jennifer stood straight up. And hit her head on a hanging light panel. She winced in surprise and held her head with her upper arms. while her other two supported her leaning on the wall.<br />
&quot;Oh fuck. If I do the math correctly, I was at 6&#39;3&quot; before this. And the die added seventeen onto what I was. Those add up to...&quot; Her face paled at the solution. &quot;...7&#39;8.&quot; She held her hands to her mouth. &quot;I can&#39;t be- Oh god, I am! Shit, I shouldn&#39;t have left that there. Damn it!&quot; She kicks a bucket leaning in the corner, sending it flying down the stalls.<br />
Jennifer needed to catch up with Abby quickly. Unfortunately, she was leaving the school during the final block when Jennifer was stuck inside. Meaning she would have to sneak out to get back home. If it wasn&#39;t her teacher or friends seeing her, it would be someone down at the office. Taking a deep breath, as well as fixing her clothing, Jennifer left the bathroom, quietly ascending the stairs. Her perception was off, as now everything was over a foot lower than her eyesight. She peeked around both corners. The way to her class had several stragglers, while the other way, towards an exit, had no one standing nearby. Taking her chance, she booked it outside. She hadn&#39;t noticed that Rose, Abby&#39;s one friend and a classmate of Jen&#39;s, had seen her slip out. Or that she had been visually confused about Jen&#39;s height. And the two weird protrusions beneath the girl&#39;s skirt.<br />
Outside on the sidewalk, Jennifer sped walk. She was more spry, as her long legs and gait made her steps huge. It took only a moment to spot her sister making her way down the street toward their house. At the same time, however, a familiar hoodie caught Jennifer&#39;s attention. &#39;Kyle&#39; or his look-alike was heading in the opposite direction, possibly in the way of his own home. She needed him to reverse the curse, but priorities won out, and her sister having the D20 was significantly worse than being rejected by Kyle. Looking one last time in his general direction, Jen lagged along after Abby&#39;s trail.<br />
When she got back to the house, Jennifer found that her sister was already getting things started. There was a board set up on the living room table, and snacks were laid out for the taking. Abby usually DM&#39;ed, meaning she hosted the parties. Jennifer knew that wouldn&#39;t go well; Abby&#39;s pals were blabbermouths and would rat on just about anyone. More people made it more likely to be found. And they were the last people Jen wanted to find her like she was. She needed to act quickly. Leaving the downstairs, she crept up the stairs to their rooms. Her increased height made her head brush the ceiling, and she hit the light fixture with her forehead. She groaned and kept moving, occasionally listening to the house for audio cues from her sister. Sure enough, she heard movement in the bathroom. Jen thought she forgot something about the room for a moment, before continuing on. She stopped again when she remembered she forgot to clean up the shower! &#39;SHIT.&#39; Her mind snowballed into the possible things that Abby may ask her in the close future, like why there was so much semen on the inside of the shower, or why all of their toiletries were knocked over. Dropping her thoughts, she carried on to her sister&#39;s room.<br />
Abby had left her school stuff packed in her bag on her bed. Scowering through the items, she found no die. &#39;There wasn&#39;t one on the table downstairs, so Abby would have placed it somewhere in here,&#39; Jennifer thought. She browsed the desktop, finding only empty pop cans and candy bars next to her monitor and computer case. The drawers held nothing of note. Any shelf space she had was occupied by something else, so no dice there. After searching the place top to bottom, Jennifer found nothing. Until she remembered how klutzy Abby sometimes was, and where stuff usually wound up. Bending down a ways, she peeked under her sister&#39;s bed.<br />
She wished she had been relieved when she found it. But to Jennifer&#39;s dismay, it was under the bed, and it had been rolled again. It may have tumbled off the bed when Abby placed down the bag, or if she had just put it close to the edge. In any case, there was a new number on top. The number was...</p>
