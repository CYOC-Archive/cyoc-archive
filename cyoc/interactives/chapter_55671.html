<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen found that playing with her new body was both addictive and exhausting; it wasn't long before she curled up on the couch to take a nap.  School was simply not a concern; she lived for pleasure now.<br />
<br />
She woke up sometime after lunch, and she was -hungry-.  The strange thing is, she didn't feel any emptiness in her stomach, although it was deliciously flat to the touch.<br />
<br />
No, the need was centered on her crotch...her pussy to be exact.  Both of them.  There was a tightness, and realized no amount of masturbation would sate this hunger.<br />
<br />
She needed a girl, and badly.  The problem, however, was, without a head, she couldn't speak!  That jerk Kyle; he'd figured out a good way to avoid her from using the curse!<br />
<br />
Then again, he'd given her the power to transform the people she had sex with.  Of course, she had a lot less interest in guys, so again, he was mostly safe from her retribution...oh fuck this, she needed someone to eat her out, and now!<br />
<br />
But if she couldn't talk, what could she do?  Stick her pussy in a girl's face?  Come to think about it, without a tongue, pleasing another girl would be hard...<br />
<br />
No wait.  Kyle had said she could talk.  But how?  She tried, but nothing seemed to happen.  She switched her perspective a few times, but nothing seemed to help, and now her hunger was almost painful in it's intensity!<br />
<br />
If this kept up, she'd end up attacking the first girl she saw!<br />
<br />
Getting dressed (after cleaning herself up; certain parts of her body were a little sticky), she grabbed her keys and went to her car.  You'd think people would be disturbed at the sight of a headless girl driving down the road, but she didn't even get a strange look.<br />
<br />
Actually, the cool air brushing past her new pussy felt pretty good, and went a long way towards easing her intense need.  At the stoplight, she noticed a younger girl walking down the street.  The girl looked vaguely familiar...oh yeah, she was a Freshman.<br />
<br />
Olivia something.  A little young, but was really cute, with short black hair and glasses...<br />
<br />
Jen parked her car and got out, walking up behind Olivia, who didn't seem to notice.  Jen tried to talk, but nothing.  Finally she tried to yell in frustration.<br />
<br />
*HEY!*<br />
<br />
Olivia whirled.  &quot;What the hell is the big idea sneaking up on me, you headless bimbo slut!?&quot;<br />
<br />
If Jen had eyes, she would have blinked.  *You heard me!*<br />
<br />
Olivia frowned.  Something wasn't right about this.  &quot;Yes, I heard you.  Although...I'm not sure how...&quot;<br />
<br />
*I need your help!*<br />
<br />
Olivia took a deep breath.  &quot;I know this is going to be hell for me, either from you, or your pack of pretty social rejects, but you can go to hell, Princess.  I hate you, I hate everything about you, and you can stick your stupid jokes up your vagina.  Either one of them!&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned and started to walk away.<br />
<br />
Jen wanted to cry.  Of course, she couldn't do that anymore.  She -had- been a bitch...and honestly, she couldn't think of a single reason why!  <br />
<br />
But then she felt the need rise.  She ran up and grabbed Olivia, who made a squeak of surprise.  *I need you so badly!*<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, let me go you headless freak!&quot;  Olivia struggled, but the freshman was a tiny thing, and Jen was a tall, well-toned cheerleader.<br />
<br />
*I can't help myself, I'm so sorry, but I need you!&quot;  Jen put her hands on Olivia's chest.  To her surprise, the girl was better endowed than she'd thought, and Olivia's nipples immediately got hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rape!  I'm being raped by a pussy-headed monster!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh shit.  She had to shut Olivia up, and fast!  But how?<br />
<br />
*Transform or Dare?!*<br />
<br />
&quot;...what?  Are you serious?  There's no such thing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer wished she could smile.  *Sorry, you get both!*<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.  There's no such thing as a curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
*Oh and I'm sure you can explain how a girl can have a pussy instead of a head and live?*<br />
<br />
That gave Olivia pause.  &quot;Holy shit, are you serious?  You were cursed to be like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
*Yes, and worse, I need sex so badly it hurts!*<br />
<br />
&quot;...you poor thing.  Wait, you want to have sex with me?&quot;  Olivia blinked.  <br />
<br />
*God yes!  You're so cute!*<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know...I mean...this could be a joke...&quot;  Olivia stopped struggling, and Jen noticed she didn't seem upset at having her breasts groped either.<br />
<br />
*Please?!  Don't make me dare you to have sex with me!*<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, come on, my house isn't far.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was too worked up to drive, so she held onto Olivia's hand as she led her down the street.  Olivia seemed to be more than a little excited as she fumbled with her keys, opening her door.<br />
<br />
It was a nice-looking home, and Jen wondered what Olivia's family was like.  Within minutes, she was in the younger girl's room, which was very neat.  There was a new computer, some anime posters, and some stuffed animals on a shelf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...so how do we do this?  I mean, I've read some books and watched some videos, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen unbuttoned her jeans and slid them down her legs.  She slipped out of her shoes and socks, and stepped out of her jeans.  *Take my panties off*<br />
<br />
Olivia's eyes were wide, but she slowly reached forward and tugged at Jen's panties, sliding them down.  &quot;Ok..now what?&quot;<br />
<br />
*I need you to eat me out.*<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew...I don't know...&quot;  Olivia sighed for a moment.  &quot;Jen, I want to help you, but I've only been curious up til now.  So you're going to dare me into being hot for you.  I mean, your body is sexy, but the head thing...it's too weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
*Are you sure?*<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  Do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
*Ok.  And thank you so much!  Olivia, I dare you to be intensely attracted to me!*<br />
<br />
Olivia blinked.  Then a lazy smile formed on her face.  She kneeled down and opened Jen up with her fingers.  &quot;Wow, that's one powerful curse.&quot;  She sniffed.  &quot;Did you smell this good before, or is it all in my head?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen shivered.  *Please?*<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry, of course.&quot;  Olivia pressed her face against Jen's crotch, and began probing the older girl with her tongue.  Unfortunately, while Olivia was enthusiastic, she wasn't very good at pleasing another girl.<br />
<br />
*Fuck!  Olivia, for your transformation, you will gain all the knowledge you need to be my perfect lesbian lover!*<br />
<br />
Olivia paused, and then she did something with her tongue that made Jen's legs tremble.  Oh God, that felt so amazing!  <br />
<br />
*Ah, I can't stand up when you do that!*<br />
<br />
&quot;Then come to bed, beautiful.&quot;  Olivia smiled seductively as she guided Jen to her bed...</p>
