<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You six have made fun of one another,  in a pattern so bizarre that it simply couldn't be overlooked by my <br />
boss.&quot; said the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;It appears it has begun&quot; Said as Curtis began to twitch. &quot;Curtis, you are a narcissit and a racist, therefore <br />
you shall live Julius life, but with every henious comment reverted back to you, and that goes for everyone <br />
here. You Julius had envied how Dylan could sweet talk his way into any girl panties, but you couldn't, Dylan <br />
you have always being a jerk to Jake, just because he is smarter than you, Jake you can't forgive a prank <br />
Scott did you in third grade, since then you have harbored a resentment against him, Scott you envy Seb <br />
because of how he can easily sweet talk his way out of almost any trouble. And finally you Seb, friend of all <br />
as you are, you are sickened by Curtis narcissist, and even began the rumor of his homosexuality, because you <br />
were raised to recognize and dispise it, and you honestly believe him to be the case.&quot; By the end of his <br />
speech everyone was feeling the tremors. &quot;Now turn into what you have come to loathe!&quot;<br />
<br />
Their heads began to rang with the memories of what have they calling the other, deafining them in madness and <br />
making them dread as realization would soon hit them hard. <br />
<br />
When they realized they have been freed from their bonds, although they were also freed from their underwear, <br />
however as the pain of every insult they had ever said recoiled inside their heads, their nudity came as the <br />
last of their concerns.<br />
<br />
Curtis was the first to feel the effects but it was Seb the first to see the effects, his skin began to <br />
decolor, as his dark hair lightened and became curlier, his muscle mass became less developed and more <br />
defined, making him look slimmer, then his body hair began to fall off, as Curtis shaved completely, his rough <br />
facial features also became slimmer, soon he was a copy of Curtis, and if only he had stopped there he <br />
wouldn't be so bad. Soon his body muscle began to shrink, his skin became even more fair, loosing the few body <br />
fat Curtis still had, his shoulders reduced, his fingernails became larger and manicure, his lips became <br />
fuller as his hair grew to shoulder length, generally taking a more feminine look, if not for his now <br />
laughable 3 inch erection, New!Curtis/Old!Seb could pass easily for a flat chick. But it wasn't only his body, <br />
he was erected out of sheer arousal from the other five naked teens, as also his mind changed, from a latin <br />
lover to a flamboyant perennially horny queen.<br />
<br />
Next it was Curtis whom skin began to darken as his hair came in lumps, to the horror of the teen, he also <br />
grow a little until he was Julius size, but his skin didn't stop to darken until it was the darkest hue human <br />
skin could get, his facial features changed too, his jaw propounded more as his perfect teeth became larger as <br />
if he could barely held them in his mouth, his dick also began to grow, almost to monstrous size of a foot <br />
limp, and although hi physical change was over, his racial slurs would condemn him. First he loose most of his <br />
knowledge acquired in school, and his IQ also dropped, he began to fear the other white men in the room, as if <br />
he were lower than them, as if he feared proper punishment, he trembled and hid in a corner for fear of his <br />
master, whoever of them it was.<br />
<br />
Julius would you probably feel would fair better, but as he changed into a copy of Dylan, the only things that <br />
changed were his cock size, skin tone, facial features and some muscle mass, it's wasn't a bad trade off, he <br />
began to think, until he remembered his insults, his body mass didn't stop from shrinking, until he was a <br />
lanky set of bones, and neither his dick stopped shrinking, cursing all the times that he call him baby dick, <br />
and a mama's boy. Before he wouldn't have a problem showing off his body in front of anyone, now he felt so <br />
self conscious that he cupped his tiny genital, and fear what kind of game would the other play with him. <br />
Little did he know that Dylan parents (now his own) were going bankrupt and he would also be poor.<br />
<br />
Dylan on the other hand became shorter and shorter, almost a foot shorter than Jake actually was, his face <br />
also had the asian features overly exaggerated, and became chubbier, do we have to mention that he gave Julius <br />
a run for his money for the smallest dick in the room, even when Jake was actually normal in that department, <br />
racial slur does take its toll. He did became smarter, but with all that intelligence he became to overthink <br />
stuff, what otherwise did on a whim, now he pondered all possible resolutions, as a result he became very shy. <br />
A long shot from his old self, never the confident stud again. Becoming the nerd king.<br />
<br />
Jake lost all muscle definition, the little he had as his skin became almost pale white, his hair grew in <br />
curls of orange, as his pubes changed as well, his whole upper body, back and face became riddled with <br />
freckles, as his eyes changed to green, he also began to lose IQ points until he was below average. He became <br />
a lot stupider actually, as that how he always saw everyone, getting distracted easily and becoming really <br />
gullible.<br />
<br />
Lastly it was Scott turn, he got the tan that his fair complexion never allowed him to have, beside that he <br />
noticed he didn't bother being nude at all, as if it was like that even from childhood, his hair darkened as <br />
his eyes changed from green to amber, and grew copious amounts of body hair from his chest, pubes, arms and <br />
legs, and in his face a first moustache and a goatee grew also, as did his dick. As Julius before, before was <br />
thrilled, until he also remembered what he had been saying about Seb, how he was an immigrant, and therefore <br />
shouldn't have education, and as his muscles filled because of the manual labour he had to do to help sustain <br />
his family, his school years vanished from his mind, his hands became rougher and even was struggling how to <br />
speak english properly, when he tried to use Seb silver tongue to pursued the man overlooking their changes to <br />
put a stop to this. He wouldn't find that useful, he also knew that with his menial salary he would never <br />
support his family, and as the insults of Seb being a man whore, he too develop the shame of selling himself.<br />
<br />
After the changed ended their past had also been changed. The man in the business disappear, the six nude <br />
teens where led to believe they found themselves naked in the basement of New!Dylan/Old!Julius on blackmail <br />
from the jocks, unknown to him they wouldn't release him afterward he gave them more leisure on others. <br />
New!Dylan owned New!Julius, even when slavery was long abolished, a few old slave owners families, had managed <br />
to breed slave stock, and as long as publicly they appeared as simply friendly families, at closed doors <br />
slavery endured. New!Julius knew as much, and always awaited his frail master New!Dylan in the buff as it was <br />
custom. The plan consisted in inviting the terminally nerd New!Jake and the fool New!Scott to pose naked next <br />
to the resident queen New!Curtis as he was fucked by the local known whore New!Seb, while he gave the other <br />
two a handjob. The plan was to tell the other two he had hired a whore for them to debut (he did, he only <br />
neglected to said the whore's gender), to make it more convincing he also undress. And as New!Seb made his <br />
apparition, New!Dylan parents came to tell him the bad news... only to discover that scene, all hell broke <br />
lose. <br />
<br />
New!Julius, New!Seb and New!Dylan after the legal matters cleared wind up in foster care. New!Curtis was <br />
thrown out of his house, soon to follow New!Seb path. As for New!Jake and New!Scott, they were considered fags <br />
afterward by the whole school, so their lives were miserable as well.</p>
