<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kristie, the mother of Hughie and Karly McCann. The McCann’s, as they were known by everyone. And that meant EVERYONE.<br />
<br />
They weren’t popular or famous, in fact they were quite the opposite. The were the richest, most spoilt family, the mother included.<br />
<br />
Karly was a spoilt 17 year old girl. Didn’t follow rules, didn’t respect anyone, and knew that whatever actions she made, her mother would always be there to shout at whoever she wronged. She slipped by in her classes while being a bitch as she did it. She didn’t have friends, but always had a group of girls who followed her around like pets. They feared her. She was untouchable.<br />
Tilly was wronged by her on a number of occasions, but last week was when she finally snapped. Karly chose to insult her father, someone Tilly was incredibly close to. But she took it a step too far when she found photos of him and began messing with them and sharing them around. Tilly was ridiculed, laughed at. But worst of all, her father was bullied the next day at work because of it.<br />
<br />
Hughie was another spoilt brat. At the age of 19, he had everything he ever asked for, putting in little to no effort for it. Despite not giving a damn about school, relationships, or respect, he managed to get everything he wanted. Even that which money couldn’t buy.<br />
He had friends and he was a total genius. He was incredibly smart, especially with computers.<br />
In fact, he was the one who edited the photo’s of Tilly’s father and distributed them around. Not just around school. But the entire town. That was how it reached her fathers office.<br />
<br />
Finally, Kristie. The biggest bitch you’d ever meet. She was loud, disrespectful, and made of money. She had everything thanks to her ex-husband and incredibly wealthy father who passed away, leaving his only child with his immaculate wealth. She was just as spoilt as her children, earning little to none of her money.<br />
If someone were to do something that pissed her off, she’d be very, VERY vocal about it. She would feel no shame in shouting and screaming until she got what she wanted. And she always did, either out of fear or purely to get her to shut up.<br />
What Tilly was angry at, other than her utter failure to raise her children, was the fact that she encouraged Karly to spread the photos, for Hughie to edit the photos.<br />
<br />
Tilly knew the cost, but she knew she’d be doing everyone a favour by punishing them for everything they had done.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
Kristie and Karly were sitting in the living room, watching some TV show. Karly was on her phone, as was Kristie.<br />
Hughie was in his bedroom playing video games.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, Kristie heard her stomach growl. It was loud enough for Karly to hear. She turned her head and said, “mom, we literally JUST had dinner,”<br />
“Don’t be such a bitch!” Kristie snapped back at her daughter, “if I want to eat a little more, then I’m going to,” she said. Karly simply shrugged her shoulders,<br />
“Whatever,”<br />
“I’m not that hungry anyway, I’ll have something later,” Kristie said. A moment later, there was another growl from her stomach,<br />
“Ugh, I wish you weren’t always so hungry,” Karly said aloud,<br />
“Stop complaining!” Kristie angrily said again, “I’ll make myself…” she stopped, placing her hand on her belly, “huh,”<br />
“What?” Karly asked,<br />
“I don’t feel that hungry anymore,” Kristie said,<br />
“Why not?”<br />
“What a stupid question,” Kristie snapped at her daughter, “why the hell would I know?”<br />
“Sorry,” Karly said disrespectfully.<br />
<br />
They both remained on the couch, Kristie had her hand on her belly now. After a few minutes, Karly looked over at her mother. Her eyes went wide,<br />
“Mom!” She yelled,<br />
“What?” Kristie said back, not bothered by her daughters urgency,<br />
“Your belly!!” Karly yelled in response.<br />
Kristie looked down, lifting her hand up to see her belly,<br />
“Oh my god!” She yelled, jumping up. Her belly had bloated significantly, to the point that when she stood up her sweater had begun to show her belly, “what the hell is happening to me!!”<br />
“I don’t know!!” Karly yelled back, not knowing how to deal with this stressful situation.<br />
<br />
Her mother’s belly continued to bloat even more, clearly not stopping. Karly, although not too bright, thought about what she had said before,<br />
“I wish you’d stop bloating!” She yelled.<br />
And like magic, Kristie’s belly stopped. Making her look almost 7 months pregnant.<br />
<br />
“YOU did this!?” Kristie yelled back, “how on Earth could you have done this!?”<br />
“I dont know!” Karly yelled back, “I…” she suddenly realised the power in her hands, “I wish I had bigger boobs!” She said,<br />
“Excuse me?” Her mother said back, holding her belly like she was pregnant.<br />
Karly’s top and jacket started rising as her breasts began to grow. Karly grabbed them, feeling the warm pleasure as they got bigger in her hands. Kristie was oddly mesmerised by the sensation of watching them grow,<br />
“Make mine larger,” Kristie said,<br />
“What?” Karly said, looking up from her expanding breasts,<br />
“MAKE MINE LARGER!!” She demanded, loudly,<br />
“Uhm, I wish mom’s boobs were bigger too…” she said quickly.<br />
<br />
Kristie suddenly felt the warmness of her chest as her own breast began to grow alongside her daughters.<br />
Karly’s breasts were now about the size of cantaloupes, “wow!” She said to herself, “I wish they’d stop growing,” she said. And like that, they stopped. She looked up from her own breasts to see her mothers, which had already grown to almost the same size as hers, “do you want me to stop, mom?”<br />
“NO!” Her mother shouted, “I want mine twice the size of yours,”<br />
“O-okay mom…” she said, hesitantly.<br />
They both watched as Kristie’s breasts surpassed the the already large size Karly had been given, reaching further than her already bloated stomach. They were getting to a point where they started to look a little unnatural, but Karly didn’t want to offend her mother. She simply watched as the breasts had officially doubled Karly’s size.<br />
It was about there that Kristie said, “now stop,” she said, before Karly could even say anything, Kristie shouted, “I SAID STOP!!”<br />
“I wish they’d stop!” She said quickly. And like that, her mother’s chest stopped growing. She stood there, more than twice the size of her daughters breasts, placing her hand back onto her bloated stomach.<br />
<br />
“Never try to outshine your mother,” Kristie said, “I’ll always be bigger than you,” she said,<br />
“S-sorry mom…” Karly said,<br />
“Now do me a favour and make my butt bigger,”<br />
“Uhm… I wish mom’s butt is bigger,” Karly said,<br />
“and my hips!”<br />
“I wish Mom—”<br />
“Oh and my thighs!”<br />
“I… I wish Mom’s hips and thighs grow bigger,”<br />
“Excellent!” She says, feeling her butt growing, now followed by her hips widening and her thighs thickening.<br />
In the span of about 10 seconds, Karly’s mother was starting to look a little too big…<br />
Her hips were now wider than her shoulders, her thighs almost thickness of her waist.<br />
<br />
“That’s enough,” she said,<br />
“I wish she would stop,” Karly said, “So what about my—”<br />
“How about we make my lips thicker,” Kristie said,<br />
“Oh… I was going to change myself a little…”<br />
Kristie stared at Karly with utter disgrace in her eyes, “you will get your turn when I am finished!” She snapped at her daughter, “now make my lips bigger,” she demanded, waiting for her daughter to comply.<br />
<br />
“I-I wish her lips get thicker,” Karly said, watching as her mothers lips started growing. She wanted to try a few things out on herself, but clearly wasn’t going to be able to. After the lips it would be something else, then something else, another, more, everything. She was never going to get a turn.<br />
<br />
“WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?” Kristie shouted at her daughter. Karly snapped out of her trance, she looked at her mothers lips, they didn’t look too bad,<br />
“I wish mom’s lips stopped growing,” she said, assuming that was what her mother wanted.<br />
“NOT THE LIPS!!” Her mother screamed, grabbing her breasts. Karly looked at her mothers chest.<br />
<br />
Her breasts were leaking! Wet stains on the front of her sweater had appeared, creating pools of milk. Karly knew she didn’t wish for that,<br />
“That wasn’t me!” She yelled,<br />
“THEN FIX IT!!” Kristie yelled back,<br />
“I wish mom’s boobs stopped leaking milk!”<br />
<br />
And like that… nothing happened.<br />
“DO IT AGAIN!!”<br />
“I wish mom stopped leaking!!” Karly yelled again,<br />
“WHY WON’T THEY STOP!!” Kristie screamed,<br />
“MOM!!” Karly yelled, pointing at her mothers crotch,<br />
“WHAT!?” Kristie screamed back, she saw Karly’s hand and looked down. Unfortunately, she couldn’t see past her huge breasts and bloated belly, so she took her hand and accidentally slapped something, “WHAT WAS THAT!?”<br />
“Y-your… y-your…”<br />
“MY WHAT!?”<br />
“YOUR UDDER!!” Karly yelled, covering her mouth from shock.<br />
<br />
Kristie knew exactly what was going on now. She was becoming a cow!<br />
“You STUPID daughter!” She shouted at Karly, “YOU DID THIS TO ME!”<br />
“I didn’t do anything!!”<br />
“THEN WHO DID!!” Kristie yelled at her, accusing her.<br />
<br />
“I DON’T KNOW!!” Karly yelled. In a fit of panic and anger, she spoke without thinking, “I WISH I DIDN’T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS!!”<br />
Suddenly, Karly didn’t really understand what was going on. She could see her mother, clear as day, but she just couldn’t really grasp the concept that she was becoming a cow. Was that not a thing that happened?<br />
<br />
“KARLY!!” Her mother screamed and shouted, but Karly didn’t notice her distress, she was a little more distracted as she played with her boobs.<br />
“Wow,” Karly said, “I wish I was, like, super sexy to everyone!” She said, still mostly clueless.<br />
<br />
Her hair quickly turned bright blonde. Her already large breasts grew a little more. Her waist slimmed, stomach almost unrealistically flat all of a sudden. Her hips, thighs, and ass grew to fit her body. Her posture even corrected. Her lips thickened, her face even changed shape slightly.<br />
She was totally clueless, but now had a killer body.<br />
<br />
“KARLY!!” her mother yelled, “KAARLY!!!!” She continued to scream.<br />
<br />
Karly didn’t notice, but Hughie definitely did. He opened the door to see what all the fuss was. What he saw… he wasn’t prepared for.</p>
