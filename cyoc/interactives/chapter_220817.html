<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake was in a rush. If he didn&#39;t make it to work today he&#39;d be fired for sure. As he rushed to get his suit ready, his little sister leaned beside his room, smirking as he buttoned his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geez bro, you really wanna get to work just to get fired huh?&quot; She laughed, twirling her long brunette hair nonchalantly as she chewed some gum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut it Cindy. God, I am so screwed though... I&#39;m not good enough for this shit.&quot; He muttered. &quot;You got it so good, you know that Cindy? Girls just gotta look good and they keep any job they want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, that&#39;s so not true.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is too.&quot; Jake sneered as he tried to tie his tie. &quot;Sometimes I wish I was-&quot;<br />
<br />
He began to mumble before the bright FLASH engulfed his room. In an instant, Emily&#39;s reality alteration took effect, and there was a very different situation going on.<br />
<br />
Jake was applying the last of his lipstick, puckering up to ensue he looked fab. His annoying sister was standing in the doorway, looking like her lazy self with just her boxers on as she angrily chewed some gum.<br />
&quot;-and that&#39;s the last of it... lookin good Jakey.&quot; Jake laughed to himself, adjusting his dress straps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, you guys have it so easy.&quot; Cindy muttered. &quot;You just gotta look good and you keep your job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WOW. Sexist much?&quot; Jake laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! It&#39;s just true.&quot; She retorted, walking towards Jake. Her boobs swung slightly as she walked right up to her taller, older sibling. &quot;Hey I&#39;m 19 now I know how the world works. You guys just look cute so some horny woman thinking with her pussy gives you a job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I&#39;m cute?&quot; Jake laughed, turning Cindy&#39;s comment on it&#39;s head. He brushed his long blonde hair from his eyes and winked at Cindy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, I don&#39;t you bimbo.&quot; Cindy scoffed. &quot;But what you&#39;re doing now proves my point. You&#39;re gonna be late and you&#39;re worried about makeup and your hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Ms. Smith likes my hair.&quot; He laughed. &quot;You&#39;re just jealous sis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, men I swear.&quot; She grumbled before walking away, leaving Jake to finish up before heading to his job as the eye candy receptionist.<br />
<br />

<br />
Marco was texting in his room, bored out of his mind. He just came back from the movies, and was texting his crush who he WISHED he went with. He was trying to play it cool, but he wasn&#39;t exactly... that.<br />
<br />
&quot;U up?&quot; He texted.<br />
<br />
No response. He cringed at the response, why did he even- FLASH.<br />
<br />
Marco blinked a few times.... why did he feel like something was off?<br />
<br />
He looked around his room and nothing seemed amiss. There was his closet full of dresses, his makeup stand, his pink wallpaper. His odd feeling was pushed to the side, however, when his crush Janice texted him a &quot;U up&quot; which made him smirk.<br />
&quot;Ay dios mio. Women just don&#39;t know how to flirt.&quot; He giggled.<br />
<br />
Marco didn&#39;t respond, deciding that if Janice wanted to fuck him then she&#39;d have to try harder than that. Still, now his thoughts drifted towards Janice. She was a total hunk. She had a six pack, a nice ass, and big tits. Marco couldn&#39;t help but get distracted at cheer practice when all the women were working out and training for the game.<br />
<br />
Marco then began to think of Janice leaning in, lifting up Marco&#39;s chin, brushing his curly black hair aside and giving him a deep, passionate kiss. His dick began to rise as he gave a loud huff. Marco quickly reached under the bed, and pulled out a large dildo. He wasn&#39;t wearing anything under his dress, so it was easy to slide in. Slowly sliding it up his ass, he began to get hot imagining Janice being the one to do it. She&#39;d have the biggest strap on, and a deep pussy for when they got serious and she&#39;d fuck his cock real good. <br />
<br />
Marco slid it in and out as he fantasized more, all the while Janice was home freaking out. Did she blow it with Marco? She was busy pacing while Marco was having too much fun imagining a world with the two of them together. Marco began to cum as he rode his favorite toy for another night.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Eric was at the gym, working on his killer bod when he spotted someone that took his breath away. It was a killer blonde, busy taking a walk on a treadmill. He noticed her because of her fat ass, which wobbled with every step he took. He was married of course, so he couldn&#39;t act on these instincts. But.... he could still talk to her at least. <br />
<br />
He got up casually, hopped onto the adjacent treadmill, and looked over at the woman. She had killer tits too, and glanced up at Eric with a look of disdain.<br />
&quot;Oh uh, this treadmill taken?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; She responded after a moment of silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool cool, uh, what&#39;s your name?&quot; He asked before mentally slapping himself. That was such an obvious thing to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheryl.&quot; She sighed, getting ready to tell this punk off before a bright FLASH filled the room and everything changed.<br />
<br />
Cheryl blinked a few times... what was she doing again? She glanced to her left and immediately remembered. Beside her was a HOT piece of work. This guy, who just told her his name, was gorgeous. He had a massive cock that was making a noticeable bulge in his yoga pants, had a decently slim build, and beautiful long and luscious red hair.<br />
<br />
Eric, meanwhile, was getting frustrated. How could he tell this girl to piss off? He flashed his wedding ring already but the girl didn&#39;t seem to take the hint.<br />
<br />
Cheryl casually wiped some sweat from under her exposed breasts and began to speak again.<br />
&quot;Yeah I come here to work out all the time... see lots of babes come and go but guy, you&#39;re the hottest piece of work I&#39;ve seen yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this guy for real?&quot; Eric thought, starting to get flustered. He was about to snap back when someone nudged his arm.<br />
<br />
Eric turned to see a black guy standing beside the treadmill. He also wore yoga pants with a tank top. He had light make up on, a curly perm, and big hoop earrings. He gave Eric a small smile before gesturing towards the bathroom. <br />
&quot;Hey dude, mind helping me with something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, sure!&quot; Eric smiled back. He didn&#39;t know this stranger, but he was clearly trying to help Eric out. So, he stopped the treadmill, and quickly followed him to the little guy&#39;s room. Cheryl was pissed, but didn&#39;t stop them.<br />
&quot;Damn, struck out again.&quot; She muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, Women am I right?&quot; The man laughed as he shut the door to the bathroom. He turned to talk to Eric but found he was already sitting in a stall with the door open. &quot;You okay dude?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric, through sniffles, tried to maintain his cool as his mascara began to run.<br />
&quot;S-sorry. So sorry. I appreciate the help I just- SNIFF- My-my wife&#39;s pregnant you KNOW what that does to their husbands... goddess I&#39;m so emotional I can&#39;t even handle some sleezy lady hitting on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey hey it&#39;s okay. What&#39;s your name?&quot; He asked as he bent down to console him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric.&quot; He replied meekly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Derrick. Ha, it rhymes!&quot; He laughed.<br />
<br />
Eric laughed too but immediately sighed.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just SO frustrating. Just because I have a big cock women just think they&#39;re to stare at it all the freaking time. And then goddess forbid I reject them and suddenly I&#39;m some crazy hoe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel that bro.&quot; Derrick sighed. &quot;So, do you know what you&#39;re having?&quot; He asked, trying to change the subject.<br />
<br />
Eric smiled meekly.<br />
&quot;No, we want it to be a surprise. My wife wants another daughter... probably to just torture me with more sport games to watch... and I want a son... someone to just go shopping with or get my nails done with and just... talk to you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel you.&quot; Derrick laughed. &quot;I&#39;ve got two girls and the house is just coated in estrogen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back out in the gym, Cheryl was pissed as she waked on the treadmill. However, another woman got up beside her, and began to chuckle. &quot;Ouch, saw that sis.&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
Cheryl rolled her eyes. &quot;Shut up Mary. He would&#39;ve gone for me if he wasn&#39;t married.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably never been with a real woman right?&quot; Mary laughed. &quot;Trust me, guys just need to get the right pussy and their whole world&#39;ll change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hear that.&quot; She sighed.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a man was doing some stretches nearby, and heard the conversation. He adjust his crotch, rolled his eyes, and muttered an annoyed &#39;women&#39; before getting back to what he was doing.</p>
