<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Warning EXTREME graphic violence)<br />
<br />
You woke up the next morning and stretched every part of your body seeing that nothing had changed from the night before, and the journal still resting on the shelf where you left it. You felt like you needed to tell Rowan, as he was your master, but you also felt as if chaos and destruction was just kind of dark, and cruel. You sighed figuring that nobody would think to trust you all things considering, but couldn&#39;t figure out what to do. You then sighed thinking that this was most likely below you now, and considering your immunity to wounds, you just decided to keep the journal a small secret for the time being.<br />
<br />
You walked outside your room, and wandered around the castle, and exploring everything you could. Eventually you were able to memorize the interior after merely an hour of walking around. You eventually made your way back to your hallway, and saw Rowan at the entrance to it. &quot;Oh, Master, I didn&#39;t expect you here, or uh maybe I should have.&quot; You said thinking back remembering that Rowan never told you to meet him anywhere before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you&#39;re already awake and stirring Gannoth. I was just going to wait for you here until you woke up, but yet here you are. So what are you doing outside your area?&quot; Rowan asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I woke up awhile ago, and had nothing much to do. So I decided to familiarize myself with the castle a bit, you know so I don&#39;t get lost or anything.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough, anyways I have some interesting news for the both of us. The news involving me doesn&#39;t concern you, except for the fact that I will be unable to train you in your dark magic. However, I have found a method of mental training that will help increase your magical powers, and allow you to learn new abilities as if almost like instinct. Naturally if you do get a new ability you will most likely have a need to use it immediately, but the problem is that you may cause destruction, and chaos within the castle here. So you need to leave, and practice elsewhere alone, or with willing, or unwilling subjects.&quot; Rowan said <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay then but what&#39;s the method?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I will plant a rune on your body, that rune will charge your body with magical energy, and feed your mind the secrets of dark magic all the way down to those lovely forbidden techniques. I must warn you though, even though you are learning dark magic and through this method there are some dark magical techniques that are dangerous to the user, and could kill if not used sparingly.&quot; Rowan said <br />
<br />
&quot;How will I know which ones are dangerous?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like your own instincts I have created a way for you to easily differentiate between your abilities. All I ask is for you to do as you please.&quot; Rowan said,&quot;Now this would normally feel like you would be burning alive, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fine.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rowan walked up to you and put his hand on your right shoulder, and you felt a slight warmth come from Rowans hand. Then Rowan removed his hand, and you suddenly had a glowing purple symbol on your shoulder. The symbol resembled that of a fresh brand and was burned into your scales, and the symbol was still giving off smoke from contact.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are Gannoth, and please know that my infamy is quite large, and I am known throughout the land. Other familiars will also know who your bound to, and who your master is, me. So if you encounter any pests you may eliminate, or do whatever you wish to them. I will of course request your assistance if needed, but for now leave the castle, and experience what dark magic is like.&quot; Rowan said and you nodded left Rowan as he left you.<br />
<br />
You had a thought about grabbing the journal, but ultimately decided against it seeing as how little it really mattered in the grand scheme of things. You left through the way you entered, and walked out into the world, and seeing what is unknown to you. Once you got outside the castle again you decided to begin walking around, and explore your surroundings. However, mere moments after you exited you were stopped when you heard the voice of another person close to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dragon!&quot; You heard a man&#39;s voice yell, and you turned to see what looked like a man wearing leather armor, but also along with a few pieces of metal all in random, and unnatural fashion. &quot;Oh hello there bandit, judging by your attire you seem to fit the description of one.&quot; You said smiling <br />
<br />
&quot;Your Gannoth correct? I saw you with the dark, and chaos crazed asshole here a few nights ago talking, and I got a good idea of what your all about.&quot; The bandit said <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I have to follow Master Rowan&#39;s orders,&quot; you began and sighed,&quot;No matter what they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Rowan&#39;s your master huh, and so you chose poorly. Now prepare yourself Gannoth, and let&#39;s see if you truly hold up to your name.&quot; The bandit said drawing a sword <br />
<br />
&quot;You poor naive man, fine then come at me as hard as you can. I give you my word I won&#39;t move until you try.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
The man looked into your eyes, and tried studying you, and you responded by closing them. All of a sudden you heard footsteps running towards you, and then you felt a small pain between your left shoulder and your head. You opened your eyes, and saw the man&#39;s sword was cut halfway through your body, and in response you smiled. &quot;Heh, he that actually would have killed me. Heh ha hahaha!&quot; You began laughing as you saw the strong sense of fear, and confused in the man&#39;s expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh..what?!&quot; The man said stepping back letting go of his sword that was still in the wound. You looked down and saw one of your organs move, and beat, your heart. You reached over with one of your claws and took the sword out of your wound and set it on the ground. &quot;Well, you see I&#39;m a familiar. You are aware of those right? Anyways as a familiar I need to willingly, or unwillingly in my case obey my master, and my master is Rowan. Master Rowan is immortal as well, and he saw to it that I was made to be immortal as well, or almost completely. I still feel pain but very little of it, and I recover from any wound no matter how fatal, or severe.&quot; You began as you felt your wound beginning to heal. &quot;As you can see my wounds are already healing, and even though you cut to my heart, it&#39;s barely a concern for me. Now I unlike my master don&#39;t exactly like murder, killing without reason or any of that. I will only kill in self-defense, and you have given me to do so to you. That being said I will still follow Master Rowan&#39;s commands for I am doomed otherwise, I just would like someone to know that I am not willingly subjugating myself to obeying him like I am. I was summoned, turned into this, and am currently being forced into obedience. Now while you may have so many questions, I want to explore the world while I still can. I will let you live under one condition, tell no one about my existence, and if you do I will personally give you the most painful death I can think of. Personally if I am to reveal myself as Master Rowan&#39;s familiar, I want to make an entrance for myself, if you know what I mean. So get lost, and tell no one got it flesh sack?&quot; You said growling as your wound fully healed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y..y...yes, anything, not a word from me.&quot; The bandit said <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, I&#39;ll know if you&#39;re bluffing too, and I have my methods of finding specific people too, so don&#39;t get cocky and be a heroic dumbass.&quot; You said,&quot;Now go, I&#39;m keeping the sword, although I will probably be empaled by many more, it&#39;s a good memory of my first flesh wound outside of conditioning.&quot; <br />
<br />
Without another second the man ran full sprint into the woods, and you smiled as he did thinking to yourself,&quot;Please spread the word that I&#39;m at least not willingly serving him. Or at least I&#39;m not now.&quot; You sighed thinking about what you should do next, and began walking again. After a few minutes another wanderer approached you, and looked at and it was.....</p>
