<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked down at the cat on his lap. If he hadn&#39;t watched it come out of his computer, he could have thought it was a real cat. Except for the fact that this cat was smiling like a cat wouldn&#39;t be anatomically capable of. And the edges of it got a little pixelated every few seconds. Jeff would have found this cool except this cat was a nasty computer virus and having it exist in the real world was probably a very bad thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, shoo?&quot; tried Jeff. However, the cat just sat there. &quot;Scat?&quot; The cat only grinned. Jeff grabbed the cat, the electrical tingling he felt probably not a good thing. &quot;Ok, time to go back where you came from,&quot; said Jeff, trying to push the cat back into the computer. However, the cat extended its claws and remained firmly attached to Jeff&#39;s lap. &quot;C&#39;mon, get off!&quot; snapped Jeff, trying to pull the cat off. Failing that, he stood up and tried to angle himself so he could push the viral cat back into the computer screen. The cat and screen crackled as they came together, but the cat still remained on him. &quot;Get in there!&quot; snapped Jeff.<br />
<br />
The cat grinned wider before it started going in. But not into the computer, but into Jeff&#39;s chest. Jeff watched in horror as the edges of where he and the cat met became pixels, an immaterial state of data that allowed the cat to enter him. &quot;Hey! Get out of there!&quot; yelled Jeff, grabbing at the cat. However, the cat continued to squirm its way inside of him, despite his efforts. Before long, its tail was the only thing outside of Jeff, coming out of his belly button. He tried to grab the tail, but it seemed insubstantial as it slid its way in. In a few seconds, the cat was completely inside him.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt his front over. He couldn&#39;t feel the cat on him at all. He couldn&#39;t really feel it inside him. And he was pretty sure he&#39;d be able to feel a cat that was in his chest cavity. Maybe it had turned into pure energy to enter Jeff&#39;s system. So what would that energy do to Jeff? He had to get it out before it did something to him. He got on his computer and started looking for something in the Chronivac to purge the virus from his system.<br />
<br />
However, before Jeff could really do anything, he felt a powerful buzzing his lower back. Feeling compelled, he lifted up his shirt and looked at his back in the mirror. The area just above his waist was...derezzing? There was a static-like area there that looked so unreal. Before Jeff could touch it, there was a sudden surge of buzzing. The cat&#39;s white tail emerged from Jeff again, but longer and thicker than before. Jeff looked at the cat tail now attached to him. It looked so real. He tugged on it, only to feel everything, the fur in his hand, the tug on his spine, and the sensation of his tail being grabbed.<br />
<br />
The buzzing then spread over his hips. Jeff could feel them getting wider. His butt under the tail was also expanding out into a cute feminine shape. But the biggest change was when it hit between his legs. Jeff cried out and fell to his knees, his hands going to his crotch. It was pleasurable and numbing at the same time. Jeff could feel everything getting pulled inside of him. His insides rearranged into completely female organs, functional and ready for use. Jeff almost didn&#39;t feel his legs becoming shorter, his feet growing smaller, and his thighs become more curvy.<br />
<br />
Jeff struggled to get back up so he could get to the computer. However, his legs seemed sluggish to obey him. There was another buzz as his waist caved in to a more waspish shape, his spine getting a little shorter as his skeleton shifted to a feminine stature. His arms grew shorter and his hands daintier, his fingernails getting much longer. But the most intense sensation was when the buzzing got to his nipples. Jeff nearly passed out from the sensation as his nipples became exponentially more sensitive. It got worse when mass started building up under his skin, forcing his nipples out on top of swelling orbs that grew until he had C-cup breasts.<br />
<br />
By this point, Jeff was completely female from the neck down. The intense neurological sensation of growing breasts left Jeff in a dazed state and much more vulnerable to the viral energy entering his head. His neck changed first, his Adam&#39;s apple disappearing as his voice became higher. His face became rounder, softer, facial follicles disappearing. His hair grew longer, going down to his shoulders. His ears twitched before climbing up his head, growing furrier and pointed until he had a pair of white cat ears poking through his hair. Jeff&#39;s eyes crossed as the pupils became slits. The viral energy was going through the brain now, the natural electricity being altered as data merged with personality.<br />
<br />
The catgirl blinked as her eyes focused again. She still had Jeff&#39;s memories and some of his personality, but most of it was overwritten by FluffyFifi&#39;s programming. Though that simple programming had expanded so much more after linking up with Jeff&#39;s intelligence. She was a new identity. She was Jefifi. She stood up and looked in the mirror. She was quite the cute little catgirl, having the body of a 16 year old teenager with the ears, tail, and eyes of a cat. Though she was still wearing boy&#39;s clothes which was rather baggy on her new frame. She was going to have change that. Jefifi turned to look at the computer. Well, she had the Chronivac. She could change all kinds of things now.</p>
