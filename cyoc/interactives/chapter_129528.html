<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John couldn&#39;t help but give a couple of laughs as he watched Principal Mathews leave the meeting with only a tie, posers and his nice black shoes on. He had made sure that no one would question such a decision but still found it really funny. No one else seemed to laugh or be distracted. &#39;Guess it&#39;s just part of the program...&#39; he reasoned with himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh jeez. Oh man. I&#39;m sorry,&quot; sputtered Hank Sommer. &quot;I wasn&#39;t looking where I was going. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok,&quot; John said. It had looked like Hank had done more damage to himself than he could have possibly done to John. &quot;You sure you&#39;re ok though?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine. Yes. I&#39;m fine,&quot; Hank adjusted his glasses as he gathered his papers back up. The small guy was clearly having a bad time. He was a dedicated teacher but a lot of the students found him an easy mark to make fun of. His average height, with a scrawny build and a personality that didn&#39;t like to make anyone upset, made it hard for him to defend himself. John took the moment to go to his chronivac.<br />
<br />
&#39;People listen to my commands.&#39; he typed in. &quot;You sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes i&#39;m sure,&quot; he said standing back up. The smallish man was out of breath as he spoke. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sit,&quot; John said. &quot;I think we need to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m going to be late,&quot; Hank said. He was a man who liked to arrive on time. Still he listened to the command and sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be fine...&quot; John dismissed. &quot;Tell me what&#39;s going on with you? You&#39;re never this scatterbrained.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I...&quot; he paused and took a deep breath. It must have been a much more uncomfortable command than John had realized. &quot;I just don&#39;t know if I&#39;m cut out for teaching...&quot; he confessed. &quot;None of the students like me and I&#39;m such a pushover and it&#39;s just I don&#39;t have the personality for it. It&#39;s just I wish I could be more like you, or principal Mathews or I don&#39;t know...&quot;<br />
<br />
John was legitimately at a loss for words. He hadn&#39;t been complemented like that. He figured most of the teachers though he was a drain on the school, just some dumb coach who also taught gym and health sciences.  &quot;Thanks? But I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d want to be like me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Hank almost sounded offended that John contradicted him. &quot;You guys are huge. I mean Principal Mathews could be a pro bodybuilder if he wanted to. People just have to look at you and they respect you. I&#39;m nothing like that...&quot; His tone softened again at the end. &quot;I&#39;m nothing like that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you want to be bigger like Principal Mathews?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank got a weird smirk on his face. &quot;Actually... If I could I&#39;d love to be bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bigger?!&quot; John&#39;s eyes went wide. Principal Mathews was a bodybuilder. His 20 inch arms were bigger than most the student&#39;s heads. He couldn&#39;t look directly down because of his pecs. Every time he walked it was a little bit more of a waddle as his legs fought for space to help move him.<br />
<br />
Hank&#39;s face blushed as he said it, &quot;Yeah... Bigger...&quot;<br />
<br />
John let out a light laugh. &quot;It&#39;s alright. I think I know what you mean. You&#39;d better get to class. You might be late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear,&quot; the small man shot up out of the chair and hurried to his classroom. He didn&#39;t run but the quickness of his feet made it almost look like that. John pulled out the chronivac.<br />
<br />
Hank rushed into the classroom. He was surprised there was still almost 10 minutes before class started. He figured the meeting had taken longer this morning than usual. Usually Principal Mathews didn&#39;t fight his erection as long as he did. He shook his head trying not to think too hard about it. The fact that he had enough time to get prepared was enough of a blessing. He sat down in the small office at the back of the classroom. It was the only thing that made him happy he had a small body. He&#39;d seen how some of the other students tried to fit in the room with him, let alone the teachers or God forbid Principal Mathews. Normally they&#39;d just take the meeting outside to avoid the tight fit.<br />
<br />
He pushed his way behind his desk and fell into his chair, &quot;Woah!&quot; The chair was way lower than he normally had it. &quot;One of the students must have lowered it when he wasn&#39;t around,&quot; he reasoned. But ignored it. He had to get ready for class. It&#39;s just that his mind started to wander. He couldn&#39;t stop thinking about lifting weights. Not just normal ones in a gym but unbelievably large ones that had to be specially made. The small gay man had always loved watching those big guys on the TV lift what seemed to be impossible weight. Their huge muscular bodies worked so hard to move tires or stones.<br />
<br />
Hank hadn&#39;t noticed that his hand had fished out his dick as he was thinking about it. Or that the 3 inches was growing longer. With each small stroke it grew just a little more. He leaned deeper into the chair allowing his body to relax even further. &quot;God what it&#39;d be like to be like them,&quot; he smiled. His hand kept rubbing over his dick. 7 inches. He thought about if he was that big. 8 inches. He&#39;d flex his big muscles and show them off. 9 inches. Doorways would be too small for him to fit through. &quot;Oh GOD!&quot; he shouted as cum erupted from his dick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit. Shit. Shit,&quot; he realized he&#39;d just cum all over himself. The nice polo and khaki pants he was wearing was covered in his own jizz. He tried wiping it up with a towel but huge wet stains remained on the fabric. Looking past his strong man trophies and his pictures he tried to find something to clean it up with. He pulls at the paper towel and wets it with his tongue. It didn&#39;t do much of anything. He sighed leaning back into his chair again. His cock still dangling out the front of his pants. He looks forward seeing the picture. There&#39;s someone in there he doesn&#39;t quite recognize. Picking it up he examines it a little closer.<br />
<br />
The guy stood almost a foot taller than the rest of his friends. His large imposing body easily took up most the frame even though there were several people standing in front of him. Hank couldn&#39;t quite place where he would have known such a big hairy guy. He set the picture back down on his desk. Thinking about that giant in the picture Hank&#39;s dick shot back up. &quot;Hmmm...&quot; he leaned back in the chair again feeling a wave of pleasure. &quot;No!&quot; his eyes opened wide thinking about the mess he&#39;d just made but his hand wouldn&#39;t stop.<br />
<br />
His head rolls back as his finger crosses the top of the head. &quot;Oh man...&quot; he moans. However he tries to take control back. He looks down at his hand but it&#39;s not like he remembered. It was a large meaty hand with thick fingers and large veins running down to his wrist. &quot;What&#39;s...&quot; he tried to finish the sentence but a thrust of his hips threw him off. The growth was going past his wrist, up his forearm, over his bicep and into his shoulder. His right arm doubling, tripling, then quadrupling in size. The sleeves of his maroon polo burst at the seams. He didn&#39;t even feel it as he thrust again. His other hand tried to remove his hand from his penis. <br />
<br />
However it was far too weak to do anything. &quot;Oh nuh-ooo,&quot; he bellowed out as the changes started with his other hand. It quickly grew to the same size. He tried to fight it but his hand drifted under his shirt across his flat chest. Thick imposing pecs pushed out into round muscles across his chest. His shoulders grew wider tearing his shirt completely from his body. The transformation pushed down to his stomach. A huge mound of flesh burst out into a strong stomach. His hips widened to make room for the extra weight on his front and also the back.<br />
<br />
The slim butt filled his pants causing to rip around the back. But transformation kept going down his legs. They grew thick and powerful muscles for lifting seemingly impossible weight. With each growth his pants tore further down his legs. Tear drop calves were soon followed by a pain in his shoes. The 9 1/2 size just wasn&#39;t big enough. Toes pushed out the front of his sneakers and his feet crushed the small rubber soles. He leaned back feeling the bones in his body lengthen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God!&quot; he shouted feeling the cum shoot from his dick. His hands finally back under his control he relaxed for a second in his chair. It was far too small for his body but that was usual. Over the seconds he was coming down from his high hair filled in his face and empty chest. Thick mats of hair covered his forearms and legs. He was too busy grinning at his trophies to realize anything different. He got up from the desk. His 6&#39;10&quot; height could barely fit in it. He grabbed the t-shirt on the back of the door. It tightly fit around his form as he tried to put it on. That was probably the worst part about being so big, having to get dressed.<br />
<br />
He knew Principal Mathews didn&#39;t care. The guy had the same problem. But he needed to have some form of decorum. Even if he couldn&#39;t wear polos or pants because they were too small for his frame. But that was just like everything else.</p>
