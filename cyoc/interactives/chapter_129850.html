&quot;Greta?&quot; asked Karen with surprise.<br />
<br />
Karen was sitting down on the floor, cum still leaking out of her wet cunt and pooling on the ground around her. Basking in the afterglow of her orgasm, Karen had failed to notice the stallion retract his cock back through the gloryhole.  She was now alone in the stall.  <br />
<br />
Well, she would have been alone if her old pet dog had not been standing in the doorway looking down at her.<br />
<br />
But it couldn&#39;t be her dog.  Greta had died long ago. And of course she didn&#39;t stand on two legs, her hands on her hips.  But the resemblance to the Doberman she loved as a child was uncanny....<br />
<br />
The anthropomorphic Doberman glared down at her with disdain.  A short man in a white hazmat suit suddenly appeared beside the dog in the entry, as if he had materialized out of thin air.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you think?&quot; asked the man.<br />
<br />
The Doberman continued to stare at Karen, carefully examining her.  Although Karen had enjoyed herself (and still felt quite horny), she began to feel a little uneasy under the dog&#39;s watchful eyes.  She felt embarrassed and a little ashamed by her behavior.  <br />
<br />
After an uncomfortably long time, the Doberman finally spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;ll do.  Get her prepped for transport to the Farm,&quot; said the dog gruffly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey now!  Wait a minute,&quot; said Karen as she stood up.  In her new body Karen found that she was almost a head taller than the Doberman at her full height.  And she towered over the small man in the hazmat suit.  It gave her a little more confidence.  Not that she needed much considering all that had happened to her.  Karen was furious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have had just about enough of this shit!  I was abducted, &#39;seduced&#39; by some kind of freak, and changed into a mutant horse against my will.  Now you want to send me to some kind of farm?  Forget it!  I am not doing anything until I get some answers,&quot; said Karen with a snort, stomping her heavy hooved foot for emphasis.<br />
<br />
The Doberman said nothing.  She just slowly walked up to Karen. Karen put her hands on her hips and glared down at her.  She was not about to be intimidated by some little bitch ....<br />
<br />
The Doberman reached out suddenly and grasped Karen&#39;s mane.  Karen flinched reflexively. But the dog stroked her neck soothingly, calming her. Karen began to relax, even closing her eyes.  The dog&#39;s grip tightened on her mane, pulling it sharply. Karen shook her head, trying to free herself.  But the dog&#39;s grip was like iron.  Her head was yanked painfully down until it was eye level with the dog.  She could smell the rancid breath of the dog in her nostrils.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen you dumb piece of shit.  If you know what is good for you, you will do what you are told, &quot; hissed the Doberman quietly into her ear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get the gag,&quot; said the dog loudly over her shoulder. The man in the hazmat suit disappeared, leaving Kate alone with the dog.  <br />
<br />
Kate didn&#39;t like the idea of being gagged and she continued to struggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it, you idiot.  I am trying to help you,&quot; said the dog angrily.  She sighed loudly.  &quot;Listen - you have two choices: you can come with me to the Farm or you can stay here with them. The Farm may not be great, but I don&#39;t think you really want to stay here.  You see, if you stay here they will kill you, dissect you and study your body ... and maybe not in that order. So if you want to survive you better shut up and do what I tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen&#39;s anger was quickly replaced by fear. <br />
<br />
&quot;What ... what is going on?&quot; asked Karen apprehensively.<br />
<br />
The Doberman sighed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t promise you all the answers but I will tell you what I know.  But not here.  The walls have ears, &quot; whispered the dog.  &quot;We&#39;ll talk later at the Farm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got it!&quot; said the man in the hazmat suit, smiling as he held up the bridle he had returned with. He looked back and forth between the Karen and the dog, eyeing them warily.  &quot;Everything okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just breaking her in,&quot; said the dog dismissively.  <br />
<br />
The Doberman took the bridle away from the man and slid it over Karen&#39;s head.  It was uncomfortably tight and Karen found it impossible to talk with the bit in her mouth.  The dog made a few adjustments to the reins before turning to leave.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Brand her,&quot; said the dog over her shoulder. <br />
<br />
Karen&#39;s eyes went wide and she tried to protest.  But the bit muffled her words.  Two large men entered the room carrying a long rod, the tip glowing a bright red.  It wasn&#39;t long before a strange symbol was seared into the flesh of her flank.<br />
<br />
The Doberman was waiting outside the room for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go,&quot; said the dog as she took Karen&#39;s reins in her hand.  The Doberman led Karen through a maze of sparkling white hallways.  They passed by a number of men and women in white hazmat suits.  The workers paid them no mind.  Only a few paused to look at Karen&#39;s brand.  As they walked Karen tried to glance into some of the rooms they passed.  She could see a mixture of humans and animals in each room, undoubtedly going the same procedure.<br />
<br />
The Doberman stopped before a large door with two guards.  After a long discussion, the door was opened and Karen found herself outside.  She was quickly loaded in the back of a large horse trailer. Just before the Doberman tied her reins to a pole Karen noticed the same strange symbol on the dog&#39;s flank.  <br />
<br />
Is she also a prisoner, wondered Karen.<br />
<br />
The dog said nothing as she left the trailer  and locked the door behind her.  Soon Karen felt the trailer lurch forward and before she knew it she was on her way to her new home on the Farm.</p>
