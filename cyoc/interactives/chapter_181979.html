<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the Lunch Cafeteria, Jen found herself in a weird position. In her old life, she would sit with her cheerleader squad. But this time, when she tried, some of them looked confused, asking why doesn&#39;t she sit with her usual friends. Some of them went as far as to making fun of her cow body and her intelligence. This confused Jen. In her old life, she and her squad were best friends. They grew up together as they worked up becoming cheerleaders, and gone through so much together. They cried together, they went to the movies together, they practiced together, they bullied everyone together, they where practically a inseparable sisterhood. But now... she is being treated liek Kyle. When she tried to sit down, Julie kicked her in the udder! They laughed at her, made a big scene about it, made fun of her size and her ability to cheer with  her big udder swinging around and basically humiliated her in front of the whole cafeteria. This shocked Jen to her core, and was completely unguarded from their assaults. Luckily for her, they didn&#39;t asked her any questions.<br />
<br />
To her surprise, it was Amanda who came to her rescue. She picked Jen off from the floor and taken her to a table with all the preople she altered from the norm. Susan, Tina, even Kyle was there! Though he seems to be busy talking with someone else at the table. He doesn&#39;t seem to really care about her presence, so she takes that as a sign that he doesn&#39;t want to bother her right now. Who knows. Maybe his memories of his old life was wiping, meaning that he no longer has beef with her. There also seems to be some people she doesn&#39;t recognize at the table, but she feels that they are all friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay Jen?&quot; Tina asked.<br />
<br />
Jen was not in the mood to fight the curse, so she responded with a forced, &quot;Yes.&quot; Suddenly, Jen wasn&#39;t even sure why being bullied by her squad bothered her. It&#39;s to be expected. When working together in cheer practice, They have a very professional work relationship. It&#39;s the one time they would put their feelings acide for the sake of the squad. But outside of practice, it&#39;s very obvious that the entire squad except for Tina considered her as a freak, and would use her as a punching bag to vent their frustrations. But Jen didn&#39;t mind, because she knows her value. She had to work hard to even get to the cheer squad and would have to practice alone just to keep up with the squad&#39;s discrimination. But she didn&#39;t mind. She&#39;s a lone wolf in this life and she&#39;s proud of it.<br />
<br />
Tina and the others sensed Jen&#39;s change in demeanor and relaxed a little. &quot;Well, that&#39;s good to hear. But what were you trying to prove?&quot; Susan asked.<br />
<br />
A glint spread in Jen&#39;s eye. &quot;Oh, I was just asking them which was bigger? My udder? Or their horns.&quot; <br />
<br />
The people at her table laughed as Jen looked back to see the cheerleader squad. Their goat horns are not huge. Bigger then any of the guys. Their horns would constantly get in the way and their weight would force them to change how they move in general. Jen&#39;s memories changed a little. Apparently, their horns made it impossible to  perform the usual cheer maneuvers. They where forced to come up with new movers, some of which are actually very impressive. They would use their horns to clime on top of each other or link their horns to do some impressive throws. Their new weight struggles increased their respect for Jen, who has to deal with similar balance changes due to her udder. Though they are still not friends. Their relationship is purely work, but at least now they are neutral about her.<br />
<br />
All these new memories from each life she create is starting to get jumbled up, resulting in a slight headache. No one should deal with this many lifetimes of memories in a single day.<br />
<br />
Amanda noticed this and decided to take her mind off of things. &quot;Hey Jen, before you got here, we where thinking... Have you wondered what it is like to have a rabbit&#39;s genitals?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Why you asked?&quot; Jen wanted to response with just the question, but the curse forced her to add &quot;Yes&quot; at the start. Now she suddenly remembers thinking about bunnies and doing research about their genitals on the internet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we were wondering what it would be like. You mention the other day that they are constantly horny. Maybe we&#39;ll find a rabbit mutant who can answer that question!&quot; Tina said. She was also rubbing her cock against the bottom of the table. It was obvious that she just wanted someone who was as horny as her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe Jen secretly have rabbit genitals. That would make her ability to avoid Tina&#39;s advances all the more impressive. Isn&#39;t that right Jen?&quot; Susan joked.<br />
<br />
This is bad. Jen doesn&#39;t want to have a bunny vagina! But she doesn&#39;t know how to word her lie. Unfortuatly for her, she took too long to think.. &quot;Yeah. You got me.&quot;<br />
<br />
And just like that, Jen felt a change in her pussy. She couldn&#39;t look now, but suddenly, she feels the constant need to masturbate. And suddenly, some smells that she didn&#39;t notice before suddenly feels very arousing. Especially Susan&#39;s horse musk... Wait, does this mean she is in constant heat?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, it must feel weird to have both cow and bunny parts.&quot; Susan commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be honest, I envy you and Kyle&#39;s multiple animal parts.&quot; Amanda said. Jen couldn&#39;t help but notice a longing glace thrown towards kyle&#39;s way. Does Amanda have a crush on Kyle?! <br />
<br />
Amanda made a obvious move to change the subject.  &quot;Hey Jen, once you finish you greens, what do you do for the rest of the lunch period?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked down at the plate in front of her. Oh right, she forgot that she brought along a plate of greens. For some reason, she feels that the plate would be full of high quality meats. Just thinking about it makes Jen Sick.<br />
<br />
As for the question... Hmm... It seems pretty harmless enough. She already wanted to check the milking machines amoung other stuff. Like maybe checking to see if Kyle is still a threat. Her new memories tells her that they have a neutral relationship. Maybe that&#39;s why she doesn&#39;t hate him anymore. Still, she gotta make sure... Or maybe she can put a pin on that and just talk with the people at this table some more. There&#39;s a lot of people her past life never met before on this table. Like that strange goth girl Kyle is talking to for example. Maybe she should take the time to get to know her new friends.....  Hmm.... So many options. How should she answer this question?</p>
