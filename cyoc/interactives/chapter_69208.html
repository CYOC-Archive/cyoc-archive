<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave took the shoes from Calvin. He recognized them as something the preppy guys from his school would wear. A pair of pale beige boat shoes with slightly darker laces. <br />
<br />
&quot;You sure this'll look on me?&quot; Dave asked shyly, he couldn't see himself pulling off the prep style. &quot;Yeah! You'll change your mind once you've tried them on!&quot; Calvin replied. Dave looked at the soles &quot;Um, they're size 9, I'm a 10, I mean I am 6 foot 1 after all...&quot; Dave <br />
said,. &quot;Oh don't worry they'll fit. Trust me!&quot; Calvin replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then I suppose you're the expert at this,&quot; Dave said, pulling off his shoes, throwing them aside and putting the boat shoes on. He could definitely tell he was right about the size being wrong, they felt slightly tight, &quot;See, told you I'm a size 10.&quot; Dave said. <br />
&quot;Relax! They'll fit!&quot; Calvin replied cheerfully. &quot;But they obviously don't...&quot; Dave sighed, knowing that Calvin was just ignoring his complaint.<br />
<br />
&quot;See they look great on you!&quot; Calvin said, holding Daves shoulders in the mirror. &quot;Yeah but they don't fi...&quot;, Dave interrupted himself, it felt like something zapped his ankle.<br />
<br />
He tied the laces up to walk in them properly, maybe they would fit after they were tied up. &quot;Nope, still too small...&quot; Dave's toes came too close to the end of the shoe for comfort, &quot;See look, my toes are too close to the end, they're too tight on the side, I need a <br />
pair of 10's.&quot; Dave said to Calvin, feeling slightly embarrassed and annoyed at the gorgeous 6'5&quot; stud in front of him.<br />
<br />
Calvin knelt down, knowing that Dave was right, but Calvin had something planned for Dave, just like the other assistants in the strange shop. Calvin felt the end of the shoe, &quot;Oh, yeah, your toes are too close to the end, but you'll fit them in time!&quot; Calvin said, <br />
winking at Dave.<br />
<br />
Calvin faced Dave to the mirror again, Dave just let Calvin do whatever he needed now, he wasn't going to listen Dave thought to himself. Then he felt a small zap in both his ankles again, they ached. &quot;Ow...&quot; Dave mumbled as Calvin's grin grew wider. The aching <br />
moved through Dave's feet. &quot;What's going on?&quot; Dave thought. &quot;Don't worry!&quot; said Calvin, &quot;You're gonna love this!&quot;<br />
<br />
It felt like his feet were warming, but then a new feeling appeared, he couldn't describe it, like a pushing and pulling sensation. Dave wiggled his toes as he felt them shorten slightly along with his feet as they shrank slightly to fit the size 9 boat shoes. &quot;What <br />
the...&quot; Dave mumbled. &quot;See, you've grown, technically shrank, to fit them; told you!&quot; Calvin said grinning. The warm, aching sensation spread up his legs, Dave groaned slightly as he felt himself shrink 2 inches to 5'11&quot;, a more average height than his previous <br />
6'1&quot;.<br />
<br />
He could see his legs in the mirror. The dark hair that covered his skinny, previously lanky, legs began to retract. His legs were now hairless as the sensation increased and golden hairs pushed out in place of his once dark ones, coasting him to almost the same <br />
extent. Dave was stunned, then he felt the dull pain spread through his calves and thighs as they expanded with muscle and energy, pulsing with each heartbeat. His legs looked really athletic now as they filled up his shorts better.<br />
<br />
The feeling moved into his crotch. Dave guessed what was next, and he hoped it was for the best. He felt his average cock harden to its full 5.5&quot; mast, &quot;Not small, but not big either&quot; was what Dave always thought of it. Then the warmth and ache extended into his <br />
member he grabbed it in some kind of a futile attempt to slow the movement of this strange energy. He felt his throbbing member engorging and lengthening outwards as his balls swelled larger, he could feel his cock against his shorts now, sticking out of his <br />
underwear as it grew to a full 8&quot; long and thick as a can.<br />
<br />
The sensation and energy continued upwards. He felt his stomach kneading itself as his skinny, flat stomach pushed out into a six pack. The feeling moved through his chest as he felt his pecs swell and push out, he grabbed his chest with his hands feeling the <br />
muscles swell to a respectable, lean, athletic size. The dark treasure trail and tiny patch of hair on his chest pulled back into his flesh and golden hairs pushed out in their place and spread into a dusting of hair across his upper chest, poking slightly out of his <br />
shirt. His shoulders filled with energy as they expanded to fit his athletic form. The energy moves through his thin arms, his biceps and triceps swelled out, his forearms following suit, the dark hair on his arms being replaced by golden hairs once more. The <br />
energy moved into his hands and made a u-turn towards his neck as his once normal, average sized fingers and palms shortened slightly, but these hands felt stronger and more powerful. Dave flexed them, loving this new feeling of energy and power within his <br />
body.<br />
<br />
His neck then began to change, enlarging very slightly, making his head look out of place on this new body. Dave realized his face was probably going to be next. But as the warmth and pulling and pushing sensations crept into his jaw, cheeks and forehead, his <br />
face seemed to remain largely the same. But he felt his jaw strengthen and sharpen, his cheeks move slightly and the end of his nose shifting. He felt a warmth in his scalp as he watched his short, dark, wavy hair lighten into a golden color like on the rest of his <br />
body. He rubbed his cheeks as he felt a rough, golden stubble push out from his recently shaven face. He looked looked like a different, stunningly sexy version of himself.<br />
<br />
And then it ended, almost as quickly as it began. Dave looked at himself in the mirror and grinned at his new, sexy, athletic form. He looked slightly older, maybe 19 years old. He realised he could do whatever he liked now, no more having to prove his age. &quot;Do <br />
you like your new look?&quot; Calvin said with a cheeky grin on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Dave exclaimed, noticing his voice remained the same, not that anything was wrong with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's great! Of course we want you know what you're paying for, we can't just sell something without a trial first!&quot; Calvin's said happily. Hearing Calvin speak, Dave realised that his personality now felt more closely aligned to Calvin's. &quot;Okay, now get a good look <br />
of yourself, do you wan't to buy and own this look?&quot; Calvin asked. Dave checked himself out, his huge cock, his abs, his lean athletic body. He loved that he wasn't tall and lanky anymore; he admired his now average sized feet and height along with his smaller <br />
hands. &quot;Definitely!&quot; Dave replied with a grin as he handed cash over to Calvin. &quot;Okay then! This is yours to keep! If you ever decide on a different look, you can just put those shoes on and you'll look like this again!&quot; Calvin explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really hope you're happy with your new look! Of course, like I said, you can always try something else if you want, it's always nice to have a few looks up your sleeve!&quot; Calvin said, winking. Dave thought for a moment and decided to...</p>
