<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darren still couldn&#39;t quite fathom what had happened. He and Katie didn&#39;t discover they were trapped in the kitsune realm until it was too late. By the time they returned home, it was too late. Lilith and Mika were dead and Darren&#39;s time was forever altered. The young teen blamed himself, he had journeyed to the past to save his future only to fail, all he could do now was apologize, starting with one of his mentors.<br />
<br />
Despite successfully fighting off Villar, Akira had been seriously injured during the attack. While Jack and Kellie were eternally grateful to the five tailed kitsune, they now worried what his absence would mean. Akira would need to recover for a few weeks in the hospital and considering his presence had calmed many people&#39;s fear, the worry was that things would get worse for the supernatural races in dealing with the One Humanity/Normal. Darren realized that in order to keep the peace, he may have to step in to take Akiras position. As he now approached the kitsunes hospital room, he paused as he noticed a guard.<br />
<br />
Darren raised an eyebrow as he stared at the Korean woman sitting outside. Pale with punk clothing, the young woman was smoking a cigarette as she scrolled through her cellphone. &quot;Got a staring problem kid,&quot; she asked, her eyes still focused on her phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um no,&quot; Darren stammered. &quot;Um isn&#39;t smoking prohibited in a hospital?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I look like I give a shit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Darren replied slowly. &quot;Um...Is this Akiras room? I was hoping to visit.&quot; Darren watched as the young woman lowered her cellphone, staring at the teen with a critical look. As the did, he realized this woman wasn&#39;t human. &quot;Wait are you a vampire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah what&#39;s it to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Darren blushed. &quot;It&#39;s just, I wasn&#39;t expecting to run into a vampire. In my time, the vampires are gone.&quot; The Korean vampire raised an eyebrow, studying the teen carefully before taking a long drag from her cigarette. &quot;You&#39;re that future kid Darren,&quot; she said, to which Darren nodded. &quot;Jack said you might show up. Names Bong-cha.&quot; Darren offered a timid wave, the teen striking up a quick conversation with Bong-cha. &quot;So can I go in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why,&quot; Darren exclaimed. &quot;Simple kid,&quot; Bong stated. &quot;Jack paid me to keep an eye out for Akira and make sure no one but family goes in. Since he&#39;s paying me a good chunk of money, you ain&#39;t going in. I don&#39;t care that you&#39;re some super wizard from the future. You definitely ain&#39;t family.&quot; Darren grunted in frustration, the teen and vampire now arguing before a familiar face poked her head out. &quot;What&#39;s going on out here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Misaki,&quot; Darren sighed in relief. &quot;I&#39;ve been trying to come in. Is everyone okay?&quot; Misaki shrugged, offering Darren a small smile. &quot;Been better,&quot; she said before turning to Bong-cha. &quot;He&#39;s okay you can let him in.&quot; Bong shrugged, taking a drag from her cigarette as Darren&#39;s now entered the room. <br />
<br />
Eighty years in the future, Darren would experience a similar sight, Akira hurt with his family and friends surrounding him. This time though proved to be slightly different as he beheld Akiras visitors. Sitting on Akiras bed was Yuriko, a much younger version of his magic teacher as the preschooler now showed off a picture she had drawn for the hurt kitsune. It struck Darren as odd, yet comforting, as he realized how much Ms. Yuriko cared for Akira. Standing next the the kitsunes bed were two individuals he had heard stories of but, never met. Zack and Mia, Yurikos godparents, holding the kutaunes furry hands as they asked him questions. These interactions seemed to brighten the kitsunes mood as a smile spread across his vulpine face.  Seeing Darren, the kitsune’s tails now wagged. &quot;Catalyst good to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren offered a small wave as everyone in the room turned to face him. Mia and Zack nodding to the teen as the Ayami, Rexie, and the future Sachiko now approached to hug him. &quot;Good to see you Darren,&quot; Sachiko said softly. &quot;Hey Sachiko how&#39;s your dad doing,&quot; he asked. &quot;He&#39;s okay,&quot; the white kit shrugged. &quot;The doctors say he&#39;ll be out of the hospital in a few weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which has us nervous,&quot; Mia added. &quot;People are freaked out enough about what happened at the park.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And,&quot; Zack continued. &quot;With Akira hurt and Lilith dead, the anthros and others are worried that tensions could boil over.&quot;  Darren nodded about to volunteer himself before a tiny voice squeaked. &quot;Mia who&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren glanced over at Yuriko, the preschooler curiously studying the young teen. It struck Darren that since arriving in the past, he had yet to meet the past version of his teacher. &quot;Oh this is Darren,&quot; Mia stated. &quot;He&#39;s a wizard.&quot; Little Yuriko nodded, studying the boy carefully. For a moment, Darren smirked as he felt the child try to read his mind. Ms. Yurikos lessons on psionics now seemingly coming into play as he gently blocked the young girls probe. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that if I were you Ms. Yuriko,&quot; Darren smirked. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t want to learn too much about the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yurikos tiny eyes grew wide, no one save Ms. McKinnon had blocked her telepathy. When she tried to read Darren&#39;s mind, she had gotten images of an elderly woman with a kind smile before Darren&#39;s mind went blank. It seemed odd but, somehow that old woman seemed very familiar. &quot;You have magic like me,&quot; she asked in awe. &quot;I have magic but it&#39;s different than yours,&quot; he smiled. &quot;My teacher though has magic like yours. She taught me how to protect my mind. She&#39;s very powerful too, maybe the wisest person I&#39;ve ever met.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko seemed to find this impressive as the young girl stared at Darren in awe. &quot;And it&#39;s the reason I came today,&quot; he continued. &quot;With Akira hurt I&#39;m volunteering to stay here and protect the school and the anthros until you&#39;re well enough.&quot; <br />
<br />
The room now stood silent, Misaki gaping at her ex boyfriend. No one expected Darren to make that sacrifice. Everyone was aware of what had happened. How Steph, a Soul Drive Darren viewed as a big sister was captured by the Normal. Most teens his age would want to mount a rescue mission, to stop the Normal and try and repair the future. Instead this boy who wasn&#39;t even old enough to drive was willing to sacrifice his own desires for the sake of everyone. <br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate your offer Catalyst,&quot; Akira stated, a small grin on his face. &quot;That you are willing to help others is commendable. However, it will not be necessary. I have someone else in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who,&quot; Zack asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It appears the Catalyst has had quite an effect on others since his arrival,&quot; the kitsune replied stoicly. &quot;From what I have learned from my daughter our future has changed. The time she knew no longer exists. However, the time the Normal created has also changed. Things are in Flux and we can still make things better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re rambling fox boy,&quot; Rexie groaned, the white cat rolling her eyes.  Akira simply frowned, casting the familiar a critical look. &quot;Very well,&quot; Akira grunted. &quot;In that case I&#39;ll make this brief. I&#39;ve spoke with Fukushu, he has agreed to protect the school in my absence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu,&quot; the others exclaimed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Akira stated, looking to Darren. &quot;I am unsure of what you have said to him but he wishes to help. I believe he wishes to make amends for his past misdeeds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren simply gawked, aware Fukushu&#39;s reputation in the past. The nine tailed was feared by all within the supernatural community making Darren wonder. This favor Fukushu was willing to do could either be a massive success or a complete nightmare.</p>
