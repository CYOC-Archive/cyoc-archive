<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I forgot to get the judge to read Christopher&#39;s measurements last chapter.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone was wondering it&#39;s:<br/>
Length: 14.0 inches<br/>
Girth: 11.3 inches<br/>
Flaccid Volume: 26.12 fl oz<br/>
Volume Growth: 44.82 fl oz</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All I could do was stand there in shock and arousal as I was barraged with a cacophony of laughter, insults and boos. <br />
<br />
“I’ve used worms as bait bigger than that little thing”<br />
“I thought this was a competition for men”<br />
“Get that tiny dick off the stage”.<br />
<br />
“Okay okay settle down everyone. Little Daniel here has just as much right to participate as anyone. And on that note it’s time to contend for Master category” Hoyt announced to cheers, “Unfortunately only contestants who have brought their own small-dicks to assist may compete in this portion for the grand mystery prize!”<br />
<br />
I ignored the fascinated oohs of the audience and tried to salvage what dignity as I bent down to pull my pants back up. I felt a big hand on my shoulder and turned to look at Christopher through the tears in my eyes, wondering if my baby brother was about to tell me he’d lost all respect for me as a man.<br />
<br />
“Look you and your tiny dick has really screwed us over, but we can still salvage this contest.” he looked around at the rest of the contestants, bringing their naked tiny dick assistants on stage, “Now I wasn’t planning on participating in the Master category but I’m willing to do you a favor here. If you act as my small-dick for the competition, maybe we can get something out of this whole ordeal and you can win a prize for your spouse. And you can prove to everyone here you&#39;re a real man.”<br />
<br />
Wow it was heartwarming to know that even though he just found out I’d been lying to him all these years about being a shameful small-dick, my little brother was still looking out for me.<br />
<br />
“Okay lets do it.”<br />
<br />
“First rule is, small-dicks will not be allowed to use their hands so tie’em up fellas.”<br />
<br />
Each small-dick was told to put their hands behind their back where their respective competitors bound them together with rope. My brother was in scouts so I knew I wouldn’t be breaking out of his knot any time soon. We were then made to kneel.<br />
<br />
“All right, contestants take your positions!” I looked over at what everyone else was doing and saw all the competitors shove their cocks down their small-dick’s throats.<br />
<br />
I tried to tell Christopher to wait but as soon as I opened my mouth I felt my little brother’s enormous penis bypass my lips and push against my tonsils. As I tried to pull away he pushed back in over and over again before he grabbed my head and held it still “Hold on bro we’re not supposed to start yet! Don’t get us disqualified” did he think I was trying to suck his cock?<br />
<br />
“Okay the rules are simple” Mr Jay explained “First contestant to dominate their small-dick hard enough to make they cum without any contact to their tiny penis’s wins!”<br />
<br />
Okay that doesn’t seem so bad. I cum very quickly and easily so this shouldn’t take long. All I had to do was ignore my brother’s giant cock in my throat for a minute and we might make it.<br />
<br />
“But before we begin there are a few extra things to remember!” Mr Jay continued “Cumming before your small-dick assistant squirts their load disqualifies you from the round so be sure to hold your fire men! And as an extra incentive to stop you fellas from ejaculating prematurely the penalty rules will be a little different this round. This time the punishment will be dealt to the contestant on stage who ejaculates first. They will receive strikes equal to the number of minutes between them and the contestant who holds their cum the longest.”<br />
<br />
“All right, is everyone ready?” The host asked. The men all grunted and the small-dicks all made muffled sounds “aaaannd GO!” <br />
<br />
My brother immediately started pistoning back and forth forcing his enormous cock down my throat. I had never sucked a cock before in my life but somehow despite the pain it just felt natural to me.<br />
<br />
I could feel my orgasm building already, my teenie dickie wanted this to be over as much as I did. Here I was, on the floor in front of hundreds of men sucking my little brother’s cock. The boy who I babysat when we were kids. My childish brother who’d always walk around butt naked and care free. And despite our dad telling him off for it he was never punished. The way he&#39;d gloat after we&#39;d wrestled and I&#39;d let him win since he always fought dirty by grabbing me by the balls (Which I had to pretend were my real balls). If he wasn&#39;t so naive he would have noticed he was grabbing onto a falsie the whole time. I always thought of him as immature, but here he was pumping his massive fourteen inch manhood down my throat more mature than I could ever hope to be. I felt pressure rise in my aching little dickling and soon enough I felt a wave of pleasure pulse through my body as I felt my weenie release squirting it’s load all over the floor and dripping into my pants and underwear pulled up around my thighs.<br />
<br />
I moaned through my brother’s cock as he continue to pound away at my throat. I tried to tell him stop but with his gigantic erection invaded my mouth, all I could do was make gagging and slurping sounds. He seemed to notice I was trying to communicate something to him though.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry bro I’ll hold my cum as long as I can!” he tried to assure me between grunts “I’m won’t blow my load until you do. I’m not going to get us disqualified”<br />
<br />
My brother was facing the wrong way and could not see that I had already cum! I couldn&#39;t push him off as my hands were tied behind my back. I tried to wriggle away but I was too weak from the powerful orgasm I had just experienced. Christopher barely noticed as he was too determined to keep jack-hammering away at my throat.<br />
<br />
Even when the host declared that I had finished he kept going. I knew from sharing a room with him through our teen years that he was always oblivious to his surroundings when he was engaging in sexual activities. Multiple times I’d walk in on him masturbating his huge cock on our bunk bed and he just kept going like he didn’t notice I was there. Hoyt continued to make announcements when the other small-dicks and contestants shot their loads but my brother was blocking it all out, his eyes scrunched up in concentration; grunting, thrusting and sweating. I don’t know how long he lasted for but I’m sure everyone else was done after fifteen minutes and Christopher was still obliviously just pounding away at me, losing all track of time. Finally he opened his eyes and looked down at me.<br />
<br />
“Sorry bro, I can’t last much longer, but I’ll keep going until the last second.” And he kept his cock fucking away inside my mouth right up until-<br />
“RAARGH” I felt the first powerful jet of semen hit the back of my throat. It was so deep down I couldn’t even taste it. He started pulling out and on the way he fired two sprays of thick seed onto my tongue. When he emerged he ejaculated, fat globs of white cream onto my face, some of it into my eyes. He took a step back to spare me but ended up releasing multiple final discharges all over my expensive suit. It was soaking into everything; my shirt, my waist coat, my jacket, my pants and my briefs. Some of it even splashed my little bow-tie. I finally got to look over the crowd and saw that he was receiving a standing ovation.<br />
<br />
As the loud cheers from the crowd gradually died down Hoyt addressed everyone again “All right, that’s everyone done, lets say goodbye to our volunteers,” I watched as the four other small-dicks shuffled off the stage and were one by one pulled down to the floor where they vanished into the crowd, “and with that it’s time to declare our winners!”</p>
