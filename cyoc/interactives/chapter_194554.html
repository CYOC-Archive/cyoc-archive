<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael walked down the street in silence, his breath puffing out before him as he sighed, the action failing to relieve the emotional pressure he felt in his chest as his eyes scanned the buildings that lined the road, not really seeing them despite their lights illuminating the night air.<br />
<br />
The day had been pretty uneventful. He sat in the large armchair Bix had brought in for him next to the bed in which Eric slept, while reading a book about Reindeer Folklore he&#39;d found nearby, occasionally glancing over to make sure he was still breathing. Clyde had come rushing in after his practice was over, half an hour or so ago, asking for updates and looking exhausted. <br />
<br />
After an awkward 20 minutes--Clyde was cordial and grateful but very focused on Eric and not in a particularly talkative mood--Michael had decided to give the two some time alone. He figured he&#39;d get some fresh air and look for something to eat, promising to return in only a couple of hours so Clyde could get some rest, though he had the suspicion that the reindeer would have to be coerced into going home to sleep.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d been so lost in thought that he nearly walked into Otso, who had approached from the other direction before stopping in front of him with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Distracted walking is a common cause for injury up here. Do you know the number of sprained ankles I see each week? The ice can be very slippery.&quot; His golden eyes sparkled in the dark, reflecting the nearby lights.<br />
<br />
Michael smiled, shrugging and feeling his face flush despite himself as he changed the subject. Tonight the wolf had opted to wear an open black leather jacket, which did nothing to hide his package. &quot;Good evening, Otso. Coming to check on Eric?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes and no,&quot; the wolf admitted, &quot;I actually wanted to come and check on my favorite nursing assistant.&quot; He grinned. &quot;I saw Clyde rushing past my office as I was closing up, and figured I might invite you over for a drink or something to eat since we&#39;re not likely to &#39;<i>accidentally</i>&#39; bump into each other at a coffee shop anytime soon.&quot; He winked as Michael laughed. He&#39;d had an inkling that the wolf had been hitting on him here and there, but this was the most blatantly forward he&#39;d been yet.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d had plenty of time to think today, and he found Otso occupying his thoughts frequently. He&#39;d only travelled to the North Pole what was it? 4 or 5 days ago? 6? The lack of a day/night cycle was fucking with him. And since then so much had happened; everything had been in constant flux. The one real constant in his life had been the wolf since he first came to check on Tess, and he&#39;d found great comfort in their conversations. If anything Otso had become somewhat of a patient confidant. He felt weirdly safe under the doctor&#39;s admittedly predatory gaze.<br />
<br />
He realized he&#39;d left the wolf hanging as he quickly responded. &quot;Yes, that would be very nice, actually. But I need to be back in a couple of hours to kick Clyde out. Do you live close by?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do. My primary residence is on the other side of the Workshop. Just over there.&quot; The wolf walked up and pointed as Michael followed his claw with his eyes. He turned back and they both realized how closely they were standing to each other as his face flushed once more. He turned and began to walk as Otso followed, falling into step beside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Primary? You have multiple?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct. Although the one at the resort is really just in case of bad weather or a late appointment.&quot; They were walking so closely together that they kept bumping shoulders, so Michael took a chance and held onto Otso&#39;s paw. He wondered if there was a slight breeze, or if the wolf&#39;s tail was wagging.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Otso&#39;s decorating was rugged and understated as deep cobalt blue cushions accented the treated wood furniture set. Microsuede, he explained, helped to keep everything from turning white from the natural shedding of his fur as Michael nodded, never having had to worry about that particular concern in his decorating decisions before. Sophisticated and practical.<br />
<br />
They sat with Michael leaning against Otso&#39;s chest with the wolf&#39;s arm around his shoulder as they nursed post-meal bourbon. Otso had hung his jacket once they entered, so sat completely naked except for his fur. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never been with another guy before.&quot; Michael admitted, emboldened by his buzz as he looked back into Otso&#39;s beautiful eyes. &quot;I always thought I was straight. I mean, I&#39;m friends with lots of gay guys at work. It&#39;s Hollywood--even the sports are gay. Not that I have a problem with it, I just never tried.&quot; He shrugged and took another sip of his drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you think that is?&quot; Otso asked curiously. He sounded a bit like a therapist with his even professional tone, though his eyes considered him with a predatory interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Expectations?&quot; He shrugged. &quot;But God knows my love life has never felt quite right.&quot;<br />
<br />
He worried he&#39;d been too transparent too quickly as he felt Otso shift to move out from behind him, but the wolf simply set his drink down before turning to him. &quot;Well, how does this feel?&quot; He leaned forward and pulled him into a gentle kiss, finishing it off with a light lick.<br />
<br />
Michael was a little surprised but pretended to think for a moment as he felt his dick harden. He set his drink down as well. &quot;Hmm. I&#39;m not sure. Maybe if you tried it again?&quot; He smirked playfully.<br />
<br />
The wolf made a low growling sound deep in his chest as he leaned forward into another kiss, this time running his tongue along the inside of his mouth in a quick wolfish interpretation of a French Kiss as Michael found himself naturally being pushed backwards. &quot;And that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still not sure, sorry. One more time.&quot; He chuckled, his pants starting to feel tight.<br />
<br />
This time Otso pushed him down into the cushions of the couch as he climbed on top of him, pressing their lips together firmly as his red tip began to creep out of his sheath. &quot;You seem to be enjoying that.&quot; He bumped their noses together as he groped at the tent in the man&#39;s slacks.<br />
<br />
Michael let out a husky moan at that, &quot;I do. Don&#39;t stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Otso began to unbuckle, unbutton, and undress him with a surgical precision, never once breaking their kiss as his cock pushed out fully, and soon the two men were both naked on the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how does this whole werewolf thing work? If you bite me will I start to turn?&quot; He was mostly teasing, egging the predator on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not quite.&quot; The piercing glare was turning territorial as he bit down on Michael&#39;s neck, forcefully but not hard enough to draw blood as his dick throbbed and he humped their cocks together, their breathing deepening in tandem. Otso reached down to hold their cocks together, thrusting them against his rough pawpads as his knot popped out of its sheath.<br />
<br />
Michael began to run his nails through the fluffy white fur, occasionally pulling him tighter as they thrust into each other, Otso growling liberally now. They kissed deeply some more, sharing each other&#39;s breath as it became ragged and they started to feel light headed, drunk on each other, as Otso was completely on him now, thrusting with abandon.<br />
<br />
Their natural chemistry was a catalyst as the orgasm rose quickly into full prominence before Michael began to shoot first, his seed flying a short distance before becoming entangled in the doctor&#39;s fur, which rubbed against his own hairy belly. Before he&#39;d had a chance to finish, Otso was joining him, grunting loudly and planting another firm kiss on his lips as their hands became covered in seed before collapsing on top of him as they breathed into each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Final judgment? I think we have a winner.&quot; Michael quipped as he rest his head against the pillow as their tails wagged lazily against each other. Otso simply chuckled, enjoying his comedown before they realized that the sensations coming from behind them were unusual. Michael craned his neck to see as Otso climbed off of him, his tail coming with him and leaving Michael&#39;s to its own devices.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you said...Wait, is this what you were talking about earlier?!&quot; Michael sat up to grab at his tail in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay here. Let me get my arcanathometer.&quot;</p>
