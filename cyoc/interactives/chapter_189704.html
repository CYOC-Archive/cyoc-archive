<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So that’s how it all first started,” I told my newest date as we reclined on my sofa. His name was Ethan, and he was a cute guy, an emo twink who had grown into a twunk. His pale skin worked for him, accentuating his sharp feature and giving his strong arms an ethereal glow in the dim lighting of my campus house. And while he was still hunky, he’d be a nice change to the muscleheads I’d been into lately, with their military crew cuts and bodybuilder physiques. I just wanted to spend hours cuddling with him, falling asleep in his string arms. “And now, like I said, anyone who falls in love with me will change into whatever I’m into at the time.”<br />
<br />
He smiled at me, a boyish smile that set my heart a flutter with its innocence. “Well, that would certainly explain a few things,” Ethan mused as he looked around us.<br />
<br />
My harem had grown since high school, though not as I’d expected. It took time for someone to fall in love with you, after all. Once I’d hit my unexpected growth spurt, it was easy for people to lust after me, and while those additions to the harem were nice, I felt guilty that they were cursed to forever hunger for me, always wanting more and rarely getting satisfied. I called them the succubi, since all they wanted was sex all the time, and I called those who had actually fallen in love with me the wives, though any that had been female became male as soon as they fell for me.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Don was lounging at our feet reading a book. He smiled up at me with one pair of eyes while continuing to read with the other. His final transformation had him become a six-armed, five-legged, four-eyed, three-mouthed beauty.<br />
<br />
Bill and Ted sat by the window, their shared body hugging their middle leg while the other two sprawled out. Bill smiled at Don while Ted winked salaciously at our possible new addition. Were they a single consciousness right now? When I was dating William and he fell in love with me, his second head had initially been a brand new consciousness, somehow his own person, but over the years as my tastes had changed their arrangement had switched accordingly. Last I remembered, I had wanted him as a single mind in a two-headed body, but I wasn’t sure what I was feeling now. Well, the curse would know, and conjure Ted’s personality or banish it back to the ether on my whim.<br />
<br />
Pat the naga had slithered in and coiled himself up next to Don when my date had arrived. He was eyeing us hopefully, always ready for a new husband to join us. I wasn’t sure where Ralph was, probably having sex again with the succubi. Pat had been in a poly relationship when we met, and once she changed after falling in love with me, Ralph began to come around and follow suit. It took him a long time to warm up to me, but he loved Pat’s changes, at least once she-now-he showed him just what her-now-his new body could do. After that it didn’t take too long for Ralph to feel grateful and open up to sharing Pat with me, and once he realized he loved me, he became the perfect boytaur husband for us both.<br />
<br />
“So,” I whispered conspiratorially, “interested in joining my harem?”<br />
<br />
Ethan giggled and playfully smacked my arm. “I don’t fall head-over-heels that easily,” he laughed, eyeing my various husbands. He frowned and looked around suddenly. “I thought you’d said there were others, though. What’s you call them?”<br />
<br />
I sighed heavily. “I call them the succubi. If I have a one night stand or something, that person gets added to the harem, transformed into the ideal fantasy of whatever I’m in the mood for while we’re going at it, but then all they ever want is sex. They put up with the romance only if it’ll get them laid after. And I’m not always in the mood for meaningless sex, especially with how... changeable my tastes get.”<br />
<br />
Ethan nodded sagely. “You are hot,” he mused, “but I wouldn’t want to move that quickly with anyone. Sex is something specia, it should be shared with someone you love.” He looked thoughtfully at the guys in the front room with us.<br />
<br />
I was happy to hear him say that. While he might not be falling head-over-heels for me, the more I talked to him, the more I wanted him to tal in love with me. Just watching him, I found myself feeling happy. His eyes weren’t burning with lust as he watched Bill and Ted turn to gently kiss each other, or Pat stretch a bit as Don rubbed his tail absentmindedly. I realized I really wanted Ethan then, but I didn’t want to change him into my fantasy. I wanted him to be mine for real, as himself, or whatever would make him happy.<br />
<br />
“So,” I said after admiring him some more, “that’s what I meant when I said dating me isn’t as straightforward as all that.”<br />
<br />
Ethan smiled at me. “Obviously not, but curse or no curse, I think you deserve someone who makes you happy.” The glint in his eyes told me he was willing to find out if he’d be that someone.<br />
<br />
I took a deep breath. Ethan seemed wonderful. Did I really want to curse him to join my harem? Should I just let him go, remaining the sweetly innocent twunk he still was? I took a deep breath to steady myself before I said…</p>
