<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That night, there’s a knock on your door. You instantly toss aside the little furry zine you (apparently) got from a convention earlier that year. You take one last look at yourself in your phone camera before heading to the door. Round face, blotchy skin, glasses, braces. Not the view you had a few days ago, but you at least can get used to it. You don’t exactly look horrible. And you have a lot of people who liked you, including the man at the door.<br />
<br />
You hop up from your bed. Before you leave your room, you quickly remember to grab something from your closet. You open the closet door, seeing a big blue fur suit hanging up. You suddenly remember paying A LOT of money for it and you start to worry about what your new bank account looks like. You get on your tip-toes and grab the leather pup mask from the shelving. Then you run to the door and open it, careful not to awaken Paul.<br />
<br />
On the other side, there was a breathtaking man dressed completely in leather. His jawline is absolutely to die for, with the perfect amount of beard to make his chin look like a Greek god’s. His jacket was partially unzipped, showing off his expansive chest and the harness hiding underneath. His chest hair is almost otherworldly. The perfect length with symmetrical spirals on each pec. You wonder how Marvel didn’t snatch him up to play a superhero, but the whole homemade-gay-fetish-porn thing might be a part of it.  He opened his mouth a bit to show off some movie-quality fake fangs. He snarls at you, and your heart flutters.<br />
<br />
“Where the fuck’s your mask?”<br />
<br />
You wordlessly slip on the leather pup mask. Before it can fully cover your face, Alpha grabs you by the collar and pulls you closer to him. He savagely inserts his tongue into your mouth. You can barely breath but your entire body melts into his. Barely thirty later, he’s in your room, the camera is all set up, and you are completely nude.<br />
<br />
The next morning, you wake up in Alpha’s arms. He’s spooning you, with his teeth nibbling your ear and his hand was firmly grasping your boob. Your butt is still in a lot of pain from the night before. You do your best to ignore it. Then, your eyes almost bulge out of your head when you remember about the swap ring.<br />
<br />
You pry yourself out of Alpha’s half-asleep grasp and try run to the bathroom. Your steps are still heavy and getting close to waddles, so you’re still fat. Your sight is still wonky and you still taste the metal in your mouth. But when you get to the mirror, you don’t see any change. Everything is exactly the same as the day before. No new memories were flooding into your head, either. Lyle either forgot to swap something, or he was done. Are you...free?<br />
<br />
“[Name],” growls a tired Alpha. “[Name]. Get back here. I need cuddles.”<br />
<br />
You scrunch your face a bit when you hear his gruff voice say “cuddles.” But when you peek around the corner and see the massive naked man in your bed, you decide not to look a gift horse in the mouth. Or bather, gift wolf. You run back to bed, your gigantic ass jiggling with every stride.<br />
<br />
It takes a little bit to get used to the changes, obviously. You have like three sets of memories to deal with and it’s hard to remember which one is “current.” But you get used to it pretty easily. It turns out, this new nerdy, furry you is going to school for graphic design and art. At first you scoff at this but then you put pen to paper and see that you’re actually an amazing artist now. Assuming you’re drawing animals. You also have a shit-ton of friends. You play board games almost nightly with these nerds. Forrest and Jimmy both ask you a lot of questions about your “new boyfriend Wesley” over a game of Catan that night. You play it coy and know better than to call him Alpha in front of them.<br />
<br />
The days go by and everything seems actually great. You figured you would be more devastated  with all of the changes as they were happening, but you’re actually pretty happy now. And you didn’t want to compare them or anything, but you feel a lot more satisfied in bed with Alpha than whatever his name was. You briefly wonder if Lyle is now dating your former boyfriend, since he switched lives with you. But you didn’t actually care that much. You have Alpha now and Alpha is a better man than you were ever able to get before the changes.<br />
<br />
The new fetishes are a bit weird to work around. You try to go about your day without your tiny cock going off the rails but apparently the furry that Lyle swapped you with was into weird shit. Obviously, you are sexually attracted to cartoon animals. Duh. But every time you see a guy on campus wearing sandals, you have the intense urge to get on your knees and suck his toes. Those are easy enough to process. However, a few days after the change, you find a pissplay video in your internet history. You delete it and do your best to bury that shit deep inside yourself.<br />
<br />
That’s also not to say the changes completely stopped. A few days after the big changes, you were going through your day and didn’t even realize until noon that you were having trouble reaching things. You take a tape measure to yourself and find out that you shrank down to 5’4”. You lost four inches overnight. Lyle must have made another change to you. It took you an embarrassingly long time to find out what the other change was before you realized it was your skin. Your skin was clear. In fact, both the acne and the stretch marks are gone. Whoever Lyle made you swap with, you hope the extra height was worth it.<br />
<br />
So your life is pretty good. On the surface level, Lyle probably thought he made you a laughing stock by making you a short fat furry with a tiny penis and what-have-you. In practice, you’ve been super popular with a niche set of people and have been having the best sex of your life. It’s been so good, you almost forgot about the swap ring.<br />
<br />
At least until you woke up one day and found a text from Lyle waiting for you.<br />
<br />
“We need to talk.”</p>
