<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Riley had only one class today so it should have been easy. It was a Calc class. As Riley walked to class, he tried to clear his head from all the odd stuff that had been happening this week. The more he thought about it, the less he worried about it. His suddenly felt a bit fuzzy. Why was he worried at all? In fact, everything seemed totally normal! Just him and his good friend Kyle hanging out together.<br />
<br />
Riley arrived at his class in a good mood. He really liked calculus; he had always gotten really good grades in the subject. However, as the lecture started, Riley found that he was a bit confused and lost. Calculus usually came really easy for him, but he juts couldn&#39;t seem to grasp this lesson! His mind wandered from the lesson out of boredom. As he unconsciously scratched one of his armpits, he checked the time on his phone. &quot;Uggh, the class isn&#39;t close to being over!&quot;.<br />
<br />
As soon as the bell rang, Riley bolted for the door. He didn&#39;t understand much out of the lesson, but he told himself he could always study the book and learn it himself. Maybe the professor just wasn&#39;t that good. He began his long walk back to his dorm. As he thought about his Calc class, Riley&#39;s eyes were checking out his fellow female students. He was looking at the asses of the girls walking in front of him. He would usually relish the sight, but it wasn&#39;t doing much for him today. He shrugged it off and kept walking. He passed by the school gym, which had huge glass panels on one whole side, so you could see everyone working out inside. Riley stopped and stared at a very hairy and muscular upperclassman pumping away on the weights. Riley felt a tingling in his khaki pants. He realized he was getting a bit hard. He blushed in embarassment, covered it up and walked very quickly to his dorm. &quot;What the hell is going on? That guy got me hard but not the girls?&quot;. He quickened his pace, all the while unconsciously scratching his pits and the center of his chest.<br />
<br />
By the time he arrived back to his dorm, he was covered in a little bit of sweat; it was pretty hot outside. He tossed his bookbag to the floor and collapsed onto the couch. He saw his friend Kyle was playing video games. He was shirtless, as usual. &quot;Hey Kyle, how WAS YOUR day?&quot;, Riley asked, with his voice breaking again. &quot;Was your class good&quot;?, Riley further inquired, notcing his voice seemed a bit lower now.<br />
<br />
Kyle paused the game and turned around to look at Riley; &quot;Hey dude. Nah I skipped my class. It was going to be boring. I just wanted to relax instead&quot;. Riley noticed that Kyle&#39;s voice seemed deeper than usual, too. He quickly disregarded it as him being silly, so he got up to fix a sandwich. He took his plate and sat on the couch behind Kyle. He watched his rommate play his game. Riley&#39;s eyes started to wander. He noticed that Kyle did indeed look a bit bigger. His shoulders seemed a bit broader and his arms looked bigger, slightly more muscular. Riley was confused, as he didn&#39;t know Kyle worked out.<br />
<br />
After he had eaten, he sat down next to Kyle and picked up a controller. Since they only had wired controllers, they had to sit pretty close to each other and the TV. Riley did notice it was a bit hot; Kyle had the right idea being shirtless, he thought. Riley quickly shucked off his shirt and they started up the game. They played for a little bit until they had beaten the level. As the loading screen came up, Kyle took the opportunity to stretch. He lifted his arms towards the sky and stretched. Riley did a double take at what he saw; Kyle had huge bushes of thick brown hair growing out of his armpits! As far as Riley could remember, Kyle only had a could blond wispy hairs; enough tha you could count them on one hand. Now, Kyle had a thick tuft of curly brown hairs! As he was stretching, Kyle took the opportunity to reach over and scratch his right armpit with his left hand. Riley watched as he scratched the bush, the hairs making a thick rubbing sound together.<br />
<br />
Riley peel his eyes away from Kyle; How did he get hairy armpits! He was practically hairless yesterday! &quot;Was he? Didn&#39;t he always have lots of pit hair in the high school locker room? At least since he was a freshman?&quot;; the thought raced through his head. It felt correct to Riley, but a part of him just couldn&#39;t believe it. As he stared at his roommate, Riley also noticed that he began to feel a tingling in his crotch; he was getting hard.<br />
<br />
As Kyle was scratching his pit, he turned and saw his roommate staring intently into his armpit. He stopped scratching and lowered his arm; &quot;Uhhh dude what are you staring at?&quot;, Kyle asked. Again, Riley thought Kyle&#39;s voice was deeper, but he disregarded it. &quot;Umm, nothing Kyle&quot;, Riley said, quickly averting his eyes. Kyle didn&#39;t believe him; &quot;Dude, were you staring at my pits?&quot;. Riley kepy denying it, but his embarassed red face gave it away. Kyle continued; &quot;Bro, that&#39;s wierd that you were staring at my pits, but I guess I&#39;ll be a good roommate and give you a better view!&quot;.<br />
<br />
With that, Kyle jumped out of his chair and playfully tacked Riley. Riley didn&#39;t have time to react. Within seconds, he was in a headlock with his face stuck in one of Kyle&#39;s pits. Damn, Kyle was a lot stronger than Riley remembered. Riley strugled to get free but found it rather difficult. He was stuck staring into Kyle&#39;s hairy pits. Unfortunately for Riley, his nose was also stuck right up in it. Kyle&#39;s long hairs tickled Riley&#39;s nose. Riley noticed his roommate had really bad BO. This surprised Riley, because he had never once known Kyle to have body odor. Riley didn&#39;t even think his roommate even wore deodorant at all. As he struggled, he just got shoved further and further into the pit. For some reason, Riley got even harder in his pants. &quot;Why am I getting hard?! This is ridiculous!&quot;. Finally, Riley mustered all his strength and broke free. It surprised Riley that he had the strength to do so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what is your problem!&quot;, Riley yelled at Kyle. Kyle just gave him a goofy grin; &quot;What are you talking about Riley, we wrestle all the time? Are you okay?&quot;. Riley put his hands to his head as he suddenly remembered Kyle was right. They did wrestle fairly frequently. They were fairly evenly matched as well. &quot;Yeah, I guess your right Kyle&quot;. &quot;By the way Kyle, you sure do stink today. Would you mind taking a shower or something?&quot;. Kyle flashed him a grin, lifted up an arm and sniffed one of his thick pit bushes. &quot;Ooh your right, but don&#39;t get all high and mighty, you don&#39;t smell all that great either&quot;, Kyle retorted as he lifted your arm. Your eyes bulged out of your head as you saw your armpits now had a lot of hair in them; no where near what Kyle had, but still a lot more than you had. It was a small brown bush, and it looked to be the amount that any normal high schooler would sport. As you gave yourself a sniff, you recoiled; &quot;Oh wow, I do smell. Your right Kyle&quot;. <br />
<br />
Riley&#39;s brain became foggy again; his mind was trying to process and rationalize all these changes. In the midst of all this, he noticed that Kyle had a hard on in his pants. Suddenly, the old Riley fought back. &quot;Kyle, we are changing for some reason, don&#39;t you remember the old you? This isn&#39;t like us. Just a few days ago we used to be smaller and smarter. We were nerds! Now we are growing body hair and getting bigger. I don&#39;t ever remember us having body odor, ever!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Kyle looked at his roommate a bit worried. Kyle didn&#39;t fight the changes as hard as Riley; all he could remember was his new reality and his new body, and that it had aways been like that. &quot;Dude, Riley, I think you should go lay down or something, are you okay?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Riley had to process this and figure out what was going on. He decided a good night sleep should put his brain in a better position to analyze his current situation. He pulled off his pants and jumped to bed just in his boxers. He turned out the light and tried to go to sleep. He noticed he still had an erection, and even that seemed thicker and longer. He tried not to think about it and just drift off to sleep. Within a few minutes, he was fast asleep. However, every couple of minutes, Riley would unconsciously scratch his chest, stomach, and his face rather roughly. Kyle went to bed a bit later, not even considering what Riley had said; that was crazy talk that they were somehow changing, right?</p>
