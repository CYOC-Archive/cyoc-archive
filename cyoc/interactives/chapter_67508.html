<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun rose to begin the following day. All the night long David found sleep coming only in fits and pieces, her body screamed for the feel of King Largo once more, even if her thoughts found it mortifying. She could hear the groom dumping feed into buckets and clicking his tongue to rose sleepy stable mates. While David contemplated how to get out of the predicament she noticed that her body was moving on its own. Nearly all of the morning feed was consumed, giving a nice weight inside her stomach while fresh hay bulked out the morning meal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now, aren't you still an eager pretty thing?&quot; The groom chuckled. &quot;Don't you worry none, ol King's got your foal in the makin'. 'Sides, yer his mare now,&quot; the groom laughed and patted her neck firmly.<br />
<br />
David snorted hard and stamped her hoof at the indignation, but could do little about it until she figured out what to do. Already though, in the back of her mind, her male ego was saying that she needed to figure something out quickly before she really did become a fixture in the herd of brood mares.<br />
<br />
While David watched the groom do his usual morning duties, her thoughts strayed farther and farther. Finding that if not for being covered by her champion, it wasn't really so bad being a horse. She didn't have to worry about balancing budget books or answer phone calls. David even smirked to herself, that she'd try this again for sure, although maybe with strict instructions to not have the new mare bred. she thought again about it, even with the ache and surprise, towards the end it felt almost, right.<br />
<br />
David blinked and lifted her head up only to feel a gentle tug back on her halter. Looking around she could see the groom brushing her down and making soft words at her. Lulling her back into a relaxed state of drifting slow thoughts. Distantly she felt that she should be concerned that the shadows were short and the day was very bright outside. She stared for several moments to bring back the memory of where she was on her estate. David whuffled low while several more people milled around her. Everyone was talking gibberish as near as she could tell. She felt her tail being lifted and wrapped with a bandage, legs wrapped as well. <br />
<br />
David found it harder to concentrate on so many things at once. Why was the groom talking to a man who smelled like smoke. Who were these other people standing around? She looked and tried hard to put names to faces and then jobs to faces. Just as she was beginning to recall the name of the head assistant, she felt her folds teased with a chilled cloth. Tensing her rear and popping her tail up, David grunted with surprised delight. Another teasing wipe before she was led over to the breeding stall again. Her thoughts floundering under the flood of sensations and hormones cascading from the wave upon wave of blissful lust at the stimulation to her hot vulva.<br />
<br />
David had just started to regain mental composure before another warmer rubbing along her sex tossed more fuel on he burning lust within her. The touch was velvety smooth and warm and in generous supply. David stared right ahead while chewing her lips, shuffling her hooves in eager anticipation of burning need. Ears pivoting to the approaching clop of heavy hooves, then the intoxicating aroma carried on a slight breeze. David felt a tremor course through her body at the sight of King Largo being led up again to say hello. when their noses touched, any thoughts of wanting to be male again fell away under a rush of purely equine desires, to accept her stallion and bear him many fine foals.<br />
<br />
King largo was taken away to move in a tight circle, leaving David to protest and voice her want in shrill squeals and whinnies. Fighting herself to regain a mental grasp David paid little mind to what she could see, hear and feel. WHINNYING! In victory as she managed to seize control of her full mental faculties again and with it, the total sum of heavenly pleasure and lusty natural desires as King Largo's body dropped down over her back and his forelegs gripped her firmly around her barrel.<br />
<br />
David cried out again as his control was ripped away by the renewed strength of pure equine instinct and want. King Largo thrust deeply, spreading his new mare deeply. His girth stretching the tensing muscular tunnel until his growing flare me the final depth resistance.<br />
<br />
David had always been enthralled by the well to do and simplicity of owning a stable, though leaving others to run it for him. In slit moments David recalled snippets of conversation from the stable master and head groom. Mostly of how a mare will act when she's ovulating and ready to be covered. It was then David realized she was acting in just he same was described.<br />
<br />
King Largo bucked short, once, twice and three times strong. His flare spreading wide to ensure the tight space between his tip and the mare's cervix was sealed off. The very end of his urethral process extended to its full length. probing the tensing muscular ring that is the mare's cervix, teasing it to have it open like a blooming flower. A final lurch and King Large grunted out a throaty nicker. His weighty balls drawing upwards while his tail flagged then pumped downward quickly.<br />
<br />
David trembled as she felt her inner wall breached, ever so small, but more than enough to fulfill the conquest that would see her joining the ranks of King Largos' bred mares. Her body tensed firmly, squeezing tightly around the thick girth. Her thoughts scattered to the far reaches of her mind while instinct, desire and wonderfully comforting pleasures swamped David male ego, forcing it to accept being a mare and a mother.<br />
<br />
Deep inside David's body, King Largo's thick near jelly like seed poured forth, flooding in thick streamers into the fresh and fertile womb. Millions upon millions of sperm, each fertile and healthy enough to assure that the only foal that will be sired, will belong to the champion.<br />
<br />
King Large grunted deeply, nuzzling the side of his mare's neck while his thick shaft draw back slowly, still pulsing thick bolts of his seed, only now the thick bolts grew thicker still and increasingly sticky. A firm final thrust forced the thickening gel plug over David's cervix to coat it in the protective shell of a stallions gel plug. The solidified further into a gluey near paste to do one thing, and one thing only. Keep the mare from forcing any of the fertile seed from her body before it has a chance to bind with her ova.<br />
<br />
King Largo was led away to be washed, David felt gentle coaxing tugs lead her along. Her thoughts floating in a sea of bliss and warmth. Sharp clopping of her hooves gave way to a metallic ringing and sulfurous stench that burned her nose. Before she could react a cloth bag was draped over her eyes leaving her blind and hesitant to move. <br />
<br />
One clear voice though told her all she needed to hear, a voice she recognized above all others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you worry now girl, this nice man is going to fit you with a nice set of shoes so you don't hurt your pretty little feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
David made a garbled whinny at the sound of her own, male, human voice. Somewhere in the back of her mind, she could hear laughing, but knew not what or why.</p>
