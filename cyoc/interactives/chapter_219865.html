<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That Friday, my situation...became...something else entirely. <br />
<br />
I had spent most of the day feeling sorry for myself. My breasts had continued to grow over the past couple days, enough so that even trying to get around in the wheelchair was a bit of a strain. I was spending more of my time in bed, because what the fuck else was I supposed to do? Just the act of trying to get around took more effort than I was willing to expend most of the time. And it wasn&#39;t like I could do much. I couldn&#39;t put my arms around my tits even more - they were too big for that. Instead of just brushing against my legs when I was sitting, they were constantly weighing them down. More than half my body weight at this point solely came from my tits. <br />
<br />
Sometimes, I could swear I could feel them growing larger - like I could feel them scraping against my legs slightly. I was afraid to bring it up. My mom was looking more and more defeated. Several times I&#39;d heard her shouting on the phone - at my absentee father, at various doctors, even what I think was a psychic. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I was feeling bad because I knew Brooke&#39;s swim meet was tomorrow, and there was no way I could go. It just wouldn&#39;t be practical. I really wanted to though. I just wanted to hang out with my friends and have a normal fucking day for once.<br />
<br />
And so that night, I went to bed early, cursing at the weight of my breasts as I laid in bed.<br />
<br />
I&#39;d only been asleep for a couple hours when I found myself waking up, my heart pounding in my chest. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d had any kind of weird dreams or anything, but something had gotten my heart-rate up. I looked around the room, trying to figure out if something was up. God, I felt hot too. My forehead was drenched in sweat. Great. Just great. Just what I needed - to come down with something on top of everything else that I was having to deal with. And then I felt a weird pulse, and a wet sensation in my panties, and realized - for whatever reason, I was super turned on. Maybe I had been having a wet dream or something? I couldn&#39;t think of any other reason why I would feel so excited. I lay there in silence, wiping at my forehead, letting out shaky breaths at the odd sensations. <br />
<br />
The next time I woke up, I could tell something was wrong.<br />
<br />
I woke up to the sound of a long, sensual moan - it took me a minute to realize that sound was coming from ME. And it took me a moment more to realize that, for whatever reason, in my sleep, I&#39;d started massaging my nipples, sending spikes of absolute pleasure through my body. My heart was pounding in my chest, and my sheets were slick with sweat beneath me - but holy shit, it felt real good. This had never happened before. <br />
<br />
And then I looked down, and my eyes grew wide. Right before my eyes, my tits were...they were like...pulsing. Throbbing almost. <br />
<br />
And they were getting bigger. Visibly bigger. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; I whispered, and maybe it was the shock of the sight, but it was at that moment that the strongest orgasm I&#39;d ever felt sent a supernova of pleasure through my body, making me let out a high pitched whine I didn&#39;t even know I was capable of making. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; I continued, looking at them as they pulsed larger - I could feel them anchoring me to the bed as they grew. Shit. Shit! At this rate, they&#39;d crush me to death before the night was up! Trying to ignore the urge to rub my nipples some more, I started putting effort into trying to get my massive mammories to move - to get that weight off of me before it was too late. <br />
<br />
It took all the effort I had, but eventually, I was able to push off the edge of the bed hard enough that I essentially just...flopped straight over and fell out of bed.<br />
<br />
Right onto my breasts. <br />
<br />
I let out a shocked gasp of surprise as my body was yanked down after them, and then, well - I blacked out.<br />
<br />
I have a vague memory of a surge of pleasure so intense that it sent my teeth chattering and made my eyes roll up into my head. And then I was gone, baby. Gone gone gone.<br />
<br />
The next time I woke up...<br />
<br />
The next time I woke up, I thought I was lying in bed. Awareness returned slowly. My body felt tired, weak, a bit shaky - probably because the pleasure from before had drained all my energy. And I was lying on something soft and warm and it was pretty comfortable. It had been months since I&#39;d been able to sleep on my stomach.<br />
<br />
And then I slowly opened my eyes and looked down, and realized it wasn&#39;t a bed at all.<br />
<br />
It was my tits.<br />
<br />
My tits!<br />
<br />
They had grown so large they were nearly as large as the rest of me. Lying on them now, I could just barely reach over to touch the floor. And even as I lay there, pinned to the ground by these monstrosities of breast flesh, I could feel them growing bigger. I could feel my nipples dragging across the carpet as the growth continued, sending constant sparks of absolute bliss through my body, making my legs weak. I wasn&#39;t just wet at this point. I was gushing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why is this happening?&quot; I whispered. I tried to sit up, but I couldn&#39;t - of course I couldn&#39;t. I was anchored to the floor by my own tits. <br />
<br />
I guess at some point, I must have fallen asleep again - I had a few flashes of coming to every so often, usually to find myself whimpering from the pleasurable sensations of my tits growing against the carpet.<br />
<br />
&quot;BRONWYN!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
My eyes snapped open. It was daylight, and I looked down to see my mom standing in the doorway, looking at me with shocked eyes.<br />
<br />
She was looking up at me with wide, shocked eyes.<br />
<br />
She was...looking up at me. <br />
<br />
Oh holy fuck.<br />
<br />
I let out a fearful moan as I took in my current situation. At this point, my breasts had grown large enough that they dominated most of the floor in my room. I was fully suspended on them now, draped over the top of them. I could feel them pulsing with growth underneath me, and just the simple act of shifting around sent a white hot sensation through my pussy, bringing me to a sudden orgasm. They were large enough now that, from my current vantage point, I was taller than I would&#39;ve been standing up. <br />
<br />
Holy shit.<br />
<br />
Even now I could feel them growing, pulsing with growth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bronwyn, what the FUCK is happening?&quot; my mom asked with a gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t...I don&#39;t...I don&#39;t know...&quot; I whimpered. &quot;Help me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom shook her head helplessly. &quot;I don&#39;t...I don&#39;t know...I&#39;ll call...&quot; She took a hesitant step back, and ran off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t leave me!&quot; I wailed, before gasping as another orgasm shot through me, making me twitch atop my breasts. The more I moved, the better it felt. The better it felt, the more I moved. And in the process, it seemed to send a message to my tits - hey, grow faster. Because it certainly seemed like they were picking up speed now. I could actively feel as they began to brush against the side of my bed - and then proceeded to grow over the bed until - CRACK! The legs and frame shattered underneath their weight in a matter of moments. More and more pleasure began to surge through me, and I felt my computer chair begin to roll away, and heard a loud crunch as my computer fell off the desk and was promptly turned into scrap metal by the relentless growth. &quot;S...s...stop...&quot; Igasped, her body practically vibrating from the constant onslaught of pleasure. It was all I could do to keep my eyes open, my teeth chattering from the constant pleasurable sensations. &quot;Stop...!&quot; But they didn&#39;t listen to me - of course they didn&#39;t. They never had. Whatever was behind this didn&#39;t care about what I wanted. Whatever had caused this just wanted my tits to Grow. <br />
<br />
And Grow they did. <br />
<br />
I whimpered and moaned as they continued to fill more and more of my room, until I felt the sides of my breasts brush against the walls. I could feel some of my posters and pictures fall to the floor or get crushed by my tits. The room was suddenly cast into darkness as my tits covered not only the window, but grew into the doorway as well. The constant orgasms had reduced me to a quivering mess, incapable of speaking, and I let out a warbling moan of pleasure as I felt my back make contact with the ceiling. In a matter of seconds, breast flesh began to press against me, driving me against the ceiling - hard. And the sensation of my tits suddenly exerting that much pressure on my body was just. <br />
<br />
Too. Much. <br />
<br />
I screamed, I moaned, I cried - I was in bliss, and hell. <br />
<br />
And the pressure continued to mount, and I thought, this is it. This is how I did. Crushed because of my own tits. What a way to go.<br />
<br />
Except, I wasn&#39;t that lucky. Morbid, I know, but...<br />
<br />
With a sudden renewed surge, my tits began to put force on the walls of my room. I could scarcely believe it, but I began to feel them buckle and heard a loud groan from the house...moments before the walls began to crumble, and the ceiling above me cracked, and my breasts gleefully began to grow past their previous confines. Bits of wood and plaster rained down, covering the surface of my tits in dust and making me cough a bit. I could hear my mom screaming from down below - I hoped she&#39;d been able to get clear, but it wasn&#39;t as though I could do much about it. My breasts continued their destructive growth, crushing the remainder of my walls. More of the ceiling and the roof above crumbled and began to slide down my breasts, adding on to the endless onslaught of pleasurable sensations this was giving me. I could feel the rubble of my room underneath my tits, grinding into my nipples, and shit, it felt so good. So good. <br />
<br />
Why was this happening to me? <br />
<br />
What had I done?<br />
<br />
Why did it have to feel so GOOD?<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long until their growth had crushed most of the house - I could feel the wetness of the lawn beneath them now, and the slightly slanted hardness of the driveway. I felt mom&#39;s car get absolutely flattened as my mountains rolled over it. Looking up through blurry eyes, I had a decent vantage point of the neighborhood. It was almost comical. I could see more than a few people pointing at me with wide eyes. A few cars had stopped in the street as their drivers stared. <br />
<br />
Well. <br />
<br />
I was going to become quite the sensation.<br />
<br />
And at this point, I was starting to wonder if they would ever stop growing.<br />
<br />
And as I thought that, I felt a sudden renewed sense of pleasure - the two houses beside ours, and then the one behind us - it didn&#39;t take long until they were beginning to crack and crumble before the unstoppable might of my tits. And even as they grew and grew, and began to smash through my neighbors houses, the pleasure continued on, and on, and on.....</p>
