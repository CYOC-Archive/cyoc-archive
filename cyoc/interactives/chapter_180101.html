<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your first month after becoming a werewoman was filled with its own complications, largely as it was filled with its own surprises. Namely the fact that Max had seemed to know so much about it when you&#39;d first explained all that had happened that had resulted in your becoming a werewoman. The meeting a very forward woman in the park who&#39;d seemingly been interested purely in sex and took advantage of you to get it. It wasn&#39;t something that you&#39;d actually resist, and in fact didn&#39;t resist, but it only lead to you becoming &quot;Blue&quot; for the first time. You then remembered being just as sexually aggressive as Blue that you remembered the woman that turned you had been. Waking up naked with a sleeping man only betrayed that, though thankfully that man never woke up and you went to Max for help.<br />
<br />
At first you had been afraid that Max wouldn&#39;t know or wouldn&#39;t help you you, but surprisingly he had been open to helping. In fact he&#39;d seemed far too open to helping you regain your male form or at least being male all the time. He&#39;d known on what you&#39;d become, a werewoman, and had been willing to help. It was something you didn&#39;t expect and you were more than willing to take. However, you ended up putting too much trust in him. Instead of curing you, he&#39;d seemed to find a way to lock you you in your female form and wanted lock you in that form. Thankfully Blue had been able to trick him and that resulted in Max becoming Blondie full time, but it also left you without any real option unless you were to gamble on someone figuring out what Max had managed, and you still had no clue as to how he managed it. And as Blondie, there was no way there was any answer on that issue. As such you&#39;d had to essentially come to grips with being Blue three nights a month...<br />
<br />
That became easier when you found you could talk to Blue on the nights when the moon was not full and you were both asleep. And the first conversation was the most memorable...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are we both naked?&quot; you said feeling embarrassed as you looked over to Blue, standing confidently before you with her hands on her hips and as what looked like smoke drifted between you.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s your subconscious,&quot; Blue answered you, &quot;and I suppose you just wanted to see me naked...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all so weird,&quot; you said as you looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can be, particularly as you weren&#39;t exposed to werewomen before me,&quot; Blue spoke, &quot;or rather before you ran into the one that turned you... into me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still weird... and I&#39;ve been through so much... and...&quot; you sort of stuttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, your friend was a piece of work... for a college professor,&quot; Blue answered, &quot;and wanted to abuse me... to abuse you. But Blondie won&#39;t be a threat to anyone and you may be able to get with her any time you want. And since you&#39;re already a werewoman, she can&#39;t turn you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Max said that would only turn me into you full time,&quot; you looked to Blue&#39;s eyes. You watched as Blue only rolled them in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not how it works, and is likely where Max was trying to trick you,&quot; Blue answered, &quot;I can&#39;t take over you. I AM you and you ARE me. We are one and the same. In many ways we have the same personality... though I&#39;m the one with the freedom to be more assertive and more confident, possibly because I have the body to be confident and attract what I want. You&#39;re a smart and nice guy... and in a normal relationship, I&#39;m sure women would actually support you. Though it can also let you let fall victim to people who are more devious and predatory, like the werewoman that turned you and Max.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really thought he would help me,&quot; you said as you looked down.<br />
<br />
Blue&#39;s image came across the space between you. She swayed her hips in a way that betrayed a very sultry confidence on the things she wanted, but yet at the same time there was calm confidence about her that also seemed refreshing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because ultimately you are a good person,&quot; Blue told him, &quot;Max was the sort of man that was just looking for an easy sex object, knowing that as a werewoman, you&#39;d be rather open to suggestion while in my form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why would he also want to be a werewoman, at least part of the time?&quot; you asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;That I can&#39;t say,&quot; Blue shrugged, &quot;once Max became Blondie full time with that potion that he&#39;d engineered to abuse us... that became irrelevant and Blondie doesn&#39;t want to become Max again.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and looked down again. You still felt a bit guilty and saddened by the fact that you were now someone who turned into a woman and looked to have sex in that female form and without any real care about it. A part of you even recognized that as Blue, you either didn&#39;t care if anyone you&#39;d slept with saw the male you the next morning or had the knowledge that you would wake up before your partner did. But then, maybe that was something that you&#39;d gained as a werewoman and that was another thing that made the entire thing complicated.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what happens now?&quot; you asked as you then looked over to Blue, who was now standing beside you and had her right arm around your left arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;We move on, Sam,&quot; Blue answered, &quot;you and me. You work with your articles... maybe socialize a bit and keep in touch with real friends and family. And I&#39;ll always be with you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you are me?&quot; you asked to Blue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Blue nodded, &quot;and maybe you&#39;ll meet someone whom you can truly trust with our secret one day... And given that I know you like women, hopefully she&#39;ll like me too and then we&#39;d create a perfect pair...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect pair?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Blue nodded, &quot;you are a werewoman, a man who turns into a woman on the three nights of the full moon. But that condition wouldn&#39;t only be passed to men you sleep with as me but to any woman you sleep with in your male form. They would become a wereman, a woman who becomes a man for the three nights of the full moon. And just as you will be more eager for sex as me... so would a wereman. The perfect balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like that will happen,&quot; you said in a low voice, &quot;I got too easily lead on by a stranger I barely knew... she offered sex, I took it... and well, you know the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that doesn&#39;t make you a bad person,&quot; Blue replied, &quot;and neither does it make the werewoman that turned you a bad person. Just have a little confidence and I&#39;d think you&#39;ll do fine. You could meet someone that would accept me... and things would be great.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And until then...&quot; you spoke your voice falling off as the smoke in the dreamscape began to vanish, as if you were waking up.<br />
<br />
&quot;We just continue on,&quot; Blue answered, &quot;I&#39;ll have my fun three nights a month... and you&#39;ll move forward during the day, and I&#39;ll help you get stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And in some ways, you did feel yourself grow &quot;stronger&quot; as that month passed, even though you&#39;d been in your male form.  You&#39;d seen Blondie from time to time, but you&#39;d figured to keep your distance, remembering what she, as Max, had tried to do to you and Blue, and thus you&#39;d been left with many of the same questions that drove you to Max in the first place. Even with the agreement to loosely accept what you had become, you still had questions, though Blue couldn&#39;t answer them all. And as the first full moon night night of the new month began you knew  that some of those questions as you readied yourself to become Blue again and go to the park...</p>
