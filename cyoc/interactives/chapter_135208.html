<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Pamela.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Head Maid Skyla?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you and or Cassidy know the names and or address of your old gang members?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... The ones that are alive? I know where a few are, and I can give you names of the others. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just going to check up on what they&#39;re up to. And making sure they aren&#39;t doing anything that might give any of us trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything to worry about. But if it&#39;ll put your mind at ease, madam!&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla knew visiting former, and possibly not-so-former criminals alone was pretty much the definition of foolish. She was still Head Maid, so what she said went unless it contradicted Master&#39;s needs and desires. But how could she nominally justify Pam coming along with her to visit people she likely never wanted to see again? <br />
<br />
And there was helping the new maids move in, and she&#39;d have to arrange time in her schedule now to train Kitty (it would be so much easier to just zap her, zap and poof, newly minted maid!). <br />
<br />
... Still... Maybe she could use the extra hands to help <i>with</i> all that moving? She promised herself, after these zappings, she&#39;d lay off until things settled down and Curt had time to get comfortable with things again. <br />
<br />
“I know this may be difficult for you, but would you mind coming along with me?  I don’t think going alone is a good idea.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, maybe not, but I don’t know if me or cassidy acting as bodyguards would be a good idea either.  We didn’t exactly part with the gang on the greatest terms.  I figure even the ones that have gone legit aren’t gonna be too thrilled to see me again.”<br />
<br />
“Well, you held your own against all of them at once before.  If things turn violent, I doubt you’d have a problem again.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but I’d rather not be the reason things turned violent to begin with.”<br />
<br />
Skyla gave it some consideration.  As Head Maid, what she said goes, but Pam did have a point with her presence potentially escalating a situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you could just stay back then when I meet with them, and if you see trouble you can move to help me. Unless you think you can&#39;t stay hidden from your old gangmates?&quot; <br />
<br />
“Oh please, they wouldn’t know the first thing about stealth.  Yeah, when you put it like that, I can come along.  I still don’t really think there’s any threat of them coming after Master, or me and Cassidy, but if you think it’s worth looking into…”<br />
<br />
+++<br />
 <br />
Movies make the position of “bodyguard” look like a tense, high-action affair.  In truth, a lot of it is simply doing paperwork and background checks on the people and places the VIP will be interacting with.  And a lot of standing around waiting for something to happen.<br />
<br />
Pamela proved good at her job, quickly providing a list of the names of all of her old gang members, and after a little research, their addresses and occupations.  It was everything Skyla would need to track them down, and change into a loyal security staff.  Well, the ones that were still alive.  One of the gang’s members had gotten addicted to drugs later in life, and died of an overdose, while another had perished in a car accident.  So it was down to eight, assuming none of them had fathered any children.<br />
<br />
Their first target, Henry, was working a simple retail job, and would be the easiest to approach, since the store he worked for was a short drive out of the neighborhood.  Skyla walked up to the electronics store, keeping an eye out for the man matching Pamela’s description, while Pamela herself kept an eye on the Kitsune from a safe distance. <br />
<br />
She found the man trying, futilely, to explain to a much older couple why they couldn’t hook up an HDMI cable to their CRTV, but despite his best effort, they still decided to take the cable up to the front desk.  He was clearly doing his best to retrain a sigh, knowing that if he was working returns when they inevitably came back, it would be HIS fault, somehow.<br />
<br />
Skyla smiled.  Now here was someone who clearly needed a change in their life!  “Hello there,” she paused, and held her head at an angle, pretending to read his name tag, “Henry…  I’ve been looking for you.”<br />
<br />
The man turned to the kitsune, his face betraying brief hints of confusion and worry, (after all, it’s rare for customers to seek out one clerk in particular, and when it happens, it’s usually not a good thing) though he quickly corrected it to a more professional look.  “Yes mam, how may I help you?”  <br />
<br />
“I represent the Everson family.  We’re currently looking for new staff to assist around the mansion.  Some of our current employees have recommended you as a potential candidate.”<br />
<br />
“The Eversons?  You mean that guy that won the lottery a while back?  Who’d recommended me?”<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid I can’t go into that for confidentiality reasons, but if you’re hired, I’m sure they will tell you themselves.”<br />
<br />
“Okay…  so this job…  Does it pay more than ten dollars an hour?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes, plus optional room and board, and a full benefits package.”<br />
<br />
“Pah, sounds too good to be true, but anything is better than here!  When can I sign up?”<br />
<br />
“Right now!”  Skyla pulled out the gun from her apron pocket, and fired, the options having been set in advance.  <br />
<br />
Henry shuddered slightly as the green lightning struck him, his slightly overweight figure thinning down.  His shoes disappeared first, allowing Skyla to see his toes become thicker, and curl into feline paws as the nails vanished.  Retractable claws grew out in their place, before quickly vanishing once more, and leathery pads formed on his feet as they shifted into a digitigrade stance. <br />
<br />
Short fur began to steadily climb up his body.  Despite having set the options herself, she was still a little surprised to see the fur’s dark blue color.  It seemed like the kind of thing that might be too ‘out there’ for the gun, but it seemed it wasn’t restricted to ‘natural’ fur colors.  She could tell the man’s legs were changing under his jeans, taking a subtle feminine shape.  His hips, similarly, grew wider, and his rear more pronounced.  His clothes vanished shortly afterward, though nobody in the store beside Skyla noticed, as usual. However she was still wearing the store&#39;s apron and name tag. <br />
<br />
By this point, the dark blue fur already completely covered her legs, and the lower half of what was now HER torso, judging by the emptiness between “Henry’s” legs.  A little nub formed behind the changing woman’s ample butt, which soon snaked out into a thin, two foot tail covered in the same blue fur until the very tip, where a tuft of thicker, black fur grew out.  <br />
<br />
“Henry’s” waist became a little narrower, as the fur continued up her torso and down her arms.  Her biceps became subtly larger, (though certainly not as impressive as Cassidy’s,) while her fingers became longer and thinner, the nails vanishing as retractable claws took their place, as they had on her feet.  Also like her feet, soft, leathery pads grew on her palms, and fingertips.<br />
<br />
Her furry chest began to slowly swell, like a pair of generously sized cantaloupes.  The blue fur completely covered her head, her ears moving up the sides of her skull as they became more rounded.  Her eyes turned from green to a bright yellow, and her blonde hair began to recede and turn blue, becoming indistinguishable from the rest of her fur.  Lastly, much of her face pressed forward, her jaws stretching into lioness’s large muzzle, scents becoming more distinct as her nose turned darker and grew wider, and her teeth all sharpened into fangs.<br />
<br />
The newly-formed blue lioness immediately put those new fangs to work, smiling widely and hugging Skyla.  “Thank you so much, Head Maid Skyla!  You have no idea how miserable it is working at this place.  But getting to work full time at the Mansion?  And with Pamela, too?  It’s a dream come true!”<br />
<br />
“You’re welcome…” Skyla quickly snuck a peek at her notebook with the staff list before remember it would be on her name tag too, “...Henrietta!”  The kitsune smiled to herself.  It felt good not just to use the gun again, but to know the newly made maid appreciated what a gift it was.<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Skyla could have looked up the records of the remaining seven members of the gang to see if they had families or not, but they didn&#39;t say if they were adopted, and she wouldn&#39;t pass up a chance to zap someone over a little detail like that. <br />
<br />
One down, seven to go. <br />
<br />
Henrietta was happy to travel with Skyla to their next destination, seeming a little less worried about upsetting the other gang members than Pam was.  The next person on Pam’s list was a fellow by the name of Andrew, who was currently working as a mechanic.  Skyla and Pamela pulled into the garage’s parking lot, followed closely by Henrietta in her own vehicle.  Pamela sat just outside as Skyla and Henrietta headed inside.<br />
<br />
“Hello,” Skyla stepped up to the front desk.  “We’re here looking for Andrew.”<br />
<br />
“Andrew?  Well, he’s here, but he’s busy in the garage at the moment.  What do you need to see him about?”<br />
<br />
Skyla paused.  They probably weren’t going to let her talk to him if she said she was offering him a new job.  <br />
<br />
“We’re doing background checks some of our new employees.  He was one of the references for one of our prospective hires, and we would like to ask him some questions.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t they normally do that by phone?”  The man at the front desk asked.  “And could it wait until later?  We’ve got quite a few cars in today.”<br />
<br />
Skyla wished she could just zap this guy and move on to Andrew, but she had some restraint.  She was starting to feel a little guilty about looking for any excuse to change Kitty earlier, and even if Master had given her some freedom with the gun, she did want to try and respect his wishes, (even if he seemed oblivious to how much better his life would clearly be if he just took her advice). And that meant not shooting everything that moves.<br />
<br />
“I’ve found that we tend to get more useful results from in-person interviews.  And we must be certain that we get the best feedback as possible for the people working for us. And we promise it&#39;ll take a minute of your time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henrietta leaned on the desk.  “Just tell him Henrietta’s here to see him.”<br />
<br />
The man at the front desk shrugged.  “If you insist.”  He headed into the garage.<br />
<br />
A short while later, a tall, thin man stepped out.  “Henrietta?  Well, it is you!  It’s been years.  What brings you here?”<br />
<br />
“Well, my new boss here, Head Maid Skyla, came to ask some questions about the old gang.  For background check stuff.”<br />
<br />
Andrew looked a little disappointed.  “I see.  Well, you got me away from work.  Ask away.”<br />
<br />
“Right!”  Skyla nodded, reaching into her apron pocket.  “First question:  Would you be interested in working the security detail for the Everson mansion?”<br />
<br />
The man cocked an eyebrow before Skyla pulled out the gun and fired again.<br />
<br />
As the green bolt struck his head, his hair receded, turning from black to a bright purple, as similar colored fur spread all over his head.  His brown eyes turned yellow, while his nose and and jaw grew larger, becoming a lion’s muzzle.  His tongue became a bit longer and rougher, while his teeth sharpened.  His ears curled into a rounder shape as they moved to the top of his head.  <br />
<br />
As the purple fur spread down his neck and onto his chest, his muscle started to slowly gain definition.  As the fur spread down his arms, pads swelled up on his hands, and retractable claws poked out the tips of his fingers.  His waist, meanwhile, slimmed down, while his hips expanded.  His overalls remained (guess he didn’t want to get oil in her fur when she could help it), but as his chest began to seemingly swell larger with each breath, it became clear that he was no longer a “he.”  <br />
<br />
A thin, flexible tail slipped out between a buttoned slot in her overalls, and her legs began to shift, becoming more feminine and shapely.  Though covered by boots, her feet shifted to a digitigrade stance, while her toes grew into paws.<br />
<br />
“Of course I’d like to work at the mansion!  It’d be great to finally serve Pam and Cassidy’s Master!”<br />
<br />
“Well, we’re happy to take you.  You can start today, if you like.”<br />
<br />
“Of course I will!”<br />
<br />
“Welcome to the best job you’ll ever have, Drew!”  Henrietta cheered.<br />
<br />
Skyla smiled.   Two down, six to go!<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
The next former gang member on the list, Leo, (what a perfect name, given Skyla’s plans for him,) had been a decent drive away.  His home was pretty small, and looked a bit run down, but given Pam’s research showed he was currently unemployed, she supposed it wasn’t too surprising.  She got out of the car and approached the front door with Henrietta and Drew (who had since removed her overalls and boots, no longer needing them to keep clean on the job).<br />
<br />
She knocked on the door, which was answered by a brown-haired man with a fairly plain build.  “Hello?  How can I-  Drew?  Henrietta?  What are you two doing here?”<br />
<br />
“Head Maid Skyla’s been looking into the background of everyone involved in our old gang, since we’re working at the Everson place now.  Just as a precaution.”<br />
<br />
The man sighed.  “I wanted to put that all behind me.  But if you must know, come in, and ask away.”  He opened the door wider for them, and invited them into his front room.  There was a desk on the side of the room with an old computer on it, a cheap TV sitting on a dresser in the corner, and a handful of old chairs positioned opposite each other.  He motioned for the three anthros to sit down.  “So, what would you like to know?”<br />
<br />
“That’s pretty simple!”  Skyla smiled, and drew the gun.  “Would you be interested in working for the Everson estate?”  And she pulled the trigger.<br />
<br />
Only for the holographic GUI to pop up with an error message.  “Error:  Those Who have fathered children can not became female, nor can a female became younger than her children past child bearing age.”   <br />
<br />
A lot of choice four letter words flew through Skyla’s mind in quick succession.<br />
<br />
The two lionesses looked curiously at the hologram being projected from the gun, while Leo stared in confusion for a moment, trying to figure out why the vixen felt the need to point a toy gun (with flashing lights at the back end, no less) at him while asking the question.  Skyla quickly tucked it back in her pocket.<br />
<br />
“Er, sorry about that, I was looking for my notebook in there…”  Skyla fished around and pulled out her day planner and a pen.  “Now then-” <br />
<br />
“Hold on…  Were you serious about offering me a job?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Henrietta said, “You made it sound like you were doing a background check…  I mean, if any of us deserved a job there, it would be Leo, with how hard he’s been working to get educated and make something of himself, but still…”<br />
<br />
“Well, you see… I-”  Skyla stammered.<br />
<br />
“I desperately need a job, if you are serious…  I’ve been trying everything, but with the economy in the state it’s been I’ve barely been able to get an interview lately.  I’ve got a wife and kids to support, and I can’t bare the thought of them going hungry.  I’ll take any position I’m qualified for.”<br />
<br />
“Well, none of the open positions really require any experience or special education,” Drew said.<br />
<br />
“So there are open positions?”<br />
<br />
Skyla wanted to tear her own ears off. She was strongly regretting not shooting first and asking questions later. Kitty she could tolerate, she could be a maid at least! But this guy?! He wasn&#39;t even that great looking! He wasn&#39;t even-! Agh! Skyla felt her perfectly orderly, perfectly balanced, beautiful little world of just maids and their Master fluttering away... <br />
<br />
She could say no, she should say no, he had every right to say no. No one would question her, no one would defy her, she didn&#39;t owe this man anything! She could just tell him that he didn&#39;t seem right for the job and that would be that! And she could move on to the rest and zap them into the perfect maids she wanted Pamela to have for her little security squad and eye candy! She didn&#39;t even know how to sew men&#39;s clothes! <br />
<br />
But if she did, Master would eventually find out! And when Master did find out, Master would be so disappointed in her! He&#39;d call her selfish! But couldn&#39;t he see that they couldn&#39;t go hiring perfect strangers if they weren&#39;t magically remade to be unconditionally loyal to him?! It was the safety net they had! She had endured hiring Kitty, a human, but now she had to endure hiring a MAN, and not even that good a looking one?! This wasn&#39;t fair! <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Madam, are you okay?&quot; Harriet asked, looking concerned. She shrank back a bit at the look her Head Maid gave her, a deep, fundamental part of her existence wondering if she had done something wrong, and feared she didn&#39;t know how to fix it. <br />
Skyla restrained herself, throwing a temper tantrum was not what a proper maid did, lashing out was not what a proper maid did, nor would she set a bad example to her own maids, and she would not by association make a bad reputation of Master&#39;s estate with any rude or hostile behavior. Skyla resisted the urge to grit her teeth. <br />
<br />
&quot;... We&#39;re hiring security guards... the pay is above minimum wage, and would include room and board for you and any member of your immediate family who is your legal responsibility... You can hammer out any other details with our head of security. You start immediately. As part of the staff, you will address Mr. Everson as Master when in person or not when on the clock. You will address me as Head Maid Skyla, Head Maid, or Madam. As long as you are on the clock, you are not to question mine or Master&#39;s orders.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take it!&quot; Leo said without hesitation. &quot;Madam!&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla did her best to smile, while fighting back screams of frustration.  She couldn’t help but feel this would be the end for their nice orderly world.<br />
<br />
Three down, five to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leo, there&#39;s something I want you to meet. Pamela, come out here, that&#39;s an order.&quot; <br />
<br />
 Pam slipped into the house with all her old talents like child&#39;s play.  &quot;... Yes head maid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pam?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Leo...  Congratulations. I&#39;ll be expecting you bright and early tomorrow.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Head of security at Master&#39;s mansion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... You sure have moved up in the world.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Skyla was never making that mistake again, from now on, she made sure a subject was zappable <i>before</i> offering anything if she was going to play the formal game. She promised never to be cornered like that again. <br />
<br />
And screw doing this one by one, she was going to test out the &#39;wide field&#39; option on this thing! <br />
<br />
Drew, Henrietta, and Pam, together, knew enough about to the remaining members of the gang to persuade each of them to meet in front of the Everson mansion at the same time.  It was a little risky, Skyla knew, if more of them had become fathers than not, but she already had four big cat security guards, (and one human guy) versus five men, most of who had probably genuinely given up their life of crime over a decade ago.  If any of the men proved immune and tried anything, they would send ‘em packing.<br />
<br />
Not to say that Pam thought it was a smart idea, not knowing about what the gun could do, but she was still ultimately willing to go along with it.  Skyla was the Head Maid, after all.<br />
<br />
One by one, the five remaining gang members showed up in front of the house, while Skyla and the big cats watched discreetly from a window inside.  Skyla had only heard a few of the stories the lionesses told their old friends to get them to come, but each one had been told the request to meet here was about something different.  And none of the men had been told other former gang members would show up, adding to some confusion amongst them as more of their old friends arrived.  Some of them looked pretty uncomfortable about the whole thing but as long as they stuck around until all five got here, it wouldn’t be a problem.<br />
<br />
As soon as the fifth guy showed up, Skyla flicked on the ray gun, selected “Wide Beam” and fired.  Green lightning arced from the gun and soared across the yard.  Upon striking one of them, the bolt seems to expand into a sphere that quickly grew to surround the other four.  <br />
<br />
Brightly colored fur quickly appeared on all but one of them, each a different color.  red, green, pink, and orange.  Each of the changing men’s bodies began to slim down, and gain more definition in their physique.  Their hips snapped wider, their waists pinched in slightly, and their chests each swole into an impressive bust.  Their clothes vanished, allowing their new tails to grow out, swaying freely as black tufts of fur formed on the tip of each.<br />
<br />
Their legs became shapely as the fur spread down them while their feet all snapped into a digitigrade stance.  Leathery pads cushioned the bottoms of their feet, and retractable claws replaced their toenails, as their toes shrunk and turned into paws.  Their hands underwent similar changes; pads forming on their palms and fingertips, claws emerging in place of nails, and their fingers growing a little longer and more feminine looking.  Their hair shrank, and changed to match their fur color, while their ears grew rounder, and moved up the sides of their heads.  Their jaws and noses stretched forward into lioness muzzles, their teeth sharpening, and their eyes turning yellow.<br />
<br />
Skyla smiled and headed outside, glancing at Pamela’s list of former gang members, now altered to reflect their new names.<br />
<br />
The one unchanged man watched as the remaining cats came out the door.  “Wait a minute?  Are ALL the girls from the old gang here?  What’s this REALLY about, Drew?  You said this was about a chance to get my hands on some of the good stuff!  I know half of these traitors are too stuck-up to be into that!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, sorry about that, Yorick,” Drew said, not really sounding sorry. “Our boss here, Head Maid Skyla was just looking into the background of the old gang, and she wanted to meet each of them in person to make doubly sure our old relationships wouldn’t be any trouble.  I just figured if I didn’t tell you what you wanted to hear, you wouldn’t come.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, so this fox-lady here wants to know what I think of you all?  This’ll do.”  He made an obscene gesture in Skyla’s direction, then stormed off back toward his car.<br />
<br />
“Yep, looks like old Yorick hasn’t changed much at all,” Cassidy said, folding her arms.  “He’s harmless nowadays, though.”<br />
<br />
“As for the other girls here, though,” Pamela said, “I can vouch for each of ‘em!  When Cassidy and I said we were through with the gang, and Yorick told the whole crew to team up on us for it, all of them refused. They’re not gonna be any trouble, I swear.”<br />
<br />
Sklya smiled.  “I believe you, Pam.”  She turned to the lionesses. “Say, would all of you mind lining up for me?”<br />
<br />
“Of course, Head Maid Skyla,” the six said in sync.  The rainbow of lionesses all stood at attention in the driveway, side-by-side, a smile on their faces.<br />
<br />
“Now then, would each of you please state your name?”<br />
<br />
“Henrietta,” Said the blue one, of course.<br />
<br />
“Drew,” the purple lioness said, naturally.<br />
<br />
“Sandra,” said the red lioness.<br />
<br />
“Becky,” the green lioness said.<br />
<br />
“Denise,” stated the pink lioness.<br />
<br />
“Trish,” the orange lioness finished.<br />
<br />
“Nice to meet all of you,”  Skyla said, looking over her newest additions to Master’s loyal staff with pride (no pun intended). She didn&#39;t think of Master&#39;s maids are dolls to be owned or anything so horrid as that, but she didn&#39;t even try to contain her bubbling delight at seeing the six lionesses lined up, obedient, loyal, eager to serve (like her), having been freed of their mundane lives for the job of being Master&#39;s Maids. <br />
<br />
While she might have preferred fellow kitsune in maid uniforms, Cassidy and Pam had set up a theme with their security maids, and a good maid didn&#39;t hinder the visual appeal of the household, including the staff. <br />
<br />
And visually appeal they did, the bright colors weren&#39;t exactly stealthy, but one of a security force&#39;s object as far as Skyla knew was scaring off potential trouble, rather than straight up fighting it, and these lionesses reminded Skyla of the brightly colored poison frogs in nature. <br />
<br />
“Now, I’ve already asked Henrietta and Drew, but would the rest of you be interested in working under Pamela as security staff for Master?” She asked, already knowing full well the answer. <br />
<br />
“We’d love to, Head Maid Skyla!”  The lion ladies spoke as their smiles grew more eager.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Skyla drank it in, orderly lined up, shapely bodies, chests outs, the mirrored poses and smiles on their faces, their voices like an echo, all but identical lion women with their fur colors being their most separating feature that served only to compliment them and give their numbers and unity the contrast it needed, and able to tear limb from limb anyone who night threaten Master or Anna.  <br />
<br />
These six lionesses embodied the order and calm that Skyla strived to create for Master&#39;s estate, and she knew they wouldn&#39;t let her down. <br />
<br />
Skyla knew some might find it a little creepy, but Skyla was not one of those people. She was Master&#39;s chief maid, it was her reason for existing to insure his maids were as beautiful, efficient and lady-like as they could be as they maintained Master&#39;s ever growing estate... <br />
<br />
Speaking of which... with roughly eight people now transformed since Skyla had laid eyes on the mansion, she couldn&#39;t wait to see if the big house had grown to accommodate their new staff members! <br />
<br />
“You’re all hired!  You start today!  With... a less security related assignment.  Helping Janet and Luna move in along with any other maids who will be added to our staff.”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing, Head Maid Skyla!”  <br />
<br />
As the lionesses filed into the mansion, their steps echoing like troopers on the march, Skyla sighed in contentment.  It felt good to be able to just let loose and have some fun, to help her de-stress after dealing with discovering her new age yesterday, and the many disappointments today.  Seeing these six ex-gang members now loyal members of Master&#39;s staff, all grinning and standing at attention gave her a satisfaction that was like a cool spring breeze after what she&#39;d had to deal with in the last 24-hours. <br />
<br />
And, looking at the time, Master was liable to get home any minute now.  She could make a little time in her schedule to tend to any needs of his personally, and…<br />
<br />
As if on cue, she saw Master’s car pulling into the driveway.  But…  She could only see Meredith through the window.<br />
<br />
As soon as the mouse maid had parked the car and stepped out, Skyla rushed up to her.  “Meredith?  Where’s Master?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, no need to worry, Head Maid Skyla,”  Meredith replied, “Master simply wanted some privacy while he went to a movie with Danielle.  He’ll be taking Susan’s bus back home once they’ve finished.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, thanks.”  Skyla nodded, as Meredith headed inside.  She was glad nothing had happened to Master.  She couldn’t bear the thought of-  <br />
<br />
Wait…  <br />
<br />
He wanted some privacy?<br />
<br />
While watching a movie?<br />
<br />
With <I>Danielle?</I><br />
<br />
Suddenly, all  that stress that making the lioness pride had eased, came back, and then some.<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
A part of Skyla wanted to find out what movie theater, zap the teller to let her inside, and spy on them for the entire movie... But that would be violating Master&#39;s trust in a such a way that Skyla could only think of as blaspheme. <br />
<br />
She stumbled back into the house, seeing her new little lionesses moving like clockwork as they found out where Luna and the other new maids were, what their home addresses were, and swiftly got details of what to handle and how... Not to mention their own moving in as Pamela&#39;s security force. Skyla realized she&#39;d be dealing with paperwork tonight since how she phrased the question to the lionesses meant they were NOT retroactive part of the staff like Cassidy or Pamela. Which meant having to make copies of contracts, having to ask his new maids (and having Pamela ask Leo) a slew of questions that ranged from mundane to personel. <br />
<br />
Skyla would have felt cheated at fate&#39;s sense of humor with her high being taken away at a moment&#39;s notice, but she was thinking more about Master and Danielle. What did that jenny have that Skyla didn&#39;t? <br />
<br />
Skyla wondered as a kitsune if she could change her appearance to be something more appealing to Master&#39;s tastes, but knew Master would find that unappealing by its very nature. Master&#39;s sense of lust was separate from his sense of love. Danielle... was going on a date with Master... Danielle. She didn&#39;t even work here as a proper maid! <br />
<br />
&quot;Head Maid Skyla.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla looked down to see Morgan, the little kitten holding her briefcase on wheels. Skyla looked around. &quot;Where are your bodyguards?&quot; Skyla wished she could just zap them, but knowing her luck, something else would come along to knock that high down too. <br />
<br />
&quot;With our new security personnel, their being at the estate feels gratuitous. I just wanted to go over some of Master&#39;s recent acquisitions with you, you have an innate talent over the years of for finding those who are eager and willing to serve Master without question, heh, I wonder how you could have done as an army recruiter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan just made a joke? Now Skyla knew the kitten was happier in spite of keeping her strict attitude. <br />
<br />
Morgan continued. &quot;If you happen to find anyone who&#39;d be to act as manager and bartender of Master&#39;s bar...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master owns a bar?!&quot; Skyla knew Master would NEVER agree to that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, in name Master does, it&#39;s just one of a few minor businesses that came up for sale and I saw an opportunity to expand our portfolio. Master has always given me total freedom to act in his best financial best interests as long as it isn&#39;t detrimental to anyone&#39;s economic survival.&quot; Morgan &#39;reminded&#39; her with a defiant pout. <br />
<br />
It slowly dawned on Skyla that not all of the former gang members she zapped at once had been unemployed or hobos... so any success they had was assimilated into Master&#39;s holdings? Hopefully this didn&#39;t apply if he say zapped a gun dealer, Skyla knew Master would cut off his own finger before ever touching any business that deal with selling <i>weapons</i>.<br />
<br />
Morgan had a predator grin on her face like a kitten who saw a mouse. &quot;Imagine if we found enough loyalists to run the bar completely, there are plenty of sad pathetic men who wouldn&#39;t mind paying extra just to be treated as part of the elite for a hour or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla gave the kitten a stern look. &quot;No. Anyone who serve Master, serve Master, them serving customers with that same reverence would be drinking poison to them, NO Morgan!&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan bowed her head without hesitation, it was strange how their dynamic had changed so swiftly in a day. &quot;Yes Head Maid Skyka! I will drop the pursuit completely!&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla rubbed her eyebrows, how quickly moods changed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear.&quot; She heard a little mouse say.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Meredith? Did the mansion catch fire?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Nothing like that Madam!&quot; Meredith bowed, having done so running putting Master&#39;s things back in place. &quot;But Simone&#39;s parents want to know if Master will be able to attend her fiddle performance next week, but if Master is now, erm, otherwise engaged, I don&#39;t want Master to feel guilty or obligated, but Simone really wants Master to be there!&quot; <br />
<br />
Skyla groaned. &quot;Let Master make his own decisions, if he wants to feel obligated, that&#39;s his choice. Tell him after he gets back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Head Maid Skyla.&quot; Meredith bowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Madam,&quot; Morgan said, &quot;You seem stressed, why don&#39;t you take a dip in the hot tub? The mansion isn&#39;t going to fall apart if you take a break.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla stared at Morgan, more at Morgan suggesting a break than the new the mansion now had a hot tub. She recovered herself, and like a true Kitsune, immediately came up with a way to get there without looking like she was suffering from alzheimer&#39;s. And a hottub did sound nice... &quot;Certainly... If you&#39;ll join me Morgan...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? But I&#39;ve got-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So do I remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Head Maid SKyla, if you order me, then-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I&#39;m not going to order you, you&#39;re going to volunteer..&quot; Skyla grinned sadistically...  then leaned down and blew on Morgan&#39;s belly, making the kitten laugh, and Skyla began to tickle her without mercy.<br />
<br />
Morgan began laughing, and Meredith by association began to laugh at the sight too. <br />
<br />
Morgan finally said, &quot;I&#39;ll go! I&#39;ll go! I <i>volunteer!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla stopped, smiling, helping her up. &quot;There we go. Lead the way!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll arrange the paperwork for the new Maids Madam!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good Meredith.&quot; <br />
<br />
Morgan did indeed lead Skyla to their &#39;new&#39; hot tub... still carrying her wheeled briefcase. Skyla wondered if the estate now had a second basement furbished out for their security team since Pamela had set a precedent for where the security staff would have their rooms, likely close to the &#39;command center&#39; Pamela was likely to have as the mansion expanded... Skyla wondered if they had an underground vault yet. That would explain why the estate didn&#39;t seem that different yet. <br />
<br />
But once in the backyard, Skyla saw that had indeed expanded, having at least doubled in size, and the Shinto and christian shrines had been joined by a buddhist one. There was a garden that would indeed give Kitty plenty to do on her workdays. Skyla knew zapping more people to take care of the estate was a self feeding cycle... but she found that she didn&#39;t care. In fact, she welcomed it. <br />
<br />
And indeed... there was a hot tub... complete with a changing room like a japanese bathhouse. Morgan just needed to take off her bell collar, but Skyla needed to take off her maid uniform... Being naked next to her former boss didn&#39;t feel nearly as awkward as it should have. <br />
<br />
The hot tub was running and ready for use on the spot, and there was a reminder whiteboard of whose job it was on a daily basis on to keep things here clean. <br />
<br />
Skyla slipped in, admitting the flowing hot water felt like a whole new experience against her fur... and Morgan slowly slipped in, reluctantly at first... but if Skyla needed this, it was clear that Morgan needed it even more! The kitten practically melted with the comfort the hot tub provided.<br />
<br />
Skyla leaned back... letting the stress melt away, for a moment there was no paper working waiting for her, no Kitty, no Leo, no Danelle... there was nothing but peaceful bliss with her and her tails. <br />
&quot;I TOLD YOU THEY WERE HAVING FUN IN THE HOT TUB! COME ON!&quot; <br />
<br />
Skyla startled as she watched the four little junior maids practically leap into the hot tub, Simone not needing to undress jumped right into the water, the hardy dragonling not suffering from her antics at all, and if anything Skyla noticed that the temperature of the hot tub seemed to rise as the hot little dragon landed in, tiny bubbles actually forming on her scales. <br />
<br />
Kasai landed in next, fluttering her wings about like a bird taking a bath, splashing water everywhere. Emma just teleported out of her maid uniform, took Eva&#39;s hand, and teleported the little bunny out of hers and straight into the hot tub from the neck down, the water displacement from the teleportation instantly rising the level of the hottub. <br />
<br />
Morgan yelped. Skyla started. &quot;Girls! What are you all doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We live here!&quot; Emma and Kasai said at once. <br />
<br />
&quot;We help here!&quot; Simone and Eva cheered punching up little fists. <br />
<br />
&quot;THe princess of the hot tub is here!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not my princess, I didn&#39;t vote for you.&quot; Emma said wirely. <br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t vote for princesses!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly!&quot; <br />
<br />
Simone splashed the unicorn girl who instantly splashed her back, which got on Eva who splashed for the collateral damage, which splashed Kasai who practically floated right at the top like a swan, and poor Morgan caught in the middle. In no time at all, a battle royal splash war had been declared! The toddlers splashing water everywhere! And Simone doing what dragons did best but spitting water rather than fire.  Even Morgan had dropped her serious attitude, and seemed to genuinely be having fun with the other girls. Eva then dived underneath Morgan and pulled her under. Skyla waited for a couple seconds before pulling them up. <br />
<br />
&quot;No keeping each other&#39;s head beneath the water.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Madam!&quot; The rabbit and kitten said.<br />
<br />
Then Morgan splashed Eva in the face, and the water duel was on! Morgan... was smiling. In that moment she forgot all her responsibilities, and for a moment was just a kitten having fun.<br />
<br />
Skyla laughed... in a sincere way that she truly didn&#39;t understand... just seeing these kids just being kids gave her more energy and life than she thought possible. Kasai and Eva would be dead right now if not for them... And instead they were having the time of their lives having a water battle with three other kids with Skyla as inopportune referee! Skyla felt... happy? <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
All good things come to an end, and eventually Skyla had to get out, and she got the junior maids out too... she wasn&#39;t about to let them continue playing without a lifeguard, she wasn&#39;t stupid. <br />
<br />
They junior maids were reluctant, but her status as head maid held firm. Those of them that didn&#39;t go around in the fur and scales were soon dressed (even if it seemed to be a fashion statement rather than having anything visible). <br />
<br />
She almost felt sorry for Kathy having to clean this all up in the morning, almost. <br />
<br />
And paperwork wasn&#39;t just going to go away... bidding the junior maids good evening, Skyla headed for her office, but bumped into Anna looking at her cellphone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Excuse me!&quot; Anna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening Anna... I&#39;ve made some new additions to the household...&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna looked at the ant colony&#39;s worth of activity as the lionesses were filling empty rooms and moving other boxes full of personal items down stairs, driving out of the driveway and into the driveway like a well oiled machine. Skyla couldn&#39;t help but smile seeing the group transformed maids working together like one maid. They&#39;d have all the newly recruited maids all moved in no time! <br />
<br />
&quot;I see that... I bet they&#39;re be a real help in keeping big brother safe from anyone who might try to rob us again... Good job Skyla.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I chatted with Drew... she&#39;s nice. I guess most of Pamela and Cassidy&#39;s friends get a new start... And they told me about Leo, I&#39;m proud of you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Skyla didn&#39;t respond. <br />
<br />
Anna looked at her phone again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna are you okay?&quot; Skyla felt no obligation to tell Anna her big brother was on a date with Danella! <br />
<br />
&quot;I got a text message from my friends... who were in my special class...&quot;<br />
<br />
The gears turned in Skyla&#39;shead. &quot;Well that&#39;s a relief!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is... For a while, I was worried that now that... I wasn&#39;t born like that... that I wouldn&#39;t even know them anymore... but we&#39;re still friends... somehow...&quot; Anna looked positively relieved when she said that. <br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;And they&#39;re wondering where I&#39;ve been doing since I haven&#39;t messaged them in a while... not since big brother made me a maid... Not that they know that. I guess with everything that happened... they... just slipped my mind... I&#39;m happy I didn&#39;t forget to feed Noni...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need to do that anymore, Master has servants to do that for you... you&#39;re a maid like us, but you&#39;re still Master&#39;s sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but she&#39;s my pet, my responsibility, I always felt so proud of never forgetting to feed or wash her before I became a maid. Skyla I&#39;ll be using the ray gun for the most of tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla said, &quot;So you&#39;re going to zap your friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... if they want to be furry animals...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re going to have the aware option on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what? I want them to appreciate it if they want it, and they&#39;ll be unconditionally loving and loyal to Master anyway... So why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it&#39;ll make things awkward as more maids are changed and they have to have things explained to them too when things change...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re my friends Skyla.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is nepotism you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t that what we&#39;ve been doing?&quot; <br />
<br />
Skyla gave Anna the ray gun. &quot;If Master wants it tomorrow, then he gets it, no questions asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. But I&#39;m sure he won&#39;t mind what I&#39;m planning.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two gave each other a hug good evening, and Skyla marched to her office, she still had that paperwork to do.</p>
