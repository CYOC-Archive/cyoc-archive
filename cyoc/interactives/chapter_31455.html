<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>A few minutes after leaving the strange statues, your mind clears, not even paying them any attention. Your focus was on the open road ahead of you. Since it was late at night, you decided it would be best for the autopilot to drive you home so you didn't have to strain your eyes, scanning the road constantly for crossing animals or objects laying in the middle of the road. Thankful your model of hover-car had the autopilot feature, you lay back in your seat and just relax. The area was very dark, the only light was provided by the stars above, the full moon and the beams coming from your headlights. Looking out the moon-roof you gaze up at the stars, enjoying them as you couldn't before while living in the city. Ever since you lived out in the country, technically out in the middle of nowhere, you always took the time to enjoy them each and every night. Getting slightly nauseous, you sit back upright in your seat, thinking it was just a slight case of motion sickness... but you never had that happen to you before. Ignoring it, you look out the driver's side window, peering into the blackness. At first you saw nothing, but quickly the blackness became lighter, the trees and the spaces in between could be seen. Wondering how it was possible that a second ago you couldn't see them, you close your eyes thinking it would go away. However, when you reopened your eyes, the forest was even clearer than before! Deciding that you were losing your mind, you place your attention on the road in front of you, but even that was hard to do! You could see for miles beyond what the light allowed you to see, much clearer than any headlight could even produce. Knowing something was wrong, you grab the lever releasing the back of your seat and you laid completely on your back, closing your eyes and tried to rest.</br>
<br>While you lay there, calming yourself down, resting and letting the hover-car do what it was programmed to, you notice a slight buzzing in your ear. Both your ears twitched subtly, listening for that buzzing sound, trying to figure out where it was coming from. Trying to ignore it, you realize only made it worse, your ears straining even harder to hear it... to REALLY hear it! Suddenly, an image pops into your mind, seeing it as clear as day with your eyes closed. You see an image of the fans under the hover-car which produced the hover effect and your momentum forward. You realize then that you were hearing the fans, which was not supposed to happen. Clearly, you needed to get the car into the shop, thinking there had to be something wrong with all the features. You figure that the headlights must be producing more light than usual and the fans must be working overtime or something was breaking down in them, even though the ride wasn't different from any other day when you couldn't hear the humming of the fans.</br>
<br>As you were nearing your house, feeling the hover-car slow down slightly, the nausea you were experiencing earlier still had not left you. Thinking you might need a breath of fresh air, you open the windows and feel the cool breeze of the nighttime air waft into the car, brushing against your skin. A cold chill runs through your body quickly, giving you goosebumps. Smelling something different in the air, you sniff more noticeably, trying to figure out what you were smelling. You could smell pine from the trees around you, while the hint of dew covered grass also invaded your nose. Now you know something is just odd about that night all together and close th window to rid yourself of the invading smells. When the inside of the hover-car filled with heat again, you get another cold chill, noticing that your cheek was still a bit cold. Placing your hand on your cheek, you feel the roughness of an unshaven face. Curious to see what you know you felt, you turn the camera used for the rear-view hologram toward you. Hitting the button to turn it on, an image of your face with a very dark five o'clock shadow presents itself. Again, you think this to be strange as you shaved with your preset auto razor right before you left for Cardiff and there was no way that your beard could have grown in that quickly if your auto razor shaved you correctly. You decide that you definitely need to get things checked out, both the car and now your auto razor.</br>
<br>The car slowed down even more, now to a seemingly standstill speed of thirty miles per hour. You look around and see your house just up ahead, all aglow with the lights you had installed around the outside of the building just to make it stand out from the nothingness that was all abound in the countryside. Thankful you were home, you cheered inwardly, knowing that these strange differences would end as soon as you got out of your car. When the car slowed, eventually stopping, coming to a halt at your front steps, you turn the car off. The lights go out, the whir of the fans slow, gently setting you down on the smooth pavement underneath. Checking to see if things remained the way they were without the car being on, you realize that while you couldn't see as far, you still could see a fair distance beyond the lights of the house, just as clearly as it would have been in the middle of the day. Stepping out of the car, your ears and nose were bombarded simultaneously with smells and sounds. You could hear each cricket chirping on it's own, even though there was a cacophony of them playing simultaneously. You could even smell the fresh, dew covered grass around your home along with the chlorine that kept the water in the fountain clean at all times. Not believing what your senses were telling you, you hurry into the house where you were sure that nothing would be out of the ordinary, but you quickly realized that you were wrong!</br></p>
