<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danny sighed as the mouse on screen missed the icon by inches. His whole body twitched as he attempted to correct the angle, best as he could as a mostly inanimate cock. Hugo&#39;s set-up with the computer had been a completely last ditch attempt, obviously. Really, he hadn&#39;t cared too hard that he had been dicked by Hugo&#39;s weird camera. A bet was a bet, even if he had had a beer inside him to help make the decision. <br />
<br />
Still, he had to wonder why Hugo had been so insistant to avoid the matter of changing him back. Lots of his frat-bros, dicks of all sizes and shapes at the moment, were getting played with. Besides Dave and William, they didn&#39;t seem to care too much about the couple of days they&#39;d been dicked. Though, then again, he&#39;d been in one of those containment tanks himself, floating and being lost in a sea of pure bliss, only able to cum and watch more dicks getting jacked off. Shit, it would be hard to go back to normal sex after that experience.<br />
<br />
Life as a regular human didn&#39;t seem that great in comparison... Well, no, that was a lie, but maybe he&#39;d ask Hugo to dick him again as a favor later. Or at least ask where he could find a camera like that for himself.<br />
<br />
The typical pneumatic hiss of the air valves in the lab&#39;s doors rang through the air. Danny would have dismissed it as Hugo&#39;s return, but then he heard a mild &quot;What the fuck?&quot; in a somewhat familiar voice. Hell, he&#39;d heard it just a few hours ago through the computer screen, even.<br />
<br />
Except it had come from his left. George was standing right there, towering like a mountain near the desk as his eyes roamed around the very penis-themed set-up of Hugo&#39;s place. <br />
<br />
George wasn&#39;t bad looking. A bit plain, but he had a nice jaw, good haircut and thick arms. Just, too antisocial for Danny&#39;s taste. But still, hey, the guy had worked great with him for their projects and he&#39;d been happy to get him as a lab partner. He had even rolled with it when he&#39;d accidentally revealed that he had been dicked at a party. <br />
<br />
Not as much as he had thought, apparently, judging by the fact that he was standing in the middle of Hugo&#39;s place. <br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get here?&quot; Danny asked, confused. &quot;I don&#39;t even know Hugo&#39;s address.&quot;<br />
<br />
George smirked, and the arrogant tilt of those lips made Danny&#39;s body stiffen a little. What would they be like around his dickhead? What would it feel like to have those run over his shaft and lick him?  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. I just broke through his firewalls. Guy&#39;s internet security is crazy, but I&#39;m better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Danny said, trying to think of a way to convince George to maybe suck him off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, you look alone. That&#39;s perfect. Makes things easier, really.&quot; He reached forward and plucked Danny from the desk&#39;s top. Then, brought him up to eye level, licking his lips as Danny yelped from the rough handling. &quot;I just need to find that dicking tech you talked about and then we&#39;ll be set to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go?&quot;<br />
<br />
The smirk turned into a full-blown lecherous grin. &quot;You&#39;re coming with me, Danny. I&#39;m done waiting for you to notice me. When I&#39;m through with you, you&#39;ll be begging to stay my personal dildo. You&#39;ll forget you even had a name other than &#39;George&#39;s toy&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny stared in shock as George&#39;s hands pulled his boxers&#39; waistband and showed the opening gape. Through the shadow, Danny saw the outline of a nice, thick penis, stirring. <br />
<br />
George shoved him in, rubbing him hard against the fabric of his underwear and carelessly twisting him to fit the tight space. A split second, and the hand covering his body let go, pulled await, and all light vanished, snuffed out. The zipping sound of pants fly never sounded so ominous before. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d never been this close to another dick before. Oh, he&#39;d slept with plenty of guys, but it was always him on top. Almost always him getting the blowjobs. He never even had to ask, they threw themselves at him. Even those few times when he felt the need to suck on some cock, it never struck him as badly as it did now that he had been reduced to his own penis. <br />
<br />
That was just a tool for a guy&#39;s pleasure. Just slightly thicker than him, veinier.  So, he thought with a sudden thrill, what did that make him? A tool. No, not even that. A toy. George&#39;s personal sex toy. A guy he&#39;d never really looked at twice before, and here he was getting nice and personal with George&#39;s dick, powerless to do anything but wait for his release.<br />
<br />
Precum drooled out of his slit. Fuck. The boxers, crazy as that sounded, were getting even more restrictive. Soft, fluffy fabric squeezed against Danny, pushed back against his stiff shaft, forcing him flat against George&#39;s throbbing cock. Heat irradiated  from George&#39;s skin, and Danny felt every pulse of blood in that one vein on the underside of George&#39;s fuckstick. -- Fuck -- That&#39;s what he was, huh? -- a fucking sex toy. <br />
<br />
Rough fingers adjusted him through the boxers, manhandled him. He could only protest, muffled as that sounded against the boxers&#39; suffocating embrace. He was at George&#39;s mercy. And his lab partner apparently had none. Distantly, Danny heard him say &quot;fuuuck,&quot; right when George&#39;s cock jolted from all the shuffling around.  <br />
<br />
And then, the fabric was pinched away from Danny&#39;s dickhead. By reflex, he tried to breath, though that was unnecessary in his current state. More of that musk, more of the sweat. Danny&#39;s mind went blank for a split second from sheer want. The dark fabric just inches from him darkened as a glob of pre landed right there. Trimmed pubes tickled his body, wrinkled skin rubbed against the sensitive flesh of his lubed dickhead. He was face-first against George&#39;s balls.  <br />
<br />
Something hot and wet dripped against the base of his shaft. Danny&#39;s balls tightened. Fuck, why wasn&#39;t George just rubbing them already! Fuck being afraid, he just wanted to cum! He&#39;d be George&#39;s toy, so long as he started jerking him off right now! <br />
<br />
But instead, the world jolted with the sudden spin of George&#39;s hips, and a split second dizziness, combined with the suffocating prison of clothes around him, muffled the rumbling thunder of his captor&#39;s voice. &quot;... not fair that you... even get tech like... dick...&quot;<br />
<br />
That hadn&#39;t been adressed to him. Hugo? <br />
<br />
&quot; -are you?&quot; it sounded. <br />
<br />
The giant dick started to shrink, brushing foreskin against Danny&#39;s ballsack, and through the flash of sexual bliss, Danny could only beg &quot;No, no, don&#39;t stop now!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... help you... genius with computers... Danny, fuck, I&#39;ll give you a cover story!&quot; the last part, clearly audible, shouted desperately as it was. <br />
<br />
Weightlessness hit Danny a split second before the boxers suddenly loosened, and he was falling through the billowing drapes of fabric and denim. Darkness weakened only just, when glimpses of light came through the see-through tents floating down and the opening of George&#39;s shirt. <br />
<br />
George&#39;s dick landed right on top of him, cutting any contemplation short. It pinned him to the ground, bringing back every inch of pleasure he&#39;d been drowning himself in just a few seconds ago. Danny... wouldn&#39;t have moved even if he had been able to. He waited as the tiles vibrated from the steps of a man (Hugo, he would think), hoping for George&#39;s rough handling until he realized that his lab partner&#39;s cock wasn&#39;t connected to a groin or hips anymore. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like you got a firsthand look at that dicking technology, huh, George?&quot; he chuckled, relieved and disappointed at the same time.</p>
