<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He had to find those runes if he wanted to return to normal and get out of this sick game. Taking a deep breath he forced himself to relax and looked around the kitchen once more. There were a lot of hiding places here, deserving more than just a passing glance, especially when he had no way of telling how well hidden the runes might be. They might be inside something for all he knew and that was a frightening thought. If everything in the house was going to change him in some way then there&#39;d be no way for him to escape, but maybe that was what the sick furry fuck who&#39;d done this to him wanted, to trap him in a game where there was no hope of winning. Maybe ti would be better to give up and get it over with rather than play along.<br />
<br />
No, he shook his head violently. There was no way of knowing that and until he was certain he wasn&#39;t going to give up hope, that would be playing into their hands and there was no way he&#39;d give up without a fight.<br />
<br />
Kneeling down, he looked in the cabinets. There was the least in them, so it felt like the safest way to start.<br />
<br />
Sure enough he saw light reflecting off of something behind the mousetrap. Carefully he reached in, using the flashlight to carefully move one of the boxes of cereal out of the way, figuring that as long as he didn&#39;t directly touch anything with his hands then he&#39;d be safe.<br />
<br />
Harold smiled, pleased at himself for discovering what he hoped was a loophole. If it was then his chances of getting out of this improved drastically.<br />
<br />
Yes, there was definitely something purple and shiny back there. Adjusting his grip on the flashlight, he reached for it with his free hand, using the flashlight to nudge it closer, just to be safe.<br />
<br />
Then he got a good look at the thing and his heart rate spiked.<br />
<br />
It was a leftover piece of Halloween candy in a purple foil wrapper adorned with cartoonish looking spiders.<br />
<br />
Pulse pounding in his ears he jerked his hand back.<br />
<br />
It was a reflexive action and it saved him from toughing the candy and initiating whatever transformation that it would have caused, but in his haste he forgot about the mousetrap and stifled a scream of pain when it snapped shut on two of his fingers.<br />
<br />
Cursing quietly he fell backwards and stared at his hand and the trap stuck to it.<br />
<br />
Fuck that hurt.<br />
<br />
Tears blurred his vision as he pulled it off and wiggled his fingers.<br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t feel broken, which was a small mercy.<br />
<br />
Rubbing at his watering eyes he sat there, waiting for the pain to pass and staring at his hands. Any moment he expected to see them changing.<br />
<br />
Caught up in his expectations he failed to notice the twinges starting at the base of his spine until, with a pulling sensation, he found himself suddenly uncomfortable with the way he was sitting on the floor. It wasn&#39;t just the cold tile against his bare ass, it felt like he was sitting on something. Rocking forward alleviated the discomfort, but also made him more aware of a new development. It wasn&#39;t just his ass pressing against the floor, he could feel something else.<br />
<br />
A slender, hairless tail was growing from the base of his spine.<br />
<br />
As he examined it the appendage continued to grow longer and thicker, though it remained hairless. It twisted and writhed in his hand, muscles growing stronger as it lashed across the kitchen floor.<br />
<br />
That wasn&#39;t the only thing that was happening though. He could feel the cursed cockring tingling around his cock as his perpetual erection throbbed harder than ever.<br />
<br />
Abandoning his examination of his tail he began to stroke his cock. If felt good, so very good, almost like the curse had made him more sensitive. Then again he&#39;d already come once that evening and his cock had been hard since, to maybe it was that.<br />
<br />
The tingling grew more intense, especially around the base of his cock, the throbbing spreading down to his balls, heavy and full of cum. Closing his eyes Harold leaned back and began to jack off, hand sliding frantically up and down his cock. This wasn&#39;t about enjoying himself, it was about getting release as soon as possible. The sooner he was done with it the sooner he could continue with the search and get back to normal.<br />
<br />
His cock throbbed in his hands and his balls ached and churned, resting heavily against his thighs. Panting, he leaned forward to take pressure off of his still growing tail, spreading his legs as he did so. The cool tile was soothing against his balls, which felt overly full. he could practically feel them swelling, pressure building within them as they tightened as climax approached.<br />
<br />
Never in his life had he felt the need to come so badly, but it wasn&#39;t happening, not yet at least. His frantic efforts to relieve himself were almost painful, but he remained on the edge, pressure continuing to build in his balls.<br />
<br />
It hurt so much, like he was going to burst, but at the same time the pain felt almost good.<br />
<br />
He kept at it, losing track of time and even where he was, until, tail lashing wildly he came, his long, furry ears pressing flat against his head as he let out a moan of pleasure. It was explosive, gout after gout of cum jetting across the kitchen, splattering against the cabinets and floor, oozing down his hand. One particularly strong spurt he was sure hit the ceiling.<br />
<br />
The cockring started to tingle again, and the flow abated to a mere trickle as the magic shifted to once again deny him. His cock ached and his balls tingled, considerably lightened by the impossible amount he&#39;d cum, but still feeling distended and overly full.<br />
<br />
Shifting his weight he tried to sit up, first hurting his tail, and then, when he rocked forward sitting on his balls.<br />
<br />
Sitting...on his balls...<br />
<br />
He froze, eyes shooting open as he looked down.<br />
<br />
It was hard to see without the flashlight, but he could certainly feel them resting against his thighs, reaching down at least halfway to his knees. Unable to believe what he was seeing, he groped himself. Those were indeed his balls, as large as a pair of footballs on his lap it took both hands to hold just one of them, their heavy weight strange, yet familiar in his hands. The skin over them felt softer and was covered in a fine layer of down fur rather than curls of coarse hair.<br />
<br />
Hands shaking, he reached for the flashlight.<br />
<br />
It felt larger in his grip, considerably so.<br />
<br />
That was something for later consideration. Right now there were more important things to focus on.<br />
<br />
Like his balls.<br />
<br />
In the light he could see that they were every bit as large as they&#39;d felt, their newly soft skin covered in a fine layer of silvery gray fur.<br />
<br />
The bitch had lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until he heard the disembodied voice that he realized he&#39;d spoken out loud. Funhouse_furry was back to torment him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said that you&#39;d be stuck forever once your cock and balls changed. This is just your balls and the change to them certainly is impressive. Your cock&#39;s going to be the last change, but don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ve got a long way to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice vanished into giggles that slowly faded, leaving him sitting in silence.<br />
<br />
The response did little to reassure him, especially when he looked down at his massive, misshapen balls. They hadn&#39;t just grown enormous and furry, the shape of them was wrong.<br />
<br />
Forcing himself to look away Harold stood up, balls bouncing against his thighs and swinging like an enormous, meaty pendulum. His new tail swung behind him to help him balance as he took a cautious step forward. The kitchen looked larger, the table and counters higher.<br />
<br />
No, he realized, with growing fear, he&#39;d shrunk, losing at least a foot of height to give him a more rodentine size in addition to his rat balls and tail.<br />
<br />
First donkey ears, now this.</p>
