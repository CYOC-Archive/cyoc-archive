<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anna, Siamese,Adorable, nude. Skyla, vixen kitsune (5 tails), maid. Were so far the two that Master had changes that were aware of their former lives. <br />
<br />
only two of his &#39;creations&#39; so far aware of their former reality. But both felt a unspoken understanding, an instinctive need to add to Master&#39;s staff, enough that he could live comfortably and not worry about a thing. Obviously some of those changed wouldn&#39;t be able to practically leave their jobs, but there would be plenty who&#39;d be more than willing to.<br />
<br />
And the more Anna and Skyla thought about it, the more they didn&#39;t give a damn about their former lives, Master had obviously improved them both, and they&#39;d bring as many into the fold as Master needed to life the comfortable carefree life they wanted him to have. <br />
<br />
As the default &#39;head maid&#39;, given she was the one made aware of their former lives, and her new standing as a maid for Master, Skyla thought about how she&#39;d have to look after Master&#39;s practical needs. <br />
<br />
She&#39;d make that clear with Meredith when she showed up this evening. Not that she&#39;d tell her she used to be a human male, no need to ruin the life Meredith had now with a life that had never existed. Right now Master&#39;s house and fianaces was far too small for them all to become live-in servants, but hopefully that would change. <br />
<br />
Anna on the other hand, being in the fur, and being Master&#39;s sister, and would look after his emotional happiness, even if that meant say, lying to him, since he had given her explicit instructions not to follow orders that she had no desire to. And her greatest desire was to see her brother, Master, happy.<br />
<br />
The two furry conspirators looked at each other and smiled, thinking of how to best bring about things to the best possible outcome for their Master. He was clearly going to need some pushing to fully accept the gift he&#39;d been granted, but they could manage. <br />
<br />
Sadly, Master HAD given a direct order NOT to zap anyone else without his express say so. And Skyla, in spite of her own good intentions, wouldn&#39;t go against Master&#39;s direct orders. And Anna said she&#39;d hold back for the moment. This put a serious damper on their plans. <br />
<br />
Thankfully Master had left the ray gun in back seat, with Anna now riding in the front seat with her brother. Skyla looked at the controls as Anna silently handed it her. Skyla frowned when there seemed to be no way to permanently lock out &#39;awareness&#39; or such, -yet-, hopefully future updates would give some way to &#39;lock out&#39; unwanted features. It would get awkward very fast if all of master&#39;s maids and companions were aware of their past lives. Skyla consider herself and Anna aware as a necessary evil to help Master embrace being Master. Not that she wanted him to rule the world with an iron fist or own a brothel or some horrid nonsense like that, but Master had won the lottery, and Skyla and Anna both intended to make sure he enjoyed it. <br />
<br />
Thankfully the idea of making the others changed so far &#39;aware&#39; hadn&#39;t occurred to Master, and so much the better for it and them continuing to live their lives if they weren&#39;t to directly help Master with acquiring new maids. <br />
<br />
Skyla casually noted an empty discard purse in the parking lot, and picked it up curiously. She was surprised when it turned from white to black, and gained white frills with a mudflap outline of a feral four tail kitsunes on the sides. Her eyes widened slightly. Well, her reason for living was now to be Master&#39;s maid and... she realized wearing anything else that didn&#39;t fit WITH that maid theme somehow felt unnatural to her, like wearing the wrong skin.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Master wait!&quot; <br />
<br />
Master stopped the car. &quot;Yes Skyla?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as we&#39;re here, can we get a bite to eat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have any cash on me remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I have my credit card master, and I&#39;m sure they have an ATM machine inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cautious, Master nodded, alright. <br />
<br />
The trio entered the fast food place. No giving the naked cat woman, or the fox woman maid so much as a blink of an eye. A little girl with her mother saying the cat lady looked cute, and the mother just smiling and nodded. Skyla and Anna both thought how cuter they&#39;d look serving Master, but Master&#39;s orders were orders. <br />
<br />
And indeed, there was a cash machine. Skyla frowned, she&#39;d sincerely wished there hadn&#39;t been. She made sure that Anna had the ray gun, since unlike her, Anna still had a leeway with it. Still, Anna fiddled with the settings all the same for fun. <br />
<br />
That was when a scrawny little man with a five o&#39;clock shadow walked in, followed by a burly man dressed well with short blond hair. The smaller man, wearing a black base ball cap, pushed to the front of the counter and said. &quot;E-excuse! T-this is a robbery!&quot; The little man pulled out a gun, or it was plastic gun painted to look like a real one, who could tell these days? <br />
<br />
Everyone stood stock still. The big man just stood there silently, watching everyone, but in particular the skinny man like a hawk. No one moved, and that included Master. Everyone&#39;s breath was caught in their throats. <br />
<br />
&quot;J-just give the money, please, and no one will get hurt.&quot; <br />
<br />
The robber hand was shaking, making the gun vibrate. The woman at the counter reached under the counter, beginning to pull the cash out. The thief&#39;s eyes darted away, looking almost as terrified as everyone&#39;s else. The big man was disturbingly calm. <br />
<br />
Scared and holding a gun, a lethal combination. The little girl from before dropped her happy meal toy, the plastic plaything hit the floor with a clank. The big man gave a glance. The thief gave a yelp, and there was a banging sound. The woman behind the counter stood in shock, not crying out, there was now a red hole in her chest. <br />
<br />
None looked more terrified than the robber. &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!&quot; <br />
<br />
Anna had had enough. She didn&#39;t fire at the thief first. She fired at the woman had been shot first. Instantly the woman&#39;s wound healed, in fact, it was erased from existence, since it was logically the only way to ever truly heal from a gun shot to the chest. Her uniform turned into black satin, her apron turned white and gained white frills, her name tag stayed pretty much the same. While Anna couldn&#39;t see, her shoes and socks vanished, leaving her bare foot, and a hole appeared in the rear of her dress. Her dress was more conservative than Skyla&#39;s, without a blouse cut, and white frilly sleeves reached to her wrists. <br />
<br />
Short white fur covered her body, her eyes turned red. Her feet became large and long, and now had three toes. Her hands became paws with an opposable thumb. Her nose became small and white, and whiskers appeared on her face. She gained two large buck teeth. Her ears were now at the top of her &#39;bald&#39; head, and grew longer and longer. A cotton ball of a tail appeared out of her rear. She also lost several feet in feet in hight, becoming completely flat chested, and her figure was not shapeless at all. She was now standing on a personalized stood to stand on the counter. She gave out a whimper and was crying from being scared. The little rabbit girl mumbled for her mother. <br />
<br />
Without even thinking Anna flipped the settings and fired at the robber... there was a beeping noise, and a holograph warning came up, -Those Who have fathered children can not became female, nor can a female became younger than her children past child bearing age.- <br />
<br />
It dawned on Anna why the thief was likely here to begin with. <br />
<br />
Instantly the thief and the big man&#39;s attention was now on Anna. Hoping she was right, the now much smarter than she had been that morning Anna fired the ray gun again at the big man. The thief pulling the trigger at the last possible instant...  And... everything began to blur except for herself, Skyla, and Master. The bullet... was never fired. <br />
<br />
The big man, actually grew maybe an inch. His clothing all vanished, but was quickly completely covered in fur. His front covered in cream colored fur, and his sides and back with orange fur with black stripes. He actually got a little beefier. Then the breasts came, and they were -huge-, almost bewilderingly so!! The long stripped tail came next. And his blond hair grew a little longer. His feet became clawed paws. As did his hands except for a feline thumb. His face became that of a tiger&#39;s except for the mop of blond hair atop of her furry head. <br />
<br />
Things ceased blurring, and-<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy your meal, Head Maid Skyla, Master,&quot; The little rabbit girl, her name Eva, said smiling up at them.<br />
<br />
Master looked around confused at what had just happened. &quot;Uh, thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure master! Can I come over and help clean house later?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot;&quot;No!&quot; Skyla and Master looked at each other. <br />
<br />
Master then said. &quot;You should spend some time with... with your family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Master! I&#39;ll tell mom you said hello!&quot; Eva smiled, her ears flapping around she nodded her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t she a cute kid?&quot; The muscular and busty tiger woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a nice day Cassidy!&quot; The rabbit girl waved before getting back to work. <br />
<br />
&quot;You too kid.&quot; Cassidy smiled and waved, she was sitting next to Anna like she would an old friend.<br />
<br />
Skyla had kept her professional demeanor as Master&#39;s head maid should, but she was screaming inside at what had just happened, almost happened, next happened. Her tails were all shaking like leaves. She held Master, who looked rather disturbed as well. <br />
<br />
Cassidy meanwhile, merely kept an eye around, like a good little (big?) bodyguard. <br />
<br />
Anna meanwhile, was left in awe at how much a change to reality the ray gun had caused... it was better than thinking about the woman who had almost died, or that the naked tiger woman next to her who now remembered them being friends apparently had been a dangerous criminal in a life Cassidy no longer remembered.</p>
