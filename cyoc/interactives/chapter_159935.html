<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Robert hadn’t looked forward to the change which was approaching both him and his wife. Their families hadn’t taken the news well but was expected. Normally they would have had two weeks to prepare for the start of the change and another two weeks before the change would finish. However because Robert was changing genders as well as becoming a succubus his change would start one week earlier and take three weeks, the first week becoming 100% female before becoming a succubus. Which meant he had only one week as a human man left.<br />
<br />
They had decided to split the transformation, while Robert was changing into a woman they would remain at home and both would transform into succubus at the center. <br />
<br />
Robert had expected the week to be horrible fearing what was to come. What he hadn’t expected was that Sally had plans to keep his mind off the coming change. Those plans involved more sex then even their honeymoon and he didn’t fight it one bit. They didn’t use any protection and after one week both of them where tired from everything. That is when the changes started for Robert.<br />
<br />
The first change happened one morning, he had woken up and finding his boxers which had been all but ripped off him the night before he went to the bathroom. For a while everything seamed normal, then he rubbed his smooth chin. He stopped mid rub…he had a short well trim beard the night before. He looked up into the mirror to see that his beard was gone replaced with perfectly smooth flesh.  <br />
“Well that isn’t much of a surprise.” Stated Robert as he went back to the bedroom and sat back on the bed. He was about to get his pants on when his wife pulled him backwards and removed his boxers. Almost two hours later they finally started their day. <br />
<br />
That became their new normal for a while, both had been given time off work to help with the change and they where using it to fuck like rabbits. However every so often Robert would notice small changes happening to his body, his body hair disappearing, his arms becoming thinner same for his legs. He noticed himself getting physically smaller. He wasn’t a small guy around 6’1 or 6’2 if he felt like boosting a bit but he was getting shorter. He first noticed when he couldn’t reach a top shelve to get a cooking pot like he normally could.<br />
<br />
On Wednesday about halfway through his change he took a long moment to study himself in the mirror, his arms where thinner, same with his legs. He didn’t have as much as a muscle tone. His face was rounder and his Adam’s apple was gone, his neck longer as well. His short blonde hair had grown out and was now touching the top of his shoulders. He wanted to cut it but that wasn’t recommended according to the paperwork given by their doctor.  <br />
<br />
“I thought I would be shorter?” said Robert even his voice sounding different, well he hadn’t started growing breasts yet and his dick was still there. <br />
<br />
“Well you come from a tall family and the packet did say you would most likely become what you would have looked like as a woman.”<br />
On Friday night it finally happened, his manhood had gotten smaller every day since Wednesday and on Friday, maybe early Saturday it happened. He felt his release come as his wife moaned his name, then just after that wonderful high, he felt a painful sucking sensation. He thought he would pull out but there was nothing to pull, his manhood was all but gone. He could just make out it’s outline in the dark as it Sally turned on the light just in time for both of them to see the tip disappear within his body becoming a slit. <br />
<br />
He wasn’t proud of that night, he had broken down and cried like he had never cried before and his wife had been nothing but supportive as she let him cry on her shoulder. The next day the changes all but finished as his breasts bloomed and rapidly grew outward. And now he or rather she was looking at herself in a mirror.<br />
<br />
His face looked so different yet the same, he didn’t have a sister, but he looked like a female version of himself. His blue eyes where still there, his face was rounder and smoother. His blonde hair which had been kept in a buzz cut was now past his shoulder blades. Then there was his body, he was tall for a woman around 5’8 but it was still 3 or 4 inches shorter than he was used to. This shoulders where smaller, like the rest of his frame, his arms where hairless just like his legs both where longer and elegant. The thing that really messed with his mind was his chest, his bust was at least a large C maybe a small D and was larger than his wife’s and he never really understood how much large breasts hurt his back. He must admit if he was still a man, he would have said that he was a 8 maybe even a 9. <br />
<br />
“Here this should do.” Said Sally as she helped him into a purple bikini top and bottom. A purple top and grey shorts were also added. “They didn’t really have much of a selection at the store.”<br />
<br />
“Well come tomorrow we go to the transformation center and in two weeks we will be succubus.” Added Robert his voice sounding different, he wasn’t used to it at all.<br />
<br />
“No matter what happens, you will still be the person I love, and I will be the person you love.” Stated Sally as she kissed him, or rather her. “Now let’s go to bed.”</p>
