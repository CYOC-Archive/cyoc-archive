<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Barbara enters her apartment building, she notices how empty and sound it is. Considering how loud and rampant some of the building members can be, this is a whole new feeling for Barbara to notice. As Barbara looked at the stairs, she sighed with frustration. The apartment building has three floors, each labeled letter A to H with eight doors on each floor, following the letter format from the nearest door to the left of the stairs to the door across. Barbara&#39;s room is 3E, which is on the highest floor and at the end of the floor, making it a long walk for her to get there. She wanted to get closer to the stairs, but every time a new apartment opened up for rental, a new person or persons came in the following few days, trapping Barbara all the way back and on top of the building. As Barbara was about to accept her long walk up, she looked at her left palm and started to think. She was lighter and floatier than she once was, she could maybe make a long jump to save some flight of stairs. Making a smile, Barbara clutches her purse with her right hand and makes a small run and a jump as high as she now can. Out of the six steps of stairs that each stair set has in this building, Barbara covered four steps. And with a high leg stretch, she was able to get to the second floor, all with two steps.<br />
<br />
Getting a type of excitement out of this, Barbara made a walk back from the second flight of stairs, and with a clutched right hand, she made another good run and high jump, this time reaching up to the fifth stair. And with a normal step to the third floor, she got up to her floor, with barely as much energy as she used to use from her heavier body. As she looked at her room in the far right corner, she saw a gift basket with a note. Deciding that the fun she had wasn&#39;t over yet, she decided to skip over there, save an extra step or two from her time in the air. After a few skips, she makes it over to her apartment room and sees the gift basket more clearly. She sees a bunch of dry rations and a couple of soap bars, along with a card that reads from the front &#39;To Ms. Seids.&#39; Barbara pulls out her set of keys from her purse using her left hand, which still feels as normal as her right, and unlocks her apartment. Putting the keys back into her purse, Barbara grabs her gift basket, and closes the door behind her, locking it.<br />
<br />
Once getting inside, Barbara puts her purse and gift basket on her kitchen table. Barbara&#39;s apartment is a big room, which is split in half between the left carpet side and the right hardwood side. The living room has only a nice couch she bought last year, a coffee table, and a sixty-inch plasma TV which she uses to watch her streaming services, along with a couple of medium-sized windows she keeps covered while away. The kitchen has a regular-sized table with six wooden chairs, along with a sink, stove and oven, cabinets, dish-washing machine, and a microwave. Barbara looked down, about ready to put away her shoes, when she realized she had left her shoes, along with the pair of socks she was also wearing, back in the ambulance vehicle. She shrugged it off, however, considering they were basic black shoes and socks she only wore for work. From ahead the apartment door, in between the living room and kitchen, was a short hallway with three doors. From the center-left side was her bedroom, and from the right to the left of the bedroom door was the bathroom, and to the right was her closet, which is just filled with cleaning supplies and party supplies she gets from her job and even a couple of her friends. Barbara walked through the hallway and went into her bedroom.<br />
<br />
Inside her bedroom, above another small covered window she never opens, Barbara had a nice, soft queen-sized bed she had for about five years, with a normal box spring and a basic golden bed frame, all covered with her three layers of soft blankets and an extra layer of comforter, as a sleep lover. Along with a couple of nightstands that host her basic alarm clock and phone charger on top, the bedroom has a five-drawer dresser, which hosts Barbara&#39;s basic shirts, pants, and underwear along with a couple of miscellaneous things hidden within. Having her laundry basket beside the dresser, Barbara starts to undress from her usual retail store manager clothes. Black jeans and a gray polo with The Party Shack logo on the pocket sleeve. Now in her pure black underwear, Barbara pulls into her dresser and pulls out some soft, comfy, dark-red boyshorts. As she starts stripping off her underwear, Barbara realizes how much fat she has lost from her breasts, they look too small for her 42-C-cupped bra. Looking at the mirror attached to the closet door, Barbara sees how much fat she has lost overall. Her belly isn&#39;t as big and chubby as it once was, and her arms have slimmed down a little. Barbara smiles and starts to admire her body, it appears her body is also physically turning more fit, more sexy like her prime years as she continues posing her body in front of the mirror. After admiring herself for a moment, Barbara fully strips down and throws her underwear in the laundry basket, as she puts on the boyshorts and goes straight into her closet, topless.<br />
<br />
Opening the closet door with the mirror on it shows Barbara&#39;s more stylish clothes, along with dresses and clothing sets she likes to wear. Barbara goes in and pulls out a woven, light red silk robe. As she closes the door, Barbara puts on the robe, ensuring her breasts&#39; coverage as she tightens the belt around her now slimmer belly. Looking back at the mirror, Barbara looks like she is in her early thirties, which made her feel really good about her new form, and continues posing with her robe on. After another moment of playful posing with her mirror, Barbara walks out of her bedroom and hallway, grabs her phone from her purse on the table, pulls out the card on the gift basket, and starts to read the content inside, which is written as follows. &#39;As you are a renter of our apartment complex, we are required by law to give you what you need to survive our now shutten-down circumstances. In this basket is some food, easy to cook and make up with your apartment floor plan, along with some basic hygienic products. If you still require our service or a refill with food and hygiene, please contact us. And enjoy the emergency shutdown.&#39;<br />
<br />
Putting down the card, Barbara walks over to her cabinets, grabs a big bag of potato chips, and walks over to lie down on the couch while grabbing the television remote to turn on the television, putting down the chips and her phone on the coffee table. She sees some news popping up on her feed, so she plays it to see live television coverage of the Great Fusion Wave. &quot;The Great Fusion Wave has now started hitting the eastern hemisphere, bypassing Algeria, Ireland, The United Kingdom, and Spain while currently passing through France, Germany, Italy, and Nigeria. Currently, as of the recorded medical reports through multiple medical organizations, about eighty-nine percent of the humans who got passed by the Great Fusion Wave have been affected by its impact, with an astounding twenty-one percent of them being completely incapable of being independent. And to the records of multiple animal and nature reserves, about seventy-six percent of all animals and even objects have also been fused, making even Mother Nature very abnormal. As a pact agreed upon by all current governments, the whole world will be preparing for a public shutdown, with nobody outside of certain job fields allowed to be outside until everything can be handled for a society with new forms. We will be here to update you all in the know about the Great Fusion Wave as it continues to impact the world.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shoot,&quot; Barbara remembers her call with Jim earlier with the last couple sentences the new reporter said, &quot;I need to call him.&quot; Muting the television, Barbara picks up her phone and dials up Jim again to tell him her current situation. After only one round of ringing, Barbara hears a more energetic &quot;Hello.&quot; &quot;Hey Jim, it&#39;s me, Barbara. I am back home now, the store is all shut down just as before.&quot; &quot;Okay, and did you get your check-up?&quot; Jim asks. &quot;Yes, they said I am a perfect fusion and should be fine.&quot; &quot;Oh great,&quot; Jim responds with some relief, &quot;so you should be fine then with your balloon fusion. Alright Barb, I&#39;ll go talk to the owner about some confiscation for your fusion, but I think since you&#39;ve been a good manager for three years with us, I think I can get you a ten to fourteen-day extended vacation, paid, or a fifteen hundred bonus on the spot.&quot; After thanking him, Barbara hangs up their call, and Barbara screams a little with excitement. She gets a good fusion, looks less fat than before, and is now getting something good out of her job, nothing could have been going better for the middle-aged perfectly fused woman. Within her good mood, Barbara looks down at her left palm, and then over at her closet, thinking about that advice from Sarah, about feeling free to try out her new form.</p>
