<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hmmm?&quot; Matt stared at the nondescript brown package left on his doorstep. It was one of his early days off of college teaching at the local college so he was the first one home. He knew he wasn&#39;t expecting a package and David or Nate tended to warn him to be on the look out for one if they had been expecting one. However, the package had neither of their names on it either.<br />
<br />
Matt shrugged and took the package inside. He set his backpack filled with his week&#39;s assignments next to the door and found some scissors to open the package. Once opened, Matt was just as confused as he had been before. The package said Chronivac, but he&#39;d never heard of anything like that before. It almost looked like some kind of tablet. Curiosity was getting the better of him and he opened it up. Just as the picture on the box had told him, it still looked like a tablet.<br />
<br />
With the touch of a button, the tablet turned on. &#39;Welcome!&#39; a screen popped up. &#39;Thank you for using the Chronivac. We are happy to let you know that this is fully optimized to help you with your reality warping needs. Simply type in the box what you would like to change and viola! The changes occur instantaneously. Of course we would never forget about our customers who would prefer their changes to happen over a period of time. Simply add how long you would like the change to occur or use one of helpful menu options.&#39;<br />
<br />
The tablet grayed out to show a drop down menu in the top right corner. It then went to the next box over to highlight another feature. &#39;Don&#39;t forget to toggle different awareness setting. Choose from a variety of options such as fully aware, partially aware, or completely oblivious. Of course anything you dream of can become a reality with the Chronivac!&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck...?&quot; Matt uttered as he stared at the screen. He wasn&#39;t one to say something like that, however the complete confusion he felt over the tablet he was currently holding in his hands seemed to make no sense whatsoever. The welcome tutorial had ended and now he was simply looking at a blank word document that had grayed out letters asking him, &#39;Type what you would like to change.&#39;<br />
<br />
Matt needed a second. He took the tablet to the kitchen and got himself a glass of water. Drinking it helped him calm down at least a little bit. &quot;What am I supposed to do with you?&quot; he questioned again. Matt&#39;s attention turned back out the window. &quot;Hmmm...&quot; a bit of a malicious grin turned to the 19 year old neighbor next door. They&#39;d lived next to Travis Torres for the better part of a decade and as a kid, he had quite the difficult relationship with Nate.<br />
<br />
Travis was always pissed off that Nate had two dads. He&#39;d always brag about that&#39;s why Nate was so weak. It didn&#39;t help that he was naturally larger either, often making fun of Nate for taking more after David&#39;s smaller leaner frame since they did share biology. The only positive to come out of the whole situation was that it did make Nate at least want to try sports and prove him wrong. <br />
<br />
Of course that didn&#39;t make it okay. Matt was consistently pissed off that Travis wouldn&#39;t leave Nate alone. Travis&#39; natural size always made it easy for him to gain muscle. Even as he was working out in the backyard, his defined sweaty muscle glistened in the sunlight.<br />
<br />
Matt grit his teeth. A bit of a smile quickly appeared on his face as he thought about it a bit more. He looked back down at the tablet, an idea brewing. &#39;If it didn&#39;t work, no one would know. Right?&#39; he smiled to himself as he started typing. &#39;Travis will transform into a 5&#39;4&quot; 90 pound weakling over the next five minutes. As he shrinks, he will only be vaguely aware that he&#39;s not the right size, but not fully understand what was wrong. He&#39;ll find anyone bigger than him insanely attractive. The bigger the difference, the more attracted he&#39;ll be.&#39;<br />
<br />
A green button appeared on the bottom of the screen labeled, &#39;Change.&#39; Matt clicked it. A green loading bar quickly filled up. Matt&#39;s attention quickly turned to outside. Travis was still warming up for his workout. He paused for a second during one of his stretches, then shrugged as he went back to his warmup. As a minute passed, he started to wonder more. At 6&#39;2&quot; and a strong 220 pounds he always wore clothes that fit tightly against his muscular frame.<br />
<br />
Huge pecs pushed hard against his sleeveless shirt and the width of his shoulders gave him a powerful frame. As he moved, the straps of his sleeveless shirt didn&#39;t feel quite as tight against his shoulders. The same was true of his shorts that always gripped his muscular ass so tightly. Travis took a second to look around. &#39;Was everything bigger?&#39;<br />
<br />
Travis tried to ignore the strange feeling. Looking at his body, everything still felt right. Even though after a minute he&#39;d already shrank about 3 inches and lost nearly 40 pounds. His sleeveless shirt was really having a hard time holding onto his thinning shoulders and his shorts fell down around his ankles. &quot;What the Hell?&quot; he questioned out loud as he pulled them back over his waist. Something had to be wrong, he just knew it. At the same time, he couldn&#39;t figure it out. <br />
<br />
He tightened the strings on his shorts and continued onto his warmup. As he did high knees, he couldn&#39;t help but notice that his shorts went well past his knees now. Another couple of inches had disappeared from his height and they were starting to get overly baggy. He stopped and adjusted his sleeveless shirt again. &#39;Am I getting smaller?&#39; The thought crossed his mind but that had to be impossible. At least at the rate he was going.<br />
<br />
Travis flexed his arm and looked at it. No longer was there the solid softball sized bicep that had always been there. Rather his arm barely even made a bump. Even with the stark change all Travis could muster was a soft, &#39;is that right?&#39; Looking around he tried to measure himself around anything he could. How could everything feel so big but not at the exact same time?<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong big guy?&quot; Matt walked into the backyard and asked Travis. <br />
<br />
As Travis turned, he tried to flash a glare at his gay neighbor, but failed. His eyes went wide as his penis hardened in his shorts. The 19 year old couldn&#39;t control himself as he saw the massive man leaning slightly over the chain link fence that connected their yards. &quot;N-n-no Mr. Davenport, everything&#39;s fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Matt pressured.<br />
<br />
Travis&#39; brain was going crazy. Looking at the 5&#39;11&quot; 230 meaty pounds on his neighbor was sending all kinds of signals that he didn&#39;t understand. He couldn&#39;t stop tracing those thick, burly contours of his neighbor. Since when did he find his neighbor hot?! &quot;Fuck...&quot; he cursed as his cock throbbed in his shorts.<br />
<br />
Matt chuckled. His bearded smile only made Travis go even more insane. &quot;C&#39;mon bud. You can tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Err...&quot; Travis felt himself get a bit shy as words got caught in his mouth. His mind was suddenly filled with all sorts of thoughts he&#39;d made fun of other guys for.  The confident bully was now tripping over himself as he spoke. &quot;I... Uhh... Feel like I&#39;ve gotten smaller...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Smaller?&quot; Matt asked. &quot;How&#39;s that possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Travis answered looking over his body. So many confusing thoughts were running through him. At the same time he couldn&#39;t get any of the ones about Matt out of his mind. His cock throbbed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... Well, let me take a look. Come over here a second,&quot; Matt said. <br />
<br />
Travis followed the order, walking over to the chain link fence that divided the two yards. He felt like he should have been taller than Matt, but his head tilted upwards to look at the far bigger man. He cocked his head to the side, before realizing that Matt had reached over the fence and grabbed him underneath his arms. With a bit of a heft, Matt lifted him over to his side of the fence. Travis&#39; shoes dropped to the ground as he was lifted over. The XL sleeveless shirt was struggling to hold onto his body. If not for the weight shifting to one side, it would have slid off his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Matt looked him over like an animal. &quot;You&#39;re feeling smaller? Have you still been working out nearly everyday?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh...&quot; Travis grunted out the affirmative. He couldn&#39;t make much more of a intelligible thought than that. All he could think about was resting his head against Matt&#39;s pecs, feeling those strong arms wrap tightly around him or sniffing deep into his armpits. If he wasn&#39;t so turned on, he&#39;d have been horrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s see,&quot; Matt said. &quot;Give me a flex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without a second thought, Travis lifted up his thin arms and gave Matt a flex. He&#39;d been practicing a while and knew to suck in his stomach. As he did so, his shorts and boxers dropped around his ankles and the only thing hiding his dick was the oversized sleeveless shirt he was wearing. Hiding, is a bit of a misnomer as it had pitched a tent in his shirt and a wet stain was actively forming.<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s rough hands gently slid against Travis&#39; soft skin. He gave the tiny bicep a squeeze. &quot;I don&#39;t know buddy. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re all that small...&quot; Even around the thickest part of Travis&#39; arm, Matt&#39;s hand easily wraps all the way around it. A slight taunt in his voice makes Travis feel all the smaller.<br />
<br />
A whimpering moan escaped Travis. He couldn&#39;t help it at all. his cock kept leaking, staining his shirt. The difference between him and Matt was too much. His mind was racing with all kinds of thoughts of the other man pinning him to the ground, wall or fence. The difference in size and strength was immense and Travis couldn&#39;t do anything about it. But the gentle way Matt kept touching him only turned him on more. Travis&#39; knees went weak as his cock throbbed and ejected into his shirt.<br />
<br />
Huge streams of cum coated the sleeveless shirt, making an undeniable stain. Travis was too distracted as his small body leaned into Matt&#39;s larger one for support. His hands gently squeezed the other man&#39;s body as he came down from his high. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; he squeaked, face turning bright red.<br />
<br />
Matt rustled Travis&#39; hair. &quot;Don&#39;t worry big guy. Not the first time you&#39;ve done it...&quot; he smirked as he started typing into the Chronivac. &#39;Travis Torres will return to his normal size and be vaguely aware that something had happened. Instead of finding anyone bigger than him attractive, he&#39;ll find me incredibly attractive.&#39; A devious smirk grew on Matt&#39;s face as he clicked enter and watched the changes occur in front of him.<br />
<br />
Travis&#39; body grew back to it&#39;s 6&#39;2&quot; 220 pound muscular body. His sleeveless shirt fit more tightly against his chest and shoulders, but the huge wad of cum rose up and gripped against his abs. &quot;I guess,&quot; Travis shrugged. A confidence had taken back in his voice however, his eyes still wouldn&#39;t stop tracing Matt&#39;s body. His cock rose back up. &quot;I should probably get going...&quot; he blushed as he grabbed his shorts and hopped the fence back to his yard.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you around...&quot; Matt called after him. A devious smile planted on his face as he looked at the Chronivac again.</p>
