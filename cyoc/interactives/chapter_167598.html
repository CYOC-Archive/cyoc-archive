<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus tried for the door with the orc on it. It was the weirdest looking one, so he figured why not?<br />
As he entered the room he noticed that it was dimly lit like the other parts of the house, but it was set with a very full meal of meat on the table. Marcus wasn&#39;t all that hungry so he continued to explore. As he did the door swung closed behind him. He began banging on the door &quot;Hey Oliver! I&#39;m behind this weird looking orc door buddy! Hey let me out!&quot;  After a few seconds of banging, Marcus decided to see if he could find another way out.<br />
As he began to wander around the room, a strange, musky odor began to invade his nostrils. It smelt very masculine so even though it was definitely BO, he couldn&#39;t help but start tenting. &quot;Alright, alright, calm down there buddy.&quot; As he looked around he saw a big bed, big enough for two easily, though 3 might be more like it.<br />
As he continued looking, Marcus had started to feel a tightness emanating from his abs. It radiated out to the rest of his body as he began to feel sore. He put his hand up against the wall while he breathed heavily and, strange for him, grunted. Looking at his hand, he saw that it had slightly changed sheen and his fingers were aching. He saw as tiny claws extended from his fingers. &quot;Oh fuck!&quot; he yelled in a slightly gravelly voice. <br />
The pain in his body was increasing and he began to search desperately for a way out. His jaw ached...<br />
He found something with a sheet over it, but instead of a door, it was a mirror. Marcus stared in in horror as he saw this green envelope his whole body. He screamed in pain watching his muscles double in size, stretching his shirt until he took it off. His feet began to extend and his thighs and butt grew bigger. He began itching like crazy as hair/fur began to spread all over his body.<br />
But the scariest was what happened to his head. He felt his teeth all become sharp, which made him yell with a deepening voice. His bottom two teeth began to painfully extend from his bottom lip, as his lips gained girth. This was excruciating and frightening all at once. <br />
His ears were pulsating as they grew to points. His nose cracked open to be wider. His eyebrows gained thicker mass as his brow bulged forward with the greatest pain of all. His hair remained short up top but gained a wiry texture. <br />
While this happened, new instincts began to invade his brain. He remained Marcus, but his priorities began to shift a bit. He felt the urge of his now huge throbbing cock to find a mate. &quot;Why the hell am I thinking like this?&quot; He said with his new voice. Looking at the finished change in the mirror, he let out a tribal grunt. He was scared of what that did to him, but he needed to let his urges out. <br />
Just then, Oliver banged through the door. There, standing like a perfect specimen of manhood, stood Marcus, but he was green, hairy, and his face was animalistic. <br />
&quot;Oliver&quot;, he said, &quot;I need you man. I always have.&quot; He came forward towards Oliver who tried to run away but the door had closed. Marcus couldn&#39;t control the urges and began kissing Oliver who pushed him away. <br />
&quot;Get away from me, Marcus! What the hell are you...man....&quot; Oliver began to feel an uncomfortable shifting in his body. Marcus knew what it meant, and though he didn&#39;t want Oliver to feel pain, he was excited to at least have someone share this weird situation with.<br />
Oliver growled and fell the ground. He heaved his back up as it ripped through his shirt. It was already green. He was scratching at his body as his fur poked out. &quot;Marcus, man, help me! I&#39;m in so much pain! What&#39;s happening to me!&quot; He began grunting. &quot;Ugh, I&#39;m feeling so hot.&quot; He held his head as his teeth changed, his nose plumped up, his brow and eyebrows thickened, and his ears became points. <br />
After a few seconds, Oliver stood up, another hot orc specimen. He rushed over to the mirror to examine himself.<br />
&quot;Man, this is fucked up.&quot;, he said.<br />
&quot;I know, Oliver. How are you feeling?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m feeling horny man. Fuck I feel like I&#39;m this beast thing and still me. And I really want to rub my cock on yours. Like...like to start mating with you. Fuck this is weird.&quot;<br />
Marcus became excited. &quot;Yeah buddy, I get it. Look, if we&#39;re gonna be changed into creatures like this, let&#39;s at least enjoy it, okay?&quot; Marcus went up to Oliver and hugged him. The two smelled each other&#39;s musks and became erect. They pulled back, looking at each other&#39;s new animalistic faces, and began kissing with intensity and passion.<br />
They fell onto the bed, their new instincts overwhelming them as they began to have sex. Marcus let Oliver inside of him and growled, biting each other. Both came and Oliver fed off of Marcus&#39; jizz.  As they lay there, they both began talking about grunting as a form of communication. Their instincts told them that they would need to hunt and then figure out how to reverse this.</p>
