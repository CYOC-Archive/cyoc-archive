<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Jeff said as he closed his door. &quot;My dad and his friends can&#39;t really stop when they get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; Greg was still smiling ear to ear when he said it. &quot;If this device can do half of what you said it could, then seeing a little bit of old man ass and dick ain&#39;t that bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck nodded in agreement. &quot;Yeah man. If you could make us like you guys, then it&#39;ll totally be worth it. Just think about how many girls will be flirting with us.&quot; He elbowed Greg in the arm. The two had been on the football team and gotten to be on pretty good terms with Todd and Jeff. Chuck being a pretty big linebacker made him nearly as tall as Todd, but he clearly envied Jeff&#39;s natural size and strength. Even if he was fairly large, a lot of that had been bulk and not the same shredded muscle that the tiger had. <br />
<br />
Greg on the other hand was the kicker. He played soccer in the summer and made sure to stay fairly slim for both. Cardio was far more important than size, but if he could have both, he&#39;d be golden. Jeff had promised him that he&#39;d bigger, stronger and just as fast as he was if he just came over. Even if all this was a prank, he wasn&#39;t about to give up a golden opportunity like this without at least trying it. Someone like Jeff didn&#39;t really joke around like this.<br />
<br />
They watched as Jeff sat down in his computer chair and muttered, &quot;Strange...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is?&quot; Greg leaned in closer. He saw a countdown timer still going.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never seen this before. Don&#39;t know what it&#39;s for. But whatever. It says it&#39;s complete. Even if changes won&#39;t be fulfilled for another 23 hours,&quot; Jeff minimized the screen and was greeted with the usual prompt. [What would you like to change?] Then started typing. He wanted Greg to be a semi muscular anthro lion. One with a descent amount of bulk so he&#39;d be perfect for the starting lines. He wanted to add one more thing, Greg and Chuck are in a secret relationship together and have always found each other to be incredibly sexy. But then another window caught his eye. &#39;Awareness?&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff knew he could play with subjects awareness but this seemed to have a more specified options than just target, world and user.<br />
<br />
       <b> Aware </b><br />
        Jeff, Greg, Finn, Mike<br />
<br />
      <b> Partially Aware </b><br />
<br />
      <b> Unaware </b><br />
       Everyone unspecified will be unaware of the transformation.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a bit curious about the new option and typed in Greg, Finn and Chuck&#39;s name into the bar. He was surprised to see a slider appear next to each of their names. Hovering over the &#39;?&#39; it asked how aware they should be. &#39;1&#39; being almost completely oblivious to the changes while &#39;99&#39; would be almost fully aware. He decided it&#39;d be more fun to make it slightly different for each one. Chuck would be the least aware with about &#39;20%&#39; awareness, Greg would be a bit more with &#39;60%&#39; awareness and then Finn would be the most, but not completely with &#39;80%&#39; awareness. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ready?&quot; Jeff asked. He brought Greg back over once he was done with the sliders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man! Let&#39;s see what this can do!&quot; Greg sounded excited. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Jeff said. He hit the enter button and leaned back. <br />
<br />
The smile plastered over Greg&#39;s face shifted between excitement, worry and curiosity. He let out a couple of chuckles as the changes were starting to take place. &quot;I feel funny,&quot; he said. Golden hair was already starting to sprout over his lean muscular arms. But those were also starting to bulk up. The thin muscles were rapidly adding more and more weight to them as they shifted from speed and dexterity to strength.<br />
<br />
&quot;Funny? How?&quot; Chuck leaned in. He seemed to have taken notice a bit. At 6&#39;4&quot; he stood a good deal taller than the other man, but clearly noticed an inch between them was gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Greg couldn&#39;t help but giggle. &quot;It&#39;s like I&#39;m all warm and fuzzy. And my muscles feel like they&#39;re going through a workout. But then it&#39;s like my bones are changing stretching too.&quot; He reached to the 10 foot ceiling in Jeff&#39;s bedroom and was getting a little bit closer to touching it. When he brought his arms back down, his arms and shoulders had grown quite a bit. Two massive boulders pressed out on both sides of him while his lithe biceps and triceps bulged with new found power. Golden fur was starting to sprout where no hair had been before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus...&quot; Chuck exclaimed. &quot;You&#39;re getting so big...&quot; They were eye level now, and even that was starting to change as Greg grew another inch. Then jumped up several as his weight on his feet went to his toes. The base of his feet started to widen and small callouses that turned into paw pads formed on the bottom of his feet. His toes shifted and bent to look more like paws while sharp black nails hid inside his toes.<br />
<br />
Greg felt himself stumble, but quickly caught himself. &quot;Woah,&quot; he chuckled looking down at Chuck, &quot;You&#39;re so small.&quot; The four inches between them had shifted and now Greg was the one constantly looking down at his friend. He could see Chuck&#39;s face shift between excitement and sour as he realized what was going on. &quot;C&#39;mon man. Don&#39;t be weird about it. You still look hot. I&#39;m just hotter,&quot; Greg&#39;s thick arm raised and he gave the thick bicep a flex. It had to be at least 22 inches around as the muscle bounced up and down. Chuck&#39;s eyes glazed over as he watched. Greg leaned in. &quot;Wanna feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I-I--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon man. Suddenly I&#39;m a bit bigger than you and you get all cold feet?&quot; Greg&#39;s face was starting to shift more into a lion&#39;s. His jaw widened and mouth grew larger to fit in much pointier and bigger teeth. The cartilage of his nose bent backward and his nostrils changed into slits. His skull shifted and cracked as his nose and mouth pushed out from his face. A thick maw grew where his face had been. The golden hair on top of his head had turned dark brown and rounded the rest of his face in a massive shaggy mane. Greg moved into Chuck&#39;s space and whispered in his ear. &quot;Or are you too afraid of being sus?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck felt his body squirm. Hearing his secret boyfriend taunt him so publicly turned him on so much. He could feel his cock throbbing in his shorts as he wanted to pet that golden fur running all over Greg&#39;s body. Chuck cautiously did as he was told. His big hands ran over the much bigger muscle, giving it a squeeze. &quot;Holy shit. You&#39;re so much stronger...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know right?&quot; Greg bragged. Feeling Chuck&#39;s hands go past his bicep and onto his beefy chest sent a new signal to his brain. Somehow, he hadn&#39;t realized just how turned on he was. He looked down at the other man who he&#39;d always looked up to. A desire to kiss his boyfriend suddenly came to him. He wondered when that happened. But Greg&#39;s desire was overpowering his natural thoughts. He couldn&#39;t stop thinking how hot Chuck was. Just feeling those hands roam around him, made the desire all the more powerful.<br />
<br />
Greg leaned down and stared. His eyes golden as he felt his tongue wanting to leave his mouth. Chuck&#39;s eyes went wide. He knew what was going on. Greg gave in. He pushed his tongue into Chuck&#39;s mouth and held him tightly. To his surprise, Chuck reciprocated. Their tongues danced around each other&#39;s mouths. Even though they&#39;d never kissed with his lion mouth, it was somehow like they&#39;d done it a thousand times. Greg gently wrapped his arms around Chuck as he lifted the big man up fairly easily and tossed him onto the bed. They rolled around, kissing and feeling each other up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...&quot; Finn smiled as he watched it happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what should I turn Chuck into?&quot; Jeff asked</p>
