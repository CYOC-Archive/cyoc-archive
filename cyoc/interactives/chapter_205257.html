<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You might be a woman on the outside, but on the inside, you were still a man. Maybe they had given you the large mirror above the bed as a gift, not a way to mock you? As you pondered that question, you decided to get undressed. Soon enough, the older woman you now were was looking back at you in the mirror. Two large tits, white as snow, surrounded by a tan. Your crotch was shaved, or waxed, and just as white. You had a innie. What a weird thing to think about. The contrast of the white, pearly skin and tanned, olive skin, was making you surprisingly excited. You could feel it all through your body, but the most tell tale sign was absent. <br />
<br />
Being horny as a woman was something completely new. You brought a hand down towards your crotch. You could feel how hot it was. You decided to gently massage around the opening, trying to get yourself ready. Soon enough you figured you had to be ready to go. Two fingers found their way towards the area you usually found your girlfriends clit. Were you about to do this? Masturbate as a woman? You decided to put the two fingers slightly inside your new moist vagina. What a weird feeling, kind of like a tickle. Clearly not enough to stimulate you but enough to make you react. Your wet fingers reached up again, towards your new clitoris. A shock went through your body as you touched your new erotic pleasure point. You looked up into the mirror. The sight of the woman touching herself made you even hornier. You started to gently rub your clit. It felt amazing. Like stroking your dick, but collected into one singular point. You could get used to this. You started to feel a weird craving. Something inside you were screaming to be filled up. You soon after plunged two of your fingers into your new hole. The sensation was incredible and completely foreign. Was this how it was to be a woman? You had to admit, you liked it. But you craved more. Something bigger. You looked back up into the mirror. The woman was clearly in need of something more solid. Her eyes were screaming for more. To be properly penetrated. YOU were dying for something to penetrate you! You looked around and found nothing. Of course. You really didn&#39;t want to interrupt what you were doing, but this was an emergency. You went into the kitchen, hoping to find something of use. No avail. You went back into the bedroom and as you opened a drawer, it stared back at you. A large, transparent dildo. With a suction cup. The perverts at the lab, bless them!<br />
<br />
You got back on the bed and started to fuck yourself with the large dildo. The fact you were more or less pretending a large fat cock was fucking you didn&#39;t bother you the slightest. You actually liked it. You decided to make us of the suction cup. All but 10 minutes in of sexual experience as a woman, and here you were, putting a dildo on the floor to ride it. As you rode it, you couldn&#39;t help yourself. You started to imagine the dildo was an actual cock. One belonging to a young man perhaps, with a thing for older women. A fit young man. Your new body was clearly taking you for a ride and you were going to let it. &quot;Fuck my tight pussy&quot; you moaned. Hearing yourself turned you on, as all you heard was a woman talking dirty. &quot;Fuck my tight pussy with your big dick&quot; you whispered. It just felt better and better and the more you rode it and the more you talked dirty, the less you listened to your new voice and the more you thought about the bodies of men. You rode the dildo harder and harder, screaming louder and louder. Something was building up. Something massive. You came! You orgasmed, as a woman! It was intense and as you orgasmed, you started to squirt. The floor wet with your juices. But you didn&#39;t care. At that moment you were completely wrapped in ecstasy. The fact your mind was thinking about men wasn&#39;t even bothering you at that point.<br />
<br />
As you came down from your high, reality started to sink in. You were a woman... And considering you started thinking about men with absolutely no second though, you were clearly a very straight woman. You did not know what to make of that. It had felt right just moments ago, but now it felt wrong. You weren&#39;t a straight woman! You were a man, a straight man. You liked women? You went straight for the cellphone. You brought up some pictures of certain women you knew had always worked to get you going as a man. But nothing. Well, nothing wasn&#39;t the right word. You could tell the women were attractive. Sexy. You definitely felt some sexual desire for these women. You wanted to enjoy their bodies. But that feeling was mostly being overruled instead with jealousy? Jealousy that you weren&#39;t a young, sexy, skinny, single woman with young men ready to fuck you at a moments notice. You didn&#39;t want to be WITH them. You wanted to BE them? The realization hit you hard. It seemingly didn&#39;t matter you had your brain in this body. This body and it&#39;s hormones were deciding what you were sexually attracted to. You were not ready for this. While feeling quite a bit of shame, you got dressed and cleaned up the mess you had made. <br />
<br />
You made yourself ready for bed, unable to help playing with the large tits on your chest for a little while. Tomorrow you were going to watch porn. Lesbian porn. You were not going to be defeated so easily by this body. Maybe you&#39;d install tinder? Hope for a match with some other woman and flirt. That would get you on the right track!</p>
