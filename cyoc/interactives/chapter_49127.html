<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>With the door opened as wide as it would go, you stand there, wide eyed and staring 
in disbelief. Not thinking what you were seeing was real, you not only pinch yourself, but 
you rub your eyes and slap your face a couple times to wake yourself out of the dream you 
thought you had to be in.</Br>
<Br>From the look of the room, it had be nearly two thousand square feet, with very 
extravagant furnishings. Looking toward the ceiling, there was a massive skylight which 
made up half of the ceiling. Each of the four panes of glass being two hundred and fifty 
square with only a single crossing of metal an inch wide, that gave you an extremely large 
and barely obstructed view of the sky in all of it's phases. Although, you were not very 
sure why things were like that, you figured it was to make up for the non-ocean views of 
that deck. Granted, you knew you were getting better views of all the men on that ship, 
which all appeared to be in decent shape. So, all-in-all, it was all a wash. Curious to know 
if your room was a special room, you step out into the hallway after putting your couple 
carry-ons right at the door, and wait to see another person. A few moments later, a very 
attractive man of average height, who could have been considered a muscle bear, opened 
his room that was right next to yours. Wanting to meet him and get a look at his room, 
you simply walk up to him.</Br>
<Br>"Wow... simply wow!"</Br>
<Br>You take a peek into his room and see the same thing. "Yeah, I know what you mean! 
My name is Brandon."</Br>
<Br>"Nice to meet you Brandon, I'm Ben. Is your room like mine?"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, go ahead and take a look for yourself!"</Br>
<Br>Ben walked in front of your door, looked in and was both shocked and 
perplexed.</Br>
<Br>"If your room and mine are right next to each other, how can your walls and mine, 
appear to go into both of the floor plans of our rooms, but yet they don't? Another thing 
that is strange is that if all of our rooms are the same size, how can at least all of the 
rooms fit on this deck? Honestly, there just isn't enough total floor space on this deck due 
to the length and width of this boat! I mean, think about it, if every room is this big, we'd 
be on a much larger ship than this and there would not be room on this deck for anything 
else."</Br>
<Br>"Wow, you put a lot of thought into that, but I guess you are right. I guess... it must 
be magic. Don't you remember on the brochure that one of their sayings is <Em>A time 
so wonderful, so long, but actually so short... you'd think it was as if by 
magic!</Em>"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I do remember that. I was never a believer in magic or the supernatural, that 
was until now. By the way, I thought of that stuff quickly because I'm in 
construction."</Br>
<Br>You immediately wanted to jump for joy, but you restrained yourself. Not only was he 
the type of man you found most attractive, above guys like Tim, Ben is a construction 
worker to boot. You tried to hide your smile, since one of your biggest fantasies involved 
yourself and a hot construction worker, or two, like Ben. Even though you did your best to 
hide that smile, you knew you failed because you knew that he noticed it by the way his 
look changed. As you two parted ways Ben called out to you.</Br>
<Br>"Hey Brandon, I guess we will see each other around, if not very frequently." Which he 
ended with an inviting wink while he walked completely into his room with the door 
closing behind him.</Br>
<Br><Em>Man... am I in luck or what?</Em> You thought to yourself as you walked into 
your room and allowed the door to close behind you as well. You knew that Tim and 
especially Ben, were probably just the tip of the iceberg when it came to the men on your 
deck, not to mention the time you could have.</Br>
<Br>Getting settled in your room further, you notice several more things. The first of 
many was the large seating area on the left side of the room, that had book shelves and 
quite literally thousands of books filling them. The left wall had a fireplace with a large and 
ornate mantle that was in the middle of the larger bookshelf, dividing it into two equal 
sized shelving units. Above the fireplace was a forty-two inch, flat panel, LCD HDTV 
mounted to the wall and was more than likely to use to relax if you didn't want to explore 
the deck or the possibilities there-on, for some reason. The seating area was comprised 
of a U shaped sectional that could seat at least fifteen, that was upholstered in a very rich 
dark brown leather with huge gold and decorated buttons inset that created a nice lounge 
atmosphere.  Looking at the decoration carved on the mantle, you notice that each corner 
looked like a wolf's head, but not exactly like one.</Br>
<Br>Shrugging your shoulders, you walk over to the double queen sized, four post bed 
that had the canopy left off, and sit down to feel what you would be sleeping on at some 
point. Next to the bed were two night stands that had a single lamp atop of each as well as 
the house phone on the stand to the left of the bed, which was nearest to you for the 
moment. Sitting down on the bed, you felt your entire body relax and melt. The cushioning 
was so soft, you wondered if that was what sleeping on top of a white and fluffy cloud 
would feel like. You knew at this point you may never want to leave not only that bed, but 
the room and the ship for that matter. Although, you knew you had to if you truly wanted 
to enjoy the entirety of the cruise and what men the ship had to offer.</Br>
<Br>After mustering up the strength and ambition to get off of the bed, you walk toward 
the other door that was opposite from the one that originally allowed you into the room. 
Once you were at the door, you noticed the entrance to what had to have been the 
bathroom. Curious to see what was in there, you took a peek, and you were not surprised 
to see that the lavishness of the room continued into and all around the bathroom. Not 
wanting to waste anymore time in your room, you went to the door and tried to open it, 
but the handle would not budge. You tried again after a few minutes and still nothing. 
Frustrated, you walked over to the bed, and saw the average sized remote control. 
Wondering if that was what unlocked the door, you studied a few of the buttons. One was 
for television and the controls associated with its functionality. Another was for the lights, 
to control how bright or dim any of the actual lights in the ceiling were. There was another 
for music, which shared the function buttons with the television mode, which you were 
sure were for the well hidden, in wall speakers. Among many other buttons, ones that did 
several other things that you didn't particularly have interest in, there was a button labeled 
lock.</Br>
<Br>Figuring that you found what was hindering your leaving the room, you pushed the 
button. Having pushed the button, you noticed a small panel that slowly came out of the 
wall next to the door. Wondering what it was, you get up to inspect it. With the remote still 
in hand, you made your way to the door and realize it was for scanning your fingerprint. 
You then further realize this must be another way to enter, and possibly exit, your room 
especially since on the other side, everyone would be naked and carrying a key card would 
just not be very convenient. Wanting to start the whole process, you place your finger on 
the pad, one at a time trying to activate the thing, but to your surprise, nothing started it. 
Since the remote got you that far, you look at it again and notice the <Em>Initialize 
Fingerprint Scan</Em>. Feeling a bit dumb, you push the button and the pad lights 
up.</Br>
<Br>From seemingly no where, you hear an average man's voice giving you instructions. 
"Please place your right index finger on the pad for first scan."</Br>
<Br>You did as you were instructed, you saw the light scan in your print, then go back to 
it's starting point.</Br>
<Br>Again, you heard the voice. "Please repeat the process with your left index 
finger."</Br>
<Br>You do, the process finishes, but then the voice comes back. "Thank you, please wait 
comfortably until the prints are loaded into our database. Depending on volume, this may 
take a while. Please note, since this is presumably your first time with the cruise, each 
guest is required to return to their own rooms for just the first night of their stay. You will 
need to be in your room before sunset and remain in your room till we receive a second 
night time print. Once the process is finished, you will be free to do as you please, when 
you please. Thank you for your cooperation and enjoy your time with the all male Pleasure 
Princess Cruise."</Br>
<Br>Wondering why you would need to have a second set of prints confused you, but you 
shrugged it off. Knowing you could be there for a while, this time around, you undress 
completely, so you would have nothing else in your way of exploring what the cruise had 
to offer. Naked, you look your body over taking in all of it's features, trying to figure out 
how you would use your naked body language to entice other guys into talking with you. 
Wanting to feel the softness of that bed envelop the real, naked you, you walk back over 
to the bed and lay down. Needing something to do to kill whatever amount of time you 
were stuck in there, you push the button for the television, expecting the one above the 
fireplace to come on. Much to your surprise and delight, a fifty-six inch flat panel, LCD 
HDTV rose out of the large rectangular chunk of wood at the foot of your bed. Once it was 
fully exposed, it turned itself on and started on the channel with the orientation video for 
the cruise. Knowing that was jut as good as anything for now, you watched it, in its 
entirety.</Br>
<Br>Just as the closing words finished, the door buzzed twice in quick succession. 
Wondering if that meant you were free to go or if you already had a visitor. Once you were 
at the door, you put your index finger on the pad and once it finished scanning quickly, 
the door opened toward you. Ready for your adventure to begin, you noticed the television 
had already turned itself off and lowered itself halfway into its casing. Standing in front of 
the door, ready to step through the threshold, you...</Br></p>
