<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Giggles the conductor taken the envelopes with Stripey and Rosie and gone into the bus, putting then on two supports where they could see the other people on the bus. As ZipZap said, all them had Fell Down someway. They noted they could move their eyes everywhere normally, but they couldn't see through the address label and by something on one of the envelope sides who looked like the biohazard symbol.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hullo, guys!&quot; said a guy obviously turned on a Yogi Bear clone, dripping water from holes everywhere his body. Looks obviously he was shot by a redneck's shotgun and fancied some water after . &quot;You're new? Temp or Perm? Name's Hunny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're new, yes. Rosie here turned perm. I'm temp now, but I want to perm as toon. Name's Stripey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'll not perm. I have family in home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know the other guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some... This...&quot; He pointed what looked an eyed pile of dust &quot;Is Flappy. He is a flying squirrel and had made the mistake of going the way of a military fighter jet as flying around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guy, not my fault&quot; chirped the dust pile called Flappy &quot;The radar and TCAS from my aviator hat had gone bananas and when I saw I had passed through that turbojet motor. Oh well, I'm a flying nut, you see. And at least I learned very well how a turbine works.&quot; Everyone laughs.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that's Geoff. He's a perm schnauzer.&quot; said Hunny<br />
<br />
&quot;And what happened to Geoff?&quot; asked Rosie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was runnink bevore that pesky cat, you now. But when I saw, I was runnink into dat broomstick machine.&quot; said Geoff, with a strong german accent. Rosie now saw Geoff looked like a Broomstick.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then we have Tony the Happy Scarecrow.&quot; said Hunny<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing as cool. I was getting around, seeing things and a pesky dog bite me and took my straw out.&quot; said Tony, who looked so much as the Oz' Scarecrow, looking empty.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is Don and Camille. They are 100% human and Don looks like an FDTnaut. Giggles let Camille in even she's not Fell Down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Camille looked like Dorothy from Wizard of Oz as described on books: blonde hair, a simple white and blue gingham dress and hat. Don looked a little chubbier than average, with salt-and-pepper hair and dressed on an old-fashioned medieval knight clothes, with knickerbockers and bouffant sleeves and a sword. He was flattened as a pancake.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to you, Herr Don.&quot;, asked Geoff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oldy, classy rollercoaster. I'm trying the '1001 ways to Fall Down before you die' list from the ToonWorld fansite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I say he's nuts!&quot; said Camille, giggling. &quot;This is the fifth time he Fell Down just this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I had a issue with a bobcat before, and was turned into rags, but just that. I need to say although I know Falling Down has no worse consequence for humans than for toon, I'm not that fan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But she's very skilled with Illogic Logic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; said Stripey &quot;But ZipZap said humans can't use Illogic Logic, as they can't Mega Fall Down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she just said a little wrong. NORMALLY humans can't use the Illogic Logic, BUT some can do, like Camille there. They can't explain how this works, but looks like optimistic people works Illogic Logic better. I think is because people need to be a little Pollyanna to using Illogic Logic as human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And there's T'sang Tung Ho. She's a tiger kung fu fighter.&quot; Said Hunny.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's happen?&quot;, asked Rosie<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistake. Not focused enough. Bobcat clan ambushed. No honor. I failed.&quot; she said, showing her body, turned into rags piled on her spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's not a verbose toon.&quot; said Hunny. &quot;She made Giggles looks a happy fellow.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tour was fun and other toons where added to the FDT, and even a human or two. They talked a lot and taken the contacts of everyone. Some guys dropped the tour as soon they recover, like the tiger fighter. Others, like Flappy, Hunny, Don and Camille, stayed even after that.<br />
<br />
Stripey and Rosie learned about the Anime Sector, with all japanese craziness of moe girls fighting demons with big hammers and so on. And about the Crypt, the terror sector where lives mad cientists and vampires and zombies, and everything. They learned about the Cute Sector were Care Bears and Little Ponies and Strawberry Shortcake and Rainbow Brite lives. And all the sectors from the ToonWorld. <br />
<br />
It's when just lasted on the FDT Flappy, Hunny, Don and Camille, as also Stripey and Rosie, Giggle looked on the envelopes for the hotel address. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok...&quot; he looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Giggles, I'm feeling weird.&quot; said Rosie<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too.&quot; said Stripey<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-oh.&quot; said Giggles taking some gasmask and giving for all, one he wearing himself. &quot;Stand aside, give them space. Don't worry, just put the gasmasks and everything will be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
As everyone worn their gasmasks, Giggles hit a button on the bus panel that closed all the windows. Then he take the envelopes and open it, pushing the trembling black sheets that were Stripey and Rosie, before they POOFed back into their true forms in all their skunk-ness, including their stink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about spoil the tour.&quot; said Rosie, as she see the green stink smoke going over her tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry.&quot; said Giggles. &quot;I'll help a little you.&quot;  as he taken Rosie's tail and gave it a knot, skillfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch! My tail! What had you done.&quot; said Rosie, uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
&quot;When you knot a skunk tail, her stink stops.&quot; said Giggles, as he knotted Stripey's tail skillfully. &quot;It's a little uncomfortable, but not painful or hurtful. Some skunk tries to roll their tails and put it in a type of bonnet for the tail. Looks more comfortable, but this don't work 'cause your tail can unroll when you goes excited or worried. You should training giving each other knots on your tails. It's good policy. Some stories forbid unknotted skunks from enter&quot; he said, finishing the knot and spraying the bus with some AirFresh. The others removed the gasmasks. Camille looks indignantly: <br />
<br />
&quot;That was barbarian!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, darling.&quot; said Hunny &quot;Giggles there has no skunk prejudice. He does this as his job. And he don't apply SDP there. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Skunks are so mistreated in ToonWorld?&quot; asked Flappy, who looks green as Stripey and Rosie on toon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Top on '10 species you should never try on' from ToonWorld fansite.&quot; said Don, the FDTnaut.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know. ZipZap had SDP'd the room we use as nuptial room on Transformation Center. We felt a little uneasy with this, even knowing she made this 'cause it's her job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stripey and Rosie talked Flappy and Camille what SDP was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Gracious!&quot; said Camille &quot;It's so ignoble. You should stand against this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Every society has its rules, even a toony one.&quot; Said wisely Hunny. &quot;But things are changing and I think you'll have a good time on ToonWorld.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Final stop, Ritz hotel.&quot; said Giggles. &quot;You all are in the same hotel, nah? It eases the things.&quot;</p>
