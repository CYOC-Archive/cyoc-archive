<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;My Yomato.&quot; Said Chiyoye turning her head to look at her mate, &quot;Now that the <br />
consciousness if the witches are gone, then the use of the game now is harmless. And <br />
while yes, it is a good thing to have this curse gone from Glendale, this means that we can <br />
reassume our duty as Alpha-Kaylee's gallery without danger. Megan and Margot can join <br />
us as they wished. And this would greatly reduced the burden of the Betas and the <br />
Omegas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yomato nodded, &quot;Yes my Chiyoye it would. But sadly, I still have the dishonor of being an <br />
impulsive thug to Penny-San, and must atone for this great dishonor before returning to <br />
our task. Otherwise it would be purely an act of cowardice, and thus an even greater <br />
dishonor, and I would not have you and the others return to our duty without me there to <br />
be with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, and thank you my Yomato.&quot; Chiyoye said as they lay on the bed on her back (she <br />
could never sleep on her stomach due to her absurdly sized breasts). <br />
<br />
Megan and Margot looked at each other from their beds. Both thinking the same thing, 'We <br />
still have our turns since we used them on each other.' However both of them would tell <br />
their mate Lawrence, and Megan's brother Roger, precisely what they were going to do <br />
ahead of time. Both silently agreed that doing so before without saying a thing to their <br />
loved ones had been very very VERY stupid, not to mention cruel and unthinking of their <br />
sister-wives and other other dear ones. <br />
<br />
Michelle on her spot on the table did nothing to discourage these thoughts,  'I chose this <br />
existence. To tell others not to would be hypocritical...' <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Fran already back to sleep by the time they returned to the master bedroom, the Alpha <br />
deposited the Beta in the bed and quickly rejoined her.  Terri and Sandi meanwhile, were <br />
reassigned to making sure the Alphas didn't try anything else until tomorrow. <br />
<br />
Both were quickly back to sleep. <br />
<br />
Kaylee dreamed she left her bedroom, she dreamed she sat down in the living room, she <br />
dreamed she had the entry way statue, the three fountain heads, and the medical wing's <br />
good-luck nicknack all sitting on the table or on the coaches miming sipping tea. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; Kaylee said politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Alpha-Kaylee.&quot; They all said back. &quot;I'm Kira.&quot; Said the bronze entry way statue. &quot;I am <br />
Michelle.&quot; Said the nicknack, which was the name everyone called it by.  &quot;I am Leslie.&quot; <br />
&quot;Nelson.&quot; &quot;Helen.&quot; Said the fountain heads. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is all this?&quot; Kaylee wondered at this dream. <br />
<br />
Kira took a 'sip' from his tea cub. &quot;Maybe it's a linger trace of the time you spent as a living <br />
statue yourself along with your mate, Sunny and Luna. But whatever the case, it seems you <br />
and me, and if you like, the rest of my sub-pack can chat for a little bit.&quot; <br />
<br />
Michelle walked on the table and looked up at her Alpha, &quot;We Yomato freed all of us from <br />
the Glendale gallery, some of us took a vote and decided that we had gotten so used to be <br />
looked at by people, watching the centuries go by, and basically being silent observers, <br />
that we didn't want to adjust to being finite flesh and blood again.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee nodded, &quot;I see.&quot; <br />
<br />
Michelle said doing a little dance for her Alpha to which she clapped, &quot;I heard from the <br />
others that you love art that has a soul all it's own. We all prefer that most don't know what <br />
we are, so we can observe without people feel uncomfortable or wondering if we still like <br />
standing in one place all day not being able to interact with anyone besides each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our fellow victims from the gallery know though.&quot; Said Nelson, &quot;We also worded our <br />
'Transform or Dare' so as statues we'd never be damaged, neglected or abandoned.  But <br />
while you might like us Alpha, we think you'd truly feel happy know we are watching you <br />
back when you look at us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kalyee nodded.<br />
<br />
Kira said, &quot;Alpha, Transform or Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee gasped, and while she knew she was trapped and it was futile, she said, &quot;Dare.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kira said, &quot;I Dare you to be aware, either consciously or subconsciously at your own <br />
preference, that we are in fact statues with souls all our own. And are able to perceive us a <br />
such if it is your preference regardless of what form we take.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee felt relieved, her short experience had taught her that while she appreciated those <br />
who had chosen this existence, she had far too many loved ones to exist simply as art <br />
herself.  Then her curiosity hit, &quot;What do you mean? 'Regardless of what form you take?' <br />
<br />
Michelle nodded, being the least threatening in appearance and size to her Kaylee. <br />
&quot;Another part of our Transform was that if we vote united, we can become flesh and blood <br />
again and can move perceived or unperceived like ghosts at our choice... or not, not sure if <br />
that part was included or not. But we can become alive again if we all agree to it and then <br />
become art again. And we become the kind of art we wish to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee stared at amazement, 'that's one way to insure to avoid boredom as you sit out <br />
eternity.'  &quot;Amazing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Michelle said. <br />
<br />
Kaylee thought about this. &quot;So, you don't have to be as you are? You can become other <br />
forms of art?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nelson answered, &quot;We were a trio of gallery statues for a little bit actually, and Michelle <br />
here was a colored glass statue.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee was surprised, she remembered the bronze statue being in the hallway for decades <br />
and seeing it built, and remembered when Julie bought the little 'good luck totem' for the <br />
medical wing... And the installation of the fountain heads...   &quot;Do the gargoyles know?&quot;<br />
<br />
The five statues looked at each other, &quot;I guess they'd have to.&quot; Nelson said, &quot;We didn't <br />
really think of that... I guess they just don't feel the need to mention it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee nodded. And got a very interesting idea. Then Kira said, <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Or they think all fleshlings should be added to the great stoneness and will devour us all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone looked at Kira weird.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; She asked. <br />
<br />
Kaylee decided to detour that trainwreck and said, &quot;If you can really become almost <br />
anything as long as it's humanoid and art, can you do me a favor?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Anything for our Alpha.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee grinned. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
A few minutes later Kaylee awoke, still feeling groggy and saw Sandi and Terri standing <br />
guard outside the bedroom again. Kaylee however went to the master bedroom's <br />
bathroom, and looked out a window. <br />
<br />
She saw sitting on the fountain back to back were five fountain heads. All of them female, <br />
all of them facing a different direction. They were all very polished marble and the seven <br />
foot tall had breasts twice the size of beach balls (like the japanese lupmans). The shape of <br />
the fountain heads were all lupmans of course. Out of their oversized breasts came a pair <br />
of stream of water from their stone nipples from the piping system that ran through them. <br />
Each had a silly happy grin on their faces.<br />
<br />
Kaylee smiled and nodded and went back to bed.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
'You know this is actually kinda fun.' Said Nelson. <br />
<br />
'I have to agree.' Said Kira. <br />
<br />
'Oh! There's Alpha Kaylee in the window! She saw us!' Said Leslie. <br />
<br />
'Good,' Said Helen, 'I'd do anything for our Alpha Female, but I think I prefer our previous <br />
set up.'<br />
<br />
'I think I liked being Beta-Julie's goodluck nicknack too.' Said Michelle. <br />
<br />
'Sorry girls, you're out voted,' Said Nelson, or was that 'Nessie' for now? 'We stay like this <br />
for a while longer.' The fact Nessie now had a female shaped stone body didn't really <br />
bother him/her, after all, she/he was just stone right now, any gender she/he had was <br />
purely artistic like this anyway.<br />
<br />
'Dang.' Thought Helen. <br />
<br />
'Don't worry.' Said Kira, 'If it means that much to you, after the kids leaves we can go back <br />
to our previous set up, though I think I'll spend a while like this.' <br />
<br />
Of course, for being who time held little meaning, 'when the kids leave' could mean 'end <br />
their visit' or 'go off to collage' they had eternity after all. <br />
<br />
'Good,' Thought back Michelle, 'I think I gave Julie some peace of mind just by being there <br />
for her as her good luck totem.' <br />
<br />
Kira said, 'I guess I really did improve how impressive the entry way looked. And alpha <br />
female said she didn't mind us changing as long as she had say in what we became if <br />
clashed with her taste. And she said we only had to stay this way as long as liked... ' <br />
<br />
'Oh! Here comes Pence!' Michelle cheered.<br />
<br />
The jasper colored wolf twin boy looked at the statues, a look of wonder of his face,  &quot;How, <br />
how did he do it? How did he manage to hide among you guys and get a sting on those <br />
two leoman girls?&quot; <br />
<br />
No one said a thing about there now being five statues, all of them now being female, and <br />
having giant breasts that let out streams of water into the basin below.  Even Amy and <br />
Penny didn't so much as give it a glance, but this might have had to do with both having <br />
more important things on their minds. <br />
<br />
'Heh, he wants to know?' Kira thought mischievously. <br />
<br />
Helen thought, 'Should be good.' <br />
<br />
Michelle resigned, 'Oh all right I suppose it won't hurt.' <br />
<br />
Pence looked in surprise as the statues seemed to shuffle to make room for one more. He <br />
then felt the urge, no, the -need- to sit down in that space, it was meant for him, no, he <br />
was meant for it! <br />
<br />
He took a few steps, climbed up and turned lifted his tail and sat down. the moment he did <br />
he couldn't move, but he didn't mind. He felt himself getting bigger and bigger, older? He <br />
felt his boy thing vanish and a hole appear in it's place. At the same time, he felt his chest <br />
getting bigger and bigger, and felt his face tug into a silly smile, but he felt silly and happy <br />
so that was okay. He saw his nose become white, and very shinny. Marble? That was when <br />
he felt something invader his rear and go up his (her?) body until it split in two and snaked <br />
out into his (breasts?) and she felt tiny openings appear, and then, the nice cool, relaxing <br />
peaceful flow of water go through her and out of the tips of nipples. <br />
<br />
'This... this is kinda fun.'<br />
<br />
'We think it is.' Thought a voice sounding like it was coming from the statue next to her. <br />
<br />
'Huh?' Pence thought back at the voice. <br />
<br />
'Hi.' The five statue introduced themselves and explained as much as they could to a little <br />
boy, leaving out enough details so it wouldn't stir the pot and make things more <br />
complicated. <br />
<br />
'So you're all alive....'<br />
<br />
Michelle said, 'Well, we have souls, so that technically means we're alive.'<br />
<br />
'And... you've been like this for a short bit? But I always remember-'<br />
<br />
'Perception camouflage... a couple of us are going to go back inside the house after a bit... <br />
' <br />
<br />
For Pence of course 'a bit' meant minutes not years or decades. <br />
<br />
'So I can stay like this, feeling the water go through me, as long as I like, and no one will <br />
notice no matter how long I'm gone?'<br />
<br />
'We're not sure how it'll effect your life if you're like this for a really long time. And we'd <br />
rather not test that. We did this just so you'd know how your brother did it. We helped out <br />
our fellow pack mates. If the leoman girls can use have their special talents, we can use <br />
ours to help you. After all, we're just part of the scenery and thus just part of the home turf <br />
advantage.'<br />
<br />
Pence giggled mentally, just one of the six busty fountain heads. That was when he felt <br />
another urge, and inched along into the lap of the she-wolve next to her, she felt herself <br />
shrinking, her giant bust vanishing and her boy thing returning from the hole. Yes, this <br />
was where he needed to be! He felt himself getting smaller, younger, until he was a <br />
toddler in shape. And he became one solid mass of stone with Michelle who was the statue <br />
holding him. Her piping extended into him and up into his mouth and he began to spit from <br />
his mouth into the basin. <br />
<br />
'How's that?' Michelle asked.<br />
<br />
'Heheheh, nice!' Michelle didn't feel cold, she felt, warm to Pence. <br />
<br />
That was when Pence saw Jay, mooping around, though Pence didn't know it, Jay was <br />
lamenting as Pence had about not having a sibling like the other young gem lupmen. <br />
<br />
'Go to him, he is your brother after all, we have each other, he has you, and you have him, <br />
family belongs together after all.' Michelle urged.<br />
<br />
With a trace of reluctance, Pence ceased to be the same piece of stone as Michelle and the <br />
piping snaked out of him, and he grew an grew into he was his actual age and stepped <br />
down from the fountain. the little lupman cub looked back at them, they looked back with <br />
their unchanging silly stone grins. <br />
<br />
Pence waved and went back to his brother as the other twin emerged from the mansion <br />
with Mary leading them. <br />
<br />

<br />
In the year 1673, <br />
<br />
All three witchlings awoke with a start, a very loud one. The sensitive senses of their foster <br />
father was roused and he rushed into their bedroom, Princess barely having time to hide <br />
under the bed in the confusion. <br />
<br />
