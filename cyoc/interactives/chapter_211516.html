<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Kangaroo Lady made your new father sign the papers while your new mother added things. She was holding you and nuzzling you lovingly. You would have liked to protest. This was all a mistake! A terrible mistake! You had only drunk from the Fountain Of Youth and this is how you were punished? Really? No! You didn&#39;t sign up for this! You just wanted to have fun as a baby, not start over your life! Let alone as a werewolf. Your new mother sensed your discomfort and patted you tenderly, shushing you softly at the same time. And the pats and little circles she rubbed on your back, well... They felt good. Soothing. Amazingly comforting, even. You had the sensation that everything was going to be all right. Mommy&#39;s fur was warm, her voice soft and she even placed a plushy blanket on top of you. What a nice idea, because you suddenly were feeling exhausted. Maybe if you closed your eyes for just a few seconds, it wouldn&#39;t hurt. How could it. You rested you eyes and before you knew it, you were asleep, your thumb sliding into your mouth. This gesture went unregistered by your consciousness but it brought out coos from everyone in the room. The werewolves then took you back to their enclosure in their designed exhibit. <br />
<br />
When you woke up, you saw you were in a wooden crib that smelled pleasantly of wood, precisely. The crib was quite large, to accommodate your next few years. You had been wrapped in blankets, with toys stream about. As you tried to move, feebly, you noticed a crinkle on your groin. What the...? It started again. A crinkle. Definitely a crinkle. And it felt like a pillow had been wrapped around your crotch. Oh, no! It must be a diaper! You had been diapered! Diapered! You flail your puny arms and wanted to shout your humiliation out loud but it only came out as wails. Immediately a large familiar face loomed over you, worried.<br />
&quot;Oh, my sweetie. What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
What was wrong? You&#39;d been been transformed and reduced to a helpless baby against your own will, here was what was wrong! But you could only wail and gurgle and the female werewolf picked you up, cooing and took you to a rocking chair. There she sung you a lullaby and popped a bottle into your mouth. You tried to shake it out but she was too strong. Then the milk gushed into your mouth and the flow was too powerful and you swallowed it. The humiliating bib she had tied around your neck before be damned. After your forced meal, you felt too full, too bloated to scream. Your stomach gurgled something fierce with all the milk churning inside it. It was all you could do to keep it down and not have you head spin. Luckily, Mommy was there to burp you. She then tickled you and you giggled wildly. Hey! That tickled! She then kissed you and put you in a playpen to discover your plush toys. Wooden or plastic toys, as well as chewing bones, would have to wait for later. As you banged and chewed happily on a plushy block, you suddenly realized you had lost yourself, completely so. Since Mommy gave you the yummy warm milk and... Wait... When did it become normal to call the female werewolf &#39;Mommy&#39;? And why was it so delightful to be tickled and play about with toys for infants or dogs? This was mortifying. Alas for you, it was only the beginning. <br />
As you looked around, you saw the home was strange. The walls looked like the walls of a cave, but fake, as if made out of plaster and plastic and painted over. And the interior is mingling of old and new artefacts and objects, like the werewolves want to live as both pre-industrial people while still retaining some specific comforts. Later, she takes you outside and bounces you on her lap while your father is cutting a deer carcass. Later, he pretends to bite you and snap at you while your mother is tanning the hide of the beast. Your desire to take morsels of the delicious raw venison is interrupted when you notice people staring at you and taking, high up from a wall and against a thick railing. Oh no! This id the park exhibits! Except now... You&#39;re part of these same exhibits, shoeing of pieces of your lifestyle to the eyes of visitors! And you&#39;re in a diaper! Of course, it is just at that moment that your bladder decides to give and you pee. You pee in a diaper under the eyes of strangers! You wail in shame but to all it is merely your discomfort. Some people even laugh! But your mother deftly changes you after you father went in to get a clean diaper cloth and soon you are dry again, tickled by both your parents, which make you squirm and giggle uncontrollably. Right after, your father slides another bottle into your mouth and you have to drink yet again to the point you worry your tummy will explode. That damn full tummy... It gurgles, it sloshes around and it makes you sluggish and sleepy... And your burp brings in more laughter... And you&#39;re too tired to protest... Your eyes droop and your last thoughts are about how soft Mommy is and how strong Daddy is. You hope you can one day be as strong as he is. You gurgle happily and sleepily and again your thumb makes your way into your mouth. The delicious milk rests in your belly and it was so tasty... You giggle as Daddy tickles you under the chin and it so entertaining! Being peppered with kisses, nuzzles and tickled is always fun, especially in the sun and fresh air outside. You hope tomorrow will be just as pleasant with Mommy and Daddy.</p>
