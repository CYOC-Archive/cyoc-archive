<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now that you had a grip on how your new merging ability worked, you decided that you wanted to start making the most of it.  After all, your writing career taught you that quality is oftentimes better than quantity, though a bit of both never hurts.  As things were, it was hard to focus on more than one change while merging your duplicates unless you wanted general enhancement overall.  However, you certainly had no shortage of clones, so you didn&#39;t mind taking the time to do things carefully.<br />
<br />
Pairing up your innumerable bodies, you began to press them together while gently fondling yourselves.  Before willing your forms to merge together, you pictured yourself doubling your number of tongues.  Once the first combination finished, you figured that you might as well continue the pattern of having three of a given body part.  Hugging yourselves again, you repeated the process while envisioning yourselves gaining a third tongue everywhere applicable.  Once you finished, you licked your lips with three tongues in sequence, finding the new arrangement pleasantly unique.<br />
<br />
Seeing that you had barely dented the sheer magnitude of the number of duplicates you had, you thought about another thing you wouldn&#39;t mind having more of.  After finding out that you could increase how many clitorises you had in your pussynipples, you felt that it was only right to give each of your tongues something to play with.  Two more merges later, you were moaning from the sensation of using the tongues inside your vagina-nipples to stimulate the trio of clits inside each one.  As you were doing so, you accidentally aroused yourself just enough to cause one of your bodies to orgasm, likely because Mary was already eating out that particular copy of you.  Thankfully, you didn&#39;t have any further climaxes, leading you to only double in number this time.<br />
<br />
Not done enhancing your breasts, you decided it was time to make them bigger.  Although having perky D-cup breasts was nothing to be ashamed of, you couldn&#39;t help but want more, especially after seeing just how big Julie had gotten.  Pairing up your clones and gingerly massaging your tits so that you wouldn&#39;t get too aroused, you felt your mounds slowly grow about one cup size larger in your hands while your bodies sank into each other.  Wasting no time, you repeated the process, finding that the result was the same, your mammaries growing another size to reach a full F-cup.  Since you still had an absurd number of duplicates, you felt no shame in merging with yourself four more times, ending with three rows of impressive J-cup breasts that practically spilled out of your hands if you tried to lift them.<br />
<br />
Wondering how the growth for your cocks would scale, you walked up to one of your other bodies and hugged yourself from behind, using your six hands to squeeze your other boobs and revelling in the feeling of how soft and malleable they were.  As you began to sink into the copy in front of you, your mind focused on making the dicks in your crotch longer.  After the merge finished, you stood next to another duplicate and lined up your penises, discovering that they were now an inch longer than before.  After the rest of your clones went through the same process, you had all of your bodies continue to condense your number eleven more times, leaving your cocks at an even four feet long.<br />
<br />
As things were, Sarah and her parents certainly weren&#39;t excluding you from their lovemaking even as you continued to merge your bodies together.  Furthermore, all of your additional self-play that was required for the process was hastening along your next climax, and it wasn&#39;t long before sixteen of yourselves ejaculated in unison all over the tireless family nembers.  As you considered making your dicknipples longer next, you realized that their current level of sensitivity would make it very hard for you to keep from multiplying during the process if you kept engaging in sex at the same time.  Therefore you excused yourselves from the company of Sarah, Mary and Erika under the pretenses of using the restroom, and isolated yourselves until you could finish improving yourself.<br />
<br />
Calculating that it would take twelve merges to make your foot-long nipple-cocks twice as lengthy, you continued the steady work of melding your bodies together.  Afterward, you finally felt like everything was as big and long as you wanted it to be... for now.  That said, you still had so many clones that you estimated the number to be somewhere in the quadrillions.  As such, even five percent of them orgasming in unison would be disastrous if any of your bodies were outside the house when it happened.  While pondering how else you could improve yourself, one of your elbows accidentally grazed against your lower-right nipple, causing it to grow erect and start leaking precum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot; You thought, &quot;Why not make things more sensitive?  After all, why go to the effort of making a thousand bodies feel good when I can make one body feel as good as a thousand?&quot;  That said, you still loved having a dizzying amount of duplicates of yourself, but it would be easy to multiply again after this.  Just imagining how mindblowing the sex would be with millions of dicks that were several orders of magnitude more sensitive than they were already was making your pussies incredibly wet.<br />
<br />
Setting your plan in motion, you figured that the safest thing to make more pleasurable first would be your vaginas, both in your crotch and on your breasts.  After halving your number of copies twice, you experimentally stuck a finger in your vagina.  Biting your lip because it felt so good, you estimated that it already felt as good as four pussies rolled into one.  Putting your quadrillions of brains to work in parallel, a bit of simple exponential math was easy to work out in an instant.  &quot;So if things get twice as sensitive each time, twenty merges would make them 1,048,576 times as pleasurable... Sounds incredible,&quot; you thought to yourself as your tripled tongues licked your lips in anticipation.  Eighteen more times, you repeated the ritual of fondling yourself while smushing your bodies together, achieving the desired result.  As you looked down at your glistening vaginas, you were so tempted to test one out, but you knew that doing so would guarantee a climax of gargantuan proportions.<br />
<br />
Even after all that, you still had billions of bodies to work with.  Figuring that your penises and breasts could also be made more sensitive, you decided to give your dicks the same treatment next.  Twenty more assimilations later, your throbbing rods contained the power of a million separate cocks in one, and even more in your dicknipples.  At last, you had melded together so many of your bodies that you could count them without too much strain, and found that you still had 14,336 of them.<br />
<br />
Still intent on finishing the job by making your amazing breasts even more responsive, you began to have your remaining duplicates step towards each other to embrace and kiss yourselves.  However, you failed to predict how strong the feeling of all your hypersensitive, four-foot-long cocks being squeezed between your columns of breasts would be, and all of you ejaculated in unison from the stimulation.  As every copy of you spread out into over fourteen thounsand clones, a huge portion of your work was undone.<br />
<br />
Wondering if the app could help you work things out better, the closest one of your two hundred and five million bodies picked up the phone and generated a sentence about yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;This hermaphrodite is surprised that no foreplay is required for her to ejaculate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thankful for an easy statement to work with, you added a few letters to turn &quot;no&quot; into &quot;normal&quot;.  After reality shifted imperceptibly once more, you cautiously tested the change by gently stroking one of your stiff cocks.  While it did feel absolutely amazing, you no longer felt like it would start spewing cum if you touched it for one second too long.<br />
<br />
Returning to what you were attempting to do before your unintended multiplication, you tried once more to combine your bodies.  Successful this time, you kept things consistent and merged yourselves in pairs a grand total of twenty times.  Content to have J-cup breasts that felt like a million in one, you were left with 200,704 copies of yourself.<br />
<br />
Something you couldn&#39;t help but notice was that kissing yourself felt very dull in comparison to the extremely amplified sensations that the rest of your body provided.  Determined to fix that, you started merging yourselves repeatedly, only stopping after twelve times.  At this point, your lips were 4,096 times as sensitive as they used to be, and probably would boost your hormones by an equivalent amount when kissing someone.<br />
<br />
Eager to test them out, you spread out your remaining forty-nine bodies into seven groups of seven.  Trying something a bit different, you had each septuplet stand in a circle and lean inward a bit so that each of your right heads could start kissing the next body&#39;s left head.  With nobody to kiss with your middle heads, you instead lined up your middle dicks and started sucking on them.  As expected, it felt amazing compared to before, but you wouldn&#39;t have minded getting a few more merges.  While these thoughts passed through your mind, you were surprised to find your lips starting to bond with the skin of the mouths you were kissing.  For some reason, you didn&#39;t ever think of trying to merge more than two clones at once.  Knowing it was too late to change it, you let each circle of bodies converge, septupling the sensitivity of your lips.<br />
<br />
Bringing your remaining seven bodies together in the room where your phone was, you decided on your next course of action.</p>
