<br />
Once the encore was in full swing, it became easier to tell who the real fans of Jason Henderson were, and who was just there to accompany them. The fans were back to bopping along to the music, almost oblivious to the transformations they&#39;d just undergone. The others were either looking down at themselves, surreptitiously feeling their firmer bodies, their larger muscles, their larger breasts; or they were looking at their daughters, their nieces, whoever.<br />
<br />
So it was in Section 210, Row Q, with Kevin Jones, formerly a somewhat doughy accountant in his early 40s with thinning hair, now a musclebound hunk of an accountant with thick hair past his shoulders -- although the change to himself that he was obsessing over was the fact that his glasses had disappeared along with his gut, and yet he could still see perfectly.<br />
<br />
To his left, his 13-year-old daughter Annabelle and his 10-year-old daughter Emma just danced to Jason Henderson&#39;s tunes -- they hadn&#39;t used their seats at all once the show had started. They were still recognizable as themselves, despite the tweaks to their faces, although their figures had definitely been altered. Annabelle had become even curvier than her mother, and was wearing a skimpy green prom dress that matched her now intensely emerald-colored eyes, her dark brown hair in a striking chin-length bob.<br />
<br />
Emma had a figure now, with what Kevin estimated as B-cup breasts and thought seemed a bit too big for her still-petite frame. She&#39;d used her hard-earned allowance to buy a Jason Henderson T-shirt on the way into the show and changed in the restroom; now it had become a tight tank top that was designed to reveal just a bit of midriff, and the jeans she&#39;d been wearing had become a denim miniskirt, with her sneakers having turned into wedge sandals. Her brown hair, lighter than her sister&#39;s, had grown down to the top of her now-rounded ass.<br />
<br />
It was the fourth member of the party that he was most worried about, though, and that was Annabelle&#39;s friend Kim. She&#39;d been almost completely flat-chested and now had breasts a couple of sizes bigger than Annabelle&#39;s, her short black hair was now almost to her ankles, and she was wearing a tight black latex top with a &quot;keyhole&quot; cutout revealing her cleavage, a matching microskirt that would probably reveal all when she sat down, and thigh-high platform boots. She&#39;d also wound up with more jewelry than Kevin&#39;s daughters, including a charm dangling from a pierced navel and a silver ring through her septum. Kevin knew Kim&#39;s conservative Chinese parents weren&#39;t going to like this one bit.<br />
<br />
One step at a time, though. Jason finally completed the encore and left the stage (with one more reminder to &quot;expect more rewards for being a fan of mine&quot;), and as the thunderous screams and cheers continued, Kevin managed to herd the girls out into the arena concourse and towards the ladies&#39; room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, first of all, girls, you&#39;re going to wash off that makeup,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Annabelle was first to object. &quot;But he gave it to us. It&#39;s a reward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter whether or not it&#39;s a reward,&quot; Kevin snapped. &quot;You&#39;re too young for it. Go wash it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; his older daughter sighed, and the three girls trudged into the restroom.<br />
<br />
Now more people had left the main portion of the arena, with girls streaming into the ladies&#39; room -- judging from what Kevin was hearing, there was about to be a lot of face washing happening.<br />
<br />
Annabelle, Emma, and Kim emerged soon afterward, though, with their faces still fully made up, not looking entirely unhappy. &quot;It won&#39;t come off,&quot; Annabelle reported.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come on --&quot; Kevin began.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true, Mr. Jones,&quot; interjected Kim. &quot;It doesn&#39;t even smear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ask them!&quot; Emma pointed to a trio of platinum blondes who had just come out of the restroom. &quot;They were at the sink next to us!&quot;<br />
<br />
They were almost identical, in outfits akin to cheerleader uniforms, although Kevin could somehow tell the one in the middle was walking like a mother. He pointed to his face and asked her simply, &quot;Won&#39;t come off?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shrugged. &quot;Not with just water and soap, no. I&#39;m gonna try makeup remover at home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin felt slightly better. Of course, makeup remover -- that was something his wife probably had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, girls, I guess we&#39;ll go home,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we wanna wait outside for Jason!&quot; Emma whined.<br />
<br />
Kevin realized he probably should have seen this coming. &quot;Honey, he probably won&#39;t come out of his dressing room for hours. You&#39;ll get bored. And besides, you have school tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t get bored!&quot; Emma claimed. &quot;And I wish we didn&#39;t have school tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and I wish I didn&#39;t have to go to work, but --&quot; Kevin stopped, because he suddenly knew that tomorrow was a holiday, and that the girls&#39; schools and his office would be closed. And he could tell from the expression on the girls&#39; faces that they had just gained the same knowledge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; said Annabelle, putting a hand to her forehead. Kevin noticed for the first time her elongated, manicured fingernails.</p>
