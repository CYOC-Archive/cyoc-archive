<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Just cut to the chase Burton.”<br />
<br />
Jess Cling is a dedicated reporter for the news, fully supporting LGBT rights being a lesbian and in a committed relationship with her wife Jade Cling. So when the two giggling fan girls walked out of Burton’s house, she cringed greatly. <br />
<br />
Especially since Burton only agreed to have an interview with her in his bedroom.<br />
<br />
Sitting on a lounge chair opposite to the King sized bed Jack was playfully on, dressed in a clean cut white button up shirt, a light blue scarf around her neck and a firm sturdy blue skirt. Wasn’t particularly slim but she viewed that appearances should not be overly obsessed upon like those heterosexual ladies.<br />
<br />
Black heels and blonde hair tied in a pony tail, the caucasian woman glared at the hollywood heartthrob with her blue eyes framed by a pair of prescription glasses.<br />
<br />
She was assigned to come and get an “interview” from said movie star, but of course she has heard of the rumours of homophobia that Jack Burton exhibited. Carrying on her trusty tape recorder, she intend to make it the scoop of the century and the riot of all America.<br />
<br />
Little did she know, she and her little tape recorder fell into the trap.<br />
<br />
“Aw babe, don’t you know that scene makes lesbians turn into busty ladies ripe for picking?”<br />
<br />
Jess rolled her eyes, jotting down Misogynist and Homophobe on her notepad. Tapping down her pen, seriously why can’t Hollywood Just make ONE movie not about sex? <br />
<br />
Why not one movie about dedicated love? Like how she is dedicated to her wife, as she blushed at the thought and-<br />
<br />
(But you like it don’t you~?)<br />
<br />
“Excuse me?” Jess turned upward to the ceiling, the womanly seductive voice got her attention, a bit arousing but very intimidating, like a cougar about to pounce her.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong Jessica?”<br />
<br />
Jess jolted to the side, back at the movie star. A bit taken aback by the handsome man calling her by that name, not even her wife called her Jessica.<br />
<br />
...Wait, did she think that he’s handsome?<br />
<br />
She wanted to speak a snarky comment in retaliation, right back at him, but when she starred into his baby blue eyes rivalling hers, the tension between them melted with ease. Her vision cleared, as her blue mixed with a dash of yellow, pigmented up to a cool green.<br />
<br />
(He won, just give in)<br />
<br />
“Nothing Burton...” She gestured to him, looking downward and glancing at her notepad, vision blurry-astonishing the woman.<br />
<br />
Taking off her glasses, rubbing her brand new eyes. Prescription eyewear shifted to seducing sun glasses as she replaced them on her forehead, noting down her notes.<br />
<br />
She was astonished! She could have sworn she had written juicy, degrading details of Jack Burton. But instead, jotted down were positive attributes of the movie star, such as “Charming” - “Sweetheart” - “Likes Chocolate with vanilla swirl with mint chips on top”<br />
<br />
(Signed at the bottom, Jessica Bling~)<br />
<br />
Jess Cling did not understand what was going on! She felt like she was hallucinating, but that seductive cougar-like voice reassured that everything was fine, everything going according to plan, that she was going to get the prize-Wait what prize-?<br />
<br />
“...Mind telling me more about that scene from earlier again?”<br />
<br />
Jess’s mouth spoke on its own, lips pouting with a “POP!”, as perfectly aligned red lipsticks aligned her lips. Blush and foundation beautifying her facial features, as the roundness and model-like perfection accentuated themselves like the women she was stalked by before she dedicated herself to her wife.<br />
<br />
“I thought you didn’t like it babe~” He smirked cockily, like a predator ready to pounce on his prey, he knew he got her. As he licked his lips, starring at Jessica like she was his.<br />
<br />
(And he was hers)<br />
<br />
“Well you changed my mind~” Her voice lost the roughness to its tone, replaced by an airy quality with an accent a bit of a female equivalent  of Jack Burton himself. <br />
<br />
Well of course, she was his rival! Right? That’s why she got juicy details on him right? Really juicy details that she can use on him?<br />
<br />
(In bed)<br />
<br />
“Oh Jack~” Her voice smooth and sexy, rivalling the famous movie moan she emulated which caused the audience’s tents to raise into motion as well. Wait what movie? The movie Jack and her was in after all!<br />
<br />
Her white button down shirt merged with the skirt she wore as they shifted into one silky, expensive material, turning into a dark mysterious blue with sequins laced every corner. She felt a sense of pride and wealth laid upon her.<br />
<br />
Sleeves tearing off and reforming to silver bracelets, Diamond accessories looping around her fingers, jumping and piercing onto the ear lobes that had not been pierced with an “Eep!”<br />
<br />
She leaped out of the chair and into Jack Burton’s arms like that movie scene, the band containing her ponytail fell as luscious brunette curls sprouted out long, eradicating the blonde as she starred at Burton.<br />
<br />
Her mind reeled in shock and disgust, even being so close to Jack Burton irritated her! But her hands could stop feeling his strong muscles of his back, tracing the outlines as though she was experienced taking men in the bed.<br />
<br />
“Oooh~!” She moaned louder, feeling the lust for women escaping her as she focused on Jack’s built body. Her nipples stiffed, as the women and beloved wife she cared about faded into a self-centred care for her own beauty.<br />
<br />
(I have to be perfect after all)<br />
<br />
Her own voice echoed in her head, feeling her arms slender up as they underwent strict model training regimes to tone them up, legs long and graceful as she kicked off the now-diamond studded blue heels off of her much smaller feet.<br />
<br />
(Diamonds are a girl’s best friend after all)<br />
<br />
“Hot as always babe~” <br />
<br />
Jack grabbed a hold of Jessica’s breasts, fondling them into proud D-cups of a well maintained celebrity. She moaned louder with every touch of Jack like it was her first time with a man yet relishing every touch like she was a seasoned woman.<br />
<br />
Her tummy flattened out as her waist size shrunk massively. Buttocks expanded to fit her new sexuality, no way any lesbian is touching her male-only booty! She worked so her to maintain her figure!<br />
<br />
“You are a hot cougar babe~!”<br />
<br />
With that word, she rummaged and tore off Jack’s clothes like she did in the movie-impatiently fondling his buff pecs and bod as he pierced his large member through her new sexuality as romantic ost echoes in the background.<br />
<br />
Jessica Bling , soon to be Jessica Burton once the two of them made their engagement rings public. Kissed her soon to be fiancée deeper than any male she ever cruised on, that’s probably why Jack was so perfect for her-and why she was so perfect for him.</p>
