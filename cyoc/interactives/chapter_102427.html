<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Melissa Stovall came back outside with a tray of hastily prepared sandwiches, she was happy not only to see her daughter Julie and boyfriend Eric Anderson in their human forms and swimsuits once more, but a giant smile on Julie&#39;s face as Eric was texting on his cellphone.<br />
&quot;I get to go. I get to go!&quot; shouted Julie as her mother approached.<br />
&quot;To the Skulk gathering tonight with Eric?&quot; surmised Melissa. &quot;I&#39;m happy for you. After we eat we&#39;ll go upstairs and pick out one of your prettiest dresses, but despite the fact it&#39;s a fresh water swimming pool, both of you will need to take a shower. Julie has one in her private bathroom, while you can use the one in the cabana Eric.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, Mrs. Stovall,&quot; was all Eric said as he finished texting, but the thought of Julie taking a shower, let alone there ever being a chance of being in there with her, did cause his swim trunks to become a little tighter.<br />
<br />
As they started eating, Julie told her mother practically everything about their morning and afternoon together before Mrs. Stovall came home, making Eric&#39;s face redder than the worse sunburn one could ever suffer.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Eric,&quot; said her mother, silently enjoying the moment. &quot;If you haven&#39;t realized this already, most weres, regardless of their species, have no qualms about sex or public nudity, although we obviously dress for meals. In regards to us specifically, I&#39;ve been very open and honest about practically everything in life with Julie because I respect her as both a person and as my daughter. We&#39;ll have to take a more reserved approach around Mr. Stovall until he gets used to the idea that his little girl is not so little any more, but when it&#39;s just us...&quot;<br />
&quot;It does take getting used to,&quot; admitted Eric, feeling a little calmer.<br />
&quot;Well, while I know there are some aspects about being mayor that he can&#39;t talk to me about, Mr. Stovall and I have a very open relationship with each other too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Except for presents,&quot; said Julie, to which Eric just gave her a questioning look.<br />
&quot;What she means is that when it comes to things like birthdays and anniversaries, that is the only time a couple should keep a secret from each other,&quot; explained Melissa.<br />
&quot;Because you don&#39;t want to spoil the surprise,&quot; added Julie, fingering her single pearl necklace.<br />
&quot;Right. Otherwise, Martin and I believe that the secret to a happy and successful marriage is not to have any secrets,&quot; agreed Melissa.<br />
&quot;That I can totally agree with,&quot; said Eric, briefly recalling the sorry condition of his parents marriage when they were forced to move out of Minnesota to Moon Lake, but the big differences the town had made in everyone&#39;s lives since.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; said Melissa, secure in the knowledge that her daughter and future husband were well on their way to a great relationship. &quot;Now then, if you don&#39;t mind me asking, have you had any practice with the other stages since your first transformation, or have you had your tail in full display all afternoon?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just Stage 3. It&#39;s wonderful being fully transformed,&quot; said Eric with a smile, to which Julie smiled in return while grabbing his hand in hers.<br />
&quot;I agree, but there are advantages to the other stages too. Do you mind running through the first two for me right now?&quot; asked Mrs. Stovall.<br />
Eric simply nodded and raised his hand to show the webbing form between his fingers, as he raised one foot over the table long enough to show that he had full mastery over Stage 1 of his were-mer transformation. Then he stood up to display the scales running down his legs as he completed Stage 2.<br />
<i>Hmmm... they are blue-green, depending upon how the light hits them. Like Julie, I&#39;ve never seen a were-mer with that pattern either. I&#39;ll definitely have to ask Martin about that when I get the chance,</i> thought Melissa, as Eric assumed his normal appearance and sat back down next to his girlfriend.<br />
&quot;It looks like you&#39;re well on your way to being a wonderful were-merman that not only my daughter and our pod can be proud of, but Moon Lake as well,&quot; commented Mrs. Stovall.<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Eric. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind me asking, how many people are in... our pod?&quot;<br />
&quot;The four of us, counting my husband. His mother, for unfortunately her husband has passed on to the next ocean, along with his brother, my sister-in-law, and their kids. As the oldest, Martin is the pod leader since his father&#39;s passing, although his mother still retains her place of honor at major group meetings, like the one we&#39;ll be having next summer off the coast of Hawaii.&quot;<br />
&quot;Eric gets to go too, right?&quot; asked Julie.<br />
&quot;Technically, yes; but he should ask his parents&#39; permission when the time comes,&quot; pointed out her mother.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll say yes. After all, I&#39;ll be with my future fiance and in-laws,&quot; replied Eric, while giving his girlfriend a kiss on the cheek, which now caused Julie to blush a bit.<br />
&quot;Once you two are married, technically you form your own pod and go from there, unless for some reason you decide to remain a member of our pod Eric. Martin can explain all that better than I can when the time comes. Although both us and your own parents are hoping that we don&#39;t become grandparents until after you graduate college and are pursuing whatever your dreams are career wise.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know mom,&quot; said Julie. &quot;I took my pill this morning, and will keep taking them until Eric and I decide it&#39;s time to raise children of our own,&quot; she added, which brought the red blush briefly back to his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way, I wasn&#39;t out of line with the necklace, was I?&quot; Eric asked Mrs. Stovall. &quot;I was supposed to give it to Julie yesterday as my mom&#39;s idea of a promise ring, but forgot. Yet if felt right to give it to her now, especially in light of...&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; said Melissa. &quot;Since I was a normal until our wedding night, Martin gave me a traditional engagement and wedding ring,&quot; she added, briefly bringing her left hand closer to Eric so he could see them. &quot;Thankfully my webbing forms between them and my actual hand, and Martin made sure they were sea worthy too. But a single pearl necklace is the traditional were-mer version of an engagement ring, although it will understandably be a long engagement between the two of you.&quot;<br />
&quot;As long as I&#39;m with Julie and we do get married when we can,&quot; said Eric, taking her hand in his this time.<br />
&quot;Since most weres either can&#39;t or won&#39;t wear jewelry when fully transformed, a mermaid usually receives a waterproof chain on her wedding day as the ring,&quot; said Mrs. Stovall, continuing her explanation. &quot;The first anniversary the wife gets a little token for the chain, usually a heart engraved with the happy couple&#39;s names and wedding date, since she already has the single pearl necklace. At a pearl a year afterward, nineteen pearls usually fills a necklace on your 20th wedding anniversary, and with the twenty-first, you start all over again with a new chain and token commemorating that achievement, then continue from there. As you can see, next Spring will be my 21st wedding anniversary with Martin. Then this necklace will be kept in a cherished place as we continue enjoying wedded bliss together,&quot; added Mrs. Stovall, not realizing Eric and Julie were already thinking about their own future together.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
William Anderson was wondering why Eric had never responded to his earlier text saying that he could bring Julie Stovall to the Skulk meeting tonight, but if Eric made the decision his father thought he made today, could understand the delay and was happy for his youngest son.<br />
Moon Lake had been a major revitalization not only to the Anderson family marriage, but to all the Andersons as well, so William certainly couldn&#39;t begrudge Eric having his moment and opportunity to enter were society, especially with someone he truly loved and cared about like Julie.<br />
When he finally felt his cellphone vibrate about 4:20, William couldn&#39;t help smiling. He had already texted his wife Martha earlier that Nate and his boyfriend Alex Ramsey were giving him a ride home. The boys were sitting quietly in the back of his classroom actually paying attention to what he had to say to his students about Elizabethan and Shakespearean literature, when they weren&#39;t pouring over all the informational brochures they had received today concerning their possible futures at Moon Lake College.<br />
Dismissing the last class a bit on the early side about a quarter to 5, William hastily took out his cell and looked at Eric&#39;s reply.<br />
GREAT! JULIE & I WILL B THERE BY 7:30 VIA MRS. STOVALL.<br />
Curious, William texted back inquiring how Eric&#39;s day was going, to which he only received a one word reply.<br />
WONDERFUL!</p>
