<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When you have a skateboard, going around is an easy cruise. Even though the sun was high, cold winds passed by Paul&#39;s cheeks. The world is larger than before. Maybe it&#39;s because he&#39;s smaller now that he is in Jon&#39;s body. Or maybe, this is how Jon perceives the world?<br />
<br />
Paul reached the desolate Three Peaks Mall as the clock toiled a quarter to 12. He was hot and sweating just as he reached the abandoned mall&#39;s gates. He drank from the water bottle in his bag. There used to be a security guard roaming this establishment. But the mall owners could not pay anymore, so this mall is left for the elements to fester. Entering the premises, Paul saw how nature claimed the walls and ceiling of the wall. Lush and green vines broke through the glass skylight. Birds nestled where crystalline chandeliers would be. Dirt and moss-lined the escalators.<br />
<br />
Among it all, the real skater&#39;s treasure lies in the atrium. An abandoned skatepark. A failed attempt by the mall&#39;s owners to attract customers. When the skaters used the park, it drove the other customers away because of the noise and the trash. The malls closed and the skate park was forgotten. It was only through a humble-brag of their skater uncle that they&#39;ve come to know this place.<br />
<br />
By now, only Jon and his older brother know of this place.<br />
<br />
The memories of his older brother became reality when Paul saw him already doing board tricks by the skatepark. His name is Dan, a 19-year-old teenager who goes to the same school as Paul. He has the same chestnut hair as Jon, but a tinge darker due to age. He&#39;s wearing a loose white shirt that reaches past his waist and baggy black shorts.<br />
<br />
When Dan saw Paul on the corner of his vision, he landed near him and picked up his board.<br />
<br />
A familiar stranger, Paul thought. Looking at his face, Dan is his type. He&#39;s cute with a touch of handsome looks. His chin is soft and his pinkish button notes accentuated that cuteness. He&#39;s your typical boy next door. Something the ladies would fawn over.<br />
<br />
Dan&#39;s clothes are drenched with sweat so Paul offered him a towel and a button to drink. Dan wiped his sweat and tossed the towel to Paul&#39;s face as a joke.<br />
<br />
Dan laughed.<br />
<br />
Paul laughed as well, but only as to hide his sniffing of his new older brother&#39;s sweat.<br />
<br />
It smelled musty and briny. Paul took a deep whiff between the wheezes of his laugh.<br />
<br />
Soon afterward, Dan asked Paul to ready his skateboard so they could try grinding on a concrete barrier. Jon did it before. With the muscle memory living and present, Paul did the grind with ease.<br />
<br />
Though, the excitement of doing it for the first time is still there. There&#39;s also the fear of fucking it up and causing harm to his borrowed body.<br />
<br />
Paul increased his speed up a ramp. Just as he reached the peak, he jumped and landed two of the board&#39;s wheels on the ramp&#39;s edge. The wheels gritted and rolled millimeters at the edge. A margin of error is basically nonexistent. One wrong move. One wrong thought. One wrong expectation and it all comes tumbling down. But the experiences present in Paul&#39;s nimble feet meant that he lived through all the mistakes and success. He finished the grind with a round of applause from Dan who followed soon after with his own grind.<br />
<br />
Paul and Dan circled around the atrium, speeding on their skateboards and doing grinds mostly. They were heaving hard. Their clothes are darkened by their sweat. They took their rest in a small enclosure they&#39;ve made from gathering abandoned materials around the mall. They found a mattress so they covered it with a blanket from back home. They drank their water and regained their strength.<br />
<br />
While recovering stamina is Dan&#39;s goal, Paul had something else in mind. From his memories, something about Dan speaks of his interest in the same gender. He never had a girlfriend despite his handsome looks. Jon caught him watching porn once, but Jon was too young to understand what he was watching. But with Paul reliving those memories, he is 90% sure that the person humping his hips in that porn video is a man.<br />
<br />
Paul removed his shirt and let the air dry out his sweat-glistened abs. It&#39;s a bit presumptuous to call them abs when he could barely see them. He could make out the faint outline but only if he made his stomach hard.<br />
<br />
Dan saw his younger brother take off his clothes. He never realized how toned and mature his brother had become these past few years. It&#39;s been a long time since he saw him half-naked like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never saw you take off your clothes before,&quot; Dan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Paul replied, acting as if he didn&#39;t know a thing. Despite having no embarrassing scars, Jon is self-conscious about his body. So self-conscious that he won&#39;t even let his older brother peek an inch of his nude skin.<br />
<br />
A minute passed, and Paul swore Dan kept stealing glances. He&#39;s way much of a dunce and won&#39;t move unless pushed.<br />
<br />
Paul crept closer and laid his head on Dan&#39;s lap which caused him to perk up momentarily. He even felt Dan&#39;s dick grow harder.<br />
<br />
In this close proximity, Paul turned his head and sniffed Dan&#39;s sweaty stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you doing?&quot; Dan said, audibly surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m smelling you,&quot; Paul replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;re smelling me. What I meant is why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Paul said in a trailing voice. &quot;It makes me feel weird inside when I smell you. It&#39;s strange but it makes me excited over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul pointed at his groin, where a visible tent had sprung up.<br />
<br />
Dan is left speechless at the unfolding events.<br />
<br />
&quot;It kinda feels like that time from years ago, during our trip to California. On those steep hills that go up and down. Like when the car goes downhill and we feel that strange shiver in our pee-pees?&quot;<br />
<br />
A glint of recognition flashed on Dan&#39;s eyes. Then a shade of pink was painted on his cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did dad tell you about the flowers and bees yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul knows what those strings of words are but for the sake of innocence, he lied. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan pushed Paul aside and pulled down his shorts. A 6-inch flaccid penis, free from blemishes, greeted Paul by his face. It smelled even rankier than his sweat. It reeks of sour tobacco. Despite the stench, it is much more alluring than any scent Paul smelled before.<br />
<br />
Paul followed his brother&#39;s lead and undressed his shorts as well. His prepubescent penis is already half hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boys like us, we release a substance known as semen. Some call it cum. I call it cum. When semen goes inside a woman, it creates a baby.&quot; Dan explained, complete with actions from his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, babies did not come from storks? And how do we create semen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We did not come from storks. It&#39;s a lie to keep kids innocent. For a while, at least. And for that last question...&quot; Dan looked at my penis. &quot;Can I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul nodded, mouth open and huffing breaths.<br />
<br />
Dan&#39;s fingers pinch on Paul&#39;s fleshy penis and begin to pump it up and down. His fingers are warm and every rhythm of his movements sends snapping shivers on his back.<br />
<br />
Paul can&#39;t hold his excitement that easily in this young body. He came in Dan&#39;s hands but not as bountiful as his first try from before. But still, it left Paul in a vulnerable mess. He clutched onto Dan and hugged him tight while his penis was still squeezing cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- I- I- ah!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy...&quot; Dan cooed. &quot;It&#39;s alright. You&#39;re cumming and that&#39;s normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fake tears in his eyes, Paul calmed down but kept his chest close to his older brother. But in this position, he could feel Dan’s throbbing member do its beat and throes. Looking down, Dan’s penis had enlarged for an inch or so. Paul crouched down and let the musky member bake in front of his face. The smell punched him like a truck. Slowly, he slipped in a tongue. He ran in through the base of the shaft, up to the tip of the head.<br />
<br />
“What the hell are you doing?” Dan asked. “Where did you learn to do that?”<br />
<br />
Paul kept his eyes on the prize but managed to sneak a feisty look at Dan. <br />
<br />
For Dan, he knew his brother wouldn’t do such a thing. He’s that innocent little kid who acts like the mightiest man of the house but would cry if you annoy him one tiny bit. The charade he made earlier spoke of a kid who doesn’t even know what porn is. But this… this person is now licking his dick and balls… the guy has the experience. It’s strange to think of, and even stranger to admit but…<br />
<br />
“You’re not my brother are you?” Dan said between whimpers and moans. He wanted to push Jon away but the feeling is just too good. Every second is a guilt trip that he can’t get away from. <br />
<br />
Paul’s mouth slid and popped out. “What gave it off?” <br />
<br />
“I- I’m right? I&#39;m right! Where is my brother?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry. He’s here,” Paul tapped his head. “Just sleeping, unaware that I’m using his body to suck his older brother’s cock.”<br />
<br />
“Get him back!”<br />
<br />
“Or what? You’re going to hurt me? This is your younger brother’s body. Are you really going to hurt this cute little face?” Dan was taken aback. He wanted to run and collect his thoughts but his legs were still tired and weak. And this stranger that had taken hold of Jon’s body has its hands wrapped around his dick. <br />
<br />
“I’m going to tell somebody. You’ll see.” That was a half-assed threat.<br />
“And do you think somebody would believe you?” Paul smiled. “Besides, why complain? I am your brother, body, and mind. I have his memories, his deepest regrets, and his best-hidden secrets. I know everything about him, and all his knowledge about you. Does it really matter in the end? And besides, your brother would not do this.” <br />
<br />
Paul turned around and pulled the cheeks off his butt. Dan’s penis is already at its maximum hard-on and drenched with glistening saliva. Slowly, Paul pushed his asshole against Dan’s dick. The girth was too big, too large that Paul let out gritted screams. At the same time, the tip of the penis ground past his virgin prostate. <br />
<br />
If what Jon is saying is true, the real Jon won’t remember any of this. The only thing Dan could do is follow this charade, for the alternative is meaningless. Dan grabbed Paul by his waist and dragged him up and down, letting his dick penetrate like a battering ram inside and out of Jon’s warm squirming insides. If this is what the impostor wants, then at least Dan could make it hurt for him. <br />
<br />
At least, that’s what he thought.<br />
<br />
Every slap of skin against skin, Paul could see his abdomen deforming. Dan’s dick is so hard that every insertion meant he could see the outline of his penis appear embossed on his skin. <br />
<br />
It hurts so much… and it was so intoxicating. The two grunted in pain and moaned in pleasure. They screamed at the same time when Dan finally emptied his seed inside his little brother’s ass. They stared at the broken glass ceiling for what seemed to be hours. None dared to make a move.<br />
<br />
It was Paul who made the first push to tidy himself and go somewhere else.</p>
