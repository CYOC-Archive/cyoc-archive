<br />
It was a calm, cool, and quiet starlit night as Henry Amberhill took in a deep breath smelling the forest around him. He watched as his daughter, Effie, tapped her foot impatiently waiting for the time to strike as Henry put a hand on his daughter&#39;s shoulder as she stopped tapping her foot and sighed as he showed his daughter the time on his Rolex watch as the seconds counted down. When the second hand had finally moved past the hour marker, Henry Amberhill motioned for his men to start run around the house and form a perimeter. Meanwhile his secretary, Trisha, was making a sigil trap in the ground.<br />
<br />
Inside the house, Alyssa Kane had fallen asleep along with Lilith as she slept on her mother&#39;s shoulder. The pair had a long day of fun together with Alyssa and Rebecca being out from school for the week due to spring break. They had decided to finish the day watching the movie &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;. Eliana and Rebecca were getting equally drowsy but still awake as they watched Mary put a blanket over her sleeping daughter and granddaughter before giving them both a kiss on their foreheads.<br />
<br />
Rebecca stretched slowly she got up, noticed something move from outside the window. She looked again to see if she could spot what it was. An feeling of dread washing over her as a werewolf move outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, mom, I think there are werewolves outside.&quot; Rebecca whispered fearfully, shaking her mother&#39;s arm as Eliana now woke up.<br />
<br />
Eliana looked out through the window, squinting her eyes as she studied the inky darkness to see her daughter was right. There were werewolves surrounding her house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, wake them up, we&#39;ll probably need Lilith&#39;s help on this.&quot; Eliana said as Mary shook Lilith awake, in turn stirring Alyssa awake too.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on? Is it breakfast already?&quot; Lilith yawned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilith wake up, we have werewolves outside.&quot; Mary told her daughter as Lilith&#39;s eyes shot awake and Alyssa groggily rubbed her eyes to see her mother transform into her Solar Guardian Pluto form. Alyssa then quickly changed into her Solar Guardian Saturn form as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait here,&quot; Misery said, donning her plague mask as her ring glowed. &quot;I&#39;ll deal with them...in my own way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, stay close to the house, this might get dangerous.&quot; Eliana told the girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;ve been preparing for something like this.&quot; Alyssa quietly argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but it&#39;s just us right now. I want you to stay close to Rebecca and protect her, promise?&quot; Lilith said to her daughter as Misery was the farthest outside from the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise mom.&quot; Alyssa promised her mother.<br />
<br />
Mary, in her Misery form, stood patiently waiting for a werewolf to come towards her, as did Lilith and Eliana in her own werewolf form. Suddenly they heard running footsteps as a werewolf darted out from their right as Misery easily grabbed him and took him down. The spell of the dark wizard crushing the creature into an unrecognizable paste. Another few came out towards Eliana and Lilith as they began fighting the werewolves off.<br />
<br />
Along the tree line, the trio could see wereolves filtering in and out of the darkness, daring them to attack. Misery obliged the werewolf as a one tail kitsune woman suddenly jumped out from behind some bushes and said some words before landing her hand on the ground and Misery suddenly looked down to realize that she was in a sigil trap. Tilting her head, the wizard cast a spell, watching it rebound around her inside an invisible bubble. Despite the strength of the ring, Misery could not break through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Miss Kane, but I&#39;m afraid my employer wants to put you on the sidelines.&quot; The kitsune woman said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma! Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m coming!&quot; Alyssa called out as she ran off of the porch to try and come help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, no! Stay back it&#39;s too dangerous!&quot; Mary called out to Alyssa and Rebecca as their mothers were fighting off other werewolves. &quot;I just need a few moments. Stay clear.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kitsune woman&#39;s smirk grew wider, before faltering. The invisible force bubble held the dark wizard at bay. The dark wizards magic rebounding back, however, small cracks were beginning to form within the trap. They needed to move faster or a very angry and blood thirsty wizard would be free.<br />
<br />
Before Alyssa could go any further from their house, a gun shot suddenly fired in front of Alyssa startling her and making her jump back protecting Rebecca as best as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;ALYSSA!&quot; &quot;REBECCA!&quot; Lilith and Eliana both called out towards their daughters in worry as a woman with half shaved blonde hair, a lip piercing, and wearing a white tuxedo shirt, undone to show off her cleavage, and black suit pants with short black cowgirl boots walked over towards them while holding a gold plated .50 desert eagle in her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry ladies, I&#39;ll be sure to watch your daughters very carefully.&quot; Effie Amberhill sneered towards them.<br />
<br />
Lilith and Eliana fought off the werewolves retreating back towards the house to protect the girls before a large figure landed on the ground in front of them making them both fall on their backs as they looked up to see a large man with three claw marks over his left eye. He stood confidently between Effie and Eliana and Lilith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amberhill.&quot; Eliana growled through her teeth recognizing him immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please, why be so formal Eliana? After all, we&#39;ve known each other for some time now, just call me Henry. Still it&#39;s good to see you again.&quot; Henry Amberhill said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get neutered you bastard.&quot; Eliana hissed towards Henry who chuckles at that remark.<br />
<br />
Henry Amberhill now looked over towards Lilith who stood ready for a fight.<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven&#39;t properly met before....young lady, you would be....?&quot; Henry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Solar Guardian Pluto, and I&#39;m going to kick your ass before you hurt me or my daughter!&quot; Lilith declared in her Solar Guardian form.<br />
<br />
Henry chuckled again loudly as he now shifted into his werewolf form as he clothes stretched out showing off his impressive build and muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know why I&#39;m here Eliana. I&#39;m here to finish what I started all those years ago with Luca, making sure that the rest of his family is in the ground with him.&quot; Henry said in his werewolf voice as he now went to attack Lilith and Eliana.<br />
<br />
Eliana was putting up an impressive feat of strength with Lilith who backed her up the best she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to be in for a rude awakening soon here when my friends show up!&quot; Lilith said defiantly as Henry gave a hearty laugh at this.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you think your other so called &quot;Solar Guardian&quot; friends are coming, then you&#39;re wrong. This wasn&#39;t just some random attack, I planned this!&quot; Henry said as he fought off both women. &quot;I trapped your so-called adoptive magic mother, hired Dark Garden to keep your little friends busy, and I did it all under the noses of those Moreland fucks!&quot; Henry growled as Eliana and Lilth kept up their fight as best as they could. Lilith couldn&#39;t help but wonder how her Solar Guardian friends were doing at the moment.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Solar Guardian Mars was fighting against Sinister Carnation and her sickles while her husband, the Solar Sentinel, fought the Dark Watchman again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know why you two decided to attack on now on our date night, but this is the last time you ever ruin it for us!&quot; Solar Guardian Mars declared.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
Over at Jennifer Rolland&#39;s house, she as Solar Guardian Mercury was battling Malevolent Azalea whilst her cousin, Solar Guardian Sun, was fighting with Sorrow Orchid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you should really be doing this?&quot; Miranda asked her cousin who she knew to be pregnant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luckily for me, my Solar Guardian form doesn&#39;t affect my pregnancy. I just hope the others are doing alright if the other ones went after them.&quot; Jennifer hoped as she fought off Malevolent Azalea.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on you guys, this hardly seems fair!&quot; Solar Guardian Neptune shouted as she was fighting off both Void Dandelion and Bloody Dahlia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since when have you known Dark Garden to ever be fair?!&quot; Bloody Dahlia shouted as she and Void Dandelion fought her.<br />
<br />
It would&#39;ve been hard for Solar Guardian Neptune to do this alone, but luckily she had trained well with the others in time and had become one of the team&#39;s best fighters.<br />
<br />
&quot;But May, why are you Void Dandelion again? I thought you had gotten better?&quot; Neptune asked Void Dandelion who growled at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is....VOID DANDELION, NOT MAY!&quot; Void Dandelion said as she began hitting Neptune as hard as she could. &quot;That weakling can&#39;t help you Tess!&quot;<br />
<br />
Neptune blocked it as best as she could hoping she could connect with May Harring inside Void Dandelion again. Tess was the one who had been May&#39;s biggest supporter helping her go through psychological counseling. The two had become great friends and did almost everything together. Now she was just hoping she could break through to her friend again.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
Back at the farm house, Alyssa had been able to put up somewhat of a fight with Effie as she threw her metal edged rings at the girl who either dodged some of them, or caught a few of them and threw them back at the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m warning you right now, leave my home and family alone!&quot; Alyssa threatened towards Effie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m really scared,&quot; Effie said sarcastically. &quot;You don&#39;t know real fear yet kid, but I&#39;ll certainly show you.&quot; Effie said as she holstered her gun before her hands became werewolf claws and she clawed at Alyssa who backed up towards the house in fear with Rebecca trailing behind her.<br />
<br />
Effie at one point managed to swipe at Alyssa&#39;s leg, making it bleed as she fell onto the ground as she hollered in pain from the injury.<br />
<br />
&quot;ALYSSA!&quot; Mary, Lilith, Eliana, and Rebecca all shouted in panic seeing what had just happened to her.<br />
<br />
Rebecca felt something inside of her body suddenly snap as she looked up angrily at Effie, not realizing that fur was growing over her body and claws were coming out of her hands, and her face was transforming.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to leave my best friend, my sister, my mother, and all my family....ALONE!!!&quot; Rebecca shouted towards Effie as her werewolf form finally activated werewolf form and ran forwards to attacks Effie. Hitting Effie with an uppercut that sent the woman crashing into a tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit, looks like the baby finally hit puberty!&quot; Effie mocked Rebecca as she shifted into her own werewolf form and started attacking Rebecca whilst her mother and Lilith could only watch as they were still busy with Henry but getting worn out as he was putting up quite the fight. Unfortunately for Rebecca, her fight wasn&#39;t going as well, since she was not used to fighting in her werewolf form and was only attacking Effie in a fit of blind rage.<br />
<br />
Lilith and Eliana were getting exhausted by this point, Henry Amberhill was certainly no slouch. Both women couldn&#39;t remember the last time they had ever faced someone with Henry Amberhill&#39;s strength before. At this point, the two of them just wanted to go help their daughters, they didn&#39;t care how much Amberhill was beating on them, all they wanted was their daughters safe.<br />
<br />
Misery as well, try as she might, was helpless to do anything still trapped in the sigil by Trisha. The dark wizard holds on her sanity, the dark eyes of her mask focused on Trisha.<br />
<br />
 &quot;When this is over you&#39;ll BEG ME for death!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith and Eliana were both on one knee taking deep breaths at all of the energy they were exhausting. Lilith at this point wasn&#39;t sure how much longer she could keep it up, but she would certainly try. Eliana on the other hand was bruised and battered but nothing would keep her from keeping her daughter safe.<br />
<br />
Henry Amberhill circled around the exhausted women chuckling still at their determination.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just look at you two. It&#39;s pathetic is what it is. Both of you trying to protect your little pups. I read all about all of you.&quot; Henry Amberhill mocked as he now looked towards Lilith. &quot;The un-dead, raped mother who just wanted to raise her illegitimate child. You both should be dead alongside your predecessor Ezkekiel Kane. From what I&#39;ve seen, the apple doesn&#39;t fall too far from the tree with you or your daughter. You tenacious little fucks.&quot; Henry said as Lilith glowered at him as Alyssa equally stared daggers at him and Effie who kept Rebecca&#39;s head down on the ground with her foot.<br />
<br />
Henry then backhanded Lilith who fell to ground hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; Alyssa shouted. &quot;Lilith!&quot; Misery cried out at the same time towards her daughter.<br />
<br />
Lilith wasn&#39;t hurt too badly from the hit, but she could hardly stand any longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;All of this could&#39;ve been avoided Hoti, if you had just given me your land to begin with.&quot; Henry said as Eliana put threw any remaining punches she hand in him with Henry easily blocking them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your friends wouldn&#39;t be incapacitated, your daughter wouldn&#39;t be on the ground with my daughter&#39;s foot planted firmly on her face.&quot; Henry said as Effie crushed her foot against Rebecca&#39;s head with her gun aimed at Alyssa should she try anything.<br />
<br />
Eliana now threw both of her fists towards Henry who easily dodged before grabbing hold of both of her fists and crushing them as Henry pressured her onto one knee, even while she tried to remain standing. The pressure he was putting on her was eventually too much as he felt Eliana&#39;s strength leave her as she went down onto both her knees.<br />
<br />
Henry smiled as he saw Eliana now kneeling before him. Slapping Eliana a few times before pushing her onto the ground. Everyone from Henry&#39;s men from the teen girls, Lilith, Misery, and Trisha now watched to see what would happen next. Henry now cupped Eliana&#39;s chin in one hand as he locked eyes with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tired? Exhausted? Why don&#39;t you surrender? It will probably be good for both you and your daughter.&quot; Henry said leaning down towards her.<br />
<br />
Eliana spat in Henry&#39;s face before she replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will never surrender to you. I made a promise to Luca that I would protect our daughter and land. And I made the same promise to my best friend that I would protect her and her daughter no matter what. You can beat me up as many times as you want. But for all of them, I...will....never....surrender to you.&quot; Eliana said defiantly in heavy breaths.<br />
<br />
Henry Amberhill stood back up and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already knew that&#39;s what your answer would be. I just wanted to hear you say it. Now, when you go to hell, say hello to Luca for me.&quot; Henry said bearing his sharp fangs at Eliana as she stared ever defiantly at Henry.<br />
<br />
Lilith, Rebeca, and Alyssa, all tried in vain to get up to their feet, too exhausted to move. All they could do was watch helplessly seeing what they thought would be Eliana&#39;s end.<br />
<br />
Before Henry could strike her Eliana down, Henry, Eliana, Rebecca, Effie, and the rest of the werewolves coverered their ears from an ear piercing noise that seemed only able for them to hear.<br />
<br />
Henry Amberhill looked over to where the sound was coming from, surprised to see Connor Moreland standing there with a special dog whistle with Bob the Zebra demon, Jolie Deathflower, and Annie the Demon Queen of Sorrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, I&#39;m sorry Eliana and Rebecca, but I had to get Henry Amberhill&#39;s attention and this seemed like the best way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well. If it isn&#39;t Connor &#39;the cripple&#39; Moreland&quot; Henry scoffed. &quot;And you brought friends! An idiot demon, a crayon eating necromancer, and a nepo, spoiled queen of Hell. You really think this group of losers has any chance of taking me out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re here to deal with your daughter and pack. I&#39;m here to deal with you, personally.&quot; Connor said defiantly.<br />
<br />
Henry and Effie both heard this and couldn&#39;t help but let out loud laughs at this remark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...forgive me, you&#39;re actually serious. Well, if you&#39;ve come for your death Moreland, I&#39;ll gladly give it to you. I think it&#39;s high time you were reunited with your father.&quot; Henry said taking off what remained of the top of his outfit showing his muscular chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on then Moreland, come and fight me if you dare.&quot; Henry said bearing his fangs at Connor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dare.&quot; Connor said.</p>
