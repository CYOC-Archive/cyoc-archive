<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Daisy woke up, she was feeling really weird. Her whole body was tingling. When she opened her eyes, she would’ve expected everything, except what she was really looking at. Bars. Very high bars. What was going on? Daisy moved her legs and heard a crinkling. She looked down at herself. Her upper body was covered with a long childish pyjama top and her bottom with … A DIAPER? <br />
<br />
Daisy looked at her hands. They looked so small, so pudgy. As if they were the hands of a little toddler. Then it hit her. She looked around again. She was in a crib! She was a toddler! She couldn’t be older than 2!<br />
<br />
She tried to stand up. Her body felt so clumsy and weak, and it took longer than it should have. She managed to grab the bars of the crib and hold onto them. Her legs felt wobbly, and she didn’t know whether she could stand on her own without the bars as a support. The crib was so big, that it reached up to her chin. She knew, there was clearly no escape from this. <br />
<br />
Julie, where was Julie? Daisy looked around. Right next to hers, there was another crib. Inside was laying an even smaller girl, looking to be about 1 year old. She was wearing a pink onesie. The thick diaper was clearly visible beneath it. <br />
<br />
“Juwie, Juwie!” Daisy screamed, getting startled at the sound of her own voice. It was so high, so childish, no, babyish even! <br />
“Juwie, is thith you?!” she continued, having to blush at the sound of the lisp she couldn’t control. <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Julie slowly opened her eyes. Everything was so bright, and she needed time to adjust. Then she heard a voice. A toddler was trying to call her name. She remembered. Together with her friend Daisy, she had applied for a job at “Toys and Tots”. She had to be there still. That would explain the toddler screaming.<br />
<br />
Her vision was getting more passable, and she managed to open her eyes a little further. She was looking up to the ceiling. Around her, she could see bars. Very high up bars. With great effort, she rolled around and sat up slowly. Why was she feeling so weak? <br />
<br />
A crinkling reached her ears when she moved. She looked down to where it came from. The only thing she saw, was some chubby little legs and her crotch, covered behind a thick layer of fabric. Her whole body was covered in pink. Those legs didn’t look like hers! She looked at her fingers. Just as small, just as chubby! She moved them. It looked clumsily. What was wrong with her?<br />
<br />
Then Julie had a look around again. She was sitting now, but the bars still looked incredibly high. Was this a crib she was in? From the perspective of a baby? <br />
<br />
“Pwease Juwie, say somefing! It’th me, Daisy!”<br />
Julie looked to her left. In a crib right next to hers, there was a toddler standing at the bars, calling her name. This was Daisy? She had been turned into a child as well? <br />
“Dadi?” <br />
Julie almost choked. Had that been her? No way that was her voice!<br />
“Wababi wah bab du?” she tried to say. <br />
She started to panic. She couldn’t talk anymore! She was a baby! <br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
Daisy couldn’t understand a thing that baby was saying. She tried to think. <br />
“Juwie if that ith you, nod your head” she told the little girl. <br />
Julie paused for a second, then she nodded her head up and down. <br />
“Wook, I don’t know where we are or whad habbend, but we should twy to stay cawm. Can you stand up?” Daisy said. <br />
Julie was still very confused, but she decided to listen. <br />
“Aba do…” she started, but then remembered, that her friend couldn’t understand her baby babble. <br />
<br />
Instead, she tried to get up from her sitting position. She crawled the short distance to the wall that was closest to Daisy, before she concentrated all her force into her legs, clamped her hands onto the bars and tried to pull herself up. She almost managed to fully stand, when she noticed how her legs couldn’t hold her anymore and she fell down onto her thickly padded butt. <br />
<br />
Daisy, still standing in her crib, looked down to her. Julie blushed. She couldn’t talk, she couldn’t stand, she had become a true baby. <br />
“A … aga” she said and crawled closer to the wall made of bars again. She reached her hand out. <br />
<br />
Daisy watched curiously. Although she was small herself, it felt good in a way, to be at least the bigger one of them both. Daisy knelt down and reached her hand out as well. Between the cribs was a small gap. Luckily small enough, so the girls could touch each other’s hands. <br />
<br />
“Everyfing wiww be okay, we wiww figure somfing out” Daisy tried to encourage Julie. <br />
Julie nodded. Daisy’s hand felt so big to her. They were just holding each other’s hands for a little longer, thinking for themselves in almost utter silence, only an occasional crinkle from one of their diapers was audible, when one of them moved, before Daisy continued. <br />
<br />
“We haff to see how to commumigade. Cummunigage. Com – mun – ni – gate.” She made a pause. What a hard word. She saw Julie just smiling at her. “Say my name Juwie.” <br />
Daisy! Daisy! Julie repeated in her head. Then she concentrated and spoke it out loud. <br />
“Dadi!” <br />
Daisy giggled. “Okay, I’m Dadi fwom now on.” <br />
Julie had to blush. This was so embarrassing. <br />
“If you need my addenshun, just say Dadi, okie?” <br />
All Julie could do was nod. So she did. <br />
Daisy thought for another second. Could they make codewords? Things Julie would be able to say? Like baba or gaga? But what would those codewords be for? Her thoughts were interrupted. <br />
<br />
“Dadi?” Julie said with her eyes wide open.</p>
