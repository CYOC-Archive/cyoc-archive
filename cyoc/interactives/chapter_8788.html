<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power – Ty shows Drakkenfyre some REAL magic – by scriptboy<br />
<br />
Dustin got up and answered the door as soon as he heard the doorbell ring. He came face to face with a tall, young man wearing a three-piece suit and holding a large suitcase in his right hand. “Good evening Sir. My name is Drakkenfyre. John D. Drakkenfyre. I have some cool products I would like to show you. Maybe you’ll find something that you might find interesting, this evening?” Dustin thought for a moment and realized that he had the time to listen to what the salesman had to offer. “Sure, come in.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Drakkenfyre sat down in the chair, while Dustin sat in the other chair next to them. There was a square coffee table in front of them, and they were facing the couch. Ty had just come down the stairs from doing homework, and he noticed that Dustin had a guest. He walked up to the gentleman and introduced himself. “Hi, I’m Tyler!” he said, as he shook his hand. “I’m pleased to meet you, young man. I’m John D. Drakkenfyre, at your service.” Ty sat down on the couch opposite Mr. Drakkenfyre.<br />
<br />
First, Mr. Drakkenfyre pulled a large plastic box out of the bag. “I have here a cool plastic box, with a strong lid. It can hold up to a dozen turkey sandwiches and they’ll fresh for a long time!” Dustin grabbed hold of the box. “Ryan would love that!” Ty chuckled. <br />
<br />
Next, Mr. Drakkenfyre pulled out a long, white box. He opened it on the top, and pulled out a white, plastic tube. Then he pulled out several metallic bars, which form a tripod when fully assembled. “For the scientist in the household, I have here a cool astronomical reflector telescope! It is great for viewing the moon and the starts at night!” Ty looked through the eyepiece of the telescope, when Dustin remarked “That’s something Peter would like! Why don’t you run up and get him?” “Alright, hang on!” Ty said, as he ran up the stairs. Just then Ryan came out of the kitchen, and looked at the plastic box.<br />
<br />
The desk was covered with papers, notebooks, and a very large math book. Peter was working on a math problem while he was writing some Visual Basic code on the laptop computer, when Ty quietly walked in the room. The room definitely did not look like that of a Transformation Master; rather it looked one that belonged to a very busy high school student! Peter had just learned how to make his first program, and he was trying to make something to help him with his math problem. <br />
<br />
“Hey cousin, you should come downstairs and meet Mister Drakkenfyre! He’s got some cool stuff to show us!” Ty said to Peter. “Alright, I need to take a break from math anyway!” Peter said. He got up from the chair, and grabbed a little box from his desk. “Hey Ty, take a look at this…” he said, as he opened the box, which revealed the Ring of Transformations. “Wow, it’s beautiful!” Ty said, as Peter showed him the ring. “Come on, let’s go…” Ty said, as he hurried down the stairs, with Peter coming close behind.<br />
<br />
“Hello young man, I’m John D. Drakkenfyre!” he said, as he shook Peter’s hand. Peter sat down on the couch next to Ryan and Ty, as he admired the telescope.<br />
<br />
“And now, for the person who likes to cook, I have a waffle toaster!” Drakkenfyre said, as he pulled out the round device that opens up. “You pour the waffle mix in here, you plug it in, and after a few minutes, you’ll get a home made waffle!” he said, as he handed the device to Dustin. <br />
<br />
“Lastly, I have something that the entire family will enjoy!” Drakkenfyre said, taking a large, red box out of the suitcase. He opened the box and revealed a deck of cards, a hat, a black want, and a small napkin. “This is a magic set! This is for the magician in the family!”<br />
<br />
Ty looked at Peter, and they both started to laugh out loud! Dustin looked at Ryan, and both of them had their jaws wide open, as they rolled their eyes almost at the same time. “Oh no, just what we need… More magic in this house!” Dustin grumbled. Drakkenfyre looked at the two laughing boys and began to wonder why they thought it was so funny that he tried to sell them the magic set. <br />
<br />
“Mister Drakkenfyre, you see… Well, my boys are like…. Ummm” Dustin began to explain. “We got magical transformation powers!” Ty said out loud. Drakkenfyre just looked at him in astonishment for a minute, and then looked at Dustin in disbelief. “Oh come on, my boy, there is no such thing…”<br />
<br />
Peter and Ty turned towards each other. They telepathically decided what they would do next and who would do what. Then Peter looked at the magic set, while Ty looked at Mister Drakkenfyre.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Drakkenfyre began to levitate in the air, just above the chair he was sitting on! At first he was sitting, and then his body stretched out completely, while he was hovering in the living room. “Oh no…” Dustin groaned, as he put his hand over his eyes, “I knew this was going to happen!” Drakkenfyre began to tremble with fear. “What… is… this??? What… is… going… on… here??” he screamed, as his body suddenly flipped over, and he was suspended in the upside-down position!<br />
<br />
The entire deck of cards burst out of the box, and all the cards lined up in rows on the coffee table. Then they all began to bounce around the table, all at the same time, like they were members of a marching band!<br />
<br />
Drakkenfyre tried to reach out his arm as he attempted to grab hold of his chair. Ty frowned when he saw that, and suddenly the poor man’s arms stretched all the way to the floor, while his legs stretched out and were stuck to the ceiling! Ty made him stretchy!<br />
<br />
The black hat popped out of the box, and suddenly a rabbit hopped out of the hat! Next, the cards leapt in the hat, one by one. After a few seconds, pop corn started popping out of the hat, covering the entire living room floor with fresh, warm, buttery popcorn!<br />
<br />
Drakkenfyre was screaming for help, as he hung there, suspended from the ceiling! All the sudden, he couldn’t speak anymore, for it seemed like his body began to inhale a large quantity of air, as his torso inflated and expanded like a balloon!<br />
<br />
Lastly, the cards appeared again, jumping out of the hat. They all neatly lined up and formed walls and floors on the coffee table. After a few moments, they constructed a house of cards on the table, all on their own!<br />
<br />
When Drakkenfyre was filled with air to the max, the air suddenly began to blow through his mouth, forcing him to fly around the living room in a big, wide circle, until all the air had escaped out of his body! The poor guy tumbled on the floor; he was sweaty, panting, and exhausted! Dustin quickly came to help him on his feet, as the poor guy was trembling. Then when he looked over at the coffee table and saw what had happened to his cards and his magic set, he began to shake even more!<br />
<br />
“What kind of a place is this? I’m getting out of here!” Drakkenfyre said nervously. Then Dustin calmly walked up to him, with his checkbook in his hand. “Don’t worry; we’ll gladly purchase everything you had shown us tonight. How much do I owe you?”<br />
<br />
Drakkenfyre calmed down as he sat down and figured out the total with his calculator. He gave Dustin the paper with the amount, and Dustin wrote out a check. While Drakkenfyre stood at the door, waiting for Dustin, Ty and Peter walked up to him. <br />
<br />
“Whaaaah!!! You two get AWAY from me!! You scared me to death!!” he said, as he began to tremble with fear once more. But, this time Peter and Ty were very friendly towards him, as they tried to calm his fears.<br />
<br />
“We’re sorry, Mister Drakkenfyre! We didn’t want to hurt you! We just wanted to have some fun!” Peter said calmly. “That counts for me too, Mister Dragonfire!” Ty said. <br />
<br />
“The name is Drakkenfyre, my boy. I must say, you guys definitely put on a magic show for me! That was amazing!” he said, feeling somewhat calmer now. Peter shook Drakkenfyre’s hand, and the Ty. “You have some cool stuff, Mister Drakkenfyre! Please come back again some time!” Peter said a minute later.<br />
<br />
“I like the plastic thing!” Ryan said, holding the box in his hands. “I really liked the telescope!” Peter shouted. “And I will definitely use the waffle thing!” Ty said, showing his left hand with the waffle impression on it. It brought a huge smile to Drakkenfyre’s face, and he was no longer afraid to come over anymore.<br />
<br />
Dustin handed Drakkenfyre the check, as Ty opened the door. “Gentlemen, thank you very much! It has been a very amusing evening!” Drakkenfyre said to Dustin and the boys. “I work a lot with hospitals and orphanages, maybe one of your magic boys could come over and give a show for the sick children or the orphans?” he asked Dustin.<br />
<br />
“Sure, we can arrange that!” Dustin replied. “They’ll love to do some volunteer work as long as it’s for a good cause!”<br />
<br />
Drakkenfyre left the house, feeling relieved. Not only had he made a big sale, but he has made some cool friends in the process. And Dustin, Ty, Peter and Ryan knew that they would definitely hear more of John D. Drakkenfyre!</p>
