<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Mommy…Daddy.” Cried the little six-year-old boy Luke as he looked around his home, everything had changed and he didn’t know why. A strange woman with black fur on her legs was standing by the front door, that door was now made of large wooden slabs and black iron bands. Another women who was tall and dressed in bright shinny armor stood by the window, she had wings was she an angel. A monster lizard man sat against a wall by the downstairs bathroom. He made him afraid, lizard monsters where the bad guys in a lot of the cartoons he watched. In the other corner a tall woman with dark red skin and horns was getting up, strange magic dancing around one of her hands. She was clearly a bad guy; she was a devil from the H…E…double hockey sticks place.<br />
<br />
The rest of his home had changes, the walls where stone or made from wood, gone where the painted walls or the drywall daddy complained about replacing the one time the dog ran so hard into the wall chasing a ball it busted. Where was his dog, where was Tony. He looked and saw that where Tony had been a much larger beast now sat as he looked around confused. It was still a dog but now it had large curved teeth sticking out of his mouth and the golden fur was on fire but it gave off no heat and wasn’t catching anything on fire. <br />
The carpet was gone, replaced by stone with large animal skins placed over it. The photos on the wall had changed, where a photo of his big sister Jane hung in nice dress instead was a photo of that devil women in a still nice but different dress. A football photo of his brother Sam had been replaced with that lizard man holding a gun up with a badge that said 1st place target shooting. The wedding photo of his mom and dad was gone and instead showed that black fur antlered women in a suit beside that angle women in the flowing dress of white and silver. Then he saw his own school photo. <br />
<br />
He remembered that day because it was only a few weeks back, he had lost a tooth and so he had a large gap in his teeth and so did the image on figure in the photo. Only instead of wearing a red shirt and shorts, the person in the photo was wearing a red shirt and no pants. Instead from the waste down the figure had the body of a brown horse. <br />
<br />
He looked down and saw that his shirt had changed, it felt different and instead of having a character from his favorite show it had a the saying “mommy’s little stallion” He looked down and saw that his legs where covered in fur and he had hooves, he turned around and saw he had another pair of legs and a horses but.<br />
<br />
“MOMMY!!! DADDY!!!” he cried as all eyes shot toward him.<br />
<br />
What they saw was a little centaur boy standing in the middle of the living room, tears rolling down his face. <br />
<br />
“Luke!” said the Angel as she came forward.<br />
<br />
“Lady where is my mommy and why am I a pony?” inquired Luke as the Angel looked behind her toward the antlered lady. <br />
<br />
“I told you we should have explained what was happening.” Said the lizard man<br />
<br />
“Shut up Sam, not now.” Snapped the Devil women<br />
<br />
“Sam…that is my brother’s name.” said Luke<br />
<br />
“Luke…honey…something has happened to the world and things, well people changed.” Said the Angel women. “I am your mommy, just like you I have changed so has everyone else.”<br />
<br />
“My mommy is an angel so did I die?” inquired Luke<br />
<br />
“No…of course not son.” Said the antler women “We will have to figure everything out but it’s me Daddy.”<br />
<br />
“Daddy?” inquired Luke as he looked toward the lizard man<br />
<br />
“It’s your big brother.” Answered Sam before Luke looked at the devil women<br />
<br />
“And I am your big sister.” Answered Jane<br />
<br />
Luke seamed nothing but confused and he lied down, it took him a few moments to figure out how. Lisa bent down and picked up her centaur son who was trying to process everything, she held him close as she sat down on the couch which still looked somewhat the same.<br />
Everyone was trying to process what had just happened as everyone eyed themselves and each other. They took turns heading to the mirror to get a look of themselves and it was hard to process.<br />
 <br />
“So what do we do now?” inquired Jane <br />
<br />
“I don’t know.” Said Mike as he well she looked at her outfit, straps of leather over a pair of breasts. “I hope there is something more covering upstairs in our room. If the whole world changed then everything we had should have had well.”<br />
<br />
“True.” Said Jane before laughing a bit. “However what was all those words about covering up and dressing more modesty, I am more modest then you at this moment.”<br />
<br />
“Young lady.” Started Mike before she laughed as well shaking his head. “I guess I can’t really call you young lady, we are about the same age now. You look to be around 20 and I am only 25 or so, hard to call you young lady and have it mean anything.”<br />
<br />
“This is one strange world.” Added Sam as he and everyone minus Lisa and Luke looked toward the stairs wondering what was waiting for them for them upstairs in their rooms and the rest of the house and world. One sign that maybe things weren’t all going to be strange Jane’s black cat Storm was sitting on the staircase and she seamed perfectly normal. Then she disappeared in a small puff of smoke and reappeared at Jane’s feet rubbing herself against the new she devils skin. <br />
<br />
Well maybe normal would be asking for too much.</p>
