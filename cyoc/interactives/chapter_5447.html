<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kelvin guiltily jerked his fingers out of the box ignoring the tingling he felt in his fingers He cursed himself under his breath, hardly the way to meet a potential client. He put the box down as his giant host stepped properly into the room. Kelvin felt himself dwarfed by the man, and at 6’ 7” that did not happen to him often; the guy dominated the room, Kelvin’s dick continued to get hard. He stuck out one of his big hands.<br />
“Kelvin Orcan” he said trying to banish his nerves. For a second Kelvin thought the big guy would not respond, then he did taking and swamping Kelvin’s hand in his own.<br />
“Tim Dane” he said, his voice cutting right to Kelvin’s soul. He’d not felt this way since….well ever……what was happening?<br />
<br />
<br />
Tim started when he saw Kelvin had his fingers in the box, he couldn’t decide weather to warn, grab, or hug him all at once. The Stranger was defiantly Tim’s type, big, burly, and hairy; he’d have preferred dark hair, but…he gave a mental shrug….if the fur fits. <br />
<br />
A hand came towards him and Tim took a sec to recognise the gesture, it seems so normal after everything that had happened to him today. He took the hand and was somewhat surprised when his hand swamped Kelvin’s, he still could not believe his own size. <br />
“What brings you out here?” Tim said he was trying not to undress Kelvin with his eyes. <br />
“I am starting a contracting company specializing in restoration of older homes” Kelvin had not put the box down and continued to caress the fourth jewel “I know yards like yours often got things from older homes that could be reused. I came to see if we can set up some sort of deal” Tim nodded, made sense.<br />
“Wanna coffee?” he asked. Kelvin smiled. <br />
“Sure” he said. <br />
“Through here” Tim turned and went out through the door, remembering to duck this time, as he went he breathed a sigh as he heard the box go down onto the table. In the kitchen he stuck on Hank’s old kettle and grabbed two mugs form the dryer, as he did they both smashed into pieces.<br />
“Shit” he cried. He didn’t know his own strength anymore, he chucked the pieces away and more carefully he grabbed a couple more. <br />
<br />
<br />
As Tim made up some coffee Kelvin was impressed, had that show of strength been for his benefit as a warning not to cross him? And how did Tim heat his old place like this? He felt flushed and hot, his gut ached. As they went back into the living room the feeling got worse, was he ill or something?<br />
“Good yard” he said to cover the silence. His fingers twitched towards the box but he didn’t grab it. <br />
“It’s ok.” Tim replied “keeps me busy” Tim swept up the box.<br />
“Been yours long?” <br />
“No. I inherited it”<br />
“From your brother?” Kelvin nodded at the picture. Tim followed his gaze<br />
“Er……yes. Left it me in his will” he nodded; he couldn’t explain the box, not yet.<br />
“Do you get much in terms of clearance stuff? “ Kelvin’s dick had gone completely hard in the kitchen and now they were sitting he leaned forward to try and hide it He hoped he didn’t come across as to pushy or nosy. <br />
“Yeah loads, it’s our main business. We got this in today” Tim brandished the box. <br />
“I was urm….looking at that earlier. What is it?” <br />
<br />
Tim smiled at Kelvin, even if the big man could not feel it yet Tim could see slow changes happening to him; the boner in his pants was growing for a start; his arms were hairier than when he shook Kelvin’s hand and his gut was bigger. Why it was happening slower Tim didn’t know something the box did?<br />
“I am still finding out” Tim said neutrally “there are these gems and they have little symbols on. Then there are these keys, now I tried this key and it seems to correspond to this gemstone” Tim pointed out the fourth gem “I think you spotted that too?” Kelvin blushed a little at being caught and started to sweat heavily.<br />
“Er…yes…I felt draw to the box somehow, so I opened it when you were showering. Please forgive me” Tim smiled wide, his slightly larger canines making the smile almost predatory, he could feel his dick starting to harden.<br />
“No problem” he said deeply “I think that we can defiantly do business together” <br />
<br />
“Pardon?” Kelvin said. He was feeling rather ill; he was hot, sweaty, his jeans didn’t seem to fit properly, they were getting tight round his butt and thighs. His boner was hurting, pushing painfully against the teeth of his fly. <br />
“I said I think we are going to be good friends” Kelvin couldn’t concentrate, his vision was swimming, he felt heavy. He tried to stand<br />
“I think I should go” he slurred the room wavering in and out. His host stood too, Kelvin was sure he could see a Bear, a huge Grizzly standing there next to him his nose filled with the smell of fur…..he collapsed.<br />
<br />
As Kelvin began to stand Tim could sense the change, Kelvin gut was bigger making his shirt stretch across it. Through the holes between buttons Tim could see the fur thickening on Kelvin’s growing chest and gut. As Kelvin pulled himself upright the teeth on his fly began to unzip and the head of a thickening member popped out, the cloth it was encased in soaked with manly sweat. Tim drank in the smell of the changing man, his vision seemed to swim a bit, his dick expanded to full hardness… and he changed.<br />
<br />
The overalls popped on the shoulder straps as his big shoulders grew outward, his chest barrelled and his gut seemed to thicken pushing the folded denim down and under it. Golden brown fur raced all over his body. His cock pressed heavily into the denim but the overalls held against his thickening hips and butt. Tim grew taller, the overalls shredding up the calves and thighs like the Hulks pants. Tim’s face pushed out into its ursine muzzle, the feel of his fangs growing and his nose expanding to drink even more of Kelvin’s musk nearly sent Tim to his knees, he forced himself to start upright and even as his ears moved and rounded themselves on his head he reached out and grabbed the falling, changing Kelvin, now his Bear brother.</p>
