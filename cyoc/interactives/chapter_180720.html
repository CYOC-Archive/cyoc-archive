<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A day passed since Holly gave birth to her son Peter and got separated from him and her husband Tom due to the Silver Lake turning them into mermen. In a sense, the next day passed like a dizzying blur.<br />
<br />
Through the morning and afternoon, she spent hours applying to jobs, answering phone calls from Tom&#39;s co-workers on why he wasn&#39;t at work today, and making endless excuses on where was her child since her pregnant belly was gone. She had to keep lying, to hide the fact her son was a merboy, and it was really exhausting by the time evening came around.<br />
<br />
Yet, she still breathed a sigh of relief as she saw the beautiful sunset sky on the horizon. She walked around the beach in her bikini and found a perfect spot that seemed to have nobody within eyesight.<br />
<br />
Upon finding a good spot on the shore, she then proceeded to calmly walk in the water. She closed her eyes and smiled as she answered the sea that was calling to her. Suddenly, something grabbed her from below the water and pulled her under. <br />
<br />
Holly yelped in surprise as her head went beneath the surface. Something had their hands on their shoulders, wrapping around her legs to prevent her from kicking.<br />
<br />
Then she was being kissed on the lips and tickled on her belly. Holly thrashed about even harder as bubbles escaped from her mouth as she laughed. She reached out and pinched whatever was holding her, and she was immediately released.<br />
<br />
Breaking the surface, Holly coughed as she caught her breath. Pushing her blonde hair aside, Holly saw a familiar head with glowing blue eyes looking at her in amusement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom!&quot; she cried in mock outrage. &quot;You know I hate stuff like that! Especially after you got me to watch that shark movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly tried to scowl at him but was unable to keep up the annoyed act, not with her finally meeting her husband again. She grabbed Tom and showed him with a flurry of kisses, from his face to his cobblestone abs.<br />
<br />
Tom couldn&#39;t help but smirk at this. He lovingly returned her embrace, his muscular tail wrapping around his wife&#39;s rather petite legs, and gave Holly one long kiss to her mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to see you, too.&quot; He said with a playful grin.<br />
<br />
The two looked at each other for a minute before Holly spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s Peter doing, honey?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s doing wonderful, dear,&quot; Tom said with a warm smile. &quot;He&#39;s really getting used to swimming with his tail. He even tried to help me when it came to opening up the exit point. Of course, Peter has a tiny body and couldn&#39;t do much but he&#39;s already showing potential.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww!&quot; Holly gushed. &quot;That&#39;s so adorable! By the way, where is Peter? I want to see him again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s currently in the cave, sleeping at the bottom of a lake,&quot; Tom answered. &quot;I make a little sea bed for him. If you want, we could with meet him later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Holly said, tilting her head. &quot;What do you want to do now?&quot; She said, putting her head on her head. Deep inside, she already knew the answer but she wanted to revel in it.<br />
<br />
Tom looked at his wife, finding himself growing excited. He had this feeling before and quashed it but now he felt his biological response spelling it out for him, he wanted to put his new muscular body to good use. <br />
<br />
&quot;I… I want to have sex with you. Right here and right now.&quot; Tom said bluntly.<br />
<br />
It was Holly&#39;s turn to grin. &quot;That all I needed to hear, Tom.&quot;<br />
<br />
The merman promptly undid his wife&#39;s bikini bottom, tossing it aside with one arm while rubbing his hands on Holly&#39;s soft skin on the other. Holly returned the caresses and ran her hands down his back.<br />
<br />
Holly shivered with excitement as her hands passed from his skin to his scales. As Tom kept her afloat with his light blue tail caressing her inner thighs, Tom reached around his torso and began to rub below his waistline. <br />
<br />
She soon found what she had been looking for. Beneath a sheath of scales, she felt Tom&#39;s cock emerge. As she rubbed it, she was awestruck by its long length, being at least 10 inches long. Then she realized it would have to be long to find its target in the tail of a mermaid. Holly gulped at the idea that cock going inside her.<br />
<br />
The small fins on the sides of the merman&#39;s aquatic sex organ flapped in anticipation as it grew longer and longer until its tip was just barely touching the opening of her womanhood.<br />
<br />
Tom looked at Holly with an expression that said &quot;May I?&quot; and Holly soon nodded with desiring eyes that answered, &quot;You may.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly moaned as she lowered herself onto Tom&#39;s dick, taking as much as she could. Tom put his arms around his wife and kissed her hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom, mph! I.. I love you.&quot; She moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I love you too,&quot; Tom answered as he thrust his penis into Holly&#39;s ready opening.<br />
<br />
Holly gasped, and then again as she felt another thrust and another. Before long, Tom was humping his wife with abandon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harder... Tom...&quot; Holly moaned, out feeling her whole body quiver with an orgasm building, &quot;Harder!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure…&quot; Tom moaned back and doubled his efforts and feeling his penis being to twitch inside her vagina. The merman began groping Holly&#39;s breasts, eliciting another moan from his human partner.<br />
<br />
They kept at it as Tom could feel pleasure building, particularly as Holly did her best to lay kisses not only on his lips but on his neck and upper chest and shoulders while rubbing her hands on his pecs.<br />
<br />
Holly arched her back, eyes closed, and moaned, &quot;Ohhh, this feels sooo good!&quot; Her toes beginning to curl up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost there...&quot; Tom managed to grunt as he gazed into Holly&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
Holly tried to gaze back, but her eyes fluttered a little bit as their passions had built, her orgasm was coming in, with Tom&#39;s mermadic penis beginning to twitch as his own climax was coming.<br />
<br />
Holly thrust her hips forward and tried to pull as much of Tom&#39;s penis into her as she could before their hips soon touched.<br />
<br />
With that, Tom and Holly climaxed. The two let out huge moans of pure pleasure as Tom felt something hot and sticky race up the length of his cock and into Holly&#39;s vagina, his seed filling up her womb.<br />
<br />
Holly drooled as she fell back and released herself, with a trail of white appearing from below the water line, coming from the merman&#39;s released penis.<br />
<br />
She would have fallen and hit herself in the water if Tom hadn&#39;t caught her back and brought his wife into a soft embrace, likely the devout Christian in Tom subtly re-emerging to comfort his wife after such a beautiful act of a human woman and merman becoming one in flesh and scales.<br />
<br />
Holly dreamily smiled as it truly processed in her mind - She officially had sex with a real-life merman, a merman who was her husband no less! <br />
<br />
No doubt that her recent fling was likely going to get her pregnant again. Most likely with Peter ending up with a school of siblings if the couple continued making love but she didn&#39;t care. <br />
<br />
She loved Tom deeply, and he shared those feelings back, more than willing to give him more kids if it means her descendants would explore the deep blue sea without a suit.<br />
<br />
While he may not be able to provide direct income as he did with his auto shop job, Tom was at least willing to stick by her side and raise her special merboy. <br />
<br />
The couple hoped Peter would turn out fine, even if his two parents are separated by land and water.<br />
<br />
After what felt like an eternity, the two finally let go from their embrace and looked at each other face to face.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do we do, now?&quot; Holly asked</p>
