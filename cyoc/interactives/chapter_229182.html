<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Alright, we have something we need to talk to you both about.” Explained Brianna as she sat on the foot rest while her children sat on the couch. Behind her stood her wife Stacy, the windows shades had been drawn so no one could see into the room, and everyone’s phone was sitting on the kitchen table so no one could record it. <br />
<br />
“I did nothing wrong.” Stated Josh, the 14-year-old young man sat with his arms crossed, he looked a lot like his abusive father had been at his age however he had his mother’s blonde hair and bright blue eyes. Only an hour ago, he had stood up to his father who had illegally tried to make contact with him with the help of an religious teacher who didn’t like Josh had two moms.<br />
<br />
“Wrong…” laughed Stacy “I don’t think I have ever been prouder of you.” <br />
<br />
“Thanks mom.” Said Josh with a smile, Stacy had come into his life when he was 4 and while she didn’t want to force a parental relationship on him one had developed either way. <br />
<br />
“What we have to tell you, is going to change our lives.” Stated Stacy<br />
<br />
“Am I going to be a big sister?” asked Stacy’s biological daughter Emily. Emily had been born thanks to artificial insemination using Stacy’s eggs and Brianna’s twin brother who was a happy married gay men who lived across the country. <br />
<br />
“No.” stated Brianna as she looked at Stacy, “Show them.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Said Stacy as she paused and looked at her kids. “Don’t freak out, I am still me.”<br />
<br />
Stacy messed with her necklace as the spell holding her human spell intact without her focusing on it. With that disability, her body began to shift. She grew a little bit, only about two inches or so. Her muscle mass increased as well; her breasts grew a bit but that was harder to tell the sweatshirt she had on. White fur with tiger strips appeared over her body, in the light of the room Brianna got a better look at the pattern than she had in the bedroom. She really loved the pattern. Stacy’s face changed a bit to take on a more feline look.<br />
<br />
“I am a were-tiger.” explained Stacy<br />
<br />
“Is this even possible?” inquired Josh<br />
<br />
“It is.” stated Stacy “I have always been a were-tiger, but something has come up and…”<br />
<br />
“It is just like my dream.” stated Emily as Stacy, Brianna and Josh all looked at her. She looked like a dead ringer of Brianna thanks to her brother’s DNA but she did have the pitch black hair of Stacy. <br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Stacy<br />
<br />
“I have been having dream where I am a cat but walking on human legs.” stated Emily as Brianna looked at Stacy.<br />
<br />
“You said Emily was a were-cat but didn’t know it.” Inquired Brianna <br />
<br />
“I know, but I never heard of a child unknowing dreaming that they are a were-cat.” explained Stacy <br />
<br />
“So I am a were-cat?” inquired the 8 year old girl.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Stacy as she sat down on the coffee table, before looking at Josh and Brianna. “Don’t worry, you two will be were-cats as well soon. I have been recalled.”<br />
<br />
“Recalled?” inquired Josh<br />
<br />
“Basically, we are likely moving.” Explained Brianna “We are going to go meet with Stacy and her pride and see why she has been recalled, either way we will all become were-cats.”<br />
<br />
“Good.” Stated Josh “I am sick of that school attacking you two.”<br />
<br />
“I want to be a were-cat.” Stated Emily “Can I become one now?”<br />
<br />
“I can awaken your true form. We can’t let people know that were-cats and other were-creatures are real.” Explained Stacy as she looked at her daughter. “You understand, you can’t tell anyone about this.”   <br />
<br />
“I understand.” Stated Emily in a very happy tone.<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Stated Stacy “Be right back.”<br />
<br />
She went back into the bedroom and came back with a smaller copy of the same necklace she wore.<br />
<br />
“This contains the spell that will allow you to appeal human, however I linked it to my necklace so I control when you can and can’t appeal as a were tiger.” Explained Stacy<br />
<br />
“Alright, mom, that is fine.” Stated Emily as Stacy reached out and put the necklace around her daughter’s neck. All eyes where on her as she channeled some magic between the necklace her daughter now had on and her own. <br />
<br />
Emily shifted a bit.<br />
<br />
“I feel warm.” Stated Emily as she grew a little bit taller as orange fur began to grow around her face. Soon it was join with black strips and some white. Her face shifted into a more cat like as claws appeared on her hands. She shifted a bit allowing her new tail to grow out.<br />
<br />
“Wow…” said Emily “Just like I dreamed it.”<br />
<br />
“You look just like your grandmother.” Stated Stacy “I get my white coloring from my great grandmother.”<br />
<br />
“You look beautiful.” Stated Brianna as she hugged her daughter.<br />
<br />
“Lucky, I want to be one.” Stated Josh<br />
<br />
“Well you may well become a tiger, but who knows you and your mom could become any of a many different types of were-cats.” Stated Stacy “Either way, come tomorrow we will be a were-cat family.”</p>
