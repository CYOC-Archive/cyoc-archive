<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
&quot;Bullshit!&quot; said Todd a little nervously.<br />
<br />
Kat began to sing softly and Danielle looked at her with confusion.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Just play along, &quot; whispered Kat into her ear, then resumed her song.  Danielle joined her, doing her best to imitate her song.<br />
<br />
Todd got a strange dazed look on his face, as if hypnotized.  He shook his head to clear it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop that!&quot; said Todd angrily and began to approach the girls in the pool.  They quickly swam away to the far end of the pool and continued their odd song.  Todd followed, smiling evilly as he cornered them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nowhere left to run now, bitch,&quot; said Todd with a smile.  &quot;What are you going to do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat smiled.  &quot;Me?  Oh nothing.  I was just trying to distract you - for her,&quot; said Kat pointing behind him.<br />
<br />
He turned to find Rachel on the pool deck glaring at him.  He had been so focused on Kat and Danielle that he failed to notice her sneaking up behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eat my tail, asshole, &quot; said Rachel angrily as she slapped him hard with her powerful tail.<br />
<br />
Todd&#39;s knees buckled and he fell into the pool.  Susan was waiting below and held him down under the water.  He struggled to breath, and finally let go of the wand.  Kat quickly retrieved it as it floated to the surface.  Susan then let Todd go and he surfaced, gasping for air.  He was met with a smiling Kat, now human again and sitting on the diving board.<br />
<br />
Todd held onto the edge of the pool and gasped, still trying to get his breath back.  He looked back at Kat and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, congratulations.  You got me.  You won, &quot; said Todd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, the game isn&#39;t over yet.  You still need to be punished,&quot; said Kat flatly.<br />
<br />
Todd smiled.  &quot;And what are you going to do, little girl?  Tell on me?  I don&#39;t think anyone will believe you.  And even if they did, I think your magical abilities might draw a little unwanted attention.  Or are you going to beat me up?   I could take the four of you - easy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about I get my Father to use some hired goons to beat the shit out of you?&quot; said Rachel, now human and walking along the edge of the pool. <br />
<br />
Todd turned pale, well aware of her father&#39;s power and influence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now.  No need to get parents involved.  Besides, I have something better in mind,&quot; said Kat.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Susan nervously, as she sat in a chair and dried her wet hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Todd&#39;s friends are coming here to pick up a mermaid.  I say we give them one.  Or maybe something even better,&quot; said Kat with a wicked smile.<br />
<br />
Todd turned and tried to swim away.  But it was too late.  Kat had already begun the chant.<br />
<br />
***************************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
Not too much later, two very large men entered the backyard without knocking.  They were strong, gruff men in dark suits.  They expressed momentarily surprise when they saw four young women lounging around the pool in swimsuits.  They had apparently expected Todd to be alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Todd?&quot; asked one of the men gruffly.<br />
<br />
Rachel looked up at them from her lounge chair and shrugged.  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  He got a phone call and just left.&quot;<br />
<br />
The men looked at each other with some confusion.  Then the older man turned to look at Rachel again.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We were supposed to pick something up.  You wouldn&#39;t know anything about that, would ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, the creature.  It&#39;s in the pool.  Take it! It&#39;s freaky!&quot; said Rachel.<br />
<br />
The men walked to the edge of the pool. They saw a beautiful girl with dark black hair with streaks of grey wading in the pool. She had large full breasts and pale grey eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please, help me,&quot; she said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem. That&#39;s why we are here,&quot; said the man.  He motioned for the other man to join him.  They looped their arms around hers and began to pull her out of the pool.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, stop,&quot; protested the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright, &quot; said the man softly as he continued to pull. She fought against him weakly, but their combined strength was too much for the girl and she began to rise out of the pool.  But the men almost dropped her when they saw what was below her flat stomach - a writhing mass of tentacles!<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Christ!&quot; hissed one man as he loosened his grip and the girl dropped a little.  Frightened, the girl released a large stream of ink into the pool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get a hold of yourself.  We got a job to do,&quot; said the other man.  Joined by his partner they pulled the strange hybrid of woman and octopus out of the pool.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus!&quot; said the man again, now looking at the creature gasping for air on the ground.  &quot;Don&#39;t look like no mermaid to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And just how many mermaids have you seen?&quot; asked the other man angrily.  &quot;Besides it don&#39;t matter what it is.  Our job is just to get it to the Boss.  Now help me get it into the tank before it dries out or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
The men lifted the weak creature off the ground and carried her out the back gate. The girls waved goodbye to Todd, Rachel even blowing him a kiss.  <br />
<br />
The man returned shortly afterward.  &quot;Is that the only one?  I was told there were more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the only one we saw,&quot; said Kat innocently.  &quot;But feel free to look around.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man looked briefly into the pool, then shook his head and began to walk out of the backyard. He stopped briefly at the gate.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you see that asshole Todd, you can tell him his debt is paid.  Well, a large part of it, at least, &quot; said the man.  &quot;And I can trust that you girls saw nothing. I really don&#39;t want to come back here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing at all,&quot; said Susan, and the girls nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
The man looked them over one last time, then closed the gate and disappeared. <br />
<br />
Once out of sight, the girls laughed uproariously.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Poor Todd, &quot; said Susan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor?  Serves that asshole, right,&quot; said Rachel angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, it seems a bit cruel,&quot; said Susan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.  So what do we do know?&quot; asked Kat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I kind of would like to be a guy again,&quot; said Danielle.<br />
<br />
The other girls turned to her and laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;But don&#39;t you want to enjoy a little girl time with us first? You earned it, after all, &quot; asked Rachel. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I really could use some more pictures, &quot; said Susan.<br />
<br />
&quot;No more mermaid stuff.  Please, &quot; said Danielle pitifully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll think about it, &quot; said Kat slyly, tapping to wand playfully against her hand.<br />
<br />
***********************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
Todd bounced around in the clear tank, loudly cursing the girls for the thousandth time.  The two bruisers couldn&#39;t hear him, but one watched him through the clear glass while the other drove.<br />
<br />
Todd would have his revenge.  He swore it.  But first he had to get out of here.  He didn&#39;t know how, but he would escape.  He just needed to keep his wits.  It didn&#39;t help that he was having terrible stomach cramps.  What had that witch done to him?  Given him diarrhea on top of everything?<br />
<br />
Suddenly the pain reached a crescendo.  He could not hold it back any longer.  He pushed and released with all his might.  He was shocked to see a small smooth white oval drop from beneath the center of his tentacles.  Before he could examine it, more began to follow, landing in a pile at the corner of the tank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey look!  I think she is laying eggs or something!&quot; said the man watching her.<br />
<br />
The man driving shuddered.  This had to be the creepiest job he had done for the Boss yet.  He didn&#39;t want anything more to do with that monster.  He just wanted to deliver the thing and be done with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t matter.  That&#39;s the Boss&#39; problem.  Maybe he will like having more.  I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t care. Now just shut up and make sure it don&#39;t get loose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Inside the tank, Todd held up one egg and examined it. He could feel something moving inside it, and he could almost see it when he held it up to the light.  He smiled wickedly.<br />
<br />
So, that witch has her friends to help her, thought Todd.  Soon I will have some friends of my own to help me.  Very soon.</p>
