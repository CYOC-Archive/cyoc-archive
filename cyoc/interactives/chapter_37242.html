<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mommy sat me down and braided my long brown hair and then she did Katherine's hair up in two pig tails. Dancing around the kitchen, twirling about, holding my dress out, pretending I was a ballerina, mommy than said, &quot;Okay, into the car with the both of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slipping on a pair of shoes that looked a little my sisters Mary Janes, I held out my arms and mommy lifted me into the car seat. My mind almost came back to that of my old self when I felt the straps of the car seat digging into my penis and testicles, but then it was gone as mommy lifted Katherine into her seat next me and fastened her in. As I saw this, my mind slipped once again as I thought, &quot;We're going to see grandma and grandpa and grandmamma is sure to compliment me on my dress.&quot;<br />
<br />
I remained in the frame of mind that I was a girl for most of the evening. Dinner and then after that, we were treated to a movie, courtesy of out grandparents, we were just leaving when mommy slipped and instead of addressing me as Marcus, she said, &quot;Ashley, don't run off to far.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly I realized the oddity of the situation as it came to my attention that I was a boy, wearing a dress suitable for a three year old girl with matching tights and underwear and my hair done up into a braid.<br />
<br />
Unsure what I should do, I instead grabbed my crotch and whined, &quot;Mommy, I half to pee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;God, did I just do and say all that?&quot; I thought, but was interrupted by mommy telling me something, which was completely lost on me as my sister also began to act the same way.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said,&quot; mommy started to repeat herself, &quot;Don't be grabbing yourself like that Marcus, it's not dignified. Show some dignity.&quot; Taking my hand and then my sister's, she told grandpa and grandma that we'd be right back after we found the restroom.<br />
<br />
Into the girl's bathroom both of us where led, Katherine took a stall and I entered one next to her. Hiking up my dress, pulling down my tights and panties, I sighed in relief as I saw that I still at least was a boy down there. Sitting down on the toilet, I peed into it, all the while I swung my feet back and forth.<br />
<br />
Finishing my business, disturbed by how girlish I was acting, I stepped out and started to wash my hands. After a bit, Katherine came out and did the same. Taking mommy's hand, we were led out and back to our grandparents.<br />
<br />
After dessert at the ice cream parlor, grandma and grandpa bid us good evening, said we might see them again soon and took their leave. Home, I stripped and began to get ready for bed. Looking in the mirror, I saw reflected back my naked self and it took me awhile before it came to my attention that I now looked like I'd regressed back to the age of eight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; I sighed. &quot;That little excursion as a girl has cost me a year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking around my room, I saw that the place had gone more girly. My desk was now a vanity, a small doll house sat in the corner and my dresser looked more like a little girls. Opening the drawers, I was slightly happy that at least most of my clothes were still boy clothes. The only ones that were any different were the underwear and my pajamas.<br />
<br />
Opening the closet, I saw that the labels had finished forming and the cubbyholes were now filled with various girl clothes, toys and various items that were common in a three year old girl's room. Hating what had happened, not liking what was happening to me, I pulled a pink, purple and white nightgown with a picture of Angelina Ballerina on it down and pulled it on over my head. Liking the way the fabric felt against my body, I felt my mind slip.<br />
<br />
Shaking my head several times, repeating over and over, &quot;I'm a boy, not a girl,&quot; I managed to get my mind back under control.<br />
<br />
Next I pulled on a pair of panties, completely forgetting that I was supposed to be wearing a pull-up. Tired, I hugged my stuffed ballerina mouse close to me, turned off the lights and crawled into bed, sucking my thumb. I was out before mommy could even tuck me in.<br />
<br />
I awoke to mommy shaking me awake, saying to me, &quot;Marcus, sweetie, it's time to get up. Your breakfast is on the table.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was when I noticed that I was lying in something cold and wet that my mind slipped and I found this one particularly to fight off due to the fact that mommy started hollering, &quot;Ashley, did you wet the bed again? When are you going to start acting like a big girl? This is why you need to remember to wear your pull-ups.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly I was dragged out of bed, my arms forced up and my nightgown removed. Hugging myself because I was cold, I felt my underwear being pulled off. Standing naked in my room, smelling of urine, mommy placed a hand on my shoulder and marched me into the bathroom and began running me a bath. Next she put me in and not saying a thing about my penis and testicles, began to wash me off, all the while muttering, &quot;When are you going to stop doing this Ashley? You really need to quit doing this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Afterward, she dried me off, wrapped be in a towel and marched me back to my room. Inside, she pulled from my closet a skirt and blouse. From the dresser she took a pair of Hello Kitty underwear and a little girl’s bra. As she did this, I looked in the mirror and saw that I was still about eight years old.<br />
<br />
Handing them to me, she said, &quot;Get dressed Ashley, honey.&quot;<br />
<br />
As I put the clothes on, mommy stripped the bed and stepping back into the closet to collect my hamper full of clothes. Next she handed me a pair of socks and as I put those on, she left me. In the kitchen, I sat down on the floor, accidentally exposing the area between my legs. As I pulled on my Arizona Canvas Shoe, mommy came and in and said, &quot;Show some decently Ashley. And don't forget to eat your breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing up, shoes on, I sat down at the table to eat my breakfast, wondering how weird this day could possibly get.</p>
