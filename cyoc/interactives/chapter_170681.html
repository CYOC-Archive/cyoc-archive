<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate couldn&#39;t resist giving himself a little release, his first as... was it his first? He didn&#39;t know, and didn&#39;t care anymore. He just knew that the swamp between his legs needed some attention before he lost his mind. He moved his legs this way and that to get different leverages, finding his new memories filling out a rough map of his most intimate parts, flicking his bean and tentatively pressing on that spongier spot near the front until his body overloaded and he flopped, insensate, on his bed, dopamine still dully flowing through his system.<br />
<br />
He came to after a bit and found himself sitting in wet sheets and groggily dug for his phone and unlocked it. 30 minutes had passed, so he&#39;d probably fallen asleep. And as his brain slowly turned on he realized that he smelled strongly of sex, smelling sickly sweet. He got up, a bit embarrassed, and a sudden breeze made his body stiffen. He must&#39;ve cast off his pants somewhere in his hurry to get off, and his pussy was bare to the world, a small patch of unkempt pubic hair his only protection. On instinct he closed his blinds, just in case any of his neighbors happened to look his way, and that brought him face to face with his own reflection on the mirror to his closet door.<br />
<br />
If was still him, of course. He was a teenager, with unkempt stubble and a few spots of what was probably acne. He was thin, but with a respectable amount of muscle for a young man, owing to the occasional gym trip with his dad. He was wearing just a baggy white T-shirt and socks, bottomless with a scant amount of body hair. Instinctively his knees knocked as he crossed his legs one over the other. It didn&#39;t occur to him that he couldn&#39;t have done so just an hour ago without some serious tucking. It was just what a guy did when he realized his whole pussy was out.<br />
<br />
There were footsteps and Nate heard a knock at the door. &quot;One second, don&#39;t come in!&quot; he cried as he slid the mirror aside to put on a bathrobe.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just me, you dork,&quot; said his sister. Nate heard the doorknob turn.<br />
&quot;I said one second!&quot; he yelled as he threw the robe on. The noise stopped.<br />
When he was done she slowly and cautiously opened the door. &quot;You know,&quot; she said, &quot;You&#39;re not half as quiet as you think you are.&quot;<br />
Nate blushed. &quot;Shut up! You were doing the same thing a few years ago!&quot;<br />
His sister shook her head, tossing her bangs in front of her face. &quot;Not what I meant. I couldn&#39;t care less what you schlick to, Nate. But this place stinks. You sure your date will be jazzed to see you when you smell like pussy?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, shit, I forgot! Uh, uh, I gotta shower!&quot; Nate cried, suddenly panicking to get together a fresh change of clothes.<br />
&quot;Relax, dude, I&#39;ll get the water warm for you. Just crack open a window and turn on a fan before you go, alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate hastily got some (clean) clothes together, his sister watching him run back and forth with amusement. He shut the bathroom door and stripped (which didn&#39;t take very long) and started to wash himself. He got lost briefly as he remembered the warm feeling before, but the water made his fingers chafe so that idea quickly went by the wayside. He scrubbed himself until he couldn&#39;t stand it anymore and shook himself as dry as he could to save time. Then he trimmed his pubes into a cute little bush and shaved off as much stubble as he could manage. Then he paused and looked at himself in the mirror, fully nude, a thrill going through him as he thought that he kind of looked like an exceptionally flat &quot;pussygirl.&quot;<br />
Nate dressed, starting with some plain black panties, then socks, a simple shirt, cargo pants, and a sort of hoodie with a zipper in front. For a finishing touch slapped on some cologne his dad had gotten him for his birthday. The stuff smelled strong and weird and he had no idea if it put girls in the mood, but he figured he may as well try it.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of agonizing waiting, a knock came on the front door. Nate&#39;s parents flanked him as he opened it to the smiling face of Nicole, that cute girl he had a writing class with. She had a round face and high cheekbones to match almond-shaped blue eyes that sat under a pair of slick glasses. Her hair was straight and black, excepting a single strand that she had dyed blue. She was wearing a loose shirt with a floral print, (a blouse maybe? He couldn&#39;t remember,)  some black shorts and some sensible black boots. She was slightly taller than him, and Nate remembered that she was in the year above his.<br />
&quot;Hey, you ready to go?&quot; Nicole asked with a smile.<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; Nate said nervously, taking a few steps into the front yard.<br />
&quot;Hold on,&quot; said his mom. &quot;I thought your mother was going to drive you two, Nicole?&quot;<br />
&quot;I got my license a couple months ago, so I figured I&#39;d just drive the two of us instead.&quot;<br />
Nate&#39;s parents looked at each other nervously. His dad said, &quot;You never told us where you were going.&quot;<br />
Nicole turned to look at Nate instead of him. &quot;I thought we could go to a little hole-in-the-wall place called Cornerstone? It&#39;s just a couple minutes&#39; drive from here. I think you&#39;ll like it.&quot; Her gaze flickered between Nate and his dad, looking for some tacit approval.<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Nate&#39;s dad relented. &quot;Just call us if you need anything and we&#39;ll come running.&quot; His expression shifted into a grin as he added, &quot;Go get &#39;em, tiger!&quot;<br />
<br />
The door closed behind them and the two got into Nicole&#39;s car. Nate got in the passenger seat and tried not to stare as Nicole shifted her weight to get comfortable. He&#39;d heard rumors that she was packing a monster, that she&#39;d sometimes get a boner in P.E. and all the other girls could see it. It was probably just her phone, he told himself. Don&#39;t screw this up, Nate. Don&#39;t screw this up.<br />
Nicole started the car and the sound system restarted, playing a pop song from a famous female singer, who was spitting rhymes about all the different games men would play to get dick from their woman. Nicole hastily shut it off with a self-conscious, &quot;Sorry!&quot;<br />
Nate felt a flush in his cheeks and said, &quot;No, it&#39;s alright, we can listen to that.&quot;<br />
Nicole chuckled nervously. &quot;A-alright, then,&quot; she said, turning it back on.<br />
<br />
The two went the short distance to the date mostly in silence, full of nervous first-date energy. Nicole wrapped an arm around Nate&#39;s shoulder and walked inside the restaurant with him, grabbing a seat at a heavily-varnished wooden table and roaming their eyes around the room to take in the rustic pictures and old ads that gave the place a feeling of rustic 70s Americana. A waitress came by (dressed in pants rather than a skirt) and took their orders, leaving the two to think of something clever to say to start the night off right...</p>
