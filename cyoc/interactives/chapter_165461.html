<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ty watched the attractive Mark rub his oversized bulge through his strained green singlet, he thought up a new idea and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m changing the spell,&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;Let&#39;s make this a bit more interesting. The pants rule will stay the same, but their dick will only grow 6 inches, not 10. That will keep things from becoming too &#39;big&#39; of a problem.&quot; He chuckled quietly. &quot;Also, anyone who removes their shirt will gain 15 pounds of muscle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty watched the unsuspecting Mark in anticipation, before another idea hit him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just to add an extra layer of excitement, anyone who looks at Mark&#39;s bulge will grow too. Every 10 seconds they look, an inch is added to their dick and their balls grow to stay proportional,&quot; he thought. &quot;NOW it&#39;s exciting.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was interrupted from his train of thought by the locker room door opening. It was the rest of the wrestling team, ready for another practice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Mark said under his breath. The fact that he had a foot-and-a-half long bulge in his singlet suddenly hit him. At least he had his shorts on over it, though they unfortunately didn&#39;t help that much. Slightly panicked, he turned towards his locker as the rest of the team came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up Mark?&quot; called a stocky guy with stylist brown hair as he strolled to his locker. &quot;Early as usual.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark nodded in response, still facing his locker. &quot;Sup.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up ya bitches!&quot; an over-exuberant, athletic-looking redhead yelled as he ran in. He smacked Mark&#39;s back as he ran by. &quot;Punctual as ever,&quot; he said in a nasally, mocking voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Charlie,&quot; Mark responded, letting out a very fake-sounding laugh while trying to hide his oversized package. <br />
<br />
The rest of the team filed in shortly and set about getting ready for practice.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a miracle,&quot; Charlie grumbled to a nearby wrestler, Sam. &quot;Mark hasn&#39;t told me to fuck off yet.&quot; A few people snickered as everyone kicked off their shoes and began to pull down their shorts. The blond Wesley noticed that Mark hadn&#39;t moved. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Mark!&quot; he laughed. &quot;We&#39;re not going to stare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Likely story,&quot; Mark huffed under his breath as he reluctantly pulled his shorts back down along with the others. Then things got exciting.<br />
<br />
All at once, the locker room became quiet as each wrestler became aware of the fact that their groin had began to feel unusually warm. Several exchanged confused glances before the sound of stretching fabric gradually became apparent. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is that?&quot; Wesley asked, slightly nervous. They would know soon enough.<br />
<br />
Ty smiled as he saw the realization dawn on each of the wrestlers&#39; faces. Rapidly, the air in the locker room began to fill with the sound of groaning fabric and moans of pleasure as the wrestlers felt their manhoods swell in their already stimulating singlets.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck...&quot; Charlie moaned with his eyes closed as he grabbed his dick through his green singlet and felt it swelling by the second in his hand, forcing it more and more open. Several others followed suit, trying to stop the powerful surges of growth radiating through their cocks. Ty heard a banging noise and turned to see Mitch, the stocky brunette, bucking his hips against his locker as he moaned and felt his once-modest dick swelling and growing into a huge, heavy log.<br />
<br />
Then, as soon as it had started, it stopped. Each wrestler felt the surges of growth cease, leaving their dick exactly 6 inches longer than it was 30 seconds ago. The locker room had once contained some fairly modest packages, but now the team all had dicks ranging from 9 to almost 14 inches packed into their overtaxed singlets. Well, almost all of them. There might be an outlier...<br />
<br />
&quot;oohhhhh FUCKING SHIIIIIT!&quot; Mark half screamed, half moaned as the sounds of ripping fabric and something slamming into a locker echoed through the room.<br />
<br />
The team looked reasonably concerned. &quot;Mark,&quot; Danny asked in a concerned voice while trying to adjust his noticeable 11-inch bulge. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
In response, Mark finally turned around, revealing a horrified face, a torn singlet, and an enormous 2-foot monster cock jutting out from his pelvis.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE EVERLIVING FUCK!?&quot; several team members screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I know!&quot; Mark groaned, holding his rather heavy &quot;log.&quot; &quot;It was already big when you got here and that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t turn around! After I got here it did this and I don&#39;t know how! There were some little twinks spying on me so I told them to fuck off, and then you guys walked in!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s just great!&quot; Mitch yelled, throwing his hands up into the air. &quot;Now the same&#39;s happened to us! If you had told us, maybe it wouldn&#39;t have!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I, the fucking Oracle!? How was I supposed to know?&quot; Mark yelled back.<br />
<br />
While they continued arguing, Dustin showed up at Ty&#39;s side. &quot;The twins are whacking it in the showers over there but nothing much else is going on, so I came back,&quot; he told Ty and fake pouted. &quot;And it looks like you had all the fun without me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty had to admit that it was quite a spectacle. &quot;Just wait, it&#39;ll get even better.&quot; Already, he could see the new effect working its magic. The other wrestlers obviously couldn&#39;t keep their eyes off Mark&#39;s mega-dick, and it was starting to show. Ty could see their dicks slowly growing longer and fatter in their singlets, and they were none the wiser. Already Charlie&#39;s new 10-incher was closing in on a full foot. Who ever said redheads couldn&#39;t be packing? He would need a tazer from now on to keep girls from tearing his pants off whenever they could. And Mitch, the stocky brunette, was starting to develop a wet spot in the green fabric of his singlet as his dick passed 11 inches and counting.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I always said that our wrestling team needed to be bigger, but I think you took that a little too literally,&quot; Dustin remarked in a deadpan manner. Ty chuckled.</p>
