<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Why are you looking FOR dogs?&quot; the first mollie asked, &quot;are you a daredevil?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dumb beasts that run about because humans tell them to,&quot; the second grumbled, &quot;no pride whatsoever... but then, we can't all be related to the mighty lion, can we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We aren't lions,&quot; Trevor answered...<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't mind her,&quot; the first replied, looking at Trevor with the same look of interest that Queen had before, which made him nervous, &quot;our human sold her kittens away and she was rather attached...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They'd only just been weaned!&quot; the second said to her neighbor, &quot;I hadn't taught them how to hunt and who to watch out for. Do you think some human is going to understand that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry if I'm intruding on something,&quot; Trevor spoke, &quot;but I'm sort of on a mission... you see, I heard this rumor about these dogs, that they're deliberately going after cats and killing them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All dogs try, tom,&quot; the first spoke, &quot;we usually outsmart them. We know the length of their chains or stay in the tree, which they can't climb.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor didn't think that was really a sign of intelligence, but decided to let it go. He didn't have time for an argument.<br />
<br />
&quot;These dogs are different,&quot; Trevor told them, &quot;they are large and walk like humans do. They might be able to even pursue a cat into a tree.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have seen no strange dogs,&quot; the second answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But there was that scent,&quot; the first spoke up, sensing that her companion was trying to drive of the male that had approached them, &quot;I caught this scent. I doubt our human caught it, but it made me very alert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where?&quot; Trevor asked, hoping he could track the scent back to its source, which if it worked might mean he wouldn't have to meet Queen or her mollies at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Over there,&quot; the first turned her head and pointed with her nose, &quot;you'll know it when you get it. It smelled like a canine, but not like any domestic breed. It was powerful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn't here,&quot; the second tried to comfort her companion, &quot;and so, young daredevil, what do you intend to do when you find these dogs? The scent was powerful, as she said. It isn't likely that these things can be batted around like the little yappy ones, that are dumber then the large ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully make sure they can't harm any cats,&quot; Trevor vowed, knowing that he was lying through his teeth, but it would at least prevent him from getting into an argument over whether or not cats were superior to humans or humans were superior to cats.<br />
<br />
&quot;My hero,&quot; the first smiled and then rubbed against Trevor, letting him take in her scent, &quot;if you survive, call me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor nodded and carried on, leaving the two mollies with their human. Once he was far enough away, he shuddered. Why was it that every female cat wanted him? Of course, any real cat would probably be intrigued, but he wasn't a real cat. He was a victim of the &quot;game&quot; and knew that he would likely remain in his cursed state until he died.<br />
<br />
He slowly approached the spot and then caught what the mollie was talking about. It was a powerful canine scent, different from the few scents he could remember, yet still similar. This was likely the ticket, and he began following the scent, hoping it would lead to something.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Back in Frostville, Abbey and Samantha came back to the reflective screen of the television. They were both surprised at their ability to hear the shower running, even inside the mirrorverse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here goes,&quot; Abbey said to her sister leaped out of mirrorverse into the hotel room, with Samantha following.<br />
<br />
The two of them made a remarkably soft landing on the carpet. Julie's shower was undisturbed, and Chester didn't budge from where he was sleeping. They turned to see Alice waiting patiently on the screen. They then looked down to see their glass forms. Samantha tentatively played with her tail to test its texture while Abbey seemed to almost marvel at herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember the plan,&quot; Alice urged her cousins, &quot;Abbey is to write the note while Samantha watches for any possible danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two newest members of the Big Bad Wolf Pack nodded to Alice and then took their positions. Samantha stayed near the foot of the bed, while Abbey approached the small end table that separated the two beds, and began writing something on the notepad that was there. It didn't take long, and once finished, Abbey stepped aside and motioned for her sister. Samantha approached and then wrote down her own name next to Abbey's. <br />
<br />
She then turned and did what had been intended to set the plan in motion. She grabbed the sleeping dog, awakening it. Chester, startled out of his sleep barked an alarm, two disoriented to know who was holding him. He pawed at Samantha's glass body, but did no harm as the two pups rushed back to the television's reflective surface with Chester with them.<br />
<br />
Chester's barking did exactly as originally predicted. Julie stopped her shower, and stuck her head out the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chester! DOWN!&quot; Julie called into the room, &quot;Abbey, Samantha, what set him off?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was no answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls?!&quot; Julie spoke, trying to dry her hair without revealing herself to her daughters.<br />
<br />
There was still no answer. After a few moments, when her face was dry enough to let her open her eyes, she looked out to see the empty room. Now, had Chester not barked, she would have assumed that they had taken Chester for a walk, but he had barked, and now, no one was there. Not even Chester.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls?&quot; Julie spoke again, her voice filling with worry as she dropped her towel and walked into the room, &quot;I hope you're not hiding from me. Mommy doesn't have time for these games.&quot;<br />
<br />
She got down and looked under the first bed. No one was there. She crawled over to the second bed. No one was under it, either. No one was in the closet either. She began feel panicked and turned about quickly. Her daughters were gone. The game had stolen her husband and now her daughters were gone. As she turned she saw a small note laying on the first bed. Nervously, she picked it up and read it...<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy, Alice is taking us to Daddy. He wants to talk to you, but it must only be at 3452 Hiss Street back home. Please come. Alone. You will not see us if that weird lady or anyone else shows up.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was also signed by her daughters.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Julie gasped and looked around, the mirrors were still covered as Madame Serenity had instructed.<br />
<br />
She began to panic. The &quot;imaginary friend&quot; had her daughters and was taking them what a sort of warehouse area back in Glendale, and she knew of Madame Serenity and found her to be trouble. She had to do something, but what? Frostville's police wouldn't believe her, and Glendale's seemingly wouldn't do much, and if she called Madame Serenity, Alice would never let her see her daughters again.<br />
<br />
She did the only thing a mother in her position could do. She began getting dressed. She would get her daughters back and she would smash this &quot;Alice&quot; for steeling them from her.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You all seem rather taken with the Alpha Female,&quot; Zack commented as he and Kaylee's copies were in a &quot;living room&quot; on the manor's upper floor while they watched Caroline supervising the work on the new gate, &quot;Considering that she was originally a dork.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But she is better now,&quot; Isabelle retorted as the three had shared their new friendship with Kaylee, &quot;her personality is nothing like Kyle's, better built then even Jen was as a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack looked over the three females with him. Isabelle, Hope, and Grace were all physically built the same way Kaylee was, with large breasts, a narrow waist, wide hips, and were topped off with powerful, but still feminine muscles. And Zack found that to be highly attractive, and he did want to mate with Kaylee. But, so long as Jensen had her as his mate and &quot;Alpha Female&quot; he wouldn't get a chance, which is what Zack resented.<br />
<br />
He had been Jen's best friend before everything. Now, Zack found Jensen's plans for the game to be interesting, he didn't like the fact that he had been replaced as &quot;Jen's&quot; best friend by someone that would likely never stand a chance with anyone in Jen's click when they were human. Kaylee was an improvement over Kyle, yes, but to Zack it didn't justify removing him as the &quot;best friend&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll give you that,&quot; Zack shrugged, &quot;but don't you think it's perverted some things? I mean, we followed Jen...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now we follow Jensen,&quot; Hope spoke, &quot;the same person, only different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes, but that's not my point,&quot; Zack spoke slowly, &quot;Kyle was well below us as a human. The only girl he ever attracted was that freaky cat girl, who's now up and vanished. Even she couldn't stand him. Now, using the game to improve him to Kaylee was perfectly fine with me. But shouldn't we still be placed above her. Remind her of where she came from and that her place is only given because of Jen's &quot;compassion&quot;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are as the Master wished,&quot; Grace said, &quot;we are part of his pack. It's not like we can really argue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides,&quot; Isabelle commented, &quot;are you currently wanting to mate with Jensen to take Alpha Female's place?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack inwardly cringed. His now decidedly male hormones and persona were entirely attracted to females. He wasn't about to engage in homosexuality, and Jensen probably wasn't about to demand that of him anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess not,&quot; Zack sighed, &quot;I'd much rather mate with you three... or the other females.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three she-wolves nodded, but the answer was not as positive as Zack had hoped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe later,&quot; all three of them said in unison.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Chester was still very frightened as the wolf-girl held him and carried him through the mirrorverse. He was equally perplexed by her turning to flesh and blood and wearing a dress inside the mirrorverse. He continued to paw and bark at her, but she held him tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, boy, it's me,&quot; the wolf-girl spoke to him.<br />
<br />
That made him blink in confusion. The wolf-girl sounded like one of his master's girls who commonly played with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha?&quot; Chester barked out, remembering the name.<br />
<br />
All three wolf-girls around him stopped and blinked in utter surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chester, you talked!&quot; one of the other two gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could always talk,&quot; Chester answered firmly, &quot;it's just that humans can not understand me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can we understand you now?&quot; Samantha asked as looked down at the small dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe because Fenrir gave you some of his power,&quot; Chester spoke, &quot;as you match his specific breed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fenrir?&quot; Samantha asked puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he means Fenris,&quot; Alice spoke, &quot;He was the son of Loki and female frost giant in Norse mythology. A monstrous wolf that would signal the beginning of Ragnarok, the end of the Asgard, by killing Odin. Supposedly, Odin kept him under tight watch to insure that it did not happen, and only Tyr was brave enough to feed him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know that?&quot; Abbey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was among things I looked at before I became Alice,&quot; Alice replied, &quot;Although I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fenrir was not some evil beast sneaking to destroy anything,&quot; Chester answered sounding defensive, &quot;a powerful warrior, yes, but not evil.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless, we do not serve Fenris,&quot; Alice answered, &quot;and Abbey and Samantha's transformation was because of me and my powers. I had to do it to reunite them with their &quot;father&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chester calmed down a bit as Samantha still held him. He still remembered his master, and wished that his disappearance would be solved, ending the frustration that was going on in the family.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we're going to see daddy, now, right?&quot; Abby asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Alice answered as she took one of Abbey's paws and put the other paw on Samantha's shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;All that is needed is three steps.&quot;</p>
