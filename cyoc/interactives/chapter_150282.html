<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    With a yawn Kairos&#39; maw stretches open, canine tongue rising into the air. Wiggling and flexing the claws on his hands and feet, the golden lupine&#39;s ruby red eyes flutter open, vision blurry from tears the yawn had granted him. Body and tense muscles relaxing, the canine&#39;s eyes squint as they aimlessly stare to what lay above him.<br />
<br />
    Meeting his vision, a sunlit wooden ceiling told him he was no longer within the void of light and shadow; his soul had returned to the waking world.<br />
<br />
    A second yawn slipping from his jaws, Kairos&#39; large form rolls to its side, the lupine propping himself up with an elbow. Rising to a sitting position, the golden wolf&#39;s body slides upwards, wide back leaning against the wall behind the bed.<br />
<br />
    Bringing a hand up to his wolfish face and rubbing his waking eyes, the beast glances down to his barreled chest covered in lustrous fur. Nose twitching, the lupine&#39;s face scrunches up in mild curiosity, eyes squinting as he realized there was something wet clinging to the fur on his torso, appearing to be a milky white as illuminated by the rays of morning sunlight piercing through the small window at the end of the room.<br />
<br />
    Sliding a finger beneath a drop of the curious substance and bringing a small sample of it up to his muzzle, Kairos&#39; flat canine tongue laps it, a unique saltiness flooding his taste buds as he swallowed the droplet.<br />
<br />
    On cue, the golden canine&#39;s ruby red gaze drifts downwards to his crotch, bestial eyes widening before his entire face scrunches up in disgust at the sight of a flaccid red shaft peeking out from a canine sheath, the same white substance leaking from its tip.<br />
<br />
    Sighing in resignation at having already conducted such a disgusting action, the lupine hastily rose from the comfort of the bed to clean himself, not wishing to further degrade himself for Orveus&#39; amusement.<br />
<br />
    <i>&quot;The one time I have a wet dream…&quot;</i><br />
<br />
    Glancing around the lounging room of the library, Kairos&#39; grins in victory at the sight of cleaning rags. Retrieving one, the lupine glides the cleaning cloth across his chest, wiping his chest fur and the tip of his shaft of his wolfish seed.<br />
<br />
    Disposing of the sullied cloth, a beast-like growl rumbles from Kairos&#39; throat as his wide physique sits down on the edge of the bed, ears twitching as his gaze spotted the slumbering form of Thorin, the small kobold hidden under the large blanket encompassing him. The yellow lizardboy&#39;s black cloak lay at the end of the bed, tangled within his claws.<br />
<br />
    The feeling of something cold rubbing up against the back of his heel caused the wolf&#39;s gaze to shoot downwards, muscles involuntary tensing up. His furred body quickly relaxes however, the object in question having turned out to be the iron surface of his shield.<br />
<br />
    The lupine&#39;s head tilted thoughtfully as be examined what lay beside the bed. His sword comfortably lay within its scabbard, clipped to the back of the aforementioned iron shield. Kenos&#39; black tome rested atop the surface of a small side table beside his bed, the white and gold tome that belonged to Thorin next to it. The blue serpentine mask he had worn the night before obscured the eye like symbol on the black tome, having been placed over it&#39;s cover. Everything looked so small...<br />
<br />
     Attention returning to his sheathed weapon, the lupine&#39;s mind suddenly seizes up in realization;<br />
<br />
    He had yet to report the outcome of his mission to the guards. And there was no way in hell he&#39;d be going out like this.<br />
<br />
    Silently cursing, Kairos&#39; large bestial hands slide up to his canine face. Instinctively positioning his claws at the edges of his face, the golden lupine pulls with a strained grunt. With a flash of light, the mask releases its grip on Kairos&#39; face, slipping from his grasp and tumbling down to his lap.<br />
<br />
    Panting from the instantaneous effects of the transformation&#39;s recession, Kairos gently rubs his face, the blonde haired human sighing in relief at the feeling of skin beneath his fingers. Regaining his composure, the knight rises to his feet once again, rolling his neck and shoulders in order to fully awaken his body.<br />
<br />
    Clipping both the scabbard of his blade and iron shield to the baldric at his back and fidgeting with the belt at his waist, the red clothed human&#39;s gaze falls to the two masks and black tome at the desk next to the bed. Clipping both masks onto the belt at his left hip, Kairos tucks Kenos&#39; spellbook into his tunic&#39;s belt near the clipped masks.<br />
<br />
    Brushing his curtained hair back with a sigh, the gaze of Kairos&#39; ocean blue eyes shifts to the slumbering kobold at the bed beside him. Sighing, the blue eyed knight quietly walks to the side of the resting kobold, treading carefully to prevent his boots from making any sound. Hands gripping the blanket, Kairos pulls with ease. <br />
<br />
    The yellow lizardboy&#39;s eyes snap open as a large gust of cold air blows against his scales, an involuntary yelp of terror slipping from his maw. Alert amber eyes glimpsing up in shock, Thorin quickly relaxes at the sight of Kairos, although his flustered expression persists at the sight of his warm blanket within the human&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Rise and shine.&quot; A cheeky smile across Kairos&#39; face causes the kobold to sigh tiredly, scratching his eyes as the light invaded them. &quot;We&#39;re heading to the guardhouse. Grab your things and let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Ushering no complaints, Thorin hastily hops off the comfort of the bed, throwing his warm cloak around himself as his claws reached up to grab the white tome at his bedside. Slipping his tome within his robe, the kobold nods to the human.<br />
<br />
    Tapping of boots and clicking of claws echo throughout the quiet library as both knight and apprentice mage make their way to the library&#39;s entrance, only stopping as the tall slender form of Cynthia stands before them, a devious smile plastered across her face.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Now, where are you two boys going?&quot; Placing her hands on her hips, the sorceress&#39; heels clack against the floorboards of her domain as she struts over to Kairos, a sly smile crossing her lips.<br />
<br />
    &quot;The guardhouse. I have to report my mission and find any leads relating to the whereabouts of this annoying clan.&quot; Tapping the tip of his boots against the library&#39;s floor, Kairos&#39; blue eyes lock with the grey pools of Cynthia.<br />
<br />
    &quot;My, how cruel of you! Coming all this way just to leave?&quot; The raven haired woman smirks at the knight&#39;s conflicted expression, the kobold beside him mirroring the expression.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Well, good luck on your reporting then. If I were you, I&#39;d keep the effects of those masks a secret, lest the paranoid ones ravage you.&quot; With a smile, the librarian&#39;s voluptuous form struts away, the sound of her clicking heels growing quiet as she fades into the depths of the library.<br />
<br />
    The exit unguarded, both Kairos and Thorin slip free from the dimly lit interior of the library. Door closing behind the pair, the scent of morning dew flooded the air, rays of sunlight seeping through cracks in a cloudy sky. Brushing his hair back to admire the morning visage of Vestra; the blooming town. <br />
<br />
    Kairos&#39; blue gaze drops to the kobold next to him, the yellow scaled reptile gazing up at him in response.<br />
<br />
    Nodding in unison, the human and kobold pair begin their uneventful walk to the town guardhouse, greeting a few passersby along their trek. Thankfully, few people were present at such an early hour, many tending to sleep in. Kairos was grateful for such a thing, not preferring to be caught up in pointless conversations about the masks or tome that lay at his belt. People were often too nosy for their own good, especially in a rather small town.<br />
<br />
    As the two walked, Thorin couldn&#39;t help but observe the red clad human&#39;s rather dreamlike movements. The kobold was more curious about the bizarre energy radiating from the two masks at the knight&#39;s belt. Alongside Kairos&#39; own essence, it felt as if there were two others beside him…<br />
<br />
    Two souls.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Kairos?&quot; The kobold&#39;s slitted eyes gaze up attentively at the human, who continued to walk on without returning his gaze. Even then, the blonde haired man&#39;s lips part to respond.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Yeah?&quot; <br />
<br />
    &quot;I was just wondering… how exactly is it like? Working as a mercenary?&quot;<br />
<br />
    Falling silent, the golden haired man&#39;s gaze falls to the stone ground underfoot, deep in thought as they continued to walk. &quot;Hard to say. Most mercenaries tend to accept jobs based off their pay, only in it for the money. Many could care less care about helping people just out of good will. Only the naive do such things.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;O-Oh…&quot;<br />
<br />
    A sigh from the human reattracts the reptilian apprentice&#39;s attention, whose head tilts curiously. &quot;Although… I always saw it as being more than that.&quot; As if attempting to withhold his anger, Kairos&#39; hand clenched into a fist, a rather frustrated sigh escaping from him as he breathed. &quot;...Like tracking down the location of this jackass clan leader.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Stifling a shiver at the human&#39;s show of self contained rage, the kobold&#39;s attention refocus back to the stony street beneath his claws. &quot;H-Hey… Kairos…?&quot;<br />
<br />
    At his name the human sighs in exasperation. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;I-I want to... join you.&quot;<br />
<br />
    At Thorin&#39;s remark the human immediately halts, falling silent as his gaze locked with amber orbs of the naive reptilian who turned to face him. &quot;You <em>what</em>?&quot;<br />
<br />
    Shuffling his feet anxiously, from within his robes the kobold&#39;s claws desperately clutched his tome. &quot;W-Well... I--!&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;On second thought, I don&#39;t want to hear it.&quot; The yellow lizardboy&#39;s words froze as the red clad knight spoke, tone icy. &quot;It&#39;s that type of naivety that gets people like you killed, Thorin. That&#39;s not even on top of mentioning you&#39;re still an apprentice mage here at Vestra&#39;s local academy.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Unable to rebuke him, the kobold sighs in resignation as the human continued on. There was truth to his words, yet even then a quiet sense of longing pulled at the amber eyed reptilian&#39;s heart. A longing to see what lay outside the walls of the Town of Vestra, a crave for adventure. <br />
<br />
    But it <i>was</i> naive. The world was unpredictable; he&#39;d get killed.<br />
<br />
    Shaking his head the kobold sped up his pace to catch up to the human. Neither spoke a word, the empty streets instilling an empty silence aside from the occasional singing of birds and drift of the wind.</p>
