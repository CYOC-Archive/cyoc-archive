<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finding a college wasn&#39;t a hard at all for Jeff, after all, he was only in it for one thing. It wasn&#39;t for the education, oh no. It was for the expanded variety of options they&#39;d give him. So he&#39;d done the only thing that was going to make that happen. He&#39;d searched up the college with the highest female demographic.<br />
<br />
Sundale Academy; University of for Gifted Women... Yeah, that was the slogan or whatever. They had the most girls all for the sake of being a &quot;female exclusive&quot; college. Well, all female and a nice new plus one, heh. Jeff used the Chronivac the same way he&#39;d given himself the house, he&#39;d edited himself to be a student at the Academy. He&#39;d very briefly considered following the theme and making a woman out of himself but, he&#39;d shrugged it off just as quick. As fun as it might&#39;ve been it wasn&#39;t worth getting stuck as one by accident... He&#39;d glanced over to his ex who lay crusted over in the corner with the other toys. Wonder how she liked being neglected after her arguing with him. He&#39;d been using his first toy right in front of her for weeks. Even letting it drain out on top of her to seal the deal. Bet, she&#39;d wished she&#39;d have kept all that shouting down now~ Oh well, enough about her for now. He&#39;d had to get ready for his first day at the Academy.<br />
<br />
Once he got to the academy, he&#39;d seen the local selection nearly immediately. There wasn&#39;t a ton of all star beauties like those tv shows might suggest. There were a few though, they ought to be fun to collect later on. There were a lot of the worst variety too, the supposed equalist types... Those might be fun in there own way too. For the most part, the rest were in the midrange of meh to alright. Speaking of the midrange, there was a girl standing out front of the gate looking about as if she was trying to find someone. Find him, it looked like, as she trotted down the path toward him. <br />
<br />
First thing to notice was those old school looking glasses she was wearing. Did she get them from Grandma or something? After that was ribbon holding her long bobbing pony tail together behind her neck. Brown hair and brownish eyes, modest body, and the sweater with overall jeans combo really completed the old-fashioned look. She came to a stop just in front of him huffing softly from that little bit of exertion with a smile on her face. <br />
<br />
The girl reached out her hand for a handshake. &quot;Hello, I assume you must be Jeff. I&#39;m Stella, I&#39;ll be your guide around the Academy today. I just had to meet the Academy&#39;s first male student!&quot; Her smile practically glowed as she handed a pamphlet to Jeff and turned around to lead the way. She didn&#39;t notice as Jeff pulled out his phone using the Chronivac app to scane her.<br />

Together Stella and Jeff walked around the large campus over the next couple of hours. He was taking to the caferia, the various class halls, library, recreation areas, gymnasium, and pool areas. The latter pair had included guided tours of the locker rooms in both areas. Jeff got more than a few eyefuls of bodies of all shapes, sizes, and varieties. He couldn&#39;t help the boner rising in his pants but, the girls around them paid him no more attention than any other girl. He&#39;d made sure to add that they&#39;d be comfortable with his presence in places like this. However, not to ruin his fun later on, he didn&#39;t make that the case everywhere. This didn&#39;t stop him from &#39;accidentally&#39; bump into some of the fun places of certain girls.<br />
<br />
<br />
The tours also led him to the living areas of the campus and the room he could use for overnight stays. Stella happily explained each building they&#39;d passed through during their long walk. The entire tour was coming to an end as they approached the administration building. He&#39;d be meeting with the Headmistress as part of a final introduction before he&#39;d given his personal schedule and what not. While they waited for him to be called into the office, Jeff made his decision. Having already pulled up Stella&#39;s file on the app, he spoke to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So uh hey, what would you say you help me get even more familiar with the campus, huh?&quot; He gave the old smile and wink combo as Stella seemed to turn bright red in the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-whuh? Oh no... No no no... I just met you. I&#39;m not interested thank you very much.&quot; She waved her hands toward Jeff as he&#39;d turned his attention to the app already. <br />

<br />
&quot;Well, I guess I&#39;m still not much of a pickup artist... That&#39;s ok though, you&#39;ll be happy to help me from now on.&quot; He pressed the screen to start the program and tossed the phone to the floor in front of Stella. <br />
<br />
She&#39;d had a moment of confusion before her clothes vanished and her hands pulled her toward the phone like a magnet. She was bent over over in seconds as her pussy started to grow wet. &quot;Whuh... What&#39;s going on?&quot; Her breaths were getting faster as the arousal kicked in.<br />
<br />
Jeff walked over behind Stella&#39;s well positioned behind spreading her legs with a foot. &quot;Don&#39;t worry you&#39;ll enjoy yourself before you go.&quot; Dropping his pants and underwear he rested his dick atop her ass cheeks rubbing his shaft along the soft cheeks. Stella panicked realizing what he was about to do and yet at the same time she moaned softly gently grinding against his dick. She didn&#39;t get pulled any further into the phone until Jeff pulled his hips back and thrust into her wet lips.<br />
<br />
Her moan was an awkward mix of pain, denial, and arousal. Hands sunk into the screen beneath them as her voice wavered in excitement. So he thrust slowly watching as her arms pulled into the screen being squeezed in impossibly. After a few minutes of slow thrusts, her face was pressed hard against the floor as her shoulders were getting dragged in next. She&#39;d stop her denials at this point while drooling on the floor absently. It was either her lack of sexual intercourse, the Chronivac, or both but, she&#39;d orgasmed three times over the course of the changes.<br />
<br />
With a chuckle, Jeff slapped her ass hard and thrust once more pressing as deep as he could. With another series of squirts and shakes from her body, he watched not only her shoulders but her head get pulled in. Her modest breasts were pressed to the screen and her hardened nipples touching the cold tile floor. Feeling it&#39;d be a shame not to at least get a feel first, Jeff pulled out of her quivering lips to pick the phone off the floor. He was surprised as the phone lifted off floor with ease as her body leveraged itself upward. So he reeached his free hand around groping and pinching her breasts and nipples only to hear her voice play out from the phone. Another orgasm shuddered free of her still free body before Jeff placed the phone between her feet folding her in half.<br />
<br />
The next thrust actually pulled her legs closed with her feet onto the phone. It made Jeff pause a moment seeing this completely impossible pose the Chronivac had forced her into. She didn&#39;t seem to mind though as she&#39;d huffed through the phone speaker. He&#39;d rushed the next series of thrusts to get the pose to something less problematic. Her legs sank fast into the glowing screen, his hips slapping wetly against hers as fluids started running down his inner thighs. Her ass and lips stuck in the air as her body seemed balanced on her thighs and breasts. <br />
<br />
Wanting to spice it up a bit for himself he pulled out once more and kicked his pants off. He left her and his phone to be found at anytime as walked around the waiting room. Checking the nearby drawers he&#39;d found just the kind of thing he could use. A flashlight in hand, he&#39;d returned to her awaiting sex and rubbed the impromptu toy against it and her thighs. Happy with how lubed it was, he thrust it deep into her unattended asshole with a surprised gasp and flush of fluids. He&#39;d turned on the flashlight before plunging it completely watching it become nothing more than a warm glow with a bead of light coming through.<br />
<br />
Once again happy with his playing around, he continued forcing the change forward feeling the flashlight rubbing against his dick inside her. He&#39;d picked the phone up still within her lips setting it atop a nearby chair to keep from kneeling longer. Once the only part of her still sticking out of the phone was her ass cheeks and vagina, Jeff was about to relieve his own build up as the door opened to the Headmistress&#39;s office.<br />
<br />
An older woman with gray hair wearing a serious business suit with skirt stood in the doorway. She glared at Jeff taking in the scene and sighed. &quot;Please stop playing with your phone young man and come into my office...&quot; She left the door open turning away to take a seat back at her desk. Surprised by the interruption, Jeff did as he was bidden pulling out to his tip and thrust as deep as he could. The phone moaned loudly oozing a mix of his and her fluids as her final part sunk into his phone. The flashlight popped out and fell to the floor with a sudden ejection and the mix of fluids smothered his screen.<br />
<br />
Taking a few tissues, he wiped phone clean of the fluids and was greeted to the nearly naked sight of Stella. She stood ready to accept requests with her lower lips still dribbling between her legs. Curiously while he still had time, he asked a question of Stella. &quot;What is the name of the Headmistress?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Her name is Anastasia Grovinsky, age sixty seven, Birthday; October thirteenth. What else would you like to know about her?&quot; Stella smiled warmly as she waited for another question. Behind her, Kiri sat on the nonexistent floor as she did when he&#39;d first wake her. Without answering or asking another question, Jeff turned off his screen and enterred the office. Taking a seat before the Headmistress, he let her say her piece. It was as expected, don&#39;t do this, don&#39;t do that, so on and so on... <br />
<br />
Leaving the room, he pulled out his phone to find Stella still waiting for him diligently. &quot;Stella, what are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am your personal guide for the Sundale Academy, I will answer any questions about it and its population as I can. What is your next question?&quot; She idly swung herself side to side clasping her hands behind her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you get along with Kiri?&quot; He asked genuinely curious. <br />
<br />
&quot;However you wish me too. I will interact with her in any way that I am able to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any way~&quot; She smiled eagerly as her thighs seemed to glisten on the digital screen. <br />
<br />
That could be fun to watch for later but, for now, he was going to scope out his next toy or even... toys~&quot;</p>
