<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Such a shame to lose you two, but right now we need some draft horses for pulling the horse-drawn tour cart and I think you&#39;ll be perfect for the job,&quot; Jenkins said as he put the syringes away. &quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be more than happy to put the both of you to good use.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t do this, we&#39;re human beings!!!&quot; Mark yelled as they tried to struggle, he could already feel fur growing along his legs and his crotch. &quot;You can&#39;t do this to us, it&#39;s a violation...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry officer but nobody cares,&quot; Jenkins said with a grin. &quot;In a few minutes you&#39;ll be just dirty horny mindless animals. So it&#39;s completely legal what are we going to do you afterward. You&#39;ll be for all intents and purposes animals, and nobody has complained about it before. Hehe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark looked over at Georgina who was trying to struggle just as much as he was. He blinked in surprise when he heard her let out a moan, she wasn&#39;t trying to escape she was getting aroused already, he could smell her arousal and, something more which made his cock suddenly and unwittingly stand at attention.<br />
<br />
His thoughts of escape were fighting with some new feelings he was getting as he watched white fur started to cover his partner&#39;s body. She moaned loudly as she tried to rub herself against the chair which only made him hornier as he stared at her as a tail started to form out of her butt. He was hypnotized for an instant but he quickly recovered his senses and started to fight back again despite he felt weaker and weaker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it looks like you friend is already getting into it, it&#39;s just a matter of time before you will join her, officer Mark.&quot; Jenkins said with a grin as he nodded to the guards. &quot;Keep an eye on them, let&#39;s let our new draft horses finish their transformations. Pay more attention on the male, he&#39;s fighting back so it will be funny to watch him giving up.&quot;<br />
<br />
He got up and undid the bindings on the female officer, Georgina. She turned and fell onto all fours as her bones shifted, keeping her on all fours as she adjusted her growing tail to reveal her now equine vagina as it winked at him. &quot;Ohhh... take me you stud, breed me, I want to carry your foals!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark hesitated continuously as his new animal instincts were trying to overrode his human inhibitions. &quot;I must fight... I won&#39;t be an animal!!&quot; He was struggling a lot as he tried to ignore his growing horniness. &quot;I&#39;m a police man... Not a horny beast!!&quot; He looked down at his cock and he noticed in horror that it already looked equine with it&#39;s flared tip and was growing larger. His new instincts demanded that he take and breed this mare, but he was fighting against them. The attendants noticed and decided to tempt him, so they moved up Georgina in front of him and forced him to press the tip of his new long cock against her vagina. He was desperately trying to contain himself but she wasn&#39;t and the developing mare let her new equine vagina being penetrated as she moaned loudly.<br />
<br />
The attendants grinned as they watched the transformations start to speed up. Georgina&#39;s breasts retreated into her body as her new teats formed between her legs and her chest barreled out. Her hair turned into a mane and more hair grew on her tail and around her new hooves, her body being covered with white fur as she turned into a draft horse.<br />
<br />
Mark was disgusted watching how his partner turns into a beast but it was also turning him on. His was transformation were accelerating too as he got more weight, a mane and pointy ears. The attendants knew there&#39;s no need to keep him tied up so they undid his bindings. Mark&#39;s body has changed so much that he no longer could stay on his hind legs and when he tried to stand up he fell on Georgina&#39;s back like a normal stud will do when it&#39;s mating. He tried to get free from her but it was becoming more and more difficult as he became bigger and lost mobility in his limbs. Meanwhile, his new animal urges made him unconsciously thrust faster and deeper into her, her human moans becoming inhuman neighs as her neck stretched out and her face started to push out into a muzzle.<br />
<br />
Mark unwittingly joined her in neighing as his animal mind took control of him and he thrust faster, his now full-sized horse cock slamming into her as his balls swelled with horse seed and pendulumed, slapping against her backside. He has finally given up as tears moved through his growing muzzle. He had lost his humanity, his decency and freedom and a little spark of himself was still watching it through those black horse eyes. The two former officers continued mating, their new animal instincts had completely overwhelmed them as Mark&#39;s human mind was letting out pathetic whimpers. It finally came to an end as he shoved his entire shaft into her one last time as his balls churned and massive amounts of his seed poured out into her, filling her womb as she clamped down on his cock and drew out as much of it as she could.<br />
<br />
With that, the former police officers were completely gone, leaving simply draft in their place. Mark&#39;s last bits of humanity were still fighting despite he has lost full control of his body as he pulled out of her and watched their mixed juices dripping out of her vagina and his equine cock tip. He can recognize they were now just draft horses as Georgina nuzzled him gently, he felt a little bit sad for her as he realized her mind was completely gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go, that wasn&#39;t so bad, officer Mark, was it?&quot; Jenkins asked with a grin as he patted Mark&#39;s long neck. He wanted to do something but right now his body control was completely taken by his animal side. &quot;You&#39;ll both be welcomed in our stables I&#39;m sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
He walked off as men came to take the two draft horses away. Georgina doesn&#39;t mind but Mark has a perpetual sadness in his eyes. Now Jenkins just had to figure out what to do with his former boss, perhaps he could finally make good on &quot;her&quot; promise to alleviate Princess&#39; heat. Then again there were other mares who needed attention too, and Alan and Megan had been causing problems.<br />
<br />
He had a lot to do, and knew that he now had to get this placed filled up. It was just a matter of figuring out how.</p>
