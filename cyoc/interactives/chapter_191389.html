<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim Bruner did not exactly think that being an intern was something he was going to enjoy including on his resume. The son of a wealthy family, in fact one associated with the very same business he was presently employed by, he was presently &quot;gaining workplace experience&quot;. By which that meant working as an intern before being given a corporate position per his father&#39;s preference. Whereas most businessmen just delivered their nepotism to their sons, Ernest Bruner II, a 75 year old blueblood, had no intention of it. If his sons wanted to have power and prestige, they needed to prove they could work for it - hence, before he gave any position, he required a good four or five years of hard labor post-high school. Sure his older brothers had to do the very same thing, but that didn&#39;t mean Tim had to like it.<br />
<br />
Timothy had thought that he might be able to cruise to a cushy job or some famous sports position. He had, in high school, been a baseball player and a wrestling team star. But one bad move with his leg during an attempt during the big game to turn things around, and he was out just long enough to be replaced and see his opportunities dry up. Even so, he had largely retained his look from high school if slightly more impressive with age.<br />
<br />
Timothy was lean and muscular, a fighter more than anything despite his genteel and preppy appearance. His light brown hair was gelled back and cut short, his light blue eyes bright and gleaming. His skin was slightly tanned due to his sports experience, and he as of now wore a button up shirt and dress pants. Most of the secretaries at the corp thought he was at least handsome enough to be a fling over the weekend, though most of them maintained &quot;relationships&quot; with the higher ups.<br />
<br />
That was what was understood.<br />
<br />
The sexy secretaries could fuck around with Tim, but they spent more time with the higher ups in hopes of getting luxurious bonuses and such. Nobody really saw the &quot;relationships&quot; as monogamous, or even as very sacred. But Timothy was pretty good with how things were. Even though he had the distinct &quot;fortune&quot; of having the same girlfriend as his older brother Chad Bruner.<br />
<br />
They&#39;d had such a relationship across the years it seemed. Chad would fuck someone, and then that person ended up going to Tim after Chad ultimately moved on or got bored. He didn&#39;t get why it kept happening that way. Sometimes they&#39;d even be involved like this at the same time. Chad sure didn&#39;t mind it at all.<br />
<br />
Who, speaking of, was one of those who had asked for the lattes at this local coffee shop.<br />
<br />
As Timothy made the orders, he sighed and thought about when he might be able to get his own intern and become one of those higher ups sitting in the lounge, enjoying the perks of money and business. Ah, the lot of the middle child. &quot;Here you are, Mr. Bruner.&quot; Mr. Bruner. Being referred to so respectfully made Timothy&#39;s dick pulse. &quot;Thanks, Asim, I&#39;ll make sure and give recommendations to the higher ups for your hardwork.&quot; Nothing excited Tim more than being recognized - being respected - having people see him for what he was.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d gotten used to carrying the drinks out, so as he waited he made sure he kept his phone in his pocket, and had no distractions. Lots of drinks to deliver today. For now he briefly checked his messages. It seemed his girlfriend Lisa Fanning was down for some &quot;business&quot; in her car. Chad was probably too busy today to help her out, so it fell to the younger brother to please her. There was something twisted about both brothers having sex with the same woman, knowing it, and being okay with it...but Timothy if anything found that to make the whole occasion even more enticing.<br />
<br />
Lisa Fanning was petite, blond, and seemed like every bit the ingenue. But inside, she was every bit the femme fatale. Tim knew she was probably using her position with the family to try and get her way upward in the company...and honestly? Tim didn&#39;t even mind. He knew he was probably being used for sex, so he used her for sex right back. Fair was fair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s your drinks, Mr. Bruner.&quot; Tim fought off a boner and carried the drinks out and across the street then down and across to the corporate HQ. They handled...investment, that was what he remembered. Investment. Always profitable. Timothy strode inside and past some of the less well to do associates and interns. Whereas most got looked down on, Tim at least got to be the top of the bottom rung right now. Before he could jump up when he was 23.<br />
<br />
Once he got in the elevator, heading for the top floor, he thought about whatever him and Lisa might get up to. He wondered if she might get freaky enough to try and show their fling to Chad. Just to show big brother what little brother liked to do in the sack. He wouldn&#39;t put it past her. A wry smirk showed on Tim&#39;s face as he walked out into the lobby on the 23rd floor of corporate HQ.<br />
<br />
And here were some of the higher ups getting ready for a meeting - hence why they required the lattes. <br />
<br />
&quot;And here&#39;s baby brother with the save!&quot; Chad walked over and picked out his drink. &quot;You&#39;re a lifesaver, Timmy-Tims...&quot; He leaned down and whispered, &quot;Now give Lisa a dicking she&#39;ll never forget.&quot; To his credit, Tim briefly blushed at the explicit sexual reference - but he calmed his flushed face and simply nodded. Chad...was Chad, as always. He thought there might be something, some element of a lack of filter in him. Chad was always so candid and unembarrassed by nearly anything.<br />
<br />
Whereas Tim at 20 was lean, 32 year old Chad was heavily built - though not exactly wholly muscle. His midsection was a solid wall of fat and muscle, his pecs pushed out his shirt and necessitated keeping quite a few buttons open on his shirt, showing his bare skin that betrayed the constant waxes Chad had done to be rid of body hair. His dress pants were tighter than Tim&#39;s, showing his well developed quads and thighs. Chad&#39;s huge shoulders strained his button up, and his biceps and triceps filled out the sleeves almost too much. Not much tone though, and Chad&#39;s naturally handsome looks were slightly marred by some jowls that lent a slight softness at the edges. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looking good today, Timmy, you worked out yesterday?&quot; Ah that voice...<br />
<br />
&quot;Every day.&quot; Tim said confidently to Eric Pryce. Eric was the modern corporate type in many ways. 25, openly gay, very computer savvy, and capable, Eric was well built and toned, his face moisturized and clean. His hair seemed to be dyed blond, and his eyes were hazel colored. He was the most tan in the building. Eric usually flirted a bit with Tim, which he didn&#39;t honestly mind - he just ignored it as he was not interested. After all, only a low class man gets worked up over something like that!<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for the lattes, Tim. You&#39;re doing great lately!&quot; And that was the always polite and responsible Gabriel Ellsworth. 42 years old, in reasonably good shape, and with tight, well coiffed black hair, dark blue eyed Gabriel Ellsworth gave the impression of a more respectable sort of businessman. He was strongly built, but never really showed it, and unlike the preening preppies associated with his father, Gabriel didn&#39;t really manscape or maintain that ripped, &quot;Bateman&quot; aesthetic. Perhaps he just accepted he was getting older.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to hit the gym later?&quot; Malcolm Holliston was a British young man, 28, who was the most recent addition to the board. He desperately tried to keep from showing his British accent, probably wanting to seem more &quot;like an American&quot;. He had dirty blond hair, a well muscled body, and was slightly shorter than Chad - six foot one versus six foot three respectively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sure, after work?&quot; Timothy saw no reason to deny Malcolm that opportunity. He figured it was a good opportunity to sweeten up his relationship with another higher up and make his own ascent when he reached that age of 23 all the easier. You don&#39;t after all make your way up by making enemies, Timothy considered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it.&quot; Malcolm smiled, and Timothy wondered if that was a wink. Whereas he knew most of the sexualities of those on the board due to researching them, Malcolm was a...mystery. He seemed fluid, changing, continuously shifting preferences. Tim knew he liked blondes and red heads, but at the same time, Malcolm got really flirty with him sometimes, only to them insist he wasn&#39;t gay or anything. Tim just shrugged and set the drinks down, figuring the rest of the higher ups would be by soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, see you guys later.&quot; Timothy started heading for the elevator, and by the time he got on there to head down to see Lisa for their little sexual adventure in her car, he had no idea what he had just unleashed in the board room.</p>
