<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With some trepidation, professional therapist Frances Twist approached Yvette Smith&#39;s room. Frances knew the rogue were-vixen was in custody and handcuffed to her bed to prevent another escape attempt, yet she couldn&#39;t figure out why Yvette asked to see her specifically.<br />
&lt;i&gt;Might as well get this over with,&lt;i&gt; thought Frances, while showing her ID to the guard posted outside Yvette&#39;s hospital room. The court had ordered a whole slew of tests in an attempt to see if there was a medical or psychological reason for her fixation on William Anderson, which caused the rogue to change him into a werefox against his will, in hopes that the two would form a bond mate and live &quot;happily forever after&quot;.<br />
<br />
As Frances walked in, she noted that the odor was so strong, even a normal human could smell all the pheromones flooding the room, as Yvette looked up and said, &quot;Oh good. You&#39;re here,&quot; with a genuine smile on her face. The lower half of her body was covered with a blanket, and Frances could see that her free arm was somewhere underneath it.<br />
Puzzled, Frances went right to the matter at hand and asked, &quot;What did you want to see me about?&quot;<br />
Yvette looked directly at her and asked, &quot;What&#39;s it like?&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s what like?&quot; Frances asked in return, not knowing what the rogue was referring to.<br />
&quot;Being a lesbian,&quot; said Yvette.<br />
<br />
Not knowing what to make of her inquiry, Frances wondered, &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
As her arm kept moving under the blanked, Yvette said, &quot;I think I have become bi, if not an outright lesbian.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; asked Frances, wondering what Yvette&#39;s game might be.<br />
&quot;When the guards first woke me up in the hospital safe room, I had all these weird thoughts running through my head.&quot;<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
&quot;Despite my feelings from before, I wound up having a wonderful time with Jenny Harper, exploring the pleasures and sensations one woman can bestow upon another. In the end, I gave at least as good as I got, if not better,&quot; said Yvette proudly. &quot;But as the guards escorted me back here, I kept thinking, <i>what the hell have I done?</i> Yet now...&quot;<br />
&quot;Want to talk about it?&quot; asked Frances.<br />
<br />
&quot;I freely admit that I changed that poor girl only in hopes of getting the police off my trail. I was hoping they couldn&#39;t tell the difference between one were-vixen or another; although the fact it turns out that not only do we share a class together, but that William Anderson is our instructor, is purely coincidental.&quot;<br />
&quot;Go on,&quot; said Frances, noticing that Yvette didn&#39;t refer to her next door neighbor as <i>my William</i>.<br />
&quot;I also freely admit that at first, I wanted nothing to do with completing Jenny Harper. I had no interest in that life style, and didn&#39;t want to do... it; but I also didn&#39;t want a potential murder charge hanging over my head if the worst did happen. But now—&quot; said Yvette, as Frances saw her physically shudder.<br />
&quot;Go on,&quot; Frances encouraged her, wondering what this was all leading to.<br />
&quot;Now,despite how straight I was before this morning, I can&#39;t help thinking about women. The way they walk, the softness of their curves, the tenderness of their caresses, the sweetness of their kisses, the taste of their breasts and pussies...&quot; said Yvette, as she shuddered again.<br />
Then she pulled her left arm out from underneath the blanket, brought her hand to her face, and started licking her fingers even as Yvette resumed her were-vixen form once more.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like... I had no idea what I had been foolishly ignoring all my life, and now I can&#39;t get enough of it,&quot; admitted Yvette, after she finished licking her paw. &quot;Up to now, I always thought I needed a man to complete me. Mom raised me as a single parent the best she could, so there was never a true father or even a father figure in my life. Yet now, I can&#39;t help thinking that maybe my missing mate should be someone of my own gender. Do you think I&#39;ll ever find somebody <i>that</i> special, the way you and the Town Chancellor have each other?&quot; Yvette asked hopefully, even as she stuck her furry limb back under the covers.<br />
<br />
Wondering what her response would be, Frances asked, &quot;What about William Anderson?&quot;<br />
Without missing a beat, or a moment of self pleasure, Yvette replied, &quot;I will always have a spot soft for him. Maybe when the time comes, he&#39;d still be willing to sire my kits, because children are the one thing two women can&#39;t have together without outside help. But every moment that my thoughts grow stronger towards other women, my lust and desires for him are dying. I never should have forced myself upon him, or any other man. Do you think there&#39;s something wrong with me now, or was there something wrong with me before that&#39;s finally been fixed?&quot; she asked, posing the question more as a curiosity than a grave concern.<br />
&quot;Hard to say,&quot; was Frances&#39; only reply, noting that Yvette&#39;s voice now seemed to be taking on a happier, more care free tone, the more she discussed her allegedly changing feelings towards other women. &quot;Do you have a specific woman in mind?&quot;<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, no,&quot; said Yvette, sadly. &quot;Hopefully someday I&#39;ll find that special someone, and that she can forgive my past sins and accept me for who I am now, or whatever I&#39;m becoming.&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you becoming?&quot; asked Frances.<br />
<br />
&quot;I honestly don&#39;t know,&quot; admitted Yvette, even as she shuddered in self pleasure again. &quot;Hopefully a much better person than I was. I am definitely now at least bi, if not an outright lesbian. But the way my feelings and desires for a woman&#39;s company and pleasure are growing...&quot;<br />
&quot;What about Jennifer Harper?&quot; asked Frances.<br />
&quot;Jenny?&quot; asked Yvette in return, with a smile on her muzzle. &quot;I&#39;ll always be eternally grateful that she showed me the error of my ways, and if she would ever like to get together for a little fun now and then, I wouldn&#39;t say no. But she&#39;s bonded to her fiance, and I&#39;m not stupid enough to attempt breaking up a happy couple ever again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances asked Yvette a couple of more questions, then promised to visit again before leaving the room.<br />
Outside, she advised the guard on duty to monitor Yvette&#39;s visitors, especially the females, and to make sure the ventilation in her hospital room was working properly.<br />
<i>If this is an act, it&#39;s a damn good one,</i>Frances thought to herself, as she walked to the area nursing station.<br />
There, Frances showed the nurse on duty the plastic copy of her medical ID that she always carried with her, and asked what tests had already been performed on Yvette Smith, and when.<br />
The nurse presented Frances with a list of all the blood work and toxicological exams performed, with all samples having been drawn while Yvette was unconscious, before she went into the hospital&#39;s safe room to complete Jenny&#39;s transformation and induction into were society.<br />
Frances then used her authority as a doctor to have all those tests performed again, &quot;and I would like a copy of the results from both this morning and this afternoon&#39;s exams sent to my office upon completion, please.&quot;<br />
&quot;Certainly Doctor Twist. Is there anything wrong?&quot; asked the nurse on duty.<br />
&quot;I honestly don&#39;t know, but would like to find out,&quot; admitted Frances.<br />
<br />
Then, just as Frances was about to leave, two plain clothes detectives walked up to the nurses&#39; station, showed the on duty nurse their badges, and asked to see Yvette Smith.</p>
