<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>True Ending</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mikey slid onto the couch and gently kissed his partner on the neck. Tony looked up from the book he was reading.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our friends will be here soon&quot; chided Tony.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can be quick&quot; assured Mikey<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but I don&#39;t want to have to explain fresh jizz stains on the curtain-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was one time-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You say one time I say five blasts&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you rather I be horny and uncontrollably rubbing up against you in front of all our guests?&quot; Mikey challenged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess that is a fair point&quot; Tony agreed.<br />
<br />
He closed his book and leaned over to kiss his husband when they were interrupted by a loud ringing noise. The two pulled apart and looked around for the source of the interruption. It wasn&#39;t the ring of any of their phones or the doorbell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that the fire alarm?&quot; asked Mikey<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not coming from the kitchen, it&#39;s in here somewhere&quot;<br />
<br />
The source was tracked to one of the drawers of the TV cabinet. Inside the Chronivac was chirping and vibrating.<br />
<br />
A message flashed on the screen.<br />
NOTIFICATION: Your free Chronivac trial will expire at midnight 3 days from now, Visit www.transdemlabs.com/chronivac to inquire about reactivation or upgrade<br />
WARNING: At the end of this trial period any applied alterations will become PERMANENT! Any initiated alterations still in the transitional phase will be completed and become PERMANENT!<br />
<br />
Tony clicked OK which stopped the ringing and revealed a ticking timer on the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
Warning Deactivation In: 76 Hours 57 minutes 23 seconds<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of free trial lasts *fifteen* years!?&quot; exclaimed Tony incredulously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well considering they can reverse aging, it&#39;s probably nothing to the inventors&quot; explained Mikey, &quot;I&#39;ve researched them, only the randomly chosen people who receive a free Chronivac trial are eligible to purchase a subscription and only after they review your usage history to see if you&#39;ve been responsible. It ensures they&#39;re not all owned by the richest, most powerful people, and there aren&#39;t so many floating around that the world falls into complete chaos. Also the renewal cost triples every time so you don&#39;t have to worry about rich immortals slowly taking over the world&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can they know the person they send it to will be able to afford it after fifteen years?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I think they gamble on the recipient using the Chronivac to make money.&quot; Mikey theorized. &quot;It&#39;s a high but unsteady revenue stream, on the one hand the user could become a star athlete, a supermodel or a famous writer. It can&#39;t make them smarter, but it can make them more focused and motivated. On the other hand the user might just use it to change the size of his cock&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Har Har. Can we afford to reactivate ours?&quot; questioned Tony<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if we dipped into our savings,&quot; calculated Mikey &quot;we&#39;d have to go on a tight budget for a few years but we could probably reactivate ours without going broke&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to destroy it all those years ago,&quot; pondered Tony. &quot;I like using it but I think I can live without it, How about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, we use it a fair bit,&quot; thought Mikey &quot;...but I don&#39;t think we rely on it enough to risk our financial security. And as much as I dreamed of being football star in College, I don&#39;t feel like making any drastic career changes&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what should we do?&quot; asked Tony<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm just ignore it, I guess we could send it back to them if it&#39;s just going to sit around de-activated, but if we change our minds-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I mean, how do we want our dicks to be for the rest of our lives?&quot; clarified Tony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... um...well what ever you want for your dick is fine with me,&quot; thought Mikey &quot;you can decide for my dick too for that matter&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, hold up this isn&#39;t like choosing what&#39;s for dinner!&quot; exclaimed Tony, &quot;You can&#39;t just put that decision entirely on me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; grinned Mikey &quot;You use my cock more than I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
They were interrupted by a knock at the door and the discussion was put on hold.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Over the next two days there was an unspoken tension in the air, neither wanted to discuss how to decide on the permanent form their penis would take. During that time their dicks remained in their original unaltered forms, knowing it was possible they&#39;d never see it again. They both took a day off for their anniversary and agreed to enjoy their last time with the Chronivac to fuck as much as they could from sunrise to midnight.<br />
<br />
Tony awoke on their anniversary to the sensation of gentle fondling on his tiny dick. A breakfast tray sat on his bedside table when he blinked his eyes open. He looked down to see his lover on his knees beside the bed slowly stroking along what little shaft Tony had with just his index finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning to you too&quot; Tony greeted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I just couldn&#39;t wait,&quot; Mikey explained &quot;I want to spend as much time with this magnificent morsel before we start playing with the Chronivac again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? I never saw the appeal of my little cock&quot; remarked Tony, his dick nonetheless twitching at Mikey&#39;s compliment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it&#39;s just a matter of taste,&quot; smirked Mikey, &quot;I have good taste and you don&#39;t&quot; he engulfed Tony&#39;s small hard-on whole, and gave it several twirls with his tongue tasting every inch.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see if you feel about my taste when I get my mouth on your cock&quot; Tony jested through waves of pleasure. He peered over the edge of the bed to see Mikey sporting an erection even smaller than Tony&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Wheres my breakfast sausage!&quot; Tony protested in mock anger.<br />
<br />
Mikey withdrew with a smile &quot;I figured we&#39;d start small, I want you to enjoy the appetizers before the main course&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You woke up early just to beat me to the Chronivac didn&#39;t you?&quot; Tony jokingly accused.<br />
<br />
&quot;The early bird gets the worm,&quot; Mikey quipped. &quot;Eat up, I&#39;m not letting you out of bed until you finish breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Conceding to being outwitted, Tony took the tray of bacon, eggs and toast. Mikey&#39;s hand and mouth continued to slowly and sensually caress Tony&#39;s small cock. He was no longer a uncontrollable premature ejaculator he was in their youth, but he was by no means a stallion of stamina. Mikey&#39;s affectionate handling and admiration of Tony&#39;s little cock was one of his weaknesses. Every few minutes when Tony was starting to build up to the edge, Mikey would take the little penis out of his mouth to remark on about how wonderful his tiny dick was. This never failed to send a shudder of delight through Tony&#39;s body, sometimes causing him to release a droplet of precum. The meal was scarfed down as quickly as could be done between quivers of pleasure. Tony set aside the tray and tried to get up but Mikey&#39;s hand was placed on his chest and gently held him in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m nearly done here, let me enjoy this gorgeous little penis just a bit longer&quot; Mikey pleaded as his thumb and forefinger teasingly brought Tony ever closer to orgasm.<br />
<br />
A groan escaped Tony&#39;s mouth as he fell back, unable to resist his partner&#39;s manipulations. A dribble of precum moistened his Mikey&#39;s fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Tony,&quot; Mikey assured him &quot;I&#39;ll just need a bit more time&quot;<br />
<br />
After another few minutes the sensitivity in his small cock was reaching peak intensity, Tony could scarcely handle much more. Sensing this, Mikey ceased leisurely savoring Tony&#39;s tiny penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for waiting,&quot; he smiled &quot;lets make this marvelous little dick cum&quot;, and engulfed Tony&#39;s modest member, earnestly bringing Tony&#39;s tiny cock past the point of no return. <br />
<br />
The pressure which had been gradually building, instantly rushed past boiling point and by the time Tony was moments from climax he was openly weeping with joy and ecstasy. Semen burst forth like a geyser from his tiny erection, continuously shooting it&#39;s way down Mikey&#39;s eager throat. After what seemed like an eternity, Tony came down from his bliss, still unable to stop the tears streaming from his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for sharing your tiny dick with me Tony.&quot; Mikey expressed with deep sincerity, as he deliberately milked out the last few droplets of cum with his fingers. &quot;It was perfect&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-thank you Mikey&quot; Tony blubbered, his face blushing with embarrassment at how emotionally he was reacting. The tears were wiped from his eyes as he tried to compose himself, unsure how to respond to Mikey&#39;s loving sincerity. Mikey sensed Tony&#39;s embarrassment and gave the shriveled head of Tony&#39;s soft wet penis one last tender kiss before standing up. Then wearing his most nonchalant expression he looked Tony in the face, waggled his own altered micropenis and in the most casual tone he could muster asked;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where should I put this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony snorted a laugh, eyes still glistening and reached over to take his lover&#39;s penis.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
For the rest of the day and evening they were enthralled in a marathon of (figuratively) animalistic intercourse. They brought each other to orgasm multiple times, using the Chronivac to keep them in a state of constant arousal and their balls filled with semen. Over their fifteen years together every time they had a Chronivac session, they made a preset as a keep sake. They went through the various alteration they had performed. All day their penises transformed becoming thick, thin, long, short, and everything in between. Dozens of combinations were made of who had what penis and where it went.<br />
<br />
An hour before midnight both men were exhausted. They lied on the bed drenched in bodily fluids, their penises in the original preset Tony had made on their first day at College. The Chronivac was sitting on top of Tony&#39;s semen coated chest as it rose and fell in heavy breaths. Tony peeled the dripping Chronivac off himself and sat up, joined shortly later by Mikey.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we can&#39;t hold off figuring out what we want to do any longer&quot; Mikey stated catching his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;ve been thinking about what you said&quot; Tony mused still panting heavily &quot;I do use your cock more than you. But you also use mine more than me. So maybe we should decide for each other&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...That seems fair&quot; hesitated Mikey. &quot;Let&#39;s take some time to think about what we want yea?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey took a shower and a walk to clear his head. He made it back ten minutes before midnight, Tony was sitting on the bed, freshly showered but still naked. His limp 7 inch penis was hanging off the edge of the mattress,<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok... you do me first Tony&quot; Mikey offered as he stripped off, revealing a soft one inch nub.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way,&quot; argued Tony &quot;How do I know you wont choose based on my decision just to make us more compatible&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I know you wont?&quot; retorted Mikey as he sat next to Tony on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; affirmed Tony &quot;we&#39;ll load our options into a preset, then activate both at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony input his settings and gave the Chronivac to Mikey who then did the same.<br />
<br />
Warning Deactivation In: 6 minutes 2 seconds<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok... ready?&quot; Mikey asked with his thumb poised over the apply button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whenever you are&quot; Tony responded as he reached out the hold Mikey&#39;s other hand.<br />
<br />
A moment passed, tears began to form in Mikey&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mikey are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tony...I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t go through with this.&quot; lamented Mikey &quot;I trust you to decide the form of my penis but I can&#39;t bring myself to control yours. I know you&#39;ve forgiven me completely but I&#39;m still ashamed of the way I use to make you feel about your cock. I&#39;ll never be comfortable with any choice I make because I&#39;ll never know if you&#39;re really 100% content with your own penis, and I&#39;ll always blame myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony took a moment to let that sink in, he knew Mikey well enough to know there would be no way to sway him. &quot;Well if that&#39;s the way you feel then I can&#39;t pick yours either, maybe we should just decide for ourselves?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that what it takes...&quot; Mikey accepted, offering him the Chronivac &quot;Ok... you change first&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Tony &quot;How do I know-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay okay,&quot; interrupted Mikey smiling &quot;Lets not go through that again&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey saved his attributes into a new preset and handed the Chronivac to Tony who put in his as the screen timer continued to go down. They were both honest with their preferred attributes, knowing their parter would easily see through any deception.<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;We&#39;re running out of time, lets do this&quot; Mikey urged as he reached out for Tony&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
Tony grabbed hold of Mikey&#39;s hand and took a deep breath &quot;Here we go...&quot;<br />
<br />
*Tap*...*Tap* *Tap*...Tap* *Tap* *Tap*-<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; asked Mikey<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck...FUCK,&quot; Tony swore &quot;I think there&#39;s dried jizz stuck in the apply button, it won&#39;t click!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony let go of Mikey&#39;s hand and tried to pushing down hard with both his thumbs accidentally nudging a few other buttons in the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down! You&#39;re pressing other stuff now&quot; Mikey panicked &quot;Hang on what&#39;s it that say on the screen!&quot;<br />
<br />
SHUFFLE: One of your presets will be selected at random and applied, are you sure you want to do this? Press Shuffle again to confirm.<br />
Warning Deactivation In: 59 seconds<br />
<br />
An idea sparked in Mikey&#39;s head<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick!&quot; Mikey urged &quot;Press shuffle again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No way!&quot; refused Tony &quot;That&#39;s insane!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It might apply the preset we just put in!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if we get one of the stupid ones!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We only have a few of those, this is our only chance!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got dozens of presets in here! The odds of getting one specific preset...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey took a deep breath and calmly took Tony by the hand again. &quot;Sorry Tony I didn&#39;t mean to push, this is entirely up to you, I&#39;m fine to stay as we are now but just know I&#39;m game if you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
They looked down at the Chronivac<br />
<br />
Warning Deactivation In: 6 seconds<br />
<br />
Tony released a roar of frustration and mashed his thumb to the button with two crossed arrows.<br />
<br />
Both men immediately began to feel the familiar tingle in their genitals. As soon as it passed the Chronivac dinged a notification. The menu was gone, in it&#39;s place was a message<br />
<br />
&quot;This device has been deactivated - Visit www.transdemlabs.com/chronivac to inquire about reactivation or upgrade&quot;<br />
<br />
They both glanced across at one another&#39;s groins, then down at their own, and finally up to meet each other&#39;s eyes. After a moment Mikey stifled a chuckle. Tony&#39;s expression started to crack into a smile. Not long after both men burst into laughter.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re probably wondering what happened. Were they laughing in triumphant success? Laughing with relief? Or perhaps laughing at their own blunder? There were over a hundred presets saved onto the Chronivac. Their original forms were in there but also many sessions which contained all ranges of big, average and small dicks on both of them. A few more unique combinations were also possible; long pencil dicks, short beer can chodes, massive testicles topped with a tiny cock, exaggerated curves, excessive foreskins and more. There was even a preset where both their stiff button boners combined couldn&#39;t match up to Tony&#39;s original micropenis when flaccid.<br />
<br />
However, branching the ending up into multiple epilogue chapters from this point would be a tremendous waste of time, because no matter what preset was chosen every outcome was the same.<br />
<br />
They both lived happily and content because size doesn&#39;t matter.</p>
