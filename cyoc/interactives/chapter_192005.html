<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Madoka Smith was in fact white. Not mixed racial unless you counted a blend of French, German, and Dutch mixed... Her parents were in fact Otaku that decided to name her after an anime character. It was the start of day and Madoka dragged herself out of bed. The 18 year old was alone in her solo dorm room. The young woman still felt she was a girl in her mind. Being 5&#39;1 and being more petite as her parents liked to say she imagined she&#39;d be good at cosplaying her namesake who was... Was she supposed to be in High school or Middle school? She had no idea, and after one Halloween night too many where she wore cosplay instead of an actual costume she decided to give up on the pink wig forever. She much preferred her own dark brown hair.<br />
<br />
After contemplating her life Madoka got up, and went to her desk and got out a piece of paper and some of her drawing tools. This was just a hobby. She was going to college for computer science and was good at it... It&#39;s just she enjoyed drawing. She&#39;d do some landscapes or something with her OC do not steal. As her pen graced the paper leaving ink trails her OC&#39;s form became more apparent. The lower form was basically a blueish jellyfish, the torso and general head was more human, but her arms were wings and her hair were feathers like you&#39;d see on a blue jay. It was little surprise that this was her imaginary friend Karen. As a little kid before she learned to despise anime... or at least her parents and anime was just collateral. Madoka had watched some anime involving jellyfish and loved the way they looked. In her backyard she&#39;d sometimes also see bluejays and the blue just called to her. So her mind kinda mashed them together and there came Karen. The drawing finished Madoka signed it &quot;Maddy Smith&quot; Maddy being the name her friends would call her, and the name she&#39;d only respond to from her parents. The only thing she didn&#39;t like about her picture of Karen was the style she had learned to use for her... More of a shojo magical girl style. She also worked with a shoenen look at times as well, but when she tried to make her in a comic book style or something western she just didn&#39;t come out looking right. Then there was the other thing about Karen. Maddy had never aged her up really. She always stayed as a kid, sometimes an older kid but always a kid. <br />
<br />
Maddy sighed as she put her drawing in a pile in her desk drawer. She didn&#39;t have classes today, and as she woke up early it was about time for lunch... She got some actual clothes on, and walked by herself the local eateries. She ordered her food by herself, got a small table, and ate alone. <br />
&quot;Hey Maddy! Maybe after this we can get some ice cream?!?&quot; said an innocent voice in Maddy&#39;s head. As Maddy ate some more she stared at the other side of the table and there was Karen... Well she wasn&#39;t actually there, but Karen was a sort of company and a good friend. Of course Maddy wouldn&#39;t respond to her mental construct physically, but she could mentally. <br />
&quot;Sorry, but I&#39;m trying to save some money right now.&quot; Maddy responded mentally. Where were her other friends you may ask? Well in elementary and preschool she had a bunch of friends, in middle school she still had a friend by the end of it after she started to get teased more often because of her name and parents, and in high school she had acquaintances that she didn&#39;t let get too close... Her in college she was a bit of a loner who took up just a little bit of space in the corner of a room. <br />
<br />
With her meal done Maddy went back to her dorm room, did some coding, and gamed for a bit. She wasn&#39;t sure she&#39;d call her online friends real friends or not, but no one would ever know she was connected to anime in any fucking way. Gaming done she just watched some youtube videos as she felt some weird force smack into her. It lasted only an instant, but the power Ty had thrown away had just entered her giving Maddy nearly unlimited power to manipulate reality in any way she saw fit... Although she didn&#39;t know that. She just thought there was a nearby draft as she wrapped a blanket around herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Today was a day.&quot; Maddy had realized. It was course work, eat, sleep, have a little bit of fun, repeat... She was sick of this anime complex, sick of feeling like a little girl... sick of not having any friends anymore. Maddy closed her eyes and wished that something would change.</p>
