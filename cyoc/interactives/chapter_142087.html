<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well!&quot; Ty smiled excitedly. &quot;I&#39;m Tyler.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleased to meet you, Tyler.&quot; The deer smiled back. &quot;And have we decided what to call me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty thought for a moment and laughed. &quot;Do you want me to name you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems appropriate. You made me, so you should get to name me. I&#39;m fine either way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right!&quot; Ty thought for a moment. &quot;I mean, it should be a good girl&#39;s name. Something pretty, but different.&quot; He thought of different names. Oddly, he kept thinking of tea. Camomile. Camille! &quot;How about Camille?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Camille chuckled a bit. &quot;If that&#39;s what you want my name to be, then that&#39;s my name.&quot; The deer took a heavy relaxed sigh and adjusted herself so that she was lying a little more comfortably. &quot;So... more changes for me, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a minute.&quot; Ty waved his hand. &quot;There&#39;s no rush. I wanted to get to know you better. Ask some questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right!&quot; Camille nodded. &quot;Shoot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty proceeded to interrogate the deer. What did she remember of her former self? What was it like being a wild animal? How old was she? How did her transformation feel? What did she want to do now that she was intelligent? What did she like? What didn&#39;t she like?<br />
<br />
It was through this conversation that Ty got to know his new friend better. Camille was equivalent to a 28 year old human and very smart after her transformation. She had a great sense of humour, and a calm motherly demeanour. She was a mine of information on forest life and the behaviour of her own kind, though almost completely ignorant of the human world. She was pretty laid back about it all and was very grateful for Ty&#39;s changes. She made it quite clear that he wouldn&#39;t tolerate hunters or guns and had a keen interest in exploring outside the forest some day.<br />
<br />
This conversation took the two of them well into the afternoon as they got to know one another. Camille took Ty around the forest and showed him lots of cool places he had never been to, including a cave, a rocky hill overlooking a wide open valley, and a waterfall that fed the stream he loved to sit by. When the time came that there was a lull in the conversation it was clear they had both taken a strong liking to one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what&#39;s the deal with your... thing? Your power?&quot; Camille finally asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still not sure.&quot; Ty sighed, and leaned back into the deer&#39;s side. &quot;I woke up this morning, like I said, and it was just there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s like... destiny. Or a higher purpose. Or a freak thing. Either way, it&#39;s special.&quot; Camille said thoughtfully. At last, the doe settled in a clearing she had visited many times and curled up by a shading tree. &quot;Feel free to come sit if you want. Anyway, see, I wonder what else you can do. We know you can change age, right? And make things like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m curious myself.&quot; Ty took the doe&#39;s offer and followed Camille to her tree. He sat down next to her and cuddled into her warm side.<br />
<br />
&quot;So? Do something to me!&quot; Camille turned her head, bumping Ty playfully with her snout and grinning. &quot;Come on, be adventurous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a dare?&quot; Ty smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, a little!&quot; The deer paused and chuckled, seeing his maker&#39;s nervousness. &quot;Look, I told you. Just don&#39;t take my new brain from me. That&#39;s my only condition, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right.&quot; Ty nodded. &quot;So... how about this.&quot; He closed his eyes and concentrated, Camille watching this process in fascination. &quot;You&#39;re going to become completely clean and free of any disease or imperfections. No ticks, or parasites. Never. Your health will be perfect from now on, you&#39;ll never be ill, be immune to all sickness, and you&#39;ll never be able to pass anything on to a human being. You&#39;ll also stay metabolically fit and healthy no matter what you eat, never gain weight, and remain strong and beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Camille stopped, shuddered, and seemed to tense for a moment. &quot;Oh, wow!&quot; She blinked in surprise and looked herself over, seeing fresh caked mud that had solidified on her stomach now gone, how her flank was leaner and less fatty, and noticing that her left back leg, once caught on a tree stump and pulled, now gave her no trouble from the sprain that had occurred some time ago. Not only that, but she felt refreshed and invigorated. Youthful. Something else. &quot;That... that felt amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did it work?&quot; Ty asked, looking over the deer and running his hand over her back, feeling how soft and plush her fur had become, not rough and greasy.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-My leg.&quot; Camille smiled, staring at Ty. &quot;I sprained my ankle once running, it&#39;s always hurt a bit. It&#39;s fine now!&quot; She brightened and flagged her tail excitedly, although Ty missed the signal that she was growing aroused. &quot;This is great! What else can you do? Keep going!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Okay!&quot; Ty thought, the two of them now standing face to face, the deer staring at the human expectantly. &quot;I guess I want you to age more slowly, so your true age will be in human years. Your lifespan will get longer. You&#39;ll last as long as a human being now, well into 80 years old, maybe 90 to 100 if you take care of yourself. Considering you&#39;ll always be fit and healthy, who knows what&#39;ll happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, Camille shuddered, and she gasped out loud. &quot;T-That&#39;s... so... so... nice of you. You want me around for a while, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot; Ty stepped in and hugged his friend&#39;s neck, pulling the animal closer to his chest. &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What else?&quot; Camille whispered softly, staring into Ty&#39;s eyes with her own, waiting. Her breathing had become subtly quicker, and her adorable little tail was pointed upward tellingly.<br />
<br />
Ty stared back into the animal&#39;s eyes and suddenly realized what he could do next. &quot;Your vision. You&#39;re still seeing black and white, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Camille&#39;s eyes widened, and she took a moment to blink and consider the very question. &quot;A-Am I? Is that bad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t see colours, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are... colours?&quot; Camille asked innocently, curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m about to rock your world, lady.&quot; Ty took a step back dramatically and grinned. &quot;Your vision is going to change next. You&#39;ll be able to see a full spectrum and range of colours the same as I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Camille shuddered again, closed her eyes as they suddenly watered and throbbed in her skull. &quot;Oh... what&#39;s happening?&quot; When she opened her eyes, they were changing. From the dull brown of an animal her iris and pupils began to grow more detailed, more beautiful. She blinked once, twice. &quot;W-What...&quot; And as her eyes changed to a deep shade of green she reeled back in shock and shook her head from side to side in disbelief. &quot;Oh... oh my...&quot; Tears welled up in the corners of her eyes and she fell down in pure overwhelmed stupor. &quot;Oh God! It&#39;s so beautiful!&quot; She openly began to weep, truly moved. &quot;It&#39;s all so beautiful! And... and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty bent down gently and caressed his friend&#39;s back, almost crying himself from how wonderful the reaction was. &quot;There. Isn&#39;t that better, girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; The deer turned and unexpectedly placed her lips on Ty&#39;s, gently kissing the human. It was just a second or so, but the sensuality, the tenderness of it... They both went wide eyed, Camille drew back, and Ty drew back.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Did you not like that?&quot; Camille seemed to turn her her away in shame.<br />
<br />
In response, adding nothing, Ty grabbed her neck, twisted her head around, and closed his eyes as he cupped the deer&#39;s soft shaggy facial fur on his hands and kissed her back. He was gentle and unsure, but eager.<br />
<br />
The doe melted, putting one of her front legs over Ty&#39;s shoulder and moaning into his lips. A pleasant vibration. He couldn&#39;t be sure if it was an effect of his power or not, but her lips were deliciously smooth and flexible. Very feminine. For a deer. Not that he had any human girls to compare it to.<br />
<br />
When they broke the kiss, Ty and Camille simply stared at each other in delighted shock. Finally, the deer gasped sheepishly and lowered her head into Ty&#39;s chest. &quot;Oh! OK!&quot; She blinked several times as something bumped her in the nose. She was touching Ty&#39;s crotch. It was swollen. It smelled good.<br />
<br />
Ty stared down at the deer with wide eyes. &quot;Uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
Camille laughed deviously, a perverted chuckle, and nudged the bulge in the teen&#39;s pants with her snout. &quot;Nevermind. I see that you liked it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty blinked nervously. He hadn&#39;t considered this. He hadn&#39;t expected this. Or willed it. It had sort of just happened. &quot;Uh, I didn&#39;t... set this up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; Camille said sweetly. &quot;It... is your birthday.&quot; She said with a chuckle. &quot;And uh, I guess I&#39;m your girlfriend now, aren&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty blushed deep red and looked down to his crotch and back at the deer. &quot;I&#39;ve never...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have.&quot; She smiled warmly. &quot;There&#39;s nothing to be embarassed about. I can teach you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re...&quot; Ty gulped nervously. &quot;And I&#39;m...&quot;<br />
<br />
Camille nuzzled his bulge again and laughed sweetly. &quot;I stopped being a deer the moment you gave me a human mind, don&#39;t you think? But if you&#39;re really opposed to the idea, you could always put me on two legs like you... or... make me human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.&quot; Ty realized. Excitement began to grow. His resistance began to shrink. &quot;So... if I like you the way you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinky.&quot; The deer chuckled, making Ty blush in mortified shame. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll let you decide what you want. If you want. Because I&#39;m more than happy to do whatever you&#39;d like to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty began to sweat with both excitement and terror.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what happens in the forest...&quot; The deer looked around and lowered her voice conspiratorially, smirking deviously. &quot;Well, you know the saying, right?&quot;</p>
