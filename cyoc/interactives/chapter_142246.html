<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, what are you waiting for? Tell me what you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
The same man from yesterday&#39;s dream bore his eyes into me. His gaze made me feel weird. Warm, lightheaded, and... What else?<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, slutty.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna be fucked like a slut! My holes are so empty! Please, sir, fuck me!&quot; I could hear myself cry out.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he stated, overwhelming me with sadness. Was I not good enough for him? &quot;I won&#39;t. But they will.&quot;<br />
<br />
He motioned to his side and suddenly Taylor and Jacob shimmered into existence. Well, it was probably them. They looked different. You wouldn&#39;t be able to guess that either of them spent years honing their muscles at the gym anymore. At best, there was a light layer of muscle on them. They looked much twinkier now and, oddly enough, they looked much hotter.<br />
<br />
Slowly, they approached me, and I felt myself instinctively drop to my hands and knees. I wanted them both so bad. I could feel my ass-- no, that word was too vulgar. I could feel my boypussy quiver in anticipation. My mouth watered as I saw their hard cocks approach. It finally dawned on me. I was going to get fucked like the slutty twink I was.<br />
<br />
All the two of them adorned were massive grins on their face, and I knew I wasn&#39;t wearing anything, so I knew my sluttiest moment yet was soon to come. The anticipation was killing me as I saw their cocks approach.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t have all day,&quot; the man said, and without warning Taylor and Jacob shoved their entire lengths into me. I nearly came in the spot. It felt like heaven. My vision blurred and I could hear myself moan out in pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feeling good boy?&quot; the man asked. I didn&#39;t want to stop sucking off Taylor, so I simply moaned and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. You look so hot like this. But there&#39;s one thing that&#39;s off,&quot; he explained. I was confused by his remark. This felt perfect. What could possibly be wrong? &quot;There&#39;s way too much going on in those eyes of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then strutted up to me and placed a hand on my head. Suddenly, I felt a major change in my body. I couldn&#39;t tell what, I just knew something massive had changed within me. &quot;You got too close to making your life boring again. Now, let&#39;s just say you&#39;re gonna have a lot more in common with Jakey here. But don&#39;t worry, he likes the change and you will, too. Right, Jakey?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob simply giggled, but I felt like I could understand him entirely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, boy, get ready,&quot; the man ordered. I could feel that both Taylor and Jacob were close. I knew that once they came in me at the same time, I&#39;d be a full on slut. I couldn&#39;t wait.<br />
<br />
Taylor&#39;s cock began twitching in my mouth and Jacob&#39;s soon followed, causing me to shiver in excitement. I&#39;m gonna be a slut!<br />
<br />
Yes, yes, yes, YES--<br />
<br />
I woke with a start, blowing my load straight down Taylor&#39;s throat. Along with the amazing feeling of cumming, I felt this weird sizzling in my head, and it felt just as great.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning!&quot; Taylor cheerfully greeted me with a wink, before cleaning off my cock. He then pulled his fingers out of my ass and licked them clean, too. &quot;Hmm, why does your ass taste like strawberries?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You... look different,&quot; I noted. It was true. Taylor had changed a lot overnight. For starters, his hair had grown fuller and more vibrant. He had a bed head, but it looked cute on him. He was also a lot skinnier than yesterday, and he&#39;d definitely gotten shorter, too. Overall, he looked hot. I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that I&#39;d seen him looking very similar to this not too long ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could say the same to you mister,&quot; he responded. Cautiously, I untangled myself from my roommate and walked over to our mirror.<br />
<br />
What the fuck?!<br />
<br />
For starters, saying that Taylor looked shorter was laughable now. I was probably at least three inches shorter than him. I had also gotten skinnier. Much skinnier. At least Taylor looked like he could be an athlete of a less intensive sport. If I told someone I had been working out for years, they&#39;d be rolling on the floor laughing. At best, my arms and legs looked lightly muscled. My six pack that I spent years perfecting was no where to be found, and all that was left was a smooth torso. It was like I had shed off an entire layer of myself, and all that was left was a soft, new exterior.<br />
<br />
The only exception, however, was my ass. I looked down to find that my butt cheeks were basically pillows and they looked even bigger now on my small frame. It was downright fuckable. Wait, no, why did I describe it like that?<br />
<br />
None of that, however, was the worst part. The worst, most obvious change that had occurred was in my hair. It didn&#39;t matter what hair color I had before. It was clearly irrelevant now. I knew from the moment I saw my new style that it had to be natural. But, was that even possible? Then again, a lot of this seemed hard to believe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d ask if the carpet matched the drapes but there&#39;s clearly no carpet anymore to compare to,&quot; Taylor joked. Walking up to me, he began fondling my dick and rubbing the small of my back soothingly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, pink hair looks good on you. It&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy for you to say. You don&#39;t have a head full of it,&quot; I retorted. I fingered my new pink hair some more. It had gotten longer, too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, you got lucky. It&#39;s clearly been styled into a fade, and you&#39;re probably  never gonna have to go get a haircut again. So, relax, no one&#39;s going to complain,&quot; Taylor stated. I instantly felt myself relax, even though I knew I didn&#39;t want to. &quot;At least, I&#39;m totally not complaining. It looks so sexy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, fine. At least, we&#39;re hopefully getting out of here today. That way, not many people will see me with this,&quot; I explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;About that, I was thinking: what if we stayed another day?&quot; Taylor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why?&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we have no idea what&#39;s going on outside. For all we know, it&#39;s gotten worse. Plus, I&#39;d miss the people here. I had a lot of fun with Jacob and Chase yesterday. You know you did, too,&quot; Taylor countered. I knew that I did, but my dramatic changes had startled me too much to feel okay. Plus, it was clear that Taylor had a dramatic change of heart since yesterday, and that scared me even more.<br />
<br />
I was about to try to counter his point when I heard a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Food&#39;s here!&quot; A loud voice chirped. I could hear some giggling coming from outside right after. Something seemed off about it though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Taylor, don&#39;t!&quot; I yelled, but it was too late. Without thinking, the redhead opened the door. There, two men stood, cocks out and proud, with smirks on their faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turns out the delivery service isn&#39;t coming, so we decided to share whatever protein we&#39;ve got with the rest of the dorm,&quot; the man explained, slowly jacking himself off. &quot;You want breakfast?&quot;<br />
<br />
My mouth watered.</p>
