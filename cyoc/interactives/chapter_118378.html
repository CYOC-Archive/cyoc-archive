<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">she went over to her computer and turned it on as she soon began typing, but she looked in shock as she saw what she was typing that the animal she was searching for when she hit enter in horror was none other then a goat on her image search. she shuddered while trying to stop herself as Hundreds of pictures of various Ungulates, from farm goats to mountain goat rams, but the first pictures she first saw to come up was a image of something that would come out of an anime. she was always into anime, but she didn&#39;t think this to happen to her in a time like this that she got a good look at it before shutting off the computer. <br />
<br />
Jen felt herself get up as her body forced her to walk, strolling quickly over to her bed and lay down. her head began to swell as she felt her changes swiftly beginning that the first thing Jen noticed was her ears that they enlargened, fanning out and moving to the corners of her head while Jen groaned to the movement of her new ears. She could feel them twitch in every way that she herd whirring of the fans in her computer that it was temporarily distracting her as her changes progressed.<br />
<br />
She felt a slight tingle as her face was being pushed out that she cried as the changes were being forced upon her, but as she did is when her cries grew deeper and more animal like. she soon no longer sounded like a girl, but a talking goat as she was baaing out of uncontrollably while struggling against the increasing weight of her new head. black fur started to grow all over her face while covering her blossoming muzzle. her eyes shifted to the sides of her head, but her vision remarkably didn&#39;t change as her her field of view may be better that she now lacked one of the 3 cones in her eyes.<br />
<br />
Her new snout was starting to finish growing in that her new tongue now started to expanded in her mouth that she huffed through her nose. Her ears finished migrating to the top of her head as her eyes finished changing position that Jen then felt her final changes commence, her new horns were growing in! She felt two sharp pains as they erupted from her skull, quickly going through all of the stages as they grow in that they were now part of her skull. she then remembered that the only horns to fall off of the animals head were antlers horns as they grow back once they fall off and not skull horns as they stay on, forever.<br />
<br />
When they finished, she was left with two quite large horns, but they didn&#39;t stretched as wide as her shoulders that they added between 2-3 feet to her 5&#39;7&quot; height. She could see the damage of her changes as she was laying on the bed while looking at her mirror. their weight seemed to straining her neck when she tried to lift her head as it was then that her neck lengthen slightly, adapting to her to her goat head by creating a merger between her human and goat parts as it felt more like a mane. her neck was now half goat, and half human as the image poped back into her head again.<br />
<br />
<br />
the head of a goat, connected to the body of a 145lbs. girl that her chest heaved more then three times as her new nose practically forced in and out as much air into her lungs while she struggled against her new head. shaking a bit as she tried to move it, but she couldn&#39;t budge the colossal weight that her neck strained her again. She tried again and her head tilted to her left that she baaed as her muzzle fell against the bed. the soft sheets was giving her the indication of just how large her new head was that she cried out uncontrollably as tears were coming out of her while her right eye darted around the room, taking in the increase field of vision. she struggled to even lift her head that she had to use her two hands to study herself till sh got use of her new head of a goat.<br />
<br />
then, she felt her body shifting as she moaned that her body felt muscle were being added, her breasts Shrank as she soon stopped gulping for air, almost as if they weren&#39;t there. once the changes were done that she had a hold of herself as she look back into the mirror. now nearly an eight foot tall woman that her body was large even by male standards as her breasts had shrunk to almost double a cup size, but they looked completely natural while Jen huffed as she could be mistaken as a man.<br />
<br />
She looked in the mirror once more as she saw her final form. from her manly curvy body, to her horns with the head of a male that to be honest with herself, she thought she look weather nice as she is. she almost looked like a male jock from her last school year as she thought that maybe she could pull it off as one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least I like the looks of things.&quot; Jen said as she was taken aback about her voice that her voice was much more deeper, and harsh than what she was used to. Jen was still clothed as her her surrounding seemed to normal enough, but something about her had changed that she apparently was no longer a cheerleader, but a butler.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... lets see what else has changed.&quot; Jen huffed as she was done looking at her reflection. Just as she was about to ducked out her bedroom door that she heard the phone ring again. picking it up to answer who it was that it was....</p>
