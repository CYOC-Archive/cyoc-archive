<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ok. That&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Finn said. His breathing grew a bit haggard as his claws dug right back into Jeff&#39;s thigh. &quot;But I wanna talk to someone else first. Alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Jeff&#39;s eyebrow raised. &quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dylan...&quot; Finn muttered quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;DYLAN!!&quot; Jeff roared. The depth of his voice echoed off the lockers. Finn flinched at the sound, causing Jeff to try his best to calm down. &quot;What the fuck do you have to tell that pompous know it all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just that we&#39;re dating...&quot; Finn added, voice shaking as he did so.<br />
<br />
Jeff tried to make his anger simmer. Even before he&#39;d transformed himself, he hated Dylan. How someone like Finn could ever get along with a guy like that, he didn&#39;t know. Jeff could remember times where Dylan would follow Jeff around like a lost puppy, but other than that, they didn&#39;t have anything in common. &quot;Shit...&quot; he grumbled, realizing that Finn was no longer a football stud and now did have something in common with the loser.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine!&quot; Finn misunderstood the expletive. &quot;I promise. He&#39;s just been making all kinds of hints and I just want to let him down face to face. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Jeff&#39;s arms crossed against his chest. &quot;When should we meet him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Finn held up a finger. Jeff felt his fur raise. &quot;I think I should go myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s hackles raised even higher. He snarled, showing off his massive tiger teeth. &quot;Yourself?!&quot; he raised his voice again. His fingers flexed in anger, really showing off his sharp claws. Seeing Finn flinch again, he tried to keep an even head. But even with the one word, his anger was obvious. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just to let him down easy. You know?&quot; Finn shrugged.<br />
<br />
Jeff rolled his eyes. His arms were still crossed against his massive chest. &quot;Fine,&quot; he growled. &quot;Just don&#39;t do anything stupid...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t!&quot; Finn jumped in for a hug, burying his face in Jeff&#39;s fur covered abs. &quot;Promise!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh...&quot; Jeff nodded, gently giving a hug back.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo! What&#39;s up big guy!&quot; Dylan walked into the stands of the pool area. &quot;Why did you want to meet up here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn felt butterflies fill his stomach. Confrontation was always so hard. And now he was actually going to have to do it. &quot;I--I uh... I just wanted to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay..?&quot; Dylan sat down next to him on the bleachers, looking skeptically as Finn gripped his phone for dear life. He looked back down at the college swim team doing drills. Each of the lanes in the pool had at least three guys in it and they were all doing freestyle laps. &quot;And here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm... Well... It&#39;s just this is kind of where we used to always talk and it&#39;s where you came out to me. And so... IjustwantedtosayI&#39;mgay,&quot; Finn ran through the words because there was no way they were going to come out if he hadn&#39;t. His eyes slowly raised back up to meet Dylan&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No...&quot; Dylan&#39;s sarcasm was palpable. &quot;You&#39;re gay? I wouldn&#39;t have ever guessed...&quot; Finn felt his face burn red as Dylan continued. &quot;I mean it&#39;s not like you just stare at nearly every guy who passes you. Hmmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know...&quot; Finn felt himself curl up a bit, squirming under the verbal attack.<br />
<br />
Dylan didn&#39;t let the silence stay long. &quot;So does that mean you finally want to go on a date?&quot; He was quick to get on top of Finn. It wasn&#39;t hard as the anthrofox was quite a bit smaller than everyone else. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I-I-I have a boyfriend,&quot; Finn sputtered out. &quot;J-Jeff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan clenched his teeth. Anger filled his eyes, but he tried to stay calm. &quot;Oh,&quot; he sat back down on the bench. &quot;Who&#39;s Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a change in the dialogue. Dylan was clearly holding back as he asked the question. But it was also pretty obvious who Jeff was. &quot;He&#39;s a football player. Me and my dad would go to his house and watch football every week. That&#39;s kind of how we met.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I see?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Sure,&quot; Finn pulled out his phone and opened up the photos app. A picture of Jeff flexing his black and white furred muscles filled the screen. Dylan took it out of his hands and continued flipping through the photos. Jeff went through several different poses showing off his larger-than-life body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it the furry thing or the muscles?&quot; Dylan demanded. He flashed the phone at Finn. A picture of Jeff doing a double bicep pose in a blue poser filled the screen. The tiger&#39;s massive dick filled the small cloth covering. &quot;Or something else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what?!&quot; Finn felt his face burn again. Dylan sighed, giving him a look. &quot;It&#39;s not just that. We have a lot in common!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like?&quot; Dylan asked, probing Finn for an answer. In the three seconds allotted, he decided to go for the answers himself. He exited out of the photo app, going for the messages app. However, he paused. The Chronivac was still open. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY!&quot; Finn snatched his phone back.<br />
<br />
Dylan&#39;s anger softened as interest quickly took over. Finn never acted this way. He was always so soft and malleable. &quot;What was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Finn held his phone tighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what?&quot; a devilish smile filled Dylan&#39;s mouth along with some laughter. His fingers were looking awfully grabby as he stared at Finn. <br />
<br />
Finn let out a sigh. He knew Dylan wouldn&#39;t give up until he told him. &quot;It&#39;s something called The Chronivac. It lets me change reality however I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan&#39;s face twisted in confusion. He thought it was going to be some of Finn&#39;s nudes. &quot;What.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nevermind. Don&#39;t worry about it. I shouldn&#39;t have said anything,&quot; Finn tried to get up. But Dylan blocked his exit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait. Are you for real?&quot; Dylan asked. Finn nodded. &quot;Like, for real for real?&quot; Dylan repeated. A bit of excitement filled his voice. &quot;Show me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I shouldn&#39;t...&quot; Finn said.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon man... Don&#39;t be lame. Show me,&quot; Dylan repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Finn relented. Part of him wanted to test it out anyways. That&#39;s why he came to the pool. He loved watching the swimmers. Finn pulled up the Chronivac and looked down at the men swimming. However, it looked like Shawn was out of the pool getting a bit of water at the fountain. He was built like most of the swimmers, though not nearly as tall. At 5&#39;8&quot; he had to look up at nearly everyone else. But his lean muscular build still allowed him to be incredibly fast in the water. He&#39;d have to work quite a bit harder than the other swimmers whose arms and legs were significantly longer. <br />
<br />
Finn pulled up the app and Dylan moved into his personal space. He was right on top of Finn, gently petting the red fur on Finn&#39;s arm. &#39;Shawn is a 6&#39;6&quot; 280 pound anthro shark. He easily keeps his body fat in the single digits and doesn&#39;t mind showing off his body. He can breathe naturally in any form of water.&#39; Finn made sure that Dylan would be able to tell as well and then hit enter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anthro shark? Really?&quot; Dylan&#39;s eyes fell flat as they judged Finn&#39;s choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to try something different,&quot; Finn explained. &quot;Just look. It&#39;s already started.&quot; Then pointed at Shawn. The 150 pound guy was rapidly starting to fill out as more and more muscle was added to his body. His lean muscles were starting to round out and bulge from his body. Large peaks grew onto his biceps and a perfectly sculpted horseshoe rounded out the back of his arm. He reached for the sky and his entire body stretched right along with him. <br />
<br />
He easily passed 6 feet and wandered around the pool as more muscle grew onto his body. Two hefty pecs filled out the front of his chest, gently bouncing each time he jostled his body to help stay warm. What had nearly been completely flat were now two muscles that would press against any shirt he was wearing, showing off his impressive physique. It was the same with his shoulders as they widened, giving him a naturally imposing frame. Sleeves would have a hard time fitting over the boulders sticking out of either side of him. <br />
<br />
Even though he was nearly doubling his weight, he didn&#39;t look like he was getting any fatter. Every bit of him just kept gaining more and more muscle. A firm 6 pack of abs covered the front of his body and looking at his legs, that must have been where a lot of the weight was going. His quads doubled in size with firm muscle that even from the stands, Finn could see each individual muscle. Shawn started to walk with a bit more confidence as he stood just an inch or two higher than everyone else.<br />
<br />
Or maybe it was because the lane he had been swimming in was completely empty. Shawn did a perfect dive into the pool and continued where he&#39;d left off. With each stroke his fingers were starting to gain a little bit of webbing. The bones of his feet fused together and turned more into fins than actual feet. He didn&#39;t even notice as in between his shoulder blades another fin or the long tail erupting from the back of his spine. Gills started to form around his neck, swaying with each time he&#39;d need to take a breath.<br />
<br />
Shawn just swam faster. His body naturally taking to the water and easily lapping everyone else in the pool. With each lap his skin looked to be far smoother as his back turned to a grayish blue and his front to a milky white. The point of his nose pushed far out in front of his face. The round nostrils turned to slits as his face morphed into that of a shark&#39;s. Sharp triangle teeth filled the man&#39;s mouth as he continued to swim as though nothing out of the ordinary happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;No way...&quot; Dylan&#39;s mouth was practically on the floor. Though, his attention quickly changed to Finn, as he grabbed the small fox by the shirt. &quot;Do me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!?&quot; Finn recoiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do me next!&quot; Dylan repeated. &quot;Just don&#39;t do any of that furry shit. Alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn clutched his phone a bit tighter, wondering what he should do.</p>
