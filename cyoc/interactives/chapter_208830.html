<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Commissioned by a friend!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So where is this costume shop supposed to be, dude?” James asked, eyes flicking from the road to the buildings that lined the sides of the streets.<br />
<br />
Silicon Valley was sprawling compared to New York, everything so spread out. Trying to find the hole-in-the-wall costume shop his best friend from high school, Miles, had seen on his way to work was something of a crap shoot. Apparently, it didn’t even have a website and was unlisted on Google Maps.<br />
<br />
Mile was a handsome youngish man, twenty-eight years old, with blue eyes and light brown hair. He was lightly muscled and had a rather nice chest, and even James, straight as he was, had to admit that.  Honestly, James was rather envious of Miles. He was outgoing, happy, a morning person-things James was not. Miles was also gay and had a crush on James in high school. James had to turn him down, but was flattered the guy liked him. If only he were a girl. James found himself thinking that often, now.<br />
<br />
Unlike miles, James had dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. He was nerdy, liked video games and worked in tech. He’d managed to land a high-paying tech job but needed a place to crash until he had a few paychecks under his name and could afford the frankly ludicrous prices for apartments in the area. Fortunately, Miles had moved here a long time ago and had no qualms sharing his couch. James felt kinda bad because he wasn’t sure what signals he was sending to the poor gay man. He certainly didn’t want to lead him on.<br />
<br />
It was Halloween weekend and Miles had insisted James come with him to a party downtown for ‘networking’ or whatever. Costumes were mandatory, which was a bit silly to James. He didn’t want to go to the party, much less dress up for it.<br />
<br />
“No man, I swear it’s on this street!” Miles insisted. “You’re just trying to come up with an excuse to not go to the party.”<br />
<br />
“No!” James protested, though that was a lie.<br />
<br />
“Wait, there it is!” Miles pointed at an old converted theater. “That’s the one I saw yesterday!”<br />
<br />
James turned and looked at the sign on the Marquis. <b>Capes Included</b>. The ticket box had been replaced with one of those old Zoltan wish machines. He could understand why Miles would be so intrigued, it was like one of those magical costume stores you’d read about that would pop up, spice up someone’s life, then disappear the next day. He quickly found a parking spot and Miles and he got out, staring up at the old brick building.<br />
<br />
“It’s so mysterious! I can’t remember even having a dilapidated theater here.” Miles said, staring up at the run-down shop in awe.<br />
<br />
“It’s probably cheaper to rent store space here.” James said.<br />
<br />
“Killjoy!” Miles playfully punched Jame’s shoulder. “Come on, let’s go. Oh! Zoltan! Hey, wanna make a wish? Like something out of big?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t have any quarters.” James said, glancing at the coin slot.<br />
<br />
“I’ll get some when we pay for the costumes.” Miles practically skipped into the double-doors.<br />
<br />
With a sigh, James followed Miles inside.<br />
<br />
As he walked through the double-doors he was stunned. The decor was vintage 40’s and fifties-style sci-fi posters and ads. Old-school costumes were on racks and shelves, and strange devices with the same vintage ads over them were there. <I>Learn Mind Reading!</I> one ad said, indicating a circlet with an amethyst crystal, <I>Just one hour of practice and you’ll hear your neighbor’s inner thoughts!</I>. <I>Genie Pen</I>, another sign read, packaged styluses below it, <I>Your every wish is just a pen stroke away!</I><br />
<br />
James eyed the fantastical ads and shook his head. So the place was filled with those old fake ads and their products. Kinda interesting, but a waste of money for him. He passed a sign advertising invisibility rings and X-Ray glasses and made his way towards the costumes. There were some cool looking masks, goblins and grotesque boars and horrifying wolves. They were hundreds of dollars.<br />
<br />
He looked around at a shelf nearby and saw costume kits, all priced at around $40. They were on discount, so he browsed those. Vampire makeup kits complete with false teeth and a medallion. James wasn’t really into the undead, not feeling it this year. Next to the vampire kits were the werewolf kits. He could do that! Be a wolf-man for the evening seemed like an easy idea. It came with some fake sideburns, pointed ear extensions, colored contacts and rather nice fake teeth. <br />
<br />
Score! Colored contacts normally needed a prescription in California, and the kit came with them. It would take his basic costume to another level with, like, zero effort on his part. This costume was going to rock!<br />
<br />
James took the kit up to the counter and bumped into James, who was holding what looked like a bundle of goat fur, a fake goatee, and horns. On top of that was tanning oil. His best friend smiled apologetically and James let him check out first. He greeted the cashier, a very old-looking man, who smiled at him kindly and took his money.<br />
<br />
“Nice choice. Love werewolves.” The old man’s eyes glinted.<br />
<br />
“Uh, thanks. Oh, and can I get some quarters.” James jabbed a thumb at the entrance. “Wish machine.”<br />
<br />
“Be careful what you wish for. Take it seriously.” The elderly man advised, eyes twinkling dangerously.<br />
<br />
“Sure, man. Thanks for the advice.” James hurriedly scooped up his kit and followed Miles outside.<br />
<br />
“Man, wasn’t he like, exactly the kind of shopkeeper you’d expect in a magic costume shop?” Miles said, waiting by the wishing machine. “He was like, all creepy and mystical and when I told him about the machine, he kept spouting vague innuendos.”<br />
<br />
“If this was an act, he sure was selling it.” James fingered his quarters before handing one to Miles. “Go on, make a wish.”<br />
<br />
Miles dutifully inserted the quarter and whispered something under his breath. Zoltan’s eyes flashed, then a ticket popped out of the machine. He grabbed it and skipped back to the car. James rolled his eyes and inserted his quarter, closing his eyes. <I>I wish Miles could find his true love</I>. There. Not a selfish wish, so not likely to be twisted. Though, now that he thought about it, if Miles did get a boyfriend, he’d have to listen to that headboard knocking on the walls all night long. A ticket was dispensed and he took out and put it in his pocket.<br />
<br />
He got back in his beat-up blue Honda Civic. Miles was bouncing around excitedly, inspecting the costume more critically. James sighed and tossed his kit in the back seat. <br />
<br />
“So what’d you wish for?” Miles asked, excitedly.<br />
<br />
“Not telling.” James said, and stuck his tongue out, feeling silly.<br />
<br />
“You’re mean!” Miles punched his arm again and crossed his arms, pouting. “Okay, well, then I’m not telling you my wish.”<br />
<br />
“If I tell you the wish, it won’t come true!” James smiled. <br />
<br />
Miles was so cute when he got flustered. <br />
<br />
Wait, what? James blinked, wondering where that thought came from, but shrugged it off. Maybe he did need to go to that party and get laid. He was so pent up even his gay roommate was looking good!<br />
<br />
They drove back to Mile’s small apartment near the university and started getting ready. Miles took forever to primp and preen for work, so of course he got dressed first. Predictably, he took freakin’ forever before emerging from the bathroom an hour and a half later.<br />
<br />
Whatever he had done had clearly worked. <br />
<br />
Miles had glued on two small horns. They rose from his forehead and curved backwards and he’d also stuck that long goatee onto his chin. The cute twink was shirtless, his muscles cleverly over-defined by tanning oil, showing off his bulbous pecs. James licked his lips, eyes following his roommate’s dense treasure trail to the heavy goat fur that hugged his hips and dipped dangerously low, far enough that he could see the pubic hair. The length of Mile’s legs were exaggerated by the cloven high-heels he was wearing. <br />
<br />
He was kinda hot, actually.<br />
<br />
James shook his head, wondering where these strange sexual thoughts about his roommate were coming from. He took a breath and tore his gaze away from his roommate. James marched into the bathroom and stoically shoved the thoughts from his mind. Right now, he had a costume to put on and-he glanced at his phone-one hour to do it in.<br />
<br />
It took him half and hour to shower and put in the false teeth and fake sideburns. The hardest part ended up being the contact lenses, which hurt his eyes. He had to borrow some of his roommate’s liquid tears and lube up the lenses a bit before he inserted them. Then he stared at himself, blinking at the rather handsome, feral-looking man with yellow eyes in the mirror. He had to admit he was kinda hot like this! But the costume wasn’t quite complete.<br />
<br />
“Hey Miles?” James poked his head out the door.<br />
<br />
“Yes?” Miles called from his room.<br />
<br />
“You got any clothes I can cut up a bit?” James asked.<br />
<br />
There was silence.<br />
<br />
“Bryce left some clothes here that you can do what you want with.” Miles replied.<br />
<br />
God, Bryce. <br />
<br />
He was Miles’ old flame, a jock that went to high school with them. Big guy, lots of muscles and bisexual. His parents were rich and basically paid for everything Bryce wanted. He’d dated tons cheerleaders before he dated Miles. Bryce’s parents weren’t very accepting of the guy’s, uh, interests, and forced Bryce to break up with Miles if he wanted them to keep paying for his expensive penthouse.<br />
<br />
The betrayal had damn near broke Miles’ heart. It had made him angry to hear about it then, listening to Miles sob into the phone. Now he was going to wear his clothes. Was Miles really going to be okay with this? James could here Miles throwing around clothes and shifting hangers. Then he walked into view carrying a couple jeans and shirts. He handed them to James.<br />
<br />
“Here, just go ahead and absolutely fuck them up. And this,” Miles held up some heavy-duty scissors, “is a pair of tailor’s shears. Be careful, it will cut you.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” James smiled at his roommate warmly and reached out for the clothes and met Mile’s pretty blue eyes. <br />
<br />
He paused, clothes in hand, and stared. James’ heart skipped a beat and his cock stiffened in his pants as he realized just how handsome his roommate was. Miles cleared his throat and hurried away, red-faced. James shook his head, willing his boner away. God, he was so horny today!<br />
<br />
As he took off his clothes, his ticket from the wish machine fell out. James picked it up and put it to the side before trying on Bryce’s old clothes. The clothes actually fit, which was odd, since James was sure he’d gotten a bit of a beer belly since he’d gotten a tech job. But looking at himself in the mirror, with his cut-up clothes, the extra fur seemed to be very slimming, and actually seemed to accentuate muscles he didn’t even have. He spritzed on some of the ‘wolf musk’ that came in the kit and smelled kinda like spicy sandalwood, shoved the wish ticket back into his pocket, and left the bathroom.<br />
<br />
James met Miles at the car. The young twink eyed him critically, and James couldn’t help but bounce a pec for him. Miles blushed and shook his head, a smile playing on his lips.<br />
<br />
“Man, I regret making you wear those.” Miles said.<br />
<br />
“Uh, want me to go cut up some of my clothes?” James asked, “I knew you’d feel different if you saw me…”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Miles coughed. “We don’t have time, though. I’ll just have to deal with it.”<br />
<br />
“Rub one out to me later, you mean?” James winked.<br />
<br />
“Fuck man, stop playing with me! You…Fuck! You look great.” Miles murmured as he got in the car. “God, it’s like I’m back in high school all over again.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to tell me that, I already know.” James smirked as he got in and started the engine, keying in the street address. <br />
<br />
They drove off, sun beginning to set on the horizon. California was very pretty, that was one thing it had going for it. And perfect weather for wearing next to nothing, of course. Speaking of weather, the air in the car was getting strangely warm. Subconsciously, he loosened up the button on the artfully ripped shirt and turned on the AC.<br />
<br />
“What’s that smell?” Miles said suddenly, sniffing the air.<br />
<br />
“Uh, cologne, I think. Werewolf Musk.” James grinned toothily, wriggling his butt. “You like?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Miles blushed and James couldn’t help but notice his costume was sporting a tent at the crotch. “You should, uh, wear it more.”<br />
<br />
James’ tongue licked his fangs as he watched the twink squirm. Yeah, little guy was cute, and single, and maybe he could use a big thick bone up his-<br />
<br />
A car honked and James swerved, blinking, out of the way of the other vehicle. His car had almost drifted into the other lane while he’d been distracted! The hairy man shook his shaggy head, wondering why he’d spaced out. Had he really been that horny? <br />
<br />
Adrenaline soon made him forget the strange lust that had descended on him and they made it safely to the party. <br />
<br />
The mansion they arrived at was huge. Turned out this was a tech party, hosted by some guys who had just become millionaires. Happened more often than anywhere else in the world. Of course, the party was filled with girls and escorts and tons of people smoking pot, drinking beer, a full free wet bar, and a live band. James shook his head. How the hell had Miles managed to pull an invite from these guys? It was, literally, the perfect opportunity for him to network.<br />
<br />
Everyone was wearing ‘sexy’ versions of their costumes and, thus, half naked. A kid came up to them as they were getting out and they had their car validated and parked…somewhere. Honestly, James was pretty wary of letting anyone take his wheels, even if they were old and busted. But he let the kid take it anyways, and James and Miles soon stood awkwardly in the middle of the party, the noise so loud he had to yell for Miles to even hear him.<br />
<br />
“So what do you want to do?” James said.<br />
<br />
“Go network. Talk to some people. I’m going to get drunk!” Miles trotted off.<br />
<br />
James stared at the plump, furry ass of his friend as he retreated, cock hardening in his pants. For a brief second, he’d thought Miles’ cute little tuft of a tail had waggled, but it had to have been his imagination. There were a few guys he recognized at a tech convention and he wandered over to speak with them.<br />
<br />
He found himself completely engrossed in their conversation. After adding a few of his thoughts on innovation-all theoretical-he found that they were very interested in what he had to say. Two hours passed of just talking, and then theory-crafting. Then they had drunk enough beers to not actually be able to carry a conversation of that depth and just started shooting shit.<br />
<br />
When he finally stumbled away to find Miles, he found that the music was louder than normal. His ears twitched backwards, trying to keep the loud noises out. James thought there was something wrong with that, some niggling detail that didn’t make sense, but he was pleasantly buzzed enough to write it off.<br />
<br />
This was why he didn’t like parties. James retreated inside, looking for any sign of Miles. It was quieter back here, in the marble-floored and alabaster walled rooms. The house was strangely devoid of any personal belongings-the guys hosting had likely rented it out, then. A good call, because clean up after this bash would be a bitch!<br />
<br />
He wandered into the kitchen, which served as a staging area for all the drinks, looking for Miles. If he was going to be anywhere, it would be the kitchen. All the servers working the party had been rather handsome. If he were gay, he’d totally mack them up in the back rooms.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, standing next to a cask of wine, holding a full glass of it, was Miles. James’ eyes bulged as he took in the twink’s form. He’d-he’d just been wearing tanning oil before, right? Because he was pretty sure the tan was real, not the fake orange-y color the oil had given him. And his muscles-he hadn’t had much in the way of definition, which was why he’d cleverly used the oil to give himself some. But even from the doorway, James could see sculpted abs and heavy pecs on his gay friend’s body, the shadows under them changing whenever Miles took a drink.<br />
<br />
James scratched his chest and yelped.<br />
<br />
He looked down and saw his nails had blackened and sharpened into claws. James was pretty sure he hadn’t worn fake nails with his outfit. The line of blood welling from his densely-furred chest, however, told a different story. And had his chest hair always been so dense? James scratched his shelf-like pecs lightly, to ensure he didn’t scratch himself again, feeling the vast chest muscles flex with the movement. Maybe he was drunk, but they felt really big, bigger than normal. All those hours at the gym must finally be paying off!<br />
<br />
“James!” Miles waved. “Hey babe!”<br />
<br />
Next to Miles stood a rather statuesque looking man who eyed James up in a very unsubtle manner. <br />
<br />
James growled and rolled his eyes. Was Miles pretending he was his boyfriend to make that server with the nice hair and jawline jealous? Whatever, he could play along. He did owe Miles for hooking him up with all these tech execs.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on, hon?” James smirked and walked over to the two, dodging other caterers in the rather crowded kitchen, watching Miles flinch.<br />
<br />
Miles had told him how much he hated petnames. Well, he wanted him to pretend to be his boyfriend. And no he had a petname.<br />
<br />
“I gotta get back to work.” The server said, looking uncomfortably at James and hurriedly walking off into the crowd.<br />
<br />
“Hey, wait-!” Miles called, but the man was already gone. His shoulders slumped. “Dammit.”<br />
<br />
“Having issues, sweetie?” James leaned against the cupboard by the satyr’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, all the guys here suck!” Miles scoffed, stamping a cloven hoof.<br />
<br />
James chuckled. Miles was so cute when he got angry. The muscular man came up and placed a hairy, clawed hand on his ‘boyfriend’s’ shoulder. Miles took another gulp of wine and nearly fell into James’ arms. James caught him and steadied the twunk.<br />
<br />
“Whoa! Maybe you should lay off that wine. How much have you had tonight?”<br />
<br />
“Just a glass or two.” Miles tried waving him off and almost fell over again.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” James recoiled at the smell of heavy alcohol on Miles’ breath. “M-Maybe you should have some water?”<br />
<br />
“I’m very good at holding my liquor, but fine.” Miles sighed and poured his wine glass down the sink, his bulbous butt waving tantalizing in the air as he did. James’ nose flared and wriggled as he scented his boyfriend. Er, his best friend. “It was cheap shit, don’t worry.” Miles filled it up with water and started chugging. He looked at James and pointed. “So, uh, when did the outfit come with a tail?”<br />
<br />
“A tail?” James turned, feeling something swish behind him. A furry gray-brown wolf tail wagged behind him, protruding from one of the artful tears he’d made in Bryce’s old clothes. “…It…didn’t?”<br />
<br />
He didn’t notice Miles saunter up to him until he smelt his breath on his cheek.<br />
<br />
“You look really good.” Miles purred.<br />
<br />
James looked back and found himself incredibly close to his smaller, slimmer, and rather muscular roommate. The air was filled with the smell of wine and sun-touched grass and barnyard musk. Miles’ eyes were down cast, one hand playing over James’ furry sheathe. Which he was pretty sure didn’t come with the costume.<br />
<br />
“Miles….” James breathed, heart pounding. The lipstick-like tip of his cock began to poke out of his sheathe. “I…”<br />
<br />
“Touch me.” Miles whispered, burying his face in James’ mountainous pecs. “Hold me!”<br />
<br />
James wrapped his claws around the sexy twunk, nose snuffling his slightly curly hair. “You’re…kinda hot.”<br />
<br />
James wondered why he was so hard. He wasn’t gay, but…man, Miles was looking pretty hot, that wasn’t a lie. He licked his chops and began to nuzzle the satyr’s neck with his cold nose.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm.” Miles groaned, his hands roaming over the furry hills and valleys of James back. “I’ve wanted you forever.”<br />
<br />
“You have me now.” James whispered, then yelped as Miles’ hand landed on the base of his tail.<br />
<br />
“You like that?” Miles played with the base of the tail.<br />
<br />
“Uh…yeah, oh Miles!” James groaned and nodded, paws slumping down Miles’ back to rest on his swollen rump.<br />
<br />
“Found something you like?” Miles smirked into James’ chest fur.<br />
<br />
“God, you’ve got an entire bakery back here, hon.” James said, gently massaging the two furry cheeks. They were soft and pliable but dense with muscle. Miles moaned softly and rested his head on James’ shoulder.<br />
<br />
“You smell so good.” Miles murmured softly, nuzzling into James’ hairy pecs.<br />
<br />
James brought a paw up and hugged the hot little goatman tighter to his vast,densely- furry chest. They gently rocked together in the middle of the kitchen. His cock was tenting his artfully ripped pants. The twink in his arms grasped him tighter, and James found himself…smiling.<br />
<br />
“Come on, babe.”James hoisted Miles up in his arms. “Let’s get you to bed.”<br />
<br />
“D-do you think they’ll let us?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t care.” James growled, long tongue lolling out of his mouth, speckled with his saliva. “I’m going to claim your hole, boy.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, daddy!” Miles kicked his legs and giggled in James arms.<br />
<br />
James walked into an empty bedroom and kicked the door shut behind them. He tossed the hot twunk on the bed and tore off the rest of his clothes. Miles gasped, staring at the heavily muscled werewolf panting and hugely erect at the side of the bed.<br />
<br />
“What?” The werewolf grinned, yellow eyes glowing, and flexed an arm, his bowling-ball sized furry bicep bouncing, “Enjoying the gunshow?”<br />
<br />
“F-fuck me.” Miles turned and raised his ass, enjoying the cool air on his tensing hole.<br />
<br />
“My pleasure.” James growled, smelling that musk again, red rocket absolutely rigid. <br />
<br />
The wolfman dove into the twink’s ass, cold nose pressing underneath that tufty tail. Miles gasped and flinched, then moaned as James’ hot, warm tongue began lapping excitedly at his rear entrance. It was warm and savory and that lovely barn and meadow scent was all James could smell.<br />
<br />
“Fuck,” Miles gasped, the satyr’s body writhed as the wolfman loving licked his hole. “Your fur between my cheeks feels amazing, babe!” <br />
<br />
James growled lustily, muzzle creaking forward, tongue lengthening as he swirled and lapped and punched through the tight ring. Miles’ moans grew loader the deeper the wolfman’s tongue ventured, exploring every nook of the twunk’s loosening hole. James’ tail waved behind him like a flag in the wind.<br />
<br />
Soon, the tightness slackened, hole covered in drool and spit. James gave it one more satisfied lap, then pulled away, leaving Miles groaning happily.<br />
<br />
He positioned himself above the twink, rubbing his turgid red cock around the loosened ring, ears perking each time it slipped and dipped into the satyr’s rear, making the lithe twunk bleat. He waited until Miles was in an absolute frenzy.<br />
<br />
“You want this cock, boy?” James growled.<br />
<br />
“Fuck yes, daddy!” Miles whined. “Plug my tailhole!”<br />
<br />
James growled and thrust.<br />
<br />
Miles gave a surprised bleat as his ring stretched around his massive crimson intruder. He felt so full already, and the cock kept coming, stretching him wider and wider. It should have hurt, but thanks to the tongue fucking and the spit, it was more like a relief, like stretching an old, unused muscle. It was all the satyr could do not to cum right there as the cock pressed heavily against his prostate.<br />
<br />
“James!” Miles wheezed. “Harder!”<br />
<br />
The wolfman bottomed out, big furry balls slapping Miles’, then began thrusting in earnest. Pap, pap, pap, pap, each one punctuated by a pleasured bleat from his little boyfriend. James no longer questioned it at this point, the twink’s hole was perfect. He couldn’t believe he’d ignored such a hot little number all through highschool.<br />
<br />
Miles’ hole clenched and squeezed around the wolfman’s cock in rhythmic waves, beginning to push back, hole still feeling oddly empty despite the big cock in him. It wasn’t until he bumped against the massive, throbbing knot that he realized what was missing. But could he really fit that thing inside him.<br />
<br />
James felt a strange bump on his cock and didn’t question it. The pleasure he got touching it against the satyr’s sloppy hole was enough to spur him on. For him, it wasn’t a matter of if he could get it int the hole, but when. A powerful urge was driving him on, powering his thrusts. He could smell the twink’s need, the precum pooling on the sheets below.<br />
<br />
He gripped Miles’ hips pulled back was slamming his hips forward, and with a pleased yelp of ecstasy, knotted his little satyr twunk. James felt the twink’s hole spasm and the warm smell of ejaculation. The sudden clenching around the base of his knot was all he needed. With a howl, he flew over the edge of pleasure into a mind-blowing orgasm, all thoughts about his own sexuality and his feelings for Miles whited out in a lusty explosion.<br />
<br />
Miles bleated and moaned as the werewolf flooded his intestines with hot spunk, face pressed against the sheets. His own cock was orgasming completely hands-free, and each mindless thrust from his lover coaxed another shot of semen out of him.<br />
<br />
They didn’t stop fucking for hours, the smell of their own lewd leavings spurring them to cum again and again, as though making up for lost time.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Miles woke up the next morning without a headache, which was a miracle in and of itself.<br />
<br />
He heard deep, heavy snores next to him and figured he must have gotten lucky at the party. The bed was warm, stiflingly so, and Miles was incredibly hard. He reached down, still half-asleep, and went to touch his throbbing morning wood, and encountered thick faux-fur fabric. Man, had he gotten so drunk that he’d forgotten to take off his costume?<br />
<br />
The morning air was cold on his skin, he didn’t want to get out of bed, so he kinda shuffled around under the covers awkwardly, pulling the goat fur pants off. A fake horn brushed uncomfortably against the head board as he shifted. He reached up a hand and undid the string under his neck and pulled those off with a pop, tossing them onto the floor. Soon, the pants came off as well, and the bed was comfortable again.<br />
<br />
With a happy sigh, he settled back against the pillow, his little goat tail wiggling, and glanced over at his companion. He froze, eyes wide, as he saw James there, looking absolutely handsome, cheeks covered in thick scruff. If he’d been ruggedly handsome before, now he was just stunning. Those heavy sideburns shouldn’t have worked, but babe did they. And his muscles! James had the kind of body a musclebear dreamed of.<br />
<br />
James grumbled in his sleep and rolled over, encircling Miles in his huge arms. Miles’ heart skipped a beat as the arms pulled him close against his furry chest and James nuzzled into his neck, sniffing him. God, it was like a dream! He wanted to cry, actually, but he was afraid of waking James up and getting rejected or yelled at.<br />
<br />
Had they…done it together? They must have, because…well…Miles didn’t feel sore, exactly, just pleasantly stretched. Memories of last night, of their wild sexcapades, came flooding back to him, making his morning wood twitch. He could feel James’ wetness still inside of him and he moaned into his pillow happily, little goat tail wagging. <br />
<br />
“Someone’s happy this morning.” James spoke besides him, pulling the twink closer to him and rubbing his rough cheek fuzz against the back of Miles’ neck and kissed the top of his head, rubbing two hardened nubs of horns that protruded from his forehead. “How’s my little goat doing?”<br />
<br />
Miles’ eyes widened. “Y-you’re not angry?”<br />
<br />
“Why would I be angry with waking up next to the sexiest guy at the party?” James’ big hand reached around and began to stroke Miles’ morning wood.<br />
<br />
Miles bleated involuntarily. This was a dream come true!<br />
<br />
“Where have you been all my life?” James breathed in Miles’ ear as he ground his own hardness into the twink’s perfect bubbly ass.<br />
<br />
“Waiting for you.” Miles moaned, feeling so small and vulnerable in his boyfriend’s caress.<br />
<br />
With a gasp, Miles felt James’ big cock slip right into his sleep and sex-loosened hole. He groaned in pleasure as James rolled his hips, cock managing to impact his prostate with each buck of his hips. Precum drooled onto the bedsheets.<br />
<br />
“J-James…!” Miles cried, feeling his ass spasm and clench around the intruder that was stretching him so pleasantly.<br />
<br />
James growled and tenderly nibbled Miles’ ear, hands on the twink’s hips as he pummeled his lover’s hole. Miles felt warmth flood his insides again and gave a bleat, kicking his legs as he came. The next hour was filled with gasps and sighs as they found out just how many times James could cum in one go.<br />
<br />
Then, the smell of coffee and bacon had them both out of bed and on their way to the kitchen, where the serving staff had cooked brunch.</p>
