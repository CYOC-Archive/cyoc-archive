<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scott and Jeff followed TransDem agent Willis to the football field.  A large T-rex rampaged past the 50-yard line toward them.  A team of TransDem agents stood in his path, aiming a Chronivac.  A second later, the large dinosaur shrank rapidly down, tail shriveling up, arms becoming more proportional to his body.  Scales receded into tanned skin, muzzle retreated into a nose and human mouth.  In seconds, the reptilian king of the dinosaurs had shrunk and reverted into a muscular, hairy mammal – namely a jock.  <br />
<br />
“That was interesting,” Jeff grinned at Scott.<br />
<br />
“We get a lot of ‘interesting’ working for TransDem.” Willis returned to the locker room, side-stepping the twunky anthro cat-boi chasing after a mouse.  “Samson, check if that’s a jock or a real mouse – I don’t want any more vore on my watch.  Speaking of – how is choco-jock doing?”<br />
<br />
“All accounted for, sir,” a grateful Brady said, toweling off after a quick shower.  His thick, beefy jock body suffered no ill effects.  “I’ve never been eaten before… well, not like that anyway,” he grinned.<br />
<br />
Scott watched the calico cat-boi giving himself a cat bath, licking between his legs.  He slowly revert to his former jockish self… fur retreating, twunk body bulking out to its former muscular glory… lats, triceps, biceps, pecs delts, quads- all the muscle groups popping back out, ready for action.  The two beautiful she-males ran over to him, running their hands up and down his muscular body, and started stroking his big dick as he tried to get a grip on suddenly being jock again.  His cock got hard at their touch, and as he gave a final meow, his penis popped like a campaign bottle, spraying a blast of cum everywhere.<br />
<br />
“So as I was saying,” Willis recalled, facing Jeff and Scott, “In addition to outliving everyone they knew, many of the beliefs and assumptions about life by our fictional &#39;time traveler from the far-past&#39; would be challenged today – often irrefutably – by modern society and science.  It goes way beyond overwhelming.”<br />
<br />
Jeff imagined what it would be like if he suddenly found himself a thousand years in the future.  What would remain?  What would be familiar – if anything?  It would be as disconcerting as being a jock, suddenly turned into… well, a fat sow… or a mouse… and being chased by a catboi.<br />
<br />
“Truth is all well and good.  But sometimes, it can seem like a blunt instrument for the unprepared.” Willis looked thoughtful, “Growth and understanding take time.  Too much ‘truth’ too fast, can do a lot of harm – to anyone.”<br />
<br />
Jeff spotted three jocks all conjoined together by their crotches, rubbing one another’s bodies as cum spurted out their mouths, all three in obvious ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Scott relaxed, oblivious to the jocks behind him.  “But I thought I was gay before any changes were made to me by the Chronivac?”<br />
<br />
“And now?” Willis asked.<br />
<br />
Scott put his arm around Jeff, kissed his cheek.  “I love him, I always will.  But I don’t want to have sex with him.  I just like being with him in all the other ways.  Something’s just… different now.”<br />
<br />
“We didn’t change you,” Willis said.  “The difference is something in you, yourself.  It&#39;s possible the Chronivac shifts in you acted as a catalyst for something that you were already going through - just speeded it up.”  He stopped, and looked the jock in the eye.  “Does it bother you?”<br />
<br />
“I think yesterday it would have… but…No, not right now anyway,” Scott said honestly.  “I mean, it kind of felt like I needed to have sex with Jeff before, like addiction.  Now I just feel… free to love him, if that makes any sense.  It’s a little confusing, but I don’t feel pressure like before.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t feel confused really,” Jeff said.  “But then, I was straight to begin with, more or less.  I absolutely love Scott, I would never change that.  I don’t really desire him sexually right now, not like when the Chronivac changed me.  But I feel bonded to him, like a brother.”  But even as he spoke, something tugged at the back of Jeff’s mind.<br />
<br />
A jock who’s lower half was a pogo-stick hopped by.  A second later, he walked back to the showers, his fit, strong, hairy body restored to normal.<br />
<br />
Willis spoke slowly, deliberately.  “When people thought the world was flat, they never knew any different.  It was a fact of life.  When science revealed the error, it was met with resistance because new ideas are suspect – even when they make more sense than what we always believed.”<br />
<br />
Scott nodded his head slowly.  “Yeah… whatever changed in me, it feels real, like I misunderstood something before and now I don’t.  But it’s a little disconcerting.  I mean, I identified as ‘gay’ and it was comforting in a way, like I belonged to a group of people… had a tribe of my own.  Now something has shifted, I don’t feel gay now.  It’s kind of scary, like losing part of yourself.  Like, where do I belong now, who will accept me?  Will the gay commuity reject me now?  But it’s kind of freeing, too.”<br />
<br />
“That’s true with the shedding of any truth or label we attach to ourselves – be they real or imagined... and the dangers of losing friends is real in all communities - some people aren&#39;t going to understand or believe us - even when we&#39;re being honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt something in his mind that simply wouldn&#39;t let go... and he started to feel worry.<br />
<br />
Willis continued, &quot;Our understanding – and even misunderstanding – shape how we think of ourselves.  And we fear losing the connections we have.”  Willis cleared his throat.  “I’ve found when I face my fears, they lose their power over me.  More than once I’ve felt like I was losing a part of myself or even my sanity, only to eventually discover a deeper truth.”<br />
<br />
Jeff felt the nagging in the back of his mind growing stronger.  He thought out loud, “So you’re saying all of the things we argue about today – such as gender identity and orientation – are misunderstood by everybody?”  Inside he was starting to freak out, something was definitely different.<br />
<br />
Scott shook his head.  “I dunno about that.   Think about it – what do any of us – even science – really know about all of this?”<br />
<br />
“Whatever comes,” Willis interjected, “change and real transformation is a process of growth… of learning… of surrender, as much as it is of embracing.  It’s difficult work.  We all need to feel loved and accepted.  No matter what form any truth ends up taking, no one can force someone else to accept a round world if they’re not ready.”<br />
<br />
“Even a little kindness, love, and patience can go a long way,” Jeff said.  “When I lost Will, I needed someone to love me through the grieving.”  Jeff felt his skin grow clammy as he finally realized something deep down.<br />
<br />
“Love is what changes the world,” Scott spoke up.   “Power, lust, politics, causes, movements – all fade over time.  But love between people who know and care about one another… that’s what lasts.”<br />
<br />
Willis concurred.  “Our world is going through growing pains.  The Chronivac is a way we offer of exploring the ‘what-if’ while blowing off steam – and it’s safer than people realize.  But eventually, we have to build bridges of understanding by listening to one another – even when we disagree.  Loving one another, even amidst adversity.  That means everybody, not just those we agree with.”<br />
<br />
Jeff sat on a bench, quietly.  He couldn’t help but wonder why, if he was so straight, he found himself secretly wanting to be a cock-sucking sow again.  He felt dizzy at the realization and the shame it brought.  He actually started getting turned on at the idea of being what he was only a few minutes ago, trapped helplessly as a tub-of-lard big tittied cocksucking sow.  Maybe the Chronivac did leave a lasting change even after someone was reverted?<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong, Jeff?” Scott asked with genuine concern.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned red with embarrassment, unable to look Scott in the eye, feeling is cock hardening in his shorts.  He didn’t know what to say.  He wanted to become &#39;Princess&#39; the fat sow again, and the more he tried to deny it, the stronger the desire became.</p>
