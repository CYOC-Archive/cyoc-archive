<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Denize lingered on that thought as she drove back with Cameron. Sucking on the stallion&#39;s smelly but proudly erect member... There was something taboo about what she had just done that had left a lingering fire in her loins and she discretely slipped a hand under her dress and onto her pussy to rub it a little. as she stared out the window and thought about it. <br />
<br />
Cameron noticed her lost in her thoughts. &quot;You alright?&quot; He asked, concerned for her and what her mind must be going through after what she had just done.<br />
<br />
Denize jumped a little, afraid she had been caught. &quot;Y-yeah, just can&#39;t believe I did that,&quot; she said while hurriedly removing her hand from her cunt that was now soaking wet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I know that you thought it was me, so I can kind of understand why you did what you did.&quot; Cameron knew it was best to give her a little bit of space to process what had happened and decided to not speak much the rest of the way. Denize was still staring out the window when they passed by a little hobby farm not too far from their house. <br />
<br />
&quot;Has that always been there?&quot; She asked Cameron, perking up a little as she said it. She had never seen it before. There were woods on either side and some horses in a small pasture that had a small barn attached to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I think so,&quot; He said, &quot;We just hardly ever go back this way so you&#39;ve probably never taken notice of it. It&#39;s got just a few animals from what I can tell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks nice...&quot; Denize trailed off, unsure what exactly she was thinking.<br />
<br />
.............................................................................................................................................<br />
<br />
Later that evening Denize and Cameron were getting ready for bed. The candle sat unused, both unsure if they would be able to use it and get to work tomorrow fine. At the moment they were both in their bed reading, with the lamps overhanging the bed lighting the pages. Cameron was focused on his book but was getting tired. Denize was reading but only absentmindedly. Her mind kept wanting to wander to her encounter in the field. This was torture. She had to do something. <br />
<br />
Cameron startled her again by asking her if she was ready for bed. She looked at him and nodded, then put her head on her pillow and covered herself with the blanket, turning away from Cameron. She had to do something. She closed her eyes and pretended to sleep, but as soon as Cameron fell asleep and was snoring she flew out of bed, grabbed the car keys off the table and the candle just in case and had driven straight to the side of the road by the farm she had seen earlier. She parked the car and made a hasty run through the dark toward the barn. Opening a side door, she felt around for a light switch and found one. She flipped it up and saw a single light turn on that illuminated several stalls and several horses.<br />
<br />
She looked into each stall to identify the horse&#39;s sex and was lucky to find that one was a male. Her cunt was practically dripping by now and she felt wetness start to spread between and down her thighs. Inside the stall, the horse noticed her and walked towards the door. Denize opened the door and stood back. The horse retreated at first, unsure, then walked towards her to sniff her. She quickly threw down her pajamas and grabbed the stallion&#39;s head and gently brought it down to her crotch. The stallion smelled it for a second then brought out its tongue to lick around the sides of her cunt. <br />
<br />
The stallion seemed to like the saltiness of the liquid coating her snatch but as she looked over to its sheath, she was disappointed to see its cock was not coming out. Dismayed, she backed away, unsure of what to do. She had the candle in her pocket still, but she wanted to enjoy this as a full woman. Then she had an idea. Taking out the candle, she sat on the floor on some hay and scratched at the wax. With some collected, she pooled some on a fingertip and brought it to her pussy massaging around the outside of it and her asshole then pushing her finger inside to spread the transformative material inside of her. When she pulled her hand away, none of the wax remained, and she sat there awaiting something to happen.<br />
<br />
When a minute had passed, she thought that her efforts had been in vain and that the candle only worked when it was lit. Then, an electrical zap shot through her wet vagina and followed her tunnel into her sex. Before her eyes, it swelled, the lips grew thicker and puffed outwards more as her clit retreated inside of her. It elongated and pulled up towards her asshole which had also felt like it was stretching and tightening. Her vulva turned a dark black color and wetness started to spill from it.  This was what she had been waiting for and she excitedly flipped over to her knees and was about to get up when she felt the stallion&#39;s hot breath over her bare mare pussy. She froze, not wanting to interrupt this. The stallion put its nose right up next to her asshole and breathed in her scent, then did the same with her new mare vagina.<br />
<br />
Looking over her shoulder, she could see its might phallus start to drop from its sheath. &quot;Yessssss!!&quot; She cheered in her head, excited for her success, but still di not interrupt the stallion. The horse, for its part, treated her as any other mare and started to lick her folds, getting its tongue into her depths and tasting her musky mare juices. Denise laid there with her ass in the air and her elbows supporting her upper body as the horse ate her out. Her eyes were rolling in her head and her hands were clenched in fists to try and not give in to the immense sexual pleasure she was feeling, but it was too much and she let out a hearty moan as her fists unclenched and she lowered her head, pushing her mare cunt back into the stallions snout. She stayed there for several minutes with the stallion licking her sex as she moaned in higher and higher pitches before starting to scream from the pleasure. The intensity of sexual pleasure was overwhelming! Finally her pussy clenched down in an orgasm that caused her cunt to spray out copious amounts of fluid onto the stallion&#39;s nose.<br />
<br />
The stallion backed up surprised, and Denize kneeled there for a little while catching her breath while her pussy winked. Her legs were trembling as she stood up, and her eyes landed on the stallions firmly erect cock. Finally, her prize was in sight. She hurried over to the horse&#39;s side as fast as her shaking legs would let her and fell to her knees. Her mouth landed right on the flared head of its shaft. She let out a moan as her tongue swirled over the salty, musky and pungent flavor of the stallion&#39;s cock. Her eyes were closed and one hand went to her pussy, first fingering herself then fisting herself while she sucked and stroked the stallion&#39;s penis. She could barely fit more than the head in her mouth, and every now and then the tip would let out some precum that she would swirl around and swallow. Her moans came out muffled as her lips were stretched by the width of the stallion&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
Her efforts proved successful and she felt the shaft tense up. She opened her eyes and saw the stallion&#39;s balls start to draw up. She rubbed them with her free hand, coaxing the semen out as her other hand withdrew from her gaping cunt and went to the beast&#39;s shaft to fastly stroke it. The slick wet feeling of her hand over the length of its penis was enough for the stallion and it erupted like a firehose into her mouth. The force of the cum was so powerful that some went up her nose. It must have been at least a cup in the first jet. She tried to keep up with it but she could only swallow so much of the hot seed and before she knew it a second and a third blast had hit the inside of her mouth, scalding hot. She hurriedly pulled her mouth off its prick with a *pop* and pointed the tip at her waiting breasts as cum ran out the sides of her mouth. <br />
<br />
Several more salvos covered her perky tits and she cried with pleasure, massaging the spooge over her breasts and stomach and dropping down to stuff as much as she could into her pussy.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the stream of cum started to abate and she returned to the head, licking any excess she could off of it as it started to soften and pull back into its sheath. The horse, satisfied, whicker and turned around, trotting back into its stall.<br />
<br />
Denise was so exhausted that she laid down on the hay and quickly went to sleep.</p>
