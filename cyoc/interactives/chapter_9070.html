<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stan always wondered why he'd paid for the backyard fencing as Janice jumped in one bound from the back porch. Instantly she began to lip nibble the blades of green grass.<br />
<br />
Turning round Stan closed the screen door but left the main door open in case Janice called or needed something. About two steps from the door and Stan stopped, laughed and reaching for the door slammed it shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's a dumb goat now and won't be asking me for anything too soon!&quot;<br />
said Stan to himself.<br />
<br />
Scratching and feeling ever so dirty from his night and half of a day being satyr and sex fiend.  A shower and then something to eat was on the docket.<br />
<br />
The warm water relaxed Stan as he sat in the shower's corner seat letting the spraying hot water cascade over his head and body. Memories of his night with Janice returned as did his erection. Try as he might the images of her changing drove him to lust for the whole thing to begin again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Total power consumes!&quot; remembered Stan as he dried off. A shave, combing his thinning hair, brush teeth covered in some yellow yuck'o, he was ready for something to eat.<br />
<br />
Like a man twenty years his younger he bounded down the stairs. Once in the kitchen he opened the cupboard and saw just what he had a taste for, Cheerios!<br />
<br />
One bowl led to another till he at last felt quite full. The dishes cleaned he looked out at Janice still working about the backyard nibbling. He had to make plans of what to do with her since keeping her here at home as a goat was not practical. Grabbing the phone book he checked the yellow pages for goat farms.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I drove her out somewhere and released her near a goat farm they would be happy to find another good sound nanny.&quot; thought Stan as he began to search.<br />
<br />
&quot;Friendly Sunrise Farms&quot; &quot;Perfect!&quot; He thought, &quot;I'll drive her there, it's more than thirty miles from here, she'll never find home again!&quot; <br />
<br />
Quickly Stan went outside and removed the rear seating from his SUV. Tossing a few car cleaning towels over the rear deck just in case she did as done in the kitchen he could clean it up quite easy. janice was more than willing to jump into the rear of his vehicle as he piled up some celery and lettuce for a tasty munch.<br />
<br />
Driving along he watched his goat wife munch and drop little brown marbles with every swallow. &quot;Things are going to be very different from now on!&quot; mumbled Stan.<br />
<br />
Then a thought, Barrett, what was he going to tell their Son? He could't begin to tell him he'd infectiously changed his wife into a nanny goat with his satyr's semen, no way! He had to make up a story that could be plausable.<br />
<br />
The sign's to the farm were many as they told of a petting zoo and a retreat for rest and relaxation. As the SUV stopped Janice stood ready to lite the vehicle. The air scented air was filled with goat's desire, she bounded down running up ther drive.<br />
<br />
Slamming the rear cargo lid closed Stan jumped into the front seat and headed for home.  Once he got there his mind was on the pleasure derived from the Chronivac program. Stripping off clothing as he ran up the stairs he soon plopped into his chair, the computer still running.<br />
<br />
Three fingers touched the Alt, Ctrl, and Delete all at the same time. He watched with some wierd satisfaction as the Satyric options vanished and a white screen offered new fun to come.<br />
<br />
Running the cursor to back up the screen for options he forgot one group of options were still held in the program memory. Fingers went wild as he brought up options and entered them into the parameters.<br />
Then elapse time, he wondered, six days till Barrett would be home and no worry of Janice, &quot;72 hours!&quot;<br />
<br />
Stan sat back his memories of being a satyr were fun but he wanted the time of doing and not being know, atonmoy! His choice was to be like he was at first but more finished, more polished as an animal in the equine kingdom.<br />
<br />
Standing up he stood where the emitter could do it's work and boink went the enter key. The emitter turned green and then blinked several times as the screen told of &quot;Error DLL 101070a&quot;. Stan turned to take a step but the emitter's beam lighted him awash in green light. Unable to check out the problem he could do nothing now but accept what came.<br />
<br />
Turning slowly he felt warmth again which relaxed him into a light standing slumber. Even after the light turned off he stood half asleep and quite calm. As minutes passed it was the mantle's clock gonging out the hour that brought him at least to an awakened sense of being.<br />
<br />
Plans being tempered by sexuall drives and old memories of fun times his plan was not working well at all. The Error mixed the Donkey program with the options choosen for the new level of personal excitement.<br />
<br />
Even as Stan looked for farms to put Janice, he saw Equestrian academies, boarding of horses, and a couple who mentioned stud services as well. It was the Mason Farm that he thought would be close and reasonable. They bred Highland ponies, but as much as he longer to enjoy the size cock of such a stallion he felt odd and somehow not right.<br />
<br />
Plodding out the computer room he wandered into the bathroom for that full length mirror. A blink, then wide of eye showing as a horse would the whites. Fear and dismay he felt as what looked back was a mixed breed creature of part Jackass and part Highland stallion.<br />
<br />
The room was small and he could not get his entire new body in for a good look. Scents of goat semen and Janice still plauged the air. It was Janice's nanny goat urine scent that curled his upper lip and sent strange seductive urges into his every thought.<br />
<br />
A old fun feeling as his major of size pony draft animal's penis dropped from the sheath. Oh so very fast it stiffened and was flared erect wishing for release. In true equine fashion Stan beat his monster cock up into that hairy round belly. Stretching himself out the desire only increased till both nostrils sniffed and legs felt the splashing of seed.<br />
<br />
The release felt very good and as the penis shrank so did Stan's mental ability. He stood thinking about what to do next only to find himself feeling trapped inside the little room.  Turning was difficult but with jumping onto the counter with forehoofs he completed his turn. Bolting out he ran down the hall, down the stairs in a wilder yet storm of determined escape. A crash through the back screen door he was out and huffing he stood feeling happy to be free.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grass!&quot;</p>
