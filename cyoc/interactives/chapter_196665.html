<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{Inside Charle&#39;s mind.. The visions of the Cougars are becoming stronger and starting to feel more real.. He&#39;s driving the car and keeping his eyes on the road in the physical world.. But suddenly all the descriptions start making him moan subconsciously.. it starts to feel like their are ghost paws all over him.. rubbing at him.. Tongues lapping at his sex. He feels them slowly moving inwards, gently nibbling at his anus.. It starts to feel more real than ever before.. The images seem to be getting stronger.. The warm lips of a cougar sliding across his sex.. Feeling the hot breath of a cougar down his throat.. Feeling a heavy tongue slide across his skin.. He moans again.. He can feel himself getting closer and closer to orgasm.. <br />
<br />
The Cougars are tugging at him now, pulling him closer to them.. But he has no urge to move.. He doesn&#39;t want to move. But suddenly the scent of them becomes stronger, and suddenly he can smell them in his nostrils.. Like they&#39;ve been waiting for this moment.. Now they&#39;re standing next to him, clawed hands slipping up to pull at his hair.. His throat still filled with their hot breath, he feels the hard thrusts of their erections inside of him.. He can&#39;t stop himself.. He feels himself arch up, feeling their thick cocks plunging into his ass.. He feels his own juices leaking onto the seat of the car.. His cock begins to throb and twitch in his pants.. <br />
<br />
Suddenly his mouth is filling with saliva as he drools in pleasure.. He feels them begin to lick his sweat soaked face.. They&#39;re teasing him, fucking him through his pants.. Pulling his head back to expose his neck.. They&#39;re running their tongues across his neck and shoulders, shoving their tongues into his ear, licking and sucking his ears.. His ears are pulled backwards so far that they ache in pain.. He feels his nipples being pinched, felt their teeth dig into his chest.. A sharp pain shoots through his nipple when one of the cats bites it.. <br />
<br />
Their hot breath fills his lungs as they scream into his ear.. A sudden pain in his neck when one of them bites him.. He screams out.. His neck aching and burning.. Then another sharp bite on his ear.. More cries of pain fill the car.. He is yelling in pain, but his cries turn to whimpers as they keep pushing his head deeper into their lap.. His thighs squeeze tight around their hips as they force him closer and closer to climax.. He moans loudly as he reaches his peak.. His hips buck wildly as he tries to reach that blissful state of completion.. But he knows it won&#39;t be enough.. He keeps cumming, squirting his seed everywhere.. Cumming harder than he ever had before.. But not fast enough.. Suddenly he realizes he&#39;s cumming inside of a pussy, he looks down to see the white liquid dripping from between her legs.. She&#39;s cumming too, her claws digging into his shoulders, her tail wrapping around his waist, holding him tighter.. Her claws pull him back and forth, driving him towards his release once again.. He can&#39;t hold back any longer.. He feels his balls tighten, milking his load out.. He groans, coming once again.. His face smeared with his semen, he falls forward, passing out..}<br />
<br />
Charles gasps and wakes up back in his seat, slapping himself.. The whole mental image taking place in just a single physical second in his mind.. But yet.. it felt so real.. Like hours had passed.. he turns bright red.... It was just a comment.. and yet the winds have already planted change.. Unbenowst to the others.. while the dream was not physically real.. it&#39;s changes weren&#39;t.. Sliding underneath his balls, where his fantasies of being taken occurred.. his loins are starting to shift as his anus starts to become more pliable and grow a soft.. sandy fur in splattered markings where all the dream and fantasy cum had splattered.. <br />
<br />
Outwardly.. Charles gives a nervous, focused shrug, still appearing fully human and giving a answer back. &quot;Heh.. You know that.. I&#39;m straight as a arrow.. I love the ladies.. I would never go for a throbbing.. juicy.. Eeep!&quot; Charles yelps out,  &quot;What was that?? What did I just do???&quot; He asks himself.. He stares ahead in disbelief.. He wants to go home right now.. This is too much.. He shakes his head, forcing himself to calm down.. He sees the sign for an exit up ahead, and starts to make his way there.. Once he gets to the exit, he sees a big shopping center, and pulls off in front of it.<br />
<br />
He parks the car in front of a large building, the windows of which are covered by bars.. He sits there for a while staring at the parking lot, and he smiles, planning on stocking up on more snacks and camping supplies.. But then.. Something starts to bother him.. he looks away, and slips.. Suddenly he starts to yowl and clench a bit as he slips away.. Embarassingly, his soft and boistery voice starts to change emerging as his human brain starts conflicting with his body what to do..<br />
<br />
&quot;Ughhh... Nnnghhhhh...&quot; He cries out, sliding on the asphalt. His hand slides on a plastic handle, and he grabs it. Something is starting to drip between his legs.. But he&#39;s still full clothed and can&#39;t see it.. It keeps itching.. Burning..  Releasing it, he slaps it back onto the wheel, and slaps his thigh..&quot;Damn.. Damn damn DAMN!&quot; He yells.. He sits up in his seat, rubbing his thigh, trying to get his senses together.<br />
<br />
 The smell of his own scent is strong in the air, along with some other strong odor.. But its growing stronger and stronger as his nose gets closer and closer to the source of it.... He starts breathing heavily, the desire for another scent overwhelming him... ... But what??? He doesn&#39;t know anything about cougars, much less wildlife in general.. He&#39;s lived a life of rigorous study.. Yet animal anatomy was never something he studied.. He softly shies.. and glances at the bathroom.. Wondering if he should take a look.. He can&#39;t tell but he rubs over it.. Somewhere underneath his balls.. Something sensitive feels like it&#39;s forming.. But it&#39;s not anything human he&#39;s seen before.. and still covered with his jean&#39;s cloth.. he whimpers a bit, Moaning at the touch and eyes quivering.. It feels wet.. Soft.. Eyes are around him, as he realizes he&#39;s examining something too private in open public stores even under the clothed jeans.. he yeeps and runs back out with the groceries. <br />
<br />
Just as the door opens behind him, he starts to slide across the seat and into the passenger side of the car.. Still thinking he&#39;s a normal man, he turns around and starts to smile.. &quot;Hey buddy! Long time no see!&quot; He says.. He opens the door, getting in the passenger seat. The car smells like something&#39;s been here for awhile, and its over powering. He starts to breathe heavy again, smelling something nice.. and his blood goes cold.. All thoughts of food, or shopping, are forgotten.. His eyes are on us.. In the back room.. His eyes look back.. thinking about Anthony.. but then he whimpers.. &quot;I.. I can&#39;t let him know this is happening.. He&#39;d never let me live it down..&quot; Charles panics.. He tries to shake the feeling out of his mind.. And yet.. There&#39;s a sort of wild thrill being a feline predator.. One that preys on the weak.. That has to eat.. He sniffs the air, eyes wide as he moves to grab something from the backseat.. He remembers the images he saw.. Reminded him of his deepest darkest fantasies.. In a back room.. Where all predators hung out.. If only he could find it again.. His finger moves toward the doorhandle.. As he grips the handle, his blood flows cold.. Fear fills him completely.. &quot;I<br />
<br />
As he finally lifts his head up, his eyes start to water.. He wipes his eyes, only to notice that the light has started to dim.. The sky is darkening.. As he looks down, he notices his hands have turned into paws.. He lets out a howl of agony, grabbing his crotch with his free paw, clawing at his skin. He stops when he hears something come crashing through the window behind him. &quot;Hey! Do you think you can drive the next leg of the trip! We&#39;re almost there, only 20 miles.. I uh.. Have something i need to take care of!&quot; Charles responds, shivering.. He gives a way back to his car and <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure! I&#39;d love to, it won&#39;t be far!&quot; Someone says from his truck, picking up the wheel as you drive us the last 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
Time passes, a brief 20 minutes as we rumble down the road. Charles is sitting in the back now with us, all in a car together. The walkie talkie no longer needed. He seems a bit different then we last saw.. His hands seem a bit more.. bigger and broader than we remember.. and he has.. A nice smell that seems to smell like cedar and pinecone.. it&#39;s a very nice scent. But it also feels like it has a infectious warmth to it.. Like our bodies are getting lighter next to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets stop right here guys! Why don&#39;t we go enjoy these rustic outdoors! All those.. Hehe... heady fantasys are a bit much.. But so can just be a escape.. Enjoying the moment. Having some fun out in the sun, right? Lets enjoy this summer day!&quot; Charles yells out.. He then throws open his door, stepping out of the car, looking about..<br />
<br />
They spend another few hours driving, catching up on gossip and random things until they eventually arrive at an ancient wilderness forest park, off the road.. It looks quite serene, and peaceful.. A nearby sign indicating it&#39;s a popular off the road spot for campers.. But there&#39;s a animal warning.  After securing the area, they set up camp for the night, bringing down sleeping bags, camp pads, and....<br />
<br />
Charles yelps and lands on all fours.. his clothes shredding apart as he snarls and growls, claws scratching the ground. He begins running in circles, sniffing.. When he hears the sound of someone else approaching.. He charges forward, throwing himself against the legs of the person who is walking towards them.. They fall to the ground.. Their grip slipping from his claws. &quot;Charles!!&quot; Some one screams as he starts to attack.<br />
<br />
But.. The Attack is anything but.. Charles gasps out.. Heavily breathing as he cries out.. Fur is bursting from his arms as he starts to have it creep down his thighs, his anus is black and puckered while his cock is small, feline and red.. And yet.. A big black juicy feline slit trails down his legs.. Copious amounts of soaked fur pouring from his rear.. His claws are still scratching at the earth as he squirms, shuddering.. He opens his mouth and hisses.. He lays his ears back.. Growling out as his body starts to sweat, slicked with wet fur.. It drips onto the ground beneath him.. He whines and blinks, ears flopping.. He struggles to move, trying to climb to his feet.. But every muscle in his body burns and aches as if he was just run though a meat grinder..<br />
<br />
 He sighs out, putting his head down.. Panting heavily.. Wishing he could lick himself clean.. But all he can do is lay there.. He pants and whines.. He gasps and groans.. He whines and moans.. His transformation is almost 75% of the way there.. he&#39;s on all fours, sexually completed and now has the complete frame of a cougar cat.. But the fur is still spreading from his thighs, and his eyes still keep their color... His head kinda looks like a smoother egyptian cat, or a shaved cougar as the fur hasn&#39;t spread, but his ears are perking up the cougar form and becoming pink.<br />
<br />
He tries to stand again, pushing himself up.. Groaning loudly, before lying down on his side, panting heavily.. &quot;.. I.. I Don&#39;t know what came over... Oh.. Please.. it&#39;s burning.. I can&#39;t think.. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on...  All i know is.. I ... I feel.. A instinctual need... And.. I don&#39;t want it.. But.. My body needs it..&quot; He breathes, laying down on his side, his head between his front legs.... &quot;i.. I Can&#39;t hold back.. Any Longer.. Please!! I just need a cock so i can think again.. I&#39;m still in here.. I swear!! I Just!!! Aahh.. AHHH!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Charles screams out and yelps as his thighs drip and he has a wet orgasm, splashing all over his feline she pussy.. His chest and face still bear a masculine frame.. and yet the sopping feline pussy, alien on his body.. is so beautiful.. It even smells pleasant.. Not like the usual smell of a pussy, but it&#39;s an exotic scent, something unidentifiable. He groans, his hips jerking as he comes, cumming hard, grunting, clawing the dirt with his nails.. But he doesn&#39;t notice.. Because he&#39;s too focused on how hot his pussy is feeling on his body.. The scent intoxicatingly strong.. As he rolls onto his back, enjoying the pussy rubbing against his pubes, purring with pleasure. He licks the fur away from his face, trying to regain control of his thoughts.. &quot; <br />
What am I?&quot; He asks himself.. How did he get into this situation.. What is happening?? His body feels new.. yet so comfortable. His body feels powerful.. Sleek and feline, he can dash faster than he ever could before.. His body feels like it&#39;s full of wild muscle, carefree and freed from all worldly responsibilities.. And yet..  <br />
<br />
His heart pounds and he groans out loud, before turning around and moving towards the trees, finding some shade where he can lie down and get comfortable.. He lets out a low whine, closing his eyes and giving in to his instincts.. Being consumed by a primal urge to fuck, to release.. To eat.. To mate.. He wants to be fucked.. He needs to be fucked.. Even more then he needs food..<br />
<br />
He turns around and starts to walk through the woods, his strides long and steady as he heads towards the main campsite.. He can hear people talking and laughing.. and a loud crunching noise which makes him pause for a moment.. Before he starts to walk again....<br />
<br />
The people have barely time to close their eyes before it&#39;s too late..<br />
<br />
<br />
... As he steals a nacho flavored bag of chips, and dashes back into the woods.. Munching on them, they crunch.. But then this fuels a new desire... He moans between his new needy sex dripping.. But how does he want it to be sated?? He was overwhelmed by fantasy.. And yet.. Human on animal just.. Still seems wrong even to him.. Animal on Human.. Having a powerful animal have their way with a human to have their will.. Just seems fun.. But the other way around? That just still weirder, creepy and perverted. For some reason he&#39;s just not into the idea of having a human be his first mate when turned into a animal.. It feels so weird to have a double standard in his mind for it, yet it still feels right to keep it... A animal having it&#39;s way with a human is fun.. A human going for a female animal is just uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
 He gets the impression that anyone who says yes would be a weirdo, and anyone forced into it would be confused.. Which wouldn&#39;t help his case at all.. So he keeps on walking, following the instinct within him.. And he finds another target..<br />
<br />
Charles walks closer and closer to the area, where the animal sightings had been last seen.. He can smell a male creature&#39;s musk.. And the familiar odor of his blood mixed with the others scent hits him deep inside, making him shiver and quiver with arousal.. He rubs his claws on his paw and smiles, looking forward to taking his prey into his mouth.. But it&#39;s like a lightswitch.. The smell of blood triggers something.. not the hunger for human flesh no no.. he can still control himself and think.. And now he&#39;s hungry for deer and elk..<br />
<br />
<br />
But he just needs to eat to feed his body.. Needs to satisfy the primitive urges within him, but there are no animals nearby.. Just humans here.. He&#39;s not going to maul a hiker just to eat them.. No.. He&#39;ll just move on to territory.. But.. Some of that junk food still smells good to his powerful new senses.. Even though dogs are famed for their noses being supposedly 40x stronger than a human&#39;s.. Felines still have a sense of smell 15x stronger than us.. Normally they wouldn&#39;t be attracted to junk food, but unfortunately.. Charles was not a conventional human nor a cougar.. he was a newly transformed cougar.. With a super sensitive nose... <br />
<br />
His muzzle dives into the bags of chips, ripping it apart as if it was a mere toy, he rips it open and eats it.. And then sneaks away to steal some more food from the campers, stealing hot dogs as they pick open on his teeth.. But eventually the human camp starts becoming more wary, they quiver for a moment.. and then start to yell at him, throw rocks and brandish fire.. He hisses for a moment and backs away... his Body becoming more and more feline by the moment as the creeping fur up his eyes surrounds and narrows his eyes into a bright golden view.... He chomps and has his snack.. But it&#39;s still not enough.. But unbeknownst to him.. Something around the area.. is Close.. Watching.. Waiting..</p>
