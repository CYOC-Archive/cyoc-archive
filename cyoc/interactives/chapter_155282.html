<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>A huge shout out to Anonymous for helping break my writers block with his other chapter. I have canabalised pats of his chapter to lead the story in the direction I want to take it, while keeping the inspiration I got from his chapter. Please feel free to add your own moving forward, as it&#39;s not truly CYOC without branching options :-)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kaiden woke up wedged in between Jace, Duncan and Wade. All four men naked on the bare mattress in the frats basement. Smiling as he remembered the countless loads he had taken the night before, Kaiden snuggled into Jace&#39;s arm, his movements causing Duncan to shift slightly behind him, grinding his newly enlarged package against Kaiden&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
Kaiden knew they three guy&#39;s hadn&#39;t quite cum enough last night to make their new additions permanent yet. Their captive balls emptied over and over until the three men collapsed in complete exhaustion. Kaiden knew their cocks must be aching from such exertion, although he couldn&#39;t deny that he felt incredible.<br />
Except for the growing rumbling of an empty stomach.<br />
<br />
Slowly extracting himself from the pile, Kaiden don his boxers, and crept upstairs to the kitchen. Preparing a large tray of scrambled eggs, bacon, toast and coffee which he slowly carried down the stairs, avoiding  making any noise, before setting everything up on a few empty boxes and waking the guys up.<br />
<br />
As they ate, Kaiden couldn&#39;t help but smile euphorically. He knew his jaw, throat and ass should be aching, but they felt absolutely fine. No aches or pains. If anything, he felt like he could run a marathon, or right several essays in one day. His mind seemed to be working faster then normal, and it didn&#39;t take him long to fetch the phallomancy book, and start putting a few post it marks on specific pages.<br />
<br />
Kaiden was figuring a few things out. The author had only used their own experience with cock transformation to write the book, which meant they didn&#39;t know all the rules or restrictions...<br />
..or the real capabilities. Kaiden theorized that the dicked guys still had something of their life-force inside them, even after their minds gave into to their new roles as functional cocks. Being connected to another person must provide them with some of that energy, potentially improving other aspects of their lives. <br />
<br />
Unless they shoot it all out, like they had last night.<br />
Kaiden was feeling so amazing because of how much cum, and therefore power he had absorbed from last night.<br />
<br />
Kaiden&#39;s mind kept working as he emptied out his backpack on the floor. Separating out the Alpha&#39;s wallets, separating their money and cutting up their cards and IDs. Next, he went through their phones, surprised to find only one of them was smart enough to have a passcode set. Going through their information yielded nothing of value, and even their social media accounts were relatively clean. Arrogant and skeevy, but nothing illegal. He didn’t find the video from last night on the three unlocked phones, which meant there was only one possibility, and he felt like there might be more than one piece of damning evidence on the device. He tried a couple obvious guesses, but stopped before the phone locked him out and wiped its contents.<br />
<br />
The basement door swinging shut with a small bang caused Kaiden to have  a small flashback to earlier last night. Being held at gunpoint, learning the true depths of the Alpha&#39;s depravity. He still felt guilty that he had taken their lives away, but he was able to see that at the time, there wasn&#39;t any other choice. Plus it was hard to not to enjoy the strange feeling of innate power that was flowing through him today.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“I see you’ve already started,” Duncan said quietly as he came down the stairs, freshly showered. “How do you do this?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, well, I just kind of concentrate on who I want to—“<br />
<br />
“No, no, I mean how do you do THIS,” he said, pointing towards the piles of clothes. “How do you live with dicking people? How can you be so nonchalant about what’s basically murder?”<br />
<br />
“Look, Duncan,” Kaiden started, not sure how to say what he needed to, but knowing the words would come if he just started talking. “I’m not okay with this, y’know, in and of itself. But those guys...they’re monsters. The first one I dicked threatened Jace and I with slashing our tires and getting us kicked out of college. And that’s not just empty threats. Those Alphas have some kind of sway in this town: nobody stands up to them, not the school, not the professors, not even the police. Jared was blackmailing me into sucking his dick when I...when I first figured out I could do this.”<br />
<br />
He paused, reading the shock and conflict in Duncan’s face. He was abhorred with the Alphas too, but he still didn’t think dicking them was right. <br />
<br />
“Duncan, I understand. This isn’t right. But what other choice do we have? Do we just let them continue to rape and abuse everyone they come across? They were going to blackmail all of us, rape Jessica and that other girl, and possibly even shoot us! They have no fear, they have to be stopped. But you’re right. I... I don’t want to dick anyone else. If we can get into Luke’s phone, I think we can put an end to this.”<br />
<br />
“Luke...” Duncan repeated slowly, Kaiden realizing that the 10-inch beast now hanging from Duncan’s crotch must be Luke. “I...I can still hear him...begging.”<br />
<br />
“Tell him...” Kaiden said, realizing how he would get into this phone, “tell him we’ll let him go if he gives us the password.”<br />
<br />
“We’ll let him go?! But what if he reports us?”<br />
<br />
“First of all, who’s going to believe him? ‘I got kidnapped and turned into a penis!’ No one will believe him. But secondly,” he moved in, whispering in Duncan’s ear, not sure whether Luke could still hear as a cock, but directing his voice only to Duncan with his mind. “we’re not going to release him.”<br />
<br />
Duncan’s eyes went wider, but he nodded in understanding. This was it, this was the end of the Alphas. And they all had to be in on it. Duncan focused on talking to Luke through their mental bond, clearly finding it hard to focus as his Luke-penis went fully erect at the prospect of being released. Then, Duncan turned to Kaiden.<br />
<br />
“2367,” he said simply, his hand starting to slowly stroke the engorged length absentmindedly as he watched Kaiden pore through Luke&#39;s phone.<br />
<br />
Kaiden unlocked the phone and found exactly what he was looking for, pressing play on the video...<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m all set, just tell me when to start filming.”<br />
<br />
“Wait until he&#39;s inside the girl. The tapes can&#39;t show Tyler&#39;s size or else Kyle will get us all kicked out.”<br />
<br />
“How long have the Alpha&#39;s been doing this?”<br />
<br />
“Since the frat was founded in the 70&#39;s. EVERY single Alpha has been on tape fucking a roophied girl. Recorded proof for our brothers that they take what they want, and meet all the requirements of being a true ALPHA. Once an Alpha, always an alpha.”<br />
….......<br />
<br />
This was it. The video that could put an end to the Alphas and blow this whole thing wide open. Duncan realized the gravity of the evidence in front of them.<br />
<br />
“You’re right, Kaiden. These guys have to be stopped. Let’s get rid of their stuff; then we can find a way to get this video out there without linking it to us.”<br />
<br />
….............................................................................................................<br />
<br />
Kaiden was beaming, as he led Duncan upstairs to Ryan&#39;s room. A fantasy in his head playing out about today being the day everything changed. The Alpha&#39;s publicly humiliated, arrested, dragged through the courts, and staring down the long prison sentences they had earned. Justice.<br />
They just needed Ryan to find a way to remove their identities from the video before they could &#39;leak it&#39; to the authorities.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, things often don&#39;t play out as planned.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry Kades, but I can&#39;t remove you from the video without cutting the gunpoint parts out or making the whole thing look clearly edited, and that..”<br />
<br />
“...wouldn&#39;t hold up in court.” Kaiden cut Ryan off. As Ryan hung his head apologetically.<br />
<br />
Kaiden ignored him as he spent a few minutes poring over the phone before handing it over to Ryan.<br />
<br />
“There are four videos of other rapes on here. The Alpha&#39;s cant be identified but the girls can. Find out who they are and we might be able to pinpoint their rapist. Even if it won&#39;t hold up in court I want to see this through...”<br />
<br />
As Kaiden started walking away, he stopped and turned around suddenly, new ideas flooding his mind. <br />
<br />
“Ryan. I&#39;ll bring all four phones up. Copy their contacts and social media friends lists. Then start looking up who they are. I have a feeling some of those contacts are previous Alphas in powerful positions, such as in the police, or even congress. I need to know who to watch out for. Additionally, trick or disable the phones tracking before you hand them back to me. Also, the cops WILL come around today and ask questions, the timing is too suspicious for the Alpha&#39;s not to suspect us, so be prepared to hide them a short notice. Maybe inside your pillow case. They probably won&#39;t even look inside the bed if they walk in on you and Paul fucking. You already know the story for our alibi&#39;s.<br />
Oh, and one more thing, Ryan. The most important thing.”<br />
<br />
Ryan nodded silently as he felt the intensity of Kaiden&#39;s gaze.<br />
“How many times last night?”<br />
<br />
Ryan swallowed before whispering. “Seven.” <br />
Kaiden smiled as he stepped close to Ryan, his hand gently resting on his red running shorts.<br />
Kaiden reached his mind out, connecting with the cockmeat that was once Tyler, and saw flashes of the night prior, including the final explosive orgasm that caused Paul and Ryan to collapse. Tyler&#39;s mind giving in as he succumbed to the pleasure of being a cock, fading away into nothing but urges and impulses.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s done though. You two enjoy your new dick&#39;s. Just remember to keep them a secret until you both graduate.” <br />
Kaiden winked as he headed downstairs.<br />
<br />
 …..................................................................<br />
<br />
It was just after noon when Duncan, Kaiden and Wade managed to sneak over the fence, down the walkway and a down the block to their car. <br />
<br />
They had been delayed, as Kaiden had insisted on milking another load from each of them, which had turned into three each once the two men got into the groove. Kaiden got the two men to swallow one load from their own cocks, and even one load from each others, observing the effects on their libido and mental state, which were clearly enhanced by the power of cum from a transformed cock.<br />
<br />
Once they were in the car, they called Jessica, who was with Kelly and, needing a ride from the hospital after being taken in for a rape test, despite never actually being penetrated.<br />
With all five of them in the car, they talked about what had happened and showed the girls the video of the night before. Kelly bursting into tears while watching it.<br />
<br />
The girls were on board with destroying the Alpha&#39;s and discussed their plan. Jessica being extra motivated, as she recognized three of the four other girls on Luke&#39;s phone.<br />
Returning to Duncan and Wades motel room, Jessica and Kelly agreed that the tape from the night before should be modified, the originals destroyed.<br />
<br />
Duncan and Wade would join the Alpha frat, as they had deniability in the frat guys disappearance last night, and they would provide their own tapes directly to the Alpha&#39;s leader, using the video recording implicating Tyler as not being truly big enough to be an Alpha to guarantee Kyle&#39;s silence and support.<br />
<br />
That evening, after talking one of her sorority sisters to organize the entire house to go out and protest on campus for the lack of safety. Jessica used her laptop to recreate the noise of a party going on, before her and Kelly got dressed in the same clothing and makeup they wore the previous night, and each taking several sleeping tablets.<br />
<br />
The five of the each solemnly agreed on their pact of secrecy, and assured Alpha destruction, before the girls finally drifted off to sleep. Duncan and Wade stripping down and rolling condoms onto their captive cocks.<br />
<br />
Having sex with the unconscious girls, was mentally difficult for the two gay men, but filled with resolve, and flowing with absorbed energy from that afternoon, they managed to put on a convincing performance of awkwardly enjoying what the Alpha&#39;s would refer to as sex.<br />
<br />
After they had finished and the filming was done, the guys got dressed, cleaning the girls up in the way they had agreed earlier, before writing a small note and sliding them under their pillows and slipping out of the sorority house.<br />
The deed was done.<br />
<br />
…....................<br />
<br />
Dropping Kaiden off at the entrance to the back walkway, Wade stopped him from exiting the car.<br />
“Hey Kaiden. Um, I-I gotta ask you something. While I was &#39;doing&#39; Kelly, I felt kinda weird, like I was enjoying it physically more then I should of, but my mind was totally against it and I&#39;m not even into girls and I-”<br />
<br />
Kaiden cut Wade off with a stern look.<br />
“Those feeling were from Tony. He&#39;s still in there.” Kaiden pointed at Wade&#39;s crotch.<br />
“For now. Remember to enjoy the things you normally enjoy when it comes to your cock and those thoughts and feelings will get wiped out of him. For now, I recommend jerking off at least twice a day, and eating your own cum, I&#39;ll check on you both in a couple of days to make sure you are doing OK and their change is complete.”<br />
<br />
“WOW!” Wade sat back in his seat, processing everything he had just heard. “Those sick fuckers really deserved this.” The reality finally hitting home before Wade looked back at Kaiden.<br />
“ONLY twice a day, huh. That&#39;s not gonna be hard to beat with this thick piece between my legs.” He chuckled as waved goodbye to Kaiden, driving off as Kaiden snorted. Trying not to laugh at the sudden change of tone.<br />
<br />
Slipping back into the Beta house, Kaiden had just enough time for an update from Ryan and Jace before the police showed up, questioning everyone in the frat about their whereabouts the last 48 hours. The entire frat maintaining each others alibis and challenging the police on their harassment of them over the car bombing.<br />
It was only as the police were leaving that they mentioned that the four accused Alpha&#39;s hadn&#39;t been seen since last night. Although there were reports of one of the Beta&#39;s at a sorority house where two girls were almost raped.<br />
<br />
The shock was palpable as the police left. The entire frat whispering and scrutinizing each other.<br />
Kaiden knew that none would remember him being present since he wasn&#39;t, so he pulled Jace aside, kissing him passionately in the hallway, and pretending not to notice when several of his frat brothers walked into the hallway, stopping in their tracks, and then silently backtracking into the front living room with the other Beta&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Leading Jace upstairs, Kaiden knew the rumors that would now spread of their relationship would almost completely wipe suspicion off him, although there would still be some murmurs. Kaiden felt further pangs of guilt, however, when he found himself on his knees, throat stretched full of thick, pulsing cock, staring up at Jace&#39;s face. That mix of carnal lust and adoration. The guilt seemed to fade away, slowly becoming nothing as the continued to coax load after thick creamy load from the sexy Australians balls.</p>
