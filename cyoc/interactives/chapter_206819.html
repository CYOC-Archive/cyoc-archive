<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff let out a contented sigh, despite his house being occupied by a small army of children things were relatively quiet. The kids had been fed, their parents would be here in a couple of hours, and he had an entire week off from school.<br />
<br />
Jeffs peace though was to be short lived as someone now began aggressively knocking at his front door. Groaning in annoyance, Jeff now answered the door wearily gazing at his annoyed neighbor Hannah Miller. &quot;Can I help you Ms. Miller?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah scowled, the woman casting Jeff a foul look before speaking. &quot;Is that boy Joey here,&quot; she asked. Jeff nodded, realizing that Hannah was Joey&#39;s next door neighbor. Flashes now came to Jeffs mind. Hannah Miller was not a fan of the anxiety ridden Joey or his brand new puppy. In fact she wasn&#39;t a fan of children in general. Ms. Miller was the type of neighbor that would constantly tell kids to get off her lawn or to quiet down if they were playing too loud. More often than Jeff cared to recall, Ms. Miller would call the children&#39;s parents to complain about what their children had done. Considering she now stood on Jeffs front stoop, he suspected this was not going to be a pleasant experience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Joey just got here,&quot; Jeff sighed. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That brat let his dog use the bathroom on my lawn,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I saw it with my own eyes. Letting that beast pee all over my bushes. If you&#39;re watching him than I want an explanation. You&#39;re obviously not watching that kid very well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff groaned, his shoulders slumping wearily. If Joey hadn&#39;t cleaned up dog poo he could understand but a dog peeing was ridiculous, especially on a pair of bushes that was right on the property line. Digging into his pocket, Jeff once more brought up the Chronovac. &quot;Whats one more,&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
Typing in Hannah Millers stats, Jeff nodded.<br />
<br />
Name: Hannah Miller<br />
Age: 51<br />
Mental age: 51<br />
Height: 5&#39;11&quot;<br />
Weight: 177 lbs<br />
Build: Average <br />
Gender: female<br />
<br />
Jeff was surprised to see Hannah weighed as much as she did. The woman appeared thin, Jeff wondering if her weight was due to muscle. Perhaps Hannah was an athlete. Typing in the changes, he now smirked.<br />
<br />
Name: Hannah Miller<br />
Age: 6<br />
Mental Age: 6<br />
Relationship Memory: Ryan Huff (friend), Tommy Davis (friend), Jane Warner (friend), Lizzie Wolf (friend), Joey Fisher (best friend)<br />
Height: 3&#39;6&quot;<br />
Weight 45 lbs<br />
Build: Skinny<br />
Gender: female<br />
Alter reality to fit? Yes<br />
Alter clothes to fit? Yes <br />
<br />
As the beam of light now washed over Mrs. Miller, Jeff studied the woman carefully. Dressed in black slacks with dark slip on shoes and a light blue blouse, Hannah looked as if she had just come home from work. Jeff noticing the womans dull sandy brown bobcut and lines around her eyes and mouth. She wasn&#39;t unattractive even in her 50s but her attitude was definitely a turn off. Maybe a second stint in first grade would improve her attitude.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched as Hannah retreated through her 40s entering her 30s. Hannah&#39;s posture seemed to improve, her blouse hugging rather large breasts that Jeff guessed to be in D cup range. Already he could tell their was a difference in Hannah, her voice no longer as grating.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly Hannah&#39;s clothing didn&#39;t change much as she continued to youthen. Hannah maintaining her professional attire. As she retreated into her 20s Jeff watched her hair beginning tobgrow past her shoulders, regaining its sandy brown luster. Jeff raised an eyebrow as Hannah&#39;s clothing began to shift. The womans slacks becoming  a pair of yoga with a form fitting short sleeved shirt. Hannah&#39;s flats now becoming a pair of running shoes with white ankle socks. Jeff&#39;s eyes widening as he studied the atttractivevwoman, apparently she had been a bit of an athlete in her younger days.<br />
<br />
Jeff gazed intently at the rather attractive looking woman as she raced back towards college. Hannah&#39;s voice was becoming softer, warmer as she retreated in age. Jeff watching as the womans muscles became leaner, more well defined with each year loss. As she reentered college, Jeff almost gaped as her tshirt vanished, leaving her wearing a pink sports bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate bugging you about Joey,&quot; Hannah sighed. &quot;But I keep asking him to clean up after Barney. The other day I almost slipped on dog poo when I was going out for my run. I can&#39;t afford to lose my scholarship over an injury.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Jeff stated, watching as Hannah began retreating through college. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize you had a scholarship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Full ride soccer scholarship,&quot; the now 20 year old grinned. &quot;Hoping to get some more playing time this year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff watched as Hannah now exited college, her muscles thinning as the gains of college vanished. Hannah&#39;s clothing also shifted, a tshirt with their schools logo appearing as her yoga pants moved up her legs into a pair of athletic shorts. Hannah&#39;s face also began to round slightly, her hazel eyes sparkling with energy. Jeff now recalled Hannah as the star soccer player at his school.<br />
<br />
Hannah now began retreating through high school, her muscles thinning as her once impressive bust began to diminish. Jeff now recalled a rather cute athletic 15 year old. The girl was already seen as a sport star despite only playing high school soccer for a short period of time.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how are you Jeff,&quot; Hannah asked shyly. &quot;You and Alicia still dating?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff balked as he gazed at the teen. The girl had shrank slightly, bringing her height slightly below Jeffs. Jeff recalling the two being neighbors, Hannah actually babysitting the kids sometimes when she wasn&#39;t at practice. What was more astounding was that the teenage girl had developed a bit of a crush on Jeff. &quot;Yeah still dating,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Hannah nodded, the girl becoming skinnier as she left high school behind. Jeff watched as Hannah&#39;s clothing shifted once more, her tshirt becoming a looser plain tshirt with a pair of mesh shorts. Jeff noticing Hannah grow shorter, her breasts melting away into small mounds as she became 12.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know my mom says I can start babysitting when I turn 14,&quot; she said happily. <br />
<br />
&quot;You want to babysit, &quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I mean I see how much fun you seem to have,&quot; she stated. &quot;Plus I hear babysitters make a bunch of money. I could buy those soccer cleats that I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, a small smile cracking across his face as he watched Hannah descend into the single digits. Puberty had now completely abandoned the sandy haired girl. Hannah&#39;s clothes shifting once more into a baggy purple tshirt, her shoes becoming a pair of well worn purple sneakers. Obviously Hannah was a high energy kid who loved to play. Jeff noticing her long sandy brown hair tied in a ponytail, her round childish face beaming with an energetic smile.<br />
<br />
Hannah&#39;s regression now slowed, the young girl now settling in at 6. Jeff noting her purple tshirt had shrank down to fit her, a soccer ball emblazoned on the front while her shorts were now a sturdy and simple black shorts. Jeff gazed at the girls shoes, noting they appeared to be black and sporty sneakers, the type of sneakers parents would buy for a child engaged in alot of sports with white tube socks. Hannah now beamed up at Jeff with an exuberant smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Joey here,&quot; she asked, her voice tinged with energy. &quot;I thought I saw him come here with Barney.&quot; Jeff now gestured to the anxiety ridden boy, Hannah&#39;s smile lighting up the room as she saw her best friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joey!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey&#39;s eyes went wide as Hannah bounded towards him, the girl practically tackling him as she hugged him. Jeff stifled a laugh, his memories of Hannah becoming a bit clearer.<br />
<br />
Hannah was a ray of sunshine and a ball of energy. Jeff remembering Alicia describing the girl as having Tiger Energy after watching her. Hannah got along surprisingly well with the other kids. She was protective of her best friend Joey, sticking up for the boy and encouraging him to do things the nervous boy would otherwise be to scared to try. <br />
<br />
Hannah also got along well with both Ryan and Tommy, the three children realizing they were better athletes than their friends, pushing eachothers limits in sports. Hannah even got along with both Lizzie and Jane. Hannah laughing hysterically at Lizzies jokes and wanting to play with the girl. When it came to Jane the two girls got along well enough, yet Jane was slightly annoyed that Hannah was dismissive of Janes mother henning. As long as Jane wasn&#39;t trying to tell Hannah what to do the girls got along fine. Hannah, from what Jeff could tell, was was a sunny, energetic girl that brought out the best in her friends.<br />
<br />
Hannah now sat up a wide smile on her face as Barney now began to jump on her. The girl giggling as the puppy began to lock her face. &quot;Good boy Barney,&quot; she exclaimed happily. &quot;You&#39;re a good puppy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smirked, watching the ever growing number of first graders now begin to talk. Ironically he was making his neighborhood alot younger, and alot happier. He couldn&#39;t help but wonder what else was in store for him with the Chronovac.</p>
