<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Raiden and Sachiko launched themselves forward, wildly brawling with the nine tailed kumiho. Neither kit were especially skilled as fighters, they had grown up sheltered, their parents keeping the children safe.<br />
<br />
What magic and fighting skill they did have was now on full display. Choon Hee grunted in annoyance, for the nine tail kumiho it was like dealing with knats. &quot;You brats,&quot; she growled. Choon Hee now seized Sachiko by her tail, slamming the snow white anthro to the ground.<br />
<br />
Sachiko was seeing stars, the anthro fox trying to gain her bearings. Turning her gaze upwards as the kumiho now stomped down on her. Sachiko coughed, spitting up blood as the kumiho snarled at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave Sachiko ALONE,&quot; Raiden bellowed. Choon Hee turned, seeing the dark furred kitsune leaping onto the kumiho&#39;s chest. Raiden now screamed, the kit angrier than he had ever been, as he delivered furious punches onto Choon Hee&#39;s face. <br />
<br />
Chonn Hee now stumbled backwards, trying to shake the young kitsune off. It amazed her at the viciousness this child had as he attacked. Still, he was still a child. Useing her tails she now snared the kit around the throat. &quot;Damn it get off,&quot; Choon Hee exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Sachiko rubbed her head, shaking off the cobwebs as she turned to Choon Hee. The young kitsune now gasped as she watched Raiden now repeatedly slammed to the ground. The sound was sickening, as the boys body crashed to the ground over and over again. After hitting the ground close to a dozen times, Choon Hee now spiked the kit, Raidens body tumbling in a heap as he weakly looked at his attacker.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Sachiko screamed. &quot;Raiden! RAIDEN!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Raiden was defenseless, the kits eyes blurry as he watched the kumiho approach. The dark furred kit saw a white blur try to help only to be struck down. Sachiko lay near, unconscious but alive. &quot;Sachiko,&quot; he whimpered as he reached for his friend.<br />
<br />
Choon Hee grinned as she stared down at the limp bodies of the two celestial kits. &quot;All too easy,&quot; she smirked.<br />
<br />
A clap like thunder now echoed through the woods. Raiden tried to focus as an orange blur now shot forward knocking the kumiho back. Slowly Raiden now recognized the figure that stood above him, breathing a sigh of relief. &quot;Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Choon Hee groaned as she now extracted herself from the Grove of trees she had been knocked into. Whatever had hit her, hit like a ton of bricks. Standing she now saw a nine tailed kitsune glaring at her. A kitsune she vaguely recognized. &quot;Hey don&#39;t I know you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu stared at Choon Hee in confusion. &quot;A kumiho,&quot; he whispered. &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
Choon Hee groaned as she stood, dusting herself off as she studied Fukushu intently. &quot;Wait I do know you,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Tatsu&#39;s kid. Its Fukushu right? Didn&#39;t we kill your master?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu said nothing, his brow furrowing as he now unsheathed his sword.&quot;I don&#39;t know how you survived creature,&quot; he growled. &quot;But your time in the land of the living has come to an end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You dad said something like that,&quot; Choon Hee grinned. &quot;Right after we killed your master. Cmon Fukushu, we both know all your boosting is alot of hot air!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu growled, releasing a powerful blast that now obliterated the trees around Choon Hee. The kumiho barely avoiding the blast. Choon Hee remembered Fukushu. When the kumiho declared war on the kitsune he had been a young three tailed warrior. A warrior with a reputation for his skill and his temper. Choon Hee recalled how brutal the son of Tatsu had been after Akane was killed. Fukushu had made a point of slaughtering entire villages of kumiho.<br />
<br />
Choon Hee also recalled how the kitsunes temper could get the best of him. Fukushus rage had almost gotten him killed in one engagement, a kumiho taunting the warrior into a critical mistake that cost the lives of his men. Now, Choon Hee would try to use that rage to kill the kits.<br />
<br />
&quot;You missed,&quot; Choon Hee mocked. &quot;You know your father was better at this! He wouldn&#39;t have missed. No wonder your master died.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Insolent bastard,&quot; Fukushu snarled.  The kitsune now darted forward, delivering a body blow that sent the kumiho soaring through the air.<br />
<br />
Choon Hee crashed to the forest floor, coughing up blood as she stared at the enraged kitsune. &quot;Thats it,&quot; she thought with a grin. &quot;Give into your anger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You call that a punch,&quot; Choon Hee mocked. &quot;What happened to the legendary and fearsome Fukushu? The kitsune who slaughtered entire cities of Kumiho.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll show you,&quot; Fukushu grinned with malicious glee as he now charged forward. Chonn Hee grinned as she now prepared herself.<br />
<br />
Fukushu now began to strike with his blade, Choon Hee useing her tails to protect herself. She couldn&#39;t keep this up for long but, she didn&#39;t have to. She just needed to draw the kitsune away.<br />
<br />
Fukushu roared as he now began to overwhelm the kumiho. As improbable as it seemed these monsters and mortal enemy of the kitsune had returned. Worse, they were trying to kill his son. This kumiho did not possess his skill, either with magic or with a blade. With a blood curdling war cry he now impaled the kumiho before splitting her in half. Wiping the blood from his blade he now gazed at the lifeless, bisected body, of the kumiho.<br />
<br />
Choon Hee now began to giggle, an unnerving sight as its face was split in half. &quot;You know what I always liked about you Fukushu,&quot; Choon Hee grinned. &quot;You&#39;re always so predictable. Get you mad and watch you charge. Thanks for that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fukushu&#39;s eyes went wide as the bisected body of Choon Hee began to fade away. &quot;An illusion,&quot; he thought in alarm. Turning the kitsunes throat now went dry as he saw how far he was from the kits, and how close the kumiho was to them.<br />
<br />
Fukushu screamed, rushing forward as he now tried to save his son. Choon Hee had grabbed Raiden and Sachiko by the throat with her tails. The kumiho licking her lips as she looked to tear the hearts out of the kits.<br />
<br />
Choon Hee had won, the kits would die. As she looked to deliver the fatal blow she was suddenly stopped, thrown backwards by something extremely powerful. Dusting herself off the kumiho now gasped as she beheld a teenage boy and his ethereal companion.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can&quot;t be,&quot; Choon Hee gasped. &quot;Your dead! You&#39;ve been dead!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren now stood between the kits, Misaki and Choon Hee. The Dragons Tongue glowing a brilliant white as the ghostly figure of Akane now protected them all. Choon Hee growled at the ghost before looking between Fukushu and Akane. &quot;This isn&#39;t over,&quot; she snarled as she vanished into the ether.<br />
<br />
Fukushu now stopped before his son, picking the boy up. Raiden was alive but hurt. As he turned to Darren and the ghost of Akane, he was stunned to see his old master. &quot;Akane,&quot; he whispered. &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane simply smirked, giving Fukushu a wink and a wave before vanishing once more. Darren and Fukushu now exchanged a knowing look, realizing they had much to discuss.</p>
