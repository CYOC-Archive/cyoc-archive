<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh that can&#39;t be good&quot; Mark got out just before the remote clattered to the ground. First it vibrated, then it stuttered and then it stopped. Hesitant, Mark reached towards the remote, when a spark leapt out to him sending out a further blinding light.<br />
<br />
Rubbing his eyes and coughing, Mark came to. &#39;But that wasn&#39;t right&#39;, he thought, &#39;that sounded deeper than usual&#39;. Mark tried to stand up, yet struggled as he weight a new weight across his lap. Looking down Mark saw a young-adult, older than Jen was, yet shorter with a petite figure. As his vision fully returned he could see this woman was actually quite toned, with clear muscles across her abdomen all the way down her sleek tight thighs. Mark hadn&#39;t even stopped to think about how she was completely naked in his lap, he was just transfixed by her figure and these things were starting to surprise him left.<br />
<br />
&quot;zzzzz... urgh&quot; the noises from the still woman snapped Mark back to attention; &#39;was she really sleeping on him?&#39; Mark thought, though another loud snore confirmed this for him. As she tossed around a little, Mark noticed a familiar rainbow hair pin in her hair. &#39;Wait isn&#39;t that the same one Heidi was wearing a moment ago?&#39; Checking over her again, he noticed the subtle similarities to Heidi, just grown up and with some serious working out. Mark was about to call her name to confirm his feelings, when another new voice called out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you dare wake her. I just got back from tiring Heidi out, so if you do, its your turn this time babe.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark looked up, to find an even older girl standing right in front him, hand on hip popped-out hip. Unlike the snoring woman in his lap, this woman was clearly a few years older, well into their 20s, wearing a sports bra stretched to its limits with her breasts, with a pair of short-shorts also struggling to keep her ass contained. While not as toned as Heidi, she clearly still took good care of herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, errr, no problem.. Babe!&quot; Mark clumsily said not used to his smoother voice, chastising himself for also how fast he said the last part. &quot;Could you grab be a drink? Think I&#39;ll be here awhile&quot; managing to recover and avoid this woman&#39;s rising eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, whatever. You seem like your tired yourself anyway.&quot; came the reply as the woman walked off, as her hips swayed from side to side, doing wonders to highlight her sexuality. Mark wondered if she was doing this on purpose, though a quick glance over her shoulder at you confirmed she was indeed flirting with you.<br />
<br />
Wasting no time Mark quickly pulled out his phone, carefully moved Heidi&#39;s short-cut messy head from his lap and began looking through his contacts trying to work out who this other woman was. Mark didn&#39;t have to spend a long time as right at the top of his recent contacts, was someone called &#39;Jean&#39; with several hearts around. Flicking across his photos, he saw other changes. His family trip to the beach was replaced by him with two athletic woman, one on a leash and the other scantily clad in a two piece bikini kissing him. His awkward graduation photo from middle school was now a photo with him drinking at a sophomore party with the same woman clearly enjoying herself in her cut off jeans and loose t-shirt. Lastly a photo of his mother tutoring him at home, was only slightly changed compared to rest as the young woman was now tutoring him instead, in a pencil skirt hiked a bit too high and a business shirt with the cut a bit too low. &#39;Huh, thats strange.&#39; wondered Mark &#39;Mom made me take that embarrassing photo as she wanted a memento of us working together to pass some exam. Why would that still be so similar?&#39;<br />
<br />
A clattering noise brought Mark out of his stupor, which seemed strangely familiar also. Then like crack of lightning Mark&#39;s brain finally pieced it together. &#39;Wait. The remote must&#39;ve merged Jen and Gwen together, which resulted in Jean a flirtatious young woman and apparently my girlfriend!&#39; Taking time to properly focus on his surroundings, Mark realised he wasn&#39;t in his fine one-story house anymore, but instead a smaller messier flat, with a couple of dog toys as well as a couple of small dumbbells.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess their love for me and averaged out age was fixed by reality to why we&#39;d be together and now we could only afford to live here.&quot; Mark sighed aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah-ruff?&quot; came the groggy noise from Mark&#39;s side; he had woken Heidi up. She agilely spun around onto all fours and began doing laps around the floor. As Mark tried to calm her down, Heidi took the opportunity instead to dive at him, pinning him to the ground. Though her stature was small, the dog-girl resisted Mark&#39;s attempts to get up, enjoying the play time too much. Sensing more opportunities Heidi went in and gave Mark a sloppy lick all the way from the bottom of his chin to his forehead.<br />
<br />
Giving up to his &#39;captor&#39; Mark couldn&#39;t help but enjoy the intimate view of Heidi&#39;s breasts being ground into his chest as Heidi continued rhythmically licking up and down the side of his face and neck. Closing his eyes to enjoy the sensations more, Mark felt the pressure on his chest shifting and the licking stop. Leaning up slightly, Mark saw Heidi turned around with her rear in his face, while she was fixated on the growing bulge in his pants; his newfound hormones had betrayed him, thought Mark.<br />
<br />
Thinking this was his chance to move away before Jean returned, Mark once more tried getting up, only to find himself pinned down now by Heidi&#39;s feet. &#39;Damn how strong is this powerpuff?!&#39; His answer came as he felt a breeze down his legs as the girl had rather clumsily, forced his pants and boxers off, practically tearing the latter. Out flung his proud member, as Heidi leant back sitting directly on his chest, starring intently at her prize. Mark could hear her heavy panting, as her tongue kept falling out of her mouth as Heidi failed to keep the drool from pilling up in it. She was like a predator who had finally caught her prey, savouring the last moments before she feasted.<br />
<br />
In one swift movement Heidi pounced towards Mark&#39;s dick, bearing her face in his pubic hair, before taking the longest sniff Mark had ever heard. Heidi let out a deep satisfied humming sound, her breath tickling Mark&#39;s shaft, drawing her attention back to it.  Rubbing her entire face through his pubes, Heidi moved up towards her goal. The drool leaving a snail trail, helping to lubricate his shaft. Greedily she took the entire dick into her mouth, savouring it completely. Mark was eagerly waiting for as this was beginning to get too much for him, yet Heidi had stopped moving, his dick still wrapped up in her warm wet mouth. Anytime Mark tried moving, Heidi&#39;s sensual humming turned into a low growl, the vibrations in her throat stimulating his dick further. Taking the initiative at last, Mark started moving his hips up and down, up and down. Easing his dick out of this bitches damp cave, eliciting a few whimpers, only to reward her by showing it further back in and after a while Heidi got the message and copied Mark in the same rhythm. In between their passionate rhythm, Heidi found using her tongue received more praise from her owner as well as allowing her to taste the first bits of pre coming out.<br />
<br />
Mark knew he was reaching his limit soon, but was determined he&#39;d remind this pet of his, who her master was. Grabbing her legs, he pulled down the petite girl down, who just continued enjoying her &#39;toy&#39;. Finding himself now staring at her small butt, Mark reached towards it and parted her cheeks revealing at last, her plump wet (surprisingly well groomed) snatch. Not wasting anytime Mark inserted three fingers into her equally greedy cunt, provoking a sudden &#39;yipp&#39; followed by laborious panting from Heidi, who began grinding into his hand feverishly wanting more, while not easing up herself. It was the home straight now, determination mixed with arousal as Mark replaced his massaging fingers with his own tongue, confident he would teach this bitch how to properly use it. Starting around the edge, he teased her engorged clit, until eventually shoving his tongue inside pressing every side. Heidi&#39;s mouth slightly clamped down as she reacted to this newfound pleasure. &quot;Oh you want to play like that?&quot; smirked Mark. In return he leant closer in and lightly nibbled her pussy, being met by some happy muffled groans. Mark leant in as far as he could until he feel her neat sweaty hair tickling him and bit down on her clit, blowing a cool breath of air afterwards did the trick as the two came at last. Shaking Mark pumped his seed right into Heidi&#39;s awaiting mouth as she continually swallowed each load, relishing in her reward.<br />
<br />
Mark was finally freed as he collapsed, catching his breath, while Heidi merely took a couple steps away, went around in circles and finally sat down curled up and feel asleep. Chuckling Mark could see a stream of his cum dribbling out the side of her mouth as she lay there blissfully. They must&#39;ve been making a sound as Mark could hear his neighbours dog start barking away.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell Mark! I said tire her out, but like- why- she&#39;s a dog!&quot; shrieked  Jean, Mark had never heard her come back in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know her breed require extra stimulation, but jeez. I-I need time I&#39;m heading out.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark had to think fast, things were spiralling out of control, he had to stop Jean leaving!</p>
