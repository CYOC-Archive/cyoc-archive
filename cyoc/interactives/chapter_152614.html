<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Becky had on some pink pjs with unicorns all over the suites onesie. She looked adorable since it matched the pink pacifier in her mouth too. Becky looked at Jason across the way from her and loved the matching onesie and pacifier he was wearing as well. They blushed when they both caught themselves looking at one another. <br />
<br />
The caretakers meanwhile picked both of them up to place out in the main area of the daycare, where a tv was set up for the movie they would watch while they were going to sleep. They found out it was Aladdin from the 90s. Jason was ecstatic as he remembered being a toddler when he saw the movie in theaters. They each set the babies on their own sleeping mattress, where a blankie and stuffed animal were waiting for them. The babies in the daycare room were tucked in bed and the movie was started. <br />
<br />
Once the daycare attendants had left the room, Jason looked over at Becky’s mattress and made eye contact with her. She uncovered her blanket and patted the mattress next to her. Jason’s eyes got wider, sucking his pacifier a little more intensely in excitement, he kicked off his own blanket too and dropped his teddy. He crawled over to the mattress where Becky was quietly. <br />
<br />
Mik and Bradly were both laying on mattresses next to each other, Mik pointed out to Bradly what Jason was doing. They both then looked at each other and grinned behind their pacifiers. <br />
<br />
“Looks like Jason made a move tonight” said Bradly after he pulled out his pacifier. <br />
<br />
“Yup. He’s a real stud” said Mik, pulling his own pacifier out as well. <br />
<br />
“Say, do these diapers feel a little bulgy to you?” asked Bradly<br />
<br />
“Yeah they do! They feel like a spaceship around my bum” replied Mik, “I feel like nothing is getting out of these diapers no matter how much we mess them.”<br />
<br />
“Well then looks like we are set to let em rip tonight!” said Bradly. <br />
<br />
Everyone shushed them in the daycare as they were being louder than expected. “Whoops, sorry.” they both said separately. Both of them then picked up their pacifiers and placed them back in their mouths, deciding to watch the movie instead of talking. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jason and Becky were snuggling a little close to each other while on her mattress. Becky liked having Jason next to her, she felt more comfortable in this manner. <br />
<br />
“Have you seen this movie before?” Jason asked, pulling out his pacifier. Becky pulled hers out too in order to reply to him. <br />
<br />
“No I haven’t” she told him. <br />
<br />
Jason looked shocked, “HOW COULD YOU NOT?!” He said a little bit loudly than he thought. He earned some shushes for that. “It’s a classic! I watched it at this age when it was in theaters!” <br />
<br />
“I don’t know” Becky replied, “I just didn’t grow up with a lot of Disney movies.”<br />
<br />
Jason felt bad for her. She missed out on a lot. <br />
“Well I think you will like this one!”<br />
<br />
“I think so too!” she replied. She then picked up her pacifier to put it back in her mouth. Telling Jason that she wanted to watch the movie. Jason picked his up too and put it in his mouth. They both started sucking on their pacifiers as the movie went on. <br />
<br />
Once it reached to the point where they just finished ‘One Jump Ahead’ and Aladdin saw Princess Jasmine for the first time, Jason inched a tad bit closer to Becky. Taking the hint, Becky inched a little bit closer too. As the movie went on, they inched closer and closer until they were right next to each other. They both turned their heads and looked at each other, both admiring the cute paci faces each other had. Their foreheads touched too. <br />
<br />
The movie caught their attention when Aladdin was thrown in the dungeon. Becky got nervous, Jason noticed and held her hand. Letting her know it was going to be alright. Becky loved that and calmed down. <br />
<br />
Becky was really enjoying the movie, she was caught off guard by Jason at his excitement when Aladdin rubbed the lamp and Genie appeared for the first time. “ITH DEENY” he exclaimed along with a few other babies who were excited to re-live their childhood memories. <br />
<br />
“Huh?” Becky asked, prompting Jason to take his pacifier out again. “GENIE! He’s one of the best characters ever!” he said in excitement, “He becomes Aladdin’s best friend!” <br />
<br />
Becky then gave a nod of understanding. She then played around with Jason by picking up his pacifier and putting it back in his mouth forcefully. That caught Jason off guard, but he accepted that she got him. He just started sucking on his pacifier again while Becky was giggling around hers. <br />
<br />
She enjoyed Genie’s intro (“Friend Like Me”) and thought he was funny. When Abu was transformed into an elephant, she replied “Abwoobwoo thurn intho Ewuhfwuhnt.” Prompting Jason to look at her, “Ith Abwoo.” Talking around their pacifiers was now becoming a thing. They didn’t mind though, even if it gave them a lisp later on. <br />
<br />
During “Prince Ali,” Jason started feeling a little prideful. He started thinking he was a handsome prince to Becky and put his arms behind his head. She turned to look at him, only to see him look back at her with a cocky grin behind his pacifier. She rolled her eyes back at him to let him know he was being silly. Jason then said the line along with the song, “a hundwed bad dieth with thwordth.” Becky saw him do that and giggled as she watched his pacifier shield bounce around his face while saying that. He was a goofy little boy that’s for sure. <br />
<br />
Things started getting more intense when “A Whole New World” was being played. Jason cuddled Becky close to him, having her head lay under his neck. She then placed an arm around his waist as the song went on. Becky loved every bit of this scene, she felt that Jason was her prince that was showing her a new world while cuddling him. She then reached up and pulled Jason’s pacifier out of his mouth calmly, which shocked him. Jason in turn pulled hers out too. They then leaned in and shared a small kiss on each other’s lips. It was a little awkward since they were in the bodies of toddlers while trying to kiss, but they loved it nonetheless. They placed the other’s pacifier back in the respective mouths they were in. <br />
<br />
Becky was shocked when Aladdin got captured and gagged. She felt bad for Aladdin, but found it amusing too as he was trying to speak with a gag in his mouth. It sounded like them talking with their pacifiers in their mouths. “Abwoobwoo in twuhbool” she said to Jason. He nodded in return. <br />
<br />
Jason thought Aladdin looked just like them with gag around his mouth. It kind of had the shape of a pacifier and kept him quiet while he was struggling to get the lamp. Once Genie saved them though, Becky calmed down. <br />
<br />
As the movie progressed towards the end, both of them started feeling sleepy. Jason caught himself going to sleep and shook his head. Once Genie was freed and Aladdin and Jasmine rode off on carpet, Becky and Jason looked at each other and smiled. They were about to pass out when Becky said around her pacifier, “doodnigh’ Pwinth Dathon,” which made him smile around his pacifier, “doodnigh’ Pwintheth Bwekee” he replied. They both cuddled up closer. His arm going around her waist while her head was tucked into his chest. They both fell sound asleep as they sucked their pacifiers. <br />
<br />
When Amber came by to turn the tv off, she caught a glimpse of the two babies sleeping and smiled. ‘Looks like Jason May have found his soulmate’ she thought.</p>
