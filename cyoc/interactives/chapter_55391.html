<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Betty didn't believe this, &quot;Hold on, before the roman lupmans didn't know an Inquisitor was <br />
a man's only job among humans, and so when Kathrine bungled and said 'she' when asking <br />
for training they didn't go to the authorities. But suddenly, when Marie herself shows up to <br />
figure what Kathrine is up to, they suddenly know that logically Marie shouldn't be able to <br />
have the job?&quot; <br />
<br />
And Lawrence added, &quot;And THEN the Roman lupman said they assumed the person <br />
Kathrine wanted to help was a man, when she had said 'she' repeatedly when she was <br />
pleading for them to teach her!&quot; <br />
<br />
And the last adult Maddex present said, &quot;And Marie said she did her best to hide her <br />
gender when out and about, but the assassin who she fought and killed before recognized <br />
her as a woman!&quot; <br />
<br />
And Lawrence added, &quot;Did the word 'asylum' even EXIST yet?  This was between when the <br />
mentally ill were seen as either victims of possession, or were visionaries, and expected to <br />
be taken care of by their loved ones,  and seen in 'modern' times as a genuine illness. In <br />
other words, when the insane were nothing more than animals that needed to be tamed via <br />
harsh almost inhuman methods. They were considered no better than animals, and were <br />
treated no better than animals.&quot; <br />
<br />
Glass Marie felt a headache coming on. She felt as if the past as continuing to change as <br />
things balanced themselves out, with people catching up to things at different rates. All in <br />
all, it was just giving Glass Marie one big headache! <br />
<br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
Jesen was in his office, but so concentrated on his long neglected task of keeping an eye <br />
on the pack's holdings, that he never once looked outside the window and never once saw <br />
the dance of chaos that he, the teens, and nearly everyone who wasn't looking after the <br />
injured or listening to Glass Marie's story was now engaged in. <br />
<br />
Zelipe stayed with Amy in her small scale Shinto shrine. <br />
<br />
The dance outside had become a full scale spontaneous production by those who now had <br />
the dance of chaos engraved in their bones and those who were entranced into joining in <br />
as they looked at the hypnotic movements, several times more powerful than the Omega's <br />
dance. <br />
<br />
Even the mourning cubs for the death of their mothers were pulled into the dance, <br />
becoming one with it, become whole with it. It was almost a pity one had a video camera to <br />
record any of it. The practical sea of naked furry brightly colored bodies moved like an <br />
ocean with waves and tides. <br />
<br />
And at the center of it all, Amethyst remained... her heart pounding, her arms and legs on <br />
fire to where she wondered why they didn't burst into flames. Her lungs gasping in and out <br />
for air. <br />
<br />
This went on for hours. To the point where some of the pack and pride wondered where <br />
some of the other were, the ones who wandered off joined the dance.<br />
<br />
Amethyst knew this was beautiful, she knew it was good, she knew the dance that never <br />
repeated itself in precisely the same way was transcendent... finally the six foot tall plus <br />
lupman's legs gave out from under her and she fell to the ground with a thud. Gasping for <br />
breath on her hands and knees before those gave out too. <br />
<br />
The dance stopped like a plug had been pulled, some crash into each other, others stopped <br />
right where they stood like statues, yet others stood around looking about as if they had <br />
just woken up from a dream. <br />
<br />
Garnet was the first one to reach Amethyst with concern for the eldest gem wolf... true to <br />
the curse Garnet was sure was placed on her as revenge towards her absent parents, <br />
Amethyst cost that moment to collapse totally and Garnet was underneath her pillowy <br />
breasts with Amethyst breath blowing on her fur. Garnet sighed, 'Oh whatever... at least it's <br />
comfy...' <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
1685 Fall<br />
<br />
'Three years... three years... dammit... ' Marie considered leaving Kathrine behind and just <br />
go with Vatican and Draco as soon as she could, but she was honor bound to test <br />
Kathrine's abilities at the end of the lupmans' three year training regime.  'At least there's <br />
no way Kathrine can possibly win. I may be half-blind but my gift can see just as well. I'll <br />
know what she'll do before she does.' Part of Marie really wished she didn't need to bring <br />
along any allies, including Vatican.  'Gargoyles don't heal at all... if any body is damaged to <br />
broken, it stays that way... '  They might have been made of stone, but that meant nothing <br />
to these enemies. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya hear? The Inquisition is not doing so hot!&quot; Said Zoey to one of her gossip sisters. What <br />
was with her and standing in the hallway and blabbing these things? The Abbess was going <br />
to punish her eventually for this. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you ask me they have it coming. Whatever happened to... 'ye shall not kill?' &quot; Said a 'nun' <br />
yet to take her final vows until later that month. <br />
<br />
Marie sighed. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
1685 Winter <br />
<br />
Kathrine panted, using the spear as a cane, her muscles burned, and every time she <br />
thought she had reached her limit or maybe was making a little headway, Armando either <br />
pushed her harder or slowly made the training more intense. It was somewhat oppressing <br />
on her sense of accomplishment. But improving she was... slowly but surely she was. She <br />
just needed to... needed to... catch her breath and maybe... lay down for just a little bit...<br />
<br />
&quot;Cat, monkey.&quot; <br />
<br />
It was about as ugly a slur as calling a lupman a wolf. And Armando used them to prod <br />
Kathrine into getting back on her feet whenever Kathrine felt now as a good time for a little <br />
good sleep where she stood. <br />
<br />
Kathrine thought of the cover story used to make sure that her life as a would be nun and <br />
the side kick to a trained killer for the church didn't contradict each other.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I need to ask,&quot; Kathrine said, &quot;Who IS precisely looking after the pups your Omegas had?&quot; <br />
<br />
Armando said, &quot;The Omegas of course, and when of course they're busy turning the <br />
smaller wheel of the pack, we had whoever happened to be on hand do it. ... Worthless <br />
Omegas, breaking tradition, having pups, what a waste.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glass Marie said, &quot;This was sixteen-eighty-five, what did you think they were like? And <br />
remember this wasn't -your- pack, it wasn't even from the same country!<br />
<br />
&quot;Draco was NOT HAPPY to hear he'd have to shift his entire plan to getting them legally <br />
across the sea by three years! And that would leave Marie only about two years before she <br />
knew the lines of fate reached the point of no return and the world the witches wished to <br />
create would inevitable become reality. But, as much as Marie loathed to admit it, she had <br />
given her word. So she used what time she had productively, learning anything she could <br />
about how magic actually work, and how it -didn't- work. And of course... taking care of <br />
business for the Inquisition on under the table affairs.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I could have been... immortal...&quot; The alchemist gasped out, his blood, as much blood as <br />
quicksilver it leaked from his body. His fully grown Homunculus was impaled to the wall <br />
bleeding white seamen. <br />
<br />
&quot;And all that time I thought it was going to be another blood sucker...&quot; Marie thought, <br />
looking at the ruined lab. And the quicksilver poisoned corpses of the alchemist's test <br />
subjects... some willing, some not, all promised immortality of it had worked.  &quot;Idiots... <br />
God is the only path to eternal life.&quot; Marie said simply before gathering some items to <br />
submit to the inquisition and left.<br />
<br />
That christmas, Marie and Kathrine exchanged gifts on New Years. At the same time Marie <br />
was wondering if she should tell Draco she was 'Marius.' <br />

1686 Glendale - Spring <br />
<br />
The three witches had finally physically recovered from the rune fiasco. The magical <br />
shockwave had damaged many of the geasses they had placed on the various citizens. <br />
They would have to repair them one by one. <br />
<br />
It had taken months for them to realize where they had gone wrong. This was done with <br />
the fairies pointing them in the right direction, one fae explaining they were merely <br />
returning the debt they owed the witches. Though the fae weren't quite sure what that <br />
debt was, some had the odd feeling it was towards their very existences. <br />
<br />
The damage to Gogatha was glaringly obvious... half her face was effectively gone, <br />
replaced by a death's head which she covered with her hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think we tried to do too much at once.&quot; Gomorrah said Solome on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Gaal snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just mean, maybe we should try to balance things out, if we can't change everything at <br />
once, and if we can't do much good to save children from becoming adults just one at a <br />
time... then we need to figure out a middle road.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her two sisters had to acknowledge this begrudgingly.  So they began their research and <br />
plans from the ground up, but at a much faster pace than before... <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;How are things looking?&quot; Madam Serenity asked Father Mike. <br />
<br />
&quot;Paul is keeping track of our stockpile so far... not nearly enough to use for the water <br />
supply... then again, we knew this would take more than a day... or a week for that <br />
matter... &quot; <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity nodded. This cure wouldn't magically make itself into the large stockpile <br />
they'd need.</p>
