<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So you are going straight to Tarfeil,” Michael looking at his nephew as they walked out the council. While not being allowed to venture down to hell right away; Enoch was hoping that Michael will provide news that helps give context to what he just said to the council and Jehovah himself. Beelzebub lives.<br />
“Raphael’s healing temple,” Enoch nodding; &quot;is a quiet place, so long as there are no outbursts.”<br />
“Be careful,” Micahael pointing a finger at Enoch; “Raphael will not tolerate…”<br />
“I will not raise a blade or fist in anger,” Enoch interrupting; “provided no one does so to me. But I will defend myself if necessary.”<br />
<br />
Before Michael could respond; a dishevelled angel that Michael recognizes comes storming through. He was unable to warn Enoch and was nearly body checked; fortunately his wolftaur nephew was fast on his paws and managed to jump out of the way at the last second.<br />
“Out of my way,” the irate angel barking; “the son of god arrives.”<br />
“Asshole,” Enoch retorts; flipping the angel the bird. Clearly unimpressed as he smells the cheap bourbon reeking from his pores. The angel just stood there stunned as Michael chuckles; clearly grinning as Enoch turns around, raises his dove like wings and flies off.<br />
<br />
He didn’t hear the remainder of the exchange. Enoch took off his sunglasses; exposing his solid blue eyes as he flew through the sky. Knowing that there are angels looking up to see a taur fly above them and looking surprised; he was the only taur that had wings as he could see.<br />
‘I was the only taur born into my family,’ Enoch thinking to himself; ‘that is until Fenrir was born.’<br />
Enoch came to terms with being unique; he even revelled in it at times. But when his nephew was born, Enoch had to admit he was slightly jealous at no longer be the only taur in the family; no longer a lone wolf. Now he is an angel. A white furred wolftaur with dove like wings that sparkle and shimmer as he flies. Enoch was back to being unique, and he wanted everyone to know.<br />
<br />
Seeing the temple ahead, Enoch sighs as he knows his trip in the skies has to end; if he could he would spend the day soaring through the air; he was finding it to be a majestic and peaceful way to travel. But he still needed work on his landings as he once again stumbles slightly as his front paws touching the ground first.<br />
“Metatron did say I would get better with time,” Enoch folding up his wings; giving the front attendant a sight to behold. “I’m here to visit Tarfeil,” Enoch speaking as he puts his sunglasses back on; “assuming of course Kusheil didn’t Shanghai her in the middle of the night.”<br />
<br />
***************************<br />
<br />
“Is that you Enoch,” the angel looking at the wolftaur before her. The green skinned angel whose wings look like branches of a tree in full bloom sat up in her bed. She already had visitors. The kitsune Angel introduced himself as Inari. There was an angel with blue wings and sapphire like eyes who introduced himself as Polytimos; Enoch knew that this wasn’t his real name, he could tell this angel was once human, but he put that aside for the moment. It was the last angel that took him a back. Also sensing that this angel was once human; she had deep blue skin and her wings looked like waves crashing on the beach. Her hair looked like seaweed collected from the ocean floor and she had the most stunning shark like eyes. She introduced herself as Nami. Enoch removed his shades to show off his solid blue eyes, just to let everyone see his face fully.<br />
<br />
“Yep,” Tarfeil chuckling; “I recognize that sly wink. You might look different, but you are the same devilish Enoch I ran into at the Tokyo Ginza.<br />
“Like the new look,” Enoch smiling as he asks his question; “I got it rescuing you and a bunch of others from the Shir Dessert. You weren’t looking so hot down there.”<br />
“I understand I wasn’t the only angel in need of rescuing,” Tarfeil remembering only bits and pieces of the terror she witnessed; “thank you for the undergarments. I understand you somehow conjured them up?”<br />
“Just thought it was appropriate as we were coming up here,” Enoch folding his glasses up on his shirt collar. “I didn’t think it would be appropriate for you to be nude while in Jehovah’s presence.”<br />
<br />
“Excuse me,” Polytimos chiming in; “but Tarfeil wasn’t the only angel that came with you is that right?” <br />
“Correct,” Enoch taking the measure of this angel. An angel wearing the garb of an inquisitor; “are you looking to interrogate her as well? Because your boss Kusheil still has one in his dungeons still.”<br />
“Screw him,” Polytimos spitting; “the angel I’m looking for has zebra like legs, arms and torso covered in cheetah fur…”<br />
“And the wings of a blue jay,” Enoch finishing the description; “she was rescued as well. And she is the one locked in Kusheil’s dungeon.”<br />
“That’s Azure,” Tarfeil nodding; “we only spoke briefly before being separated.”<br />
“You think you can help us bust her out,” Polytimos speaking with nary a quiver of humor.<br />
<br />
Before Enoch could answer the surprising request from the inquisitor before him, a Cherub frantically flies in looking distressed. “You again,” Enoch recognizing the bird that he saved the other day; “come to spy on me?”<br />
Everyone present watched as the cherub chirped and chipped rapidly; none could understand the thing, except for Enoch.<br />
“I’m well aware that the bubble is back up,” Enoch responding to the cherub; “I sensed it when I woke up this morning. Just steer clear of it for the time being,” Enoch responding.<br />
<br />
“I’ve never seen anyone able to talk to those except for Jehovah,” Inari being the first to speak; “you must have a thing for languages.”<br />
“Born polyglot,” Enoch watching the cherub fly off; “I can speak, read and write in every human language. Even demon and angelic,” the wolftaur eyeing the kitsune angel. “But I have to ask,” Enoch no longer smiling; “why are you consorting with a former Iron Knight by the name of Hank Cromwell?”<br />
<br />
“How the,” Polytimos doubliing over in shock; unable to finish his sentence.<br />
“Becoming a conduit for the cosmic power of creation gives me a unique perspective. I can see your aura was once human” Enoch answering; “plus my father Lucifer briefed me on your escape after Michael and Baal captured you as you were killing demons with blessed blades.”<br />
“I look nothing like I did then,” Polytimos sighing as he tells everyone his past; “being a seventh day advent I’m supposed to refrain from taking a life. But seeing those demons fornicate so openly,” Polytimos shifting to his human from; a man suffering from baldness and sporting a beer belly; “I felt it was my mission from god.”<br />
“God would never order anyone to kill in his name,” Tarfeil shaking her head; “he abhors murder.”<br />
“He despises suicides even more,” Inari looking at Polytimos as he changes back to his angelic form.<br />
<br />
“Reverend Church, Mather and Bashir,” Polytimos speaking; “those are the other three. Who Kusheil inducted into the inquisition with me; after we poisoned Beelzebub,” Polytimos adding.<br />
“You should have stabbed him and removed his head to ensure death,” Enoch responding; “if a demon doesn’t dissolve into ash, there is a chance that he or she could come back.” Enoch sparing them of his revelation that the ritual he and his father busted up was a resurrection ritual and not some act to corrupt an anti-chaos ward.<br />
“bursting into sparks is for angels,” Inari describing how an angel dies.<br />
“We were all supposed to go back down to Earth,” Polytimos speaking. “To help rebuild the iron knights; I suspect that is where my three former friends are. Want to know who ordered us to do that,” Polytimos looking at Enoch.<br />
“Kusheil,” Enoch responding; assuming this is why he wants to break out Azure.<br />
“No, it was Semzaya” Polytimos answering; making Enoch looked surprised for a change; “there is something off about him. But I can’t just place it. Plus I witness Kusheil and Church personally torture you Tarfeil,” Polytimos shaking his head in despair; “I watch horrified as they hacked of your wings before leaving. It sickened me that an angel who is supposed to defend life who be so eager to inflict pain.”<br />
“Kusheil always did have a mean streak,” Inari responding; “its why I have tried to stay clear of him.”<br />
“Is that why you want my help in springing Azure from the clink,” Enoch looking at the morose angel with sapphire eyes; “to repent for what you did?”<br />
“I already did that with prayer.” Polytimos sighing; “I want you help because, the moment I set eyes on Azure, I fell head over heels in love.”</p>
