<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tanya Hammerschmidt dressed in red high heels and a red sleeveless satin gown with a matching shawl, clutching a small matching color red purse waited impatiently for her son, Rick. &quot;Where is he&quot; she said with anger in her voice as she continued to wait? &quot;All because of that dam girl, Ashley&quot; she said her voice changing to disgust, when she noticed something on the floor by the front door. As she got closer she could see light reflecting off the object, what is it she wondered? Finally when she stood over the object she could clearly see what it was a ring. Her expression on her face turned back to anger as she bent down reached out her hand and picked up the ring with her fingers. She slid the ring on her ring finger on her left hand past the red manicured fingernail and let it rest, just above her wedding ring. &quot;That's where Rick was, buying a ring for that slut!!!&quot; she said as she studied the ring with her eyes and began to think about the correct choice of words she would say to Rick when she saw him.<br />
<br />
Continuing to wait, as her anger was about to boil over she thought to herself, I don't know what he sees in that bimbo. She walks around like she is a queen, flaunting her sexuality and looks, making men eat out of the palm of her hand, and my son falls for it.  It’s people like that, that make the world what it is. Where someone could be an Olympic swimmer but just because she doesn't have big breasts or blond hair she's forgotten in a year. Then there are women with no talent, just their blond hair and breasts and everyone adores them. Just once I wish I could be the queen, that I could be the blond with big breasts, that I could be like Ashley Thomas.&quot;<br />
<br />
A funny feeling came over Tanya Hammerschmidt, one that she will never forget as she heard Rick's feet pound down the steps.<br />
      <br />
That's when Kelvin noticed he was back in a house, one that looked familiar and he heard a voice behind him &quot;Mom, I'm ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelvin turned around and saw Rick Hammerschmidt dressed in a tuxedo and the words &quot;Mom&quot; came out of Kelvin’s mouth, in an unfamiliar voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you OK, mom?&quot; Rick looked at him, waiting to hear his mom start about Ashley. <br />
<br />
Instead a million thoughts raced through Kelvin's mind. Last time he remembered he was in Rick's body having sex with Ashley. No wait he thought I was done having sex and then I started to get tired and drifted of to sleep. That still doesn't explain how Rick is standing right there. Then it hit him he remembered he woke up feeling breasts on his body and then he looked up and saw Rick who held something in his hand and then he felt a pinch and that was it. That must have meant he was Ashley, which might mean that Rick's mom could be Ashley now. Although who knows with that ring. <br />
<br />
&quot;Earth to mom? Rick looked at him with concern as he noticed his mom acting weird. An idea popped into Rick’s head one that was a little scary. What if his mom was the one who found the ring? What if she happened to put it on then accidentally made a wish to be someone else with out knowing that it would come true. Then that might mean, this was not his mom standing there, that this was someone in his mom’s body Rick thought to himself as he studied his mom.  <br />
<br />
Kelvin thought about the consequences of Rick finding out who he was and he immediately snapped back to reality. &quot;Yes&quot; he said and smiled trying to fool Rick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I'm ready&quot; Rick stated still looking for any hint that it wasn‘t his mom. What am I doing he thought, as he continued to study his mom, what are the chances of me losing the ring in the house? I could have lost it by the bronze gorilla, in the zoo parking lot, in my car, basically anywhere along the line from the gorilla to the house, and here I am with my mom, thinking that she is really not my mom. I mean what are the chances of her finding the ring, putting it on and making a wish to become someone else. I would have a better chance of winning the lottery then that happening. He laughed to himself about thinking for a second that this was not his mom standing there, however he was soon brought back to reality when he heard his mom.    <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think you could drive?” Kelvin asked with hope in his voice, since he had no clue where he was going. <br />
<br />
“OK” Rick quickly said at the thought of not having to listen to his mom say I told you so all the way home after Ashley is revealed with Kelvin in the bronze gorilla’s arms. “I have to get my keys then” Rick stated as he raced to his room unknowingly giving Kelvin in Tanya‘s body a chance to catch his breath.<br />
<br />
Kelvin couldn’t believe his day from nerd to popular quarterback to Ashley Thomas and now Tanya Hammerschmidt Olympic medalist. This was truly a memorable day he though as he admired his body. He looked at the small breasts hidden by the red satin gown. His eyes followed down his hairless arms all the way down to his long red fingernails. Kelvin then noticed the shine of the light of the diamond ring on the ring finger of his left hand. However something else caught his attention right above the wedding ring was the magic ring that made his day. <br />
<br />
At the same time upstairs, Rick was just coming down the steps with his keys in his hands, he thought about the ring, what if it was in the driver’s seat or just outside the car and his mom noticed it. She would think it was a present for Ashley, and he would have to listen to her all the way their question him about why he would give something like that to her. Which is why he had to make sure he had time to search the car and the area around it to make certain the ring was not there.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the living room Kelvin heard feet pounding down the stairs and they were coming closer. Kelvin thought about what would happen if Rick or whoever this person was found the ring on his hand? He couldn’t let that happen so he slipped the ring off his finger and quickly placed the ring in the purse, as he heard Rick’s voice “can you give me a minute before you come out mom, I want to make sure everything's out of the way.”<br />
<br />
Kelvin smiled “Alright” he said as Rick was already through the living room and out the door. Kelvin waited a few seconds and decided to take a step to the window to look out at Rick, and when he did he lost his balance and the purse slipped from his hand and the shawl fell from his shoulders as he landed on the couch. Catching his breath and trying to figure out what happened, Kelvin looked down and saw he was in a pair of red high heels, with a heel that looked huge. He slowly arose from the couch balancing on the heels and toe of the shoes. He took a slow and steady step, and then he took another slow and steady step, and another, and another around the room. Then he decided to quicken his pace and he took a few more steps around the room, getting better and better with each step, however he was interrupted with a sound coming from outside, a car horn. He grabbed the purse from the floor and the shawl from the couch and draped the shawl around his shoulders as he made his way to the door. He turned off the lights, opened and closed the door and soon made his way down the walkway to Rick’s car as his high heels clicked and clacked on the cement and the dress swished with each step he took. <br />
<br />
When he got to the car Rick was waiting in the driver’s seat and the passenger door was wide open waiting for him to get in? He was about to sit down until he thought about how to get in the car, their was no way he was going to balance on one foot so he would have to go butt first and swing his legs in. Then he thought about the dress if I go in butt first the dress will ride up on me and be all uncomfortable, unless he thought to himself, I hold the dress. So he placed his butt down and made sure the dress was smooth and not all bunched up and then he swung his legs in and closed the door.    <br />
<br />
Rick backed out of the driveway, as Kelvin looked at Rick and couldn’t help but think about how earlier today he was in that body driving this car. That thought however returned his thoughts to the ring, the ring that now rested in the purse he was carrying. So he began to think about what he was going to do with that ring.</p>
