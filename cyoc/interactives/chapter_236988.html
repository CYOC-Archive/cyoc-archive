<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Jeff and Boris are at the park, having fun, a burglar enters the house, since Jeff lives in a quiet neighborhood there aren’t many people around, so no one notices the guy enter the house.<br />
<br />
The burglar, who’s name is Henry, is a white dude with blond hair and brown eyes, he has an athletic figure and currently is wearing black pants, a black jumper and a black mask over his head, he also is wearing black gloves.<br />
<br />
Henry begins searching the home for anything worth taking, he is not after large things like a tv, he is more interested in small stuff like jewelry, coins, cash, stuff like that. Not finding anything on the ground floor, the man heads up to the bedrooms, first he enters the parents bed room, there he finds some cash and jewelry, which he stuffs into his backpack. Next, Henry opens the door to Jeff’s room, peeking inside and noticing that it’s the room of a teen, he knows there isn’t anything to find, yes, there is a laptop, but that is already to large for him.<br />
<br />
Henry is about to close the door when he notices the weird looking game on the laptop, being curious by nature he decides to check it out. The man walks over to the laptop and after learning what the “game” is, a grin spreads across his face, ‘now, this would make my “job” a lot easier,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I’ll copy it over onto my phone’. He pulls out his phone and uses the laptop’s and phone’s Bluetooth to copy the program over to his phone.<br />
<br />
Just as the copying is completed and an independent app appeared on the man’s phone, he freezes when he hears the front door open and close, “JEFF, I’M HOME,” he then hears the voice of what sounds like a 10-year-old boy’s call out.<br />
<br />
‘Damn it,’ Henry thinks to himself, ‘I gotta get out of here! Think! Wait…,’ a grin appears on his face as he looks down at his phone, ‘let’s try something!’<br />
<br />
Henry opens the app and opens the two files which had been also copied over, reading both transformation histories, he quickly learns that Jeff is the older brother of the kid who had just entered. Grinning to himself, Henry scans himself, then he opens his file and edits it so it matches Jeff’s before Jeff had transformed himself into a 12-year-old.<br />
<br />
After confirming the change, Henry feels his body shrink until he is the same height as Jeff, when Henry pulls off his mask his face had changed into that of Jeff’s, ‘it worked,’ he thinks to himself, grinning when he sees his reflection.<br />
<br />
“JEFF? YOU THERE,” he hears the kid call out again.<br />
<br />
Henry, having also added the memories of the original Jeff to his mind, calls out, “YEAH, SORRY KYLE! I AM JUST GETTING CHANGED,” he then quickly strips out of his burglar outfit and stuffs the clothing into his backpack, then he opens Jeff’s wardrobe and pulls out a blue and white striped t-shirt and a blue jeans, he also takes some white sneakers. Satisfied with his outfit, Henry exits the room, just as Kyle comes up the stairs.<br />
<br />
“Jeff, why didn’t you respond sooner,” the 10-year-old asks.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, Kyle,” “Jeff” says, “I didn’t hear you. I was playing a game”.<br />
<br />
Kyle rolls his eyes, “I should have known”.<br />
<br />
“Jeff” grins, rubbing the back of his head, “well… what can I say? I just LOVE video games!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah… no shit,” Kyle says, he then tilts his head, “you look like you are heading somewhere”.<br />
<br />
“Jeff” grins, “is it so obvious,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Well… yeah,” Kyle replies, staring at the backpack flung over his “brother’s” shoulder, “that backpack is not really subtle!”<br />
<br />
“Jeff” chuckles, “yes, I am heading somewhere,” he says, “by the way… I thought you’d be staying at a friend’s home for the weekend. Why are you already back?”<br />
<br />
“I… I had an argument with Dylan,” Kyle says, “so I left”.<br />
<br />
“Jeff” shakes his head, thanks to the memories of the original Jeff, he knows exactly who Kyle is referring to. “You guys argue a lot,” he says, “at times I feel as though you aren’t really friends”.<br />
<br />
Kyle lets out a sigh, “I… I don’t want to talk about it,” he says, “it’s… complicated”.<br />
<br />
“Jeff” nods, “but if you ever need someone to talk to, I am there for you, okay?”<br />
<br />
Kyle smiles at his “brother”, “yeah, I know,” he says, he then rubs the back of his neck, “you know… we don’t really get along as brothers should. We don’t have such a strong bond, but… I honestly wish we had”.<br />
<br />
“Jeff” looks at Kyle, he can see a sort of longing in the 10-year-old’s eyes, ‘oh boy, I really don’t want to deal with this kid any longer,’ he thinks to himself, ‘but I feel sorry for him, he’s a cute kid, he should deserve to be happy’.<br />
<br />
“Anyway,” Kyle then says, “I understand that you don’t like to spend time with me, after all…. I am just some “annoying kid”… so… I get it”. Kyle gives “Jeff” a sad smile, “though… it would be nice hanging out with my big bro. Maybe play some soccer or something”.<br />
<br />
The longer Henry looks at Kyle the more he battles with himself, ‘god, I hate how kids make me feel,’ he thinks to himself, he then smiles, “I’d like to play some soccer with you some time,” he then says, “but now I have other plans”.<br />
<br />
Kyle nods, “I know: girlfriend comes first,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Jeff” chuckles, “you may be surprised,” he says, “but I am not planning to go to Jane’s place for a change”.<br />
<br />
“Oh? Where are you going then,” Kyle asks.<br />
<br />
‘This kid sure is cute, he seems to have an amazing athletic body, he must do a lot of sports, maybe even parkour,’ Henry thinks to himself, “oh, I’m going to explore that abandoned castle”.<br />
<br />
Kyle tilts his head, “you mean the one on the hill overlooking the city, the one surrounded by thick forest?”<br />
<br />
“That is the one,” the “teen” says.<br />
<br />
“You know it’s haunted, right,” Kyle says.<br />
<br />
“Jeff” lets out a laugh, “you don’t really believe those silly stories, do you,” he asks, “haha… adults always tell kids stories like that, only to keep them from doing “silly” things and keeping them from going to dangerous locations”.<br />
<br />
“But… but a werewolf lives there,” Kyle says, “I… I heard a creepy howl coming from there!”<br />
<br />
“Jeff” snorts, “you really have a lively fantasy,” he says, “werewolf… oh, please… that howl was nothing more than a stinking normal wolf”.<br />
<br />
“How can you be so sure,” Kyle asks.<br />
<br />
“Because such beings don’t exist,” Jeff says, a grin then appears on his face, “why don’t you come with me and I’ll prove to you that there is nothing like a werewolf living in that castle,” the “teen’s” grin widens, “or is my little bro a scaredy-cat?”<br />
<br />
Hearing his brother mock him, unaware that it is not Jeff standing in front of him, Kyle feels anger rise in him, “I am NOT a scaredy-cat,” he says, “I’m braver than you!”<br />
<br />
“Jeff” smirks, “well, prove it,” he says, “come with me to the abandoned castle. Besides, didn’t you want to spend time with me? Didn’t you want to improve our relationship? If exploring an abandoned castle isn’t a great way to bond, then what is?”<br />
<br />
Kyle tilts his head as he thinks about what “Jeff” had said, he then smiles, “you know… THAT actually is a great idea,” he then grins, “let’s see who’ll run out screaming like a little girl first!”<br />
<br />
“Jeff” smirks, “game’s on,” he says, “why don’t you go and grab some flashlights, snacks, drinks, while I find my car keys?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll meet you in the garage, bro,” Kyle says, excitement in his voice as he hurries off.<br />
<br />
“Jeff” smirks to himself as he makes his way to the garage, ‘I’ll have so much fun with the kid,’ he thinks to himself, ‘never thought that I’d end up kidnapping such a handsome boy, and best part: he doesn’t even know he is being kidnapped! And with the app, I can avoid being found out, hehe… oh, happy day!’</p>
