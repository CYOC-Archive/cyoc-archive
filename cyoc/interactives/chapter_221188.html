<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aidan had stopped shrinking at the size around a foot tall, maybe a little smaller. Mark seemed gigantic to him, even his knees were a good bit above his head. He was sure that if Mark would lift Aidan´s now flat sock around him, he would easily fit in there. But why would Mark want him be that size? He was too small to suck on him, not that he wanted that, but also still too big to look like a simple action figure toy.<br />
Mark looked down to Aidan in fascination. The program had reduced Aidan to the right size, and now he would just add a few little things before he was ready for his new role. But from the confused look on his face, Mark wanted to laugh. It seemed Aidan had no idea where he would go soon.<br />
He stood up and went over, simply lifting Aidan up with his left hand before returning to the laptop, dropping Aidan onto the table next to it. No sound came from him, and he didn´t move anything beside his face, laying on his side while his legs were still locked mid-step. “Right, I forgot you can neither speak nor move, Aidan. Not that you will need too much of either.” Mark laughed at his shrunken friend. Well, more his plaything now.<br />
Aidan would have screamed when Mark suddenly lifted him out of his socks, which he had pulled together while shrinking. He added little pressure, at least for that Aidan was grateful. Mark could have easily broken his bones between his fingers. Another yelp would have left him when Mark let him drop onto the table, as he couldn´t break his fall, landing on his side like he was still walking. He was rather uncomfortable in that position, and Mark was laughing at his situation.<br />
When Mark calmed down, he carefully grabbed Aidan and tried moving him, but it seemed the frozen state of Aidan´s body would stop him from doing so. At least the face Aidan made suggested pain, as if he would break his legs off that way. Sighing, Mark said: “Okay, I don´t want to hurt you like that, but I also want to keep you frozen in place. Aidan, while you still can´t move your body, I can rearrange your position without problems and without causing you pain. And just to be safe, you can´t be squished or be broken by applying pressure to your body.”<br />
It was as if Mark tried to break his legs off when he first tried to be gently, and Aidan feared what he would do to him if angry. The new change made him sigh in relief. At least Mark didn´t want to kill him. When he tried to move him again, Mark was able to do so without causing Aidan any pain. Soon, he laid on his back, legs slightly apart but everything was straight, raising his comfort greatly. Not that he felt safe, still being helpless and at Mark´s mercy.<br />
Mark grinned down again. Unbeknown to Aidan, he stripped of his right shoe, having only bend down after toppling something from the table to have an excuse, quietly having pulled the ties open. His sock followed, being pulled by his still tied left shoe. Now he was ready for Aidan´s new position. “Okay, time to finish my changes for you, Aidan. Let´s see. I made sure you won´t be squished or broken before. Now, Aidan, I´m sure you would scream soon, so you will stay silent as well. But you will be at least able to wiggle your body a bit again. As you haven´t connected your new size to your new home, let´s just say you will surely hate it, as you will be fixed to the sole of my right foot, trapped within my sock and shoe. Your hands and feet will slightly massage my sole. As for your tiny cock, as it must be tiny now along your size, it will never grow erect again, even if you get horny, because I don´t need a little needle down there. We wouldn´t want it to be harmed, right? You won´t need to eat, drink or breath anymore, or need to release the contents of your body in any way.” Mark laughed at the now pure terror shaking Aidan´s body, his face a mix between disgust and horror.<br />
Aidan couldn´t believe it. Mark wanted him glued to his right foot, massaging his sole as good as he was able to while being stomped on with each step he took? That was pure torture!<br />
But he couldn´t stop Mark from lifting his right leg up, and seeing the bare foot showed Aidan Mark had prepared this. He was lifted again, and with a simple movement of Mark´s hand, was pressed into the sole of his foot, his head right now between Mark´s big toe and its neighbor. And without further comment, Mark took his hand away, but Aidan stayed in place. He made the mistake of breathing through his nose once, even if he didn´t need to breath anymore, and gagged. He would have puked if he could, but it seemed his loss of releasable contents not only meant his piss or shit, but also puking. His whole body still wiggled, his hands kneading the reachable flesh of Mark´s sole, while his feet poked and stroke at his heel.<br />
Mark enjoyed Aidan´s little movements, but he had one last thing to add, which he was sure would torture Aidan even more. And so, with a mean grin, which Aidan could see from his place between Mark´s toes, he stated: “Now, I see the disgust on your face, little Aidan. Guess you took a whiff of my foot out of instinct, right? What luck you don´t need to breath anymore, right?” Mark laughed a little, his grin turning even crueler than before as he continued. “But you see, there is something I must add to your new role, still.” Seeing Aidan´s eyes widening in realization, sending him a pleading look to not do it, Mark laughed again, but hit the final nail to Aidan´s fate in soon. “Oh, having guessed, right? Well, to not keep your eager mind waiting any longer. Aidan, you will every so often take a big whiff of air in. You will also start to clean my toes and the room between them by licking at them all the time. You will “eat” whatever you lick at my toes and drink the sweat they produce. And while you never will like that smell and taste, you will over time be turned on by it, making you horny and desperate for a release that will never happen. But don´t fret, little Aidan, you will never go mad over any of this. It wouldn´t be fair if you can´t “enjoy” the experience to its fullest, right?” Mark than started to cackle like mad.<br />
Aidan couldn´t believe it, pleading Mark to stop this madness. And when he made the last changes, Aidan lost any hope of getting free again. He took in another whiff of air, still as bad as his accidental one before had been, before he licked for the first time. He could clearly feel his inside twist in disgust as he swallowed whatever dirt he had licked up. And like Mark had wanted, he couldn´t stop himself from licking again. Part of him already wished Mark had forgotten to make him not squishable, so he would die the second Mark stood up.<br />
Mark cackled some more, watching Aidan work on his foot. Oh yes, he would need to find a second “volunteer” for his left foot soon. Well, time to get Aidan covered up and move out. “Have fun, little Aidan.” He said before he slipped back into his sock, covering Aidan´s little body. A little twist on Aidan´s profile had made his sock fit normally, as if Aidan wasn´t even there. Everything he pulled onto his foot now would simply ignore Aidan being there, fitting like he hadn´t a living little human glued to his foot. Slipping on his shoe and tying it tight, Mark looked back at the program.<br />
He made sure Aidan wouldn´t age and wouldn´t get tired, so he could endlessly lick at Mark´s toes and massage his sole. As the lone point of having some mercy, Mark reduced Aidan´s pain-level, so while still feeling it, it would be far less than normal. His toy wouldn´t sweat himself, that had been covered under no release of something inside. But a little tweak for himself made Aidan´s body get cooler, which in turn would cool his foot.<br />
Also, Aidan was invisible to anyone but him, and only if he pointed him out to anyone would he be noticed. For all he wanted, he could hold his foot under the nose of someone and that person wouldn´t see little Aidan.<br />
With everything set up, Mark deleted his “Mark rules” comment in Aidan´s profile and let reality adjust, so that nobody would go looking for Aidan Starns. He wasn´t non-existent or dead, just not reachable, and nobody would try to find him. His poor little toy wouldn´t need to know that, though. Then, he packed up the laptop, and with a final look around, left the flat owned by the missing Aidan.<br />
Aidan was now in the darkness of the sock, then felt the tightly bond shoe, before finally being set down for the first time. He wanted to scream, even if his body couldn´t be squished, the pressure now was painful. He guessed it would be worse before, but he still felt as if a whole car stood on his body. A sudden chill went through him, as if he was put into a freezer. His temperature dropped, but the tightness between Mark´s foot and the sock were also warm, countering him feeling cold.<br />
Soon, it was a repeating cycle of being pressed down and being lifted. And all the while, Aidan licked the toe before him and took in a breath every few seconds, making his insides twist in disgust even more.</p>
