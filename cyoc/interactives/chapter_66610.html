<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Unbeknownst to the two, things were changing quickly for the both of them, mainly 
on the mental side of things. To the two of them, life always seemed like it was the way 
they thought it was, even though it had just changed. Nate used to be Ben’s father, now he 
was his older friend since they mentally thought they were only five years apart. Nate 
looked his age, but Ben thinking he was thirty only looked like he was sixteen and thought 
he just aged very slowly. Nothing was strange or out of the ordinary to them as with every 
change made to their bodies, mental changes happened for them to automatically accept 
what changed. Even their trip to the dentist seemed normal, as two friends going to the 
dentist together, having the appointments made so close together. So, we continue to 
watch the two and see what happens to them.</Br>
<Br>As the two new men walked out of the dentist’s office, they felt like completely brand 
new people and they could not remember a time where they had ever felt that good. 
Immediately stepping out of the office and into the open world, everything seemed new 
and invigorating to them. Their sight was improved where everything seemed a lot more 
vivid and defined; the wind picked up and blew past them, ruffling their arm hairs and they 
could smell something wafting in the air, trailing behind the breeze. It smelled wonderful, 
like freshly cooked food and immediately they could feel their stomachs grumble with 
hunger.</Br>
<Br> “Man… Ben, I have no idea what those retainers are made of, but I feel better than I 
ever have and I am so hungry right now, I could really use a steak or two like we talked 
about!”</Br>
<Br> “I know Nate, I have felt the same way since we put those retainers on in the first 
place. Just mentioning food got my mouth watering and I think we need to go get those 
steaks!”</Br>
<Br> “Sounds like a really good plan to me Ben!” Nate exclaimed, putting his meaty and 
now slightly hairier hand and Ben’s shoulder.</Br>
<Br>Ben smiled at the gentle touch, enjoying Nate having his hands on him in such a way. 
Ben felt strange, even invigorated somehow and began feeling something for Nate that he 
hadn’t ever before. For the longest time, as far back as Ben could remember, they were 
really good friends. Even though Nate was a good five years older than him, they had a lot 
in common and Ben looked up to Nate, as if he was a father figure. Ben had always cursed 
his luck, not really liking how he looked either. Nate was thirty-five and Ben just turned 
thirty, even though he looked like he was a sixteen year old. With his looks being on the 
young side, Ben always had trouble getting into the bar with Nate when they went out at 
night. As far back as Ben could remember, he wished that he had Nate’s older and rugged 
look to match his age. Ben was tired of being given a hard time and being looked at like he 
had his identification card forged so he could do things illegally, getting whatever 
establishment he went into in trouble for serving to a minor. Hell… Ben even went as far as 
getting a copy of his birth certificate laminated and carried with him where he went to 
prove that he really was as old as his license stated. However, everything Ben tried had 
always been dismissed and thought of being forgeries and looked at as being nice 
attempts and great lengths to go to get things adults buy all the time.</Br>
<Br>As the two climbed into Nate’s car, Ben looked at Nate in a loving way and Nate 
caught a glimpse of it. Nate smiled, wondering what that look was for.</Br>
<Br> “Hey Ben… what was that look for when you got into the car?” Nate asked quizzing 
Ben.</Br>
<Br>Ben felt slightly embarrassed that Nate saw how he looked at him. “What look are you 
talking about Nate?” Ben asked as he tried to play it off.</Br>
<Br>“Come on Ben, stop trying to bull shit your way out of this! I saw how you looked at 
me… like you loved me or something.” Nate said with a raised voice as he pulled out of the 
parking lot and headed to the nearest steakhouse for lunch.</Br>
<Br> “So… you saw that did you? I don’t know Nate, to be really honest. You and I have 
been friends for a long time and I guess I am just starting to feel things for you that I 
haven’t felt before…” Ben said as he trailed off, not knowing what else to say.</Br>
<Br>Nate smiled and winked at Ben, seeing how shyly Ben was about how he felt about 
him. His teeth were looking even better than what they had when he first put on the 
retainer. Both sets of his K-9s were looking slightly longer, thicker and even sharper than 
they had at first.</Br>
<Br> “Hey buddy, you don’t need to be so shy about things! I have always thought of you 
as more than a friend after all of these years. I have always loved being around you and 
would never want things to ever be different with you. Hell… recently I have been feeling 
the same things… like I love you!” Nate said as they pulled into the restaurant’s lot while 
rubbing Ben’s left thigh gently and tenderly.</Br>
<Br>At the sound of those words, Ben felt warm and fuzzy inside suddenly. “Aww man, I 
love you too!” Ben replied as they walked into the restaurant and were immediately seated.
</Br>
<Br>As the two sat there across from one another, Ben and Nate looked at the menus 
hungrily, feeling like they could devour one of each item on the menu. As each of them 
scanned the menu, Nate realized that he was drooling as a bit of saliva poured from his 
mouth and dripped onto his arm. Composing himself, a little surprised at how much he 
was salivating, he noticed Ben was doing the same thing.</Br>
<Br> “H-hey Ben… you should wipe your mouth.” Nate whispered, which didn’t sound like 
a whisper to either of them.</Br>
<Br>Realizing what Nate was talking about, Ben wiped his mouth right away and gave Nate 
a bit of a dirty look.</Br>
<Br>“What is the big deal Nate? Why did you have to say that loud enough for everyone to 
hear?” Ben said a little annoyed.</Br>
<Br> “Um… I whispered that Ben… I wouldn’t want to embarrass you like that.” Nate said 
trying to diffuse the situation.</Br>
<Br> “It sure as heck didn’t sound like a whisper, but I will take your word for it. You 
haven’t ever lied to me, nor have you ever done anything to embarrass me like that.” Ben 
said as he started to calm down.</Br>
<Br>As the waiter came to take their order, no one noticed that either of their ears shifted 
from being normal and oval shaped to still being oval, but coming to points at the tips. As 
Nate placed his order, he changed his mind several times to how he wanted it cooked, 
feeling a stirring even happen in his crotch, making him feel a bit uncomfortable sitting 
there, wanting to adjust himself, not doing so until after the waiter left. Nate went from 
wanting his steak cooked medium well all the way to rare. If Nate could have it his way, he 
would just have it completely raw, still wriggling and writhing on the plate when it came 
out to him. Hearing this, Ben simply ordered his steak just like Nate did. For some reason, 
to the both of them, the sound of still bleeding meat was extremely exciting. The waiter 
shook his head as he left, being slightly disgusted by how both of them wanted their food, 
but didn’t say anything since it was his job to serve food to his customers like they asked 
for it. His opinion didn’t matter, no matter what, unless of course the customer asked for 
it. Even then he knew he had to hold his tongue and not say exactly what he was thinking. 
When the waiter was finally out of view, Nate reached into his pants and adjusted himself, 
sighing in a bit of relief, no longer being bound by his underwear that was slowly 
increasing in tightness. It was strange to Nate that his underwear kept getting tighter and 
tighter, but he didn’t say anything because it wasn’t that strange… having reached in, he 
felt that he was sporting wood from thinking about his meal like he did, so that was 
explanation enough for him.</Br>
<Br>Feeling constrained like Nate had, but having enough manners to adjust himself in 
the bathroom and out of public eye, Ben excused himself while heading straight to the 
bathroom. Ben was blushing furiously, knowing that he was sporting one hell of a bulge 
and hoped that no one would notice him. As Ben got to where the bathrooms were, he 
noticed that they not only had both a men’s and women’s room, but two family room 
restrooms which were much larger and more private. Thinking it was a bit strange for a 
steakhouse, but thankful for it, Ben didn’t think much more about it and he went into one 
of the family room restrooms, closing and locking the door behind him. Feeling his 
tightness, while also feeling a bit warm, Ben went to pull his pants down to fully adjust 
himself and then get back out to lunch with his friend. As Ben undid his pants, they fell to 
the floor abruptly and he saw that he was sporting some major wood. Smiling, enjoying 
that he was so happy about something so small, he pulled the band away from his waist 
while he looked down at his package. Just like with everything else that was changing, his 
package went from being a meager three inches flaccid to about six with a good thickness 
to it even in his soft state. However, since he was sporting wood, he had eight inches and 
was about as thick as a can of Amp Energy drink, when he used to have the size his cock 
was when it was flaccid. Wanting to play with himself then and there, but knowing that it 
would be better if he waited, hoping that he could have a little fun with Nate later, possibly. 
Ben sighed as he put things away and pulled his pants back up, moaning slightly from his 
unintended sensual touch. Knowing that he needed to cool off a bit, Ben walked over to the 
sink and splashed his face with cool water. Grabbing a few paper towels to dry himself, 
wiping his face clean, he peered closer into the mirror, smiling at his sexy reflection. 
Before, when he walked into the bathroom, he looked how he always had… like the sixteen 
year old he actually was, but now… that was different. Being in the bathroom, his physical 
age and appearance changed drastically. In the short amount of time that he was in the 
room, he went from looking like he was sixteen to being a thirty year old with a very 
rugged appearance. Like Nate was, Ben now had a chiseled jaw covered in a thick and black 
one inch long shadow, his body was bigger and more muscular at the same time. If it 
wasn’t for the retainers, Ben would have normally thought this was all quite strange and 
impossible, but it was all normal to him… as if things had always been that way.</Br>
<Br>Wanting to get back to Nate, Ben finished wiping himself dry and headed back to the 
table. When he got there, he saw that the food was already ready and Nate had dug in. Ben 
could see that as Nate at the slightly browned and very bloody meat, he did so reservedly. 
Inwardly, he knew that Nate wanted to pick the thing up with his bare hands and tear into 
the meat savagely, like the animals they truly were deep down, but didn’t just because they 
were in public and he didn’t want to make a scene. Ben knew this for a fact since that was 
exactly the way that he felt.</Br>
<Br>When the waiter came back to see how things were, he was a bit shocked that another 
man, different from the boy that was there when the order was placed, was sitting there 
enjoying the meal with Nate and Nate saying nothing was ok with it. Again, he kept his 
mouth shut since he has seen stranger things in his restaurant and it was not his place to 
question things.</Br>
<Br>“How are things gentlemen?” The waiter asked simply and plainly, not really wanting 
to engage in too much conversation with his strange guests.</Br>
<Br> “Things are very delicious, aren’t they Ben?” Nate said with his mouth still relatively 
filled with food, with Ben replying with a silent nod since he had food in his mouth as well, 
enjoying how everything tasted.</Br>
<Br>To both of them, they had never tasted anything that good in their lives, but they just 
thought that the food was just that good. What neither of them realized was that their taste 
buds were enhanced just like the rest of their senses that they experienced some time ago. 
What they also didn’t realize that as they sat there eating, the added protein has started 
helping the transformative powers of the retainers, which slowly would be increasing their 
muscles. Feeling like the two of them needed to get home, to get out of their clothes and 
become much more comfortable, Nate asked for the check. The waiter simply shrugged 
and did as was requested. After the check came and the bill was paid, the couple left and 
got into the car… already feeling tighter in their clothes, but never questioning why.</Br>
<Br>The ride to their home was quiet and seemed to take forever. Once they were inside, 
Nate and Ben immediately disrobed and stood comfortably in their underwear. Just like 
everything else, unbeknownst to them, they used to have two other people living there, but 
now it was their place that they shared. They each had their own respective bedrooms that 
were fully furnished that they had lived in for some years, sharing the cost of the place 
equally since neither of them had any where else to live. As they stood there, they both 
silently admired the others’ physique. Both of the men stood there in their underwear as a 
godly specimen of the bearish kind. Both men, who had not been gay until they put those 
retainers on, enjoyed the male body… especially the men that were considered to be bears. 
To them, muscles and body hair was quite sexy and they were both a marvelous pair of 
muscle bears themselves. Both men had huge mounds of muscle on their arms and pecs 
with a hard spare tire on their guts. With each noticing how the other looked, they both 
smiled their new fanged smiles and showed off for each other, flexing their huge muscles. 
Nate, being older, looked like he had more experience being in the gym having a barrel of 
beer for each pec and basketballs for upper arms with equally massive and tapered 
forearms. Nate had a thick, but trimmed forest of medium brown hair on his chest, while 
his head of hair as well as on his arms, legs, and face was dark brown… matching the color 
of his retainer. Ben, on the other hand, had two thick and round cuts slabs of beef for pecs 
and his arms were slightly bigger than a rugby ball each. Ben was also sporting a thick pelt 
of his sexy black chest hair that went all the way down over his slight, but muscular 
paunch for a gut, snaking its way down into his shorts.</Br>
<Br>As the two of them stood there, both could see that they were getting hard looking at 
the other. Knowing that Ben was the shy one, but would immediately go along with 
whatever Nate did, Nate decided that he was going to make the first move. Nate walked up 
to Ben and rubbed his muscular chest, making sure to brush over Ben’s left nipple, 
knowing instinctively that it was one of his hot buttons. Ben moaned, feeling a rush come 
over his body, while things became more wolfish while neither of them noticed the changes 
continuing.</Br>
<Br> “So… is this because you are happy to see me or what?” Nate asked coyly while 
cupping Ben’s package.</Br>
<Br> “Well… you must know… you are sporting some nice wood yourself!” Ben replied 
while moaning from the intense feelings he was having.</Br>
<Br> “Yeah, well I know he is definitely happy to see you. Do you want him to come out 
and make an appearance?” Nate said seductively as his body slowly changed, being slightly 
further along than Ben.</Br>
<Br>Nate’s face already sported a full beard while his teeth lengthened and changed to be 
more like fangs; his body hair grew out more and thickened to look like a human pelt, not 
being quite fur; his hands grew thicker, puffier and meatier while his fingernails 
lengthened to claws; the palms of his hands grew thick, but soft pads; his feet underwent 
the same changes, while his body was still waiting to shift completely.</Br>
<Br>Ben licked his lips hungrily, wanting to do more than just touch his friend’s meaty 
member. Ben couldn’t believe that he was even thinking this way in the first place, but 
there was something in him that desired to come out and play. As Ben grasped Nate’s 
package through his underwear his eyes widened feeling how massive it was. Ben felt the 
raging hard member pulse in his hand with every beat of Nate’s powerful heart, seeming 
like it was increasing in size from an already impressive length of eight inches and as thick 
as a forty ounce bottle of beer. Ben wondered if it got any bigger how he would even be 
able to fit it in either his mouth or his ass. Being that he was a shy guy, Ben was surprised 
that he was having these vivid images play in his mind while holding on to Nate’s cock, but 
Ben really wanted to go to town on him.</Br>
<Br>Seeing how Ben was enjoying his cock, not to mention how he was looking at it, Nate 
decided to see just how far he could push Ben.</Br>
<Br> “So Ben… what should we do with my <em>little</em> problem?” Nate said with a 
fanged smile, just on the edge of transforming and could see Ben was just starting to 
appear more like the beast that raged within him.</Br></p>
