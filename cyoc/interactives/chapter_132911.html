<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were thinking more to the point and it seemed an easy choice to just pick a horse, and so you did.<br />
<br />
The next screen presents you with an odd question.  &#39;Hard&#39; or &#39;Easy&#39; were the options and nothing more as to what in the hell either meant. After waiting a moment to see if that&#39;s all there was, you chalk it up to laziness and choose &#39;Hard&#39;. Right after, you get to choose the name of your horse from  several options.<br />
<br />
Strangely, all the names were of male horses rather than what you thought this whole part of the tour was about. Still, tapping your foot as you only got four choices, &#39;Shadow&#39;, the black stallion seemed as good a choice as any.<br />
<br />
&#39;Thank you.  Enjoy the &#39;Hard&#39; Way&#39; was spelled out in the screen in a way that was just impersonal enough to be cold.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s nearly a minute before you hear some clattering at the far end of the corridor where you could see some sort of movement in the shadows and what looked to be a door opening.  Soon after there was a terrific thunder and rattle of the metal floor.  It took you calming down from the shock and the beast finally settling before you realized that it was a horse that was the cause of all the noise.  Upon closer inspection, the black draft stallion looked a fair doppelganger for the &#39;Shadow&#39; you had picked.<br />
<br />
Around his neck is a metal chain with a gold clasp reading &#39;Shadow&#39; in black font.<br />
<br />
You walked up to the horse, petting the now somewhat docile creature with a healthy bit of curiosity.  If this was the horse you had chosen, where was the &#39;hard&#39; way?<br />
<br />
There is a sudden gust of air then silence. Looking around, the only oddity you noticed was the odd feathered dart sticking out of Shadow&#39;s left thigh.  It was quickly shaken off when the animal whinnied loudly and swung his head to thump you in the chest.  The sudden change of the animal&#39;s temper had you on your back foot. He came around, his eyes looking right you, then rammed his head into your shoulder, spinning you around and to the ground.<br />
<br />
You hand on your hands and knees, scraping either in the fall.  You go to stand but you&#39;re met with force.  Looking up, you see up Shadow&#39;s muscled chest and to his snout, somewhat drooling. Then you noticed his forelegs coming to either side of you and it was only a quick bit of math that had you turn you head.  It felt like the bottom of your stomach had just dropped out.<br />
<br />
Thicker than a wine bottle, mottled, and gradually gaining more length, it was more so the basketball sized testicles hanging from his hindquarters. With a show of strength, and dominance, he bent down somewhat, giving you little room to move, then pressed the wet head of his cock to your ass.  The wet part you only realize when it starts to soak through your jeans and underwear, causing you to shiver in horror and nearly gag, and while you try to pull away, Shadow is simply too big and too strong.<br />
<br />
Three more thrusts and it&#39;s clear the stallion means to make you his mount, even if you&#39;re hardly his type.<br />
<br />
From a slot in the ceiling you failed to notice, a leather bridle dropped and landed just in front of your head.  There was a string with a not tied to it that simply read, &#39;Put this on to survive the hard way.&#39;<br />
<br />
Another driven thrust at your ass and you realize that you certainly couldn&#39;t survive a horse fucking you.  If wearing this bridle was what you had to do to amuse whoever&#39;s sick joke this was what you had to do deserve not dying from horse rape, then it&#39;s a small price to pay.<br />
<br />
You quickly handle the thing, having some trouble fitting browband and noseband to a face lacking the proper features. Tightening the strap around your neck, the bit came up into your mouth and you couldn&#39;t help but bite down. No sooner is this done than the leather straps of the bridle tighten around your face and head.  Eyes wide, your gaze is driven down with another thrust from Shadow, you and now feel your fingers cramping like never before.  You try and cry out but the bit chokes your voice.<br />
<br />
You watch your four fingers on either hand, despite your best efforts, start to merge into one finger which itself was soon starting to harden into a black mass of sorts.  Your thumbs were also getting changed, shortened, and began to pull up your forearm.  Here to, muscles and bones seemed to be changing in front of you.  When another thrust from Shadow nearly forces you into the floor, you put out your deformed hands to catch yourself.<br />
<br />
Tears streaming down your cheeks, you look left and right, and notice the similarity- except in size and fur growth- between your arms and Shadow&#39;s hooves and legs.<br />
<br />
Another thrust, and you blush as your cock goes hard and immediately began a dull and distant orgasm that was to be your last as a man.  Your balls squeezed in, flushing you out and of any seed and leaving the front of your jeans much like the back. Then, with a worrying tingle, while your cock remained hard as ever you could also feel the tent in your pants dwindling.  At the same time, a tickle and a slight soaking of horse pre-sum, signaled the opening of a slit that soon grew to absorb some of your testicles into the growing vulva.  You, of course, only feel tugging and wetness. <br />
<br />
The next few pokes from Shadow hit on worrying stretched pants and the dull ache of your hips and pelvis was growing into a change to quadruped and birthing foal and filly alike.  To you, again, you are feeling your back legs forced to odd positions while your toes feel like they&#39;re not even there anymore.<br />
<br />
Another thrust and you hear your pants rip, causing you to turn your head yet again. Your jaw dropped when you realized the rip you heard was really your pants practically disintegrating when your ass suddenly swelled with mass.  This time, when you pushed, the stallion gave way.  He seemed to have expected it, you think.  Another spurt of growth has you moaning in pain and your arms and legs both start to length while looking less and less human.  Your thumbs are more fetlock and after another spurt and subsequent pressure by Shadow, you realized you were also growing a tail.<br />
<br />
&#39;Put this on to survive the &#39;hard&#39; way&#39; it said.<br />
<br />
Another thrust but this time, after ripping through the last remnants of your underwear, Shadow pushed the first seven inches of his cock into you and you could only feel him widening your very body as your hips, ass, legs, chest, and even your new udder and teats, and causing a flood of feelings you couldn&#39;t explain. <br />
<br />
Another thrust, and it&#39;s a foot of horse cock buried into your no longer virgin horse cunt. You were dizzy and processing these facts only made you struggle to stay on all of your new four hooves, as your shoes finally burst open to show they were on the same course as your hands.<br />
<br />
Another massive thrust and sixteen inches in you seemed to force the change into your face with a fury.  Your are wide again, forced to watch your nose fatten while your jaw and face were literally being pulled forward, as if to some singularity.  Except your face was getting pulled not to a point, but to a snout. Every thrust buried a bit more horse cock in you and drove a bit more mare out of your face.  You had to watch your hair bald from your head and feel the hairs over your body sprout to cover your skin.<br />
<br />
Your eyes grew larger as did your lashes and neck extend with a series of echoing cracks. No sooner did you have a black mane like your mate- which is the first word that comes to mind, strangely- than Shadow bit down and pushed all thirty inches of horse cock into you, only to explode in you.  A quivering feeling, your first orgasm as a male, was overshadowed by the black mare that stared back at you off the reflection on the screen.<br />
<br />
Shadow dismounted, an all black mare standing atop tattered clothes with excess horse seed dripping from her swollen sex.<br />
<br />
You were dizzy, and had to use was concentration you could muster to stand.  The door near you opened and the bearded man who let you in walked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, the easy way is a slow, painless transition.  Hard way,&quot; he chuckled, looking at your rear end.  &quot;Shadow definitely hit the bullseye on you so that makes you the winner of an all expense paid trip to a farm to spend the rest of your days.&quot; He smiled and gave your ass a slap.  Startled, your tail lifted and out tumbled a mass of horse turds, causing the man to cover his nose.<br />
<br />
Coming over to look you in the eye, he glares at you.  You recognize him, though you&#39;re not sure from where exactly.  And you feel weird and oh, a few more turds plop out behind you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think there is a little of you still in there,&quot; he said, walking to the screen and punching in an override.  &quot;So how about I bring in the other stallions and each gets a chance on you.  By the end, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll accept this life.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you heard a distant door open and another stallion enter, you firm your rear legs and push your ass out instinctively.  In truth, you wanted the stallion now.  When he mounts you, and his horse cock finally connects, you realize you won&#39;t mind the next seven stallions to come either.</p>
