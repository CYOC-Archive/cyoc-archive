<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>My headcannon for why Jen&#39;s ass was subject to the curse is that it conforms to the spirit of what Kyle said, if not the exact wording. As Kyle thought that Jen was the kind of girl to pass herself around metaphorically, and Jen enjoys anal play, her ass also becomes something that can literally get passed around.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jen settled into her seat near the middle of the bus (between the nerds in the front and the delinquents in the back), the starting quarterback/her boyfriend Brad flanks her to her side, and two of the girls in her clique, Tyra and Ayame, sit in front and behind. <i>Curse or no curse, I still run this school.</i> Jennifer thought grinning. As Tyra talked to her about how she had seen a girl from Washburn High School on campus talking to Nick, one of the drama nerds, Jennifer became aware of movement around her asshole again. It felt like it had slid a short distance over something. Not exactly an uncommon event, as thongs tended to be cause sensations back there often, but she hadn&#39;t shifted body beforehand which was odd. She quickly dismissed it as she started making fun of the potential pairing, &quot;Drama geeks, they probably fuck to a script lol. But what if he can&#39;t play her parts, and she doesn&#39;t respond to his line?&quot; Jen said as her friends laughed on cue to her petty dig despite Jen&#39;s rather lacking sense of wit. <i>Speaking of parts...</i> Jen took on a thoughtful expression and turned to Brad, saying that she had something to tell him later on today. &quot;Sure babe, whatever you say.&quot; Brad replied. A pretty common reply as Jen typically did most of the thinking for the two. Brad wasn&#39;t the sharpest tool in the shack, but she&#39;d be damned if he wasn&#39;t good arm candy. She knew that, phrased that way, Brad <i>might</i> get a little worried she was going to bring up drama of a very different kind, but Jen thought it might be good for him to stew in that anxiety for a little while so as to remind him to appreciate her.<br />
<br />
<i>But actually, why wait?</i> Jen thought spontaneously, as she now felt some impatience to share her changes get the better of her. Jen didn&#39;t realize the second part of the curse was talking hold and influencing her to share the information that her parts were now detached, the curse&#39;s magic also ensuring that the revelation didn&#39;t spark any questioning as to how that was possible, or any reaction beyond what one would expect from being shown a valuable trinket. This was because the curse also aimed to eventually <i>make</i> Jen&#39;s parts a few lucky individual&#39;s valuable trinkets. &quot;Check this out!&quot; Jen said as she pulled out her wallet and opened the flap concealing her tits and pussy. &quot;Whoaaa, is that a new plastic surgery or something Jen?&quot; Tyra asked in astonishment, the curse redirecting her mind to explain the situation in mundane terms. &quot;It&#39;s pretty exclusive, I can tell you that.&quot; Jen replied with a haughty expression. The rest of the bus had grown deathly silent as all eyes centered on the vagina that Jen was holding up to her friends. Some stared in surprise as they considered the practical implications of Jennifer&#39;s condition, others in envy as they also believed it to be some exclusive plastic surgery that family wealth & connections granted Jen. Still others looked at it with coveting, hungry eyes as they considered darker applications. &quot;I&#39;ll let you keep it for a little while later Brad, that way we won&#39;t have to find a spot or wait for our parents to leave the house again... If you&#39;re good, of course.&quot; Jen said flirtatiously, lifting her eyebrows and biting her lip suggestively. &quot;Jen, you&#39;re the fucking best!&quot; Brad said with a grin. &quot;Damn straight...we deserve the best, loverboy.&quot; Jen replied.<br />
<br />
The bus pulled up in front of the school and opened it&#39;s , Brad suddenly became animated; &quot;Holy shit I forgot, Rodrigo&#39;s gonna show me how to smash a can with with his bicep today! Keeps rolling off when I do it. Come on babe!&quot; Brad grabbed Jen&#39;s hand and got dragged along as Brad smashed his way through anyone not smart enough to have stayed in their seat until they had left. Jen mentally checked that both her handbag, and more importantly the wallet with her pussy and nipples inside were safely in her possession. She breathed a sigh of relief as she continued moving ahead, but immediately after scrunched her brow in consternation. <i>Why do I still feel like I&#39;m sitting?</i> Jennifer still felt the unmistakable rubber feel of a bus seat under her. <i>No, my cheeks feel normal, it&#39;s just my...oh SHIT!</i> On the recently-vacated seat, someone looking closely would be able to see a sphincter lying near the crack between the seat and back cushion, tightly scrunching as a normally-invisible reflex action became a visible sign of Jen&#39;s panic. &quot;Wait, BRAD WAIT!&quot; Jen pulled and tugged at his hand to no avail as she was one of the first people to make it out of the bus, propelled by the wall of muscle leading the way. She immediately turned to go back in, but even her status as queen bee made no difference to the throng of students pouring out of the bus. She would just have to wait it out until the flow of people trickled down. <br />
<br />
<i>I&#39;m okay, I&#39;m okay, calm down Jen. It&#39;ll be fine, I can still feel it on the seat...</i><br />
<br />
Most of the nerds had gotten out, though some chose to wait out the rush.<br />
<br />
<i>Heh, I mean, who&#39;s going to find it anyway? It&#39;s so tiny, and almost camouflaged against the seat.</i> Jen consoled herself. She struggled to maintain her imperious body language through her apprehension as she waited through the longest seconds of her life. She wasn&#39;t wrong; her brown starfish matching the color of her nipples (both of which got their shade through some distant French ancestry if Jennifer recalled correctly), as well as the color of the bus seats, though to a much less exact degree.<br />
<br />
Almost all of the other popular kids had exited the bus, leaving a few nerd stragglers but mainly the motley bunch of troublemakers, class clowns, and punks that sat at the back of the bus. Just as the flow of people trickled down to the extent that she was about to push through herself, Jen felt sensations that made her stomach drop as if through a trap door.<br />
<br />
The sensation of rubber suddenly disappeared as she felt her anal star became enclosed by fleshy walls, followed by the sensation of cloth surrounding her anus. Jen&#39;s eyes grew wide in shock, but as she rushed onto the bus everyone mistook it for anger, assuming she was just feeling more bitchy than usual. <i>Oh fuck ME.... No wait, don&#39;t fuck me! Just give me back my asshole!</i> Jen mentally monologued as she ran to where she had been sitting. As she expected, her rosebud was not on it. Jennifer had once considered leaving anal as something to explore with her future husband, but now her most sacred of rings was sitting in the pocket (backpack? purse?) of someone on this very bus. Jennifer&#39;s shock gave way to actual anger at the thought, though not without an undercurrent of desperation.<br />
<br />
Turning to the nearest nerd, Jennifer demanded him to tell her if he saw anything on her seat, or if he saw anyone pick up anything from it. &quot;N-n-n-no Jen, did you drop something? I dropped something too, I was picking it up just now...&quot; the nerd held up some dweeb game to validate his story.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, let me help you.&quot; Jen snatched the game from his hand and tossed it out the window. &quot;You can get off the bus now.&quot; Jen told the nerd icily. &quot;But the rest of you aren&#39;t leaving until what was on that seat is returned to me!&quot;, which elicited some groans from the the 11 or so still on the bus. &quot;You and what army, bitch...?&quot; said a punk in a leather jacket and skirt, glaring at Jen.<br />
<br />
Just then, the bus driver cut in &quot;School&#39;s about to start, and my ass gets fired if I&#39;m seen condoning students skipping class, so you need to get offa the bus young lady.&quot; The driver put his hand on Jen&#39;s shoulder as a way of signalling how final that decision was. <i>And if we leave this bus, my ass gets...</i> Jen didn&#39;t want to finish that thought as she whipped around and, with her most adorable face, started her best possible cute-girl routine. &quot;I dropped my house keys, could we pleeeease spare a minute to find it?&quot; Jen said sweetly, in a scary contrast to her demeanor just a minute ago. &quot;Sorry, but rules is rules-&quot; The driver began to pull Jen back up to the exit as the crowd cheered. &quot;-and the rules say that you need to be in that building in 30 seconds abouts.&quot; &quot;Wait, it&#39;s just a second! Just give me a second to talk to everyone!&quot; Jen pleaded as the driver grasped her other shoulder and gently-but-firmly pushed her off the bus. &quot;If I find anything, or if someone picked it up, you can check the lost & found later to pick up your door keys. But I&#39;ll tell you what, if I was you I&#39;d tell my folks to replace the lock and make new keys, there was a story in the news where-&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jen had already stopped paying attention as the driver continued, looking hysterically from one person to the next as the crowd dispersed onto the field to go to their different 1st period classes. She was quickly running out of options and decided to just choose whoever looked like they might have done it. Choosing another punk, Alex, who had a history of stealing people pens and books, Jen subtly followed him into a building from a non-obvious distance looking for any sign that he might have her rear.  She got an unmistakable sign in the negative when, as Alex used both hands to enter the combination to his locker, Jen felt a finger start rubbing circles teasingly around her asshole.  Gasping out loud, Jennifer drew some strange looks, as well as a few knowing smirks from people who had witnessed her showing off her pussy to Brad and misconstrued what was happening. <i>Fucking Rodrigo...</i> thought Jen as she realized her anus was now completely out of her hands.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, as they walked to class, someone with their hands concealed stopped drawing circles with their thumb and rested it on the quivering sphincter they now held. <i>A bitch, skank, </i>and<i> liar Jen? It&#39;s not </i>keys<i> you were looking for.</i> As they took their seat, they took a moment to relish the fact that they now possessed the most private part of the most popular girl in school. The one on the arm of one of the school&#39;s most threatening specimens. The one that wouldn&#39;t give 90% of the student body the time of day, and even less than that a date. The one that drove students to attend Glendale&#39;s football games as a pastime just in the hope they could sneak a peak at her luscious derriere during her cheer routines. And now, they alone had the ability to do whatever they wanted to what she used to hide between the cheeks of that derriere, whenever they wanted. The student raised their other hand as attendance continued, feeling like some karmic force had intervened in Glendale. <i>Well, there was a grain of truth to it actually, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any lock you can replace to keep me from breaking into your back door. First thing&#39;s first, you need some training in how to receive guests...</i> The student pressed their thumb against Jennifer&#39;s rear hole more firmly, and Jen responded to the sensation elsewhere on campus by clenching tighter. Time would tell if only one or two students would be cumming into her back door, or if it would be host to entire house parties as Jennifer&#39;s rectum became the new pastime of much of Glendale&#39;s student body.</p>
