<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unaware that white fur had started to sprout on his tail, Tobias remained where he was lying as his mind tried to sort out what had happened. He didn&#39;t understand how it was possible for someone to grow a tail, nor was he quite ready to believe it had happened to him, even though he could feel the thing tucked between his legs. Reaching out and running a hand through the dog&#39;s fur coat he stared out into the darkness and let his mind wander as he tried to sort out the problem.<br />
<br />
A grumbling noise from his stomach distracting him from his thoughts, Tobias huffed as he wished suddenly he had something to eat. Unable to remember the last time he&#39;d had any food, sure that it probably been breakfast, but at the same time certain it likely had been dinner the previous night, he looked over to where he thought the dog was and idly whispered, &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you can help me get something to eat?&quot;<br />
<br />
To his surprise, the animal stood, made a low whining noise and gently pressed his head into Tobias&#39; upper arm. Staring at the spot he was sure the dog was, Tobias asked, &quot;What is it?&quot; and was immediately caught up guard when the canine nipped at his shirt sleeve and began tugging at it.<br />
<br />
It gradually coming to him what the dog , he balked. Hesitant about running around a forest at night, especially when he couldn&#39;t see, Tobias told the animal, &quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; but the dog  wouldn&#39;t leave off and in the end, Tobias stood and laid his hand on the animal&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
As he did this, he said, &quot;You&#39;ll have to lead me,&quot; to which the dog uttered an excited noise and quickly started walking.<br />
<br />
Tobias, stumbling a bit as he tried to keep up, breathed deeply and began waving his other hand in front of him, searching for trees he was terrified of running into. Wondering where he was being led, he stopped after a bit. Sniffing the air, he thought he smelled something that seemed to be at the same time revolting, yet smelled delicious. His nostrils flaring, Tobias patted the air until he found the dog. Whispering, &quot;Go on,&quot; and starting to feel excited about the odour, he allowed himself to be taken in the direction.<br />
<br />
After some ways, in which the smell became stronger, less disgusting and more tantalising, Tobias soon realised that he was drooling as he also came to understand that the scent that was that of a live animal. Suddenly stopping, he looked wildly about, trying to figure out why he was hunting and what exactly he planned to do once he located whatever he was tracking. A low whine distracting his thoughts, he smirked as he understood perfectly what he planned to do. Taking a step, unaware that he&#39;d at some point let go of the dog and was following instincts, he stopped when a tightness in his pants inhibited his movements.<br />
<br />
The excitement of the hunt still strong, he reached down and adjusted his dick, which was once again rock hard. When that didn&#39;t help, he unbuttoned his pants and after a bit, he pushed them down far enough to allow his tail to stick out. The night feeling great on the appendage, which started to wag back and forth, he pulled his pants back up. Making sure they didn&#39;t pinch his tail, he didn&#39;t bother zipping or buttoning them as he absently played with himself. Wondering why he&#39;d tucked the thing back, he was distracted after bit by another whimper from the dog, followed by a sharp barking noise. Smelling an animal nearby that wasn&#39;t the dog, he lost interest in his train of thought.<br />
<br />
The hunt calling him, feeling more excited, more aroused, Tobias crept forward, trying to be stealthy as possibly. Something moving in front of him and he understood that whatever it was, it was making a run for it. Leaping forward, his hand outstretched, fingers curled, he articulated a bestial noise as he grasped a small, wriggling creature. Realising it was a rabbit, he almost let it go. But then his hunger reared up and tightening his grip, he soon strangled the animal, dropped it to the ground and shifting about, he began tearing at the fur and flesh with his teeth. Blood squirting into his mouth, he was at first repulsed, then, upon tasting the fresh, hot meat, the abhorrence passed. Holding himself up with one hand, teeth tearing clumsily at the fresh kill, aware that the dog was somewhere near, he didn&#39;t give it a second thought as he used his free hand to push his pants down to his knees before going to work on his throbbing and needing hard-on.<br />
<br />
Lost in the thrill of having hunted, killed and was now sating his hunger, Tobias completely missed it as his teeth began to morph into sharper canine teeth, helping him rip apart the rabbit, and his ears lost their roundness and took on a more distinct point. Blowing his wad at about the same time he finished eating his fill, Tobias suddenly found his sensing returning. His penis starting to grow flaccid, he stared into the darkness, smelling the remains of his kill. Terrified as he realised what he&#39;d just done, unaware that he&#39;d changed, he pushed away and stumbling into a sitting position, which caused his tail to began pinch, he whimpered, &quot;What is happening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to answer the question, he scrabbled away from the carcass until he found his back pressed up against a tree. Starting to shiver, he felt certain that he was going insane. Something warm and furry suddenly pressed into him and he nearly screamed. But then realised it was the dog, who had crept silently closer before laying down. Sliding down until he was almost laying down, he adjusted himself so that his tail wasn&#39;t pinched and that he was pressed comfortably against the animal. Reaching out and running a hand through the dog&#39;s fur coat, Tobias considered about pulling and closing his pants, but instead shut his eyes. Feeling himself starting to drift, he wondered if his brother had experienced anything along the lines of what he had. Still stroking the dog, pants and underwear still down around his knees, Tobias shifted until he was cuddled close to the animal. Eventually he dozed, chased into fitful dreams that verged on horrific outcomes of people discovering he had a tail and chased by the numerous questions he had, but was unable to answer.</p>
