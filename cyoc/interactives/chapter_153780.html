<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike felt the heat well up on him, more and more even as he tried to cool off by shedding his clothes - his pants soon enough joined his shirt thrown off to the side, and the jock almost felt himself quivering with hot energy. He looked himself over, seeing his clammy skin shivering and he almost looked to be developing a slight coating of hair spreading up from his groin in a trail. Even as it spread his already athletic frame began to visibly muscle up, pulsing and shaking and growing---<br />
<br />
The young man let out a gasp of sheer pleasure and his hand shot into his boxers, feeling his cock and wrapping around it before outright humping into his hand. His face was covered in a blush from arousal, nothing had ever felt this intensely good. It was like he was indulging in something he hadn&#39;t gotten to do in so very long. But...didn&#39;t he usually whack off at least before a game or something?<br />
<br />
His sexual experience was fading into the aether except for the oddly sparse memories of laying into the soft folds of one or another fine wo-wome---damsels...and little did he realize his own conception of those he slept with was changing right before him. His mind was entirely too wrapped up in what he was doing right now. He didn&#39;t want to think about anything beyond the sheer sensation coming from down there. He bit his lip lightly and shook with this odd, foreign pleasure.<br />
<br />
His mind quivered as he tried to evaluate what was happening, but again it felt like his rational mind was losing ground to a more driven and hormonal perception of the world. Still him, but adrift in distinct new thought patterns and contexts.<br />
<br />
And you know what?<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t really care, for Mike was right now much too horny to think straight. His hand was simply going from head to base as fast as he could manage, for he knew he&#39;d have to get this done before anyone saw what had become of him. This was not right for a knight to do, but it was what he needed. He didn&#39;t give much thought to that errant musing.<br />
<br />
Even as Mike crudely jerked himself off, much odder transformations occurred - his hair thickened and lightened, making its way down to the middle of his neck and looking remarkable. His face even with the hair on the rest of him became thinner, more angular - handsome in more of a pretty way. His lips thicker slightly, rosy like tulips. His skin was clear on his face and he must have been quite a sight, so crudely jerking off despite how much of a pretty boy he was now.<br />
<br />
Mike groaned and kept thrusting away, not even noticing his clothes shifting and changing in their corner of the room. &quot;I must...achieve orgasm...afore any see that I would take such forbidden pleasure...&quot; He moaned outloud, and then thrust several more times, finding the head of his grown thicker cock was sensitive in the extreme. He was uncut down there...was he always like that? Well, he decided, it definitely enhanced his sensation of this.<br />
<br />
Michael felt his muscles tighten and grow just a bit more, his abdominals tightening and strengthening, his shoulders wide and strong as they needed to be to swing a sword as heavy as an English Claymore. He felt a ringing sense of strength and power...and then it came upon him. &quot;Oh...Oh...! It is bewitching! This sheer pleasure!&quot; He thrust a few more times into his hand as he jettisoned his cum across the floor, some of it reaching an impressive distance away from him.<br />
<br />
Michael took a moment to gather his thoughts, and slowly moved to get back up...and that was when he noticed the armor, &quot;W-What witchcraft is this!? I-I &#39;ave never seen aught like this in my life!&quot; He covered his mouth when he heard himself speak, and looked around. Everything was much the same, and yet the naked Michael had never felt so vulnerable in his life.<br />
<br />
Where his clothes once laid was now the cotton shirt, pants, hauberk, briefs, chain mail and armor of a knight, battle-forged and ready for war. His armor was black, and it contrasted with his pale skin. He felt his face with one hand, realizing how smooth he was now. Michael looked where there was once a picture of that knight, and saw only a mirror. He looked into it and saw the denuded spectacle of that very same knight.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I hath become the very knight once contained within that mystical portrait...&quot; Again he realized how he was talking. He took a moment and actually managed to speak normally, &quot;Well...damn. Takes a whole lot of effort...to talk as I used to. Almost instinctual to go into that weird flowery prose. Fuck, that knight is ripped...&quot; Michael flexed an arm and enjoyed the strength of his new look, feeling it surge up from within him. This was a readiness he could enjoy.<br />
<br />
He considered what to do from here. Surely he aught to find his friends, lest they be victimized by some foul transformative curse...</p>
