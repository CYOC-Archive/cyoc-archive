<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the singing of the contract, you were now legally part of the staff of the &quot;Neko Meido Cafe&quot;, and Madam Rikku Minazuki had told you to speak with Miss Nora for your duties for the day, it would leave a poor impression if you failed at your first basic task.<br />
<br />
You were told to &#39;go meet with Nora&#39;, having been identified as the cat girl maid with blue hair, but not where. This left you a bit uncomfortable, not having complete instructions, as the idea of fulfilling your orders wrong made you tense up. You breathed in and out, there was nothing to worry about. Just retrace your steps and you were bound to run into her. <br />
<br />
And you did, you found her going over a clipboard in front of what you instinctively knew was the kitchen. Except you didn&#39;t know how you knew it was the kitchen, and more than that, you knew that you didn&#39;t know how you knew it was the kitchen! This made your head swim. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I see the interview worked out.&quot; Nora smiled at you, her tail swaying behind her. You realize also that she&#39;s holding a pen with it!<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Miss Nora!&quot; You put your hands together in your lap and bow, as a good maid should. &quot;Madam Rikku Minazuki instructed this humble maid to show her around, and to give her a schedule of her duties.&quot; You said formally, Nora is your senior after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, gotta make sure it&#39;s all in your head right. Too bad really, with you two coming in at the same time, I sincerely hoping for you two to become stereotypical twins sisters. Our customers have been begging us for something like that. Maybe next time.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You mean Phillip Miss Nora?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... What did you say?&quot; Miss Nora said raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Phillip Marshal, he was interviewed before me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Don&#39;t you mean Phyllis?&quot; Nora said raising an eyebrow. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, Miss Nora, I apologize,&quot; contradicting your superior made you feel uneasier. &quot;But I am certain that his name was Phillip.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;No no no, I mean, okay, this is weird. Okay. This is awkward. Did you put on your entire uniform?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Miss Nora.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll have to talk to Madam Rikku Minazuki about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About what Miss Nora?&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Nora sighed. &quot;Okay, there is no &#39;Phillip&#39; not anymore. It&#39;s part of making sure our maids can retain a normal life while off the clock, it would be awkward to Phyllis to have to explain to her friends that she was now a cat girl. So everyone else except those already part of the Cafe and Phyllis herself should only remember Phyllis.&quot;<br />
<br />
You wiggled a bit. &quot;Uh, Miss Nora, does that mean that I&#39;ll be unable to take off my uniform?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is laundry day and well, we were going to go for magical self cleaning uniforms but those were too pricy and- wait. You DID read your contract right? It did say &#39;as long as you are employed&#39; you&#39;ll be a cat girl maid, mentally and physically, not &#39;when you&#39;re on the clock.&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH! I uh, did not think about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have a problem with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I don&#39;t Miss Nora.&quot; You answered honestly, the more you thought about it, the more having your triangle ears and tail just felt natural. &quot;But I do think that maybe I should.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. This is odd. You shouldn&#39;t be aware that you should have a problem with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Nora, wouldn&#39;t it be simpler to simply change erm, species, when off the clock? Out of curiosity,&quot; And it was just curiosity, the idea of trying to back out of your contract minutes after signing felt scandalous to say the least. <br />
<br />
&quot;Supposedly changing back and forth on a bi-daily basis can be unhealthy. Can cause some rather weird side effects.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You saw Erika right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;White fur? Yellow dress? Blue eyes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Yes I did Miss Nora!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She found a loop hole in her contract we&#39;ve since sealed off to change back and forth between Eric and Erika. Ironically, it&#39;ll confuse reality a lot if you flip-flop opposed to being constant. She didn&#39;t start out an ANTHRO cat girl maid. We were able to expand our customer base as a happy happenstance though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I understand Miss Nora.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Answer yes or no, do you have any problems with being a cat girl maid as of right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I don&#39;t. I... I remember feeling like fighting off a panic attack at first... but now I feel okay with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good! At least that worked. Don&#39;t take this the wrong way little girl, but the last thing we need is employees chaffing.&quot; Miss Nora began to scribble down some notes on a piece of paper, you hoped you hadn&#39;t displeased Madam Rikku Minazuki. <br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Nora... I think we&#39;re the same age.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Little girl, I&#39;ve been here for ten years, and I haven&#39;t aged a day.&quot; Miss Nora smirked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! I&#39;m sorry Miss Nora!&quot; You bow again, as a maid should. <br />
<br />
&quot;Forget about it, that wasn&#39;t an order by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Miss Nora so...&quot; You fidgeted. You felt like you&#39;d failed your employer before even starting somehow. &quot;Do you have any idea why I might be... defective?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First, don&#39;t call yourself &#39;defective&#39; ever again, that IS an order. Second, maybe you and Phyllis are &#39;meant to be&#39;.&quot; Miss Nora giggled, you blushed. &quot;Or maybe you just happen to have some untapped magical potential that muddled your transformation, and resisted the low level reality stretching. All in all, it&#39;s nothing to worry about.&quot;<br />
<br />
You breath a sigh of relief. &quot;Thank you Miss Nora.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now let&#39;s get this tour underway, we&#39;ve wasted enough time as is, and we need to give you the basics before the breatkfast crowd hits!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Miss Nora!&quot; You obediently follow. <br />
<br />
Your shown the way to the bathrooms, the supply closet for cleaning material, the storage room, the back door for employees, the employees room, the security system box, the power box, the closet for extra uniform and normal clothes, along with your employee card that already has your name on it, and you note Phyllis&#39; is already here too. How had it gotten done so fast? You also questions how all this space was fitting inside the strip mail space you saw outside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and the wireless password is IamAmaId. both &#39;I&#39;s capitalized, and the &#39;A&#39; in am is also capitalized.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Miss Nora.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And here&#39;s your ID card for getting in through the employee&#39;s door, it&#39;s wired so only you can use it. So don&#39;t try giving it to a friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never Miss Nora.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good kitty.&quot; You blush again. <br />
<br />
Nora then pulled out a transparent tablet with several check boxes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now. We cater to every anime archtype personalities in the book. It&#39;s part of our charm. The want ad did explicitly say to not bother showing up unless you&#39;re &#39;willing to accept major changes in your attitude and sense of self.&#39; And you signed the contract of your own free will, which mentioned it three time in the fine print.&quot;<br />
<br />
This time you merely bow your head. &quot;Yes Miss Nora.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look at the list of options on the tablet. Whao, that&#39;s a lot. You don&#39;t even recognize three quarters of these, let alone all of them. <br />

<br />
&quot;Uh, Miss Nora, to be clear, does this mean, my personality will be chosen by our honored guests?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Worried?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. But I think I should be.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s odd.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? That I&#39;m not worried?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that&#39;s normal, what&#39;s odd is that you care that you&#39;re not worried. but let me put it to rest. Me and Rikku Minazuki both have an emergency override command to reset to your normal happy obedient maid self. And there&#39;s an emergency switch under the country as well. But don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s just that, &#39;for emergencies&#39;, like a fire alarm. It&#39;s just to keep the fire inspectors happy and the like, nothing bad will happen, I promise Beverly.&quot;<br />
<br />
She patted you on the back and gave you a gently hug. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Miss Nora.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome kiddo. There are many anime girl cliche personalities, but we can&#39;t afford to have one for every type on staff, and plus there might be two customers who might request one of the same time at the same time. It&#39;s how we keep a leg up on our competition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Competition?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I&#39;ll tell after you&#39;ve settled in. Now today you&#39;ll be waiting on tables, you have experience with that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Miss Nora, I&#39;ve worked at restaurants before...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good! The basic info should be wired into you just in case. Be sure to treat every honored guests like you would the master of the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Miss Nora, thank you Miss Nora!&quot; You were eager to show that you were a good maid in spite of some hiccups in your introduction. <br />
<br />
In the cafe proper, you saw the other maids had finished getting ready, including Erika.  <br />
<br />
Unlike before, you noticed that the red maid had a lioness ears and tail, the blue maid had a tiger&#39;s ears and tail, and the purple dressed maid had either a cheetah&#39;s or a leopard&#39;s. <br />
<br />
Nora handled things behind the counter. You noticed that Madam Rikku Minazuki herself was in the kitchen along with Phyllis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! One more thing!&quot; Miss Nora said quickly, &quot;We sometimes we some rather, ahem, magical customers ourselves here, just act natural, that&#39;s an order.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Miss Nora!&quot; <br />
<br />
You were expected to stand at attention waiting for the first customers to come in, and it didn&#39;t take long before they did. The first one was a totally unexceptional man in a brown jacket and a five o&#39;clock shadow. <br />
<br />
&quot;New one?&quot; He asked looking you over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Sir, I started today.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the transparent display in front of him, he clicked &#39;Meganekko.&#39;<br />
<br />
Your vision goes blurry for a moment as glass appear on you. Oh my! You hoped that y-you&#39;d do okay! You could feel everyone&#39;s eyes on you! You retreated into yourself a bit. &quot;R-right this way sir!&quot; You curled your tail around yourself defensively. <br />
<br />
You dainty try to take his hand but you can&#39;t bring yourself to! He politely follows behind as you lead him to his seat. He orders a cup of coffee as a blue berry muffin. <br />
<br />
&quot;R-right away sir!&quot; You wondered if there was an employees manual, you really wanted to read it. In fact, there were so many books at home that you hadn&#39;t read! So many books, so lonely, no one reading them, just gather dust. Just like you kinda. Maybe you could keep each other company. <br />
<br />
The customer talked about some anime where a modern-day Japanese army wiped the floor with a supposedly fantasy army but was really just a technologically inferior medieval force after it had tried to invade Japan. You do your best to just smile and nod. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for the coffee.&quot; He left a generous tip. <br />
<br />
&quot;W-welcome Master!&quot; <br />
<br />
As he leaves, the glasses vanish and your eyesight returns to normal along with your level of confidence. You remember thinking of all those lonely books, but you&#39;re surprised to think how much your empathized with them. <br />
<br />
You clean up the table once he&#39;s gone, you&#39;d barely finished when a new customer arrives. You&#39;re surprised to see it&#39;s a woman. She&#39;s wearing black sunglasses that matched her long black hair and black dress, that unlike you, she was wearing unironically. <br />
<br />
Unlike the last customer she didn&#39;t even really look at you, she just selected &#39;Pasokon.&#39; <br />
<br />
Instantly your legs came together and your arms were straight at your side. You back was even straighter than before and your stared straight ahead. Your tail likewise goes stiff and straight. Your skin becomes shiny plastic, and you feel your emotions become less pronounced, as overwhelming sense of your FUNCTION, fills you. You don&#39;t see it, but your eyes look like glass, and your face only has a faint smile on your face as your stare straight ahead. Your cat ears become plastic also. <br />
<br />
&quot;This maid will lead you to your table Miss.&quot; You said perfectly and evenly, and each step identical to the last, you lead the customer to a table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Order please.&quot; You say with the efficiency of an automated teller. You don&#39;t need to write it down. You have the entire menu in your data base. <br />
<br />
The customer gives an order number, you accept the number and relay it to Phyllis without thinking much about her beyond her part in your function. It didn&#39;t matter what the order was. Your only function was to deliver it. <br />
<br />
After it was ready and delivered, you stood perfectly still at attention, the customer just looking calmly at you like a statues before leaving. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me madam, normal tips are at 15%, this is 10%.&quot; You say mechanically at the obvious mathematical error. <br />
<br />
The woman narrows her eyes behind her glasses, and look at Nora who keeps a straight face. The woman puts down some extra money and leaves. You shift back to normal flesh and blood cat girl, and gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MISS NORA! This maid insulted our customer, -I-!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Save it. Don&#39;t worry about. This stuff happens. You&#39;re acting the way they DECIDE for you to act. If they think you have an attitude problem, then it&#39;s their own fault for choosing your attitude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... t-thank you Miss Nora.&quot; <br />
<br />
At this point, the customers really started to come in, and all four of you were kept busy. <br />
<br />
The red lion maid&#39;s first customer picked &#39;Loli&#39; and she lost nearly all her bosom and a foot in height, and treated the customer like she would a big sibling. <br />
<br />
The blue tiger maid&#39;s first customers chose &#39;Ojou&#39; and she became more lithe and moved with a high class air, treating the customers as honored guests at HER house rather than a lowly servant. <br />
<br />
The purple dressed leopard/cheetah (you still didn&#39;t know which)&#39;s customers chose &#39;Bifauxnen&#39;, she grew taller, more muscular, her hair grew out, and her features became more gender neutral as she acted calm and in control. <br />
<br />
Your next customer chose &#39;Yandere&#39;. There was a warning label next to that option. You had a hug grin on your face and a distant look in your eyes. Thinking how much pain you&#39;d deliver on anything who dare hurt your poor sweet, beautiful guest, oh yes, YOUR guest, your-, you shivered a bit when the customer left and you shifted to your default maid self.<br />
<br />
The cheetah/leopard gave you a quick hug. &quot;Hey, new girl, don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-thank you.&quot; You say, you forget to ask her name before you both have more customers to service.<br />
<br />
The entire day went like this, each customer choosing a different personality for you. Meganekko was apparently popular that day. You also hit a string of &#39;True Neko. Your eyes became slit, fangs grew from your mouth, and, a bell appeared at the end of your tail and around your neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nya! Right thiss way way Masster!&quot; You giggled, as you led along the group of friends along. You asked your customers about themselves, who seemed unused to, but happy to have a lady actually want to know more about them. You felt so energetic and free! More than a couple told you how cute you were. It also took you a while to realize your hair had turned purple. You giggled at this too. <br />
<br />
You were True Neko for a couple of hours. You can&#39;t say you didn&#39;t like it. And you were left some very generous tips. It just about time for your lunch break when one more customer came. He looked like a perfectly average officer worker, the type you&#39;d never pick out in a crowd. <br />
<br />
He selected Kamidere. The bells vanished as did you extra feline features. You actually did your best to look down on this man even though he was a bit taller than you. &quot;Alright! Come along! Let&#39;s go feed your face minion!&quot; You said and turn around commandingly on one feel, ready to march him one to one table. Instead, he reached behind and grabbed from your breasts, folding them. Or rather, tried to, the moment before he would have made contact, he cries out, an electric shock passing through, his nerve endings automatically jerking his hands back. &quot;HEY! JERK!&quot; You snapped.<br />
<br />
You got ready to kick this jackass between the legs when Nora pressed the jewel on a bracelet you hadn&#39;t been able to perceive the existence of and couldn&#39;t afterwards. You were instantaneously your typical maid self. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unless you want breasts and cat ears yourself, don&#39;t come back.&quot; Miss Nora sadly darkly. Miss Rikku Minazuki made no attempt to object to this. The lion and tiger maids grabbed him and pushed him out. <br />
<br />
Nora sighed. &quot;Beverly, I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry, that... that isn&#39;t how things normally go around here. I swear. I... Erika, get out here, watch the bar for  me. Beverly? Let&#39;s take your break now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Miss Nora,&quot; You said. <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
&quot;So as you can see, Madam Rikku Minazuki has it set so none of the customers can &#39;have their way&#39; with us. Thankfully none of us have ever had to test it to see if it works while we&#39;re not on the clock. But some people... get a little too caught up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This maid... This maid understand Miss Nora.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two of you were in the employee&#39;s room casually eating a pair of sandwiches, Nora&#39;s treat. The place like the rest of the cafe was bigger than you expected, and a lot more welcoming and peaceful. <br />
<br />
&quot;So I just want to know that you&#39;re okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Miss Nora, this isn&#39;t this maid&#39;s first time dealing with riffraff. She can handle herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy to hear it. And here, as long as we&#39;re together.&quot; She gave you a box with a set of DVDs in them. &quot;This is your orientation package. First four episodes of Sailor Moon Crystal, classic Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, and first four episodes of the first season of Digital Monsters. This should give you some basics. I&#39;ll help the customers feel more sociable around you.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;This maid understands Miss Nora! She will watch them once she&#39;s at home without delay!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you live alone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Miss Nora, with my parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. Well, don&#39;t worry, they SHOULDN&#39;T find anything odd about you being a cat girl maid. If they do, come and see me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will Miss Nora. Is it troubling if they do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not &#39;trouble&#39;, it will just be awkward for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Miss Nora, this humble servant would desire to continue to serve even at the cost of some &#39;awkwardness!&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. But seriously, with some secondary bits of your change didn&#39;t quite stick, it might be genetic. Be sure to calmly explain if they notice, and make clear you READ the contract.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Miss Nora.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to take the rest of the day off? I promise it won&#39;t look bad on your record.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. This servant is fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
The rest of the day passed without anything unpleasant. You got to be &#39;Loli&#39; a couple of times, it was like you were working in your family&#39;s own shop and treating family rather than serving customers! <br />
<br />
Leopard/Cheetah was &#39;Dojikko&#39; (another one that came with a warning) and nearly dropped the very large collection of orders she&#39;d been given, but with cat like reflexes she managed to catch every single one, the last one she caught with her tail. The customers clapped at this, and her tip was extra large at that. <br />
<br />
As the sun was setting, the large group of customers who were in at the same time, selected Aidoru for all four of you! <br />
<br />
The four of you grew taller, thinner, an optimistic view flowed out of your heart. Your figure and face were those of set of super models! A wireless microphone materialized in your hands. Your hair became long and each of you had them in different sets of braids. Lyrics filled your mind and without giving it a second thought the four of you began to sing in sync to a song called &#39;Catch The Moment!&#39; It was also mostly in Japanese, but you knew what every words in the song meant and were able to give the proper inflection. The four of you feeling like part of a whole. <br />
<br />
After the song was finished, the customers cheered, and the tips you got were very nice indeed. You panted, a bit tired, but decidedly happy. Looking around, you saw your three co-workers looked very happy themselves. All four of you hugged, wrapping your tails around each other. <br />
<br />
Phyllis from the kitchen giggled. <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t sure what to expect when you got home, but the sooner it was done the better. Hopefully your parents would simply accept you were a cat girl maid now and that would be that and you could skip any awkward or uncomfortable conversations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Expect to see you bright and early tomorrow.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Miss Nora, this humble servant shall obey.&quot; You smile and bow. <br />
<br />
Since you had come in your black dress, you didn&#39;t really have anything to change into, did you have change into anything? You felt perfectly comfortable in your uniform, and no one outside gave you so much as an odd glance. For not being dressed like a maid, and let alone for being a cat girl. <br />
<br />
You did keep the DVDs with you, &quot;This maid promises to return them safe and sound Miss Nora.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; She smiled. <br />
<br />
You REALLY HAD to get to know your co-workers better. But today had been so dizzying the chance hadn&#39;t really come up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; It was Phyllis. Like you, she was wearing her maid uniform outside too. &quot;Nice to see you got in too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is.&quot; You said to your fellow maid. Was she a superior too for getting hired a few minute before you? Or was that splitting hairs? &quot;I am happy for you too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks! Hey! You notice that place across the street before?&quot;<br />
<br />
Phyllis pointed.<br />
<br />
You followed her finger, and it led straight to another cafe straight across from the strip mall. Literally right across from the &quot;Neko Meido Cafe&quot;. It had a similar build, and a similar glowing neon sigh, but instead the words were “Inu Meido Cafe”. It also seemed kinda bigger, but that didn&#39;t seem to mean much with how big the &quot;Neko Meido Cafe&quot; was on the inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;And that, is our competition.&quot; Nora said, startling the both of you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Nora!&quot; You both instantly bow together. <br />
<br />
&quot;No need for that off the clock girls. But yeah, they opened up after we did and... well, they say competition is healthy, but there is such a thing as not playing fair.&quot; <br />
<br />
You hear some music coming across from the other cafe, with lots of heavy beats to it. There might have been some flashing lights, but that might have been just your imagination. You did get to see through the large windows that it seemed to have more an arian theme. <br />
<br />
This place... you&#39;d assumed it was some kinda night club, or just some novelty store... you hadn&#39;t really given it much thought. And some of the customers coming and going... something about them seemed slightly... off somehow. There also seemed to be a bouncer outside, maybe, or a greeter. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEEEEYYYYY! Beverly!&quot; <br />
<br />
You startled when someone came running across the street to you. Practically bouncing with every step. It took you a few seconds to realize, it was an anthromorphic poodle woman. (no way she could be called &#39;girl&#39; with a chest like THAT). She was also dressed like an ideal medieval waitress from Switzerland or something. She was also bare foot. She skipped right up to you, nearly getting in your face, her tail wagging. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY! You got hired by one of these places too?! THIS IS SO COOL! I HEARD you were looking for a job! I was gonna tell you about this place, but looks like you beat me to it! Tee-hee!&quot;<br />
<br />
You were confused at how this could be... but then, you looked in the blond (both her hair and fur) poodle woman eyes and it dawned on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Luan?&quot; You whispered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, it&#39;s Fifi now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fifi?!&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded eagerly. &quot;Ya ya! It was in my contact! Wow! You remember my name was Luan? It feels like dream to me really!&quot; You took your hand in hers. &quot;Come on! You have got to see this place!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a good idea.&quot; Miss Nora said, not as an order really, but like a genuine worry. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hello! You two part of the kitty cat resturant?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Neko Meido Cafe.&quot; Nora said with a straight face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Okay!&quot;<br />
<br />
You were whirling a bit. Luan had NEVER been THAT stacked in the chest, and she hadn&#39;t been exactly flat to begin with. <br />
<br />
&quot;Luan, I mean, Fifi, are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I&#39;m better than okay! I&#39;m great!&quot; <br />
<br />
Off handedly, you notice that a Dalmatian Girl (Dalmatian ears and tail), who was leaving the Inu Meido Cafe, apparently done for the day, her neck line lower cut, and her dress shorter than yours. <br />
<br />
&quot;FIFI!&quot; Came a snarl. <br />
<br />
Fifi twirled around. &quot;OH! Frisky! I&#39;m just saying hello to my friend Beverly!&quot; <br />
<br />
It was a fox girl, (human except for ears and tail and fang). Her red uniform that matched her fur looked a little more like a swim suit to you. She had a plain gold earring on one ear. <br />
<br />
Behind her, you spotted the &#39;bouncer&#39; behind Frisky for back-up. A woman girl, no fur, she had a spikd collar, and a bouple &#39;bad girl&#39; tattoos. You hope it was just part of her &#39;job persona.&#39; Her black outfit was similar to Frisky&#39;s. The wolf girl just stayed quiet. <br />
<br />
Something about them was making your hair stand on end, and giving you an instinctive need to make yourself look bigger. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you fall asleep during orientation?! You aren&#39;t supposed to go near this place!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s right across the street so-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But quiet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mistress,&quot; Fifi said instantly. <br />
<br />
You felt Phyllis put a hand on your shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now listen! What you do when not working is your business! But remember what the Mistress said! While you&#39;re on the clock, your &#39;friend&#39;, is the enemy!&quot; <br />
<br />
Fifi whimpered under Frisky&#39;s steel gaze, and submissively knelt slightly. &quot;Yes Mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
You have had enough. &quot;Hey!&quot; You step between Fifi and Frisky. &quot;I know it&#39;s part of your transformation, but do you have to be such a b-&quot; <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
&quot;You do realize that technically she&#39;s a vixen right?&quot; Erika said causually, wearing a maid uniform with the red cross. Her ID in this &#39;form&#39; even insisted she was legally qualified to treat everything from broken bones to a heart attack. She was sewing up the claw marks on your back after disinfecting and cleaning the wounds. <br />
<br />
&quot;I stand by what I said,&quot; You say matter of act. <br />
<br />
&quot;At least you gave as good as you got.&quot; Phyllis smiled, now sporting a few band-aids. &quot;I didn&#39;t know we had retractable claws.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t either,&quot; you said looking at your hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wolfie promises that Fifi won&#39;t get in trouble,&quot; Nora said coming in. &quot;And I promise neither of you would be picking fights.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She started it! I have the scratches to prove it!&quot; You protest.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; Phyllis backs you up. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s our word against theirs. Fifi won&#39;t betray her masters, loyalty is part of her nature now. And Madam Rikku Minazuki agrees that its better we don&#39;t get the police involved with you two trying to claws each other up. If you want to check on Fifi on your off hours, no one is going to stop you, I promise. I&#39;ll stir up some &#39;discrimination&#39; mumbo jumbo if anyone tries. Beverly, go home, get some rest, watch some anime, spend time with your family. That&#39;s an order.&quot;<br />
<br />
You are a still a maid, and as as a good maid you bow. &quot;Yes Miss Nora, this maid obey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That goes for you too Phyllis!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Miss Nora, this maid obey.&quot;</p>
