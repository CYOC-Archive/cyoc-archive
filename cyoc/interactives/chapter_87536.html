<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha sighed, &quot;I guess I should talk to him before we do anything else but I want you two to come with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise and Katie looked at Samantha curiously. &quot;Why do you want us along?&quot; They asked. Samantha blushed wildly as she looked at her friends. &quot;It&#39;s embarrassing being this young and talking to the man I&#39;ve loved for 45 years. If you two are with me I won&#39;t feel as embarrassed besides it would seem less weird if a group of kids sat down with him instead of just me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise and Katie looked at eachother and shrugged. &quot;Whatever makes you comfortable Sammy we&#39;ve got your back,&quot; Mary Elise said with smile. Taking a deep breath Samantha now led her friends out of the play area and began the trip to see Jacob.<br />
<br />
As Samantha slowly began walking towards Jacob she couldn&#39;t help but feel small and childish. While Mary Elise and Katie had decided to braid their hair in French braids Samantha decided on a pair of childish pigtails. Once again she found herself regretting a decision. For Samantha it was nothing new she always seemed to get into these situations Jacob and her often laughed about how if she didn&#39;t have bad luck she wouldn&#39;t have any luck at all. Now dressed in a purple t-shirt, denim shorts and bright purple socks she looked like the most innocent seven year old in the world. She quietly wondered if she should have aged herself back to normal but shook her head, this was supposed to be a fun weekend.  Still unsure of what to say to her husband Samantha finally arrived at her husbands booth taking a deep breath and summoning all the courage her seven year old body could muster she waved at Jacob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi mister,&quot; Samantha squeaked. Jacob looked down at the small group of girls in front of him and smiled. &quot;Hello girls,&quot; he said. &quot;Are you having a fun time today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded her head and smiled. &quot;Yep were having a great time,&quot; she replied. &quot;You mind if we sit down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob looked over the group of girls with a curious look. &quot;Your folks know your over here.&quot; He asked. &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Samantha said quickly. &quot;My friends mom is right over their, she knows we came over..we just wanted to come over and ask what brought you here today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob looked over the group of seven year olds with a curious look before smiling. &quot;Sure girls why don&#39;t you have a seat.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls smiled and slid into the booth. Now sitting across from her husband Samantha couldn&#39;t help but feel even younger. Her sock covered feet didn&#39;t touch the ground causing them to sway slightly. It seemed to take a great effort to keep her legs still. Too make matters worse Mary Elise and Katie had given into some of their childish instincts swaying their feet rhythmically. The sound of their feet tapping against the seat made it difficult for Samantha not to give in to the same instincts. Now looking up at her husband she tried to force a smile but could already feel her cheeks blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what brings you here today,&quot; Samantha asked. &quot;Did you bring your grand kids with you today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob smiled at the young girl causing Samantha to blush harder and look down at the table. Even at his advanced age Samantha found Jacob attractive. His weathered and kind face, receding gray hair, and steely blue eyes gave off a picture of strength and warmness. Hearing his soft voice always made Samantha feel safe. Looking over his fit body Samantha felt a sense of warmth flood over her. Although her body was too young to process it she felt love for this man.<br />
<br />
&quot;No sweety I&#39;m hear by myself today,&quot;  he said. &quot;I like to treat myself to the occasional burger and shake every so often.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you married,&quot; Katie asked. Samantha shot her a look of vengeance before turning back to Jacob and smiling. Jacob laughed and smiled. &quot;Yes I&#39;m married,&quot; Jacob laughed. &quot;My wife is a beautiful and loving woman named Samantha. She&#39;s away this weekend with some friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t mind her going out all the time,&quot; Mary Elise asked. Samantha once again forced a smile while silently fuming on the inside. &quot;If we make it through this I swear I&#39;m going To kill these two.&quot; Samantha silently thought as she attempted to stare daggers at her friends. Mary Elise and Katie both giggled in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Jacob replied. &quot;My wife had to deal with me working a lot before I retired. Our relationship has always been strong we enjoy the time we spend together no matter how short it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls awed at Jacobs response and looked at Samantha who was desperately trying to hide her blushing cheeks. &quot;I don&#39;t think I got your names girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Mary Elise and this is my sister Katie,&quot; Jacob nodded in response before turning to Samantha. Samantha desperately tried to maintain eye contact with Jacob but could feel her cheeks burning with embarrassment. &quot;What&#39;s your name little one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh her name is Samantha,&quot; Mary Elise said. &quot;Don&#39;t mind her she gets a little shy sometimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob smiled and looked at Samantha. &quot;That&#39;s a very pretty name for a very pretty little girl,&quot; he said. &quot;You don&#39;t need to be shy Samantha after all your the one that came to talk to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She likes to be called Sammy,&quot; Katie said with a giggle. Samantha was mortified and looked up at her husband. Jacob continued to smile looking down at Samantha with kind eyes. &quot;My wife likes to be called Sammy too, would you like me to call you Sammy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded and looked up Jacob. &quot;Sammy thank you for making my day,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s always nice to talk to a group a nice young ladies especially when I get to talk about my favorite subject in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha smiled up at her husband. &quot;Your welcome sir.. by the way what&#39;s your name?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The names Jacob. Anyway I best be going you girls have a nice weekend.&quot; As Jacob went to stand Samantha felt the urge to say something. &quot;I&#39;m sure your wife misses you too Jake,&quot; she said. &quot;You should listen to her though when she says to lay off the fast food.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob stopped and stared down curiously at the young girls. He hadn&#39;t mentioned anything about Samantha not liking him eating fast food. That she had called him Jake was also surprising, no one called him Jake except his wife. Looking at the little brunette girl he couldn&#39;t shake the feeling he recognized her from somewhere. Shrugging he turned and began to walk away. Samantha saw him walking and began to wonder if she should go after him.</p>
