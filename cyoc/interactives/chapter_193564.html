<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie was calming down at this point. She was really freaking out at the thought that they’d never be able to get out of this stupid room. Tiff had been carefully making her way through one of them many shelves of completely random crap. At the stage she was at, she only recognised half of the stuff there, but she wasn’t willing to spend any unnecessary time trying to figure it out. She just wanted the key and to get out of here.<br />
<br />
Katie looked at Tiff rummaging through stacks of junk. She didn’t want to interfere, so she decided to have a look around on her own. A few shelves down, she saw something she recognised… a bikini.<br />
“Tiff, check this out!” Katie yelled to her friend,<br />
“Not right now, Katie!” Tiff yelled back,<br />
“Seriously! This guy must’ve had a girlfriend or something,”<br />
“What is it?” Tiff was now a little intrigued, she looked over her shoulder, making sure she didn’t lose track of where she was,<br />
“It’s like… a weird bikini,” Katie replied,<br />
“What kind of bikini?” Tiff asked, tempted to leave her position,<br />
“Umm…” Katie responded, aware of how limited her knowledge of sexy clothing was, “like… one of the small ones,”<br />
“A micro-bikini?” Tiff asked, wanting to move more than ever,<br />
“I don’t know?” Katie said, she decided to pick it up. She grabbed at the strings and let it lower. Katie wasn’t too well versed in clothing, but the bikini looked huge, “so much for a micro-bikini,” she said to herself,<br />
“What?”<br />
“Nothing,” Katie responded. She turned it over, seeing a little name tag, “It says Sadie on it,” she remarked,<br />
“Sadie?”<br />
“Yeah. Sadie, DBL-WTR-MLN,” she read aloud, “that’s so weird,” Katie said, putting the bikini back where she found it.<br />
<br />
Tiff shook her head, “Katie, I really gotta focus on finding this key,”<br />
“Yeah, yeah. I know,” Katie replied, “I’ll just be over here,” she said,<br />
<br />
A few minutes passed. Tiff was now onto the next level of the large metal shelves, but still no progress with the key situation. She was being slow and careful, already seeing a number of sharp objects.<br />
Katie, on the other hand, was standing on her own. She was just looking at one of the shelves, admiring the interesting gadgets and gizmo’s on the shelves.<br />
She had been casually rubbing her chest for a while, not something she did too often, but not something too out of the ordinary. But she was doing it pretty frequently. She even realised it herself. She looked down, seeing her already kind of tight bra under her regular purple shirt. She was a late bloomer, unlike her friend. Her boobs never really came in. At almost 18 years old, Katie had only recently started to grow some semblance of breasts. She didn’t think it was enough to buy new bras though.<br />
She looked back at her chest, lifting her shirts neck a little to see down. Strange… she never remembered her bra creating any real cleavage. She decided to find a mirror to really look at herself.<br />
As she looked around for a mirror, she started feeling a sharp, pinching pain in her back. She tried to reach around to feel it, but before she could even get to it. She felt an even sharper ping, causing her to yelp suddenly,<br />
<br />
“Eep!” <br />
“Everything okay?” Tiff asked, looking up from her shelf for a brief second before going right back to her shelf,<br />
“Y-yeah…” Katie said, rubbing her back from under her shirt.<br />
She found a mirror in the corner of the room. It was a small face mirror, but it would do. She leant on her tip-toes and looked at her chest,<br />
“Wow,” she said to herself, “this bra really makes it look like I have boobs,”<br />
Then her bra fell out of her shirt and onto the ground.<br />
<br />
Katie’s eyes widened, she quickly grabbed her breasts from over her shirt, feeling them,<br />
“Oh my god!” She said to herself, “they’re real!” She tried to stay quiet. <br />
Usually, Katie would be freaking out… but there was only one thing on her mind,<br />
“Hey Tiff!” She said, loudly, her back to her best friend. She could feel her breasts growing slowly,<br />
<br />
Tiff sighed from frustration, “yes, Katie,” she replied, choosing not to look up from the shelf,<br />
“What bra size are you?” Katie asked, devilishly,<br />
“What!?” Tiff responded, taken by surprise. She stepped backwards, she suddenly felt a sharp pain in her right hand, “OUCH!” She screamed.<br />
Katie turned around suddenly, concerned for her friend. Tiff saw a small red scratch on the back of her hand, she looked at the shelf and immediately knew she’d been scratched by a little needle attached to a box,<br />
“Are you alright!?” Katie asked, starting to walk towards her friend. As she did, she quickly came to the realisation that these breasts were a lot more sensitive than before. She let out a quick breath before grabbing her boobs, which caused to involuntarily moan aloud,<br />
<br />
“Katie?” Tiff said, looking at her friend. She was still rubbing the scratch on her hand. But seeing her friend with her hands on her boobs, “what the hell are you doing!?” Tiff yelled, pointing at Katie,<br />
“I-I…” Katie said, realising what she was doing, she let go of her breasts, allowing them to fall down. <br />
<br />
Tiff was in shock. Katie, her previously flat-chested friend, had suddenly grown two full-sized knockers! Not only were they bigger than her own, but they were fuller, more mature,<br />
“What did you do!?” Tiff yelled, unable to do anything but point at her,<br />
“I don’t know!” Katie said, “b-but…” she tried to hide her smirk, “are they bigger than yours?” She asked, trying to make her friend jealous,<br />
“Obviously!” Tiff responded, walking over to Katie to look at them closer. Without hesitating, she grabbed them over her shirt,<br />
“Tiffany!” Katie yelled, pushing her away,<br />
“They’re real,” Tiff looked at her friend in shock, “what did this!?”<br />
“I said I don’t know,” Katie said again, “but they’re still growing!” Katie said delighted,<br />
“Oh my god…” Tiff said, unable to process what was going on, she rubbed her scratch again, “you know what this means…”<br />
“I’m gonna have the biggest boobs in school!!” Katie cheered, lifting her large breasts with her arm, accentuating their size,<br />
“Y-yeah…” Tiff said, trying to understand what’s going on,<br />
“People are gonna talk to me! They’re gonna ask ‘oh wow! You look so cute in that top’ and I’m gonna be like ‘yeah, well it’s just because my boobs grew like ten sizes’ and they’ll be like ‘oh wow they did look’ and—” Katie stopped, dead in her tracks,<br />
<br />
Tiff wasn’t listening to Katie, but she knew she wasn’t talking anymore, “What?” She asked, noticing that Katie was looking directly at her,<br />
“What’s happening to your face?” She asked,<br />
“My face?” Tiff responded. She quickly went for the mirror, looking at herself. Her cheeks… they looked bloated, like she was having some kind of allergic reaction, “what the hell…” she said, rubbing her cheeks with her fingers. Then she noticed her fingers. They looked swollen… so did her hands. In fact, the area where her hand was scratched looked even more swollen than the rest of her. Tiff wasn’t aware before, but now she was starting to feel herself bloating. Specifically, she felt her belly.<br />
She quickly lifted her shirt, seeing her usually pretty flag tummy looking a lot softer. Squishier. She placed her hands on it, feeling it bloating, “No!!” She yelled, “this can’t be happening!!” She screamed, she placed her hands on her butt, feeling it swell in the same manor.<br />
<br />
“Tiff, we’ll figure this out! Just stay calm,” Katie said, trying not to panic with her,<br />
“STAY CALM!?” Tiff yelled in response, “you suddenly grow big boobs, then I start blowing up like a balloon and all of a sudden you’re telling ME to stay calm!?” Tiff responded with rage. Suddenly, she felt herself bloat very quickly. Her whole body bloated, especially her belly. It was getting rounder, too. Ironically, even her breasts were starting to bloat, straining her own bra.<br />
Her cheeks were getting bigger and bigger, making it harder for her to talk, she was afraid it might start affecting her breathing,<br />
“Kathie! I neeth-you to helth me fix thith, it’th gething too tight!”<br />
<br />
Katie was starting to realise the severity of the situation. Tiff, once again, bloated even bigger. Her feet were bloating, her legs, her arms! Her torso was starting to look more like a ball with two boobs attached to it. She was even starting to look taller.<br />
Katie quickly rushed to where Tiff had been before, looking at the variety of non-organised junk,<br />
“Carethul!” Tiff shouted from across the room. Katie looked at her, she suddenly bloated again. Her joggers tore at the sides, her bra also snapped,<br />
“What am I looking for!?” Katie yelled urgently,<br />
“A boxth with a—” Tiff started, but was suddenly interrupted by another bloat. Her joggers tore even more,<br />
<br />
Katie was freaking out, unable to focus. A box with a…<br />
“A needle!” Katie gasped, seeing it. The needle seemed to shine in the light of the sun. Katie grabbed it (carefully) and ran back over to Tiff, ignoring the new bounce that came with her still growing breast.<br />
She took the box and gently poked it into Tiff’s belly.<br />
<br />
Tiff and Katie stood there, waiting for something to happen. But nothing did,<br />
“I did it!” Katie said, pumping her hands in the air. Then suddenly her breasts tore open the centre of her own shirt, revealing her huge full breasts, “oops…” she said, giggling, “maybe these are a little too big… but I’m sure I can figure—”<br />
<br />
Tiff’s belly suddenly bloated about four times its size! Almost knocking Katie over. <br />
Tiff couldn’t stand with the weight of her belly, she fell forward and landed on her bloated belly, feeling it bounce a little as she did. The rest of her body also continued to bloat. Her breasts looked as though they were going to burst right out of her top. Her joggers were on their last legs and her butt had almost burst out of the back,<br />
“Shit!” Katie shouted, falling to her back, dropping the needled box next to her. She stared at her giant inflated friend with utter horror. She turned her head towards the box. It had fall on it’s side and she could see underneath it. There was a dial.<br />
<br />
She quickly grabbed the box and looked at the dial. It had a number of options to select, and currently it was set to ‘full body, bloat’. Katie turned the dial to ‘stop’. She stood herself up, and rush to Tiff,<br />
“NO!” Tiff yelled, afraid Katie might make it even worse. But Katie didn’t stop, she tapped the needle right into Tiff’s exposed belly.<br />
<br />
Tiff immediately felt a difference. The bloated feeling still there, but it didn’t feel like it was still coming.<br />
“Did it work?” Katie asked,<br />
“Thhh-” Tiff responded,<br />
“Thank god…” Katie said. She sighed, putting her hands on her hips. She realised she still had the box in her hands and quickly moved to not stab herself. She placed it the ground neatly, making sure the needle wasn’t going to be accidentally poked.<br />
<br />
As Katie leant down, she realised how big her breasts were. They were bigger than her head, bigger than watermelons,<br />
“Oh wow…” she said, feeling them in her hands, they didn’t even fit in two hands, “and they’re still growing!” Katie said, “it was cool at the start… but these are just too big!”<br />
“Thpeak for yourshelf,” Tiff responded, wobbling her body.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Katie said, “let’s fix you, then we’ll sort me out,”<br />
Katie picked the box back up and looked at the dials,<br />
“So there’s ‘full body, bloat’”<br />
“No,” Tiff interrupted,<br />
“I know!” Katie responded, “next, there’s ‘area-specific, bloat’. Followed by ‘full body, deflate,”<br />
“It’th that one!” Tiff said through her bloated cheeks,<br />
“Got it,” Katie said. She took the needle and poked it right into Tiff’s belly. Maybe she did it a little hard, but Tiff immediately let out a hard breath of air, “Sorry!!” Katie said quickly,<br />
“It’s working!!” Tiff said joyfully.<br />
<br />
“Yay!” Katie cheered, watching as her friend deflated slowly, “now we really gotta do something about these,” Katie said, pointing at her still expanding breasts.</p>
