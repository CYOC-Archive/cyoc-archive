<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff woke up and realized that he felt like getting up. This was a new feeling for him as he was never a morning person. He actually felt like getting things done. Upon moving he felt his bed was wet and, fearing he had wet himself turned on the light. Much to his dismay he found that he hadn&#39;t wet himself but precummed himself, soaking the bed down. That explains the plastic sheet he thought bitterly.<br />
<br />
Sighing he decided to deal with it later, as currently he needed to pee and had a massive headache. He stumbled to the bathroom and flipped on the light curious as to how peeing works with all his penises pointing different directions. With them being so long he found he could gather them and aim in the same direction, but with so many places for the urine to exit the pressure was low and he had to stand directly over the bowl.<br />
<br />
Looking into the mirror for the first time, he simultaneously noticed that he has a receding hair line, and stubble to rival his father&#39;s. Next he noticed that he has an adult pelt of body hair and his body type had changed from scrawny to beefy. He felt excited and happy about the muscle gain and ability to grow a beard, mixed about the body hair. On one hand he liked it, but his arm hair crawled over his shoulders and practically connected to his beard. It was a little much. Finally, he was horrified at clearly beginning to go bald. He should have another two decades before that happens, shouldn&#39;t he?<br />
<br />
The multitude of emotions equated to excitement, and before he realized it, his cocks were standing at attention. Jeff suddenly was feeling out of breath and excruciatingly horny. He stumbled downstairs and fumbled with his milking machine setting it for 30 minutes. That should take care of him for a while.<br />
<br />
While strapped in and going through his second series of ejaculations, the rest of the family woke up and came downstairs. His mom was first, &quot;Oh good, I was afraid you forgot about your doctors appointment this morning. I&#39;m glad to see you are getting ready.&quot; Not that Jeff could focus on anything while being milked. <br />
<br />
Jeff was surprised when his mother placed a full plate of eggs, potatoes, bowl of oatmeal, and orange juice in front of him, and told him there was more waiting for him when he&#39;s ready. He glanced at his fathers plate which barely had half the contents. He was more surprised when he ate it all like it was a snack, went back for seconds, and was just satisfied when he finished it. Previously he couldn&#39;t eat as much as his father in a sitting, now he could put away 4 times as much.<br />
<br />
His mother came back and gave him several pills and a huge glass of water, &quot;Take your multivitamin and medicine and get dressed we need to get going.&quot; She walked off as if this was commonplace and Jeff decided not to question it.<br />
<br />
Once Jeff got to the doctor, the examination was similar to previous ones he had when he only had one penis. It was awkward but Jeff asked his mother to give him a moment alone with the doctor and asked some questions that were burning on his mind. &quot;So doctor, I am sure we already discussed this at length, but I&#39;d really appreciate a refresher, at length about whats going on with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor stared perplexed by the vagueness of the question. Clearly he had multiple penises his whole life and had issues explained to him plainly as they arose, in the reality he didn&#39;t remember.<br />
<br />
&quot;So my family isn&#39;t going bald, but I am. Why?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, well, male pattern baldness happens when your hair is sensitive to DHT, the thing testosterone can turn into in your body. Not your situation. Or, when your body is flooded with DHT because its flooded with testosterone, this is your situation. Diseases and disorders can cause it but we have ruled that out in your case. This is why we are giving you the puberty blocker pills.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re blocking my puberty?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Trying and failing...&quot; The doctor was surprised by your reaction, it was as though you were hearing all of this for the first time. He proceeded cautiously, &quot;Normally the body regulates hormone levels and balances everything within a range, this is controlled by the pituitary gland and determined by genetics. Men who lose one testicle usually don&#39;t need hormone replacement as the remaining testicle makes up for the missing one by producing all the hormones the man needs. In most cases, the body compensates. In your case, however, your body is producing all the hormones a teen boy needs, from each pair of testes. Unmedicated, you will complete puberty within 2 months, which would finish closing your growth plates and you would be 5&#39;2&#39;&#39; for the rest of your life.&quot; <br />
<br />
5&#39;2&#39;&#39;? Jeff was previously on track to be 6&#39;2&#39;&#39; when he was an adult. &quot;How tall can I get?&quot; he asked cautiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;We may be able to slow your puberty down to allow you to grow another 3 to 4 inches but your body is new to science and dosing you properly is proving difficult. You should be having major growths spurts right now but your testosterone levels are closing your growth plates. And these are just the immediate side effects.&quot; The doctor leaned in concerned. &quot;You don&#39;t recall any of this?&quot;</p>
