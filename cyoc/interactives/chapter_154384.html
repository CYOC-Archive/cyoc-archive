<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The tapping came from the person seated behind him in math class. Kyle spun around to see...<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh?!&quot; Kyle felt his cheeks grow hot as his eyes landed once again on the most outstandingly attractive guy he had ever seen.<br />
<br />
Josh was smiling, and had one eyebrow raised quizzically. &quot;Why so loud in the bathroom earlier?&quot; he asked, &quot;Something on your mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh had been there?! He had heard??? This was so embarrassing! Why had he had to cum so loudly, Kyle asked himself internally. &quot;Because I&#39;m a noisy little slut, that&#39;s why,&quot; a voice answered inside his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; he stammered aloud in response to this unwelcome though. Josh laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, I didn&#39;t mean to embarrass you,&quot; the dreamy blonde said, flashing that smile of his, &quot;Just thought it was hot, alright?&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle could have melted at the words. He felt his huge member strain against his pants once more, despite having been so recently relieved. &quot;Oh, er, really? That&#39;s, er... I mean. Thanks?!&quot; He didn&#39;t know what to say.<br />
<br />
Josh laughed and gestured for Kyle to turn back around in his seat. &quot;You should turn around, class is about to start.&quot; But before even seconds had gone by, Kyle heard Josh&#39;s voice whispering from just behind his ear. &quot;And you should let me give you a ride home this afternoon. Coach gave us the day off from practice so I&#39;m all free.&quot;<br />
<br />
Had the curse allowed him to cum from anything other than anal, Kyle was positive he would have done so just then. Fortunately, however, his pants remained mess-free as class began.<br />
<br />
During the lesson, Kyle struggled to focus. His thoughts were fixated on Josh (whom he could swear he felt staring at him the whole time) and on the barely-perceptible changes to his own body that the curse had already accomplished. Kyle&#39;s hair, normally well-trimmed, kept getting in his eyes, causing him to have to flip it to the side every so often. Also, when he looked down he couldn&#39;t help but notice that his dick was not the only thing bigger about his body;. Even though he had always been a thin, lanky guy, his hips were now wide enough to just barely hang off either side of his chair. &quot;I bet my ass is looking a lot juicier now,&quot; he thought to himself. Indeed, it almost felt like he was sitting on a pillow.<br />
<br />
Kyle also couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that he was too over-dressed. His polo and jeans just felt so... excessive. At least the jeans were skinny jeans now, thanks to the expansion in his hips and thighs, but they still felt too baggy and homely. He unbuttoned every button of his polo, exposing as much of his chest to the air as possible. It didn&#39;t do much to cool him but it did, for some reason, make him feel slightly better nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Periodically, he would steal glances at Josh over shoulder when the teacher wasn&#39;t looking. Once, twice, a third time, Josh was always staring back with a look of lust in his eyes that filled Kyle&#39;s slutty heart with glee. &quot;He really wants to fuck me! Yay, I&#39;m going to get my ass filled with his meaty cock... I mean... NO! Ew, why would I want that?! I need to get rid of this curse quickly before this gets out of hand.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle immediately began scheming about when to corner Jen and force her to rescind the curse. He just needed to get her alone and talk some sense in her. That was all. But before that he needed to finish Math class. And before that he just needed one more glance at...<br />
<br />
Josh wasn&#39;t looking at him. &quot;What? Why???&quot; Josh was leaning over to whisper something to a guy friend of his nearby. Immediately, Kyle panicked. &quot;What if he doesn&#39;t want me anymore?&quot; He thought to himself, biting his lip worriedly. &quot;What if I&#39;m not slutty enough for him? What if the curse hasn&#39;t made me into a trappy fucktoy fast enough?&quot; He had to do something fast.<br />
<br />
Before he could talk himself out of it, Kyle flung his pencil across the floor and immediately leaped from his seat to go pick it up. He sashayed his newly-enlarged hips as he crossed the floor, and bent down in such a way that would best showcase his plump ass. <br />
<br />
Once he was bent over double (and could see with satisfaction that Josh and most of the class were staring at his ass, mouth agape), Kyle gave an over-dramatic, &quot;Oopsie,&quot; and picked up his pencil before prancing back to his seat. <br />
<br />
Before long, he heard another whisper from just behind him. &quot;I&#39;m getting a piece of that after class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle gave a little dance of excitement in his chair. With a smile of contentment he pushed his chin-length hair behind his ears and tried his best to pretend to be paying attention to the lesson.</p>
