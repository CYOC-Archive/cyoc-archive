<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power – Peter’s Birthday Present – by scriptboy (peter@powerfulboys.com) <br />
<br />
“Alright Allen, you got what you asked for” Peter said, as he wished for Allen to be able to make Peter’s powers work on himself whenever Allen wished for something to change about him. He knew that he could always undo a careless wish, so he saw no harm in this.<br />
<br />
“Hey I have to go to class!” Peter said, as he grabbed hold of his bag. “Thanks Peter, you won’t regret this! I’ll be watching out for you! Trust me!” Allen said.<br />
<br />
Just as Allen walked into his next class and sat down, Ty walked in and sat right next to him. “Hey Allen, I know what Peter did to you!” Allen turned towards Ty. “He gave me the power to transform him any way I want to!” Allen replied. “Well, almost” Ty responded, “You don’t have any power at all, except for when you make a wish about Peter, you are using Peter’s own power on to himself!”<br />
<br />
Allen looked at Ty with a surprise! “How do you know this?” Ty got close enough to Allen to whisper in his ear. “I have the same powers Peter has. But, we need to do something for him. Tomorrow is his sixteenth birthday, so come over to my house after school, okay?” Allen nodded, with a smile.<br />
<br />
The next day, Ty met Allen in front of school. Peter had already gone home, not suspecting that anyone had noticed that October 9th was his birthday! “Hey Allen, you know Ryan, that big muscular kid, right?” Ty asked Allen. “Yeah, the big, black boy! He’s huge! What are you going to do?”<br />
<br />
“Ryan is 20 feet tall and all muscle. So he is always the biggest guy around. Peter sometimes feels bad that he made Ryan that big, because it seems like Ryan is often all alone. I suggest we grow Peter just as big as Ryan, but only when Ryan is near him and when Ryan is awake! All other times, Peter is normal, just like us!” Ty responded. “But it takes a lot of power to grow Peter that big and muscular, so we need to join forces and do it together! Do you want to do that?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah! How are we gonna do this?” Allen asked him. “As soon as we get home, I’m going to make Peter and Ryan fall asleep. Then we cast the spell on Peter. Afterwards, we wake him up. Then we test it by waking up Ryan, and we’ll get to watch Peter grow exactly as big and as tall as Ryan!” Ty and Allen high-fived each other and they slowed down as they approached the house.<br />
<br />
Ty concentrated on his two roommates. Ryan was already taking a nap, but Peter was doing homework. Suddenly, Peter became sleepy and crawled on the bed, and he immediately dozed off. Ty and Allen walked into his room, and Ty wished for Peter not to wake up until he said so. <br />
<br />
Then Ty and Allen grabbed each others hands. Ty told Allen to close his eyes, and Ty turned towards Peter, who was asleep on the bed, and began to concentrate on his cousin. He wished for Peter to grow as big and as muscular as Ryan, but only when Ryan was awake and when Peter was within 20 yards of Ryan. All other times, Peter would be like his normal self! The spell would last for ten days from that moment on!<br />
<br />
Then Allen and Ty went to Ryan’s room. Ty decided to surprise Ryan first and to fill him in on the birthday “gift” for Peter. Ty woke up Ryan, and the huge muscle boy woke up, rubbing his eyes after having taken a long nap.<br />
<br />
“Hey Ty! How are you?” Ryan said, still feeling sleepy. “Ryan, this is Allen! He is on the swim team with Peter!” Ty said, as he introduced Allen to Ryan. “Oh wow! Aren’t you the best swimmer on the team? Peter told me about you.” Ryan responded excitedly.<br />
<br />
“Ryan, I need to tell you something about Peter!” Ty whispered to Ryan. Ryan began to get really concerned. “Is he alright? He’s not in any kind of trouble, is he? Is he in his room? Let me go check up on him…” Ryan said, almost panicking out loud.<br />
<br />
“Peter is alright, don’t worry. He’s asleep in his room. Now listen, I have a secret to tell you. Tomorrow is Peter’s sixteenth birthday! I saw a birthday card for him from his parents, and it congratulated him on his birthday, which is the 9th of October!”<br />
<br />
“Wow! So what shall we get him?” Ryan asked Ty, intimidating Allen with his 20 foot height and giant muscular build, as he stood up from his bed and towered over the two teenagers. “Nothing! We’re going to grow him just as big as you and he’ll be just as muscular, just like you!” Ty said, with a wide grin on his face. <br />
<br />
“Really!?” Oh Ty, you are the BEST!!! Does Peter know it yet??” Ryan asked him, almost jumping for joy! “No! I made Peter fall asleep. Are you ready to see him eye to eye? Now you won’t need to look down on him anymore!” Ty said out loud. “Alright, now I want Peter to wake up!” he wished out loud.<br />
<br />
Peter slowly opened his eyes. He looked at the clock to see what time it was. Then he got up and walked down the stairs to get a cup of water in the kitchen. He walked over to the living room when he felt his legs grow bigger and longer. “What the heck…?” he wondered, as his entire body began to expand! Not only was he growing taller, but his muscles were growing as well! He looked up and noticed the room was shrinking as his head and shoulders were rising up. His legs grew bigger and more muscular, and his chests inflated to the point where he began to resemble a muscle freak! <br />
<br />
His body continued to grow, as Peter found himself passing almost 10 feet in height, and he continued to grow even further. His chest was over three feet wide; his biceps were as big and as round as basketballs! “What’s going on here? I’m gigantic! I’m starting to look like…” he wondered, when Ryan walked in the door. Peter turned around and noticed that his growth had stopped. Peter looked straight ahead, and he saw Ryan at eye level! At first he thought that Ryan had shrunk, but then he noticed that Ty and Allen were 15 feet shorter than him, and they only came up to his knees! Ryan ran up to him and embraced the giant teenager. Then the held each other at arm’s length and they both began to laugh out loud! They were now the same size! <br />
<br />
“Happy Birthday, Peter!!” Allen, Ty and Ryan shouted, all at the same time! “This is your gift, Peter! We decided to grow you just as big and tall as Ryan, so now you two giants can go out and have some fun, as equal friends!” Ty explained, while looking up to Peter, who was now twenty feet tall!<br />
<br />
Peter stood there, and he was speechless. But when he looked in front of him and saw Ryan, he had already lost the battle of trying to hold back his tears of joy. Ryan walked up to him and opened the huge door to the house. Then both the muscular giant boys, while just wearing shorts and sandals on their giant feet, walked out to go to the lake. Peter enjoyed his new titanic size, and there was no doubt that Ryan was extremely delighted, now that Peter was the same size as him.<br />
