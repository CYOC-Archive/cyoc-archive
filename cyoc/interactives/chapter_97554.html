<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha sat quietly as Jenny sat nervously gripping herself. The young werefox looked like she had gotten over the worst of the surprise, but she was still didn&#39;t look entirely at ease with her new form. She watched calmly as Jenny&#39;s transformation began to &quot;time out.&quot; Yvette hadn&#39;t clawed her during the night and she transformed during the day. In this, between being sedated by the ambulance staff and coming out of the worst effects of the &quot;need&quot; to complete her transformation, Jenny was beginning to change back. Her fur receded into her skin, her muzzle flattened out and her nose separated from her mouth to become a rather cute button nose with soft lips. Her ears shrank and rounded as they slid down onto the sides of her head. Her claws shrank back and rounded into human fingernails, and underneath the blankets, Samantha guessed that her tail shrank back into her spine and her feet shorted into the normal human feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh... why... why am I still this big?!&quot; Jenny asked in surprise as she gripped the blanket to her and using it to cover her body the best she could. Samantha guessed that she was referring to the large mounds that rested on her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re all roughly that big,&quot; Akane gave a chuckle, &quot;to allow us to attract our loves to us. As a vixen, you are more voluptuous than most other female were species... though it is not by much. Every adult female were has the curves to hold a male&#39;s attention...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or another female for some of us,&quot; Samantha added, &quot;Though you won&#39;t have to worry about back pain or even breast cancer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have anything that&#39;ll fit me now,&quot; Jenny whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can arrange for allowing you to be fitted and new clothing provided, though for the most part you&#39;ll only need new bras...&quot; Samantha commented, &quot;unless your regular attire was deliberately cut to be tight on you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all of it,&quot; Jenny admitted, &quot;but... I can&#39;t simply be built... like this to seduce people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a side benefit,&quot; Akane commented, &quot;if you ever have children, you&#39;ll find them to be very hungry and frequently so...&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded as that was a theory she&#39;d heard plenty of times before, though for the most part the weres of Moon Lake never really got into figuring out those things. Jenny seemed to pause for a moment and might have even daydreamed something, which Samantha probably guessed was related to having children with Harry, if Akane was right and Jenny was was already bonding to Harry. After a moment, she looked to Samantha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will I really have to have sex with the one who turned me?&quot; Jenny asked, &quot;this female rogue... Yvette... and how do I know her name?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how you know the rogue&#39;s name... but normals when turned generally do instinctively know the name of the one they need to complete their transformation,&quot; Samantha sighed, &quot;though we do try to make sure that when normals join our society that it is entirely of their own free will and with someone that they already know personally. In many cases, the transformation, particularly when its of a sexual nature, is between those who are already in love with each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha thought of her first time with Frances when they were in high school and then the night that she and Frances turned Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I really have to have sex with her?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Samantha gave a heavy sigh, &quot;you can&#39;t avoid that... though we can&#39;t do anything in THAT regard until she is caught.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What will Harry say?&quot; Jenny asked as she looked down, though at the same time the door clicked open.<br />
<br />
&quot;That I&#39;d love you,&quot; came Harry&#39;s voice from the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harry!&quot; Jenny looked up, dropping the blanket, and smiling immediately at seeing Harry come back into the room.<br />
<br />
Harry came forward and was quick to hug her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re looking good, Jen,&quot; Harry said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure I am,&quot; Jenny answered, sounding slightly disbelieving.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are,&quot; Harry told her, &quot;and once your transformation is completed, you&#39;ll be fine and we can move forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t hate me?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; Harry hugged her tighter, &quot;and you&#39;ll find that being a were-beast isn&#39;t so bad. You&#39;ll find all sorts of perks and the fears you may have now will go away...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think so?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My family moved to Moon Lake and my older brother became our family&#39;s were,&quot; Harry told her, &quot;we know full well that things get better... and I&#39;ll help in any way I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Harry,&quot; Jenny smiled, closing her eyes and resting her head on Harry&#39;s shoulder, &quot;but... I don&#39;t know how much you can right now... a good part of me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your transformation is incomplete, I know,&quot; Harry nodded, &quot;but we can get through it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think so?&quot; Jenny asked, &quot;even after I got attacked and feel the need for a... for a... for a woman...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The rogue&#39;s previous victim has adapted well to being a werefox and has shown no signs of the rogue&#39;s problems,&quot; Samantha assured her, &quot;Once we can catch her and complete your transformation, you will be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime, there will be things we will need to take care of,&quot; Mayor Stovall spoke as he closed the door. He had let them have their moment, as seeing their love did bring joy to his heart. Just as he had seen that his future would always be with his wife and that his daughter loved Eric Anderson. He still remembered the night after the Andersons moved in and had their first day at school. Eric was the only thing that Julie had talked about all through dinner, and Mayor Stovall remembered that feeling all too well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; Jenny asked nervously, wondering why the new arrival smelled like fish.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the most part trying to keep things calm until your transformation can be completed,&quot; Mayor Stovall spoke with an uneasy sigh, &quot;what was done to you was wrong, and the rogue who clawed you will be punished to the fullest extent of our laws for clawing you and forcing the transformation of another normal who had just moved here with his family... but until your transformation can be completed... I&#39;m afraid we cannot have you on the loose. In that state to complete your transformation, you could accidentally transform others or hurt yourself. We can&#39;t have that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not going to put me in jail?&quot; Jenny asked, clutching Harry to her, &quot;Are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Mayor Stovall answered, &quot;hopefully we can catch the rogue before the sun sets tonight... and we can arrange for you to complete your transformation... but if not... I&#39;m afraid we have to make sure you don&#39;t hurt or infect anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what will you do?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are only two real options available to you,&quot; Mayor Stovall said slowly, &quot;One is that the hospital, college, and the city have &quot;safe rooms&quot; for this very purpose. I can put you in contact you with the Dean and he can escort you to the safe room on the campus... or I can contact the police chief and he can show you to the town&#39;s safe room... or we could talk with the hospital and you could use their safe room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do they work?&quot; Jenny asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;The safe rooms are essentially an apartment that is built to hold a fully transformed were of any species through the night,&quot; Mayor Stovall said slowly, &quot;the decor is rather spartan, I&#39;m afraid, but they are better than a jail cell. The door&#39;s locks are electronic. They&#39;ll lock automatically at dusk and won&#39;t unlock until dawn. It would hold you and leave you to your own devices until the sun rises again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What else is there?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The other is to have you stay with a single male member of the Skulk here in Moon Lake,&quot; Mayor Stovall answered, &quot;that male will already be a werefox and could attend to your physical needs and because he is a werefox you cannot infect him and will be at least content to have his attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though we would also need to make sure that you&#39;ve been given a prescription for birth control pills that are focused on your new hormonal patterns,&quot; Samantha commented, &quot;as female weres... we are HIGHLY fertile. And since you have just changed... you will actually begin to go into heat as your body continues to adapt to a new reproductive pattern. Without those pills... you could very easily find yourself pregnant...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny only shuddered, &quot;I only want Harry to father my kits!&quot;<br />
<br />
She then paused, and wondered to herself where THAT came from. Was this that bond that Akane Tachibana mentioned... Jenny really didn&#39;t know. Harry only blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hence the prescription for the pills,&quot; Samantha finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would I really need to be with someone...?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is the option that would work outside of one of the safe rooms,&quot; Mayor Stovall told her, trying his best to hide his frustration at Yvette&#39;s actions, &quot;and I&#39;m sorry if things seem harsh... it&#39;s just that much of these measures were arranged as a just in case measure. We&#39;ve generally not had these sorts of problems that often before. They can and do happen... but it&#39;s like a one in a million odds...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you catch her?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can arrange for the two of you to complete your transformation as quickly as possible and you and Harry will have plenty of time to finish things,&quot; Mayor Stovall spoke, &quot;You could decide to move here to Moon Lake. You could continue to attend college here and return home during the Summer. Or you could simply drop out and go home. That is all entirely up to you, and we will do all we can to help you with regards to whatever decision you make.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how would that work?&quot; Jenny asked nervously, &quot;I&#39;m not into girls...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While you&#39;re looking to complete your transformation, that won&#39;t matter,&quot; Samantha told her, thinking of William&#39;s actions and threats while he was wanting to complete his transformation, &quot;your mind will desire it to feel whole. How and where your transformation is up to you... though you might need to coordinate things with the police as they will want to make sure that the rogue doesn&#39;t use your completing your transformation as an excuse to escape again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we will be in contact with Harry, who has volunteered to help you as much as he can before the sun sets,&quot; Mayor Stovall answered, &quot;He can then update you on our progress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would do all that for me?!&quot; Jenny asked to Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do love you, Jenny,&quot; Harry answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jenny spoke with a smile, &quot;though I think... for tonight at least... I&#39;d prefer to stay at the hospital&#39;s safe room. Harry can get some of my extra clothes... my roommate knows him. And we can go from there. I can deal with the college&#39;s option on Monday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Mayor Stovall nodded.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Fifteen minutes later, Mayor Stovall and Samantha slowly made their way out. They had left their phone numbers with Jenny in case she had more questions or anything she wished to share. Akane left a business card which had all of the Skulk&#39;s contact numbers on it before quietly leaving and beginning to walk calmly toward her own home. Though, while things had gone well, neither could say they were good. Jenny still seemed to be adapting and seemed to be struck between frightened of herself and desperate to Harry stay with her forever.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to catch her,&quot; Mayor Stovall spoke as they came out of the hospital, squinting slightly as they came out into the afternoon sun.<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; Samantha nodded, &quot;but you and I both know that this will take time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You saw her in there,&quot; Mayor Stovall answered, &quot;she&#39;s not comfortable with the idea of having lesbian sex and still seems rather nervous with regard to being a were...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Samantha nodded as the two of them approached their cars, &quot;and that is typical for these sorts of things... it&#39;s why forcing a transformation is the second worst crime in Moon Lake after murder. But the fact remains that Yvette has committed the crime. The best we can do is let the police continue to hunt her down... and stay alert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how will THAT work with a new family moving in tomorrow?&quot; Mayor Stovall answered, &quot;the one that&#39;s been pursued by some perverted mobster... Having them move in with a rogue were still on the streets with a new family moving in will only make things worse...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They will have to be told about Moon Lake and given the option of becoming a were,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;that will happen regardless of whether or not Yvette is still on the loose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d rather not have her on the loose,&quot; Mayor Stovall answered, &quot;and I&#39;ve had the police chief get in touch with the city court... We&#39;ll get a warrant for her apartment near the college. Once there, we&#39;ll get samples that hold her scent and have them spread through the city to give everyone a chance to familiarize themselves with Yvette&#39;s scent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha didn&#39;t like the way this was going.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t possibly mean the WERE alert, sir?&quot; Samantha said slowly, &quot;not every were is police trained... and to be honest, with the anger the College Dean has right now, he&#39;s liable to KILL her if he finds her... and as her first victim, I wouldn&#39;t put William Anderson above trying to kill her... and that won&#39;t help Jenny at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Each team would have an officer to assist them,&quot; Mayor Stovall answered, &quot;and with the entire were population actively hunting her and knowing what to look and smell for... we can be assured a rapid capture.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could still lead us into more trouble, sir,&quot; Samantha said nervously, &quot;I don&#39;t like anything that Yvette Smith has done in all of this... but the WERE alert could only cause more trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We also can&#39;t have a rogue were running around the area infecting people to throw us off her trail,&quot; Mayor Stovall answered firmly, &quot;especially with another Normal family moving in. Unless the police report that they&#39;re closing in on her... I expect the warrant by four PM and will issue the WERE alert at four forty five.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha only sighed heavily. She fully understood where the mayor was coming from to confront a rogue were, which the WERE alert was designed to counter. Once made, all Moon Lake normals were to return to their dorm room, apartment, or home and are to remain inside until dawn. The police would then take various sectors of Moon Lake and would gather every were in that sector. At dusk, they were all to change and begin to actively hunt the rogue were. The hunt would then go through the night with the intent of having the numbers to not only find the rogue but pin the rogue&#39;s location down in one area where the rogue could either be subdued or killed. <br />
<br />
There were exceptions, but they didn&#39;t leave for much. Mothers of young children were exempt. Were children who had only had their first transformation that year were exempt, normal humans who had become weres could not take this exemption, even if their transformation was recent. If a family still had normal members that didn&#39;t become weres, one parent was exempt. The elderly were exempt. Any pregnant female was exempt. But beyond that, EVERY were had to join the hunt to make sure that rogue was caught, and it would mean she, Frances, and Ben would have to join the hunt. Nate would have to join the hunt. William or Martha could have an exemption to protect Eric, but that would only apply to one of them and the other would have to join the hunt.<br />
<br />
To Samantha, the WERE alert was a desperation move, and while she could understand the mayor&#39;s reasoning, she personally didn&#39;t feel the alert was the wisest course of action. Neither she nor Frances were police trained and it was doubtful that many of the weres in their part of Moon Lake were either. They could potentially mistake the scent of any werefox vixen who had family ties to Yvette for Yvette, and the fact that the records regarding Yvette&#39;s family were so sparse that that possibility was higher. She also knew that a newly transformed were like Nate could easily not know just how powerful he was physically now, and if Nate were to accidentally kill Yvette without knowing his own strength, helping Jenny would be out the window. The same would be true with William or the College Dean. They might be too angry with Yvette and would let personal anger drive them into making a mistake.<br />
<br />
It might mean some extra warnings, but Samantha found it better to let the police handle the hunt and capture of Yvette, particularly as while her actions were dishonorable and shameful for any were, regardless of what kind of were they were, they weren&#39;t excessively violent that had left people dead. It was that sort of incident that the WERE alert had been created for, and to Samantha&#39;s knowledge, Moon Lake had only used it ONCE before, and that was shortly after the founding of the town. Ironically enough, not to deal with a lunatic were, but a human trapper that had gone insane after being alone in the mountains for too long. She only hoped that Yvette could be taught and wondered how she would explain this to Frances. Especially as they only had an hour before the alert would be issued unless something changed.</p>
