<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the chamberlock closed, Rich sat down on the chair on the inside. It was impressive just how roomy the inside of the machine felt compared to the outside. The chair was comfortable as he sat his ass down on it, and planted his feet firmly on the ground, waiting for something to happen.<br />
<br />
And he waited, and he waited, and he waited, as several minutes passed with nothing happening. Figuring that something may have been broken, Rich got up and tapped on the glass of The Chamber door, trying to get James’ attention. But what shocked him was not only that there was no response, but that there was James on the other side, standing completely still. He rapped on the door again, harder this time, “James this isn’t funny!” he exclaimed, but there was no response. Well, duh, he figured, this was a chamberlock after all.<br />
<br />
He figured that there must have been an error, so he sat back down on the chair. It felt so comfortable, for some reason, as The Chamber started to heat up, warming Rich up. Well, if he was going to be trapped, he would at least be doing so in comfort, he figured.<br />
<br />
He didn’t know how long it was before he really started to get bored. Was it 30 minutes? 6 hours? 2 days? He didn’t have a watch, and he didn’t bring his phone in, and the frozen picture of the outside was really warping his perception of time – there was nothing to track it with. He found himself wishing he had something to do to stave off the boredom.<br />
<br />
As if in a response to grant his wish, he felt his cock starting to get stiff sitting in the chair as the heat in the room started to warm him up again. “Whew..” he breathed heavily, as he started to sweat. “This is really gross..” he muttered, feeling a small zap in his head after the thought. That was.. odd. He did figure this thing was scanning him, maybe he was overheated?<br />
<br />
In response, Rich decided the best course of action was to strip out of his clothes. He didn’t realize that his mental pathways were beginning to be shaped by The Chamber already, and one of the most important things to do right away was get him comfortable with the idea of being naked, and the idea of changing. He’d be a very sweaty man from now on, and The Chamber wanted to keep him warm, so that he would embrace that.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t long before his cock was at full mass, and horny thoughts were flooding his mind. He was thinking of his sexual conquests, various women he’d made out with and fondled and fucked. His head was lost in lust, but for some reason he could not bring himself to cum – it was like something was wrong.<br />
<br />
The horniness came and went in waves, as Rich’s stay in The Chamber reached a couple of weeks inside of it. Rich had long given up on trying to leave at this point, realizing he was entirely at the whim of whatever was on the outside, despite James never having moved once. He wondered if it was a picture on the other side, rather than a glass door. No amount of pounding on the door had done anything, and he was starting to find peace with it.<br />
<br />
<i>A good daddy is patient.</i><br />
<br />
Rich blinked. Where in the world had that came from? Maybe he was going insane in here. From staying in here... however long he had. He had stopped even trying to track days ago, not having any idea of how much time was left inside the chamber. The machine had to have been broken, he figured, but he was completely wrong.<br />
<br />
At some point, his clothing had entirely disappeared from the floor, leaving him entirely naked and with nothing to wear. At first, Rich had panicked upon realizing this, despite not knowing how long they were gone for. He came to realize though, that he quite liked being naked, and that he didn’t have much control over his situation anyway. At least it was warm in the room.<br />
<br />
Being naked had also given him plenty of time to explore his body. Being stuck in a state of limbo with no real time perception made one year feel like a much shorter amount of time, especially because the reality bubble he was in didn’t require him to eat, drink, sleep, or use the bathroom. He had no timeframe for when the chest hair had appeared. He knew that one moment there was a circular set of hairs in the center of his chest, and it didn’t take long, in his own perception of time, before they started spreading across his chest and his pecs into a deep, dark forest of hairs.<br />
<br />
<i>And it’s so nice to rub your hairy chest, and to show it off.</i><br />
<br />
Having so much time on his hands gave Rich a newfound appreciation for playing with his nipples. They were so sensual, and the fact that they were warm and sweaty all the time from the heat of the chamber made his cock throb. This was different than playing with women’s breasts. <i>It’s better than playing with women’s breasts.</i> He found himself agreeing, as The Chamber’s forced thoughts became indistinguishable from his own.<br />
<br />
At some point, the hair growth had spread up his neck and down his stomach, but more importantly, outward to his arms. Each day, his armpit hair got thicker and hairier, large bushes of hair forming tufts of thick, swirly hair under his pits. At first, Rich found himself repulsed, but <i>it was manly to have thick armpit hair</i> he found himself thinking, <i>and it smelled great too</i>. The heat of the room was making him sweat nearly constantly, which made his armpits reek, but as the scent of the room started to get to him, Rich decided to confront his fears and put his nose right into his pit, confirming his armpits were the source of the stench.<br />
<br />
<i>And it smelled AMAZING.</i> Whew, did it ever. The first cautious sniff turned into several deep huffs as he tried to get his nose as close as possible to the source, his cock stiffening yet again. <i>My boy would love this.</i> The idle thought crossed his mind unchallenged as he continued his deep self love for an indiscernible amount of time.<br />
<br />
The trail of hair continued travelling all over his body, covering his arms, legs, and butt in soft fuzzy dark hairs, and a thick pubic thatch of hair followed as well. Rich idly spent a lot of time running his fingers through it as he waited for James to do something, still standing outside the room, frozen.<br />
<br />
<i>I bet he’d love to run his hands all over my hairy body.</i><br />
<br />
Rich froze, a cold shiver going down his spine despite the warmness of the room. He didn’t. Want. James to do that. Absolutely not. James had trapped him in this room, for what felt like eternity. Even if it wasn’t eternity? It could’ve only been five minutes. He didn’t think he was this hairy when he entered the room, right? Only a little hairy, he told himself.<br />
<br />
And even if it wasn’t long, James still was making it feel like a long time. There was no way that James was going to get to feel all this sexy, manly body hair. <i>Not yet.</i><br />
<br />
The march of time inside the chamber was taking a strange effect on Rich’s body as he approached the ten year mark. Some changes were much more subtle, from natural progression. His muscles had kept themselves up, but he was starting to gain the beginnings of a thick ball musclegut at the same time. Others were.. still subtle, but wouldn’t have happened naturally, like the hair growth, and the receding of the hair on Rich’s head. The Chamber was stealing his natural attributes and replacing them with the perfect ones specified by James, while comforting Rich that it was all natural, and that it’s normal for men approaching middle age to lose their head hair, especially hirsute ones like himself.<br />
<br />
<i>And besides, it makes you a sexier daddy anyway.</i><br />
<br />
Rich’s cock twinged at that. He had been so horny, with no release during his entire time in the chamber. He had long since given up on picturing women, they weren’t doing anything for him, but The Chamber had its work cut out for it in turning him gay. For now, Rich was trying to get off to muscle and hair worship, having figures rub their hands and stick their noses over his body. <i>It makes you feel powerful.</i><br />
<br />
He was also losing a grip on his personality, as The Chamber ate away at it, replacing things like his favorite things, and his memories of growing up. To match the time change on the outside, new memories were being implanted in his mind of growing up in an earlier time, nostalgia for things he’d never played with as a kid, and sexual experiences that he’d never actually had. Reality would simply take a couple of hours to adjust worldwide, so it was no problem for the capabilities of The Chamber.<br />
<br />
Rich spent most of his time in a stupor, somewhere between trying hard to masturbate to fuzzy thoughts, which were becoming increasingly male and gay, and between stewing at James for how awful this experience is. As his testosterone continued to boost, his temper continued to shorten, and he was thinking of how he was going to beat the living shit out of that man once he got out.<br />
<br />
<i>But you’d never want to do that to James.</i> Fuck that, Rich thought, continuing to resist the thought. He’d persevere against these weird brainwaves, ironically accepting everything else with on resistance.<br />
<br />
Time pressed on, the years piling on and reaching the 20 year mark as his beard finally came in, full and thick, his mustache growing right under his nose and curling just over his upper lip, connecting with the thick beard which went far up his chin and connected his thick fuzzy neck hair. He stroked his hard cock with one hand as he rubbed his soft, thick beard with the other. <i>James will love this.</i> Mmm. Yeah, he will.<br />
<br />
The final stretch of time had Rich’s body and mind as practically putty, as The Chamber slowly shrank him to 5’5 over a few years, and increased the size of his hands and feet, making his gut bigger while the rest of his muscles grew massive. The perfect body chemistry was through him now to sustain this figure, and the mentality was engrained in him of how to work out effectively to keep it this way.<br />
<br />
It was the last few years in which the body hair started turning a stark white, starting from that same circle in his chest so many years ago and making its way across the entire body.  When he first saw it, Rich was fearful – he didn’t want to be old! <i>But I am old. I’m a hot fucking silver daddy. Woof.</i><br />
<br />
He had no choice but to embrace the thought stream as his own, everything The Chamber told him was true – his only holdout of resistance was how angry he was at James for.. whatever he did to put him in here. Truth be told, he couldn’t remember. It felt like so long ago, but he also didn’t care.<br />
<br />
As the timer reached its near end, Rich found clothing on the floor that he knew was his. A worn jockstrap that he took a good sniff of, dirty damp wool work socks that he took a long huff of, his scent making him so horny. <i>He loved making his boy sniff those things and watching him get off to it.</i> A flannel shirt with the sleeves ripped off, that he threw on without buttoning up, and a dirty old pair of jeans, complete with a leather belt and a huge buckle. A big pair of cowboy boots finished the set.<br />
<br />
Rich was overwhelmed with horny impulses after getting dressed, and started to paw at his cock through his jeans. He needed a man to come and service him, to undress him and lick his sweaty pits, then fish his cock out of those jeans and jockstrap and give him a good blowjob before Rich flipped the guy over and fucked him raw. It was making him so horny just thinking about it.. <i>No, you don’t need a man. You need a boy.</i><br />
<br />
He needed a boy..<br />
<br />
He needed <i>his boy.</i><br />
<br />
The thought was enough to end his 30 year dry spell as his hips rocked and he blew an enormous load of daddy spunk into his jockstrap, cementing his body and mind of that of a gay kinkster.<br />
<br />
He blinked, mind renewed, as the chamber door opened, finally. He saw James on the other side, and his brow furrowed as James gasped.<br />
<br />
He was going to fucking kill him for how long that took. Whatever.. that was. He paused, as he stared at James and his heart started to melt. He was just so.. perfect, Rich thought, as James was undoubtedly thinking the same thing<br />
<br />
His mind tried to fight back. He was SO mad at James, but he was quickly losing his grip on why, as the thoughts of his boy started to surface, the power of madly falling in love quickly replacing 30 years of resistance, as if it were nothing.<br />
<br />
And suddenly, it was no more, as Rich rapidly approached James, reality quickly warping between them to make them a couple. “My boy..” Rich said, enveloping James in a sweaty hug and feeling James’ erection through his jeans. “You must’ve missed me very much.”<br />
<br />
“It was only a couple of minutes you were in there..” James responded, “But yes, I did.. Daddy.”<br />
<br />
Simply hearing that one word warmed Rich’s heart.</p>
