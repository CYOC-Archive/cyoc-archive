<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The suggestions shot like fireworks. The Ringmaster beamed. All proposals had some merit but were rather straightforward and routine, like making them act like chicken, make them do impossible feats or have them act naughty babies. Then someone shouted &quot;Make them at act like donkeys! Like goats!&quot; All thought his limits were making people act like something and not be something. But they would all be duly impressed when they got a view of his actual magical powers. Yet the notion of goats made the Ringmaster think a satyrs and from that he thought about mythology. Yes! That would be sure to make all gasp in awe!<br />
&quot;Very well! Very well!&quot; he boomed. &quot;I have chosen what to do with our good volunteers! I am sure you&#39;ll be surprised, though in the end love the result even if it was not your own idea!&quot;<br />
He turned to Tayla.<br />
&quot;Hello, my dear. You do like the circus, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; she said softly. <br />
&quot;I am sure you love the equestrian performances, do you not? The wonderful, graceful horses? Do you adore them? Do they make your heart beat like a drum?&quot; he asked amiably.<br />
Tayla nodded eagerly.<br />
&quot;Now, how would you like to be both the graceful, magnificent performer and the slender, admirable horse at the same time? To be beautiful, admired and to bring stars in the eyes of all those that behold your sight?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yes! Please!&quot; exclaimed Tayla, with no need to be enthralled by the mere idea that caught her heart and desire with no effort.<br />
The Ringmaster smiled. Oh, that was just too easy! Just pinpoint something that the victim already loves and the transformation becomes willing and so, so much smoother! Requires a bit of psychology, of course, but once the victim is willing to imagine himself as what the hypnotist wants them to be, the rest goes smoothly and with incredibly more ease, cementing further the changes to be imposed. <br />
&quot;So listen to me for that dream to come true, my dear. I am your carer, your tender carer. I say how things are. For your dream to come true, you have to listen to my voice, only my voice, and obey me and solely me. Understand? But it&#39;s for you good, only your own good. You know I would let no one harm you. No one and nothing. Your dream is within reach, but it is only at this condition. So look at the ball and let me guide you. I am here for you and will see, it is easy, oh so easy.&quot;<br />
Tayla smiled and nodded. The voice of the man was so nice, so caressing, of course it meant he had only her best interest at heart. How could it not be so? And he promised her to become something so beautiful... How could she refuse, especially when all she had to do was just listen to the soothing voice of the nice man? If he was her master, then he must be good and caring and know what to do. He was the one in charge of her, after all.<br />
&quot;Now Tayla, you are a centaur. Slender and fast and graceful. You love performing tricks for the audience. You prance, you dance, you rear and you do tricks. You are also incredibly beautiful. All men are amazed at your body and all women want to be you. And all little girls want to ride you, brush you and be like you when they grow up too, of course,&quot; he explains slowly.<br />
For Tayla, it was amazingly pleasant. Heavenly blissful. Her master was so kind, making her the envy and wonder of so many! Of course she&#39;d obey him! She&#39;d obey his every order as a token of her deep gratitude! Sensing her full submissiveness to his will, the Ringmaster cracked a whip to the side and a puff of smile appeared. When it cleared, Tayla was gone, replaced by a most incredible creature. A beautiful centaur with a white equine body, slim and graceful. Her tail is braided with pink bows and Tayla herself has changed. It is still her, yet with poutier lips, bigger eyes and less body fat. Her hair is longer and cascades down her back in wild yet ordered locks. She sports ribbons in her hair, blue and pink, as well as a diamond tiara. As this show isn&#39;t for adult only, the Ringmaster felt obligated to add a bra covering her tiny chest. People could be so prude... The audience was aghast, but it was just the beginning. He cracked his whip to the side yet again and Tayla sidestepped with her hooves, bowed down, reared, danced as if all required no efforts and trotted around the scene. Everyone clapped, enchanted by all of this. The Ringmaster brought back Tayla to his side and went up to Jared. He knew perfectly what he was to become. Still entranced by the silver ball, he spoke softly to him. This was going to be even easier than with the girl.<br />
&quot;Jared, listen to me. Do you love the circus now?&quot;<br />
No,&quot; mumbled the teen.<br />
Well, the subjects could not lie so there was nothing to do about it. Except expecting such an answer and use it against this stupid and annoying youngster. <br />
&quot;No wonder,&quot;chuckled the Ringmaster. &quot;You are a teen. And a teen scorns those childish things. Naturally. What are you interested in, if not the circus?&quot;<br />
&quot;Video games. TV. Parties. And... And...&quot;<br />
The Ringmaster knew what was coming. That was precisely the point.<br />
&quot;Now, now, no need to be ashamed.  I am your friend, am I not? You can hear at my voice that I am very, very understanding. Let me guess. Girls? Sex?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; said Jared. &quot;I like girls! Boobies! Sex!&quot;<br />
Good thing the exchange was very low. The Ringmaster had expected something of that kind, after all. <br />
&quot;Of course, of course. Only natural for a strapping young man such as yourself,&quot; he agreed, patting the head of the ten in a paternal way.<br />
Ah, light touches. Didn&#39;t they work wonders? <br />
&quot;And you know who likes sex and bosoms? Satyrs! Would you like to be a satyr?&quot;<br />
Jared seemed to ponder, even in his hypnotised state.<br />
&quot;I... I...&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;d get to touch all the buttocks you&#39;d like. And copulate all day long. And drink wine. And live for sex and only sex. And see bare breats all the time,&quot; whispered the man in his ear peevishly. <br />
At this, Jared&#39;s eyes lit up.<br />
&quot;Yeah! I want to be a satyr! I want to be a satyr!&quot;<br />
&quot;All right, all right,&quot; laughed the Ringmaster. &quot;Just listen to my voice and obey me. Do you think you can do that?&quot;<br />
The teenager nodded, a goofy smile plastered on his face as he imagined the orgies his brain soaking in testosterones and pheromones made up feverishly and indulging in its owner&#39;s fantasies. He gazed at the ball, completely under the control of the Ringmaster, and rather willingly so.<br />
&quot;Jared, you are a satyr. A satyr, do you understand? You revel in wine and the company of women, may hey be nymphs, satyrs, nymphs, centaurs or other humanoid creatures. You live to spread you love of alcoholic drinks and love-making. You love having sex but you also love doing merry-making and partying. You love partying all night long with friends and girls and experimenting with sexual practices. You love being a satyr. Life is good and always pleasurable as a satyr. You know you want to be a satyr because you are completely made for that. You see no problem in being one and know how to act like one.&quot;<br />
The teen nodded fervently and bleated like a goat. The public hadn&#39;t heard their conversation because of age restrictions but laughed greatly at that and with a puff of green smoke, everyone saw a new vision of the sulky teen. He was much shorter, with a big fat belly typical of convivial people, with more body hair. On top of his head two goat horns protruded and most extraordinary, his lower body was that of a dark brown goat, complete with cloven hooves! And it was not over! He turned around and showed off his tiny tufted tail, shaking it proudly. Then he drank from a goblet on a table which appeared thanks to a puff of white smoke and he munched on pears and nuts, then throwing candy to everyone in the audience, who cheered. He then danced for everyone. He was certainly not sulky anymore!<br />
&quot;Perfect! Now let&#39;s have our two lovebirds meet!&quot; said the Ringmaster, snapping his fingers.<br />
Jared and Tayla saw each other but now in their own mind space, they did not recognise one another. On the contrary, seeing a satyr in front of her, Tayla shrieked and fled as fast as her hooves could carry her. As for Jared, of course he wanted to know her carnally, mount her and fondle her breasts. He dashed after her on his cloven hooves. The Ringmaster had had he good initiative to add a loincloth to the new satyr so as to cover the bulge that was starting to appear. His erection and giant penis, as well as his humongous testicles were not appropriate a sight for the children. No doubt the adults would notice, though. Yet as the two creatures went round and round the scene as the audience laughed, the Ringmaster cracked his whip one last time. Everything vanished in its usual puff of smoke. In the center, Tayla and Jared saluted the public and went back to their seats, waving enthusiastically. These soulless clones would disappear one night, after a few days of existence. The real teens were in separate cages, asleep. Tayla was lying down in hay while Jared was snoring in his, booth still transformed. They would make great additions to the circus. Jared could do special adults-only representations. The Ringmaster was already thinking of the skilful performances they could both do.</p>
