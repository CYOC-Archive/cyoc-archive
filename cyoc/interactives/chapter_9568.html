<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Coach Jordan McKenzie, the high school men’s basketball coach walked in to the boys’ locker room and found Ty and the newly improved Ian standing there.<br />
<br />
“Well, guys, what have we here? Ian? Is that you?” the Coach said, as he admired Ian, since he was looking bigger and more muscular than before.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Coach… it’s me!” Ian said, with Ty chuckling behind him.<br />
<br />
“Well, Ian, I must say that you look different…” the Coach responded, while walking around the student and admiring his awesome physique. “Have you been working out?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Coach…” Ian responded, not exactly knowing what else to say.<br />
<br />
“Well, if you ever decide to join the basketball team, please don’t hesitate to call me, okay?” Coach McKenzie answered with a smile.<br />
<br />
“I guess I had a recent growth spurt, Coach…” Ian said. Ty had to cover his mouth with his hand for he almost couldn’t stop himself from laughing.<br />
<br />
“Alright, gentlemen… Please, carry on!” the Coach said. He opened one of the lockers and placed his stopwatch and whistle in it, then he locked it with a key and walked out of the locker room.<br />
<br />
Finally, the two boys were alone again. <br />
<br />
“Ty, this is awesome! I look and feel great! Can you do this to anybody?” Ian asked, while flexing his muscular arms.<br />
<br />
“Whoever you want, Ian!” Ty replied, wiping the tears of laughter from his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Ty, please, I need to ask you a huge favor! Please do this for me!” Ian pleaded with Ty.<br />
<br />
“Well, what do you want me to do for you?” Ty asked him, as both boys walked out of the locker room after Ian got dressed in his clothes.<br />
<br />
“One of my buddies in History class needs some muscle. His name is Sebastian, he’s very nice, but he’s the biggest nerd in the school! And he gets picked on by every jock in the school! You’ve gotta help him!” Ian replied.<br />
<br />
“Isn’t he the guy who won the Math Club competition? He’s a little, skinny guy with red hair and glasses, right?” Ty wondered out loud while trying to picture who this kid was.<br />
<br />
“Exactly! That’s him! Ty, if you could blow him up, I’d be extremely grateful…” Ian said to Ty, becoming even more excited at the thought of turning this really geeky kid into a jock.<br />
<br />
“Where will we find him now?” Ty asked Ian. Ian pondered it for a moment.<br />
<br />
“He’s in the library! We’ll find him there for sure!” Ian said excitedly, as he snapped his fingers when the thought struck him. Both Ian and Ty walked down the hall to the library. They quietly opened the door and walked in. Ian led the way towards the math section, where they found a short, red head kid with glasses sitting at a table all alone, with a pile of math and chemistry books in front of him.<br />
<br />
“That’s him! Great, he’s all alone, Ty! What do you think? Can you change him?” Ian whispered in Ty’s ear, so that Sebastian wouldn’t hear them.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah… I would love to grow some muscle on the little guy! How big do you want him to be?” Ty asked his buddy in a soft voice.<br />
<br />
“Ty, it hurts me tremendously to see how much he gets picked on. That’s why he’s always alone and he never talks to anybody! And let me tell you something, he’ll be the best math tutor you could ever ask for! So Ty, make him massive! Blow him up!” Ian said with a smile.<br />
<br />
“One geeky muscle boy, coming up!” Ty said, rubbing his hands together. “Oh man, I LOVE this! Okay Sebastian, freeze!” Immediately Sebastian stopped reading his book and appeared to be frozen.<br />
<br />
“Get up off the chair and walk over here and stand right in front of me” Ty commanded.<br />
<br />
The boy slowly got up and walked over to where Ty and Ian were standing. Ty was able to get a good look at him. He had a friendly face, he was about 180 pounds, he was 5’4” tall and he was skinny and pale. He had short, red hair and he wore a thick pair of reading glasses. With skinny legs and arms, Ty had his work cut out for him. <br />
<br />
“Okay, let’s take the clothes off and leave him with a very flexible Speedo!” Ty said next. The clothes and shoes disappeared and reappeared on the table. Sebastian was left only wearing a black Speedo.<br />
<br />
“Now, grow another 24 inches taller, Sebastian!” Ty commanded. The boy started growing taller and taller while his torso and legs grew bigger and longer. His arms grew longer too, the growth stopped when the boy reached 7’4” in height, making him taller than both Ty and Ian.<br />
<br />
“Alright! Now, let’s add another eigthty pounds of pure, solid muscle!” Ty commanded next. Ian and Ty both grinned as they watched the skinny, geeky kid slowly transform into an incredible athlete right before their eyes. <br />
<br />
Sebastian’s calves became as thick and as round as footballs, almost ripping out of his legs. His quads gained several inches of muscle, and veins began to surface over his skin while the muscle hardened and his legs became like oak trees. <br />
<br />
His entire upper body became several inches wider as his back slowly developed into the V-shape. Huge abdominal muscles popped up over what was once a very flat stomach. His chest began to inflate like a balloon, as the pectoral muscles came to life on the once skinny and slim frame of the geeky looking boy. His pectorals were now almost a foot wider than the torso, and they were sticking out several inches in front of him. <br />
<br />
Massive biceps formed on his arms, blowing up until they looked like bowling balls. His shoulders, lats and traps began to take shape as well, leaving the geeky kid now looking like a real athlete! Both Ian and Ty loved it!<br />
<br />
“Ty, please, make sure he is the strongest kid in the whole school!” Ian pleaded. Ty made sure the boy enjoyed an additional surge of physical strength, making him the strongest geek in school. “Leave his face the way it was, so everybody knows who he is” Ian asked. When Ty was done, both Ian and Ty took turns to walk around Sebastian in a circle so they could check Ty’s work.<br />
<br />
“Ty, give him more biceps” Ian requested. Ty gave the boy a little more power, and the biceps grew another inch. <br />
<br />
“Hey Ty, make his clothes and shoes bigger and let’s dress him up!” Ian asked. Ty immediately wished for Sebastian’s clothes to become big enough to fit the boy, and he was immediately all dressed up again.<br />
<br />
“Awesome! Okay Ty, wake him up!” Ian ordered. Ty grinned as he whispered the command to unfreeze the geeky muscle boy.<br />
<br />
At first, Sebastian looked around the room and began to wonder why he was standing in the library. Then he looked down and gasped when he saw that he was taller than Ty and Ian.<br />
<br />
“Hey Ian… What are you doing here? And who’s that?” Sebastian said, pointing at Ty.<br />
<br />
“Sebastian, that’s Ty, a buddy of mine!” Ian responded. Ty extended his hand and Sebastian shook it, but Ty almost screamed in pain because of the boy’s mighty grip.<br />
<br />
“Wow! You’re very strong, dude!” Ty said, shaking his hand in pain.<br />
<br />
“Strong? Me? And Ian… What happened to you? Did you shrink? Why do you seem so short?” Sebastian asked his friend.<br />
<br />
“I’m not short, dude! You’ve grown taller than both of us!” Ian said; enjoying the wonder and confusion on Sebastian’s face as the boy started to look over his now fantastically muscular body. He was 7’4” tall and about 260 pounds of solid muscle. <br />
<br />
“Holy smoke! I’m huge! What is this? How did I get so big?” Sebastian said, almost beginning to panic as he noted his new height, weight and size. He began to flex his arms and he noted the bulging biceps on his arms.<br />
<br />
“This is nuts! I’ve never worked out in my life and I’m huge! Why? What’s going on? What happened?” Sebastian said, as he almost began to cry because the poor kid just didn’t know how to deal with his new size. Ian walked over to the big kid and rested his arm across his massive shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Ty made your muscles grow, Sebastian! I got tired of seeing you get picked on by everybody, and he made you into a real muscle man. You’re the strongest kid in school now! Nobody will mess with you again!” Ian explained.<br />
<br />
“I’m the strongest kid… in school? Me? You mean, I’m a jock now?” Sebastian asked. He still had to get used to his size. He tried to take a step forward and he almost lost his balance, but both Ian and Ty helped him get used to his new body. <br />
<br />
“Yes, you’re a jock, Sebastian!” Ty replied, feeling very satisfied with his work.<br />
<br />
“Wow… Thanks guys! I… I don’t know how to thank you…” Sebastian stuttered.<br />
<br />
“Can you tutor us in math?” Ian asked him.<br />
<br />
“Sure, with pleasure!” Sebastian replied, as the three boys slowly walked out of the library. Ty and Ian gave each other a high five as Sebastian grabbed his backpack. Then the threesome walked out, knowing that no bully would even want to come close. They were now best friends with Sebastian, who was the biggest geek in school and the strongest kid around. And Ty and Ian now had a new math tutor with muscle.</p>
