*Yesterday*<br />
<br />
Robert isn&#39;t really somebody who had everything set. He may make a flaw in his work here, and there, but he means well. He can&#39;t help it if he wanted to enjoy a good meal, He didn&#39;t really became obese on purpose. He just is, because he&#39;s been busy doing art commissions just to make money, and he sat on his fat butt, eating junk food as he draws his artwork. Still he went outside, and had a job to make extra... Well an odd job really...<br />
<br />
Granted, He was doing overtime, and he forgot to mention that to his roommate &#39;Wallace&#39;... &#39;I&#39;ll text him later...&#39; He thought to himself. Him being a waiter, he was bored out of his mind &quot;Do I really have any choice here?... If I was in a another Life, Universe, or just a different version of myself, what would I want to be?...&quot; He says to himself. <br />
<br />
He does have an interest, well more like a fantasy. He wanted to be a Sumo wrestler. They may look big, and fat. But they really are real strong, and flexible. Which both inspires him, and also depressed him. Because he is not Japanese. Even though he taught himself the language, it&#39;s not enough. He&#39;d still be an outsider. If only he could experience what it would be like to live in that life...<br />
<br />
As he was cleaning table, after table, after their costumers in an untidy bar, when he saw the commercial on TV. &quot;THE LIFE CHANGING COSTUME STORE&quot;? &#39;I mean... It&#39;s that time of year.&#39; He doesn&#39;t really believe in this idea that they can just give someone a new life. That&#39;s what a job counselor is there for... Right?<br />
<br />
After that, Robert turn away from the TV, and went back to work. Only to end up getting into trouble. He got in a fight that wasn&#39;t even worth it. He didn&#39;t even remember he said to him then. It just got out of hand, and his boss was livid, and fired him.<br />
<br />
Well there goes his odd job, so much for that overtime... He was ready to go home anyway... Having a dark cloud over his head. &quot;I guess I&#39;ll stick to what I do best until another job comes up. Or whatever...&quot; Little did he know, he&#39;s about to realize that the store he saw on TV, may actually be for real.<br />
<br />
When he got home. You told him about your experience at that store, and what happened to you. You then, went on ahead, and put your Lion Mask back on. And once again it started feeling like it&#39;s your real face, you even let Robert touch your face, to see if it&#39;s real... It was!... After what felt like over 10 minutes, you finally took your mask off.<br />
<br />
He still couldn&#39;t believe that his roommate, got a mask that would make his head that of a lion. When you asked him if he&#39;s willing to go with you, he said &#39;Yes!&#39; you stare at him. &quot;Wait so... You&#39;re not scared?&quot; You couldn&#39;t believe that he&#39;s willing to go! &quot;Dude, I won&#39;t lie, that lion head trick did startled me. But, I still want to see what they have anyway.&quot; Robert say.<br />
<br />
He may actually get a new life! To be an artist, A sumo wrestler, or anything! Or at the very least, he&#39;ll get a new odd job as a store clerk...<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
*Today*<br />
<br />
&quot;Son of a gun! Where is it?!&quot; He has been driving for more than 30 minutes, and he couldn&#39;t find the building. That was until he typed the coordinates on his GPS, and lo and behold he knows where he&#39;s at now!<br />
<br />
And he made it there 10 minutes late.<br />
<br />
As he opens the door, And finds both a Sumo wrestler in red, and you (his roommate). You are not too happy. &quot;Where have you been?! I&#39;ve been waiting! And you just weren&#39;t there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Wallace! I just thought I&#39;d knew where it is by the picture of the building!&quot; He said. You faceplam at him and say. &quot;Next time, use your GPS before you leave!&quot;<br />
<br />
After that rant, Robert approaches you, and sees the Red Sumo in front of you. He bows to Crimson Titan likes he&#39;s Japanese, and spoke.<br />
<br />
&#12300;&#12371;&#12435;&#12395;&#12385;&#12399;&#65281;&#31169;&#12399; &#12525;&#12496;&#12540;&#12488;&#12391;&#12377;&#12290;&#31169;&#12399; &#30456;&#25778;&#12398; &#12501;&#12449;&#12531;&#12391;&#12377;&#12289;&#12354;&#12394;&#12383;&#12395;&#20250;&#12360;&#12390;&#20809;&#26628;&#12391;&#12377;!&#12301;<br />
(Hello! I&#39;m Robert. I&#39;m a fan of sumo wrestling, it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you!)<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t help but break the news to him. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Rob, But, he&#39;s not really Jap-...&quot; Then Crimson spoke up.<br />
<br />
&#12300;&#12399;&#12376;&#12417;&#12414;&#12375;&#12390; &#12525;&#12496;&#12540;&#12488;! &#21517;&#21069;&#12399; &#12463;&#12522;&#12512;&#12478;&#12531; &#12479;&#12452;&#12479;&#12531;!&#12301;<br />
(Nice to meet you Robert! The name is Crimson Titan!)<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re the &#39;Crimson Titan&#39; that my roommate mentioned. Hey! Wallace, you didn&#39;t tell me that the owner is a Sumo Wrestler!&quot; Robert tells you. And you are baffled. The Shopkeeper spoke in a different language! &quot;But he wasn&#39;t when I met him!&quot; You told Rob, and look at Crimson again. It&#39;s like you don&#39;t even know him, and yet you roommate does. Robert has now made a new friend!<br />
<br />
&#12300;&#12381;&#12428;&#12391;&#12289;&#12354;&#12394;&#12383;&#12399; &#26412;&#24403;&#12395; &#30456;&#25778;&#12395; &#33288;&#21619;&#12364;&#12354;&#12426;&#12414;&#12377;&#12363;?&#12301;<br />
(So, are you really interested in sumo wrestling?)<br />
<br />
&quot;Hai!&quot; And so both Robert, and Crimson got to know each other, communicating in a language you just don&#39;t understand! You did want him to go out, and make friends but, not like this. You now feel like a third wheel!<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Guys!&quot; You spoke out loud. &quot;I can&#39;t understand a lick of what you&#39;re saying so... What&#39;s going on!?&quot; You have had enough of this. &quot;I just want to be on the same page as you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well maybe you would...&quot; Robert start. &quot;If you would study Japanese with me then you&#39;d be on the same page!&quot; He didn&#39;t mean for that to be rude, but he had told you it would be helpful to learn another language. He made a face that said: &#39;I told you so!&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey now!&quot; You didn&#39;t want his last words to make you feel this pathetic. &quot;I have an American Office Job, I don&#39;t have time to study a language that I don&#39;t need. And my job doesn&#39;t involve with video games! So, there!&quot; It still sounded pathetic, even for you.<br />
<br />
Robert shakes his head, and says. &quot;Okay, you can make all the excuses you want... Anyway It&#39;s been decided, that Crimson will show me where I can become a Sumo Wrestler!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! But what about me?!&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you?&quot; Robert remark. &quot;You can still join us, and be a Sumo Wrestler too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t want-... I don&#39;t even know Japanese! How am I supposed to join in the conversation!?&quot; You say finally. And then Robert was caught off guard, by Crimson speaking with a Japanese accent. &quot;I told you before Wally-san... You can be a Sumo with just English as your language, have Japanese as your only language, or have both! Depends on what you&#39;re looking for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Robert just stares at Crimson, he didn&#39;t expect him to even be speaking English. Crimson just smiles at him. &quot;Robato-san, I&#39;m the type of Rikishi that is bilingual, I still need to work with customers... But that do not mean I cannot have a life as a Rikishi!&quot;<br />
<br />
Robert is elated! This place is for real! And even if this is not what it&#39;s cracked up to be, he can still go back to his old life again. Robert turns to you. &quot;There, you see? You don&#39;t need to know, or have to go through the tedious task of learning Japanese to be a Sumo Wrestler! Come on man... Don&#39;t you want to be more than an Office worker?&quot; Then Crimson comes up to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how about it Wally-san?... Would you care to join in on the Sumo Fun!&quot; Crimson offer it. As if you&#39;ll miss the fun if you don&#39;t.<br />
<br />
And Robert, looks at you with worry. &quot;Come on Wallace, I know it would be fun!&quot; He says. He is overweight, and already knew Japanese so of course he&#39;d say that. But you... You&#39;re pretty much skinny. Granted, your not muscular, or fat... You only have an average build body, for someone who has an office job.<br />
<br />
You don&#39;t want to feel like you&#39;re being push into this, so you ask. &quot;If I say no, Where do I go to for help?&quot; Crimson expected this question. &quot;Well you have to go to the back, at the Commission Desk. There you&#39;ll find my twin brother Cerulean Titan! Who usually make new custom made costumes upon request.&quot;<br />
<br />
Okay so he is here!<br />
<br />
&quot;So then, what is he like? As in, is he a copy of you? Or...&quot; you asked.<br />
&quot;It depends on his mood...&quot; He didn&#39;t exactly gave you an answer. You asked again more clearly. And he caught on to your meaning...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right! Unlike me who wears only &#39;Red&#39;, and can be a bit jovial like Santa, or a Teddy Bear. Cerulean however... He wears only &#39;Blue&#39;, and can be melancholy... You would be lucky if he is even in a good mood. Because he got so aggravated with that woman the other day that-... My... I only hope that he is over it by now.&quot; Crimson stated, And Robert looks at us weirdly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! What woman?&quot; Oh right! You forgot mention that to him. A woman who you assume was named &#39;Skye&#39;, stormed off from the store for not being able to get the &#39;Costume&#39; she wanted. Screaming profanities, she threatened a lawsuit. But as far as you knew. Nothing came of it. You explained to Robert.<br />
<br />
&quot;In any case...&quot; Crimson continued. &quot;I did tell him that he could end up working with you, But he only said &#39;Yeah...&#39;, and went to his papers... I hope he is in better spirits right now... And if he is... Just don&#39;t suggest a costume &#39;based on Copyrighted Characters...&#39;&quot; Crimson gave you this warning. You&#39;re beginning to think that this may not be good idea to even visit him... But still...<br />
<br />
&quot;In any case Wally-san, What is your choice?...&quot;<br />
<br />
You are just standing there thinking. You came here to be a lion. And yes, you could be an Anthro Sumo Lion like he said but, Is that really what you wanted? And this &#39;Cerulean&#39; person... You are just so curious about what he even looks like right now...</p>
