<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As much as Charlie was enjoying being a Scorpkat he did miss being a Chakat more. And knew that it would put Sally&#39;s mind at ease if he were to return to normal. With Jess sidelined from what happened in Italy, it was up to Snowy and Maurice to figure a way to return him back to normal. But until then Sally was sitting in another room, sure, Charlie saw the advantages to having the multiple appendages but, wanted to be normal again. He looked outside and went out, finding the sun feeling good on his hide. But didn&#39;t think it was worth not seeing his mate upset. If it hadn&#39;t been for those scorpkats.... no, that scientist. If he wouldn&#39;t have done what he did, those creatures wouldn&#39;t have attempted to rape his mate and sister in-law/step-&quot;father&quot;.<br />
<br />
Shi walked over to see hir sibling to see how Shi was coping. Well, shi settled in nicely. Though Brent was feeling uncomfortable. &quot;Man, look, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m welcomed here. I mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Brent. It&#39;s not you, trust me. Sally&#39;s just had a bad history. See, shi was raped in Cairo, and what that did in the Vatican was open an old wound. You&#39;re welcome here, so don&#39;t you dare say you&#39;re not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Charlie, the stinger, it&#39;s got a venom sac in it. I studied chem stuff long enough. Mom told me you were a Chakat prior to this. Well, my stings had no effect like yours. But I do think, perhaps it&#39;s the chakat dna mixing with that of the scorpion.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... You know, you may be right.&quot; Charlie looked. &quot;Well, That means we got you and plenty of kats. I mean, Sally, shi won&#39;t sleep near me. Sure, I like this form but I think I&#39;ll be much happier when I return to normal.&quot; Shi laughed.<br />
<br />
As the two were talking Snowy walked up to him. &quot;Well, I got it, hun. However, it may not be the exact look you had as a chakat.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean, Snowy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What I mean is, your still going to end up with that tail. There is a perk, but you&#39;ll be somewhat like a manticore, like in the old myths.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you did what you can, Snowy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The good news is, in theory, it&#39;ll be creating a powerful new vaccine. And considering how strong it is now, compaired to the Foxkat Vaccine, it should be a permanent vaccine.&quot; Snowy said.<br />
<br />
Charlie nodded. &quot;Well, let&#39;s go, then. I just hope Sally will be okay with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Charlie, that&#39;s the other thing I want to talk to you on. I know you love her, but what if shi don&#39;t accept it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I will cut my tail off, I&#39;ll be a tailless kat. I don&#39;t care. But me and hir have been through tough times. I could&#39;ve gotten mad at hir cause of hir getting pregnant, even though it wasn&#39;t hir choice. Do you think it was my choice to become a scorpion. No. I miss my fur. Hell I miss the fleas I had. I miss being able to snuggle with my mate. I do like this body, but I don&#39;t like the fact that my mate, the one person I&#39;d die for, trying to avoid me. If shi don&#39;t want me around anymore then I&#39;ll leave. No one will ever see me again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop, Charles.&quot; Brent put a hand on his shoulder. &quot;You and I both known Sally. Shi isn&#39;t about to throw you out. I understand what shi&#39;s going through. I myself was raped by a fucking spider. A spider of all things, after changing into this. Look. If we must I&#39;ll work with Snowy here, and concoct a way to fully reverse what that scientist has done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snowy nodded. &quot;Shi&#39;s right. So settle down.  Come, let&#39;s go get you fixed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie smiled and the three walked into the lab. Sally was there looking on with Nikole by hir side. &quot;Dear, let me ask you something. Should we be unable to undo this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t say that, Nikole. I know we can. But should we not find a way, I will always, always love Charlie. Shi&#39;s my rock. If it weren&#39;t for hir a few years back, I&#39;d given up after getting raped. No I don&#39;t blame those that attempted it back in the Vatican. I blame that Asswhole. But other things. How&#39;s Jess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shi&#39;ll be fine. Shi&#39;s stubborn. Much like hir sister. Justin won&#39;t leave hir side. Francine is half tempted to declare war on the Italian government, but Raul, thankfully made a trip there to calm hir down. But you know, shi gets what shi has from hir sister. Shi&#39;s as stubborn as a mulekat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally smiled and watched Snowy administer the stuff to Charlie.<br />
<br />
Charlie groaned at the pain as hir extra arms receded back into hir body. The exoskeloton mirgrating back in, and fur spreading along his body. Fur to match his mate, aside from white tiger like stripes. This made Sally blush heavily. The pinchers, though, they seemed to stay. Perhaps it was that they were too big. As they looked the tail became coated in fur as well. Though Charlie did discover shi could stick the stinger out like hir new claws. Fur started to coat the pinchers which started to change into arms as hir normal arms were shrinking. Shi was relieved at the fact that hir body was rasing from the ground to it&#39;s original height.<br />
<br />
Sally only smiled. &quot;I knew that they&#39;d figure it out. Shi&#39;s beautiful. Though what&#39;s with the tail?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Came Maurice&#39;s voice. &quot;Shi&#39;s not a scorpkat. But, Snowy found a way to keep hir stinger, and make the stuff it produced stronger. So I suppose you could say, Charlie is a Mantikat. Resembling that of the legendary Manticore, and the source of the name. You see, Snowy couldn&#39;t reverse it. However. She just made it where it&#39;d alter him. The idea actually came from my dad. A manticore is both a cat and scorpion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With a human head.&quot; Nikole added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, true, but this one is just cat and scorpion. I know that we can&#39;t fully get rid of the tail, but it&#39;s covered up. I feel sorry for anyone who tries to hurt you, Sally. Especially with hir weapon hidden.&quot; Maurice smiled hugging hir.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you know I thank you both.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. You&#39;re family, Sal. And I wager in another six years, we&#39;ll literally be family. Seems your two oldest and Snowflake have decided, instead of Snowflake choosing, shi&#39;d take both as hir mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made the three laugh. Charlie walked in and hugged hir mate, both purring happily to have Charlie back. &quot;So dear, how was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How was what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Having your skeloton on the outside.&quot; Sally teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just say, truth be told, as fun as it was, I&#39;m glad my exoskeloton become an indoskeloton.&quot; Shi smiled and kissed Sally on the lips. &quot;Though I doubt I&#39;ll get use to having the stinger hidden on the tail, but at least I still have the vaccine. Though I doubt Brent will change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Charlie, I don&#39;t care. Brent isn&#39;t my mate. But shi&#39;s still family. As long as shi don&#39;t try to rape me....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt you&#39;ve got to worry about that. Especially after shi was raped hirself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, really. Well, then I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
 <br />
As they were celibrating, Mikkie ran up. &quot;Come quick. Sammy and Gloria&#39;s eggs, they&#39;re hatching.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; Charlie said. &quot;You know, I&#39;m still a chakat.&quot; shi smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, love. With an extra feature. Or should I say two.&quot; Sally stopped looking under hir mate from behind. &quot;And by that... I....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh what...&quot; Charlie looked under. &quot;How the hell...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Scorpions, bro, have two.&quot; Brent laughed walking by.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... shouldn&#39;t I have....&quot; Charlie rubbed his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, love. It&#39;s just more pleasure for me.&quot; Sally laughed at Charlie&#39;s bewilderment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um.... okay...&quot; Charlie stammered. &quot;But you know, that means that Talia isn&#39;t the only kat from myth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically she wasn&#39;t.&quot; Snowy commented. &quot;What about Sammy and Gloria.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, they don&#39;t count.&quot; Charlie said as they walked along. Indeed Charlie was now a chakat again, only a new breed. Which, with this, Sally couldn&#39;t deny, made hir very sexy. Funny how a bad thing turns into a good thing. Then a good thing becomes a aweful to a wonderful thing. Sally was a lucky girl, shi had the perfect mate who&#39;d go to the moon and back for hir. And shi&#39;d do the same. Shi told hirself that even if shi did choose to stay a scorpkat, shi&#39;d still love hir. It&#39;s just take time, possibly years to adjust to it. But it wouldn&#39;t happen over night. So now they were on their way to see the birth of the first born, first generation of dracokats.</p>
