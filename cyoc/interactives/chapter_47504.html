<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up to sunlight shining in your window. Pulling the blanket over your head, you roll over and try to go back to sleep. After a night of truly surreal dreams, all of them centered on a magical flashlight, you're really not ready to face the day until you thoughts together. There was something you wanted to do today, but for now you don't want to think about it, you just want to get a few more minutes sleep before your little brother comes running into your room, begging you to play pokemon with him, or asking if he can play videogames on your X-Box. You know it's all because he looks up to you and you try to be patient with him, but sometimes he manages to get on your nerves.<br />
<br />
There's a knock on your door, and by the sound of it you are able to recognize it as being your mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come in,&quot; you mutter, laying face down on your pillow.<br />
<br />
Your mom walks in and looks around your room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really wish you wouldn't leave your clothes in a pile like that,&quot; she comments before sitting down at the foot of your bed.<br />
<br />
Rolling over, you push yourself into a sitting position, letting the blanket fall away from you and causing your mom to smile and shake her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll do a load of laundry today, I promise,&quot; you say quickly, hoping that will make her happy since you don't exactly feel proud letting your mom see how messy you let your room get. You're sure that she knows that your dorm room at college is ten times worse and are embarrassed by the thought. It's not like you're a slob or anything, you just lose track of when you need to do laundry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she smiles, &quot;And while your at it could you strip the beds and get the sheets washed too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I might as well get everything done while I'm at it,&quot; for you to say this is no stretch, as much as you dislike having to take care of the laundry, getting multiple loads done in one day feels like less of a waste of time than spreading the chore out over a week. Yes, taking care of all the wash will pretty much kill your entire day between putting it in the machine and then hanging it out to dry before doing the next load, but you remember what it was you had to do today. You'll be babysitting Luke so your day is already shot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to hear it, I was worried that you'd forgotten that you'd be babysitting all day to day while I take care of some shopping I've been putting off for too long,&quot; she pats you on the leg, then walks out of the room.<br />
<br />
No sense in putting off the inevitable, you decide, getting out of bed and stretching.<br />
<br />
Before getting dressed, you head to the bathroom to wash up, wanting to get in there before your little brother since he usually brings his DS in with him and ends up playing games for at least half an hour. After he dropped one of his pokemon games in the toilet you would have thought that he would have learned his lesson, but so far he has not caught on. You figure that some day he's going to drop the whole DS in and then he'll learn his lesson.<br />
<br />
And thinking of pokemon, you laugh to yourself, your 'pocket monster' has been unusually well behaved this morning.<br />
<br />
Not really paying attention to anything, you stand in front of the toilet, and reach into the fly of your boxers so that you might relieve yourself, only to find that you cannot find what you're looking for. Your fingers brush across thick curls of pubic hair, but you cannot find your member.<br />
<br />
Looking down, you see that you have breasts and remember the flashlight you purchased yesterday. What you had thought to be strange dreams really all happened, you and everyone in your family if you recall correctly, are female now. Even more amazing is that being female feels so natural to you that you had failed to realize and recall that you changed yourself until this moment. <br />
<br />
It's also a little frightening that you failed to notice for so long, though you reassure yourself that you can change yourself back at any time. For now though you might as well stay as you are at least until you get a chance to get in touch with your girlfriend and spend some time together having fun. You're not going to go back to being a guy until you've had the chance to do some experimenting with your girlfriend as a girl.<br />
<br />
Smiling at the thought of what you might try and if you'll use the light on her, you pull down your boxers and sit down to take care of business.<br />
<br />
Unable to help yourself, you keep your legs open to watch, marveling at the way even such a simple biological function has changed. Then you wipe yourself dry.<br />
<br />
As you wash your hands you think over what you just did and find yourself surprised at how natural it feels to have a feminine opening where your masculine anatomy once was. Up until now if someone had asked you how you thought it would feel like to have female parts you would have said that it would probably feel like a lack on account of there being what amounted to a hole there. Instead you find that it's a very ordinary feeling, maybe a feeling of lightness, but hardly noticeable as anything exceptional.<br />
<br />
You look at yourself in the mirror, running your fingers through your slightly longer hair to neaten it, then looking yourself over. You're a fairly plain looking girl, tomboyish, and aside from the breasts you look very much like you did before hitting puberty. Looking at them makes you realize that the feeling of having breasts is another thing that caught you off guard. Small as they are, a well formed a-cup, you'd still expect to feel their weight, and though they bounce a bit when you move, they're not really noticeable to you.<br />
<br />
After you wash your face, pleased that you don't have to shave, you go to your room, put on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt and go and see about breakfast.<br />
<br />
In the living room you see your little sister, Lucy, who until last night was your little brother Luke, sitting watching cartoons as she eats a bowl of some sort of sickeningly sugary cereal.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you get done with that, eat at least half a banana,&quot; you say, reminding her of the rule your mom made about that sort of junk cereal, &quot;and brush your teeth really good. If you get cavities it'll be your own fault for eating that crap.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's a bit strange to see Luke as a girl and have to remember that he's called Lucy now, but you decide that you'll let him stay a girl for now. Later on, if she gets on your nerves, you might change her back to a boy, making him the only guy in a family of girls. For now, you find the idea of an all female family funny, especially since, due to the reality altering power of the flashlight, no one sees anything wrong or strange about it.<br />
<br />
For your own breakfast you have a bowl of corn flakes and strawberries since you're feeling too lazy to bother making pancakes or anything like that.<br />
<br />
By the time you're done, Lucy has gone into the bathroom to brush her teeth, taking her DS with her, meaning that you'll have quite the wait before you can brush your teeth. Normally you'd tell her to hurry up, but you decide that if you're going to have to watch her for most of the day, you might as well savor every moment here she isn't actively bugging you.<br />
<br />
Taking advantage of the time you have, you put your dirty clothes in the wash, then walk around the house, listening carefully for when Lucy gets out of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Everything is the same as it ever was, yet at the same time, subtly changed. All of the family pictures feature your parents as a pair of women rather than a husband and wife. Yours is the only remotely masculine clothing in the house, though your dad, or maybe other mom, still clearly likes sports and has the same job with the same company. The pictures of you are the most interesting, especially the ones taken when you were little. They show that even when you were young you dressed like a boy, and one showing you at the beach has you wearing a boy's bathing suit and no top. That alone is enough to make you wonder how strong the flashlight works to change reality. Right now it looks to you like it actually works to make what is considered unusual, or gender inappropriate behavior be seen as normal.<br />
<br />
Then again, what you did with Gene yesterday at the mall should be proof of that, giving him breasts and going with him as he went bra shopping, before you changed him almost completely into a girl save for his junk, though even that you left greatly diminished. Thinking about that you laugh. Gene, even though he still has male 'equipment' acts much more like a girl than you do.<br />
<br />
As you walk through your house, looking for little differences, you don't give much thought to being a girl. In a way it's a disappointment, since you expected it to feel strange, but it's also interesting in its own way to feel just like yourself, just having the body of a girl.<br />
<br />
Having given the matter some thought, you decide that it would probably be less fun to act like a girl and would take away from the experience.</p>
