<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Uuuuh Derick actually moans and rolls off the counter, still standing though, Mel and Tim ask if he’s ok, “everything fine I suppose” replied Derek, “I just don’t know what’s gotten into me”<br />
Here maybe the news will help says Mel, and turns on the TV. <br />
Derek immediately begins to feel the burning growing, Sensation again, And his legs actively start shaking, He whimpers and immediately runs out of the room, Out of the front door out of the complex, and just keeps frantically running. Mel and Tim are stunned, What do we do?, Mel says. He’s my stepbrother we’ve lived together all our lives! He can’t just be gone and become turned into a dog! I can’t lose him like this! Shhhh shhh Tim Calms Her, and as he comes to give her a reassuring hug his hands brush against her furry tail, in panic he exclaims “ you told me this place was safe, I trusted you!” But you’re becoming a mutt too! “Yeah so, not much we can do about it anyways, just don’t have sex,” “so I can end up like Derek”? He asks? You’re crazy, I have to get out of here! No offense. She quickly rushes to stop him and tells him it only just started that they are so safe, and she’s always loved him as a brother, I mean they are cousins, and she really only brought him here to keep her safe from Derek, he calms down his breathing, just as he turns to notice both of the news reporters turn into dogs, begin to sniff each other, and then a censor screen comes up. Oh god how bad is it!?!? How long do we have?!??<br />
Is anywhere safe?? Tim screams, and Mel just calms him down as she is beginning to feel her own arousal build beyond what she could’ve ever expected. <br />
<br />
Derek ran until he lost where he was, he had never traveled this city much. And he noticed he had really lost his mind if he thought coming out here would be better for him. Everywhere there were people, sexy people, everywhere there was hybrids, people who had not yet fully transformed like Derek. Many of whom he could just smell arousal. This whole thing felt a lot like the process of trying not to think of a pink elephant if you’ve heard that expression. But he couldn’t help it, it was always there, every corner he turned, every alley, every corner, he even saw hybrids fucking in the street and completing their transformation, he ran and ran until he came to one of the stone monuments placed in his city. Lots of cars still, people who could still drive. Lots of pedestrians, and lots of people fucking in the street, and yes with onlookers that also completed their transformation as they watched. Cum was everywhere in groups surrounding the fucking of all kinds, the stench was making Derek mad. He wanted so bad just to drop his drawers right there and jack off till he busted a nut And followed suit. But he was still fighting it. His canine dick twitching in his pants, drool coming out of his toungue that felt significantly longer. He was hoping for help, any kind of help. He looked to the sky and for a second had a whiff of relief, a moment of satisfaction till he heard a super loud sexual moaning grasp his attention, he cringed and almost doubled over, looking down again his canine mind won, he saw a man and woman fucking in the street completing their transformation, just as the guy was finishing and fully changing the dick pulled out and gushed so much cum audibly hitting the pavement, and perfectly fit right back in not even a moment as the canine dick, they both moaned and now they were two dogs fucking in the street, fluids still flew everywhere on the ground below until the male finally got his knot in and tunred butt to butt with the female. Who was panting and finishing her transformation While being impregnated. This was wayyy too much for Derek, he had done his absolute best for almost the entire 2 days! Everytime he saw somthing he glanced away but he felt it this time, the point of no return, his body crumpled as his back changed slightly with the rest of him, he stood on his hind legs as he tore his clothes from him, and the dog-man the size of a wolf ripped his underwear and massively came spontaneously! A loud cry escaped his lips, everyone was watching onlooker and dog, with immense satisfaction. Shot after shot escaped his body, he pumped almost a quart of human semen out in 8 spurts until he finally crumpled and his dick became fused with his body showering him in now canine-watery cum, dousing him, he curled up cumming the entire time, and uncurled as a full dog with a powerful 8-inch doggy dick, red and sailed pulled out of the sheath knot and all, still pumping almost a gallon of fluid on the ground. Derek was done, fully a black lab. And about to become the talk of the town judging by all the looks around him. Panting happily!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tim and Mel had turned off the news since it had frightened them, they sat alone across from one another, Tim was unaware of the bright blonde patches that were beginning to develop on his arms and legs, sweating and tugging at his shirt collar he said, “ we are gonna have to watch you very closely, we can’t touch at all, and if you offer me sex I will have to put you in the cage with Mike! Give me the key! She tried to object but couldn’t, she finally gave him the key. Tim had had a secret, this was all too much for him, he had a slight kink for dogs, and this was like a dream-nightmare come true, Mel was practically half a golden lab, so much so in heat even he could smell her & it was making him dizzy, but had no idea truly why he could. He felt fully in control so he was confident. He had never been with a girl. His mind wandered as they read books and he admired her change from afar so they wouldn’t touch. Can I please take off my clothes, Mel said with an irritated tone, she was sweating covered in fur and looking very cramped. Tim thought this might be where we have to lock them together in more ways than one. He smiled. Sure! But we might have to lock you up soon, and I’m sure you’ll know what that means. Mike was panting in his big dog cage his canine cock showing its head from his sheath, Mel nodded and said I get the idea, but she was dead set on Tim being her lover, lust drunk but still human wise she decided to go out with at least a little control, so as she stripped she said so Tim you’ve really never been with a woman before, he was looking away as he said no really I was saving myself for marriage, or for someone really special. “I’m not special” she said with a smirk, as she parted her leg and wafted her arousal toward him, he instinctively turned toward her hypnotized, his cock poking out his waistband his head exploded above his uncut for skin that was beginning to attach itself to his lower abdomen. He leaned toward her, her plan was working, his face was changing fast she thought?  He was very aroused, he leaned forward and to her surprise actually started licking her pussy which was becoming covered all around with fur as he was eating her out, tightening, and squirting female cum filling his mouth. As his face became a snout she turned to let him mount her, in one single trust he knotted her rock hard, tried to trust some more, ultimately failed and milked her insides with so much of both human and puppy cum she thought she would’ve been disappointed because he finished early but she was wrong his warm liquid filling her womb and even stretching her cervex caused her to have multiple orgasms and she became pregnant with hybrid and fully blooded puppies. They were tied for a long time. She had fully changed while Tim had not, he was still unbelievably horny after cumming so much, he took the key from the cage and let Mike out and finish him off, he turned around and let Mike mount him, Mike coating his insides with puppy seed in 30 short seconds making Tim’s cock fully stand out of its new sheath and pour gallons of his own seed onto the floor below them both making them collapse into their fluids. Panting he completed his transformation knotted to Mike, happily in a doggy fuck bliss</p>
