<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You watched as Luna gave a wide smile, which showed her teeth a bit, but with her blonde furred tail wagging behind her you could tell that she was happy and there was nothing devious being planned. You found yourself wagging your tail at seeing her happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking we could have our special game,&quot; Luna said to you, &quot;you know... the round of monopoly with a twist. We play and worship the other&#39;s feet... or foot... while the other takes their turn and alternating along the way. You worship mine while I roll and move and I worship yours while you roll and move. The winner then gets undivided attention for ten minutes... maybe more, depending on when mom and dad get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re fine with that?&quot; you asked with your eyes going wide, ears perked, and tail wagging harder, which served to only make Luna giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I am,&quot; Luna laughed back to you, &quot;I admitted liking your feet last night and finding out you loved me is just as magical to me as it is to you. And in that... I love having your attention and when and where I can would love to return it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I would love to play,&quot; you smiled back to Luna.<br />
<br />
The two of you moved walk around the couch and then back toward the kitchen, and you privately were very much looking forward to this game. In some ways it fit in a bit with your foot fetish and the growing romantic love you&#39;d been able to confidently express to Luna since becoming a MILF-wolf. You were happy with that as the two of you came into the kitchen again. Luna went to the cabinets under the sink and came from them with a bottle of 409 and then getting a paper towel from its spool next to the sink. She soon set about cleaning the table and making sure that there was nothing from the dinner the two of you had shared earlier would get on the monopoly board and the monopoly money.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in a way, this will give us time to wait for mom and dad to return,&quot; Luna commented as you moved to place the board on the table as Luna finished cleaning it, &quot;they may not have a &quot;plan&quot; on when they&#39;ll be back... but given how long they can hold off transforming on a full moon night... they&#39;ll probably be back somewhere between ten and eleven in order to avoid transforming in public and wrecking their clothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of that actually sounds like fun,&quot; you admitted as you turned back to get the monopoly money.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at night... it can be,&quot; Luna shrugged as she put the 409 back and then came to collect the pieces the two of you would use, &quot;to a degree... bursting out of what I was wearing last night was fun. As I took on what was to be my adult... and in a way... my REAL form. And at the same time, a lot of my human clothes wouldn&#39;t fit my human form now, so it wasn&#39;t like undressing to change was necessary. However, keep in mind that right now... we&#39;re too big for even the clothes we got today. The same would go for mom and dad. Their MILF-wolf forms are too big for the clothing that fits their human forms and it would be clothing they would have to replace. So... I doubt that mom and dad would deliberately push the envelope to where they&#39;d transform in public.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about their three friends?&quot; you wonder, &quot;as your mom said they&#39;re MILF-wolves too...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I can&#39;t predict,&quot; Luna admitted, &quot;my guess is that before your stepmom warned you about the Wolf Hunters, this would have been an over night thing. They&#39;d come... go out to dinner... come back, transform, and then go out into the woods for all the pack related fun that they&#39;ve had for eighteen years. Now... I&#39;m not sure. They could come back here and leave for their town tomorrow morning. Or they&#39;d drop mom and dad off and would then drive home... probably stopping somewhere to transform and then continue on. I really can&#39;t predict shat they&#39;ll do.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of you arranged things and then sat down at the table. You both would use the same pieces that you&#39;d used in the game with Kellie earlier in the day, though this time you sat down next to Luna so that way you could have easier access to Luna&#39;s feet without hitting your head on the table and the same would apply for Luna. Of course as you both sat down there then came the next hurdle in figuring out what to do. For at first you wanted to put both your feet in Luna&#39;s lap and she could do the same. This however served to twist your hips and her hips so that the two of you were facing each other and would have to pivot at the hip in order to then roll the dice, and your fur was soft enough that after an attempt or two to try it, you found yourself sliding to a point where you might fall out of the chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;We may just have to settle for one foot,&quot; Luna commented, &quot;my left foot and your right foot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; you said slowly and moved to place your right foot in Luna&#39;s lap as she did the same with her left foot. The two of you were seated close enough that this was possible and you could feel the muscles in Luna&#39;s leg under your own leg, and you other leg as able to hold you steady. It wasn&#39;t perfect, but it did seem to work out fairly well. &quot;Well... I think this will work... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... and we won&#39;t attract to much attention here and can be alert to anything else that goes on,&quot; Luna nodded, &quot;including make sure mom and dad don&#39;t try to sneak in after curfew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You make that sound like we&#39;re their parents,&quot; you quipped over to Luna.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all in good fun,&quot; Luna smiled back, &quot;besides... they did it all through high school. Some boy would ask for a date... and they&#39;d want me back by ten if it wasn&#39;t a full moon night and if it was, I wasn&#39;t to go out at all. And if we ever tried to stay out longer... mom and dad would be waiting. Though... things on those dates never really got to a point where I&#39;d want to stay out late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because they weren&#39;t me?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
Luna took your and nodded with a smile, &quot;and because it appears that both of us couldn&#39;t work up the courage to say that we liked each other more than just as friends... but in the end, it all worked out.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smiled back to her, &quot;So... who will be the banker for this game and who will go first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be the banker since I won the last game,&quot; Luna answered and then reached into the rolling box and lifted up one die, &quot;and as for who goes first, we&#39;ll do what we did before the first game.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and lifted up the other die. Luna rolled hers and got a 3. You then followed and also got a 3. That got a laugh from both of you and you rolled one die again. On the second try, Luna rolled a 4 and you rolled another 3. From there, Luna began to start the role as banker and distributed the monopoly money for the starting round and then got ready to take her first turn. As she did so, you lifted up the foot that Luna had in your lap and licked at the paw pad under her first toe...</p>
