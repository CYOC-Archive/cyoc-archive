<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On Sunday, Ethan spent most of his day finishing up a school project, and the remainder of his homework. He also spent his spare time txting with Lucas, and thinking about what had happened the previous day. Since then, Eric had remained cloistered in his room, and had avoided showing his face after what happened at the dog park.<br />
<br />
It had been a shock to find his innocent little brother -- who apparently wasn&#39;t quite THAT innocent at all -- sitting on the grass with dog paws, a tail, and a slobbery tongue. Even more, that he had fallen victim to the same thing that Ethan himself had. Ethan wasn&#39;t sure exactly what the attraction was for Eric in borrowing animal parts, a feat that Ethan didn&#39;t even know was a possibility, but he knew well the allure of forbidden things. More accurately, if he thought about it, the danger was obsessing over something that wasn&#39;t originally his. On reflection, Ethan wasn&#39;t sure whether to be relieved that he wasn&#39;t the only one in their family susceptible to such weirdness, or concerned that his normally mature-beyond-his-age little brother had embraced said perversion wholeheartedly.<br />
<br />
One thing was certain though: Eric&#39;s punishment had to be temporary. The ring had been a net positive in their lives, and Ethan reasoned that he shouldn&#39;t deprive Eric anymore than necessary. As soon as the lesson was sufficiently learned, they could go back to the way things were. There was more to it than that though, and Ethan knew the reasoning had a personal ulterior motive behind it. He didn&#39;t WANT the current situation to last, because he knew he was going to feel it again too.<br />
<br />
The desire to be small.<br />
<br />
Monday rolled around, and it was another school day. Ethan cruised through most of his classes on autopilot, until it came to his study period. In a repeat of the previous week, he was in the reading room no more than five minutes when the perennial invader dropped by. With her track record of spontaneous appearances, Haylee&#39;s arrival should have been expected, but Ethan just took it in his stride, even though she was still able to make him nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;So! The party?&quot; She pulled the blinds closed conspiratorially, like some important state secrets were about to be divulged, and then sat in the chair next to him. &quot;Mindy said you didn&#39;t stay too long, and she saw you leaving with a ninja. A ninja that, I have on good authority, goes by the name Lucas Sorensen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Ethan looked away, feeling weirdly shy about confirming it. &quot;I left with him, and he, uh ... walked me home, and we talked, and, um, exchanged numbers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oho. Do go on.&quot; She was listening intently. &quot;There&#39;s gotta be more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damn her! How did she know?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, on Saturday, he rang me, we talked, and, uh, he asked me out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Asked you out? Like, on a date?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. A date.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I fucking knew it! I told you he was interested!&quot; Haylee gloated, and prodded his arm. &quot;Aren&#39;t you happy I worked my magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, yeah. I am. I&#39;m ... actually looking forward to our date. Lucas, he&#39;s- ... well, he&#39;s a really good guy, and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really attractive? A catch? Maybe even really hung too, just like somebody else I know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haylee.&quot; He protested, blushing, but his mind inadvertently wandered, and then he was trying to picture what Lucas would look like naked, and how true her speculation might be. Before he knew it, he felt his crotch plumping up a little, the idea interesting him more than he expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of which, I noticed that you aren&#39;t &#39;on loan&#39; today.&quot; Deftly, she slid closer to him, and cupped him through his pants, the swelling already catching her notice. Ethan twitched in surprise, but he didn&#39;t pull away, and she carefully unzipped him. &quot;Since this might be my last chance before you get married and buy a timeshare together, I want to give you a going-away present. Just promise you won&#39;t forget about me when you&#39;re busy making gay babies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haylee, I-&quot; he tried, but she interrupted him again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hush, big boy,&quot; she said, and reached into his underwear. Her right hand wrapped around him, and withdrew, pulling his full length out into the air. Haylee drew in a breath of admiration, her eyes taking the sight in, her hand causing his shaft to fatten, and slowly harden. &quot;Ethan, you have the most perfectly impressive cock I&#39;ve ever seen. If anyone tells you differently, they&#39;re insecure and also a liar. If he doesn&#39;t appreciate every inch of this beautiful monster, you let me know, and I&#39;ll educate him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her praise made him rapidly stiffen, and her left hand joined in and scooped his balls out, drawing them forward as well so she could lightly massage them. There was an approving gleam in her eyes, and she reverently slid her right palm along the skin, while her left&#39;s fingers tickled his sac. Pride began to swell in Ethan&#39;s chest, and he engorged fully, long and thick and hard, in response to her treatment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; she whispered, &quot;close your eyes, lean back, and imagine I&#39;m your studly fair-haired Prince Charming.&quot;<br />
<br />
He did just that.<br />
<br />
Ethan got comfortable, and in his mind, the smaller delicate fingers morphed, becoming a male hand. The slow stroking grip now belonged to Lucas, and he was gentle but firm. Then the first hand was being joined by a second, and Ethan&#39;s cock was straining even more, attempting to showoff for his crush. The hands moved in unison up and down his shaft, and the feeling of so much contact, all that sliding skin, was incredible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both hands!&quot; Ethan bit his lip, his eyes pressed shut, thoughts simmering in amazement. &quot;He needs both hands to properly jerk me off! I- ... I really AM hung.&quot; His renewed appreciation was back after days of lying dormant. &quot;He likes it. I like it! How did I ever get tired of this?&quot;<br />
<br />
The upper hand squeezed around the swollen head of his penis, twisting on the spongy tissue, and the friction on his nerves sent bolts of sexual electricity shooting all the way down to his toes. Ethan grunted, his liquid oozing out and onto the stroking fingers, and they slid faster up and down, slickened. It was an AMAZING feeling, and Ethan wondered why he had ever taken his size for granted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so big! It&#39;s ... so good!&quot; Masculine energy surged through his crotch, and Ethan thrust up, into the jacking hands. With a final clench, the iron-hard rod spasmed and he let go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucas!&quot; He moaned it out loud, and with pressurised force, thick fluid rocketed up his length and out. He heard the soft patter of his cum striking the carpet and the wall, stream after stream as he bathed in the warm buzz. The feeling of his oversized cock, his teenaged joy, pumping and launching his male essence, was the ego boost he needed.<br />
<br />
As he relaxed, coming down from the high, the last spurts ejecting, the fantasy fading, he could feel Haylee wiping him down, her hushed exhalations seeming to express her awe at the volume of his explosion. Ethan was smiling, his eyes still closed in zen contemplation, his status as a healthy teenage boy restored in his own mind. It had felt so good, and he was so glad he&#39;d let it happen, but, still, at the corner of his mind was a whisper that told him: there&#39;s something off about this, and with that hint, a single stray thought kept wandering back to his little brother -- and the flawless soft pure thing between his legs.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
By Wednesday, Ethan was feeling a good amount of anxiety during his school day -- the date had been planned for that evening, and though he was mostly on top of schoolwork, he found it difficult to concentrate on his classes. By coincidence, it was also exactly a full month since he had first acquired the ring, and it was weird to think how much he and Eric had gone through over that time. Using it had changed them both, and it had never seemed more obvious than the current time.<br />
<br />
Ethan knew it wasn&#39;t just pre-date nerves. He was definitely looking forward to it, but he also felt very antsy, and more and more, it was plain why. When Eric had been in charge, they were swapping regularly -- more than once a day -- and it had become the norm to spend a lot of time not &#39;being himself&#39;. Simply put, he wasn&#39;t used to being full sized for so long in one go anymore, and despite living the previous 17 years of his life without it being an issue, that was BEFORE he&#39;d become accustomed to spending more than half his waking moments small.<br />
<br />
By afternoon swim practice, he was getting the impression that his underwear was too tight, his bulge too large for the material. It absolutely wasn&#39;t, but the phantom sensations his brain kept sending him were whispering that everything would fit correctly, would just feel RIGHT, if he had Eric&#39;s cock -- no, their shared cock! It was his too!<br />
<br />
All through doing laps, in between concentrating on his swimming, he was either focused on Lucas, or on how much he missed swapping with his brother. For his part, Lucas was his usual easygoing self, and there was no pressure. He was acting no different than any other time they had practice together, and he joked with Ethan, and with Greg -- who seemed to also be in a good mood, and wasn&#39;t acting out or being whiny and annoying. Still, Ethan found himself a bit out of sorts, unable to shake the discomfort from being forced back to &#39;normal&#39; life.<br />
<br />
After school, Ethan picked up Eric and they went home. The younger brother wasn&#39;t very talkative, the punishment from the weekend definitely having a lasting impact on his mood, but he was cordial enough. Even though Eric was in the proverbial dog-house for his behaviour, (a turn of phrase that made Ethan chuckle) he was still well-mannered and polite, if a little cool and disinterested. For a few moments on the drive home, Ethan wondered if he was being too hard on his sibling, but then he steeled his resolve, with a self-reminder: just because he missed their swaps, it didn&#39;t mean Eric should be let off the hook!<br />
<br />
The next few minutes were spent taking a quick shower, and then preparing for the date. He dressed up in tidy casual clothes, fixed his hair, and put on a little cologne -- nothing really fancy, but he did want to make a good impression. It took Ethan a while to choose the right pants, and for some reason, they didn&#39;t quite sit correctly at the crotch. No matter how he smoothed down the material and adjusted it around his junk, they just felt too close-fitting, and though Ethan was aware enough of the reason, he tried to downplay it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; he told himself. &quot;Just an itch. An itch that I don&#39;t need to scratch. This is like a withdrawal or something, right? I&#39;ve just gotta ride it out and it will go away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suppressing his discomfort, he finished dressing, grabbed his wallet, phone, keys, and left the house, letting Eric know he&#39;d be back later.<br />
<br />
Nervous, but excited, Ethan headed out onto his date with Lucas.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
They met at the nearby mall to get food before they went to a movie. Lucas had opted for a similar smart-casual look, and by Ethan&#39;s estimate, he looked fantastic; clean and stylish, but not too overdressed. The choice of food was subs, so they got their sandwiches made and sat to eat in the food court.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know this is your first date with a guy, so you&#39;re probably nervous,&quot; Lucas said, while they ate. &quot;There&#39;s no expectations though, so just enjoy yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t have a lot of experience with girls either, so it&#39;s kinda making me anxious anyway,&quot; Ethan chuckled, &quot;but I definitely want to be here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s honestly surprising to me that you haven&#39;t really dated before. There are a lot of girls at school -- and a few guys too -- who would jump at the chance. Some of them because you&#39;ve got the looks, and some because, well, I don&#39;t wanna sound crude, but, y&#39;know.&quot; Lucas&#39; wink was plenty of indication as to what he meant.<br />
<br />
Ethan blushed, and he felt a mental pinch trigger at the mention. His underwear shrank a size, in an imaginary constriction that somehow seemed horribly suffocating even though it actually wasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Nothing was REALLY getting smaller, he told himself. It was just his brain playing tricks.<br />
<br />
Not real, he repeated to himself. All in my head.<br />
<br />
But ... just WHY did it feel so tight?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of which, I&#39;d love to see how that magic ring works, some time?&quot; Lucas took a bite out of his sandwich, chewing thoughtfully, curiosity written all over his face. &quot;I mean, I still absolutely believe you, but it sounds super cool, and I&#39;d like to see it in action.&quot;<br />
<br />
Show Lucas? Ethan hadn&#39;t considered doing that, but he now knew -- like Greg and Haylee did -- and Ethan trusted him, since they were on a date after all ... maybe he could?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll show you one day.&quot; He smiled. &quot;It can be kinda wild using it, but ... also a fun experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe too much fun, he thought.<br />
<br />
Finishing up their food, they wandered through the mall, idly chatting and window shopping, before finally making their way into the adjoining cinema. Ethan went to queue, but Lucas stopped him. &quot;Already got them! I planned ahead.&quot; He grinned, holding up the tickets -- two for admission to the action-comedy they had agreed on. &quot;Buy some treats, and we&#39;re good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Two bags of popcorn, drinks, and candy in hand, they went inside and chose seats near one side. It was a very quiet showing, being late afternoon on a school night, and they had most of the theatre to themselves, with only a couple of people in far-off seats. The pair settled in, getting comfortable, and waited for the start.<br />
<br />
The movie was slow to begin with, but once it got going, Ethan began to enjoy himself. The plot was a mixture of physical comedy and smart dialogue, and he found himself really getting into it. Maybe a quarter of the way through, he noticed Lucas&#39; hand brush his. Their fingers meshed together, and then next second, they were holding hands. Just moments later, he felt their shoulders touch. Easy and natural, Ethan went with the flirty movements, pressing against him in response, and then Lucas was doing the same too, and they were leaning on each other while they watched.<br />
<br />
It was awesome.<br />
<br />
Except, at the same time, Ethan&#39;s &#39;itch&#39; was getting worse.<br />
<br />
Over the last couple of minutes, it had become increasingly impossible to ignore. Like somebody had turned up some setting in his head, he couldn&#39;t focus on anything but his crotch. His groin felt like it was overfilled, with FAR too much stuffed down there, and ... he NEEDED to reduce it! More and more, he was being distracted from the movie and Lucas&#39; enchanting presence -- which were what he WANTED to be paying attention to -- and his mind kept going back to Eric&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
No -- it was their shared cock.<br />
<br />
Or, truly, wasn&#39;t it just ... HIS cock?<br />
<br />
It had only been a couple of days, and Ethan missed it really really badly. It worried him that he had descended to this level of desperate craving so quickly, but he knew he had to do something about it! Lucas was lightly rubbing his shoulder against his, and Ethan knew, with a stressed-out fear, that the other boy was sending all the right signals. Very soon, Lucas was going to kiss him.<br />
<br />
Ethan wanted that -- he really wanted to do it!<br />
<br />
But ... not like this, not with a messed-up head.<br />
<br />
He would react weirdly, do something stupid, freak out, mess it up somehow. He felt SO uncomfortable, like a fundamental part of him was out of place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, h-hey,&quot; he whispered across, to his crush, &quot;I gotta run to the bathroom, I&#39;ll be back soon, &#39;kay?&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Ethan was up, and off to the restroom.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Thoughts whirling, Ethan stood at one of the urinals, relieving himself. The mere sensation of his own penis in his hand was odd to him, the thrum of liquid passing through it as he peed just as foreign as the size and shape of the long soft organ. The sense of displacement was an anguish to him, and he kept trying to push away the idea that it was somehow wrong, but it sat front and centre in his mind. His penis was just ... too big. But, he loved it dearly, so how could it be too BIG, of all things? His crotch was a blessing, not a curse!<br />
<br />
He needed to get his head in order.<br />
<br />
But ... that itch was too much, too powerful.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve gotta make it go away. I&#39;ve gotta do something! I&#39;ve gotta- ... swap.&quot; Ethan knew the solution, and he knew he was going to act on it. He had to, and his mind was already drawn to his surroundings, because there was only one thing for it.<br />
<br />
Dicks.<br />
<br />
He needed a smaller dick, and if he couldn&#39;t have the most ideal one -- Eric&#39;s cock -- then he&#39;d just have to borrow somebody else&#39;s. His eyes darted to the other restroom patrons, very surreptitiously so as not to get noticed, and he checked them out.<br />
<br />
Two were adults, twenty-to-thirty somethings. Too old, regular size.<br />
<br />
One was a late teen: good age, but too big.<br />
<br />
The last was a kid. Maybe a year younger than Eric, scrawny, and with a package of similar proportions.<br />
<br />
Perfect!<br />
<br />
Thinking quickly, he delayed finishing at the urinal until the adults and the teen were done at the sinks and departing, then he came up next to the kid, who was last, and washing his hands.<br />
<br />
Ethan felt really weird about what he was doing -- involving somebody younger through dishonesty -- but ... he HAD to make something happen, or he was gonna go crazy!<br />
<br />
He just needed a clothing item. One thing!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, um, don&#39;t wanna be a downer,&quot; he started speaking to the boy as they stood side by side at the counter, &quot;but didn&#39;t they tell you that hats aren&#39;t allowed in the cinema?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-really?&quot; The boy looked over at him with wide timid eyes, and then pulled his cloth cap off, and held it in one dry hand while he wiped the other. Caucasian, with dark hair and eyes, he seemed cute, but very submissive, maybe even kinda gullible. &quot;Um, nobody told me that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true. It&#39;s one of the rules.&quot; Ethan nodded, lying authoritatively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; The kid just took his word, and looked down, seeming put out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry though, my movie is done soon. I can give it to an attendant and they&#39;ll let you have it back after yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I- ... I don&#39;t know.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;What if you keep it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Ethan Morales, and I go to Belmont High. It&#39;s close by here. If you don&#39;t get your hat back, you can tell my school I took it, and I&#39;ll get in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; He seemed to consider this, and the reassurance was apparently enough. &quot;Okay.&quot; He handed the cap to Ethan, who took it, his heart beginning to pound faster as he gripped the material. The boy nodded. &quot;Thanks for helping me, then. I gotta go back to my movie now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan nodded in response, and with that, the boy darted out of the restroom and was gone.<br />
<br />
Definitely gullible, though he wasn&#39;t going to keep the cap. He&#39;d just hand it to the cinema staff afterwards, exactly like he&#39;d promised.<br />
<br />
No harm done.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he thought, gripping the hat tightly, as he slipped into one of the stalls and locked the door, &quot;thank YOU.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pulling on the cap, he lowered his pants, the ring on his finger, and concentrated.<br />
<br />
The sensation, and sight, of his cock sucking inward, his sac dwindling and drawing up to his groin, filled him with an astounding sense of relief that was both disturbing and extremely welcome. Ethan sighed, letting out his breath, as the psychological ache immediately disappeared, and all of a sudden he felt MUCH better.<br />
<br />
It was like a weight lifted off his shoulders.<br />
<br />
This was more like it!<br />
<br />
Examining himself, he noticed that while the skin was just as delightfully soft and smooth as he was meant to be, his new penis was actually slightly larger, even though the kid was definitely younger than Eric, probably a 10 year old. &quot;My real cock is even more immature than this,&quot; he murmured, reddening with a shameful blush, a finger brushing under his balls experimentally. They were super tight, closer than his normally were -- something Ethan found kinda cool and strangely intriguing -- but they were also marginally larger. &quot;Not as small as mine, nor as awesome, but they&#39;ll do.&quot;<br />
<br />
This would work, he told himself, as a temporary measure.<br />
<br />
Just until Ethan could get the real thing back from Eric, and return his younger brother&#39;s pride and joy.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s lesson had to be learned, but it wasn&#39;t fair to either of them to stay separated from their rightful parts for THAT long.<br />
<br />
Was ... that right?<br />
<br />
Something about all of this was confusing and his brain felt foggy when he tried to grasp why, like part of the detail was wrong, but Ethan couldn&#39;t quite put his finger on what it was.<br />
<br />
Maybe it would come back to him later?<br />
<br />
Right now, he had a date with Lucas, and he was absolutely ready to get back to it!<br />
<br />
First though, he had to take care of his disguise. Ripping off a number of squares of toilet paper, he wadded it all up and stuffed it into his underwear, and then stood, pulling up his pants. Judging the crotch bulge to closely resemble what he had earlier, Ethan strode out of the restroom and back to his date, his new borrowed cock nestled safely in a thick layer of insulated padding.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
No sooner than Ethan sat back down in the darkened cinema, Lucas casually reached over, and their fingers slid together so they were holding hands again. Ethan&#39;s heart fluttered, and Lucas squeezed him gently, and then they were leaning together again. He felt far more comfortable now, completely at ease, and his nerves were only in anticipation, and hopefulness. They went back to watching the movie, and it didn&#39;t seem like Ethan had missed much.<br />
<br />
Then he felt a shoulder nudge, and a tug on his hand.<br />
<br />
Ethan turned his head, and Lucas was right there next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; he whispered, their faces really close, &quot;I was waiting for you to get back ... so I could do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas leaned in, and Ethan did the same.<br />
<br />
They met halfway<br />
<br />
His lips were warm, with a hint of soda, salted popcorn, and candy. A burst of fireworks went off inside Ethan&#39;s chest, and he pressed closer in emotional excitement as their tongues began to brush together, the kiss deepening. Lucas&#39; hand rose, rubbing his neck, stroking his ear. The cascade of sensations intensified and they began to make out properly, and all Ethan could think about was how alive he felt, how warm and happy this made him -- the slick wetness of Lucas&#39; mouth, how gentle and sensual his touches were, and not least how electrifying it all was.<br />
<br />
Kissing had never felt so stimulating, and it was like pure pleasure was flowing from his swirling tongue throughout his body. He could feel the pleasure dancing everywhere, shooting all around his body -- from his head to his toes, to his fingertips, to his chest -- it was magical and very very memorable.<br />
<br />
He was so into the moment that even Lucas&#39; hand touching his thigh, and then venturing into his crotch -- it didn&#39;t faze him at all. The hand squeezed the padding, mistaking the stuffing for a larger soft package, but underneath Ethan was growing even stiffer and more excited. Yet, he was small, contained, completely safe, and so comfortable that he even pushed into the petting grasp. The illusion was doing its job, and everything was such a thrilling turn-on, that time seemed to vanish into an endless series of soft lips and mashing tongues and oral friction, that went on and on and on, like a wonderful slow dance.<br />
<br />
It was some minutes later when they finally snapped out of it, as the music changed, and they separated to see the credits rolling down the screen.<br />
<br />
Grinning, the two boys stood, brushed themselves down, and made their way out of the cinema. Not a word was exchanged, but they kept glancing at each other, and once they exited the mall Lucas took his hand and they walked together through the parking lot to Ethan&#39;s car.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, um, I&#39;ll see you at school tomorrow?&quot; Lucas was trying not to smile, nor to prolong the goodbye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, tomorrow.&quot; Ethan opened his car door, feeling flushed but oh-so-good inside, guessing that the other boy had just as many positive feelings whirling around. He could practically see it. &quot;You&#39;ll txt me though, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely.&quot; Lucas nodded emphatically. &quot;I absolutely will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fantastic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, bye Lucas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye Ethan!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he got into the car, belted up, and turned the ignition. Smiling giddily, Ethan kept glancing in the rearview mirror at the retreating shape of his &#39;studly Prince Charming&#39; even as he turned out of the lot and started for home.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Entering the house, Ethan wandered through to his room, his thoughts full of how awesome, how exciting, how RIGHT the date had been. Sitting down on his bed, he finally remembered that he had something to take care of before the day was wrapped up neatly. It had slipped his mind for the moment, but that was okay, he could still return it before any harm was done. Reaching into his pocket, Ethan grasped for the cap, ready to swap back, and-<br />
<br />
... it wasn&#39;t there.<br />
<br />
What?<br />
<br />
The spot he&#39;d stashed it -- in his left jacket pocket -- was empty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no. No. I- ... I didn&#39;t. I can&#39;t have.&quot; Fear began rising within him, and Ethan stared ahead, eyes darting wildly in shock, as he wondered if there was any other explanation, any possible alternative. &quot;There&#39;s no way. It was there. It was right there!&quot;<br />
<br />
Not anymore.<br />
<br />
The cap -- just like a certain related long thick penis and pair of plump teenage balls -- was gone.<br />
<br />
Finally, his heart full of worry and confused despair, Ethan&#39;s gaze dropped to rest on the mocking rounded bump of his padded crotch, and his new little 10-year-old junk hidden within.</p>
