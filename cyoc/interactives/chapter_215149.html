<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mid way through his day he was in a much better mood. He had gotten two big jobs wrapped up and it was looking like he might make it home at a decent time. At that time he was passing through a small town and he thought that for once he might stop at the park and sit under a shade tree and enjoy his lunch before getting back to the daily grind. Spotting the small city park he eased the big truck into a slip. Shutting the truck down he eased out of the cab, sandwiches in hand. He then started to scope for a spot. Seeing that one was located relatively close to the truck he headed in that direction. Plopping down at the base of a big maple tree he leaned against the trunk feeling the cool damp ground welcome his body. Removing his sandwich from its bag he looked up and admired on how clean and well-kept the park was. The grass had been freshly mown and not a piece of trash was in sight. Even the five or six farmer’s market booths on the other side of the park looked well kept. Putting his full attention to his sandwich he devoured it, hardly tasting it. He then took a big gulp of the cool water from his thermos. Feeling sated he looked at his phone and seen that he still had over 20 minutes before he needed to get back to work. He decided that he may as well support the local businesses, and see what the tiny farmers market had to offer. Reaching the first booth he saw that they had homemade jams and honey. The older aged woman was sitting in a folding chair behind the table looking like everything was right in the world. Derick asked, “is this honey from your hives?” The old lady said with pride “absolutely home grown just outside of town here.” He then said “that’s great I’ll take one please. He handed the lady the cash and she said “thank you dear. Hope you have a good day.” He replied “you as well” and grabbed the bottle of honey and wandered to the next booth. A middle aged woman sat in a bean bag behind the table displaying necklaces and rings. Not very interested in such he gave her a smile and continued to walk to the remaining booths. “May I interest you in something for your lady sir? Questioned the shop keeper behind the table. To which Derick replied. “Sorry, but I have none.” She then replied, At least let me give you a palm reading then.” No charge.” Looking at his phone again and determining that he had time he replied. “Okay, But I can’t stay long” She then indicated for him to sit at a chair next to the table and place his hands palm up on top of two purple pillows. The shop keeper then ran an index finger down many of his lines on his palms pausing at any intersection. He looked up and could see the lady was quite focused at this and didn’t even notice his quick glance upwards. He remarked that she was so gentle and here finger tips were very soft. She then seemed to come to a conclusion and stopped. “Interesting, very interesting.” She said slowly. What’s interesting? He asked. “Tush! Tush!” was the reply and then after a pause. It appears that you have worked hard for most your life. Devoting yourself to your work, more than yourself. He started to speak and once again the lady shushed him into silence. “It appears that you have a deep desire to find some-one to hold close. And you worry often that there is no one in this world that understands or relates to you. I see that you have tried in the past to hold some one, but for reasons or another things did not work out. This has led to resentment towards your work and depression.” She then paused. “You feel like you can never find the true one to love.” An actual tear was forming at her crease of her eye. Astonished he could only watch in amazement as she continued. “I feel stress. Stress caused from several directions, most formed from feeling overworked, and not appreciated.” “Wait!” He almost yelled. The startled the woman fell quiet. “ I do feel appreciated by my friends and family.” “Do you?” she replied. “I only see stress that is undeniably from friends and family?” To which he remarked. “That I agree with, but not from being un appreciated.” She then questioned. “But you feel that even when you are with your friends all the responsibility falls on you to make them happy? Am I wrong?” Astonished he replied. “No that’s entirely true.” She then gave him a wink. “This old woman has been around more than a little while dear.” She replied. “So what am I supposed to do with this information?” “Not to sound rude, but I do give you credit on being right on many aspects.” She almost giggled saying. “Humble I see too.” “I appreciate that in a man. Tell you what, I have something that will help you.” With a mild chuckle he commented. “I doubt that you have anything that will cure my problems mam.” All She said was Stay there. As she turned around and set an old wooden box on the table. “Let me see.” As she opened the lid and started to sort through the contents. “Ah, ha. Found it!” She exclaimed with a with a flash of a wicked grin on her face. Not knowing if he truly seen the expression, he accepted the coin that had a leather neckless through a hole in the coin. “Please take this free of charge!” She said proudly. Curious he asked. Whats this supposed to do? She grinned. “Well now you will just have to see, now won’t you?” “Just keep it close and it will work.” “Don’t lose it please.”  She implored. Not knowing what she was about, he placed the neckless around his neck. She then exclaimed . “Great! See you around please stop by again!” Then when he blinked. She was Gone. Astonishment showed plainly on his face and he looked right and left to look for the shop keeper. It was only once he looked back at the bean bag that he saw it. A note card sized sign was sitting there informing any patrons that she would be returning soon. He then seen a business card sitting on the table. Standing up he grabbed one and examined it. It read. Cerci’s Secrets. A phone number was not listed just an address of 249 Babylon bill rd. playing this off as some magic trick he chuckled and said. Fitting and placed the card in his pocket without even realizing it. He then walked back to his truck and continued through his day as if nothing had happened. But something did happen. Midway through the afternoon Derick wrapped up with his last project. Putting his equipment away in the truck his phone rang. Automatically Derick hit the button on his head set even before the 2nd ring. Turns out that the caller was his boss. His boss had called to tell him that he had been doing such a great job that he had finished all of the jobs for the day. Curious he inquired about the next job that he thought that he had lined up for next. His boss just simply replied that the customer had called and asked to be moved to the next week. Derick thought that this was odd especially for a Friday afternoon. However he said “Okay, see ya next week and hung up.” Not wanting to hang on the phone for any longer than he had too. Incase his boss changed his mind last minute.” On the way home traffic seemed lighter than normal and he only hit two stop lights. Amazed at his good luck noting that this never happens. He was in a better mood than normal when he stepped out of his truck in front of his house. It did not take long after he had shut his truck off when Remmy barreled around the house and into the front yard. She then proceeded to unlock the gate and greet Derick as he was walking up to the gate. “Well, Hello whoos a good girl”. Remmy just sat there taking all of the attention that he gave her. After several minutes of ear scratching and belly rubs, he proceeded to the door. Walking into his house he looked at the wall clock. “Wow that does not happen very often. 2:30. That has to be a record for a Friday! I guess that charm was good luck after all he said pulling the neckless from under his shirt. He examined it for a second noting that it looked like a late 1900s 50c piece. But it was different with the markings. It had a imprint of a wolf howling on the front and a 3 pointed star on the back. Odd he said reflectively setting it on the side table sitting in his sofa chair. Something about the coin got Remmys attention. She came over and was sniffing at it on the edge of the table. Picking it up he showed it to here. She sniffed it for a couple second longer and sat right in front of him. She then put a paw on his right knee. You want something? The dog just seemed to look right at the coin. Odd he said. Here you go and placed it around her neck. Seeming contented the dog got up and laid on her dog bed on the other side of the room. “Huh, weird.” He remarked. With it being too early for the news Derick thought he would get some chores done. Contentedly he did this until it was time for dinner. Pulling the steak out of the oven it seemed to be perfect. He sat back down with his plate in his chair and enjoyed the meal. He then proceeded to put the remaining steak in Remmys bowl which she thoroughly enjoyed. The rest of his evening went like it had the past 5 years. Shower, ablutions, and bed. Laying down in his bed Remmy jumped up and laid against him. He could hear the crickets chirping out his window and the swamp cooler pumping outs its wet cool air. With a grin he nodded off to sleep. It was then that the coin neckless started to softly glow a dim amber. It did this for several second then went out. It sat cold and lifeless around the dogs neck. Several hours passed until it was the early hours of the morning before anything out of the normal started to happen. Derick and Remmy were snoring softly Derick was laid on his side with his arm resting over Remmy. Remmy was laid into Derricks lap and chest. Tail between Derricks legs. Suddenly the coin neckless started to pulse a royal purple. Then something started to happen to Remmy. Remmy started to whimper and bark in her dreams as changes started to occur. Her skull started to increase in size until it was taller than normal. Her hips popped and widened. Back legs lengthened and straightened, bones and ligaments changing shape. Remmy started to softly whine in her sleep and then fell quiet. Her chest front shoulders pushed back and to the side as her chest widened. Front legs becoming longer with different joints forming. Paws then turned into what looked like feet and hands. These new tools did not appear like normal feet and hands by human standards. They still had rough pads on the bottom sides of the appendages and the toes were slightly webbed. Claws still on the tip of each finger. Then the dew claws moved down towards the feet and hands growing into apposable thumbs and big toe. Derick started to slightly rouse. Feeling the body next to him seem different. Still deeply in a dream he felt these new shapes as being romantic and slowly moved his hands along the body, exploring. But something did not feel right. While Derick’s sleepy mind started throwing alarm bells with no signals, the changes were starting to slow down. Remmy’s throat started to form vocal cords, and something in her lower belly started to change. Suddenly it was over as fast as it had began and Remmy started to rouse. She shifted and let out a audible “uhherr.” The confused bells in derricks mind upon hearing this final noise was enough to cause him to open his eyes and groan. Taking in a large deep breath he stretched and patted his trusty companion gently. He then stopped. What was this fur covered being next to him? Surly this did not feel like his Remmy who had been sleeping next to him. Confused and concerned he called softly Remmy come! Suddenly the being next to him started to move. Afraid of what lurked in the dark he quickly fumbled for the light on his night stand. Turning it on, he was not prepared for what he saw. Remmy had rolled over to face him by the time that the light had turned on and the warm light washed over her new body. Derick sat trying to process if this was real. It cant be, can it? No way! How? Many more questions flashed through his mind but there sat an anthropomorphic being on his bed. Finally the gears slowed and he slowly started to calm. He then called again “Remmy?” The being on his bed responded by moving towards him then stopping and looking confused. It then started to look at itself and look bewildered on its own. Suddenly it spoke “Wa-what…Ha-hap-happened t-to m-m-me?” Shocked Derick could only sit there for several second as the German Sheppard head and just spoke. Then “What h-happened to m-me?” That unfroze Derick. He asked. “Is that you Remmy?” The anthropomorphic dog looked right at him again confused. “H-How y-you understand?” Derick replied. “How do you Talk?” Remmy sat there for several minuets apparently trying to make sense out of what had happened. Derick finally asked. “Remmy, are you okay?” Feeling completely awkward on how he was trying to have a conversation with his dog. Remmy slowly replied. “F-Feel Okay.” Derick finally noticed that the coin was still there, around Remmys neck. “No way!” He exclaimed. Shocked Remmy asked “W-what?” Derick replied. “It has to be the coin!” Remmy looked down and saw the neckless below her neck. She then instinctually reached for it with a newly formed hand and grasped it. Then yanked her hand away and held it up in front of her face examining it. “You have hands!” Derick exclaimed as he pulled the blanket away revealing her new feet. Remmy then looked down out her new feet. She then passed out. And fell back on the bed. Derick shocked still himself then huddled over Remmy examining her. Once he determined that she was still alive and had only passed out. He started to examine her entire body closely. Fur still covered all of her body and all of the original markings were still in place. From the black stripe up her back to the blond on her muzzle, belly and chest. The Tail was still there and appeared to be slightly longer, the hips were wider however not completely human. The sex was still intact as a dogs and the nipples were still placed as such. The chest was completely different and resembled a skinny man’s chest with no breasts only fur and human shoulder blades. The arms resembled furry female arms nicely toned and muscled, just like the legs. They looked athletic, but not stocky. Her neck had slimmed down slightly and the skull appeared to be larger. Not overly such. But Derick wondered if a larger brain resided inside. He sat there and pondered for several minutes then it hit him. How was he going to conceal this? He could not just keep her in the house her rest of her life. And eventually his friends or family would start to ask about her. He finally decided to file that away for a later time. That’s when he looked at the clock. 4:00am. Maybe he would lie down and get up at 6 and this would all be back the way it used to be. He turned the lamp off and laid down to the new body next to him. He listened to the soft breathing and finally nodded off.</p>
