<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Louis&#39;s Collected Souls<br />
Wolf, Orc, Dragon<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
     Unfortunately for Louis, he didn&#39;t spot anything of interest for about two hours. The excitement and wonder of flight had worn off by now and Louis was getting bored. He had eventually descended slightly in order to see the ground more quickly and was very disappointed. The only signs of civilization was the northern road, but he had seen nothing else. No towns, cities, not even a shack. <br />
<br />
           Louis had started to feel something different too. The air was getting warmer, more humid as he flew. Below him the ground turned from forest and grass, to dense underbrush and tall trees. Louis couldn&#39;t even see the roadbow .He was flying above a jungle!<br />
<br />
   Louis had heard stories of jungles. Old men would tell about stories of fierce jungle predators and ancient cities of gold and sliver. Stories about mythical monsters like hint cobras and even the infamous Gorgons, women who could turn even the strongest of warriors to stone.<br />
<br />
                 Maybe this was the adventure he wanted? <br />
<br />
       Louis shifted his wings and began a graceful descend downwards. Enjoying the feeling of the air against his scales. There was no where he could safely land and Louis wasn&#39;t too keen on creating a forest fire so instead he looked around and found a small lake he could land on. <br />
<br />
     Louis landed on the lake and quickly transformed back into his human form. The surprisingly warm water soothed Louis&#39;s skin. Louis got out of the water and examined his surroundings. From airview the jungle didn&#39;t look that big, but now that he was a regular human the giant tress towered over him like giants. <br />
<br />
           Then he felt the orc come closer into his mind and give him some advice.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Be careful of jungles. There are many dangers to watch out for, fish that can devour a orc in seconds, cats that can shred steel, bugs that can drain all the blood in you with a single heartbeat.&quot;<br />
<br />
     Louis gulped. The orc was right, he was inexperienced with jungles, he would have to proceed with caution. <br />
<br />
      Louis waded through the water to shore and after drying off, put on his clothes, feeling more secure as he adjusted his scabbard onto his back. He began his exploration into the jungle, quickly being consumed by the thick leaves and underbrush. Movement was slow and difficult.  Several times his legs scratched against thorns and vines and the air was practically flooded with mosquitoes and insects. Despite this, Louis also saw the beauty of the jungle as well. Colorful birds flew above him, and the insects almost formed a melody with their chipping and chirping. <br />
<br />
<br />
      Louis kept walking by after several minutes of traveling he had the uneasy sense he was being watched. He wasn&#39;t sure why. But it felt like several eyes were watching him. He slowly readied his hand closer to his scabbard in case he needed to draw his sword quickly.<br />
<br />
    Then out of the corner of his eye Louis saw a black flash move across the trees. Louis instinctively drew his sword which in his current form was still too heavy, though that could change in an instant.<br />
<br />
   Then out of the bushes, like a predator was giant feline beast. Large sharp teeth and a midnight black coat, it was much bigger than the wolf and seemed a lot fiercer. The most worrying thing however, was the green fluids that tiped it&#39;s sharp teeth. Is it poisonous? Louis thought.<br />
<br />
    It growled and hissed at him. And slowly it started inching closer and closer to Louis . He watched it carefully. If it managed to bite him, chances he wouldn&#39;t survive. Who knows what&#39;s kind of venom those teeth could have. Would it paralyze you? Or maybe it would just straight out kill you. <br />
<br />
     The panther growled once more and lunged. Louis quickly rolled to the side, missing it&#39;s claws by a couple of inches. Louis stood up and before it could react gave it a long slash through it&#39;s side. The panther hissed in pain, and started clawing at him. Louis  managed to dodge most of them, but one of its sharp deadly claws raked across his harm, making Louis grit his teeth in pain as he felt blood starting to ooze from the wound. Louis then did his counter attack. <br />
<br />
    He brought the wolf out and started to jump. Midair his face turned into a muzzle and fur coated his body in nearly a instant. In Louis&#39;s wolf form, he jumped over the panther using the panther&#39;s surprise of seeing Louis become a canine and then transformed back into his normal self, albeit with his clothes littered around him and picking up his sword began a series of slashes and swipes against the panther&#39;s behind. The panther roared in pain and before it could try and attack, Louis with a mighty thrust, plunged his sword into the panther&#39;s thick hide, killing it instantly.<br />
<br />
    The panther&#39;s body fell to the floor, limp and dead, Louis could still feel the panther. Another soul had joined him now.<br />
<br />
      Louis after redressing and putting his sword back into his scabbard left the panther&#39;s corpse and made his way forward. By now he has lost all directions while in the forest so he walked forward hoping to find something. The panther in his mind was quite loud and unruly though it seemed to be welcomed by the other souls in his mind, specifically the wolf.<br />
<br />
           Louis figured he like the rest of his souls needed to be let out before the panther would quiet down. Though he wanted to do it later, right now Louis wanted to explore.</p>
