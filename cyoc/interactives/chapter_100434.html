<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad knows that he still has friends that are still around in the neighbor hood and decides to call them. He picked up Bruno&#39;s home phone and dialed in Kayne&#39;s phone number and waits for the call as the phone rings. Suddenly, an answer on the phone, &quot;Hello?&quot; Kayne asks what sounds like he was doing his late night work out. Chad replies, &quot;Hey Kayne! I need your help with something, and I need Jack and Erico over at Bruno&#39;s house. I&#39;ll explain the details later, just get here soon.&quot; Kayne paused for a moment, &quot;O..Kay. I&#39;ll take a shower and I&#39;ll be there with the others.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay! I&#39;ll be waiting!&quot; He said chirpily which made Kayne wonder if he&#39;s okay as he hangs up. (What the hell is up with Chad?)<br />
<br />
A shower and an hour later, Kayne, Jack, and Erico shows up at Bruno&#39;s house. &quot;So, what did Chad want us to help him out for?&quot; Erico asked Kayne. &quot;I don&#39;t know, he said he&#39;ll explain when we get to Bruno&#39;s house. I wonder why he&#39;s here at Bruno&#39;s house?&quot; Kayne replies as they soon step at the front door and Kayne knocked on the door and wait for an answer. &quot;Just a sec guys! I&#39;ll open the door soon!&quot; Chad called out on the other side of the door. Soon, the front door was open and Chad wearing the purple zentai was standing in the front door. &quot;Who the hell are you?! You&#39;re not Chad!&quot; Jack said. &quot;It is me! I&#39;m wearing a zentai suit!&quot; Chad said. The three of them were weirded out, &quot;Okay, what is it that you want us to help on?&quot; Kayne asked as Chad showed them why. They were astonished on what they saw. Rubber statues that were locked in erotic positions or in fleeing positions and were still moaning and squirming. &quot;What the- are these all real?!&quot; Erico asked in awe. &quot;Yup!&quot;<br />
&quot;Do we have to move these?! It&#39;ll take forever!&quot; Jack exclaimed. &quot;No you don&#39;t have to.&quot; Chad replied in a normal tone. Erico went up to one of the rubber statues and hears their erotic moans and notices little tremors  on the surface of their rubber bodies. &quot;This is some weird shit man. What the hell happened here? I thought Bruno was hosting a party?&quot;<br />
&quot;He did but it was ruined by Rick&#39;s plan that got backfired. And now I have the power to turn people into rubber statue like these poor bastards or turn them into my living zentai suit that I&#39;m wearing.&quot; Chad explained and then added, &quot;And I know you guys are good friends with me, and I want you guys to be apart of my living zentai guards and help my revenge on those that were apart of Rick&#39;s plan!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kayne and the others were startled about Chad&#39;s new found powers of turning people into suits or statues but after realizing how bad it must&#39;ve gotten to him that he wanted to leave and doesn&#39;t want to be a part of this crazy scheme. &quot;So you want us to be your living zentai suit slave like that poor guy you&#39;re wearing and help create your own collection of... these?&quot; Kayne asked. &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;What? We don&#39;t get to wear one but we have to be one? That&#39;s seems fucked up turning your friends into whatever they&#39;re called.&quot; Jack remarks but then decides, &quot;But I guess I&#39;ll join in. It&#39;s not like I have a choice, right?&quot; Kayne and Erico were shocked to hear that.  Chad was happy to hear his acceptance. &quot;Anyone else?&quot; he asks. Soon, Erico sighs and accepts it too. &quot;I don&#39;t have a choice either. Besides, I always like being a lackey.&quot; Erico says with a bit of a smile on his face just to lighten up the mood a bit. Then they look at Kayne, who was still deciding on what to do. He wanted to leave, but if he has the power to transform people into those things, then he might be able to control the statues that is inside the room where they stand. In other words, he&#39;s fucked. Soon he submits, &quot;Fine, I don&#39;t have any other choice. Besides you might have me turn into those rubber freaks in this room if I don&#39;t join so I won&#39;t tell.&quot; Chad chuckles mischievously, &quot;Yup. But don&#39;t worry, you guys won&#39;t be in the closet when we&#39;re done with my revenge that were in Rick&#39;s plan, you&#39;ll be placed in somewhere special.&quot; It sounded corny and weird for Kayne but he doesn&#39;t have a choice as Chad ordered them to strip naked. Kayne and Jack were blushing and hesitated for a moment and noticed Erico already done and waited for his change and they soon followed. Since Erico went first, Chad decided to turn him into his living zentai suit slave. &quot;Turn around,&quot; ordered Chad as Erico soon turned one-eighty degrees. Chad then place a finger on top of Erico&#39;s head and ran it all the way down to his spine above his lower back, above his butt. Soon, a zipper track appears where Chad ran his finger on Erico&#39;s back which made him shiver as Jack and Kayne look on shock and awe as they can see green color replace his human skin tone as it becomes spandex and spreads on his back. To increase the change further, Chad then rubs  Erico&#39;s legs, crotch and chest erotically, and can hear the purple suit moan in arousal as the changes shows up on where Chad touched him. Erico&#39;s stiff member soon shrinks into his crotch leaving it smooth and then becomes a bulge as it becomes a bit... bulgier. The spread went down to his feet as it becomes spandex and his toes fuse together. &quot;Feels good doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Chad asks in Erico&#39;s ear. &quot;Yeah..~ It does.&quot; Erico replies in daze as he enjoys his change already the spandex made his body smooth and featureless and already took all of his body and only leaving his head, already, his hair is gone. His mouth then seals up and leave no sign of a mouth anymore as the nose and ears soon follow. And then finally, his eyes close shut and his face smooths out leaving no evidence at all. He left his zipper alone and orders him to look at him and lift his left foot for Chad. Erico then lifts his left toeless foot up feeling his spandex contact with his spandex on his foot and moans in pleasure and then Chad traces letters on the sole of his foot engraving, &quot;ZENTAI ERICO, FRIEND, AND PROPERTY OF CHAD&quot; Erico then puts down his foot and stands there wait for Chad&#39;s orders. Of course, Chad knows Erico still remembers who he is, but he doesn&#39;t care and only serves Chad. He then went to Jack as his change was the same but a different color/pattern, which is a snake pattern and ordered him the same thing he said to Erico, to lift his foot as he engraves the same words but with his name on it. Finally, it is Kayne&#39;s turn. Before he becomes his slave, he asks Chad, &quot;I know we&#39;re your slaves now, but. We&#39;ll still be friends right?&quot; Chad didn&#39;t reply as Kayne sighs as his friend and now owner starts his transformation. His spandex color/pattern is a shiny gold tone and did the same thing as he did to Jack&#39;s and Erico&#39;s foot.<br />
<br />
Chad feels a bit guilty about turning his friends, but ignores it for now as he orders his zentai friends/slaves, &quot;Ok you guys, here&#39;s your orders. go to Rick&#39;s house and find those he has collaborated with and either bring them here or turn them into zentai suits like you or statues for my collection, I will return home and convert my brother. Now go!&quot; The three of them soon walk to the door in a drone like fashion before Chad leaves as the trio soon walk into the night in the neighbor hood to Rick&#39;s house to find their targets of conversion/transformation.</p>
