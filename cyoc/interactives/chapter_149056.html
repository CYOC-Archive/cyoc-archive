<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heiya Island was very different from Mieni in various ways. Unlike the previous stop on the tour group&#39;s world tour, Heiya Island was a singular volcanic island rather than a collection of small islands that made up the coral atoll. And unlike Mieni, which seemed built almost exclusively for tourism, Heiya seemed built more to function as an actual colony that would be habitable for various residents, and like much of the group, the Hanson sextuplets were quite curious about the island as it was a place they&#39;d never seen before. And while their double dosing had given them the bodies of adult Horse Animalians and the other effects of being double dosed had also lead to them exhibiting signs of maturity that most people wouldn&#39;t expect if they knew the age of the six Horse Animalians, new things were always interesting.<br />
<br />
As such while some of the martial arts themed matches in terms of skills was interesting, the first thing the six of them did was largely to explore and see what was about the island, along with an invitation offered to another member of the colony tour group.<br />
<br />
&quot;You would like me to come with you?&quot; Adi asked as she looked to the male that had asked her outside to explore the island.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes,&quot; Damien said slowly rubbing one hoof against the carpet and looking down, &quot;Everything is so new here... I... we...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We thought it would be nice to get a look at everything they have to show,&quot; Faye commented, &quot;it doesn&#39;t have to be swimming or the like... I think the guide on the plane said the water would be colder here than it was at Mieni... but they do have some supposedly nice views to look over things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adi nodded and held up a finger as she returned into her room to collect something before they headed out. The Hansons quietly waited in the hallway, though Blythe, Coye, and Faye did resist the urge to giggle. They all knew that their three brothers had at least a passing interest in Adi, as she was the only adult Horse Animalian that they knew was single and in some ways they could sympathize. There were various times in Lyre where they had seen Abby walking with Samson and were a bit jealous that she had a strong and gentle stallion on her arm. In this, Adi was someone that their brothers would have some interest in, and if they were all normal horses rather than converted humans, a single mare like Adi probably would prompt fights between the three stallions over breeding rights. But the Hansons were all Animalians and converted Humans as well. Thus fighting was really out of the question, and Faye was fairly certain her brothers wouldn&#39;t fight each other over Adi. Though there would also be the issue that Adi was also a converted Human and might not be that open to any real advances from the three male Hansons, simply for the fact the Hansons were adults thanks to being double dosed. This had made some of the interactions a bit awkward at times, regardless of how often the brothers tried to offer some friendly conversation.<br />
<br />
However, before they could get any further than suppressing the urge to tease their brothers, Adi returned to the doorway and came out, shutting the door behind her. She then gave a small smile, though this seemed more politely aimed to Coye, Blythe, and Faye than to Abraham, Damien, and Elijah. As the door clicked shut Adi brushed off her clothing before addressing the group.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I am ready and things are in order,&quot; Adi spoke, &quot;What would you like to see first? I&#39;ve been told some of the martial arts skill challenges that are part of IAC will be at the main dojo complex they&#39;ve built here. Did you have interest in that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of that might be a bit interesting...&quot; Damien managed, &quot;though I think it&#39;d be nicer just to get a look around the island.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Supposedly they&#39;ve set up farms here on the main parts of the island,&quot; Abraham commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that could be interesting to see how the Animalians here live,&quot; Blythe added, &quot;I don&#39;t think they grow apples like the Browns do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And their highest point supposedly has a good viewpoint for much of the sea around the island,&quot; Elijah added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might be a place you&#39;d want to bring someone special to in the future,&quot; Coye added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then... let us go,&quot; Adi answered<br />
<br />
And so the group went with Adi found herself playing the role of friend and chaperone. Though it wasn&#39;t quite as though the six Hansons actually needed a formal chaperone. They&#39;d actually acted with the same sort of maturity that she would expect from most people that were kind and respectful. The three males were kind and in a way were handsome, though they were likely Quarter Horses as most of the Horse Animalians seemed to be and thus were a bit bigger than her, as she was an Arabian Horse Animalian. She had also noticed some of their nervousness around her, though, likely that they were interested, which was rather flattering. And the fact that all of them had been respectful to her had given her enough confidence to talk with them, but for the moment, things felt more like being with family and friends and that was something better than a romantic attraction.<br />
<br />
The tour looked over many of the sights in the main built up areas around Heiya Island, starting with the government areas for the colony where the Chinese and Japanese Embassies were and the main &quot;palace&quot; area that was set up for the colony government. It created some voiced awe and Adi even took some pictures of the Hansons that they could share with their parents when they eventually returned to Lyre/Animalia.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of the different building designs look rather neat,&quot; Abraham commented off hand as he looked between the Japanese and Chinese embassies on the island. Both had designs that wouldn&#39;t look out of place in their respective country&#39;s capital cities.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Heiya Island is part of Japan, and Japan and China are different from the US,&quot; Faye commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dino City has different designs than Lyre does and its in America,&quot; Blythe commented, &quot;You saw the Animalia Ambassadoria video... where the two Pterosaurs were in Dino City...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, they were in Lyre,&quot; Faye answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you tell?&quot; Damien wondered suspiciously of his sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Horizon sign behind Sophie, Roland, JC, Pauline and Hazel listed their main headquarters address in Lyre, Nevada,&quot; Faye answered, &quot;the one behind Arcelia... the Archaeopteryx Dinotopian had the new Horizon office address in Dino City, Texas. It was all done in split screen. They likely said they were &quot;in&quot; Dino City because of the fact that Horizon is transferring many of the rarer and less popular Dinotopian strains to Dino City. Thus if one wanted to join and become something... like... well... a Dinosaur everyone doesn&#39;t know... they&#39;d go to Dino City where the samples will be moved to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense...&quot; Abraham said slowly, &quot;though... Blythe is right that their design is very different from Lyre...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is likely something that is a result of the theme for the colony,&quot; Adi spoke up, offering her two cents on the discussion, &quot;pictures from New Zerzura, which may be one of the next colonies we see... either that or Maelewano… according to the schedule... show that the Egyptian colony has a lot of its architecture borrowing a lot from Ancient Egypt, which is actually rather different from modern Egyptian architecture. Which would show some theme to it. Dino City likely has a very similar theme idea... do something that would play to what people would think of with the Pre-Historic Era.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Hansons all nodded to that and from there the tour continued. It took a fair amount of walking, though Adi had long found that her endurance had increased greatly as a result of her conversion. The countryside away from the village on Heiya Island looked nice and the farms that had been started to raise meat for carnivorous Animalians looked to be doing okay and the arrangement of farms to grow crops for herbivorous Animalians also looked quite well. They eventually made their way up the slop to the island&#39;s tallest peak and made it onto observation platform that made up the top portion. The direction and distance signs garnered some attention, but it was ultimate the view of the island and the sea that surrounded it that actually drew the most awe from all of them. Especially with the noted difference in the color of the sea than from Mieni. <br />
<br />
At Mieni, the water was a very light blue and practically clear in the shallows. At Heiya Island, the waters were much darker and the sound of the waves hitting the rocks and shore sounded much rougher. And yet, it was in an odd way peaceful and earned a new round of pictures, including one that was set on a timer and had Adi in with Hansons as well, with Damien and Coye beside her. Blythe and Abraham kneeling in front of them and with Elijah and Faye on the outer edges.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for coming with us, Adi,&quot; Damien managed with a small smile to the Arabian mare.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Adi answered, &quot;you and your brothers have been most polite and your sisters have been fun to talk with as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though we&#39;re...&quot; Damien said slowly, &quot;technically... kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your country&#39;s laws have recognized double dosed Animalians as legal adults, yes?&quot; Adi asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Elijah nodded, &quot;though there have been some who want to lay their Puritan stick in the mud and demand that everyone abide by their standard... even though we are physically mature... and we&#39;ve actually helped our folks out with their jobs and some odd tasks here and there hat Horizon may need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand some deciding to be extremely restrictive with certain biases,&quot; Adi admitted. While she was loyal to her faith and the faith she had grown up in, her family had never been truly conservative Muslims, as were those that ran Saudi Arabia. They had viewed things in a more secular lens, and while she might still stand behind certain Islamic laws fairly firmly, it was more of her personal choice and freedom to do so and interpret her faith in her own way, not the way some ISL fanatic decided how she should. &quot;That&#39;ll just be one of those things where you may just have to accept that some people will be what they will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elijah nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in the end, when I first met you, you were already double dosed,&quot; Adi answered, &quot;so... while your story is a bit... atypical when compared to mine... I know you as you are now. Three gentlemanly stallions and three honest and friendly mares... and a happy family. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll all make someone very happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re not troubled by us personally?&quot; Damien asked sounding hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Adi gave a smile and patted his shoulder, &quot;right now... you and your siblings are excellent friends and I am glad to know you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damien managed a weak smile as Adi then moved over to look to something that had caught Blythe&#39;s attention and thought to himself, &quot;there&#39;s hope...&quot;</p>
