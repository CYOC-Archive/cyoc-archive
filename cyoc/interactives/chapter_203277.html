<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy felt her nipples spring erect, all while her teats swelled up and everything became so… sore.  Was this was it felt like to go into heat? <br />
<br />
Troy didn’t have to wait long before her questioned was answered by the feeling of a tremendous amount of pressure in her lower abdomen.  It was a combination of muscle cramp, tightness, and tissue compression that felt almost like she had to take the biggest shit of her life.  But as the pressure grew, Troy began to feel something else… moving inside of her.<br />
<br />
It started as a squirming.  Then came a kick.  Then came the feeling of a dozen different objects, all squirming and kicking.  And as they kicked and squirmed they also grew.  Troy could feel her stomach bloating out, both sinking down and widening as the new puppies grew inside of her.<br />
<br />
As the puppies grew, Troy felt everything in there getting stretched out to the point of tearing.  Her abdominal muscles were so tight that they began pulling on her chest, pulling it down towards her crotch and forcing her into a slightly hunched stance.  Meanwhile, the new weight on her rear limbs began taxing those as well, causing her to enter a half squatted position.  <br />
<br />
While she hadn’t entered that position voluntarily, it did cause her chest to arch down some more, helping to relieve the tightness in her stomach and making her new, uncomfortable existences slightly more tolerable.<br />
<br />
But it wasn’t long until Troy found out about the downside of the squat.  As the puppies finished growing, gravity took over.  With her hips now the lowest point in her new, bitch body, the puppies shifted from being pulled down against her skin to “falling” into her pelvic region, painfully squeezing her insides against her hip bones.<br />
<br />
Then came the pressure they placed on her small, doggy bladder.  As it was squished against her hip bones, Troy found the sudden need to urinate overwhelming.  It wasn’t long before she couldn’t hold it in anymore and the urine was literally forced from her body by one of her puppy’s kicks.  <br />
<br />
Troy had expected a gush of fluid to result from the loss of control over her bladder but only a few small drops came out.  Evidently there hadn’t been much in there to begin with, which only served to demonstrate to Troy just how much space the new puppies were taking up inside of her.<br />
<br />
Troy felt another kick that “popped” something inside of her.  A brief feeling of confusion came over her as another small trickle of fluid came out of her vagina, although this time it felt like it came out of a slightly different hole…<br />
<br />
Lightning flowed through Troy’s stomach as every muscle tightened to the point of agony and began squeezing down on the bundle of puppies inside of her.  Unfortunately for Troy, all that managed to accomplish was smashing the lead puppy against a wall of tough, fibrous flesh – her cervix, Troy realized.<br />
<br />
The force of the puppy against her cervix was unbearable, but Troy couldn’t stop the muscles from pushing.  She couldn’t even lessen the intensity.  It was like her lower half just had a mind of its own and it was dead set on forcing her puppies through a tightly closed hole.<br />
<br />
To her relief, it didn’t take long before she felt a ring begin to open up where the puppy’s head was pressing in.  Painfully, the ring grew larger and larger until she could feel the puppy begin to slip out through it.  She could feel its head pass through, only for it to briefly get stuck on its shoulders before they, too, passed down into her pelvis.<br />
<br />
As the puppy worked its way down, tight, muscular walls both stretched to allow its passage while squeezing to force it further down.<br />
<br />
Millimeter by millimeter the puppy descended further into her pelvis, making slow, painful progress.  At about a third of the way down, Troy felt the puppy’s skull begin to collide with her femurs, all while a wave of intense exhaustion began to wash over her.<br />
<br />
Whimpering in pain, Troy collapsed over onto her right side.  She felt her left leg involuntarily lift up, and the puppy slipped in between her leg bones to continue its journey towards her moist cunt.<br />
<br />
At the halfway point, Troy felt herself stop stretching as the puppy’s head came to rest, despite the continuing contraction that was racking her body.  The contraction stopped a few seconds later, though to Troy it certainly felt like it took a lot longer. <br />
<br />
Her mind began to panic as she felt the puppy begin to slip back up into her.  <br />
<br />
“No!” came an instinctual thought, “I got it so far, don’t let it slip back in!”<br />
<br />
Fortunately for Troy, her belly was so fully of other puppies that it only managed to slip back a tiny bit before the presence of its siblings prevented it from sliding back anymore.<br />
<br />
With the contractions stopped, Troy looked up at RK and gave him the most pathetic, “help me” look and whine that she could.  But RK wasn’t looking at her with pity.  Instead, he seemed to be quite inquisitive about her new situation.  Troy noticed RK looking at her neck as she realized the final changes were taking place.<br />
<br />
A collar with a tag formed around her neck, while the room shifted slightly.  The furniture was all mostly the same, just in different positions and with slightly different accents.  Troy was in the same house, more or less, but instead of being his old house, it was now her new owner’s.</p>
