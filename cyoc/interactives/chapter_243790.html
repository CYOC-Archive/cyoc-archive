<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucy grins when an idea pops into her mind, the girl gives herself powerful magic abilities, moaning in pleasure as she feels the energy fill her. The 12-year-old grins, ‘I feel so powerful,’ she thinks to herself, giggling, she then turns to the “underwear” still lying on the floor, ‘I’ll leave Jeff and wait until he reverts back into his boring old self, THEN the fun can begin,’ the girl then simply walks out the room, but not before she deletes her file from the program, erasing all evidence.<br />
<br />
‘Phew, she hasn’t figured it out,’ Jeff thinks to himself as he hears his door close and the footsteps of his sister becoming quieter as she walks away, ‘I can’t wait for the 48 hours to be over soon’.<br />
<br />
Finally, Jeff feels a tingling sensation in his fabric body, he then feels his “body” warp and morph, ‘finally, I’m going to be my normal self again,’ he thinks to himself, mentally smiling as he feels the “panties” and “bra” merge together as he feels his arms, legs and head regrow.<br />
<br />
An hour later, Jeff is back to normal, the naked teen slowly gets to his feet, his legs wobble, “whoa, having limbs again feels so weird,” the teen mumbles to himself, “being a bra and panty set for so long caused me to slowly forget who and what I truly am, well… lesson learned”. Jeff quickly gets changed and decides to take a walk after shutting off his computer.<br />
<br />
As Jeff steps out the house, he doesn’t notice Lucy watching him out of her window, the 12-year-old grinning to herself, “I’ll give him a week to “relax” before I start with having some fun with him,” she says to herself.<br />
<br />
The week passes with Lucy acting as though everything is normal, Jeff is unaware that his life will become a little different very soon.<br />
<br />
That Saturday, when their parents are running errands, Lucy heads to Jeff’s room and knocks on the door, “Jeff, can I talk to you for a second,” she asks.<br />
<br />
The 12-year-old hears her brother let out a sigh, “alright, fine! But make it quick,” she then hears Jeff say.<br />
<br />
Lucy opens the door and steps into Jeff’s room, rolling her eyes when she notices Jeff sitting in front of his PlayStation, “oh, sorry, didn’t know you were… busy,” the girl giggles.<br />
<br />
Jeff rolls his eyes, “just say what you want to say, then let me get back to my game,” he says, “I had a stressful week”.<br />
<br />
“Do you remember all those mean things you said and did to me for being “weird” as you say,” Lucy asks.<br />
<br />
“Oh, come on, Lucy,” Jeff says, “that was just me being a stupid kid”.<br />
<br />
“You have no idea how I felt,” Lucy continues, “if it only would have been a one-time-thing, I MIGHT just let it go. However, for four whole years you continued being mean to me!”<br />
<br />
“Look, I’m sorry, okay,” Jeff says, “as I have said: I was a stupid kid who didn’t have his hormones under control, puberty is a bitch!”<br />
<br />
Lucy grins, “I’ve been trying to think of a way to get back at you,” she says, “and I finally thought of the perfect punishment for you,” the 12-year-old then raises her hand, aiming the palm at Jeff, before starting to speak in a weird language as her hand begins to glow in a white light.<br />
<br />
Jeff doesn’t seem to notice his sister’s hand starting to glow, nor that his body is surrounded by a white glowing aura. The teen tilts his head, “Lucy, are you sure you’re okay,” he asks, suddenly Jeff feels his hair lengthen and his clothes start to feel lose on his body, “what the…,” Jeff starts, his eyes widen as he notices something else. As Jeff looks at Lucy, the 12-year-old seems to be growing, but so even his room seems to become larger, “s-sis, why is the world getting bigger,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Lucy smirks, “awesome, it’s working,” the girl says.<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about,” Jeff asks, “you are freaking me out, what is going on?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, you’ll figure it out soon enough,” Lucy says, continuing to smirk.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen in horror and he jumps to his feet, “WHAT THE FREAK,” he yells as he finds himself wearing a pink dress, “what the fuck is… *cough*… happening? And… *cough*… what’s up with my… *cough*… voice? Why does… *cough*… it sound so… girly?”<br />
<br />
“Hehe… isn’t it obvious,” Lucy asks, grinning evilly, “you’re my little sister now!”<br />
<br />
“WHAT,” Jeff yells.<br />
<br />
“Just think of all the fun we could have,” Lucy says, “playing dress up, having tea parties with other girls, talking about boys. We’ll have our own “sister-bonding” time, you’ll get to wear so many cute outfits, and everyone will say, “what a nice little sister you have, Lucy.” Won’t that be fun… Jess?”<br />
<br />
Jeff is horrified, the former teen finds himself fall to his knees, or rather HER knees, “please, Lucy! This isn’t funny anymore,” the now 6-year-old “girl” says in a pleading voice, “pl-please… change me back!”<br />
<br />
Lucy grins, “now, why would I want to do that,” she asks, “as I have said: you’re my little sister now, and I can’t have you as my older brother and my younger sister at the same time now, can I? Who ever heard of such a thing?”<br />
<br />
Jeff is stunned, tears start to form in the “girl’s” eyes, “n-no… please,” she pleads, “I… I’ll do anything you want! Just… change me back… please!”<br />
<br />
Lucy ignores Jeff’s pleas, instead the 12-year-old looks around her brother’s room, tapping her chin thoughtfully, “tsk, tsk! Your room really needs an update, I mean… what little girl’s room looks as though a teenage boy lives there,” the girl asks, shaking her head, “the color is to bland… I’m thinking of something more cluttered with some pink and yellow, maybe a little white and blue too?”<br />
<br />
Jeff watches horrified as the walls of his room change color, taking on a more “appropriate” design for a 6-year-old girl, “YOU CAN’T DO THIS,” he shouts, tears rolling down his cheeks.<br />
<br />
Lucy ignores Jeff’s screaming, the 12-year-old already opening Jeff’s wardrobe, “oh dear, you really need a wardrobe change, Jess,” the 12-year-old says, “all your clothes are way to boyish, not frilly and feminine enough”. Lucy starts whistling a tune as she begins to change Jeff’s clothes into clothes for a 6-year-old girl.<br />
<br />
Jeff can only watch in horror and disbelief as all his clothes get changed into clothes for a 6-year-old girl, the former boy sobs, “pl-please… just… stop,” he sniffles, “I… I said… I’m sorry… wh-what more do… I need to do… to make you change… me back?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, stop your whining, Jess,” Lucy simply says, now turning her attention to Jeff’s furniture: bed, desk, wardrobe, bookshelf, “you’ll get used to it soon enough. You’ll even thank me, I’m only helping you be what you always wanted to be”.<br />
<br />
“NO! THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANTED,” Jeff shouts, watching as all his furniture change to suit his new age and gender.<br />
<br />
Lucy giggles, “of course it is,” she says, now focusing on Jeff’s posters, plush animals and books, “you may act as though you hate it, but I know, deep down you are overjoyed”. The 12-year-old claps her hands, once her “little sister’s” room is done, “much better,” she says before turning to Jeff, “well? How do you like it?”<br />
<br />
“I HATE IT,” Jeff shouts, “IT’S SO… GIRLY! I DEMAND YOU REVERT EVERYTHING! I AM NOT A STUPID GIRL!”<br />
<br />
Lucy just smiles, “I knew you’d love it,” she says, “no need to thank me. Now, why don’t we have a little fun? How about dress-up?”<br />
<br />
“NO,” Jeff says, backing away, “STAY AWAY FROM ME!”<br />
<br />
Lucy smirks before snapping her fingers, “oh, I think you’d just LOVE to play “dress-up” with you big sister, isn’t that right, Jess?”<br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly feels weird, “NO! I WANT TO BE A BOY AGAIN! CHANGE ME AND MY ROOM BACK,” the former boy tries to yell, feeling frustrated and angry, however, he suddenly feels a weird sensation of joy raise in him and to his horror he feels himself smiling as his mouth says the following, “EEEEH! YES! I’D LOVE THAT, BIG SIS!”<br />
<br />
Lucy lets out a lough at the shocked expression on Jeff’s face, “oh, I have just put a spell on you,” the 12-year-old says, “from now on you will say the opposite of what you were actually trying to say and act differently than how you feel inside”.<br />
<br />
“I’m a boy,” Jeff tries to say, instead he says, “I’m a girl”.<br />
<br />
“I’m 16,” he then tries, “I’m 6!”<br />
<br />
Jeff looks at Lucy with hatred, “I HATE YOU,” he tries to say before his body lunges forward and his arms wrap around Lucy, “I LOVE YOU, SIS!”<br />
<br />
“Aaaaw, I love you too, munchkin,” Lucy giggles, hugging her “little sister” back, “now, about that dress up?”<br />
<br />
“NO! NOT HAPPENING,” Jeff tries to say, “WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR,” he finds himself squealing excitedly instead.<br />
<br />
Lucy laughs, “well, let’s get to it,” she says, “I have so many cute ideas in my head”.</p>
