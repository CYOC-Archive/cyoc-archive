<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty transformed almost to his (fixed) normal form, except that he made sure to keep his womb and its internal tongues, despite not having any pussies or cervices. He wasn&#39;t sure what would have happened to Lisa&#39;s and his marbles in his womb if he&#39;d changed back to a fully male body without keeping the womb, and didn&#39;t want to find out. He verified the continued presence of the marbles by gently running his womb tongues over them. He felt the pleasure this provided to his own marbles, and knew that Lisa must have felt it with hers. He then felt similar stimulation from his other six marbles, in Lisa&#39;s womb, because she did the same in reply. He continued has tongue action, gently, so that he wouldn&#39;t overwhelm Lisa if she was doing other things, and she kept it up too. It was quite enjoyable, and only slightly distracting, now that he&#39;d had practice. Now he could keep it up while doing other things, just as she could.<br />
<br />
He got dressed and went downstairs, and found his parents in the living room. &quot;Hi Mom! Dad&quot; he said. &quot;Your new hairdo looks great, Mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
They greeted him back, and June said, &quot;Thank you, Ty. And thank you for the hair color and permanent depilation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty realized that June had thanked him for it again in front of Mark specifically to let it slip. &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark looked startled, not having been aware that when her hair color had changed a few day ago, that she hadn&#39;t bleached and colored it in the normal way. &quot;Wow!&quot; he said. &quot;You have my thanks, too! I love that hair color!&quot;<br />
<br />
June said, &quot;I know, dear. That&#39;s why I asked Ty to change me to have that as my natural color.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark was surprised again, not having considered that she and Ty would have made the change permanent. He also was intrigued by the permanent depilation. Shaving had been a part of his morning routine since his teenage years, but it would be nice to not need it. That would give him a couple of extra minutes in the morning. He decided to ask Ty about it in private some other time. He didn&#39;t feel like telling June about his own changes right now, though she might suspect.<br />
<br />
June said to Mark, &quot;If you&#39;d ever like me to change my hair color again, we could ask Ty.&quot; She was thinking that she wasn&#39;t yet comfortable telling Mark about her other change, Ty having made her body five years younger. Though if Mark hadn&#39;t noticed it, she mused, then he must not be very observant. And she started thinking about Mark&#39;s improved performance in the bedroom. Earlier she had thought he might have started taking an ED medication, but now she considered that there was another possibility.<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly. I&#39;d be glad to change you however and whenever you like,&quot; Ty said, deliberately not limiting his statement to hair color. &quot;Just let me know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, by the way,&quot; Ty said. &quot;Lisa called. Her parents told her it was OK for me to come over, and they have invited me to stay for dinner. They also are OK with my staying overnight. Is that still OK with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; answered June. &quot;That&#39;s fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just remember about school,&quot; Mark added. &quot;Would you like a ride over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No thank you, Dad. I don&#39;t mind walking. I&#39;ll go put my school stuff, a change of clothing, and my toiletries in my backpack.&quot;<br />
<br />
June started to say that he could teleport back for what he needed, but then realized that Lisa&#39;s parents should see him bring the clothing, etc. He&#39;s way ahead of me, she thought. &quot;OK,&quot; she said. &quot;That sounds like a good plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty went upstairs to pack, and a few minutes later came back down with the backpack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks again,&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; she replied, and Mark nodded. She stood up, hugged Ty a little awkwardly (owing to the backpack), kissed him on the cheek, and said, &quot;I love you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too!&quot; Ty said. &quot;Both of you!&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a good time,&quot; said Mark. &quot;We&#39;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK. Bye,&quot; Ty said, and set forth.<br />
<br />
Once the front door was closed, June said, &quot;You know, Mark, Ty was really right that when we&#39;re nicer to each other, we&#39;re all happier. I hope you&#39;re not afraid of him any more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark considered for a moment. &quot;You&#39;re absolutely right, and it&#39;s quickly becoming natural to me. Now that you mention it, I haven&#39;t been afraid of him lately. It still seems quite strange to have a son with powers like that, but now it seems strange in a good way. I&#39;ve finally accepted what he kept telling us, that he doesn&#39;t want to hurt us. Now I&#39;m actually glad this happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark stood up, approached June, and embraced her. &quot;I love you!&quot; he said, and they kissed.<br />
<br />
June and Mark were by themselves for dinner, for the first time in a long while. They made a date of it. June put some candles on the table, and Mark poured two glasses of wine. June proposed a toast, &quot;To our happier family!&quot;, and they both drank.<br />
<br />
Some time later, Dustin arrived home. He was surprised not to see any other family members in the living room, given that it was not yet very late. He&#39;d already eaten, so he sat down and watched a few episodes of a streaming show he liked.</p>
