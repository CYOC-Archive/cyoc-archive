<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Princess Eve sighed to herself as she neared the grandiose doors.  Soon she would pass from one cage to the next.  While in name, she was the treasured, sheltered, coddled only daughter of Great King Edmond, in reality, she lived in a kingdom where women were considered of little use except as incubators within which to breed the next generation.  Now, she would be used as a pawn to further the aims of her father, whatever those may be.  She would not even have a choice in who was to be her next jailer.  The best she could hope was that he would be as indifferent to her as her father was, allowing her some freedom within her gilded prison walls, if none without.  <br />
<br />
As the enormous doors swung open, Eve looked down the aisle, past the throngs of nobles.  All she could really see at a glance was that before the throne was a tall figure with grey, bristly hair.  She could not clearly see his face before she had to drop her eyes and feign modesty as she walked down the aisle.  As she reached the stairs before the throne, a strong, rough hand was proffered to her, and she gently accepted the help.  It was only after she and her groom knelt before the throne to accept the decree and blessing of Great King Edmond that Eve finally discovered the identity of her soon-to-be husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are most gladdened this day that our subjects have gathered to bestow their blessings upon the marriage of our daughter, Princess Eve, and her noble suitor, Lord Kain Byron...&quot; Great King Edmond began his speech.<br />
<br />
<i> Lord Byron!  The head of the most feared unit in His Majesty&#39;s army, known for its strength and brutality.  Wearing heavy armor fashioned in the form of a bipedal wolf, they formed the backbone of Great King Edmond&#39;s conquests during the Unity Wars.  Even their allied knights would say that they were more beast than man when upon the battlefield.  What sort of man would their leader be? </i><br />
<br />
Eve took a sideways glance at Lord Byron from under her lowered eyelashes.  While his grizzled hair might make one think he was older, in actuality, his face appeared quite young.  Eve had heard that he was only 23, and yet he had the authority to command such a powerful force.  His finely-chiseled features did have a few scars, but rather than appearing grotesque, they gave him a sort of experienced and worldly look.  He also had near unfettered control over his territory to the north, the Dark Forest.  This was due partially to the power of his forces, and partially due to the savage and untamed nature of the fief.  The Dark Forest housed many monsters, and it was Lord Byron&#39;s forces which kept them in check, sparing the surrounding fiefs.  Considering this, what was her father&#39;s goal with this arrangement?  Was it to tie Lord Byron closer to the monarchy, or was it --<br />
<br />
After accepting the endless congratulations of the nobles at the reception, Eve was finally able to excuse herself to go procure a drink.  Lord Byron had appeared rather taciturn and indifferent, but at least he did not seem to be a dissolute or a lecher.  Perhaps he would not be a bad match.  Eve reached for the glass of punch on the side table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now my dear sister, you must not forget us here in the capital and must visit before long,&quot;  an unwelcome voice broke in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, a mere woman cannot be expected to make that journey more than once, I&#39;m afraid our sister will have to wait for us to visit her!&quot;  another mocking voice joined in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Visit that wasteland?  I would much rather conquer the riches and beauties to the south!&quot;  the first voice blustered.<br />
<br />
Marcus and Clavis, the sixth and ninth princes.  The princes knew better than to take out their frustrations on each other openly, as that would open the door for the stronger of the brothers to teach the weaker ones a lesson.  Better to feign loyalty to the throne and the eldest.  However, that did not mean they could not torment their useless sister.   What made it all the more annoying for Eve was while she seemed to have inherited the composure and quick wit of their father, all of her brothers, despite their noble artifice, seemed to have inherited the mouth and small-mindedness of their milkmaid mother.  Of course, none of them would reveal such a thing before their noble followers, but against their powerless sister, why not?<br />
<br />
Eve pretended to give a weak smile to their rude banter, then excused herself to return to her new husband&#39;s side.  At least in the Dark Forest she would never have to put up with those buffoons again.<br />
<br />
Eve awaited her first night as a wedded woman rather nervously.  Naturally, as a royal, she had been well educated in the duties of a woman to her husband, and knew fairly well what to expect.  However, there was no guarantee her new husband would be gentle or considerate.  She simply had to acquiesce to everything he would throw at her.  However, what happened next threw her for a loop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rest well tonight, you will need it,&quot;  the gruff yet soft voice of her husband, fully dressed in his nightclothes, informed her as he lay down on the bed with his back to her.  &quot;Tomorrow...&quot;</p>
