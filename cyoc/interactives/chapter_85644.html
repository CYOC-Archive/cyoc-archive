<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It wasn’t exactly the evening Pablo had expected, but that didn’t mean it couldn’t turn out the way he hoped for.  So Molly wanted him to help her out with the stupid little tots. That was fine. The faster they were bathed, the faster they’d be off to bed.  Then he and Molly could have some real fun.  <br />
<br />
“Okay sweetie,” he agreed. “But you owe me some fun later,” he added.  <br />
<br />
Molly gave him a knowing wink.  Pablo’s penis jerked in anticipation and he found himself quickly throwing a pillow over it, feeling very weird now having these silly little tots seeing his manhood.  Drake was still trying to poke at it, all the more intrigued by the way it grew and twitched.  Pablo batted the inquisitive adult tot’s hand away.  Pablo felt around the floor for the boxer shorts he’d stripped off.  He didn’t like the way Molly compared his nudity to the toddler boys’ similar lack of clothing.  He wanted her to see his exposed body as sexy, not as cute.  <br />
<br />
Tommy had no such compunctions about his own nudity.  As Pablo scooped up his boxer shorts his former best friend was toying openly with his flaccid penis whilst picking his nose with his other hand.  Molly just shook her head at her former boyfriend’s antics.  Then, noticing Pablo slipping his boxers back up his legs she said, “Oh, don’t bother covering up now baby.  You’ll just get them soaked anyway.”  <br />
<br />
Pablo ignored her plea.  “You’ll see it again soon enough babe.  But I’m not going to prance around the house in my birthday suit like one of these little tykes.”  <br />
<br />
Drake frowned and looked back at Molly. “Him not nakie boy Mowwy,” he sulked.<br />
<br />
Molly stepped over and rubbed the naked twenty-something’s back gently.  “Oh I’m sorry honey. You wanted a playmate huh?” <br />
<br />
Drake nodded. <br />
<br />
“He thought I was going to be his friend?” Pablo asked, confused as to how a toddler could expect an adult to play with him as an equal.  <br />
<br />
Molly nodded. “Drakey knows only little boys go around all nakey-bummed. He thought you were little like him,” she explained. Then she looked Drake in the eye and said, “Why don’t you scoot your butt off to the bathroom.  Pablo isn’t here to play with you, but he’s love to give you your bathy.”  <br />
<br />
The frown was gone instantly.  “Gonna hava bathy!” Drake exclaimed, turning on the spot and half toddling half running from the room.  <br />
<br />
Tommy turned to follow him but Molly caught his hand and stopped him.  “Hold your horses there Tommy. We need to finish your haircut before you have a bathy.”  <br />
<br />
Tommy suckled and stamped his bare foot. “Wan’ pway wid Dwakey!” he insisted. <br />
<br />
“Later honey. First do what Molly says. Aren’t you a good boy?” <br />
<br />
Tommy still looked upset but he nodded. “Tommy good boy,” he agreed.  <br />
<br />
“Good. Now Pablo, go ahead and give Drakey a thorough bathy. I guess you can take yours after him if you want.”  <br />
<br />
Pablo rolled his eyes at Molly but did as she asked.  He headed down the corridor to the bathroom.  He remembered where it was from the last time he was over here.  They’d had some real fun that time alright.  But the kids had already been asleep when he’d come over on that occasion.  Now he was wishing he’d come over later this night as well.  <br />
<br />
Pablo entered the bathroom to find Drake already inside.  The young man was sitting with his bare bottom right on the kitchen sink, having apparently climbed onto it from the toilet.  He’d managed to get into the medicine cabinet too as he now had a tube of bright red lipstick gripped in his fist and he was scribbling it messily around the mirror.  <br />
<br />
“Drakey, what are you doing?” Pablo demanded, fearing he’d be blamed for this mess and it would ruin his chances with Molly tonight.  <br />
<br />
The adult toddler twisted around to look at Pablo, his face blankly innocent.  Pablo’s anger faded instantly though. Instead he broke out laughing.  Drake hadn’t started with the mirror apparently.  He’d drawn all over his own face with the lipstick.  It was on his forehead, his cheeks, his chin, even smeared in his hair.  <br />
<br />
“Oh my goodness Drakey! What a mess you’ve made of yourself!” Pablo declared. <br />
<br />
Drake smiled and held out the lipstick he’d used like a crayon.  “Makes pweetty!” he declared.  <br />
<br />
Pablo shook his head and walked over to the messy tot, taking the lipstick from him before he tried to eat it, assuming he hadn’t done that already.  Drake didn’t seem bothered by the loss of his toy. He leant forward suddenly, trying to give Pablo a big smooch on the cheek.  But the Latino teen pulled sharply back and avoided the kiss.  <br />
<br />
“Oh no you don’t!” he said. “You aren’t getting me covered in lipstick too.  We’re going to clean all that off right now. It’s a good thing it was your bath time anyway.”  <br />
<br />
Pablo lifted the very heavy toddler off the sink, cradling his hands around the young fellow’s bare bottom.  He was amazed at how heavy the little guy was.  Carefully he lowered him to the floor, letting him sit on the cool tile with his legs splayed apart while Pablo filled the tub.  He noticed there were numerous bath toys and he knocked a few into the rising water. At least those could keep the boy occupied.  Giving baths was not something Pablo was used to. He had no little siblings and certainly never did babysitting himself.  In fact he felt quite awkward about this whole thing.  He just had to focus on his reward, getting some quality time with Molly.  <br />
<br />
Finally the tub was full and the water seemed to be the right temperature.  Pablo turned around to find Drake still seated bare bottomed by the sink, now with one bare foot pulled to his face, nibbling away at his own dirty toes with a look of deep concentration on his face.  Pablo crept over and tapped the toe-munching boy’s free foot to get his attention.  <br />
<br />
“Those toesies yummy?” he asked.  <br />
<br />
Drake grinned around them and mumbled, “Ummy.”  <br />
<br />
“You’re not the brightest bulb are you buddy?” Pablo chided. <br />
<br />
Drake just kept nibbling away at the tips of his toes, totally unashamed.  <br />
<br />
“Okay, well your bathy is ready if you are.” <br />
<br />
Now the toes popped clear and Drakey was on his feet in a flash.  He hurried over to the tub and clambered in, sending water everywhere.  He emerged with a gleeful squeal and grasped a toy scuba man, pushing him eagerly around the tub.  Pablo was glad the boy seemed engrossed in something less messy or disgusting than smearing lipstick everywhere or sticking his feet in his mouth.  <br />
<br />
Pablo took a soapy sponge and began scrubbing the young man’s bottom and back as he lied on his tummy blowing bubbles in the water and then pushing a bright red plastic submarine around.  At least Drake didn’t make a fuss and was pretty cooperative as he cleaned away caked in dirt from a hard day’s play.  Drake giggled his head off as Pablo scrubbed the filthy soles of his feet.  Seeing how dirty they’d become from the toddler’s constant barefooted play made him even more horrified that the stupid boy had had them in his mouth a few moments ago.  <br />
<br />
They were getting pretty close to being done.  Drake had turned over for Pablo and sat relatively still while he leant close to scrub the boy’s tummy.  It was then that Drake jerked forward and this time succeeded in planning a big smooch on Pablo’s cheek.  <br />
<br />
Pablo pulled back once again, though he was glad to see that most of the lipstick had come off in the tub already so he wouldn’t have Molly demanding to know who the other girl was.  He wiped the wetness from his cheek and gave Drake a shake of his head.  “No more of that until you’re clean and dry silly boy. I’m in charge here, so you need to be a good boy and do as I say.”  <br />
<br />
But Drake shook his head, grinning mischievously.  “Nuh-uh. You my fwiend.”  <br />
<br />
Pablo found the boy’s desire to be his friend pretty adorable, but he needed to set the boy straight.  <br />
<br />
“No Drakey. I’m Molly’s friend. I’m here to play with her,” he explained. Wait, why did he say play? That wasn’t what they were going to do later. Or was it? Suddenly he felt a little vague on the details. But it was definitely something good. Something very good. <br />
<br />
Drake crossed his arms and shook his head, trying to be serious.  “Nuh-uh. Giwls is icky! You a boy. Pway wid boys!”  <br />
<br />
Pablo wanted to correct him, but then he realised Drake was right. Girls were very icky. They had cooties and always pinched boys and chased them around. Why did he want to play with a girl? Drake was clearly a boy like him. He could see Drake’s penis right there. Only boys had penises. He remembered that.  <br />
<br />
“I am a boy,” he said aloud, as though he needed to assure Drake.  <br />
<br />
The boy in the bath nodded. “Uh-huh. You gotta pee-pee. You boy.”  <br />
<br />
That made Pablo feel a lot better. He nodded. Boys had pee-pees. He had a pee-pee.  He gripped it though his tight boxers. It made him feel nice.  A particularly silly idea struck him.  He pointed at Drake’s penis and declared, “I can see your pee-pee!”  Then he erupted in a fit of giggles. <br />
<br />
Drake wasn’t embarrassed though. He nodded and toyed at his penis.  “Me Nakey-Dwakey,” he announced. “Cuz I jaybiwd.  Don’ you wanna be nakie jaybiwd?”  <br />
<br />
The question made Pablo feel odd. He shouldn’t be going around naked should he? That wasn’t something big boys did. He wasn’t like silly little Drakey.  He shook his head. “Nah. I don’t go naked. That’s for little ones like you.” <br />
<br />
Drake shook his head again. “No! You was nakie. On da couch!”  <br />
<br />
Pablo knew he was right. He had been nakey earlier.  But why?  Only little ones went around with naked bottoms and dangly pee-pees.  He was too big for that. Or was he?  Pablo didn’t feel that big right now.  He didn’t feel like taking care of Drake.  He didn’t want to be in charge.  What he wanted more with every passing second, was to play.  The toys in the tub seemed to be calling to him, enticing him to climb in.  Even the water itself beckoned. He wanted to make splashies. Big wet splashies!  <br />
<br />
Pablo shook himself off that train of thought as soon as he realised how weird it was getting.  Why on earth would he want to do something as stupid as splashing his hands in the bathtub?  He was having a lot of strange urges right now.  If fact it was really starting to worry him.  <br />
<br />
“Spwash!” Drake cried, smacking his flat palms on the surface of the water and sending a cascade of liquid into Pablo’s face and chest.  <br />
<br />
For a second Pablo blinked in shock and confusion.  He looked down at his front-side, dripping with water.  Then he gaped back at Drake, at the gleeful innocent expression on his stupid face.  And he smiled back. <br />
<br />
He was all wet! It was delightful.  Without a moment’s thought he smacked his hands into the water just as Drake had, soaking them both even more.  Drake was quick to respond and a full-fledged splash fight was soon under way.  <br />
<br />
When the boys finally tired of their battle Pablo was out of breath, soaked from head to toe as if he’d been in the tub himself.  The floor was covered in water, the walls dripping with it.  <br />
<br />
“Dat wad fun!” Drake declared, beaming.  <br />
<br />
And Pablo beamed right back, his heart racing with excitement.  It had been fun.  Playing was always fun.  <br />
<br />
Then Drake pointed at Pablo’s boxers.  “You gots ‘em all wet. Shoulda got nakey.”  <br />
<br />
Pablo looked down at his soaked undies and knew the boy was right. Would his mummy be angry he got his undies all wet? He hadn’t done pee-pees in them at least. He was still a big boy wasn’t he? Yes, he was sure he was meant to be big. He wasn’t meant to be getting all splashy with little Drakey.  But it was so much fun playing with little Drakey.  Mummy wasn’t here. She didn’t have to know.  <br />
<br />
“Take ‘em off,” Drake urged.  <br />
<br />
Yes, he should take them off, that was it. Mummy wouldn’t see they were all wet. He could hide them! Then she’d still think he was big.  Pablo nodded and slipped his thumbs in the waist, slipping them down to his feet and yanking them off.  Then he threw them across the room, so they landed in the pile of old towels. Mummy wouldn’t know he got them all wet now. <br />
<br />
Drake looked very pleased now indeed. “Nakie jaybiwd!” he exclaimed. <br />
<br />
Pablo couldn’t help but giggle at the boy’s declaration.  It was so silly to be all nakey-bummed.  But it felt really nice too.  Why had he wanted his undies on before? It had seemed so important then.  But he couldn’t think of any reason he’d want to put clothes on now. Nakey was so clearly more comfy.  <br />
<br />
Drake reached out for Pablo’s sizeable penis once again. The now exposed member was standing straight up, pulsing with arousal. It was an impressive sight, the shaft rubbing against the bottom of the young man’s sculpted abs.  Pablo saw Drake’s curiosity, but this time he made no attempt to pull away or hinder the boy’s explorations.  He just gazed down in equal curiosity as the other young man grasped his penis and playfully manipulated it.  Pablo grinned and giggled. It felt nice to be touched down there.  He stayed still for half a minute while Drake examined his weenie.  <br />
<br />
“That’s my pee-pee,” he told Drake, feeling pride for knowing that.  <br />
<br />
Drake nodded. “Uh-huh. Cuz you widdle boy. Wike me!”  <br />
<br />
Pablo nodded. But there was something odd about that. He was a boy.  But he wasn’t a little boy of course. And certainly not like dumb little Drakey.  But before he could object and set the little one right Drake let go of his penis and climbed out of the tub.  <br />
<br />
“What’chu doin’?” Pablo asked. <br />
<br />
“Dwakey wan’ cowour,” he explained, toddling across the tile, dripping water all over.  He reached the sink and gripped the lipstick tube Pablo had put there earlier.  He turned around with a brilliant smile and held out the tube.  “Dis pwetty cowour,” he explained. <br />
<br />
Pablo was sure this was something naughty.  Drake was meant to have a bathy, not do colouring. And the crayon thing was something for grown-ups, not little boys.  Wasn’t Pablo meant to stop him? Wasn’t he in charge here?  He looked down at his toes, at his penis jiggling freely.  He was a nakie jaybird. Nakie boys couldn’t be in charge. Nakie boys were silly. They played. He felt a wave of pleasant feelings as he realised that.  He looked at the pretty crayon thing again and let himself forget that it was naughty, that it was for grown-ups, that it was actually lipstick. He didn’t need to know those things. And then he didn’t and it felt lovely to forget.  <br />
<br />
“That’s a pwetty crayon,” he told Drake, wondering if his friend would let him play with it too.  <br />
<br />
Drake nodded, then dropped to his bottom on the floor, splaying his legs out and beginning to draw red lines across his tummy and then up his pee-pee.  Pablo wanted to play with the pretty colour too.  He dropped to his bottom and found the floor was cool and wet on his bum-bum.  He scooted over to Drake and held out his hand.  “I wanna try,” he said.  <br />
<br />
Drake nodded. “Kay. I do dwawing,” he replied, leaning over and beginning to draw big uncoordinated circles and lines on Pablo’s tummy and then across his face.  <br />
<br />
Though he had wanted to do it himself the feeling of the crayon drawing on his bare skin was very nice and Pablo couldn’t help but giggle at the ticklish sensations.  <br />
<br />
The crayon was nearly all gone when the door to the bathroom swung open and Molly walked in. Pablo turned and looked up at his girlfriend and instantly felt a wave of shame crash over him, snapping him out of his reverie.  What the hell was he doing? He was sitting naked on the bathroom floor letting Drake draw all over him with the grown-up crayon thing. That was what dumb little babies did. He was meant to be in charge, not nakey-bummed and getting all messy.  <br />
<br />
“Molly!” he screeched, blushing. “I… I was.. um…” <br />
<br />
But his girlfriend didn’t look upset with his lapse.  No, she was smiling in fact.  Perhaps it wasn’t that bad.  <br />
<br />
“Well it looks like you little ones have been having fun!” she chirped.  <br />
<br />
Little ones? She couldn’t be comparing him to Drake. He wasn’t a dumb little toddler! But just then Tommy appeared from behind Molly. He’d had his haircut now and the towel had been abandoned. He toddled naked into the room, sucking his thumb and gazing down at the messy young men on the floor.  <br />
<br />
“Dem methy!” he exclaimed, removing his spit-sodden thumb with a pop. <br />
<br />
“They certainly are,” Molly agreed. “But it’s okay. Little boys are supposed to be messy.” <br />
<br />
Tommy smiled a silly innocent grin and declared, “I pway too!” lunging towards them to get his turn with the pretty red crayon thing.  But he didn’t get far.  Molly grabbed his arm and held the tall naked young man back like it was nothing, like he wasn’t taller and heavier than her.  <br />
<br />
“Oh no you don’t.  You’ve already had your bathy for the night,” she chided. <br />
<br />
Tommy pouted and whined but Molly wasn’t budging.  Pablo looked at the pouty, stupid expression on Tommy’s face and felt more idiotic himself by the second.  In fact he also felt more and more exposed by the second.  He cupped a hand over his flaccid penis, turning on the floor and rising to stand.  It exposed his body even more, but it made him feel more on par with the beautiful Molly.  Down on the floor at her feet he felt like one of the silly babies.  <br />
<br />
“Molly… I…” he stuttered, trying to think of an explanation, an excuse for his odd behaviour. But nothing was coming to him. His brain felt slow and sticky, his thoughts impossible to organise, like he was drunk or high but without the buzz.  And Molly seemed so imposing, so in charge. He didn’t want her to be angry at him.  But there were no words forming in his muddled head.  <br />
<br />
“You got all pretty, I can see that buddy,” she cooed, cutting him off.  <br />
<br />
Pablo was confused. She was smiling and didn’t seem upset at all. In fact it seemed like she’d expected him to be naked and messy like her little toddlers.  He shook his head vigorously. He wasn’t all pretty, he looked dumb! And then her smile faded and she looked concerned. Yes, she saw it now too. This wasn’t right and she would fix it. <br />
<br />
“Is your pee-pee okay honey?” Molly asked. <br />
<br />
Pablo blinked. What? Why was she asking about that? His pee-pee… his penis, was fine. Didn’t she see what was wrong with him being covered in lipstick drawings? <br />
<br />
“Pee-pee’s fine,” he huffed, frowning and now even angrier at his errant usage of her word for it. <br />
<br />
“Then why are you holding it darling? No ouchies? Do you need to tinkle?”  <br />
<br />
Pablo was speechless with shock for a second. Then he wondered if he did need to make tinkles. Was that what was making him uncomfortable? Maybe he needed to potty like Molly said.  <br />
<br />
Wait! Pablo caught his train of thought and yanked it back before it got any further down that track. Why had he thought of Molly as his babysitter? Why was he thinking of potties and tinkles as normal things? Pablo’s face contorted in fear and confusion.  This was all wrong! Somebody needed to fix this.  <br />
<br />
Molly’s warm hand closed on his shoulder. It brought instant comfort and security, holding off the growing panic threatening to erupt from within.  <br />
<br />
“Do you need to tinkle darling? Is that why you’re holding your pee-pee?” she asked sweetly.  <br />
<br />
Pablo managed to collect himself and shake his head.  He just needed to make her understand.  “No Molly, I just don’ wan’ you seein’ my pee-pee,” he explained.  <br />
<br />
Molly giggled lightly. “Oh is that it? Well don’t be such a bashful Billy you silly boy. Molly’s seen her jaybirds’ pee-pees plenty of times before.” <br />
<br />
Pablo shook his head. Didn’t she understand? He wasn’t a dumb toddler jaybird, a senseless little nudist like Tommy and Drakey.  “No, I not wike dem,” he insisted. “I big boy!” he shouted, and instantly knew it made him sound even dumber.  <br />
<br />
Molly shook her head and asked, “You’re a big boy?” sounding very unconvinced. <br />
<br />
Pablo nodded his head. She had to believe him. She just had to. Only she could fix this. She was the only person in the room with a clear head.  <br />
<br />
“Okay big boy. Then tell me how many toes you have,” she challenged, looking down at their feet.  <br />
<br />
Pablo blinked, confused by this sudden challenge.  “Wha?” <br />
<br />
“If you’re such a big boy that you don’t want mummy seeing your pee-pee or giving you bathies, you should be able to count for me,” she said. <br />
<br />
Pablo didn’t know what to say.  Of course he could count, what kind of a test was that? As if the ability to count his toes proved he was grown like her? He could do more than count, he knew how to add and multiply and all sorts of cool stuff. Pablo looked down at his feet and back up at Molly. <br />
<br />
“Go ahead ‘big boy’ count your toesies for mummy. But no munching on them,” she chided with a giggle. <br />
<br />
Was she serious? Did she actually just warn him not to put his own toes, his filthy feet, in his mouth? He wanted to tell her off, but again the words just weren’t forming right in his head. If he blurted out a retort he’d only sound more retarded.  He had to prove he was big for her.  He wasn’t a dumb baby like the other boys! <br />
<br />
He looked down at his toes, prepared to loudly count for her.  They were interesting to look at actually. He wiggled them on the damp tile floor. It made him smile, the way they wiggled.  No, he wasn’t here for that. He needed to count. <br />
<br />
“One,” the man began, focussing on the littlest toe on his left foot.  “Two,” the naked Latino man yelled confidently. This was so easy it was ridiculous. How could this prove he was big? Of course it at least proved he was bigger than silly Drakey, who was smearing the red crayon stuff around his tummy. And Tommy, who’d dropped to his bare bum next to Drakey and was playing with his toes, twiddling them and pulling at his feet.  <br />
<br />
“Thwee,” Pablo announced, distracted for a second by his mispronunciation.  He focused again and opened his mouth.  Nothing came out.  What came after three?  The confused man blinked hard and pushed other concerns aside, but nothing came to his muddled mind.  Pablo looked across the rest of his toes. There was a lot more of them. He’d only just begun. But the names of the numbers just weren’t there. <br />
He frowned, frustration growing by the moment. It wasn’t fair! He knew the first… um, the first…. Wait how many had he counted already? Pablo squats down to have a better look, finally able to let go of his pee-pee because now Molly can’t see it.  He touches his toes.  How many did he count? He could start again.  What did he start with? That’s right, the little one on the left. It was number…  It was…  <br />
<br />
He blinks and stares at them, at his toes. He’d started on the left, but which is the left? What’s the opposite of left again?  And Pablo knows that he’s forgetting again, like earlier.  He’s forgetting and just like then it’s a pleasant sensation. He’s lost his numbers now and probably his letters too he realises. There was a song for those, he’s sure. What did it start with? He doesn’t know anymore. He feels his pee-pee stiffen between his legs. It’s getting happy again. It feels so nice to forget. <br />
<br />
Tommy is being very silly now. He’s doing the icky thing Molly said not to. He’s munching his toes, got ‘em right tween his lips and sucking away at ‘em.  But Molly doesn’t look angry at him at all. No, she’s smiling at the toe-sucking boy like it’s the cutest thing ever.  Pablo doesn’t feel big anymore. He feels so little compared to Molly, so helpless. He can’t even remember which foot is which or how many he has, let alone how many wiggly toesies. Maybe she’d smile at him like that if he munched his toes. They didn’t look so disgusting up close. They wiggled and smelled like soap from the bath. He forces his mind off this dangerous path, shaking his head to clear it.   <br />
<br />
Pablo feels Molly’s warm hand press against his bare back again, moving in soothing circles.  “It’s okay sweetie. I know your mummy doesn’t want you getting big too fast. She loves having her little boy, her sweet little jaybird. She says was a little cutie pie you are all the time,” she coos to him.  <br />
<br />
And he knows that Molly sees him just like the other two boys, nothing but a silly toddler. She even thinks he’ll want to mouth his toesies the way Tommy is.  And maybe it would be better if he felt that way too. Maybe he should just forget. It feels so nice to forget after all. Even the thought makes his pee-pee grow fully erect, poking against his bare tummy as he squats.  He wiggles his toes again. Could he put them in his mouth like Tommy? Would he want to?  It seems ridiculous to him now, the very idea of it repulsive. But he’s only embarrassed by it because he remembers this is all wrong.  If he just let go…<br />
<br />
Pablo feels something else slipping away, something indescribable.  His skin feels more comfortable suddenly. He feels free and unhindered.  He sits back on his bottom spreads out his legs towards the other boys.  His pee-pee stands straight up for all to see and it doesn’t bother him in the slightest.  He knows he must have forgotten something big because his stiffy is twitching with arousal and he feels wonderful.  He knows this is all wrong, that he’s supposed to be big, but he’s also certain that he’s just a little jaybird now, a nakey boy for Molly.  <br />
<br />
She chuckles at his sudden openness in revealing his pee-pee.  “Okay jaybird, I think we need to get you in that bathy before that lipstick stains your skin.”  <br />
<br />
Could that happen? Pablo isn’t sure anymore. It seems like Molly might have made it up but he just doesn’t know. He has to trust her now. He’s forgotten too much.  <br />
<br />
“Bath Molly,” he agreed with a nod.  <br />
<br />
Molly leads him back over to the tub and this time he climbs right into the lovely warm water himself, letting it envelop him, caress his erection, wash away the confusion.  A moment later Drakey is back in the tub beside him, giggling and splashing.  Pablo ignores him.  He’s not a splashy boy. He still knows he’s meant to be big, meant to be giving the bathy not enjoying it.  But Molly’s in charge now, she knows best. He doesn’t want to be stained. He needs to get clean. Then Molly can help him be big again.  <br />
<br />
Molly starts to scrub them clean, rinsing and sponging their backs and bottoms first.  Luckily Pablo doesn’t feel any sense of embarrassment as his bare bottom is washed. He’s completely forgotten about such big boy things as modesty and privacy.  In fact as Drakey gets his back and bum washed he faces Pablo and the man notices his bath partner’s pee-pee isn’t as big and straight as his. It’s soft and dangling between his thighs.  He has a sense that he should know what that means, but he doesn’t. Instead he feels very curious. He reaches down and feels Drakey’s pee-pee, pulling at it gently and manipulating it.  Luckily Drakey also hasn’t had any understanding of modesty or privacy for a very long time and he just smiles and giggles at the explorations.  <br />
<br />
“Mowwy! Wan’ twuck!” Tommy suddenly shouts from the other side of the bathroom, where he was playing on his hands and knees with a stuffed rabbit.  <br />
<br />
Molly frowned. “Can you wait just a sec sweetie?” <br />
<br />
“No! Wan’ twucky!” the naked young man bellowed, eyes tearing up.  <br />
<br />
Molly sighed. She didn’t want to deal with another tantrum.  “Okay, hold your horses little guy. I’ll be back in a second.”  <br />
<br />
Pablo watched her hop up and hurry from the room.  Tommy got to his feet just as quickly, his tears forgotten already.  He toddled across the room to the side of the tub, grinning at the two young men within before splashing his hands into the water and giggling his head off.  Drakey knew this game. He splashed right back, soaking Tommy’s front side and making his hop up and down in glee, his flaccid penis jiggling about.  <br />
<br />
Watching them have their splash fight triggered something in Pablo’s foggy mind once again.  They shouldn’t be having a splash fight. He needed to say something to stop them… because he was meant to be in charge… he was the adult here. <br />
<br />
“Stop it!” he yelled at them. <br />
<br />
Drakey turned and blew a raspberry at him before splashing in his direction.  Tommy was delighted at this as copied the other man-toddler.  <br />
<br />
The splash of water across his skin set off a wave of pleasant feelings inside Pablo. Something was telling him to splash back, to give in and join the fun, be a silly splashy nakey boy.  His erection bobbed in anticipation.  <br />
<br />
No, he had to get out of the tub before it was too late. He had to tell Molly about these feelings. She’d know what to do. He climbed out of the tub, one foot at a time, not even caring about how wet he was getting the floor now.  <br />
<br />
“Nuh-uh, gotta stay!” Tommy warned him. <br />
<br />
He shook his head. “No Tommy, I gotta go to Molly,” he insisted, finally standing flat-footed on the soaked floor. <br />
<br />
Tommy pouted. “Gotta stay ‘nd pway,” he insisted, moving closer.  <br />
<br />
Play? It set of fireworks of pleasure in his head, just hearing the word now.  He tried to focus, to push aside the waves of endorphins being released.  “No… I gotta tell Molly that I big,” he explained. <br />
<br />
Tommy shook his head. “Nuh-uh. You widdle nakey boy,” he declared, reaching out and poking his erect penis as proof.  <br />
<br />
Pablo grunted involuntarily at the jolt of ecstasy Tommy’s words and actions gave him.  A voice in his head was urging him to be exactly that, a silly little nakey jaybird like the others, to give in and forget all about this silly ‘being big’ business. It was already so hard to think, already so much was gone, it would be such a relief to let it all go, let himself enjoy it.  <br />
<br />
Tommy smiled at the grunt and the glazed-over look his pee-pee poking caused.  Before the Latino man could react properly Tommy’s hand reached back out and closed right around the engorged shaft of his penis. He could see the pleasure in Pablo’s eyes. Tommy was still physically an adult and he no doubt still played with himself regularly.  He wanted Pablo to stay and have fun.  He began to stroke.  <br />
<br />
Pablo felt the wet fingers begin to caress his pee-pee.  The arousal was beyond anything he could recall. Molly was just beyond the doorway, just out of reach. If he could just hold on till she returned he could explain this to her.  If he could just push past Tommy and leave the room he would still be big, still be a man.  But what was so good about being a man? He couldn’t really remember anymore. But being a little boy.  That meant being nakey bum and getting messy and playing.  That meant getting cuddles from Molly and letting big people do all the worrying and thinking for him.  That seemed like a lot more fun.  <br />
<br />
Pablo put his arms around Tommy and snuggled in closer. He didn’t fight it anymore. He rested his chin on the young man’s shoulder, feeling the fingers stroke up and down his stiffy.  After a few delightful moments he moaned as warm gooey cum erupted onto their tummies and took away all his confusion and worries.  <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
It was nearly nine in the evening when Molly answered the door-bell to find a pretty middle aged Latina woman standing on the threshold.  “Oh, hello Mrs Garcia,” she said in greeting. “Did you have a good time at the movies?”  <br />
<br />
Maria Garcia nodded. “Oh yes, it was quite a long one though. How has my little one been?”  <br />
<br />
“Oh he’s been just a darling.  Come right in. He’s playing with the other boys,” she said.  <br />
<br />
Molly led the older woman into the house.  The sounds of the TV were clear as they entered the living room.  Barney was singing and dancing his way across the screen.  Two pale-skinned young men were hopping and dancing around naked before the TV singing nonsense back at it.  And sitting on the floor beside them was an olive-skinned young man who was just as naked as they were.  Pablo’s eyes were glued to the TV screen, entranced at the children’s show.  He had his right foot in his hands, pulled to his face, big toe firmly between his lips as he sucked on it.  <br />
<br />
“I’ve been letting them run around nakey most of the night. Tommy and Drakey are just total nudists and Pablo didn’t want to be left out. I hope you don’t mind.”  <br />
<br />
Maria waved her hand dismissively. “Don’t be silly, my little boy is a complete nudist, they all are at that age.  I assumed the others had copied him.”  <br />
<br />
The two women shared a chuckle and Pablo noticed their arrival.  He let the toe pop clear of his mouth, clambering to his feet and hurrying over with a wide, uneven gait, his eyes lit with excitement and mouth agape.  <br />
<br />
“Ba’ney mumma!” he announced cheerily, pointing to the TV screen for them.  <br />
<br />
Maria nodded. “Yes sweetie pie, I see that.”  <br />
<br />
Pablo grinned ear to ear and hopped up and down so his now flaccid penis bobbed about.  “Ba’ney danth!” he announced and began to spin about in his toddler version of a dance.  <br />
<br />
The women shared a chuckle between them and then sat on the couch to await the end of the show that had the boys so entranced.  The two women smiled at the three tall, muscular young men dancing and hopping and spinning about, showing off their naked bodies without an ounce of shame.  Pablo fit right in now.  Nobody would have known he’d come here to have sex with his hot girlfriend just a few hours ago.  Now he was happy to suck his thumb and toy with his limp penis as he watched the children’s show.  <br />
<br />
Soon enough though they’d said their bye-byes and Pablo was strapped safely into a big car seat in the back of his mother’s station wagon.  His clothes were piled on the seat beside him as she saw no reason to go through the trials of trying to dress him just to ride home. He certainly didn’t mind. He’d trotted naked around the front yard and toddled happily down the driveway with his penis swinging about for any passing car to see. So the young man sat naked in his seat playing with his toes again and watching his mumma’s face in the rear-view mirror. Molly was fun and pretty and nice but Pablo was sure the only woman he could ever love was mumma. She cared for him and kept him safe. Just seeing her smile made him feel all warm and good inside.  Pablo suckled on his yummy toesies again, resting back in his seat and feeling certain everything was just as it should be.</p>
