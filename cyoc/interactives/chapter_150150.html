<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jess reached over to a plate filled with hard crackers and apple slices, picking up a handful of both and popping them into her mouth. In boredom, her appetite had grown over the last two weeks. Two weeks. Two weeks now Jess was stuck in this accursed Cabin. <br />
For two weeks she watched her brother take off into the forest every morning, only to return by dusk, tired, dirty and dejected. <br />
For two weeks she’d smelled that the stink of goat from her parent’s room got more and more powerful, her mother hiding in there, painting all day.<br />
For two weeks she’d watched her father, silently chopping wood, making meals and tending to a small vegetable patch found around the side of the house.<br />
For two weeks she’d pored over the tomes in the living room, looking for any that may allude to what this place was, how the curse worked, and if they had any hope. Time spent, thus far, to no avail.<br />
<br />
With a sigh she turned the last page of another book, another book with nothing but irrelevant fairytales, fables and trivia. Jess sighed, and sat up from her slouched position. She grunted as her heaving breasts pressed against the cotton of her tee and the hard denim of her dungaree. With an annoyed sigh she twisted and pulled at the fabric to allow her breasts to fall into a more comfortable position. The motion was enough to cause her nipples to stiffen and nethers to begin pumping blood.<br />
<br />
‘Oh for fuck sake…’ she thought to herself. Day by day, hour by hour, she was getting hornier and hornier. Three days ago she had woken up, pillow between her legs humping, ears halfway changed. Yesterday she had caught a glimpse of her brother in profile coming out of the shower, giant horsecock bulging underneath his towel. This morning alone she’s found herself, hand down pants, jilling herself while watching her dad chop wood. Each time the only thing that had saved her was a trip to the bathroom for a cold shower.<br />
<br />
She stood now, crumbs falling from her top as she shifted. Her breasts instantly shifted and pulled down, rubbing her hardening nipples against the cotton of her tee. She grunted as her mind threw up the thought of her fathers running his hands down her ample bosom. Jess had thought of her dDad a lot over the past two weeks. She was more sure than ever, that when the time came, which would be soon, that she would lose her v-card with him. She had even tried a few times over the past week to initiate and start another encounter, but Henry had managed to always slip away, not letting himself stuck in a room alone with his daughter. <br />
<br />
In sexual frustration Jess tossed the book aside, back to the shelf.<br />
<br />
*Thunk*<br />
<br />
She took a step towards the door. Then paused. ‘That sounded hollow’ she thought.<br />
She turned back a stomped over to the shelf, pussy now buzzing with need. A hand reached out and pushed the few remaining books on the shelf off. She made a fist.<br />
<br />
*Thunk-Thunk* <br />
<br />
That was definitely hollow. She tried the wall behind a different shelf.<br />
<br />
*Thock-thock*<br />
<br />
Solid. She was on to something. There was something behind that wall. Jess looked around, the bookshelf in front of the wall was solid oak. Even if she took all the books off it first, Jess doubted that she would be able to move it. She’d need help.<br />
Help from someone strong. Her ears buzzed, already changing from her heightened horniness. Jess decided there would be no cold shower this time. She but her lip, it was time to try another encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Out in the garden Henry stood topless, chopping wood. The past two weeks were starting to get to him. Even after his chat with Joan to smooth things over she’d seemed distant, or at least distracted. He’d tried to engage again but she just assured him all was fine.<br />
<br />
The awkwardness was not, however, the reason he was spending a lot of time outside. That was because of the smell. Despite Joan having a shower every day, the stink of goat grew and grew in their bedroom. He knew there was nothing Joan could do to avoid the smell other than wash, so he felt bad and wouldn’t bring it up. It was getting to him, to the point that Henry could barely sleep in the room.<br />
<br />
So he now spent most of his time outside the Cabin, chopping wood and tending to the garden. The heating of the Cabin was a stove system, and it got very cold during the nights, so Henry did his best to keep up with the wood supply. Despite the cool of the nights, the daytime could be humid and warm, hence why he had abandoned his shirt, and now stood, sweating, and taking a break.<br />
<br />
He reached into his pocket for a handkerchief to wipe the sweat from his brow. As he flourished the fabric, however, he paused. Pink. Wrong pocket. He’d pulled out his daughter’s panties.<br />
<br />
Henry hadn’t been strong enough to hand them back; instead keeping them on him at all times. They had become his crutch, his addiction. At night, laying beside a goat smelling Joan, he would turn and press the fabric to his face to cover the smell of animal. Sometimes, when alone, hiding around the side of the house, he would pull it out and enjoy himself. Like now perhaps. Without an active animal trigger to change him, Henry had no fear of giving into the lustful waves pulsing from the Cabin. He masturbated almost daily, sometimes more than once.<br />
<br />
He brought the garment to his nose and inhaled, his eyes rolled and lids fluttered. Heavenly. Why did Jess smell so good? He’d always been a man for pleasing a woman up close and personal; in his early years he’d sampled a reasonable number, some good, some bad. Joan’s, before this trip anyway, was a good one, one of the best. Musty, basal, savoury; he never could get enough of it. Now though, one evening where his own daughter had pressed her panties into his hand, and nothing could ever be the same. She smelled a bit like Joan, only more heightened, almost more exotic, more spicy. Like every time he smelled her blood pumped and his erection was immediate and relentless. This was so very fucked up, but he just couldn’t help himself.<br />
<br />
He took a few steps to a grassy knoll, lay down and worked his pants down, freeing his straining erection. He closed his eyes, brought the panties to his face again inhaling deeply. His hand gripped his shaft hard, and he began pumping.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was fortunate for Jess then that that was the moment she rounded the side of the Cabin, looking for Henry. Her eyes immediately boggled and her pussy practically squelched with wetness. Her father lay glistening with sweat, topless, pumping his sizeable erection not 10 feet from her. ‘What’s that in his han…’<br />
<br />
She recognised the fabric. The fabric her Dad was sucking air through to get him going. He did find her sexy, he obviously did want her. It was time to make it happen.<br />
<br />
She popped back around the corner and shucked her boots off, going back to barefoot. The clasps undone, her dungaree fell to the floor next, revealing her well groomed pussy. She hadn’t bothered with panties since handing her only pair to her father. Wearing a strangers just felt wrong to her.<br />
<br />
Finally her arms lifted and she pulled off her tee, releasing her enormous breasts. She caught one as it fell and roughly twisted a nipple. With her nipples grown, it seemed they could take far more punishment to drive pleasure compared with the pencil eraser nubbins she had had before. Her pussy twitched in anticipation and her ears buzzed with the shift to cow ears again. As they slowly did she could sense her hearing improve as it had during each other partial transformation. With it came a flood on new sensory information. Birds, insects, wind, and the rhythmic slapping of a man beating his meat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Henry lay in rapture. Eyes closed, sun beating down on his face, panties pressed against his face as he beat away. His mind’s eye was doing an admirable job of trying to keep images to those of Joan, his wife, but occasionally it presented him with the memory of his daughter’s nubile form, heaving breasts and perfectly sculpted ass.<br />
<br />
An image of a younger, naked Joan had just turned around to reveal an ass far too small and pale to be hers, when the sky above him darkened. ‘A cloud. No matter’ he thought, and let his mind continue to wander. <br />
<br />
The pale nymph in his mind bent over to reveal her juicy pink treasure trove. He took an extra big inhale from her panties and revelled in the smell. It smelled so fresh right now. Warm almost. His face felt warm, like tendrils of heat curling around his nose, and lips. Still no sign of the sun though. So how was his face warm. Henry opened his eyes.<br />
<br />
Jess had taken the opportunity to sneak over, stand with bare feet either side of Henry’s head, and squat down to straddle his face. Her pussy only inches from her father’s face. Her mouth was open in voiceless agony as she waited for him to open up. When finally she saw his eyelids flutter, one hand snaked in behind his head and she dropped her hips onto his surprised face.<br />
<br />
Henry only had a flash of huge pink dangling tits, nipples on a belly, and the image of a juicy overflowing pussy before his world went dark again. It was Jess, and she was riding his face. He almost bucked her off in protest, but something stopped him. The smell. The taste. Her pussy smelled so much better fresh and clean, and it tasted even better than it smelled, a quick flick of the tongue confirmed that.<br />
<br />
Jess felt her father’s tongue do an exploratory lick and it sent a shiver up her spike. An involuntary, but welcome moan escaped her mouth. She was already so close. She hadn’t had an orgasm in two weeks, and now that things were going she was losing all control, and fast. <br />
<br />
For Henry the panting and moaning he heard really began then. The sound of a woman enjoying herself always set him off like nothing else, and this time, even that sensation was massively heightened. He wanted nothing more than to hear her scream. His tongue was a blur then, exploring every nook and cranny of his daughter. Her labia, uneven, messy, felt nothing short of unique as he felt them glide across his tongue. It wasn’t all just for her though, Every lick brought him fresh nectar that he could drink in. He could spend eternity here.<br />
<br />
Jess, however, didn’t have eternity, her orgasm washed over her quickly and unexpectedly. Her extreme horniness and time since last fuck made her pussy go off on a hair trigger. Her face went red and she stifled a scream as her stomach shook, and she roughly mashed her Dad’s face.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like an age she managed to suck down some oxygen and her blood began to drain from her face and ears a little. Senses returning a little she felt her ears. Soft, and hairless, but unmistakeably cow’s ears. <br />
<br />
Henry had felt Jess shudder above him, she had to be enjoying this as much as him. The super horny part of his brain finally let go then and there. She had been bulling for a good fucking for weeks now, he couldn’t deny it a moment longer. His hand came up, intertwined with hers, then led it down to grasp his rock hard erection. <br />
<br />
Jess’s eyes widened as she heard a muffled call from beneath her. “Fuck me Jess” it said.<br />
<br />
She paused, she had already changed once, ears were fine, but what would happen if they fucked. Would she risk it? She had never had a better chance. Maybe she never would?</p>
