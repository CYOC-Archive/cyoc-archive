<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle struggled as hard as he could against the petite girl holding him down, he tried to <br />
shout something out, but Jennifer had her breasts shoved in his face; and while he <br />
couldn't complain about the view, Kyle was quite simply shit out of luck. How was he being <br />
held down by her anyway? He had like, 30 pounds on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It been minute.&quot; Jennifer said in that heavy Japanesse accented english, &quot;You have both!&quot;<br />
She got off him and stood up, as she with the light of the window putting a spotlight on <br />
her naked body Kyle couldn't help but think about how sexy she was now. But there was a <br />
time and place for those thoughts and now was certainly not it!<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer please! I didn't think the curse was real! It was just a harmless joke, I'll change <br />
you back I swear,  Just don't get trigger happy, okay?&quot; The malicious smile on her face <br />
reminded him so much of the old Jennifer that he almost thought she had changed back <br />
when he wasn't looking.<br />
&quot;Come on Jen! That whole 'pulling my pants down' bit didn't even bother me, ye'know?<br />
&quot;Be reasonable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reasonable!?&quot; She cried out (and if eyes actually could shoot daggers then Kyle would be a <br />
bloody smear) &quot;Was you being reasonable when you put curse on me?!&quot;<br />
Kyle tried to appeal to her some more but before he could get a word out Jennifer went <br />
into full swing:<br />
&quot;First, I dare you say me curse, then you change me back.<br />
&quot;For transform, you turn into asian girl too, you not able to use real name and can't tell <br />
anyone about what happened to you and can not use curse on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle had no time to catch his bearings before the curse took hold:<br />
his hair appeared to be turning black. As he <br />
watched he could see his roots darken, then it spread out from his scalp. It <br />
now appeared to be not so much black as a very dark brown, and soon his <br />
formerly rusty hair was totally brown.<br />
<br />
Kyle closed his eyes and shook his head, trying to clear the vision from his <br />
mind, but when he looked again it was still that dark brown. &quot;Oh jesus ,no...&quot;, he half <br />
whimpered out loud as the changes plowed onward.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he noticed that Jennifer was moving closer to him, <br />
or rather he was moving closer to her. He was shrinking, and had already lost <br />
about 4 inches of height. He wanted to turn and just run away, but <br />
the curses power held him firmly in place.<br />
<br />
His skin was now starting to look tanned and, as he watched, the tan started to deepen.<br />
Kyle had now stopped shrinking, after losing almost a foot from his original  <br />
height. His shirt hung on him like a tent; He had also lost, and was still losing, muscle <br />
mass. His arms were becoming very slim, and as he felt his legs he found his legs were <br />
following suit.<br />
<br />
His hands also were getting more and more delicate, as his fingers were now <br />
thin and appeared to be getting longer. His fingernails were likewise growing <br />
and were now about half an inch long.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is actually taking a while&quot; He said out loud, coming dangerously close to breaking <br />
the fourth wall.<br />
<br />
His skin was now a rich coffee-and-cream color and had gotten very soft; What little facial <br />
hair he had was now completely gone as well as all his body hair. And regarding <br />
his hair, it was now growing and reaching his shoulders, then it was past his <br />
shoulder blades, and had gotten much thicker and shinier.<br />
<br />
His once prominent Adam's apple was gone, his neck was much slimmer and <br />
more feminine. He grunted in discomfort and to his mounting horror it came out as a  <br />
husky female voice. As he said this he felt a tingling in his <br />
chest. &quot;Oh man, <br />
not that!&quot;<br />
<br />
But his worst fears were realized as he pulled his shirt out and saw his <br />
areolas about the size of silver dollars, sitting atop small but distinct breasts, <br />
that were steadily pushing further and further out. Suspecting what else was <br />
changing, he slid his hands down his sides and felt his torso taper down to a <br />
waspish waist, then flare out to hips that were wide and getting more so.<br />
<br />
A quick check verified his equipment was still there, but was diminishing as <br />
he watched.<br />
<br />
His hair was now down to the small of his back, and was even fuller than <br />
before.<br />
<br />
Now he could feel tightning sensations in his face and Knew the transformation was finely <br />
coming to an end. His cheekbones seemed to rise and <br />
become more prominent, and his jaw was taking on a less square and more <br />
rounded appearance. His once thin lips were becoming full and shapely, and <br />
his eyes, once a light brown, were becoming very dark, almost black. They <br />
were becoming almond shaped, as his nose became smaller and slightly <br />
flatter. His lips were now incredibly full and sexy, and had a pouty look to <br />
them.<br />
<br />
Then, his clothes started to change right before Kyle's eyes. They first <br />
shrank to match his new body size, then began to alter shape. his shirt sleeves were now <br />
gone and his shirt was becoming a black spaghetti strap top with a low-cut <br />
neckline revealing the cleavage between his now C-cup breasts, which he <br />
could feel were now restrained by a bra. He looked down and realized his pants were still <br />
around his ankles from when Jennifer had arrived, but instead of his pants and boxers, the <br />
garmets onthe floor were totally alien to him. He pulled them up and a pained expression <br />
came on to his face as he saw that it was a pair of read panties (matching his bra he <br />
assumed) and a leather mini-skirt that left almost nothing to the imagination. As soon as <br />
he had these new clothes around his waist his socks slid up his now his smooth brown <br />
legs, stoping about mid-thigh and turning white. <br />
Kyle felt through the dress below his waist and realized whatever had been <br />
down there before was now history.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare?&quot; He asked a smug Jennifer in a high, breathy alto.<br />
&quot;Transform&quot;<br />
&quot;Turn back to the way you were before you turned into an asian girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer lauged as her former body was restored. When she was fully back to normal she <br />
grabbed some clothes from Kyle's parents room and went to the door.<br />
&quot;Have a nice life, Kylie!&quot; She gave another cackle and slammed the door, leaving Kyle still <br />
standing on the landing above the stairs in a stunned silence....</p>
