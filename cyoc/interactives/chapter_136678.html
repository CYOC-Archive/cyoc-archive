<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa was both overjoyed and saddened by Ann&#39;s news. Happy that her sister would remain an adult yet saddened that Ann was so lonely. As Ann now packed up her car to head home, Lisa found herself helping her with her luggage.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I can do this myself Lisa,&quot; Ann smirked. &quot;And besides should you really be lifting in your condition. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Lisa said dismissively. &quot;I mean I just found out I&#39;m pregnant so their won&#39;t be any restrictions for awhile. Besides I&#39;m more worries about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann smiled at her sister, closing the trunk before giving her a hug. &quot;Don&#39;t worry sis,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I&#39;ll be okay. I&#39;ll try cutting down on my workload, maybe start looking for something close by. I do know that I am going to try to be around more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You better,&quot; Lisa smirked. &quot;If this kid is anything like the other two, I&#39;m pretty sure all sorts if weird magic is going to take place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann hugged her sister and Jason before turning to her nieces. Katie and Gloria smiled at Ann before embracing the woman in a tight hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take it easy Aunt Ann,&quot; they said. &quot;Keep in touch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann smiled before looking over their shoulder. Jackie had come from home to see her off. The youmg brunette had a sad smile on her face as she looked at Ann.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey everyone,&quot; Ann asked. &quot;Could you give me and Jackie a few moments alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others complied with Ann making their way inside. Only Gloria stopped for a moment, hugging Ann once more before whispering something. Once everyone was inside Ann and Jackie foumd themselves alone with eachother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you came,&quot; Ann said sadly. &quot;Was hoping to see you before I left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t just let my best friend leave without giving her a hug,&quot; Jackie answered. The two smiled as they embraced eachother in a tight hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I menat what I said Ann,&quot; Jackie whispered. Ann nodded, smiling sadly at the girl. &quot;I know Jackie,&quot; she aaid quietly. &quot;And...as crazy as it sounds. I feel the same way. I never thought I would say that but...well thinking it over...i feel the same way. Just want us though to remain friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if we&#39;re the best, &quot; Ann sniffed as she once again hugged Ann.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont cry Jackie,&quot; Ann soothed. &quot;I hate seeing you cry. Besides I wanted to ask you a question?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A question,&quot; Jackie sniffed wiping her eyes. &quot;Okay sure what is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Ann smirked. &quot;Ever since that kiss I was wondering. How old were you when you had your first kiss?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie looked at Ann curiously as she trued to rack her brain. &quot;Huh let me think,&quot; she said thoughtfully. &quot;I think I was 12. It was stupid really. I was at a dance and kissed some boy on the dance floor. Funny thing is I dont even remember his name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;12 huh,&quot; Ann said impishly. &quot;Same here, guess we have even more in common than we thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kackie grinned as she now looked at Ann. As she was doing so she noticed something different about her. Ann looked younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann,&quot; she gasped. &quot;Your...your getting younger!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann smiled as she gazed at her youthful reflection in the car window. The woman had already reentered her twenties and showed no signs of slowing down.  &quot;Yeah,&quot; a now 25 year old smiled. &quot;I guess I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie went slack jawed as Ann left her 20s and became a teen again. The womans curves slowly began to recede into her body, her blouse becoming wrinkled, while her jeans began to sag on her narrowing hips.  &quot;How...how is this possible Ann!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amm giggled girlishly as she once again found herself 14. Ann&#39;s breasts now barely pushed out her blouse while her jeans began to accordian around her feet as she began to shrink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gloria let me borrow the ring for a moment,&quot; she said as she became 13. &quot;Oh and by the way Im not the only one getting younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie gave the girl a confused look before looking herself over. &quot;Oh my gosh,&quot; she gasped.<br />
<br />
Jackies clothing now appeared baggy on her. The sweater she was wearing had crept over her wrist while her jeans sagged, bunching up around her feet. As she now ran her hands over her body she found her curves were now barely flared while her breasts had been reduced to sofrball sized mounds. Quickly she gazed in the car window only to see her 12 year old face gaping at her.&quot;What the hell Ann,&quot; she chirped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Ann said as she too became 12. &quot;There was something I wanted us to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie frowned as she looked at her diminutive friend. Ann had shrank considerably, the sleeves of her blouse have covered her hands while her jeans appeared dangerously close to falling off her boyish frame. As she looked at the cute girl she could see shoulder length blond hair framing a shy, innocent face. To Jackie the girl in front od her appeared to be playing dressup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well spill it,&quot; Jackie groaned. &quot;Feeling really embarassed looking like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amm smiled, carefully she stepped over to Jackie, almost losing her shoes in the process. When she stood in front of the girl she leaned in, giving the girl a tender yet innocent kiss.<br />
<br />
Jackie stood stunned for a moment blinking in shock at the shy young blond in front of her.  &quot;Hopefully that first kiss is a little more memorable,&quot; Ann smirked.<br />
<br />
After growing herself and Jackie grew up Ann said her goodbyes, promising to call everyone (including Jackie) soon. The ride back was uneventful for Ann, arriving at her apartment as the sun was setting. Quickly discarding her flats she quickly threw her lunch for tomorrow togwther before eating some left over turkey. <br />
<br />
Following dinner Ann changed into her favorite outfit, an old college t-shirt, sleeppants and her fuzzy purple slippers. Settling onto the couch she sighed, looking for the remote. Ann paused though when she saw a manilla envelope sitting on thw coffee table. Curiously she picked it up, noticing an attached note.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann,&quot; it read. &quot;I know it was a difficult decision you had to make this weekend. I had high hopes for you and Jackie but this just wasn&#39;t the right time. Hopefully in the future you two can come together. For now though take this as a reminder of not only the joy you found this weekend, but the joy that you can look forward too for many years to come.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann could see the note was signed by Merlin. Picking up the envelope she cautiously opened it before smiling. &quot;Thanks Merlin,&quot; she smiled, wiping her eyes.<br />
<br />
Ann now gazed at a picture of her and Jackie when the two girls were 22. The two of them were smiling happily, hugging eachother as they gazed at the camera. Inscribed on the picture Ann read three words. Best. Friends. Forever.</p>
