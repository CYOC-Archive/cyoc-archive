<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Helen slept in the hospital safe room; spooned and secured by the powerful embrace of Peter Talbot, a were-lion. The heat driving her to mate, quelled for the moment; yet her dreams were anything but peaceful.<br />
<br />
Running in the woods fearful for what is after her Helen gasps as she starts to feel tired. Her ears twitch as Helen hears a twig snapping. Turning around to the source of the sound; Helen is met by a large were-lioness. Her claws bared and snarling; stalking the tiny were-rabbit mercilessly.<br />
“To think you could wander about the pride grounds and not be considered a meal,” The were-lioness licking her lips; drooling at the smell of fear coming from the poor were-rabbit. “I’m going to enjoy consuming your tender flesh.”<br />
<br />
Helen panics as the were-lioness tenses; readying to pounce. Her heart beating furiously at the inevitable; Helen screams as she hears the were-lioness growl. Closing her eyes as she doesn’t want to witness the inevitable; Helen’s ears twitch as a large angry roar booms through the woods. The were-lioness’s ears swiveling as she too hears the deafening sound. Helen opens her eyes to see a flash of golden fur strike the were-lioness that was stalking her. Snarling and roaring could be heard as Helen witnesses two were-lions fighting; one male and the other female.<br />
<br />
Scared and afraid as she slowly backs up not wanting to be a part of the fight; Helen gasps as the were-lioness yelps and grows still. The lifeless body under the male as he gets up and lets off a beastly roar of triumph. Helen truly afraid and wanting to leave; she finds her attempt to escape  thwarted as the male already grasping her and staring at her intently.<br />
“I promised you Helen,” The were-lion speaking softly; “I will always protect you. Anyone who dares to harm you will regret it,” the were-lion growling protectively.<br />
<br />
Helen pauses as she stares at the were-lion; finally recognizing his soulful and kind eyes; the fear in her melts away as she happily embraces her savior.<br />
“Oh Peter,” Helen crying; “I thought I was done for.”<br />
“Hush my love,” Peter nuzzling her affectionately; “now let’s return to my father. He will need to know of this transgression,” Peter looking at the now dead were-lioness; her throat torn open and her copper smelling blood already soaking into the forest floor.<br />
<br />
Helen gasps as she wakes up from the terrible dream she just had. That feeling of terror enveloping her as she breathes hard. Trying to get up and finding herself unable to move only fuels that fear within her; the rabbit screaming to run and flee as danger is near. Hearing the large snores coming from behind her thanks to her large rabbit like ears; Helen nearly cries as she struggles to break free of the iron like grip keeping her in place.<br />
“Stop struggling,” an all too familiar voice for Helen speaking up; “Peter isn’t going to let go anytime soon.”<br />
<br />
Helen looks up to see her were-rabbit self, staring back at her smiling as Helen continues to struggle.<br />
“Really,” Helen’s other half shaking her head; “keep still. We have things to discuss.”<br />
“About what,” Helen panicking; doing her best to break free, despite Peter’s strong grip on her.<br />
“Well for one thing; the were-rabbit smiling; “that amazing bout of primal passion you two just shared a few hours ago.”<br />
“Oh god,” Helen’s ears drooping; “we did it again didn’t we.”<br />
“Oh yeah,” the were-rabbit grinning; sitting on the bed to be next to Helen; “and it was far better than the first time.”<br />
“I must be going mad,” Helen panicking; “this heat cycle is making me talk to myself.”<br />
“That is true,” the were-rabbit answering; “want to hear something else that is true?”<br />
“What,” Helen dreading the response.<br />
“I’m not going away until Peter extinguishes your heat cycle;” the were-rabbit grinning and winking; “whether or not we get pregnant as a result remains to be seen.”<br />
<br />
Helen gasps as she wakes up yet again. The large mass behind her grunting as she involuntarily kicks and flails violently trying to get free.<br />
“Calm down,” Peter nearly roaring; “I’m not going to hurt you.”<br />
“I’ve got to get out of here,” Helen panicking; “you need to let me go!”<br />
“I’ll let you go,” Peter loosening his grip so Helen can jump off the bed; “but neither of us is leaving the room for a while. Doctor Tachibana saw to that,” Peter growling the name.<br />
<br />
It takes a few moments of Helen trying to open the door to the hospital safe room for her to realize that it is secured and not going to unlock anytime soon. Turning around to see a smiling were-lion purring; his tail twitching as his feline member rises from his sheath, eager for another round of sex.<br />
“You know,” Peter speaking to the frightened were-rabbit; “that tiny pink nose at the end of your muzzle, is your best feature. I enjoy seeing it constantly twitch,” Peter grinning; “as you breathe.”<br />
<br />
Helen was stunned at the comment Peter gave; completely taken aback at his compliment, she trepidly approaches Peter as he pats the bed motioning her to get back in.<br />
“Most were-rabbits I’ve been with mostly stare at my ears and use that god awful joke ‘what’s up doc’,” Helen speaking nervously as she stares into Peter’s gentle eyes.<br />
“I’m not a were-rabbit,” Peter chuckling; “plus I meant what I said about your nose. It is your best feature.”<br />
“What else do you like about me,” Helen getting curious as she climbs back into bed.<br />
“You have these amazing blue eyes,” Peter placing a paw and gently cupping Helen’s muzzle. “You have soft fur,” Peter delicately stroking Helen’s face; “a delightful voice and perfect curves.”<br />
<br />
Helen Tompkins could not believe what she was seeing or hearing; this brutish were-lion that was her patient being gentle and kind. Showing a softer side she never thought existed. But what surprises her more, is that she likes what Peter is saying and letting him disarm her completely.<br />
<br />
Shivering as she feels Peter run his large paws all over her body; listening to his purring as he lays down on the bed, allowing her to climb on top of him. His paws gently gripping her delicate arms; Helen gasps and moans as she slowly lowers herself on to Peter’s rod.<br />
“Oooooh,” Helen’s muzzle cracking a smile for the first time; “compliment me more Peter.&quot;<br />
“You have such warm and tender cheeks,” Peter growling as he enjoys Helen riding him; “the ones on your muzzle. Your white fluffy cotton ball tail accentuates your perfect bottom.”<br />
“More Peter,” Helen closing her eyes; her paws on Peter’s chest ruffling his large mane as she swoons, the barbs on Peter’s feline member stimulating her sex.<br />
“You have a very cute looking fur covered belly button,” Peter staring to roar as his climax build; “beautiful hips and pert breasts that are warm and soft.”<br />
“Oh god,” Helen liking what she hears; “put your paws on my breasts, pleasure me completly.”<br />
<br />
Peter didn’t need to be asked twice as he grabs the bouncing melons; squeezing them gently as he stares at Helen’s face contorting in pure enjoyment.<br />
“Tease my nipples,” Helen panting; “I feel my climax coming.”<br />
Peter could also feel his body tensing up as he complied to Helen’s request; running his claws all over Helen’s breasts, lightly scratching the exposed peaks as Helen squeals in pleasure. Placing his paws back on Helen’s hips as he feels a pressure building up at the base of his shaft surging up and bursting forth. Roaring as he climaxes; Peter watches as Helen arches her back and moan loudly as her own orgasm hits her.<br />
<br />
Panting as Helen lays on top of Peter feeling him embracing her protectively. Using Peter’s chest as a pillow as she feels him heave his chest up and down with each breath; hearing his heart beating strongly and loudly despite the purring coming from the were-lion.<br />
“Promise me one thing Peter,” Helen enjoying the moment; “Promise me you will always keep me safe.”<br />
“I promise Helen,” Peter licking the top of Helen’s head lovingly; “I will always protect you my mate.”<br />
“Oh Peter,” Helen swooning; “hold me close, I don’t want this moment to end.”</p>
