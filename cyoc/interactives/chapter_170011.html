<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat finally decided that she needed a rest, and went to pull out, or at least that was her plan. However, she quickly found out that she was stuck. Not only was she stuck, but felt connected somehow to Dani, through her cock and his pussy. <br />
<br />
Kat went to turn around, to try and get a better look, and found that when her leg moved, Dani&#39;s did too. His back legs were copying her own legs&#39; every movement like they were her own. &quot;Dani like, can&#39;t control Dani&#39;s legs! Kat, like seriously, why can&#39;t Dani&#39;s legs move? Dani is scared.&quot; Dani was freaking out. For one, he for some reason was only able to think of himself as being Dani, technically a boy, but with the body of a well endowed girl, save for his massive cock and balls. Second, her body wasn&#39;t even her own anymore, since Kat controlled her legs now. Third, while he had enjoyed getting pounded by his own sister&#39;s cock, he had loved it way too much, way more than he should have. And finally fourth, he would be in need of a milking soon, as his breasts, though udders may be their more accurate description now, were filling up quite fast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, stuck is stuck, but at least I can make this work, for a little while.&quot; Kat said offhandedly, not even considering her brother&#39;s opinion. Kat suddenly had an idea though. One which she really wanted to try out. <br />
<br />
Spreading her legs out wide, which did the same for Dani, she reached underneath them and pulled back on Dani&#39;s massive pair of balls so that they stuck out behind him and underneath her. She then closed her legs back to their normal stance, which also trapped his balls behind his legs. Happy with this, Kat sat down on them, using them as her new seat. She also set her legs up to wrap them around his raised ass. Luckily, she found that if she focused hard enough, that she could move her legs independently from Dani&#39;s. Now the majority of her weight was resting on her brothers balls. She hadn&#39;t neglected to remember how sensitive to pain they were for men, and did a small fix for Dani.<br />
<br />
To Dani, having his balls sat on by Kat felt amazing. Nothing like how he had expected. It was like her ass was applying just the right amount of pressure he needed to feel the most amount of pleasure before it tiped over into pain. Dani felt a tingle in her balls, as some kind of additional magic was applied, fixing them into their new spot to serve as Kat&#39;s seat. From now on, every step he took would now bob Kat up and down onto his balls, making them feel amazing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, do you like what I did?&quot; Teased Kat. &quot;I just felt that as my mount, you should be properly carrying my weight. I mean really, why even have a mount if you have to walk with your own legs anyways? You&#39;d better be grateful that I at least turned your pain receptors into pleasure receptors when it comes to your balls, and also increased their strength so that I don&#39;t crush them.&quot; <br />
<br />
He was indeed greatful for that. And found himself for some reason agreeing with her logic about having a mount. It made sense that since he was now her mount, he should carry her weight. Wait a minute, why was he suddenly so ok with being her mount? Isn&#39;t that basically letting her make him practically just an animal? He is a human being, not a horse. And she was attached to him. Wouldn&#39;t that make her equal to him in terms of statuses anyways? Oww, damn these things are sore. Fuck it, I can&#39;t deal with them anymore than this. Come on Dani, just ask her to milk you. You can&#39;t deny it anymore. &quot;Hey Kat, just like, FYI, but Dani&#39;s tits are like, totally full right now. And Dani could like, seriously go for a like, a super good milking right now, K? Their sorness like, sucks major dick, wait, thats like, not even a bad thing. I kinda now like, wanna like, seriously suck some major dick. Dick tastes like, so good, you know? Dani means it Kat. Find yourself like the buggest, longest, and fattest of dicks and just like, cram it down your throat. And like, even cum tastes like, super yummy. Wait, what were we like, talking about? Dani can&#39;t even like, remembers and stuff. Oww, Dani&#39;s boobies are like sooooo fuuuullllllll! Dani like, can&#39;t even milk them. Kat, can younseriously like, milk Dani&#39;s titties? Dani &#39;ll even like, throw in a free blowjob or something if you want.&quot; Dani waited for Kat&#39;s response. He hated his forced speech patterns, and also how much sucking a fat dick actually appealed to him now. He found it so appealing now that he had gone off on a tangent about it just now. His mind was slowly becoming one with the horny bimbo slut he was forced to speak like, and he didn&#39;t enjoy it, yet...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahahahahaha, Oh my fucking god that was hilarious. You like sucking fat dick! You are such a horny slut now. Hahahaha You may as well just become a girl. Hahaha. Hey sis, ssssnnnk-haha, sorry, sorry. Mhmhmhh, sorry. Ok, for real though. Sorry. I have definitely taken this way too far. I will start looking for a way to undo all of this so don&#39;t worry. Although, having younremain a sluty bimbo girl wouldn&#39;t exactly be the worst outcome imo. I&#39;ve always wanted a younger sister. What do you think, sis?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dani wants to be like, normal Dani again.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really, is thats all, no joking?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dani like, just wants to be back to normal Dani.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, fine. Let me keep you as my mount for the rest of the afternoon at least, then I will turn you back into normal Dani. And again, I&#39;m actually really sorry about taking it this far.&quot;</p>
