<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A faint, warm breeze ran over his back, leaving in a comfortable daze. The cushion he seemed to be lying on was a bit solid, it seemed. You wouldn&#39;t be able to just sink into it. His blanket seemed to be covering every part of him somehow, all while having it not too hot.<br />
<br />
Samuel slowly woke up in this dazed state, feeling a scorching heat upon both his arms, the only limbs not covered by this large blanket of comfort. All felt strange, the slightest movement seemed to cause the sound of an avalanche falling nearby. If he moved his right arm, his upper body would be assaulted by thousands and thousands of tiny particles flowing onto him. Only then, when these particles flowed onto him, his neck and back seemed to be protected by the bright lamp that burnt his skin.<br />
<br />
He opened his eyes.<br />
<br />
Sand?<br />
<br />
He lifted his head from his cushion.<br />
<br />
Is that sand?<br />
<br />
Samuel was still groggy, it was as if he was still experiencing a dream, not particularly a good one, neither was it a nightmare.<br />
<br />
He bent his neck, to look to the right. He found himself looking up a hill covered with sand and dust particles, sometimes, here and there, they would roll down the hill, but for what was left, completely motionless.<br />
<br />
He raised himself with both his arms, only to realize he&#39;d been covered by it.<br />
<br />
The sand, that is.<br />
<br />
Wasn&#39;t he in a house the night before? Didn&#39;t he get to sleep in a bed with a normal blanket, and a normal cushion? What was this all about?<br />
<br />
Having completely resurfaced, he shook off the sand that stuck to him. Dust particles seemed to be harder to get off, but he tried anyway. That brought something else to his attention. What was with his skin? It had turned an olive colour. Was he burned that badly by the sun? His hands were so small too. His arms were so slender too. His legs were so short too. His hair was so long... too.<br />
<br />
The grey shirt he was wearing was sticking out. Two lumps seemed to cause it.<br />
<br />
The dust had crawled underneath his shirt as well, so Samuel took it off.<br />
<br />
He looked down, and he regretted it. His hands started trembling, muscles twitching, his heart beating. A panic attack.<br />
<br />
He touched them, they felt soft, as suspected. He groped them, massaged them. They felt nice, obviously.<br />
<br />
How long had it been since breaking up with his girlfriend? They felt nice, but not in a way he expected.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d grown breasts...<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; Sam asked himself, underneath his breath. He could hear a faint higher pitch from his voice, which he never from himself before. He was fully awake now, and adrenaline started surging throughout his body. He saw the effects immediately, as the nipples on the tips of his breasts started to stick out.<br />
<br />
He twitched them gently, it filled him with pleasure.<br />
<br />
Back to his senses. He had to ignore it. He stood up and dusted his shirt off. He looked at it hesitantly, seeing stains of his sweat, under the holes his arms went through, but also, symmetrically in the middle of his shirt somehow. He felt underneath one of the breasts, and pulled his hand away after a few seconds again, looking at it. He saw it was moist.<br />
<br />
Sam shook his head again. &quot;All just a strange dream&quot;, was what he repeated to himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where am I?!&quot; He shouted in a high pitch. Around him he saw nothing but sand, how did he turn up in the middle of the desert? It must be a dream after all!<br />
<br />
He started taking a few steps forward, noticing how his balance, and his sense of it, had both shifted... forward. &quot;Can&#39;t even trust my senses&quot;, He muttered, &quot;definitely a dream&quot;, he chuckled.<br />
<br />
He was walking in small circles around the place he lay just a few minutes ago. He peered into the distance. He was thirsty. It looked like an oasis. That there, what he was looking at. <br />
<br />
He took a few steps in that direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHK!&quot; It wasn&#39;t the womanliest of cries, but a jolt of pain surged through his body as Sam had taken a 3rd step. He took a step back. He brought a hand forward, pointing a finger in the direction he wanted to go. Another pain hit him! This time it jolted through his arm throughout his whole body. A force field withheld him from moving on. What the hell is going on?<br />
<br />
He manned up, if you could call it that, and headed forward again, walking on.<br />
<br />
The pain was almost unbearable! A force kept trying to drive him back to where he lay as he woke up, and he could only take one step at a time.<br />
<br />
That was until his legs gave way, and vanished as he looked at them. He thought he&#39;d fall, but his vision flung backwards, as that same force from before shot him back to where he started. He tried to dig his fingers into the sand, but failed to do so, as the ground moved with him. Sam screamed as his legs had somehow sunk to the ground, and he went into a blind panic as his had too drowned into the sand. It was as if he flew into a tunnel while going backwards, unable to look behind him.<br />
<br />
He ended up in complete darkness.<br />
<br />
He started crying, his emotions overflowed him, and let him down. Tears which he couldn&#39;t see flowed along his cheeks, to the tip of his chin, he felt. At least he still had the sense of touching things, and hearing stuff. But all he could hear was the echoes of his weeping, and drops of his own misery falling to the ground thanks to the gravity in this spacious, but dark room. <br />
<br />
Samuel tried to look around. On his own eye level he could see absolutely nothing, nor below it. He felt no sand anymore, nor did he feel that he had any clothes on. Had these disappeared as well right now? The view of those breasts were brought in his sight again. That thought was both horrifying and amusing, maybe even arousing. Probably the latter. He felt the same way as back then, and also felt something on his chest area getting, perhaps painfully, erect. The tears had stopped flowing. Sam lied down.<br />
<br />
He stared into a void of nothingness, however repetitive that might sound. But in that void, he managed to see a spec of light somehow. He brought his hand towards it, only thinking to himself he shouldn&#39;t have done that. His vision shifted quickly as the spec of light expanded. He screamed, the echo repeating that sentence of scare.<br />
<br />
Somehow, that echo disappeared. His screaming went on, as he saw the familiar desert around him, the sky above him. He&#39;d been flung into the sky.<br />
<br />
From the ground into the sky, back onto the surface again. Sam was rewarded with a mouthful of sand in the end.<br />
<br />
He coughed and coughed and spat out the sand, then gasped for breath. He looked around him again then up into the sky. Seeing the blazing sun above him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same place, same time still.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam ran forward again, raging now, only to be knocked back by that cursed force. It must&#39;ve been a couple of meters, he realized. As he landed on the desert sand, the impact violently took away his breath. He&#39;d hit his head on something hard too, a rock probably. Whatever it was, he rubbed the spot where it hit him. It had given him a splitting headache. He turned around.<br />
<br />
Despite the crystallizing reflections of the grains of sand all around him, looking behind him, from where he was flung into the sky, he saw an object lying in the sand, which he hadn&#39;t noticed before. He lept towards it. That thing was the only thing besides him that didn&#39;t seem to naturally belong in the desert. He dug it up, and as he grabbed it, held it in front of him.<br />
<br />
A lamp.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
A magic lamp! A blue glow seemed to emit from it.<br />
<br />
Samuel rubbed it on the side. But let go of it as the light grew stronger. The lamp stayed afloat. Simultaneously, that glow emitted from himself as well. He grew scared again, like anyone who&#39;d never believed in magic. What had happened to him? Were he and the lamp connected?<br />
<br />
What did he have to do? Make a wish?<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I wasn&#39;t thirsty anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as quickly as that glow erupted from the lamp, it faded, and the magic lamp fell to the ground. The supernatural occurrences had faded.<br />
<br />
Samuel felt his throat.<br />
<br />
Saliva was running through his mouth again, as his thirst was gone, but his hunger was now striking up. The wish had worked, apparently. He, picked up the object again, rubbing it on the side.<br />
<br />
Now there was no glow anymore. Could he still try wishing?<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I was male again.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked down, no faint blue light, no floating lamp, and still those two lumps, ignoring the part Samuel wanted to think the about the least. His breaths were still there, what the hell? It didn&#39;t work? The wish didn&#39;t work when he wanted it to work the most?!<br />
<br />
In his anger he flung the lamp away, watching it soar through the air. He watched it land. Eventually it lied still on the desert surface.<br />
<br />
WHAM! As if a gust of wind flung him forward. Jolts of pain surged as that unknown force threw him through the air, the same direction the lamp went. Now his arms broke his fall, instead of having to bite into the sand. He rolled on a bit further, unable to control whereto, until he landed right next to the magic lamp. Another supernatural phenomenon he&#39;d never seen or heard of before. Sam and the lamp were interconnected, this confirmed it for him.<br />
<br />
He grabbed the lamp and held it in his hand. He carefully started taking a few steps forward.<br />
<br />
Not having felt that painful force yet, the steps evolved into a walk, and Sam eventually caught himself running.<br />
<br />
Running up and down these desert hills.<br />
<br />
&quot;But now is not the time!&quot; He thought to himself, gathering his breath again.<br />
<br />
Holding the magic lamp by its handle, Samuel started walking, to wherever this journey might lead him.</p>
