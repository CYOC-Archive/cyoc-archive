<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You still remember about the disgusting nerd that crawled up your desk like a pesky vermin and confessed the true feelings he felt for you in front of everyone. You had came out as gay the day before, and your classmates had been very accepting. You’ve always been a muscular stud so it’s not like anybody would dare to laugh at your face anyway. <br />
<br />
But for the flabby obese guy with glasses it was the complete opposite of that. Everybody mocked and laughed at the undateable gay nerd when he confessed his love for the big bodybuilder that you were. Your reaction wasn’t any different, and the way you laughed at the small ball of lard for his completely outrageous proposition shattered his heart to pieces.<br />
<br />
“How could you do this to me?! I loved you way before you came out from the closet!” The tiny nerd cried with his tears falling down on his voluptious moobs. He was a pitiful sight to behold, and that only made the laughter and the mockery for the sorry excuse for a man increase.<br />
“C’mon, dude. You surely already know I’m way outta your league.” You replied coldly. “Go home and play with your little dickie for a bit, it’ll make your hormones go down.”<br />
The small pudgy man didn’t seem to appreciate your piece of advice. “That’s... none of your business! And my dick isn’t *that* small!” You and your friends chuckled. “Agh! That’s not what I meant! I... Waaaaagh! I curse you, I curse you and your tasty-looking dick!” He whined and took off running like a little porky from the slaughterhouse.<br />
<br />
That happened last week. Nobody had seen the small nerd since then. During lunchtime at the cafeteria some of your peers came over to ask you if you knew anything, and you just replied with: “He’s fine. The little guy’s probably too ashamed to show up. Anyway, have you heard he’s gayer than me?”<br />
“Oh, yeah. He’s a total fairy behind those thick-framed glasses of his.” Added Mike. He was one of your best friends and also the hottest guy on the football team. What a shame he was straight, you’d have loved to make him suck your cock in the changing rooms after every single match. He was currently seated in front of you eating a tuna sandwich.<br />
“Why’s everybody so concerned about the nerd all of a sudden?” You wondered out loud.<br />
“Everybody’s just morbid. They love juicy rumors about anyone, no matter how worthless.” He said nonchalantly as he took a bite at his sandwich.<br />
<br />
“Why do you like eating fish so much?” You asked him casually after a while.<br />
“It’s healthier than those huge sausages you eat every day.”<br />
“Well, you know I like ‘em real big!” You stared at his generous bulge.<br />
“Oh, just quit it, Derek...” Mike scolded you as he grabbed a big plastic cup filled to the brim with cola.<br />
“And now the promising football star, Mr. Oh-so-healthy, is going to drink cola...!” You commented.<br />
“Hey, I need the caffeine!” Mike said as he took hold of a pink plastic straw and placed it on the cup.<br />
Suddenly, you felt like you really needed to pee. You stood up. “I’m off to the bathroom...”<br />
“Jerk it real good.” Mike said.<br />
“And then they say I’m the perverted one...”<br />
<br />
You walked through the cafeteria with a slight pain on your crotch. It was like your bladder had been completely filled up in an instant. Dang, it’s not like you had drank that much. But then why did it felt like your crotch was about to burst...?<br />
<br />
“Woah!” A huge yanking feeling came out from your crotch and you fell down to the floor. “Uh... Sorry, I slipped...” You quickly made an excuse as you stood up back up. Some students turned around to look but they didn’t give the accident much thought when they saw that it had been you. They’d be nuts to laugh at a stud like you after all.<br />
<br />
<br />
You headed to the bathroom door. For some reason you didn’t feel like peeing anymore. Fearing the worst you quickly felt your crotch. When you were certain your pants were dry, you let out a sigh of relief. It would be really embarrassing if you were to have that sort of accident on campus. Still, something about your crotch was... different. You felt like you had a huge hardon yet your penis felt way too thin for that to be true.<br />
<br />
You walked towards the urinals. There was another dude peeing there. You took a quick peek at his equipment. Uncut. 4 inches soft. Apparently a grower. Nice bush.<br />
You stood next to him and unfastened your belt. You lowered your jeans with confidence and...<br />
Uh.<br />
“UH?!” You stammered in surprise.<br />
There in your crotch, surrounded by black pubic hair, lay a pink plastic straw.<br />
There wasn’t anything else.<br />
Your penis was gone!<br />
<br />
“WHAT THE HELL?!” You cried out in utter panic.<br />
The other dude looked at you quizzically.<br />
“Wh...what’s this...?! Wh...where...is my...?!” You grabbed the plastic straw and tried to pull i t off you. It was attached to your body, right where your cock and balls had been this same morning, but you didn’t feel anything at all when you prodded the alien object.<br />
“Hey, aren’t you Derek from the football team...?” The other guy said as he zipped up his own equipment.<br />
“I... Yeah, but... I mean... Look at this!” You flashed him your straw as you pointed at it in bewilderment.<br />
“I know you just came out from the closet last week but that doesn’t mean you can’t just shove your genitals into other people’s faces like that!”<br />
“What? But... I mean... Look at it! It’s a fucking piece of plastic!”<br />
“I really don’t care about your junk, dude. You’re gonna get us both in trouble if you go exhibiting yourself like that...” He rolled his eyes and left.<br />
Okay, this was getting weirder by the second. That guy just acted like you having an extremely fragile straw for a dick was normal.<br />
You checked on the floor. You checked all over your pants and underwear. But you didn’t find any hint of your penis. You had a strange idea. You went to the urinal and pointed your plastic straw at it like it were a real penis and eventually... piss started flowing through it!<br />
“Oh, shit, oh shit, I must be hallucinating...” You had just peed through your plastic straw. That decidedly meant that the straw connected to your body. Still, no matter how much you squeezed and jerked it with your fingers it felt like a completely insensitive piece of plastic. You couldn’t live with something like this for dick! You needed pleasure...!<br />
Hold on. Maybe when you tripped, back in the cafeteria... It was worth a shot.<br />
<br />
When you finished fastening your belt it felt so strange. On the outside, you looked like your usual self. But instead of your huge cock hanging proudly, you had a plastic straw tucked down and it barely made a bulge. You felt really insecure walking with a drinking straw for a dick. Still, your real dick could still be out there. You had to catch it, and quick!<br />
You headed back to the cafeteria and searched through the floor really thoroughly. Alas, you didn’t find anything but dust and dried up pieces of chewed gum.<br />
It would be easier if you split up your search, but it’s not like you could just walk to your friends and ask them to search for a stray penis.<br />
<br />
You went to the tray area and saw a box full of pink straws. For some reason, looking at all those straws, ripe for anyone to grab one, use it and ultimately throw the feeble things into the trash made you feel even more self-conscious about your current sexual equipment.<br />
“Hey, Derek!” You heard Mike say. “Took you long enough. Did you enjoy the wank?”<br />
“Shut up, Mike. I’m in the middle of something important.” You told him without bothering to look up at him.<br />
“Yeesh, aren’t you in a sour mood today.” Mike just shrugged and went back to his cup.<br />
“Woah! What the...?!” You had just felt someone’s fingers brushing against your dick! Not the useless straw that hung inside your pants but your actual, fleshy cock that was lost somewhere! You had the ability to feel it remotely!<br />
Oh, that was great! If you can still feel your detached junk it means it could still be saved!<br />
...<br />
Oh, shit! If you can still feel your detached junk it means you’ll be really screwed if someone else has taken hold of it!<br />
<br />
“Where is it?! Who’s touching it?!” Just then, you saw it. Uncut. Over 8 and a half inches long. Currently hard. A shower. Balls covered in messy black hairs.<br />
And your ballsack was currently being submerged in Mike’s cup like a teabag.<br />
“MIKE! Give me that back right now!” You yelled at him.<br />
“Uh?” Mike gave you a dumbfounded look. “Give you back what?”<br />
“Isn’t it obvious?!” You pointed at the disembodied cock and balls swimming on his drink.<br />
“What? You want my cola? But I’ve already drank from it. Sharing a cup is unhealthy.” And as if to tease you he enveloped his lips on your exposed dickhead and started sucking it like it was the most natural thing to do in the world.<br />
“Ahhhh!” You felt a pleasurable jolt on your sensitive genitals... even though they weren’t attached! “Unnnngh!”<br />
You moaned in pleasure. Mike keep on sucking them like a pro. You could felt cola going through a small hole that had formed on your ballsack and the gassy liquid coming out through your urethra directly into Mike’s mouth.<br />
“Ohhh you’re very good at this...!” You said as you gave your pelvis a swift thrust.<br />
“...You know, you’re acting really weird today.” He said after a long sip.<br />
“Dude! Can’t you really see it?!”<br />
Mike was touching your rock-hard shaft like it was nothing special. Nobody seemed to act like some dude drinking from your penis was strange, either. Your friend began to walk away.<br />
“W-wait! Give me back my cock!”<br />
“Uh... Excuse me?” Mike stared at your bulge.<br />
He absent-mindedly sipped some more. Oh shit! It felt so amazing yet so wrong! You could feel his tongue quenching its thirst thanks to your boner... Every single sip drained your balls considerably. He was literally sucking you dry and it felt awesome. Still, your penis only had one home and that was your crotch. But Mike didn’t seem to understand why you wanted back the thing he was using to drink...<br />
Wait, if everyone thinks your cock is a straw, maybe you could applying this improbable logic by testing a different approach.<br />
“Dude, just... give me your straw.”<br />
“Uh, this one?” Mike took hold of your dick and took it out from the cup. Small droplets of cola were dripping from your balls. The air caressing your genitals made you felt exposed to the whole cafeteria. You felt like coming out from the cold water after a swim on the sea, the change in temperature becoming obvious to you. “Sure, I don’t mind. As long as you don’t use my saliva for some crazy voodoo ritual.” He joked and threw your genitals to your face.<br />
“Woah!” You could smell your cock and balls’ masculine essence. You unglued the reeking junk away from your face and immediately felt a yanking feeling on your crotch.<br />
<br />
<br />
It took less than two seconds. One moment you were holding your own penis and balls, the very next moment you were holding an ordinary pink straw. Your cock and the piece of plastic had swapped places in an instant, interchanging their places faster than opposing magnets.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” You exclaimed. The whole thing had been a surreal experience for you. Why had it happened? Was it an illusion? Was it over, or was this just the beginning?<br />
<br />
The bell chimed, which meant lunch break was over and classes were about to resume. Students began to stood up and leave.<br />
“Tch, tch. Treasure your manhood while it lasts. The curse’s barely started.”<br />
You thought you just saw a very overweight shadow brushing against you and saying something under his breath, but when you turned around he was gone. Weird. You turned back to Mike and said your farewells.<br />
“See you later, Derek.” Mike smiled at you and you saw a few droplets of cola still dripping from his lips, all thanks to your dick. Still in a shock for what had just happened, you patted your crotch. Yes, your genitals were there. And they were hard as a rock and ready for more thanks to the blowjob Mike had just gave you. Oh, fuck, Mike was a natural born cocksucker!</p>
