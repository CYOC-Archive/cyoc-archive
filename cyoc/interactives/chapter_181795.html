<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Life&#39;s getting a bit better on my end. Hopefully not as much time will elapse before my next contribution and everyone else is safe and sound.—TMW.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William Anderson arrived home from another day of work. It&#39;s not that he didn&#39;t love being an English Professor but that he loved his wife, family, and private time just as much, if not more so at times.<br />
As he entered the front door of his Moon Lake residence, William didn&#39;t need his vulpine senses to smell the delectable aroma of a roast cooking in the oven. Standing by the living room couch, he set down his briefcase and quickly stripped out of his clothing before assuming his fursona.<br />
He had grown to relish the moment of change. To feel the fur rushing to cover his body as his arms and legs adjusted to their other form. The sensation of his hands and feet altering into paws as a bushy tail extended from his rear was rivaled by the changes to the rest of his body as his muzzle formed and ears drifted upward while gaining pointed tips.<br />
Soon it was no longer a middle aged human male but a werefox that stood in his living room.<br />
Stealthily William approached the kitchen door, his tail wagging in anticipation of what would be on the other side.<br />
He carefully opened it and saw his wife Martha at the oven.<br />
She was already proudly displaying her werecat fursona. An oversized apron and oven mitts were all she had on and the fact Martha was bent over checking on the roast was the only reason she hadn&#39;t already sensed her mate&#39;s presence.<br />
This was confirmed the moment she slid the roast back into the oven and closed the door.<br />
&quot;Hello dear,&quot; Martha said pleasantly, without turning around to face William directly.<br />
&quot;Do you know how beautiful you are?&quot; he asked, approaching her.<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve told me before, but I&#39;m sure you can find new ways to express that thought,&quot; Martha said confidently as the married couple embraced.<br />
William didn&#39;t need the werefox life/soulmate bond between them to feel the love he had for her and vice versa as they kissed.<br />
Some might think it odd for a werefox to be married to a werecat, but just about anything was possible in Moon Lake, Washington.<br />
When their muzzles parted William, still holding Martha&#39;s furry body against his, said, &quot;Where are the boys?&quot;<br />
&quot;Eric&#39;s upstairs doing homework and Nate hasn&#39;t come home yet from flag football practice,&quot; she answered.<br />
&quot;The big exhibition game Thanksgiving Day,&quot; he remembered, while breaking away just enough to check out what else was on the menu for dinner tonight.<br />
&quot;See anything you like?&quot; Martha asked slyly, as he looked over the rinsed carrots sitting in their cullender.<br />
&quot;Now that you mention it,&quot; William said, before he kissed her again. &quot;Do you think we might have time for....&quot;<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Martha said, looking at the kitchen wall clock as one of her paws drifted down to feel what her husband had between his furry legs.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Nate Anderson was walking along side his boyfriend and future husband Alex Ramsey.<br />
The two werewolves had fallen in love when Alex had inducted Nate into were society and had been inseparable ever since.<br />
&quot;I am so looking forward to this game,&quot; Alex said as they walked toward their respective homes.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; agreed Nate. &quot;The only thing I&#39;m worried about is the fact that the coaches haven&#39;t officially assigned everyone to their teams for the game. What if we wind up on opposite sides of the field?&quot; he asked as they started to turn a corner.<br />
&quot;I am afraid you gentlemen have more important things to worry about,&quot; a man said, as the teenagers suddenly found themselves facing two adult males.<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Alex demanded to know as the teenagers instinctively took a step back. A quick sniff told them they were facing two older werewolves, but otherwise...<br />
&quot;We mean you no harm Nathaniel Anderson and Alexander Ramsey,&quot; the man who spoke announced. &quot;I am Quintus Fives and this is my associate Gustavus Amehr,&quot; he said by way of introduction. &quot;The more important things I was referring to was the foolish decision of the Moon Lake Town Council to initiate a plan that would reveal were existence to the world.&quot;<br />
&quot;While I admit that I have my reservations about that, from what I&#39;ve heard that&#39;s not a done deal yet,&quot; said Nate.<br />
&quot;Yeah. Right now they&#39;re only talking about coming up with a potential plan. There&#39;s no guarantee they will come up with a feasible one, let alone one everyone will agree to,&quot; Alex pointed out.<br />
&quot;True,&quot; concurred Gustavus. &quot;But as fellow werewolves, we are hoping to rally all our lupine brethren to stand up against the Town Council and let our concerns be heard at the next Council meeting.&quot;<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t heard when the next one is scheduled to be yet. Have you?&quot; Nate asked Alex.<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; his boyfriend answered.<br />
&quot;Neither have we,&quot; conceded Quintus, &quot;but when the next hearing on the impending reveal is scheduled, can we count on your attendance and support?&quot;<br />
Both boys thought about it for a moment.<br />
&quot;As long as it isn&#39;t a school night,&quot; Nate finally answered.<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Alex said, uncertain what was going on but wanting to be out of there as soon as possible.<br />
&quot;Good. Until then,&quot; and with that Quintus Fives and Gustavus Amehr walked past them and left.<br />
While their acute senses were not quite as good in human form compared to their fursonas, they waited until long after the duo were no longer in range before Alex leaned toward Nate and whispered in his ear, &quot;We&#39;ve talked about the reveal before. What—&quot;<br />
&quot;I just wanted to be rid of those two as fast and as safely as possible,&quot; Nate whispered in his lover&#39;s ear, to make sure they were not overheard. &quot;As soon as I get home, I&#39;m reporting this to Mrs. Twist next door.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good idea,&quot; agreed Alex, as the two resumed their journey.<br />
<br />
Unknown to the boys, Quintus Fives and Gustavus Amehr had only walked around the corner and to their car parked across the street near where they met Nate and Alex.<br />
Once inside their vehicle, Gustavus turned to Quintus and said, &quot;I&#39;m uneasy about including civilians in our plans.&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand your point,&quot; began his partner, &quot;but even though they are not members of the Lunar Brotherhood, they are fellow werewolves. It is important to get as many lupines as possible in attendance at the next Council meeting to show we are serious about the Town Council not revealing were existence to the world, even if it winds up just being the two of us who actually teach them the errors of their ways.&quot;<br />
And with that, Quintus started the car and drove away.</p>
