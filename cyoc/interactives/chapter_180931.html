<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brandon was bored.<br />
Everything about life was completely and utterly boring, and Brandon was afraid that nothing would change that.<br />
Brandon was a pretty good looking guy. 5&#39;10&quot;, dirty blonde hair, pretty blue eyes and a cute face.  He always wore a polo to school, no matter how the weather was, and he tried to keep his hair nice, (except for days when he just couldn&#39;t give a shit). He always wore khakis, and he always wore plain tennis shoes. Every day, he would get up, get dressed, eat, go to school, come home, do homework, eat, go to bed, and repeat. His life was an endless cycle of boredom, and he would do anything to get out of it.<br />
Thankfully, he would have his wish, well, at least for one night, that is. Him and his friends planned a night at the mall that day, and once they were done shopping, they would all crash at Brandon&#39;s place, because from some godly miracle, his parents were out all weekend!<br />
So far, the night was going swimmingly. Brandon was having the time of his life, eating, shopping, and just enjoying time with his friends. At that moment, they were just walking to the exit, getting ready to go to Brandon&#39;s house.<br />
&quot;Holy shit, Jason really said that?&quot; Gina was bewildered, and so was everyone else.<br />
&quot;Yup. He told me. Right to my face.&quot; Amber gave out a little chuckle. &quot;He said, &quot;Amber, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever have the courage to say this again, so here goes... fuck you, bitch!&quot; I&#39;ve never been stood up to before, so for that Jason gets my respect. I guess he may be right, too. I can be a bit of a bitch sometimes when it comes to the men I date.&quot;<br />
&quot;Aw, don&#39;t say that, babe! You&#39;re not a bitch! You just get, confused sometimes. Y&#39;know, you forget who you&#39;re dating for a couple days, have sex with some other dude; he should apologize to you, don&#39;t apologize to him!&quot; Here comes Hank with yet another dumb excuse for why Amber is perfect.<br />
&quot;Oh, babe, no one is perfect, not even me! You don&#39;t do nothing bad to Jason now, ya hear?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am...&quot; Obviously, Hank wanted to do something bad to Jason. But doing it now would mean exile.<br />
&quot;Josh, hand me your keys. You look too tired to drive right now.&quot; Gina held out her small hand to Josh, but Josh wasn&#39;t having any of it.<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m not tiiired.... I can- I can drive..... Don&#39;t worry Gina you... you silly little goose...&quot; Josh was tired as fuck, everyone could tell.<br />
Gina sighed and gave Josh a little kiss on the forehead. Everyone stopped as Josh slumped onto the floor, knocked out and snoring. Everyone laughed, and Hank picked him up with his meaty hands, slumping his limp body over his shoulder. Gina got Josh&#39;s keys, and they all continued walking.<br />
&quot;Hank, can you pick me up too?&quot; Thomas asked Hank.<br />
&quot;Uhhh, I don&#39;t know... Amber?&quot;<br />
Amber giggled. &quot;Give the gay man what he want, Hank. It&#39;s not like he&#39;s going to molest you or anything.&quot;<br />
Hank sighed a little and picked the ecstatic Thomas up, letting him sit with his legs around his neck, and Hank had to adjust Josh&#39;s sleeping body to make up for it.<br />
&quot;So what do we want to do when we get back, guys?&quot; Thomas inquired.<br />
&quot;We should play a board game!&quot; Amber jumped up and down in place, her breasts jiggling along with her.<br />
&quot;I think we have some in our closet. That sounds good!&quot; Brandon was excited. This was one of the most fun nights he&#39;s had in a while. Finally, a break in the boredom!<br />
Before the group left the mall, Brandon stopped. His eyes were now fixated on a store that he hadn&#39;t seen before. &quot;The Croaking Toad?&quot;<br />
Everyone stopped and looked at the establishment. In contrast to the brightly lit interiors of all the other stores, this establishment was completely dark inside. But for some reason, the door was wide open.<br />
&quot;Oh, that place. It gives me the creeps, honestly. It just showed up here like a week ago. Kinda mysterious, if you ask me...&quot; Gina looked a little pale, and so did everyone else when they saw the building.<br />
But now Brandon. His face was flush with excitement and opportunity! This was his chance to make this day so much more exciting! He could feel his heart thumping in his chest...*thump*...*thump*...*thump*...<br />
&quot;You guys go ahead to the car, I just want to check this place out really qui-&quot;<br />
As soon as he said they could all go, everyone rushed out of the mall as if there was someone chasing them out. Oh well, this was going to be Brandon&#39;s big break! He just knew it!<br />
The inside of the store was dark and musty, but he could still see with the light from the hall of the mall. It was a small, dusty place, and the shelves weren&#39;t even stocked. He looked at the reception table and saw something. A box.<br />
He wasn&#39;t sure exactly what it was, but the box was calling to him. Beckoning him to come and take it. He knew that stealing was wrong, but for some reason, he knew he had to take it. And so, with all the courage he could muster, he took it. He took it and ran.<br />
He got inside the car with everyone else waiting for him inside and sat next to the still unconscious Josh. As Gina began driving to Brandon&#39;s house, Brandon looked down at the box and saw what exactly it was that he took.<br />
It was a board game. It didn&#39;t have a picture on the front of the box, just some text. It read... <br />
&quot;A Game of Change&quot;</p>
