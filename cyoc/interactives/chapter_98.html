<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was in awe over what had just happened to him, he thought this all just must be just a bad dream or something shit 
<br>
 like this just doesent happen in real life. Mark shook his head to try to clear it of the thuoghts and sites it was 
<br>
 receiving, but they didnt go away they remained. Mark looked over to his wife June who had wittnessed the whole thing and 
<br>
 was speachless, she didnt know what to think, poor Dustin was also in a state of shock over what had just occured his big 
<br>
 strong dad was now a whimp like he was now. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty just sat back and laughed he coundnt beleive how skinny Mark had become it was a dream come true for him, he had 
<br>
 always been afraid of Mark because he was such a big strong guy but not now, now he couldnt have weighed more than 110lbs 
<br>
 soaking wet. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well Mark what do you think of yourself now, ya aint quite the man ya use ta be are ya dude!!&quot; Ty said with a grin as 
<br>
 poor Mark reached down and pulled up his now over sized jeans, &quot;YOU DID THIS TO ME?&quot; Mark said as he stood there with his 
<br>
 jeans held up by his now bone thin arm, he was a real site sort of the refugee look that prisoners of war look like after 
<br>
 being held with no food for to long. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;WHY TY? WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME?&quot; Mark fired back in a very scared tone, &quot;PLEASE CHANGE ME BACK! ILL DO ANYTHING YOU 
<br>
 WANT PLEASE SON!!!&quot; Mark was now groviling like a scared kid and Ty found the whole thing very amussing. &quot;Take it easy 
<br>
 Mark. whats the matter you dont like being so damb skinny or somethin dude?&quot; Ty said as he walked over to the now skinny 
<br>
 Mark and shoved him, it was surprizingly easy he had no real defence against Ty now, sure he was taller than the shorter Ty 
<br>
 but Ty now out weighed him by 40lbs easy. The push sent Mark falling backwards and he had to let go of his jeans to steady 
<br>
 himself as he went backwards into the wall, Marks size 33-34s jeans slipped easly down his thin legs and fell in a mound 
<br>
 around his thin ankles even his tube socks were falling down off his thin calves, this time even his underwear took the 
<br>
 jorney south as he stumbled into the wall, poor Marks cock was now a pencil thin dick with aball sack that hung way to low 
<br>
 just behind his probably useless shaft. 
<br>

<br>
 Poor mark looked rediculuse now and very frightened, he was despratly trying to pull his underwear and jeans back up to 
<br>
 hide his now thin as hell dick. &quot;TY PLEASE!!&quot; Was all Mark could say as he steadyed himself against the kitchen wall 
<br>
 holding up the now heavy jeans his waist. &quot;Well Mark what do you think man? Just give me an answer and Ill make things 
<br>
 easyer for ya!&quot; Ty said as he again approched Mark as he stood there almost shaking in his workboots. &quot;What do you want me 
<br>
 to say son?&quot; Mark said as he brought his free arm up to his face in a defencive posture. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;PLEASE TY CHANGE YOUR FATHER BACK RIGHT NOW!!&quot; June finally piped in, &quot;Hes not my DAD! he didnt even remember my 
<br>
 birthday! AND NEITHER DID YOU YOU FAT COW!!&quot; Ty said as he concentrated on the preety looking thin June, that changed 
<br>
 almost emeideatly for her though and this time Ty managed to make her clothes change with her, she went from a small petite 
<br>
 woman to a fat cow of a lady in seconds. &quot;PLEASE TY I M SORRY ABOUT YOUR BIRTHDAY! REALLY I AM!!&quot; but it was to late for 
<br>
 apologys now, way to late. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustins whole perfect famliely had been altared in the span of just one weekend and he was begginning to freak out bad, 
<br>
 his once strong dad was a weakling and so was he and his mom was now a fat cow. &quot;Please Ty change us back I want things the 
<br>
 way they were please!&quot; Dustin said looking over to his now pathetic looking dad. &quot;NO DUSTIN! YOU ALL DESERVE THIS!&quot; Ty said 
<br>
 glaring at the once proud jock,&quot; your a whimp now and sos your dad so you might as well get use to it Dustin!&quot; Ty said as 
<br>
 he grabed Marks thin wrist and began to twist it, Mark reeled in pain and again let go of his to big jeans as he fell down 
<br>
 on one bony knee in agony as Ty twisted his now frail wrist almost to the breaking point. Ty let go of the skinny guys 
<br>
 wrist and looked down at him as he rubbed his sore wrist with tears of confusion pain and dispare pouring out 
<br>
 uncontrolably, this was all to weird for his confused mind to deal with. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;STOP CRYING MARK NOW!!!&quot; Ty said loudly. Mark rubbed his face of the tears and looked up to Ty, &quot;Stop felling sorry for 
<br>
 yourselves all of you!&quot; Ty said looking around the kitchen at his new foster famaly, &quot;Get up Mark, so I can get you changed 
<br>
 into something more your size!&quot; Ty concentrated on the standing Mark and Mark could feel his jeans getting tighter on him, 
<br>
 at first he thought that Ty was makeing him bigger, just like Dustin had thought when Ty made his clothes shrink to fit his 
<br>
 now skinny body. but he soon relized that the only change occuring now was to his clothes, and that he was still a tall 
<br>
 lanky skinny whimp, with jeans that now fit his now scawny body. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;There thats better isent it Mark at leist you wont have to hold them up any more. Mark looked down at his body his 
<br>
 clothes were tight fitting again alright but he was still a skinny guy. &quot;Ive changed the size of your jeans for you Mark 
<br>
 there now a size 28- 34 I had to modifie the waist to fit yours though you still to thin for a size 28, so I fixed the 
<br>
 waist line by takeing it in a bit!&quot; Ty said as Mark ran his hand around his waist line of his new jeans, sure enough and 
<br>
 much to the now skinny Marks dismay Ty had indeed altered the jeans to fit his skinny size 26 waist, but the parts of the 
<br>
 waist that had been sewn in an over laped fashion showed quite well to well for that matter and the jeans looked almost 
<br>
 comical on his now bone thin legs, the waist was tight but the legs of the jeans were loose and even looked baggy he had no 
<br>
 definition to his once fine ass at all the pants just hung strait down off of his ass, his tee shirt was now tight on him 
<br>
 almost to tight, Marks once proud pecs were just nipples over a bony set of ribs with a thin skin covering his ribs and from behind you could 
<br>
 make out his vertabre easyly. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;And now for the fun part Mark! You get to go to work like that!!&quot; Ty said laughing his ass off as he said it.Mark just 
<br>
 ran to the big mirror in the living room and staired at his pathetic looking reflection, tears of shame over the thought of 
<br>
 going to work like this poured down the grown mans face, he sniffled and stormed back into the room and glared at Ty who 
<br>
 was still laughing, &quot;IM NOT GOING TO WORK LIKE THIS TY!! CHANGE ME BACK RIGHT NOW!!&quot; Mark screamed, as he came back in 
<br>
 wipeing his face. &quot;You know Mark Ive tryed to be nice to you guys! I can make things alot worse for you if you want me to 
<br>
 Mark!&quot; Ty said almost calmly. &quot;So heres the deal you all have to stay the way you are for today, your going to the 
<br>
 constuction site Mark and your going to school today Dustin! and June youll be acting like the fat old house mom you are 
<br>
 now is that clear!! or would you all like to stay this way for the rest of lives!&quot; Ty said stearnly. The group went silent 
<br>
 as they all ran the horrible thought of staying like they were now through there aching heads.</p>
