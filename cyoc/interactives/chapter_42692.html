<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Colleen arrived outside Bobby's house the next day a little after lunch.  Going around the house she found him where he said he would be: tanning by the pool.  He lay in the sun clad only in Bermuda swim trunks and sun glasses.  Before she disturbed him Colleen noted the impeccable build of his shoulders and stomach muscles highlighted by the perfect tan, all the gift of Loki.  This first sight of her boyfriend since the prom was almost more than Colleen could stand.  She let a small animal sound of approval escape her lips which caused Bobby to jump.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gah!  Oh, it's you, Colleen,&quot; he said as he sat up.  &quot;You didn't call.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Colleen said sitting down in a chair opposite him.  &quot;How's it going?&quot;  She worked very hard to speak clearly past her lips which were very noticeably thick today.  After her revelation the day before she had done her best to remain silent for the rest of the day.  It had not worked out so well.  As hard as she tried to say nothing she would always seem to forget when caught of guard.  And despite of her hands seeming to find their way to her naughty bits without her consent she had refused to repeat her one act of pleasure.  Thus it was that Bobby found his girlfriend surprising him with a luscious, full pout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; he said rather lacking emotion.  &quot;I thought you were going to call yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I was, but then somethings came up and I just never got around to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby looked Colleen over.  She wore a pink, strappy tank-top that ended well above her navel.  Her firm abs were framed by the loose white shirt that covered her shoulders but hung open in the front allowing a good look at her cleavage.  A short skirt and flip-flops exposed the most leg he had ever seen on her.  Her crimson hair was curled and lay thickly around her face.  He could not avoid the thought that she was teasing him by looking so good.  She had done that before and it irritated him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't think that you would come over but I thought you might like to talk.  Especially after what happened.&quot;  Bobby tried to sound firm and caring but he did not know if it came across.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you could have called,&quot; she said a little hurt.  &quot;I was dealing with something.  I would have thought that you might have called to find out how I was doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How you were doing?  What about everyone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about them, Bobby?&quot; Colleen said getting a little irritated.  &quot;Don't you remember that I was singled out by Loki?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, first, but there were others after you, Colleen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My lips get bigger when I talk, Bobby,&quot; she said without seeming to notice he had said something.  &quot;Can you see how big they are right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he said trying to get her to stop talking.  Though now that she mentioned it her lips were huge.  They were glinting in the sun and watching her talk was almost hypnotic.  While she talked they bent and curled and pushed out in a way that was very sexy.  Bobby could only think of how soft they must be and he wanted to kiss her lips.  As he ignored her blathering he felt a stirring in his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were even bigger yesterday,&quot; she continued heedlessly.  &quot;The thing is that I didn't know how they were supposed to get smaller.  But then I found out accidentally but it is not so good since I need your help.  See I  nee oo haw yoo oo make wuv oo ee oo ...&quot;  She trailed off when she felt her lips swelling rapidly.  Some how she was babbling.  Then she noticed that Bobby was looking at her funny.  It was like he was looking through her.  &quot;Bobby?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, oh, yeah.  They're huge.&quot;  He squirmed a little adjusting his stiffy in a manner that her hoped she would not notice.  She had been very clear about her feelings on sex.  Which was why he hated when she dressed like that, and glossed her lips like that and played with her hair like that.  Colleen was the worst kind of cock-tease; an unconscious one.<br />
<br />
He was not listening to her, she thought as she grabbed a lock of hair.  She looked away as he adjusted himself.  He always did that and she tried to not look.  She did not want Bobby to know that she was looking, it might encourage him if he knew.  He was looking very sexy today and she needed that, but how was she going to get him to help her without going back on what she had been so careful to build.  Colleen started to form a plan.<br />
<br />
She leaned forward to brush a bug off her leg then remained leaning her elbow on her knee.  Looking up at Bobby she hoped the angle was correct to give him a full deep look at her breasts.  With her free hand she teased her lips with the lock of hair she had been playing with.  &quot;Bobby, I've been cursed ...&quot; she started.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, was I, Colleen, but you don't seem to care about that.&quot;  He interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;  She said, caught off guard.  &quot;What happened to you?&quot;</p>
