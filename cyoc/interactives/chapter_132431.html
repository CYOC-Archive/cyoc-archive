<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scarlette placed her hands on her hips, it was time to find those two troublemakers before they get Scarlette fired. Leaving her desk, she started with the cubicles close to her; it seemed that Missy had been busy with the remote. Scarlette saw a guy who had a stapler in the place of his crotch, sitting on a desk stapling a pile of booklets together, humming every time he pressed on his member.<br />
Wandering further on this floor, Scarlette made her way to the toilets to check for the others; frustrated mumbling coming inside. Upon pushing open the door Scarlette was met with a brand new sight: disembodied cocks littered the floor, they were absolutely everywhere! On the floors, stuck to cubicle doors, even a few in the sink. <br />
There was a guy picking them all off the floor, placing them into a plastic mail crate. He noticed Scarlette standing there and blushed a little while staring back down at the floor “Sorry, I-I-dont know why my privates are all over the place, im sorry, please dont report me to HR” He hastened his pace as Scarlette realised; all of them were identical, Missy had somehow copy and pasted them everywhere. Scarlette kneeled down and with slight hesitation, helped pick up the dismembered members for him. <br />
“Hey did you see how this happened?” Scarlette enquired. “Not really I was just using the urinal and this guy came in and was using the urinal next to me, he kept giggling as well which was weird, then I saw some flashes of light and my penis started appearing everywhere, then the guy laughed a bit and left”. Scarlette figured that the reality change kept the man from connecting the dots, like it was merely inconvenient that his dick suddenly appeared all over the room.<br />
“How long ago did this happen?” Scarlette asked, placing the last penis into the box. “I dont know, maybe seven minutes ago?”. <br />
Scarlette stood up and hurried out of the toilet, she was getting closer, but figured this &#39;guy&#39; who appeared was Missy, she must have absorbed someone to change her appearance. This was going to get more difficult.<br />
<br />
Scarlette stopped suddenly while passing her bosses office; he was carrying a laptop in his arms that seemed very familiar.....IT WAS SKYE! It looked like she had been flattened out and folded over but the big give away was the blue eyes watching Scarlette very carefully from the back of the laptop screen.<br />
Scarlette walked up to the office as casually as possible, peering around the open door to double check; Scarlette&#39;s boss placing the laptop on his desk and plugging a power cable into a port that look suspiciously like Skye&#39;s pussy, then opening the laptop lining up Skye&#39;s eyes with Scarlette.<br />
One of the eyes winked at Scarlette which gave her all the surety she needed, but the question was: how to get Skye away from her boss?<br />
Skye had a twinkle in her eyes, obviously she was enjoying her situation, the bosses typing causing her eyes to roll up, her cooling fan letting out a light moan. Scarlette thought for a moment on what she could do, then she had an idea. Walking over to his receptionist, Scarlette went to ask for a favour but she seemed distracted, constantly leaning down behind her desk. “Everything alright?” Scarlette asked “I just have something caught in one of my wheels, makes moving a bit uncomfortable” Scarlette walked around the side of the desk curiously and saw what the receptionist meant; she was an office chair from the waist down, well mostly anyway, her sizable rear and thighs had merged into a seat cushion and her calves stretching down from the center of the underside where they split into a more normal wheel base, just in the colour of her tanned skin.<br />
“Allow me” Scarlette said and got down onto all fours to check the wheel that the receptionist was reaching for. “Thanks, your a great help, it drives me nuts when people leave rubber bands or tape on the floor, it took me an extra hour to get home last night as two of my wheels did not work.”<br />
Scarlette got her fingers inside the wheel and pulled out what looked to be a lock of hair, holding it up to the receptionist who looked at it in disgust “UGH! That&#39;s gross, I&#39;ll have to wash my wheels when I get home”. And with that looked back at Scarlette “So anyways, was there anything I can do for you”. <br />
“Yeah there is, can you let the boss know there is a parcel for him downstairs that he has to sign for”.The receptionist looked back confused for a second before she caught on to the idea “Sure thing, give me a second and ill get him out”. She winked at Scarlette before picking up her phone and calling through to his desk. And a few minutes later, a visibly annoyed boss came walking out of his office and into the elevator, the man merged with the elevator door, his stainless steel figure splitting in half with a satisfied sigh.<br />
Scarlette hurried into the boss&#39; office and carefully pulled the power cord from Skye, causing Skyes eyes to open abruptly and look around, and upon seeing Scarlette gave a look of happiness.<br />
With Skye now under arm, Scarlette made her way discreetly back to her desk and opened up Skye.<br />
“Hey girl, having fun?” Skye hummed in a static-like voice. “You guys are causing all kinds of chaos here you know” Scarlette snapped. “relax, thanks to the remote, no one knows any different, to them this is just another day”. With that Skye started to open up search engine tabs for pornography, the sudden influx of loud moaning noise from the videos scaring Scarlette into closing the laptop. “Aww youre no fun” Skye said as she closed her eyes going into sleep mode.<br />
<br />
Scarlette slipped Skye into her bag and stood back up; now all she had to do is find Missy.</p>
