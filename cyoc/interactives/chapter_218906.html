<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff cried inside the dark sex dungeon, not knowing what was going to happen to him. He&#39;d never been this scared before, but at the same time, he&#39;d never been this turned on before either. However, since Drake had turned back the clock on not just Jeff&#39;s body, but also his mind, Jeff didn&#39;t understand these strange new feelings bubbling up through his soul. His dick had an unknown deep need that he didn&#39;t understand. He didn&#39;t have to pee, so what was this primal desire?<br />
<br />
He looked around for the millionth time at the shadows of the many bondage posts and silhuets of dildos lining the shelves. His butthole puckered up at the sight of them all. Each one so big. Some looked like they belonged to monsters. Oh god! The needy feeling was in his butt now. He squirmed on the mattress, rubbing his hairless legs together and running his fingers over his small body. How was he going to take care of this feeling? Why did he feel like he&#39;d shrunk? His own wondering hands brushed across his penis, and he was startled to feel not the limp little thing he was familiar with, but a stiff little thing. He was erect. He pulled his hands back from it as if it were a viper. Drake had removed even the most basic understanding of sex from his mind, so even an erection was new to the once 18 year old. Also, part of him felt humiliated that he was so smooth down there. Though he couldn&#39;t quite remember what it should be like.<br />
<br />
He shook his head to clear his thoughts. His brain was getting too fuzzy with unknown feelings. He stood up and tried to find something to distract himself with.<br />
<br />
Starting at one end, Jeff began counting his pases to measure his cage. He had to restart several times, as his mind frustratingly wondered back to the itch in his butt. His eyes kept wondering to the scary dildoes. No! Focus!<br />
<br />
16 steps from wall to wall. In his confused regressed mind and body, he still counted each step as a yard, but in reality it was closer to 16 feet. The room itself was 16 feet by 16 feet, but the cage cut through the center leaving him with 16x8 feet to move. But the dildos were on the other side! He didn&#39;t know why, but he desperately needed them.<br />
<br />
He tried squeezing through the bars again. They seemed to almost be large enough. He struggled against them again. This time not for freedom. Just for the toys. Pop! His body got through! Unfortunately, his head was stuck. Try as he might, he just couldn&#39;t get his head through the bars. It took even longer to get back.<br />
<br />
Defeated, Jeff curled back into his mattress like a puppy. Subconsciously, his hand slid between his smooth thighs and began to coress his butthole. Small moans began to escape his lips. It got even better when he stuck them inside. It almost stratched that itch, but he needed more. He needed something bigger.<br />
<br />
Oddly, as he played, his other hand went to his mouth, and he began sucking his thumb. It too felt way too small. He needed something big there too. Shame filled him as he played with himself, but his lust was too great to stop.<br />
<br />
Until a noise startled him. The sound of a latch. Not from the iron doors of the room, but from the wall where the hole was. Light pored into the dark room like a spotlight as the hatch opened on the far side. Then it dimmed as something blocked the light.<br />
<br />
With his night vision ruined, Jeff now saw nothing. He scrambled with heart in chest to investigate. He fumbled along the wall until he felt something warm and stiff at head hight. He knew instantly what this had to be. His kidnapper&#39;s cock. But it was huge! Anger and disgust and fear filled him. He wanted to run. He wanted to hurt the cock. He wanted to gag. He wanted to beg for mercy or scream curses at the man. But he did none of those things. Seemingly on instinct, Jeff found himself slurping down the huge cock. His hands wrapped around the base of the behemoth, while his jaw streached to engulf the cock head.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t understand why, but he NEEDED this thing inside him. Now! He needed to pleasure it. He took a deep breath, then forced the giant cock into his throat. It shouldn&#39;t have been possible, but he made it happen. Then in and out. Faster and faster. He soon learned to gasp in air between thrusts. All the while, his butt tingled with a similar need more and more, but the glory hole was too high up for that.<br />
<br />
Jeff worked that cock with all his might for what felt like forever. Sweat coated his body, but despite his exhation Jeff just couldn&#39;t bring himself to stop or even slow. He knew deep down in his sole that this was what he&#39;d been made for. This was the meaning of his existence. To serve cock. And this cock especially. <br />
<br />
At last, the cock began to throb. A torrent of cum filled Jeff&#39;s throat. And when he pulled back to breathe, he was drowned in thick white salty cum that filled his mouth, then sprayed onto his face and body. So much cum. Enough for twenty people at least. Jeff was drenched.</p>
