<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Later that night, as Dustin slept deeply in the room next door, Ty lay awake, thinking of all the ways he could use his powers. After a while, realizing that there was no way he was gonna get to sleep, he simply wished that he would always remain awake and energized unless he said otherwise. With that done, Ty turned his attention to a stack of magazines hidden under his bed that he somehow had managed to hide from Mark and June. Ty had known for some time that he was gay; in fact he had had a short, secret fling with one of the boys in his homeroom. But his main attraction was in those magazines, hot, muscle bound guys with incredible dicks. As he slowly began flipping through the graphic pages, Ty realized that he could have one of these men as his very own. At first he considered just wishing one of the men was here with him, but as he was about to do that he heard Dustin’s snores start coming through the wall. Why wish for one when you can make your own? &quot;I wish Dustin wouldn't see me unless I want him to.&quot; Ty wished as he walked into Dustin’s room with a malevolent grin on his face. Ty sat in a chair directly across from Dustin’s bed. &quot;I wish that Dustin would wake up and find himself to be extremely horny.&quot; Right on cue, Dustin began to stir and reached to turn on the light. &quot;Ugh, why did I have to wake up and 12:30 in the morning? The birds aren’t even up yet!&quot; Dustin lamented as the second part of Ty's wish kicked in. &quot;Oh it’s you is it?&quot; Dustin asked, noticing his hard cock bulging against the sheets. &quot;I guess I have to take care of this before I can sleep.&quot; As Dustin slowly started to stroke his penis, Ty wished that doing anything sexual to himself would not make Dustin cum. It would just make him hornier. &quot;Stubborn thing aren't you? I guess this calls for stronger stuff.&quot; Dustin commented as he moved from stroking to jacking his dick, first with one hand then with two. &quot;What's (*Uhh) going on (*Oh)?&quot; Dustin asked as his rapid jerking didn't seem to do anything except make him harder. Dustin let out a groan of pleasure as Ty made yet another wish. &quot;I wish&quot; Said Ty, who was still invisible to Dustin and was himself quite hard. &quot;That Dustin’s cock and balls would slowly grow larger at a rate that will only make Dustin hornier.&quot; Very, very slowly, Ty watched as Dustin’s dick began to slowly lengthen and his balls began to grow. Dustin however was too far lost in his world of lust to notice, even as his previously 8 inch hard on began to stretch and force his hands apart. Dustin began to howl with lust and continued to jack himself to no avail as his cock slowly passed a foot in length and almost 9 full inches wide. Ty was similarly lost in pleasure, watching the entire scene unfold. &quot;I better retreat back to my room so I can take care of my business.&quot; Ty thought, noting his own hard on that was about ready to burst. Wishing that he could still see everything that was going on inside Dustin’s room, Ty went back to his own room to orgasm in peace. Meanwhile Dustin’s snake had become a python, growing to over 18 inches and with balls the side of cantaloupes. Dustin had moved past moaning and was now shouting. &quot;Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck, oh god FUCK!&quot; he screamed as his pulsating shaft stretched ever higher growing past 2 full feet. It was at this time that Ty decided to help Dustin out a little and wished that he would grow enough muscle to support the immense orgasm he would get, eventually. This did little to help Dustin’s problem of needing to shoot as he suddenly began sprouting huge muscles all over his sweaty body, growing to the size of a Mr. Universe winner. With his newly muscled arm Dustin began jacking even faster, even though he could no longer reach both hands all the way around his shaft. Finally, after continually going for over 2 hours and growing a 39 inch hard on with a matching set of basketballs, Ty decided that enough was enough. The resulting orgasm was unlike anything Dustin had ever experienced, shooting straight through the sheetrock walls of the house and blasting his cum into the next state for over 20 minutes. Ty himself had shot three loads while watching the spectacle unfold and walked into what remained of Dustin’s room. &quot;Fuck Ty, that was fucking incredible.&quot; Said the cum soaked, muscle bound, freakishly dicked stud of Ty’s dreams. &quot;You weren't the only one who liked it.&quot; Dustin looked confused until he looked over and saw Ty's fully hard cock bobbing up and down. Dustin smiled as Ty climbed up onto of his new muscles and gave him a long drawn out kiss. &quot;Fuck me like I know you wanna, stud.&quot; &quot;Are you sure, I don't know if you could take all of me.&quot; Dustin grinned as he slowly ran a hand up his semi-hard shaft. &quot;Only one way to find out.&quot; And with that, Dusting flipped Ty onto the bed and began to mercilessly fuck him with his monster until Dustin passed out from exhaustion, his cock still firmly lodged up Ty's ass.</p>
