<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>[Note: this is an alternative branch to JLTF’s Dirty Jock branch]</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As David climbed back in the truck, I saw him do his best to ignore the way Trevor shuffled to hide his boner. &quot;That was hot.&quot; Trevor stated, causing David to turn red and grumble, but his friend pursued. &quot;So, that was Henry, like booty-call Henry ?&quot; Trevor continued, teasing his shy friend. David stared at him, at a loss of words, memories of telling his best friend about Henry. &quot;You forgot to mention he was a cop. Officer H. Humenyuk, that’s it ?&quot; David nodded as he started the car. Trevor became a bit more serious, a concerned look growing on his face. &quot;How old is he, though ? Like, you’re sure it’s alright ?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don’t worry, Trev, he’s not much older than us.&quot; David lied nervously, as he could tell he never asked the officer’s age to start with. This seemed enough to calm Trevor, who couldn’t see trough my master’s lies anymore.<br />
<br />
As we drove towards Mark’s house, I was a bit surprised to see that David was still nervous about the party. Even though he now had someone he had sex with on the regular along with already having sex with Mark, he still seemed to be cautious as he walked up to Mark&#39;s front door. Or it could have just been that the clothes he was wearing were actively too small for him now. The medium sized shirt that had been just about a half size too big for him was now starting to strain against his growing body.<br />
<br />
Muscles that he&#39;d never thought about were actually starting to develop and show some growth. Biceps had rounded out ever so slightly. Pecs were starting to push out his front. Abs were growing in and even pressing up against the fabric. It almost felt like David had forgotten about that wish as he pulled at the collar of his shirt that was tightening around his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon!&quot; Trevor shouted as he jumped out of the truck and ran to the house. It was a fairly large two story house in the suburbs with a perfectly cut lawn and a large wooden privacy fence that went around the backyard. Beer cans and red solo cups were littered around the front yard that were clearly meant to be cleaned up at a different time. <br />
<br />
David was still a bit slow to get out of his truck. &quot;I wish I fit in with the guys here,&quot; he muttered under his breath.<br />
<br />
I chuckled, as David didn&#39;t realize that I was still listening.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I fit MY DICK WITHIN the guys here,&quot; David said. His breathing slowed a bit as he realized what he just wished for. Dozens of new sexual experiences with the guys at the party started to fill his mind. He couldn&#39;t believe that any of the men he could vividly remember having sex with would have even talk to him, let alone let him top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, Is something the matter?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no,&quot; he stammered a bit as he slowly headed to the front door. &quot;It&#39;s just I&#39;m trying to get used to that last wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course master. To think you were so sexually promiscuous,&quot; I implied, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have guessed.&quot;<br />
<br />
David&#39;s face burned red. &quot;Uh-huh,&quot; he nodded. Of course, he wasn&#39;t so a small sense of confusion lingered as he knew those were the words that had come out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
However, as he opened the door, he hadn&#39;t realized that even just Trevor&#39;s presence was enough to stop the party. &quot;WHO INVITED THE DWEEB?&quot; Ashley shouted. Several of the jocks were gathering around Trevor. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I-I did,&quot; David answered. Instantly Jacob, Devon and Marquis stopped in their tracks. &quot;Sorry. I thought it&#39;d be okay... Since Mark invited me...&quot;<br />
<br />
The anger instantly dissipated out of the men as the looked over at David. Sudden memories of why the less popular guy was invited was fresh in their mind. &quot;Ehh... It&#39;s fine,&quot; Jacob was the first to speak up. The kicker might have been one of the lowest ranking in terms of authority, but he also didn&#39;t want any more trouble than he needed. His tall lithe body was built more for soccer, but with that being in the spring Coach Sinclair was happy to use his powerful legs to punt the ball all the way down the field or go for a field goal when they needed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s fine,&quot; echoed Devon. The big linebacker wasn&#39;t exactly known for trying to cause too much of a stir if he didn&#39;t have to. His broad shoulders and thick burly frame along with the fact that he stood a head taller than nearly everyone else gave him a real presence when he entered a room. That size tended to be all the reason someone needed to not go against him. <br />
<br />
Marquis took Ashley under his muscular arm and led her into the kitchen. &quot;It&#39;s alright babe. He won&#39;t bother us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ahsley rolled her eyes as she put more of her weight onto her running back boyfriend. &quot;Fine,&quot; she said, but not before flicking Trevor off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn...&quot; Trevor muttered. His mood dropped a bit as the party went back to its usual self. An awkward unwanted air hung around him as he stood near the staircase. It hung onto him until he saw David. &quot;Your genie!&quot;<br />
<br />
David panicked as Trevor nearly jumped him. &quot;W-what?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your genie!&quot; he repeated. &quot;You can wish me to be more popular!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are... Are you sure?&quot; David asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man! Wish that I was a jock!&quot; Trevor said. &quot;Then I can be just like them!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Okay?&quot; David turned to me. &quot;I wish that Trevor was popular at school.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled. The idea of maintaining Trevor’s jock suggestion crossed my mind, but turning him in an underwear might break my master’s sensitive mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that Trevor was A popular, HUNG SWIMMER at school.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Woah!” said Trevor  in surprise, but cut his exclamation short as his body changed from his formerly dweeb look to an athletic, still lean, physique. His wider shoulders made his head appear a bit smaller. Trevor&#39;s hand grazed the front of his pants, and David followed the movement to see the obvious outline visible on his friend’s jeans. “Uh, thanks mate. That was more than I expected.” David adjusted his square glasses. “You’re welcome. I guess.”<br />
<br />
The two young men now had no issue mingling in with the other party-goers. Trevor was greated warmly by the other jocks, and David even a bit more heartily. Jay-Pee, one of the swimmers and now Trevor’s teammate even went for a kiss. The shocked expression on my master’s face was priceless, as he started sweating in his clung-to-the-skin clothes. Moments later, the two friends regrouped. Trevor seemed embarassed.<br />
<br />
“Everyone’s ogling at me and my dick. I don’t mind the girls, or you, but the other guys…” <br />
“It’s still flattering, isn’t it?”<br />
“You’re right, it’s a hell of a compliment if you’re trophy boys consider me that attractive.”<br />
<br />
David looked stunned, and as I approached to reiterate that Trevor now believed everything he said, he nodded at me in understanding. Good master, he was progressing. But I was getting bored. Thankfully, the host made an appearance at that time. My master got flushed as the wrestler came over to give him a big -and long- hug. It was more of a squeeze, but the bigger David could easily take it now. He nervously tapped Mark’s back, not knowing how to react. Mark then greeted Trevor with a jock’s handshake and walked over to a group of girls that just happened at the door.<br />
<br />
As David looked at Mark walking away, his eyes on the muscular ass contained within a pair of shorts, he whispered to himself. “Gee, I wouldn’t half-mind fucking him... again.” The last word still didn’t seem convinced. Stubborn guy! A moment later, Mark was back “Davie, there’s something I’d like to show you upstairs. You mind giving us a moment, Trev’?” Trevor shook his elbows and flashed a knowing smile at David, before heading to the patio. He’d heard splashing that indicated a pool in the backyard.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I followed my master to Mark’s room. The wrestler hurriedly closed the door behind them and dropped his shorts to the floor, showing off a distastefully striped blue and yellow jockstrap. Mark pulled my master to his bed and rushed to undo his jeans. David was looking at me in shock.<br />
“I believe you wished to have sex with Mark whenever you wanted. Didn’t you just mutter moments ago that you’d like to have intercourse with him?”<br />
<br />
“Uh… Yes…” David’s voice was flat with realization. Mark looked at him, puzzled, and hurried him to help with his pants. “Why do you pick such tight clothes, Davie? It’s a pain!” With a few groans and tears of the fabric, they managed to unzip the jeans and toss them away, shortly followed by David’s plain boxer briefs. Mark’s hands then went for his shirt. Even after unbuttoning it, the arms seemed stuck and an inevitable rip was heard. Mark tossed the cloth on the pile and quickly promised to lend something his size to David, as he bucked over on his bed, still wearing his own underwear and t-shirt. Laying there, he held his legs up and butt open. <br />
<br />
“Well, Davie? Fuck me!”<br />
David’s eyes jumped from his sexual partner to me, his erect cock a clear indication of his ongoing desire. “I can look away, master”, I offered, even though he didn’t deem it necessary on the side of the highway. Mark rocked himself forward to grab David by the thighs, and pulled him closer.<br />
“I’ve been waiting for it since the library, mate!”</p>
