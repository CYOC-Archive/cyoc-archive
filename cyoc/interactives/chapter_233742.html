<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick Roy was a red-haired theater guy who had a lot of charisma, a sardonic personality, and seemingly endless energy, emotion, and expression. Add in that he kept himself in shape, had a bit of scruff on his chin and had a little longer hair than your average guy; and he was the ideal mold of the stereotypical straight theater guy stuffed into one male body. All that was missing from his stereotypical punch card was having experimented sexually with half the overwhelmingly female dominated cast of theater-oriented girls. This wasn&#39;t from a lack of interest in his part--to the contrary, Nick was probably overeager given his frustrations. The problem was that in his local high school the theater crowd was made up of lesbians who he was the platonic buddy of, bisexual gals who were already spoken for so he purposely didn&#39;t think of them that way, and then the sweeter than poisoned honey choir girls who showed up every time they did a musical, but who otherwise were dating their jock boyfriend that they kept in reserve to fill out whatever background role was needed for the musical they were doing. So needless to say, in the &quot;I&#39;ve had my choice of girls in the theater department&quot;, Nick Roy was a solid zero when it came to living up to that end of the stereotyped straight theater guy.<br />
<br />
And he had been excited when he had learned he was going to be rooming with not just one, but two girls on this resort Senior trip. At long last he&#39;d finally get to have a chance with someone, even if they were out of his usual social sphere. And then he&#39;d gotten here and learned that Alice and Tamara, two of his lesbian buddies from the theater department, had requested sharing a room with him because they didn&#39;t want him to be all alone with strangers for the trip.<br />
<br />
To say that Nick was practicing his acting technique in holding back his reaction to learning all that upon arriving at the room, and that he&#39;d have to help as an impromptu therapist for Alice and Tamara who were also in the middle of an argument, was just the tip of the iceberg. He should be nominated for a fucking Tony award right now, given how nonchalant he was playing this off--and how he wasn&#39;t throwing something across the room. It&#39;s not that he didn&#39;t like Alice and Tamara, it&#39;s not that he was sex crazed, but Nick was convinced that outside of just losing his virginity, he would be the only guy in High School not to have had another relationship that got to that serious a level.<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s when Pauline came knocking at the door. Pauline was one of those girls from one of the other Middle Schools that fed their High School he&#39;d just never had classes with and had never interacted with much. He knew her name, but beyond that and that he vaguely recalled a friendship with a girl named Madison, not much else about her. But here she was, standing in the doorway to the apartment where Alice and Tamara were now engaging in makeup making out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I hope I wasn&#39;t disturbing anything,&quot; said Pauline oftly politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, nothing... it&#39;s just Alice and Tamara just ended a fight and that usually leads to... well the Make squared,&quot; said Nick as he promptly stepped out into the hall to join Pauline and close the door behind him to preserve Alice and Tamara&#39;s privacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make squared?&quot; asked Pauline curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Makeup Makeout, or a Make squared,&quot; explained Nick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... clever!&quot; said Pauline with a brief smile and a small laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, uhh... what&#39;s up?&quot; asked Nick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know we don&#39;t know each other too well, but I was wondering, with you being single, if you were up to having a little makeout session of our own,&quot; said Pauline boldly. That caught Nick completely off guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... s-sure, though I gotta ask, why me and why now?&quot; asked Nick<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t seen you in all those plays the Drama Club puts on... I especially liked it when you were in Oklahoma!&quot; said Pauline with an obviously coy look. Nick remembered Oklahoma! from last year. The student senior director had been Barry, a gay theater guy who had asked him to leave the shirt under the rather tight overalls he wore buttoned open. He&#39;d said it helped with the wild crazed look of the character, but Nick had always suspected that Barry had been wanting a good look at Nick&#39;s developing body--that had been the product of Nick hitting the gym more regularly to try and capture the look of a farm hand who regularly performs manual labor. It wasn&#39;t that Nick was ashamed to show off his gains, and it had garnered a few feminine whoops and catcalls from the audience when he would first appear on stage before his villain status was revealed with his song, but he&#39;d always had a nagging feeling that Barry had wanted an excuse to stare at Nick&#39;s chest. It seemed Nick had been collecting an interest from that role that hadn&#39;t been cashed in before now.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why now?&quot; asked Nick<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there hadn&#39;t really been any opportunity to talk to you at school before. And right now Maddie and our teacher are out seeing what the rest of the hotel has to offer, so I figured, before we graduate, why not give it a go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, this is just a one time fuck?&quot; asked Nick, feeling almost a little insulted while at the same time feeling his groin begin to tingle. No, fuck, he had his pride to maintain. He wasn&#39;t just some cheap bastard who could be won over by the offer for a causal fuck, right? Right? The growing erection in his pants was saying otherwise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t have to be just once and done. After all, we have the rest of the trip to have fun if we want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if your teacher comes back while we&#39;re fucking?&quot; asked Nick, trying to find some excuse to keep himself from giving in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, Maddie and I made sure he won&#39;t,&quot; said Pauline with a smirk. A pounding against the door which suggested Alice and Tamara were now pressed up against the door--a supposition only supported by the heavy moaning that was only barely muffled by the closed door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your place, then?&quot; asked Nick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; said Pauline with a Cheshire Cat grin.<br />
<br />
Nick was barely in Pauline&#39;s room when she&#39;d turned to him and pulled him into a kiss. At first he&#39;d been caught off guard, but pretty quickly he did what he&#39;d learned in Improv and adapted to his circumstances. Clothes went flying from both of their bodies as they stumbled their way to the bedroom that Pauline had chosen for herself and soon Nick found himself inside of Pauline, the two humping each other in a near perfect rhythm together until at long last their smashing together caused Nick to erupt at long last into Pauline. After he&#39;d felt himself stop, he pulled out and rolled over on the bed and closed his eyes a bit as he came down from his high, before suddenly realizing he&#39;d forgotten to wear a rubber.<br />
<br />
Shit.<br />
<br />
Nick opened his eyes wide and sat up only to see that Pauline had gotten up from the bed since he&#39;d laid down and she was fiddling with something in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, Pauline, I&#39;m sorry I forgot to get a rubber out of my wallet,&quot; said Nick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you did exactly what I wanted,&quot; said Pauline assuredly. Nick relaxed a bit, feeling a little drowsy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean what you wanted?&quot; asked Nick, through his drowsy haze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just go to sleep, Nicky, and don&#39;t worry about it at all,&quot; said Pauline as she put the now empty test tube back in its holder and then came over to give Nick a quick kiss before he fell asleep, exhausted from the experience.<br />
<br />
Madison then came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you use the test tube in time?&quot; asked Madison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh... I did. Let&#39;s let Nick sleep for now, he kinda deserves it--he wasn&#39;t half bad,&quot; said Pauline as she ushered Madison out of the room and closed the door behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay now what do I do?&quot; asked Pauline.<br />
<br />
&quot;For this, we need you in front of a mirror,&quot; said Madison, grabbing Pauline&#39;s hand and dragging her naked friend in front of a full length mirror in the bathroom. The cold tile beneath her feet causing her to visibly shiver as she looked at her reflection.<br />
<br />
&quot;This mirror is a tool to help you age or regress at your choosing--like the AR Patch, only you can use it both ways. All you have to do is think about your babies getting older inside of you, and the mirror will change your reflection, which will then reflect back onto you and do the rest of the work changing you,&quot; said Madison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm... okay, but we don&#39;t know if Mr. Cameron&#39;s split into twins or not,&quot; said Pauline.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we won&#39;t until you start thinking of him being a little older, so start imagining it,&quot; urged Madison before stepping out of the sight line of the mirror.<br />
<br />
Pauline stared at her naked body in the mirror and then thought of what her body had felt like before her belly had gone completely flat, and suddenly she saw her belly in the mirror grow a tiny bit--only visibly so because of her being naked, and then Pauline felt her own belly push out slightly. Instinctively she knew she was several weeks along and far enough along to know she was pregnant, but not much more, and that her belly appeared to be a bit big for that far along with just one kid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep going,&quot; urged Madison.<br />
<br />
Pauline imagined a belly big enough to cause her clothes to stop fitting, and she saw the swell and felt it a second later. She now knew she was two months along and her belly was definitely bigger than it had been when Mr. Cameron had shrunk to that size before. She wasn&#39;t out of the first trimester and already her clothes wouldn&#39;t fit her. That was a good sign for having twins! Pauline wanted to know for sure though, so she imagined holding an ultrasound in her hand that would answer the question, and so Pauline&#39;s belly swelled even larger, looking like she might be five or six or so months along with one baby, but in her hand she had her four month ultrasound which showed...<br />
<br />
&quot;Three babies?&quot; exclaimed Madison who&#39;d come over the moment the ultrasound had appeared in Pauline&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to know that Nick was in that 3% chance range,&quot; said Pauline.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remind me to thank him when he wakes up,&quot; said Madison.<br />
<br />
Pauline eager to get being pregnant over with, imagined being far enough along that her water was breaking. And so her reflection&#39;s belly grew even bigger than it had when she&#39;d first stretched out to accept Mr. Cameron into her. Madison helped stead her as her water broke and ran down her legs to the floor.<br />
<br />
Madison then helped Pauline over to the bathtub, which had been pre-filled with hot water that had cooled off to just being warm now as Pauline lowered herself into the tub and began her labor pains. Experiencing labor, fully experiencing it, was something that Pauline was now causing herself to regret going along with this scheme in the first place. No senior year hunk was worth this much pain that she felt she was splitting in two as she pushed.<br />
<br />
First, one baby came out, along with his placenta not too long thereafter into the water before Madison fished him out of the water, smacked his bottom to have him breathe on his own for the first time, cut the cord, and named him Nathaniel. The second baby thankfully came out a bit more easily, and soon Nathaniel&#39;s new twin brother Jesse as Pauline named him was wailing right along with Nathaniel. After Nathaniel and Jesse, Matthew slid right out of Pauline rather easily. All three babies were identical--not just in appearance, but it looked like someone had just hit &quot;Ctrl+C&quot;.<br />
<br />
After cleaning up, and sending the bloody birthing water down the drain, Pauline was taking turns nursing her triplets.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I&#39;ve been thinking--this is perfect. We can have one of the triplets grow back up into old Mr. Cameron, and he can become the &quot;Dad&quot; of our twin boyfriends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pauline was silent at the suggestion that one of her babies was perhaps destined to age rapidly back into a crotchety old man soon, when suddenly she had an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Maddie, now that Mr. Cameron is three different people, he&#39;s more likely to develop into three different ways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you saying?&quot; asked Madison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not only don&#39;t we know how different each triplet will be as they grow up but, we can mold them into something other than a crotchety bitter old man--by teaching them to be different from what he was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds kinda like we&#39;d be grooming him,&quot; said Madison with a certain look that Pauline took to be her second guessing her own plans.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not saying that at all. These triplets are going to be different no matter what we choose to do, because Mr. Cameron wasn&#39;t part of a triplet before. Now that he&#39;s split three ways who knows what that alone would change in his personality--all I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s just make sure that if one of him is destined to be &quot;Dad&quot; to his brothers, let&#39;s make it so Dad isn&#39;t so much of a prick is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pauline finished burping Nathaniel and placed the full baby next to his brothers in the extra large crib that Mr. Cameron&#39;s bed had transformed into after they&#39;d come out of the bathroom. &quot;Okay, so now that each of them are fed, let&#39;s get to know the triplets and lay the groundwork for a less crabby teacher.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do we do that?&quot; asked Madison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see what they&#39;re like as toddlers,&quot; said Pauline.<br />
<br />
Madison took out the ray gun which had been among the basket of Patches and other Aging and Regression related items, set the range for wide, clothes, memory, and reality to alter, and for the target age of 2 years old before aiming the gun at the crib of three sleepy babies. The babies grew--stretching out while maintaining their cute chubby baby fat. Their dark brown hair growing out, and diapers appearing on all three, only to be covered up by footed pajamas. Matthew wore a yellow one with Winnie the Pooh embroidered on it with his name embroidered below, Nathaniel a grey one with Eeyore and his name embroidered on it, and Jesse an orange one with Tigger and his name embroidered on it. Pacifiers immediately appeared in their mouths--each having a different color to match their pajamas. A stuffed animal of each character appeared next to each toddler, and the crib transformed into a play pen with a large mat for them to sleep on, as well as a few blocks, cars, and balls to play with as well.<br />
<br />
All three toddlers opened their eyes and blinked and woke up as if they&#39;d been napping already. Jesse immediately laughed upon seeing Pauline, and stood up and stretched out his arms towards Pauline and bounced up and down--demanding to be picked up, which Pauline obliged, and Jesse cooed in response. Matthew meanwhile had taken an interest in the blocks near him, while Nathaniel stared on as Jesse was picked up and then spat out his pacifier and began to cry. Madison bent down and picked Nathaniel up  and hushed him as she held him close to her, which seemed to soothe Nathaniel a bit<br />
<br />
&quot;Dow!&quot; declared Jesse as he squirmed after a few minutes of just being held by Pauline. In order to keep from dropping the wiggly toddler, Pauline obliged by setting him down on his diapered butt, which he didn&#39;t stay sitting on for too long before he&#39;d pushed himself up and began to toddle about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesse&#39;s a demanding rambunctious little guy,&quot; said Pauline as she watched Jesse run around the room exploring every nook and cranny he could fit himself into.<br />
<br />
Nathaniel meanwhile had grown to liking being held by Madison that he was positively clinging to her neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nathaniel&#39;s a loud, jealous little guy who just wants to be the center of attention,&quot; said Madison as she heard Nathaniel begin to give a raspy baby snore on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
Both girls turned to Matthew who had by now built his tower of blocks into a set of steps that he was using to climb over the play pen, which he did easily before toddling over to Pauline and she responded by picking him up for a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Matty&#39;s quiet, clever, sensitive, and intelligent little boy,&quot; said Pauline.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s always the quiet ones you gotta watch out for,&quot; quipped Madison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I had thought that maybe Mr. Cameron&#39;s personality might get split three different ways...&quot; said Pauline.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it did,&quot; said Madison.<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; asked Pauline.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, think about it. Nathaniel&#39;s just like he was when he was our old teacher, Mr. Cameron, Jesse--&quot; <br />
<br />
A crash was heard from Madison&#39;s bedroom, that both Pauline and Madison ignored for a moment, dreading checking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesse&#39;s clearly what he was like as a teenager and young adult. And Matthew&#39;s the sweet little boy who was super polite to us as he regressed,&quot; said Madison.<br />
<br />
Pauline hefted Matthew onto her side and stood up while holding him--the action feeling natural as though she&#39;d been doing it for years.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a theory, but it&#39;s definitely stretching it a bit with Jesse. I don&#39;t remember &quot;Nathan&quot; our classmate knocking over a suitcase,&quot; said Pauline as she checked into Madison&#39;s room to find that Madison&#39;s open suitcase was on the floor and Jesse was happily digging through it with a curiosity unmatched.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Jesse, no! Don&#39;t do that!&quot; shouted Madison as she put Nathaniel down on her bed, seemingly disturbing the contented Nathaniel as Madison bent over to clean up the mess that Jesse had been making.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think if one of these little guys gets to be Dad, we need to check how they are as older brothers to the other two,&quot; suggested Pauline<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a plan, we could always use backup,&quot; agreed Madison.<br />
<br />
Pauline smiled and went over to pick up the ray gun Madison had put down. Time for the triplets to enter childhood, and for one of them to be the two years older older brother to the other two as twins.</p>
