<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex felt sick to his stomach. How the hell could David do that to him?! But he also felt furious with <br />
himself: why did he allow himself to be tempted by what David had become? He’d gone from a skinny waif to a <br />
muscleman in three weeks, did he not think there’d be some kind of catch for that? Fuck, Alex thought, over <br />
and over again, as he got home and tried to forget about the whole evening. He opened a bottle of scotch – he <br />
was determined to forget about this whole ordeal, one way or another, so he poured himself a large glass and <br />
drained the whole thing. It burned on its way down and Alex gasped, but he quickly felt the scotch’s soothing <br />
warmness flooding him.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t bring himself to do anything except drink and think about what this change would mean. David had <br />
said he’d grow into the kind of guy he had become, but he must have been over 300lbs! Alex liked his current <br />
size, he felt 190 suited him and for years he’d just maintained this weight. But if he was going to grow and <br />
it was out of his control...fuck, he’d be a freak! He also couldn’t help thinking about David’s foot-long <br />
cock. That thing was a monster, he couldn’t possibly have been that big before. But Alex smiled as he thought <br />
about the prospect of a bigger dick because he wasn’t exactly well hung at the moment, only about 5 inches. If <br />
he could change one thing about himself it’d be that, so at least there was some silver lining to this whole <br />
mess.<br />
<br />
By this point, Alex had got through a quarter of the bottle and things were starting to get a little bit <br />
blurry. He had the presence of mind to refuse himself another drink, instead stumbling into his room to <br />
collapse fully-clothed on the bed. He immediately passed out, and stayed in exactly the same position until <br />
about ten the next day. He opened his eyes, immediately realising his head was pounding, and murmured to <br />
himself, “Thank fuck it’s Saturday,” before getting up to make some coffee.<br />
<br />
While the kettle was boiling Alex checked his phone and saw he had a text from David. David.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck,” Alex buried his head in his hands as he remembered what was going to happen to him – it took a lot <br />
of deep breaths not to throw up there and then. But he steeled himself, and read the text:<br />
<br />
‘so sorry about last nite, but look at www.newman.biz – text bck when read plz, david’<br />
<br />
Alex made his cup of coffee and held it close to his head. Why should he look at whatever David had sent? It <br />
couldn’t possibly be important...could it?<br />
<br />
“Fuck,” Alex said as his curiosity got the better of him and he fired up his computer. When he keyed in the <br />
web address he saw the same website David had seen:<br />
<br />
‘To a man in need,<br />
<br />
By now you’re experiencing the first signs of the change: your dick should have grown about an inch <br />
overnight-‘<br />
<br />
“Holy shit, what?” Alex was shocked. How could it possibly have worked that quickly? He fetched a ruler and <br />
got himself hard, placed it against his base and read the length:<br />
<br />
Six inches.<br />
<br />
“Hot damn, I guess it does work after all,” said Alex in surprise. When he’d got over the fact that his cock <br />
had grown another inch in one night, he carried on reading:<br />
<br />
‘Your dick should have grown about an inch overnight, and there’s more to come! There are more changes in <br />
store over the next few weeks, but most are variable: some will get more muscular, some fatter, some taller, <br />
some shorter, some hairier, some smoother, some will change race, and there’s probably a load of other <br />
possibilities. I haven’t had someone go through the change in the same way as someone else yet. I probably <br />
never will.<br />
<br />
But there’re two things you WILL experience, and I’m sorry, but they’re part and parcel of the whole. First, <br />
if you’re not already, you’re going to turn gay. You’ll probably fight it at first, but it’s inevitable. It <br />
might be the first change, it might be the last, but it will come.<br />
<br />
Also, once your change is over, you’ll know because you’ll feel the need to change other men into one of us. <br />
The urge to do this will be stronger than eating or drinking, it’ll be a primal urge, and like other primal <br />
urges you’ll know instinctively how to do it. One change will keep you going for about a month, but after that <br />
you’ll need to change someone else.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but enjoy your new life,<br />

<br />
Alex reread the last paragraph about changing others. He couldn’t forgive David, at least not yet, but it <br />
didn’t sound like he had a choice, just like he’d said. Then he had another thought: he was still furious with <br />
David for making him change, but he was the only person he knew who could help him through the change. He <br />
didn’t like it but Alex knew he had to talk to David again, at least so he’d know what to expect of these next <br />
few weeks. Even if no two guys had exactly the same changes David would probably know something to help, so <br />
Alex got showered and dressed and went over to David’s place.<br />
As David opened the door for him Alex could see relief on his face.<br />
<br />
“I thought you hated me,” he said as he closed the door behind Alex.<br />
<br />
“I kinda do at the moment. But I read your website, and I need to know what’s coming over the next few weeks. <br />
Any help would be good, and you’re the only person I know who’s experienced this freaky shit already.”<br />
<br />
David nodded and just stood there, unsure of what to do, so Alex sighed and asked,<br />
<br />
“Were the changes only physical then?” David looked at him blankly so he elaborated, “Was it just your body?”<br />
<br />
“It was at first I guess, but about a week and a half after I got changed I couldn’t concentrate. Work got <br />
real hard-“<br />
<br />
“Work got hard?! You were a waiter, that’s not difficult shit!”<br />
<br />
“I just couldn’t remember stuff. And when I had to concentrate, it made my head hurt so I just...didn’t. It <br />
was easier to flex and workout so I did that instead.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck...is that going to happen to me?”<br />
<br />
“I guess not, Tony says I’m the only guy who’s got dumber, doesn’t sound like it happens much.”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm. Anything else?”<br />
<br />
“Um...I don’t like red wine any more. I like beer now...don’t like puzzles any more...and I fucking love the <br />
gym,” David said as he lifted his top, “Look at these abs, I’m still so happy I got abs!”<br />
<br />
“Terrific,” Alex said. This wasn’t as useful as he’d wanted it to be. David sure had got dumber, he just <br />
wasn’t much use now, “What about the guy who changed you? Can I talk to him?”<br />
<br />
“Tony? Sure, we’ll go to the Orange Bar tonight, we always go there.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, let me know when and I’ll see you both there,” Alex replied, and left to go back home. But he ended <br />
up driving around aimlessly for a while, thinking about how soon it would be until he stopped being himself <br />
and started being someone else. Before he realised it, he’d driven to the flat of Lana, his most recent...well <br />
she wasn’t his girlfriend...lover? Sounded too romantic, definitely not what either of them wanted. <br />
‘Whatever,’ concluded Alex as he struggled to think of a term for their relationship (fuck-buddy was about as <br />
close as he got). Fuck-buddy was about right as they didn’t do much apart from that whenever they got <br />
together: it occurred to Alex that at one on a Saturday afternoon he had no idea whether or not she’d be at <br />
work. But he needed to see her all the same – for all he knew this could be his last chance to enjoy sex with <br />
a woman and he’d damn well take it with Lana if he could. He rang the doorbell.<br />
<br />
“Yeah?” the voice came through the intercom.<br />
<br />
“Lana, it’s Alex. Is this a bad time?”<br />
<br />
There was silence before the door opened to reveal Lana in a tight green t-shirt and denim hot pants. Her red <br />
hair was worn up in a rough bun, to give the impression she’d just thrown it into that position. She wore <br />
foundation and a hint of blush but her make-up wasn’t too heavy – just enough to show off her flawless <br />
features. She smiled and bit her lip as Alex’s gaze fell to her t-shirt, seeing the nipples from her ample <br />
tits standing through the cloth.<br />
<br />
Lana took Alex by the hand and led him inside, closing the door behind them, and immediately started kissing <br />
him intensely. Alex reciprocated while she said in between kisses, “Fuck I’m so glad you showed up.”<br />
<br />
Before Alex really knew it they were naked, a whirlwind of clothes left strewn around the apartment. He loved <br />
the feel of her tits against his chest, and as they embraced he slipped on a condom and thrust his hard dick <br />
into her tight pussy, fucking her hard and fast. Before very long Lana started shivering and pushing Alex <br />
away, moaning louder and louder, until finally Alex came, flooding her with his seed.<br />
<br />
“Fuck that was good, we should do this again sometime,” Lana joked with a wink. That was their closing line <br />
before one of them left, and it had been for the whole month since they’d first hooked up. More than anything <br />
did Alex want to stay – if he could then he felt that maybe that’d stop the rest of the change occurring. But <br />
he knew he couldn’t, so he played the part he always played: dutifully putting on his clothes and leaving. <br />
‘Well,’ he thought, ‘If that is the last time I have straight sex, at least it was a good one!’. He drove home <br />
and tried to take his mind of things by doing some work: a report that he needed to finish for Monday morning. <br />
Thankfully because it was so in-depth when he next checked the time it was after 7. David had sent him a text <br />
saying to get to the Orange Bar for 9 so Alex had a long shower, had some dinner, dressed up, and left to meet <br />
David and Tony.<br />
<br />
On arriving he saw David in a booth with another guy, so he went over to join them. ‘Fuck they’re both <br />
monsters,’ Alex thought as he saw the size of them next to each other. These booths should have seated about <br />
six people: David and Tony took up most of the room themselves. When he got close David rose to meet Alex, and <br />
introduced him to Tony, the muscled, dark-haired man next to him.<br />
<br />
“So,” Tony started as Alex sat down, “David tells me he’s changed you. I want you to know I’ve given him a <br />
talking to about that: I was homeless when I was changed and where possible we don’t change anyone we know or <br />
who has any way they could be adversely affected by the experience, like having to change jobs or such. So on <br />
behalf of David, and myself for not being there to help him with his first changing, I’m sorry. How are you <br />
doing though?”<br />
<br />
Alex looked up from his drink, staring Tony right in the eyes and said, “Do you know what Tony? I’m fucked <br />
off. I’m fucked off that one of my best friends has changed from a great guy into this dumb gay meathead. I’m <br />
fucked off that I may end up the same way – no offence by the way. And I’m fucked off because I had what might <br />
have been my last straight sex ever today.”<br />
<br />
Tony looked apologetic and said, “All I can do is apologise for the situation. There’s no way to undo the <br />
changes or stop them before they really start. But it’s not all bad – your dick’s grown a bit right?” Alex <br />
nodded, then Tony continued with a grin, “You a monster like my boy David here?”<br />
<br />
“That’s another thing – what is he even going to do with a dick that big?!”<br />
<br />
“I’ll take that as a ‘no’,” Tony said as he turned to David, then said to Alex, “A dick’s still fun, whatever <br />
the size. But there’s other stuff too. I promise you’ll like what you become: just be open-minded. I know it’s <br />
hard, but we both came through it fine, so did about twenty others. It’s an adjustment – a big one to be fair, <br />
but you’ll carry on.”<br />
<br />
Alex tried to keep a scowl on his face but there was something relaxing about Tony’s manner. He’d really <br />
calmed him down, and he did start to agree: if Alex was going to change he may as well just accept it. Soon, <br />
his curiosity got the better of him, and he asked:<br />
<br />
“So am I going to be as much of a monster as you two?” Alex asked.<br />
<br />
“There’s no way to know but to experience it Alex – I grew from a waif to being this big in three weeks, David <br />
grew to bigger than me obviously, he’s beaten me by about thirty pounds. But not all guys get more muscular – <br />
some put on fat, either instead of muscle or as well as it. Some guys change race, some change height. If you <br />
don’t want to be dumb like this fucker,” Tony motioned to David who was staring at some guy’s ass, “I can tell <br />
you that’s quite unlikely, he’s the only guy who’s got dumber. Hell, you might get smarter or anything else <br />
for that matter. Tell you what though, take my number and let me know what goes on, if you’ve got any <br />
questions or problems or whatever.”<br />
<br />
Alex took it, and decided to excuse himself, but just as he was getting up Tony stopped him, saying, “Actually <br />
Alex, I’ve had a thought. It’s really hard for any guy changing this way, and I thought it might be easier if <br />
you had someone else to rely on for this time. I want you to stay with David.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Alex exclaimed. He wasn’t sure if he could handle being around this huge man for nearly a month – a <br />
man who used to be his friend but was now someone...else.<br />
<br />
“I just think it’s going to be easier for you. Based on our experiences your body’s going to change markedly <br />
and quickly, so you might need someone to buy you clothes or help out in other ways. David,” Tony said, and <br />
David broke his gaze at the guy’s ass to look at Tony, “Take Alex home with you, he’s staying with you until <br />
he’s finished changing.”<br />
<br />
David nodded and lead Alex to his car to drive them both home. On the way Alex couldn’t help marvelling at his <br />
friend’s new stature. At very nearly 300lbs David had grown to colossal size in a few short weeks, with big <br />
heavy pecs, bulging biceps, enormous traps and lats, and abs that were so ridged you could see them through <br />
his t-shirt. His face looked like the David he knew but...different somehow, as though he’d been airbrushed. <br />
His short hair had been allowed to grow out a bit and it was messed up in a stylish way.<br />
When they arrived back at David’s apartment, he showed Alex in and offered him the spare room.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you’re staying here Alex. And...I’m sorry again,” David said with a sad look on his face. He <br />
obviously regretted changing him, but Alex couldn’t bring himself to forgive him yet. So he nodded soberly and <br />
went into his room, crashing out on the bed and not moving for a full twelve hours.</p>
