<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Later, Randy and I decide to meet up with Josh at a new bar, called Franklin’s Super Bar and Grill, located on the corner where 4th and 15th <br />
street intersect.  <br />
<br />
Tommy greets us with his arms out, and gives me a big, bear hug.  He’s wearing a leather jacket, with a blue collared shirt, with light brown <br />
khakis jeans.   He literally looks like Josh Lucas trying out for James Dean in a movie set in the ‘50s.  <br />
(Side note: I haven’t finished law school yet, but I was accepted and still am currently enrolled as a law student.)<br />
<br />
I say, “What’s up, Tommy?  Going for the James Dean look?  Ladies will love that!  How’s life been treating ya?”<br />
<br />
Tommy replies coolly as he put his arm around my neck, “Life’s being swell, you know?  Passed the bar exam, as I’m sure you will in a few <br />
years.  Who’s the newbie?  Are you going to tell me who this new fella is?”<br />
<br />
Randy says sheepishly, “I’m Randy.  Rachel’s older, twin brother.   It’s a pleasure to meet you.”<br />
<br />
As Randy smiles with a big grin, I can’t help but stare briefly at the sway of his hips and his wide smile, as I’m mesmerized by him, as I’m trying <br />
to hide my crush on him (to which he already knows), while going on to communicate with him and Tommy.  Those long legs, wide hips, full <br />
ass, and thin waist…oh wait, I’m not supposed to be gawking at him.  I keep forgetting Randy’s a man, now, and that we had fun, as he had <br />
sex with my asshole.<br />
<br />
As I keep trying to stop from staring at Randy, he has a dark brown, crewcut hair, with a dark brown goatee (painted on), while wearing a dark <br />
blue collared shirt and skinny blue men’s jeans.  I keep thinking to myself, he did such a good job of wearing that binder to strap his boobs <br />
down.  <br />
<br />
I meant, chest.  I love being best friends with Randy.  If there’s anyone I’d go gay for, it’d be him.  He is so hot.  I meant handsome.  Such a <br />
ladies man.  I meant…  Damn, I should stop objectifying Randy as this male hottie in my thoughts.  Rachel is so good looking, even as a man.   <br />
I meant, Randy.  I need to talk to Tommy and Randy before my thoughts run wild.<br />
<br />
Tommy replies back stating his name as he shakes Randy’s hand, “Tom.  Pleased to meet you.  So what are you boys up to lately?  Tell me <br />
what’s new in your lives.”<br />
<br />
I say as a matter of factly, “Well, I’m was just touring around and was busy vacationing with Rachel, who’s been the family tour guide, until I ran <br />
into a snafu a couple of days ago.  A group of guys from a GM Van grabbed a man from a park bench, and then proceeded to chase after me, <br />
as I managed to get away, all the while on foot.”<br />
<br />
He said, “Wow.”<br />
<br />
I go on to say, “They’re still chasing me, as I heard that they would be tapping all of my phone lines, so we had to just get the hell out of the <br />
house.”<br />
<br />
Tommy replies, “Wild story.  Any word on what happened to Rachel?”<br />
<br />
I said, “Well, I received a phone call from her, she said she was safe, but she left to go somewhere safe.  In the meantime, her older brother is <br />
keeping me company-“<br />
<br />
Randy says coyly, “That’s me!”<br />
<br />
I continue to say, “And now, we’re here.”<br />
<br />
Tommy responds, “Incredible story.  Let’s drink up.”<br />
<br />
I say, “Here, here.”<br />
<br />
We clink our glasses together, and proceed to drink.  As we’re drinking and downing beers, Tommy talks to us as we exchange various <br />
conversational topics.  <br />
<br />
Tommy then says to Randy, “So Randy, tell me your story.  I’ve never heard about an older, twin brother…?”<br />
<br />
Randy says sternly, “Well, I was born a couple minutes before Rachel, so I’m older than her by a little bit.   I went to a Western Nebraska <br />
Community College, and have been living with her ever since, which is where she introduced me to my boy, Josh.”<br />
<br />
Tommy replies, “Cool.  I’m co-hosting a beach party at Alexandra’s house.  You guys should come.  It’ll be a great.  Be sure to wear swimming <br />
gear, we’ve got a pool, a bar, big screen TVs, a dance floor and everything.  It’s going to be a blast.”<br />
<br />
I say enthusiastically, “Nice.  We’ll do that.”<br />
<br />
Tommy replies coolly, “Sweet.  Meet up with me in a couple of hours.”<br />
<br />
Randy excuses himself to use the men’s restroom, as I continue to talk with Tommy.<br />
<br />
Another guy comes in.  He’s bald, gruff Caucasian, and is wearing a dirty black suit, a pink collared shirt (it was white, but turned pink after <br />
laundry), and black slacks.  He must be in his 30s, and looks like he wants to beat someone up.  The bouncer checks him for illegal weapons, <br />
to which the bouncer is unable to find any.<br />
<br />
He says to the bouncer as a matter of factly, “I’m looking for a Thomas Richard Phelps.”<br />
<br />
The bouncer says, “Show some ID.”<br />
<br />
He flashes his ID, and proceeds to walk in.<br />
<br />
The bald guy says to Tommy, “Tom, who’s your company?  Lose the fella, we need to talk.”<br />
<br />
Tommy replies with disgust, “Aw Mitch, now’s not a good time.  I really have to go.”<br />
<br />
I ask Tommy, “Is there something wrong?”<br />
<br />
Simultaneously, Mitch says, “In public settings, it’s Mr. Hastings to you, pal.”<br />
<br />
He says, “I have to run.  Just some business to do.  Meet up with me at 4.”<br />
<br />
That was weird.  I don’t believe I’ve seen  Mitch before, but he could be one of the mafia guys.   Tommy wouldn’t be in the mafia.  No.  He’d <br />
never betray me or my trust.<br />
<br />
Mitch tells me, “Sir, we just have a conference meeting, so I assure you that there’s nothing to worry about.  We just have to make some deals <br />
on my company’s lease agreement to rent some space.”<br />
<br />
Alleviated, I say, “That’s fine.  What kind of work are you involved in, and how do you know, Tommy?”<br />
<br />
Mitch says tersely before leaving, “I do construction.  We work on projects concerning highways, roads, sidewalks, and other stuff.  Tommy’s a <br />
family friend, we go way back.  Have fun at the house party.”<br />
<br />
I say to him, “See ya.”<br />
<br />
Randy comes back from the bathroom, as he says, “What was that all about?”<br />
<br />
I say to him, “Tommy left to go make a quick business trip with a construction worker about rent issues.  He’ll be back for the party.”<br />
<br />
Randy says coolly, “Cool.  Wanna get some swimming gear?”<br />
<br />
I say, “Sure.”<br />
<br />
Randy asks me worriedly, “If I get unisex swimming gear, they’ll find me out as physically different, right?  If I wear men’s swimming gear, will <br />
that suffice?”<br />
<br />
I say, “We’ll figure it out.  If you wear the latter, just cross your arms a lot, and don’t smile so much.  We’ll be fine.”<br />
<br />
We down one more drink slowly, before leaving.</p>
