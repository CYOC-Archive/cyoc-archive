<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan Ramer unlocked the door to the office in the Novan Business Center.  The Bureau had been decreasing its surveillance of the werewolf packs in the country since the turn of the century but it had recently ramped up the watch in southern Indiana and northern Kentucky.   His team had been operating out of vans and undercover, but an increase in funding led them into a more permanent local base.<br />
<br />
Agent Ramer decided to check his email, hoping that Agent Patel was operating to her usual standards.  Her reports were a delight to read, if not often packed with content, though under the circumstances he couldn’t expect more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan, <br />
Well, nothing much new at the Selene, our subject has been bringing in new clients and I’ve been working like a one-armed paperhanger getting them signed up.  I know what we saw on tape, but I still have a hard time believing it, especially when I work with her daily.  Anyway, she has been coming in at 0700 and leaving at 2000 regularly occasionally leaving for an hourly lunch break, but more often eating lunch she brings from home.  Sometimes she’ll order the most fattening foods, but never seems to gain an extra ounce, must be one of the hidden benefits.  No signs of any illegal activity.<br />

<br />
Ramer nodded, opening his files on the ladies they were watching:<br />
<br />
SINGER, LISA DEETER<br />
Sex: FEMALE<br />
Date Of Birth: 11 July 1964<br />
Height: 5’ 8”<br />

                  M.A  Physical Fitness – University of Evansville 1992<br />
<br />
Lisa seemed to be the leader of this group, the “Alpha” to use the proper terminology.  As far as they could tell, she had been bitten by a boyfriend when she was twenty-five.  Since she was pregnant with her daughter, he realized he would have to open a file on her as well….<br />
<br />
SINGER, DITA DEETA<br />
Sex: Female<br />
Date of Birth:  28 September 1988<br />
Height: 5’5”<br />

<br />
“Deeta, Dita, Ditaa, Deeda…” Not much more to put in that file, the surveillance on Dita was not that intense.  Based on their research, she would have a hell of a surprise on the seventh of October.<br />
<br />
Dan looked at would be considered the most conventionally suspicious of the group:<br />
<br />
DURAND, SOLANGE<br />
Sex: Female<br />

<br />
Solange had made the mistake of sleeping with a werewolf without protection.  Since her daughter had already been born she was in no danger, but Dan would open a file on her anyway…<br />
<br />

Dan then turned to the second longest member of the group<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
“Tiny little thing,” Dan said to himself.  Still, her grades and SAT scores showed that she had plenty of smarts.  She was also active in the community with several of volunteer work.  Agent Ramer went to the newest coven member.<br />
<br />

                   PhD. History, Cornell University 2001<br />
<br />
Agent Ramer shook his head in amazement.  She must have worked her fingers to the bone to get that kind of an education at her age all while raising a child.  Obviously she was a friend of Ms. Durand when she was getting her Masters at UE.  One thing led to another and there was the result on the DVD.  Ramer decided to open a file on Katie, again just in case.<br />
<br />
TAYLOR, KATHRYN ELIZABETH<br />

<br />

<br />
Unless she was bitten, she would grow up perfectly normal.  Dan wondered how many of the children of these women knew about their parents.  <br />
<br />
GUITIERREZ, ANAYA<br />
Sex: Female<br />
Date of Birth: 11 August 1968<br />

<br />
Anaya was different. She had six children, and her two youngest, a seven year old named Craig, and his twin sister Lupe (oh brother) would be werewolves.  She was a spitting image of Angelina Jolie, Dan marveled to himself.  Lupe had been bitten eight years ago, before moving east.  He decided to hold off on making a file for the twins, but as for their older sister…<br />
<br />
GUITIERREZ, MARIA<br />
Sex: Female<br />

<br />
She was still in the clear as far as lycanthropy is concerned, though four moving violations in the year since she had gotten her drivers license was cause for concern.<br />
<br />
“OK then, our last victim…”<br />
<br />
MCDONALD, BRENDA<br />

<br />
Rachel was looking to follow her mother in Physical Education. As captain of the cheerleading team, and a scratch golfer, she would be well prepared for it.<br />
<br />
Dan opened up the FBI memo on lycanthropy.<br />
<br />
TOP SECRET – SPECIAL ACCESS ONLY <br />
<br />
&quot;Lycanthropy or werewolvism is a transmissible condition that causes the person afflicted to change into a wolf.  According to sources, it originated in Europe, most likely around the Carpathian Mountains well before the Common Era.  Therianthropy, the generic version, is found on every continent but Antarctica, but the wolf form is the most common.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;For most people, lycanthropy is seen either as a myth, or as a clinical psychiatric condition.  The US government was made aware of the existence of werewolves as early as 1804.  Naturally, this fact was quickly concealed.  Though all therianthropes are considered full human beings according to the US Constitution, they are aware of the considerable distress that would almost certainly result if their existence were to become widely known.  For this reason, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has endeavored to monitor the actions of known werewolf groups, 'packs' for the purpose of security of all concerned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lycanthropy is most closely associated with viral diseases, though it is clearly its own category.  An afflicted person is essentially like any other person until the three nights in which the moon is at its brightest.  At that time, the individual undergoes an involuntary metamorphosis into the form of a large wolf (Canis lupis).  The individual remains in wolf form until the sun passes the horizon the next day.  In the case of newer lycanthropes, they may remain in wolf form until the moon is no longer in phase.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lycanthropes have the ability to shift voluntarily as necessary; the most skilled among them can modify individual body parts as necessary.  For convenience, they may also shift partially into a hybrid wolf-human form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The condition is spread through heredity; a child born to a lycanthrope will also be one.  It may also be spread to non-lycanthropes through several vectors.  A bite is the most commonly known method, but involuntary bites are highly uncommon. A blood transfusion will certainly transmit the condition, as such; blood donor stations are given a list of conditions that would eliminate lycanthropes without being aware of their existence.  Finally, unprotected sexual intercourse, and sexual fluids entering the bloodstream or mucous membranes will also transmit the condition.&quot;<br />
<br />
The memo continued for several pages, but Dan put it away and switched on CNN.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“Mind if I undress?” Ebony asked. “All that legal stuff stressed me out.”<br />
“Mmmmmm…me too,” offered Solange.<br />
<br />
“I think we’ll all get undressed,” said Lisa. “Werewolves have few inhibitions.”<br />
<br />
Wendy couldn’t help feeling aroused as the four older women undressed, but she struggled successfully to keep her emotions in check.  All were several years older than she was, but their faces were unlined, their muscles firm.  They sat on the floor, motioning Wendy over to join them in a rough circle.<br />
<br />
“That’s much better.  What else would you like to know, Wendy?<br />
<br />
It was Sharon who asked the question.  “Uh, so how did you become like you are?” Wendy asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, as for me,” replied Sharon, “I met Solange at UE, she was getting her Masters in History, and she had asked me for some help with her thesis.  It was strange.  I’d never been attracted to women before but after meeting with her I felt drawn to her.  Well, I was a single mom and it felt awkward, but we felt right together.  Eventually it got to the point she told me what happens to her on the full moon.  We didn’t know it at the time, but we had already exchanged enough fluids to affect me.”  Sharon giggled.  “I thought I was going to see her transform.  Suffice it to say that I wasn’t nearly as interested in her as I was in me when the moon rose.  I immediately knew what was happening, mind you, but it still scared the shit out of me.  Of course I was welcomed into the Coven like the DVD shows.”<br />
<br />
Wendy laughed despite herself.  “Does Katie know?”<br />
<br />
“Not yet.  We have the FBI watching us, and we’d rather not take a chance on them thinking that we don’t mind being exposed; oh, but I guess you know that.  Katie is still a little girl; she doesn’t need to know that yet.”<br />
<br />
Ebony piped in, “Wait till Katie is forty, has kids of her own, and is the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.  She’ll STILL be a little girl to you!”  More laughter and agreement filled the room.<br />
<br />
Wendy relaxed a bit removing her jacket.  “Um…no offense, but you all seem kind of…developed.  Or is that just a coincidence?”<br />
<br />
The four women all shook their heads.  Lisa answered, “Once you become a werewolf, your body begins to change.  We’ve all grown an additional cup size, Sharon still has a ways to go before she is done filling out, and our hair gets a lot thicker and more extensive…all of our hair.”<br />
<br />
Wendy felt a definite warmth in her belly.  “What does it feel like,” she whispered.<br />
<br />
Anaya spoke, “Words can’t do it justice Wendy.  Wendy, could you stand up for me?”  They both did so.<br />
<br />
“Give me your hand…”  Wendy complied.  Anaya’s hand felt soft and warm in hers.  Anaya moaned slightly.   Wendy felt Anaya’s hand shift slightly, felt it pulse against hers.  Wendy looked down expecting to see Anaya squeezing her hand rapidly, but it was pulsing of its own volition.  The FBI agent was amazed to see tiny hairs oozing of her skin, and the soft hand she held was beginning to feel coarse and calloused.  Muscles and tendons popped softly.  Wendy gasped in astonishment...and arousal.  She began to unbutton her blouse.<br />
<br />
Sharon joined the two, “Wendy, let me help you,” her teeth popping as they elongated slightly.  Together they removed her blouse and bra.  Anaya and Sharon embraced Wendy.  Wendy felt Sharon’s massive golden bush massage her lower back and the smooth ivory of the flat of her fangs caress her upper shoulders.  “I won’t bite,” she reassured Wendy in a husky voice.<br />
<br />
With her furry clawed paws, Anaya caressed Wendy’s small but firm brown breasts.  Even through the fabric of her pants, Anaya’s wiry pubic hair tickled Wendy’s skin.<br />
“Let’s get those off you,” said Sharon as she gently unzipped her pants.  Anaya pulled down Wendy’s pants and panties together revealing her shaven nether regions, now oozing fluids.  Wendy gasped in pleasure, her delicate hand sliding there.<br />
<br />
“No,” commanded Sharon with a growl, “let me.”  She took Wendy in her muscular furry arms and laid her down in the center of the carpet.  “God, you’re beautiful,” said Lisa, as Wendy’s nudity triggered the change in both her and Ebony.<br />
<br />
Wendy was near delirious with pleasure as Lisa sat behind her, cradling her body, pulling Wendy firmly against her flesh.  Wendy gasped as she felt a strange pricking sensation and heard a slight rustling as fur sprouted from Lisa’s skin.  Wendy spread her legs for Sharon as Sharon opened hers.  They screamed in delight as Sharon’s furred nether lips met Wendy’s clitoris.  A strange tingling washed over Wendy and faded.  Lisa exchanged a nervous look with Ebony and Anaya.  Oblivious, Wendy and Sharon continued their lovemaking as Lisa, Ebony and Anaya continued their transformations and their own pleasures.  Wendy soon felt her body shake with the most powerful orgasm she had ever experienced, followed right after by Sharon.  Exhausted and spent, they dozed off.<br />
<br />
“Wendy…..Wendy…WENDY!!”  Wendy awoke to Lisa smiling at her shaking her awake.  “It’s a little after two o’clock, and we do have a meeting to get to.  Are you feeling okay?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, GOD, Lisa, that was incredible!  Thank you!”  Wendy kissed Lisa on the cheek as she got up.  “Let me get a quick shower.”<br />
<br />
Fifteen minutes, showered and fully awake, Lisa and Wendy drove to the meeting.<br />
<br />
“I really thought we were going to lose you there for a bit, Wen.  Glad you decided to join us.”<br />
<br />
Wendy giggled.  “Well, I think I will definitely accept the promotion you’re offering me, but I’ll pass on being a werewolf.”  She smiled to reassure her.  “Don’t worry, Lisa.  I will do everything I can to ensure that you and your sisters remain safe and in secret, but no, I like being human just fine.”<br />
<br />
Lisa’s eyes widened in fear, she swallowed hard and whispered with genuine sympathy to her passenger…<br />
<br />
“Oh sweet Wendy…”</p>
