<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;First things first,&quot; Eileen said. &quot;Let&#39;s head upstairs and you make me taller.&quot; Ty nodded, as he now snuck upstairs past June. As the two teens now entered Ty&#39;s room he carefully took the 4 inch tall trench out of his pocket, gently placing her on his bed.<br />
<br />
Eileen gazed around Tys room, noting how barren it seemed. &quot;Not really into decorating I see,&quot; she said. &quot;Mark and June aren&#39;t big into spending money on me,&quot; he shrugged. &quot;Its been like this since I got here. That and I really never wanted much. Just a bed, desk, and a small t.v.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Eileen said sternly. &quot;We are definitely fixing that but first make me taller.&quot; Ty nodded as he now focused his power. Slowly but surely he watched as Eileen once again began to grow. The naked teen girl expanded on his bed, growing taller. As Eileen grew she slowly walked towards the edge of the bed, eventually sitting on the edge as she watched her feet descend to the floor. By the time she had reached 5 feet tall again she stood and walked to Ty. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said. &quot;While I really like being this size can you make me a little taller, maybe your height?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded, focusing as Eileen grew three inches taller, leaving her 5&#39;3&quot; like him. Eileen smiled as she now found herself eye to eye with Ty. &quot;This should be good,&quot; she smiled. &quot;But, um, can you get me something to wear please.&quot; Ty blushed as he now retreated from his room and entered June&#39;s. June stood around 5&#39;6&quot; or 5&#39;7&quot; meaning her clothes would fit the teenage Eileen. Finding an old sundress in her closet, Ty returned handing it to Eileen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said softly, her cheeks blushing. Throwing the sundress on Eileen now glanced at her appearance. Thankfully June was on the skinnier side, meaning the womans dress wasn&#39;t overly baggy. While it did hang lower on the teenage girl (it brushed her shins instead of hanging to her knees) it would suit her for now. &quot;So what&#39;s your plan Eileen,&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
Eileen smirked as she looked over at Ty. &quot;Well this is what I&#39;m thinking,&quot; she said. &quot;You said June was little miss popularity back in her day right?&quot; Ty nodded as an impish smirk spread over her face. &quot;Let&#39;s bring her back to those days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait you want June to be a teen again,&quot; Ty gaped. &quot;Sort of,&quot; Eileen chuckled. &quot;See I&#39;m kind of an expert on mean girls, dealt with a lot of then growing up. The thing is though, mean girls are only mean to their peers or people younger and less developed than they are. Let&#39;s see how she  reacts when shes back in junior high and has to deal with a couple of high school kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty grinned as he listened to Eileen&#39;s plan. Turning his foster mother into an awkward teenage girl just entering puberty would certainly leave her confidence shaken, especially having to deal with two teenagers. Ty now focused on June, making her younger than them by a few years<br />
<br />
June frowned as she poured herself a glass of wine. Ty was falling behind on his chores today. She needed the house to look good before her friends came over. June had been obsessed with appearances since childhood, growing up she had always been the prettiest, the smartest, the girl everyone wanted to be. June had been the girl voted most likely to succeed, the girl everyone wanted to be. That she was now stuck in a boring suburban life with a moderate income only angered her. She was supposed to be the envy of everyone, instead she was just another face in the crowd. Now June&#39;s passion was putting on appearances to make people think she was better off than she was. If her house was clean and beautiful than others would think she was someone that mattered, that and she loved being complimented on how nice her house looked. As she reached for the bottle of wine to top off her glass, she felt a slight shiver run over her body.<br />
<br />
June grunted in frustration as she now stood. They had just fixed the boiler, there was no way it was broken. As she checked the thermostat she could see that the temperature was correct. &quot;Why am I feeling that tingle,&quot; she frowned. The last thing she wanted was something going wrong when company was coming over. As she now walked towards the kitchen, towards the basement door, she felt her slacks slide on her hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I losing weight,&quot; she whispered. Checking her pants June could see a little more room in her pants than usual. June had always tried to maintain a trim figure as she grew older. It filled her with pride that all her hard work had kept her 40 year old body in great shape. While her friends all had put on weight after pregnancy, June kept a trim figure. Her friends were jealous of the fact that she still looked fantastic even after having a child and passing 40. Still, she had been a size 7 for most of her adult life. Grunting in frustration she now trudged upstairs, noticing her blouse and bra felt loose on her body as well.<br />
<br />
Ty and Eileen had heard June&#39;s footsteps as she ascended the stairs. Staying as quiet  as possible the two teens peaked out of Tys room, smiling as June passed. June looked to be back in her mid 20s now. The dull skin and hair had been replaced. June&#39;s skin seemed to glow while her blond locks looked full and luxurious cascading to the middle of her back. As she entered her room Ty and Eileen could see she was still growing younger.<br />
<br />
June entered her room, hitching up her loose slacks as she approached her dresser. Opening her draws she now began looking for a suitable replacement. As she looked up into her dresser mirror she shrieked as she saw her face.<br />
<br />
June looked like a college student now. The 20 year olds face was flawless and beautiful while her blond hair looked healthier than it had in years. Gently caressing her cheek, June watched as she continued to grow younger,  becoming a teenager once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m young,&quot; she gasped. Gazing at her appearance June couldn&#39;t help but laugh softly. She was 18 again, in the prime of her life. June was once again the prom queen, the most popular girl in school. She couldn&#39;t have been happier. Twirling around June looked down at herself, smiling as she found her body once again at the point in her life where she was happiest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its a miracle,&quot; she said happily. &quot;I&#39;m me again. Young, beautiful, ready to take on the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
June continued to laugh gleefully as she looked over her curvy teenage form, complete with c cup breasts. As she did she felt her clothes shift on her youthful form, finding that even her shoes seemed loose on her body. Turning to the mirror once more June&#39;s smile began to fade.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; she whispered as she looked at the 16 year old girl. &quot;Wait, hold on. This...this is too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
June gazed on alarm as she saw the girls face become more childish with every passing second. The teenage girl in the mirror now looked closer to freshman year rather than senior year. June&#39;s curves were slowly being eroded awas ar as she grew younger. The prom queen with the killer curves was gone, replaced with a very pretty freshman girl still growing into her body. As June went from 15 to 14 she gave an audible gasp as she began to grow shorter.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she whimpered as she grew smaller. &quot;No, I dont want this. Make it stop. Somebody, anybody, please make it stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
June looked horror struck as she became 14 then 13. The young teens body was reliving puberty in reverse as she grew younger. June&#39;s face was now more childish than teen as she raced backwards in age. Grasping her chest June could feel her breasts rapidly deflating, going from c cups to barely b. Looking once more in the mirror the girl gasped. June was now just a 7th grade girl. Barely a teenager with little curve and small conical breasts of a girl just entering womanhood. June was even surprised she was much shorter than before, barely 5 feet tall she looked to see her slacks a comedian around her much smaller feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she wailed in a girlish tone. &quot;No I didnt want to be this young.&quot; Tears now began to leak from the girls eyes as she wiped them on her oversized sleeve. She was a child once more, a frightened and confused child.<br />
<br />
Eileen and Ty had watched June&#39;s descent with interest. The woman had been reduced to a barely teenage girl with barely developed curves. This girl, while pretty, could not hold a candle to Eileen now. Even at Eileen&#39;s reduced age, she appeared far more mature in appearance. &quot;Nice job Ty,&quot; Eileen said. &quot;Now what shall we do?&quot;</p>
