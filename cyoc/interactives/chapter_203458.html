<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This was accidently posted in the wrong thread originally.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I know. We will...will...&quot;, Lilith began to feel faint before being unable to stand anymore and falling onto the ground with a loud thud. &quot;MISTRESS!&quot;, Lucy scream as she ran over to her queen&#39;s side. &quot;Mistress? Are you ok? You seemed to have fainted. Quickly let’s get you to a bed to lay down on.&quot; Lucy said her new servant instincts kicking in.<br />
<br />
Lilith looked up at her servant, &quot;I&#39;m fine Lucy, I just needed to...&quot; she quickly lost her train of thought as she felt faint again. Lucy quickly pulled her up and carried her to a bed in the house. &quot;Tsk. Tsk. This will not do. A Queen deserves more than a lowly human bed.&quot; The Succubus laid Lilith down onto the bed before looking down at her clearly ailing Mistress. &quot;One Moment.&quot; The succubus then began to use her magic to transform the room into a regal looking bedroom. The small bed became a full-sized mattress adorned with silk covers and clothes. The nightstands transformed into tables holding lit candles along with gourmet foods. The rest of the room followed suit becoming something fit for a queen, covered in velvet and other expensive materials. Everything was changed. All except for one photo. Lucy stopped her spell as she began to walk over to a chair positioned next to Lilith lying on the bed.<br />
<br />
While walking over to her Queen&#39;s side she noticed the photo frame on one of the nightstands that had somehow escaped the rooms transformation. &quot;Hmmm, how did this escape?&quot; Lucy contemplated. Lilith turned her head in the bed as Lucy sat down in the large chair next to her. &quot;Let me see.&quot; Lilith asked her servant. Lucy showed the picture to the demon queen whose eyes began to widen slightly. Although she pushed almost all the memories of her previous human life to the deepest recesses of her mind, she could still recognize the two standing in the picture.<br />
<br />
&quot;It does not matter. Please, we must continue. We cannot re-&quot; Just as Lilith was trying to get up, she felt a forceful kiss against her. At first Lilith was furious and tried to push Lucy off but she was so tired and drained of energy that she eventually allowed her servant to continue until her head was back against the pillows of the warm, comfortable bed. &quot;No. You are clearly drained of energy. You need rest right now, Mistress. Please, allow your eternal servant to take care of you.&quot; The Succubus of Lust looked down with a commanding but caring look. Lilith sighed in defeat; her servant was right. She was still gaining all her energy back after spending so long trapped in Baphinox. Lilith shuddered at the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something the matter, Mistress Lilith?&quot; Lucy saw her queen clearly contemplating something. Lilith slightly chuckled at her servants’ words, &quot;I assume you have many questions?&quot; Lilith said as her servant took out a rag to place atop of her forehead, making sure to go around her astounding horns.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is not the place of a servant to ask questions. I am bound to be unquestioning of your plans or wisdom unless you allow me the privilege to speak freely.&quot; Lucy said almost as if she had rehearsed the line for hundreds of years. Lilith looked back down at the picture now sitting upon the nightstand again. &quot;You may ask anything you wish my dear.&quot; Lilith said looking back at her servant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Mistress. I shall begin with a broad but simple question. How did this all happen?&quot; Her servant looked away while asking to grab some silk clothes to put over her Queen&#39;s body. Lilith smiled as she began to tell the tale. &quot;What may seem so simple on the surface is more complex the deeper you delve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thousands of years prior, I was the only demon to exist. I spent years walking through hell on my own, a queen of nothing but barren wastes and emptiness. Soon, I found my way to here, what humans call Earth and discovered their species. Naturally they looked at me with fear, however I understood as such as I felt the same way. We may have looked similar, but the truth is one look, and the difference was obvious. The horns, wings…it was all clearly different. Not helped by my first real interaction with a human man.”, Lilith mused as Lucy began to tidy up her queen’s hair.<br />
<br />
“What happened, Mistress?” Lucy asked beginning to clean off her queen’s body using some clothes and lotion, making sure that her breasts were clear of any blemishes and dirt. Lilith felt her sensitive nipples become erect as her servant rubbed them but even though she felt the pleasure, she couldn’t even moan from her lack of energy. “Well, it’s quite simple actually. I ran into a man while walking through the forest and my instincts began to kick in. I seduced him and he fell under my spell. From the very beginning, I knew what would happen. And soon, it was no longer a man I was having sex with, but an incubus. Within those few minutes he had already forgotten his human life and only lived for pleasure. A side effect of not having a soul. During my orgasm with him, I had expended much of my energy into a small but concentrated explosion around us. After, I had hoped I would be able to control him, but with it being my first-time consuming a soul, I was in total ecstasy. By the time I recovered, there were 10 others who joined the demon ranks. At the time…I was distraught. I didn’t want this.”<br />
<br />
Lilith looked off into the distance almost lost in thought as Lucy finished cleaning her queen off before putting the silk clothes on her with the help of some magic. “I will leave the choice to wear some more…queenly clothes once you have fully recovered.” Lucy stated while her mistress sat in thought. “So, I quickly sent them all down to hell as fast as I could, allowing them to fulfill their new desires without endangering other mortals. But it was already too late. The tale quickly spread among the humans and within a couple years, I was only seen as one thing, A lust obsessed being only designed to destroy the wills of men and women. Only to fall into being the same being I am. Now, they were not wrong. I knew that was my purpose. But that’s not what I wanted. I wanted a real connection.”<br />
<br />
“Excuse my interruption, Queen Lilith, but you talked about these ‘Side-effects’ without a soul. What do you mean by that?” Lucy asked curiously as she grabbed some sheets to pull over Lilith.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you asked. To put it simply when I was created, I was to be a ‘failsafe’. A plan B if humanity overstepped its bounds. However, for me to exist in any capacity, demonic energy needs to always exist. The problem was demonic energy is very powerful. Any human would fall to corruption in mere seconds without some form of protection. That protection is the soul. Designed to block or at the very least keep the corruption at bay. It’s not perfect, however. A soul can be twisted with enough time or influence. So, a second, but much more desperate measure was put into place. A corrupted soul wants to join with more demonic energy if it feels the vessel is no longer able to allow it the pleasure or comfort of a human body, so your body will quickly begin to change as much as it can to accommodate the soul, almost always forcing the human to become the best and sexiest version they could be. But the truth is, it will always fail. That is what happened with your old self Lucy. The difference is you were given a seal. A seal traps your soul allowing you to keep some parts of your old self, being able to think with more complexity than the average succubus, incubus, or any other type of demon.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, you can continue with your previous story if you wish mistress.” Lucy said beginning to add the finishing touches to Lilith’s body and bed.<br />
<br />
“Ah, yes. A connection. I wanted to feel real love. And I found that man…one who could look past my demonic nature. A man who could love without falling victim to my corruption if he so chose. But that was not meant to be. Humanity would never allow it, even if it had been a thousand years since then. But we still tried. He knew who and what I was but still wanted to be with me. That all changed when I was betrayed. The first man I ever corrupted was more powerful than any other demon besides me more than likely due to my explosion of demonic energy that took place after taking his soul. Even a demon queen had to start somewhere. He became known as Baphinox and loathed my curse to keep them in hell, so using a series of other methods, he began to influence humans against me and used it to disclose my location.” Lilith took a moment as Lucy rubbed her queens’ shoulder and her right breast, finally being able to feel a small amount of pleasure again.<br />
<br />
“When I was found, the man had agreed to become my husband and king and go through with the change. He was to become Lucifer. But before that could fully happen, the house we were hiding in was broken into by priests and an angry mob. Baphinox had told them how to lock me away, using a hand-crafted item that could change shape to fit within the timeframe it resided in. My love did everything he told, before he was struck down right as I was being sealed into that cursed instrument. But before I was fully sealed, I vowed to return and destroy humanity. It had overstepped its bounds and I would show them the error of their ways. I spent thousands of years gaining the energy and ability to leave that instrument through a vessel. Baphinox knew whoever played it would become possessed, even if for a short time. What he never realized was that I gained energy from those interactions. I spent those years fulfilling the evil desires of humans, eventually destroying them. Now I have returned, I will enact my takeover of this human world, the ever-expanding world of hell, and whatever other world we may come across. All will know Lilith as their queen or die fighting.” Lilith was finally finished with her plan as Lucy smiled at her queen.<br />
<br />
“Mistress, know I will be here to help you for the rest of eternity. You shall decide how to proceed soon but before you rest, I have one final question.” Lucy looked with a stern but caring look at her queen. “This picture. Why did it seem to bother you?”<br />
<br />
“That was us as humans. Though we have no need for the memories of their lives, they are still there if we so wish to look through them. It does not matter now; we are perfect. Beautiful, sexy, and corruptive demons but know this Lucy, even if they were fully restored, they have fallen to the corruption. All that would happen is a continuation of my plans. Now, I must rest. As for you my servant, I believe you deserve a reward for your actions here. There is a young man next door. Someone your old self had a minor crush on. Go and show him a good time.” Lilith ordered her servant.<br />
<br />
Lucy smiled and leaned down, kissing her mistress for a few moments. “I will return mistress. Rest now.” Lucy then got up and walked out of the room, closing, and sealing the door behind her for Queen Lilith to rest comfortably. After she left the room, the maidly façade faded quickly. A hunger filled her corrupted silts as she licked her lips and bit her tongue. Her first corruption was upon her.<br />
<br />
10 minutes later, moans of pleasure could be heard in the neighboring house. A man was convulsing on the bed as Lucy bounced up and down on his rapidly expanding, erect cock. She finished sucking up his soul like soup as her EE cup breasts bounced before suddenly the quickly transforming man flipped them over. His eyes already red slits as he pounded the succubus. The man’s skin turned a light gray while his new wings, horns, and tail began to form. His expanding muscles giving him infinite strength to fuck this sexy succubus.<br />
<br />
“THAT’S IT! GIVE IN TO YOUR NEW RULER, QUEEN LILITH” Lucy shouted in bliss as the new incubus groaned out as his transformation finished. But he was far from finished with the succubus who showed him this indescribable pleasure. “Give me…your…cum…all of it!” Lucy demanded as she felt his large, 12-inch cock thrust in and out of her succubus pussy. The physical incarnation of lust that was Lucy gave the incubus more stamina that wouldn’t be possible without her aura.<br />
<br />
10 minutes dragged into an hour. The bed was destroyed by this point but neither the succubus nor incubus cared. Both were finally reaching their peak. Lucy clamped down on the large demonic cock as the incubus got stuck in her pussy. They orgasmed at the same time; the incubus’s demonic, black cum shooting into Lucy as she orgasmed screaming out in pleasure. Soon, they came down from the powerful orgasm, but the newly created incubus was completely drained. “Hmmmm, don’t worry. I’ll see you in hell again soon. For now, you will return to hell and await Queen Lilith’s command.” Lucy explained as the incubus disappeared into a flame. Her hungry look of lust had subsided as she recomposed herself to return to Lilith side as she rested. They had much more to look forward to. For now, her undivided attention will remain with her mistress.</p>
