<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a very long day of Nancy gathering her things to move in and getting Charlotte ready for her photo montage as a fairy, the two ladies were lounging in the living room and talking about the precious event at the toy store. &quot;... and then, when the little girl said &#39;I do believe in fairies. I do!&#39; so that she could see you. That was hilarious!&quot; Nancy laughed at the poor girl&#39;s attempt to play with Charlotte when they were getting costumes for Charlotte.<br />
&quot;Ha ha, very funny. The next time when you turn into a fairy and I bring you to a toy store for outfits, I will let people play with you.&quot; The tiny woman, who was too small to sit in a proper chair so she sat on a toy one instead, would be having nightmares for weeks due to how terrifying that girl was. &quot;Still, we got your luggage full of your stuff, including your laptop with the programming to the nanomachines.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And,&quot; Nancy spoke up, &quot;We got all of those cute outfits and costumes for the photo shoot. Which, I must say, that I will be treasuring them to my dying days.&quot; Nancy brought up her phone to see her fairy friend dressed in various costumes and settings. While the majority of them are of Charlotte acting like a curious fairy in natural settings while wearing leaf-like dresses, there are a few of them that have her dress in a more modern style and posing in front of various household items. &quot;Do you have enough in there for your spank bank Nancy?&quot; Charlotte asked with a slight bit of worrying in her voice. &quot;If we have more time, I would love to have taken more photos of you in a more public space if you were willing to,” Nancy said while swiping through her photos. <br />
“Well tough luck there, Nancy. Because in less than half an hour, I will no longer be fun-size anymore.” Charlotte stood up from her seat and hopped off to the floor. “Still, it was fun while it lasted.” Nancy grew downtrodden for a moment until she brightened up a little. “Well, there are still a lot more days left in the month. There could be a chance that you could turn back into a fairy or one of the other fae folks from folklore.” Charlotte just stared at her friend with astonishment. “How could a renowned scientist, who made a technology that can transform me into anything, be so invested in fantasy and fairy tales?” Nancy shrugs at the oddity of it. “I don’t know. Maybe because I find the fantasy aspect of it all interesting. Or maybe because since I know how the machines work, the mystery of it all has lost interest to me.” At that moment, Charlotte’s grandfather clock began to ring. Signaling that it is now the fourth day.<br />
<br />
“Okay, here I come. Normal size this time.” Charlotte was hyping herself up, hoping to feel the nanomachines work their magic on her. “Well, if you are going to grow back to normal, I think you should take off your clothes so that you won’t rip them apart.” Charlotte looked down at her current outfit, a Barbie top and matching skirt, and said “Get me my PJ shirt.” “Really?” Charlotte was getting embarrassed at the thought of stripping in front of her best friend. Even while doing the shoot, Nancy was nice enough to get her a cardboard box for her to change costumes. “I still feel uncomfortable to be in the nude with people watching me.” The taller girl just shook her head and got up to get her friend a shirt. “Okay, Charlotte. Just give me a minute to find it then. Where is it?” ”It should be on the bed. Pastel blue with wolves on it. And hurry, I can feel myself getting taller.”<br />
Sure enough, Charlotte was growing up and out of her clothes. She turned around to see her six wings falling off and by touching her ears, she could tell that they were now losing their point. Her sharp features that she revived from being slightly elven were fading away to a softer feature from before. “Yes! I’m getting taller! I’m getting bigger! I’m getting… numb?” The numb feeling was new to Charlotte. While she does get that feeling from sitting in the toilet for too long, the numbness seems to be emitting from her hands and feet. And that feeling seemed to spread up her limbs. “What, what happening to me this time!?!” Charlotte stiffly raised her arm to see her hand, seeing how her fingers had started to fuse and her wrist was becoming a ball joint. “What was that Charlotte? Sorry it took me a while, but I managed to find it- CHARLOTTE!!” Nancy walked back to the living room, seeing her friend looking slightly off. It looks slightly like a Barbie doll.<br />
<br />
As Charlotte’s features began to gain the famous doll looks and figure, Nancy rushed to her computer to figure out how to save her friend. She could hear her friend frantically typing behind her, Charlotte began to lose her balance on her plasticity legs. Even her feet have been forced upward so that she can wear Barbie’s heels, which adds more to Charlotte’s loss of balance. “Just hold on a minute Charlotte. I’m almost at the code to fix this.” Charlotte couldn’t reply even if she could. The transformation has made it to her head, giving Charlotte a painted look on a plastic head with very long hair (not as long as the second day but pretty long). But Charlotte is still aware inside, trying to talk with her frozen, modeled lips and trying to get up with her elongated, slim limbs that she can no longer bend. “Okay, I think I got it. Are you still okay Charlotte?” <br />
<br />
Silence filled the room. <br />
<br />
“Charlotte, are you still here?” Nancy walked towards the fallen doll on the ground, a doll that was her friend a couple of minutes ago. “No! I made sure that I got to the code before you had turned completely.” Nancy grabbed her dolli-fied form of Charlotte and brought her to the computer. After clicking and typing on the keyboard, Nancy faced her little friend to tell her the news. “Well, I have some good news, some bad news, and fun news. What do you want to hear first?” <br />
On the inside, Charlotte yelled out, “Good news! Please tell me that I can turn back!” After waiting for a silent reply, Nancy continues. “Bad news first, okay. The bad news is that I couldn’t stop the nanomachines from completely transforming you into a marketable toy, but was able to stop it before your mind disappeared too.” If Charlotte was able to move her face, she would have an “I was this close to disappearing!” face. Nancy paused once again to allow Charlotte to chew on that idea before continuing to the next bit of news. <br />
<br />
“As for the good news, I made sure to remove all options of inanimate transformation. Apparently, when I had downloaded a whole bunch of transformation prompts for the nanomachines, a handful of them were about people transforming into inanimate objects. Now, whatever you transform next, it will be something alive and could move about on its own.&quot; Charlotte liked this good news that Nancy gave her. But the fact that there is a transformation of people who turn into inanimate objects AND are interested in it mildly concerns her. &quot;At the very least you don&#39;t have that kink. Right Nancy?&quot; is what Charlotte would say if she was able to say words.<br />
After another pause, Nancy finishes off the last of the news to Charlotte. &quot;And finally, we have the fun news. Since we were talking about having more time to take more photos, and now that you are a doll that can pose for me in many ways...&quot; Nancy then grabbed Charlotte and made her pose into various forms, including some yoga ones too to show her case. &quot;... We are going to have a lot of fun in the morning. It&#39;s a good thing we kept those doll clothes.&quot; The idea of not only feeding her friend more materials for her amusement but also knowing that Nancy will have to strip her to put on the more ridiculous costumes and outfits terrified Charlotte.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to do that Charlotte?&quot; Nancy asked her dolli-fied friend, not being able to hear the silent screaming of &quot;NO! NO! ANYTHING BUT THAT!!&quot; from Charlotte. Nancy reached forward to Charlotte&#39;s head and made it look like she was nodding yes to her question. &quot;Then I will see you in the morning. You don&#39;t mind if I sleep in your bed tonight as well do you?&quot; More forced nodding from Charlotte, to which Nancy got up and started to get ready for bed. <br />
<br />
Charlotte have a beautiful smile and she must scream.</p>
