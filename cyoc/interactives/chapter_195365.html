<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up the next morning full of excitement.  Today is set to be the happiest moment of your life...at least until your wedding.  After a quick shower, you grab your clothes and...strangely, your bra doesn&#39;t fit.  After a couple minutes squeezing them in and struggling with the straps, you finally get it on, but one look in your mirror sends you into a panic.  Your breasts are clearly much larger than they were last night.  &quot;Could I be pregnant?  But we used a condom!&quot; you think as you frantically search your bag for the box they came in.  You find it, and to your horror the box says they expired 3 months ago.  &quot;Oh shit it must have broken, what am I going to do...&quot;  You pace around for a few seconds and then suddenly remember:  &quot;That&#39;s right!  I just have to go to the pharmacy and grab a pack of emergency hormone blockers.  That&#39;ll stop the embryo from implanting, just like Plan B in my old reality, and then my changes will reverse.  Well as long as I&#39;m still...&quot;<br />
You quickly pull down your underwear, revealing that your dick is still attached.  For now.  But time is of the essence.  The penis detaches between 12 and 36 hours after the egg is fertilized, you remember that from health class.  Meaning you might only have until noon.  &quot;I&#39;ll rush out and do it right now before-&quot; &quot;Tyyyy!  Sam is here!&quot; your father calls from downstairs.  &quot;Shit, I can&#39;t leave now.  If I tell dad what happened he&#39;ll make me be Sam&#39;s wife, which neither of us want!  I&#39;ll just have to hide it for now and slip out as soon as I can.&quot;  &quot;Just a minute!&quot; you call back, ducking into the bathroom to wrap your newly enlarged breasts in a bandage.  Thankfully they don&#39;t seem to have grown too much yet, you may have a while to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Though you managed to text Sam about what was going on, and he did his best to speed things up, your father is over the moon about your engagement and keeps the two of you stuck talking to him all morning, and most of the afternoon too.  Finally, after an awkward and slightly panicked dinner, you&#39;re able to run to the pharmacy.  &quot;Was my car door always this heavy?&quot; you worry to yourself as you dash into the store.  You grab a bottle of emergency hormone blockers and take them to the counter.  The cashier says nothing, but gives you a look of pity.  You dash back out to your car a bit more slowly than you dashed into the store and hop onto a seat with a bit more cushion than you remember.  Your ass and hips must have started growing, and from the pain in your chest under the bandage wrap your chest wasn&#39;t done either.  But that was a good sign, in a way.  If your other changes were close to finished you&#39;d lose your dick before you could get home and reverse them.<br />
<br />
You fly into the driveway and hop out of your car, hobbling inside as best you can, unused to your knew proportions, and your new height.  You realize you&#39;re taller as you almost hit your head on the doorframe outside your bedroom.  Pushing the door closed, you pull down your pants and... &quot;thank god, it&#39;s still there!&quot; Your dick is still attached!  You made it!  Now you just have to open the bottle and...you can&#39;t get it open.  You realize that your already scrawny body has been changing all day into an even scrawnier one.  And now you can&#39;t exert enough force to get the child safe cap off the medicine you need to undo it!  You try taking off your t-shirt and using it to get a better grip, but to no avail.  &quot;My pocket knife!  I&#39;ll grab it out of my trunk and cut the plastic!&quot; you think in a panic.  However, the heavy wooden trunk at the foot of your bed proves as much of a challenge as the medicine bottle.  Crouching down for more leverage, you&#39;re finally starting to get the lid up when you suddenly feel like you&#39;ve gotten the wind knocked out of you.  You fall backwards onto your now sizeable ass, feeling a sudden warmth all over your body.  Not an unpleasant heat, but the same kind of feeling you had last night when you were having sex with Sam.  Your dick, still attached, is rock hard.  It feels like you&#39;re about to come, and even the slightest touch might set you off.  Realizing the bandage on your chest is restricting your breathing, and is probably the reason you collapsed, you put your hand on your chest and unwrap it.  Then you come. At least, you see yourself come; but you don&#39;t feel anything.  And then when it&#39;s over...your dick slides right off your crotch.  It&#39;s over, you were too late.<br />
<br />
Breathing heavily, and still feeling quite horny, you decide to take a look at yourself in the full length mirror on your bedroom door.  What you see stuns you.  For starters, you&#39;re quite tall.  At least 5&#39;10&quot;.  You&#39;ve probably outgrown your entire wardrobe in the course of a day.  Your breasts are massive, at least an F cup, but maybe even bigger?  &quot;Is it possible to grow more than 6 sizes?&quot; you think to yourself.  Your hips, while absurdly wide for the women of your old reality, are fairly normal for the women of this one.  Your ass, while again fairly big by the standard of your old world is normal for this one.  You have a beautiful and highly feminine face, none of your old androgyny left at all.  Your arms have gotten even thinner than they already were, but your thighs are quite thick now.  Storing fat for...your baby.  &quot;Oh shit that&#39;s right this means I&#39;m going to stay pregnant too...&quot; you think to yourself.  &quot;Well nothing left to do but clean up and tell Sam the bad news.&quot;  Fortunately, Sam had agreed that if the worst happened, he would stay a man and be your husband.  &quot;It&#39;s the least I can do, since this is mostly my fault&quot; he had said in his text before your meeting that morning.<br />
<br />
You go back to your trunk to get an old towel and wipe up your cum, but this time even crouching for leverage doesn&#39;t help, you&#39;re simply too weak to open it anymore.  &quot;I know the average woman in this world can only lift about 16kg, but this trunk lid can&#39;t be that heavy!&quot;  The trunk had been hand carved by your uncle out of a log, and the lid was a lot heavier than a normal wooden lid, but it couldn&#39;t be too heavy for you, even if you got extra screwed in the muscle department.  You must just be exhausted from the transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just make Sam do it when he gets here, it&#39;s his fault anyway...&quot; you sigh to yourself, thinking back to last night.  But this time, you don&#39;t remember his large breasts, you remember his toned abs, and the forceful thrusting.  Odd, it didn&#39;t excite you yesterday but now that you were a woman it was turning you on.  Heat built in your crotch, and before you knew it you were holding your old dick.  It was still rock hard.(human members calcified after falling off.)  In ancient times, powerful warlords would keep the dicks of his defeated enemies as trophies, and even in modern times some perverse women would hold on to theirs, using it as...well what you were going to use it as.<br />
Cupping a hand around your massive left breast and kneading it, you push your still slightly warm former member into your vagina, staring at yourself in the mirror.  You get that same feeling you were getting in your dick last night, but instead it was radiating out through your entire body.  &quot;If this is what sex as a woman feels like&quot;, you as as you hit your first climax, &quot;maybe this won&#39;t be so bad after all...&quot;</p>
