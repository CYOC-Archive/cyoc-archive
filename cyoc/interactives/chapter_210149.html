<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The moment her wings finished forming, Penny wanted nothing more than to try them out. Flexing them, and almost knocking stuff over, she grinned sheepishly as she realised they were too big to have fully unfolded indoors. Getting used to the new muscles that aloud her to control them, she took a moment to work out how to fold them closed, to partly open back up, and to make them twitch before she closed them and held them as close to her body as  she could. Fiddling with the straps on her top, she glanced toward the nearest window, and decided that what she wanted, and would probably be the best thing to do, was to be outside.<br />
<br />
Lisa forgotten for the moment, the fourteen year old girl tried to push the straps on her top back up as she headed for the kitchen. Finding the wings prevented her from pushing the spaghetti thin straps of her cami all the way back up, she decided it&#39;d be fine so long as the garment didn&#39;t slip down and leave her boobs exposed. Opening the back door, she stepped out of the house, down the porch steps and into the backyard. Unfurling her wings fully for the first time, she relished the feel of the air on the feathers as she experimented with the movement of the appendages, growing used to the muscles that she now had to use them. Starting to feel comfortable after a bit, she took an experimental flap, felt herself lift off the ground a few inches, drop back down, and trying again, this time jumping as she flapped, she rose a couple more inches the next time before she dropped back to the ground.<br />
<br />
Worried she might be unable to use the wings to fly, she thought, &quot;It&#39;d be stupid if I was given wings and I could use them for anything,&quot; as she tried squatting down and pushing herself up into a leap as she flapped, then taking a running start across the yard.<br />
<br />
Through trial and error, it took her about five to ten minutes before she grasped the principle idea of how to get herself airborne. Afterward, it was on to learning how to manipulate the use of wings to keep herself in the air. Almost crashing a number of times, including into a large tree in a neighbour&#39;s backyard, Penny eventually got the gist of what to do. Wanting to test her limits, she began to explore with drafts and currents and how many beats she needed versus what she needed to glide, as well as also forcing herself upward to see how high she could go, finding she was capable of going up several thousand feet before the cold and lack of oxygen began to bother her.<br />
<br />
When she grew tired of that, she turned to figuring how far and fast she was able to fly before she grew tired. Alternating between flapping and riding updrafts of warm air, she was amazed that she now had an internal sense that told her what direction she was going and where it was she&#39;d come from as below the picturesque landscape changed from housing developments to fields to forests to tree-covered valleys and mountains. Losing her cami at some point, she found herself embarrassed when she finally realised it and wanted to cover her exposed breasts. But asking herself, &quot;Why?&quot; as she flew low and landed in a somewhat clumsy manner in a silent glade, she found it didn&#39;t seem important that the two, pale, B cup mounds were bared for all to see. <br />
<br />
Her attention wavered and soon she lost interest in her worries about having her boobs exposed for any to see. Taking to wandering instead, she wondered where she was, as it was the farthest from home she&#39;d ever been. Had she known she&#39;d flown almost two states over, she&#39;d been surprised, but, oblivious to this fact, knowing which direction she needed to go when she finally headed back, understanding that she&#39;d have to eventually, Penny found herself saddened by the sudden realisation that, despite how much she enjoyed her wings, she couldn&#39;t keep them. Knowing having them would create too many issues, lead to way too many questions than what she wanted to deal with, she tried to think of ways she might be able to keep her beautiful wings, but found herself drawing a blank. Thinking of her best friend, she wondered how Lisa was doing with her change, and whether the two might be able to brainstorm a solution that would allow for her to keep the appendages that now extended from her shoulder joints.<br />
<br />
A half-hearted flap and the teenage girl considered for a split second what she saw was the truth of the matter if she or her friend couldn&#39;t find a resolution that she’d have to bid goodbye to her new additions before she put the matter from her mind. Returning to the glade, she took off into the air, deciding to enjoy the time she had in living her flying dreams.<br />
<br />
Hours ticked by and after some time, Penny decided she had no choice but to head back. Following the innate sense of direction that she now believed had been amplified within her when her wings had started to grow, she had no issue finding her way back to Lisa&#39;s place. Landing in the backyard, she tucked and folded her wings until the rested comfortably against her back. Taking a look at the two neighbouring houses, and seeing she hadn&#39;t been seen coming in for a landing, she headed for the house, noting as she did that the back door was still open. Stepping inside, she wrinkled her nose at overpowering stench and called out, &quot;Lisa?&quot;<br />
<br />
No answer came, and Penny wondered what the hell had happened whilst she was away. Heading toward the dining room, figuring the first thing she should do was transform herself back, she stopped. Seeing the empty table, her heart began to race as she wondered where Jeff&#39;s laptop had gone. Scooping up her button-up and pressing it to her breasts, she hurried from the room. Heading first for Lisa&#39;s room, then checking Tyler and Jeff&#39;s bedroom, the latter still reeking though a window was now open, she didn&#39;t bother to question who&#39;d opened it as she headed for the bathroom. Pounding on the door, she cried out, &quot;Lisa? Are you in there? What happened to the computer?&quot; and not waiting for an answer, she opened the door.<br />
<br />
Something raced out, and it took her a moment before it came to her that it was a rabbit. Fear creeping over her, Penny began to believe that something had gone wrong, that someone had stolen the laptop and the programme on it, but found that, if that was the case, it didn&#39;t explain the animal in the bathroom or where her friend was. Heading back to the main rooms of the house, and watching as the rabbit ran futility around the living room before it figured out how to leave, grasping as it did that the back door was still open before it streaked out towards freedom as fast as its legs would carry it, Penny had what she thought was a strange notion come to her as she watched the animal leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if that was Lisa?&quot; she asked herself, but then wondered why her friend would turn herself into a rabbit before it came to her that, maybe, whoever had taken Jeff&#39;s laptop might have done that to her as she headed for the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Uncertain if the critter she&#39;d seen had been her friend, but feeling that if it had been, she surely should try to catch the animal before it got too far away, Penny stopped in mid-step. A prickly sensation coming over her, she reached out and grasped the edge of the island countertop as the room began to swim and the tingling feeling spiked. Her pants and underwear dropping to expose her fully as she suddenly started to lose weight, she wondered, &quot;What is happening to me,&quot; before it came to her that someone must have used the programme on her as, unable to the lip of the counter anymore she dropped to the floor not with the sound of a flesh-covered body hitting linoleum, but rather a soft plop sound. Struggling to get up, believing the culprit of what was happening to her had to be nearby, she wanted to cry out, demand to know why they were doing this to her, but was horrified to discover she no longer had a mouth.<br />
<br />
Internal organs and bones vanished as a fluffy white substance appeared, and as Penny had a last bit of awareness of what was happening to her, her final thought before she drifted away into a state that was somewhere between sleep and a coma was, &quot;Oh, shit. I&#39;m becoming a plush.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fawn coloured fur sprouted over the transformed girl&#39;s body as her legs and feet became one piece. Her hands and arms following suit as her eyes turned into sapphire blue glass eyes and a tail pushed its way out from what used to be her tailbone. Within moments, it had finished its growth as the last thing to form was whiskers and her ears to become pointed and moved up onto the top of her head. The alteration lasting only minutes, where the fourteen year old girl had once been was a now a plush, two and half foot tall anthropomorphic siamese kitten with a rather surprised look on its face.<br />
<br />
A couple more minutes passed, and when it seemed the house was empty, the part way closed door to the kitchen closet opened. Poking her head out, the Kitsune peered first at the plush, then at the open back door. She had hated to transform either of the two, and planned to change them back, but she needed to remain undisturbed as she worked with the programme. Wondering how she was to turn the one who&#39;d run outside back, she settled on it probably wouldn&#39;t be a problem once she got around to it, and going to pick up the plush, which was nearly as big as her, she returned to the closet. Pulling the door part of the way closed, positioned the plush so it sat with its back against a wall, climbed back under the shelf, and turned her attention back to the Chronivac programme.</p>
