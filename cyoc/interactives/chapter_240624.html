<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After entering the house, Lisa tells Han to wait outside her door, while she gets changed, after the door closes behind her, Lisa pulls out her phone, opening Han’s file, grinning when she sees that his relationship status has changed from “single and searching” to “boyfriend of Lisa Davis”. Smiling to herself, happy that everything is working out as she had planned, Lisa closes Han’s file and opens her wardrobe, pulling out a blue jeans shorts and a white t-shirt, lying both on her bed, before taking out her phone and scanning the items, ‘I’m tired of wearing kid’s clothes,’ she thinks to herself, ‘a young lady like me needs something much more sexy and appealing’. The girl watches with a smile as the white shirt changes into a sexy lace top and the pant legs of the shorts shorten, the shorts becoming hot-pants.<br />
<br />
Lisa strips out of her clothes and frowns at the girly training bra and panties, without hesitation, she uses the app to change the training bra into a beautiful blue padded lace bra, and the panties into lace panties in the same blue color. The 10-year-old puts on the clothes and looks at herself in her mirror, smiling, ‘much better,’ she thinks to herself, ‘finally my clothes match my age, after all, I am not a kid! I am a big girl, big girls wear big girls clothes’.<br />
<br />
The 10-year-old grabs her black purse and opens the door of her room, “well, how do I look, baby,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Han’s eyes widen, “y-you look absolutely stunning,” he breaths.<br />
<br />
Lisa giggles, “thanks, so, where are we heading?”<br />
<br />
“I… I thought we could… head to the Zoo,” Han says, “we could have a picknick on the large lawn and enjoy all the beautiful animals”.<br />
<br />
Lisa smiles, “sounds good,” she says, “let’s get the picknick basket packed”.<br />
<br />
An hour later they arrive at the Zoo and after paying the entry fee, they find a nice spot under a tree to set up their picknick.<br />
<br />
Han looks around nervously, noticing all the eyes on them, and the looks on some people’s faces make him feel rather uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Lisa notices, “what’s the matter, hun,” she asks.<br />
<br />
“I… it’s just all those stares and mean expressions the majority of the people give me, as if I were some kind of child molester,” Han says.<br />
<br />
“Darling, you are NOT a child molester,” Lisa says, lying a hand on the teen’s leg, which causes Han to tense, “and I am not a child! I am a big girl, a young lady, old enough to have a relationship with whoever she wants, and I want YOU! We are a couple and no one will ever change that!”<br />
<br />
“B-but, Lisa,” Han says, “y-you are a child, y-you are only 10 and I am 16. I… I don’t know what I was thinking! I… I just don’t want to go to jail!”<br />
<br />
Lisa frowns, she really doesn’t want HER Han to suffer like this, thinking quickly, she pulls out her phone and opens Han’s file, and with one little adjustment, she causes Han to not care what other people think, smiling when she notices Han relax. To prevent anyone from taking HER Han away from her, she decides to use the reality alteration to make everyone find it weird that a 16-year-old and a 10-year-old have a romantic relationship, but wouldn’t really care about it, including Lisa’s parents.<br />
<br />
“Just let them think what they want, baby,” Lisa says, after confirming the changes, “all that is important is that WE love each other, we shouldn’t care nor worry what all those silly people think about us!”<br />
<br />
Han looks around, he then smiles, “yeah… I guess you are right,” he says, “if it really would be such a major issue, the police would have shown up by now”.<br />
<br />
Lisa smiles, “see? There is nothing for you or us to worry about,” she says, “so, let’s just enjoy our relationship and date!”<br />
<br />
Han chuckles, “yeah,” he says, lying on the blanket, his hands behind his head, “so, what animal in this Zoo is your favorite?”<br />
<br />
Lisa smiles, happy that her lover is finally relaxed, lying down herself she replies, “oh, I have many. I really like the monkeys, they are so funny, but I also really like the reptiles, I find them so fascinating. However, the cutest of all are the meerkats, what about you?”<br />
<br />
“I really love reptiles myself, especially lizards and snakes,” Han says, “I was born in the year of the snake, so I have a strong connection to reptiles,” he chuckles, “but, I also really like tigers, foxes, wolves”.<br />
<br />
Lisa smiles, “let’s say we were animals,” she says, “what animal do you think would I be?”<br />
<br />
Han turns his head, looking at the girl, “interesting question,” he says, “hm… I’d say: fox! You are smart and cunning, so… yeah… a fox would surely be the animal for you. What about me?”<br />
<br />
Lisa smiles, “that is exactly what I thought too,” she says, “as for you, I’d say a tiger, you are strong and powerful”.<br />
<br />
Han smiles, “a tiger? Yeah… I totally can see that,” he says, “though I’d rather be an anthro than a feral, you know, like Bugs Bunny”.<br />
<br />
“Me too,” Lisa says, ‘and we soon will be,’ she thinks to herself, grinning inwardly, ‘hehe… I wonder how my stupid brother Jeff will look like once I rebirth him!’<br />
<br />
Han chuckles, taking Lisa’s hand in his, “you’ll always be my vixen, no matter how you look,” he says.<br />
<br />
Lisa giggles, “and you’ll always be my handsome, strong, majestic tiger!”<br />
<br />
Han blushes, “okay, now you&#39;re just exaggerating,” he says.<br />
<br />
Lisa giggles, “maybe… just a little,” she says, ‘should I tell him about the program,’ she then thinks to herself, ‘nah… it’s more fun if he doesn’t know’.<br />
<br />
“I hope your parents accept me as your boyfriend,” Han then says.<br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t worry, they will,” Lisa says, ‘especially with the reality alteration I’ve done earlier, causing everyone on this planet to not care about my relationship with Han, all they’ll do is find it weird,’ she thinks to herself, ‘nothing and no one will come between me and my boyfriend and soon-to-be husband and father of my annoying brother. Hehe!’.<br />
<br />
Han smiles, “sorry… I’m a person who worries to much, sometimes about silly things”.<br />
<br />
Lisa smiles, “hey, it’s okay to worry, baby,” she says, turning onto her side, “but you really have nothing to worry about,” she then leans in, “if you want proof, then kiss me!”<br />
<br />
Han looks at Lisa, then at the passers by who continue to give him weird looks, he then looks back at Lisa, takes a deep breath and leans in, pressing his mouth against her’s.<br />
<br />
Lisa wraps her arm around Han and kisses him back, soon they are kissing deeply and passionately, both with their eyes closed.<br />
<br />
After a while, Lisa breaks the kiss, “how… how long have we been kissing,” Han asks, panting a little, fidgeting because his cock has erected, pressing against the inside of his jeans.<br />
<br />
“Oh, about 15 minutes,” Lisa says, grinning.<br />
<br />
Han’s eyes widen, “so long,” he asks in disbelief, looking around, but except from weird glances, no one seems to be bothered to much.<br />
<br />
Lisa nods, “if it were such a major issue of us being together, someone would have stepped in,” she says, “but no one has, so really, you have nothing to worry about”.<br />
<br />
Han finds himself relax and smiles, “I… I guess you are right,” he says, “I should stop worrying so much and just enjoy having the most beautiful and most stunning vixen in the whole universe as my girlfriend”.<br />
<br />
Lisa giggles, “there you have it,” she says, “my little handsome tiger!”<br />
<br />
Han smiles, “then what is stopping us from continuing,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Lisa grins, soon they are once again kissing passionately, their arms wrapped around each other’s body, stroking their respective partner, both moaning in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Han breaks the kiss, panting, as he looks at Lisa with love and lust in his eyes, “m-my place… or yours,” he asks in a husky whisper, giving the girl a crooked smile.</p>
