<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seated on his stately front porch Dr. Phil sat thinking of just how he was going to make his way in a teaming society filled with competetion. He was just a counrty doctor and not any kind of a business man at all! He had his uncle's old practice and most of the old clients were fast dying off. He needed something to spark his desire to be great and down it came to land on the grassy lawn before him.<br />
<br />
Sailing downward and landing with a dull thud the Tome of Possibility landed in his front lawn. Surprised he jumped up from where he was seated and eyed the thing which was still so warm the leather cover was casting off thin whisps of smoke.<br />
<br />
Stepping slowly from his front porch he walked toward the smoking object. As he got up to it he saw the thing was indeed an old book. The leather was scortched badly but kneeling down her poked over the cover with his trusty pocketed pencil.<br />
<br />
&quot;THE TOME of POSSIBILITY&quot; he read the title page of black india ink on a parchment thick page.<br />
<br />
Giving a quick look around he wondered if anyone else had seen the mircle happen? Seeing not a sole person around he took off his sweater and gripped the still warm book returning to the privacy of his porch.<br />
Setting the tome upon a coffee table he again seated himself into his rocker chair. A casting look for again anyone about, then he leaned forward and again opened the first page of this mircle thing.<br />
<br />
The glossary page was enough to warn him he was now the owner of a book written to harness dark powers. Flipping the pages slowly he was amazed at how well the book was written and with what ease the writing seemed to be easily understood by him. <br />
<br />
Demonic things were offered of raising deceased spirits and demons form the pit of hell. His old eyes peered over pages not wishing to mouth such horrid things less they come to pass there before him.<br />
<br />
Dr. Phil being s sound man of the medical field was not thinking of evil ways and things he could thrust upon unexpecting men, he was first of all a healer! What he saw there before him was this book made of mankind to be pawns in some wierd plan of domination. Who wrote the book was unknown to him but its evil use was without a doubt what others had found to be their downfall.<br />
<br />
Kerthunk, and yet another lousey golf ball rattled around his front porch. The neighbor kid Jonus was toying with his daddy's golf clubs and paying as usual not one bit of attention. Dr. Phil had quite the collection of hacked up golf balls in his garage, donations from the brat kid next door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey can I get my golf ball back mister Doctor, please?&quot; asked the kid.<br />
<br />
Jonus was maybe the one and only person on the entire planet which the good doctor hated. A large lumbering monster was this kid with pudgy gut and arms and legs boasting of too much pop and tons of pizza. A pitted face from sores of a high fat diet came searching for his maybe one and only golf ball.<br />
<br />
Dr. Phil ignored him at first and continued to page threw his new find. It was with the nasty kid coming closer that fate touched both the good doctor and Jonus.<br />
<br />
Not paying too much attention to his turning of the pages he gripped more than one page and opened the book to of all spots, &quot;Divine Casting&quot;.<br />
<br />
Seeing the black hand written words before him the Doctor began to actually mouth the words as Jonus came closer to the porch. The golf ball in his hand Dr. Phil was thinking of how much he hated Jonus and his acursed golf balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's it, can I have it back now?&quot; asked the brash and unmannered brat of a kid.<br />
<br />
The Doc looked up from his reading aloud the words and eyed first the ball and then the fat brat of a kid and said, &quot;Oh the silver tongue of one so brainless, your mother was undoubtedly raped by an evil beast!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tossing the golf ball to Jonus the kid caught it with both hands gripping it to his overly plump chest.<br />
<br />
As if the ball was searingly hot he fumbled it dropping the ball and standing there wide eyed and stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong now boy?&quot; exclaimed the angered doctor.<br />
<br />
Jonus stood there as if in some state of shock. &quot;I don't feel so good, I'm gon'a be sick!&quot; moaned Jonus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not here, go home and get sick, but not on my lawn you hear!&quot; yelled the Doc as Jonus turned slowly and walked toward home.<br />
<br />
Doctor Phil watched Jonus hobble homeward and with his hands spread over the open pages of the tome he said what was in his mind. &quot;Damned kid, he ain't no good for nothing but eating and getting fat! His mother must have been raped or just................. say what, no its the book, the book!&quot; <br />
<br />
The print in the book on the pages set open before the doctor were now glowing a red orange color and he could feel the heat coming from the book itself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God I was about to curse the kid and this book does control such power!&quot; shaking his head in disbelief he was able to think of such horrid thoughts the good doctor said yet, &quot;You are what you eat, Jonus I hope you keep that in mind!&quot; with that he slammed the book shut, and picking it up walked into his cottage home.</p>
