<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dashing away from the door as quickly and as quietly as he could, Paul darted into the hall bathroom just a few quick bounds away. He sucked in air sharply, and held his breath.<br />
<br />
At first, he worried about a failed orgasm hurting his balls again. But then a different thought crept into his head. What if his son saw him? What if Steve saw his father with his dick out, masterbating to the scene of him getting pounded by his brother? Would Steve be ashamed? Or aroused?<br />
<br />
This new thought had Paul&#39;s dick like diamonds again. Steve wouldn&#39;t be mad at him. Steve would want him.<br />
<br />
Paul moved his fingers again, slippery with his pre, they slid easily in and out of his cockhole. Paul imagined they belonged to his son. Paul imagined they weren&#39;t just his son&#39;s fingers getting him off.<br />
<br />
It was Steve&#39;s cock fucking his father&#39;s urethra.<br />
<br />
That thought was what finally did it, Paul was sent completely over the edge his massive swollen balls lurched up within his sack, preparing to unleash what would surely be a flood from his dick.<br />
<br />
Terrified of making too much noise, Paul - unthinking - swiftly jammed a third finger into his hole to hopefully stop it up.<br />
<br />
This was a mistake.<br />
<br />
Paul arched his back suddenly, dick spasming around this new invader stretching him too far, too suddenly, but it was too late. Paul couldn&#39;t stop himself from cumming into his hand. He leaned over the sink to avoid making a mess as his jizz spilling out of his overstuffed cock.<br />
<br />
Paul ached, his stretched out cockhole was beyond sore, sharp pain from his cock shot through his whole spasming body. And Paul loved it.<br />
<br />
Paul couldn&#39;t help but love the pain as the orgasmic experience of cramming his dick as full caused him to cum even harder than before, another new high so soon. He was tempted to try and fit his other finger and the rest of his hand in. He imagined himself reaching his whole hand into his urethra, fisting his cockhole, and then squeezing his balls from the inside while he further jacked himself off.<br />
<br />
This fantasy set him off again! His legs were shaking from the intensity of what he was feeling. The tearing sensation at the tip was a lot for him to process, but it was processed as pleasurable no matter how much it hurt. The stretching from within his dick, pulling on the muscles that made up that tender organ set all his nerves on fire. And it only made him cum more.<br />
<br />
This put Paul over the edge. He experienced what felt like a third consecutive orgasm, literally unheard of for Paul. And he knew. He knew what he wanted.<br />
<br />
This pleasure changed his views on everything all at once.<br />
<br />
He needed to get Henry to fuck him. His dick throbbed again as Paul imagined his asshole stretched wide around Henry&#39;s two feet of cock, the tip spearing him into his throat, cum filling him full to bursting.<br />
<br />
He wanted desperately to fuck Steve. To penetrate his elder son&#39;s adolescent pucker and feel the tight squeeze of his boy&#39;s ass on his enormous cock. He wanted Steve to fuck him. To make him suck his youthful dick and swallow down his underaged cum. Paul&#39;s fantasy shifted from him sucking his son&#39;s dick, to him pinned against a wall by the boy, him opening the tip of his dick for his son to slide his own penis into. He wanted Steven to squeeze his balls. He wanted for Steven to be cockfucking his own father. And in his erotic fantasy, Steve would get bigger and bigger till his was even larger than Paul in every way, and he would stretch Paul&#39;s holes out till they would never close again and we&#39;re only ever meant for being fucked by massive cocks like Henry&#39;s and Steve&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Paul stifled a scream, as the fantasy was so real it almost put him over the edge again. He was too spent to cum anymore, but his dick still spasmed in a dry orgasm that lasted for what felt like an eternity.<br />
<br />
Paul no longer cared if his wife was cheating on him. He no longer felt emasculated by her, or Henry, or anyone. The changes Henry was going through, and that he was putting them through, would allow him to become something better. Paul imagined himself being father and mother and lover to both his boys. And if his wife behaved, she might be welcome to join them.<br />
<br />
Paul knew what he needed to do now. He needed to get more of Henry&#39;s precious semen inside him.<br />
<br />
It was a few moments after he calmed down that Paul heard Steve creep out from his baby brother&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
Paul was unsure just how long he had sat there in the dark, but could feel a great deal of his own cum in the palm of his hand from where he had just ejaculated into himself, the tips of his fingers still stretching his dickhole as he breathed deeply to calm down.<br />
<br />
He slipped his fingers from his battered cock and pinched it closed with his other hand. He cupped his jizz slicked hand and brought his own cum up to his mouth to taste. It was awful. Nothing like Henry&#39;s superior cum, his own tasted sorta bland and almost fishy.<br />
<br />
Paul was going to dump it when he had an idea. Bringing his cum cupped in his hand back down to his cockhole, he used his offhand to gently pry his tip open and pour his cum back down into himself. Then pinching his dick closed again, Paul used his cum slicked hand to force his orgasm back down inside himself, feeling as what was left of his orgasm slid backwards in his urethra like a slimy lump before making it to the base, and feeling like it was absorbed by his prostate. Almost like the cum was absorbed back into his balls to be processed later.<br />
<br />
This was novel for Paul. He hadn&#39;t ever taken anything into himself in that way. It felt good. Gave him a sense of relief, like cumming in reverse.<br />
<br />
Paul took stock of himself and moved to go take care of Henry, still needing to feed the boy.</p>
