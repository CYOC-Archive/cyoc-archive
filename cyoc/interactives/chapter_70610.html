<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Malcolm handed the note off to the first boy he found, eager to start his new life. Frank Davis took his seat after having found the book he was looking for, and quickly noticed the sheet of paper that was now laying across his notebook. He took a glance at it, looking it over real quick.<br />
<br />
Hey There,<br />
<br />
If you want to change your life, then play this little game for fun. I know I had fun! Signed your new friend.<br />
<br />
Frank cracked an eyebrow and looked over the questions, but decided that he was game for this. It looked to be nothing more than a questionnaire describing what his dream girl would be. And he certainly had a strong idea of that...<br />
<br />
&quot;1. If you were a girl, would your handwriting be neat?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank wrote &quot;My handwriting would be neat and very girly.&quot; He did not notice the script becoming much more elaborate even as he wrote the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;2. If you were a girl, would you like pink?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank nodded his head. &quot;Yes. It is easily my favorite color.&quot; The ink in his pen suddenly changed from a simple blue to a light pink.<br />
<br />
&quot;3. If you were a girl, would your hair be straight or curly?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, Frank had a clear vision of what his dream girl looked like, so he wrote down &quot;Straight, and very very soft to touch.&quot; He ran a hand through his silken bangs and brushed a stray strand of hair that had fallen into his vision.<br />
<br />
&quot;4. If you were a girl, what would your favorite color be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank had to laugh, although it was more of a giggle than a laugh. He wrote &quot;I already said pink was my favorite color, but I like different shades of lavender's and purples too.&quot; He glanced over to his backpack, admiring the light pastel color his mom had chosen for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;5. If you were a girl, what color would your hair be and how would you wear it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank did think for a few moments about how his dream girl would wear her hair, but finally decided &quot;I have long gorgeous light blonde hair that requires little maintenance. Since if I ever wore it all the way down it would hang to my knees, I usually have it in a ponytail or pigtails.&quot; Frank nodded, readjusting the scrunchie that held his long ponytail in place. Long hair like his was difficult to take care of normally, but he was fortunate that his hair was immaculate no matter what he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;6. If you were a girl, what skin color would you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank wrote &quot;I have a fair complexion overall, but in the summertime I get a dark rich tan.&quot; Unbeknownst to him, his skin darkened faintly before settling into its light tan color, it's dark richness a few tanning sessions away. <br />
<br />
&quot;7. If you were a girl, would you play sports?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank nodded his head again, &quot;I am incredibly athletic, and work out all the time, but I don't play any sports.&quot; His body became much more lean and muscular in a matter of moments. <br />
<br />
&quot;8. If you were a girl, would you wear a skirt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Frank said to himself as he wrote it. &quot;I always wear skirts.&quot; He barely noticed the draft that encompassed his now bare legs as his jeans transformed into a plaid miniskirt that ended about halfway down his now well-toned thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;9. If you were a girl, would you wear jewelry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Frank replied in his neatly feminine script, &quot;I would always have earrings on, and a ladies watch, along with a gold chain around my neck.&quot; Said items quickly appeared out of thin air, and Frank pressed on none the wiser.<br />
<br />
&quot;10. If you were a girl, what color eyes would you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A dark green,&quot; Frank wrote, blinking several times as his irises changed. He chalked it up to something in his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;11. If you were a girl, would you wear makeup?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do,&quot; Frank wrote down, giggling even more, &quot;I always wear just the right amount of makeup to make my naturally beautiful face.&quot; Frank didn't realize that he now possessed a very beautiful, very female face, complete with ruby red lips and a small, petite nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;12. If you were a girl, what size of breasts would you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now we're talking, Frank's male mind thought to itself in its quiet, ever shrinking existence. He wrote &quot;My breasts are huge, an H-Cup to be exact.&quot; By magic, Frank didn't notice as spheres of flesh began to exponentially grow across his now thinner, feminine chest. They continued to grow, expanding ever moreso until they filled out across his entire chest, nearly resting comfortably in his lap. Frank loved his large breasts, despite the hassle that they caused. Despite his athletic ability, their overtly large size made running nearly impossible, but he didn't care. If anything, he'd want them to be bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;13. If you were a girl, what kind of clothes would you wear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd wear very revealing clothes that show off my assets.&quot; Even as he wrote this, Frank's T-shirt morphed into a thin tank top that was straining to hold in his massive breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;14. If you were a girl, would you wear high heels?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, in fact I'd wear five inch heels all the time except when I'm working out.&quot; Frank's tennis shoes morphed into black stilletto heels as his feet shrank to match.<br />
<br />
&quot;15. If you were a girl, would you shave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My body is naturally hairless except for my head and my eyebrows and thin pubic hair, so there's no need.&quot; All at once the hair on his arms and legs vanished and the five o'clock shadow that marred his feminine face disappeared shortly thereafter.<br />
<br />
&quot;16. If you were a girl, what would your intelligence be on a scale of 1 to 10?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb either, probably a 7.&quot; Franks IQ remained virtually unchanged, as he remained oblivious to the changes around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;17. If you were a girl, how would you sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a sexy contralto voice.&quot; Frank smiled as he remembered how deep his voice could actually go, some people mistook him for a guy until they took one look at his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;18. If you were a girl, would you wear pads or tampons?&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting pregnant was something that Frank never took into account for his fantasy girl. But seeing as how Frank was mostly gone by now, he simply wrote &quot;Tampons.&quot; At that, Frank's penis folded up into nothing, becoming a female slit in a matter of moments as a tampon magically appeared inside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;19. If you were a girl, how sensitive would you be, sexually speaking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very sensitive,&quot; Frank replied, feeling a wave of pleasure coursing through her body. &quot;Especially around my pussy and my nipples.&quot; Her nipples became diamond hard, and her newly gained pussy began to grow moist in anticipation of something.<br />
<br />
&quot;20. If you were a girl, would you be attracted to guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I am silly,&quot; she wrote, &quot;I've had sex with lots of guys, but especially my boyfriend Drew, captain of the football team.&quot; She sighed as she thought of Drew and his ten inch cock. She aimed to finish the survey quickly, although the questions seemed pretty obvious to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;21. If you were a girl, what would your age, height, and weight without clothes be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm 17...standing just at 5'5&quot; and weigh just over 130 pounds because of my huge boobs.&quot; Her body shrunk to match her new stature, making her already huge breasts appear to be even larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;22. If you were a girl, what would your name be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Laney Davis,&quot; she wrote, her new identity filtering into the minds of all those around her. The questions suddenly vanished off the survey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for playing. If you want to lead a happy life, pass this on to the next person...boy or girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laney smiled and folded up the piece of paper, tossing it in a stray binder she had found sitting next to her, as she grabbed her pink backpack and purse and nearly skipped off to the football field where Drew would be waiting to take her home. Maybe then they could have fun.<br />
<br />
The owner of said binder paid it no mind until they got home to do homework. Once there...they found...</p>
