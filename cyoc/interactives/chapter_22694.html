<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charles was split over whether he should stick to the plan or help you out.  But what he doesn't realize is that while you were telling him what had happened to you, you had been using a pocket knife which had been hanging out of your pocket to loosen the ropes.  When they finally came loose, you used the fact that Charles was still distracted to knock him on the side of his head and untie your feet.<br />
  Quickly making your way out of there, you have to hide as the others come back.  They don't notice you and walk in through the door. You make a dash for it, knowing that would see Charles lying on the floor.<br />
  You make it to the gate and realize that there are more standing outside.  you turn and dash avoiding capture as you make it to safety, at least for the time being.<br />
  You wait expecting one of them to show up at any time, as you hide in the shadows.  You carefully ease away, maintaining silence and shadow.  You hear a voice from nearby.<br />
  &quot;He's not on the trail, he must have gotten away.&quot; A man said.<br />
  You could barely make out a static sounding voice telling him to keep looking.<br />
  You thought it was odd that people from your school, would be so well coordinated as to have high powered walkie-talkies, flashlights and a leader who maintained firm control over the others, or at least seemed to when they talked over the walkie-talkies.  You thought it might have been Charles but even ignoring him, you knew he wasn't leader material.  In fact, you knew that no one you had seen up to that point could lead or for that matter even try to lead.<br />
  You crept into a ditch similar to the one you had hid in from Jerome and waited for the man to get close.  When he did, you jumped out at him and put him in a full-nelson.<br />
  He flipped you before you could really get a secure grip on him, but you just rolled out of it, over 3 years of karate had aided in this.  You blocked his punch and quickly struck out at his ribs.  You missed your target, glancing off to the side, but kept your cool.  He sneaked a punch into the side of your head but you didn't back down.  You blocked his next attack and got him with a square shot to the floating ribs.  He staggered backwards a little and taking the advantage, You hit him hard on the other side of his body.  He was slumped over from pain as the last hit had broken his ribs.<br />
  Grabbing a hold of him again this time making sure that he couldn't escape, you waited until he calmed down. <br />
  &quot;What are you here for?&quot;  You ask him.<br />
  &quot;I don't know what you're talking about.&quot;  He replied wincing a little as he said it.<br />
  You press into his ribs, making him scream out in pain and try again.<br />
  &quot;Look I know you guys are out here for more than just revenge, now tell me what it is before I have to break your arm.&quot;  You demand fiercely, making sure not to flinch.<br />
  &quot;Look, I don't have a clue about what you're talking about.&quot;<br />
  You let him go for a second to get into a good arm break position, you don't feel much reason to prevent him from trying something at this point, seeing how bad he's gripping his right ribs.  But as you try to readjust he makes one last attempt to get away, catching you off-guard as an elbow hits you, just south of your solarplexis and you have to recover quickly to keep him from getting away.  You put him back into a arm-break position, after kicking him in the back of the knee, causing him to fall down.<br />
  &quot;Last chance to save your arm.&quot;<br />
  &quot;FUCK YOU!&quot;  He screamed back.<br />
  There was a sharp cracking sound as he screamed in pain his left arm limp by his side.<br />
  He gripped it with his other arm and you walked around him.  He tried to punch you but he was so slow getting his good arm up now from the pain, you easily read his movements and punched him square in the nose.  He staggered a little, as much from the pain in his ribs as the last punch, but maintained his balance.  His nose was bleeding pretty badly but you knew it wasn't broken, you had taking care in not breaking it, so that you could save it for later if necessary.<br />
  &quot;Are you going to cooperate or do I have to break something else?&quot;<br />
  He remained silent, but this time instead of breaking his arm you take out his knee figuring that it would be best to take out his ACL so he couldn't come back, that is if he ever got the chance to anyways.  You propped him up on a branch by his bad arm making him scream out in pain yet again.<br />
  You go through the same routine, but this time he gives in.<br />
  He tells you of the plan to turn the whole world into latinoes and that the gays and blacks were only there as a distraction and didn't even know what was going on.<br />
  He told you of a machine that would change them on contact with the gaseous formula that it puts out and how they planned to start that night.<br />
  You take him down from the branch much to his relief and leave him there for his buddies to find since you need to make a quick escape and can't afford to have him slowing you down.<br />
  You intentially take off in one direction and then once your far enough away you cut back the other way.<br />
  You weren't in the clear yet and there were now more guys in the woods looking for you.</p>
