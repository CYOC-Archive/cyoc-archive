<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stephen walked over to the door and saw Liam his best friend. <br />
Liam was a pale red haired ginger who was only slightly taller than Stephen who had freckles for his face and electric blue eyes. He had been his best friend for years uo until he couldn&#39;t even remember how there friendship started. Liam looked puzzled to Stephen.<br />
&quot; your not Stephen.&quot; He declared&quot; are you a friend of his dad&#39;s perhaps? If so I need to talk to Stephen?&quot; Liam said in a fast paced tone which made it hard to understand.<br />
&quot; yeah you can talk to him come on inside bud he will be out of his room in a minute just take a seat.&quot; Stephen suggested<br />
Liam after a nineteen of conceding walked in though the doorway. He took a seat on the couch and waited patiently. <br />
&quot; so do you need anything to eat or drink? I&#39;ll go get us some food while we wait. &quot; Stephen declared without accepting an answer and ran to get the chrovonic.<br />
Liam would never understand if he didn&#39;t see proof. Stephen quickly typed in a few buttons and sent a transformation into the living room from the other side of the house. Stephen returned with a plate of popcorn and a soda for Liam. Liam disregarded the snacks and just crossed his legs and started st the ceiling. <br />
Stephen was about to say something to break the skyward silence but Liam beet him to it.<br />
&quot; If you are a friend of Stephen&#39;s Dad. Where is Stephen&#39;s Dad? Liam asked<br />
Stephen takes his memory of his fathers daily routines. It was getting hard to remember his last life. <br />
&quot; his-we Dad is at thee um office?&quot; Stephen answered uncertainly.<br />
&quot; But his father Dosent work on Saturdays and he is a personal trainer he Dosent work at an office &quot; Liam corrected <br />
Stepehn was relieved to see the transformation was taking effect. Liam&#39;s hair was darkening and getting thicker too. His freckles were vanishing to as well as his pale skin color.<br />
&quot; He had to go and brink back some papers to ah work on a um project for a um new workout routine.&quot; Stephen lied hoping it would satisfy Liam. He only needed to buy a few more moments for himself so that then Liam would understand.  He was getting closer Liam&#39;s red fiery hair had turned into a shade of dirt brown and and still getting darker and thicker. His eyebrows were more bushy and black. Along with the hair growing along the rest of his body. Muscles were defining themselves along his darker arms and legs. His small child shift was being stretched. Stephen. Could hear the seems snapping.<br />
&quot; where is Liam? Is he using the bathroom?&quot; Liam pestered.<br />
&quot; I&#39;ll go check you stay here &quot; Stephen walked out of the living room and knocked on the bathroom door knowing fully that there would be no answer. He walked back to the living room to find a different Liam. A PART from a few strips of dark brown hair Liam&#39;s hair was coal black like his stubble on his newly matured face. Liam didn&#39;t seem to notice as he lightly scratched it. His muscles were still forming. It had already ripped his shirt and shorts and Spider-Man underwear. Liam sat naked staring at the ceiling. But raised his hands in question as if to ask &quot; where is Stephen&quot; he was going to probably ask that exact question but it was at that time Liam noticed his new hairy arms and new skin tone. He was shocked in fear and uncertainty. He started screaming and shouting trying to comprehend what had happned. But telepathicly Stephen told Liam to shut up. Liam still naked walked over to Stephen who now was at his height of 6&quot;3 and hugged him around the waist. Liam looked up to him a few tears coming from his eyes. Stephen got to witness the last part of the transformation he watched as his eyes shed there. Lie color and turned an a dark brown color. Stephen told him it was fine and that he was shocked at first but no he loves it. Stephen the showed Liam how to jack off. But then ordered Liam to slurp up the cum on his hairy chest. Liam do as he was told and tried masturbating him self. He took a little while but soon a spray of seed shot out and some landed right in his mouth. Stephen then fought Liam how he should properly suck Stephen&#39;s dick and how to pleasure Stephen. Liam was going to be Stephen&#39;s little butch pretty soon. He tore Liam a new sized ass hole with his newly sized dick thanks to the chrovonic. Stephen could now fit a wine bottle up Liam&#39;s ass. He then fisted Liam till Liam passed out of exhaustion.  When Lila awoke after his nap Stephen took a picture of them both for his wallpaper. <br />
