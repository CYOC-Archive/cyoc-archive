<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In an upscale swanky three-level modern mansion lived a wealthy family called the Fletchers. In this family, you had Mr. Fletcher, the stereotypical white-collar CEO of some heartless business, Mrs. Fletcher, his not exactly &quot;loving&quot; wife, only tied to him by their unfortunate pre-nup, and their three kids, Mindy Anne Fletcher, Robin Greggory Fletcher, and Julie Mae Fletcher. Mindy tended to keep to herself, not truly getting involved in matters around the house, the famly, or even town. robin was slightly more active, and currently in line for Valedictorian of his graduating class. And then, there was Julie.<br />
<br />
Oh, everybody knew Julie. The 29-year-old slut was infamous around town. If that was for good or for bad, nobody really knew. The dumb bimbo was over 6 feet tall, with blonde curly hair, a single &quot;rebellious&quot; pink streak, huge tits and an unreal ass to match. Each and every morning, She&#39;d post an annoying selfie or status on her Twitter, usually half-naked in most of them. Then, she&#39;d go to her parents and get more money from them, wether that was from politeness, begging, or outright theft, After eating a large (and I mean LARGE) breakfast, she&#39;d head out with her also-rich boyfriend, where they&#39;d spend the day blowing his money mainly on her, getting her all new clothes, going to the movies, and jsut giving her anything and everything she wanted in life, including however much food she could stuff herself with. And it never mattered how much food she ate or how much fat she would have gained. A quick, epensive trip to Doctor Lookgood, and she was thinner than before. And, to top matters off, nobody questioned it. They all supported it.<br />
<br />
Except for one guy: Robin.<br />
<br />
You see, Julie was the Fletchers&#39; only legitimate daughter. Robin was the result of Mrs. Fletcher&#39;s affair with a mexican coffee barista, and Mindy was Mr. Fletcher&#39;s child with an unknown mother, but presumably from one of his many affairs. Since neither Robin nor Mindy were the child of both adult Fletchers, they got the shaft in terms of love, and that love got funneled straight into Julie, only making her even prissier and more spoiled.<br />
<br />
Mindy, the quiet girl, found it best to ignore this fact, as long as she got clothed and fed regularly. Robin, of course, did not. He loathed his older half-sister. He absolutely despised how Julie could go from one big fuck-up to another, with absolutely no punishment. One time, she crashed two lambos into the pool in one day, and the Fletcher Couple just bought her three more. Another time, Julie stole $50k and went to Vegas, blowing every cent of it. The Fletcher Couple had to fly out and pick her up, but were more relieved that she wasn&#39;t dead rather than her blowing two months salary in a weekend. Point is, Julie had grown up knowing no hardships, only wealth. No depression, only reward. She wasn&#39;t punished for slipping up. She wasn&#39;t yelled at just for existing. She was praised for not dying on them. And Robin had a plan to change that.<br />
<br />
Robin was trying to live with Julie the same way Mindy did. He tried pretending Julie wasn&#39;t a repulsive piece of shit. But that all changed when Julie, of all people, had the audacity to call Robin fat. JULIE, the person who would nearly double her weight in a weekend, alone, was calling Robin fat. And then, she followed it up by telling him to hit the gym. Again, this was all coming from Julie, the girl who literlly paid people to make sure she wasn&#39;t an immobile whate by 30. That was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. That was what made Robin snap. And that was what caused his plan to be set in motion.<br />
<br />
His first target: Her gluttony. Robin would watch as Julie ate an entire day&#39;s worth of food in a single meal, fatten up like a sausage, then one car trip later, be back to her skinny, rude self. Robin had to stop this from occuring. His initial idea was to get rid of this &quot;Doctor Lookgood&quot;, whoever he was. Of course, a poorly secured computer and a decent impression of Robin&#39;s dad allowed him to not only find the surgeon Julie used so often, but also to buy the company from him and send an e-mail out to him and every other plastic surgeon in the state that he was &quot;Trying to teach his daughter a lesson&quot;.<br />
<br />
The carnage of what he did played out the following weekend.<br />
<br />
The family was enjoying a relatively uneasy game night when Julie burst out of her bedroom door, dressed in clothes that, by now, have gotten wildly tight on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;My life is over! She screamed, collapsing onto the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong, babycakes?&quot; Mrs. Fletcher asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have been calling every plastic surgeon in the state, and none of them will take me for lipo!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why not?&quot; Mr. Fletcher asked in between turns.<br />
<br />
&quot;They wouldn&#39;t fucking tell me!&quot; She screamed. &quot;Now I&#39;m stuck like a cow until we find a new company.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, for now, this might be a good time to talk about alternatives...&quot; Mrs. Fletcher trailed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Like, diet and exercise? Yeah, that&#39;s not happening.&quot; Julie said, heading back to her room in disgust. I&#39;ll just book a huge appointment next time someone&#39;s available.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, day one ended.<br />
<br />
The next day was rather eventful as well. For one thing, she didn&#39;t even think about changing her habits. She continued with her massive breakfast, though she found herself enjoying it slightly more today. Then, she headed out with Andre, her boyfriend. As they drove out in his Tesla, Andre couldn&#39;t stop commenting on Julie&#39;s plumped frame.<br />
<br />
Once Mr. Fletcher left soon aferwards for work, Mrs. Fletcher leaving for &quot;Private Reasons, and Mindy heading off to school, Robin had the whole mansion to himself.Normally, he&#39;d play some forbidden video games, or just dick around before he left for work, but today, he had business to attend. Using one of his dad&#39;s phone lines, he called the head chef and told him too increase the daily shopping by about a couple thousand dollars, making meals effectively larger. He planned on doing this more when Julie was geting to comfortable with her portions, but for now, it was doing good. He just had to make sure his parents didn&#39;t find out.<br />
<br />
Finally, he decided to plant a few subliminal reminders for Julie. He went down to the local shop and picked up an issue of &quot;Plus&quot;, a plus-size model catalogue, Slapping a fake mail logo onto it, he placed than into Julie&#39;s personal mailbox. Next, he bought a ton of empty fast food wrappers, which he&#39;d slowly toss into Julie&#39;s room, making her think she&#39;s been eating more fatty foods, and as such, program her to eat more in general. Finally, and probably the most cutthroat, he went out and bought an entirely new wardrobe for Julie, exactly like her old ones, but a few sizes larger than she&#39;d need at her fattest. He planned on doing this whenever Julie&#39;s clothes got tight, making her think she isn&#39;t getting as big as she thought she was. Then, when she was at her fattest, he&#39;d place all the original clothes back, which would be just one part in her ultimate humiliation.<br />
<br />
In retrospect, he could have just yelled at Julie, or complained to his mom, his actual parent. They would have been cheaper, simpler , and faster. But he was way past that idea. For now, he had to wait for Julie to get home to enact his plan in full.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, when Julie (and Andre) got home that night, they threw an unfortunte monkey wrench into his plan. Simply put: neither looked at all phased by her weight gain.<br />
<br />
Julie and Andre were whispering to each other, their voices almost indescipherable, but Robin caught the words &quot;piggy&quot; and &quot;chubby&quot; a lot. They headed up to Julie&#39;s bedroom, Andre already stripping her small shirt off as they prepped for chubby sex together.<br />
<br />
The sounds that came after were horrendous. Even with 10 other people home, Julie and Andre didn&#39;t even try to stay quiet during sex. Andre&#39;s lustful cries about her &quot;huge cow tits&quot; and her &quot;Massive fuckable ass&quot; permeated through the walls and floors, making a very uncomfortable night for all. It didnt take a genius to figure that Andre was some kind of chubby chaser.<br />
<br />
Robin silently cursed himself to sleep that night. He would have to change up his plan to account for this new variable. Hopefully sleep would help him.</p>
