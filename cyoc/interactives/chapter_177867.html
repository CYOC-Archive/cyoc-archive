<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While setting his phone back down as he went back to his computer is when he got an idea from it that he quickly searched the site for what he was looking for, unaware Steve&#39;s human life was no longer his own any more. looking at his computer more that there were things like piercing, a butt plug to go up his scalely hind ass, even a dildo to play around with when he already had his very own cock now to worry about as he clicked on something by accident. after he did, Steve was back into his own clothes that there was even a hole for his newly formed reptilian tail for it.<br />
<br />
feeling his arms is when Steve jumped off the chair while looking and examining his clothing that he was now wearing. &quot;What the? This is getting worse! I have to fix this.&quot;<br />
<br />
sitting back down that Steve was soon after sitting right on your tail, but he didn&#39;t care about it for his tail had slipped into the position between his legs. still looking for away to change his life back around that he soon found something about translation. &quot;what dose. . . translate &quot;reptil&quot;? what&#39;s translate &quot;reptil&quot;? maybe to translate this site into English.&quot;<br />
<br />
tapping it that Steve was unaware again on what was happening for his eyes sparked white. soon the sparks faded for his eyes as he wondered if it did anything at all, but when he took a quick glimpse of his window from his room that he quickly looked back to his computer while blushing red from the site of his window for he now seemed to be loving what was beyon the doors even more. &quot;am I sspeaking in reptil?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;but I don&#39;t know reptil! yet i&#39;m sspeaking it, yess?&quot; he said to himself while testing to see if he was actually speaking the language that he had been hissing when it came to the s sound in his sentence, and only the s sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I only know English!&quot; he argued to himself while feeling frustrated about it. looking around his room that he spotted his mirror as he wondered how to say what he was looking at in English, yet what came out was &quot;reflection&quot; with a bit of confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;no that&#39;ss not right.&quot; Steve said while looking back at his computer, though he did thought he looked awkward with the way he was dressed in his clothing. still looking around with his eyes now that a strange thought came to be while fearing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t remember!&quot; he said. looking around his room that he thought of giving this reptil language a try as he tried it out with the mirror first.<br />
<br />
&quot;mirror. bed. computer. door. top. lizard-mam.&quot; he said as this confirms that he was speaking in areptil language.<br />
<br />
he slapped his legs with scaled hands a couple of times in denial, but it only put shocks of erection into his thighs as his dick was showing a bit of a bulging grip in his pants. &quot;No! No...no...no! I am not a lizard-man! I am human! and thiss web ssite had better fix thiss right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
scrolling through the page he was at that he soon clicked it. once done as he jumped a bit, his clothes were changed into a tuxedo outfit people wear at work. &quot;an outfit?&quot;<br />
<br />
he examined what he was wearing, while feeling anger at himself for trying this website. &quot;really?! ga, What can be worse then this? I totally look like a business man.&quot;<br />
<br />
his second attempt as he goes for it change his outfit into a black, latex, speedo swimming shorts. if Steve wasn&#39;t shock about this before, he sure was now as he almost literately let out a scream when he jumped. &quot;Ohhhhhhhh, no, no, no..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;thiss iss really bad! I&#39;ve got to fix this!&quot; he said while figuring out on what to do with this that like always, the third times was the charm as he was now wearing a heavy metal rock band outfit with black leather jeans, a leather jacket, it even came with an electric guitar hooked to a cord on your back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thiss iss better. It&#39;ss a step closer in the right direction...&quot; Steve said as he toyed with his new outfit a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;but i&#39;m sstill not human!&quot; to some that they would be happy about the outfit and walk away, but not him as he clicked yet one more time to be in a skintight rubber space suit most aline explorers wear with a strap bands on his wrist. The only areas that the suit didn&#39;t cover were his three toe feet, his snake like head, his three claw hands, even his tail. now he was getting annoyed by this strange outfit change that was going on here.<br />
<br />
&quot;ga, Not thiss again?!&quot; Steve said. frustrated even more that he got off his chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;At thiss rate, i&#39;ll end up dressed like ssome cosplay character next.&quot; sighing with not taking this anymore that he sits back down on his chair, this time to move his tail out of the way. unaware for him that this would be his last time to work on this in his room, while finding his way out of this trouble time again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What other choicess do I have on this ssite?&quot; he said while scrolling through  the webpage. soon though, his reptilian eyes light up with hope when something caught his attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;ss thiss? Upgrade your temporary membership to a FULL lifetime membership...&quot; he said while reading it out loud for it was about Terms and Conditions. &quot;...to enjoy all the benefitss of thiss ssite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ss it!&quot; he said while sounding happy about something. &quot;Once I have full membership that I can undo all of thiss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;TERMSS. bla..bla..bla..bla.&quot; reading the terms while skipping a bunch of paragraphs on the page that when it came up on do you agree to these terms is where you were hoping it will accept and help you undo what you did as you also hope it would be able turn you human again.<br />
<br />
&quot;do I agree? yess...pleace.&quot; was all you said for you quickly pressed the enter key, but as you did this is when you were blinded a bright light from the screen that you quickly covered your eyes from it while feeling a strange pull.<br />
<br />
the light was so bright now that it was like it was pulling you into the screen as you black out from the computer screen. he  suddenly found himself somewhere in a strange tech room. He was basically out cold from this experience, but at least he was on a somewhat comfortable bed for it was nice and warm that he shortly soon started to stir out of his sleep.<br />
<br />
Once up, Steve felt like he was getting hit by something hard on the head as his vision was soon clear enough to see around. seeing as Steve was waking up in a strange new room that he felt like he was in star trek, no, the twilight zone. It seemed to be a four wall room with lights coming out of a steel looking ceiling while there was carpeting on the floor area he&#39;s in that the walls of the room didn&#39;t seem right for his door was metal as it slids open, instead of opening it manually. what really flip him off however was his window for stars were flying by in space that thankfully Steve was on a fold in type of bed with a pillow and some blankets as the comforter matt was strapped on the bed to fold up to lay your back on while the wall of his window was over the other end of his room.<br />
<br />
Wait... why was there stars flying by his room? Steve was starting to freak out about this as panic started to build up.<br />
<br />
&quot;ah..., Damn! what happened?... Wait, what’ss going on here? Oh sshit! where am I? what am I doing here? I need to get out of...&quot; as he was saying this that he quickly spotted the metal door fram while the bed folded itself up on its oun ran for it to be let out, but was startled for a minute when it slide open for him and rushed out to find himself in a somewhat corridor hallway with more doors like his own he want through.<br />
<br />
wondering as to how he got in a place like this that his glimpse caught his retraction from the wall of white steel plates as he was still a lizard-man, wearing a skintight rubber from before. Steve Eventually did find something was wrong here as he noticed some other path that leads to the control station. While walking up to some of the control panels here and there that a chair was sitting in the middle of the room for it would seem he&#39;s the only one here for there no others. He was alone when he decided to look around what appears to be a spacecraft that before reentering the control room, he collapsed to his knees in defeat and suffering.<br />
<br />
&quot;well, it&#39;ss official. not even My own family would recognize me now. not even they would know that thiss iss really now, but who caress about that right now?! Still though, Dose enyone else out there even know it&#39;s really me? if so, then who&#39;s life did I change with?&quot; Steve said to himself as he looked up to the nice more lights as it felt so warm and good to his skin, like it was the sun shining so bright on his reptilian body.<br />
<br />
thoughts flooded him as to who he was called now while also thinking about home. if he was here in this anthro lizard body, then who was in his? If he&#39;ll ever get back home, to earth. these, and more were popping up in his head when he thought if someone was calling out for him.<br />
<br />
as a drone voice was talking &quot;reptil&quot; from somewhere, all he knew was that his old life was over for this was his new life now. he was basically reincarnated into a lizard-man to start a new life in space, while remembering his old life style. what to do next?</p>
