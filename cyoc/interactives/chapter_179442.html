<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake quickly pulled his work shirt back on, and slithered, belly low to the ground into the bathroom. He raised himself up, practically to the tip of his tail to wash his face and comb his hair.<br />
<br />
Kelly slithered off the bed and got herself dressed. As she did, she checked her body over for more changes. Of course, there was her tongue. It fit easily into her mouth, luckily. She flexed the muscles and stretched it out. She was shocked to realize it stretched nearly six inches past her lips, tapering to a thin fork at the end. She sucked it back into her mouth. As she did, Kelly reflexively pressed it to the top of her mouth.<br />
<br />
A world of smell exploded into her brain. Crystal clear, she could smell everything in the room. Sweat, Jake’s feminine juices from his orgasm, her much more prevalent scent from her own big squirt ‘Shit, that’s turning me on again,’ the soap Jake was washing his face with. Everything.<br />
<br />
Kelly took a deep, calming breath, shelving that for now as she got her bra properly clasped over her perky B-cups. Her eyes strayed down her flat belly, the swell of her hips (yes, she still had hips), and the scaly contours of her tight, round ass. ‘Damn, I’m hot’ she thought as her nipples hardened a little. She was a bit tempted to go back in and see if she can find her relocated clit again.<br />
<br />
But that would sadly have to wait. She settled her weight on her longer tail, and started slithering towards the door. With her new length, she was able to stay much more upright. She smiled, wondering how many more changes were in store.<br />
<br />
In the bathroom, Jake quickly washed Kelly’s love juice off his face. And got his sweaty hair looking passable. He opened his mouth wide (maybe a little wider than normal) and looked at his tongue. Fully retracted, it didn’t actually look out of place. It could easily pass for normal as long as he didn’t stick it out at anyone.<br />
<br />
He nodded in the mirror, lowered himself to the ground and slithered out of the bathroom. When he got out of the bathroom, Kelly was already gone. “Honey, bathroom’s free if you need it!”<br />
<br />
“It’s fine!” Kelly called back from her office. “I’ve got a hairbrush in here, and we don’t have any video calls scheduled today!”<br />
<br />
“Alright!” Shit. It was 1:01. Jake slithered as quickly as he could around the corners to get into his office. Hoisting himself up into his chair with his short, stubby tail was tricky, but he managed to get up there. He settled in, feeling surprisingly normal once he was seated. Jake finally logged into the computer at 1:02. A little late, but, he breathed a sigh of relief, not late enough that anyone should notice. Even if they did, he could just point out how his last meeting cut into his lunch.<br />
<br />
He checked his e-mail, his tail curling around the base of his office chair. ‘This is so weird,” he thought. Nothing too important. A few documents to skim before his video call. He just hoped he’d be able to focus, and hopefully keep the whole Lamia thing under wraps.<br />
<br />
Kelly was checking her e-mail as well. Nothing too much going on. Her next few hours would be filling out forms and organizing documents. Pretty standard. She stretched her tail out across the room, seeing how far it could reach. The muscles pulling and writhing beneath her scales felt so magnificently strange. Alien. Indescribable.<br />
<br />
She managed to reach the empty coffee cup on the side table and wrap the slender end of it around the handle. It was surprisingly dexterous. “Over five feet for sure,” she said as she pulled it over. She looked around for other things she could try and grab. This was fun.<br />
<br />
‘It’s not going to be a very productive afternoon,” she thought. Luckily she was a bit ahead in her work, so she could afford a little distraction.<br />
<br />
The hours passed. Kelly was constantly watching the clock, waiting for her 3:00 break. Every few minutes, she’d uncoil her tail from around her office chair and stretch it out, reveling in the sensation and seeing how far it could reach. She also let her tongue flick in and out, trying to identify the smells she could pick up.<br />
<br />
Plastic. Wood from her desk. The coppery scent from her computer. Her <br />
<br />
Every time, she was a little disappointed that she hadn’t changed any more. Her tail didn’t seem to be getting any longer, and she didn’t notice anything else happening either. ‘It can’t be done already, can it?’ She felt sure that there should have been more to come. She thought back to the last couple of changes: her tongue, and the new length to her tail.<br />
<br />
‘When I came!’ she realized. Jake’s tongue grew out when he had his first orgasm with his snake pussy. Hers did the same when he brought her to orgasm. And her tail grew out when he rediscovered her buried clit. ‘This is going to be great!’ she thought, feeling herself getting wet at the notion.<br />
<br />
<br />
The clock finally clicked to 3:00 and Kelly logged out in a hurry. She quickly unraveled herself from her chair and rushed for the door, hoping her and Jake could maybe have a quickie before she had to go back to work and finish off the day.<br />
<br />
As she slithered, she felt a piece of paper crumple under her scaly scutes, and she stopped. The instructions! Kelly had been so caught up in enjoying her new body that she almost forgot about it!<br />
<br />
She picked up the sheet and smoothed it out, and…</p>
