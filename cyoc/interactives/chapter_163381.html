<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec stood there in front of the mirror, seeing the mixed race looking guy standing there in the mirror where he should be seeing his usual, teenage self. He saw a guy with nearly caramel hued skin, his usual blue eyes, and a short afro on his head that was sustained when he prodded it with his hand. He numbly put on the new clothes and watched the man in the mirror do so as well. He would normally have been so excited, watching his enormous muscles interplay as he put the clothes on and checked how they fit, but now he was just...barely there. Shocked as he was, he was tranquil in the moment. Registering every little thing.<br />
<br />
He had to get home, and out of the streets. He had to get out of this damn store, which he thought was somehow making him look like this. Even though, as he thought about it, he realized this was probably what all these changes were building up to. He bit his lip when he felt the new clothes nicely fit on him, forcing down an aroused response at the sight. &quot;I&#39;m not turned on lookin&#39; at this...no way no how.&quot;<br />
<br />
Exiting the changing booth, he went up to the cashier lady, feeling pretty numb still. He was wearing one of the tanks and pairs of jeans, and the cashier, an older black woman, promptly smiled at him, &quot;Ohh my, you look just dashing in those clothes. You some kinda bodybuilder? Damn, you body looking FINE.&quot;<br />
<br />
He flushed a little at the attention, and shook his head, &quot;No...not me, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m really a bodybuilder per se. Just...I get really big when I bulk up for wrestlin&#39;.&quot; Alec was glad he was still mostly talking like he usually did, and he hoped that this...whatever this was, it didn&#39;t take away who he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that all comes out to 89.96. You payin&#39; in cash or credit uh...&quot; She announced the damage, and now wanted his name.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s uh, Alec...&quot; He took out five twenties, a meager sum for a guy like him, and handed them over. Taking the change and looking down at his hands for a moment, Alec breathed, &quot;I&#39;ll be around, see ya later. If I like, need some more new clothes.&quot; And with that Alec left, his old clothes in the bag with his other new clothes.<br />
<br />
And with that Alec started speedily walking home. Eager to get himself off the street and away from...all of this. He needed to cool his head and find out how this was happening, what happened to make all this happen to him. People don&#39;t just change races outta nowhere! Alec had to stop himself a few times from stopping and flexing his muscles for a nearby window or sufficiently reflective surface. He had more important things to be doing right now than just preening and...and somehow ENJOYING this radically altered body.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t let himself get acclimated to it.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m white, Alec told himself, even though it&#39;s not lookin&#39; that way right now. I&#39;m a white guy. And nothing can take that away from me. I&#39;m my parents&#39; son, I&#39;ll graduate with honors, and I&#39;ll be somebody! Alec almost froze when a group of black guys passed him on the street on his way back to his house.<br />
<br />
One of them, a rather average height and fat looking dude, said in a friendly tone, &quot;Hey brotha! You seen where that Cafe is around here? Cass keeps tellin&#39; me its over there, and I tell him, yo, you trippin&#39;? Can you uh, set us right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brotha.<br />
Brotha.<br />
Brotha.<br />
<br />
Alec almost had another freak out over the casual use of that word to refer to him, and he shakily pointed in the direction of the cafeteria, &quot;Go...north up there, then right. Can&#39;t miss it, guys.&quot; He kept walking even as he heard them continue to chat and even shout thanks to him as they walked off. Alec was almost too astounded by how that whole thing went.<br />
<br />
They were...they just based their words on how Alec LOOKED right now. And that was a mistake. Because deep down Alec knew who he was. And he had no intention of being a-a...<br />
<br />
Before long, Alec was home, and thankfully his parents&#39; neglectful tendencies had continued on - the only hint of them came in the form of a message on the house phone that they were heading from their last vacation into a six week vacation to the Bahamas. He sighed and deleted the message. He made sure the front door was locked as usual, and quickly headed upstairs.<br />
<br />
Before long his tank top was resting on the floor outside the upstairs bathroom / shower room, and inside, the jeans and boxer shorts he had on were resting on the floor. Alec looked over his naked reflection in the bathroom mirror, seeing his impeccably muscled physique covered in that foreign skin. He couldn&#39;t help himself but flex an arm and watch the musculature tense and show admirably. He looked down, and commented with a dry laugh, &quot;...I see in my case at least the stereotype holds true. Guess I&#39;m way more hung now than ever before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec went ahead and tried to undo the afro he now had on his head, tried to get it back down to straighter, less permed looking hair, but after a few minutes of trying, he figured what he ended up with would be good enough. Another erotic pulse at his manhood, brought on by Alec having a brief and curious thought about how his girlfriend might take his dick now. He breathed and winced as he splashed cold water on his dick, cursing under his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re stupid, Alec...cmon man. You knew what&#39;d happen...&quot; Alec told himself, trying to think straight instead of jumping into another erotic misadventure.<br />
<br />
Seeing that he was alone now, Alec didn&#39;t bother putting his clothes back on and thought about what he could do. He couldn&#39;t be seen outdoors looking like THIS! He&#39;d be mistaken surely! At least, Alec thought as he looked himself over, he didn&#39;t look all that bad while this was all going on. If anything, his muscles were better than they&#39;d been when he was just a normal, unchanged kid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm...&quot; Alec looked out, thinking of what to do...</p>
