<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel was relieved that things were sorted out and that Tara could help provide Moe and his family with some shelter while the present issues in dealing with the threat posed by the Gambonis to the Charleston family was so high. Tara might be a normal human woman and she might be more of specialist officer for the Moon Lake PD, but with many of these things going on, her help was invaluable. So after sending a text to his son, he then set in to discuss with Agent Baoman and the gathered agents that were present as part of the other FBI agents that were there as part of the sting.<br />
<br />
&quot;The most frustrating part of this will be the waiting,&quot; Agent Baoman sighed as he leaned over the conference table where a map of Moon Lake was laid out, &quot;Since we don&#39;t know exactly when Marcus will make his move.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not worried about the head of the family?&quot; Daniel asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know where he is and have some supervision on him,&quot; Agent Baoman answered, &quot;and from what questions we could ask him directly... we are pretty sure that the &quot;Don&quot; of the Gamboni crime family is pretty close to being ready to throw the entire issue out. Particularly after Albert was arrested at Fort Wolfe. Which means that when Marcus is captured... he will likely give up. We&#39;ve got the sense that he&#39;s only keep this chase of his going as long as it has because of the soft spot he has for Marcus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which will mean once Marcus is caught... and likely whoever he is with, the Don will give up and return home, where he&#39;ll find that because of this lengthy chase, he may have to fight to regain full control over his own holdings again,&quot; another agent spoke up. Daniel thought he caught the scent of werewolf on her, but said nothing about that. He did notice that she had a slight New York accent, though more upstate New York than closer to New York City.<br />
<br />
&quot;And he&#39;d be caught there?&quot; Daniel asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or as he leaves, as we slowly get through Albert&#39;s computer and files on it,&quot; Agent Baoman nodded, &quot;which means even the Don will face real trouble that old tricks won&#39;t work on. In the meantime, all we can do is wait and nab Marcus when he arrives.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone nodded to that and then gathered around the conference table, as Agent Baoman looked at the map. The circular layout of the town was odd and different, but based on the map it did provide them with something that would benefit them, as it appeared that there would only be limited routes into Moon Lake. The only questions would be on how to cover those that would be on monitoring duty on the edges to the town. The areas on the east, west, and south entrances to the town could work as there were public buildings there that could be manned by teams of two in shifts, standard surveillance tactics will work there. The north entrance to the town, however, was marked as a residential neighborhood on the map, which would then make having an agent there and in the open would come off as a potential giveaway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we can run standard surveillance tactics to keep an eye out for them from the east, west, and south entrances,&quot; Agent Baoman said slowly, &quot;they have a Burger King here on the west...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it is open twenty four hours,&quot; Daniel cut in, &quot;the agents you assign to watch there could essentially sit and keep watch there. They might want to dress as though they weren&#39;t agents... but it would be a place where they can sit and observe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Agent Baoman nodded, &quot;and we can do the same from the motel here on the town&#39;s south entrance. Those assigned can watch from the window to their room. It may be a bit &quot;creepy&quot; to those that live here, but the Gambonis won&#39;t be expecting it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though they might come to the hotel themselves,&quot; Daniel warned, &quot;that will depend on when they come and what they plan to do. Anyone stationed there for monitoring will NEED to look like they&#39;re watching something else. Traffic going up the street, like they&#39;re counting how many cars come into Moon Lake each day and night, following birds in the area around the area, or even... as if they&#39;re able to look in on someone in the shower. It may come off as perverted, but it would at least provide some distraction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If they come to the motel, why not grab them there?&quot; one of the male agents wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we don&#39;t know for sure if they will come to the motel,&quot; Agent Baoman spoke, &quot;the only place we know they will go is the Charlestons&#39; home. That will mean that whoever is on recon duty to report their arrival will essentially be alone and without immediate backup. That&#39;s where the most you&#39;re to do if you see them is to provide an alert to those waiting at the Charleston home. They&#39;ll need to be alert too... just in case these guys manage to somehow sneak in.<br />
<br />
Daniel and the others nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... would anyone hangout at the Target on the east entrance?&quot; Agent Baoman asked to Daniel, as since Daniel Brooks would be the main Moon Lake officer assigned to work with them and would be part of the capture team at the Charleston home, it would do best to make sure that they got as much information as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not normally,&quot; Daniel admitted, &quot;a lot of times when we&#39;ve had someone there and outside the building, it&#39;s been teenagers in the summer, either coming in to get bottled drinks playing in the woods behind the building.&quot; Daniel didn&#39;t mention that most of those teenagers tended to be weres and went into the woods at night to do &quot;were&quot; things. Thankfully most in Moon Lake would be alert enough to give the FBI agents a wide birth, even at night. &quot;But if your agents could pull off a sort of laid back and casual look... they might be able to pull it off. We can alert the store&#39;s staff and residents in the area to ignore them loitering around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that will be a relief,&quot; Agent Baoman sighed. The explanation wasn&#39;t perfect, but one had the play the hand they were dealt. &quot;That then leaves the north entrance... which will be tougher. As that&#39;s all residential and they are all occupied?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Daniel gave a nod, &quot;though... we could arrange for the team there to move up north of Moon Creek and essentially camp in the woods. The Target does have some tents, mostly designed to blend in... Set them up deeper in the woods and let them work in shifts closer to the road. A lot of the ground cover should be thick enough to avoid attention so long as they&#39;re not moving around too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t some of that land privately owned though?&quot; one agent asked as he looked to the point that Daniel was pointing to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of that part is public land that the city owns and is connected to the campgrounds north of the lake,&quot; Daniel answered, &quot;and even if this spot was privately owned... we&#39;d be able to arrange it and have contact with the owner. Because if you&#39;re just sitting out on the street, you&#39;ll alert the Gambonis when they come in... and putting you in with the families there would inconvenience them and potentially make them targets if discovered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about wildlife?&quot; the female agent, the one that Daniel thought might be a werewolf based on her scent, &quot;this town is small and in the mountains surrounded by woods... Surely there are some run ins...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes,&quot; Daniel spoke, &quot;though it&#39;s mostly deer... and many of them are raised on some of the farms/ranches along Moon Lake&#39;s outer edge to assure there are plenty of deer in the region for the hunting season.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Their papers are in order, I trust?&quot; Agent Baoman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So far as I know,&quot; Daniel nodded, &quot;and we&#39;ve never gotten calls from the State, so things should be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything more than deer?&quot; the female agent asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;On some rare occasions there might be a bear or mountain lion spotted,&quot; Daniel spoke, &quot;but so long as your reasonably careful and don&#39;t have too much in the way of food at the site, there shouldn&#39;t be a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would we keep time?&quot; a different agent brought up, &quot;our phones might have an alarm... but we&#39;d potentially still need to come into town to recharge them periodically, and if we&#39;re not to take food out there... that would mean leaving the site.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Might be best to keep three or four in shifts at that site,&quot; Daniel offered, &quot;that way they can rotate in and out more easily would have time to return to the motel here for those sorts of things. It&#39;d be tougher... but that&#39;s really the best that can be done if you&#39;re wanting to keep the monitoring teams hidden/disguised.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll volunteer with that group,&quot; the female agent that Daniel thought was a werewolf offered.<br />
<br />
Agent Baoman nodded, &quot;Very well, Agent Reeds. You&#39;ll be in charge of the team to the north.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel looked to her. The woman, Agent Brook Reeds, gave a confident smile and opened lowered her jaw a little and then clamped it shut so that the click of her teeth could be heard. Through all of this, her lips were kept closed. From what he knew she was with the Seattle Field office, though based on her accent, she&#39;d only recently transferred to that office from upstate New York. She did look confident with the assignment and the role, which Daniel figured was a good thing, though at the moment they really didn&#39;t have the time or privacy to talk. There was a werewolf scent on her, but there were enough people around that Daniel couldn&#39;t tell as to whether or not she was in fact a werewolf or had merely been close to a werewolf and the scent &quot;rubbed off.&quot; Regardless, she seemed confident, and that&#39;d probably help.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m sure the rest of the Moon Lake PD will keep a general look out while on patrol,&quot; Daniel spoke to Agent Baoman, &quot;they&#39;ll then report in if they see anything. If you talk with our dispatch officer, they can then rely that information to you as it comes in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Agent Baoman nodded and then looked to his agents.<br />
<br />
Agent Baoman then spent a few moments discussing the assignments with the gathered agents, which were fairly plentiful in Daniel&#39;s opinion, to set the teams that would then keep watch for the Gambonis. Daniel kept track of them and then noted that that ultimately left a team of five, not counting him and Agent Baoman left. Baoman had one agent stay with him in the command area at the police station to supervise and run the direct contact with any messages that would come in from dispatch. He then turned the briefing over to Daniel as he would technically be in charge for the arrest and ambush. And with the access and keys they&#39;d gotten from Moe, he could take them to the Charleston home and put the Charleston&#39;s car either on the driveway or in the garage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... the house we&#39;re going to isn&#39;t super big and won&#39;t have a lot of space, so if you have vehicles, it&#39;d be best to leave them here,&quot; Daniel spoke, &quot;as we want to lend the image that the Charlestons are at home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Turning on lights at night and putting things like pillows under the blankets, I assume?&quot; one of the remaining four agents spoke.<br />
<br />
Daniel nodded, &quot;We may have to borrow some food from the Charlestons as we go... but try to keep track of what is borrowed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can bring take out... that Local Diner looks okay... and I think I saw they had &quot;to go&quot; orders,&quot; the agent that would be with Agent Baoman in the &quot;command role&quot; for the operation, &quot;that&#39;d save them food they&#39;d have to replace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could work... though be careful, the Local Diner does have &quot;to go&quot; orders, but they don&#39;t deliver,&quot; Daniel warned, and then pointed to the spot on the map where the Brooks home was, &quot;you can park here at my home and then walk around the back to here at the Charlestons&#39; home. I&#39;ll let my wife and son know on these things before we go fully into the waiting...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we&#39;ll set up at the house first, right?&quot; the second of the remaining four agents asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Daniel nodded, &quot;I&#39;ll take Moe&#39;s car back to the house and let you in. Some things may be hectic in using hallways or areas that are out of sight as camping spots... but we&#39;ll still be set up. I&#39;ll then walk back here to get my car and move it to my home and explain things with my family and then come to join you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel was careful as he said this. He knew the sting operation would carry risks that would take him away from Peter and Francine, whom he did love dearly. But Moe had always been a good friend and he do what he could to protect his friend&#39;s future, which would mean that until the Gambonis got caught in the trap, he&#39;d have to be away from Peter and Francine to keep an eye on Moe&#39;s home and not let the agents that were there to participate in the sting do anything that might damage the home. They essentially had the trap set in what they would do... now there would only be a set hustle to get everything set up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that should be about everything,&quot; Daniel spoke as he turned back to Agent Baoman, &quot;though we&#39;d best get going and get set up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And get to it, and good luck,&quot; Agent Baoman nodded and said to Daniel, &quot;I&#39;ll also coordinate our reports with your police chief. Let him know that he&#39;s not out of the loop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll appreciate that,&quot; Daniel answered, and the group began to break up and head out. The four that would be at the Charleston house followed Daniel as they moved to actually set the trap.</p>
