<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">High-school was an odd time for many. Especially since the beginning of head switching. While people would switch often staring at a young age, high-school was the time most would loose their original bodies, if they still had them that is. <br />
<br />
The same old social clicks existed, but now people would hop from jock, to nerd, to outcast, then to cheerleaders. While everyone knew that the body would eventually have an effect on how the head looked, there was a certain psychological effect on style and to a certain degree, personal tastes.<br />
<br />
The old phrase, &quot;the heart wants what the heart wants&quot;, had been replaced with the body wants what the body wants. There had been cases where people have swapped heads and their boyfriend/girlfriend ended up dating the new owner of their old body. It usually didn&#39;t result with hard feelings. People found who they found attractive changed with what body they had and obviously theor old body would have a thing for whoever they were dating.<br />
<br />
It became a time of experimentation, and people would look back and laugh about all the phases they had gone through. Though unlike the past, the number of phases were a lot higher and the difference between them were more extreme. Cole had watched an interview with one of his favorite athletes laughing about his high-school days. &quot;Can you believe I spent all four years of high-school as a girl?&quot; He had apparently done it on a whim and just stayed a girl until college.<br />
<br />
Cole didn&#39;t find that too odd. His ex-girlfriend was now the captain of the boys basketball team. They would sometimes hang and play, but his game was more football, so Cole usually lost. His best friend from his middle school anime phase was now a goth girl. She apparently wanted the body for a specific cosplay but was unable to get her old body back afterwards, which was a common story. Cole may not be into anime as much as he used to be, but he would still watch it with her and never said no to hanging out with her at conventions when she needed someone muscular to be a character from the same anime as she was cosplaying at the moment. Then there were the twins.<br />
<br />
Eli and Ella were fraternal twins who would switch there heads every month, or every other month. It could be difficult to tell which is which since they would use the name of their bodies and they started when the were so young no one was sure who was originally the brother and who was the sister. They both had a Bob cut, and would style it differently depending on which body they had at the time. It used to be that it took several months to change, but they used the Presto pill. Presto accelerated the natural bodies function and allowed the head to start changing after 12 hours instead. From there you head would fully adapt in less then a week. Despite this, they did have different personalities and it was usually obvious which personality had which body. For those who didnt know them though, the one way to tell the difference physocally was one dressed more as a girly-girl as Ella&#39;s, and was more of a prep as Eli. The other tended to dress in a rocker style for either body.<br />
<br />
Cole once asked when they planned to stop switching, and if they had a preference for a certain body. Both said they never intended on staying in one body. They had already agreed if someone was dating or married Ella, that person would be with Ella regardless of who had the body at the time. The same went for Eli. The people they dated seemed fine with it. They either got used to the shifting personalities or break up.<br />
<br />
Ever since Cole heard that a pro athlete spent years as a girl, he was more curious. It wouldn&#39;t have been the first time he had been a girl. His parents had taken him to the Body Shop to get a girl&#39;s body so he could go to his sister&#39;s sweet 16 as her little sister. Afterward he returned as to being a boy, but he was wondering about having a longer stay as a girl.<br />
<br />
The body would be very different now since he was 17 and not 12 this time around. Cole figured if he wanted to try it out, it wouldn&#39;t be too difficult. He was one of the star players on the football team, his body was pretty nice. Any girl wanting to give being a boy a try would likely be glad to trade. The only question was who to ask.<br />
<br />
Cole&#39;s obvious forst choice was the cheerleaders. They were hot, close enough to the football players that he could talk to them, and moat importantly, hot. If he was going to be a girl, might as well be hot.<br />
<br />
When he mentioned it, one of the girls hand shot up. &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot; Amber nearly shouted. She was short, busty, and had a great ass. As far as being a girl her body was a great choice, even if Cole would have preferred to have been  bit taller.<br />
<br />
As it turned out, Amber had originally been Andrew. In 3rd grade he made friends with a girl named Tabby, another one of the cheerleaders. She had a sleep over. He was invited, but only if he had a girl&#39;s body. So she showed up as Amber. The girls had convinced Amber to keep the girl&#39;s body. She wanted to be closer to Tabby and decided to stay a girl. Amber had spent years, growing up and eventually realizing the reason she wanted to be close to Tabby was because she wanted to date her. Tabby unfortunately had no interest in dating girls but would give Amber a chance if she became a boy again. However, her old body was long gone.<br />
<br />
Amber was excited to switch. She could finally be a boy again, date Tabby, and didn&#39;t have to worry about periods. The last bit gave Cole pause but the rest of the squad quickly reassured him that it would be fine. It seemed that several were shipping Amber and Tabby, while others just thought Cole would be fun in on the team.<br />
<br />
Cole pulled his head off, and held it as Amber lifted her own and placed it on Cole&#39;s shoulder. He quickly felt the awkward sensation of his body disappearing. Everything below Cole&#39;s neck vanished as he became just a head. The complete lack of sensation was disturbing. <br />
<br />
Amber lifted Cole and he say himself approaching Amber&#39;s former body. When placed on it, she felt a sudden shock as all feeling returned. Then she realized that they weren&#39;t quite the same. She had a new weight on her chest she wasn&#39;t accustomed to, as well as the strange breeze beneath her skirt. Amber had been wearing the cheerleaders uniform when they swapped. Cole could feel a tight fabric below, very different then the boxers she had worn before. It made the lack of a manhood very obvious. <br />
<br />
&quot;It feels great being Andrew again!&quot; He announced flexing his arms. One of the girls gave Andrew and Cole a Presto Pill, and they both ate it. &quot;So, what are you going to call yourself now?&quot;<br />
<br />
She thought about it for a moment. &quot;Cholie.&quot; She told them.</p>
