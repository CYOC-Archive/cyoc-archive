<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry woke in the morning with his own voice back and Alicia’s smooth legs. He went to the bathroom and peed, but then instead of getting back into bed beside Alicia, stayed in front of the mirror and checked his reflection. <br />
<br />
The first thing he noticed was that he was still short. He had not regained any of the height he had lost when they had drunk the first sachet. He had Alicia’s original legs. The legs that contributed to her former 5’8 height. The legs were shapely. It was hard to say exactly why they were different they still had shins, knees and thighs but the muscle and fat deposition was somehow different. Perhaps it was he now had fatter thighs and potentially thinner shins. Also thanks to the wax job Alicia had done before the wedding there were certainly no hairs at all on the legs Henry currently had.<br />
<br />
“Good morning sexy legs” said Alicia from the bed. “I see we got the swap we were expecting”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I was just trying to figure out the exact differences. Other than no hairs, the changes are not clear, yet these are so obviously girl’s legs”<br />
<br />
“It will take me a while to get used to having a girl voice again. I actually really enjoyed yesterday”<br />
<br />
“I did too. It was a nice novelty but I’m happy to have my own voice back”<br />
<br />
“We should do Karaoke again”<br />
<br />
“And have someone complain again?”<br />
<br />
“No, I mean go to the Karaoke bar”<br />
<br />
“Maybe… Let’s see how the rest of the day goes first”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Why don’t you have first shower. I could be a while”<br />
…..<br />
<br />
When Alicia finally came out of the shower, Henry could see why she had taken so long. The legs she currently had had been shaved. “Don’t worry the hairs will grow back in time”<br />
<br />
“I thought you were going to wear those slacks you bought”<br />
<br />
“Maybe. I just didn’t like having hairy legs. I had never noticed this scar on you. How did you get that?” She was pointing at a scar on her right thigh.<br />
<br />
“A bike accident when I was a teenager. It’s harder to pick when the legs are hairy”<br />
<br />
&quot;I think now my legs are shaved they are quite passable. I&#39;m going to wear a skirt&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I notice you call them &#39;my&#39; legs. They are actually mine&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for today. They are attached to me therefore they are my legs&quot;<br />
<br />
Alicia decided on an animal print midi-skirt, now even with her extra height, the hem was below her knees and the scar on her thigh was hidden.  Henry trousers still fit him and he didn&#39;t want people to see his shaved legs. With the trousers on, he thought the change in legs was not obvious at all.<br />
<br />
At breakfast they were chatty making up for the silence of yesterday. They even visited the tour desk once more and discussed places of interest with the activities adviser, Amy, before heading back to their suite. They had decided on a visit to the Missouri Memorial in the morning, then a drive up to the North Shore to visit some of the places Amy recommended. It is the wrong time of year for the big waves but it was somewhere both had always wanted to visit.<br />
<br />
They day went really well. Later after lunch Henry ended up rolling up his trousers, as they walked in the shallows on one of the North Shore beaches. &quot;I wish I had worn my shorts&quot; he expressed to Alicia. &quot;These legs just feel normal&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m glad I wore my skirt. It&#39;s too hot for slacks. Why don&#39;t you put your bathers on? We have the beach to ourselves. We could have a swim&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bathers? I didn&#39;t bring mine&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you&#39;re lucky you have such a thoughtful wife. I thought of you when I packed mine&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my legs though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plenty of men shave their legs. No one will even notice&quot;<br />
<br />
So they changed and found an isolated cove where they enjoyed a swim in the shallows.  Henry had to admit that Alicia’s legs didn’t look quite right, they were perhaps a bit skinny, but she was still a very hot looking woman in her leopard print bikini.<br />
<br />
On the way back to the resort they stopped at a cafe for an early dinner. Henry commented “This swap has actually been much easier than I imagined. I was fearing it, but we just had a pretty normal day. I’m no longer sure what I was so worried about” <br />
<br />
“I know what you mean. Everything seemed so daunting when we first realised what we were in for but now when I look back the swaps have been pretty fun. I loved doing the karaoke with you last night. That was something special. I didn’t know I had such a sweet singing voice”<br />
<br />
“I think you might be underestimating the talent of the singer” Henry said with a grin “But looking back now I have to admit that it was fun having your hands and feet, even having diamond earrings was quite an experience”<br />
<br />
“You could have diamond earrings any time you wanted. All you have to do is get your ears pierced” It took a moment for Henry to realise Alicia was joking. “Seriously though Henry, I feel this whole doll episode is actually bringing us closer. It could be a blessing in disguise”<br />
<br />
“I hope you are right. It would be nice if Maureen’s little prank backfired on her. However, we are going to have to undergo some more drastic swaps in the next few days”<br />
<br />
“Should we perhaps do one of the harder ones tomorrow?” Alicia suggested. “Maybe save the Arms, which I think will be another easy swap, for later?”<br />
<br />
“What would you actually like to do tomorrow? That should determine what we swap”<br />
<br />
“Maybe a walk through the forest. The weather is supposed to be nice tomorrow but they are predicting rain later in the week”<br />
<br />
“I’d be up for that. There was a pamphlet on hikes that Amy gave us, we can choose one from there”<br />
<br />
“Okay. So we are going walking. What do we swap?” asked Alicia<br />
<br />
“Maybe our hair?”<br />
<br />
“It could get hot if you have to wear that hat all day with your hair bundled into it. I was thinking we could do that one when we went to another remote beach. That way you could just pretend to be a man with a pony tail. There are plenty of them about”<br />
<br />
“Well what did you have in mind? I wouldn’t recommend our tummies on a day we want to do anything physical. That corset restricted my breathing”<br />
<br />
“How about our chests. You could have the experience of walking with bouncy breasts. We’ll have to do that swap at some stage”<br />
<br />
“I’ll think about it”</p>
