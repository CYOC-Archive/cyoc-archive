<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I took Biddy for a walk while Sarah prepared dinner. After we had eaten Sarah asked “Do you want to use the medallion again?”<br />
<br />
“Well I want to but wonder if that is wise, It’s a bit addictive”<br />
<br />
“There is one thing I would like to try” She looked at me “I was reading the note that you had with the medallion. It said ‘If the clothing has never been worn you would turn into a person that could wear that clothing’ I’d like to find out what that means”<br />
<br />
After a pause she continued “If we did it right away we could change back before work tomorrow. I stopped at Target on the way home and bought two pairs of undies. One for you and one for me”<br />
<br />
She looked at me with pleading eyes. How could I resist her? Besides I was curious myself. “Ok but we should do it straight away. I’ll put Biddy out. You get the medallion”<br />
<br />
When I entered the bedroom Sarah was in the process of undressing. She said “Strip down to your undies and go to the bathroom” I did as I was told. The medallion was on the bathroom bench. “Put the medallion on. You can go first”<br />
<br />
A minute later Sarah clad only in her bra and panties joined me. She had a Target branded plastic bag in her hand. From it she pulled out and handed me some dark blue undies. “Touch these to the medallion”. I did so and felt a Zap. <br />
<br />
I took off the medallion and placed it back on the bench. Sarah put it on then touched another pair of undies from her bag to it. We both watched for changes. Sarah looked at me and grinned &quot;Did you read the label?&quot; <br />
<br />
I picked up the undies I had used. This will be interesting I thought as I read &#39;His Pants for Her&#39;<br />
<br />
We watched eager to see what would happen. On previous occasions the first change we noticed was with the hair. This time my hair didn&#39;t change. Or least the hair on my scalp. My body hair slowly sucked in. I started getting shorter. My features grew softer.<br />
I looked at Sarah. Her hair also hadn&#39;t changed. But she was growing broader and taller. She took off her bra as it grower tighter on her, not because her breasts were growing but her torso just got larger. Her hips narrowed. She was now my height. <br />
<br />
I looked back in the mirror. My nipples and areola&#39;s had enlarged. My chest was looking puffy. My shoulders had narrowed and I had lost muscle mass. Only my hips were getting wider. I was now shorter than Sarah by an inch or maybe two. I pushed down my boxers to watch what happening down below. My penis was shrunken and my balls were child sized. I held the little fella as he shrank further, retreating into my body. My feminine fingers were soon left with nothing to hold. I raised my hands to cup my breasts which were now a B cup. My nipples were erect protruding a good half inch. I looked back in the mirror I was now most definitely a she.<br />
<br />
I looked up at Sarah. She was no longer female. He was also completely naked. His hands were around a large penis and I mean large and also erect. He was not overly muscled but was well proportioned. yabout him was masculine except his hair. He still had Sarah&#39;s long brunette hair cut in her feminine style.<br />
<br />
I looked at myself again. I judged my changes had stopped. I was looking at Rod&#39;s sister, assuming he had one, with a manly hair cut. I could see a lot of resemblance to Hilda. My breasts were large certainly larger than Sarah&#39;s or Amanda&#39;s and my backside seemed disproportionally large. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your skin is flawless&quot; Sarah was looking at me and her masculine voice was unexpected. She sounded very much like Ted, indeed it was easy to see a resemblance as well. I looked closely at my face in the mirror. My skin was flawless, without blemish.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I guess that is what you would look like if you were born male&quot; I looked at Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are Rod&#39;s unborn twin sister&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should we do something about that&quot; I pointed at Sarah&#39;s penis. <br />
<br />
&quot;Later perhaps, I enjoy the anticipation. Let&#39;s get dressed&quot; He tore the label off the undies that had changed him and pulled them on. I did the same with the undies that had changed me. As could be expected they were a perfect fit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think my breasts might be a bit larger than yours&quot; I indicated the breasts I now possessed &quot;Would you have a bra that fits?&quot; <br />
<br />
He used that opportunity to cup the breasts &quot;I think you would need a D cup at least. I won&#39;t have one that size. Maybe we cab use a bikini top to give you a little bit of support. I&#39;ll see what I can find&quot;<br />
<br />
I followed him into the room and he went through the drawers and produced a bikini top. He helped me put it on. It helped to stop the breasts wobbling but they were straining to be released. Let&#39;s see what else I might have that fits. I followed him to the guest bedroom and he handed me a dress &quot;This is a beach wrap. It should fit. Let me help&quot; He put a strap over one arm then wrapped what looked like a sheet around me and my other hand went through a second loop. &quot;That looks good&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked in the mirror. I would not have said I looked good. I looked like a butch girl wearing a dress that was a bit tight. However I did have flawless skin. I realized both of us were starkly white, which made sense as this skin had never been exposed to sunlight. If anything I looked like a goth girl, but goth girls didn&#39;t wear colorful beach wraps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me put something on myself then see if we can do something about the hair&quot;<br />
<br />
He returned to the main bedroom and a minute later was dressed in shorts and a polo shirt. He was about the same size as Rod. He also had a pair of scissors. We went to the bathroom and he handed me the scissors. &quot;Give me a hair cut&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t reach that high. You will have to get a chair and sit down&quot; <br />
<br />
Sarah retrieved a chair from the kitchen and put it on the bathroom floor, exactly where he had done my hair on Friday night. He sat down &quot;Don&#39;t worry if you butcher it. It will return when we change back&quot; Reluctantly I sliced off Sarah&#39;s long locks. She really did have nice hair. I did end up butchering the hair cut. Had he been a paying customer I might have been sued. However like Sarah had said it didn&#39;t really matter. At least he no longer looked the least bit feminine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok your turn. Lets see if I can perform a miracle&quot; We swapped places. She got a comb and brushed my hair. Made a few snips and maybe softened the look a little. &quot;I think if we ever went out you might wear a hat&quot; was all she could say when he finally gave up. &quot;I could try some make-up&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I think I&#39;m a bit of a lost cause at the moment&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually you might be surprised by how turned on I currently am. I think it&#39;s time to try these new bodies out, Miss Burton&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr McKenzie&quot;<br />
<br />
I think Sarah enjoyed fondling my large breasts. I know I enjoyed his large penis taking my new found virginity</p>
