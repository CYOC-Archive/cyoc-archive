<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sound of flip flops carried through the dorm halls. Ty let out a bit of a chuckle as he knew full well that Alex was coming after him. &quot;Wait!&quot; Alex called out. &quot;Wait up!&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty paused, just enough for Alex to catch up. He still stood a couple inches taller than the other man but it wasn&#39;t nearly as much as it had been. Instead of being a little under chest height, Alex was closer to his nose and mouth. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; Ty asked nonchalantly. They continued walking outside towards the quad.<br />
<br />
Alex stared, a bit flabbergasted. &quot;W-what do you mean what&#39;s up?!&quot; his voice cracked in frustration. People started looking at them and he forced himself to calm back down. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Alex hissed. &quot;Look at me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean yeah. You&#39;re pretty hot,&quot; Ty smirked. He especially liked seeing Alex&#39;s face burn bright red. &quot;Or is that not what you meant?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex went a bit bashful at the handsome man complimenting him. He didn&#39;t know about all the wishes that Ty had put on himself to make people more attracted to him, but that didn&#39;t mean Alex wasn&#39;t falling for every single one of them. &quot;I mean...&quot; he paused unsure what to say next.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Did I not make you big enough?&quot; Ty pretended to not understand. Watching Alex&#39;s eyes go wide was enough to make Ty&#39;s smile broaden. &quot;I&#39;m not going to do it now. You&#39;ll have to wait till tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
It brought Alex down from his daydream. &quot;Wait. What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty took a seat on top of an outdoor table. His feet rested on top of the seat. &quot;What do you mean what?&quot; he asked. &quot;I can grant wishes. But I&#39;m not going to be your personal genie. If you want me to make a wish, I&#39;ll think about it, but I&#39;m limiting you to a max of one a day. You&#39;ll have to deal with any ramifications you didn&#39;t think of. Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nodded along without thinking. &quot;Wait! What?&quot; he leaned in. &quot;Ramifications?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Ty shrugged. &quot;I mean how I worded the wish, you were you&#39;re little self all but 10 minutes ago. Now if anyone sees you, they probably won&#39;t even recognize you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WAIT! WHAT?!&quot; Alex shouted. Ty frowned, he hated this reaction. But Alex quickly went to his phone to verify that every picture of him was actually his scrawny little self instead of the jacked stud standing in the commons area. Even as he stood there he could feel the presence of people watching him and Ty and it wasn&#39;t just because of his outbursts. Their eyes lingered on his muscular body, but ultimately landed onto Ty&#39;s. &quot;This--This is crazy...&quot; he continued to scroll. &quot;H-h-how?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic,&quot; Ty used spirit fingers as he said it. &quot;Just always been able to make wishes and they come true. How do you think I got this way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s crazy...&quot; Alex uttered. &quot;And you can make it so no one realizes anything changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded. That&#39;s when a devious grin filled his smile. &quot;Yep. Just thought it&#39;d be a bit more fun to watch you shred your clothes and freak out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex forced a glare. &quot;And I lost a good shirt, shorts and shoes to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you rather turn back to that and forget all about this?&quot; Ty offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-n-no!&quot; Alex took several steps back as though that would somehow put a stop to the magic. He quickly realized how stupid that was. &quot;I just feel weird. I never thought I&#39;d be one of those guys wearing sleeveless shirts and looking good doing so.&quot; His arm raised up and he reflexively tightened his bicep watching the muscle flex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same,&quot; Ty grinned remembering the times when he was growing up and fawning over his magically granted size. It was better knowing that everyone just believed it was natural. Guys who had looked down on him, had to look up and not understand why it felt weird. However, their conversation had to be put on hold as a security guard spotted Ty sitting on the table. His eyes locked onto Ty and was heading right for them. &quot;I&#39;ll let you watch what I can do...&quot; he smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; the security guard raised up a hand and increased his pace towards Ty and Alex. &quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing? That&#39;s where people eat.&quot; He tried to act tough. The 5&#39;9&quot; rental cop wasn&#39;t exactly small, but he wasn&#39;t big either. He looked to be a lean but slightly athletic 160 pounds. However, when Ty stood up, he shrunk back not fully realizing how big the guy was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry sir,&quot; Ty acted innocent. &quot;Didn&#39;t mean to cause any trouble.&quot; He then made some silent wishes. &#39;I wish the security guard also wanted to feel up my body because he&#39;s turned on by it. I wish that he won&#39;t want to leave until he cums in his pants. I wish the more he feels it the harder he gets and when he finishes it&#39;ll be the best orgasm he&#39;s ever had in his life.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; the security guard said. However, he didn&#39;t leave. Instead, he kind of just stood there and stared. His eyes traced every part of Ty&#39;s huge body. They went around his massive arms, down to his giant hands. He stared at the sleeveless shirt that was straining against the massive chest and hung loosely of Ty&#39;s thin waist. &#39;Fuck! He&#39;s big!&#39; the security screamed in his head as he shifted his weight back and forth. Blood was rapidly rushing to his cock, forcing it to grow erect. He then added a breathless, &quot;No... No harm done...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty smirked watching as his wishes overtook the security guard. He glanced over at Alex and nodded. &quot;Is that all you wanted?&quot; Ty asked. He rubbed the back of his neck, nonchalantly but flexed the massive muscle.<br />
<br />
The security guard&#39;s eyes bulged. His knees went weak under the sight of the imposing man. &quot;Err...&quot; he tried to act confident by instantly lost it again as he asked his question. &quot;Do you mind if-- Do you mind if I tough your body?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you normally go around touching guys bodies?&quot; Ty taunted. He made sure to add just a little bit of disgust into his voice as he said it.<br />
<br />
It made the security guard squirm. &quot;N-n-no,&quot; he admitted. He knew this wasn&#39;t right but his body wouldn&#39;t let him do anything else. Just looking at Ty, he felt this uncontrollable urge to touch him. To feel him up. To grope him. He was expecting Ty to say &#39;no&#39;, but was incredibly surprised to find himself being shoved into the massive man&#39;s pit. &quot;Oh fuck...&quot; he moaned as his face rubbed up against Ty&#39;s skin. His hands were quick to find their way under Ty&#39;s shirt and run up over his abs and against his powerful pecs.<br />
<br />
He wanted to feel every bit of Ty. His hands wouldn&#39;t stop running up and down the other man&#39;s skin. He pulled Ty into a huge hug while his face buried itself deeper into Ty&#39;s pit. The salty sweaty smell didn&#39;t bother him. Just feeling the bigger man&#39;s body with as much as he possibly could was all he wanted. That&#39;s when he felt his body buck. Words couldn&#39;t come out of him as his knees slowly gave way to an orgasm that dropped him to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;You alright bud?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
The security guard&#39;s eyes fluttered as he was still struggling to come off the high he&#39;d just experienced. That&#39;s when he noticed the wet feeling in his underwear and pants. A stain was rapidly seeping through. &quot;Err... Yeah...&quot; he muttered. Red started to color his face. However, Ty outstretched his hand to help him up.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright bud. Not the first time someone&#39;s done that,&quot; Ty smirked.<br />
<br />
A calming feeling rushed through the security guard as he was helped up from the ground. That sounded right. This guy was huge! And undeniably hot! Of course it wasn&#39;t the first time it&#39;d ever happened to him. Probably would be the last. Even if this whole situation was unorthodox, the security guard no longer felt that way. &quot;Thanks... And sorry about...&quot; the security guard gestured to his pants.<br />
<br />
Ty laughed. &quot;Nah man. It&#39;s fine. None of it got on me so I don&#39;t care.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-true,&quot; the security guard laughed right along with him. &quot;Well, I&#39;ve gotta go change.&quot; He added as he was walking away. However, there were several obvious glances back at Ty as he continued back to get some new pants.<br />
<br />
Ty went and sat on the table again. &quot;Do you believe me now?&quot;</p>
