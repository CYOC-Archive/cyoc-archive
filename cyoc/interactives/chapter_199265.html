<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel and Matt made their way to class. As they traversed the halls, Daniel couldn’t help but notice a slightly crinkling sound as he walked.  The diaper thankfully didn’t leave any noticeable lumps on the outside of his pants, but there was a definite noise to be heard as he took a couple steps.<br />
<br />
“Hey um, Matt.  Are these always so, well, noisy?”<br />
<br />
“Kinda, but you’ll get used to it!  It’s something that’s more noticeable to the person wearing them.  By the way, I almost forgot but I also brought some talcum powder in case you start to chafe.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, it’s cool that your so prepared.  How often did you use it?” Daniel asked, a bit anxious for the answer. <br />
<br />
“Not too often but it’s good to be prepared.  I guess before P.E. class sometimes.  Hey I guess I can actually do more physical activity stuff now!  I really wasn’t able to before.” <br />
<br />
Before Daniel could keep the conversation going the bell rang as they both entered the classroom. <br />
<br />
The boys promptly took their seat in English class.  Daniel still had some more questions for Matt about what his seemingly new life would entail, but their assigned seats were too far to make meaningful conversation.  <br />
<br />
As class continued, everything in class was quiet apart from their teacher making students read aloud famous novel excerpts for later analysis.  <br />
<br />
“Daniel Wilson, can you please read the excerpt for the class?” <br />
<br />
Daniel was caught off guard by being picked.  He was still lost in thought. <br />
“Y-yeah no problem Mr. Zielinski! Um.. which excerpt again?”<br />
<br />
The class let our a few giggles as the teacher rolled his eyes.  “Very funny Daniel, the quote is the 3rd from the bottom, from the novel which you all fail to address with maturity, “Moby Dick.”<br />
<br />
Daniel definitely was in no position to joke about that ironic title. He found his placed and began to read aloud.<br />
 <br />
“By reason of these then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great flood-gates of the wonder world swung open-“<br />
<br />
-and just like that, Daniel’s heart sank as he felt a warm sensation in his diaper. Now?! He had no semblance of needing to relieve himself in the restroom just moment ago.  Yet here he was, right now, pissing himself like Niagara Falls was in his diapers! <br />
<br />
“The next word is “AND,” Daniel, can you please continue with the excerpt?” Mr. Zielinski said, growing a tad impatient.<br />
<br />
The diaper was doing it’s job, thankfully, but here Daniel was, pissing like a goddam race horse! <br />
<br />
He tried to get himself to calm down as he continued to read the excerpt, “-and in the w-wild that sWaYed me t-to my purPose,” Daniel was visibly sweating, how could his little dicklet produce so much piss?! Gosh he could feel the back of his diaper begun to soften as the liquid spread.  It was all still miraculously contained, his pants dry as a bone.<br />
“-two and two there f-flooded-“<br />
<br />
“Daniel the word is “floated” not “flooded.” I can see you can still hardly hold back from giggling at the novel’s name so that’s far enough.”<br />
<br />
Daniel was relived to no longer be the center of attention but still mortified… and strangely excited?  He just pissed himself!  Now here he was, literally stewing in his own juices.  <br />
<br />
Daniel sat there, throughly embarrassed and he hated to admit it, revaluing his life choices. <br />
<br />
~immediately after class~<br />
<br />
“You really went?? Woah your first “accident!”<br />
Glad the diaper held up because you look totally dry.” Matt said.<br />
<br />
“Thanks but it definitely doesn’t feel dry.  I can already feel the diaper puffed out a bit.  I better get changed before it starts to sag.”<br />
<br />
“You should be fine for awhile, those pads are pretty absorbent in my experience.  Though they definitely can’t take a second accident.  We still don’t know how often to you, um, “go.” So maybe being more cautious by changing now is the right idea.” Matt suggested.<br />
<br />
Daniel nodded and the pair made their way down the school hallway. <br />
<br />
They are just passing the gymnasium when a voice called out to them.<br />
<br />
“Hey! If it isn’t Daniel Wilson, just the freshman I wanted to see!” <br />
<br />
Matt and Daniel stopped in their tracks and turned to face the deep voice that called out Daniel’s name.<br />
<br />
It was Mr. Sumter!  He was usually a history teacher but most people knew him as the head coach for several of the high school’s sports teams.  He knew Daniel by name, most likely because of Daniel’s older brother who had just graduated last year.  He had a big smile on his face and something in his hands. <br />
<br />
“Oh um h-hey Mr. Sumter!”<br />
<br />
“Oh come on now, cut the formality Danny boy! Hmm, actually not entirely haha.  You can just starting calling me, Coach Sumter! Because I’m certain you’re excited for tomorrow, despite some less than stellar attendance yesterday.” Coach Sumter said, still managing to maintain his friendly disposition while crossing his arms with authority.<br />
<br />
Daniel had a look of confusion on his face and turned to Matt to see if he know what Coach was referring too.  Matt’s shared confused expression quickly changed to one of realization.  He remembered what they were doing before stumbling upon Madame Illusia’s tent at the carnival.  Daniel was getting ready to-<br />
<br />
“Oh my gosh, I totally forgot about baseball tryouts yesterday!”  Daniel said aloud, completing Matt’s thought.  They got so wrapped up in all the literal magic that it completely slipped their minds!<br />
<br />
“Haha I figured you just lost track of time.  As long as you don’t go making a habit of it, we’re all good.  Oh to be a scatterbrained freshman.” Coach Wilson lamented while staring off into space.  “Your brother Caleb was one of the best hitters this school has ever had, man and he sure could run like there’s no tomorrow.  I got a glimpse of your talent at the junior high but I’m still very eager to see what else a spunky young man like you has to offer! Anyways I’m glad I ran into you, I was going to give this to one of your other teachers to hand off to you but here you go.”  <br />
<br />
Coach Wilson then handed Daniel a folded up baseball uniform. Afterwards, Coach went for a sporty slap on the Daniel’s behind before Daniel intercepted rather awkwardly with a handshake.  Coach would’ve surely felt his liquid filled, padded diaper if he made contact with his pants.<br />
<br />
“Woah, a manly handshake. A natural sportsman already, just like your older brother was! See you on the field tomorrow Daniel, or should I say, “future champ!” Coach said as he turned his attention back to his clipboard and went to the teacher’s lounge.<br />
<br />
Matt and Daniel just looked at each other.  Things were about to get… complicated.</p>
