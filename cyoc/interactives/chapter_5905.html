<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The alarm rand as normal at 5:00a.m. at the bedside of Kevin Rooste. A lawyer by trade and a long time enemy of the Genie's Master and friend. A long time the Genie had offered to arrange Kevin's untimely death or disappearance, but his Master would not hear of it.<br />
<br />
Kevin got out of bed and dressed in his jogging suit and quickly tied the strings of his tennis shoes. Now he was ready for the morning five mile jog.<br />
<br />
Out the front door of the three story English Tudor mansion he owned since he sued the previous owner. Down the long driveway and out along Short Road he jogged. The early morning air was fresh and made him feel as if he were young again. The streets of the city were almost deserted of cars as he plodded along. Down the Stafford Drive hill and on to the south alone Westnedge Avenue. Then soon the climb to Kline Park and a short rest before heading home.<br />
<br />
Huffing and short of breath Kevin sat down on a park bench overlooking the downtown. As he sat leaning back and soaking up as much fresh air as possible a Squirrel suddenly darted from the crotch of an Elm tree. The sudden noise made Kevin jump to alert status and check out what made the noise.<br />
<br />
A casual gaze about spotted a silver sparkle coming from the Elm tree. As Kevin stood on the back of his park bench he reached high as his fingers touched the shiny object. As he grasp it the Squirrel chattered from a nearby tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in Heaven's name do you have up in your tree?&quot; said Kevin as he stepped down with his new treasure. As he opened his hand the sight of an ornate silver charm with a red Ruby stone in it's center laid before him. A long and thin silver chain was attached and after some looking upon his find he put it over his head. The bobble laid cold against his skin but he knew it was worth a lot and now it was his to keep.<br />
<br />
The jog toward home met with a sports cars which almost ran Kevin over when the driver ran a stop sign. As kevin stumbled and fell in his attempt to get missed he cursed the fool driver. &quot;Damn idiot I hope he meets a truck the next time he does that again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin stood up and whirled around at the loud crash from behind him. There in a steaming wreck was the young man after a five ton box truck hit him broadside. Kevin ran over to the accident and watched the truck driver help the injured man from his smoking car. Kevin gave him one of his business cards and told him to call his office later.<br />
<br />
The rest of the jog was uneventful. Kevin returned to his home tired but ready to shower and head for the office. He was about to leave home when his Cel phone rang. A Mrs. Kelly was on the line being very demanding and wanting a mid morning appointment. After Kevin finally agreed and was on his way the thought of the old bitch caused him to think the worst for her. &quot;Damn her, I wish that old bitch would get humped by her Great Dane, she could use a good screwing!&quot;<br />
<br />
The office was busy and time flew by quickly. Just before noon a call from the Kelloge Hospital announced that Mrs. Kelly was in the hospital as the victim of a dog attack. Kevin interviewed the caller to see if he had a good suit case against the dog's owner. Instead the office person laughed as she explained how when Mrs. Kelly came out of her shower and bent over to dry her feet the family Great Dane jumped her and humped her. The big dog got his knot all the way in and unloaded into the 79 year old lady. The Hospital was keeping her for a day or two but the dog was sent to the local pound.<br />
<br />
Kevin laughed till he remember his off the cuff wish for just such a thing as this to happen. He wondered about the situation so just to test the possiblity he made a second wish that the dog's semen would be enough to make the old lady pregnant.<br />
<br />
A couple of long days passed before the news hit Kevin's desk. It would seem that the Great Dane unloaded so much into the old lady she was going to have puppies. Kevin laughed about the news till a frantic call from Mrs. Kelly when the channel 5 news crew burst into her private room and began to ask how good it felt!<br />
<br />
Late that same day Jennifer Williams the Attorney group's C.S.R. came to Kevin office with a desire for increased wages. Kevin was not helpful in any way shape or form. As Jennifer reminded him that she had worked for the group this last eight years, she tried to show her worth.<br />
<br />
Crying she left Kevin's office and he sat in his big leather judges chair and daydreamed a wish for Jennifer. &quot;Oh you stupid little bitch, I hope find that dream job someplace else, maybe they will pay you what I won't!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was in the middle of evening dinner when Kevin's partner called with an urgent request. &quot;Hey partner you should have agreed with Jennifer's request for more money! Yea, she's quit and was hired by Jeffery, Johnson, &amp; Pride Law firm for twice what we were paying, figure that?&quot; asked Clyde Barrow.<br />
<br />
After dinner Kevin sat alone by the roaring fireplace and pondered his next days without his Customer Service Representitive.</p>
