<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Nat&#39;s new abilities and Connors enchanted armor, the group was beginning to prepare for the final confrontation with Ezekiel Kane. Although they could sense the end approaching, for tonight Nat and Rei found themselves watching the Harris children. &quot;Have fun Mrs. and Mrs. Harris,&quot; Nat called. Mika and Claudia smiled, waving goodbye as the pair now drove off.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Nat asked as Kari now squeezed her leg. &quot;What do you want to do with these three?&quot; After a brief discussion, the teens decided to let the trio of children play in the backyard until dinner arrived.<br />
<br />
Mika and Claudia had been kind enough to order pizza for everyone. The young couple would be attending a business function of Mikas, it started earlier than they thought meaning they hadn&#39;t provided the usual meal for the children. Opting for a couple of pizzas instead,  Mika and Claudia paid in advance knowing the teenage babysitters would have a longer than normal evening. &quot;So when should we give these three a bath,&quot; Rei asked as she watched a four year old Kari race up the slide as her three year old siblings played in the sandbox. &quot;After dinner,&quot; Nat replied. &quot;No reason to clean them up completely beforehand. Which reminds me, how long til the pizza gets here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twenty minutes,&quot; Rei replied as she checked her phone. Nat nodded, a contented smile forming on her face as she listened to Kari laugh. The Harris women, wisely had bought a home at the end of a cul de sac, meaning they had no neighbors behind them. Couple that with a high fence and it allowed the children to assume their anthro forms without fear of being spotted. Nat smiled as the preschooler shifted into a black anthro kit, her fluffy tail swishing behind her as she scaled the ladder of the slide. A joyous giggle escaping her mouth as she sped down. Aaron and Haley had also shifted into their anthro forms, the 3 year olds appearing more like brown anthro cats as they happily dug. &quot;So how much hair do you think will be in the tub after their bath,&quot; Nat smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alot,&quot; Rei laughed. The two teens giggling as they gazed at their charges. It was moments like this that allowed them a momentary relief from everything that had occurred over the past few months. For a moment, things seemed almost normal. Unfortunately, Rei realized that the moment couldn&#39;t last. &quot;So I&#39;ve been wanting to show you something, &quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Nat nodded, studying her girlfriend carefully as she now reached into her book bag. The Asian teen now producing her spell book as well as a small coin. &quot;So after you unlocked your powers and Connor got his armor I started thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thinking about what,&quot; Nat asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Rei started. &quot;As much as I think we&#39;re ready, I realized something. What happens if we&#39;re not all together when we find Kane?&quot; Nat paused, Rei had a point. Yes, she had tapped into her dhamphir nature and Connor had his enchanted armor but, all of their plans involved them working as a team. &quot;Wow that&#39;s actually a good point Rei,&quot; she said. &quot;I hadn&#39;t really thought about that. So what did you come up with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay don&#39;t be mad,&quot; Rei said quickly, confusing her dhamphir girlfriend. &quot;But, I was going through my magic book and then poof I found a spell. Turns out I can enchant an object to kinda of summon us all into one place.&quot; Rei now held up the small coin, Nat noticing a small engraving on the coin. &quot;Thats a great idea Rei,&quot; Nat exclaimed. &quot;So why do you think I would be mad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um here&#39;s the thing,&quot; Rei blushed. &quot;See, I made a bunch of these coins.&quot; Nat raised an eyebrow still not sure where her girlfriend was going. &quot;See, I ran into Connor and gave him and Spark one, then I ran into the Desotos and made sure they had one, then their was Amara, then Sylvia and Tanya, and then Lancelot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait hold on,&quot; Nat said quickly. &quot;Are you telling me I&#39;m the last one?&quot; Rei blushed, a sheepish look on her face as she nodded. &quot;Well that&#39;s okay I guess,&quot; Nat sighed. &quot;I mean you probably just handed then out today and you knew we would see eachother tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I um handed them out a few days ago,&quot; Rei replied meekly.<br />
<br />
&quot;A few days ago!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I finished them over a week ago. I um, kept forgetting too tell you about them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat frowned, watching as her girlfriend turned several different shades of red. &quot;So not only am I the last one to get one but you also forgot to tell me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat sighed, taking a breath before placing her hand on Rei&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Its fine,&quot; she said. &quot;Look we&#39;ve all had alot in our mind. I&#39;m just glad you finally remembered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Nat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But,&quot; Nat smirked. &quot;As punishment you have to give the twins a bath.&quot; Rei groaned, remembering just how much Haley loved to splash in the tub. The last time she had to bathe the toddler, her shoes hadn&#39;t dried out for over a week. &quot;I guess I had that coming, &quot; she sighed. A knock on the front door now drew the teens attention, Nat now rose to her feet as she made her way to the door. &quot;Guess the pizza guy is a little early,&quot; she thought.<br />
<br />
Opening the door, Nat had few thoughts on her mind. Tonight, she would enjoy a quiet evening babysitting. Tomorrow she would deal with Kane. Those plans though were quickly erased as she gazed into the sadistic eyes of Ezekiel Kane. Nat couldn&#39;t react fast enough as the hunter unloaded his shotgun point blank, sending the dhamphir soaring.<br />
<br />
Nat landed hard, coughing up blood immediately. Already she could hear the kids and Rei screaming in fright. &quot;Rock salt,&quot; Kane said. &quot;Won&#39;t kill ya but it&#39;ll hurt like a mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat groaned, it did hurt. Thankfully her vampiric genetics allowed for quick healing. She would be 100% soon but, what would happen to the kids before that. Grunting in pain, she now stood, her eyes beginning to glow. &quot;Rei take the kids and run!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kane paused, raising an eyebrow as the wounded dhamphir now charged. He had hoped to keep the teen down long enough to dispatch the Harris children before torturing the girl. Instead, the teen was shakily back on her feet and looking to fight.<br />
<br />
Kane now withdrew his pistol, looking to finish the dhamphir off instead. As he began to fire, he was surprised to see how fast the girl moved. Scowling in anger, he now looked to strike her, only to be surprised once more as the girl countered his attacks. Somehow she had learned to fight.<br />
<br />
Nat roared, fighting hand to hand with the psychopathic hunter. Blocking a punch, the dhamphir now delivered a powerful roundhouse kick, knocking Kane into a wall. Although he remained on his feet, he found himself wincing from the strike as he wiped his mouth. The hunter&#39;s eyes widening in surprise as he now noticed his own blood. &quot;Kid,&quot; he growled. &quot;I&#39;m going to enjoy watching you die.&quot;<br />
<br />
Whether they were ready or not the fight with Ezekiel Kane had finally begun.</p>
