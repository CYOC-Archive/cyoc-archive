<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was having a blast growing some of the guys in the gym with his awesome, cool power. He enjoyed the fact that he could just focus on anyone, make a silent wish, and just watch as their muscles inflated, turning any skinny dude into a pro bodybuilder in a matter of seconds! It gave Ty a massive hardon just watching unsuspecting guys, who otherwise would never gain a pound of muscle, become massive muscle men in a matter of seconds. Something which would normally take years would only take a few moments, and these guys would become huge in just a few seconds while Ty had the pleasure of watching their muscles grow before his very eyes. It was a major rush for him! <br />
<br />
So, Ty just wandered around the gym, looking for those guys who were too fat, too short, too skinny or too young to gain any muscle at all. Those were the ones who were the most fun to grow, of course. As he strolled into the locker room, he spotted Skylar, who just came out of the shower. He was only wearing a towel around his waist as he strolled towards his locker to retrieve his clothes. <br />
<br />
Skylar was short and lean with long, blond hair and bright, blue eyes. He was a year younger than Ty, at age 14, and about two inches shorter, standing about 5-foot-4 inches tall. He was very average and he had no muscle on him at all. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Sky! What are you doing here?” Ty asked him as he spotted the blond boy walking from the shower area towards the lockers. <br />
<br />
“Yo, Ty! I didn’t know you were a member of this gym! What’s up?” Skylar asked him. <br />
<br />
“I asked you first!” Ty insisted as he folded his arms. <br />
<br />
“Uhmm… I just had my birthday and my dad gave me a gym membership as a gift since I was always at home playing video games. The gym was running special promotion, so he took advantage of that. So, now I must go three times per week when mom comes to run on the treadmill. So… here I am!” he sighed. <br />
<br />
“I’m here just checking out the buff dudes!” Ty grinned. “I guess I can look forward to seeing you become big and buff one of these days, right?” <br />
<br />
“Don’t count on it, dude…” Skylar sighed. “I’ve always been a twig. I can’t see myself packing on muscle any time soon…” he said in a sad tone of voice. <br />
<br />
“Why not? Just put some effort into it! Come on!” Ty insisted. <br />
<br />
“I did! I tried some dumbbells and I worked out on some of the machines. But, it’s gonna take me years to gain a few pounds of muscle!” Skylar moaned. <br />
<br />
“What if… You were a muscle dude right now? Today? Would you encourage other guys to work out with you?” Ty asked him. <br />
<br />
“Like, now? If I were a muscle guy right now? Uhh… Yeah! I mean… Why not?” Skylar shrugged. <br />
<br />
“Okay! Drop the towel on the floor, dude!” Ty commanded. <br />
<br />
Skylar just shrugged as he let go of the bath towel and stood before Ty, buck naked. He wasn’t very impressive, since he was short and skinny. His only nice feature was his long, blond, straight gold-colored hair. <br />
<br />
Ty made his silent wish as he looked his friend over. Then he glanced at him with a wide grin on his face. <br />
<br />
Skylar’s thin legs started to bulge with thick, hard muscle. His calves ballooned out from the back of his legs, growing into large mounds of muscle which were now completely covered in veins. Sky could immediately feel that something was changing about his body as he felt his weight increase. Furthermore, his quads began to fill out as they widened dramatically with tight, firm columns of muscle. Big, thick, vertical columns of muscle formed between the waist and the knees, as his quads became extremely wide, like those of an Olympic marathon runner. His hamstrings followed suit, growing hard and thick. His buttocks filled out as well as his legs changed from thin chicken legs to those belonging to a professional cyclist or soccer player. <br />
<br />
“Whoa!!! What’s going on? What happened to my legs?” Skylar gasped as he looked down at his legs while standing before the mirror which was hanging from the wall. <br />
<br />
“I’m just getting started, big guy!” Ty chuckled, clearly enjoying the show as he watched the muscle growth continue Skylar’s upper body. <br />
<br />
Next, Skylar’s torso widened by at least six inches as his flat stomach was suddenly covered with thick rows and columns of well-defined abdominal muscles. His torso was now filled out like a washboard and resembled a tiled kitchen wall, with solid, rectangular buttons placed over his stomach which were separated by deep grooves between them. His abs were like a brick wall! <br />
<br />
Immediately above his abdominal muscles, Skylar’s flat chest suddenly inflated like there was no tomorrow. In a matter of seconds, he suddenly sported two large pectorals, like big soccer balls, which were round and hard. The large pecs made his chest and shoulders bigger, deeper and much wider. His shoulders were twice as wide as his waist, giving him a very impressive V-taper which all bodybuilders crave. Skylar’s back also grew into a large mass of muscle, from his waist up to his shoulders. He grew one large slab of muscle which resembled a big slab of concrete. It was thick, hard and super strong! <br />
<br />
Finally, Skylar’s arms inflated with incredible muscle, with his arms growing massive triceps, biceps and bowling-pin forearms. His arms were completely covered with thick, long veins. His biceps were large mounds of muscle on his arms, which were now even bigger than bowling balls. His triceps were shaped like horseshoes, making his arms truly thick and massive! <br />
<br />
As the growth spurt ended, Skylar could only stand there and flex his huge arms as he studied his reflection in the mirror. He felt a surge of strength and power he had never felt in his life! He was truly a young, teenage bodybuilder as he stood before Ty, who was fully enjoying the show as he witnessed the entire growth spurt as it unfolded before him. <br />
<br />
“So, are you happy now?” Ty grinned. “Are you big and strong enough?” <br />
<br />
“What happened? What did you DO to me?” Skylar uttered as he flexed his arms and then his massive quads. He couldn’t believe how much his body had changed in just a minute. He felt bloated and heavy and strong. “I’m BIG!” <br />
<br />
“Here! You better wear some Spandex, big guy!” Ty laughed, as he waved his hand. Instantly, Skylar was wearing Spandex pants, which covered his groin. <br />
<br />
“Dude! I feel so strong! Thank you SO much!” Skylar smiled, as he put on a tank top and shoes. Ty and Skylar then walked out of the locker room, as Sky took time to flex and stop before every mirror. <br />
<br />
“So, you got any friends we should buff up?” Ty asked his big, buffed-up friend. <br />
<br />
Skylar rested his big arm on Ty’s shoulder. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know how you did it, but you made me into a big muscle guy! I got a few friends in the gym who could use your help! Let me point them out…” Skylar smiled as he pointed out a friend in the gym….</p>
