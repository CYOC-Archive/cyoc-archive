<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty winces and pulls away from the rat, resenting the way that he pushed right up into his face. &quot;The ring&#39;ll do fine,&quot; he mutters, glancing away from the intruder. He&#39;s had his eye on that ring since he first arrived. It was a real beauty, as it happens- a neat band of gold, embedded with tiny black jewels across the width. It shone brightly even in the dim light of the vault, and for some reason, Ty just feels...magnetized towards it. &quot;Give me the ring, and you can grab whatever you want.&quot;<br />
If the rat was disappointed that Ty chose against a quick fuck, he doesn&#39;t show it. He chuckles and turns away, striding over to the pedestal on the far side of the room. Careful to touch it only with the paw covered in the leather glove, the rat-man scoops up the ring and tosses it over to Ty. &quot;Have fun, kid.&quot;<br />
Ty catches the ring in his bare palm, and a jolt of energy runs through him. Adrenaline begins to pump in his veins and he feels a new, unrestrained excitement rushing in his blood, making him almost bounce off the walls. At the peak of all that energy, he can&#39;t resist. He plucks the ring up in his fingertips and slides it over his index finger. The ring feels loose at first, but quickly tightens, clenching around the bone. Ty lets out a little gasp, and the world fades to black.<br />
<br />
Ty opens his eyes in some kind of void. Nothingness surrounds him on all sides, reaching out into infinity. Before him is a woman. She&#39;s gliding in the air, arms outstretched to each side and her hair fanning out beside her, almost as if she was floating on the surface of a lake. She appears to be some kind of elf, with pointed ears and a lean form, and she stands quite tall, around six feet or so. Her eyes are closed, but she twitches every so often, as if she was experiencing an unpleasant dream.<br />
A MORTAL ENTERS THE FOLD. A powerful voice thuds through the void, seemingly emerging from nowhere. Perhaps it only exists in Ty&#39;s mind. It&#39;s quite deep, but feminine, and layered with power and magic. I THANK YOU, MY CHILD. I WILL ENJOY THIS BODY. Anxiety wells up in Ty&#39;s throat, and, when he tries to speak, it catches, almost leaving him choking on air.<br />
The elf woman&#39;s eyes flash open. Rather than natural eyes, within her eye sockets are two empty voids of darkness. Her expression, once sincere and restful, twists into a cruel smirk. CARE TO SEE WHAT I&#39;M DOING WITH IT?<br />
The world around Ty fades once more.<br />
<br />
When he opens his eyes, he&#39;s back in the vault, just as he was before. The same lighting, the same jeweled artifacts around him, everything the same. Except him. Ty has a chance to glance over himself, and he barely surpasses a gasp of surprise.<br />
He&#39;s still wearing the same white robes, but the body underneath has been completely transformed to the spirit&#39;s whims. In fact, he&#39;s now a perfect clone of the elf woman he&#39;d seen in his dreams: tall, thin, with long, flowing hair and pale skin. He feels the weight of her breasts against his chest, and the dampness between his thighs, and suppresses another shudder.<br />
But he doesn&#39;t have control over his body, not anymore. He&#39;s seeing through his eyes, and feeling through his senses, but he isn&#39;t choosing what he&#39;s doing. His body works on autopilot, rapidly stripping his white robes from his elegant female form and letting them drop to the floor.<br />
I&#39;M GOING TO ENJOY THIS, MY CHILD, the voice thunders in Ty&#39;s head once more. HOW I&#39;VE MISSED HAVING A BODY!<br />
Ty feels his body falling onto all fours, right there in the middle of the vault. His fingers slip between his legs and began to gently stroke over his new pussy, teasing his lips and spreading them apart between two fingertips. &quot;Come on, rat-boy.&quot; His tongue twists to spell out the words, but Ty certainly didn&#39;t want to say them... but there they are, nonetheless.<br />
The musk in the room grows far stronger as the rat positions himself behind Ty&#39;s new form, and his thick cock presses against the lips of his pink pussy. &quot;You know, I think I like you quite a bit better this way,&quot; the rat grunts under his breath. His paws grapple on Ty&#39;s hips as he drives forward, sinking his hairy cock deep into Ty&#39;s supple passage.<br />
The former wizard lets out a loud, slutty moan. The sensation of that fat shaft driving deep into his cunt, stretching him wider with each thrust and sending jolts of pleasure across his body. &quot;Yes, yes, make me your filthy slut.&quot; Ty feels himself making the words, and hears himself saying them, but that doesn&#39;t prevent the overwhelming sense of humiliation running through him when he does. The rat doesn&#39;t seem to mind, as he begins thrusting faster and faster. Heavy, furry balls slap heavily against Ty&#39;s pink lips at the bottom of every thrust, and soon, Ty feels himself arching his back in his first female orgasm.<br />
Not long after, the rat accelerates and lets out a deep, husky growl. He buries his entire fat cock deep in Ty&#39;s pussy. The possessed wizard can even feel the veins on the shaft as it tenses and flexes within him before his womb is flooded with rat-cum, rope after rope released deep in his slutty cunt. The rat collapses atop him, and Ty&#39;s new form goes down shortly afterward, laying peacefully on the stone floor.<br />
I OUGHT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR BODY, CHILD, the voice echoes within Ty&#39;s mind once more. I&#39;LL TREAT IT WELL, I PROMISE. PERHAPS IN A CENTURY OR TWO, SOMEONE WILL COME ALONG AND PICK YOU UP AS WELL. Alarm rages in Ty&#39;s mind as he feels left hand reach over to his right. His heart begins to pound as his body grasps his ring, and then pulls it off.<br />
As soon as it&#39;s removed, Ty loses every one of his former body&#39;s senses. He can&#39;t smell the musk, can&#39;t feel the cum dribbling out of his cunt or the scrawny rat on his back. Instead, he now perceives only the ring. He IS the ring. He has a small bit of vision around it- that is, he can still see the rat and the elven woman collapsed together- and can hear their foggy murmuring, but altogether, he&#39;s shut out.<br />
<br />
The elf who possessed his body places the ring back on its original pedestal. There, Ty remains. For how long, he couldn&#39;t say. Months? Years? Centuries? Occasionally, the vampire witch will enter to take this artifact or that, or some clumsy servant will come in to polish, just as he did. But his new form- the ring- is untouched.<br />
That is, until one fateful day.</p>
