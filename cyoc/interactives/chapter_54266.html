<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Angrily, Miggs slammed the thick hardwood door to the tower prison shut being Eodor, having just instructed the orcs to guard from intruders coming up from inside the twisted stone fortress of Kesseck.  She had closed her eyes, breathing a sigh of relief… but found upon reopening them the jade scaled feminine hands of the succubus that she had become only hours before.  Slowly she leaned her head against the door and thought to cry, her smallish breasts pressing against the door as she did so.  Wings dropping down, she could do nothing but consider again all the different ways the two former men might die in this place.</p>

<p>At that, Miggs looked back at Eodor.  She was not nearly as tall as Miggs was, surely only five and a half or so tall.  Over her petite frame she wore a lavish dress of a deeply blood red cloth with crimson trim that pushed up her average breasts.  Her pale face was framed by long wavy red hair that fell partly over her shoulders down her front as well as nearly to the small of her back.  Had Miggs still been a man, she would have found the appearance of this mid-twenties looking woman very attractive.  Dark red lips, narrow nose, soft cheekbones and jade-colored eyes… she was very, very becoming.</p>

<p>"How good are orc ears?" Miggs asked, pushing herself away from the door and unflattening her breasts.  Scratching her head, her tail flicked back and forth behind her in agitation.  Eodor looked back at Miggs as he sighed, thinking much of Miggs as she had of her.  With that tight, black, leather corset over her front and a thong that left nothing to the imagination… Eodor considered that had she been male and had <i>this</i> still not been a true demon, that she would consider her quite attractive.  Of course, she was held back by the thoughts of her secret lover… What would they think of Eodor now, he wondered.</p>

<p>"Some of the worst there is," Eodor finally answered, stepping over to the bed and sitting down.  She tossed the lower portion of the dress over to the side as she sat down on the fluffy sheets.  "We should be able to speak freely here, what good it will do us."</p>

<p>Miggs nodded, leaning forward and taking her butt off the door as she'd been leaning on it still.  "Good, my prince," she said in a tone that was quite seductive, perhaps by accident.  As she moved forward from the door over to the window, her body swayed with her hips and her tail, in a very sexual manner.  Unaware of how she was appearing, Miggs leaned forward out the window to look around, showing her firm round ass towards Eodor.  "And I see no eavesdroppers outside," she said, not looking back at him.  "We must escape… but there are so many questions."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure who's predicament is more pressing… yours, or mine," Eodor sighed, turning her eyes away from Miggs rump.  "We must save my father, it is true… but if you are indeed going to go through the Time of Enchantment… your mind could be lost sooner than later," she said, putting a hand on her head, thinking it over.</p>

<p>Miggs looked up and outside the window for a long time.  There was a deep chasm that went so far down as to be without end, its true depth being clouded over in a thick gray mist.  Upwards were cliff sides reaching up and beyond thick gray clouds where Miggs knew he had fallen down from earlier.  Somewhere up above was stone cliff, and sure enough a bridge that would have lead him back towards a portal to Earth.  Meanwhile, the tower itself was one of the tallest points of the fortress of Kesseck, a heavily fortified and twisted looking stone creation made by demons long since gone from the world.</p>

<p>Miggs looked over her shoulder, still not aware of her stance at the window.  "What is the Time of Enlightenment, if I may ask?" she wondered, watching Eodor look over to her and blink her eyes.  Migg's tail, pointed like a spearhead at the end, flicked back and forth as she waited for his reply.</p>

<p>"It is a luckily rare event," Eodor began.  "There are many kinds of Succubi, but very few are ever seen outside of the World of Chaos."</p>

<p>"I would say so," Miggs considered, looking back out the window.  "I've only seen those that steal mens souls… and thankfully never first-hand."</p>

<p>"Therein lies the rub.  Only those succubi that go through the Time of Enchantment become the seducers you commonly see back in the lands of Earth," Eodor revealed.  Miggs, for her part, lowered her head somewhat in defeat, her tail twitching in agitation.  "When it happens, a succubi retains much of who they are, but they go through a dramatic personality shift.  Their every movement instinctually turns seductive in nature… from the way they walk and talk to the way they eat their food… even to the decorations of the nests they wish to call their home," Eodor explained.  "Their natural bodies shift slightly exaggerated, with large breasts, narrow waists, long wiry tails, wide, <i>strong</i> wings and big horns off of their heads… often black and spiraled like a rams.  But," she said, standing up and walking over to where Miggs was at the window, "They also gain the ability to appear as the woman a selected man most desires.  If this <i>were</i> to happen to you, you would be able to appear normal among humans… if the worse came to worse and we could not return you to how you were, my friend."</p>

<p>"My situation is not the priority, my prince.  We must free you from this cage and save your father.  Your safety is my life," Miggs said, looking at Eodor and finally standing up.  "We must also find a way to turn you back to normal.  Perhaps Hector Strom of the fire plains, or the sorceress of the wetlands?  She owes your family favors, does she not?" she asked, looking down at her.</p>

<p>"Indeed," Eodor nodded.  "From the times of my great grandfather&#151;" she said, then slapped a hand over her mouth.  "By the Devine Spirit.  My great grandfather… Eodor Peacecraft the Third… his brother was Henry Peacecraft," she said, taking her hand away from her mouth.  "<i>Henry</i> went missing when he sought glory in the World of Chaos.  I <i>wonder</i>… do you think that succubus you'd butted heads with could be <i>him</i>?"</p>

<p>"At this point, anything is possible.  She mentioned her loyalty to Igna after the Gift of Eternal Life."  Miggs put a finger to her lip and pouted a bit, thinking aloud.  "She's not a seducer, though.  Her appearance is proof enough of that," Miggs said, matter-of-factly.  "I wonder what deal was struck to allow her to live for ever.  It must have had enough sway to turn her away from humanity forever… but perhaps her wish for <i>you</i> to be unguarded was a stab at Igna after all these years?"</p>

<p>"Or she knows that I am well versed in my family history and perhaps would discover it was her… and tell tales of her betrayal to my family," Eodor offered.  "Regardless, back to the task at hand.  We should remove ourselves from this tower before Henry comes to check on me tonight.  We must merely pray to the Devine Spirit that if you <i>are</i> going to go through the Time of Enchantment, that it can wait until we're far from this place."</p>

<p>"Agreed," Miggs nodded.  "Though, on the positive side, as a succubus can only drain the life-force from a man in <i>willing</i> sex, and you are a woman currently… you have nothing to fear from me in that regard should that happen," she said, placing a hand on Eodor's shoulder with a smile to her.  "But fear not… we will find a way to cure your condition <i>and</i> a way to <i>kill</i> Igna shortly thereafter.  I will be with you until then, no matter how long it takes" Miggs said confidently, nodding to Eodor.</p></p>
