<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Evan was a geek and a nerd and he got reminded about that on a daily basis. Evan was a prime target for bullies of all sizes, shapes and genders.<br />
Evan had shoulder length greasy dirty blond hair. He wore skin tight khakis that fit tight to his  skinny 5&#39;11 frame.  His shirt was of his favorite anime show that was a size too small for his frame. Lifting up and showing his hairless belly anytime he moved his arms. His interest went from comic books and manga to magic. He always had an interest in magic, so when the new magic shop opened he knew he had to browse the aisles. <br />
<br />
After school one day he came by the magic shop and walked in this was only like his 8th visit and he knew the old man who ran the shop. He came to a bargain bin in there were all sorts of prtoduct in it from wands that were marked down to a dollar to light switch covers. Thats when he saw something that felt weird to be in the bargain bin because it was a complete set. The Magical Friendship Bracelet Kit. He picked up as if drawn to it. He read the back description you could make as many friendship bracelets as you want and once you give it to someone they will instantly become your best friend solely devoted to you.<br />
Interested to see how it worked, Evan took it to the counter and asked how it was. The shop owner said &quot;Very interesting&quot;as he looked at the box. &quot;Do you need a friend, boy?&quot; Evan answered &quot;I don&#39;t have any friends so maybe some magic could help. How much is it?&quot; The shop owner didn&#39;t see a price tag, so he said &quot; How does $9.99 sound. Evan pulled out a twenty and the deal was made.<br />
He quickly got home and read the instructions on how to make the bracelet.<br />
He knew the best target to see if this thing really worked.<br />
<br />
Sam Reynolds was the star of the baseball team at 6&#39;2, you couldn&#39;t miss him.  Until high school he was a pitcher but switched to shortstop because his batting swing was just as impressive. He was also Evan biggest tomentor. He made sure daily to let Evan know how low on the totem pole he was. <br />
When Sam got to school on Monday he went to his locker and on was a bracelet taped to the door. He wasn&#39;t much for cheesy cheap jewelry, but if it was from Sarah the girl he was persuing, hopefully him wear would be a sign that things would turn up. <br />
Sam put on the bracelet and immediately something changed all his thoughts and devotions turn to one person, he considered be his best friend. Someone that he would anything for and that was Evan.<br />
<br />
Later in that day Evan was in the bathroom when he heard the fimiliar voice of his former tormentor.&quot;EVANNN!&quot; <br />
Evan looked up and there stood Sam. &quot;Dude, bud I have been looking for you all day. I just wanted to thank you for this friendship bracelet, it is the best gift, anyone as thoughtful, caring and loving as you could give me. I just want you to know I am truly and solely devoted to you.&quot;<br />
Evan hearing this speech couldn&#39;t believe that it worked. Was this some kinda trick did Sam know he put it on his locker and was mocking him. Evan&#39;s heart was beating fast, when he asked Sam to do the one thing he knew Sam would never do with another guy. &quot;If you are truly devoted to me, Sam kissed me.&quot; After slight hesitation Sam leaned in and gave Evan his first kiss ever. <br />
After an eternity the boys broke off their kiss. For both it was the most amazing either had ever felt. Evan couldn&#39;t believe it worked this wasn&#39;t some trick, he now had a new friend and maybe more. Evan wanted to experiment more but knew they needed to get back to class. He told Sam to meet him at his house after baseball practice.<br />
<br />
Sam had a horrible baseball practice all his thoughts were on his new best friend  Evan. He couldn&#39;t wait to spend more time hanging out with him. He was so distracted he also got nailed with the ball a few times and his batting was  atrocious. The coach benches him for the rest of practice.  Thankfully practice finally ended and he was out and dressed before anyone asked him what was up.<br />
<br />
At 6:30, he got to Evans house and was greeted by his best friend. Evan took him to his room. Sam was soo honored to be in the presence of his true friend. Evan had been working hard studying what these magical bracelets could do. He asked Sam, &quot;Would you do anything for me?&quot; He immediately said &quot;YES!&quot; Evan spent the next few hours telling Sam what his true best friend would look like and act like. At 9 Sam left a changed boy both physically and personality wise<br />
<br />
<br />
The next day, Evan was waiting for his new friend to pick him up for school and at exactly 730, the new and improved Sam pulled up.  He came to the door as any good friend should, wearing tight jeans that hugged every bit of his lower half with his ankles showing which means they are probably his younger brothers. He had one pale pink crop top with barbie boi written in glitter pink. His hair was blonde with every shade of the rainbow highlighted in it and only a trained eye could see the hint of make up he was wearing. Evan reached the door and was greeted by a friendly kiss which was way longer than a friendly kiss should be. The boys got in Sam&#39;s car and headed to school.<br />
<br />
Once there all eyes were on Evan and his new friend. The boys walked into school with stars from every corner. Evan who is usually more self conscious, walked with a certain pride. The boys gave each other another friendly kiss and headed to their classes. Evan mostly stayed unbothered and ignored. While Sam was immediately questioned about his new look and apparently attitude towards Evan. He kept repeating how Evan was the greatest that happened in his life and how he was loyal and devoted only to Evan. Sam got a call to go see his baseball coach and explain himself. After the meeting it was decided that Sam the promising high school prospect would no longer be apart of the baseball team. Sam didn&#39;t seem upset in fact he was thinking of it as more time to hang with Evan.  <br />
<br />
Later that Day a new friend had found a woven bracelet on his locker.</p>
