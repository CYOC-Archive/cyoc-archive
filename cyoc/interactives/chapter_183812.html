<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave puts the keys into the ignition and begins to back out of the driveway. His workplace isn&#39;t that far, maybe 30 minutes at the most. As he makes it onto the interstate he feels safe enough to dial up your teacher. The phone begins to ring...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
Dave - &quot;Uhh, yes this is David Rothstone, I&#39;m a friend of one of your students. I&#39;m calling in to tell you that he won&#39;t be able to come in today, he&#39;s umm... In the hospital...<br />
&quot;-gasp-! Oh no! What happened is he okay?!&quot;<br />
Dave - &quot;Oh yeah, he&#39;s fine just a really bad case of the flu... He won&#39;t be in for a week or so. I dove him to the hospital last night.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well I hope he gets better soon! By the way, umm sorry to bother you about this but which student was it that you were calling in for?&quot;<br />
Dave - &quot;(tells her your name).&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay thank you, I do hope your friend gets well soon!&quot;<br />
Dave - &quot;thank you.&quot;<br />
Dave hangs up the phone and lets out a deep sigh. &quot;I hope he does too...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave pulls into work at his studio job working for an advertisement firm where he designs various graphics for several dozen clients and products. It&#39;s below an artists talent like him but it pays well and keeps the lights on. Dave then checks in at the front desk where he gets heckled a bit by the clerk about being a few minutes tardy, but brushes it off and goes to his desk and gets to work.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile back inside the blank scene, you are just sitting there looking out into the empty apartment. You look to your left and then to your right, seeing the border of the canvas your stuck in, then look back at the half-eaten painted pizza Dave painted for you last night. Besides you, its the only thing in your scene. You ponder there for a moment about what do to. &quot;It would be great if I could paint my scene myself so I could have something to do...&quot; <br />
You lazily lean over still sitting on nothing in the scene and make your way over to the painted pepperoni to your right. You then stick your fingers in it. You feel a sensational jolt start tingling up your fingers and down your arm as you dip your fingers in the paint, the sensation makes you gasp and fall down on your belly as the pleasurable tingling runs down your spine and feels like it slows in your pelvis and fades down your legs. You then remember how it made you feel to eat a piece of the pizza, there&#39;s still 7 slices left in there, including the one you dipped your fingers in. You then reverse your vision so that its seeing your full scene again and blocking out the outside world and admire your fingers. From the knuckle down they are painted red like tomato sauce, you shake your hand a bit trying to see if it will come off. Your hand begins to tingle again with those sensational jolts, almost like its that pins-and-needles numb feeling as the nerves are waking up but it hasn&#39;t become painful yet, and the pain never comes. You manage to shake the painted tomato paste off your hand and notice how it seems to have just splattered onto the canvas around where you shook your hand. You then start to admire your hand again, and notice your finger seem... painted... like, for reals, painted... Not the hyper realistic &quot;I&#39;m a painting but not really, photo look&quot; you have to the rest of your body, your fingers on your right hand look legitimately like they were painted into existence up to the knuckle... And they are hyper sensitive. Any movement you make with them tingles with that ecstatic exciting feeling that sends faint shivers of pleasure up your arm. <br />
<br />
You continue to admire your fingers, almost getting getty about the feeling in your right hand but stop for a bit to think about what you should do next. You giggle to yourself as you begin to ponder the ideas running through your head...<br />
<br />
Dave however is still at work, focusing hard on his work and occasionally peeking up at the clock to check the time. He can&#39;t get off his mind as he draws on the large paper in front of him about that dream he had about you last night. How you seemed so... happy... inside of a painted world... yet here he is drawing and painting for work for some faceless corpo that just wants their banner ad for their latest and greatest product for the next three months until they come up with something else, and he&#39;ll probably be the one to draft the design for that too... Dave&#39;s concentration his broken for a minute as his phone rings on his desk. Dave moves to pick up the phone and answers it. Its your art teacher again.<br />
<br />
Dave - &quot;H-hello?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah, hi yes is this David?&quot;<br />
Dave - &quot;Yes, how can I help you today?&quot;<br />
&quot;Umm, yes David, you called me earlier about a student of mine who was needing to call out sick?&quot;<br />
Dave - &quot;Oh yeah, sorry I didn&#39;t recognize you right away, I&#39;m fairly busy with work right now. Is something up?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh sorry to bother you while your at work. Hmm, well... I&#39;ve looked through my student records and I was having some trouble finding that name you mentioned, can you tell me your friends name again? I have the student registrar here pulled up in front of me.&quot;<br />
Dave pauses for a moment then mutters to himself away from the phone. &quot;What the fuck...?&quot; Dave then goes back to the phone and keeps talking, telling her your name again.<br />
&quot;Hmm, let me see here... Strange I don&#39;t have him written down here, but I do know who your talking about. It&#39;s okay, I&#39;ll write it in here at the bottom. About how long did you say they were going to be out of school?&quot;<br />
Dave - &quot;About a week or so ma&#39;am. Sorry but I&#39;m a bit busy here at work, can I talk to you later? I can call you back during my lunch break.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh okay, that&#39;s no problem. I just needed to know so I can prepare their work for when they get back. Were studying the Mona Lisa in class today. Talk to you later!&quot; She hangs up the phone.<br />
<br />
Dave then puts the phone away and takes a deep breath. &quot;How did she not have his name written down? He told me last week he was one of her favorite students...&quot; Dave then hears his boss coming down the hall and quickly snaps back to his work.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back in 2D land...<br />
You stop giggling to yourself as you now know what do to. You decide to dip your entire right hand into the painted pizza pie. As your hand slides into the pie, the sensation from before is slightly stronger making to let out a cute tickled noise and pause momentarily with your hand in the pizza before quickly taking it out. You then decide to take your painted sauce covered hand and rub the sause on your other hand and up your arms. the sensation gets even stronger making you blush and lead out quick quiet muffled moans of joy as you try to hold your mouth shut to prevent yourself from busting out laughing from the enjoyable tickling sensation running up your arms and down your spine into your legs. You then quickly shake the pizza sauce off and admire your arms from the elbow down. They look 100% painted... Like for real... You can even see a faint outline around your hands as if they were inked before coloring and your forearms have no hair on them, only faint brushstrokes to make it look like they have hair. Every movement of your fingers is bliss, and your starting to get excited. &quot;This is freakin&#39; amazing!&quot; <br />
<br />
You then look at your clothes and begin to ponder if you should try and see if they become fully painted too, they are pretty generic so maybe not? You wonder if perhaps you should take them off... or see if you can... You then realize that if when you ate the painted pizza it made you feel like your hands feel now did it turn your insides into paint too? You gotta see now, and begin to quickly take off your shirt, tossing it aside in the scene. The shirt suspending in air on the canvas as you let go. You quickly glance at the shirt and realize it didn&#39;t fall to the ground like normal, but shrug and assume its because your inside a 2D space. &quot;Not like gravity works here anyways... Oh well!&quot; You then look down at your belly... Its smooth... like, really smooth... as a matter of fact, your chest isn&#39;t very detailed at all! Not even nipples! Its just flat color like the rest of your skin! <br />
<br />
Awed and gawking at your flat colored chest as if it was a simple drawing, you put your left hand up to your belly, the sensations making you smile and try not to bust out giggling until your hand moves over your belly and you let out a huge gasp and fall over, its soooo sensitive, like your on ecstasy or something, it sends all kinds of joy throughout your body to feel paint on paint like this. You roll over laughing inside the scene, its just too much and take your hand away from your belly. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile back at the office, Dave&#39;s bosses all leave to go to the upstairs meeting hall. Now that Dave has a moment unsupervised, he decides to look up on his phone about that canvas and what happens if a person is shoved inside. He digs through page after page of fictional writing and photos of various people being turned into paintings, some more family friendly, others... not safe for work... until he finally finds on an old website that looks like its from the early 2000s taking about a blank magic canvas that can be used to turn things into paintings.<br />
Dave reads through the creepy pasta-like writing of the website and how it describes how one man got his girlfriend stuck inside the scene. There is no author to the writing, stating it was posted by an anonymous source and really does just come across as one of those early 2ks creep stories that float around on the dark web, but this was Dave&#39;s best bet on what is going to happen to his friend.<br />
The website is very detailed about what happened, how she went in and then was able to be pulled out just like any other object, but couldn&#39;t get out by herself. Dave keeps reading as the two of them began to experiment with the strange blank canvas over the next couple of days until ultimately someone tried to add something to the scene for their partner to play with, this time it being the guy who was inside the painting, and that after interacting with it, he was completely unable to leave and at the whim of his wife, now his artist... The next couple of days were even more disturbing, as people began to have a hard time remembering him and the more painted he became by his girlfriends attempts to get him out, the more people began to remember him as a... actual painting... eventually she tried painting over his whole body, completely turning her boyfriend into an actual painting and as a result he completely ceased all movement. panicked she tried to pull him out, and to her surprise he did come out, but he wasn&#39;t the same... he was a painted life-sized figurine of himself or as she had painted him and had the physical characteristics to his body as if he was made of elastic dry paint, similar to latex in a way and appeared as if he was a 3D model done in graphical rendering, as if someone had brought a cartoon to life. Panicked she begged him to come back to life, and screamed as he began to move again, and remembered everything, saying how he had never been better but strangely thanked her for recreating him as a painting. Dave continues reading as then he tried the reverse on his wife with the same level of success, both of them now literal living paintings but outside of this creepy-pasta record of their interactions with the cursed painting, no one remembers them as anything other than just a painting. It ends one of them writing on how they are both about to leap into a regular painting they loved the most and embrace each other so they can stay in 2D forever. The story ends there.<br />
<br />
Dave&#39;s eyes go wide as he sits there speechless about what he just read. Remembering how your teacher was struggling to remember you. He then remembers that he painted a pizza into your scene for you to... eat... &quot;Oh no...&quot; Dave then hears the door to the upstairs office open, the bosses are out of their meeting and about to go back and start hall monitoring the employees again. Dave quickly puts away his phone and tries to act calm as he goes back to work. ~I need to get home immediately and let him know whats happening...~<br />
<br />
Meanwhile...<br />
You start calm down and begin to wonder if your cartoonishly drawn naked torso was an act of the pizza you ate or a result from removing your shirt, either way, only one way to find out... You begin to untie your shoe laces and then toss them off to the side, your shoes freezing in &quot;mid air&quot; in the canvas as if they were just left on the page. You then begin to pull off your socks too so you can get a good look at your feet. There smooth too! Not even toes! Just the overall shape of a foot in your flat skin tone... like your foot is a sock! You stare at your feet for a while, and then bend over to rub your left foot with your hands. It tingles but it isn&#39;t the big rush of enjoyment you had when touching your belly. &quot;Okay, so it&#39;s gotta be my removed clothes that make me look this way... so the sensitivity is...&quot; You stop as you realize that it must be your insides are now paint too, or at least your digestive tract is... You then grin really big and start giggling. You&#39;ve always wanted to be a real piece of art, and now&#39;s your chance! But before you can enact your master plan, there&#39;s one last place to check, as you look down at your pants... <br />
<br />
Carefully you begin to remove them and notice your legs are also done up in that flat smooth style like a cartoon too... Your almost afraid to look but at the same time somewhat excited about what your going to see as you carefully begin to remove your underwear too, while your underwear and pants were bulged from the erection you had when you were shoved into the painting, you close your eyes and remove your underwear, you don&#39;t want to open them yet, you fully take off your underwear and toss it aside making it freeze in place in the scene and then... you open your eyes and see.... Its smooth too! Like, nothing! like a flat simple colored drawing! You reach down and touch your crotch, its sensitive, but not any more than your feet were... You then turn around to get a look at your backside, no ass crack either! You give it a rub too and its just as sensitive as the rest of you that isn&#39;t painted. You then roll over again so your facing front side again and lay down next to the smushed pizza surrounded by your removed clothes and you begin to start thinking... &quot;What if... I covered my whole body in this tomato paste...&quot; You begin to start giggling and like the idea quite greatly... and then start painting...<br />
<br />
 Meanwhile back at Daveland...<br />
Dave is really starting to worry about leaving you back at his house alone all day. He keeps watching the clock until its his lunch break. As soon as it hits 1:30 pm, he grabs his phone and calls up your teacher.<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
Dave - &quot;Hello ma&#39;am, its David again.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh hi David, is something wrong? I was just about to call you.&quot;<br />
Dave - &quot;Oh, what for?&quot; Dave says sounding a bit worried.<br />
&quot;Well David, I decided to look up that name you gave me and I remembered why it sounded so familiar... You see, I vaguely remember how last month our class was studying into several various styles of art and I remember that name you mentioned back during my lessons, I think it was one of the works of art from then but I can&#39;t exactly place where it was from, or who made it or what it was...&quot;<br />
Dave then drops his phone... His face gone pale. The teacher keeps calling out to Dave asking if he is there, saying hello over and over, he then shaking, picks up the phone and quickly apologies to the teacher and hangs up... &quot;So that old story must be true... I need to get home!&quot; Dave then rockets out of his office, only briefly getting stopped by his boss asking him where he is going, he rushes past him saying that he left something on the stove and the fire alarm is going off, he&#39;ll be back later. Dave then races to his car and fumbles with the keys. &quot;Come on, come on comeon!&quot; He then manages to start his car and nearly rams it into one of his co-workers cars as he panic-backs out of the lot and takes off speeding, trying to get home ASAP.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile back in your painting, your completely lost to your glorious mess you&#39;ve made. You got tomato paste all over you and are rubbing it in furiously all over with the pizza tin upside down on your head, cheese and sauce and pepperoni running down your hair and face. Your half-passed crazed and beyond sexually excited as you rack yourself over and over with pleasure and joy, furiously rubbing in the pie all over your body, rapidly turning yourself into paint. Only a few splotches here and there still look photo realistic but its difficult for you to grasp as you rub yourself in with it. After a few more minutes of this your completely covered and decide its time to flip over to do the other side, but to your own amazement its already painted as if you are 100% a painting. You bust out giggling and laughing as you roll over, leaving all the tomato paste and pizza toppings on the canvas, revealing your now completely naked, fully painted form laying face up on the canvas. You begin to start touching yourself all over, laughing and rocking back in forth, kicking your feet up in the air and squealing. &quot;I&#39;m a fucking painting! I don&#39;t ever want this to go away!! Bwahahahaha!&quot;<br />
<br />
You then stop playing with yourself and relax with a big happy sigh, and stretch out, lazily letting your vision turn around to look back into the real world... and see a completely gobsmacked Dave standing in front of you. You then wave to him. &quot;Look Dave! I&#39;m a painting! For real now! Te-he-he-he!&quot; You say, as you begin to smile really big as you feel your entire body build and build up with that tingling pleasure making you gasp still smiling in front of Dave completely naked and made of paint, you feel like your about to explode in orgasm and then all the tenseness and pleasure suddenly leaves your body completely, and you give in to a deep, deep relaxing sleep. Your face and body happy and smiling, completely frozen in place...</p>
