<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rather than being his true son Jeff became Jim's boy.<br />
<br />
He had always wanted someone to do things with and now he had the <br />
chance.<br />
<br />
Jim wasn't the smartest guy in the world so making the changes weren't <br />
too exact. He found a picture of himself in the chronivac memory and <br />
pasted it into the data for Jeff. In moments all the stats changed for <br />
Jeff. He was a tall bear of a man muscled and fat and furry as all get <br />
out. He stank like a pig and was as dirty as one too.<br />
<br />
Jim reduced Jeff's height to half that of Jim's figuring that he could <br />
get a good blow job if he was at the right height but he left the <br />
weight the same. He was now a round stinky bear.<br />
<br />
He dropped Jeff's intelligence drastically so that he wouldn't be able <br />
to get out of this and made him quite submissive.<br />
<br />
He hit submit and the clothing as if being inflated dropped from the <br />
stinky garbage man and became the new Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood there naked and so was Jim.<br />
<br />
Get over here boy.<br />
<br />
Jeff came over and Jim stood up and he started to suck Jim's dick with <br />
gusto. He knew something was wrong but he couldn't figure out what. <br />
This was wrong but oh so right at the same time.<br />
<br />
When Jim was properly lubed up he grabbed Jeff by the head spun him <br />
around and lifted him onto the coffee table and rammed himself home. <br />
Now Jeff had never been fucked before but this new body seemed to be <br />
quite familiar with the action. He slipped in all the way and that was <br />
no easy feat with the size of Jim's cock.<br />
<br />
The constant prodding massaged Jeff's prostate and soon he was cumming <br />
milking the cum from Jim. Jim grabbed Jeff by the hips and lifting <br />
this behemoth as easily as he did those trash barrels still mounted <br />
upon his cock took Jeff and sat down on the sofa and spun him around <br />
so that Jeff could see his new daddy.<br />
<br />
Belly to belly Jeff used his little stubby legs to raise and lower <br />
himself on his daddy's dick till he came again and again. Jeff was <br />
filled dripping from his constantly gaping hole.<br />
<br />
Jeff could see himself in the reflection in the window and finally saw <br />
that he was no longer the kid he once was. He was in his early 20's <br />
with a full scruffy beard. He was exhausted when Jim heard some thugs <br />
outside.<br />
<br />
With one quick move he lifted Jeff off of his still stiff cock and <br />
went to the computer. Jim found the scan feature and scanned the thugs <br />
outside. He needed a new set of clothes now and so did his boy so he <br />
made the loudest one into an almost mirror image of the clothing that <br />
Jeff was with some particularly strategic holes in the shirt, around <br />
the left nipple and some ventilation in the crotch. He made the shirt <br />
too tight so it was stretched out over his belly and rode high <br />
bunching up under his tits soaking up the sweat from work. He hit <br />
submit and the others saw their pall change and they were shocked.<br />
<br />
Jim quickly made one of the others a pair of leather overalls for <br />
Jeff. He made them shorts so that the thick legs could be seen easily <br />
and some nice loose boots for him to slip in and out of. He made the <br />
top half of this boy into a pair of shorts so Jeff had two sets of <br />
clothing to change into. The mouth of the second boy was positioned so <br />
that Jeff's tinny dick stuck out the hole that would have been the <br />
thugs mouth. As Jim hit submit the change was made and the others were <br />
freaked out.<br />
<br />
The third thug Jim made into a well used garbage truck. The gas tank <br />
was filled through what was once his ass and the back of the truck was <br />
once the thugs mouth. The dents and dings showed rust. His arms turned <br />
into some large leverage devices that would grab hold of some of the <br />
larger dumpsters and fill his mouth with trash. When Jim hit submit <br />
the thug started to blow up like a balloon eventually towering over <br />
the others and then they saw him turn metallic and change into the <br />
truck.<br />
<br />
The rest of the thugs ran for their lives as Jeff and Jim went down <br />
for their new wardrobe and transportation.<br />
<br />
Jim had fortunately already scanned the rest of the thugs and decided <br />
he would make changes to them as time went by. There was no distance <br />
that they could flee in order to escape Jim's changes and when he got <br />
back to his apartment he made one quick change to one of the thugs <br />
removing his balls. This man had been a dominant sort but Jim made it <br />
so that he had lived without balls for over 5 years so his <br />
testosterone had been diminished and he wasn't taking any supplements.<br />
<br />
He just laughed at his new toy.</p>
