<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">------------------------------------------------<br />
Jeff knew that usually the people&#39;s exterior are inheriting from his grandparents. So he decided to put Derek and Elias in a section for grandfathers, he found another huge bodybuilders and made them his surrogate granmothers and fathers from other side. So he pushed &#39;Enter&#39; and the transformation began. First, Chronivac created him his parents. There were two 10&#39; tall and 900lbs hairy, musclebound giants that were his dads. Their name were David and Chris. Jeffs body reacted to the transformation, his muscles swelled and his cock grew. His tank top and gym shorts were ripping, revealing his hairy, muscular body. He started to beat off his massive 18&quot; cock.<br />
&quot;Oh God, it feels so good!&quot; he moaned, as he pumped his meat.<br />
He was squizzing his cock and felt that his body was getting bigger.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s working!&quot; he thought, as he continued to beat off his massive, horse-sized tool.<br />
He hears that someone is knocking into his door.<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;Jeff, your granddads are here, we&#39;r having a dinner in a few. You should be joining us,&quot; Chris said.<br />
&quot;Of course dad,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
Jeff opened his wardobe and picked the most fitting clothes for him. It was his favourite pair of black tank top and gym shorts. Both had a &#39;Muscle Freak&#39; logo and number 33. Jeff was a fan of number 33, he didn&#39;t knew why, but it was the most suitable for him. He went out and headed for the dining room.<br />
There were his dads (David and Chris) and his grandfathers (Derek and Elias). All four giants were about to start eating their usual diner, a mountain of meat and vegetables. The smell of the food made his mouth water. They were waiting for him chatting. When Jeff came over Derek stood up.<br />
&quot;Ah, there you are,&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Hi, grandpa&quot; Jeff smiled.<br />
&quot;You are bigger than I remember, kid&quot; said Elias.<br />
&quot;Really? How much?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
&quot;Maybe as big as I were&quot; said Derek.<br />
When Jeff sat on his place the dinner began. He started to put the meat and vegetables in his plate. After a few plates he was filling full, but his father David told him &quot;Just 3 meals? Are you alright? Last year you&#39;ve never stopped when you had your 6th or 7th meal!&quot;. Jake felt that his muscles were became warmer. His legs started touching the table, and he was stretching his clothes. He didn&#39;t know what&#39;s happening. He could feel his cock grow and his balls were swelling. He also felt a huge hunger.<br />
&quot;Or, dad, I&#39;m ok. Please, give me another one&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;Let me help you&quot;Chris passed him another plate and he started to eat again. Now, Jeff was really filling bigger. His arms touched his waist, his legs were touching the table and his shoulders were getting wider. Jeff understood that Chronivac didn&#39;t finish its work and continued to change the reality. His growth started to slowing and than stopped. Now he was feeling better, his appetite was normal, his cock was 16 inches and his balls were about 6,5 inches. He was 9&#39;4 feet tall and he weighted 700lbs. So if Chronivac reacted on these words in this way, Jeff liked to use it. He told David that he was wrong and 7 meals he had eaten 3 years ago. And since Christmas 2 year ago his standard dinner is 10 meals. But a few months ago he decided to icnrease it to the dozen. <br />
But nothing happened. Jeff growth didn&#39;t started and he was a bit confused. Than Chris said to David that he is wrong. He blaimed David that he spent to much time at work and do not participate in Jeff&#39;s life. Derek said that he should have more time with his son and his husband. And that his grandson is their future. He reminded that Derek and Eilas even presented a great set of plates for Jeff last Christmas. It was special set, because these plates were bigger than standard large plates. <br />
And now Jeff watched that his plate started to change color and increasing its diameter. Amount of food on it also increased. His plate was getting bigger. And than stopped and started to getting ... smaller. That&#39;s how Jeff felt. But in reality the plate did not change the size, it was Jeff&#39;s body what changed. Jeff groaned in delight, his tank top and shorts were ripping. His pecs were ripping his tank top and his nipples were hard, his shoulders and biceps were swelling and becoming bigger and harder. Jeff was breathing heavier, and his heart was beating faster. His cock was growing and his balls were swelling. He mentioned that his chair also changed to a wider and stronger one, like his grandpas had. His growth ended when he was 9&#39;6 and 880lbs. He was happy.<br />
&quot;Look at your boy, David. He is bigger than you and Chris at that age. It means that he might become on of us, the greatest bodybuilders. He is a bit smaller than we were but I believe in him&quot; Derek felt sad about his son.<br />
Jeff understood that he didn&#39;t reach the goal he had. He was still smaller than Derek and Elias. He needed an idea how to convince everyone that he was bigger or consumed more food or trained harder.<br />
&quot;Grandpa, when I visited your rancho last time and we&#39;ve measured height I was taller than you. Almost 1 foot taller&quot; Jeff said to Derek.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true. He was about 9&#39;11 , and you were 9&#39;0&quot; Elias said.<br />
Jeff felt that his head was spinning. He felt that his growth started. Chronivac was working.<br />
&quot;Dad, I think I should be getting to bed,&quot; the boy said, his voice a deep, rumbling baritone.<br />
&quot;Yeah, kid, it&#39;s been a long day,&quot; Derek said. &quot;We&#39;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks for a wonderful meal, Chris,&quot; Elias said.<br />
&quot;My pleasure,&quot; the muscle-bound giant said.<br />
&quot;Good night, everyone,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;Good night, granson/son,&quot; the four giants replied.<br />
When Jeff stood up his eyes were much far than before. He walked slowly and carefully. It was a strange feeling for him. When he was in his room he closed the door and took off his clothes. He looked at himself and smiled. He was a hairy, musclebound giant, with a huge, throbbing cock and massive balls. He stept on a scale but it showed that he was just over 900 lbs. It shouldn&#39;t be right.<br />
He put his clothes on back and went to the kitchen. There was Chris and David, talking to each other. When Jeff came over they stopped their conversation and asked Jeff what&#39;s happend.<br />
&quot;I forgot to drink my protein shake&quot; the boy answered.<br />
&quot;Oh, you need to drink it. Protein is what makes a man,&quot; Chris said.<br />
&quot;Here is you shake&quot; David put a huge glass of pink liquid in front of him. It was 3 galons of Jeff&#39;s favorite shake. He loved to drink it, because his grandpas were creating a special shake for him, what was perfect for his body.<br />
Jeff grabbed the glass and drank all its contents in a few gulps. With each gulp he was feeling that his muscles were swelled. His pecs were getting bigger and harder, his lats were expanding, his ass was getting rounder and his cock was growing. Also, the giant cup in his hand didn&#39;t shrink. Chronivac wa strying to match Jeff&#39;s changes. When the drink was over Jeff put the empty glass on the counter. He didn&#39;t feel that he is full and he didn&#39;t think that it was enough, so he asked Chris to make another one. In a second he added &quot;as usual&quot;. <br />
He muscles continues to grow but suddenly stopped. He was happy but his father Chris was sad. &quot;Are you sure? Your grandpas didn&#39;t give you so much.&quot;<br />
&quot;I have been doing it for 9 months. And I&#39;m thinking to increase it up to three shakes every evening. My body needs to grow, you know&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;Ok, if you are sure&quot; David said.<br />
&quot;Of course I&#39;m sure&quot; the boy answered, gulping his second dose. He could feel that his back was so wide that he was not able to down his hands anymore less that 40-50 degrees. By the way it was comfortable position to hold the glass jar of protein. <br />
Chris made him a new glass of protein shake and the boy drank it. &quot;The boy&quot; was a 10&#39;5 and 1200lbs monster. His abs were a bit rounded but still very defined, his pecs were a big pillows and his legs were a mass of muscles.<br />
&quot;I should be going to bed,&quot; the giant Jeff said, his voice a deep, rumbling bass.<br />
&quot;Have a good night, son,&quot; Chris said.<br />
The muscle-bound giant made his way to his room, the floor creaking under his massive weight. Jeff was so happy that noone is bigger than him in his family. &quot;And in the whole world too.&quot; he added in his mind. He put off his clothes and his cock was a massive 30  inches long and 8 inches in diameter. He laid on his bed and started to stroke his big piece of meat. The bed was creaking, as Jeff was moving. His body was covered in sweat and his hair was soaked. He was grunting and moaning in delight, his massive chest heaving and his huge arms flexing. His balls were hanging low and filled with huge amount of sperm. The idea came into his mind. He told himseld &quot;my last meal for today&quot; and closed his mouth to the base of his cock and sucked his meat. It was a difficult thing because his pecs were too big but after a while he managed to do it. Warm and sticky liquid poured into his throat. It was delicious and Jeff was drinking the sperm in big gulps. After a few minutes of sucking his balls were empty and his stomach was full. When he finished he layd in his bed and stopped moving, by he heard that cracks are getting louder and the bed was sinking more and more. He understood that more food made him grow larger. Than his head touched the wall and his feet were out of the bed. He stood up and put the mattress on the floor. &quot;And taller too&quot; Jeff was on the seventh heaven. Jeff stepped on the scale and found out that he weighed just over 1400 lbs. He laid on a mattress and felt asleep.</p>
