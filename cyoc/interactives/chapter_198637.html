<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Late to the party sorry. No offense meant to anyone else, and I am never offended by meta commentary on my own nonsense, gotta be able to laugh at yourself.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No! <i>No</i>! Well... well not yet, anyway. She wasn&#39;t going to lower herself to that. She was better than this! Maybe! For the moment! She wrenched her hands free and forced herself back onto her feet, gritting her teeth to try and resist the pleasant sensation of fabric rubbing against her newly-created dicknipples. Damnit, she might have been stuck here in some bizarre lesbionic, but she wouldn&#39;t succumb to just sitting around jacking herself off in public. No, that was exactly what this twisted nightmare world wanted out of her, and she wouldn&#39;t provide it the satisfaction. She was going to resist, and she was going to keep it up until she figured out a way out of here.<br />
<br />
The now-teenager took a deep breath as she marched towards the entrance of the school, her tail swinging in the breeze and nipples leaking out... milk? That was... well it made sense, she didn&#39;t have balls, it was just... weird. Fucking everything here was weird, and the weird things were also fucking. But back on track. She could already tell by the fragmented sentences and odd tangents and wordplay that, unfortunately, RainingJustice was back - it had felt like she&#39;d enjoyed a good half a year away from that pyschotic bitch, but once more she&#39;d returned, driving forward a life that she&#39;d hoped would just stall out and be peaceful.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, Christina was able to reflect as she walked through the front door that, three paragraphs in, she was neither immersed in some bizarre description of sex that seemed adamant on avoiding just calling a pussy a pussy or a penis a penis, and no strange magical nonsense had some retconned away her three dicks. This told her a couple of important things: for one, the author was actually trying to stick to the prompt saying she resisted, and two, maybe whatever bizarre fixation RainingJustice had on the phallus had finally been worked out at some point in the past six months. Worrying, as it meant her harebrained scheme had ultimately failed, but... it did present a bit of an opportunity.<br />
<br />
For the time being, she might well be the only girl in this school with a penis. Or at least, the only one who had three of them. That could be fun.<br />
<br />
Later. It could be fun later. And only if her next plan didn&#39;t work. Because she wasn&#39;t about to resign herself to life here, not quite yet, not until she tried every other possibility. The next one on her list was to hit up the woman in charge of the school; by all accounts, any woman who was running a school for witches in one of these magical girl academy type deals was bound to be powerful. If anyone in this hyper-sapphic world of giant boobs and way too much scales and latex was going to know how to break back out of the fourth wall and escape to reality, it was bound to be her. Or some weird overarching villain, maybe, but she couldn&#39;t remember if this story world had one of those or not, so that was right out.<br />
<br />
Finding her was fairly easy - the hallways almost seemed to recognize where she wanted to go and lead her right to Principal Hexe&#39;s office. Whether that was a fancy enchantment to help students with navigation or just a contrivance so the author didn&#39;t have to spend a paragraph describing a bunch of weird transformees for her to walk past was a question for another day. She walked right inside the front part of the office, quickly letting the receptionist know she urgently needed to speak with the principal - only for the woman herself to call out. &quot;Christina, dear, finally! I&#39;ve been waiting forever for you to get here!&quot; She waved. &quot;Come on in! We really do need to talk!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh God, she knew Christina&#39;s name. For some reason, that made her skin crawl a bit as she stepped inside the office, the door magically closing behind her to give them privacy. She was already struggling to hide a new rise in her shirt - Mala&#39;s beauty was as intense as her hourglass figure was generous. The very image of a mature witch, of a magical MILF who Christina would have loved to have stepping on her, under another circumstance. She would&#39;ve been surprised if this gorgeous woman hadn&#39;t already gotten some kind of adoringly-described sex scene back in the main story. At the very least, there had to be one in the works - from the flowing hair to the confident smile to the just-revealing-enough getup, she was just so... <i>unf</i>.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I am, my dear. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll get my time eventually.&quot; Christina blinked rapidly. Had... had she just...? &quot;Yes, my dear, I did.&quot; Mala winked. &quot;You don&#39;t get to be in charge of a magical girl&#39;s school if you don&#39;t learn how to read the narrative descriptions and internal monolouging.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even when it&#39;s still being written?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the best time to read it, my dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Right, okay, but that also wasn&#39;t important. &quot;You&#39;ve gotta know I don&#39;t belong here, then!&quot; Christina pleaded, leaning onto the desk with both hands. &quot;Please, please please please, you&#39;ve got to have some way to get me out of here! Send me home, or... I don&#39;t know, send me to Transform or Dare or Ty&#39;s Power or something, any place where I don&#39;t have that insane woman subjecting me her particular brand of poorly-described weird shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Mala raised an eyebrow. &quot;You really think one of her own characters is going to help you like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina huffed. &quot;<i>Technically</i>, Marv invented you.&quot; Her eyes cast a sidelong glance. &quot;...truth be told, I was kind of hoping this would be one of their chapters...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable, but I suspect you will fare no better even when they&#39;re in the lead.&quot; It wasn&#39;t like she&#39;d been able to get out in the last chapter, after all. &quot;It&#39;s true that I am indeed the most powerful witch on this campus, but even I cannot send you away. You know as well as I that CYOC story branches never truly end - and I can&#39;t send you to another universe. This is the St. Chariot&#39;s Academy branch, and so it must remain in that setting.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl wanted to snark back, but couldn&#39;t. It was simply the way things were, whether or not she liked admitting it. They couldn&#39;t just link over to another branch - that power had been solely within the domain of tfroleplay.us, and that place was long ago lost. &quot;Then what the hell <i>can</i> you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help this to be as enjoyable as possible for you.&quot; She smiled, setting her wand on the table. &quot;I will arrange for a private room for you, so that you can have some time to yourself to adjust... and you know, even if you can&#39;t get rid of those things...&quot; She glanced down at the erect dicknipples with a &#39;why the fuck would you&#39; type of gaze. &quot;...you can make other alterations to yourself. This is a rare opportunity, actually being able to live out transformations yourself instead of vicariously through fictional characters - you should take advantage of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hardly seems like &#39;Resisting&#39;,&quot; she muttered back, in reference to the option that had led to this scene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps not, but this is the last paragraph of the chapter - from here on out, you&#39;re free to swerve as you like.&quot; The door swished open. &quot;Now run along, and please, try and make the best of things.&quot; Christina raised a hand to protest, but Mala&#39;s telekinesis was already shoving Christina out. In moments, she was left out in the hall, sighing as she pondered where to go next. There was always the chance she could try and find another main character to get help from... or to let off steam with... or hell, maybe she was best off just following Mala&#39;s advice.</p>
