<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick thought it was another spam that got through the filters of his mail. It looked like one since it promised money right in the e-mail subject. Nick is not in a situation where he is in desperate need of money. But some cash would be nice. If the price promised isn’t another load of bull, he could buy the things we want and thrice over. But it&#39;s too good to be true. Or so he thought. He was at the brink of deleting the mail when curiosity pulled him to reality. And now at the contract signing days after sending a reply saying his approval, he was glad that he did delete the mail.<br />
<br />
After weeks of pilfering through the population of San Francisco, the Glendale Group - a super-rich family that owns several companies around the globe - wants to have their youngest son swapped with an older body. Nick is confounded as to why they would pick him. He wasn&#39;t notable in any regard. He has allergies to pickles, and he&#39;s only okay at sports. His grades weren&#39;t something to be proud of. When asked why they would pick him, the official overseeing the side of the Glendale Group kept his mouth shut. Confidential secrets they said. <br />
<br />
The bureaucracy is quick, and all the papers and whatnots were signed within the day. The day would take in a swap-meet convention, and it&#39;s another thing that made Nick question the proceedings. The Glendale Group is fucking rich. They are bound to have hundreds of swap pods at the ready. It confused him as to why the swap would take place in a random public location. He didn&#39;t bother asking again because it might be another confidential secret.<br />
<br />
Of course, Nick informed his parents of the impending change. Although, he kept the fact that he&#39;d receive cash or he&#39;d be swapped with someone from the Glendale group. They were happy, of course. They&#39;d get to have another round of having a child again, even though that child would have the mental age of a 23-year-old. They even went as far as to invite Nick back to his childhood bedroom. He considered having it, but he&#39;s also open to other options like using his money to buy his condominium unit uptown. <br />
<br />
Nick also informed some of his friends. Most were happy because Nick would finally do his first swap-meet. His friends already had their swaps since they were 14-years-old. They invited Nick in the past but he denied them every time. He wanted to keep his body pure for as long as it would take. And it lasted 23-years. His friends wondered what changed. Maybe it was because he&#39;d have about 15-years added to his lifespan, or is it because he&#39;d get to experience being a kid again. Nick was sure that it was because of the money. <br />
<br />
Lastly, he sent a letter to his university informing him of the swap. Nick was surprised to hear that they are already informed of the fact, and they have already notified his professors of the change. He might look like a kid but he is still a University student. He is still expected to do the same load of work of tasks. If he has problems with his body or if it is posing harm to his university duties, he could always go to the University Body Changes council for some help and advice. <br />
<br />
And finally, the day of the swap struck the calendar. The convention is full of people seeking to give out the parts they do not want and receive the ones they desire. Most would like to end their swap with only a body part. It&#39;s rare for people to seek an entire swap because one&#39;s whole body is one&#39;s whole identity. Some people see that if one were to lose one&#39;s body, one would also lose their identity. Their self of being reduced to something different - and thus, a complete erasure of the self. Nick believes that in part. Although, the promise of money keeps his mind away from dwelling with the thought too much. <br />
<br />
Nick saw the kid he&#39;s about to swap with and he was surprised that the kid got looks. He has short blonde hair that looked like fibers of gold. His eyes are as blue as the sky. He looked regal in that waistcoat. He looked bored, his face gives Nick the feeling that he wants this entire procedure to end early. As such, Nick undressed and went inside their respective pods. The doors closed and the view outside was shrouded in fog. Then his mind felt heavy and soon enough, it felt like there are stones tied to every bone in his body. The world turned dark and Nick was fast asleep.<br />
<br />
When he woke up…</p>
