<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sounds of screeching tires filled the night, Bong-cha’s foot pressing so hard on the accelerator that she was worried it would break. She noticed Luca making for the mini gun on the car and stopped him.<br />
<br />
“Lilith and Tess are in there remember? I’ll try to get us closer!” The red haired vampire said.<br />
<br />
She then looked to Jolie who had her stinger missile launcher at the ready.<br />
<br />
“We’re not using rockets either— I shouldn’t have to point out that we’re not trying to blow them up.” The vampire added.<br />
<br />
Then her phone rang and she put it on speaker before throwing it on the dashboard.<br />
<br />
“You’re going to be on your own for a bit, Marilyn’s crappy car isn’t going to be able to keep up with you. I’m sending Mercury and Sun to your car.” Setepenre informed.<br />
<br />
Bullets began to fire from one of the Normal’s trucks but Bong-cha’s vehicle remained impervious to their ammunition. Then in a blur Solar Guardians Sun and Mercury were in the back seats. <br />
<br />
“Hey, since you’re so fast Mercury, why don’t you just speed over to the head car and end this already?” The vampire asked.<br />
<br />
“I could definitely reach the head car but there’s nothing I could do to stop it, the thing has to weigh at lease a ton.” Guardian Mercury explained. <br />
<br />
“I guess we’re doing this the old fashioned way.” Bong-cha sighed.<br />
<br />
She sped up and rammed into the first car in the convoy, she yelled for Luca to take the sheen while she jumped out into the roof. She vampiric eyes flared up as she kept to the other car. Smashing through the bullet proof window she entered the enemy vehicle and the car suddenly started moving erratically. Finally the car swerved off the road and Bong-cha jumped from it just before it crashed, she landed on top of their car and the others could see a few bullet holes in her. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, bullets don’t hurt me, these guys weren’t expecting to face a vampire, remember?” She reassured them.<br />
<br />
They continued fright the convoy, Guardian Sun launched a blast of light from her sword, taking out two cars. Luca even rammed another car off the road, he howled in satisfaction. Finally when there was only three cars left the Kumiho, Choon Hee emerged from atop the lead car. <br />
<br />
“Fuck, this bitch again.” Bong-cha muttered. <br />
<br />
With a slash from her pole sword, Moon Blade, an arch of fiery energy slammed into their car and sent them crashing into a nearby building. But before the Normal convoy could continue Marilyn’s van collided with the lead car, Martin was in his Solar Sentinel form and was perched on the hood with his shield held out, causing the vehicle to crumble under it’s unyielding power.<br />
<br />
Bong-cha and the others got out of their car and ran to the crashed convoy. <br />
<br />
“How dare you try to take our teammates! In the name of the stars, I’ll punish you!” Solar Guardian Sun exclaimed striking a pose, this time she wasn’t embarrassed, her gaze was firm and determined.<br />
<br />
“Y-you self righteous brats!” Choon Hee spat as she climbed out of the crumpled vehicle. <br />
<br />
Before the Kumiho could continue, Bong-cha was already on top of her, she dug her nails into Choon Hee’s throat, her vampiric eyes shining in anger.<br />
<br />
“Shut up you mindless bitch! Did you think you could get away with hurting my family?!” She growled triumphantly.<br />
<br />
“Ackk…Y-yes…” Coon Hee coughed and tore her hand through the vampire’s torso.<br />
<br />
Bong-cha spit mouthfuls of blood and was blasted back by the woman’s power. <br />
<br />
“Y-you were always such a predictable, emotional girl Miss Joon. You could benefit from the same treatment that cured me of my free will.” Choon Hee said, regaining her composure. <br />
<br />
A terrifyingly fierce growl erupted from Luca as she shifted into his werewolf form. He lunged at the Korean woman and ripped into her arm, she tried to stab him with her sword but he blocked it with his large clawed hand, the pole’s blade dug into his flesh but he didn’t release his jaws from their vice on her arm. Choon Hee did the unthinkable and yanked her arm from his jaws, ripping her arm up but freeing her from his grip. <br />
<br />
“Mr. Redwood, always the hot tempered beast.” She said surprisingly calm.<br />
<br />
“Fuck you, I’ll rip you limb from limb if you’ve hurt Pluto!” He growled, spitting out her arm.<br />
<br />
Then the others arrived along with Setepenre, Jolie, Marilyn and Missy.<br />
<br />
“Seems you’re outnumbered. Why don’t you just give up.” The mummy said.<br />
<br />
“Miss Setepenre. I’ve looked into your past. You used to be so refined…so proper. It’s not too late for you to give up on this savage and unruly persona.” Choon Hee commented.<br />
<br />
Before anyone could react, Choon Hee had appeared mere feet from the group. However Guardian Mercury was just as quick and managed to block the kumiho’s sword with her silver bracers. <br />
<br />
“Give us back our friends, and we might let you live.” Mercury said, spreading her arms and parried her opponent’s sword. <br />
<br />
The woman’s steely eyes flicked between the group and then to her injured arm. <br />
<br />
“You would think I’d be at a disadvantage. However I have my orders. And I will obey them to the letter. Let us see if your resolve is as strong as mine.” She announced.<br />
<br />
The ensuing battle was chaotic, the group swarmed Choon Hee but she weaved through their attacks and countered them with the grace of a ballerina. She parried the fiery slashes from Marilyn’s swords and knocked her off balance long enough for her to dodge the bright blast from Miranda’s sword. A blast of blue fire erupted forom Choon Hee as she leapt into the air. <br />
Bong-cha, fueled by rage and vengeance, grappled with the Kumiho, her own wounds momentarily forgotten. But Choon Hee kept her almost emotionless focus, striking with lightning speed and razor-sharp claws, tearing through Bong-cha&#39;s defenses.<br />
Across the chaotic battlefield, Guardian Mercury, a blur of silver and speed, mirrored Choon Hee&#39;s movements. Their attacks clashed in a flurry of sparks, the high-pitched twangs echoing through the night. Though Mercury was swift, Choon Hee possessed an uncanny ability to anticipate her attacks. Just as Mercury lunged forward, the Kumiho would vanish in a puff of smoke, reappearing behind her in a heartbeat.<br />
The air itself crackled with raw power. Martin, his form radiating an ethereal glow, stood firm against the onslaught. He raised his massive shield, deflecting a blow from Choon Hee&#39;s sword with a deafening clang, but even the Sentinel&#39;s nigh-invulnerability wasn&#39;t enough. Choon Hee, with a surge of dark energy, launched him flying through the air, crashing into a nearby vehicle.<br />
Jolie unleashed a barrage of missiles. Choon Hee, with inhuman agility, twisted and contorted, the rockets streaking past her in a deadly ballet. One missile found its mark, exploding on the Kumiho&#39;s shoulder but the Asian woman was unfazed, the wound seemingly mending before their very eyes.<br />
With a surge of renewed energy, Choon Hee launched a counterattack. A wave of blue fire erupted from her outstretched hand, engulfing the battlefield. The group cried out, scrambling for cover as the flames threatened to consume them whole.<br />
The blue fire dissipated around Choon Hee, momentarily blinding the them. When their vision cleared, they found themselves alone. The battlefield, moments ago a whirlwind of clashing steel and energy blasts, was eerily silent. Choon Hee, their quarry, had vanished.<br />
Disbelief turned to dread as the realisation dawned on them. This meticulously planned ambush, this desperate fight – it had all been a distraction. Panic clawed at Bong-cha&#39;s throat.<br />
<br />
“No,&quot; she rasped, the single word laced with a horrifying emptiness. &quot;She took them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin slammed his fist against the crumpled hood of the lead car.<br />
<br />
“We fell for it! We were so focused on taking her down…they must of moved them.” He grumbled.<br />
<br />
Accusatory glares were exchanged, but they were quickly extinguished by the gravity of the situation. Sun, her fiery aura dimmed with despair, knelt to the ground, tears welling in her eyes. <br />
<br />
“This is all my fault. I’m their leader…we have to get them back!” The mixed girl said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Sun,&quot; Setepenre said, her voice surprisingly gentle. &quot;This isn&#39;t the time for blame. We need to find them, and fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jolie, in a surprising moment of sanity, stepped forward. &quot;We need a plan. Choon Hee must have taken them somewhere. Where would she go?&quot;<br />
<br />
A tense silence followed. Then Bong-cha, her voice barely a whisper, spoke. &quot;The facility. The one we were taken to.&quot;<br />
<br />
A collective gasp resonated through the group. It was a place they&#39;d dreaded ever having to confront again but now it was their only lead.<br />
Determination replaced despair in Bong-cha&#39;s eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then that&#39;s where we&#39;re going. We get our girls back, no matter the cost.&quot; Setepenre stated.</p>
