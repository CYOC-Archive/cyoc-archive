<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sunday, in church again. Felicity’s dressed in a red gingham dress and white pantyhose. She had already spent her Saturday in this same church, helping Father Forrd adjust the string on the new organ. Now she is here again. Her friends were at the town fair yesterday, she had missed her chance at a day of fun yet again. <br />
<br />
This would be the last time. <br />
<br />
She’s sitting in the pew with her family when the new organ makes itself known. <br />
<br />
“IT&#39;S SO LOUD” she thinks to herself. Her ears felt like they were bleeding, she could swear she heard the fingers of the organ player himself tonking against the black keys. <br />
<br />
Mercifully, the hymn ended, and Father Forrd addressed his congregation. While she admired his optimism, she was in no mood for snide comments about the state of youth like her. Having fun elsewhere while they should be worshiping. <br />
<br />
Felicity rolled her eyes, her heart skipped a beat. She quickly glanced around, her parents hadn’t spotted her rebellion. <br />
<br />
“-Let us pray.” <br />
<br />
Prayer…No…Not today. For the first time in her life, while pews are in unison mumbling prayer, she is silent, eyes wide open. She clamps her hands together with a smirk.<br />
<br />
“I’m a donkey, I’m an ass, I poo and bray and eat my grass.” She mumbles under her breath, not loud enough for anyone to hear.<br />
<br />
“I’m an ass, I’m an ass, I shake my rear, I have no class.”<br />
<br />
Her asinine mumbling comes to an end as the prayer ends. Then a piercing major key stings her ear. <br />
<br />
Another hymn ? Already ?<br />
<br />
Felicity had it at that moment. As the song blasted away she began brainstorming way to become a donkey right here right now. <br />
<br />
“I’m a donkey, I’m a donkey.”<br />
<br />
Gospel singers join the organ in harmony. Felicity changes her tactic.<br />
<br />
“I’m becoming a donkey, I am, I am, I’m changing.” <br />
<br />
She tried to convince herself she was, but she wasn’t. Thinking was doing no good. She couldn’t tell her body to change, she had to make her body change, physically. <br />
<br />
She went stiff and tensed her muscles. Trying as hard as she could muster to force her body to give in. Her body was tightened hard, her face and body going red. She hoped the noise of the church would cover any noise she made. She couldn’t even hear herself.<br />
<br />
As she continued her body began to heat up, her soft skin beginning to tingle. The tips of her ears turned a bright shade of crimson and her arms began to itch.<br />
<br />
Then, a loud poot blasts out of her rump and vibrates the seat.<br />
<br />
Her mother looks over to her, Felicity innocently smiles. <br />
<br />
“Excuse me.” <br />
<br />
Her mother glares at her. “That is not very ladylike of you. Do you have to go to the potty ?”<br />
<br />
Felicity shakes her head. Her mother&#39;s gaze pierced her facade.“Okay ” <br />
<br />
Relieved, she rolls up her right sleeve slightly. She holds back a gasp, her arm is definitely hairier. Not only that but she’s half sure her arm is thicker too. The beginnings of her donkey transformation. <br />
<br />
Her heart is skipping like a stone on water, her legs bouncing up and down. Until Felicity froze as she felt a sticky sensation in her panties. She grinds her rear into the seat and winces at what was no doubt a brown shart sticking to her soft rump.<br />
<br />
Felicity smirks.<br />
<br />
“I’m a donkey…I’m becoming a donkey.” She chants as the hymn ends. “I am a donkeeEhheHEEHAW.” She lets out a bray, her first bray. Felicity had crossed the event horizon of change. Her journey to Pleasure Island had officially begun.<br />
<br />
Then she felt a slap on her back. Her mother glares at her. <br />
<br />
“What is wrong with you. You&#39;re acting like an ass.” <br />
<br />
Little did she know that was her daughter&#39;s goal. She wasn’t going to be acting soon enough.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry I thought it would be funny.”<br />
<br />
“It wasn’t, you should be ashamed. “<br />
<br />
Thankfully no-one else in the church seemed to care about Felicity’s little incident, and the congregation rose from their seats in prayer, again.<br />
<br />
She stood silent, and began to slowly move her rear back and forth with the back of her dress acting as her makeshift tail. <br />
<br />
It’s not enough however, so she balled two fists and strained her muscles yet again. Her body heats up again. Itching, tingling.<br />
<br />
Her head gets light, the hair on her arms under her sleeve gets thicker. She leans forward onto the pew in front of her and pushes further. <br />
<br />
Her bright red ears point upwards, little hairs extending as they grow.<br />
<br />
Then her tummy gurgles. Her little anus blossoms open around a soft load of smelly poop. It lands in her panties with a crackling squish.<br />
<br />
The smell immediately permeates the air, not before her ears pop upwards another 6 inches. <br />
<br />
Felicity’s body begins to grow as well. Itchy hairs are growing all over her body now. Pops and crack as her bones shift. Her tailbone defuses and begins pushing up against her panties.<br />
<br />
Felicity’s mother finally noticed the smell in the air. She grimaced and opened her eyes to see her daughter leaning over the pew. What the hell is she doing ?<br />
<br />
“Felicity ? Are you messing your undies ?” <br />
<br />
She hooked her daughters skirt lifting just in time to not only see a stinky bulge of shit cradled in Felicity’s panties, but also a bigger, longer bulge just above it. A tail ?<br />
<br />
“What the fuck” she shutters . Felicity then farted again pushing out yet another large turd. The tail growth sped up as the turd exited.<br />
<br />
Felicity’s pushing paid off as a long donkey tail complete with tassel and matted fur.<br />
<br />
Felicity’s mother screams as she watches her daughter change into a beast.<br />
<br />
“What the hell was that ?” Someone yelled across the church.<br />
<br />
“What’s that smell?” another voice asked.<br />
<br />
Felicity continued to strain and her body finally gave in, she had convinced her very DNA that she was meant to be a donkey.<br />
As more people looked over to Felicity, her body ballooned with a chorus of sickening cracks, pops and gurgles. Her gingham dress gave up the ghost and split open to expose her hairy, barreling chest. Her shoes explode as her hands and feet expand into hooves.<br />
<br />
Few in the church were still praying, even Father Forrd had paused, his face going white.<br />
<br />
Felicity’s body was still growing, until finally her face was up to change. Her perfect straight hair shortening and curling into a dense mane. Her pretty dimpled face growing hair and pushing forward. <br />
<br />
“HEEEHAAWW.”<br />
<br />
With one final bray, Felicity was finally what she was supposed to be. Her family and the other people in the church gathered around her.<br />
<br />
“What happened, how did a donkey get in here ?”<br />
<br />
“She changed into one !”<br />
<br />
“What ?”<br />
<br />
“Who did ? Felicity ?”<br />
<br />
“She’s an ass, look at her ass !”<br />
<br />
To give them a little show, she lifts her tail and pushes out a huge load of manure onto the church pew where she once sat...</p>
