<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The dance and party seemed to go fairly well for Nate and Alex. They&#39;d said hi to Eric and Julie and a young couple they&#39;d been conversing with before heading out to the dance floor to have some fun. And it had been a fun night with music playing in the background and everyone simply enjoying it. To Nate, it wasn&#39;t quite something to miss out on, especially as he noticed there were fair number of same sex couples, not many and pretty much all of them were werecats or male werecats (or werewildcats as he&#39;d heard some mention), but it was something that felt comforting in a way. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t really that life in Minnesota had limited what he could or couldn&#39;t do with who he was, as many of the friends he had back there seemed rather accepting. However, between family issues and the fact that while people in Minnesota seemed rather accepting but might not be as there was never any sure proof of support, Nate had kept quiet on that front. But now, in Moon Lake, it seemed like everyone was openly accepting on the issue. The male/female couples didn&#39;t even bat an eye at the male/male couples like Nate and Alex or any of the female/female couples either. It was near perfect cooperation and acceptance on both ends.<br />
<br />
&quot;This has been fun,&quot; Alex smiled to him, &quot;having someone with me full time...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate nodded and looked back into Alex&#39;s eyes with a happy smile on his muzzle. He was greatly pleased with how things had gone, and in some ways, he never wanted the night to end. It just felt so good.<br />
<br />
&quot;... But you STILL could have told me you were going as me for Halloween,&quot; Alex finished to him with a slight teasing tone in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that would have ruined the surprise,&quot; Nate chuckled, &quot;it was a nice surprise, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A very nice surprise,&quot; Alex chuckled as they stood together.<br />
<br />
Things were quiet for a few moments a loud roar of a girl&#39;s name was heard over the crowd perked Nate&#39;s ears. He turned to see a pair of weretigers in togas move quickly toward the back doors that lead out to the area behind the high school. A young werefox female was close behind them, but stopped nervously at the back door and looked back into the crowd, as if looking for someone. Nate didn&#39;t get much time respond to that as another round of shouting soon came after that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I LOVE MELISSA JENKINS!&quot; came a loud bellow, making Nate and Alex turn their heads to look to see the werebull that had been talking with Eric and Julie earlier in the dance confronting a werecow that looked like she had been trying be a bit too forward with him. To Nate, it reminded him of what had gone on with Yvette Smith going after his father, and it was something that made Nate wonder as to whether or not all these hormones and high libido was something that really made were society as workable as things seemed so far. And as he watched, the confrontation continued. The werebull stood firmly before the werecow continued speaking, loudly, and firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;If anything happens to her, I will never forgive myself, and if I find out you had anything to do with what&#39;s going on right now, I swear I will kill you before I kill myself!&quot; the werebull vowed, turned and then charged with the full intent of going after this &quot;Mel.&quot; Nate and Alex were both forced to practically jump out of his way as he ran by, soon with a werewolf, weretiger, and a wererabbit following after him. It was a surprising situation, and even the music had stopped playing for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that all about?&quot; Nate asked aloud, mostly to Alex but he didn&#39;t really care who answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looked like a girl was being lead out behind the school,&quot; came a female voice, making Nate and Alex both jump.<br />
<br />
They both then turned to find a pair of werewolves dressed up in costumes that were made to look like what one would stereotypically associate with a Medieval king and queen. The female was fairly familiar to Alex. She was a year older than him, Ben, and Nate and in her Senior year at the high school, and for a girl, Amy Howler did look good. The male, who looked to be about the same age as Amy was a bit different. He was also rather new to Moon Lake, as Alex didn&#39;t recall seeing him around before the past few days or so. He thought that he might have seen him once before, but admittedly, his mind was a bit hazy on that, particularly as he was so happy to have Nate in his life. To Nate, as a new werewolf in the pack as well, both were a bit of an unknown, but he was still new. However, he was glad to have an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;A girl being lead out behind the school?&quot; Nate said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of school social events end up with couples going out behind the school to enjoy each other,&quot; Alex commented, &quot;Normally isn&#39;t too many or too different from other things weres do. Shoot, there are a fair number of weres on our respective streets that will go into the woods behind their houses to have sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate slowly nodded. That sort of thing he expected given how much his parent&#39;s marriage had healed and how much they&#39;d enjoyed each other since becoming weres. Of course, that didn&#39;t quite make sense given the werebull&#39;s angry bellow at the werecow, who Trevor noticed timidly moving away slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure the girl really wanted to go out with the group that was leading her,&quot; Amy added, &quot;and when the weretiger who roared and that werebull noticed, they went to the girl&#39;s &quot;rescue.&quot; I&#39;d guess that they were close to her... parent... friends... boyfriend, even. Which could mean that something was up with the group that lead her out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should we?&quot; Nate wondered, not wanting anyone to end up entering were society the &quot;wrong&quot; way.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I think she&#39;s gotten enough rescuers, already,&quot; Tad spoke, &quot;besides, we also don&#39;t know for sure that anything IS wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... hopefully her rescuers get there in time,&quot; Nate commented and then looked over to Tad, &quot;You&#39;ll have to forgive me, but I&#39;m still a bit new to Moon Lake...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad actually smiled and shook Nate&#39;s hand, &quot;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m new too. My name is Tad, Tad Decker, and you&#39;re... Nate, right? Nate Anderson?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Nate nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tad and I came across you two after Tad&#39;s official welcome to the pack,&quot; Amy commented, &quot;though it looked like you two were starting to doze off already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Nate and Alex both said together. Alex sheepishly brought his hand up to scratch the back of his head. By now, the dance was starting to resume more normal functions and the DJ was playing music again. In this, all of them began to feel more comfortable with their present interactions.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m new to Moon Lake too,&quot; Tad answered, &quot;There&#39;s a lot of people and things that I&#39;m just getting know too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Alex commented as the group walked over to a side area of the gym, &quot;How are things going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re actually going pretty good,&quot; Tad gave a smile, &quot;there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s great to enjoy regarding the freedom to be who I am... and the guy that killed my dad got busted, so things going good there. My mom and I got justice for the murder of an American hero.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good, and I take it you two are an item?&quot; Nate commented looking between Tad an Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tad smiled, &quot;And Amy&#39;s the greatest girlfriend ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We wouldn&#39;t know,&quot; Alex replied which only made Amy laugh rather softly. And from there they got into greater small talk on various things, things that they liked about Moon Lake and so on In that, Tad came to actually like Nate and Alex as potential friends to talk with when Amy wasn&#39;t busy. Nate was fairly intrigued by some of Tad&#39;s stories about what it was like growing up in a military family. Alex was actually most intrigued by Tad&#39;s comments on how his parents handled Tad&#39;s first transformation. <br />
<br />
For a were who had been born a were, that sort of thing was rather big for Alex. As in Moon Lake, the fact that the first transformation could be painful/irritating/uncomfortable had often turned to using sex as a means to ease through that first transformation. It made things easier for the new were as their body went through a shift in form that prior to the first transformation its body was unused to. The fact that Tad&#39;s parents had got him through his first transformation without him feeling any pain was something rather big.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you told this to the city council or Samantha Twist?&quot; Alex asked Tad, &quot;That sounds like something that could be rather important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I&#39;ve told Amy and helped her family with her brothers,&quot; Tad answered.<br />
<br />
Tad then looked around. He thought he&#39;d seen the Twists somewhere in the gym while he&#39;d been dancing, though they on the other end of the gym, but between those returning to dancing and moving back and forth, Nate couldn&#39;t tell for sure if the Twists were even still there.  In that, he guessed they had gone home and gave a small sigh before slumping his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that might be something to tell them when they get the chance,&quot; Alex commented, &quot;given some of the stuff that&#39;s been going on in the news... and the exposure scare... that sort of knowledge and program could be very helpful... and even if it doesn&#39;t relate to exposure, surely weres that leave Moon Lake are confronted by this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think that just about any were that HAS left Moon Lake would have figured that out,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;as my mom and dad were both from Moon Lake originally. If they can do it, anyone can do it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they do it because they have to, and may not succeed as your parents did,&quot; Alex pointed out, &quot;In that... what you have could a great help to Moon Lake... in many ways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I suppose if the Twists ever come to visit for dinner or something, I could mention it,&quot; Tad said with a shrug and then looked out to where he&#39;d last seen his mother. He couldn&#39;t see her and while the moving of people around the dance floor could possibly hide her in the crowd, he was unaware that his mother had already left to give a young woman named Claire her welcome into were society.</p>
