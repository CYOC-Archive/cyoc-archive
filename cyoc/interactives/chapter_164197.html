<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A clamor erupts from the back of the room where you see four young kobolds sitting around a table. Well, actually, they were standing on the seats to get a better view over the taller folk surrounding them. The biggest one of the group, a red-scaled kobold with an athletic physique, calls out to the guard as the other three cheer him on in their barking tongue. <br />
<br />
“Hey, jailer! We’ll take the cute one in front!” he yells out, pointing at you. <br />
<br />
The guard nods and pushes you towards them as the group jumps down from their table and scurries over to you. The two smaller ones jump onto the two larger ones’ shoulders, as if they were about to play a game of chicken fight, and proceed to remove your shirt while the bottom two drop your pants, leaving you as naked as the rest of the tavern’s patrons. Catcalls and wolf-whistles ring out from the other adventurers as you are disrobed, making you red with embarrassment. The little dragonkin then surround you, quickly tossing the meager rags you had been given in prison out of their way. The red-scaled stud was clearly the leader of the group, a good hand taller than the other three and letting his half-chub dangle freely between his legs with an air of confidence not common among kobolds. His seven inch member is about the same size as your own, but given that he is only about half your height it looks huge compared to the rest of him.<br />
<br />
“What’s your name, handsome?” he asks, grabbing your dick suddenly and forcing you onto your knees by pulling down on it until you are at eye level with them. You tell him meekly, nervous and intimidated by your situation, looking down at the clawed hand grasping your manhood. <br />
<br />
“Not a very good name, is it brothers?” he asks, receiving a round of agreement from the others. “Not like our strong Draconic names! I am called Vhok; the others are Gol, Drüg, and Rheld.”<br />
<br />
He points to the others as he says their respective names. Gol is the white-scaled Kobold to your right, and while he is quite a bit shorter than Vhok he is also stockier and stronger looking. His thick member hangs in your face, like his body much shorter but with a much wider girth. Drüg’s scales are black and he stands almost as tall as Vhok, though he is more lithe than the others. An impish grin creeps across his face as he slowly strokes his petite member off behind you. Rheld, the green-scaled Kobold to your left, is the smallest of the group, with an almost childlike build and softer features than the rest. This is contrasted by an eight inch member that dwarfs the others’ and your own, which he is tugging at impatiently. <br />
<br />
“You will be Torvir from now on!” Vhok declares, his excited member dripping pre. “You will be our master, and we shall serve you well!”<br />
<br />
“Master?” you ask, baffled, but you get no response other than having Vhok grab your chin to force your mouth open and allow his hot, slick member inside. <br />
<br />
Your mental reaction is panic, but you find yourself unable to move or speak against it. While you had never considered yourself gay before, or even really very sexual, you found yourself thoroughly enjoying the taste of his cock in your mouth and the smell of his musk in your nose. Despite every fiber of your being telling you this was not good, your mouth instinctively begins to suckle at his organ in a slow and practiced manner, and you find yourself even moaning around his shaft. His moans join your own as he leans forward, resting his arms on your shoulders, his head on top of yours, and standing on his tiptoes to get the best angle into your throat. <br />
<br />
“Come on, boys,” Vhok says, signaling his brothers to join in, “Torvir needs our help to begin his new life!”<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, the other kobolds surround you and put their own dripping members to similar use. Gol’s thick organ slides into your mouth beside Vhok’s and you find yourself miraculously able to take both at once, not that you were getting much choice in the matter. You feel something move beneath you as the sensation of warm scales pressing against your own cock makes itself known. You’re not sure how you know, but you get the feeling that Drüg has positioned himself between you and his brothers, and your suspicions on what he is doing are soon confirmed by the sensation of a tight Kobold hole surrounding your throbbing organ. You nearly cum from the sudden grasp of his body around you, the warm flesh engulfing your own. <br />
<br />
Two in your mouth and one on your shaft means only one left, and you have an idea what comes next. The sensation of having your cheeks spread and your entrance invaded by a warm, wet tongue is both alien, unwanted, and orgasmic. Your mind rebels against the thought of being penetrated like this, but your body no longer responds to its wishes, instead eagerly loosening its muscles in preparation for more. And more is exactly what you receive. As soon as your muscles relax around Rheld’s long tongue, he pulls it back out of you with a lewd slurp and you feel the space quickly filled by the hot, pulsing head of a cock far too massive for its owner. The kobold boy slams into you without hesitation or concern, and though it surprisingly makes its way in with no resistance, it fills your gut with the feeling of someone else inside of you. <br />
<br />
You moan in confusion, fear, and pleasure as every one of your orifices is stuffed full by the four young kobolds. Your mind is fruitlessly trying to find a way out of this, but your body is caving easily to their demands. Your cock twitches inside of Drüg as you near your climax, and similar movements in your mouth and rear alert you that you won’t be the only one releasing soon. As if choreographed, your body tenses up, injecting your seed into Drüg’s rear as his brothers react in a similar fashion, filling you up from both ends with hot and pungent kobold cum. Unlike the orc, it is not their mere presence that kickstarts your change, but the power of five synchronous orgasms that works as the catalyst for your transformation. <br />
<br />
As soon as you cum, you feel a sharp pain in your gut and double over on top of Drüg’s twinkish body, though he doesn’t seem to mind. Vhok and Gol pull out of your mouth, your maw dripping from the double load, but Rheld remains firmly inside of you. It feels like a thousand needles pricking your skin as every part of your body begins sprouting small growths that pierce your flesh. You grab at your face and the small of your back where the pain is the worst and find the protrusions folding back along your skin as they grow out, layering themselves like plate mail. As each silver scale lays flat, the open cuts begin healing up beneath them, but the stinging sensation continues.<br />
<br />
“The change is proceeding nicely,” Vhok remarks. “Hopefully three loads will be enough, since Drüg decided he wanted to be the first to receive our Master’s seed. Stay in as long as you can, Rheld, in case he needs another shot.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Captain Vhok!” Rheld replies eagerly in his childlike voice. <br />
<br />
Before you can ask what he means, the pain spikes again, making you cry out. You feel your body expanding, growing and stretching to the size of a large horse as your muscles bulk up immensely, the unnatural weight making you fall forward on your hands and knees, the black-scaled kobold humming happily beneath you. You look back to see that you aren’t just getting taller—you are growing a second set of shoulders below your original ones, small bumps pushing out from backwards sockets. You groan in discomfort as you feel two arms begin growing from the lower shoulders, stretching out and spreading their fingers behind you. The hands begin to extend at the metacarpals; they look like those of an animal with long digitigrade structure and thick, sharp claws protruding from each fingertip. The thumbs stay short, however, and are pulled backwards into dewclaws. You quickly realize these are no ordinary limbs as the four fingers begin to grow and stretch backwards, becoming long and spindly. The fleshy webbing between each of these fingers stretches out as well, becoming thin and leathery as you develop wings that lay back against your sides. Meanwhile, your normal arms, now bulging with muscle, are graced by hands that become a strange hybrid of man and beast with sharp but retractable claws. <br />
<br />
You are so enraptured by your front transformations that you don’t even notice the other changes going on. A change similar to that of your arms is taking place over your legs as your feet stretch and reshape into hind paws and grow similarly deadly claws. You do, however, notice your genitals growing to equine proportions within your mount before your testicles retreat inside your body. You can feel every inch of the now two foot shaft buried in the kobold boy, though you can’t see it turning a deep fluorescent blue. You moan again, though, as you develop a canine-like knot and tapered tip as well as a medial ring, all of which makes Drüg squirm in ecstasy as he feels you changing inside of him. <br />
<br />
“Excellent progression,” Gol remarks. “Master’s transformation actually seems to be going rather smoothly. Although I wonder if he’ll be bothered by the—“<br />
<br />
“AAAAAHHH!!!” you scream, as your spine feels like it’s being ripped out of your body from your rear. <br />
<br />
“—tail.”<br />
<br />
As if being yanked by a chain, your spine extends from above your buttocks, growing into a long and powerful prehensile tail as you arch your back and crane your neck. Your claws dig into the hardwood floor beneath you and your bestial frame braces against the pain until your tail finishes growing and curls up around you. Your neck moves forward again, but stretches rather than bends, creating a swan-like S shape as your neck muscles fill out. The pain in your head resurges as your skull stretches and cracks, your nose extending into a crocodilian snout as your teeth fall out only to be replaced by huge, sharp canines. Your tongue lengthens and forks, slipping out between your teeth to taste the air and sending strange signals to your brain from your new Jacobson’s organ. Your eyes burn and cloud as skin fuses over top of them only to become clear moments later as you peer from newly slitted pupils. You gasp in wonder as you see, for the first time, colors you had no human words to describe. <br />
<br />
“I think it’s worked, Rheld!” Vhok cries excitedly. “You can get off of him now!”<br />
<br />
“Aw, do I have to?” the little green kobold complains, having thoroughly enjoyed the feeling of your body transforming around his cock. <br />
<br />
“Yes,” Vhok chides, “Torvir needs room to breathe and get used to his new life as a dragon!”<br />
<br />
Rheld begrudgingly pulls himself out of your rear while Drüg removes himself unceremoniously from your crotch. As your changes complete, the pain gradually begins to subside. As the pain leaves your body, however, a fog begins to grow in your mind. It feels like trying to stay awake during a boring class as your eyes begin fluttering open and shut, your head swaying and your balance thrown off. Your new and unfamiliar body doesn’t make staying in control any easier and you soon collapse to the ground, sprawled out on the floor as you look up again at the crowded barroom, cheering patrons, and grinning kobolds. <br />
<br />
“Come on, brothers,” Vhok says, “let’s help him up!”<br />
<br />
The four of them help you to your feet and you find yourself looking at the room from a much higher vantage point than before. Looking down, you find the large and powerful body of a silver dragon, though you are able to stand in a bipedal stance rather than on all fours like other dragons you had heard of. Your huge draconic frame stands on thick, muscular legs with broad, leathery wings folded back against your torso and a tail like an anaconda wrapping around your legs and slithering around absentmindedly. This was all so new to you, but contrary to your earlier trepidation, this feels natural and right. Now that you aren’t writhing in pain, you are able to appreciate what has become of you and notice many more astounding features of your body. <br />
<br />
For starters, you feel healthier than you thought was possible, as though some innate and limitless energy is preventing any defects or illness and making you feel a hundredfold more powerful than you look (and you look immensely powerful). As you move around, stretching your new muscles and getting used to your new body, you find your mind is more powerful as well. You begin to recall the knowledge of vast tomes you don’t remember reading, your mind forming thoughts in a strange new language you know to be Draconic. Even as your mind gains new knowledge of what it means to be the dragon worshipped by four young kobolds, you lose something else. You can no longer remember your human name. You are Torvir now, and that is all that matters. <br />
<br />
As your mind floods with these new thoughts you find yourself forgetting why you had even resisted the change to begin with. This is where you belong. This is your rightful place as lord of these kobolds. It is only the natural order. Kobolds live to serve dragons, to worship them, to give their lives to them. If they need a dragon to serve, why stop them? You are happy to be their Master now. These feelings of power and dominance awaken the dragon inside of you, chasing out what humanity is left and welling up within you the urge to let out a mighty roar that shook the Wayward Tavern and assured all of the occupants that you were the one in charge here.<br />
<br />
“Master,” Vhok calls to you not in Common, but in the dragon tongue, “We are your humble servants. What do you command of us?”<br />
<br />
“Find me a seat,” you tell him, “I want to watch the rest of the show.”</p>
