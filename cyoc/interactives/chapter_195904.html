<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erin&#39;s mind is jostled awake as Dave&#39;s muffled voice calls out to her, his words becoming more clear as she is pulled out of her self-reflection. *yawn* &quot;Good morning Dave, how... how did I turn out?&quot; Erin drones still waking up, stretching out inside of the canvas from her previously stationary standing pose. <br />
Dave lets out a slight sigh of relief seeing that his friend is still all there and intact. &quot;You turned out quite rather well. Look just like a servant from an anime. How are you feeling in there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Umm, rather light and flat. This little body you painted me feels quite great!&quot; Erin does a short spin inside of the canvas ending in a bow, making her skirt ruffle and chest sway as she moves. &quot;Everything feels very real to me, and... natural! Like, I get that I am a painting and all but I didn&#39;t feel like this yesterday or the day before, It all feels so natural in here. I love how you have drawn me, my figure is perfect!&quot; Erin exclaims excitedly.<br />
&quot;Ah good, that&#39;s great to hear Erin. But you do remember what we were gonna try next if you turned out alright right?&quot; Dave says smiling for his happy friend.<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh yeah! You were gonna try to pull me out of the painting, see what happens or if I can even leave. Right, right. Umm, give me a minute to admire my form for a bit first? I do wanna see if I can leave but I wanna just give myself a minute to soak this new form in and all.&quot; Erin says blushing with a faint giggle.<br />
&quot;Take your time dude.&quot; Says Dave. &quot;I&#39;ll go make us some breakfast while I wait.&quot;<br />
Dave then leaves the upstairs studio and closes the door, heading down to his kitchenette in his apartment before grabbing some things to make some eggs, toast and tea and turns on the stove.<br />
<br />
With Dave gone from the room, Erin reverts her vision back into her painting. She is absolutely adorable, her dainty feminine form looks beautiful in her new outfit and her emerald green eyes and brilliant red hair accentuates her new beauty quite well. Her anime style quite large tits chest don&#39;t seem so large to be impractical but aren&#39;t anywhere near small and stand out as the center-piece for her chest. Her waist is rather plump for her frame too, but also seems to be just right, accentuating her hour-glass form without looking overly exaggerated. Her frilly black-and-white skirt is just long enough to cover her crotch and lucious rump without revealing herself unless she bends over and perfectly matches her dainty little legs in their thigh-high stockings. Erin then looks down at her feet to see they are small for a girl her size, giving off a dollish appearance with a slight heel to them and a cute little green brooch adorning each of her shoes. Erin then examines her arms, her fingers perfectly encapsulated in black fabric draping its way up her arm. Her main vest tightly grips her form, comfortably gripping her chest without the need for a bra and proudly displaying her name tag on the right side. Erin then looks up to her face, Dave seemed to have focused mainly on the young and cute aspect when drawing her it would seem, her face giving off a younger than legal appearance while still matching the just-turned-18 appearance of her body. She notices that her pupils are shaped like a heart rather than perfectly round, and her facial make-up makes her look really cute and want to giggle as she admires her face. Moving her vision up to her hair, Erin admires each individual strand of ruby-red hair, it flows quite long too, a little over half-way down her back actually, almost reaching her waist. It looks naturally straight and well kept, with the classic white maid bow atop her head. While admiring her hair and backside, Erin notices that Dave has painted a big emerald green bow on her back that she didn&#39;t see at first, must have been something Dave painted when she was passed out she assumes. Erin then turns around to gaze at her full appearance and reads her name tag on her chest. &quot;ERIN&quot;, she reads it to herself softly, still quite amazed that it was just the night before that she was a fat neck-beard slob of a dude. Now she was the perfect waifu, a young red-haired, green eyed anime maid girl who looks younger than her age, even though she appears to be just 18. Giggling to herself, Erin begins to really let her joy set in about what she has become - exactly what she has always wanted - granted she always thought that she would be the one with the harem of anime girls if her wishes were allowed to become true, rather become one herself. But now that she was indeed an anime girl, Erin feels like she got the better position in the deal and is starting to feel both rather pleased and aroused by her situation, and even feels like she is starting to develop a crush on Dave. <br />
<br />
Erin&#39;s giggling is interrupted as Dave touches her painting then quickly lets go to get her attention. Dave has brought up tea and bagels with boiled eggs. &quot;All done admiring yourself Erin? I hope your hungry, because I&#39;m not planning on eating this all by myself. Ready to try to come out of there?&quot;<br />
Erin looks back at Dave and smiles happily and nods. &quot;Yes Dave, please... Try to get me out of this 2D plane, so I can be with you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Heh, alright dude... Well... Her we go... Hope this works this time...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave reaches his hand towards the painting and thinks about reaching through to grab his friend, he closes his eyes and tries to imagine Erin coming to him, at first, the canvas feels like normal, but after a few seconds Dave feels his hand pop through and grab Erin by the hand. He grabs her hand, or at least what he think feels like her hand and tries to pull his arm back toward him. Erin feels Dave&#39;s hand enter her scene and races toward it, reaching out for him to take her hand and within seconds makes contact. She then feels a rush of movement all around her as she gasps from the experience. Dave now with his friend in hand, pulls his hand free from the painting, and finally, Erin&#39;s hand is pulled through with it, pulling her out of the painting along with it. Although the painting doesn&#39;t exactly let her pop out so easily as it warps like glue as Dave tries to pull Erin free. &quot;Strange, I don&#39;t remember this canvas acting this way before...&quot; Dave says confused. &quot;Don&#39;t stop Dave! I&#39;m almost real again! I can feel it!&quot; Dave puts one foot on the canvas&#39;s frame as he continues to try to pull Erin free, but the canvas is much stretchier than it should be, and still refuses to give up its painted prisoner, but Dave continues to struggle with it.  He manages to pull Erin half-way free, her upper body coming out of the painting and her lower half is still fully 2D but Dave is nearly having to put both feet on the canvas to keep trying to pull her free...</p>
