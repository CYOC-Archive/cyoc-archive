<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;A dog collar with a silver bone shaped dog tag, and a leash? Kinky, Sinclair, kinky, but you're worth it,&quot; <br />
Chad said to himself. <br />
<br />
He didn't notice the eyes peering around the corner of the lockers.  The grin beneath those eyes would spell <br />
trouble for Chad.  Actually, the collar would spell the trouble literally.  Once connected around his neck, <br />
the collar would forever change Chad.<br />
<br />
Slipping into the Men's restroom, Chad opened his shirt collar and fastened the dog collar around his neck.  <br />
He grinned at his reflection. He stuffed the leash down the inside of his shirt, and tucked the wrist strap <br />
into his underwear. He slipped the adjustable wrist strap around his cock and balls like a cock ring. He <br />
grinned at his ingenuity. He buttoned his collar to conceal the dog collar, and glanced down at the way his <br />
makeshift cock ring enhanced the bulge in his jeans. Stepping out of the restroom, Chad felt the dog collar <br />
pop out the back of his shirt collar. He tucked it back down, and made sure it was below his collar line and <br />
headed to class.<br />
<br />
When Chad entered through the backdoor of his history class, it was already in session.  He was 10 minutes <br />
late.  The teacher glared at him, as students turned their heads to look at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're late,&quot; said the teacher pointedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, ma'am,&quot; Chad said pulling out a slip of paper and waving it at her, &quot;Coach gave me a pass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, well give it to me after class. Right now we're discussing Lucretia Borgia's role in the <br />
Renaissance,&quot; the teacher said.  Heads turned back to face her while Chad stood where he was doing all he <br />
could not to play with his nipples.  They had started to tingle the moment he entered the classroom. The <br />
teacher noticed him standing there, and ordered, &quot;Sit, Chad.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a thud as his backpack hit the floor along with his bum, as he sat right down on the floor where he <br />
was standing. Chad blushed, and apologized, &quot;Sorry, I slipped, guess I forgot to tie my shoes after practice.  <br />
He said as he climbed into a nearby empty desk.<br />
<br />
The teacher shook her head. Surreptitiously, Chad began to play with his nipples behind the textbook tilted up <br />
on his desk.<br />
<br />
Someone was asking about Disney's Shaggy Dog, and Lucretia Borgia's reputation as a witch. The teacher <br />
laughed.  Lucretia was just a child, &quot;If anyone was using poisons on her beaus it was her older brother and <br />
sister.  Mortality rates were high at the time, and it's quite likely that her first husband died naturally, <br />
but the subsequent deaths were more suspicious and created rumors that...&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad's mind was elsewhere.  He could smell baloney.  Not the stuff the teacher was spouting, but the luncheon <br />
meat.  The smell was coming from Dirk Bentwood's backpack.  <br />
<br />
Apparently, Dirk was the one who asked the question about the Shaggy Dog, as the teacher was now saying, &quot;If <br />
you had been here at the start of class - and this applies to you too Chad and Bill, you would have heard me <br />
say that I planned to limit the discussion of the Borgias to their historical context, and not include the <br />
frequent distortions regarding them in popular fiction, television and movies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dirk and Bill had been late too?  Chad's stomach rumbled, maybe he could get Dirk to share some of his lunch.  <br />
Chad was really hungry, and the smell of the baloney was making him salivate.  Maybe after class when he gave <br />
teacher one of his passes from the coach, Chad could bring up the subject with Dirk.<br />
<br />
Bill was playing with a small silver whistle, while the teacher spoke. He stole a glance out the window.  <br />
Right on cue, Coach Wilkins could be seen walking his pug dog on the edge of the playing field. Bill slipped <br />
the whistle to his mouth and blew.<br />
<br />
The shrill whistle caused Chad to cover his ears, but no one in the classroom seemed to hear it. The teacher <br />
fortunately had her back to Chad as she was pointing out Venice on the map.  Outside there was a loud yapping <br />
and the sound of the coach shouting for his dog to heel. Chad put down his hands, and hunkered down in his <br />
seat doing the best he could to heel.  A moment later, he was asking himself why he was trying to heel.<br />
<br />
Somehow Chad made it through the class without getting down on all fours and ripping the baloney out of Dirk's <br />
knapsack. The bell rang. He handed the teacher his signed pass. She commented that the coach had forgotten to <br />
fill in the date and time. Chad apologized saying he hadn't noticed, but they could fill them in now. The <br />
teacher just checked him present and erased the tardy checkmark.  Dirk and Bill apparently didn't have passes, <br />
and were both duly chastised. <br />
<br />
&quot;What's with the whistle, Bill?&quot; Chad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you saw how Coach's pug jumped when I blew it? Yeah, this dog whistle has been lots of fun.  You know <br />
that kid Dewey who trains service dogs? He's the reason I brought it to school, along with the coach of <br />
course, but he didn't have a dog today. Said something about him getting a new one after school,&quot; Bill rambled <br />
on. Chad's nose was leading him to follow Dirk, so he said, &quot;Yeah, Dewey's getting a new dog cool.  Catch you <br />
later, Bill.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill chuckled softly as Chad left him. Chad assumed it was all the commotion he planned to cause with Dewey <br />
and his new dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait up, Dirk.  Uh, you got baloney for lunch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, how d'ya know?&quot; Dirk asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't you smell it?&quot; Chad said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's in Tupperware, if you can smell it you must be really hungry,&quot; Dirk said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I am. Could you spare any of it?&quot; Chad asked.<br />
<br />
Dirk had an evil look on his face, &quot;How bad dya want it, stud? Are you willing to beg for it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Beg?<br />
<br />
Chad squatted down, his tongue hung out as he raised his hands in the classic dog-begging routine.<br />
<br />
Dirk laughed and extracted a slice of baloney from his sandwich, he dangled it over Chad's hungry eyes.  Chad <br />
jumped and grabbed it in his mouth. Dirk laughed, and tousled the hair on Chad's head, &quot;Good boy, Chad!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he went to class.<br />
<br />
Chad finished scarfing down the baloney. Looked around to see if anyone was around to have seen his <br />
embarrassing dog imitation.  He asked himself, if I'd do that for a slice of baloney, wonder what I'd do for a <br />
Klondike Bar? He scratched his head as he squatted there, and then his eye caught a glimpse of his shoe. Both <br />
his hands were on the floor, and he was scratching his head with his left foot.  He stopped scratching, stood, <br />
and headed to his next class.  Why was he acting so strangely?  He was just hungry - that was it.  He was on a <br />
new diet, and the fewer calories were taking their toll.  That had to be it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad, when did you stop shaving?&quot; Dave asked as Chad took his seat in mathematics class.  <br />
<br />
Chad rubbed his chin, and face, and it was covered with hair.  He had shaved this morning, but his night's <br />
growth wasn't as heavy as his beard was now.  It felt like a three day growth of beard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Need to get some new razor blades,&quot; was Chad's reply.<br />
<br />
Dave shrugged, &quot;Well, if you're going to grow a brown beard, you should stop bleaching your hair blonde.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't bleach my hair - does my beard really look brown?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Matches the roots of your hair, Chad,&quot; Dave answered shaking his head.<br />
<br />
The bell rang, and the teacher began his lesson.</p>
