<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m a monster,&quot; you said softly as you and Elizabeth began walking away from the convenience store where you had just had sex with two men and drained them of everything that made them &quot;alive,&quot; as any adult siren would.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you&#39;re not, Michelle,&quot; Elizabeth said from beside you, and softly enough that other people wouldn&#39;t hear her, &quot;You&#39;re a beautiful mermaid and what you did was natural...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Elizabeth they were human beings!&quot; you said to her, &quot;human beings! True they weren&#39;t the best people, but certainly they didn&#39;t deserve to have all their energy sucked out of them. I might as well have torn them apart.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then looked down as you walked, once again in the gray sweat-suit that was supposed to hid the voluptuous curves your body had taken on when a group of mermaids decided you were worthy and bestowed on you the gift of being like them. It didn&#39;t do that great a job as both of the men that you had just &quot;consumed&quot; had noticed your overall body dimensions. You began to hug yourself, hoping your arms could help conceal the fact that you had two fairly large breasts on your chest, even if they were covered by cotton fabric.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the only way we we can live, Michelle,&quot; Elizabeth insisted, &quot;I know this seems harsh to you, as being a mermaid is a new sensation for you... but you will have to get used to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But to just kill them like that?&quot; you asked her, &quot;suppose they had families?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d doubt men of that sort were in any truly loving relationship,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;if they are married, they&#39;d strike me as the type that would physically abuse their wives and children. The only thing they&#39;d truly love is power and money... I mean they were extremely eager to have sex with both of us upon meeting them. Granted, your pheromones were at the highest production because you were newly changed and needed to feed, but those men that are in loving relationships and are good men generally are able to resist our pheromones enough to get away, and we don&#39;t chase them down like lions chasing zebras.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or you turn them into sirens,&quot; you retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is nothing wrong with being one of us, Michelle,&quot; Elizabeth told you as the two of you walked along, &quot;you are beautiful, you are loving, you are as magical as I am. And once your wife joins us, we can live for a very long time out at sea and we can love one another.&quot;<br />
<br />
You glanced over to Elizabeth and gave a slight sigh. She looked like a sort of big sister/best friend that was trying to care for you, and the more you looked to her, the stronger those feelings became. It felt sort of like you were falling in love with her, which also made you feel bad. While Elizabeth was beautiful, you felt your wife was beautiful also, and the more these feelings toward Elizabeth grew, the more it felt like you were cheating on your wife. And that was something you really didn&#39;t want. <br />
<br />
Strangely, a part of your mind didn&#39;t feel that way about having sex with the two men and draining them. That part of your mind thought of them as nothing more than food. Generally, it didn&#39;t help you out very much, as you were still trying to come to grips with what you had just done. It also sent a shudder down your spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is their magic affecting me mentally too?&quot; you thought to yourself, &quot;Is the twenty four hours simply the time I have before my mind is completely a mermaid&#39;s and I see men as nothing more then food?&quot;<br />
<br />
You wanted to ask Elizabeth about this, but found yourself too embarrassed to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;And look at it this way, Michelle,&quot; Elizabeth continued as you both walked along, &quot;we don&#39;t need to feed every day. You&#39;ll probably be good for a few days. Though, you may have to help your wife feed shortly after she joins us.&quot;<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t want show this to Elizabeth, but that made you inwardly shudder a bit as well. You had stumbled onto the mermaids by accident. Thankfully they found you &quot;worthy&quot; and transformed you, instead of killing you outright, but when you voiced that you wanted to return to your wife... your human wife, they had told you that the only way they could allow you to return to your wife would be to find her, take her back to the beach, and transform her into a mermaid. If you did so, not only would you need to adjust to &quot;eating&quot; men every few days, but so would your wife. It was not something you liked, and made you feel all the more guilty at going along with it as you and Elizabeth walked along. The only reason that you had agreed to it was because you didn&#39;t want to die. If you didn&#39;t return to the beach with your wife and transform her, the deal with the mermaid&#39;s &quot;leader,&quot; Florencia, was that while you&#39;d become male again, you&#39;d be drained of your energy to protect the mermaid&#39;s existence and their home. <br />
<br />
Elizabeth was tasked to do that job if you failed, and she had said she would carry out the deal if you couldn&#39;t. She looked like she didn&#39;t want to do it, it was clear that she had accepted it. You still didn&#39;t want to die, and Elizabeth had been the friendliest toward you. The more you looked to her, the more you saw her as a sister, and you couldn&#39;t bring yourself to doing anything that would disappoint her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay, Michelle,&quot; Elizabeth said to you, as you began to make your way into a nicer part of town, in fact the very neighborhood where you and your wife lived.<br />
<br />
You glanced to see the looks on some of the people&#39;s faces that saw the two of you. You didn&#39;t know what they were thinking, but you were certain they didn&#39;t think much of you. You only walked along, hugging yourself and with Elizabeth having one arm around you in a fairly protective manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re coming up on my house now,&quot; you said to her slowly, and pointed toward the structure.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re making good time,&quot; Elizabeth said with a sisterly smile, &quot;Now, all we&#39;ll have to do is convince your wife to come back to the beach with us. We have tonight and most of tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
You only sighed as you reached out to open the door.</p>
