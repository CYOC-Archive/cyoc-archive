<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">MiMi got to her feet and began to walk about to the table. &quot;Well yesterday Sandra got first forth prize in the office raffle.&quot; She reached down and picked up the box and tossed it to Dan. He caught it out of the air. It had an image of a red headed clowngirl smirking on it, was labled &#39;New World Novelties Clown Noses&#39; and said that it contained six. For some reason he fixated on the packaging. The Girl on the package had the same amount of thought and care into her makeup as MiMi had. Beforehand he’d think she was cute enough in a weird way, now he fixated on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;She gave them to me because of the play, you know how much of Drama Nerd I am.&quot; She snorted as she laughed. &quot;And so last night when I was practicing the lines I popped one one like this.&quot; Somehow MiMi had managed to produce a small item from her pocket and jammed it on his nose in one swift motion. He felt a slight wet sensation on it for a moment, but this faded away. Dan staggered back a few steps in shock.<br />
<br />
MiMi was grinning ear to ear, fluttered her wings as she walked over and turned him around to face a full length mirror and leaned. &quot;...I&#39;m sure you can work out what happened next.&quot; He noticed the purple semi-sphere that now affixed itself to his face. It felt somewhat wet and gluey at first, but that quickly faded.<br />
<br />
“Oh very funny.” Dan said annoyed at this. No straight answer and a clown nose. was to attempt to remove the offending clown nose. Despite his efforts it did not budge. All it did was release a honking sound from his nostrils. Stranger still after a few moments he actually felt his finger against the rubbery surface. “What the hell?!”<br />
<br />
“Language there!” MiMi said tittering.<br />
<br />
Dan turned on her. “What did you do to me?”<br />
<br />
She grabbed him by the shoulders . “Oh, nothing I did not do to myself…” With an unnatural strength pulled him foward and pressed her nose against his with a pair of soft honks. It was a surprising pleasant sensation “DiDi!” Oddly enough he felt sweaty.<br />
<br />
“Wait, what?” He said as he fell back into the chair.<br />
<br />
“Oh just helped you along. What happened to me, Sunshine, and mommies Sweets and Bubbles was happening anyway at school today, just in in slooow-moooo.” She managed somehow to pitch those two words to replicate the audio effect. It was strange enough that it took his mind off of the names “Fair number of girls, some of the boys and even the grown-ups were are well on their way. It even started with you. It even started with you. You must have seen it. Come on, even you could not be THAT blind.”<br />
<br />
He remembered the student body at school and it’s changing coloration: brightly colored hair, pale complexions and hints of color. A thought that had been percolating in the back of his head came to the forefront. “So that’s…not makeup?”<br />
<br />
“Nope! This is 100% Natural MiMi Doodleshire!” She fluttered her wings and bobbed her her antennae.<br />
<br />
Dan did not consider any of this natural, but the semantics of that were not the most pressing matter. “And…we’re all turning into…c..c…CLOWNS!”<br />
<br />
“Not just that!” Said another voice behind him. “You’re all turning into CLOWNGIRLS!”<br />
<br />
He turned behind him and saw yet another Clowngirl that had grabbed his shoulder. She was dressed in a green flowery fairy dress like MiMi, wings and antennae. Unlike her she was done in in warm colors. Her hair was a glossy gold streaked with orange done up into two pigtails coming out of the sides of her head. Her nose was a yellow sphere, her eyes set in orange circles, yellow freckles sprinled her face and her wide lips were done in gold. Gold and orange marked out her gossamer wings. She was also noticeably taller and older than MiMi. He thought about Michelle’s 18 year old brother.<br />
<br />
“Are you…Steve?” Dan said to the new comer. His voice was now a bit higher pitched.<br />
<br />
”Sunshine Now!” She said with titter and a wink. “DiDi fixed me up last night soon after she’d fixed herself. Besides your shaping up quite well.”<br />
<br />
Sunshine produced a mirror from somewhere and showed Dan his face. It was not the ivory white of DiDi or Sunshine, but it was definitely on it’s way and was framed by a violet mop, growing rapidly. Dark purple lines had formed around his eyes and lavender was beginning to show up around them. His lips were already a glossy plumb color and had begun to fill out. Glistening beads of sweat rolled down hi body and where they touched his clothes they began to change. His arms and legs were a bit behind the rest of him. His shirt was now tighter and in spots turning green and glossy and growing at the bottom. At the same time (though he did not see it) his pants tightened and turned lilac. He stared as the changes proceeded for a few seconds and to his suprise he liked what he saw. Then Michelle entered the reflection and that was enough to snap him back and get him to turn on her.<br />
<br />
“How could you do this to me Mi….chelle!” For some reason he wanted to use her proper name. The one she’d been given at birth. Even so the Clown Name was stuck in his mind.<br />
<br />
“Well it would happen to you anyway given the way things were going. Might as well have a friend help you through it. Besides,” she snickered “you look better and it’s fun.”<br />
<br />
“Fun? FUN!” Dan said with mounting anger. “This is absolutely Absurd!” Small <br />
<br />
“Well DUH!” MiMi replied.<br />
<br />
“Careful MiMi, she’s got a temper!” Sunshine said.<br />
<br />
“I’m not a SHE!” Dan said as his facial features softened, his body slimmed and other changes were under way undermining said statement. A pair of stubby flaps appeared on his back through vents in what was increasingly becoming a dress and quivered angrily. “Change me back!”<br />
<br />
“Even if I could why would I want to do that?” MiMi said indignantly. “Why would you want to be Dower Dan when you be Dazzling DiDi?”<br />
<br />
“Because it’s me!” Dan said, with doubts building in the back of his mind.<br />
<br />
“No, that was you.” MiMi said “What you are now is DiDi.”<br />
<br />
“Believe me DiDi, this is MUCH better. I’m pretty, I’m adorable and i’m Hilarious!&quot; Sunshine said &quot;Mom and Mom both love it, my sister loves it, my girlfriend loves it and you’ll love it too.”<br />
<br />
“Stop Calling me that!” Dan said a distinctly girly voice. He put his hands to his…no, her mouth.<br />
<br />
“Why shouldn’t we? It is your name.”<br />
<br />
“No my name is…my name…my….name…” Her voice trailed off as visions filled her head. Of her getting up various antics and being the center of attention. But rather than harsh judgement they saw her as both cute and hilarious. Of a word which was sweet smelling, silly and beautiful where she was beloved by masses who were in of themselves worthy of love and affection. And the wonder that could be attained by spreading this blessing around. There was some resistance in her heart. But then from her forehead erupted two fuzzy Amethyst antennae and with that something in her minds clicked.<br />
<br />
“Is…DiDi!” She exclaimed. Her head was framed in a puffed out flair of violet highlighted with orchid purple highlights. Green gloves grew around her hands. Her wings grew out to about half her arms’ length. With that, DiDi Smiles was born.<br />
<br />
“Good to see that you’re now yourself!” MiMi said as she kissed the new clowngirl on the forehead. She grabbed. DiDi by the hand and led her to a full length mirror.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe that’s me.” DiDi said as she admired herself, a new fairy clown.<br />
<br />
“Neither did I when I became what I am now. But does grow on ya!”<br />
<br />
“It sure does.” DiDi said as she posed, fluttering her wings.<br />
<br />
“The only question is what do you do now?”</p>
