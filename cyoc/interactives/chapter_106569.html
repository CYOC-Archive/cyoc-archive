<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The now female Mr. Ferguson&#39;s reaction was natural, after al, Jamilla had forgotten to really program in any mental changes, after all, who wouldn&#39;t want to be an all powerful dragon? And Mr. Ferguson, as Jamilla himself had dimly noted, was a married man. And the female dragoness had no desire to see their loved ones harmed by this drunk with power dragon. <br />
<br />
Except... there was nothing she could have done anyway... Jamilla had already set the machine to be controlled mentally, and hadn&#39;t bothered to set up any physical or verbal controls. All Jamilla had to do now was think it, and the Chronovac would obey. <br />
<br />
And one thought occurred to Jamilla, one that showed he wasn&#39;t quite as bright as he liked to think he was... &#39;Why didn&#39;t I think of this sooner?&#39;<br />
<br />
Jamilla didn&#39;t want to harm... what was her new name now? Well, Jamilla could just pick one out for her if she didn&#39;t have one now. <br />
<br />
TransDem Labs itself existed in a pocket reality after one too many people tried to blow them up. Now they simply sent their machines to various universes through front companies to observe and record the results of those given ultimate power. <br />
<br />
Jamilla wired directly to the powered up Chronvac, proceeded to make several changes. <br />
<br />
First and foremost, there was still the reality of his insanely small horde... that wouldn&#39;t do... But there was a way to fix it that had been there from the beginning, but he hadn&#39;t even thought of, (Again Jamilla was shrewd but not all that brilliant, and his thinking tended to be narrow). <br />
<br />
And above everything he set the perception of reality change tab in his mental interface to ON with a few exceptions. <br />
<br />
The national guard soldiers outside didn&#39;t notice as their equipment and clothes vanished. Nor did they notice as many of them became bald, and very much none of them notice as they all became female, some of their figures were graceful and lithe, others were rounded and plump (but still beautiful), MANY were endowed with chest areas the size of which that might have caused back pains. But again, none of them noticed, they were too busy assuming alluring or majesty poses, that ran from sultry to standed that commanded respect. <br />
<br />
It was totally natural as bases appeared beneath their feet, and their bodies turned to gold, silver, platinum, and electrum. The statues themselves remained conscious, their thoughts echoing to each other, bragging which of them was the most beautiful, the most previous, the oldest, or the history as works of art. Now through a complex series of event including a lottery winning, a series of inheritances, and scavengers rights, the art gallery&#39;s worth of statues outside the store had all belonged to Jamilla and had for years. <br />
<br />
Mr. Ferguson for her part... suddenly wondered why she&#39;d been so upset about a bunch of statues that Jamilla owned. <br />
<br />
Jamilla was not done, that it was finally occurred to him (AT LONG LAST) that the reality perception option would make his life much easier, he had other changes to make. <br />
<br />
Christianna meanwhile, who was had been in the middle of charming the bewildered police officer, herself never noticed the changes that Master was making to her. <br />
<br />
Her borrowed bathrobe fell from her, and the clothes of the police officer vanished. Christianna&#39;s body was soon covered in green scales, and the office blue scales. He remained buff and muscular, but this was far, FAR from the end of the changes on either of them. <br />
<br />
This had been a happy accident on Jamilla&#39;s part, he had simply done a &#39;point and click&#39; style selection with Christianna who was in range of the machine, and the police officer had been just &#39;caught in the cross fire.&#39; <br />
<br />
Christianna gained a second pair of breasts. Meanwhile, the police officer gained four, and a feminine figure to match, a long with the internal plumbing. A second pair of arms grew from the two, as long with two long tails each that were perfect for manipulating objects. Their claws grew, perfect for digging. Their heads became decidedly reptilian if none of the manes of hair upon their heads that match the colors of their scales, much like their eyes. Then their head split into two, resulting in two heads on their shoulders, so one could rest while the other worked. Then leathery wings grew from their backs.<br />
<br />
The result was two humanoid dragons, each one had two tails, two legs, four arms, two wings, and two heads, and four breasts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wonderful to see you sister!&quot; Christianna&#39;s two heads cheered. <br />
<br />
&quot;You too sister!&quot; Said Becky&#39;s pair of heads in snyc. &quot;If there anything of value in this house for Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing worthy of Master&#39;s horde sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s be off sister.&quot; The two flew back to where Master and Mistress were waiting for them. <br />
<br />
A red humanoid dragoness much like them, looking like a Hindu goddess, flew and let them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello sisters!&quot; Her two heads said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Freda!&quot; Greeted Becky, her heads echoing. <br />
<br />
The three hugged, and flew towards where the two true dragons were. None of them aware Freda before had been Mrs. Ferguson a while before, least of all Freda. <br />
<br />
Jamilla then turned his attention of to.... Ryackre... that was her name now. <br />
<br />
Ryackre blinked a few times and said, &quot;Dear, we really should be getting your treasure back to the mine. We have a lot of work to do to make it a proper layer for us and our servants and cattle.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear, you&#39;re right.&quot; Said Jamilla. <br />
<br />
Jamilla then for fun made one final change... the herd of cattle began to stand on two legs, their front hooves now separating into three parts, functions and two fingers and an opposable thumb. Their wits... remained on the far lower end of the spectrum... but they were dimly aware that Jamilla was the reason the Herd existed, and it was their duty and honor to perpetually provide new cattle to sustain him, his mate, and their servants. One that they eagerly embraced.</p>
