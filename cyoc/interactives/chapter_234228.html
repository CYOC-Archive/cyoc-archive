<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim looked in shock at his new body that looked weird, like some sort of alien creature from a sci-fi horror movie.<br />
Tim looked at his arms uneasily. He saw that his skin wasn&#39;t a fleshy pink colour but they were now a orange colour with green veins throbbing under the skin. His orange hands were about twice their normal size, with six fingers and a thumb with black fingernails. Closing his hand slowly in a grabbing motion, Tim saw that he had 4 joints in each finger.<br />
<br />
His gaze wandering down to his chest, Tim took in the changes there.<br />
Tim noticed that the orange skin became black and chitinous where his collarbone is. As he surveyed his upper torso, he found that his chitin covered pecs were now larger than before, now they resembled a pair of B cup breasts about the same size as Allison&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Tims inspection of his body continued to the midsection. He saw that the chitin covered his midsection which lengthened by roughly a foot. He saw that he had no navel, his longer stomach being smooth with a 16 pack of abs. Tim looked past his stomach to see the black chitin further down. His waist was about the same size as before but more muscled, leading down to his hips and crotch. Tim observed that his crotch had disappeared under a black chitinous plate, blocking any access to his genitals. Tim was curious about what changes occurred to it, but he decided to wait until he were alone. Tims thoughts about his crotch aside, he saw that his hips were wider than they were before and that the chitin transitioned back to orange skin.<br />
<br />
Looking at his legs, Tim saw that the orange skin was covering strong thighs that were about the same size as before. Although his legs now had two knees, the top ones were normal while the bottom ones were reversed. The inside of his legs were light grey. Tims calves were thick, the lower legs being a mix of orange skin and chitin. He saw that his feet now distinctly larger than before. Covered in orange skin, his feet had seven long flexible webbed toes.<br />
Tim finally got around to seeing his own head in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Tims neck was about 6 inches long and stronger than before. The front of his neck was covered in flexible grey chitin, while the back of his neck was enclosed in a dark grey chitin.<br />
<br />
The skin on his face was a light orange with black chitin on his cheeks and above his eyes. Tim saw that his nose was no more, in its place was flapped slits with small black scales surrounding them. He peered at his mouth which was now a set of four mandibles, two sets above and two below. Tim opened his mouth cautiously and saw that his teeth looked surprisingly normal, with his tongue now longer and a deep green.<br />
<br />
You gazed into your eyes seeing that the irises were no longer blue, but were now green with gold flecks with horizontal pupils.<br />
<br />
He took in the strange shape of his skull. Tims now larger humanoid skull, he saw, had an elongated shape and his brown hair was no more. He saw that the orange skin was over most of his head, with bony ridges leading to the back of his head from his brow, and chitin plates covering his temples. The head was framed by dark green tendrils which flowed down to his shoulders, and his ears now appeared to look like light green fins.<br />
<br />
Tim shifted around on his bed taking a closer look at his body, and touching different parts. He was prodding some orange-grey segmented plates that ran down from the armpits to his hips.<br />
&quot;How am I in this body?&quot; Tim asked, nodding at his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Tim, we had to use one of our projects involving an alien species. It was a long shot, but we had to try something,&quot; Saunders said. &quot;You were so badly injured that you were barely alive. We couldn&#39;t just let you die.&quot;<br />
&quot;So you put me in a fucking alien body?&quot; Tim asked annoyed.<br />
&quot;Yes, it was the only way. Your brain was still working, we needed to find a way to save you, and quickly, or we would lose you,&quot; Kerry explained.<br />
Tim felt angry at them for what they did, but he also realized that they saved his life.<br />
&quot;Well, what do I do now?&quot; Tim asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do I do now?&quot; Tim asked.<br />
&quot;Well we need to do a few check-ups first, to see if you&#39;re healthy. Then we&#39;ll move -&quot; Dr Kerry trailed off when he saw Tim poking different parts of his face in a stunned muteness.<br />
Reading his body language, Dr Saunders continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could do the test when you want to. We could organise your girlfriend to visit. The phone is on the table there.&quot; Saunders said, pointing to the table besides Tim. &quot;You might want to rest or even check your body when we leave. The choice is yours.&quot;<br />
With that the doctors led his parents out before they closed the door.</p>
