<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah followed the Great River with Chatok and Aminu in tow. He saw Ruut waving at him and Maa&#39;ti next to him. He would see Maati after he was done with his work. <br />
<br />
Sarah saw that Maa&#39;ti look startled while looking in her direction. Sarah knew that she had changed, but was it really that much? Sarah didn&#39;t want to consider it, so she focused on processing what was left of the kill while crouching low - the low working stance common among the tribes hunters. Her height hadn&#39;t changed much since she hadn&#39;t been much taller when she was as girl, but she knew that a boy her current size will likely be quite large, and broad. She struggled not to be proud of that fact.<br />
<br />
Sarah was distressed to know her breasts were gone - she had the flat chest of a teen boy. Where once was fat was lean muscle. Her arms were different too. She felt a strength that she didn&#39;t have before. She felt her body losing its softness. Her legs lost their silkiness becoming more suited to a teen-aged male. Her legs started to itch - she denied it, but deep down she knew it meant that she was sprouting leg hair. What Sarah didn&#39;t was her skin darkening to match the tribe, nor did she the hair on her head become her new peoples dark brown brown - her dirty blond coloring faded away.<br />
<br />
Sarah finished her work, and stood to deliver the spoils. Her path took her near the banks of The Great River. Sarah felt her eyes being drawn further down the river, where the women of the tribe were just finishing their evening bath. She found that she couldn&#39;t look away from the girls. <br />
<br />
Sarah had never looked at another girl like this before, but she couldn&#39;t help admire them. She caught the eyes of some of the girls. She had an urge to show off, and flexed her muscles. The girls giggled at his antics, bright smiles across their faces. Their smiles sent a chill down Sarah’s spine and gave her an alien feeling between her legs. <br />
<br />
Disturbed, Sarah looked for Maa&#39;ti. She saw the little girl with a happy expression take off toward the river. Sarah felt a pit in her stomach; Was she too late? She heard Aminu saying, &quot;Those girls are attractive aren&#39;t they?&quot; Chatok muttered, &quot;I really don&#39;t get what&#39;s so special.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sarah averted her, eyes attempting to ignore them, and crouched at the riverside alongside Chatok to wash herself. She washed her arms, and saw the changes. The once light skin now had the same dark pigmentation as the rest of the tribe. She washed her face and felt its shape with her rough hands - her once thin nose was now broad, both her eyes a different shape, and he mouth had wider lips. She could no longer image herself as the white girl she was. <br />
<br />
In fact, the thought of having light skin made her insides squirm. She now understood intimately the pride her black tribe(class)mates had shown in their heritage. It made her feel ashamed of her past behavior. Now she suspected she was in the distant past among their forefathers, the boy she was becoming might even be one of their ancestors. Even if she could go back to being a girl, she wasn&#39;t sure   <br />
she wanted to lose her wonderful dark skin even with the very real discrimination that existed in her world.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts were interrupted by Nequi, &quot;Deep thoughts, son?&quot; he asked. Sarah could feel herself slipping into Saa&#39;rok mindset in the presence of his father. Saa&#39;rok answered, &quot;No, father I was distracted.&quot; Nequi&#39;s eyes gleamed with humor. &quot;Perhaps you were looking at the girls?&quot; Saa&#39;rok looked embarrassed and stammered, &quot;N-no, I was...&quot; Nequi placed his broad hands on his son&#39;s back, &quot;My son, do not be embarrassed, you are becoming a man. It is only natural you would take interest in the girls.&quot; Nequi stood and said,  &quot;Now, I will leave you to your thoughts. I will await you at the tribes feast.&quot; Sarah shuddered, she had seemlessly became Saa&#39;rok. Most disturbingly she could feel a yearning in her soul to be Saa&#39;rok.  <br />
<br />
She once again looked at the girls hoping to feel anything other than attraction. However, she once again felt that odd tingle, but it was soon joined by a pleasant warmth. Sarah let out a quiet grunt at the feeling, which grew more intense with each passing moment. Without thinking, she adjusted the posture of her crouch to let her legs spread a bit wider. The pouch in the front of her loincloth began to bulge forward slightly before a gentle weight seemed to settle down into it. Sarah felt an itch and reached down to scratch just under her loincloth, where a few wiry hairs had sprouted. Unbidden, she felt pride that she was growing into a man.<br />
<br />
Sarah knew it was her last chance to find Maa&#39;ti, or she would be would be Saa&#39;rok forever. Sarah paused, she? No, It was wrong, all wrong. He? Him? Yes, that sounded much better. Sarah&#39;s eyes widened realized he no longer could deny his masculinity. This body was comfortable, as if he was born into it.<br />
<br />
He found Maa&#39;ti at the rivers edge. She was once again bickering with Ruut as usual. Sarah called out her, &quot;Maa&#39;ti, I must speak to you.&quot; Maa&#39;ti&#39;s reaction surprised him. She squeaked, then blushed in embarrassment, like a pre-teen girl with a crush. Sarah remembered Saa&#39;rok thinking she was cute, and thought of her fondly like a little sister. He had always humored the girl, fully aware of her crush. Despite her crush she started calling him brother; Maa&#39;ti confessed while blushing profusely that she knew that they&#39;d never be together, but she couldn&#39;t help herself. Sarah knew then Maa&#39;ti accepted her rebirth. <br />
<br />
He asked hesistently, &quot;Maa&#39;ti, how did you know who you were?&quot; Maa&#39;ti whispered reverently, &quot;The Goddess came to me. She showed me what I could be, and I felt joy, and peace.&quot; She became impassioned, &quot;They are our people, Brother.&quot; Sarah felt Maa&#39;ti&#39;s words resonate. &quot;Look Around! This is our tribe. We speak the same tongue. Share our culture - the same wonderful dark skin. If that doesn&#39;t sway you then consider your father who loves you, or your apprentice Chatok who looks up to you.&quot; Maa&#39;ti smiled mischievously, and said, &quot;Besides I saw you looking the older girls. I know you liked what you saw, and your becoming a strong man. A skilled hunter like you could choose any one of them.&quot; Sarah was wavering when Maa&#39;ti spoke of their people, but her last appeal to his masculinity pushed him over the edge. <br />
<br />
Sarah closed his eyes, and let Saa&#39;rok in. Saa&#39;rok smiled at Maa&#39;ti, &quot;Thank you, sister. You have a gift, surely The Goddess speaks through you.&quot; He turned to Ruut and said, &quot;You were right to help me, despite your impulsiveness.&quot; Ruut exclaimed childishly, &quot;See Maa&#39;ti I was right.&quot; Maa&#39;ti stuck out her tongue. Unfortunately for her, Maa&#39;ti&#39;s mother came to collect her. &quot;Daughter, you know better.&quot; Saa&#39;rok saw Maa&#39;ti roll her eyes. <br />
<br />
Saa&#39;rok smiled, everything felt right. Praise The Goddess and The Ancestors. Maybe tomorrow he would find a girl, or if he was lucky, tonight at the feast - His loins stirred just thinking about them. As walked toward the village center he saw his reflection in a water bowl, and was pleased with what he saw.</p>
