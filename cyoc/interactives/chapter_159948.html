<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After helping Melissa with the shower, as it was a little hard for her to navigate her bathroom at her current height, Joey explored her apartment a little.  She lived alone, though her apartment was decent-sized.  He realized he knew very little about his lover.  Was she rich?  Did she have a job?<br />
<br />
She had a very nice computer, and a decent entertainment center, plus a Bose stereo.  There were some musical instruments, as well as books on music, art, history, computer science, and the occult.  Most of which seemed serious, not like that New Age crap.  The decor was...a little creepy.  While he wouldn&#39;t call her neat (she apparently had no problems tossing her clothing on the floor at random and leaving it there until laundry day), the apartment was far from dirty.<br />
<br />
The kitchen was...understocked, and to his surprise, she seemed to live on the same diet he did.  Food ordered from restaurants, like pizza or chinese, cereal, some ice cream in the freezer, and instant ramen.  He did see some free weights and a yoga mat, but he had to wonder how she stayed so fit, eating that stuff.<br />
<br />
Which meant he had to order food...or...<br />
<br />
With his seemingly godlike powers (which, shouldn&#39;t he be using for good or something?), Joey conjured up some really good food from his favorite Cantonese place in Chinatown.  The so-called Dinner for Two, which he always felt was more like a Dinner for Four.  When Melissa came out, he was munching on some crab rangoon.<br />
<br />
She was wrapped in a towel, looking for all the world like an innocent little girl.  Her hair was wrapped in a similar towel as she sauntered up to him.  Her kitchen featured a table with bar stools on one side, and she contemplated hopping up on one but paused.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Wish boy, I used to be into gymnastics, but I&#39;m kind of weak at this size.  I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d help me up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even better, Melissa.  I&#39;ll just make you as strong as a bodybuilder twice your size.&quot;<br />
<br />
She gasped with surprise as she felt power enter her body, although she only seemed to gain a little tone.  &quot;Oh yeah?  Why not even stronger?  Afraid I could beat you up?&quot;<br />
<br />
He laughed.  &quot;I know you could beat me up, Melissa.  I just figured you&#39;d need some time to get used to your strength before I try to make you into Supergirl.&quot;<br />
<br />
She vaulted onto the bar stool effortlessly, the towel on her head falling off to reveal long, damp, raven tresses.  &quot;How strong could you make me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea.  I&#39;m willing to find out though.  I like having a girlfriend who can kick ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed.  &quot;Well then, how about you make me indestructible while you&#39;re at it?  You know, fast healing, hard to hurt, immune to poison and disease, immortality, that sort of thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey considered that.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure what that would do your physiology.  Let&#39;s start small, instead of indestructible, how about really resistant to all that stuff.  Like, beyond human limits, but just slightly.&quot;<br />
<br />
She waved her hand in a dismissive gesture.  &quot;Sure thing, Wish boy.  Increased stamina too, please.  I plan on screwing you all night tonight.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am, coming right up!&quot;  He willed his desires into being.  Nothing seemed to change about her appearance.  Idly, he gave himself a similar treatment- just in case.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t upgraded your appearance to look like young Brad Pitt or something.&quot;  She rested her chin on the countertop cutely.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...you know, I never gave it much thought.  You said I was cute, so why mess with a good thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Joseph, you&#39;re actually pretty special- despite being a perverted horndog with god powers.&quot;  She grinned like a cat.  &quot;Now get me a plate of that General Tso&#39;s and some of that rangoon, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your wish...literally...is my command.  It might be easier to eat if I made you a little bigger though.&quot;<br />
<br />
She seemed thoughtful.  &quot;Yeah, maybe a foot taller?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before his eyes, she began to grow, her towel coming loose and falling to the floor.  She kicked her legs, her feet still far from the floor.  &quot;Yes, I really like this, Wish boy.  I know that&#39;s partly your doing, but I don&#39;t care.  There&#39;s so much fun we&#39;re going to have.  I just hope you don&#39;t ever get bored with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He mock considered that, rubbing his chin.  &quot;I don&#39;t know, ask me again after I turn you into a winged elf-centaur.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes got round as saucers.  &quot;Oh fuck...you could do that, couldn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see why not, but it might have some odd effects on your biology.&quot;<br />
<br />
She waved that off as well.  &quot;You&#39;ll figure it out...you using some big words there, Wish boy.  Are you actually smart, too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I guess so?  I&#39;m not a genius.  But I do like science, and I was thinking to go into medicine, maybe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course now, why bother, you have the power to do whatever you want.  Hey you could even be a genius if you wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shrugged.  &quot;I like our current dynamic.  I&#39;m just smart enough to keep up with you, but you&#39;re obviously the brains of the outfit.&quot;<br />
<br />
She shoveled some food into her mouth, unconcerned with her nudity.  &quot;You&#39;re an odd duck, but I love you.  You do remember I&#39;m the sub here, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know, it&#39;s just...I&#39;m cool with you being better than me at stuff.  It keeps things interesting.&quot;  He mirrored her consumption of vast quantities.<br />
<br />
She giggled.  &quot;Oh man, I can&#39;t remember the last time I giggled before I met you.  I hated letting people see my girly side.  But I like being girly around you.  Should I just give up the goth thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!  I mean, not unless you want to.  But I like it.  Maybe not the piercings, or the tattoos, but your outfits are amazing.  The boots could go, I guess.  But your style is a part of you, and I...I really like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed.  &quot;But you don&#39;t love me, yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I do, I swear.  You...you complement me.  The fact that you&#39;re ok with my fetishes helps a lot too.  I&#39;m just still in that &#39;is this real&#39; stage...I guess.  I&#39;m sorry.  Do you want me to?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shook her head violently, causing her hair to whip around.  &quot;Ugh, I might need to tie this back.  Figures you&#39;d like girls with stupid long hair.  Do you realize how much maintenance this is going to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could...&quot;<br />
<br />
She held up a hand.  &quot;Stop, just stop.  Let&#39;s be clear on a few things here.  Even if I don&#39;t like it, the fact that you like it, and you like the way I look...it&#39;s so important now, that I kind of like it by default.  Uh, that didn&#39;t come out quite right, but you understand me, I hope.  If you wanted me to put on a cheerleader outfit, I&#39;d hate it...but if it fired your engines, I&#39;d love it, too.  I want you to look at me and be happy with what you see.  I make a big show about not caring what people think, but I do care what you think.<br />
<br />
And don&#39;t force yourself to be in love with me.  Really, it was unfair of me to ask you to make me love you the way I do now.  It&#39;s probably overwhelming.  I was being selfish, but it was the only thing that really stopped me from being able to share everything with you.  And now that I have it, I...love it.  I love being in love.  Sure, you could hurt me really badly, and part of me knows that.  But I&#39;m tired of protecting myself all the time.  Of being lonely.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve had lovers, but this is an apartment for one.  I don&#39;t have any relationships, really.  Few friends.  But now there&#39;s you, Wish boy.  I want to hold onto this feeling for as long as I can.  And if you ever decide we&#39;re done...turn me into a statue or something.  Because I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d want to get over you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry.  It&#39;s not fair to say all that stuff to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He set down his plate and walked over to her, putting his arms around her body in a hug.  &quot;Melissa...I had no idea how hurt you were inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re all damaged goods, Joe.  We all have scars.  On the inside, even if you&#39;ve made all my visible ones vanish.  But you&#39;ve done more for me than I have words for.  Even if it&#39;s just magic...I knew that eventually I would be in love with you, or be afraid of you.  I like this option better.&quot;  She cuddled into his embrace, and they kissed for a long time.<br />
<br />
She pulled away.  &quot;Enough maudlin&#39;.  I think one of those physiological changes you were talking about is in play.   I&#39;m stupid hungry.  Let&#39;s finish eating, and then we can go have some more fun, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, hyper metabolism.  Well that&#39;s okay, I don&#39;t mind a girl who can pack it in at all.&quot;  He kissed her on the head, and they both got back to serious eating.<br />
<br />
Which Melissa totally blew him away at, as she finished everything he couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where the hell did you put it all?&quot;  He placed his hand on her tummy.  &quot;You&#39;re as flat as a washboard!&quot;<br />
<br />
She made a &#39;hmph&#39; noise and put her hands on her chest.  &quot;I beg to differ!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I mean!&quot;<br />
<br />
She grinned.  &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t have an answer.  I don&#39;t even feel like I need to go to the bathroom.  I guess my new metabolism burns calories really efficiently.  Almost no waste products.  I can live with that.  So, what did you decide we should do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welll....&quot;</p>
