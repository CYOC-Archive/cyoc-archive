<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Jen walked through the halls of her school, people did look at her funny, kyles curse didn&#39;t make her new form normal, it just made it that people only remembered Jen looking like a four legged fat girl.<br />
<br />
When she got to her locker, thankfully it was on the bottom row. Sadly it still had a normal lock on it. She tapped the lock with one of her front legs and sighed. She looked around and saw her friend Rachel standing near the front office. Jen plodded over and tapped her friends foot to get her attention. &quot;Hey Rachel, can you give me a hand opening my locker?&quot; Rachel looked around and then looked down and saw Jen. Since Jen was about the same height as an average dog.<br />
<br />
Rachel smiled and said &quot;Sure Jen, which ones yours again?&quot; Jen smiled back as she looked up to her friend &quot;Thanks, I&#39;ll show you.&quot; she walked over to her locker and got Rachel to open it. Inside she saw no school books, only a laptop and a strange long rubber tool. Rachel took the laptop and rested it on Jens back, then picked up the rubber tool and held the wide end infront of Jens mouth. &quot;C&#39;mon Jen, I don&#39;t wanna hold your gross typing stick, take it.&quot; Rachel complained. &quot;Oh sorry...&quot; Jen said as she bit the solid rubber object. &quot;Thanksh Rashel.&quot;<br />
<br />
After this the bell rang for the students to go to class. Jens first class was english. She went into the classroom and looked around. How could she sit at a desk like this? Her worries were mostly solved when the teacher saw her, Mr Marley. He gestured over to the corner of the room where what looked like a dog bed was on the floor, with a wooden desk, presumably for her laptop. <br />
<br />
Jen walked over over to the dog bed, her face bright red, the fact she had to sit on a dog bed to do her work. Was every class going to be like this? A dog bed in every room? One of many things she would have to get used to. She was struggling through making notes while using the solid rubber in her mouth to hit the keys. When class was done a realization hit her. next was PE, and her teacher, Mr Park was very strict and rude in his lessons. Despite warnings from the principal.<br />
<br />
At the changing rooms, she kicked the door open and went inside, she looked over to her friends and saw them sigh. She was confused as to why they looked annoyed to see her, then she realized. They would have to help her get changed into her PE clothes, thankfully reality changed so she would always have clothes that fit her. so in her PE locker there were some shorts and a sports top, both large size despite her being so short. <br />
<br />
She wriggles around attempting to get her shirt off without also accidentally making her bra come undone aswell, since her new body had fairly large breasts, they would be a struggle to get back into a bra. Again, Rachel had to come to Jens aid. Helping her our of her skirt and shirt and into her PE clothes. After this all the girls went out onto the football field.<br />
<br />
On the field Mr Park was standing like a military general, He stood proud despite having a prominent beer gut. He was still in somewhat good shape for an older man. He was staring at the group of boys and group of girls. &quot;Ok ladies, I want all of you to make 3 laps around the playing field, once youre done, go to the basketball court inside the hall. Except you Jen, you just keep running laps, lord knows you need it. Boys! Go get the football equipment out of the container and get ready for training.&quot; Mr Park shouted. <br />
<br />
Jens face turning bright red as she was called out in front of everyone, hearing giggling from both the boys and the girls. She began an attempt at running around the field, and after less than a third of a lap she was completely out of breath, usually she would be able to do 2 laps before even feeling it, that was her old body though. Eileens body was not suited to exercise, especially in this altered form. She slowed down to a light waddle to catch her breath, as she craned her neck to the side and saw the boys running and tackling eachother. The one that stood out was Mikey, the quarterback, he was tall and extremely well built, she had always had a crush on him, even if he was an asshole, he was attractive to jen. Before today she would have had a chance with him, but now she would be lucky if he would even look at her. Why would the school quarterback ever want to go out with a short fat four legged girl. <br />
<br />
She barely managed 2 laps before it was time for her next class. The rest of her school week went as smooth as it could. she forgot that after a week, she wouldn&#39;t be stuck with that body anymore, the next person she touched would be. <br />
<br />
After the week was done, Jen was somewhat used to her new body. She managed to get to school without touching anyone, although she didn&#39;t actively avoid it. She went to her locker which now had a lock she could open with her mouth. When she opened the door she saw that her typing stick was way at the back of the locker, she was struggling to reach it, her shoulder cheeks making it hard to fit, she squeezed her way in. Her large butt raised up wiggling back and forth, she jumped when she felt someone smack her ass quite hard. <br />
It was:</p>
