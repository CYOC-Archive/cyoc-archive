<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr. Steinburg was cringing at her vernacular. One didn&#39;t become a Senior 3 and not gain some amount of Haze resistance... but that was the issue. She merely had a decent resistance allowing her to remember herself and keep most of her mental faculties. Her issue was that her actions were filtered through this somewhat ditzy version of herself. At the very least she still recognized Quincy... despite her being male... The only issue was the two found some brat... Oh god they didn&#39;t give birth and age up their kid did they? <br />
&quot;Come on Quincy, I did some reading. You need to be careful with blue eyes over there.&quot; Claudia said<br />
<br />
Quincy a little uncertain what was going on said &quot;Quincy doesn&#39;t understand...&quot;<br />
&quot;Cmon, it&#39;s me your step-sis Claudia! We&#39;ve been through so much it hurts that you don&#39;t recognize me. Although I guess I do sound kinda funny don&#39;t I?&quot; Claudia thought as the Dr. in her mind was thinking of trying to get her more eloquent thoughts across properly. <br />
&quot;Teach?&quot; Quincy asked still male. Patricia... Pete... whoever was getting the food. Claude found this young woman very interesting... Her mind was messed up, but it wasn&#39;t as messed up. He figured he could gleam a lot of information if he could understand half the words she was thinking. This was probably one of the few times he got more information out of what someone was saying instead of what they were thinking. <br />
&quot;Whose this kiddy? You two get REALLY close?&quot; Claudia asked<br />
Quincy blushed and said &quot;No... I mean we were in the same bed bu-&quot;<br />
Claude sensed that Claudia&#39;s mind stopped being as eloquent and went into something of a rage as she said &quot;Oh no she didn&#39;t!&quot; Claudia said.<br />
&quot;She didn&#39;t what Claudy?&quot; a Patricia asked as she brought some food back. One corndog, some fried oysters, and some fried chicken. <br />
Quintus and Claude went for their orders and started eating as fast as they could... Until their appetites were lost. Claude was after all a small kid trying to eat two entrees, and Quincy was dealing with a lot of grease. <br />
&#39;Hey Claudy want some of my fried chicken?&quot; Patricia asked<br />
Claudia smiled but said &quot;No thanks. I have too many of those and I&#39;ll totally get fat.&quot; Dr. Steinberg however catching eye contact could see those icy blues dimming as the other two ate. Good... The haze was still affecting this entity child&#39;s mind significantly. She&#39;d need a plan to properly train this 5 or she could become a problem. The Dr. understood what the 2&#39;s or possibly even 1 were trying to do with making Pete an agent, but it presented risks. <br />
<br />
In the end Patricia got a box for her fried chicken, and the other two only got a third of the way through their food. Claude managed to grow a bit of his penis back, but as the corn dog was a hot dog on a stick and was easily transportable... He figured that he could just eat it throughout the day. Quincy on the other hand tried to keep funneling oysters into her mouth despite her body&#39;s protests. This maleness was wrong, and the oysters were getting rid of her dick and bringing back her softness and squishiness. Then it all came up. Not any of the corndog, but all the fried oysters and any breasts or femininity she had gained was lost along with the oysters. <br />
&quot;Quintus!&quot; Patricia shouted &quot;You ok babe? Here have some water... A sir do you have any cleaning supplies here?&quot; <br />
Claudia smirked and said &quot;Probably shouldn&#39;t have tried that my little brother.&quot; <br />
Quincy sipping some water asked &quot;What do you mean?&quot; <br />
Claudia held her index finger up and said &quot;One Entity in the world that is the most important. Karma. If something happens to you and you try to fight it with something similar it&#39;ll probably do more harm. What comes around goes around.&quot; That 2 could make Entity 1 True Love all he wanted. That didn&#39;t make Entity 1 True Love. Karma however seemed to be everywhere in one form or another. Send a Blue Earth request and get forced into this obnoxious form. Wasn&#39;t equal necessarily, but it seemed to pop up every now and then if you tried to cheat an Entity with basically itself. In theory she could&#39;ve easily just went back into the chronopotty and came back older. Then again it could&#39;ve easily made her Senile or a baby and neither would&#39;ve been good especially with the Haze. Perhaps it was some of Dr. Steinberg&#39;s other sins that had put Quincy in a form she obviously hated, and the Haze manipulator. <br />
<br />
Dr. Steinberg remembered reading the reason for why the civilization was wiped out. The Idol seemed to create people with some ability to manipulate Haze. Their testings showed that there was some amount of natural haze in extremely low doses most places, and those of gen 1 or 2 of a powerful Idol burst could learn to concentrate those low doses and manipulate reality just a little. Not enough to seriously alter reality that much, but enough so that instead of some girl wearing a skirt she may be wearing some shorts. Or maybe swapping the relationships of people at a double date. Nothing that would seriously affect the physical world too much. The internal mind of Dr. Steinberg theorized that since basically all the Haze in the fair was artificial it may have more affect than natural Haze on Pete, and having someone who could tailor how Haze smoothed things over would be invaluable. The issue came with why it took generations for G.E.T. to erase the civilization and people from reality. There were some that seemed to be able to use Haze to get extremely high priority. In a sense being able to negate many Entity&#39;s transformation powers. Even something like Blue Earth. The power just had to be diluted enough that no one could accidentally awaken to that kind of power as they were all wiped out... but if there were only a handful completely loyal to G.E.T. that would be a different story apparently. <br />
<br />
What was happening while Dr. Steinburg thought was Quincy trying to really think and learn an entity lesson other than &quot;Don&#39;t mess with any entities.&quot; that being &quot;Don&#39;t try to use the same Entity to try to negate the effects.&quot; assuming that Karma thing was actually Entity 1. There may not be a lot of hard rules to Entities, but Quincy had to wonder if maybe wandering into a beneficial effect by &quot;accident&quot; could save the day. <br />
&quot;You feeling better Quintus?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes Pete...&quot;<br />
&quot;I told you stop with the Pete nickname.&quot;<br />
Quincy thought for a second and Patricia had a list of attractions to go to... Which one did she think could help them with the situation more than the others?</p>
