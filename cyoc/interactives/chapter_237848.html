<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tommy, or rather Tom, had exited the sauna. He decided to put his damp jersey back on, feeling the cool air across his lightly defined six pack abs since it was more like a makeshift crop top now. What used to be a kid just starting middle school was now a fourteen year old just starting highschool after just five minutes of being drenched in the spa&#39;s magical steam. The young man, at least perhaps he was just old enough to be CONSIDERED a young man, was now twice the size he once was, being about a whole foot taller with a decent layer of thick muscles that were being snugly hugged by his clothing.<br />
<br />
On top of that, Tom was hot. Figuratively by his new peers of course, but mostly literally. The freshly made teen was sweating up a storm, his ill-fitting garments drenched in a new, slightly musky scent that started being created now that he’s started the march to adulthood. “Uhh…Lilianne?” He called out again, feeling awkward and surprised by his voice. It sounded a bit lower, a bit husky like that of an older boy who’s voice was just beginning to drop and mature.<br />
<br />
“Almost there, Tommy! Just a second!” Lilianne’s voice echoed before magically warping into the room. “Woah! Holy shit, how’d you do that?” Tom exclaimed, feeling heated in his face for multiple reasons. The heat of the spa experience, the realization he just asked a dumb question because he already knew the answer, the fact that he might as well be naked with how small his clothes look which led to the feeling of embarrassment in front of this woman, and the feeling of affection toward Lilianne. “Why, magic, of course! How else would you get this big?” She smiled, scanning his body before looking back to his slightly older looking face, straight in the eyes. “And boy…you sure did get big.” She teased.<br />
<br />
It took Tom a second to realize, indeed, he’s now at eye level with Lilianne, now just a bit taller by mere inches. He used to be so small compared to her, but now…Tom began to smile a bit sheepishly. He kinda liked it. “Aheheh, yeah…I guess.” He chuckled. He tried really hard not to let his eyes wander, the boy now being able to notice just how visually appealing she is. It reminded him of Ms. Bruner with how big her chest is. He didn’t know it yet, but his attraction had evolved past that of a mere crush. No, he felt something much more intense as he admired her, feeling that thing between his legs starting to firm up again and push out from his shorts, making the big bulge he had even bigger. Tom became acutely aware of this and felt even more hot in his cheeks. What was happening to him?<br />
<br />
Lilianne took notice of this. “So, big boy, how did it go again? You said something about shooting stuff?” She asked, though she was just playing dumb to get him to talk. “O-Oh, yeah, I uhm…I shot this white, sticky stuff out onto the floor. Sorry about that. I don’t know what happened to me.” Tom repeated, feeling a little flustered from doing what essentially felt like peeing to him, but differently.<br />
<br />
From that, the witch responded “I see…” She made a thinking pose, watching the teen look a little guilty. It was pretty cute seeing him act this way, in fact, Tom was starting to look cute in a different sense. Definitely on the path to becoming quite a heartthrob, that’s for sure. ‘It seems puberty’s hitting this kid like a truck now. I better do something to catch him up mentally.’ She thought. “Well, how about I help you understand what you’re going through? Don’t worry, kid. All humans go through this. It’s normal.” She tried her best to be gentle with him.<br />
<br />
“Really?” Tom’s eyes widened with curiosity. “So then what was that stuff I just made?” The woman began to explain, but also began to recite something under her breath. Sparkly magic particles gathered at her hand as she gently raised it up nonchalantly. “That was semen. Guys your new age probably call it ‘cum.’” Lilianne’s hand moved from her face to Tom’s, a warm glow emanating from it as she gently caressed his cheek. “Cum, huh?Mmm…” Suddenly, the young teen didn’t feel so anxious anymore. Instead, he felt a warm, comfortable radiation. Tom leaned into her hand, his own hand, which had grown a lot bigger, moving up to hold it to his face. He felt so relaxed now…<br />
<br />
Lilianne continued to explain. “Yes. A boy can make that stuff from down there when he hits a certain age. Your brain kind of mingles with the rest of you to start pumping hormones, the stuff you’re feeling right now, into your body. That ‘boy thing’ you have is called a penis. Teens your age call it a ‘cock.’” Tom was listening intently, almost as if this information was being injected into his mind, making him immediately understand it. “Heheh, my cock…that sounds kinda funny.” He made a dumb, jockish grin.<br />
<br />
What was happening was that Lilianne was using magic to accelerate Tommy’s mental age, giving him the years of school and memories that he missed. It was something she didn’t account for with her younger guests, as she’d never really had kids use the sauna much before. Definitely had to update the brew formula for the aging water, that’s for sure. Currently, Tommy was mentally twelve and was quickly catching up to his body’s age. He looked down at the bulge that was throbbing in his tight shorts. ‘Man…I look kinda…hot.’ He thought to himself, his mind starting to acknowledge his own appearance as his sexuality was awakening. <br />
<br />
“When you feel an intense love or attraction for someone, you might feel your cock get hard. When you rub a hardened cock to the point you hit a sort of ‘climax&#39;, it shoots cum.” Lilianne felt awkward giving Tom the birds and the bees essentially, but she knew he was taking this all in just fine. “When a guy and a girl love each other very much, that white sticky stuff can be used to have kids of your own. If you have sex with them, of course, but I wouldn’t do that with the way you are now.”<br />
<br />
For a moment, Tom seemed confused. “Huh? But why not? Look at me, bro! I can’t help it if the ladies can’t resist me!” He said, not realizing he&#39;s starting to sound more like the cocky athlete he looked like. The teen held his head with his other hand, feeling new memories flooding into his brain. Joining the youth league in middle school, training his body to strengthen it into a figure fit for rushing and leading as a quarterback, finally achieving his goal of being on the JV team when he entered highschool, feeling a developing crush on a few girls in his grade and…Timothy Bruner. As his mind aged, he realized that he and Timothy, or rather Tim as he and the other boys called him, were now the same age. As he grew older, he couldn’t help but admire how well built his fellow sportsman was getting, realizing he not only liked women, but also men too.<br />
<br />
Before, he was just his teacher’s son, but now Ms. Bruner wasn’t his teacher anymore. No, that was a long time ago. He grew up with her son in this new reality being magically built for him, going to the same classes and bonding like best friends. Though, he still thought Tim&#39;s mom was hot, leading to a playful jab in the arm whenever he commented about it like an idiot. He knew he could never really have her…but maybe he could have Tim. Tom felt flushed in between his eyes as what would’ve been thoughts about talking to Tim and holding his hand became naughtier now that he’s a teen. He wanted to get close to Tim&#39;s face, give him a peck on the cheek…maybe even a more intimate kiss on his lips. He didn’t know if Tim felt the same way, but he sure as hell wanted him badly now that puberty’s causing his body to be wracked with hormones and sexual urges.<br />
<br />
Tom was wandering off mentally. He would tease Tim about how much taller he is than him even though it was only a few inches, but he imagined that teasing to lead into him using that extra bit of size to wrap his stronger arms around him from behind in a loving hug…burying his nose into Tim&#39;s neck…smelling the light musky scent because the two of them had just gotten out of football practice…sliding a hand up his belly to feel up his pecs…falling in love with everything about him. He knows now that Tim wasn’t exactly a big hunk like he thought when he was younger, but those feelings carried over into some intense attraction for the boy, morphing into this fixation on him since that was the memory he thought of when he started feeling horny.<br />
<br />
“You’re too young to be a dad, Tommy. Wait until you’re eighteen at least, then you can consider having unprotected sex. For now, enjoy your life. You are the star player of your team, after all. Everyone loves you.” Lilianne smiled as she spoke. “Ungh…the name’s Tom, man.” The young teen groaned a little as he felt his mind reaching the end of it’s updating, now mentally fourteen years old like the rest of him. ‘I should listen to her, but…fuck, I wanna get my dick wet, bro…’ Of course, Tom knew if he were going to, he’d wear a condom. He wasn’t stupid. But the idea of him being a dad did kind of excite him.<br />
<br />
Lilianne could read his mind. He really was a teen now, that much was certain. Not caring if she saw anymore being the horny teen he was now, Tom closed his eyes as he took his free hand and slowly slid it down his abs, reaching down to his crotch to gently grab and grope his bulge. Thoughts of his intimate embrace with Tim evolved into him wanting to grind his cock against him as they stood there, before the scene continued with him pushing Tim with his new strength into the wall to pin him to it, passionately making out and rubbing their bodies together. He wanted him so badly now. These thoughts made him blush deeply, before he suddenly realized what he was doing in front of Lilianne, just registering her hand was no longer on his cheek. He shook his head and sheepishly apologized. “Uhh, I’m sorry, bro! Err, ma&#39;am! I don’t know what came over me just now. God, why are my clothes so small? Nngh, they’re so fucking tight…” <br />
<br />
Tom frantically felt all over himself, tugging at his childish clothes, which were still hugging his chest, his shorts hugging his ass and around his groin where his thighs meet. It was bunched up at his hips, but…why was he wearing this? He could recall being younger than this when he stepped into the spa, but…something about that seemed far away. He wasn’t wearing shoes, but he doubted whatever he walked in with he could fit these big stompers into if this was what he was wearing. Thankfully, he only wore sandals, but his toes would be sticking out of the front, his heels going far past the back of them. Though, as tight and constraining as these were…he kinda liked how it rubbed against him. It made him feel strong, confident about how much he’d grown since he was small enough to wear these comfortably. It made him feel a bit more like a man like his dad. He did look pretty strange, but girls like guys who can work a crop top, right? The thought made him chuckle like an idiot.<br />
<br />
Lilianne reassured him this was fine. “It’s okay, Tommy. Ahh, I’m sorry, Tom, right? It’s a natural response. I’ve seen guys older than you come in here and end up relieving themselves in the sauna. I have Clyde help me with cleaning up the place.” Tom then remembered the guy he met walking in. Yeah, Clyde. Though he didn’t think about it before, he now was very much aware of how hot he looked too. The guy was a perfect piece of muscle…almost too perfect. For a minute, he forgot Lilianne was magic, as if the teen in him that wanted to say it was all bullshit was taking over his old mind that wanted to believe in it. Did she just make him up? Or was he someone she helped make attractive like she did with him and his parents? He had a lot of questions that didn’t have answers, but the jock side of him just wanted to shrug it off. It wasn’t very important…but he was curious.<br />
<br />
Lilianne began to escort the young teen in ill-fitting clothes out to the entrance area of the spa again. She gave him the towel he dropped in the sauna when he changed, the boy putting it over his shoulder. “In any case, thank you for stopping by. As I’ve said, it’s free of charge, but if you’d like to come back for another round, I’d be happy to let you back in.” She turned around and gave Tom a wink. “Maybe you can bring that boy you like with you next time.” Tom got red in the face. How did she know about Tim? ‘Damn, she really is magic, bro…this is freaky as shit…’ He thought.<br />
<br />
Trying to maintain his confidence, Tom just shook it off and smirked. “U-Uhm, yeah, sure. Or…” He walked closer to her. “Maybe I’d like that second round right now.” He did admit, that growing feeling felt good. Incredible, actually. It made him blow his first load. Though, he started feeling like that was far from his first. But on top of that, a part of him…wanted to spend more time with Lilianne. She could tell he was into her, but he’d have to use the sauna again if he wanted any real opportunity for a date. If he really needed to relieve his urges again, she’d be fine laying him down on the table for a feeling up and a handjob. Having grown up so fast, Tom was probably more pent up than that one orgasm could help. But she wasn’t planning on going out with a kid.<br />
<br />
“Hmm, are you sure?” If he went through with it, she’d probably try to rework the water to mentally age him as well, unless he was too eager and really wanted to get in there again. Tom just gave her a dumb grin. “Nah, I’m just messing with you, ma’am.” He chuckled. “Unless…” his grin became a smirk again. “Well, whatever you decide on, I’ll be right here.” Lilianne returned the laugh.<br />
<br />
Tom was now at a crossroads. Whatever choices he had, it was up to him to decide. The young teen began to think it through…</p>
