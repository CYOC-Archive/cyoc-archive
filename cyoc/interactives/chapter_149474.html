<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I&#39;m not sure where to split these up more so people can add separate branches. Perhaps I should have posted this as an actual story haha.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It felt at once familiar and new again. Jennifer was home for the first time since that fateful day in September when she had turned into the most provocative decoration the girls&#39; locker room had ever seen. I was almost just like she had left it, with the replacement of a few minor items such as a chair or TV (her father frequently got new TVs as they released to market, though he rarely had time to make use of them). As she stepped out of the foyer, itself nearly the size of Kyle&#39;s bedroom, she called out to see if anyone was home. &quot;Hello? Mom, Dad?!&quot; There was silence for a moment, then her father appeared, with his usual pajamas and night cap. He looked surprised as Jen ran up and hugged him tightly. &quot;Well, it&#39;s nice to see you too my dear.&quot; &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s nice to see you.&quot; Jen replied with a wistful smile. <i>As far as he knows, I&#39;ve been coming home regularly this whole time.</i> Jen was slightly sad that only she would ever know how much this moment meant to her, but it was necessary to make everyone forget as there was no way she&#39;d be able to make up a satisfactory story to cover such a long absence. <i>It&#39;s a good thing Kyle saved the clothes I had originally worn that day. Not sure why though.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Where have you been, young lady?&quot; her dad asked. Jen was startled at the question for a moment, before she realized what he meant. &quot;I know it was a Friday night, but next time at least shoot a text to either your mother and I or Martha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry dad, I was...at a friend&#39;s house.&quot; Jen blushed as she felt Kyle&#39;s morning wood in her sheath. Her friend was not awake yet, it seemed. At least most of him. &quot;It won&#39;t happen again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See that it doesn&#39;t, we were worried about you. I&#39;ll email her that you&#39;re alright. She almost canceled her trip to the Met Gala you know.&quot; Her father pulled out his phone and walked away. &quot;Martha&#39;s got the day off, but there&#39;s some takeout in the fridge if you don&#39;t want to make something.&quot; <i>Might not be the best time to ask.</i> thought Jen. <i>Besides, I could us a little me-time. Us-time?</i> She decided to go up to her room for a bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Kyle could feel the sun beaming down on his closed eyelids, and he finally decided to get up. All morning long he had been drifting in & out of consciousness, Jennifer&#39;s warm pussy always the first sensation that he noticed. <i>I could really get used to this...</i> Still, he was beginning to feel restless and sensed it was pretty late in the morning, so he flipped his blanket off of him and brought himself to his feet. As he did, he made sure to lift his legs above and around the round bubble sitting on his bed to keep from accidentally kicking her. <i>It&#39;d be funny, but she might be talking to her parents or something. Good thing I had those clothes.</i> Looking back, the shorts and tee that Jen had been wearing the day he&#39;d cursed her were arguably to thank for all of his luck since then. Originally taking them as a trophy to remember his vanquished foe by, the thought had eventually led to consider making an actual sex-toy trophy out of her, and <i>that</i> eventually led to what had just happened yesterday. Perhaps even an end to him and his mother&#39;s troubles eventually, if this joint venture idea of Jennifer&#39;s worked out. He still didn&#39;t know what to think of all of it, but what he thought of <i>her</i> now was undeniably something he&#39;d never considered possible.<br />
<br />
He was horny, but he thought he ought to at least text Jen before he went to town on her. And so a few minutes later he was brushing his teeth while feeling the wet tightness of Jennifer&#39;s vagina wrapped around his cock. And it was getting wetter. Kyle doubted that she was talking to anyone as he felt slight rhythmic contractions around him and her tunnel getting more & more slippery. <i>Actually, if I had to guess I think she&#39;s masturbating right now.</i> He was fairly certain by the time he re-entered his room. Still, he picked up the phone and dialed her number (that she had remembered surprisingly easily and given him last night).<br />
<br />
&quot;...Hello? Kyle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, just letting you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then don&#39;t let <i>me</i> stop you! Do you feel what I&#39;m doing?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it feels like you&#39;re rubbing one out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly, wanna help me out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle didn&#39;t need any further prompting. Picking up his dick, which he suspected would feel strange for a long time to come, he started sliding it in and out of Jennifer, twisting it left & right as he did. &quot;<i>Fuuuck</i>....wait, I know-&quot; Jen hung up for a moment, before getting a facetime message from her. Picking it up, he saw his foe-turned-girlfriend&#39;s flushed face on the other end, holding the phone in both hands. &quot;This is so hot, it&#39;s like watching porn I&#39;m in. How&#39;s that slut&#39;s cunt?&quot; she said, breathing heavily. Playing along, Kyle replied &quot;Fantastic, dirty bitch can&#39;t get enough of this dick.&quot; Moving the lens of the camera, he broadcast a closeup of his dick plowing the depths of her needy pussy. &quot;Let me watch her take it.&quot; Kyle set the phone against a pillow, getting close enough that the entire screen was taken up by Jen&#39;s disembodied abdomen with his face in the background. <br />
<br />
Lying beneath her covers and feeling the broad rod slip in and out of her lips while watching it on her tiny screen, she started really getting into her fantasy. &quot;<i>MMMmm....</i>Pound her cunt whenever you want....don&#39;t call or texttt.....you own it nowww...&quot; Jen felt herself climbing towards a hands-free orgasm, when she heard a knock on the door. Quickly muting the call, she bent her knees up and set the phone on her thighs before saying they could come in. Her dad had come by to tell her his travel itinerary for the next few weeks, and PG-Jennifer Smith nodded along, while Kyle fucked XXX-rated Jen the slut on the other end of the hidden screen. Kyle, meanwhile, was turned on from hearing Jen play the good girl while she got railed, and he was tempted to pick up the pace but also didn&#39;t want to finish yet himself. Ultimately he decided to simply leave his cock in her for now, twisting it back & forth. As Jen felt the intruder inside her slide within her walls, she decided to ask the question she had been thinking of pitching before her father left the country. &quot;Hey dad...I&#39;ve got a business idea. Would you be willing to help fund me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s dad was happy that his daughter was already thinking like the professional she&#39;d soon become, but he also didn&#39;t want to simply hand the money over without hearing her best pitch. &quot;Sure. What are you thinking of?&quot; <i>The last thing you&#39;d think I&#39;d be thinking of right now.</i> Jen thought as she felt her hole expanded to it&#39;s limits. &quot;I can&#39;t quite tell you, I&#39;ve got to be stealth about it for now. Nothing illicit, of course.&quot; Her father felt a bit disappointed. &quot;In most cases, you can&#39;t just ask people for money and tell them &#39;It&#39;s a secret&#39; when they ask what they&#39;re paying for.&quot; Jennifer was thinking quickly, &quot;Just a small seed amount, and I&#39;ll prove I can get at least 3-fold returns from it. Possibly much more.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stared for a second, arms crossed as he considered his options. &quot;I&#39;ll never bring it up again if it fails.&quot; Jen attempted. Meanwhile, Kyle was almost fascinated enough listening into the private conversation that he forgot he was fucking. Almost. Lifting his dick up slightly, he let go and let gravity seat him into Jen&#39;s silky pocket. She began contracting sporadically as she outwardly hid her approaching orgasm right in front of him. &quot;Ten-thousand. I&#39;ll give you ten-thousand to get your project off the ground and that&#39;s <i>it.</i> Consider it an early birthday present.&quot; Her father said. &quot;I&#39;ll have Hugo wire it to you this afternoon.&quot; &quot;Thanks dad! I&#39;ll show you what I turn it into!&quot; Jen said, referring of course to the revenue rather than the product. &quot;I know you will honey.&quot; Her dad walked over to her, with Kyle <i>just</i> out of sight as he patted her head. &quot;I&#39;m off, now. Martha comes back tomorrow but remember the alarms and the gate if you leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen wished her dad a nice trip, remaining quiet until she saw him driving off the property through her window. &quot;<i>AhhhhhhhhhhhHHHH-!</i>&quot; She started to spasm as the dick twitched on her phone, and she felt it spurt cum into her 2nd-self&#39;s waiting womb. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
A month and a half later, during spring break, Kyle and Jen were sitting in a rented car on the side of the road next to a grazing pasture not too far outside of Glendale. Normally this road would be somewhat desolate in feel despite the mild spring weather, but today there were at least 12 cars parked around them. The entire afternoon, there had never been below 5 at any one time as the two 19-year old&#39;s they had hired online (probably looking to make some quick extra cash before college) did the work of selling the goods they had produced. The rules were simple, as Kyle had explained to them (with some coaching over a bluetooth by Jen) during their &quot;orientation&quot; the evening before. They were to simply sell what was inside, at the prices marked, and tell everyone they had no idea who made these, just that they were the same people behind the &quot;magic posters&quot;. Kyle had surreptitiously posted some actual fliers in Glendale a week before, worded cryptically enough that only students who knew understood what was meant, and relied on word of mouth for the rest. Keep a count of what sells, leave it with the money in the van that had also rented, and lock it all up before knocking on the door of the car where Kyle had explained he&#39;d probably be napping. Kyle would then pay them out and call them a ride back to town.<br />
<br />
Before they left, they could, of course, pick out one each of whichever products they wanted as well. Marcy, a somewhat punkish girl in a sweater with a very well-rounded rear, had picked a three-pair package of mini-mouths for herself. Jen had learned how to change her &quot;zoom&quot; and &quot;crop&quot; while 2D much as Kyle had done with her tongue on the index card, but she had taken the concept further. Her lips were reduced to a mere 1-inch long, the perfect size to tightly hug a nipple in a girl&#39;s bra or her clit further down, the instructions suggesting it be laid vertically. Kyle also saw her pick out the extra-large tongue, itself almost as large as a cock, and he had a feeling it wasn&#39;t destined for her pussy. &quot;Are you sure you want to do this? I remember your trick with the mouthwash.&quot; Kyle had asked Jen. &quot;I&#39;m certain. Or at least, I think I am. I&#39;m not bi, but there&#39;s something about having my tongue up another woman&#39;s cooch regardless of that that gets me wet. Probably the same thing that makes me want to commodify myself in the first place.&quot; Besides, she had further explained, she got used to it over time until the parts were merged together again. <i>That&#39;s good, because these won&#39;t be. That merge was a one-time deal the way it was worded.</i> Kyle thought.<br />
<br />
With the decision to release these, Jen would again be forced to suck & lick until these toys wore out and lost their magic, something they had no idea of the timeframe for since these weren&#39;t copied from another medium. <i>Jen might have her tongue up Marcy&#39;s ass until they both graduate from college with proper care. We just don&#39;t know.</i> Of course, this was also a problem from a business viewpoint as well; they didn&#39;t want everyone to simply buy one thing from them and never need to again. Even given that misstep with the wording of the new curse, Jen wasn&#39;t particularly worried, at least not enough to outweigh her kinkiness. She still had the curse, and Kyle could re-curse her to give her products a maximum shelf life.<br />
<br />
The toys that Don, their other more laid-back employee, had chosen did not have quite the same longevity concerns. One of them, that they had nicknamed &quot;The Shutter&quot; was shaped like a normal fleshlight, but twisting the wide end -as if taking the batteries out of a normal flashlight- adjusted a simple telescoping mechanism. The effect of this was to dynamically adjust the width of Jennifer&#39;s hole. Turn it to one side and you got a hole so large you could slip in barely hard, then turn it to the other to get her tighter than a virgin. Jennifer had really enjoyed that one when Kyle had demonstrated, and it looked like she&#39;d get another demonstration, in her back hole this time as Don picked out the anal variant. <i>Probably from seeing Marcy all day</i>, Kyle suspected he knew who Don would be fantasizing about while he fucked Jen&#39;s asshole that night.  He also picked their &quot;concealable cockring&quot;, a small wearable mouth that was on a simple flat disk for portability, as well as the &quot;stick-hers&quot;, a 4-set of (you guessed it) adhesive stickers that you could put on a sex doll, pillow, shower wall, whatever. Jennifer had strove to make them as inanimate-seeming as possible, leaving the entire thing laminated paper except for the hole of her vagina itself, just her nipples as they sat on two paper breast stickers, and her actual sphincter surrounded by a picture of the surrounding skin. <i>Wonder what they&#39;re going on</i>, Kyle pondered.<br />
<br />
The two finished their own shopping and closed up, before walking up and tapping on the tinted glass of the car. &quot;Hey dude, we did what you asked. Thanks for the stuff.&quot; Don said. Kyle rolled the window down with $640 in cash, somewhat in awe of it himself as he tried to act casual while he handed them their pay. <i>$40 an hour and free sex with the attractive CEO, what more could you ask out of a job?</i> Kyle chuckled softly as he handed them the bills. &quot;....You alright?&quot; Marcy asked him, raising her eyebrow &quot;I&#39;m fine, feeling great in fact. My associate said they&#39;re feeling good about today&#39;s sales too.&quot; <i>Not that they&#39;ll ever know who that CEO is.</i> Jen was &quot;sitting&quot; in the car, but she had mainly been lying in Kyle&#39;s room the whole afternoon, advising him through the headset when needed, as well as through his reattached (for now) penis. Kyle was field-testing the first of their wearable line, and so her vagina had been sitting in the car with him the whole time, on his cock. He&#39;d wanted to see how well-aligned her sown-in pussy was with the crotch of the black briefs, and he tested it for leakage by cumming in her cocksheath while sitting, standing, walking around, even lightly jogging up and down the road at one point. It had performed admirably even in that circumstance, and as an extra Jen had performed admirably in his ear.<br />
<br />
He called them a ride. After they had gone off into the night, Kyle gathered the remaining merchandise and the money from the van. There wasn&#39;t much left, and they&#39;d made a good haul. It wouldn&#39;t be long before they&#39;d have the promised 300% return to show Jennifer&#39;s father, though how she would continue to hide the kind of goods they were selling from him was a mystery to Kyle. Locking up the van for now, he got in the car and drove back to his house to grab her so they could drive both vehicles back. As he came upon his house, he could hear a noise. He recognized it before he even walked into the humble dwelling; Jennifer was moaning loudly. One of the few advantages of Kyle&#39;s house was it&#39;s distance from his neighbors. It had originally been a farm property but had gradually became a swamp due to a change in a nearby river. It usually just meant a long walk to and from anywhere, but now it was useful for the privacy it afforded. It was a good thing too, since otherwise someone might be concerned Jen was getting murdered. Her screams sounding like a cross between groans and wailing as he walked to his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;UGGHHHH! OOOHhhhh...&quot;  Jen about looked like she was having a seizure as she thrust her naked hips in the air futilely while lying on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we sold 452 out of our 500 stock, had a good run today.&quot; Kyle said smiling. Watching Jen incapacitated by orgasms in front of him, he couldn&#39;t help but get hard as he expanded to fit her contracting tube.<br />
<br />
&quot;HAAA! AAH! Kyle...is that you...? uuuOOH!&quot; Jennifer&#39;s irises returned to her face a moment to look at him, before rolling back into her lids.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m thinking you might not be capable of driving, huh?&quot; Kyle moved his hand down to his pants and casually started having Jen ride him too.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not...capable (UH!) of doing....(Aaaaa!) much but (errr!) getting fucked right now...&quot; Jen brought her knees together and grabbed her thighs, but it made no difference as she felt her pussy alone relentlessly take dick in at <i>least</i> 10 separate places, including right in front of her. Kyle came over and kissed her, muffling her vocalizations.<br />
<br />
&quot;MMmmmmmmmmm-! MMMM!&quot; Jen squirmed in his embrace as she helplessly came again. Kyle broke off the kiss to push at Jen. She went into the bed up to right above her mouth, the sound cutting off instantly. The only noise coming from the room now was the heavy breathing coming out of her nose, as her face continued to silently tell the story of the continuous orgy she was being subjected too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess, we need to use the curse again so that you aren&#39;t cumming 24/7 for the rest of your life?&quot; Kyle had predicted this would happen, but Jennifer apparently had not. <i>Maybe she thought she&#39;d be able to handle it?</i> Kyle wondered. <i>Or maybe she &quot;accidentally&quot; overlooked it.</i><br />
<br />
Moving her mouth off the picture for a second, Jen blurted out a quick &quot;Yeah!&quot; before submerging herself again. &quot;<i>You</i> have the curse Jen, you have to give it to me before I can do anything.&quot; Kyle said. Jen looked at Kyle through her creased brow, before her wide-open eyes trailed down to where his hand was still lazily stroking him in her. She took a minute simply panting at him through her nose as he savored the feeling of her cocksleeve. Finally gathering the strength to speak again, she brought her mouth out long enough to say &quot;Transform or dare!&quot; before moving back.<br />
<br />
Kyle didn&#39;t know what to choose, and Jen was mostly incapable of explaining her plans to him. &quot;Dare&quot; he said finally. Jennifer closed her eyes, inhaled deeply, and burst her whole head and shoulders off the sheets. &quot;I dare you to be able to know where any of my parts are located! Aaaah-!&quot; before submerging herself entirely as her forced moaning started again. Looking in his thoughts, Kyle could now see where all of the products they had sold had ended up; mostly in various homes around Glendale, but two were currently in the local gym, some were in a number of businesses around town -<i>most likely people who bought things before work</i> Kyle thought- and one set of stickers in particular was in the nearby college town, where Jen was most likely installed in a frat house. It had been a smart move on Jen&#39;s part, especially given her current condition. Now Kyle would be able to track her parts down in case they ever needed to.<br />
<br />
Kyle took a moment to think of how to word the transformation he was about to do, as it would be a little more involved. &quot;Transform or dare?&quot; he said finally. Jen didn&#39;t even bother coming out of the bed, remaining a somewhat unflattering but no less erotic picture of her splayed out with her face contorted in pleasure. Kyle waited a little while, then said &quot;For your transformation, your body is now able to take all your sexual energy, and the reactions you would be making due to them, and hold them in in such that you can act normally. The only parts of you that will still respond normally all the time are the muscles of your vagina and anus, which will never cramp or get tired again, as well as your nipples. The rest will only release when <i>you</i> release them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle watched as Jennifer slowly emerged from the bed. &quot;I&#39;m not really any more relaxed, but at least now my body is doing what I want it to do. What the hell Kyle? I thought we were going to cut down on the sensations or something like that, but I&#39;m still...&quot; She guided Kyle&#39;s hands to her actual, original vagina. It was still twitching and contracting nearly every second, a mirror to the identical squeezing on his cock, and an indicator to what Jennifer was still feeling underneath her straight face. &quot;Not a chance!&quot; Kyle gave her a downright evil smile, and Jen began looking a little fearful. &quot;For your dare, I dare you to only release when my dick is in your original vagina.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer could hardly believe it as she realized the implications. She would not only be able to act normally in public, she would be <i>forced</i> to, unable to let out even a single moan or twitch as, inside her, she came again and again as the pent-up sensations were absorbed and trapped beneath her normal facade. The only outlet were her two tunnels and her now permanently-hard nubs, and they would remain so until Kyle made love to her actual body, not just the fully-feeling copy of her pussy that he was now wearing. &quot;Kyle, that&#39;s so fucking evil...&quot; Jen looked upset, but it was easy to see through as he felt her juices flood the cavern he was wearing, that was also beginning to milk him in a drawn-out manner as Jennifer had a huge orgasm, itself also hidden behind her pleading expression. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let&#39;s go, we still have to go grab the van!&quot; Kyle took her by the hand, walking out to the car. &quot;Wait, Kyle! I need you to-&quot; Jen looked at him, her eyes practically begging him to fuck her original body so she could have some relief. &quot;Later, it&#39;s almost 10 o&#39;clock! We don&#39;t want to just leave it on the side of the road, right?&quot; He was rewarded by Jennifer&#39;s hole milking him in an exaggerated fashion again, as tears began to form in her eyes from the tension and frustration of not being able to release her orgasm. <i>She must be cumming so hard right now</i> Kyle thought with barely-repressed glee himself. Jen&#39;s cocksocket was almost sucking him in with the strength of her contractions as he turned the ignition.<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Issac walked into his room after eating dinner and went over to his backpack. The recently-graduated bachelor had gone out to browse some very special items today, and had ended up purchasing the most expensive one. It was also the most limited, the mysterious sellers having only produced five so far, and buying the last one had set him back $200. Still, if it was anything like those free samples that had somehow been handed out in the middle of school that one day, it was worth every penny, especially since this was supposed to last a lot longer. Called &quot;The Wedge&quot;, it looked almost like a badly-designed stapler; an oval half-cone that started out small at one end before terminating in about 5 inches (less than the length of most cocks, which was another part that confused Issac) with a 2-inch wide face. And in that face lay a pussy that he could <i>swear</i> felt like a real one, that even self-lubricated. He had no idea how it was possible, and to be honest he really didn&#39;t care. What he did care about were the two buttons on top. One made the entire thing vibrate, and while it was unfortunately a bit loud, he could scarcely imagine how pleasurable such a realistic vagina would feel with it. The other button was even more impressive; when pressed, an internal piston moved the vagina forward & back, making the item hands-free.<br />
<br />
The final thing that appealed to him was where the item was meant to be placed. Taking it out of the packaging, he carried it over to his computer chair. He thought about using the adhesive strips that were packaged alongside, but thought that he might want to readjust it later. Retrieving some duct tape from his garage, he took a strip and taped the wedge to the seat, right between where his thighs would rest on the chair. He sat on the chair and adjusted the height of the toy&#39;s hole with the help of a dial seated on the side of the product. <i>Perfect. Now let&#39;s give this a whirl...</i><br />
<br />
Already aroused enough to be at full-mast, Issac inserted himself in the device and opened his browser. What felt like a vibrating dick was added to the lengthening list of sensations Jen felt, along with her tongue being held in the sphincter of a woman texting her friend about her unique temp gig, and her ass feeling gaped to the maximum. It was at the point where her anus couldn&#39;t close one iota, fully stretched out by what felt like an arm up her backside. Don had fallen asleep with his penis still penetrating her sphincter, having set the shutter to almost maximum shrinkage, the ring around him not even able to clench from how wide it was opened.<br />

Driving the car back to Kyle&#39;s while he drove the van, Jennifer thought about what the future held for her. Thanks to the curse, her driving wasn&#39;t impaired as her body and mind responded normally to her inputs. But also thanks to the curse, she now couldn&#39;t fully finish an orgasm, the tension feeling like she was carrying within a lake a mile wide, leaking out only through two holes between her legs. Her empty original pussy squirted in the middle of a right turn, and she realized she&#39;d have to start wearing tampons all the time just to soak up all the cum she was producing under her everyday behavior. She didn&#39;t smell anything though, and guessed that the curse had interpreted &quot;acting normally&quot; to mean not reeking of sex all the time.<br />
<br />
Truly the curse had given her everything she had wanted as well as everything she feared. Jennifer could now behave like the proper Smith family heiress that she wanted to be out in public, in fact she could never <i>not</i> act that way and release her horniness in full. Her arousal would forever be caged inside unless Kyle decided to place his key into her true lock. Even now, as she felt herself impaled on him through one of her duplicated ones. She tried making herself vocalize in the car, but it felt like she was just acting despite the very real pleasure she felt, and it did nothing to quench the burning flame within her. <i>I hope he fucks me, the actual me, when we get back...</i> she thought with more than a hint of apprehension as to how much power he now had over her.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Kyle was having an internal debate as he drove the van in front of her; Should he let Jen release monthly, or go straight to semi-annually? He wanted to give her her fantasies to their absolute limits, and he looked forward to how much pleasure both of them would have as a result. The thought kept him hard within the woman he loved all the way home.</p>
