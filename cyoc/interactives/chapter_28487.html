<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunrays struck the face of Tabitha as the morning approached. The room glowed faintly with the promise of a new day. Tabitha's room lay in clutter, with various clothes stranded about, including some of her new wear (Tabitha went on a dressing spree before heading to bed. She thought it uncharacteristic of her, yet strangely satisfying). Tabitha stirred as the light covered her eyes. She sat up deliberately, giving to a wide-stretched yawn. Her tail twitched about in a drowsy daze. Looked to be a good day, Tabitha thought.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up a discarded ensemble on the floor she wore the night before and set it on her table. Taking off her nightgown, she stood naked (save her panties) in front of her mirror, giving her image a once-over. This way, this body is how she would stay, she thought. It wasn't such a bad thing, she mused, turning around to view her backside. She bent over to the mirror and stared herself straight in the face. Nothing wrong with it, she agreed to herself, just different.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took her bra and slipped it over her arms deftly, struggling only somewhat with the clasp in the back. She slipped her maroon tanktop over her frame and adjusted the front so the logo showed correctly. She brought her legs through the loose-fit jeans and clasped it tightly around her waist. Almost without a second thought, she took the collar from yesterday and snapped it around her neck. She gave a last look over herself in the mirror. It was comfortable, and if she were still a boy (and the shirt had sleeves) it might have been something she would have worn before. Tabitha picked up her back pack and made way to the kitchen for some breakfast.<br>
***<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tabitha met up with Klondike on the way to school. When Jasmine was nowhere to be found, Tabitha worried.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She's getting a ride to school. She didn't look entirely well when she passed me. The offered me a ride, but I kept walking so you wouldn't feel lonely on the way to school." Klondike seemed her cheery self from yesterday as she rattled off each answer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon they approached the school they attended: Williams Middle School. Tabitha was a bit cautious; today would be her first day as a girl here, never mind the fact that she was part cat as well. What would the others think? She stood out way too much.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Di, apparently, wasn't thinking the same line. "C'mon!" Di exclaimed, and grabbed Tabitha by the arm, pulling her along to the front door.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside, the hall traffic was horrible as usual. No one seemed to pay too much notice to the fact that two catgirls just walked into the school building. At least, no one paid attention as they stood in the doorway. Joining the traffic flow, Tabitha noticed a few cursory glances at her. Her head was above the brigade of backpacks, seeing as her advanced height pushed her there, but also her ears were the kicker in this akward attraction. Occasionally people standing along the walls opening their lockers would take a long look as Tabby made her way across the hall, and every boy lucky enough to get close to her stopped dead at whatever he was doing just to get a view of her developed figure much unfitting for an 8th grader. It proved a hassle for those that noticed right in front of her. Today wouldn't be a good day, so it seemed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up ahead, a familiar someone was leaning against a wall, away from the traffic. Jasmine stood, clad in her usual wear, with her tail wrapped around her leg and a uncomfortable stare towards anyone who dared envy her form. Tabitha rushed up to meet her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmph," was all Jasmine said when Tabitha approached.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Um, hey Jazz. Feeling any better?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jeff."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jeff?" It appears Jasmine was back to herself, Tabitha thought.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This day will suck. I can't go through with this. I tried to stay home, but mom called my bluff. Now I'm stuck here, and I'll have to hear everyone call me Jazz. I'm not Jazz, you know!" Jasmine seemed on a roll today.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tabitha wasn't amused, and tried to console Jasmine. "Jeff, be reasonable. You're a girl now. If you don't cope with it, you'll just end up stressing out over nothing. You can't live like you used to in this way, you'll need to adj... are you not wearing a bra?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine's nipples were sticking straight through her shirt. She looked down, then hurriedly crossed her arms with a hint of embarrassment. "No..." she meekly replied.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at you, you're still wearing your old clothes! Why didn't you wear any of the clothes your mom got you."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was too girly," Jasmine replied.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a girl!" Tabitha snapped back, then calmed herself down. "Look, it's not as if the world had ended. You can still have fun and be a girl too, but if you hold back because you think it's all over for you, then you'll just be unhappy throughout the whole day! Think about it. You might be a dunderhead (Jeff wasn't exactly the most reasonable of the trio), but even you would agree that what you're doing isn't smart."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine held a look of repressed laughter from the usual insult, instead forcing her usual anger above it. Then she pondered, opened her mouth to reply, closed it, thought some more again, and decided to back off for now. "Fine, you win," Jasmine conceded. "I'll act like some prissy little girl if it makes you so happy."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to suck it up, but just don't the whole thing get to you, you know?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, yeah," Jasmine droned back. "It's not easy for me, you know?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Tabitha agreed, and with that, Jasmine left, looking a little more complacent than before.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Di caught up with Tabitha, looking giddy as usual. "I got myself a fan club now," she chirped.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tabitha gave a chuckle back. Di adjusted quickly to her predicament, if not accepted it all too wholly. Tabitha herself leveled off, almost balanced. Jazz wasn't adjusting well at all, but she was on her way. In a way, it seemed like things would eventually return to normalcy, or as close as it would get now. Eventually the bell rang, and everyone proceeded to file into the classrooms. Tabitha still got an odd look every now and then, and someone even stopped her before she got into class, asking her to join the newly formed Williams Catgirls fanclub. Inside, Tabitha knew that everything would be alright.<br>
-----<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the writer speaks!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry for all the inconsistencies earlier with my chapters going up against the base chapters for Timmy's transformation. I didn't get a clear image of what exactly Timmy looked like, causing inconsistencies in dress and something of freakish proportions for poor Jeff. Also, if my dialogue seems monotonous, or maybe even reality doesn't seem concrete, I kinda suck at writing those things without a lot of time devoted behind them. I'll get better in the future, I promise!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The story isn't over just yet either. There's still plenty more to go on for another chapter, as not just physical transformations are going on here, but intellectual transformations as well. Who knows, maybe even Todd might come back to twist the lives of the girls some time in the future. The story never ends when you Choose Your Own Change!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus, the author disappears from view yet again, narrowly avoiding the myriad of assaults in response to the horrible pun presented in the last sentence.<br></p>
