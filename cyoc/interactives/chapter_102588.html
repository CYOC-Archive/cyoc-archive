<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shelly walks out as the smoke cleared after the door of the exit chamber opened. The foggy condensed moisture was an unexpected side effect of the process, you should really need to work on that, while Shelly thought as she exited the chamber. thinking back as she remembered what had happened that She began to look over her body.<br />
patting yourself to make sure everything was all there and still normal that With a sigh, she saw that she was entirely the same. Her device was a success! She had successfully transported a living organism! She began to dance around with glee when Suddenly, the little rabbit scampered out of the exit chamber.<br />
Shelly looked at the rabbit angrily and tried to catch it, losing one of her high heeled shoes in the process. &quot;come here You little bastard, You almost got us killed!&quot; said Shelly as She stumbled unevenly, and pulled her other shoe off and threw it across the room at the door as the bunny scampered into a hole in the box as you shouted &quot;i hope you weren&#39;t scared, but You deserve it, and much worse.&quot;<br />
&quot;You certainly have been the first animal to teleport with me you little fuzzball!&quot; Shelly made a mental note to remove the rabbit from her experiment log as It didn&#39;t deserve to be remembered in the history books for scaring you. She sat down at her desk and began to make notes in her lab notebook, occasionally scanning the computer logs to see exactly what it had done to make this attempt a success and was arduous work, while Shelly worked all through the night.<br />
Shelly was to focused on the work, that she failed to notice the small changes in her body to start. Her nails clicked loudly as she tapped them thoughtfully on her desk, and The noise gradually became louder as her nail sharpened into claws as her palms were thickened by soft pink pads. her shoes were off that she didn&#39;t notice her feet stretched into long paws, her big toes were receding into a dew claws while She absentmindedly scratched her chest and legs as soft white fur gradually sprouted across her body.<br />
a few thin fibers at first slowly grew into a thick fur coat that She was getting annoyed when her pencil fell from behind her ear as it grew larger and longer, But she still didn&#39;t notice anything was wrong. Even the pinching feeling in her lower back that developed as a soft fluffy little tail slowly poked out of her spine did nothing more than annoy her while she tried to concentrate on her work. reaching to itch her rear as she touched it was then it finally alerted her to the problem.<br />
Shelly&#39;s body continued to slowly shrink as she found herself constantly moving forward in her chair to maintain the same position so she could work on her notebook when Her last movement had shifted her and she sat down with a yelp. she screamed in pain, and her body was hurting her so mush that She hopped off the chair to see what she was becoming. She turned and saw a small tail behind her. <br />
&quot;What the hell is this?&quot; Still thinking she had sat on something weird that it was just stuck to her butt, she gave it a had tug trying to remove it, but only She yelped again, as the tail remained painfully attached. &quot;What is this thing, It looks just like ....&quot;<br />
Shelly paled raced as she realized what it was - a rabbit&#39;s tail! She looked at her hands and feet in fear. Her heart continue to race rapidly as She felt the fur covering her skin while She felt her huge yet long ears.<br />
no, Not my face, please God, not my face, Shelly thought as She reached up to touched her face. It was covered in fur, but felt almost the same. She opened her mouth and felt her teeth as Her incisors were very long that She could almost feel them stretching beneath her fingers, and Her nose twitched when she reached to touch it while she felt long thin whiskers extending though her fingers.<br />
<br />
oh God, I have to stop this somehow, Shelly thought as She looked back at the computer on her desk. Her chair now seemed much taller that She was less than five feet tall! Her clothes hung loosely on her body, while beginning to bunch up around her as The chair seemed to rise above her that she began to shrink more rapidly, her changes accelerated by her racing heart and fear.<br />
She struggled to climb into the chair when she her jaw was suddenly racked by a tremendous pain that She closed her eyes and bent down to the ground as her jaw stretched into a snout. when the pain ended, Her transformation was over. She looked around and found out, she was swimming in her clothes as She struggled to find her way out and wriggle free of her clothes.<br />
<br />
getting Outside of her clothes while being nude, she assessed the extent of her changes. She was just 3 feet tall and She was covered in white fur from head to toe that she even had the head of a bunny. Her hands and feet looked liked paws, but she found out they still had the manual dexterity of human hands.<br />
Thankfully, she could still write and hold objects, but they would have to be very small, even though her body was very small and covered in fur, but it still had a humanoid shape. She had kept her hourglass figure and her breasts were still in the right place, although covered by fur. In short, she looked like a tiny hybrid of human and rabbit - an anthromorphic rabbit!<br />
<br />
Shelly looked up at her computer and had to figure out a way to get up there and try to reverse this! Suddenly, the doorknob to her lab rattled when you hear Someone was trying to get in. She looked at the clock and saw it was morning that It was probably time for the janitor to clean her lab.<br />
She couldn&#39;t let him see her like this. even If he didn&#39;t kill her, she would be the laughingstock of the Institute if anyone found out while They were already looking for an excuse to take her project away. She would probably just end up in someone else&#39;s lab as their own personal lab pet as She hopped around the lab, looking for some place to hide.<br />
&quot;psst, Hey! Over here!&quot; Shelly ran towards the voice, and was surprised to find another hybrid exactly like her.<br />
She was confused at first, but then suddenly realized that this was the rabbit that had ridden with her during the teleportation trip. It must have been changed by the process as well. &quot;Quick, you can hide in here with me.<br />
 That evil scientist must have changed you, too. We have to hide before that horrible woman comes back, &quot; said the rabbit while Shelly looked at the bunny in shock that It didn&#39;t recognize her as a former human. she decided that was probably a good thing.<br />
She had tried to scare it, after all that Shelly briefly considered her options. She could pretend to be a rabbit and hide with her new companion, But if it would ever found out the truth, things could go bad  to worse quickly. Then again, if she revealed herself, maybe she could have the rabbit into helping her, But why did she need a rabbit&#39;s help anyway?<br />
The rabbit could talk, so she probably could, too. She could just tell her visitor what happened, and they would probably help her. Hopefully, they won&#39;t kill her on sight, or even turn her over to the other scientists for experimentations as The rabbit looked at Shelly, thumping it&#39;s foot to await her decision.</p>
