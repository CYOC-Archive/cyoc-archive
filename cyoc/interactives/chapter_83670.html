++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Juan had no idea why he didn&#39;t just throw the jar away once they left the warehouse. He had even less of an idea as to why Manual didn&#39;t either. To him, getting a jar of the cream, which he was certain he&#39;d never need or use, was just another slap in the face. A bonus was supposed to be a reward, and a cream designed to cure and prevent STDs was not a bonus. The only thing that Juan figured as the reason for why Manual hadn&#39;t thrown his away was his eternal optimism. He always seemed to see either the good in something or people, or saw where good luck could come. Juan could only figure he didn&#39;t throw his away because it would be impolite and would make an obvious mess that if their boss somehow saw them, could get them fired.<br />
<br />
&quot;The instructions for this are pretty X rated,&quot; Manual commented after a few moments as they went along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Juan asked as he looked over to see that Manual had opened the box and had pulled a small pamphlet out from inside it. He hadn&#39;t opened the jar.<br />
<br />
&quot;The instructions are X rated,&quot; Manual repeated, &quot;Listen... Step One: remove all clothing. Step Two: Open jar and take copious amounts of the cream in bare hands. Step Three: Rub vigorously onto penis or vaginal area until cream dries... see, X rated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s supposed to be a cure or vaccine for STDs,&quot; Juan answered, &quot;Where do you expect people to rub it? On their face?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... no... but if it&#39;s a cream that&#39;s absorbed through the skin, wouldn&#39;t any skin do?&quot; Manual wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Juan shrugged, &quot;why are you so interested in that stuff anyway? It isn&#39;t a bonus as it won&#39;t help us at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never say never,&quot; Manual answered, &quot;we may get lucky one of these days. And with this, we wouldn&#39;t have to worry about STDs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not knowing that what was in the jar was an STD of a different type, Juan only shrugged. It really wasn&#39;t worth his time to argue with his brother about the cream. He didn&#39;t like it, but his brother was all he really had. They walked quietly on until they came to a trailer park in the poor part of the town, and on top of it, it was a trailer where they payed rent just to live in it. But, Manual always told him they were dry and safe and that things could be worse. Juan generally accepted that. Placing the instruction pamphlet back in the box, Manual unlocked the door and then opened it. As they went inside, Manual stepped on something the crackled as he did so. Doing this made him stop and then look down. He found on the floor an envelope that had been passed through their door&#39;s small letter slot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... we got some mail!&quot; Manual said in an almost excited voice and setting the box of cream down on the floor to pick the letter up.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s probably a bill,&quot; Juan answered with a grumble as he went around his brother and toward the kitchen. He figured he&#39;d dump his bonus down the sink and be rid of it and no one would see. What Manual did with his bonus was his own business.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it could be a love letter, since it&#39;s addressed to you,&quot; came Manual&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
Juan set his box of Chakat Industries product down on a counter and turned to see his brother approach with the letter. He soon saw that it was indeed a personal letter, but what surprised him the most was who&#39;s name was on the return address.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got a love letter from Maria,&quot; Manual said with a smile in a slightly teasing voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very funny,&quot; Juan sighed back, too surprised to say anything more as Manual handed him the letter. He honestly hadn&#39;t expected to hear or see anything of Maria again after high school. She was, after all, successful and he wasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
He then took the letter and carefully opened the envelope and largely forgot about his brother for the moment. He heard the bathroom door open and close, but that was about all he noticed... especially as he began to read the letter.<br />
<br />
It read: &quot;Dear Juan,<br />
<br />
You probably don&#39;t remember me... at least not very well, but I have remembered you fairly well. I remember when one day in high school a bunch of bullies decided to toss my books about the hall and you took them all on. Of course, it got you detention and I was never able to thank you, but still... you were quite noble that day and fairly cute...<br />
<br />
I hope you&#39;re doing well as you read this and are looking forward to a reunion. Yes, a REUNION. I&#39;ve got a few days off, since the Chakat outbreak in Fee City has quieted down, and I&#39;ll tell you more when I get there, but I wanted to come back and talk with someone from high school again. I know it may seem odd to you, given your circumstances, at least based on what your mother told me over the phone when I was trying to get a hold of you, and on some level it is odd for me... but most of my friends have moved on and I haven&#39;t heard from them in any meaningful way. I tried calling one, and got some irritated woman who was wrestling with three kids, a divorce, and pushy boss. <br />
<br />
You&#39;re essentially the only one left that I would call a friend and meet with and talk about old times. Maybe, if you&#39;re still cute we can talk about some new times too. You wouldn&#39;t believe how lonely being in the FBI can be. I&#39;ll see you in a day or two.<br />
<br />
Sincerely, Maria.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juan stumbled back a bit, feeling suddenly lucky and said, &quot;She likes me.&quot; He didn&#39;t notice, however, the date of Maria&#39;s letter or the sounds coming from the bathroom.</p>
