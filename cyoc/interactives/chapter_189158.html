<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mark watched Aidan standing there, frozen in place by him, silently watching him, he thought about what to do with this power he had over him. Not only him, he corrected himself, but for now it was just Aidan.<br />
Aidan could do nothing but watch Mark sitting there, thinking about what he could do to him. It wasn´t good, that he was sure of. Mark could do whatever he wanted to him, and he couldn´t do anything to stop him. He was totally helpless.<br />
Mark suddenly had a picture before his eyes, something he had seen in movies. While he could easily make Aidan into anything with words right now, how about making him into something he himself had trained him to be? Mark let an evil grin spread onto his face, thanks to a somewhat sadistic streak he had.<br />
“Okay, Aidan, get naked, I need to see what we have here.” Mark said.<br />
Aidan hadn´t liked the grin on Mark´s face, it radiated something bad for himself. Without any control, his body reacted to Mark´s command, quickly stripping of his sock, his jeans and his underwear, all falling on top of his discarded shirt. Aidan turned bright red when Mark looked at his still small cock and balls.<br />
Mark laughed when he saw Aidan turning as red as a tomato. “Don´t need to be shy, Aidan. But it is rather small down there, so was that always the case or have you made a mistake?”<br />
Aidan felt somewhat compelled to answer honestly: “I made a mistake before you arrived. I wanted it bigger, but hadn´t seen the measure unit until I hit save. And it said I needed to wait before I could change it again.” As he wanted to plead with Mark next, he suddenly couldn´t talk anymore, just like before. Mark had only allowed him to answer, not to speak in general.<br />
Mark grinned at him. “Hmmm… Okay, thanks for the warning if I ever want to change that myself. But as far as to your gear down there. Aidan, your cock will grow bigger, until it is at least a half longer than it was originally. The same goes for your balls.”<br />
Even if no sound left Aidan as his gear started to swell bigger, Mark could see in his eyes how he was moaning like crazy. Aidan felt like he could orgasm right on the spot, so good the feeling was of the swelling. Right now, he felt as if he would hug Mark if he could, so thankful was he. It overrode his fear that Mark could literally do anything to him.<br />
Seeing as the cock reached a good size even flaccid, Mark nodded satisfied. “That will work better. Now, as I need a bit of time to think what exactly I will need for you, I want you to start masturbating you cock to grow fully erect. But, regardless how long you will work on it, you won´t be able to cum until I allow it.” Then Mark grinned as Aidan started to work. His eyes, which had shown horror to both being made to masturbate in front of Mark as well as being unable to cum without his permission, slowly become filled with need to release, making it harder to concentrate on anything Mark said.<br />
Mark, seeing that Aidan was nearly blowing his mind away, decided what he needed to do next. Aidan would need the gear he imagined for him, and he wanted it to be made out of Aidan´s clothes. Maybe add another object or two if he needed them. Starting with his idea, Mark got up and collected Aidan´s shoes from behind him, then collected his clothes from beside his still jerking off form before returning to the laptop, laying the clothes beside it. Then he went into Aidan´s bedroom, and quickly found what he was looking for, making him grin.<br />
The small part of Aidan still able to recognize what Mark collected was confused as to why Mark needed his clothes. As he recognized what Mark had collected in his bedroom, he would turn red again if he hadn´t been already.<br />
Mark dropped the cum-stained pair of socks he had found under Aidan´s mattress next to the other clothes, grinning at Aidan. “Some secret stash of them, have you Aidan?” he laughed at him, not expecting an answer. For one, Aidan was still silenced, and for another, he was far too distracted by his need to release. Not that that would happen anytime soon.<br />
Mark lifted one of the cum-stained socks, a left one, and said: “I want this sock to become a golden cock-ring, the fitting size to the base of your cock. It will force you to keep erect until release, even if you don´t do anything, and it is able to vibrate on my command. It can also become tighter if I say so, or keep you from growing erect when I don´t allow it to you.”<br />
Before their eyes, the sock compressed into its upper end. The tip had split open, leaving a ring-shaped cloth behind. Said cloth than hardened while its color changed from dirty white to golden, forming a ring, which soon shrunk a bit, until it would snugly fit around the base of Aidan´s cock. <br />
Mark then lifted the other cum-stained sock, grinning. “This sock will turn into a butt-plug, with a fitting, hollow dildo for the inside and a ring-shaped opening on the outside. It will also be able to vibrate on my command like the ring, and can grow bigger inside of you if I want it too.”<br />
The sock, hanging limply from Mark´s hand, hardened into hollow shell, deforming to look like a dildo. On the end that Mark held, the upper edge, it formed a metal-ring, keeping the hollow dildo open.<br />
When both objects laid in Mark´s hands, he stood up again and walked towards Aidan, who´s eyes widened a bit in fear, even his needy mind could see what will happen now. “Hands aside, Aidan. Show me your cock.” Aidan let his hands drop to his sides, not able to protest. Mark slowly stroked along the cock’s full length, making Aidan moan inside his head, still unable to do so verbally. Mark then slipped the golden cock-ring down the full length, placing it on the very base of Aidan´s cock. With a light flick, it shrunk a millimeter or two, hindering it from slipping down again, but not squishing Aidan´s cock.<br />
Next, Mark took the dildo-shaped butt-plug and shoved it inside Aidan´s ass, making him mentally scream in a mix between need and pain. It was secured in place by the ring on its base, which expanded a bit, pressing it into Aidan´s walls tightly, but not uncomfortable.<br />
“Good, Fitting like a glove in there. Now let´s see what´s next.” Mark said as he returned to the laptop, sitting down again. Looking into Aidan´s still needy eyes, Mark laughed before he continued with the next parts.<br />
Aidan´s body and mind was in a turmoil. There was fear for what Mark would do next, lingering pain from the plug inside his ass, as well as the need for release. He wasn´t sure if, if he could right now, he would ask Mark to be allowed to cum, or if he would curse him for the plug.<br />
“Now, next I want for the socks here on the desk to become golden bracers, fitting your underarms, while the shoes will change into similar bracers for your shanks. Each of the four, while able to open if I want them to, but if not, they will seamlessly enclose your arms and legs. I will also be able to let them de- or increase weight, temperature and tightness when I want them to.” Mark explained his next desired objects.<br />
Aidan´s eyes widened a bit, trying to understand what exactly Mark wanted to accomplish with that, but he couldn´t think clear enough for that. While they watched, Aidan´s former worn socks and the shoes Mark had gotten from the corner turned into pipes made of either cloth or leather, before they hardened into the desired golden metal. They extended to a fitting size and length to enclose both of Aidan´s fore-arms and shanks completely, still laying next to Mark on the desk.<br />
Mark lifted the heavy, golden bracers up, starting with the ones for Aidan´s shanks. Mark had no problem to open them, placing them on either leg and close them there. Aidan felt the sudden weight around his legs, fearing he wouldn´t be able to move around anymore. That only increased, when Mark placed the other pair around his fore-arms. Aidan was sure he would fall to all fours if he could move right now, most likely breaking his hands with the weight that they needed to hold.<br />
Seeing the stain of pain in Aidan´s eyes, Mark guessed what was the reason for that quickly. But even with his sadistic streak he didn´t want to punish Aidan right now. “The bracers will weight only half of what they weight now.” It seemed to work, as Aidan´s eyes showed a bit of relieve at that.<br />
Next, after Mark sat down again, he lifted the shirt and the jeans from the desk. “This shirt and jeans will merge into one part of clothing. It will be a short loincloth, nearly resembling a skirt, hiding away your cock and balls, while the back will be skin-tight. The belt inside the jeans will become a golden metallic belt to keep it in position. It can be clipped in place by me, and get tighter if I want it too.”<br />
They watched as the shirt vanished inside the jeans, softening the material while keeping it straight. The jeans-legs were sucked mostly inside, leaving it look like a short skirt, as there was no longer anything holding front and back together on the lower half. The belt had by now also become a small, golden band, encircling the skirt-like loincloth.<br />
Mark grinned as he placed the belt around Aidan´s waist, closing it above his ass. As Mark stepped back, it was clear that the loincloth did as he request, as it tightly hugged Aidan´s ass. On the contrary, the front was hanging a bit away from Aidan´s waistline. If Mark hadn´t known beforehand that Aidan was erect underneath, you could think he wasn´t.<br />
Mark now lifted the last cloth from the desk, being Aidan´s underwear. “So, for now the last part of clothing you will get. This underwear will form into a collar, similar in form to the bracers, as well in it´s function. It will be long enough to reach from your chin down to your shoulders, fitting it tightly. As an addition, it can also silence you, if I want it to.”<br />
Like before, the lifted cloth changed form, turning from underwear with three openings into a pipe-like shape. It also gained a golden tint as it turned metallic. What made a difference to the bracers, however, was that it turned wider on both ends, covering more of Aidan´s skin.<br />
Aidan didn´t like it when Mark pressed the collar around his neck, where after it closed, it was tightly pressing down onto it. It was already lighter than it looked, but it was still heavy. And still, Aidan had no real idea what Mark was intending to do with him right now.<br />
Mark smiled at the finished outfit he had created for Aidan. He added a few punishment and reward options for Aidan´s new gear. He could still adjust each part individually, but a few programmed code-words would make it easier and faster. Also, he made sure Aidan wouldn´t be harmed by the gear in any way. It wouldn´t do if Aidan was harmed in a way it would hinder his training or later, his service. Only, Mark made sure Aidan wouldn´t notice this. What would it help for Aidan´s training if he knows Mark wouldn´t really harm him? He was sure he could train Aidan well like this, and if not, he could still add something when needed. <br />
He then decided on explaining to Aidan what he wanted now. “Now, as you still look somewhat confused beneath all that neediness you have right now, let me explain. All you got now as gear is to be able to train you. I plan to make you my obedient servant. It can be both rewarding and punishing for you. You will be able to speak again. What do you think?”<br />
Aidan, still needy, was able to answer Mark to that between moans. “I *moan* won´t be *moan* your slave *moan* Mark.”<br />
Mark laughed at that. “I wouldn´t have thought you would be willingly, that´s why I need to train you. You will learn to obey me, or suffer. But as a present to you, you are allowed to cum now.”<br />
As if a dam had broken, Aidan moaned loud as he started to cum, coating the inside of his new loincloth-skirt in his cum, making it drip down slowly. He couldn´t stop the flow for half a minute, and felt rather drained after he was finished shooting.<br />
Mark smirked as he walked over, careful to not step inside the cum puddle dripping from the cloth around Aidan´s bare feet. Then, mocking Aidan even more, he petted him on his head like you would do with a dog. “Now, as to finish this up. Aidan, you are unable to use the chronivac, and can´t tell anyone about it. You will be able to move again, but your new gear will react whenever I want it to. Remember this.”<br />
With a sigh of relieve, Aidan dropped forward, breaking his fall with his arms. With that powerful orgasm and the heavy bracers, he didn´t felt like moving right now. He couldn´t even muster the energy to react to Mark making him unable to use the chronivac, even as he wanted to.<br />
Mark went back to the laptop and deleted the “Mark rules” comment out of the text input. He wanted to train Aidan, not force him to with the chronivac. Not that Aidan would have too much choice. He also, just to make sure it was safe, created a password for both his own profile as well as Aidan´s. Not that Aidan found a way out.</p>
