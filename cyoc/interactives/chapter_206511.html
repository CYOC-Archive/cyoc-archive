<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Van downed the last of his pint of beer and slammed the glass on the table with a bit more force than necessary, making his two friends Greg and Paul look over at him. &quot;Damn, dude, slow down. I don&#39;t want to have to drag your ass into your apartment again.&quot; Greg muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or puking in my car.&quot; Said the much more sober Paul. They took turns being the designated driver and this time was Paul&#39;s go, meaning after his first beer he was now on soda. Well, technically it was supposed to be Van&#39;s turn, but he swapped with Paul on account of him claiming he needed a drink after his latest break up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, order me another if the waitress comes by, I&#39;m going to go drain the snake.&quot; Van slipped out of his chair and stumble-walked to the men&#39;s room. Idly he thought he might want to slow down a bit, but he dismissed that idea quickly. It was Friday night and he was going to get blitzed. A light slap to his own cheeks woke him up enough as he made his way to one of the urinals and undid his fly, pulling out his little man and a sighed as he let his bladder begin to empty. He could already tell this was going to be a racehorse piss.<br />
<br />
He heard the door to the bathroom swing open and closed and another guy wandered up to the urinal next to him. Van felt a momentary flash of annoyance. There were at least three other open ones and this guy had to pick the one right next to him. He opened his mouth to say something, then thought better of it as he got a good look at the guy. He was shorter than Van, standing maybe only five foot six, but he was built like he lived at the gym, thick armed, broad chested, and did not skip leg day. His hair was a bright coppery red, cut short and matched his short but scruffy beard, as well as the chest hair he could see across the man&#39;s pecs past the low cut neck of his tank top. One arm was covered in a full sleeve tattoo of Celtic knotwork.<br />
<br />
Then Van&#39;s eyes shifted downwards and he almost choked. The guy had pulled his dick free of his jeans and soft it was bigger than Van was hard. The thing was a monster, it was a dick made for porn. &quot;Like what you see?&quot; The voice was low and raspy, with only the faintest hint of an accent. Sam snapped his eyes up and met the bright green eyes of the stranger, and was met with a cocky grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, not my thing.&quot; Van said, snapping his eyes back to the wall in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s impressive, isn&#39;t it?&quot; The other man continued, making Van scrunch up his face. He did not want to talk to some random stranger about his cock. &quot;Bet you wouldn&#39;t mind having one like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van snorted. &quot;Who wouldn&#39;t?&quot; Average as he was, he was suddenly very aware of his own dick in his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could fix that for you. For a price.&quot; The man said, his lips parting in a smile that showed off just a little too much tooth. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m drunk, not stupid.&quot; Van retorted, shaking the last drops free, ready to just be done with this whole conversation. But the man snapped his fingers and Van felt a heat in his crotch. He felt it pushing his fingers apart even before he looked down. His cock was growing, swelling without getting hard, first to the size he was when hard then past it. Girth and length it swelled, then he felt a wave of pleasure focused on his manhood, making it rise to full mast. Even his balls were swelling in their sacks, becoming two heavy weights he could feel tugging downwards. The pressure stopped he stared down at what must have been ten inches of solid meat, thick as a soda can. It felt so heavy in his hand, and so sensitive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, I can give you an upgrade. For a price.&quot; The man had been stroking himself as he watched Van changing, his grin mischievous. &quot;Agree, and you get to keep your new toy. Otherwise, I undo my magic and go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van licked his lips, thinking of all the women he could fuck with this rod and without even thinking asked. &quot;What price?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Servitude, for a year and a day. Pretty standard fairy wish payment.&quot; The man leaned against the wall as he looked Van over, still hefting his own cock in his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Servitude? Fairy?&quot; The mix of beer and arousal was making it hard for Van to think. &quot;I ain&#39;t gay, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes fairy, and not that type. Well.. yes that type, too I guess. But the magical type.&quot; He waved his fingers and Van felt a slight tug on his balls as they grew a little more. &quot;Yes, servitude. You&#39;re mine for a year and a day. Take care of my needs, all my needs, and you get to keep your new toy there when we part ways. And yes, that includes bending over for me when I need it.&quot; The man&#39;s smile turned almost predatory. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it fitting, I can make it work. And I&#39;ll make sure you enjoy every moment of it, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van stared down at his new dick, but found himself shaking his head. &quot;No way. Not for that long..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm..&quot; The man said, rubbing his bearded chin. &quot;How about I give you a test drive then, and you get to see if it&#39;s worth it. It&#39;s been a while since I had a mortal pet, I can wait a little more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So.. I can just have it for a while?&quot; Van asked, suddenly eager.<br />
<br />
&quot;For collateral. Here&#39;s the deal. You get to have your toy there, but every day you keep it without agreeing to my deal I get to make one change to you, my choice. You have two ways out, either you agree to my payment and serve me for the year and a day, as you are when you agree to it and at the end of your service you get your prize, or at any point you can have me return you to normal and we go our separate ways. I&#39;ll even be a good sport and say every day you go without agreeing to serve will count as time served if you do agree.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I can just back out whenever?&quot; Van asked, prompting the man to nod. &quot;What if I go the whole year and a day without agreeing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t.&quot; The man said evenly. &quot;But in the off chance you do, you mortals always manage to surprise me at the most inconvenient times, it&#39;ll be as if you did the full year and a day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van thought for a moment. How bad could it be enduring some weird fairy&#39;s quirks for a year? &quot;So what.. do I sign a contract in blood or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man snorted and held out his hand. &quot;No, we just shake on it. The deal was already heard by fate.&quot; Van eyes the hand that had a moment ago been on the fairy&#39;s large dick, then extended his own hand and shook it, wrinkling his nose as he felt something slick on the hand. &quot;My name is Abaltis. Anytime you want to talk to me, just say my name into a mirror and I&#39;ll hear you.&quot; He pulled his hand back and pulled up his jeans, zipping his fly and hiding his cock away. Van reached down to do the same, only to hear Abaltis snap again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What..?&quot; Van started as he felt a warmth form in him again, centering on his rear. He felt it swelling under his hand, the cheeks pillowing out a bit as he grew a perfect bubble butt, soft and a little jiggly.<br />
<br />
&quot;First day&#39;s payment.&quot; Abaltis said with his toothy grin. Van tried to pull up his pants and do his fly, but with his new endowments he found he couldn&#39;t, at least until another snap from the fairy altered his pants magically. &quot;That one is on the house.&quot; When Van looked up from doing up his fly the fairy was gone. He had to feel himself through the fabric of his shorts to make sure he wasn&#39;t imagining things.<br />
<br />
Van left the bathroom and stumbled over to the table where his friends were and sat down hard, holding his head in his hands. &quot;Oh, fuck, looks like he&#39;s going to be sick, better get him home.&quot; Paul muttered after taking one look at Van, soon he felt himself being lifted out of his chair, one friend under each arm. He must have blacked out somewhere along the way, for the next thing he knew, they were dropping him into his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hopefully he won&#39;t piss himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would serve him right. No wonder he can&#39;t keep a girlfriend. Anyway, c&#39;mon, I&#39;ll drop you off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van heard his two friends leaving his apartment as he dozed off, still fully clothed and on top of the covers.</p>
