<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">George Morre was an 85 year old man, one who had served a hard working life, one of hard manual labour for little credit.  His muscular, toned body had worn away into a flabby, tired old shape.<br />
<br />
This was not the life Mr Morre had wanted.<br />
<br />
For all his life, from when he was but a child, he had never felt he had belonged in his own body. At one point he tried to explore it, explore what it was like to be the other sex. His father had quickly ended that experiment.<br />
<br />
But even as he grew up and became a man, he never felt right. He worked day and night, trying to work to be ever image of masculinity he had seen. But the thoughts never left. Everytime he looked at a woman, especially one with child, he felt nothing but envy for the life they had. <br />
<br />
The life he was denied.<br />
<br />
It did not get any better when he married. It was in this marriage he discovered another part of himself. He discovered that, whilst he was certainly attracted to women, he found himself more attracted to men. But in the society he lived in, that would not go over any better than his true identity.<br />
<br />
As the years passed, and his children were born, grew up and had children of their own. The years wore him down, and his carefully chiselled body wore down to the pathetic state it was today.<br />
<br />
His life nowadays was pretty pathetic. His friends had all either passed on or left him behind. Most of his family did the same. The only family he had any real contact with nowadays was his grandson, Julian.<br />
<br />
Though Julian and him had 60 years of separation, the boy did try to be there for him as best he could, visiting as often as he could.<br />
<br />
It was on one of these visits that the Boutique had come to him. He had confessed to his grandson that he had once been tempted by the idea of womanhood, though did not divulge how deep it went. <br />
<br />
Giving him a sympathetic smile, Julian had said, &quot;There are ways to change change that if you are interested, Grandfather. Or should I say Grandmother.&quot;<br />
<br />
George chuckled at this, and decided to humour him. After a while of searching, he had stumbled upon the &quot;See Yourself Boutique&quot;.<br />
<br />
Though on the surface, it had little result once Julian left, he had been given pause to reflect.<br />
<br />
At his age, he had never considered to make that change. He never thought he would even live to his current age. At this stage in his life, he had believed it futile, already on borrowed time as it was. But with this little revelation, it gave him a hope that had so long been buried.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I could start again?&quot; George asked himself.<br />
<br />
He pondered over that question for several days assessing the pros and cons. Finally, he decided to throw caution to the wind and take the chance. It was rather expensive, but it would not matter. Regardless of what he chose, George Morre would soon seize to exist.<br />
<br />
It would take three months of wait for his appointment, everyday spent fearing he would die before it came, but eventually the day arrived.<br />
<br />
That day, Julian drove him to the Boutique. &quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want me to pick you up?&quot; Julian asked.<br />
<br />
If this goes well, I want to walk under my own strength.&quot; George responded.<br />
<br />
As Julian drove off, George walked to the door. His arm was shaking as he grabbed the handle, as his anticipation grew.<br />
<br />
He opened the door, hearing the little bell ring as the desk lady looked up from her papers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to See Yourself Boutique! What may I do for you today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, yes, I am George Morre, and I booked for today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning to computer, she typed at the computer for a few moments before scrolling through. &quot;Ah... oh, yes, Mr. Morre, a pleasure to meet you. You&#39;re just on time.&quot; <br />
<br />
George nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could I ask for what you want in your service?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to be a woman, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, any specifics?&quot; She asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...&quot; George stammered &quot;Could you make me younger?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We certainly can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to be somewhere in my 20s, experience the prime of my life without having to start again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... a nice figure I suppose. Y&#39;know, wide hips, large busom and bottom, large in all the right areas, small in the right areas. Oh, and blonde, I&#39;ve always wanted to be a blonde.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, and how do you want to experience your change? We have many options.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking a small step back, George thought for a moment. Turning back to the assistant, he half-jokingly responded, &quot;In a nice land with a nice spring, a cherry tree in bloom and the love of my life by my side.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took a moment to type all the info into the computer. &quot;Alright, it&#39;s been sent to the specialist. Could you please have a seat whilst everything is prepared&quot; she asked, gesturing to the nearby seats.<br />
<br />
Slowly, George moved over to the seats and sat, his joints aching as he did so.<br />
<br />
Those few minutes in the chair felt like hours as anxiousness threatened to take over.<br />
<br />
Finally, the specialist entered. She was slender woman with an hourglass figure, slim face and straight black hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Morre, we are ready for you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Mr Morre entered the room, it did not look dissimilar from your average message parlor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could I ask to strip down, sir&quot; she said gesturing to some curtains.<br />
<br />
Retreating behind the curtains, George gradually stripped, the ache of his joints and muscles resisting him at every turn. Grabbing a towel from the side, he wrapped up his waist and exited the curtains<br />
<br />
&quot;Come and lie down, Mr. Morre.&quot; She said, gently patting the seat.<br />
<br />
Wearily, George made his way to the bench, slowly laying down. &quot;I hope this is worth it.&quot; George grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me.&quot; She smiled warmly, &quot;Happiness is more than worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She crossed the room, retrieving a bottle of oil and drizzled a bit of it onto the palm of her hand. Making her way back to George, she began to rub the oil across his body, getting every nook and cranny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, smells nice.&quot; he said, beginning to feel drowsy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just the preparation, Mr. Morre.&quot; She said softly.<br />
<br />
By now, George&#39;s eyelids began to feel heavy as it began harder and harder to retain consciousness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it normal to feel so tired?&quot; George asked groggily.<br />
<br />
She smiled, telling him &quot;It&#39;s a natural part of the process, Mr. Morre.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if I want to feel it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll still felt it, Mr. Morre, all of the pleasantness. Then, when you wake up, you will be a competely different person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, sounds...nice...&quot; were his final words as he drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
When he opened his eyes next, he was at a spring, the petals of a large cherry tree delicately floating down into the water. The stones beneath his feet were hard, yet also warm beneath his feet. He stood near the spring, unsure of what to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are.&quot; <br />
<br />
He recognised that voice, the voice of one that left him so long ago. Out from the shadow of the cherry tree stepped a man, his auburn waves falling gently down his face as it bright blue eyes shone.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-Matthew, how-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been search everywhere for you, Georgia.&quot;<br />
<br />
George recoiled slightly &quot;Georgina? Matt, it&#39;s me George, I&#39;m a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s smile only grew as he walked leisurely towards George. Once he closed the distance, he gently raised his hand to George&#39;s jaw. &quot;Are you truely a man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I am.&quot; George responded shakily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why are you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
George had no response to that. He knew that if that were true he would have no reason to be here.<br />
<br />
Sadness filled Matthew&#39;s eyes, &quot;You don&#39;t have to lie to yourself any longer, my dear. All the people that denied who you are are no longer around to torment you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren&#39;t around anymore either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s eyebrow raised as he made a show of looking left and right. &quot;Am I not here now?&quot; he replied jokingly &quot;Do you believe I am here to torment you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
George could never believe Matthew was there to torment him. He had been there for George since childhood. No matter what, Matthew had always lifted his spirits, even in his worst times. Matthew was his best friend his guiding light.<br />
<br />
His one true love.<br />
<br />
Whilst it had been his marriage that gave him the suspicion he preferred men, it was only when Matthew died in his arms, as he stared into those shining blue eyes that he finally realised it.<br />
<br />
The one person he desired most, the one person he could never have.<br />
<br />
Matthew drew his hands to George&#39;s cheeks and placed a gentle kiss upon his forehead. &quot;Let&#39;s get you cleaned up.&quot; Matthew whispered.<br />
<br />
As Matt took him by the arm and led him towards the spring, he began to feel the years role off him, his joint aching less with every step. He even felt a bit taller, as his spine began to straighten.<br />
<br />
Soon, they reached the spring, the steam gently rolling from the shimmering water. Matthew wasted no time, diving into the waters. His skin tingled from the water that splashed across his body.<br />
<br />
Matthew emerged from the water, his muscles glistening as his hair fell in front of his eyes. Matthew reached up a hand to him, &quot;You don&#39;t have to fear the clensing. I&#39;m here for you always, my beloved.&quot;<br />
<br />
On instinct, George took Matthew&#39;s hand in his as he was guided towards the rocky steps. His heart fluttered as he took a breath and took his first step in.<br />
<br />
The water washed over his foot as it begun to work it&#39;s magic. The hairs were washed off the foot, leaving it smooth, as skin lightened a shade or two. The foot tingled as it shrank until it was dainty and feminine. The nail of the foot changes with it, changing from chipped and dirty to clean and manicured. Placing the other foot it, the changes repeated, the foot becoming dainty and feminine.<br />
<br />
Growing slightly bolder, George took a few more step. With the water up to his ankles, the water began to change his legs as well. The hairs were washed off as the skin became smooth and spotless brightening to match the feet. The calves shrunk slightly as they tightened up.<br />
<br />
George continued to walk into the water, ready for the changes. The water was now just past his waist. He could really feel the changes now. Once again, the hair was washed away as the skin softened and lightened. Fat began to well into the thighs, the sagging flesh filling into soft plump pillars. His hip flared outward, though there was only pleasure in this, the sagging skin smoothing and brightening to frame wide, child-bearing hips. His small, flabby bum was next, fat welling up into his rear, each cheek becoming large and round, leaving him with a heart-shaped ass framed perfectly by the wide hips.<br />
<br />
Next was the all important area. He waited a moment in anticipation. His cock began to tingle, shrinking inch by inch. As this happened, his balls pulled into his body, causing him to moan loudly. He could fell his organ shifting and rearranging, becoming a womb for childbirth. The last remnants of his cock disappeared, the mushroom of the head shrinking to leave the nub of his new clit. The empty scrotum shrank and split to reveal George&#39;s new vagina, the scrotum now forming the labia.<br />
<br />
Could he even be called a &#39;he&#39; any more? The question thrilled him, now truely beginning to think of himself more as a her.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does it feel, darling?&quot; Matt asked, grinning from ear to ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;It feels... it feels liberating.&quot; Georgia responded, taking a moment to enjoy the water gently caressing her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whenever your ready.&quot; Matt said.<br />
<br />
Georgia did not need to be to told twice, she sank into the water until it was juat below her neck.<br />
<br />
Any hairs were washed away as the skin was pulled taut, flabs melting away to taut skin, which lightened to match what had been changed. Georgia&#39;s spine changed, straightening up, before then curving inwards to make an S-shape, pushing out her plump rear even further. Her torso compressed inward, becoming slender and dainty in comparison to the bulging body of her former self. Her belly flattened, becoming tight and smooth.<br />
<br />
Broad shoulder puller inward, becoming narrow and slender. The arm experienced a similar change. The flab melt into smooth, soft skin as the fingers became slender. Fingernail elongated, becoming clean and manicured.<br />
<br />
The tingle then concentrated on her chest. The pressure built as the newly flattened chest prepared to surge forward again. The areola&#39;s stretched as the nipples inflated, the tiny dots fattening up into stiff peaks. Then with each breath, fat and milk welled up into the chest. First A-cup, then B, then C. With each increase, her joy and arousal grew. Finally, the breast finished at DD, leaving a mountainous busom to be enjoyed.<br />
<br />
Georgia did not waste time. She mewled as she played with her breast, poking and prodding at the nipple.<br />
<br />
Matt chuckled as he watched this display, &quot;You certain are enjoying this, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned her head to him, lust in her eyes. &quot;More than you could ever know.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stopped, hearing her voice and remembering she was a man. He was filled with shame at his desires, &quot;I...&quot; he stammered.<br />
<br />
Matthew closes the distance, taking George&#39;s hip lovingly as the looked into each other&#39;s eyes. &quot;You have nothing to fear,&quot; Matt whispered, &quot;Here, you are loved for who you truly are, not what others want you to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Desire came flooding back in over fear as she moaned &quot;Matt... Please...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only a few more changes left, beloved&quot;<br />
<br />
Without another thought, Georgia dived into the water, completely submerged. As she rose, she took a gulp of water. Rising back to the surface, she hacked up the water. With each cough, her voice grew lighter and fuller, leaving her with a feminine, sultry voice.<br />
<br />
She could feel the hair growing out of her scalp, replacing the thin whisps of grey hair with locks of bright gold that rolled down to her mid back. The face tingled as it reshaped. The golds of her face shrunk away to rosy cheeks and bright eyes. Her lips puffed up, going from dry and chapped to soft and kissable. Her eyelashes extended slightly, as her long reedy eyebrows were replaced by thin defined ones. Her nose shrank into a cut button and her jaw shrank and morphed into a soft jawline and perfectly straight teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt...&quot; She moaned as her transformation finished, &quot;Kiss me, make me yours.&quot;<br />
He placed his hand on the small of her back, drawing her to him. Staring deep into each others eyes, they drew closecand locked lips. That moment was the greatest in her life, so intimate with her greatest love. She did not care if it was a fantasy, she wanted to live in that fantasy for the rest of her days. For so long, she had not allowed herself to imagine the moment. Now she never wanted it to end.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it was not meant to last. As they withdrew from their heated embrace, Matt smiled sadly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What for?&quot; She asked, still starstruck by the heat of their passion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must leave you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her heart sank, &quot;What, NO!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It can&#39;t be helped&quot; he replied as the setting became brighter, harder to make out.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I won&#39;t allow you to leave. Not again&quot; she cried out, tears beginning to build.<br />
<br />
He took her hands in his, and with a sincere smile, he said, &quot;You need to let go of me, find a new way in the world. Today, you have been given a gift. Use that gift to the fullest.&quot;<br />
<br />
She could not find the word to reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have been reborn. Live that second the way you could only dream to live you first.&quot;<br />
<br />
He woke back up, believing it all to be a dream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back to the waking world, Ms Morre, I take it your experience was to your liking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppo-&quot;<br />
<br />
He stopped. It was not his normal voice.<br />
<br />
He sat up. Instead in his normal body, he was greeted by mountainous breasts, with plump nipple stiffened by the air. To add to that, there was an emptiness in his legs and the feeling of an extra seat under him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mirror.&quot; He demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;That way&quot; she pointed.<br />
<br />
He sprung up, rushing to see himself in the mirror. What he was greeted with amazed him. Staring back at him was not a sad old man with nothing but regrets. Looking back at him was a beautiful young woman, her hair cascading down her shoulder, her body big and small in all the right places. He was looking at him- no her self.<br />
<br />
She wept. She wept tears of joy, finally feeling as if she were comfortable in her own skin.<br />
<br />
Without a word, she crossed over to the room to the specialist and pulled her into a tight embrace. &quot;Thank you.&quot; She said as the tears flowed fown her face.<br />
<br />
The specialist returned the hug, &quot;A pleasure to help those in need.<br />
<br />
After a long moment, the hug was broken.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, since you are now a woman, I imagine you will need a new name.&quot;<br />
<br />
She only needed a moment &quot;Georgia.&quot;<br />
<br />
The specialist smiled &quot;Well then Georgia, you will have to get dressed, whilst we sort out the temporary documents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Georgia wasted no time. She was brimming with new confidence, and she was going to show it. She took to the room with a risque mindset. From the wardrobe, she selected a black thong that just peered over jeggings that showed off her curves, a blue crop top, and hair band to tie up her hair and a pair of high heels. To her surprise, she was able to walk around in the high heels with ease, as if she had alway worn them.<br />
<br />
Making her way back to the desk, she was greeted by the receptionist. &quot;My, my, Ms. Morre,&quot; she exclaimed &quot;bold today aren&#39;t we.&quot; To which Georgia chuckled.<br />
<br />
The receptionist slid the papers forward. &quot;Temporary paper work and ID, enough to cover for you to get the real thing.<br />
<br />
Georgia nodded, &quot;Thank you for everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, thank you for choose us to perform your rebirth.&quot;<br />
<br />
When she entered, she was George Morre, the 85 year old man with only regrets. She left as Georgia Morre, the 20 year old woman of confidence and possibilities.<br />
<br />
Now it was time to explore those posibilities.</p>
