<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A brilliant flash of light illuminated the area, blinding Agent Dyson. Blinking he now scanned the area, finding he was now alone with the large man named Tom Harris.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on,&quot; Dyson stated. Tom said nothing, a scowl across his face as he glared at Dyson. &quot;I dont know what you want but your under arrest.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Dyson raised his pistol, he was shocked as a series of chains wrapped around his pistol, crushing it before wrapping around Dyson&#39;s forearm. The agent winced as the chains now constricted around his arm.<br />
<br />
Tom now made a quick motion with his hand, the chains drawing Dyson quickly to him where Tom delivered a vicious right hook. &quot;Quiet,&quot; Tom growled. &quot;You dont get a say in this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dyson wiped the blood from his mouth, a snarl escaping his lips. As he now tried to lunge towards Tom more chains sprang from the ground, wrapping around Dysons neck and lifting him off the ground. The agent now began to gag as he dangled in mid air.<br />
<br />
&quot;No talk,&quot; Tom said. &quot;This is personal. You&#39;ve tortured my family long enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;ve made yourself judge, jury, and executioner,&quot; Dyson wheezed as the chains tightened around his neck. &quot;That makes you nothing but a monster. What will your wife and sons say when they find out their father is a cold blooded murderer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my cross to bear,&quot; Tom said quietly. &quot;And it&#39;s why I brought you here, away from everyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dyson glared at the future Tom Harris, his eyes bulging as he struggled for breath. &quot;See you....in hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea,&quot; Tom whispered. With a quick flick of his wrist Tom Harris now summoned forth more chains, watching as they wrapped themselves around Dyson&#39;s body. The agent howled in pain as the chains dug into his body, squeezing him tightly. Soon enough Dysons body was completely entombed within Tom&#39;s magical chains. Tom now screamed as the chains tore through Dyson&#39;s body, blood, gore and viscera seeming to explode. As the remnants of Dysons body splattered to the ground, Tom sighed rubbing his eyes. The man that had tortured his family was gone yet his death brought him no peace.<br />
<br />
*****************************<br />
<br />
Daichi and Eichi how sat in a van with half a dozen mercenaries. While the four and three tailed brothers had remained by Fukushu side, Daichi had many reservations about what they were doing. &quot;This is madness brother,&quot; the four tailed whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do this for Lord Fukushu brother,&quot; the three tailed Eichi exclaimed. &quot;The wizards are our enemies. They have bewitched Lord Tatsu. If we are to survive than we must do this.&quot; Daichi could only shake his head, sighing. If his little brother had not chosen to remain by Fukushu&#39;s side he would never have accompanied him. Daichi did not believe in what they were doing yet he had made a promise to his mother. No matter what he would keep his little brother safe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five minutes,&quot; the driver stated.<br />
<br />
Daichi could see the mercenaries nod, leading weapons as the van turned. All Daichi could hope for now was that his little brother would not be harmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Contact!&quot;<br />
<br />
The van came to a screeching halt, the four tail kitsune watching as the mercenaries lept from the van, weapons at the ready. Daichi now grabbed his brother who attempted to join them. &quot;Wait Eichi,&quot; he yelled. <br />
<br />
Eichi shot his brother an incredulous look, the kitsunes face forming into a scowl. Before he could answer he watched as the soldiers were pushed back. At first curious the brothers gasped as Samantha the dragoness pounced on the soldiers, throwing them into a nearby by tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;The wizards,&quot; Eichi gasped. &quot;Brother this is our chance!&quot; Eichi let out a triumphant yell, freeing himself from his brothers grasp as he moved to attack. <br />
<br />
Samantha could see the two kitsunes in the back of the van. The three tail looked anxious tonight while the four tail seemed to be pleading with him to stop. As the younger kitsune charged, he didnt notice Mike speeding towards him. Mike in his organic steel form collided with Eichi. Stunned the three tail steadied himself as his brother stood in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave my brother alone,&quot; Daichi pleaded as he looked between Samantha and Mike. The wizards were momentarily confused before Eichi pushed his brother out of the way. &quot;Prepare for your defeat,&quot; Eichi bellowed.<br />
<br />
As Eichi now sped towards Samantha and Mike, he was shocked to see a young man, perhaps college age appear out of nowhere. The man appeared to be in his early 20s with long brown hair. &quot;Hey there,&quot; he smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you,&quot; Eichi asked as he skidded to a stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I&#39;m Matt,&quot; the man said. &quot;Listen, I&#39;m not sure why your trying to attack the Davis family but Im going to have to ask you to stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eichi was visibly confused, confusion that quickly turned to anger. &quot;Leave,&quot; the three tailed bellowed as he struck Matt in the face. Much to the kitsunes surprise Matt did not fall, his head only turning slightly. &quot;Ouch,&quot; Matt grinned, rubbing the spot on his cheek. &quot;I forgot kitsune packed a hell of a punch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daichi now looked apprehensively at the young man. He could tell he wasnt human, but what was he? Slowly Matt&#39;s body began to shift, his form seeming to go out of focus as it grew in massive proportions. In only seconds where a young man sat, now stood a massive gold dragon. Instinctively Daichi stepped in front of his brother to shield him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please do not hurt my brother,&quot; he pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What no I&#39;m not going to hirt him,&quot; Matt said quickly. As he tried to answer he could here the mercenaries holler as they opened fire on him. The dragon king simply sighed, a lazy flick of his tail sending them sprawling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be the brothers,&quot; Matt stated. &quot;Listen I&#39;m only here to help the Davis family. Theres someone else that wants to speak with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two brothers blood ran cold as a set of hands crashed down upon their shoulders. Slowly turning the pair gasped as they gazed at Tatsu. &quot;Lord Tatsu,&quot; they gasped.<br />
<br />
Tatsu simply glared at the two kitsune, seemingly staring into their souls. &quot;Daichi,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;You have fulfilled your mothers wish. You have kept your brother safe. It is time to come home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our task is not finished,&quot; Eichi stated, putting on a brave face. &quot;Fukushu has said our actions will save the clan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He has used you,&quot; Tatsu countered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever the punishment is,&quot; Daichi said quickly. &quot;I shall accept it in place of my brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a feeling you would Daichi,&quot; Tatsu smirked. &quot;However I will not be the one punishing you.&quot; Beckoning towards a portal the brothers watched as a middle aged 7 tails stomped towards them. &quot;Mother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont you mother me,&quot; the 7 tails exclaimed as she smacked the two brothers with a bamboo shoot. Daichi lowered his head as his little brother now tried to protest. &quot;But mother I OWW!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Running between dimensions,&quot; she yelled, grabbing Eichi by the ear. &quot;Scaring your mother and not even bothering to check in! Boy when I get you home I&#39;m gonna smack the fur off that butt of yours!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eichi continued to protest, his mother dragging him back through the portal as Daich could only follow, a look of relief on his face as he realized his brother was finally safe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the help Tatsu,&quot; Matt said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need for thanks,&quot; Tatsu smiled. &quot;I appreciate you contacting me. Daichi has been sending messages to his mother about his brother. We thought this would end in tragedy. By the way, how are your parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vertigan is happily enjoying his retirement,&quot; Matt said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what of Tiamat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom,&quot; Matt sighed in annoyance. &quot;She checks in everyday. I swear she treats me like a hatchling!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mothers often refuse to see their children as adults,&quot; Tatsu laughed. Turning towards  Samantha and Mike, the nine tailed Kitsune bowed before vanishing into the portal back to his world.</p>
