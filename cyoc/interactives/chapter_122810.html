<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two walk without any talk for about an hour or so in completely silence other than the quaking thuds caused by both Issac&#39;s heavy form and Ilvir&#39;s smaller but nearly as heavy body as well.<br />
<br />
     As they walk it was Issac with his icy body to first notice the rise in temperature. At first it was only about a degree or two in increase but as they descended further into the chasm only guided by their arcane sense pointing them towards the powerful source of the corruption that was still quite a distance away from where they were now.  However soon the heat would turn to nearly boiling point and the soft bubbling of magma could be heard throughout the caves.<br />
<br />
  They were approaching lava level now. I can already feel my icy body growing weak and no doubt being this close to the source of the corruption would attract monsters far more powerful than what we have seen so far, but perhaps this is also an advantage. This heat itself is painful to the point where I can feel some of my building lust start of fade. This will give me more time before I lose control, and will hopefully get us some progress in this cursed crypt. Thought Issac in his mind, panting like a dog, feeling his parts of his body begin to give off vapor from the extreme heat<br />
<br />
      Ilvir notices Issac&#39;s sensitivity towards the heat but for now still followed the beast, his own body which being only comprised of granite was much more adapted to the heat than Issac.<br />
<br />
        The cavern opened up onto a clifface with a large lake of lava the size of three football fields below them. Due to the large gale still occurring high above them flying would be next to impossible Issac thought  in his mind as he started to feel even weaker now that he was even closer to the magma.  There was no discernible way to cross the lava lake beneath them without dying.<br />
<br />
  They would have to find an alternate route.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Ilvir, have any ideas?&quot; Issac asked the stone golem.<br />
<br />
   &quot;How you know my name when I never told you it is suspicious to say the least but I&#39;ll ignore that for now.&quot; he said with an obvious hint of distrust in his voice. &quot;With the gale above you can&#39;t fly us across, especially concerning how well that worked last time. Anyway, so far we had seen no other path that we could go through without certain death so in my opinion crossing this lake would be our best bet.&quot; Ilvir says before suddenly clutching his granite head, grunting slightly in the process.<br />
<br />
  He is still fighting against the corruption. For now he&#39;ll have to make due. Issac thought. Looking across the obstacle in his way he tried brainstorming an idea but nothing came to mind, any magic or any other of his abilities would serve no use in this situation.<br />
<br />
    Then he heard it. His wolf ears perked up as he listened closely half thinking he was out of his mind. The he heard it again. The slight sizzling sound of magma on stone. It was growing louder and more numerous.<br />
<br />
    Issac began to growl and turned to Ilvir: &quot;Hear that?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
  Ilvir confused at first but then picked up on the sound as well. The two of them looked down the clifface and saw the magma below them start to shift and flow in unnatural ways. <br />
    <br />
    Then like a crocodile appearing out of water, strange shapes seemingly made of molten rock began to climb out of the lake, their hands sticking to the solid rock, with them starting to slowly make their way up. At first there were only two or three but their numbers would soon then increase to five then seven then nine, capping to around a dozen as strange reptilian creatures began to climb up the rock walls towards them. <br />
<br />
       &quot;Dragons?&quot; Issac asked his voice slightly in a panic, if these were dragons, one of the mightest of corrupted creatures, they would have no chance of survival. Even the weakest of those beasts themselves were considered to be on the level of the old Titans that had ravaged the world at one point in history. <br />
<br />
  &quot;No you fool. Do you know as much as that bestial form conveys? Those are salamanders a powerful type of fire elemental, their body alone is said to be able to melt mythril with ease.&quot; Ilvir said with annoyance. &quot;Regardless this many will cause a problem, who they sensed is is beyond me but running will only excite them and cause them to give further chase. We will have to stand here and fight if we wish to survive.&quot; Ilvir explained.<br />
<br />
     Issac nodded, ignoring Ilvir&#39;s attitude for now. He&#39;ll be sure to work out that at a later time. Pulling out his dagger ready to use it only if nessesary as he would rather not become more monsterous than he already was.<br />
<br />
     The salamanders moved quickly once completely out of the magma, scaling up the walls with ease and leaping on the paladins&#39; platform.<br />
<br />
      Ilvir with his stronge muscular body managed to punch and kick any that came close to him, hurling them off the platform with ease, sending them to the magma below where they would simply restart their climb up.  Despite his granite body, using a mixture of skilled material combat and holy magic, Ilvir managed to keep any wounds to a minimum and managed to keep his body from melting from their intense heat.<br />
<br />
   Issac was another story. Their molten body was a direct counter to his icy one, and was forced to use a nearby stone stalagmite which he had broken off as a makeshift weapon. However salamanders&#39; stamina was seemingly relentless with not even a stalagmite through the chest begin able to kill them. Their elemental forms gave them a certain immunity to pretty much any nonmagical weapon, and due to their bodily corruption both Issac and Ilvir could not produce enough holy energy to use in battle.<br />
<br />
    Then as they were starting to get overwhelming as more Salamanders were beginning to arrive, Issac noticed something. Or rather two things. After using his stalagmite to temporarily flip over a salamander he noticed something in it&#39;s nether regions. Two large reptilian dicks made up of solid obsidian and both gently leaking a hot orange liquid from their tips.<br />
<br />
   Despite their radiating heat causing Isaac to flinch away in pain should his icy skin melt he couldn&#39;t help but feel his own stirring in his crotch. His metal loincloth moved away from his dick as it began to stirr to full mass, its tip already leaking as well, though the semen instantly evaporated once exposed to the intense heat around them.<br />
<br />
   Ilvir didn&#39;t notice Issac&#39;s plight as he himself was already fighting off four salamanders as once, his breaths ragged and deep.<br />
<br />
       Issac tried to concentrate but couldn&#39;t help but be drawn to their corrupted dicks which were now noticeable as daylight to him. The Ring of Purity&#39;s effects still kept his mind clean of mental corruption but his body was still affected by lust that was in turn affecting his mind. <br />
<br />
Isaac now hungry with lust to assimilate the fire salamanders plunged his dagger into the closest one, waiting for the glorious absorption of corruption into his own body. His own frozen body was temporarily wracked with pain as he purposely went near the searing hot salamanders quickly plugging his dagger into several of them before moving onto the next. In several seconds Issac in his horny rage had already stabbed about six of the salamanders already feeling the transfer begin.<br />
<br />
<br />
       The six salamanders shuddered before almost getting sucked into Issac as he became wracked with pleasure. Ilvir watched from the corner of his eyes as Issac was coated in a layer of liquid hot magma as his icy vines would come out from the molten cocoon and once again wrap themselves around his form. Issac&#39;s body gained another two feet in height making him about ten feet. His vines once more covering his body reforming his horns, wings, fur, and tail as almost instantly his entire backside became alight in a mantle of large blue flames that seemed to both singe and freeze at the same time. His armor now nowhere near enough to form a suitable loincloth simply turned into a large codpiece that held not one but two gigantic sheaths, housing two similarly sized canine cocks, his balls now even bigger than before.<br />
<br />
          Not even caring to look at his new form, Issac&#39;s four arms began to vigorously jack off at an alarming speed while his thick tail instantly  plunging itself into Issac&#39;s tight pucker in and out quickly.<br />
<br />
        Issac roared in pleasure, giving deep primal screams of pure pleasure as the remaining salamanders ran away seeing this new beast.<br />
<br />
    Ilvir couldn&#39;t help but watch Issac&#39;s lustful actions and felt himself grow hard at the sight of such a powerful beast giving into such primal pleasure.<br />
<br />
         However Issac suddenly stopped his intense masturbation session and looked towards Ilvir, growling in lust as he made his way towards him, and Ilvir had a sinking feeling of what Issac was after...</p>
