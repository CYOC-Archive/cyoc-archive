<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan was frozen as a statue while his mother watched his naked body. He was 16 years old that morning, then his witch sister turned him into a 25 years old young man. And now, his mother had turned him into a 45 years old man. It was almost 30 years in age for Dan, his grownup modesty completely exposed to the female members of his family and he can&#39;t do anything about it.<br />
<br />
Dan&#39;s mother was also a witch but, despite Kat, she had gone through a lot with her magic power and she had learned to respect humans. Seeing her grownup son naked in front of her remind her of all the hilarious situations she lived with her husband. At first, they weren&#39;t even friends but somehow he always ended up in a trouble caused by her inexperienced magic.<br />
<br />
Remembering was good, but she can&#39;t stay in the barn forever. Kat&#39;s party was going to start and she promised herself she&#39;ll try to give her daughter the most normal possible party she can. She immediately remembered why she was there, she was looking for Dan so he can go for the birthday cake. She knew she can make one with magic, but for some reason they aren&#39;t that good as a normal one.<br />
<br />
Using her magic fingers, she turned Dan back into his teenager self. Then she used it once again to covering him with clothes. Now he looked like nothing had happened. Except for the little gift she gave him on his groin. For witch standards, men should have very long dicks. What was average for a female human, was small for a witch. She grinned because she knew it wasn&#39;t very comfortable for a male human to be that big.<br />
<br />
After a quick look, she whispered a small mind command to Dan&#39;s ear, so he won&#39;t remember his time as a cow but he will remember his sister is a witch and he should be careful around her. His mother left and his trance fade away, he was a little bit dizzy for a minute and then he remembered he promised his mother he will go for Kat&#39;s birthday cake. He went back to the house and took his car keys.<br />
<br />
While he was driving he felt kinda uncomfortable, he was constantly moving on his seat but he wasn&#39;t sure why. So, he tried to ignore it as much as he can until he returns home. Then, he can go to his bathroom and check his body. He already knew that Kat was a witch with magic powers, but he didn&#39;t remember she had done something to him.<br />
<br />
After taking the cake and leaving the bakery, Dan noticed that his friend Raleigh was in a nearby park talking with Keith. Dan wondered why Keith was there and not at Kat&#39;s party, since they&#39;re friends and he knew she liked him. He left the cake inside the car and went to see them. They told him, they felt kinda dizzy, that they&#39;re sure they forgot something and, particularly, Keith was feeling uncomfortable like Dan.<br />
<br />
Dan knew that couldn&#39;t be a mere coincidence, so he told them he felt the same way and suggested that maybe it was related to his sister. Keith was invited to Kat&#39;s party, so he decided to go there, while Dan invited Raleigh to hangout in his bedroom meanwhile. They drove back to Dan&#39;s home where the party had already started and loud music could be heard even from outside.<br />
<br />
Through the kitchen&#39;s window, Dan&#39;s mother noticed that her son was back and she was surprised to see those other two boys were coming with him. She was a little bit worried that they could remember something of what happened, magic is not perfect and they could figure it out if they manage to put the pieces together. She didn&#39;t want to interfere more, but she should be prepared for anything.<br />
<br />
Dan left the cake in the dining table and did his best to ignore Kat&#39;s guests and go directly to his bedroom. Raleigh did the same and followed him occasionally saying hi to a few guys he knew. Keith wasn&#39;t feeling very comfortable but he didn&#39;t want to be to rude with Kat, so he decided to stay and talk. Kat was intentionally avoiding him, she already realized that she made a mistake before.<br />
<br />
But didn&#39;t feel guilty of what she did to her brother, Keith and Raleigh. No, she was regretting she had forgotten his mother was around there and she was way more powerful than her. Right now, she told Kat to enjoy her birthday party, but Kat knew that when the party is over, her punishment will be awaiting for her. It was terrifying just thinking about it.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in Dan&#39;s room. Dan was telling Raleigh that he didn&#39;t feel very well, that something was different in his body but he didn&#39;t realize what it is. Raleigh suggested they could play some videogames and eventually he will realize or, at least, forget about it. They played for a few hours, but Dan&#39;s discomfort didn&#39;t fade out. He needed to look at himself at a mirror urgently.<br />
<br />
Dan ran to the bathroom and as soon as he closed the door, he started to take his clothes off. First, his shirt. Nothing weird. Then his pants. Same. He was going to take his underwear off, when he noticed something definitely strange. Ignoring the fact he was wearing tighty whities, something he had never done since he was 8 years old. He was sporting the hugest bulge he had ever seen.<br />
<br />
Dan was completely sure he wasn&#39;t that endowed that morning. It looked so comically huge that he would remember it. He immediately discarded his briefs only to watch his dick flopping out like a pink sausage. It literally looked like a pink sausage swaying side to side like if it was alive. It was too big that it seemed fake, but no, it was completely real. Freaking weirdly real.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Raleigh was waiting for Dan to come back. The videogame was paused and his cellphone was running out of battery. So, he was looking through the window. He can see the old barn that Dan&#39;s family didn&#39;t use at all. He liked to see it when he was at Dan&#39;s home. He always dreamed of working at a farm taking care of animals. Unfortunately, his parents were just merchants and they expected he becomes a merchant too.<br />
<br />
Keith can&#39;t believe that it was almost midnight. He ended up having a very good time at Kat&#39;s party and for some reason, he started to think she is way more attractive being mysterious and distant like she was acting that day. Ironically, she was liking that more than her continuous attempts to be with him. He was thinking too much about her, that he completely ignored what right now was freaking Dan out.<br />
<br />
Kat&#39;s mother didn&#39;t take her eyes off Keith, and she was worried that he begins to remember what happened to him before and freaks out. She knew it was forbidden but she was using her magic to separate them even if Kat was doing the same by her own. She was tired, it was almost midnight and she wasn&#39;t too young to stay up that late, but she didn&#39;t want to go to bed before the party ends.</p>
