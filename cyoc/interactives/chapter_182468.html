<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Right.&quot; She pulled her phone from her purse, did a quick search for &quot;Ethiopian jackal&quot;. Tim came over to sit beside her. Without thinking, the culpeo put his arm around the girl&#39;s shoulders, pulling her close as he browsed through images of red jackals. Tim snuggled happily against him, although she seemed less interested in the results than in the red organ nestled against Shari&#39;s lower belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you&#39;re definitely an Ethiopian jackal. See how your tail matches?&quot; Shari indicated an image with her thumb-claw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Canis simensis.</i> Ehtiopian wolf, huh. Also called the Simien jackal and the Simien... fox.&quot; Shari suddenly became aware of a hand stroking along her tail on the bed. &quot;Uh, Tim?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm? Oh!&quot; Shari felt the girl&#39;s body jerk, which finally made <i>her</i> aware of how she was effectively hugging the jackal to her. She lifted her arm from Tim&#39;s shoulders, and the jackal scooted slightly away from her, ears down. &quot;Sorry. I-I guess I should have asked. It&#39;s just so... big and fluffy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I mean no! I didn&#39;t mind, it&#39;s just... weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shari found her gaze drifting down to her crotch. &quot;And... speaking of weird... sorry about...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About what?&quot; asked Tim, tilting her head in confusion. Shari looked up at her, surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;My, uh, erection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? But why are you sorry about it? I... don&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Shari didn&#39;t know what to say to that. She&#39;d always had an impression it was rude to &quot;show&quot; in public, or to let on to girls that they turned you on -- not that she had ever had to deal with the &quot;problem&quot; herself, given her lacklustre figure, but plenty of other girls seemed offended by it. But then, Tim was -- or had been -- a boy, so she supposed he didn&#39;t find it odd. Which brought her back to why she had wanted to talk with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how do you control it? I mean, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re not upset by how much I -- my body likes yours, but it&#39;s just... it&#39;s always <i>there,</i> and it&#39;s like it has a mind of its own, and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it the same for girls? I mean, obviously your equipment isn&#39;t as... as big as a boy&#39;s, but I um... I can definitely tell when I&#39;m aroused, and it&#39;s just as hard to ignore as before I changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made her think. She didn&#39;t recall feeling aroused often as a girl. In fact the only examples that came to mind were tf/tg stories, especially those involving a dominant male -- whom she envied more than anything, though she hadn&#39;t dared to admit this even to her online buddies. Her cock throbbed at the memory, and she felt that wash of heat through herself again. She had to resist the urge to touch herself, conscious of Tim&#39;s gaze.<br />
<br />
<i>Maybe that&#39;s all it is. just being aroused by sexy stuff, and it&#39;ll become more manageable once I get used to it.</i> That made her feel a little better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still...&quot; She tried to think. <i>That powerful feeling though... It was so different from even my horniest moments...</i> She decided to try a different tack. &quot;What&#39;s it like, being a boy? How do you feel when you&#39;re aroused?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim glanced at her sidelong. &quot;...You have to ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if what I&#39;m feeling is normal!&quot;<br />
<br />
The jackal turned to her, suddenly sympathetic. &quot;Aw, Shari. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re afraid to be a boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Shari looked away. &quot;...It feels awesome, but... just tell me what you remember about it, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. It&#39;s like... you think about girls, about, um... well, you want to... claim them, I guess? M-mark them? Ahhh...&quot; Shari glanced back, and saw that Tim&#39;s fingers had brushed her clit.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s turning you on?&quot; he blurted, covering her mouth again. Tim nodded bashfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah... I-I was never attracted to guys before... I don&#39;t think... b-but now... you&#39;re... actually driving me pretty crazy with that... m-musk? You smell so... <i>powerful</i> and your cock looks so b-big and... thick...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop,&quot; laughed Shari, suddenly bashful himself but pleased all the same. Tim smiled tentatively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it [i]is[/i] weird, but I want it inside me as much as I used to want to get inside a girl. You were a girl -- have you ever felt this... hollow, fluttering feeling in your lower stomach?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sometimes.&quot; Shari paused, not wanting to dwell on it. &quot;I like it better now though. And I do know what you mean... It&#39;s like I&#39;m full and I need to empty myself into someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly!&quot; Tim bounced on the bed happily, then looked shy again. &quot;So um... what&#39;s it look like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My cock? Like a dog&#39;s cock, just bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So matter-of-fact.&quot; Tim stuck her tongue out. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen a dog cock, though. Would you mind showing me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shari&#39;s face heated behind her fur. She had noticed you couldn&#39;t really <i>see</i> a blush through the fur, but she had been able to smell when Tim was embarrassed, and she guessed that Tim could too. Still, the jackaless looked so eager... and it made him feel so... <i>horny</i> to think the hot female wanted to see his maleness...<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I guess!&quot; He stood up, pulling the awkward sweat pants off, and gratefully discarding the boxers. For good measure he pulled the T off as well, leaving him exposed in all his slim glory. He put his hands on his hips, tail waving proudly behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooooooo.&quot; Tim had gotten up too, and now bent over, hands on knees, her breasts swaying, bringing that hot desire back to Shari in force. The jackaless&#39; eyes sparkled as she examined the long, red, pointed shaft, the heavy balls below it, the pouch folded down beneath a mostly-engorged knot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sooooo...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you like what you see,&quot; teased Shari.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
The jackaless leaned in even closer. Suddenly her tongue darted out and licked the tip. Both canines yipped in surprise, Shari jumping back onto the bed, Tim collapsing onto her butt on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!&quot; she apologised. &quot;It just smelled so... I needed a taste! I should have asked --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have said yes,&quot; admitted Shari. He kept his legs spread, silently inviting the jackal to come back for more. &quot;It felt...&quot; <i>Indescribable.</i> It wasn&#39;t even just the physical sensation. It was that image, stuck in his brain, of the sexy jackaless wanting his cock.<br />
<br />
He almost asked her to continue, but then decided that if she wanted it, she could ask for it. Instead he posed a different question. &quot;What&#39;s it like -- having sex as a boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Yeah I don&#39;t know.&quot; The jackal girl looked away, embarrassed. &quot;I&#39;ve never a-actually been with a girl before. I, um...&quot; She trailed off.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Shari felt a pang of sympathy. Somehow she thought she&#39;d been the only one who&#39;d been left out. But Tim, while not the pariah she was, still was nothing special, and all of the attractive girls were already staked out. &quot;Yeah, me neither. I mean I&#39;ve never had sex, with boy or girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Once again Tim looked at the culpeo from the corner of her eye. &quot;Maybe we could... have our first time together...?&quot;</p>
