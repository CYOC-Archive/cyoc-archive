<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica and Robert had their secluded lake front house all decorated and ready for Easter. They were looking forward to their family visiting for the long weekend. <br />
<br />
Robert was finishing setting up the first of many Easter Egg hunts for when their guests started arriving. It was customary for all the kids to begin the holiday with a quick scavenger hunt upon arrival to the property. Robert yelled to his 15 and 17 year old sons who were shirtless in a pair of swim trunks like normal at the lake, &quot;John!...Lucas! Help me set up the egg hunt! Uncle Doug and Aunt Debbie will be here any moment with your first group of cousins.&quot; John and Lucas toweled off and headed to help their father.<br />
<br />
“Help me finish hiding eggs around the yard. Doug, Debbie and your cousins will be here any second.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Sophia came walking up. She just turned 6 and was looking forward to seeing her cousins that were around her age. Among the children Doug and Debbie had, Sophia was mostly excited to see Mathew and Markus. They were twin 5 year old boys that had a history of playing rough. Sophia couldn&#39;t wait to brag that she was soooo much older than them now that she just had her birthday and turned 6 a few months before they did. <br />
<br />
Sophia was curious when her girl cousins her age were showing up and asked, &quot;Mommy? When are Lilly and Zoe going to be here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica replied, &quot;Sorry sweetie. There won&#39;t be any girl cousins arriving this weekend. Maybe you could talk Mathew or Markus into using the magic medallion so you have a girl around to play with.&quot; Sophia nodded and ran off. Jessica asked her husband, &quot;Doug and Debbie ARE bringing the magic medallion right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Robert smirked, &quot;I didn&#39;t ask but I hope so. They usually bring it along whenever they go on vacation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, an SUV rolled up their long driveway. Robert pointed, &quot;They are here. I guess we will find out shortly if they brought the magic medallion with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica recognized the woman smiling and waving from the passenger seat and started laughing, <br />
&quot;They definitely brought it. It looks like my sister already used it. She showed up to the party as ME!&quot;<br />
<br />
Debbie got out smiling and struck a pose, &quot;Hi sis! What do you think of your new body? I&#39;ve been working on it for weeks. It&#39;s an early birthday present.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica admired her thinner and shapelier form. Over the years, she&#39;d gotten lazy and gained some weight. She loved seeing herself toned again, &quot;I love it! I can&#39;t wait to go shopping for skinny clothes again!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I got you covered sis. I brought you two suitcases of clothing to get you started with your new form.&quot; Debbie explained.<br />
<br />
Jessica was excited, &quot;Thanks! How&#39;d you fit all your kids, luggage, and two extra suitcases for my new body in your car?&quot;<br />
<br />
Debbie pulled out the magic medallion from her purse and dangled it back and forth, &quot;We had to get creative to fit everybody and all our stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica grabbed the medallion, “I&#39;ll take that! I can&#39;t wait to try out the new and improved me.&quot; She touched it with the clothing Debbie was wearing and her body began to tingle. Moments later her pants and shirt felt loose due to the sudden toning of her hips and stomach. Her breasts shot out an extra cup size as she excitedly ran her hands up and downz<br />
<br />
“This was the best birthday present ever! It&#39;s not too drastic. I can just explain to everybody that I&#39;ve been dieting and exercising to tone things up!&quot; <br />
<br />
Robert noticed an upgrade and licked his lips staring at his wife&#39;s chest, &quot;Are those DD&#39;s?&quot;<br />
<br />
Debbie nodded, &quot;Yep. I had to make sure my favorite brother-in-law would enjoy his wife&#39;s new body too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Robert stared back and forth at exact copies of his wife&#39;s upgraded body with a chuckle, &quot;This is cool. I have twin wives now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Doug got out of the driver&#39;s seat of the SUV and joked, &quot;The Debbie on the left is mine!&quot;<br />
<br />
Robert smiled at his brother-in-law noticing Doug gave himself some upgrades too. He still had his normal appearance but his body was very toned. His muscles and 6 pack abs were outlined in his tight shirt. Instead of his typical beer gut, he looked like a body builder who performed at weight lifting competition. Robert offered a handshake, &quot;It&#39;s good to see you buddy. Somebody has been working out...&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug nodded, &quot;Yep! I heard you needed help moving a bunch of stuff from your garage to your newly remodeled shed by the lake. I can dead lift 500 pounds with these pipes!&quot; Robert felt tiny compared to Doug&#39;s body builder form. <br />
<br />
Doug motioned to the twin Jessicas and joked, &quot;Since Debbie has been working on Jessica&#39;s new body so much recently...I gotta come clean buddy...I&#39;ve been banging the shit out of your wife lately...&quot; <br />
<br />
Robert laughed, &quot;I can&#39;t wait to find out for myself! Her new DD&#39;s are going to be fun to play with.&quot; Robert admired Doug&#39;s body builder form and said, &quot;I&#39;m giving myself huge muscles like you! I have the perfect shirt to use with the medallion. I got it online form a memorabilia shop that is signed and was last worn by a professional wrestler. Once I&#39;m as strong as you we gotta go a few rounds for old time sake. It&#39;s going to be fun kicking your ass like the good old days!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re on!&quot; Doug agreed as he mentioned, &quot;Speaking of the medallion, I better let my kids out of the car.&quot; <br />
<br />
Doug opened the back door and a Yorkshire Terrier jumped out and put its paws up on Robert to greet him. <br />
<br />
Robert pet the dog as it started licking his face and slobbering all over. Robert started laughing as the small dogs tore off into the yard finding a place to pee.  It lifted it’s leg by a tree to relieve itself after the long drive. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was a rather adventurous form to take while traveling.&quot;  Robert commented <br />
<br />
&quot;It freed up space. There was no way we were going to fit all of our luggage AND all of our kids comfortably in the car at the same time.” Debbie explained<br />
<br />
Robert wondered which one of his nephews it was.  Debbie answered his curiosity by yelling at the dog, “Riley! Don&#39;t you dare poop in the middle of the yard where people might walk and accidentally step on it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Doug reminded his wife, &quot;I thought we were calling him Rocky...&quot;<br />
<br />
Debbie nodded, &quot;Oh yea. ROCKY. COME.&quot; Riley came running up on all 4&#39;s. Jessica pet his head while turning a switch on his collar to the *SHOCK-charged* position. He let out a brief whimper knowing his collar was now active.<br />
<br />
 &quot;It&#39;s for your own good. I don&#39;t have any papers proving that you&#39;re our pet.  If you got loose and were caught by a dog catcher it would be tricky to convince the dog pound we are your owners.&quot; Debbie reminded him, <br />
<br />
She held up the remote control for the shock collar with a parental tone, &quot;Don&#39;t make me use this! You can run around the trails as long as you stay on Uncle Robert&#39;s land. If you even THINK about wandering off the property I won&#39;t hesitate to give you a shock.&quot;<br />
<br />
I know the perfect buddy to make sure Rile-I Jean “Rocky” doesn’t wander.  Max has lived here his entire life and knows the trails perfectly. I&#39;m sure he can keep an eye and lead Rocky around.&quot; Robert whistled loudly and yelled, &quot;MAX. COME.&quot; <br />
<br />
Barks were heard in the distance as their family dog came running out from the woods. Max was a Golden Retriever that was much bigger than Rocky. As the dogs m greeted each other with ceremonial butt sniffs, they ran off to explore. <br />
<br />
“By the way, how did get your 14 years old son to agree to all that?” Robert asked Doug while gesturing towards the dogs in the distance. <br />
<br />
“He enjoys the freedom, well, outside of the collar restriction that is.  He really likes being dogs but I had convince him to be such small male dog for the trip.  He usually transforms to larger male breeds.”<br />
<br />
“Is he passed his insecure phase yet?  Debbie told us he had behavior issues last year.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t remind me.  He’s short for his age and is quick when it comes to confrontation.  He doesn’t like being compared to the other kids.”<br />
<br />
Next, twin 5 year old girls climbed out of the car wearing matching Easter dresses. <br />
<br />
&quot;Those cuties are Mathew and Markus. We call them Maddie and Molly when they&#39;re like this. They are sooooo much better behaved when they are girls. It was a relief not to listen to twin boys farting and making burp sounds the entire drive.&quot; Debbie explained to Robert and Jessica,<br />
<br />
Jessica cooed at their outfits saying, &quot;Awww. Those dresses are adorable. I love your pretty bows in your hair too.&quot; <br />
<br />
The twins looked down at the ground in embarrassment.  “Mom basically forced us into this...” <br />
<br />
“Not true, I gave you the puppy option as well but you two insisted on staying human so you could play video games on the ride here.  Now, be good little girls and show off your dresses for your auntie.” The twins did as they we told and gave a unenthusiastic twirl. <br />
<br />
“Sophia is going to be thrilled she has girls her age to play with.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oops. I didn&#39;t know Mathew and Marcus would show up as girls. I set out blue Easter baskets for them. I&#39;ll go grab two more pink baskets from the shed so they can start hunting for eggs.&quot; Robert said. <br />
<br />
Debbie giggled, &quot;You can leave one of the blue baskets out. Willie might want to use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Robert was confused, &quot;It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve heard you refer to your oldest son...the senior in high school as...Willie. You only called him that when he was....&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, a much younger version of William jumped out of the SUV with a cell phone in his hands announcing, &#39;I&#39;m way too old to hunt for Easter Eggs Mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Debbie rustled his hair snickering, “Oh come on. You are stuck as an 8 year old until this evening.  You know the medallion only works on an individual every 12 hours. May as well join the other kids. You always had a blast hunting for eggs when you were really this age.&quot;<br />
<br />
William waved his cell phone around complaining, &quot;Service here sucks. I can&#39;t even send a text to my girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Robert greeted his nephew, &quot;That&#39;s the downfall about living at such a secluded lake house.&quot; He jokingly picked up William to greet him with a hug. <br />
<br />
William was taken off guard. He was normally 6&#39;5 and weighed 250 pounds. It had been years since anybody could pick him up so easily. He sarcastically laughed at his Uncle, &quot;Ha ha! Very funny. Put me down please!&quot; <br />
<br />
Robert set his nephew on his feet asking, &quot;How&#39;s the family star basketball player doing? Have you gotten any scholarships to colleges next year?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he could answer, Lucas and John came running up. They obviously recognized their cousin in his younger form. They always loved when William visited so they could play basketball and have some great competition. <br />
<br />
Lucas threw the ball at William taunting his current height, &quot;Hey short stuff....Let&#39;s shoot some hoops! You gotta show me that famous slam dunk of yours.&quot; John joined in making fun of William&#39;s regressed age, &quot;It&#39;s going to be a breeze to block your jump shots now!&quot;<br />
<br />
William crossed his arms looking up at his much taller boy cousins, &quot;Yea right. I&#39;m not going to embarrass myself playing against you like this. We will have to wait until this evening when I can use the medallion again to get an equal sized body.&quot;</p>
