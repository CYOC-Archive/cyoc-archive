<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie looked at the five women and began to think. She had tested the ring successfully on her mom, herself and the girl at the mall, testing it on these women would be a little different. These women were older than anybody she had tested it on yet. She thought she could regress them all at once but was concerned it not being able to control the regression. It would be easier to change them one at a time so she could focus on the individual as they got younger. Glancing at the women she began to decide who would be the first.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise was still talking with Kellie telling her what brought her and her friends to the beach. It was a high school reunion for them they reminisced of their days partying on the beach. Mary Elise and the others  talked with longing of their youth. Katie listened intently and smiled, she would give them their youth but she would be careful. If she wasn&#39;t specific she could end up with a group of toddlers at the table. Katie giggled while it would be humorous to see these women reduced to preschoolers that would have to wait. For now she would make them the same age as Kellie and Mary Elise would be the first.<br />
<br />
Looking at Mary Elise Katie wondered what she looked like when she was younger. The peach colored sundress she wore was conservatively cut so as not to expose too much of her chest. Katie could see from what was exposed revealed a pair of large and droopy c cup breasts. Mary Elise&#39;s arms were flabby having long ago lost the muscle tone of her youth. Her face was wrinkled with deep lines around her mouth and her cheeks drooped slightly. Mary Elise&#39;s sundress covered her to the knees but revealed flabby legs covered with varicose veins. The tan beach sandals she wore covered most of her feet but Katie could see it worn and dull with age. While the dress was more suited for a woman in her 60&#39;s it would probably look quite stunning on a woman in her mid twenties. She hoped that once the regression was complete Mary Elise and Kellie would be friends.<br />
<br />
Katie had seen that the ring altered reality to fit people&#39;s new ages. Katie figured that if these women were the same age as Kellie they would close friends with Kellie. This would also give Katie a chance to later change their age&#39;s again making them her age or younger, the possibilities were endless. For now a 25 year old Mary Elise would do. Silently Katie wished Mary Elise to be 25 and sat back waiting for the changes to begin.<br />
<br />
The changes were subtle at first as Mary Elise reentered her 50&#39;s. The wrinkles around her mouth began to lessen and some muscle tone began to return to her arms and legs. What startled Katie was when auburn strands began to sprout in Mary Elise&#39;s gray hair. &quot;Didn&#39;t think she was a red head,&quot; Katie thought as Mary Elise left her 50&#39;s behind and reentered her 40&#39;s. The changes accelerated as Mary Elise retreated through her 40&#39;s. The auburn strands seemed to multiply overtaking the the gray. As Mary Elise reached 45 the auburn and gray were evenly divided throughout her head. Katie could also see that Mary Elise&#39;s hair was beginning to grow as it began to come loose from its bun. Mary Elise&#39;s skin was also beginning to regain its youthful luster as the wrinkles decreased even more.<br />
<br />
As Mary Elise went from 40 to 39 the changes really began to take hold. The varicose veins on her legs faded completely and muscle tone returned giving her very shapely legs.Her feet no longer looked dull and aged, the callous on her heels had faded leaving her feet smooth. Her breasts while still large began to firm up pushing the sundress out slightly. Katie hadn&#39;t noticed the ponch around her stomach and thighs earlier. As Mary Elise hit 35 she could see that the extra weight around her stomach and thighs was beginning to recede. Slowly but surely the dress was becoming loose around her midsection. Instead of making the dress seem awkward it added to Mary Elise&#39;s figure. Her large breasts  pushed out the top of the dress allowing the dress to flow freely around her waist.  <br />
<br />
When Mary Elise hit 29 Katie understood why the women had such fond memories of their youth. The last of the wrinkles around her eyes had faded leaving flawless ivory skin and gleaming sky blue eyes. Mary Elise&#39;s auburn hair had long ago lost any gray falling loose from its bun and cascading down her back in flowing curls. The muscle tone of her youth had returned revealing firm arms and legs. The weight around her waist vanished revealing a slim waist, firm thighs and perky backside. Finally her breasts continued to firm up and rise losing the sag and maintaining their size. Finally reaching 25 Katie was astounded at the red haired beauty before her.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise was now a 25  year old school teacher with auburn locks flowing to the middle of her back. The wide brimmed sunhat she wore protected her flawless alabaster skin from the  sun. Her firm legs and arms gave her an understated sexiness. Her waif-fish waist and firm c cup breasts accentuated her sundress that would make any schoolboy fantasize about her. Although a beauty she remained a kindly woman with a gentle soul who always had a kind word for her students. <br />
<br />
Katie was amazed at the transformation and couldn&#39;t wait to regress the other women. The ring was incredible and its power seemed limitless. Now she had to decide who would be the next one to be regressed. As Katie thought about who she began to think if maybe she should make one of the women her age. A decision needed to be made and Katie now felt she was ready to continue her adventure.</p>
