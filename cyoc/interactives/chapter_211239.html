<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh man, what the heck was that? Why do I sound like that? Sound like...that. I sound different. Like a...whoa. Whoa!&quot; <br />
<br />
David jerked awake. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad? Dad!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Dad? Where&#39;s MY Dad? Who are you calling Dad?&quot; Dave blinked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Still in dreamland? What are you, sucking dicks there, too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You watch your language, Tanner. Yes, I fell asleep and took a nap. God knows I work enough to deserve a nap. Where&#39;s your brother, did he get to piano practice okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, little Mr. Perfect got his piano lesson.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, if you found something to be passionate about like your brother, I&#39;d support it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to get laid. That&#39;s a passion.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You are way too much like me,&quot; Dave said wryly. &quot;Alright, get your brother ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave paused to look at himself, no...gawk at himself in his bathroom mirror. He owned this house now, he thought. I&#39;m 40 years old, I&#39;m a father, and my dad is now...my brother. Holy shit, look at me. <br />
<br />
The first thing Dave noticed was that he had no hair on top and a beard down below. His face had switched! He gingerly felt his head in excitement. Hell yes, I&#39;m so much of a man that I lost my hair and went bald. Awesome! He admired his medium length beard, bushy, dense and full. It made his dick hard, along with all his tattoos and muscle. His leather biker vest didn&#39;t leave much to the imagination. Perfect for showing off how alpha I fuckin&#39; am! he thought. <br />
<br />
It was exciting to be a man! he thought. I&#39;m really a grown up. I&#39;m bald and have big muscles and..and...<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a sexy voice, oh yes I do,&quot; Dave said, hearing the firmness and authority his voice now carried. <br />
<br />
Dave admired himself a little bit more. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have muscles!&quot; He felt his arms with wonder...feeling the hair growing profusely like bamboo all over his arms now. He thought he looked great with his arm fur but his husband Leo was always telling him to shave it. No way, he thought. I earned this arm hair!<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, are you jerking off to how hot you think you are?&quot; Tanner said sarcastically from outside the bathroom door. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, smartass. In the car.&quot; Dave glowered at his new son. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I drive?&quot; The boy wasn&#39;t older than 15. He was cute, too. He had the same look Dave had when he was a maturing boy. Enjoy your dun brown hair while you can, son. You&#39;re not gonna keep it long with my genes, he thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe on the way back,&quot; Dave told his son. He confidently backed out of the driveway. The Alpha male of his family pack. &quot;Behave yourself. No smart aleck crap from you. Say &#39;Yes, Sir&#39;, son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
They were just going on a run of the mill shopping run. Dave realized when he got to his giant truck, strapping himself into the driver&#39;s seat, that he had never driven before and that wasn&#39;t a problem. He had all the driving skills a 40 year old man should have. He was in complete control of the vehicle and he was superb at maneuvering. <br />
<br />
Not to mention I&#39;m a fucking stud with two sons to be proud of, not to mention a husband to die for. <br />
<br />
Things had changed. Dave remembered his grandparents were not his parents and he was raised in the 80s. He could remember Nickelodeon when they had on Pete and Pete, Roundhouse, and he used to go on hunting trails with Ken. Ken had been his father before, but now Ken was his brother. Ken had no children now. Now, he was a 32 year old stripper and bodybuilder who made lots of money being an up and coming muscle daddy stud, a man who could charge 300 bucks an hour just for being an escort. He was a security guard the rest of the time. His father and he were both gay now. <br />
<br />
He parked expertly in the Costco parking lot. He found that as a dad, he really appreciated a good value for bulk items. He loved Costco so much, and his boys, Tanner and Ethan loved it just as much. They were such a happy family. He had a husband and two boys from a surrogate mother. Dave had been the sperm donor, of course. Leon was his hot husband now. <br />
<br />
Why were they all gay? Dave blinked. Being gay was normal here. This was a world where 80% of men are totally gay and most women only had sex with men to procreate. Only 30% of women were gay which meant the 20% of heterosexual men got access to 70% of women who where heterosexual, meaning straight men often had three wives...or more. <br />
<br />
Gay men and women often talked about how promiscuous straight men were, and how much more likely they were to get diseases from God knows where. <br />
<br />
Dave smiled. He had a straight son and he was very proud of him. Tanner was getting pussy left and right and he was only 15 years old. Hetero boys often had no problems getting girlfriends willing to put out, even at the age of 13. Most boys reached full height at age 13 as well. All boys in this world were considered to be men at the age of 13 and were allowed in the work force. One often saw young teen boys with their childlike faces and tall adult bodies working as policemen, shop workers, drivers, construction workers, soldiers, firemen and various other professions. <br />
They matured facially at about the same rate, not getting to shave until they were 16 on average. 13 year olds in this world could legally smoke and drink as well. <br />
<br />
Tanner was taller than Dave now, which drove him a little bit crazy with jealousy over his son. Sure, he was a big man now. He was still only 5&#39;10&quot; whereas his own son towered above him at 6&#39;3&quot;. Kid didn&#39;t have a wisp of facial hair, though. His hair was a simple buzz cut. It made him look older, at Dave&#39;s insistence. His rule was, if you&#39;re a man, you&#39;re a man. Not a little boy. Little boys don&#39;t fuss or sass, they&#39;re responsible adults and they want to be just like Dad. <br />
<br />
Little Ethan was only 11 but he was already taller than his father. He was six feet tall and he was having an early puberty, it seemed. He was already able to jack off with a nine inch cock. He was the envy of most of the guys in grade 6. He had already lost his virginity and bragged about his sexual exploits all the time. <br />
<br />
Dave blinked. He felt funny. I need a cigarette, he thought. Holy smokes, I&#39;m only ten and I&#39;ve never smoked before. That machine must be merging the different timeline memories....whooooooaaaaaa...<br />
<br />
His head filled with memories. He remembered when he started riding his Harley at the age of 13, a man&#39;s height with a cigarette dangling out of his mouth. He remembered finding lots of horny older men who didn&#39;t mind taking orders from a much younger man as long as he knew how to be in charge. Hell, Dave knew how to be in charge from an early age, always bossing his younger brother around for his own good. That used to be dad, Ken, he thought. Now he&#39;s my little brother. Ken is my little bro, not my dad. He is my little brother. My hot submissive little brother. <br />
<br />
When they were in the parking lot, he let his son have the keys. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve earned it today by acting your mature age. I&#39;m letting you drive the truck. This is a big responsibility.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, I&#39;ve been driving for two years now. But thank you for letting me have this responsibility.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tanner drove them all home efficiently and smoothly without any problems. My giant sons, Dave thought wistfully. <br />
<br />
Finally, he thought, after everything had been put away. He went to the front porch and lit up a Camel cigarette. He posed there, watching the sunset until his partner Leon wrapped an arm around his waist. Leon was only 5&#39;7&quot; and the smaller man among them. He was ten years younger than Dave. 30 years old, his blond cubby husband. Well muscled but with a beer gut, clean shaven and with a buzz cut. A slightly chubby looking face, covered with blond stubble. <br />
<br />
He kissed his husband between puffs on his cigarette, helping himself to Leon&#39;s tongue, body, muscle tits, round butt. <br />
They made out for maybe 30 minutes. <br />
<br />
&quot;I better start dinner. Gotta feed all my boys,&quot; Leon said with a wink. <br />
<br />
Dave remembered his old life. He remembered Leon was different. He had been the school janitor and now he was here. Still a janitor, though. He worked at the same school as their son Ethan.<br />
<br />
Ethan had been power tripping since he shot up in height to 6 feet tall. He had been trying to push his beta father around. Soon, they would all have to have The Talk with Ethan about his obvious Alpha tendencies and how he would still have to bow down to his Alpha father. There would be a new pecking order soon. Ethan would be assuming the mantle of lesser alpha and accepting Alpha status once he fucked his beta father. Of course, that would totally be his decision as future Alpha if he even wanted that but judging from his behavior lately....<br />
<br />
Dave finished his cigarette and stubbed out in the ashtray. Life was good. Wonder if my boy Ethan is up for a cigar and a beer with his old man tonight...<br />
<br />
He suddenly remembered the Chronivac. Should he ever bother going back? He was a cigarette smoking stud now! He still hadn&#39;t even gone to work yet....and if I leave what happens to my sons? They probably don&#39;t exist in my other reality. I really want to go to work. But I also want to be bigger and more muscular. This universe has Alphas in charge and the bigger I am, the better!</p>
