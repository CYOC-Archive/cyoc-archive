<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They didn’t get to leave the resort as early as they had planned the next morning. Mainly because Alicia woke Henry by licking his new and exposed breasts. Alicia played with his dangling melons as Mister Marvellous ploughed into her inviting vulva. Afterwards they need to shower then dress. Alicia made Henry put on a sports bra, over which he wore a white tee-shirt of Alicia’s, his own being too tight across his breasts, then the loose-fitting jacket he had purchased particular for this purpose. Alicia assured him that the bra straps didn’t show. Henry wasn’t sure at all that the growths on his chest were so well hidden. <br />
<br />
The other thing they noticed was that with the chest swap Henry’s shoulders had narrowed while Alicia’s had expanded. Their arms were still their own.<br />
<br />
Alicia wore the large flesh coloured bra she had bought two days earlier, with the cups filled by of all things, some lingerie and the scarf she had been wearing on the day of the chest swap. It took longer than she had imagined to get the correct amount of stuffing. Once the floral shirt was on she was reasonably satisfied with the result. She was glad she had bought such a loose-fitting shirt, needing every bit of its size to fit her now wider shoulders.<br />
<br />
Both wore shorts and sneakers. Henry was not too concerned that his legs were now shaved. He had got used to having shaved legs yesterday. He also told himself that a lot of male athletes shaved their legs. <br />
<br />
Alicia went to breakfast but Henry pulled out at the last minute. He was sure that other people couldn’t help but notice he had breasts. Alicia returned with the lunch packs and a couple of bananas for Henry.<br />
<br />
They snuck out to the car. Henry waited until Alicia said the coast was clear before making a dash to the car. He couldn’t believe how much his breasts bounced as he ran. And to think he was wearing the sports bra which Alicia had recommended to minimise bounce.<br />
<br />
It was a 40-minute drive to the start of the walking trail. To Henry’s great relief they were not pulled over on the drive and there were no other vehicles in the small car-park. They set off on the walk after filling in a logbook at the entry gate. Evidently that was for would be rescuers to know how many people might be missing if they found cars still at the trail head at dusk. Alicia volunteered to wear the backpack for the first part of the journey &quot;So you can get the full experience of bouncing breasts&quot; <br />
<br />
Half an hour along the trail, at the point where the track separated to start the circuit to a distant hill, which Alicia told him was their destination, it became obvious to Henry that he was not dressed appropriately. It was hot and humid. He was sweating. He had his jacket on whereas Alicia was only wearing her long-sleeved cotton shirt and a wide brimmed straw hat. He figured as they were the only people who had put their names in the logbook for the day they were most likely on their own and it might be safe to remove the jacket. When they stopped at a picturesque first waterfall shortly afterwards. Henry removed the jacket and put it into the backpack, which was to be his responsibility to carry until the next stop. Henry was now exposed, wearing Alicia’s form fitting T-shirt. If they ran into someone else on the track there was no way he could hide that he now had sizeable breasts.<br />
<br />
And the breasts bounced. With every step he could feel them gently lifting up and down. The bra was also just a little tight and he could feel the straps rubbing on his shoulders. He had been sweating while he was wearing the jacket and now the bra felt damp. He was uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Alicia on the other hand was feeling quite comfortable. For the first time since she had been a kid her chest didn’t bounce as she walked. Although she apparently had breasts they didn’t actually weigh anything. <br />
<br />
An hour and a half into the journey they came to a beautiful pool under a small waterfall which Alicia remembered the brochure describing as an ‘idyllic swimming hole’ “Let’s stop here and rest” she suggested. Henry was only too happy to comply.<br />
<br />
They ate a snack bar each then Alicia said “I think we are on our own. I’m hot. Do you fancy a swim? I bought our bathers”<br />
“Well I do, it is so tempting, but what happens if someone comes?”<br />
<br />
“It’s unlikely but if we are caught just stay in the water with only your head out”<br />
<br />
Henry figured the chances of someone stumbling onto them was remote. ”Maybe we could go just a little way downstream, away from the track. Just in case”<br />
<br />
“This little pool is so nice. We could set up down the far end though. If we hear someone coming we could go behind those rocks”<br />
<br />
So, they went to the far end of the pool. Alicia stripped off her walking clothes and pulled her bikini bottom on “I’m going to go topless” she declared. “but you need to wear this. On the odd chance someone comes I don’t want you flashing my breasts around” She was holding something small and Henry quickly realised it was her bikini top.<br />
<br />
With Alicia’s help Henry was soon in his board shorts and her leopard print bikini top. The bikini top allowed a lot more jiggle than the sports bra had.<br />
<br />
Swimming was different. The breasts were another point of resistance. Feeling daring but at the same time keeping an ear out for approaching noises they swam back to the other end of the pool where the small waterfall and the walking track came together. For a few minutes Henry enjoyed standing beneath the gentle drop of water and letting it fall on his breasts. <br />
<br />
Later as they sat on the rocks in the sun near where they had changed. Alicia watched Henry play with the breasts on his chest. She observed he really was enjoying himself.<br />
<br />
However, all good things must end and once they had dried out they changed back into their hiking gear and continued along the trail. No one had disturbed their privacy. Henry’s jacket stayed in the backpack.<br />
<br />
It was a long walk but they did stop about every 40 minutes or so. Some of the uphill sections were a bit harder than Henry expected. He found himself puffing a lot. Were his lungs now slightly smaller? Did he now have Alicia’s internal organs along with the chest? Did he now have Alicia’s heart?<br />
<br />
They ate lunch at the top of a small mountain from which they had a beautiful view of the buildings of Honolulu and the sea behind. From this point on the majority of the remaining walk should be downhill and hopefully a bit easier. <br />
<br />
By the time they reached the point where the circuit finished and they were back on the last section of track leading back to the car-park, Henry was totally relaxed. He had become accustomed to the jiggling of his chest and found himself more appreciative of the shady rain-forest trial he was walking along. <br />
<br />
They rounded a bend and finally could see their car in the distance. They were nearly home, however Henry’s relief turned to panic when they could here male voices. The back pack was on Henry’s back “Quick get my jacket from the backpack” he whispered.<br />
<br />
“Too late” said Alicia. “Put these on” She passed him her sunglasses and as he puts them on he feels her slap her hat on his head. Just at that moment a couple of 20 ish men come around the corner. Henry pretended to be looking at a shrub beside the track, not wanting to make eye contact with the strangers.<br />
<br />
He hears a “Hello ladies” and a “Hi” as the men walk past. Alicia responds with “Hi there”. The footsteps move on past them and when they finally fade Henry can finally breathe.<br />
<br />
“Have they gone?” he whispers.<br />
<br />
“Yes. They have gone” she giggles “They were totally checking you out. It was rude of you not to answer” Henry looks at her. She is smiling and he realises she is just teasing. “Good thing you had a shave this morning”<br />
<br />
“I think my heart stopped for a second there. If they had stopped for a chat I would have died”<br />
<br />
“Why? Big deal if they saw you. What does it matter? They don’t know you. Does it matter if they realised you were a man with breasts?”<br />
<br />
Henry was silent. He kept Alicia’s hat and sunglasses on for the remainder of the walk, just in case there were other hikers. He pondered what Alicia had just said. She was right. What does it matter if two strange people, who he would never likely meet again, saw that he was a man with breasts? It would be different if he was at work or even in his home city where he might be recognised but he was half way around the world. The chances of meeting anyone he knew were tiny. What was he worried about?<br />
<br />
There was only one other car in the car-park. No doubt it belonged to the two men. They got into their own car, with Henry assuming the driver’s seat. “Are you going to put your jacket back on?” Alicia asked. <br />
<br />
“No actually” Henry surprised her “I’m hot and tired and you were right. It doesn’t matter if people see me as a man with boobs. I don’t know them and they don’t know me. I’m going stay as I am” he fastened the seat-belt. Adjusting it so his breasts were comfortable. “I’ve got magnificent breasts and I’m not going to hide them”</p>
