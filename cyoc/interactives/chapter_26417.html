<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter and Allen were hanging out at Ty and Dustin’s house, while the guys were just relaxing and watching TV. They were watching some kind of nature program on the Discovery channel, just because there was nothing else on at that time of the day.<br />
<br />
“Man, I’m bored… Holidays are great, but you just sit at home with absolutely nothing to do…” Dustin mumbled, as he rested his back against the back of his sofa. He was almost ready to doze off.<br />
<br />
Allen was just as bored, and Peter was just staring at the ceiling, not paying any attention to the TV set at all.<br />
<br />
“What time does the football game start?” Allen wondered, as he flipped through the pages of the TV programming section, which was included in the thick, Sunday-Edition of the daily newspaper. “We got cable and all these channels that I’m paying for, and yet, there isn’t a thing on TV!”<br />
<br />
Just at that moment, the announcer of the TV program was talking about turtles. He showed how turtles looked, when they retracted their legs and arms. They just lay there, without any limbs sticking out, as they used their shell as their shelter.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm… That is interesting… He looks like he doesn’t have his arms and legs!” Ty pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Imagine if his arms came back as his legs, and his legs came back at the spot, where his arms were supposed to be…” Dustin remarked.<br />
<br />
This remark suddenly gave Allen an idea.<br />
<br />
“I wonder what that would look like…” he said as he stared at Peter.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… I wanna try that…” Peter chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Go and lie down on the floor, dude…” Allen instructed Peter.<br />
<br />
Peter sat down on the carpet, before he rested his back on the floor. Then, he finally set his head down as well, and he closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Change me, Allen…” Peter grinned. “Let me feel what it is like to have the limbs reversed!”<br />
<br />
“Oooh boy…” Dustin rolled his eyes. “I knew Allen would try it out!”<br />
<br />
“You gotta make his limbs pull inward, first!” Ty said, as he helped out Allen while Allen tried to concentrate on Peter’s body.<br />
<br />
Slowly but surely, Peter’s arms appeared to shrink in length, as they pulled inside of his shoulders. His biceps disappeared, and then his elbows, and finally his hands and fingers were drawn inside of him. Then, the spot where his arms used to be had neatly closed up, showing just a patch of skin on either side of Peter’s chest. His arms were completely gone!<br />
<br />
“Now, his legs…” Ty said to him.<br />
<br />
Peter’s quads were slowly pushing inward, into his waist. As the quads were pulled in, his legs were slowly being absorbed by his body. The heels of his feet dragged over the carpet, as Allen’s power caused Peter’s legs to disappear inside of his torso.<br />
<br />
After a few moments, Peter’s knees had been absorbed, and now his calves were being pulled inward. Finally, his ankles, his feet, and then his toes disappeared inside of him, and his waist now closed up and a firm patch of hairless skin was remaining. <br />
<br />
“Oh my God! I lost all of my limbs!” Peter exclaimed, as he raised his head up. He lay there helplessly, and was not able to move or to stand up, because his arms and his legs were gone! “I can’t walk or do anything!”<br />
<br />
“Wait a sec, dude… I’ll fix that!” Allen chuckled, as he looked down at his helpless buddy. He loved to change Peter, and he didn’t hold back any new idea for a transformation, that he wanted to try out. “I’ll grow your muscles after I’m done!”<br />
<br />
Then, toes started sticking out from Peter’s shoulders! Next, came the heels and the ankles, followed by the calves and the knees! Peter just stared to either side, of where his head was, as he watched his legs as they reappeared, but they were growing from his shoulders and they were passing his head. <br />
<br />
Finally, the long, muscular quads appeared, finalizing his long legs. But, the legs had grown from his shoulders!<br />
<br />
“Now, the finale: The arms!” Allen laughed, as he directed his powers at Peter’s waist.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, fingers came out from either side of his waist, where his legs used to be. Then came the rest of his hands, followed by his wrists. As the arms were being pulled out further, everyone could see that Allen had determined that Peter’s arms would grow from the place, where his legs used to be. Allen had flipped his limbs around!<br />
<br />
Finally, the rest of his arms had come out, and he was able to move his hands and arms again. The only thing was that his head was closest to his legs, and his arms were attached to his waist!<br />
<br />
“Try to get on your feet, dude! Let’s see what you look like!” Allen chuckled.<br />
<br />
Peter placed his legs, which were on either side of his head, on the floor. Then, using his arms, he reached over and grabbed the edge of the couch, so he could pull himself up.<br />
<br />
Slowly he was able to stand up, but his head was hanging upside down from his torso, which appeared to be upside-down!<br />
<br />
“Whoa… Why am I seeing everything upside-down?” Peter wondered, as he turned to see his legs. His arms moved around and tried to touch his face, but couldn’t! Peter had to look up, in order to see his arms and hands! His limbs were reversed!<br />
<br />
“Wow… This is weird!”<br />
<br />
He then took a step… Since his head was upside down, and pointing to the floor, he was able to “watch” his legs as he walked. When he turned to either side, with his head, he saw his knees and his quads!<br />
<br />
“Oooh… I need to get used to this!” he chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… Going to the bathroom should be fun!” Ty pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Awesome! I’m keeping you like that for the rest of the day!” Allen laughed, as he watched Peter’s flipped-around body.<br />
<br />
“Well… I need to get used to seeing things upside down…” Peter said, as he walked around the room. His orientation was off, because his legs were right, but his head was upside down. <br />
<br />
Peter had to sit on his waist, with his arms touching the coach, and his legs sticking up in the air. Since his limbs were now reversed, he looked really strange, sitting on the couch!<br />
<br />
He had to use his arms to grab and lift some chips, and then he had to move his hands up, so that he can put the chips in his mouth. Since his arms were now farther away from his head, he had to bend his head down, so that his hands could reach.<br />
<br />
“So, do you think you can manage?” Allen asked him.<br />
<br />
“You might want to make his arms a little longer” Ty suggested to his best friend, who could control Peter’s body.<br />
<br />
“Okay!” Allen cheered. He would never pass on another opportunity to change Peter.<br />
<br />
Peter felt his arms growing a few inches longer, so that now it was easier to reach his head. His arms were down below, coming from the sides of his waist. He had no legs there, so he would just be sitting on his waist. Instead, his legs were sticking straight up and out from above his shoulders, and his knees were allowing his legs to point backward and rest against the edge of his couch. Peter was actually sitting on his arms, and he was looking sideways at his legs, that were upside-down.<br />
<br />
Ty and Dustin just laughed, as they stared at their silly cousin and best friend. What would Allen do to him, next? Luckily, they knew that Allen really liked Peter a lot, and he could never hurt him. But Ty had to admit, that Allen was very creative, in determining what he was going to change next about Peter.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I forgot to fulfill the promise…” Allen said, as he turned to look at Peter.<br />
<br />
This time, Peter’s pectorals expanded a little, pushing his shoulders out farther. Then, his biceps increased in size, as well as his calves and quads, which were sticking out over and above Peter’s head. This time, whenever Allen made his quads and calves bigger, Peter could watch as those muscles grew up close.<br />
<br />
What would Allen try next?</p>
