<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a few months Ty and Dustin were in their home gym. Ty was 9&#39;4 and 600 pounds and Dustin was 5&#39;4 and 120. He was much smaller than average kid in his age, but not as small as he was.<br />
&quot;Ty,  why I stopped groing? I&#39;m doing good things every day, but I don&#39;t feel that your magic is working&quot; <br />
&quot;The answer is simple, you keeping doing same good things but you have to do something new. You cannot expect that wishing good things to your family every day will help you to reach 7&#39;3. Use your mind&quot;<br />
&quot;I think you are right, brother. Thanks a lot for advice&quot; Dustin felt warm, but he didn&#39;t grow even a tenth of an inch. They finished workout and after a shower Dustin decided to walk the streets. Ty was preparing to his first bodybuilding competition and stayed at home.<br />
Dustin didn&#39;t have friends, because he was much smaller than kids his age, so he walked alone. But this time, when he passed the street gang, a kid, 6&#39;5 tall : &quot;Hey, dwarf, you are not allowed here.&quot; Dustin didn&#39;t pay attention and went forward. Another teen blocked him.<br />
&quot;What do you think you are doing?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to the park&quot;<br />
&quot;Park? That is our street. You have to find another path&quot;<br />
&quot;And, what will happen if I won&#39;t?&quot;<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t want to know&quot;<br />
And than he tried to punch Dustin, but he dodged. Than Dustin ran away and the guys were chasing him. He was running for a while, but than the gang caught him.<br />
&quot;We caught a dwarf&quot;<br />
&quot;And he is trying to be cool. You should have not run, little guy&quot;<br />
The biggest one kicked him. And Dustin fell on the ground.<br />
&quot;Stop it! He is not yours toy!&quot; Someone shouted. Dustin could not see who.<br />
&quot;Leave him!&quot;<br />
Dustin, still lying on the ground, felt how he is becoming warmer and he started to grow. When he standed up he was about 5&#39;8.<br />
&quot;It is dangerous to be so small I think&quot; told him Ty. He knew that it was happening to Dustin and helped him at the last moment. &quot;You were brave and I like it.&quot;<br />
Than they&#39;ve returned home.<br />
&quot;Where were you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Dad, it&#39;s nothing, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m home.&quot;<br />
&quot;Dustin, what were you thinking? What if Ty wouldn&#39;t be there. I was worried.&quot;<br />
&quot;Dustin was doing fine. And it is not a big deal&quot;<br />
&quot;It is a big deal. What if something happened to him&quot;<br />
&quot;He was brave, he did not cry&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m talking to your brother, Tyler!&quot;<br />
&quot;Dustin you are not allowed to leave the house alone from now.&quot;<br />
***Same evening in the gym.***<br />
&quot;Ty, what should I do? I cannot do good things when I grounded&quot;<br />
Ty finished his posing exercises and replied: &quot;So, you are better to focus on your muscles. As I said, they do not depends on your kindness, only your effort&quot;<br />
&quot;I guess it is only choice I have&quot;<br />
Next month Ty left the house to participate in a contest. He took 4th place and was so upset. He created a world of real muscle freaks, who made him felt mediocre. They were 17 years old too, but they were heavier and taller than him and much better developed. <br />
These situations made Ty and Dustin work together in the gym. Ty was worried that without his magic he is nothing and he started to learn how to build his body without his power. They eat together, they workout together and Dustin was the one who was leading their tandem. And one day (after 6 months) he found himself 6&#39;4 and 320 pounds.<br />
&quot;Ty, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m becoming too muscular. I feel like I&#39;m a real weightlifter&quot;<br />
&quot;No, you are not. It is the point. You may be forgot but it is our new normality. Look at me&quot;<br />
Ty was standing near him. He was still 9&#39;4 but his weight was about 650. His muscles were thicker, fullier and more defined. <br />
&quot;You are much bigger than me,  so I didn&#39;t notice any change but you are right&quot; Dustin said.<br />
&quot;And didn&#39;t you notice, that your classmates became more kind to you. You looks like them now. So you are absolutely OK. I will talk to mom and dad to allow you to leave the house somewhere but school&quot; finished Ty.<br />
Next day evening Dustin left home after the dinner. He was planning to run to the park because he needed cardio. When he ran near the place he had met a gang of bullies he heard that someone is crying like a baby. He run a little faster and he found a dog who was lying on the ground and three guys were kicking him.<br />
&quot;Please, stop it! You will kill him!&quot; Dustin shouted and tried to protect a dog with his body.<br />
&quot;Oh, look, the dwarf has become a hero. I will give him a medal. Come over&quot; said the biggest.<br />
But now their sizes were comparable and Dustin kicked him and hit the other guy. He was fighting for about 10 minutes and won. During the fight with every hit he felt that he became more and more taller. When boys were running from him he was 6&#39;6 and about 360 pounds of muscle.<br />
&quot;Dog, are you okay?&quot; Dustin asked the dog. But the animal didn&#39;t move. He was bleeding. And his paws were broken.<br />
Dustin didn&#39;t think much, he carried a dog on his shoulders and runned back to the house. He was thinking: &quot;Ty will hel, I can save him. He can heal.&quot;<br />
When he came back his parents and Ty were watching the TV.<br />
&quot;Hey, where were you?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
&quot;Dad, don&#39;t. Help me. Dog, he needs help. Can you take him to Ty&#39;s room? Ty, heal him please!&quot;<br />
&quot;What? How did you get a dog?&quot;<br />
&quot;There were three guys. They beat him. Please help him, Ty!&quot;<br />
&quot;OK, I will try. But I&#39;m not sure.&quot;<br />
Than Mark and June helped to bring a dog.<br />
Ty made a wish and dog stopped bleeding and starts to enhale and exhale softer.<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; Dustin hugged his brother. &quot;He is safe. Thank you, thank you.&quot;<br />
Now Dustin was about 6&#39;8 and his muscles were smaller, because his weight wasn&#39;t effected.<br />
&quot;Now, please, let&#39;s wash him, we will put him on my bed. And we will check him tomorrow.&quot;</p>
