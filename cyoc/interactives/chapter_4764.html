<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan stared at Ian excitedly to see if anything would start to happen. Ian scratched his head a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I shoudn't have drunk all that Coke before I walked over here,&quot; Ian chuckled at himself, and Dan joined in a little. Dan was a little confused. Ian's laugh sounded different than usual. It almost sounded like a goat's... bleat?<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it gettin' a lil' hot in here, or is it just me?&quot; asked Ian. Dan got up from the bed and turned on the window fan. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that feels so good,&quot; Ian smiled. Dan smiled as well. It was a little weird, the way Ian was acting, but for some reason Dan enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
Ian stared at the computer screen again for a few minutes, reading yet another e-mail (one of his girlfriends asking about a date at her house that Saturday night). He then turned to look at Dan again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you're quiet today. What's up? Why are you squinting like that? Is there something wrong your eyes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ian, did you forget to shave this morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I actually didn't even need start shaving until a few weeks ago. Sometimes, I even skip a few days. It's not like I'm gonna grow a full beard in 2 hours or somethin'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe you should start to do it at least twice a day,&quot; Dan replied.<br />
<br />
Ian stroked his chin, and noticed that there was a lot of rough stubble. He'd never felt that before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, maybe you're right,&quot; and he started that bleatish chuckle again. Every time he let out a giggle, the facial hair grew a little longer. Dan's eyes widened, and his jaw droppped.<br />
<br />
Ian felt his chin again, and noticed the new goatee that had sprouted from it. It was jet-black, matching the dark hair on Ian's head, naturally. Ian gasped at first, but before he could scream, the expression on his face changed from fear to one that more like it was in a sort of deep thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what? For some reason, I feel as though I was born to have a goatee anyway. Who needs shaving?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan's eyes opened even wider, and then he realized what was going on. Ian's weird way of behaving, the facial hair; it all made sense, he was becoming a satyr! Dan was jumping for joy on the inside, but tried to keep his cool. <br />
<br />
Ian stroked his new goatee proudly for a few seconds. Then he spoke again. &quot;I'm starting to feel a little weird again. It's like something's trying to poke out of my-BAAA!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Ian bleated, the back of his pants ripped. He got up out of the computer chair, and took a look at his behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;HOLY SHIT! I'VE GOT A TAIL! A STUBBY LITTLE TAIL!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan didn't say anything. He didn't even let Ian know that his ears had become pointy. He was just sitting on the bed, enjoying watching his friend transform. He was still smiling.<br />
<br />
Ian bent over and put his hands on his head. It looked like he was having a really bad migraine. When Ian took his hands off, Dan saw that they had been hiding two small horns.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?&quot; Ian ran out of Dan's bedroom and headed for the bathroom. Dan followed him.<br />
<br />
When Ian looked into the bathroom mirror, he was speechless. His horns now looked like they belonged to a ram (just the way Dan liked them). Dan finally decided to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might as well take your clothes off, you'll have to sooner or later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you crazy? I'm not gonna-&quot; before Ian could say another word, everything but the chain around his neck chain vanished from his body (Dan found chains sexy). Ian looked into the mirror again. Dan looked at him in awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, maybe those push-ups really work after all.&quot; Ian grinned.<br />
<br />
Ian had always been physically fit, but now he had a nice six-pack. Muscles rippled all over his body perfectly. He didn't look like a steroid freak, but it sure looked like he'd spent years working out at the gym. Then he looked down at his new member.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! Look at my schlong!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan had always pictured satyrs with a foreskin, but he didn't have to give one to Ian, he already had one. What had changed about Ian's schlong was the size. He'd always been well hung, but now it was at least 8 and-a-half-inches, and he wasn't even hard... yet.<br />
<br />
Ian groaned. The hair on his legs grew and turned into more of a fur-like substance. His feet morphed into hooves. He was a complete satyr.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, I'm hot!&quot; Ian yelled. His dick started to get hard. Dan was in ecstacy. Ian was so beautiful now. But then Dan remembered something. How would he explain this to Ian's family? How could Ian even be shown in public like this? He decided to change Ian  back... but only temporarily.<br />
<br />
Within seconds, Ian was his normal self again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what just happened? Why am I naked?&quot; Ian had forgotten his changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll explain everything tomorrow. Meet me by the woods before school tomorrow morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummmmm, ok. But still, where are my clothes?&quot; Ian's clothes immediately appeared behind him. He changed into his clothes, and then headed for home. He was still feeling a little light-headed.<br />
<br />
Dan couldn't wait for the next day. He thought of all the fun he'd have at school from now on. Even better, he and Ian went to an all boys school.</p>
