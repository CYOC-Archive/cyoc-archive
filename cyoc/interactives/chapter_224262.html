<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Making her way to the bowling alley proved far easier than Diana thought. After reviewing the file, she learns that the Normal had been tracking this Catalyst for quite sometime. &quot;Lima 1-16 to control,&quot; Diana stated, her voice roboticly monotone in its delivery. &quot;Go ahead Lima 1-16,&quot; a voice crackled over the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrived at target location proceeding with scan,&quot; Diana now withdrew a small device from her bag, noting the small drone that now activated. A beam of light now walked over the area, giving Diana virtual blueprint of the Bowling Alley. Carefully she now studied the virtual model, noting the live action virtual models of the people within. What could be considered a smile now cracked across her face as she noticed one figure immediate illuminated.  &quot;Control Catalyst identified.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats a copy Lima 1-16,&quot; Control replied. As instructions were now given, Diana studied the Catalyst carefully. The nee technologies that the Normal had access to recently was truely impressive, decades ahead of anything the teenager had ever seen. Rumors stated that the technology they now used had been constructed by a goblin under the Bosses control but that didn&#39;t seem right. Why would the Normal associate with something so...UnNormal? <br />
<br />
Studying the Catalysts highlighted icon, Diana now noted five other individuals congregating with him. Diana assumed these were the Catalysts friends, for the most part she could see that they appeared normal. What concerned her though were two of the figures that now glowed red. &quot;Control be advised,&quot; Diana stated. &quot;We have two possible Alpha level threats in proximity to the Catalyst. Shall I proceed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are to proceed with the mission Lima 1-16,&quot; Control replied. &quot;Charlie group is being dispatched to your location and will rendezvous.&quot; Diana acknowledged, her face remaining expressionless despite her surprise. Charlie was one of the Normals more skilled combat units. If control was dispatching them to rendezvous than they must expect trouble. As she entered the building, Diana now surveyed the area trying to locate the Catalyst.<br />
<br />
Diana honestly did enjoy bowling, it was a very plain, very normal activity. Often times she would go, choosing to score the game by hand as opposed to the flashy computer generated images bowling alleys choose now a days. Diana couldn&#39;t stand how bowling alleys, in trying to appeal to the masses, instituted Rock n Bowl or Neon, flashy, lights. Sometimes the muted tones were just...more normal and better.<br />
<br />
Spotting the Catalyst, Diana now sat back waiting for an opportunity. Standing off to the side, she now seamlessly blended in with the crowd. To the untrained eye, Diana was simply a background character, a non descript face, non descript outfit, even if someone studied her carefully they would have a hard time describing her. This is what made Normal agents so dangerous. You would never be able to identify them. All she needed to do now was wait.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for Diana to get her opportunity. Eventually Darren needed to use the bathroom. Watching the teen carefully, she now saw him enter the bathroom. Slowly she now followed, waiting for him to exit before she made her move. Five minutes later, she now found herself standing face to face with the Catalyst. &quot;Is your name Darren McKenna?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren paused, so far the group date had gone surprisingly well. For the first time since the Normal altered time he was enjoying himself. It just amazed him that his first good time in months would be with Gail Wright. Now, staring at this odd girl in fron of him, he tried to remember who she was. &quot;Um yeah,&quot; he said on confusion. &quot;Do we know eachother from school?&quot;<br />
<br />
Diana said nothing, simply pressing a button on her phone as a small needle ejected from her phone. As it hit Darren in the neck, the teen winced, confused by what happened. As he tried to speak, he found his voice falter, his body growing numb before he collapsed to the ground unable to move. &quot;Neurotoxin,&quot; Diana stated in her monotone voice. &quot;Complete paralyzed of the body. You should still be able to see me though.&quot; Leaning forward, she now looked into Darren&#39;s eyes, noting his confusion and anger. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re wondering whats going on,&quot; she said. &quot;I won&#39;t bore you with the details, the Normal have targeted you for re-education. I&#39;ve been tasked with bringing you in. I understand you may not want to but its foe the best.&quot; Although Darren couldn&#39;t move, inside he was screaming in rage. He knee what this meant, the Boss was going to kill him or worse strip him of his free will and use him to destroy his friends and the future. Diana now grabbed his arm, dragging him out a side entrance like a lion would an antelope. As the cold night air hit him, Darren now noticed a large group of Normal soldiers now approached from the darkness. &quot;Charlie squad,&quot; Diana asked.<br />
<br />
Darren could see the soldiers nod, a quick conversation breaking out between Diana and the squad. The toxin was potent but he needed to find away out of this. If he couldn&#39;t than everything he had done would be for nothing. As the teens eyes began to glow a brilliant white he now tried to summon the strength to break free.<br />
<br />
Diana and the team paused as they heard Darren scream. Turning the teenage girl now raised an eyebrow. &quot;Thats peculiar,&quot; she whispered. &quot;The neurotoxin should have paralyzed him for hours.&quot; Dimly staring at the teenage Catalyst she could see a faint white glow surrounding him as his eyes glowed. Diana sighed, this Catalyst was proving to be slightly annoying. As she readied another dose of toxin, she was caught off guard. Someone had thrown a drink at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darren?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren paused, turning as Gail and the others now spilled out side entrance. &quot;Gail,&quot; he asked. &quot;How did you find me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know it was weird,&quot; she said. &quot;We all kind if heard you call for help.&quot; Darren smiled, realizing that Yuriko&#39;s lessons in psionics had finally paid off. On his desperation he had called for help useing telepathy. Now, he could see the Normal soldiers assuming a defensive stance as the others scanned the area.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are these guys,&quot; Miles exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Normal,&quot; Darren replied as he now conjured forth the Dragons Tongue. As he did Travis now furrowed his brow, his cloak of living shadows surrounding him. &quot;Miles, Chenoa,&quot; he said. &quot;Protect the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We do this together,&quot; Chenoa stated, the Deer girls legs transforming from human to deer as she now stomped the ground. &quot;No one shall hurt our friends or interrupt date night!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the teens stared down the Normal, Diana proceeded towards the back. She was no fighter, she would let the soldiers do their job. Already though she was not looking forward to the paperwork this little incident would involve.</p>
