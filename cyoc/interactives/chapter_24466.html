<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul knew the area well since he grew up there. He got to his house around midnight and sat on the front lawn wondering what his family would say to him looking like he did with donkey ears and a tail and a 15 inch dick going down his pants. His face was covered in fur and had begun to take the shape of a donkey muzzle. He snuck inside and went to his bedroom. On his way he saw some papers in the printer. They were LOST posters. It hit him that he had been gone for 2 days. Once he got into his room, he took off his clothes and looked in the mirror. His balls were hanging a few inches. He put his hand there to make sure it was real and let out an uncontrollable bray. He quickly put his hands to his mouth and could see his dick starting to get hard. He sat on his bed and brayed again because he sat on his tail. He put some clothes on, not that it helped, and laid down on his bed. <br />
<br />
He was staring at his dick and figured &quot;What the hell? It's not like I'm still on the island.&quot; He began to jack off and it felt better than any other time. After a minute, hundreds of images of naked men flooded into his mind. Each man was slowly turning into a donkey and it made his dick grow to 20 inches. He stopped and was wondering why he was thinking of naked men becoming donkeys. &quot;I'm not gay,&quot; he said to himself several times. When he thought about not being gay, he remembered that last week he invited his friend Andy over to hang out tomorrow. Andy was gay but had never tried to get close to Paul. He was now worried that something would happen that he would regret later.<br />
The sun came up and woke Paul as the sunlight bled through his curtains. He peeked his head out of his door and his mom shouted, &quot;Breakfast!&quot; He went into his room and looked in the mirror. His dick wasn't noticeable and he put a beanie on to cover his ears and tucked his tail into his pant leg. The fur on his body had receded. He went to the kitchen hoping no one would notice his changes. His dad was sitting at the table and his mom was making pancakes on the stove. He sat down and his dad said, &quot;So, where have you been for two days?&quot; Paul lied, &quot;I was riding my bike and got lost in the city.&quot; His dad replied, &quot;Ok,&quot; in a way that Paul knew he didn't buy it.<br />
<br />
After breakfast, Paul went to his room and got dressed to be ready when Andy came over. Around 1, Andy arrived and Paul took him to his room. They decided to play video games and Paul had even forgotten about his donkey parts until Andy saw a bulge going down Paul's leg. He said, &quot;Paul, what's that on your leg?&quot; Andy squeezed it and Paul let out a loud bray. Paul's parents weren't home but Andy definitely heard it. Andy backed away and looked at Paul like he was some kind of freak. Paul said, &quot;Andy, let me explain.&quot; Andy slowly sat down on the floor, eager to hear what Paul was going to say. Andy had been Paul's best friend since kindergarten so Paul felt he could tell him. Paul continued, &quot;Two days ago, I went someplace and something horrible happened.&quot; He slowly pulled the beanie off of his head and revealed his ears. Andy's face was fixated on his ears as Paul turned around and pulled his pants down, now showing his tail through a hole in his boxers and touching the floor swaying back and forth. Paul then turned around again and pulled his boxers off, this time exposing his donkey penis, as it quickly dropped 20 inches to the floor. Paul could now see that this was getting Andy horny as he got a boner as soon as Paul's dick was shown. Again, the images of naked men flooded into Paul's mind and he moved over to Andy who didn't move at all. Paul explained that he went to Pleasure Island and was starting to become a donkey but escaped. Andy watched Paul's dick harden and he began to unbuckle his belt and pulled off his boxers, showing Paul his 7 inch boner. Paul grabbed Andy's shirt off and looked at his amazing body. He knew Andy went to the gym but didn't know how ripped he was. Paul took off his own shirt and pulled Andy closer they began to make out. Andy grabbed Paul's dick and began to stroke it, slowly at first and getting faster and faster. Paul felt fur growing on his chest but didn't care. He wanted to satisfy his urge to fuck his best friend. As Paul was reaching his orgasm, Andy stopped and laid down on Paul's bed and gestured for Paul to get on top of him. He did so and Andy pulled Paul's dick into his mouth as Paul put Andy's dick up his ass. Paul moved up and down as Andy thrusted Paul's monstrous dick in and out of his mouth. Paul released the biggest orgasm he had ever had in Andy's mouth and Andy swallowed it all. A few seconds later, Andy's dick exploded with cum up Paul's ass. Paul's arms began to grow fur very quickly as his face did also. Andy just laid there with a smile but didn't know that his ears were now growing and sprouting fur. They grew to a foot long and Paul saw them and brayed loudly. Paul moved off of the bed and was forced on all fours. The fur spread to his legs and then everything stopped. Andy got up and could see his ears in the mirror and screamed. Just then, he grew a tail of his own. It came out quickly and Andy turned his head. Paul came over and picked up Andy's tail and saw that Andy's dick was growing as were his balls. His dick became 18 inches long and his balls grew to the size of golf balls. Andy's new asinine penis harden as he was ready for another round. This time, Paul sucked Andy's dick and Andy stroked Paul's tail which made Paul's dick harden also. Andy cummed into Paul's mouth as Andy's body sprouted fur everywhere. The boys then noticed a sheath forming around their dicks and connecting to their stomachs. Their faces expanded into donkey muzzles and hands and feet turned into hooves. They thought it would be the end of their beginning. They left the house and wandered onto a farm where they fucked all day.<br />
<br />
One day, a boy came walking by and saw the donkeys ass-fucking and threw a rock at one. He came over to the boy and bit him. The boy felt a tingle in his whole body. What happens to him next?</p>
