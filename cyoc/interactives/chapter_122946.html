<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Standing outside of the school, Nate watches as a familiar Shelby Cobra races towards the parking lot. Seeing it drift as it pulls into the lot; Nate cringes as the car nearly hits a redheaded girl as she made a last second leap to get out of the way. The redheaded girl glares at the driver and summarily flips them the bird as she shouts out her indignation. Nate shakes his head as he walks towards the classic car; opening the passenger door as he gets in, tossing his school bag in the spot between the two seats.<br />
<br />
“You nearly hit that girl,” Nate commenting as the driver rips out of the parking lot like a bat out of hell.<br />
Jean doesn’t answer as she works the stick shift; putting the car into second gear. Jean was thinking about what happened earlier as she was having a break between classes at Moon Lake College. Noticing Nate’s cell phone in her car after it started ringing. Picking it up and answering; Jean’s demeanor soured when the person who called was none other than Kenya, Nate’s ex-girlfriend.<br />
<br />
“Jean are you listening,” Nate trying to push himself farther back into the seat; his voice raised as he looks scared at her erratic driving. “Slow down!”<br />
<br />
“Kenya called,” Jean stopping the car at the side of the road; tossing Nate his cell phone after grabbing it from her purse.<br />
“What the hell did she want,” Nate grabbing the phone; checking to see if he missed any calls stemming from his landscaping business.<br />
“She wanted to hook up,” Jean growling; “apparently her husband was arrested this morning.”<br />
“And she felt that was cause to call me,” Nate frowning as he had a message to mow a lawn; “after I told her to never contact me again?”<br />
“Have you been in contact with her,” Jean looking directly at Nate; her face showing no hint of emotion as she waited for Nate’s answer.<br />
“Hell no,” Nate putting his phone away; “why would I after she strung me along and I found out she was still seeing clients? Besides,” Nate staring back at her; “you had my phone today and I’m certain you were looking to see if there was any call history between us.”<br />
<br />
Jean thought about that for the moment before sighing; knowing that Nate was correct, she did out of curiosity look through his phones call history. Seeing that the break up text he sent to Kenya last December was the last he ever contacted the were-panthress.<br />
“I’m sorry,” Jean’s expression softening; “I just had to be sure. Plus I’m a little upset. I called Liv today,” Jean putting the Shelby Cobra back into gear and driving towards Nate’s place; “I was hoping she would be willing to come over to have a little girl on girl fun but she can’t make it to Moon Lake for a few weeks.”<br />
“Ah,” Nate responding; “because I can’t shift for a few more days after getting attacked last Monday.”<br />
“Exactly,” Jean sighing; “so know this, when you can shift my brown furred werewolf, expect to be rutted raw and hard. Because I’m not going to stop until I am fully satisfied,” Jean leering at Nate as she arrives at Nate’s house; “and I do mean fully.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“Frieda,” Benton watching the Shelby Cobra peel out of the school parking lot after it arrived; “you better not drive like a crazed lunatic when you get your driver’s licensed.”<br />
“Frieda doesn’t need to,” Spencer grinning; “she’s got me for that.”<br />
“And where is your,” Benton looking at Spencer through the rearview mirror as he tried to form the word; “truck?”<br />
“Getting fixed after I used it as a battering ram,” Spencer responding; “I saw a couple of sketchy suits attacking Eric’s older brother and Jean chasing them towards their car.”<br />
“And she used her Bronco,” Frieda chiming in; “to prevent them from getting away.”<br />
“When did this happen,” Benton pulling out of the school parking lot.<br />
“Monday evening,” Spencer answering; “I was just about to drop Eric off after spending the day at the Labor Day picnic.”<br />
“So where is it getting fixed,” Benton absently answering; “and how much is it going to cost?”<br />
“My truck is getting repaired at Talbot Restoration,” Spencer answering; “and it’s costing me nothing. Nate is dating Jean Talbot; the were-lion king’s daughter.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“You crazy Bitch! You nearly hit me,” the red headed girl shouted as she leapt out of the way. Watching as Nate got into the car that nearly hit her; she whimpers as her love drives off with the person who she feels is unfit to be Nate’s lover.<br />
“When this were-alert is over,” the girl fuming; “you’ll soon realize that I’m the one for you Nate Anderson. Not some were-lioness that puts on airs because she is royalty.”<br />
<br />
“Zelyna!”<br />
Zelyna turns around to see both Alex and Ben walking out of the school. Knowing that the two are together and in the same pack that Nate was in, she beams as they approach her.<br />
“Ben, Alex,” Zelyna smiling; “any work from your alpha regarding the next pack meeting?”<br />
“Sorry,” Ben answering; “the were-alert is preventing any such gathering at the time. But when it’s lifted, Austin will get in touch with us to organize a meet. Your still welcome to join, if that is your intent.”<br />
“Thank you,” Zelyna answering; “may I join you two as you walk home?”<br />
“I don’t see why not,” Alex answering; “you live a couple streets away from us. But we should hurry;” Alex adding; “the sky is starting to get dark. It looks like the rain that was forecasted for today is about arrive.”<br />
<br />
Zelyna smiled as she joined the two male werewolves. Thinking that she would soon be in the same pack that Nate Anderson was in; Zelyna couldn’t wait to let Nate know that she is the one for him and willing to fight for him tooth and claw.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
“You want to stay overnight,” Nate asking as Jean pulled up to the Anderson household.<br />
“I’d like to,” Jean answering; “but I got to read a bunch of case studies and prepare for a possible test my professor likes to spring up often.”<br />
“Afraid you’ll get distracted,” Nate smiling.<br />
“That and I really need to get through this enormous pile of homework,” Jean responding; ”plus looking at the sky its going to rain soon and the top for my car is back home. I don’t want this interior to get wet.”<br />
“You better hurry then,” Nate looking up at the rapidly darkening sky as he got out of Jean’s car; “it looks like it could happen any moment.”<br />
<br />
 “We’ll talk later then,” Jean smiling as she drives off.<br />
Picking up his back and turning around, Nate heads towards the front door. Seeing his both of his parent’s car in the driveway; Nate knew they were home along with Eric. Curious as to how Eric is feeling after getting punched by Fat Piggy, Nate opens up the door to head inside.</p>
