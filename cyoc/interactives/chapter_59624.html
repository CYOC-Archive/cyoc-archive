<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty sighed on the way back home after school. His life was better now that he had changed Dustin into Dusty. She had adjusted well to <br />
her new life without too many adjustments. He had begun to suspect that she had always wanted to be a girl but was afraid to say <br />
anything fearing ridicule. She would have been especially by Mark. He frowned thinking about him. Mark had wanted a son but after <br />
Dusty was born they discovered that June couldn't have anymore children. June still spoiled Dusty just as she had spoiled Dustin but to <br />
a lesser extent.<br />
<br />
Ty thought back to when he had made himself Tanya. It was fun but not something he wanted to spend the rest of his life as. Also the <br />
looks Mark had been giving him throughout that day made him suspect that Mark had only agreed to adopt Tanya so he could have sex <br />
with her and maybe get the son he wanted. Ty shuddered at that thought. He was a human being not a sex doll or baby factory. He <br />
could have used his power to change Mark but he didn't for some reason. In fact he really hasn't used his power much except to change <br />
Dustin into Dusty. He wondered why that was. He had tried wishing that he knew why but he still didn't know why. He also didn't know <br />
why or how he gained his power. Maybe he couldn't give himself knowledge like that.<br />
<br />
The bus stopped and Ty got up from his seat. Once he was off and walking up to the door he had the sense that he was being <br />
followed. He quickly turned around and saw that Ariel was following him. She was a nice girl with a heart shaped face, green eyes, long <br />
brown hair, about B cup breasts, an hourglass shape, long legs, and a small teardrop shaped ass. She was fifteen and stood at five foot <br />
four inches making her a couple inches taller than him. &quot;Why are you following me?&quot; Ty asked with some annoyance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll tell you in a little bit,&quot; Ariel said giving Ty a wink. &quot;Right now we should get inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to know why you're following me,&quot; Ty said and wished time to stop around him and Ariel.<br />
<br />
Ariel watched as a bird flying past slowed down and then stopped in midair. The noises around them stretched out and then cut off. <br />
Ariel smiled and said, &quot;Well I can see that you did receive the power. I thought the Ancients might have been mistaken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Ty asked looking confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go inside and I'll explain,&quot; Ariel said smiling.<br />
<br />
Before Ty could do anything though everything dissolved into white mist. This only lasted for a second at the most then the mist <br />
coalesced back into forms. However the only thing that was the same was Ariel standing in front of him the rest was different. Ty looked <br />
around at the room he found himself in. The walls were pink, the quilt on the bed was pink with white and red hearts on it, the dresser <br />
was white with brass heart shaped knobs, there was a white vanity with a heart shaped mirror and the chair's back was also heart <br />
shaped, there was a nice TV and DVD player positioned so someone could lay down in the bed and watch the TV, next to the TV was <br />
a small bookcase filled with DVDs, there was a bigger bookcase filled with books quite a few of which appeared to be romance novels, <br />
and the closet door had a poster of a male character from a certain popular book and movie series. &quot;Where are we?&quot; Ty asked once he <br />
was done looking around.<br />
<br />
&quot;In my room silly,&quot; Ariel said with a smile while putting her book bag and purse on the vanity.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did we get here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on Ty you can't really believe you're the only one with this power,&quot; Ariel said sitting down on her bed. At Ty's blank look she <br />
sighed and said, &quot;Well it looks like you did think that. Did you ever wonder how you got your power?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did and I tried finding out how and why but it didn't work,&quot; Ty said looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because we can't acquire knowledge using our power,&quot; Ariel said leaning back. &quot;We can make some changes in people's minds <br />
if it's connected to a change in reality like making someone believe that I'm your adopted sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that's true then you want to watch out for Mark,&quot; Ty said sitting down in the chair. &quot;I changed myself into a girl and he looked at me <br />
weird like he wanted to have sex with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you didn't do anything to him?&quot; Ariel asked in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;No and I'm not sure why,&quot; Ty said frowning. He shrugged and said, &quot;I guess maybe because I was just going to be a girl for that day so <br />
there was no need to change him at the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if he makes any move on me he'll be sorry,&quot; Ariel said with a wicked smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how and why did I get my power?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Another gave up their power to become mortal again and it transferred to you at random.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So someone else could have received this power?&quot; Ty asked with wide eyes. He didn't like the thought of this power getting into some <br />
bully or murderer's hands. When Ariel nodded he asked, &quot;Why would someone give up immortality?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After so long some people get bored with the life,&quot; Ariel said laying down and putting her hands behind her head. &quot;The Ancients are <br />
called that because they are thousands of years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thousands?&quot; Ty asked his mouth hanging open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes thousands,&quot; Ariel said nodding. &quot;Also another reason that some give up the power and become mortal again is to have children of <br />
their own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn't you make yourself pregnant with someone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we could but they wouldn't be our children. That's one of the limits of our power. We can be pregnant with someone else but as <br />
soon as they're out of our womb reality snaps back to the way it was before. One good thing is that we could have sex right now and <br />
not worry about me becoming pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what other limits are there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well besides not being able to acquire knowledge using our power and being unable to have children of our own we can't use our <br />
power to directly kill someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; Ty asked interrupting Ariel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok say I wanted to kill you,&quot; Ariel said sitting up and gesturing toward Ty. &quot;I couldn't make you burst into flames or make your heart <br />
stop with my power. I could however create a flamethrower and use that to burn you or create a sword and stab you. Of course those <br />
things wouldn't kill you. The only way for you to die is for you to become mortal again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So any other limits?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we can't change what someone else has done and we can't change each other,&quot; Ariel said laying back down. &quot;For example I can't <br />
restart time because you stopped it. Also we can't raise the dead or make someone fall in love with someone else or change their <br />
emotions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I made Dusty like Kevin,&quot; Ty said thinking out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;No you didn't,&quot; Ariel said with a tone that would brook no argument. &quot;Emotions are complicated. If you try to change emotions all that <br />
would happen is the person receiving a suggestion which may or may not work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, so those are the only limits?&quot; Ty asked looking at how Ariel was laying on her bed. She had her legs spread open seemingly <br />
inviting him to have sex with her despite her wearing jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those are the only limits,&quot; Ariel confirmed. &quot;We can pretty much do anything else with our power. We can also share our power with <br />
one other person. That person will become immortal too and can make wishes following the limits of our power. The only thing that's <br />
different is you can change what has been changed by the person you share your power with since it's your power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It almost sounds like you're saying we're genies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ariel got a wide smile on her face then said, &quot;Where do you think mortals got the idea of genies from.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty blushed a bit then asked, &quot;So what do we do now?&quot;</p>
