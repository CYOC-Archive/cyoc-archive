<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt&#39;s heart raced with a mix of anticipation and nervousness as he hovered the cursor over the option of becoming an Indian bodybuilder. The very thought of undergoing such a dramatic transformation was both exhilarating and surreal. <br />
<br />
He read the profile information:<br />
    Name: Rajesh Kumar<br />
    Age: 28<br />
    Gender: Male<br />
    Sexuality: Gay, but deeply closeted due to cultural pressures<br />
    Height: 6&#39;2&quot;<br />
    Weight: 240 lbs, predominantly muscle<br />
    Relationship Status: Single<br />
    Occupation: Professional Bodybuilder<br />
<br />
With a deep breath, he clicked the selection.<br />
As the screen flickered and the Chronivac confirmed his choice, Matt felt a sudden wave of dizziness wash over him. The world spun, and for a moment, everything went black. When he came to, he was no longer in his familiar surroundings. Instead, he found himself lying in a modestly furnished room, the early morning light of India filtering through a curtain.<br />
<br />
The first thing Matt noticed was the sheer size and power of his new body. His arms, now thickly muscled, felt heavy and powerful at his sides. He sat up, marveling at the defined abs and the broad chest that now formed part of his physique. A sense of awe overtook him as he ran his hands over his muscular arms, feeling the solid strength of each bicep, the hard contours of his shoulders, and the rippling abs. It was a sensation like no other, the feeling of raw power coursing through a body he had only dreamed of possessing.<br />
<br />
However, with this newfound physical prowess came a complex mix of emotions. More poignantly, Matt could feel the inner turmoil of Rajesh&#39;s concealed sexuality. In a society where being openly gay was fraught with difficulties, Rajesh had built a fortress around his true self. This hidden aspect of his identity, contrasted with his public persona as a formidable bodybuilder, added a layer of complexity to his experience.<br />
<br />
As he stood up, feeling the weight and strength of his new form, Matt looked at himself in a small, slightly tarnished mirror on the wall. The face staring back at him was rugged and handsome, a stark contrast to his own. <br />
Matt stood in front of the mirror, his eyes fixated on his transformed body. With a cocky grin, he flexed his bulging biceps, feeling the power and strength coursing through his veins. He admired the chiseled contours of his chest, tracing his fingers along the defined lines of his abs. It was a sight that would make anyone weak in the knees.<br />
<br />
But Matt wasn&#39;t just satisfied with admiring his reflection. Oh no, he wanted to push the limits of his newfound physique. He raised his arms, flexing his biceps once more.<br />
<br />
With a wicked smile, Matt stripped off his clothes, his muscular frame glistening with sweat. He ran his hands over his sculpted chest, feeling the hard nipples that begged for attention. His fingers trailed down, tracing the defined lines of his abs, until they reached his throbbing cock, already rock hard and eager for action.<br />
<br />
Leaning in closer to the fragmented mirror, he whispered to his reflection, &quot;You&#39;re one sexy motherfucker, Rajesh. Now let&#39;s have some fun.&quot; And with that, he began to explore his body, his hands wandering over every inch, squeezing and caressing his muscles, sending shivers of pleasure coursing through his veins. As Matt stands before the mirror, his eyes wander over his newly transformed body. A cocky grin spreads across his face as he flexes his bulging biceps, admiring the veins that pulse with power. His hands glide down his sculpted chest, feeling the hardened muscles beneath his fingertips. He runs his tongue over his lips, savoring the taste of his own newfound masculinity.<br />
<br />
He runs his hands over his washboard abs, feeling the ridges and crevices, reveling in the sensation. <br />
<br />
With a mischievous glint in his eyes, Matt starts to perform a seductive dance, swaying his hips and tracing his fingers along the lines of his muscles. He watches himself in the mirror, the image of raw, unadulterated desire. His hands roam over his toned thighs, gripping and squeezing, relishing in the strength he now possesses.<br />
<br />
He turns around, giving himself a view of his firm, rounded ass, and smacks it playfully, the sound echoing in the room.<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s eyes meet his own gaze in the mirror, a hunger burning within them. He can&#39;t help but be consumed by his own reflection, as he imagines the pleasure he could bring to others with this powerful body. The thought of dominating and being worshipped sends a shiver down his spine.<br />
<br />
As his fingers danced down his body, they found their way to his tight, eager hole. He circled it, teasing himself, before plunging a finger deep inside. The sensation sent waves of pleasure radiating through him, his moans of ecstasy filling the room. Seeing the reflection of such a muscular bodybuilder fingering himself excited Matt to no end.<br />
<br />
But Matt wasn&#39;t done yet. He craved more. With a glint in his eye, he reached for a bottle of lube and coated his fingers generously. <br />
Matt succumbs to his desires. His hands trail down his abdomen, reaching his throbbing cock. He strokes himself slowly, a low moan escaping his lips. Fuck, where was I? Oh yeah, Matt, that self-obsessed motherfucker, standing there in front of that mirror, practically drooling over his own goddamn reflection. His hands, still slick with anticipation, continue their slow descent down his taut abdomen, tracing the lines of his chiseled physique, heading straight for his throbbing cock.<br />
<br />
As his fingers wrap around his pulsating shaft, a guttural moan rips from his lips, echoing through the room like a primal call of pleasure. His eyes remain locked on the mirror, fixated on the sight of his own hand stroking his engorged member. The reflection taunts him, magnifying every twitch, every vein throbbing with desire.<br />
<br />
With each stroke, his hips involuntarily thrust forward, seeking more of that sweet, intoxicating friction. He can feel the tightness building in his balls, the pressure mounting as he nears the edge of release. His grip tightens, his strokes quicken, and the rhythmic sound of his hand meeting flesh fills the room.<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s gaze doesn&#39;t waver, his eyes locked on his own reflection, captivated by the raw sexual energy that radiates from his transformed body. The sight of his bulging biceps, his sculpted chest, and that throbbing cock being expertly stroked sends waves of pleasure coursing through him.<br />
<br />
As the sensations intensify, his moans grow louder, echoing off the walls. He can feel the heat spreading through his body, his muscles tensing, preparing for the impending explosion. And then, with a primal roar, his orgasm crashes over him like a tidal wave.<br />
<br />
Ropes of hot cum shoot from his cock, splattering against the mirror as he continues to stroke through the waves of pleasure. Each spurt of his release sends shivers down his spine, his body convulsing with the intensity of his climax. He watches, breathless, as his reflection is painted with his own essence, a visual testament to his insatiable appetite.<br />
<br />
As his body slowly comes down from the high, Matt leans against the mirror, his chest heaving with exertion. His eyes, once filled with raw desire, now hold a mix of satisfaction and smugness. With a wicked grin, he wipes the remnants of his ecstasy from the mirror, leaving a smudged testament to his own debauchery.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn am I hot...&quot; he mutters to himself, his voice laced with a mix of pride and arrogance.</p>
