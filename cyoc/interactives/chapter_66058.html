<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;My name is Tal,&quot; he stated, looking into the mirror and still not quite believing what he was saying, sure that he was off by a letter somewhere, but unsure what that letter was.<br />
<br />
Brushing a hand against the dress he was wearing, he thought that it was still weird that he was dressed in clothes appropriate for a girl and that he knew so much on being a girl, yet his mind insisted that he was not a girl and that he was in fact a guy. Focusing on the mirror, he took in the fact that his stance and posture was that of a girl and blinking, shifting his attention so that he was looking at his face, he once again stated, &quot;My name is Tal,&quot; faltered and then said, &quot;Maybe Tai.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he gripped the fabric of the dress in one of his hands, he groaned in frustration as he knew that both were in correct and that he still could not remember his name. Turning away from the mirror, he headed back to the bed he had slept in, noting that there were two other beds and that they were presumably for the woman who had brought him breakfast and offered a bit on an explanation and for her sister, who's clothes he was currently wearing. When he got to the bed, he turned about and returned to the mirror, where he turned around again and paced back to the bed.<br />
<br />
While he paced back and forth, he thought of the options the woman had suggested and pondered over anything that she had said that would return his memory and perhaps even offer a solution to the situation he currently found himself in. After a couple times of pacing back and forth, he once again found himself in front of the mirror, taking in how masculine his face looked and how it contrasted with the way the rest of him looked, except for his hands and feet, which he noted his head went well with considering both were masculine in appearance. Hugging himself, he looked at the way the shirt was stretched across his breasts and letting his arms drop to his sides, he once again stated, &quot;My name is...&quot; but stopped as he realised that he did not know his name.<br />
<br />
&quot;There really is no point in forcing such a matter,&quot; a voice behind him stated and turning, he found himself looking at a girl of about fourteen or fifteen years of age.<br />
<br />
Holding out a hand, she said, &quot;I'm Prue,&quot; and as he took the offered appendage, he explained, &quot;I don't know who I am, except for the fact that I appear female and have the ability to understand things only a girl understands, yet I believe I must be male.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Prue released his hand, she commented, &quot;Yeah. That's the way a lot of people feel when they first get here. But, eventually, they either choose to be a Kitsune or they find their way back to their old lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he nodded at this, Prue continued on by saying, &quot;My older sister, Valene, sent me in here to offer any assistance I might be able to give. I can already see that my clothes fit you, so do feel shy about borrowing whatever you need,&quot; and sitting down on one of the two beds he had noted earlier, she asked, &quot;So, is there anything I can help with?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sitting down on the bed he had awoken in, he thought for a moment and then said, &quot;Your sister, Valene, she said that I could try on another costume. One of a male Kitsune. But there was a real slim chance of anything happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod from Prue and continuing, he told her, &quot;Do you think you could get me one of those costumes? No offense, but I really don't want to female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Prue said, smiling and standing, she started for the door, but stopped and turning to face him, she comment, &quot;And no, I do not take offense. As stated previous, there are others before you who found their way back to where they came from, reverting back to the sex and gender, if it had been altered, they were before putting on the costume,&quot; and opening the door, she disappeared.<br />
<br />
Sighing and hugging himself, he silently hoped that putting on a second costume would work and standing, he once again started to pace, stopping after a bit to stare into the mirror, sometimes forming the question, &quot;My name is..?&quot; but never sure how to finish it.<br />
<br />
Somewhere between ten and fifteen minutes later, Prue was back, holding an object folded up and turning away the mirror, he thanked the girl as he took what he could see was a anthropomorphic fox costume with gold coloured fur and green eyes. Unfolding it, he glanced at Prue and asked, &quot;Do you think I could get some privacy?&quot; feeling really self-conscious about his body and the option of undressing in front of a girl, even though he was sure that she had probably already seen him naked.<br />
<br />
Prue smiled at this, almost as if she thought something funny and telling him as he set the costume on the nearest bed, &quot;Sure,&quot; she exited back out the door she had come in, leaving him to his privacy.<br />
<br />
Undoing the buttons on the blouse, he returned to the mirror and stared at his breast poking out past the open shirt, knowing that it was incorrect that his torso appeared the way it did. Pushing down on the dress, he let it pool onto the floor and stepping away from it, he slowly took off his shirt, all the while staring at his reflection, disliking the fact that he knew he should be a guy and that what he saw reflecting back was a girl.<br />
<br />
As he discarded the blouse on one of the nearby beds, he picked up the costume, found the clips separating the mask and paw-like hands and feet and setting those items aside, he pulled on the body suit, noting that it was a couple sizes too big. When he had slipped his arms through the arm-holes of the costume and pulled the body suit on up over his shoulders, he turned his attention back to the mirror, disappointed that all he saw was somebody standing in a body suit that was several sizes too big. Reaching for the paw-like hands and feet and mask, he pulled the mask on over his head and fumbled his way into the paw-like hands and feet, which did not really fit and kept slipping off his hands.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;Christ. I cannot see,&quot; he pulled off the mask and after a moment stepped out of the paw-like feet as the paw-like hands slipped off his hands yet again.<br />
<br />
A feeling of wanting suddenly cry washed over him and shrugging out of the body suit, disappointment and frustration washing over him, he tossed the costume on the bed and after a moment, he slowly began to get dressed in the blouse and dress he had been wearing before trying on the second costume. Reaching for the male Kitsune costume, he slowly began to fold it back up and when he was finished doing that, he headed for the door, the feeling of wanting to cry stronger than ever as he hugged himself and the costume to his torso.</p>
