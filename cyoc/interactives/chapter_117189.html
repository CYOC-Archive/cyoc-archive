<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miles and Lukasky both sighed heavily as exited the Jenkins home. The investigation of the whole incident was going slowly and had its fair share of frustrations, though given Alice Decrux&#39;s history that wasn&#39;t that surprising. Proving a Statute 1A violation looked more and more unlikely, as nothing they&#39;d found gave any indication that Virginia McCoy had clawed Harold Jenkins deliberately and the conflicting accounts from McCoy and Dexcrux made it look more like the incident was an accident. It left them with few real options. Regarding the suspicion on Statute 1A, their only real option was to see what the neighbors had seen. The easier case that they had related the possibility that Decrux didn&#39;t provide any warning of the presence of Love Potion Number 9 in the Peanut Brittle, which would then classify as illegal drugging. The penalty might be less than that for Statute 1A, but it might open the door for something that could ultimately prevent Decrux from continuing her actions in the long term.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... scratch one person to ask about this supposed note,&quot; Detective Miles commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Detective Lukasky nodded, &quot;and might give us some good news... but... while we&#39;re in the area, let&#39;s see what the neighbors might have seen. I might be the only thing we can get to provide some proof on the Statute 1A charges that we&#39;d want to lay on Decrux.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miles nodded. The DA, Simon Theropod, did wish to catch Decrux given her history and thus suspicion and getting some answers from those who lived in the area might get something that would provide some consensus on the stories from the incident and give him a case that he could win. Of course there was also the risk that that the neighbors didn&#39;t see anything that would be any more conclusive, but it wasn&#39;t like they really had much option. If they were to land evidence to convict Decrux of a Statute 1A they needed to gain some outside witnesses on the incident.<br />
<br />
The two then began to make their way along the street to begin asking the neighbors who were close enough to at least seen what had happened. Some of that would be difficult on a few levels, but that would be the same in just about any town. It might vary as some towns could have curved roads that would mean changing lines of sight, but in general, many towns had their blocks arranged in squares and rectangles could have the same issue as Moon Lake did on the spokes of the town that radiated out from the central part of the town. A person could look down the street and potentially see something at a great distance away, and the only thing that would change is the angle at which the incident was seen. That was the case for much of Moon Lake, as its wagon-wheel shape had left many long streets. The only thing that often interfered with visibility were changes in topography such as hills, and in some cases were people had planted trees and bushes near the sidewalk. But in this specific area, things were rather clear and on the plus side, the specific spoke that they were on was fairly close to the edge of town on its northeastern side and actually limited the number of houses they&#39;d need to check with.<br />
<br />
At the first house the checked, they found that no one was home. There was, however, someone home at the second home they came to. It was a relative middle aged Normal who walked with a bit of a limp and had his leg in a cast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you?&quot; the man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m Detective Jensen Lukasky this is my partner Denny Miles,&quot; Lukasky spoke politely, &quot;We&#39;d like to ask you a few questions about a fight from a couple of days ago. Do you have the time?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man looked between them sighed and then shrugged, &quot;Yeah, I suppose so. I was visiting my daughter on the other side of town last week. She and her husband have some very energetic and excitable future weredogs and I ended up busting up my ankle indulging them. It&#39;s left me pretty much useless. All I got is time.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stepped back and let Lukasky and Miles enter. They politely nodded to him as they entered. He seemed a bit grumpy at his situation, but they still had to do their job and wanted to keep things as cordial as they could.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you want to know about this fight?&quot; the man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly to see if you saw anything,&quot; Miles commented, &quot;as there is the potential that the fight could include a Statute 1A violation, but we need some witness testimony to make a case either way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both watched as the man blinked as it was clear that he knew what &quot;Statute 1A&quot; meant and if it had been violated, there was a problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another rogue... so soon after what happened with that college professor and student?&quot; the man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Lukasky answered, &quot;and the fight had the potential for that law to be violated. That&#39;s where we need the help of any and all available witnesses.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man visibly sighed. &quot;I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know if I can help. I was watching TV when I heard a bunch of yelling and then a roar and chattering. Unfortunately by the time I could get to a window, I could only see a male weretiger, fully transformed, holding down a female wereraccoon, fully transformed, with a female weretiger behind him, and she was also fully transformed... but that&#39;s about all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Lukasky and Miles sighed at that and looked down as they did so. The man looked quietly to them for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t be of any more help,&quot; the man spoke slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; Lukasky answered, &quot;we have others to talk to and with the one that we suspect as being behind it... we have other options available to us. Don&#39;t worry...&quot;<br />
<br />
The two stood up to show themselves up and began to head back toward the front door. When they reached it, Miles looked back to the man who limped after them. He sighed and turned back to follow Lukasky out. He wanted to say more and identify Alice Decrux as the suspected rogue, but after everything that Yvette Smith put Moon Lake through, such a warning might cause unnecessary panic. Yvette Smith had put the city in a near state of panic where a WERE Alert was close to being issued, requiring every were, with few exceptions, to report to police agents to join the hunt for the rogue vixen. Miles had seen some of that panic among Moon Lake&#39;s normals as they feared being attack. At the present time, such a warning with Alice Decrux might have the same fear raising effect which wouldn&#39;t help. Alice Decrux could very well be a &quot;rogue&quot; within were society, but her actions were far more controlled and were not at random. If she wanted this middle aged man, she would have likely made a move by now. And while they were ending their investigation into Virginia McCoy with the evidence essentially clearing the weretigress of deliberate action, that didn&#39;t mean that a uniformed officer wouldn&#39;t be on duty in the area, as Alice Decrux was still being investigated. For the moment, things would be quiet on that front.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully some of the others saw a bit more than that,&quot; Lukasky said slowly and with his tone of voice was a bit depressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully,&quot; Miles nodded.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, things in that regard didn&#39;t get much better. One person did see more of the fight, but hadn&#39;t been close enough to hear anything that was said. Based on what was seen, Virginia&#39;s story of Alice being the one who threw the first punch seemed more and more likely, but without any commentary on what was said, they couldn&#39;t use much more. The rest weren&#39;t home. In a way it was a bit depressing for both of them, but in some ways it was to be expected.  With many people working, by now, many were bound to have head out for the day to work. They might try again later when more of the neighbors were home. For the rest of the day, they had other things they&#39;d need to check on and hoped that the delivery man was still at home.</p>
