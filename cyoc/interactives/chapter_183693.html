<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“How about…” Nick began, as he crept over to his dresser, where he had placed the regression gun.<br />
<br />
“What do you have in mind?” Clark asked, noting a playfully sinister tone in Nick’s voice.<br />
<br />
Nick picked up the gun and aimed it straight at Clark. “How about we both be kids!?”<br />
<br />
Clark reflexively shot up his arms, signaling his passivity. “Whoaaa, I don’t know, man… Wouldn’t you wanna have… I dunno… an adult around, in case anything happened?” Clark’s voice wavered, unable to conceal his apprehension.<br />
<br />
“Nah,” Nick replied, “I’m sure nothing would happen if we’re just at home.”<br />
<br />
“Well… yeahhhh, but also isn’t this still a test of the gun?” Clark reminded him. “We’re still not sure if everything works perfectly yet, right?”<br />
<br />
“What, don’t trust my science?” Nick gleefully countered. <br />
<br />
Clark shot a stern look at Nick.<br />
<br />
“Oh, come on, dude! I’m totally fine. No problems at all!” Nick turned himself for Clark to see that he was visually as he said he was, completely normal.<br />
<br />
“Sure, I guess you’re fine, but I just don’t really wanna be a kid again, dude. Ya know?” Clark reasoned.<br />
<br />
Nick was determined to convince Clark otherwise. “That’s fair. I was nervous too, but it’s honestly kind of revitalizing. You’ll feel great! I promise.”<br />
<br />
“Nick, since you’re soooo into this ‘being a kid’ thing right now, let me put this another way,” Clark said in a stern, disciplinary tone. “I’m the adult here, and I’m saying no!”<br />
<br />
Nick’s head sunk, eyes sullen. Clark was right, he knew, but Clark couldn’t possibly know that he didn’t want it without having tried it… Nick perked back up again and cocked the gun, a smile spreading wide across his youthful visage.<br />
<br />
“Well, you can’t tell me no if I’m older!” Nick shouted excitedly before adjusting the digital display to read “10” and pulling the trigger, gun pointing squarely at Clark’s chest.<br />
<br />
“Nick!” But before Clark could truly protest, a sudden loosening of his clothes begged his attention. Clark’s jeans fell lazily to the floor, and Clark reached quickly for his boxers, holding them in place but knowing that soon there wouldn’t be much for them to hide. His muscularity, stubble, and an ample endowment vanished swiftly as the years were pulled away from him. For his part, Nick was shocked to see the process on another person, standing wide-eyed and mouth agape.<br />
<br />
Finally, as Clark neared his target age of 10, his shirt draping over him, he let go of the plaid boxers that had hid what his now oversized shirt easily could, and he looked over at Nick, who looked to be about an inch taller than him now, where previously Clark had held that advantage at 6’2”. <br />
<br />
Clark waddled over to the mirror, observing his sad, shrunken frame, holding his arms out to test his much reduced wingspan.<br />
<br />
“Niiiickkk,” Clark whined, cringing noticeably at the pitch of his voice and even more so at the fact that it was just ever so higher than Nick’s. “Seriously dude, why now of all times?”<br />
<br />
Nick disregarded Clark’s sour attitude and replied gleefully, “What’s the problem?”<br />
<br />
“Maaaannnn, I was gonna go fuckin’ jerk it when I got home…” Clark protested, very audibly annoyed and disappointed. “And obviously I can’t do that now.”<br />
<br />
Nick laughed at his poor friend’s untimely blue-balling. “Well, in your own words, ‘I just wanted to really sell the whole, ‘being 10 again’ thing for you.’” Nick’s smug grin spread. “So just forget allll your adult urges for the weekend! Like you said, there’s not much you can do about that anyway at your current age!”<br />
<br />
Clark knew Nick was right, but his sexual frustration and defeat at the hands of his 11-year old best friend sullied his normally easy-going demeanor. “You sure you couldn’t at least make me like 13 or something so I could maaybeeee… take care of myself?” Clark pleaded pathetically, already anticipating the answer.<br />
<br />
“Nope!” Nick beamed. “You get to be younger than me, and we’re both gonna be kids the whole weekend! Then when I get the prize money, I’ll split it with you 50/50, but you have to at least try to enjoy the weekend. No trying to turn yourself back when I’m not looking.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I guess an extra $500 would be nice,” Clark relented. He paused, contemplating the offer for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Sure, man. I’ll be a kid, but just for this weekend! But you have to turn me back on Monday so I can drive you to the competition. Got it?”<br />
<br />
“Deal!” Nick squealed, so excited that he’d get to spend the weekend partaking in all sorts of childlike activities without a care in the world.<br />
Clark, less shy than Nick had always been, began removing his shirt. Nick snuck a peak at Clark’s former manhood, remarking internally at how the mighty certainly have fallen. That little tool certainly wouldn’t be seeing any of the action that Clark had planned for it this weekend. He felt a tinge of guilt for a moment, before Clark interrupted him.<br />
<br />
Clark threw his shirt over to the pile on the floor that consisted of his jeans and boxers before turning to Nick. “Alright dude, throw me the tighty whities,” he said as he gestured toward the opened package of underwear sitting on the floor next to Nick. “Unless you wanna look at my dick all weekend.” The two laughed at the remark, Nick picking up the package and tossing it Clark’s way.<br />
<br />
The younger boy shimmied a pair of briefs up his legs. He let the waistband snap against his skin in an exaggerated fashion as he walked over to Nick.<br />
<br />
He put an arm around his friend’s neck from behind, pulling him down to the floor in a surprise maneuver; the two wrestled playfully for a minute before Nick’s 1 year advantage allowed him to pin the smaller boy on his back. He then collapsed at Clark’s side.<br />
<br />
“Maaannnn,” Clark said, catching his breath. “Look at us.” Clark was beginning to appreciate the marvel of technology that Nick had begot into the world. “It’s been like, what? Twenty years? And we’re back in tighty whities.” The boys chuckled in unison. “Go figure,” Clark remarked. He looked over at his now older friend, “Honestly, I kinda missed this. Just us bein’ kids.” <br />
<br />
Nick returned a warm smile.<br />
<br />
“You were right.” Clark continued. “This’ll be a fun weekend.” <br />
<br />
The two stood up from the floor, and Clark began toward the living room. <br />
<br />
“Uh, you sure you don’t want these?” Nick had picked up the bag containing the boy-sized shorts and graphic tees.<br />
<br />
“Dude,” Clark responded. “You know I never wear clothes in the apartment. And I’m not gonna start now just cuz I’m wearing little boy’s underwear.” Clark pulled at the white waistband of the briefs. “Besides, you’re in no place to make fun of me for it, are you?” Clark teased as he exited to the living room. <br />
<br />
Nick laughed. Clark was right. They were both stuck in tighty whities for the weekend. A real blast from the past. But what to do now that they’re both kids…</p>
