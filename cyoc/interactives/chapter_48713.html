<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This is going to be interesting touching on each players story with the constant transition of back to the house.<br />
<br />
Turn Order<br />
1. Kari - Aquatic Queen<br />
2. Richie/Darwin - Naga, Hawk eyes, merged with Richie, Power Hungry<br />
3. Angel - Hawk eyes, has potion of speed, in heat<br />
4. Darwin/Richie - Naga, Hawk eyes, merged with Richie, Power Hungry(Current turn)<br />
5. Ester - Vixen, Forest Guardian (trapped in forest), forest camo, in heat <br />
6. Micha - Desert Sultan's eight year old daughter (trapped in desert,movement cut in half), becomes a half human half scorpion creature every other turn<br />
<br />
To find himself back at the board right after Angel's move, allowing him to move twice as much was very fitting for the Serpentine King.  He had changed and it was unlikely the others would approve of his changes.  He would stay silent for now until he had the power to dominate all the other players to his control.  Using his eyes, he examined the board to determine what type of card he wished to receive.  It would be further embarrassment to find himself cursed any further and moved his piece near the border of a town that was along the path to the castle, the card popped out of the side of the board and he pulled a physical change card.  Smiling, he grunted as his tail split into a pair of legs, his body growing half a foot higher so he was a commanding 6'6&quot;, muscles gaining definition on his calves and arms.  A minor change and now he found himself by that town.<br />
<br />
The sentry took one look at him and screamed in terror, &quot;Monster!&quot;<br />
<br />
He could have laughed at the pitiful peasants as they scrambled to and fro, gathering pitchforks and rusty swords before opening the gates for him, presenting a mob that looked just as likely to attack him as flee in terror.  The best way to deal with the insects would be to squash the leader which always was the most vocal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Begone, foul monster.  We know not where you came or even what manner of beast you are but we will not hesitate to defend ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh there is just so much wrong with that statement we're not even sure where to begin.&quot;  Richie/Darwin's voice boomed out and the crowd physically flinched, inching back.  He began slowly taking steps forward, one by one getting closer by the second to the leader with each word he spoke.  &quot;First, this rag tag group of serfs are a pack of cowards and I can see perfectly every drop of sweat on their brow and each half turned eye looking for escape.  Second, right now you are completely incapable of causing me harm and the first to even threaten me by swinging a weapon will face a brutal death.  Third, I am not a monster, I am a God.&quot;  His dual voice was hypnotic and before the leader could realize it, the serpent man stood before him and the leader was grabbed by the neck, claws tearing through flesh and blood beginning to flow.  The mob leader was lifted off the ground and slammed back to earth, a brutal crack sounding out.  Richie/Darwin Looked at the petrified mob as weapons fell from nerveless fingers.  &quot;We are the Serpentine King, our will is divine law and any who rebel shall pray for death.  We will bring a wind of change to this world, now take us to the finest home in this hovel that we might spread our dominion across the realm.  That others may come to know us and worship.  For I am DARIC PLAIN ASP and none may speak this name without committing blasphemy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daric roared and watched in satisfaction as those too weak willed dropped to the ground in fear or bolted in a mad dash, forgetting the weapons they dropped to the ground.  Yes, this is exactly what he/they wanted.  The fear, the respect, the power was right here and now his.  He looked at a female that despite the rags and tears looked quite pretty bowing before him. When she noticed him standing above her she shook her head, as if to refuse his attention.  A wise move on her part.  They would not be nice to her.  &quot;Oh my God, please protect me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daric grabbed her by the wrist and dragged her to her feet, &quot;And who would you have me protect you from?  This is sudden, I understand but you cannot refuse divine will.  I will be leaving in the morning and then you may return to anonymity from your God and king.  You'll see though.  I will be taking ten men with me when I leave,&quot; Daric announced to the crowd, &quot;I will allow you to choose and should I find them unsuitable then I will take them all and raze this pathetic piece of civilization to the ground.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Ester panted hard as she fingered her pussy, the sweat dripping from her face and soaking her hair, the juices from her pussy freely flowing and staining her clothes as she jammed her hand in and out.  The pistoning fingers providing faint relief to her body even as her mind screamed for cock and cum and how she really wished Darwin were here with his snake like body wrapped around her as she sucked him off and she could drink his cum and wipe it all over her body, the slightly sticky residue acting as a reminder and something extra for after.  Or Micah's firm dick before the game between her breasts and spurting like a living fountain she could just lap up created an ache in her gut.  It was impossible being stuck in this forest, though Ester could tell that Angel was no longer nearby, her turn must have come and gone and soon it would be hers.  Perhaps she should have grabbed her friend and shoved her face deep into her crotch so that Angel's tongue could lap up just a little of her need.  Despite having the idea Ester could not seriously consider it though, she was not a lesbian to pant after a female.  No she really needed a cock; a big fat one, dripping in preparation for what she would do.  As she realized that Ester found herself back in the house, the physical aching subsided leaving Ester confused and slightly frustrated.  She had wanted it hadn't she?<br />
<br />
When Ester regained control of her fraught nerves and emotions she wondered if this heat would ever disappear if she could just fuck someone.  Growling in frustration Ester looked at the board and saw that the detailed board was beginning to change from a broad map to more detailed scale model of the world, plastic ranges of mountains now jutted up and a pillar of black smoke was coming up from a town with a piece next to it.  It looked like an odd fusion of obsidian and ruby and Ester wondered what could have happened to Darwin and Richie for that to occur.  <br />
<br />
Unable to get any answers from just looking Ester placed a finger on the sapphire piece that represented Kari and asked, &quot;What's going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ester?  It's been so long since I've heard from anyone, let alone been my turn.  What's going on?&quot; Telepathy was definitely weird to experience.  Ester didn't so much hear the words as think them, only Ester knew that she wouldn't be thinking those words and they were in a different voice then she thought in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know Kari, I was hoping you did, my mind has been so messed up that I'm not sure how much time has passed.  Has anyone found an artifact yet?&quot;  Talking herself made her feel a little better about the conversation, as a way to keep things separate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sort of, the people who kidnapped me recently gave me one, it's a long story but I think they did, I'm going to start heading to the castle. As for me, it's been ten hours since Richie became a plains spirit and we got scattered if that's any help.&quot;  Kari thought something about her comment was funny but the fact that others were closer to the goal line then her with her most likely chance to get an artifact about to be grabbed by Angel made her uncomfortable.  She wasn't likely to get a good score and then who knew what would happen when they got to the castle.  The fact that time was beginning to stretch out for turns giving longer periods with out a player at the board scared her, it was impossible that a turn could take that long.  What if that time stretched until a ten hour wait turned into a day, a week, a month until they found themselves stuck.  <br />
<br />
Ester hoped she was over reacting and picked up the dice for her turn and rolled.</p>
