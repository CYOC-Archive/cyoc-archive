<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So we’ll call it a day, right?” Emily asks you and Skylar, “what a bizarre day it was, too. I mean we didn’t even see half of it,”<br />
“Yeah, whatever you two got up to, we don’t wanna know.” Niko adds.<br />
You and Skylar look at each other and chuckle,<br />
“Yeah...” you say, scratching the back of your neck, “oh yeah. Can we make an agreement?” You ask,<br />
Everyone looks at you for your point,<br />
“Well. Since we all have some kind of magic wish making... thing? I guess. We should all agree that whatever happens we don’t spy on each other, and we don’t use them out of spite or anger or anything,”<br />
“Well, yeah.” Niko says, bluntly, “I mean I wasn’t even considering it,”<br />
“Oh. Really?” Emily responds to Niko, “umm I mean... neither was I!” She adds, half joking, half nervous,<br />
“Promise?” You ask,<br />
<br />
Emily looks at Niko, but Niko looks at you. He stretches out his arm for a handshake of agreement. You shake it.<br />
Emily does the same, but seems to only be doing it since Niko did it.<br />
<br />
“That’s it then,” you say, “we’ll clean up this mess while you two, go home. We’ll meet up some time soon,”<br />
“Works for me,” Niko says,<br />
“Yep, same here,” Emily adds,<br />
<br />
She walks up to you and gives you a big hug. She whispers in your ear, <br />
<br />
“Do your best to keep Skylar on our team. And convince her to let me start talking with her friend Taylor,”<br />
You snicker,<br />
“Yeah, I will. We’ll talk soon, just the two of us,”<br />
“Yeah, good plan.”<br />
<br />
You let go of each other,<br />
“Alright, see you two,” you say,<br />
Before you can even ask, Skylar says, “bye! I am looking forward to getting to know you two!” She waves them as they leave the door.<br />
“You two!” Niko says, cheerfully.<br />
“Yeah!” Emily chimes in, almost as cheerfully, “and keep Yu out of trouble!” She adds,<br />
<br />
God you hate when she uses your real name.<br />
<br />
You close the door behind them, so Skylar’s family doesn’t get loose. Speaking of which.<br />
<br />
“What’re we going to do about all of these?” You ask,<br />
“Well. I have a couple, ideas. Not a lot for my dad. You have no idea how many I have for my mom. And my sister is going to...” she pauses, “wait where is my sister? She was a bunny, right?”<br />
<br />
You lift and eyebrow as you realise that she’s right. She’s missing.<br />
You quickly open the door and see if she’d scurried off outside. It didn’t look like it.<br />
<br />
Skylar pokes your arm. You look at her. She’s holding her hand out for the ring. You take it off and give it to her.<br />
<br />
She slips it on and says, “I wish I knew where Mia is,” <br />
Her eyes light up as she grabs you and brings you around the corner behind the stairs.<br />
<br />
Expecting to only see a cute, white little bunny. Instead, you find something else. Or more like some-people... else.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” You and Skylar shout at once. Weirdly, Skylar’s mother moo’s loudly at this. You shrug it off, probably just weird timing.<br />
<br />
You see the couple you’d totally forgotten about. What were their names...<br />
<br />
“So you finally remembered we were here!” The girl shouted. You look at her. She’s inflated like a balloon. As was her boyfriend next to her,<br />
<br />
“Wha-what happened here?” You have to ask,<br />
“Well,” the boy starts, “we ran in here with those Emily and Niko people. We saw what was going on and quickly hid here, then all of a sudden we start growing like before-”<br />
“No thanks to you,” the girl butts in, looking at Skylar angrily. This didn’t make Skylar too happy.<br />
“Y-yeah. And we’ve been stuck like this since then.”<br />
“Holy... I’ll be honest, I forgot you were here,” you say,<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well we wouldn’t mind being put back to normal,” the girl says,<br />
“Oh of course. What’s your name again?” Skylar asks. You can hear in her voice that she’s being a little passive aggressive,<br />
“Trish and Adam,” she says,<br />
“Okay! I wish that Trish and Adam are back to normal,”<br />
<br />
You watch as their bodies slowly deflate back to normal. They brush themselves off, their clothes have been ripped to shreds, except for Trish’s panties and bra, and Adam’s underwear. You notice that they seem to be stained blue, specifically around... certain areas.<br />
<br />
“Well. I guess... we’ll just get out of your hair?” Adam says, clearly wanting to get out of the situation as quickly as possible,<br />
“Okay!” Skylar says, “oh wait, let me just, ‘I wish that Adam and Trish are wearing clothes,”<br />
<br />
You watch as their clothes suddenly fly up from the ground and wrap themselves around their bodies, fixing in the process.<br />
<br />
“Oh, wow! Thanks,” Trish says, surprised and genuine, “I mean, it would’ve been nice to be able to leave sooner, but it’s a nice gesture,”<br />
“Yeah, thanks for all of this,” Adam says, dragging Trish to the door,<br />
“No no, don’t worry about it. I mean, for the trouble we caused, the least I can do is say ‘I wish your boobs grow to the size of your head, be as inconvenient as possible in most situations, but you won’t notice it. Oh and your boyfriend will be the only one who see change,”<br />
<br />
You knew this was coming. You see her top quickly start to rise as her bra starts to stretch to the point of breaking, before it inevitably snaps. It doesn’t fall, however. The elastic of her shirt stops it, merely pinning it to the front of her shirt.<br />
Before you can see the end of the change, her boyfriend had opened the door and gotten out of the house as quickly as possible. He didn’t even close the door, or notice the changes happening to his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
“Do you think I went too far with that one?” Skylar asks, tilting her head to the side, watching them run off,<br />
“Y’know... looking at it. I don’t think so. She was a bitch, and what’s so bad about having bigger boobs, right?” You make your point,<br />
“I’m glad you agree.” She says, then stands there. You can tell she’s thinking if she should do anything else. She closes the door, “looks good to me. Her boyfriend is going to be happy.”<br />
“Definitely,” you say, “I kinda hope we run into them again,”<br />
“With those things? Trish won’t be running for a long time,” Skylar jokes. You laugh at her joke, she chuckles before blushing a little.<br />
<br />
“So seriously, what do we do about them?” You ask,<br />
“Well I have my ideas, but if you want to...”<br />
“Nope. They’re you’re family, you know what your doing,”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure you wanna do it... tonight?”<br />
“I’m glad you said that,” you respond, “I don’t think I’ve ever been this tired before,”<br />
“Me neither. Let’s just, ‘I wish Mia, Mom, Dad, all return back to normal, but are asleep until we wake them up. And they’re all clothed again... in pyjamas’,”<br />
“Good call.”<br />
You watch as all the animals slowly start to fall, becoming unconscious. Their bodies morphing and growing back into humans. Clothes form around their bodies as they lay asleep on the ground.<br />
<br />
“Well. You wanna sleep in my parents room?”<br />
“Yep!” You say, gleefully, “do you mind if I can have some of those pyjamas.”<br />
“Of course. Let’s get it all done upstairs,” Skylar makes her point. Yawning right after,<br />
“Sure.”<br />
<br />
You and Skylar make your way upstairs. You get your new pyjamas and without thinking fall asleep on the huge bed Skylar just wished to replace the Hot-Tub. As you drift off to sleep. You feel Skylar curl up around you and spoon you as you both draw a close to a crazy day.</p>
