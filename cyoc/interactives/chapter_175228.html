<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">AN: Thanks to Baby Dave for the last chapter which I just copied and altered a bit for my option. I sort of did the same with this chapter too.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take the lotion and the pills please&quot; Jonathan said.<br />
<br />
He took the pills on the off chance he chose to tell his parents about the items. Then as a extra special gift to his mom and dad give them their baby boy back by staying a toddler for a couple of days.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. Now we have a huge selection of scents to choose from. May I suggest this bottle&quot; she said holding up a bottle that was labeled &#39;Oranges and Sunshine&#39;.<br />
<br />
Jonathan wasn&#39;t a big fan of having many scents on him. He didn&#39;t even wear cologne as it was too overpowering and musky. The only scents he really enjoyed were lavender or cherries.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any lavender or cherry scented ones&quot; he asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
“Sorry we don&#39;t have cherries, but lucky for you here is a bottle of lavender lotion.” She handed him the bottle and walked down the aisle. Jonathan took it from her but remained where he was.<br />
<br />
Noticing that her customer wasn&#39;t following her she stopped, &quot;Something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just thinking, this isn&#39;t just laced with a drug that will make me think I&#39;m young, is it?&quot; Jonathan asked with a serious look.<br />
<br />
The woman shook her head, &quot;No, as I said before all our products are designed to make you younger physically.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jonathan gave her a skeptical look.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you will require a demonstration. Very well.&quot; She then walked up to him and took the bottle from his hands. She then squeezed a medium sized amount into her hands before handing it back to him, Jonathan seeing it get absorbed right away without her needing to rub it in. His eyes then nearly popped out of his head when he saw her rapidly become younger right before his eyes, shrinking down in height until her head was level with his waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap, you were telling the truth&quot; Jonathan exclaimed when he saw the 3 year old girl toddler standing in a pile of her pants with her shirt hanging on and covering her small body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Statisfied now?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, very much&quot; Jonathan replied in a dumbfounded tone.<br />
 <br />
The baby girl nodded, &quot;Good&quot; she said in her younger voice before fishing through the pockets of her pants and retrieving a packet of wet naps. Taking one out she vigorously wiped the palms of her hands as her body aged back up to adulthood, adjusting her clothes as she returned to her original age.<br />
<br />
She then proceeded to walk down the aisle with Jonathan now following her eagerly, now clutching the bottle of lotion like it was a bar of gold.<br />
<br />
“Now would you like to have any other products? Toys, pacifiers, or even clothes?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Well I&#39;d like a pacifier, a couple of bottles, three shirts and some flannel pajamas” Jonathan listed off the top of his head.<br />
<br />
The woman nodded and grabbed every single item he mentioned from the shelves, tossing it all into a bag which she then handed to him.<br />
<br />
“Now let me just go and get your diaper bag and you’ll be all set!” She exited to another room with the door being labeled “Employees only”<br />
<br />
“Miss wait!” Jonathan yelled out. She didn’t turn around at all.<br />
<br />
“I don’t need a diaper bag, everyone will know something is up if I have one of those” he silently thought to himself.<br />
<br />
The woman returned with the bag, a package of diapers, powder and wipes. The images on the outside of the packaging show that the diapers were obviously for boys who are 3 years old, but the wipes looked like any other cleaning wipes.<br />
<br />
“Most adults use wipes when they’re experiencing bathroom issues that cause their rears to burn up in pain. You can use that excuse in case your parents ask. Same goes for the baby powder.”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t know that. That’s actually pretty smart.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Another thing you should know is that these diapers will change to match your age, so don&#39;t be alarmed if they appear to be made for adults&quot; she explained, Jonathan automatically taking her word for it after witnessing her regression in person.<br />
<br />
Quickly ringing up his purchases at the cash registers she turned to face him, “Well, your grand total comes out to be $92.74.&quot; Jonathan gave her the exact total in cash and pocketed his change. She rebagged his stuff for him and gave him a receipt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should also know that first time customers who buy something that regresses them 3 and below get to take a stuffed animal of their choice from our wall free of charge&quot; she told him, gesturing to the wall to her right. Looking at it he saw it had dozens of stuffed animals that appeared extremely well made.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, really?...Thanks&quot; Trying not to blush he then proceeded to pick out an adorable but fierce looking dragon plush, putting it in the bag with the rest of his stuff.<br />
<br />
“Have a great day and Merry Christmas!”<br />
<br />
“Same to you!” Jonathan called back with a wave as he left the store. As he left, he looked down at the receipt and saw a message on the bottom. It says, “A store for those searching for their childhood”<br />
<br />
He put the receipt in his pocket and unlocked the trunk of his car, dumping everything in the back before driving home.<br />
<br />
When Jonathan got home, he unloaded the car and immediately started to wrap the presents he had bought. Halfway through he phoned in the order for pizza so that he’d be able to eat when he finished.<br />
<br />
Pizza arrived, and Jonathan was done wrapping the gifts, having already placed them under the tree. He knew his family well enough and got them presents that matched their styles. His mother liked baking and ducks, so he got her an apron and oven mitts with cartoon ducks on them. His father like to go fishing, so he got reels and clothes. His little brother George liked video games just like Jonathan, so he got him a few games that he knew he’d like.<br />
<br />
Sitting down on the couch, Jonathan opened up the pizza and smelt the delicious scent of melted cheese wafting up.<br />
<br />
Grabbing a slice on a plate and cracking open a can of soda he took a seat on the couch and proceeded to watch some tv. He had just finished it off and was devouring the crust when a baby commercial for diapers came on, causing him to remember his baby stuff. When Jonathan got home he quickly stashed everything in the far back of the closet. The lotion he hid there as well but the bottle of pills he put in the cabinet under the sink, figuring they were safe there.<br />
<br />
Looking around, he decided to close every door, window, and blinds. He didn’t want anyone to see him try what he is about to do.<br />
<br />
Going to his room and opening the closet Jonathan unbuckled his pants and watched them slide down. He then pulled down his underwear and opened the pack of diapers. Looking at them, they did look like your average pack of adult diapers. They were solid white with tapes on the side. But he knew better.<br />
<br />
Jonathan tried to get it on, but he wasn’t quite sure if it was on right. He put his underwear and pants back on, making the diaper hug his manhood tighter. Excited and eager to regress he grabbed the bottle of lotion and stood in front of the full length mirror hanging on the inside of the closet door.<br />
<br />
Squeezing a small amount on his hand Jonathan watched as it instantly disappeared into his skin, just like it did for the woman at the store.<br />
<br />
Focusing on his reflection in the mirror he said, &quot;Look out toddlerhood, here I come.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jonathan’s body began to visibly change. It shifted and shrank as he began to age backwards, growing younger as he slipped back through adolescence and reentered childhood. His pants and underwear slid down, but his diaper stayed on perfectly fine.<br />
<br />
Jonathan watched in awe as his room grew bigger and bigger by the second. When it finished, his shirt reached his ankles.<br />
<br />
“Yes, it worked! I&#39;m a toddler again!” he yelled in his new higher pitched voice, as he stared at the 3 year old in the mirror. “Oh my god is that really my voice now? I sound so young!” Jonathan said with a giggle. Just for laughs he tried to speak in his grown up voice, but he just sounded like a little kid trying to impersonate his dad.<br />
<br />
“This is so awesome” Looking at himself under the shirt he saw that the diaper had changed into the ones on the package, complete with babyish designs. Pulling back the front to peek inside he saw his manhood had also changed, becoming puny and prepubescent. He then let his shirt fall back down as he walked over to the bottle of lotion. He turned it over and read the instructions on the back.<br />
<br />
“Lavender scented body lotion for three-year-olds. Each squeeze applied to skin sinks into the pores and rejuvenates and restores the applicants back to their youth. Lotion can withstand heat, cold, and even water. You can remove the lotion by wiping down the applied surface with a wet towel or wipe. Must be brushed thoroughly to transform back.”<br />
<br />
His stomach then growled reminding him that he hadn&#39;t finished eating. Thankfully he had a whole pizza waiting for him.<br />
<br />
Throwing off his oversized clothes so he was only wearing his diaper, Jonathan grabbed a baby bottle before toddling back to the living room. Once there he filled the bottle with the remaining soda from his can and loaded up his plate with more slices. He then clambered back onto the couch where he sat down and proceeded to happily munch on pizza and drink from his bottle as he watched tv. Usually he eat about five slices, but with his new smaller body he could barely handle two.<br />
<br />
After he finished eating his body experienced a sugar rush due to the soda. There was really only one thing he could have done at that point, and that was to go nuts and have fun.<br />
<br />
For almost an hour, Jonathan ran up and down the stairs, jumped on his bed, and basically did completely stupid things his adult body couldn’t. To his surprise, he was quite flexible at his current age. He was still able to touch his head with his feet. At one point he returned to his room and did some adorable posing in front of his mirror, like laying down on his back and kicking his legs in the air and standing up and turning around to shake his diapered butt at his reflection. Jonathan even crawled around on all fours for a few minutes as a way of embracing his inner baby.<br />
<br />
Sadly, after the sugar rush began to wind down and crash, Jonathan decided to sleep downstairs so he could still watch tv. He brought a few blankets and pillows down along with his dragon plush and bunkered up on the couch. Just as he was getting comfortable he remembered the lotion was only effective for twelve hours. Not wanting to wake up as an adult he quickly went to his room to reapply another dose of lotion before coming back.<br />
<br />
Turning off all the lights, the once stressed out adult turned toddler slowly drifted off to sleep while hugging his stuffed animal tightly in his arms.</p>
