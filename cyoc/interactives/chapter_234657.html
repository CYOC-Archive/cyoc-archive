<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They all stared at me, waiting for an answer. It was intense, but damn, it turned me on like crazy.<br />
<br />
But before I could say anything we heard movement from upstairs. The slow, soft steps of an older gentleman. <br />
<br />
<i> Shit! Dad’s woken up. </i><br />
<br />
Without thinking we all rushed to the table and sat around it, hiding our now 10-inch hardons under it. The table was barely big enough to fit Dad and I around it, so four of us looked so suspicious. Our shoulders rubbed against one another as did our legs, which had to stay apart thanks to the monsters between them. Just as Carlos dragged a chair to sit right beside me (something which I was practically cheering in my head), dad came downstairs. <br />
<br />
Dad wore his usual attire of middle-aged-man-chic; a cream button up shirt with brown respectable-looking khakis and black shoes. A bright red bowtie hung around his neck. He wore that ensemble so regularly it was like a uniform to him. He certainly wasn’t the most fashionable teacher at school, not by a long shot (first place goes to Mrs Winchester, the absolute icon that she is) but he is certainly one of the most beloved. He came down wielding a mug I got for him for Father’s Day. It said <i> “#1 dad. No, #1 teacher. No, both!” </i> and he peacefully sipped from it as he entered the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“G’morning boys,” he said without looking at us, “I trust you all slept well?”<br />
<br />
Everyone nodded silently, except for Mike, who had the smarts to actually speak to someone who wasn’t looking at us.<br />
<br />
“Yes sir. Ready and uh, willing for the day!”<br />
<br />
“Willing?” Dad pondered, “I suppose preparing for any challenges is a good mindset.”<br />
<br />
He had his back turned to us as he began making his packed lunch. He turned on the old-fashioned radio by the fridge and it blared out a clumsy mixture of pop songs and news headlines.<br />
<br />
“Lean in,” Carlos whispered to all of us. We did. My leg brushed against his and my inner-gay-self squealed.<br />
<br />
“Right, what the fuck is going on? Why did our dicks grow?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Who says mine grew?” asked Mike, smiling, “maybe mine’s always been this big.”<br />
<br />
“You wish,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Then tell us, wonderboy,” said Mike, “you know something.”<br />
<br />
They all stared at me. It was turning me on again. Carlos had such beautiful eyes.<br />
<br />
I spilled the beans. As Dad hummed along to the radio in the background, I told them everything I knew, which honestly wasn’t much. I told them about the pink light last night, and that was pretty much it. Not exactly a encyclopaedia of lore to work with. They clearly weren’t satisfied with my answer but believed I knew nothing else. We kept our conversation quiet so Dad couldn’t hear us.<br />
<br />
“So what do we do then?” asked Carlos, “I can’t have a dick this big, I’ve got swim practice today! How the hell am I supposed to fit this in a speedo when it’s rock-hard?! What if it happens again?!”<br />
<br />
“Also, it’s getting, uhh…uncomfortable,” said Stevie, “I can’t keep it down.”<br />
<br />
Stevie made a good point. It was like our bodies were controlling us rather than the other way around. I know I was getting hornier with every minute that passed. The image of Carlos in a speedo made my balls ache. <i> God I need this man. </i>  But he asked a good question.<br />
<br />
“We just need to find out what’s causing it and stop it,” I said, which was met with a few nods.<br />
<br />
“Well I don’t mind it,” smirked Mike, “my girlfriend’ll love it. Actually, it could be a bit bigger.”<br />
<br />
 <i> CRASH! </i> <br />
<br />
Just then, another lightning strike hit the shed. It startled us as much as it did the first time, and made Dad yelp out in surprise.<br />
<br />
“Bloody hell! That was close!” he yelled.<br />
<br />
“Oh, guys?” whispered Stevie, “that lightning looked awfully pink.”<br />
<br />
He was right and, with no warning, we felt a familiar tingle at the tip of our cocks. We stifled any moans and gripped the table hard as we collectively felt a quick rush of pleasure, like an orgasm. We kept as quiet as we could so Dad didn’t hear us, but it caught us by surprise. We groaned very softly as our dicks grew AGAIN by another few inches until they reached a foot long. <i> 12 inches! </i> Mine felt thicker too, and my balls had swelled a few sizes larger. My bulge was starting to look completely ridiculous.<br />
<br />
No matter how hard I resisted the urge to jerk off right there, it’s as if it didn’t matter. The fabric of my shorts were grinding against my shaft as it throbbed, and it was sending me hurtling towards a climax. The rest of the guys were feeling the same and the air around us turned warm and started to smell musky. <br />
<br />
Dad hadn’t noticed, thank god. He was scanning the garden for the lightning, noticing the stormy clouds and the rain, tutting.<br />
<br />
“It’s pouring it down out there! I’m gonna need my trusty umbrella. Be right back boys.”<br />
<br />
He said as he swiftly turned to leave he finally noticed us all crowded around the table. He scowled; a rare sight.<br />
<br />
“What are you boys doing there?” he asked.<br />
<br />
We froze. None of us could think of an answer except for Mike, who turned to face my father with a forced smile and an artificially jolly tune in his voice.<br />
<br />
“Talking about um, studying. Yeah! We wanna cram as much in as we can today!”<br />
<br />
Dad pondered the answer for a moment and then smiled back.<br />
<br />
“Excellent work! Keep it up and soon you boys will grow into fine men of science!”<br />
<br />
<i> Oh, we’re growing alright. </i><br />
<br />
Dad swiftly exited the kitchen and went back upstairs. His departure allowed us to feel a bit more at ease, but we still felt incredibly pent up. The sheer intensity was making me sweat, as it did Mike, whose forehead was now shining under the kitchen light.<br />
<br />
“Fuck guys,” he said, “I don’t know how much longer I can hold it in. If I move an inch I might blow a load right here and now.”<br />
<br />
“It’s the lightning!” said Stevie almost loud enough for Dad to probably hear it upstairs, “it has to be! Every time it strikes the shed we grow!”<br />
<br />
“What’s, ahh…” Carlos trailed off as he took a breath. I didn’t dare look below his waist; I’d cum instantly if I saw it up this close, “what’s in the shed?”<br />
<br />
We all looked out the window and saw the tiny building in the garden. It looked mundane in the rain, except for something rather odd. One of its front windows was smashed, the cracks of the glass circling around a tiny hole. Something had pierced right through it. At the time I assumed it was just a rock or bird or something. I should’ve looked closer.<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” I said, “just an armchair and some books. Dad and I use it to get away from stuff, and—“<br />
<br />
 <i> CRASH! </i> <br />
<br />
Before I could finish, we jumped in our seats as pink lightning hit the shed. The bright flash of light blinded our eyes.<br />
<br />
“Oh boy, time to test your theory,” Mike said to Stevie, who looked increasingly nervous.<br />
<br />
We braced ourselves. Instead of a tingling sensation, we watched in horror as—<br />
<br />
 <i> CRASH! </i> <br />
<br />
Pink lightning hit the shed. <i> AGAIN. </i>   Twice. In a row!<br />
<br />
<i> We’re fucked. </i><br />
<br />
“Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck!” Stevie began hyperventilating as we all braced for impact. <br />
<br />
“Guys, I can’t hold it—“<br />
<br />
Mike was about to speak but just as he did we felt the tingling sensation return, only more so. With Dad upstairs we didn’t need to stifle anything, and we let out a collective groan as we felt our cocks slither further down our leg. It just kept going, growing a few inches, and then another few inches. When it started poking out of the legs of my shorts I could feel the open air brush teasingly against the tip, and I exhaled at the feeling. Our dicks grew a lot more than before, reaching around a foot-and-a-half of thick, solid, meat. My balls were taking up even more space between my legs too. My shaft was so thick I could feel my heartbeat through it pound against my thigh. <br />
<br />
The smell of precum wafted into our noses. Precum that wasn’t mine. I looked up to see the strained faces of my friends staring intensely at the table. They looked like they were going through torture, and with balls as big as ours and hormones as raging, in a way they were.<br />
<br />
Mike tried to stand up.<br />
<br />
“Guys I’m gonna fucking blow!” he said loudly.<br />
<br />
“Stop moving! You’re making my leg rub against mine!” said Stevie through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
“I gotta get out of here. I gotta oh…oh fuck! I’m…I’m…CUMMING!”<br />
<br />
The poor guy couldn’t hold it in any longer. Mike sounded breathless as he let out a loud, piercing moan. From where I was sitting, I couldn’t see his cock, but I could hear thick spurts of cum shoot from it and into his pyjamas. He gripped the table for dear life as his legs gave up and he collapsed back into his chair. His head fell back and his mouth fell open. His loads just kept coming and cumming. To the point where I could hear his loads drip from his legs and onto the floor. The smell was so intoxicating. Sure he was my lifelong friend. Sure he had a girlfriend. But in that moment, smelling his cum, smelling <i> him </i> , I knew I needed something.<br />
<br />
<i> I needed to get my hands around a fat, juicy cock. </i><br />
<br />
It seemed to have the same effect on Stevie, who started to panic.<br />
<br />
“Stop it ‘cuz if you’re cumming then I’m…gonna…oh fuck here it comes…oh fuck oh fuck oh FUCK!” he yelled.<br />
<br />
I watched as his now foot-and-a-half-long bulge in his jeans pumped seed out, drenched his thin, shaking leg. The denim darkened so quickly, getting so soaked and so weak one of his loads shot straight out from it and hit Mike in the calf, who was too spaced out to care. I could tell the boys were having the best orgasm ever; their eyes were rolled back and their mouths agape. They looked like they had gone to another plane of existence.<br />
<br />
I was starting to lose sense myself. It felt like I had sat there with an aching cock for so long I forgot why I was even holding it in. I tensed every fibre of my being to resist, but then I looked at Carlos beside me.<br />
<br />
“It’s just us two left,” he said.<br />
<br />
He seemed more in control than the others. More in-control than I was anyway. I gave in. I looked down below his waist, and my eyes widened like a pirate seeing treasure for the first time. It looked like he was smuggling a whole-ass pipe in his sweatpants. His cock reached beyond his knee, and I could make the outline of the wet tip. He had one hand down his trousers to cup his balls which looked like he was struggling to hold in one hand. <br />
<br />
<i> It’s within reach, it’s so big, seize your chance now! Grab it. </i><br />
<br />
My eyes slowly wandered up to his beautiful, sweaty face, and I realised he was staring right back at me. An intensely silent stare with narrow eyes. <br />
<br />
<i> What have you got to lose? Grab it. </i><br />
<br />
His gaze darted between mine and my cock, his breathing becoming quicker. I saw the corner of his mouth curl into a subtle smile. <br />
<br />
Was he…was he checking me out? There’s no way.<br />
<br />
<i> Grab it. </i><br />
<br />
But he was straight.<br />
<br />
<i> Grab it! </i><br />
<br />
Still, that was all I needed.<br />
<br />
 <i> GRAB IT! </i> <br />
<br />
I grabbed it.<br />
<br />
Before I knew it my hands were wrapped around his bulge and I was rubbing his thick shaft with a great eagerness. The adrenaline rushed to my brain and he jumped in his chair.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?!” he yelled.<br />
<br />
Still, I continued. I gripped his meat with both hands and jerked him off like my life depended on it, feeling it swell in my grip as it throbbed. My fingers ran over pulsating veins that zig-zagged along from its base to its tip. Even though I couldn’t see it through the sweatpants, I could feel it; Carlos’ dick in all of its thick, meaty glory.<br />
<br />
To my surprise, he didn’t stop me. Rather, he gently placed a hand on my shoulder. His breathing grew deeper as he closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Holy fuck,” he said, “fuck I’m gonna…OH GOD!”<br />
<br />
He gripped my shoulder tightly as I felt a huge pulse from the base of his cock. He joined the cacophony of moans as a huge stream of cum shot out and splashed against the inside of his sweatpants. <br />
<br />
He came with a tremendous force. A force so strong it looked like his loads were going to tear a hole in his trousers. Watching it was enough for me to follow suite. I felt the rush travel through my body and straight to my exposed tip.<br />
<br />
“OHHH MY GOD!”<br />
<br />
The orgasm was i like anything I had ever felt. It made my limbs go numb and my mind go blank. I ran out of thoughts, or rather the hormones were blocking any out of my head. All I could do was revel in the moment as the first load shoot out like bullet in a chamber. Then the second. Then the third. Then I lost count. Each one firing directly across the table, hitting both Stevie and Mike in both of their legs. Spurts flew out from under the table too, launching a few feet outwards like an explosion. The kitchen floor was getting drenched. It just kept coming. And coming. And cumming. I wasn’t sure if I was ever going to run out. I doubt I wanted to run out in that moment. <br />
<br />
Sadly, however, it did.<br />
<br />
We soon felt the blissful release of what felt like a lifetime of orgasming. My dick started to shrink back to somewhat manageable levels. All we could hear were our breaths, our hearts pounding out of our chests, and cum dripping onto the floor in puddles. When we all regained our senses, we gave each other an embarrassed grimace. We barely talked about sex before this, and there we sat, our loads still trickling down our legs.<br />
<br />
“O…,” said Stevie, trying to muster up the energy to speak, “okay…I think that’s…that’s it.”<br />
<br />
“Holy shit…” said Mike, his eyes still closed, “that…was…a lot.”<br />
<br />
He tried to wipe away what was the loads of three different people off his leg.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, it’s everywhere. Your dad’s gonna kill us,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Carlos,” said Stevie, “I need to look at your tattoo.”<br />
<br />
Carlos’ head was flung back in his chair, but had his gaze fixed on me. His face slowly morphed from breathless to anger. He scowled.<br />
<br />
<i> Fuck. What have I done? </i><br />
<br />
“Why?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Because,” said Stevie, trying to stand up, “I think I recognise it.”</p>
