<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marks weight loose wasent the only new change to the guy his face that had two days of thick beard stuble was now as smooth as a babys ass and his beer buying
<br>
 days were now way ahead of him now! It would be along time before he could just walk in a store and buy beer now! It would be a very long time indeed! He
<br>
 would now be carded for a very long time even when he was of age he would still be carded! His once very mature face was now the more rounded face of a
<br>
 kids! And poor Stan he would have been carded for along time without the dares affects anyway but now he too looked more like a 14 year old then the big
<br>
 handsome 17 yearold he was! 
<br>

<br>
 Kyles dad finally came home with the adult diepers and Kyle was shown how to use them! He was humiliated how could Jennefer do this to him! But at leist he
<br>
 wouldnt be the only guy at school in diepers now! Mark and Stan would be forced to wear theses damb things as well Kyle thought and went to bed! Only their
<br>
 fate was abit more drastick then his was! 
<br>

<br>
 All three guys had releived themselves during the night but Mark and Stan werent as prepared with this event as Kyle was and the two still nicely muscled studs
<br>
 woke up to very wet sheets and beds! While Kyle woke up with a heavy soaked dieper and only minor leakage to his sheets! But still the whole idea of haveing to
<br>
 wear diepers to bed pissed Kyle off bad! Jennefer would pay for this cruel trick! Kyle cleaned up and put on his dieper it was huge and would be almost
<br>
 impossable to hide in his pants Kyle hated this shit but finally found a pair of pants that hid it fairly well and went off to school Jennefer was going to pay for this
<br>
 shit! 
<br>

<br>
 Kyle forgot one thing about adult diepers though! You need to bring an extra just in case the one your wearing gets used! Poor Kyle was halfway through his third
<br>
 hour class when he felt himself going in the dieper he turned britght red and about leaped out of his chair when it started! But he thought he was protected and as he
<br>
 pissed uncontrolably he cringed, it just didnt stop he seemed to be going and going! There just had to be a limit to how much one of these things held and in his
<br>
 mind he was panicing badly, Kyle was shifting in his seat as he just contiued to piss and piss! Whens this going to stop he thought as it finally began to stop! 
<br>

<br>
 Poor Kyle was as red as you could be and it showed! The girl directly behind him could hear the piss as it filled Kyles dieper and she busted out laughing! &quot;Your
<br>
 wearing a dieper arnt you Kyle?&quot; She said loud enough for half the room to hear her! Kyle was ready to just die there was no way to hide his bright red face of
<br>
 emberissment and the deiper hadnt done it job as it should have and poor Kyles crotch was soaked it had leaked! And now poor Kyle had to stand up in front of
<br>
 the whole class and leive it with very wet jeans! His 550s were soaked all around the crtch area and Kyle could feel some of it leaking down his legs! 
<br>

<br>
 Jennefer had got him good this time and now the whole school would know of this happening, Jennefer had stayed away from school for the rest of that week as
<br>
 did both Mark and Stan! 
<br>

<br>
 Both the guys had been taken to see doctors who had no clues as to why the guys could no longer hold their own bladders, and their voices were dissmissed as
<br>
 just a weird occurance, as far as their child like phases that could just be both guys way of dealing with there sudden loss of bladder control and seemingly
<br>
 unknown weight loss. The doctors told their parents that getting the guys back into school would be theriputic for the guys! It might restore their confidence and
<br>
 speach patterns if the guys had to mingle with kids their age! As far as their bladder control problems went it looked like something had just weaken their control
<br>
 and in time they thought the two could be potty trained all over again! That was all the doctors could do for the guys! And both familys decided it would be best if
<br>
 the guys went back to school dispite their reluctance to do so! 
<br>

<br>
 One month had passed since Jennefer had turned Kyle into a dieper wearing teen prone to accidental leaking and constant changes! Kyle had given up most of his
<br>
 sporting ciriculume and it had taken its toll on his body as well his muscles that were comeing around quite nicely before 
<br>
 Jennefers curse were now shrinking back down in size since Kyle gave up his weight lifting regiment after two terrable accidents in the middle of two different lifts! 
<br>

<br>
 Mark and Stan were also back in school again, but they two played different rolls then the ones they had played before Mark wasent the big jock babe magnet he
<br>
 was so used to being and poor Stan was no longer one of the big jocks anymore! The two hung around with only themselves now and most of the kids at the
<br>
 school made fun of all three dieper wearing guys! 
<br>

<br>
 Mark suffered the most though he had lost the most as well Here he was a big guy still but no real muscles to speak of and no real defence against guys who he had
<br>
 treated badly in the past, by big we're not talking strong just tall Mark had droped in weight form 195Lbs down to 125Lbs all still on a tall 5'11 inch frame he was
<br>
 now a skinny dieper wearing freak who both sounded and even talked like a big baby! Mark knew it was Kyle who did this to him but now neither Stan or Mark
<br>
 were big enough to fight him! 
<br>

<br>
 Mark had tryed to go back to weight lifting but a very awful accident that had him shit his dieper in the middle of a weak 35Lbs lift had ruined his come back
<br>
 attempt Poor Mark was ragged very baddly as the smell of his shitty dieper forced all the now stronger guys from the weight room! Mark was asked not to come
<br>
 back and he hadent! Poor Stan and Mark were now called the dynamic diepered duo! And Jennefer had joined a private school and that left Kyle in diepers for
<br>
 along time indeed!</p>
