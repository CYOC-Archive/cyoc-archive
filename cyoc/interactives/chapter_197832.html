<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Gemory, please don&#39;t come unless you&#39;re free, I don&#39;t want to be a pest, but I&#39;d like to talk to you.”  Jamie had pulled some chairs into her Dad&#39;s workshop and was sitting in one.<br />
<br />
There was a flash of light, and Gemory appeared.  She looked older, closer to 12.  She was wearing a white pantsuit, with some expensive-looking heels.  Her hair was well brushed, and tied behind her head into a long ponytail.  “Ah, Jamie, how can I help you?”<br />
<br />
“Thank you for coming.  You look really good tonight.”<br />
<br />
Gemory smiled.  “Yes.  Well Danielle&#39;s magic is wearing off, but I think I rather like looking young.  It throws people off a little.  I&#39;ll have to find out what she thinks, of course.”<br />
<br />
“Huh.  I could make Kelly younger if I wanted, couldn&#39;t I?”  <br />
<br />
“Indeed you could!  The options to punish her are fairly open-ended, I didn&#39;t know how brightly your rage would burn.  For example, if you wanted, you could turn her into an unborn baby and exile her into another woman&#39;s womb.”  Gemory grinned.<br />
<br />
“What?  Oh...uh...that&#39;s...” Jamie wanted to say horrible, but then again...what would that be like?  “Uh, anyways, I was hoping to renegotiate our deal.”<br />
<br />
Gemory raised an eyebrow.  “Oh?  Not satisfied?  I thought I was being extremely kind.”<br />
<br />
“No no, you were, it&#39;s just...I want to start working for you now.”  Jamie held up her hands.<br />
<br />
“Reallly?”  Gemory drew out the word.  “In what capacity?”<br />
<br />
“I want a position in sales.”  She then went on to tell Gemory about Rachel.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gemory sat back in the chair, a thoughtful expression on her face.  “So, you want to offer Rachel a deal.  You know, I could go to her, or even send an agent...why do you want to do this?”<br />
<br />
“I...I just realized, there are so many people like me out there.  They&#39;ve been hurt, they&#39;ve been abused.  There&#39;s no one to help them.  And if I keep finding them, then, why not steer them in your direction?”  Jamie sighed.  “Maybe that&#39;s a sin.  I don&#39;t know.  But it&#39;s like Danielle said.”<br />
<br />
“In for a penny, in for a pound.  Well, I like it.  But no offense, Jamie, you&#39;ll need training to become an agent.  Also, you&#39;d have to become a demon a lot faster than you intended.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, so I&#39;d have to go to Hell?”  Jamie frowned.<br />
<br />
“Some demons can remain on Earth without being summoned.  You could become one of those.  I think you&#39;d be an adorable Succubus!”  Gemory smiled.<br />
<br />
“A...Succubus?  But they...they seduce people, right?”<br />
<br />
“Normally, yes, but I&#39;ve come to realize there is room for variations- there are other ways to bring comfort than merely the pleasures of the flesh.  I&#39;ll let you think about that.  In the meantime, however...”  She got up and handed Jamie a business card.  “This is my card.  You can use it to summon me whenever you think there&#39;s a good opportunity to make a deal.”<br />
<br />
“You?  I...mean, thank you, but surely you&#39;re busy...”  Jamie stammered.<br />
<br />
“I am.  But I&#39;ve decided to train you myself, as my protege.”  Gemory winked.<br />
<br />
Jamie bowed her head.  “Thank you, my...Duke, wasn&#39;t it?”<br />
<br />
Gemory seemed pleased.  “Yes, that&#39;s right.  I wasn&#39;t created with a gender, and I can be male if I want...though...I doubt I ever will again.  I&#39;m happy being female, and Danielle prefers ladies anyways.”<br />
<br />
“There was something else, too.  I know I&#39;m pushing my luck here.  But it&#39;s why I wanted to go to work right away.”<br />
<br />
“Go on, my dear.”<br />
<br />
“I want another ring.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, adding this Rachel girl to your harem?”  Gemory grinned.<br />
<br />
“Not exactly.  I want this ring to make Rachel into Kelly&#39;s slave.”<br />
<br />
Gemory nodded slowly.  “How interesting.  I like it.  Done.”  She produced another ring, identical to the first.  <br />
<br />
“Uh, should I, I don&#39;t know, do more than bow to you?”  Jamie asked.<br />
<br />
“Would kissing my feet be too demeaning?”  Gemory showed teeth.<br />
<br />
Jamie got down on her hands and knees, and kissed the tops of Gemory&#39;s feet.  They were clean, and scent of the demoness was pleasant.<br />
<br />
She felt a hand rest on her head with affection.  “I&#39;ve changed my mind.  I&#39;m definitely making you a demon.  I&#39;ll have to get a form designed just for you- the one I&#39;m working on right now might not be right for you.”<br />
<br />
Jamie didn&#39;t move.  “What is it, my Duke?”<br />
<br />
“Well, my recent experience with a child form made me realize there was quite a bit more to the concept of non-sexual intimacy.  So I&#39;m having my expert create a younger looking variant of a Succubus, cute as a button and perfect for cuddling.”<br />
<br />
“Would I have to look like that all the time?  Like, could I still look like I do now?”  Jamie asked.<br />
<br />
“Hm.  I don&#39;t see why not, why, are you volunteering?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, my Duke.  I am.”<br />
<br />
“Then pack your bags, kiddo, we&#39;re going to Hell.”<br />
<br />
<br />
She was falling.  There was darkness all around her.  She was naked, she realized, and the wind whipping around her felt...almost pleasant.  It was warm.<br />
<br />
She eventually saw a reddish glow beneath her.  Then tall, black mountains appeared, and rivers and pools of lava.  She saw naked, desperate human forms scuttling about, while small imps chased them.<br />
<br />
She was caught by strong arms.<br />
<br />
“Ah no, you aren&#39;t going there.  My Mistress wants you.”  A female voice.<br />
<br />
Jamie was then held close, and she felt a pair of breasts against her back.  She heard wingbeats as she was carried downwards.<br />
<br />
“What...I&#39;m sorry..who are you?”  She asked.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not an Angel, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking.”  The voice sounded amused.  “I&#39;m Edira.  I&#39;m an Erinyes.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know what that is.”  Jamie admitted.<br />
<br />
“In ancient times, we were seen as Goddesses of Vengeance.  The Furies.”<br />
<br />
“Oh!  The Kindly Ones!”  Jamie exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Ah, you have heard of us!”  Edira seemed pleased.<br />
<br />
“Ah, well, I&#39;m a Sandman fan.”<br />
<br />
“Oh are you?  I love Neil Gaiman&#39;s work!”<br />
<br />
<br />
The two chatted about Sandman and other things until they reached a majestic palace surrounded by desert.  Edira was a very tall, slender woman, built like a runner.  She had two black wings, dark hair and dark eyes, and she was very lovely.  She was also, Jamie realized, also naked.<br />
<br />
Jamie blushed and looked away, but Edira (who was easily over 6&#39; tall) simply placed her hands on Jamie&#39;s chin and turned the girl to face her.  “Don&#39;t look away.  If you find me attractive, I&#39;m flattered.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, um, sorry.  Yes, I do, you&#39;re very pretty.”<br />
<br />
Edira leaned in and kissed Jamie.  “Well then, once you&#39;ve been transformed, call me anytime.  You&#39;re cute.”<br />
<br />
Jamie&#39;s knees felt weak and she could only nod dumbly.  “Wait...uh, how?”<br />
<br />
Edira laughed.  “Just say my name.  I&#39;ll hear you.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, Eryines can go to Earth without being summoned?”<br />
<br />
“Indeed we can, though it&#39;s rare we do so.  Usually when we go to Earth, it&#39;s because someone has gotten our attention.  Now come along, cutie, you have a date with Minuet.”<br />
<br />
She was brought to a large room.  It was lit by braziers, and there were comfortable pillows everywhere.  Beautiful nude demons, most female, some male, others...a bit of both, each inhuman in one way or another, were entertaining themselves in some fashion or another (there was a -lot- of sex going on, which made Jamie blush from arousal).  She could hear voices.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, who&#39;s that with Edira?  A mortal?  She&#39;s cute.  Is she going to join us?  I can&#39;t wait to break her in!”<br />
<br />
Jamie found she rather wanted to be “broke in”, whatever that entailed.<br />
<br />
This was obviously a harem.  She&#39;d never seen one before, but this is roughly what she imagined.  She noticed the room rose like steps, and soon, she reached the top level.<br />
<br />
There, lazily sprawled out on a pile of pillows was a pair of beautiful women...wait.  That wasn&#39;t right.<br />
<br />
One of the women didn&#39;t have a -head-!  In fact, as one of them rose, she realized that one didn&#39;t have legs...because where her body below the waist should be, simply replaced the head of the other one!<br />
<br />
To call the creature beautiful was an understatement.  Every bit of her body was flawless and perfect.  She tried to compare her to Gemory.  Where Gemory was awe-inspiring, and exuded an aura of power and confidence, this woman...<br />
<br />
From her slow, sultry movements, to her large breasts (all four of them) and seductive gaze, this woman exuded an aura of lust and exotic, forbidden desires.  She felt aroused and vaguely repulsed...her body filled with need...and fear.<br />
<br />
“Lady Minuet.”  Edira went to one knee.  “As requested, I bring you the mortal, Jamie.”<br />
<br />
Minuet regarded Jamie.  “You&#39;re older than I would have chosen.  Not all that innocent either.  Still, there is a spark of purity there.  Do you understand what is to happen to you?”<br />
<br />
“Not completely.  I know I&#39;m going to become a demon.  A new type that Gemory had designed..by you, I&#39;m guessing?”  Jamie said<br />
<br />
Though slow moving on the ground, Minuet proved to have reflexes like a striking cobra as she reached out and grabbed Jamie by the neck.  “Impudent!  You need to learn your place!  I am Minuet.  Mistress of the Harem.  In this room, Gemory is your GOD, and I am her High Priestess!”<br />
<br />
Jamie whimpered as she was forced to her knees.  “I...I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to offend you.”<br />
<br />
Minuet let her neck go.  “Tch.  Sadly, it is I who must apologize.  Milady asked that you be not harmed.”<br />
<br />
“No, please don&#39;t.  I understand.  You&#39;re in charge, and by speaking to you as an equal, I undermine your authority.  You should punish me.”  Jamie didn&#39;t -want- to be punished, but she really wanted to stay on Minuet&#39;s good side.<br />
<br />
Minuet purred softly as she stroked Jamie&#39;s cheek.  “It seems I spoke too soon.  You do have manners, and good sense.  Well, I can&#39;t harm you...Gemory would swap my head with my ass if I did, and that&#39;s -if- she was feeling kind.”<br />
<br />
Jamie couldn&#39;t help herself.  She started giggling at the thought of Minuet with a butt where her head should be.<br />
<br />
Edira snickered softly, and, after a moment, Minuet chuckled as well.  “I do have a way with words, don&#39;t I?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Lady Minuet.”  Jamie admitted.<br />
<br />
“Well again, I can&#39;t hurt you, but there are other ways to punish you.  You see, I am an Erodaemon.  In life, my twin souls used their sex appeal not to corrupt, but as a weapon, to fuel their ambitions.  So in Hell, they were merged to create the body you see before you.  Do you find me grotesque?”<br />
<br />
“No, Lady Minuet.  I mean, seeing you was a shock, but you&#39;re quite beautiful.”<br />
<br />
“Are you saying you would like to have sex with me?”  The demoness smiled.<br />
<br />
“...yes.”  Jamie admitted.<br />
<br />
“Hm.  But you would also like to have sex with Edira.  You&#39;re a bit repressed, aren&#39;t you?”<br />
<br />
“Yes to both questions, Milady.”<br />
<br />
“Well, you see, part of my curse is, despite my truly exceptional intellect, I am often crippled by my physical needs.  For your punishment, you will pleasure me.  If I find your efforts satisfactory, all will be forgiven.  Edira, to make this more palatable for her, would you care to pleasure Jamie at the same time?”<br />
<br />
“Oh very much.”  Edira smiled.<br />
<br />
Jamie gulped.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jamie found herself on her knees, her legs spread, straddling Edira&#39;s head.  Edira&#39;s strong hands gripped her thighs, supporting her.  Before her, Minuet had laid down, to her full length.  If she was capable of standing, she would be easily 10&#39; tall, Jamie was certain, but her body construction wouldn&#39;t allow that without support.<br />
<br />
Minuet was already playing with her two pairs of breasts- they were large, but not comically so.  Jamie was between Minuet&#39;s legs, staring down at her vagina.  It was bare, without a trace of pubic hair, and the scent of her was overpowering- not unpleasant, but Jamie could feel an alien lust come over her.<br />
<br />
Though she had never done this before, she was a bright and imaginative girl.  She leaned in and began to probe the Erodaemon with her tongue, gripping Minuet&#39;s perfect thighs.<br />
<br />
As she began, she felt Edira do the same to her, and it was incredible!  She found it hard to move, but she knew she had to complete her task, even with a hot tongue inserted into her own body.<br />
<br />
Jamie tried to separate the intense pleasure wracking her body from her conscious mind, focusing on her work.  She could hear Minuet moan softly, and she realized the sounds the demoness made would help her figure out what she should do more of!<br />
<br />
Minutes stretched into eternity, and she felt her strength failing.  It was so warm in here!  She was very close to giving out, when Minuet finally came.  Something warm and wet hit Jamie in the face, and she managed to clean the demon out, the taste of her driving her on, before she herself came, and she collapsed, her face laying against Minuet&#39;s crotch.<br />
<br />
She faded in and out of consciousness, and when she came to, she was laying on Minuet&#39;s body, her head pillowed between her second pair of breasts.<br />
<br />
Edira lay atop her, her own head laying on Jamie&#39;s chest.  Despite her height, the Eryinyes seemed to weigh almost nothing.  She could feel hands playing with her hair...Minuet&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
She sighed contentedly.  She&#39;d never imagined she would be in a cuddle pile with two other women- let along such beauties as these two.  She definitely wanted to do this with Kelly...and perhaps Rachel as well!<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Jamie.  I wasn&#39;t expecting such results on your first try.”  Minuet murmured.<br />
<br />
“Milady praises me, I&#39;m certain you&#39;ve had better.”<br />
<br />
“Oh it&#39;s true, but there is something to be said for youthful enthusiasm.  Your effort has not only erased your debt, but I think you deserve a reward.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Milady, but the way Edira made me feel was a reward.”<br />
<br />
Edira giggled, a surprisingly girlish sound from the tall Fury.  “She thinks that was a reward!?”<br />
<br />
Minuet laughed as well.  “My dear, that was supposed to be part of your punishment, to make things harder for you.  You say you enjoyed it?”<br />
<br />
“Who wouldn&#39;t?!” Jamie said.<br />
<br />
“Damn it, why did Gemory find her first?  I want to keep her!” Edira whined.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d fight you for her, I think.  Though I can have my pick of the harem, none here are truly mine.”  Minuet said.<br />
<br />
Jamie blushed.  “Um, I wouldn&#39;t mind if you both shared me.”<br />
<br />
Edira shifted position, kissing Jamie.  “Oh dear, both of us at once?  You&#39;d probably die!”<br />
<br />
“It would be a good test of her new body.  Which, on that note, I need to take advantage of this brief moment of satiation.  Edira, if you could pick her up?  I doubt she can walk.”<br />
<br />
The Erinyes scooped her up into a bridal carry, and Jamie put her arms around the demon&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
Minuet rolled over, and hoisted herself up.  Her body had to be very strong!  She then crawled to a door which opened to it&#39;s own accord, and Jamie found herself in the Erodaemon&#39;s workshop.<br />
<br />
She was lowered into a glass tub of warm liquid.  It wasn&#39;t water, or oil, but something in-between.  It was thick, and the heat made her drowsy.<br />
<br />
“Let me explain what is about to happen to you, Jamie.  Your mortal body is going to lose it&#39;s shape, becoming nothing more than a blob of flesh.  The experience is remarkably like being back in the womb, though you probably don&#39;t remember the first time.  Your soul will be extracted, and I will shape it with my hands like so much putty.  I can make this process either pleasant or painful- but since you were such a good girl, I&#39;m going to take my time and make it very pleasant for you.  Then, once the soul has it&#39;s new shape, I will place it back into the vat of your old flesh, which will have been purified, and you will instinctively create a new body for yourself.<br />
<br />
However, as a demon, even if your flesh body is destroyed, you will have the ability to contruct a new one.”<br />
<br />
The soft drone of Minuet&#39;s voice soon made Jamie pass out, even as her body lost it&#39;s form and she existed as a doughy blob of flesh.<br />
<br />
Then she felt herself being lifted up, a cold, shivering thing, somehow more naked than she&#39;d ever been.  Pleasure ripped through her being like knives, but she couldn&#39;t make a sound!  The sensations were so incredible, so all-consuming, that she forgot who and what she was.<br />
<br />
She existed to feel pleasure.  No mind, no thoughts.  Just an endless, silent orgasm...<br />
<br />
<br />
Her eyes opened.  She couldn&#39;t bring herself to move, so she just lay there.  She was staring at a ceiling made of...plaster, perhaps?  She was laying on a bed, the mattress as soft as a cloud.  <br />
<br />
“Well, look who&#39;s awake.”  Minuet was staring down at her with a soft smile.<br />
<br />
“Milady...” her voice was weak, but it sounded softer, yet also higher-pitched.<br />
<br />
“Ah yes, you no doubt feel very weak.  You need to feed.  Come here.”  Surprisingly strong arms lifted her up and held her.  Jamie was pressed against a pair of majestic breasts, but rather than lust, she simply felt happy to cuddle.<br />
<br />
“Now, how does that feel?”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Good.”  She smiled.  And it did.  She felt nourished, as if she was absorbing energy directly from Minuet&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
“I didn&#39;t disable your sex drive, by the way.  It&#39;s still present, but this is your primary means of regaining energy.  Simple, physical intimacy.  This is what you want, and this is what you crave.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Milady.”  She sighed happily.  “I have...well, I will have...a girlfriend.  Maybe two.  I&#39;ll need to...do more than just cuddle.”<br />
<br />
“Have no fear of that, little one.”  Minuet set her on her feet, and Jamie realized she was shorter than before.  “Come, I have a mirror for you.”<br />
<br />
Following the slow-moving Erodaemon, Jamie founds herself staring into a full-length mirror.  Her brown hair had lightened in color, and she now had two blonde streaks that started above her eyes- eyes that were now amber in color.  Her hair was longer as well, cascading down her back, just about reaching her waist.<br />
<br />
She was unbelievably pretty, and looked so young...like a doll.  She guessed herself to be almost 12, with little AA cup breasts.  Her skin had a healthy glow about it, and everything looked...soft.<br />
<br />
Her tummy was flat and taut, and her hips were about the same as they had been before, though her waist was narrower.  Her pelvic bones were quite prominent as well.  She smiled at her reflection.  “I&#39;m so pretty!”<br />
<br />
“Yes you are, my dear.  Originally the plan was to make you younger, but I thought keeping some traces of maturity might be better for you.  Of course, you can change into different forms, including your old one, as needed.”<br />
<br />
Turning to look at herself from different angles, she saw she had small black wings, resembling Edira&#39;s.  She tried to move them, and found they were quite responsive.  “I can&#39;t fly, can I?”<br />
<br />
“You can, but you&#39;re not very good at it, I&#39;m afraid.  A common Succubus trait.  You may evolve down the line to grow larger ones.  No tail, I felt it wasn&#39;t necessary, but you do have a few other features.  First, is the beguiling gaze- just lock eyes with someone, and their willpower will break down, and they will become very suggestible.  Also, your scent and touch have a soporific effect- just enough to relax someone and make them more passive.”<br />
<br />
“Does that work for taste, too?”  Jamie giggled.<br />
<br />
“Yes, though your prey probably shouldn&#39;t be licking or nibbling on you.  You don&#39;t have talons- the average Succubus has very sharp fingernails, but your eyeteeth are hollow.  If you bite someone, you inject endorphins into the target&#39;s system that triggers their pleasure centers and disables their ability to feel pain.  That should be sufficient to make someone putty in your hands.”<br />
<br />
“Ooh.  I can&#39;t wait to try that on someone.”  Jamie bounced on the balls of her feet.  She felt so lightweight and nimble, unlike her old, clutzy self.<br />
<br />
“I took the liberty to program contact information for myself and Edira into your phone, as well as this number.  You can&#39;t call it by accident, it&#39;s only usable if you, Gemory, or any of her servants are in danger.”<br />
<br />
“Does that include Danielle?”  Jamie asked.<br />
<br />
Minuet frowned.  “Yes, I suppose it does, even though I have yet to meet this mystery girl that has captured my Lady&#39;s heart.  At any rate, that number contacts Belzazel, Gemory&#39;s second-in-command.  You call that, and all the forces of Hell will come running.”<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s Belzazel like?”<br />
<br />
“Complex.  Right now, she looks like...an older sister, I guess.  Serene, calm, gentle, but all that silk hides steel.  But her usual, preferred form, is a giant, muscle-bound, hulk of a woman.  Still pretty, in an amazon kind of way.  But she&#39;s also a functioning hermaphrodite with a dick as big as her breasts.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.  Oh wow.”  Jamie had no idea what it would be like to have a dick, but a part of her was curious now.<br />
<br />
“Wow, indeed.  In life, she was marginalized and abused by men.  So as a demon, she likes having the strength to push others around.  Though she&#39;s not a bully by any means, even if she seems fearsome.”  Minuet explained.<br />
<br />
“So how tall am I?”  Jamie asked.  “I don&#39;t need glasses anymore, that&#39;s cool too.”<br />
<br />
“At the moment, you&#39;re 4&#39; 4” tall.  You can vary that, if you like, of course.  And yes, devils have excellent vision, including the ability to see in darkness.”<br />
<br />
“Wow, so small?”  She did a pirouette, testing her new agility.<br />
<br />
“Well, I concluded small size is very useful for your method of feeding.  The smaller and younger looking the better, most likely.  But since you&#39;re the first, I will be expecting regular reports on your experiences.  Indeed, you&#39;re so new, we don&#39;t even have a proper name for your demon type yet.”<br />
<br />
“Are there doll demons already?”<br />
<br />
“Ugh, yes, Arusities.  Childlike devils that can impersonate dolls.  They have the insidious ability to turn mortals into more of their kind.  Currently, deploying them is banned because of that ability.  Heaven feels it&#39;s a bridge too far- if we turn a soul to Hell, that&#39;s one thing, but forcing someone to turn into a demon?  It didn&#39;t help that the last time one got loose on Earth, she spread her curse like a plague.  Quite the mess to clean up.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.  Never mind then.”<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry, something will come up.  At any rate, it&#39;s time for you to return to Earth, I&#39;m afraid.”<br />
<br />
Jamie couldn&#39;t help but look sad.  “I know, but I&#39;ll miss you and Edira.”<br />
<br />
Minuet hugged the little demon.  “Well, if I ever get a free moment, I&#39;d be happy to ask you to come visit.  You&#39;ve been a pleasure, my dear.”  She then picked Jamie up and kissed her.<br />
<br />
Jamie couldn&#39;t help but giggle, but yes, there it was.  The stirrings of lust in her body.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then Edira came to fly her home.  Even though she could make the trip herself, it was explained she probably shouldn&#39;t try until she had more practice.<br />
<br />
Jamie appeared on her bed, and saw she had texts from Kelly and Rachel.  She replied to them, but kept her new form a secret for now.  The ring would come first...</p>
