<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica was having the time of her life. It had taken a bit of work and manipulation, but Elizabeth was almost hers! And not just in heart.<br />
<br />
The shape of Elizabeth&#39;s face was the same, but her looks had otherwise changed to the point that anyone who knew the old her would have trouble picking her out in a crowd.<br />
<br />
Her formerly blonde hair was purple, naturally purple. Her long hair had shrunk to a short crew cut. Her skin had been OK before, but now it was truly flawless. Funnily enough, she was no longer wearing any makeup. Her dress had been exchanged for a black vest and jeans. Her high heels had been exchanged for boots. Her breasts were a little bigger than before.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth&#39;s personality had changed a little, but not enough. That was something Jessica still needed to work on.<br />
<br />
The lesbian couple was walking the street hand in hand, Elizabeth&#39;s head leaning on Jessica&#39;s shoulder, when they were rudely interrupted by a drunkard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heya sexy! How-about we go to a hotel for some fun!&quot; said the drunkard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, but I am already in a committed relationship. Also, I&#39;m gay.&quot; said Elizabeth in a polite voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on now, don&#39;t be that way. In fact, why don&#39;t both of you come. There&#39;s more than enough of me for both of you ladies!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said, I am not interested. Please leave us alone.&quot; replied Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
Suddenly angry, the drunkard screamed out, &quot;Why you filthy B--CH!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The drunkard tried to grab Elizabeth by force and punch her, but fortunately, Jessica was armed with pepper spray.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aagh!&quot; cried out the drunk. The lesbian couple ran for it. After reaching a safe distance, the two rested for breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scum!&quot; denounced Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, don&#39;t you just hate men? They&#39;re disgusting. And they are violent when they don&#39;t get their way!&quot; asserted Jessica. Jessica didn&#39;t actually feel strongly about the subject, but she needed Elizabeth to. That would make things a lot easier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m OK with my family, but I&#39;ve always found men in general to be creepy.&quot; agreed Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Next time, don&#39;t even bother to be polite. Just make sure you bring something to make them back off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica needed to shape the new Elizabeth carefully. Elizabeth&#39;s enchantments were still malleable. Jessica was currently being very careful not to mention Sean. Ideally, it would be best if Elizabeth forgot about him completely.<br />
<br />
Jessica had intentionally guided Elizabeth along a route through a bad neighborhood with misogynist jerks. And she was lucky enough to encounter one. This way, she could plant a hate for men in the new Elizabeth&#39;s personality. It seemed to be working. Elizabeth now seemed to think she had always hated men. Jessica still needed to push it a little more.<br />
<br />
Was she feeling guilty about resorting to magic and manipulation? A little, but Jessica had always been a rather selfish person. In fact, if anything, the wrongness of it was actually kind of stimulating. This wasn&#39;t the first time Jessica had done something wrong for the thrill of it.<br />
<br />
Jessica lusted after Elizabeth, she might have even loved her a little, but she never respected Elizabeth as a person. The way things were going, Jessica would probably get bored with Elizabeth, cheat on her behind her back for the thrill of it, and dump her in a couple years. Then, maybe she would find another person to mess with.<br />
<br />
She had fantasized about playing God in peoples&#39; lives, and by borrowing the power of the bar, she could actually do it! It was quite fun! But after watching other girls take advantage of the bar to create their own ideal girlfriends, she had forgotten that this wasn&#39;t actually her power. It was Liz&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Liz was OK with manipulation, she was a witch after all. But using people, messing up their existing relationships, and throwing them away? Liz&#39;s morals were slightly alien to normal humans, but she ultimately wanted her customers to be happy. Jessica had crossed a line. Jessica&#39;s potential future was about to become a lot more variable than she had been expecting.<br />
<br />
A rather androgynous looking man was now approaching the lesbian couple. Jessica did not recognize the man. But Elizabeth did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sean?!?&quot; said Elizabeth in a confused voice.<br />
<br />
Jessica stared at the strange man. That was Sean? Weird, that wasn&#39;t what he looked like before. Did he visit the bar too? But why would he? How would he even know about it?<br />
<br />
Only those who had been to the bar would be capable of noticing, but Elizabeth&#39;s hair grew long again and changed back to blonde. Her outfit suddenly changed into the blue and white dress she had been wearing before Jessica invited her to an outing. Even her breasts shrunk. Elizabeth had subconsciously gone back to her old look. But Elizabeth was too distracted to notice.<br />
<br />
Something had been bothering Elizabeth for the past couple hours, but it had been at the back of her mind. Sean&#39;s very existence had been slowly becoming unimportant to her.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth was having trouble making sense of her current situation. It was like a nightmare. Wait, was she cheating on him? Why would she do that?<br />
<br />
She was a lesbian, she supposed. So it only made sense to leave him for another woman and let him be with someone who could actually reciprocate his feelings. But even so, was this the way she would normally handle it?<br />
<br />
And when did she realize she was actually a lesbian? For the past several hours, she had just sort of taken it for granted that she knew she was a lesbian all along, but if she always knew she was a lesbian, then why did she get together with Sean in the first place? Elizabeth suddenly didn&#39;t know what to think.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth started desperately praying to wake up so that the world would make sense again, but since she was not technically asleep, it was to no avail.</p>
