<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Whether it was because it was parts of his human mind had been reduced or was due to him lacking the words to begin with, Richard could not begin to describe how seeing the world as a wolf was different from seeing as a human. Down on all fours, lifting his leg to do his business, relying more on his sense of smell, and in some cases, his hearing, more than his eyesight, his vocal ranges decreased to a series of bestial noises to convey anything he had to say, a coat of fur the only covering over his body, he thought about these things and others as he travelled, and the closest he could come to describing his new world was it was freer.<br />
<br />
He had no responsibility to report to a job he made himself work harder at than others, all so he could prove he deserved what he&#39;d been given upon hiring. There was no father, and sometimes mother, he constantly worried whether or not he was living up to any expectations of him. There were no bills, no rent, he had to worry about, make sure were paid on time. Even the loneliness he felt as a human was gone. Sure, he wouldn&#39;t have minded the company of another timber wolf, possibly even a female, but, at the moment, he was content being the lone wolf he was. Heading deeper into the woods, trying not to think about how his situation was temporary, and Sunday evening he&#39;d have to go back to all the things he had to deal with as a human, he focused on enjoying the experience. Giving himself over to his wolf side every so often, he was a little put-off at first when he hunted, killed and ate raw a small animal, but then discovered, as what he now was, it wasn&#39;t so bad.<br />
<br />
Eager to do it again, but with more of his human mind in control, he restrained himself. Understanding on levels he&#39;d never given any thought to, as well as new instincts, it wouldn&#39;t do to go about killing animals simply for the enjoyment of it, he finished his meal and moved on. Letting those instincts he&#39;d only become aware of guide him as he avoided a section of the forest which didn&#39;t smell right, and left him on edge, he skirted around it. Wanting to know what about it made him feel so, he guessed it was an animal thing, as the closest he could get to describing it was this was the territory of another predator.<br />
<br />
So focused on trying to move around it, and avoid whatever it was, he was caught off guard when he heard something he at first couldn&#39;t identify, followed by a sharp pain in his flank. Realising what he&#39;d heard was the discharge of a type of weapon, he tried to run from it, and was alarmed to discover his back legs didn&#39;t work. Trying to figure out why, it was upsetting when he kenned it wasn&#39;t just his backside, but, at some point, he dropped to ground. Unable to move, no matter how hard he tried, it didn&#39;t take him long before he worked out what he&#39;d heard was a tranquilizer gun. Listening as someone close by moved about, he couldn&#39;t understand the speech as two humans approached. Letting the wolf take control, unable to really stop it, Richard began to panic as they came closer, and wanting to snap at them, to leap up and flee, feeling trapped, he was powerless to do anything as they moved him into a cage.<br />
<br />
After they&#39;d done this, one of the humans gave Richard something, and listening as they spoke in a calming voice, Richard felt himself drifting away until blackness claimed him. Waking with a start, confused, the wolf couldn&#39;t understand where he was. A part of his mind seemed to understand, to hold the answers, but whatever had been done to him prevented him accessing it completely. Bits and pieces of data leaking, merging, making him smarter, more cunning than the average wolf, the timber wolf began to prowl around the enclosure, sniffing, lifting his leg, stopping to scratch at his ear, which now had something fastened to it. Again, the part of his mind he could access seemed to hold the answer of what the thing was, and why it was there. Sitting down after some time, he lifted his head and let forth a plaintive howl, which was soon answered by another of his kind nearby. Continuing to howl, mostly to communicate with the other, the timber wolf soon stood and headed in the direction of the other.<br />
<br />
The enclosure actually two, the wolf stopped when he came to a wall. Sniffing, scratching at it, then the hard ground, he started to pace back and forth. Knowing on the other side was the other wolf, he started walking one way, turned and followed the wall in another direction. Pacing, it was by accident when he discovered after some time the gate. At first, he couldn&#39;t understand what it was, only that on the other side was the other wolf, and if either one could get past it, they could be together. Pawing, snapping, and using his body and paws to slam into it, it didn&#39;t take him long before he accidentally popped it open. Able to now access the other enclosure, the wolf stepped through, and paused when he really smelled and saw the other timber wolf.<br />
<br />
Female, she regarded him with a cool, aloof posture, and after some time of the two staring at each other, they cautiously approached each other. Sniffing, communicating to each other through a series of normal sounds and body language, after some time of doing this, they accepted each other. Feeling there was something he had wanted to do when encountering a female wolf, the male wasn&#39;t sure what. Figuring it wasn’t important, he set off with the female as a part of him decided, as he stopped to sniff, then licked at the thing attached to her ear, what was imperative was escaping from the confines of where they were being held. Reaching another wall, not knowing it was called so, the two turned and followed it as they explored together, unaware of cameras set up in strategic placements where monitoring them, whilst chips in the trackers on their ears and under their pelts kept tabs on their movements.</p>
