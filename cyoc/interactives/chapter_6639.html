<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Tell you why you need me,” I said.  “Aren’t you wondering why you do?”<br />
<br />
Katie regained her breath.  “Yea,” she said.  “I have.  I just know that I had to find you and fuck you.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm,” I said.  “That’s because of all the comments you and your friends made on Friday night,” I said.  She was about to ask what I was talking about, but I cut her off and told her the same story I had told Lindsey and Trisha.  Trisha even helped fill in some of the blanks.<br />
<br />
“So you made me want to fuck you?” she asked, disgusted.<br />
<br />
“Yep,” I said with a smirk.  “You and Trisha and Lindsey, and Mia and Claire and Erika, too.  The last three just haven’t gotten to me yet.”<br />
<br />
“Did you do anything else to Trisha and Lindsey,” Katie asked, very much afraid now.<br />
<br />
“As a matter of fact,” I continued to smirk, “I did.  You see, you don’t realize it’s anything strange, but they’re both walking around stark naked from now on.  You think that’s what they usually do, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Yea,” she said slowly.  “It isn’t?”<br />
<br />
“Of course it isn’t!” I snapped.  Thinking I sounded a little too mean, I said, “Sorry.  But I mean, how many other people do you know who seem to not wear any clothes and not get in trouble for it.”<br />
<br />
“No one, I guess,” was all she could say.<br />
<br />
”That’s right,” I said.  “So now it’s time for your change.”<br />
<br />
Quickly she stood up, worried about what I might do.  “Joe, please.  I didn’t…I mean, I don’t really--”<br />
<br />
I held up my hand.  To my surprise, she stopped talking.  “Apologies will get you nowhere.  You’re going to learn a lesson like all of your friends will.  But I have a feeling that through it all, you’ll enjoy your punishment.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Humor me a sec,” I said.  “If you could be an animal, what animal would you want to be?”<br />
<br />
“What?” she said.<br />
<br />
“Just tell me,” I said.<br />
<br />
“A cat, I suppose,” she said.  That was the answer I wanted to hear.  <br />
<br />
“Good,” I said.  I made my wish.<br />
<br />
“Good?” she repeated.  “What the heck is that supposed to mean?”  She would know soon enough.  I could already see the changes happening.  <br />
<br />
“Look at your nails,” I said. <br />
<br />
She looked down and saw her previously short nails growing.  Sharp tips were forming on the ends of her fingernails as they grew.  “What are you doing?” she screamed.<br />
<br />
“Making my very own Katie Kat,” I said.<br />
<br />
Her toenails changed as well, growing longer, pointed, and sharp.  Her ears were sliding to the top of her head.  They poked out through her mane of brown of hair, which was growing longer and thicker.  Her ears grew bigger, and like her nails, became pointed, just like the ears of a cat.  “Please,” she pleaded as her pubic hair grew wildly, creeping to both her legs and her abdomen.  <br />
<br />
I noticed that the coat of fur that was growing did not appear to be growing over her entire body.  It had sprouted over the top of her arms and legs, but not the bottoms.  Well, in this case, not over the backsides of them.  Her shoulders grew fur, but her chest and stomach remained bare.  So did the palms of her hands, the bottom of her feet, and her ass.  The brown fur was also overtaking her back.  The fur that spread from her pubic hair spread up the sides of her torso and covered some parts of her belly.  A perfect oval that started just above her breasts and ended just below her belly button remained void of fur.  <br />
<br />
“Ow!” Katie shouted.  Her clawed hand reached up to her mouth.  She touched her lips and drew her hand away to examine what was wrong.  “It’s blood!” she shouted frantically.  I saw what caused it and wish she had a mirror in her hands so she could see it, too.  Without even wondering how the mirror suddenly appeared, she looked into it.  The sight of her canine teeth lengthening into fangs was reflected in the glass.  “Oh my God!” she said.  “I’m a monster,” she whined, looking at the 4 teeth that were changing.  <br />
<br />
Two new sets of nipples suddenly appeared underneath her breasts.  She felt them grow and reached down to touch them.  &quot;Holy fucking shit!&quot;  They didn't grow into breasts, just teats.<br />
<br />
A lump began to appear just over her ass.  &quot;Oh, now what?&quot; she asked, feeling the lump with her hand.  I knew what was going to happen.  A tail pushed its way out of her lower back, extending out and curling down to the floor.  &quot;Wow,&quot; she said, swaying it back and forth.  &quot;It feels so real,&quot; she said while she rubbed it against the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because it is,&quot; Trisha said.  The tail grew so long that it could extend to the floor.  Her changes were finished once the tail stopped growing.  She didn't grow whiskers, her eyes didn't change, and she didn't grow a muzzle.  But besides all that and her lack of a complete coat of fur, she was a were-cat.  She had claws, fangs, pointed ears, teats, and a tail.  So I guess she was only a half were-cat.  <br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel now?&quot; I asked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; she said.  She held aloft the mirror again and looked at her face.  There was a small patch of fur on her cheeks that ran down to her neck and shoulders.  The rest of her head did not have fur, either.  &quot;I look like a freak!  Oh, who am I kidding?  I am a freak!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one will notice the difference,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; she asked with anger in her voice, baring her fangs at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simple,&quot; I said, not intimidated by her threat, if that's what it was supposed to be.  &quot;I wish that everyone would think was the way you always looked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think that will actually work?&quot; she demanded.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Take one look at yourself and tell me if you're really a half-cat,&quot; I said.  &quot;If the answer is yes, than the answer is yes,&quot; I said sarcastically.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fine,&quot; she growled, satisfied somewhat.  &quot;How long am I going to have to be like this?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know yet,&quot; I said.  &quot;Just count on being like that indefinitely.&quot;<br />
<br />
She pouted.  &quot;You better take care of me, then,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I'll be taking care of all of you,&quot; I assured her.  &quot;But for now, let the next victim enter.&quot;<br />
<br />
I beckoned for them to leave the shower and we returned to the main locker room.  We sat down on a bench just as the door opened revealing...</p>
