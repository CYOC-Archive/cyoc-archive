<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Dad, just turn me back and I can find another way to fix this mess. Please! I..I...&quot; <br />
<br />
Dad had turned around and was absentmindedly rubbing his butt on the dresser while holding the laptop causing waves of sexual pleasure to disorient and distract Jeff. &quot;You want me to stop?&quot; Dad pressed hard on the underwear cock pushing it deeper inside him then ever before. &quot;You don&#39;t want my seed?&quot; Dad asked pausing his movements when he sensed that Jeff (and consequently himself) where maddeningly close to climax.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Don&#39;t stop... I... I need it.&quot; Jeff whimpered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then how do I make my plan work Jeff? How do I get what is best for me, and your mom, and your brother?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me cum in you!&quot; Jeff demanded sending erotic mental images of the two of them having sex as two men of their current ages. His desperation for the drug only his dad can supply bringing him to a new low.<br />
<br />
Mike got the images. He like Jeff was perpetually horny due to the midday changes; Jeff and he were phallicly linked so anything erotic to one of them would turn them both on. When the surprise porno played in his head, he leaned back, shifting Jeff inside of him and that was enough to make them go off.<br />
<br />
Dad seemed much less effected by the orgasms then Jeff, recovering almost immediately, &quot;Well that was unexpected Jeff. But if you want more, we are going to need a solution.&quot; He removed the fabric boner from his ass. &quot;Otherwise there will be drastic changes to My timeline and the family will fall to pieces because of it. You don&#39;t want that do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff could already feel the warm fulfillment from his semen addiction turning into the emptiness of withdraw. All afternoon they had done little other than work together to get each other off and managed 2 years or 24 loads in 4 hours. A load every 10 minutes... and there was the absolute bliss of being in the car driving to do chores as dad &quot;danced&quot; to the music, summoning around a load per song and sometimes more. Being inside Mike while he walked through the store aisles was its own unique sense of exquisiteness, though much less effective than the driving. The effect of this however was a drastic worsening of his addiction and a shift in his priorities from getting his life back... to getting his next fix.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Dad...&quot; Jeff said after a minute, &quot;You&#39;ve got to get me from 20 to 26. that&#39;s when you said we will become brothers instead of Father and Son. If you reset reality before then you risk a criminal record, which would cause havoc to all of us.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right&quot; Dad said without offering any solutions... It seemed he was actually waiting for Jeff to figure out how his dad could successfully ruin his life.<br />
<br />
If Jeff was being honest with himself, he was actually excited to become 21. Although he knew his memories weren&#39;t real, it was real to him. Jeff knew he probably started the day somewhere around 13 or 14 but as far as he could remember, he has been a 20 year old for half a year now. Jeff was terrified that as he got closer and closer to the end of his dad&#39;s little game, the reality resets will make him think his brother is just swapping a couple years with him and he will be less inclined to fight it or think of a way out. &quot;I&#39;ve pointed out that you can just set up the reality you want for yourself, and leave our family to me. I can, and will happily figure something out that doesn&#39;t involve, father-son, sibling, or mother-son incest.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dad mentally sighed heavily, &quot;We&#39;ve been through this Jeff, this is happening. Think of it this way, your sacrifice is giving all of us another chance. Your mother will get the husband she deserves, your brother will get a chance to be a big brother, and you will get to be a father, husband, and the man of the house. Additionally, not that you have as much compassion for me as you once did, I get a second chance to go after my dream relationship, and be completely fulfilled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have turned me down repeatedly, fine. You either need to make the 6 year transition into us becoming siblings so slow that nobody will take notice... or make it so fast that you will have already reset reality before anyone can figure out what&#39;s going on, call for help, or cause panic. Now lets fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so fast son, that isn&#39;t a plan, its just a couple of options. You&#39;re still not allowed in until you find me a solution. Your little brother losing 6 years will be easily noticed by either your mother or him himself. 6 years would be 72 loads, and we haven&#39;t accomplished that all day...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s cause you need to try harder, now give me your ass!&quot; Jeff interjected, his addiction and heightened lust getting the better of him and making it impossible for him to focus. <br />
<br />
&quot;Soon, but spending all night fucking will take time and draw attention, your brother is at an age where even a few months could have been a noticeable growth spurt. How can we make it so that I can reset reality?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was exasperated and couldn&#39;t think straight. &quot;Ugh, if my birthday is causing the problem, just remove me from the family until I can rejoin as your brother later. There done. Now let&#39;s go!&quot; <br />
<br />
Mike pondered this for a moment. &quot;That idea holds some water but there are still a ton of questions. Like, who&#39;s family will you join and how will I still know you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff, having not gotten off in about 20 minutes was losing his mind with lust. Rather than responding he sent more images of them having sex as men, which worked last time. After that didn&#39;t make Mike give into him, he imagined himself as Marc pounding his dad&#39;s ass trying to force his father&#39;s body to give him another hit.<br />
<br />
It worked. Within a few seconds, Jeff felt his dad reach around and guide him into Jeff&#39;s happy place. Jeff was so focused on his fabric penis he didn&#39;t notice that his connection to his father dimmed.<br />
<br />
Mike misunderstood the images to be a recommendation that Jeff become a younger sibling to the man Mike lusted after. The thought immediately enticed him and Mike got to work setting the Chronivac up to make the changes happen next reset, he took very special care to make sure Jeff&#39;s personality wasn&#39;t destroyed in the process. After all, that&#39;s what will make him such a good husband for, what is soon to be, his wife.<br />
<br />
While at it, Mike was growing very tired of Jeff&#39;s stance of moral superiority, the constant fighting, whining, and surprisingly the constant demand for sex. Even with the biological enhancements to make them capable of going off over 50 times in 6 hours, it is still exhausting. Jeff doesn&#39;t have a body and has very little work to do to make it a success. Therefore, Mike toned down the addiction so it wouldn&#39;t be all consuming.<br />
<br />
As for Jeff&#39;s attitude about the whole thing, Mike made Jeff think the age transfer was his idea. The method for implementing had to still be his idea because Jeff needs to be straight, but soon, the story will be that Jeff just wanted to be Marc&#39;s big brother and is working with Mike to do so. In the new reality Jeff works at the same company, Marc got him the job. While Jeff is not related to Mike, he will remember both realities of future resets the same way Mike does. This is to encourage him as the changes progress.<br />
<br />
As Jeff and Mike came a third time, Mike activated the changes modifying what will happen on the next reset. Jeff realized he could suddenly perceive more, putting together that he had been blocked out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, what did you do?&quot; Jeff asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really liked your idea son. I decided to use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What idea?&quot; Jeff thought back and only remembered his haze of frenzied desire. &quot;I could have said anything, what did I recommend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You had a great idea to separate yourself from the family. This way I can reset reality as often as I need to over the next 6 years we transfer, and there&#39;s no longer any urgency to blast past the experience we share.&quot; Dad said with a smile. &quot;Honestly son, it was genius, I couldn&#39;t have done it without you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jeff mentally gasped in disbelief. Did he recommend that? How could he undermine himself so completely? &quot;No, Dad, I was wrong. That&#39;s a terrible idea. We can find another way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no need for that. Like I said before, coming up with the perfect plan is how you work, I find a way that works for now and improve upon it as I go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was utterly mortified. Unfortunately for him, the only way he expresses emotion now is with a rock hard erection. <br />
<br />
After cumming again Mike said, &quot;Okay, that should make you 20 and 11 months... once more and I can reset reality and we will get to meet the new Jeff! I bet you&#39;re excited to become legal. Actually I know you are, I can read your mind.&quot; Mike chuckled. &quot;Let&#39;s get it over with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff resisted to the best of his ability, but having become a full fledged sex addict, mostly in the last two hours, there was very little resistance he could muster. &quot;No dad, don&#39;t do this... I want you so bad, but this isn&#39;t right...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hush son. Just let it happen. It is inevitable.&quot; Mike replied. Like Jeff had done to him, Mike sent images of Jeff having sex with his mom, tweaked from Mike&#39;s memories, It quickly became a montage of all the places they had sex over the years, each tweaked to show a third person view of Jeff in Mike&#39;s place. It ended with an older version of Jeff in the delivery room greeting Jacob as he was born. <br />
<br />
Instead of being sexy like it was intended it was, well, weird and awkward for Jeff, but also tender and sentimental. The pair had lost their erections and Jeff could sense very strong and mixed emotions from his dad. &quot;Are you sure you want to give that all up Dad? That is a lot of love to just let go of...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike honey, come down for dinner. And after, could you help Jacob with his math homework? He&#39;s struggling.&quot; Mom called from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Mike didn&#39;t respond to his wife or Jeff. He just plodded downstairs and went to the kitchen. Upon entering, Jeff and Mike had a weird reaction where a flood of emotion and memories overcame them with love instead of just lust, they immediately became erect and came.<br />
<br />
Much to Jeff&#39;s surprise, Mike didn&#39;t immediately snap his underwear band summoning the new &#39;little brother of Marc&#39; version of Jeff. Jeff knew better than to yell in dad&#39;s ear and could feel his brain working but didn&#39;t have access to any of the thoughts.<br />
<br />
Jeff withdrew into his own mind, trying his best to ignore any stimuli he got, Dad admitted he is willing to completely change plans if something better came along... I just need to figure out what he might consider something better to be... before I get erased.</p>
