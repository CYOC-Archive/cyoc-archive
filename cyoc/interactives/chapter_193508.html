<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The lady follows your hand and picks up a pair of syringes from your selected tray. She quickly injects them into your ears. Unexpectedly, you also feel a third injection on the back of your neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;What was that last one for?&quot; You ask out of curiosity as you do not know how or if that spot even has anything to do with your new ears. The lady give your lower back a firm press, causing your body to automatically once again push back against her palm. &quot;You will find out shortly. Just give it a moment to work and try not to talk until I say otherwise.&quot;<br />
<br />
You almost respond, but she silences you with a finger and you give up on asking anything more. &quot;Now just patiently lay here on your front. I mean it too, please lay down with belly on table. And do not touch your head. It will itch and it will feel weird when you lose all hearing for a couple of moments, but don&#39;t panic. Just remain calm and everything will be fine. I need to grab some things. But I will be right back&quot; instructs the lady. She then removes her hand from your lower back and steps away for a moment.<br />
<br />
You lower yourself down onto your stomach to lay there obediently, awaiting her to return. Meanwhile, your ears are definitely feeling extremely itchy. So much so that it is taking all your focus to not give in and scratch them. Because of that though, you do not realize that your current posture is nearly identical to a cat&#39;s now. Your feet are flat on the table and your knees are bent to either side of your waist. You elbows and forearm also are laying on the table too and your tail is once again swaying from side to side behind you. <br />
<br />
You hear a loud pop, then nothing at all. It is a very unsettling feeling, suddenly losing all of your hearing ability. You hope this doesn&#39;t last long. And in about 10 seconds, another pop sounds and all hearing returns, better than ever, and by a significant margin at that. Plus it now is comming from above your head, instead of form either side too. <br />
<br />
Suddenly you feel the excessive urge to uncover your new ears from your hair. But since the lady said not to touch anything, you cannot do it. But that doesn&#39;t stop your new ears from twitching up a storm in an attempt to uncover themselves.<br />
<br />
It is then that you hear a very loud, and very annoying beeping, and your ears quickly angle towards the source and you look behind you. The lady has returned, now entering in from a seperate door, and with a device in her hand that is making the loud noise. &quot;Could you please turn that beeping noise off?&quot; you loudly shout/beg, as the sound is only getting louder and louder the closer she walks to you.<br />
<br />
The lady seems very startled by your sudden and loud request. But she looks down at the device in her hands and quickly turns it off. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry about that. I cannot actually hear this like you can, so I didn&#39;t realize that I had turned it on by accident&quot; sincerely apologizes the lady as she puts the device down on the table beside yours.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t hear that? But it&#39;s so loud&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a pet training device which sends out a noise at such a high frequency that most humans normally cannot hear. But dogs and cats can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that makes sense then why you were startled when I shouted earlier.&quot; The lady simply shrugs and approaches you once again. She holds out a hand mirror up for you to let you see your new ears with. The two new black fur covered triangles atop your head are still twitching as not all strands of your silky black hair have been flicked off of them yet. Seeing this, the lady frees them up for you, which instantly let&#39;s you feel a lot more relaxed. You hadn&#39;t even realized how stressed out this was making you feel until now. &quot;Thank you for that. Can I touch them now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. They seem to have grown in properly and are functioning as they should be&quot; replies the lady who moves her hand away. You reach up and rub your pads over your new ears. The fur is incredibly soft to the touch and they flick and twitch about as your fingers rub over them. It is then that you feel the lady rub her own finger along the back side of your left ear. She is rubbing it right where it meets your head, and your mind goes instantly foggy. Your thoughts slow down and shift to mostly be about enjoying the petting and about how more amazing it feels to be pet by someone else then by yourself. <br />
<br />
You begin purring. Which if not for being so obsessed with being pet, would have taken you by surprise. But sure enough, you can feel somewhere near your neck, something is making you purr. It takes you a few extra moments to shift focus onto that topic, but you do manage to do it, and find that you have absolutely no control over it whatsoever. You cannot start nor stop it at will. <br />
<br />
While she is petting you, the lady reaches for another syringe and quickly injects it into the side of your head, then again on the other side. You are ordered to not move your arms again and feel them stop listening to your will, and remaining as they are, tucked in closely to your boobs on either side of you with your forearms flat along the table.<br />
<br />
Your vision badly blurs and then finally goes completely black, making you fully blind. &quot;I-I can&#39;t see anymore...&quot; you nervously say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will again soon enough, so don&#39;t worry. I am right here as well&quot; says the lady who is now stroking your head gently. &quot;She is actually treating me more like a cat than a person now, isn&#39;t she&quot; you think to yourself. And as she promised, your sight returned, clearer than ever, and much more sensitive to the smallest of movements too. You look around at everything, as if you are seeing it all for the first time, but this is just you checking if your vision truely has fully returned, which it has.<br />
<br />
The lady shows you your reflection again. You have some expectations going into this already, and are pleasently satisfied to find your green eyes are now not only more vivid in their color, but also have cat-like slit pupils. There is also significantly less white in them too, making them appear much larger than normal too. They are quite pretty in your opinion, though the lady seems to think otherwise, given her current expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well... this should be fine, hopefully...&quot; she says in a rather unconvincing manner. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong? Is there something wrong? Am I going to be alright?&quot; You ask, now a bit nervous yourself.<br />
<br />
The lady calms herself and nods. &quot;Yes you are going to be perfectly fine. There is nothing wrong, per say. It is just incorrect. Your pupils shouldn&#39;t have become slits is all. Those are only found in house cats for the most part. Bigger cats actually tend to have round pupils, like humans. But as you are not an actual panther, and are only partially one, plus you will technically be a kind of house cat in a way, so it should be alright. The color is correct at least. And they are rather pretty like this too. Though what actually matters is what your new man thinks about them. He will be spending time with them the most afterall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way, who is my new employer? He sounds like a very... eccentric man&quot; you say as politely as possible so as to not badmouth your new boss before you even get to meet him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man? Oh heavens no. Your employer is a woman you know. While her husband is footing the bill, she is actually the one who will become your employer. It is a really good thing we got this little misunderstanding taken care of before you meet her. She is not known to be particularly cruel or easy to upset, she has a pet peeve about her subordinates thinking she is not their boss, and that her husband is. So stuff this into your brain. She is your boss, employer, and owner. She is who you answer to, always. Not her husband. No matter what anyone besides her says to you. If you can remember this, then you should be fine no matter what. You don&#39;t perhaps have an issue sleeping in the same bed with another woman, in an unromantic manner do you? As she likes letting her cat sleep on the bed with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I guess not... I mean, if she is fine with it. It isn&#39;t like I can do all that much to her anymore anyways with my dick being removed from the picture. If anything, I feel that she would be more likely to touch me than the other way around seeing as how I cannot ignore or disobey her orders after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lady chuckles at this. &quot;Yeah, your right about that. And if she does, just try and take it in the best way possible. She isn&#39;t a cruel person by a long shot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to know a lot about her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could say that. We have been friends for a while now. It&#39;s why I know she won&#39;t mind at all about the incorrect pupil shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. But wait a second. You said my man earlier. If she isn&#39;t him, then who were you speaking about?&quot; You ask, remembering her comment from earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mate of course. Her pet panther, Cocoa. The one who&#39;s babies you will be having.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...She named him Cocoa? As in cocoa like cocoa beans?&quot; You ask, a bit shocked by this rather simplistic name for such an exotic pet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t understand it either. When she got him, he got into some of her black hot cocoa packets or something, I don&#39;t know. But she named him that, so that&#39;s all that really matters I guess.&quot; <br />
<br />
You get the feeling that the two of you agree that the name is not what you would expect for a panther, but it&#39;s not like you have a say in it anyways. You feel a hair fall onto your ear again and the twitching recommences.. the lady notices this and gives you some advice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, your body should have the same amount of flexibility as a panthers by now. So if you want to, you could always just use your foot to itch your ears. Or your hands I guess, but that&#39;s not very cat like.&quot;<br />
<br />
You raise an eyebrow at her suggestion. &quot;Wait, I can actually do that?&quot; It more sounds like a prank than a suggestion in your mind. You do not remember ever getting any injection for enhanced flexibility outside of what a human woman would possibly have after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Or there would be no way in hell that you could be laying down like that and not be in any pain or discomfort.&quot; Says the lady while pointing towards your ass.<br />
<br />
You turn your head and look where she is pointing. And for the first time you finally realize how impossibly far above back your knees are being rotated right now. You had felt stretched just bending in half a while ago, and now your legs seem to have rotated even further passed that. And they now don&#39;t feel any kind of discomfort with doing so either.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you were wondering, everyone here at the med lab calls this the sphinx phase for cat based experiments, because of the posture your currently are in. And this is not yet including the upgraded skeletal system and improved joints and muscles yet. Once those are all in place, you shoukd find your top running speed to be quite faster than it is now. Your ability to land from high falls will be improved, and walking on all fours will be very easy for you to switch to and from at a moments notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I can see the resemblance.&quot; You are very interested in this but your attention is drawn back to the lady who holds up the next tray in front of you. The label on it reads....</p>
