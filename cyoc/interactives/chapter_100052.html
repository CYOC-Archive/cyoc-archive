<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">... John decided it was time to move on to Steve next.<br />
<br />
There was no doubt in his mind that this Chronivac machine worked. Ron&#39;s udder was fully functional, just like how his had been, and it felt so completely real, better than any dream he could have dreamt. But how it was making reality change was bizarrely enticing... It was like working alchemy, or wizardry. Could he basically change whatever he wanted on any person who came near the machine? Anything at all? What were the limits? Or did the machine simply do something to his mind that made him see these things on people? Was it all really happening? Was he dreaming? And where did this thing come from??<br />
<br />
Sitting back in the chair at his desk, John&#39;s mind was a wash. He contemplated for a few moments, remembering the feeling of having an udder again, and getting excited by it. He could still hear the guys down the hall chatting away - they were probably playing video games. He didn&#39;t know what the ramifications were going to be if he did anything outrageous with this Chronivac, but it had already been about 15 minutes since he changed Ron, and it didn&#39;t seem like the guys were reacting any differently to his roommate with an udder. The &quot;alter reality&quot; option was his best friend - as long as that option stayed checked, he could do whatever he wanted and witness the results. At least this is what he could seem to learn by reading further on the device.<br />
<br />
Steve was one of the team&#39;s wide receivers, and while he wasn&#39;t going to be the next NFL money-maker, he had a good chance of landing a scholarship to play ball with a university. Svelte and well-muscled, he would go with Ron to the gym on most days. But John admitted, willingly, that he wasn&#39;t so bad when he was outside the group of dudes - he was tolerable, much more so than Chuck or Mark. A kind personality, unattached to his phone, and able to strike up an interesting conversation about school, work, parties - whatever. He just smelled like gym.<br />
<br />
John postulated for a few moments. Cows were great and all, but John wanted to see something different. This device was deep in its capabilities, it seemed. Part of this replacement tool option was the option to add features. All that it required John to do was to just change the drop-down for the &#39;splicer&#39; (what the system called it) from &#39;Replace&#39; to &#39;Add&#39;. So the question now was: what feature would John add?<br />
<br />
The duration of the transformation was set to 3 days this time. John wanted it to last long enough for the football game on Saturday to come and go; this way, he could watch the game unfold with the obsurdity of his changes.<br />
<br />
He smiled - it was time to test out this baby. He hit enter and left down the hall.<br />
<br />
Sequence beginning in 5 .... 4 .... 3 .... 2....&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve&#39;s image, an otherwise faithful rendition of his body, appeared on the screen - with the added changes John had made.<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
Walking back into the living room and taking a seat, the guys were more or less done with football game planning and were just hanging out playing video games. It looked to be a multiplayer match of one of those run-of-the-mill first-person shooters. Disengaged almost immediately, John turned focus to Steve, who was slowly spreading his legs outward, and he was beginning to raise his shoulders a bit.<br />
<br />
With a subtle rip, Steve&#39;s shirt ripped open on each side. He absent-mindedly tugged on his sleeve to do what his shirt had already done for him - two small and nubby limbs were growing outward from underneath his armpits, and it had torn his sleeves down part-way. Something similar was going on by his legs, but he couldn&#39;t really tell if it was what -<br />
<br />
****RIP****<br />
<br />
- he thought it was. Exposed!<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck. Pause the game for a sec,&quot; Steve murmured.<br />
<br />
&quot;What!?! No - You can&#39;t just quit before we kill you!!&quot; Ron complained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw, something... hmmm. Well... never mind... sorry guys. I&#39;ll deal with it later...&quot; he turned to me. &quot;Something up, John?&quot;<br />
<br />
He saw me looking at him, and I played it as coolly as I could, but I was sweating like a pig. &quot;Noooo...&quot;<br />
<br />
The game restarted; my heart was beating fast and the nervousness wouldn&#39;t go away. it was almost like, for a split second, Steve knew something had changed... but then a second later, he had forgotten completely. Cool, I thought. As I had planned out, a third nub had appeared at his crotch and was growing rapidly outward. On the back end of things, his waist was getting a bit larger. The ripping of clothing was something I had not accounted for during these transformations, but it was an extra treat to see how the guys dealt with a sudden &quot;burst&quot; - which, as it seemed, was &#39;barely&#39;.<br />
<br />
Then the motion on his face began, and his eyes were fluttering wildly; it was kind of like his face was melting, but things were moving both upward and downward. A few moments later, his eyes widened, and then SNAP - they split into two. <br />
<br />
The nubs on either side of the body were now much longer and definitely resembled more like limbs. The fleshy components to his changing body weren&#39;t moving much, but by the time the clock was nearing a minute since its beginning, it was evident that what I had programmed with the Chronivac was, yet again, a success. I had almost forgotten that we weren&#39;t in some kind of void - people were all around me and Steve; they were witness to the changes that were going on in front of them. And yet, it simply did not matter. Ron&#39;s milky appendage did not matter. What was expected to be &quot;real&quot; .... did not matter.<br />
<br />
The last minor change that I had made with the Chronivac was to Steve&#39;s hands, which looked a bit bigger than before. That&#39;s because they were - another finger had been growing in on either hand, so that he would have five fingers. And, for the sake of the experiment, a second thumb had also been added to each hand - kind of like how a koala&#39;s paw looks. It was odd, but it was fun. Steve now had seven digits on each hand. He was gripping the controller in the most peculiar way, with his two thumbs able to cover most of the buttons on the top of the controller, coordinated and fully functional.<br />
<br />
But while Steve was playing (and winning) the video game with his two hands, he was also able to grab for his glass of water and took a big gulp. That&#39;s because he now had four fully-functioning arms! The two extra &quot;nubs&quot; were now arms that were just underneath where his regular arms were, parting the way through his broken t-shirt, and they pretty much looked the same. I wondered exactly how a skeletal structure would ever work like that... well, whatever. Steve definitely had some muscle to him from playing football, and the extra pair of arms were just as well-muscled as his regular arms. On his second set of arms he also had seven digits on each hand; something he had not thought about when setting up the change.<br />
<br />
My attention then shifted back to the &quot;third nub&quot; - which was now nearly full-grown - it was his third leg. Right inbetween where his two legs had been was this third limb, a full-length leg, which was tapping away to the music in the video game along with the other legs. <br />
<br />
But because the pants had split open at the crotch to make room for this third appendage, this third leg was completely naked. Additionally, the final &quot;alteration&quot; that I had made was visible as well. On either side of the middle leg, Steve&#39;s dick and balls were hanging out for everyone to see - he now had a second pair. <br />
<br />
It took a lot of willpower to look away from that, and then to see that on Steve&#39;s face, a second pair of eyes were darting back and forth with the action in the game. His original eyes and eye sockets had moved down a bit so that his facial structure could support the third and fourth eyes, which were both inset and a bit more closer together than the original two eyes, since his nose was still in the middle. It gave Steve this very surreal, spider-like appearance that absolutely amazed him, and I couldn&#39;t help but be a little aroused by the whole thing.<br />
<br />
With that, the minute was over, and the transformation was complete. Steve was still 100% human, for sure - but he had a lot more body parts than any human could ever conceive! With four arms, three legs, four eyes, twenty-eight fingers... and an extra spare set of manpower... Steve was some sort of multi-limbed humanoid creature. And me, John - I was the genetic scientist, plotting the design, implementing the change, and enjoying the process of watching it all go down. Part of me wanted so badly to know what it felt like to be Steve right now, or what it even *meant* to be Steve right now.<br />
<br />
He finally killed Ron to end the game, which resulted in a resounding &quot;YES!&quot; from Steve, and a couple of groans and frustrated noises from the other guys. To look as though I had been engaged with what they were doing the whole time, I smiled and said, &quot;Neat. Cool game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve, just let us play now - you got your couple of games in. Let someone else have a chance for a change.&quot;<br />
<br />
He rolled his eyes - all four. &quot;Fine, okay. I need to take some piss anyway,&quot; Steve turned to me, handed the controller to me with his upper right arm, and as he grabbed the glass of water with his lower right arm, jumped up and then limbered on down the hallway. I watched as he moved - all three legs working in tandem, kind of like how a horse moves, without tripping. I would have guessed it otherwise impossible to move like that, but he found a way to do it.<br />
<br />
It was just simply amazing. The whole thing. It was as though Steve had always been this way his entire life - that this was the way his life had always been - and there was nothing new Steve needed to learn about his body. He had full control of it, he knew how everything moved, and the guys sitting around him were none the wiser, nor did they make fun of him or comment on his condition. Sure, Ron was still sporting a bovine package of massive sorts, but wouldn&#39;t you think they&#39;d have said something about this? Not even anything about Steve&#39;s ripped pants? My thoughts were consuming me so greatly that I almost missed hearing what sounded like two streams of piss coming from down the hall.<br />
<br />
A little while later, the initial shock had turned to just eager observation, and Steve had put on a new pair of pants that seemed to support his new conditions - three-legged jeans, and what looked like extra support for what was around his waist. The guys left me and Ron to go home; I went to my room and watched as Steve clambored down to his car and drove off into the world.<br />
<br />
The transformation, as I remembered, was supposed to last until after the football game. So I imagined there was nothing I could do with Steve until game day; Ron&#39;s transformation would be overwith, too, by tomorrow. Needing some sleep badly, I turned off the monitor (but not the Chronivac, or the computer) and went to bed. I would go to town with this toy tomorrow.</p>
