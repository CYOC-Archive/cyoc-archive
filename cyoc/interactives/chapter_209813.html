<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She wasn&#39;t Tyler any longer, despite how the Chronivac programme labelled her. The part of her that had been that person had ceased to be when the last of her humanity had been replaced by what she was now, a vixen. But then, something changed. Cowering under the bed, struggling to keep herself still as the two moved about, she felt, pain.<br />
<br />
No stranger to such a sensation, this time she found it different. It was unlike anything she&#39;d ever felt as an immense pressure began to squeeze her head and inside it, it felt like something was happening. For a split second, a part of her that was close to being Tyler resurfaced, enough to think, &quot;What the fuck is happening to me,&quot; before it vanished completely as millions of years of evolution was forced upon her animal brain. Evolving quick, intelligence and sentience followed,  becoming a tabula rasa that didn’t know anything, yet could understand and reason things out. Finding herself unsure of the state she now existed in, the vixen creeped out from under the thing she hid herself under the moment the ones who frightened her had left, carrying with them something her newly developing brain worked out was somehow responsible for her new state of being.<br />
<br />
Alone, she resisted the urge to call out for a male to satisfy her swollen and needy sex, and she instead set about to explore the place she was confined to. She had no words, nor could form any, as her vocal cords were still those of a fox, to describe where she was. It reeked of a number of odours, some pleasant, others not so much. Squatting down, unable to help herself, she marked a few places, and for the first time she was ever aware of doing so, was ashamed of doing so as well as questioning why. Spotting an opening she could reason had a place that was more comfortable to her kind, she decided she no longer wanted to be where she was. Leaping towards it, she found her progress impeded by something clear. Pacing back and forth in the limited space she had to move about, resisting the urge to express her frustration, she didn&#39;t understand how she was able to see the place her mind insisted she normally was, but she wasn&#39;t able to get to. Stopping, cocking her head, she uttered a low whimper, confused by what had happened to her, wishing she could better understand, and approaching the opening that wasn&#39;t an opening, she began to use her snout, and after some time her paws, to attempt to figure out a way past it.<br />
<br />
Time&#39;s passage still held no meaning to her, and she worked at her task slow. From somewhere close, she could hear sounds, as well as smell things, that told her the two from before were still about. After a while, one diminished, whilst the other changed. Her now average to slightly above intelligent mind able to reason out that one had become like the ones who could satisfy her body&#39;s needs, yet couldn&#39;t because they didn&#39;t smell like her kind, she chose to ignore these things, yet, at the same time, kept herself on guard, should the two decided to come back to her place of confinement. Pawing at the edging after a bit as her mind continued to work things out, she was unable to stop herself when she yipped in surprise as something moved. Working at the thing that had shifted, sure it had done so for a reason, she was soon rewarded when the clear area seemed to slide to the side, and able to smell the place she felt she belonged, she felt she needed no other invitation as she leapt to the ground on the other side.<br />
<br />
Free, her first instinct was to go get away, to hunt, to make herself a burrow, and find another of her kind to satisfy her. Yet, at the same time, for the first time ever, she questioned this, as she tried to sort out whether her kind would accept her now that she was, different. And then, she was overcome with something new that seemed like curiosity to her, yet felt like something more as she longed to know what had been done to her. Hearing noises from close by, she was distracted from her musings, and crouching low, she edged closer to them, even as a part of her told her she should flee.<br />
<br />
The moment she saw one of those who hunted her kind, she froze. Not sure what to do, she was tempted to do exactly as her gut reaction told her, but somehow managed to override such insistences as she instead watched the being before her change. Her still developing mind understanding the creature that normally had covering was nude, as well as what they were doing with their hands as they ran them up and down the thing she knew could satisfy her need if it was smaller, she found she was more interested in how they grew larger, a part of them extended in the back become a thing sort of like what she had, only not as bushy and red with a white tip, whilst the things they used to walk around on morphed into things that were hard, black, and round. Developing brain making the connection to the thing from earlier, she listened as they grunted and made sounds of pleasure before they finished, stood up like her, moved about, and soon went back inside. Finding herself now alone, she crept closer to where they had been.<br />
<br />
With a disdain sniff at the spot, she was able to smell their leavings, which confirmed what she suspected in that they were one of the two, but now different. Losing interest, she turned away, and slunk toward the place they had gone. Ears swivelling as she listened, nostrils twitching, she headed back inside despite every instinct telling her it was bad to do so and that she should get away. Inside, she paused to look about, and unable to help herself, she squatted and squirted in a few places. Stepping across the open space, her head swivelling back and forth as she looked about, she soon came to another open space, set up differently, and was taken back when she saw the thing that she was certain that had changed her just sitting out. Wondering if it was a trap, able to hear the person elsewhere, she crouched low, waited a moment before she stood, and with nimble movements, leapt to up to the thing.<br />
<br />
The surface she found herself on a titbit slick, yet similar to the one that had been before the clear opening, she edged toward the thing, and resisted the urge to bark and yelp when it came alive. Images played out before her, and though she couldn&#39;t read the words it produced, she understood after a bit that it was doing something that involved her as it blinked, one image disappeared and after a couple seconds another appeared that looked like her. Nosing at the picture, trying to work out what she was seeing, her first higher level idea began to form as she thought that if this thing had made her different, given her the capacity of like the one that was now elsewhere, perhaps it could do more. Extending a tentative paw out, she batted at the image, stepped forward, felt things beneath her paws shift, stepped back, and watched as the image changed as more images appeared and almost as if the programme knew how to help, it implemented certain changes to the picture. Watching as her front paws changed as more images were brought up, she didn&#39;t understand anything of what saw as she stepped forward to pat the screen and step on the part that shifted beneath her feet, knowing that by doing so, it altered things.<br />
<br />
In front of her, the programme had scanned the vixen, and after it had cycled through subroutines, it minimised Lisa&#39;s profile, and opened Tyler&#39;s as more inputs were given. Going through the commands it was given, dismissing the ones that didn&#39;t make sense, it sorted out to the best of its ability what to do, and after a bit, altered the front paws of the creature that was using it. As the appendages on the screen morphed so that they still looked like paws, yet, at the same time, appeared to have four stubby toes that could act as fingers whilst a new growth showed what was clearly a thumb, more instructions were given and after bit of computation, it downloaded into the fox&#39;s intelligence various levels of reading, writing, and arithmetic. Neither understanding fully what was being done, the programme felt back on subroutines imbedded that were meant to make it easier to use it, even if that meant altering the user, whilst the fox was only concerned with understanding better what had happened to her.<br />
<br />
A startled yip escaped her when the screen images blinked and a strange sensation overcame her after she&#39;d batted, poked and stepped on the thing for some time. Oblivious to how she&#39;d accidentally hit the key to accept the changes entered, she stepped back, shaking her head, and almost fell off the slick surface. Managing to keep her footing as new thoughts began to enter her mind as her front paws cramped up, she flexed her toes, as she stared at the thing before her she suddenly understood was called a laptop. Finding this exciting, she cocked her head and looked down at her front feet, and watched as they transformed into paw-like hands.<br />
<br />
The changes taking only a couple minutes, and causing her only the slightest discomfort, the vixen shook her head when it’d finished, lifted one front leg to shake her altered paw, then did the same with the other. Finding her awareness had increased, as well as her intelligence from about ninety to almost a hundred and nine, she stepped closer to the computer. Seeing the image of her profile pulled up, she cocked her head and thought in a stuttering way, &quot;Not, fox. Yet, am fox,&quot; and her mind growing used to what had been done to it, and what she now possessed, she soon asked herself, &quot;What am I?” before she extended a paw out to use her newly formed digits to explore the programme as she brainstormed about what she should do.</p>
