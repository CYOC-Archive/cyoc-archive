<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I um, I wish that you're dressed normally.&quot; Kyle was blushing and looking away again, but he looked back quickly as Jen gestured at herself.<br />
<br />
Jen sighed with relief and shifted to settle her feet in to her calf-length yellow cheer squad boots.  The pleated yellow and green skirt, while short, was certainly better coverage than the gauze-pants, and her cheerleader top, while formfitting, at least came with a bra and didn't leave her tits hanging out.<br />
<br />
She summoned the hand mirror back again and checked her make-up and the bright green scrunchy holding her hair back in a pony tail.<br />
<br />
thump thump thump &quot;Kyle!? Are you ready to go to school?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer and Kyle both spun around to stare at the door to his room as the knocking began again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle? I'm coming in!&quot;<br />
<br />
The doorknob began to turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hide!&quot; Kyle hissed frantically.<br />
<br />
Jen nodded and pulled out of the array of possibilities that she was seated in her car in the driveway.  No way was she getting back into that bottle unless he specifically ordered her to.  Jennifer was surprised that even though her body was now outside the house she was still aware of what was going on in Kyle's vicinity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!  I've asked you not to barge in here!&quot; Kyle was trembling he was so angry.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  I knocked.  And don't you look nice today!&quot; Kyle's mother, a slightly hippy woman in her mid-40's reached out to run her fingers through her son's hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; Kyle snapped jerking his head away from her touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now look, it's out of place, let me just..&quot; Kyle's mother hummed lightly as she patted his hair back into place.  &quot;I don't remember buying those; new clothes, new haircut, is there something you'd like to tell me young man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen honked the horn of her car, and pretended to look bored as she sensed Kyle and his mother staring out the window at her.  She looked up at Mrs Perkin's astonished expression and called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get your butt out here, Perkins, or we're going to be late!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is that?&quot; Kyle's mother asked softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's Jennifer Smith, she's...my DECA mentor--that business club you let me join?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jen smiled as the suggestions she planted took hold.  Her Master wishing to know what to say to his mother was something she, as a genie, could sense and fulfill.  She hummed to herself, appearing to check her make-up in the rear view as she made the needed changes at school.  She hoped her Master would be pleased.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's no business outfit she's wearing.&quot;  Mrs Perkins said critically.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she's a cheerleader too.  Mom, I don't want to make her late, she's giving me a ride in to school today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How sweet!  Has she got a boyfriend?&quot; She looked at her son speculatively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!?&quot; Kyle shouted blushing furiously, &quot;She's a senior!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Kyle grabbed his book bag and raced down the hall.<br />
<br />
Jen felt her awareness split several ways; she was aware of herself in her new super-fly G6 convertible, she was aware of Kyle jumping down the last few stairs on his way towards the door, she was aware of Kyle's mother--Janet--watching her out the window, and she was aware of the last changes she'd made at school settling into place.  She could feel something like ripples in reality at school, but none made recently or complicating what she was doing--maybe some remnants of the town curse? Jen resolved to look into them later.<br />
<br />
Kyle slammed through the front door and hurried out to the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought I was busted for sure.&quot; He said tossing his bag in back next to Jen's.  &quot;I told my mom we're in DECA together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we are...now.&quot; Jen smiled at his startled look.  &quot;I did a little eavesdropping,&quot; she said backing out onto the street. &quot;and backed up what you told her.&quot;  She smiled over at her Master. &quot;You think very fast on your feet!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thanks!  But um, I don't remember you ever being in DECA, I mean it's not the sort of thing the cool kids do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No?&quot; Jen asked, then reached over to lay her hand on the freshman's forehead. &quot;How about now?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen grinned and concentrated on driving as Kyle went cross-eyed with all the supporting memories she'd just dumped into his head.  How she and other cheerleaders had become involved in DECA before he'd even started highschool, how once he'd paid his dues working the school store and concessions at sporting events he'd been paired up with Jen as his mentor.  He even remembered her taking him to the mall for a crash course in men's fashion and a haircut, so she could show him off at school today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap! Don't ever do that again without my permission!&quot; Kyle was pale and shaking in the passenger seat.  The look he was giving her made it clear he was pretty wigged out by what she'd done.<br />
<br />
Jen felt something like her wish sense expanding for her to interpret her Master's order: don't touch his forehead? Don't give him information he needed? don't give him memories? don't change reality for his convenience? Jen settled on defining &quot;Don't ever do that again without my permission!&quot; as &quot;don't blatantly put a bunch of memories in my head&quot;  She felt 'blatant' and 'bunch' were important, since she might need to subtly slip some memories in some time, and now she had a couple loopholes to Kyle's command.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master, I won't Master.&quot; Jen signaled a turn and pulled onto the stretch of highway running through downtown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I guess you'd better call me Kyle, at least where anyone could overhear you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen filed away her new order, noting that 'where anyone could overhear' could mean pretty much everywhere, but she'd be sure to use 'Master' enough to keep him happy, even though he'd basically given her permission to never use it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing Kyle.  I didn't think you'd mind if I got rid of the pantsing incident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I--wait, no one remembers that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one but me and you.&quot; Jen said, pulling into the parking lot reserved for seniors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Um, thanks Jen.&quot; Kyle was all smiles again.<br />
<br />
Jen pulled into a parking space.  &quot;Better make that 'Jennifer,' officially I'm still a senior, cheer leading captain, &quot;cool kid&quot;, and you're still the kinda dorky freshman I've been assigned to mentor.&quot;  She leaded over and whispered softly. &quot;Don't worry, we're going to hit it off just fine!&quot;  <br />
<br />
She smiled at her Master, pleased that this whole 'being a genie' thing was turning out so well.</p>
