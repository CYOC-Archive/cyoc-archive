<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Thelma met Max they were in high school. He was just the kind of man her parents hated. She was from a <br />
well to do family. Not really rich but he was definitely not the kind of man they wanted their little girl to <br />
get involved with. They wanted her be with someone that had a goal in mind and would take care of their little <br />
girl. <br />
<br />
Thelma had just recently realized what her parents had wanted for her and her nagging was no help in getting <br />
this lout to change his behavior. It just angered him and he would take it out on her. <br />
<br />
First few times were a few smacks on the ass. <br />
<br />
Then progressing to a black eye or two. <br />
<br />
The last time she was knocked down the steps and had a couple broken ribs, a smashed nose and a sprained <br />
ankle. She was finally scared that he might kill her. <br />
<br />
She still loved his looks. That jet black curly hair. That chiseled jaw line with the permanent 5 o'clock <br />
shadow. The pecs from his years a high school football. But that belly was beginning to show the years of beer <br />
drinking. He had intended to go on to college and become a football hero and maybe play pro but getting Thelma <br />
pregnant put an end to those goals. He blamed her which wasn't fair but the nagging didn't help.<br />
<br />
And that was why he kept going back to him. He was hansom but this was the last straw.<br />
<br />
She found Christian on Craig's List and he sent her a place to meet. She showed up and sat at the corner table <br />
of the Starbucks and waited for him to show up.<br />
<br />
A guy came up and asked, Thelma?<br />
<br />
Yes, Chris?<br />
<br />
The shook hands and he sat down cross from her. So tell me about this guy you are married to. <br />
<br />
So for hours she told him every bit of their life together. <br />
<br />
And when she finished she said what can you do for me I need to hide from him and my baby doll, talking about <br />
her little girl.<br />
<br />
Well I could change you and your little girl into a different stronger willed person.<br />
<br />
That would be good. What did you have in mind?<br />
<br />
Something more like Zena Warrior Princess. Without all the armor, swords, etc.<br />
<br />
Ok.<br />
<br />
Or I could do something else.<br />
<br />
She started to ask what and then got up and said never mind I will just go to the women's center. They will <br />
protect me. This was a mistake.<br />
<br />
Thelma. I have an idea Chris said to her grasping her hand lightly and looking into her eyes. Do you trust me?<br />
<br />
I don't even know you.<br />
<br />
But do you think after you exposed yourself to me in these hours that I know you pretty well and will do what <br />
is best for you?<br />
<br />
I don't know.<br />
<br />
I have an idea and I will make sure that if you don't like it I will change things back.<br />
<br />
Would you trust me?<br />
<br />
Yea. She said dejectedly thinking she made a mistake by calling him. Sure. Whatever. She pulled away from him <br />
and went out the door.<br />
<br />
Chris started to work his magic. It took weeks to figure out the plan he had in his head but when he had it <br />
ready he gave Thelma a call and asked her to meet him back at the Starbucks and when she finally came to meet <br />
him she came through the door and with her was her husband Max.<br />
<br />
He held her arm in a vice grip. <br />
<br />
As he saw her coming through the door and head to him he pulled out the chronivac and put it on the table in <br />
front of him. <br />
<br />
He saw the message you sent me and he demanded to come too. <br />
<br />
Chris saw the welts forming on her arm. <br />
<br />
What is all this about? Max asked.<br />
<br />
You been cheatin on me?<br />
<br />
No. I just needed someone to talk to.<br />
<br />
Thelma you need to sit down. Max come sit next to her.<br />
<br />
As they sat at the table Chris told Max, Thelma was scared last time you hit her. She still finds you <br />
attractive but she is scared of you. Would you do something to hurt her?<br />
<br />
I might. It just depends on how much I believe you.<br />
<br />
And do you believe me?<br />
<br />
I don't know.<br />
<br />
Well Thelma then what do you think? We had a talk and I told you I had a solution. Are you still interested?<br />
<br />
I don't know.<br />
<br />
Well I have been working on this for the last few weeks and if you are interested just tap that button right <br />
there and you will have your dream come true.<br />
<br />
But I don't know what my dream is.<br />
<br />
I do.<br />
<br />
How could you.<br />
<br />
You were very open when we talked. You let your inner self pour out and I think I got it right. <br />
<br />
If you want this just tap the button.<br />
<br />
Don't you dare babe. As Max lifted his hand to backhand her again she quickly tapped the button and the <br />
changes happened.</p>
