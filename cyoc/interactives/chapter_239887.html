<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve wasn’t sure if it was Leon the lion’s pretransformation personality, or something that had been inserted into him when he’d been transformed into an anthro lion slave owner, but Leon leaped into action almost before the doe’s water had hit the ground.<br />
<br />
“We need to move everyone out of the room!” He shouted, before turning to the otter and rabbits, “Henry, you and the rest of the g… guys pick Austin up and take her to another room.”<br />
<br />
Turning to the doe, Leon told the rest of the group to help her to a bed.  He then looked down at Steve, but before Leon could say anything, Steve interjected, “sorry master, I had a false contraction and I panicked.”<br />
<br />
“You’re not in labor?”<br />
<br />
“No master.”<br />
<br />
Leon sighed, “look I’m sorry.  I feel for your situation but if you’re not in labor then, I can’t have you stay here smelling like this.  I’m going to take you back to your car and you can go somewhere else.”<br />
<br />
Steve’s body replied with a simple, “ok master,” which belied the overwhelming relief that he felt internally.  Steve had read about false contractions, but everything that he had read made them sound as though they weren’t as horrific as that one had been.  The idea that his body might have been designed specifically to endure something like that was unsettling, especially because that implied that the app derived some amount of pleasure from it.<br />
<br />
He also knew that he was going to be experiencing those on a somewhat regular basis from now on.  After all, there was a reason that women often took maternity leave a few weeks before they were due – spending most of that time laying in bed.  He’d read about women crying because of false contractions much less severe than what he’d experienced, which didn’t give him any optimism for his own future.<br />
<br />
Still, Steve reminded himself, he was a man, not a woman.  He’d never depended on anyone else, and he’d spent his life learning how to endure.  If anyone could suck it up and ignore a measly little false contraction, it was a man like him.<br />
<br />
Leon carried him back to the car, even going so far as to help guide Steve’s tail into the seat hole.  Steve leaned back into the chair, placing his weight into Leon’s arm as he did so.  He couldn’t help but notice how strong Leon was, despite which the lion was incredibly gentle and…<br />
<br />
No!  Just as it had when he’d been turned into a rabbit, Steve’s body was trying to get him to give in to the transformation, but by now he was experienced enough to recognize it.  “I’m not a girl,” he chanted under his breath, “I’m not going to give birth.”<br />
<br />
“What was that?”  The lion must have heard Steve muttering to himself.<br />
<br />
“I’m trying to keep my spirits up, master.”<br />
<br />
With Steve now firmly in the seat, Leon backed out of the car and brought a hand to his chin.  Quizzically looking at Steve, he said, “you and other uh… ok look I’m trying to be sensitive, but I don’t want to beat around the bush here.  You and the other pregnant girls all keep calling me master.  Why do you do that?”<br />
<br />
“Because we’re you’re slaves master.  You own us.  We have to do what you say.”<br />
<br />
Steve hadn’t noticed the phone’s glow when he’d entered the car, and by this point its battery must have run out.  Nonetheless, Steve felt that evil black miasma pour out of it, but this time it seemed to pass by him as it reached out towards Leon.<br />
<br />
The lion’s face briefly curled into an evil sneer as his eyes scanned across Steve’s breasts, before moving to his gravid belly and, finally, his tight little skunk cunt.  Steve barely had time to wonder what was going through the lion’s mind before one of the pulsating tentacles swung around and passed straight into Steve’s forehead.<br />
<br />
He saw the overly pregnant skunk girl from earlier, except instead of sitting in Steve’s car, she was now tied down to one of the birthing beds.  <br />
<br />
“Please master!” she begged, “please I’m sorry.  I’ll do…”  But the poor pregnant girl didn’t have time to complete her sentence before the lion stuck a finger into her mouth.  Then, Steve saw the lion’s other hand – and the phone that it was holding.<br />
<br />
The lion opened up Steve’s app, targeted the skunk girl, and generated a sentence.  Steve couldn’t read what it said, but it didn’t matter as the lion asked the skunk girl, “do you want to know what this says?”<br />
<br />
She just shook her head.  No, she didn’t want to know.  She didn’t want to be changed.  But it didn’t matter as the lion read it to her anyways:<br />
<br />
“Leon’s finger is stuck in the dumb anthro skunk breeding slave’s delicate throat.”<br />
<br />
The lion chuckled to himself, “maybe I should change breeding slave to ‘fitness champion’.  Would you like that, you dumb little skunk?  Would you like me to let you go?<br />
<br />
The skunk girl nodded as hard as she could, all while trying to moan, “yes.  Please master.  Let me go!”<br />
<br />
A sneer overtook the lion’s mouth as he typed at the screen, “no, I think I’ll change ‘delicate throat’ to, oh what’s a body part that you deserve to spend the rest of your life dealing with?”<br />
<br />
The lion acted as though he was pondering for a second, before he said two simple words, “chicken cloaca”.<br />
<br />
Removing his finger from the skunk’s throat, Leon seemed to laugh as she begged, “no master!   Please… no don’t… I ppfffon’t.” The words blended into the sound of a wet fart as the skunk slammed her mouth shut and began shaking her head in disbelief.<br />
<br />
The lion broke into laughter, “oh boy, don’t tell me that you can still talk by farting out of that thing!  What does it taste like?  No, wait don’t tell me, I’m sure it’s just as horrible as you are.”  He then leaned in close and began whispering the skunk’s ear, “and with a few more edits, I’m going to make sure that you’re laying enormous eggs out of it too.”<br />
<br />
Leon stood up and began walking away, before briefly turning around and laughing, “I don’t know if you ever wanted to find out what chickenshit tastes like but don’t worry, you will by the end of the day.”</p>
