<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You looked over the group gathered around the modest kitchen table in the Vaxer home and felt rather pleased with how things had been going. You hadn&#39;t planned on an in-depth planning session for the wedding between you and Luna and you had even fewer expectations that your father would participate in it. But Kellie and Roxie had apparently wanted to get ahead of things with regard to the wedding, so that you and Luna could have it before her pregnancy became too obvious and had even reached out to include your father in the wedding planning. The discussion had also gone quite well, there were plenty of moments where some of your father&#39;s biases and opinions were there, but they weren&#39;t pointed, and he didn&#39;t stick on them. At the same time, he&#39;d also done a lot to show a lot of tolerance for you, which seemed to reinforce the sort of sense that he wasn&#39;t going to die on his proverbial sword if it meant straining the relationship between you. That was something you liked, and you couldn&#39;t help but smile a bit as you sat there.<br />
<br />
You thought the discussion had largely reached its end in terms of knowing what to do in terms of the wedding. Where it would be was discussed and how it would be run was discussed. You&#39;d all discussed possible music for the wedding and what you and Luna would wear. There would be some things that would have to be done that would work with that, but those were also things that would relate carrying out the plan that was being put together now. That seemed all set, and there had even been some discussion on the cake, which would relate to the reception. You figured that would cover just about everything. It was only when Luna spoke up again when there seemed to be another thing that might be a topic related to all the planning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of cake... that sounds more like things for the reception,&quot; Luna commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is when the cake is had when it comes to weddings,&quot; Roxie smiled, &quot;Given that you and Nicki think the ceremony will be small, we figured this wouldn&#39;t be something big...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we wanted it to be our gift to you,&quot; Kellie added, &quot;our baby girl makes friends and then gets to marry her best friend. It&#39;s like the perfect romance novel.&quot;<br />
<br />
You did your best not to groan, but you found yourself giving a slight grimace. It was an odd thing, in that to a great degree, you privately agreed that since you and Luna had found out you&#39;d both secretly loved each other, that your relationship had become something like a romance novel, but that didn&#39;t mean it was your favorite genre. You knew that Luna also liked the same genre you did, but you weren&#39;t sure if she might also like romance stories.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I&#39;m not really a fan, either,&quot; Roxie chuckled, &quot;but Kellie is right in describing things as it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s all fine,&quot; Luna added, &quot;I&#39;d just like to put in my two cents on where it should be and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead, dear,&quot; Kellie said to Luna, ignoring your cringe at the romance novel reference and Roxie&#39;s chuckle at it.<br />
<br />
Luna nodded and then spoke, &quot;given that the time for the wedding would be at two to three for the moment, the reception would only need cake and cider... since Nickie and I are only 18.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded in acceptance of that, &quot;and that would be easy to get.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is good,&quot; Luna spoke, &quot;but in case you and dad haven&#39;t thought on where the reception would be... could I suggest that we have that here. It won&#39;t be a big event, and our backyard is nice enough...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was our plan,&quot; Roxie answered, &quot;as most of the adults might need to get back to work and all that... even if your friends respond well and come to the wedding... they may have some summer work that they can&#39;t get out of for long. So, the reception could be smaller than the wedding, and since it&#39;d be after lunch... there wouldn&#39;t be the need for something served as an entree.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna blew out some air through her lips and then nodded before giving a good smile, &quot;then that&#39;s a good plan. We can set out some of the deck chairs or even some of the folding ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I could bring over some of my lawn chairs if you need extra,&quot; your father offered, &quot;they may not match... but they&#39;d be extra chairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that can wait until we know for sure who will be coming to the reception,&quot; you said to him.<br />
<br />
Your father nodded in that, &quot;and you and Luna can let me know when you get the answers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will,&quot; Luna smiled, &quot;and thank you. Both you...&quot; Luna then looked over to Roxie and Kellie, &quot;and you too, mom, dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got your dad to blink again and that caught your attention, as he looked to Luna with a bit more curiosity as he did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have to forgive me... but I have a question,&quot; your father began, &quot;but I seem to recall you calling your... father as an aunt at times when you&#39;ve come to visit Nick in the past. At the time, I thought that it was a reference to an aunt and that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re curious as to why I&#39;ve often referred to Roxie as my aunt before now?&quot; Luna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way... I mean, I don&#39;t want to come off as offensive or anything,&quot; your father answered, &quot;I have my beliefs and many of them aren&#39;t going to change, but I don&#39;t want to start a fight while planning a wedding for my child. Who will always be precious to me, regardless of gender.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be offensive,&quot; Roxie spoke, &quot;and to a degree, Kellie and I have often encouraged it, at least while Luna was in school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But with all the registration rules and all that?&quot; your father looked to Roxie.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s there and in pure theory people would and should know about us being MILF-wolves as a result of it,&quot; Roxie answered, &quot;but when Kellie was bitten and then I became a MILF-wolf there was a lot of surprise and attention... and came will all the sorts of things that could be negative. Some afraid that we&#39;d just go around forcing people to become MILF-wolves or over hunting the region, some of the same things that go along with regular werewolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then once the surprise at Rook becoming Roxie went away,&quot; Kellie picked up, &quot;there then came some of the people who hadn&#39;t paid attention to the registration rules and began to as questions on how I was doing without my husband. It made the explanations embarrassing and frustrating when they had to be repeated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And in time, Kellie and I got wore out by it,&quot; Roxie added, &quot;we like being MILF-wolves and we love that our marriage has lasted despite all of the physical changes in our forms, but we didn&#39;t want that to be the sole focus of our lives and everything we do. And we didn&#39;t want that to become a distraction for Luna. So... we encouraged her to refer to me as an &quot;aunt&quot; outside of meetings with other members of the local pack or with those that are family friends. It was easier and would let have some measure of privacy. Or at least what we can manage. If someone did follow the registration rules and knew... they&#39;d obviously know he deception and we&#39;d then explain that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they&#39;ve been rather rare,&quot; Luna picked up, &quot;about the only one that I can think of was a woman from out of town that wanted to become a MILF-wolf because she felt the transformation would cure her cancer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But wouldn&#39;t people get upset by it?&quot; your father asked to Kellie and to Luna, &quot;that the answer isn&#39;t consistent?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If they figure it out, we&#39;d explain the reasoning,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;as just because we have to register as MILF-wolves, doesn&#39;t mean we want every minute of our lives being spent talking about it. We would like as much privacy as we can have. And those that have figured it out beforehand have often understood. Particularly when we&#39;re also remembering that Rook and I had a normal male/female pairing until we became MILF-wolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And most of those we&#39;ve explained this to when they have found have understood,&quot; Roxie commented, &quot;they actually agree with the idea of wanting some privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; your father managed, &quot;do you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re fine with either option,&quot; Kellie assured him, &quot;as in pure theory, most people should know we&#39;re MILF-wolves and by now... Luna is old enough that those sorts of questions over Rook now being Roxie wouldn&#39;t be the distraction that they might have been when she was little.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wanted to make sure,&quot; your father finished and then looked to you, &quot;you&#39;ll let me know when you and Luna have the time to get things like the suit and dresses you&#39;ll need? As it would be a big trip.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; you answered, &quot;and it&#39;d probably end up involving everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your father nodded.</p>
