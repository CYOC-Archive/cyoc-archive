<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh you know, trying to figure out something to wear for the Mister, I was hoping a star designer like you would help me out...? Maybe a football jersey and panties...?&quot; Megan asked, and Wilma predicted the puppy dog tone meant she was in yet another fashion bind.<br />
<br />
Wilma sighed, smiling, though a bit exasperated as a personal fashionista.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I swear, I&#39;m in the same boat as you, girl. If I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d wager Alex would prefer a man&#39;s company over mine at times. Did you know-&quot; Wilma froze as the ring took its effect, glowering a gold light as it came to life. <br />
<br />
Time slowed to a crawl as Wilma&#39;s body pulsated and rippled, the flesh in her chest had bounced, bulging comically as the phone in her grip had fallen and levitated in the air.<br />
<br />
The supple shapes of Wilma&#39;s arm filled out, her body convulsing as her upper back swelled up, tugging on the straps of her summer dress. Arms stretching forward, the growth flowed above into her shoulders, the deltoids burgeoning and forcing the dress straps to seek refuge in her daintier neck. This was not for long, however, as her neck throbbed, a mass poked out of her throat which created a much deeper, more powerful voice as broad traps eagerly peaked to match their predecessors&#39; size. <br />
<br />
The gentle, though, ample bosom that accentuated the sumptuous necklace Alex had bought her on their first anniversary could no longer hold its form, the pulsating flesh lost its flabbiness, pushing upwards and flattening. A dusting of body hair crawled up from Wilma&#39;s thickening hands, the fingers plumping up healthily as the gaudy nail polish becoming transparent and losing luster. Power surged upwards from the widening wrists, triceps bulked and biceps had formed, decent baseball like shapes before expanding as though they were clay formed by an invisible artist. Veins that had not seen the light of the day had made themselves known, the renewed body took in more fuel as blood maneuvered to maintain the new figure, testosterone pumped throughout Wilma&#39;s body, hair becoming more pronounced as her ring widened to keep itself on its host comfortably.<br />
<br />
Wilma&#39;s legs quivered, before bulking up, the calves not far behind as they defined themselves tremendously, though the weight of the blossoming woman had begun to take its toll both on the summer dress she wore, but also the high heels that were currently plaguing her feet. Her petite, though sizable ass had perked up, inflating as fat pooled into the muscles generously, and it too, toughened into rough granite that squeezed and flexed constantly. Lace panties accentuated the gargantuan lower body as a sizable lump had begun its formation, Wilma&#39;s feminine slit had gained a rather different companion that fought for space.<br />
<br />
Her flattened chest heaved forward, creating a shapely pair of pecs that easily ripped apart the light sterling silver necklace and straining the dress to its last limbs. Not one to waste prime material, the ring&#39;s power had graced upon the two, the silver reforming round the growing human&#39;s physique and thickened into a much larger chain. The simple name brand charm crunched, crumbling into a circular like shape before stretching and formatting itself into a side ways water bottle like shape, before forming into an unmistakably fashioned dumbbell. The yellow summer dress finally tore at the sides as Wil&#39;s back flared out and became wings that would make an eagle envious, the torn dress had thinned out severely as it changed from a cotton blend into a silky material extending past down Wil&#39;s still measurable waist and stomach. It tugged itself, canvassing the larger torso and invisible air flew through it, cementing its existence as a newly minted tank top that gave a pertinent view of the chest painstakingly carved. The lower part of the dress shrunk, following a similar fate as its counter part, effectively wavering as invisible air puffed the dress into a pair of exercise shorts, the bright yellow desaturating into a neutral gray and night black to accentuate the tree trunk legs that were being sported.<br />
<br />
Wil&#39;s jaw cracked and expanded, as the once feminine slit that had adorned the body had shrunk alongside the once burgeoning stomach, time had rewinded to where the previous effects of the ring were not affecting the host&#39;s body as it continued to transform, an impressive tool emerged from Wil&#39;s crotch and enforcing his masculinity. Wil&#39;s hair traveled alongside the forged cock, as a pair of plump and heavy balls emerged from the slit before it closed, ending its time on Wil&#39;s person as his jaw became lantern shaped and bristles of stubble poked themselves through, cleanly and trimmed. As his testes churned and flooded with vitality, Wilbur&#39;s lengthy tresses had thinned, time rewinding the locks as they receded into his head until he had a faded undercut. His eyebrows, previously thin and dainty had thickened and became slightly brutish due to the excess testosterone filling Wilbur&#39;s lacking area. <br />
<br />
Previously hanging and dangling earrings crumbled and were illuminated as they were reformed into diamond shaped studs, and Wilbur&#39;s fashionable pouted lips had lost a bit of volume as the pink lipstick faded away. While he maintained a stoic expression, Wilbur&#39;s previously flat and unimpressive stomach ballooned as his back enjoyed a renewed posture. The formless mass defined itself, as the lats begun to hammer away and make their indentations known, and a chiseled cobblestone had made its home underneath the swath that were his pecs. The waist line expanded, though, it cinched itself appetizingly against the shorts and the ample canvas of the tank top as his lashes lost its lusciousness and volume, instead chiseling his cheek bones more as he became the pinnacle of fitness.<br />
<br />
In a final act of defiance and transformation, the previously topaz high heels broke under the pressure of the heavily built man as the elongating feet tore through them like tissue paper. The ring easily rendered this a non issue, as the heels lost their luster and warped into a pair of yellow flip flops that were much more suited to his new daily ritual of lounging by the pool with his husband. The previously falling phone levitated, just as Wilbur&#39;s body righted itself, ceasing its convulsions and mimicking the previous pose it had held before, sassily holding onto the phone and mulling over a new sheet of designs of men&#39;s underwear meant for both lingerie and fitness uses.<br />
<br />
Wilbur felt a familiar sense of vertigo as reality shifted once again and found himself somewhat dazed, Alex was now married to Wilbur, an impressive male fashion designer of his favorite sports brands and an even more impressive athlete under the bed sheets. Though the two could not keep their hands off one another, Wilbur had wanted a child of his own, and this was something that had stayed within even the opposite reality as well. Time once again took its place as Wilbur continued as though nothing happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;-- That when I asked Alex for his opinion on the designs, he said I ought to wear them myself? And here I am, wearing something that looks like women&#39;s lingerie.&quot; Wilbur chuckled deeply, it was ironic, he knew, Alex loved himself a man that could match him, but to wear something akin to a woman&#39;s clothing? It was different, it was hot, it was <I>so</I> Wilbur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Men, amiright? Well look, I know if there was ever someone to ask what a man should wear, I&#39;d say it was you, Wilby. Say, why don&#39;t you take Tyler along with you to the gym sometime and show him the ropes? Maybe you can whip him into shape like you and Alex have been doing?&quot; Megan said quizzically, Wilbur rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno, I mean, yeah I trained Alex since we were young, but compared to Tyler, Alex has a bit more youthful energy, I like that in him, it&#39;s more personal when I train someone who can easily do the stuff he does like it&#39;s nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Outside, lounging on his pool raft, Alex rested with his sunglasses up, unaware as he drifted in and out of consciousness as his body bulked up slightly to fit Wilbur&#39;s words. His deep inset wrinkles lightened slightly, as he deaged to 32, effectively making him Wilbur&#39;s junior, though, as his body stretched and engorged on itself, it was more noticeable to see who was reaping the benefits of his work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, I&#39;m practically begging on my knees, last night, I couldn&#39;t see anything past his tummy Wilby, I love him, but, I wanna enjoy the intimacy too! You know what I mean, right? We&#39;ve tried everything, dieting, slim cuts, the works!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wilbur hummed, nixing one design that seemed too garish and moving it aside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, why not, maybe he can swing around today or tomorrow and we can do a lil something. Gym&#39;s a religious thing, but, maybe this could be an opportunity to come up with a new set of gear for the company...&quot; Wilbur noted matter of factly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re a lifesaver Wilbur! He&#39;ll be there, you can count on it!&quot; Megan said excitedly on the other line, clearly ecstatic about her victory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, you do that girl,&quot; Wilbur said, smiling as he hung up and sighed.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Alex awoke groggily to the sound of someone dropping lazily into the pool and pointed his sunglasses to see Wilbur sighing as he let his feet rest in the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sup handsome,&quot; Alex teased, hands drifting to the dark navy speedo and tugging it up in a rare sign of decency.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; Wilbur said softly, stretching his foot into the water. &quot;Megs wants us to train with Tyler sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex scoffed. &quot;That blowhard? You&#39;re only doing this because she&#39;s your best friend huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno, she was really not into his gut obscuring his, you know what.&quot; Wilbur shrugged. Alex smiled, diving into the water and swimming over to his husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I know what I want, and I think you know what it is too, don&#39;t you?&quot; He smirked. Wilbur smiled, as Alex began to tug off the tank top and leaned forward to taste his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah.&quot;</p>
