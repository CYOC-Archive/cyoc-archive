<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle did feel a little bad for Greg as he heard the feminine moans several blocks away, he wondered what Greg&#39;s parents would think, they were just as trashy as he was. Kyle shrugged and began to walk home, unknown to him, the curse had altered the reality of what SMS was capable of due to his use of it in his curse on Greg. It had altered the condition so that the majority of cases were found in people between preteen ages to about twenty years old. The younger you were when it affected you, the more likely you&#39;d be to have a second round later on, which while unpredictable, would always heavily alter the rest of the individual&#39;s body. Kyle had just made his bed, and would have to lie in it soon.<br />
<br />
After he got home, he got something to eat, he had been eating much more since gaining these four legs, today however he was much more ravenous, downing two whole frozen pizzas, and still having room for a pint of ice cream. Something felt off to him, he normally wasn&#39;t this hungry, but this was a symptom of an oncoming episode, the other was about to rear it&#39;s lustful head. Kyle finished in the kitchen and started to feel a bit horny, he had been playing with his four permanent playmates a lot, but it hadn&#39;t really affected his habits, he did moderate his playtime to prevent injury. Today however he found himself ridiculously hungry for sex.<br />
<br />
Getting to the bedroom he practically tore off his clothes, scrambling to find relief he grabbed the four trusty vibrators that had become so familiar and started into his ritual masturbation, but it wasn&#39;t enough to do the usual, he orgasmed again and again. After three hours he finally felt somewhat satiated, his mother had come home shortly after he finished, she knew he had been playing with himself, but she worried that he was showing new symptoms, in the morning she would find out she was right. Kyle in a daze cleaned up after himself, took a cold shower on shaky legs and freshened his room. After an hour or so he decided to just go to bed early, having exhausted himself he went to sleep.<br />
<br />
He dreamed the craziest, wettest dream he had ever dreamt that night, he was being fucked by four unknown men, and enjoying every second of it, when out of nowhere, none other that Mrs. Lorenza walked up, and settled down on his cock, riding him, her large and luscious breasts bouncing hypnotically, he came into her and she leaned closer and whispered into his ear. “More?” she lustfully asked, “More.” Kyle moaned to her, the dream continued all night as SMS wreaked havoc to his body, when he woke he&#39;d be a completely different person.<br />
<br />
“Honey..” Kyle heard his mother calmly calling him. “Honey...”<br />
<br />
“Yeah...&#39; Kyle said, half awake he didn&#39;t notice the difference in his voice.<br />
<br />
“Honey, just stay calm, something&#39;s happened to you.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Kyle opened his eyes, now awake and hearing not his own voice but Mrs. Lorenza&#39;s. “What happened to me?” Kyle stayed laying down and taking in all the new sensations.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;ve had a relapse of SMS, you may want to take it easy. Just stay calm and look down.”<br />
<br />
Kyle looked down and gasped. “Holy Fuck.” On his chest were two of the biggest breasts he had ever witnessed. He sat up and panicked as he rose higher than usual, he grasped at the breasts and felt not one pair but four pairs of hands reach up and cup four pairs of breasts. “Woah, um... yeah, I think your right.” <br />
<br />
“You&#39;re oddly... calm about this.” His mom said.<br />
<br />
“Well, what am I going to do about it? Not like I can change it, I was already a freak to begin with and... holy shit that&#39;s a lot of cock.” Kyle stopped as he looked down toward his pelvis, which was now larger, matching the color of his four Lorenza legs, his cock and legs however had changed, his cock had receded into another pussy, while his legs had morphed into two, very large cocks, matching the flesh color of the rest of his body. They lay there, erect and throbbing, his legs had shrank as they changed, but they still were two feet long, with baseball sized balls. He reached down with one set of his hands and touched them, then startled lifted all four sets up to see them. “These are just like Mrs. Lorenza&#39;s hands! Is there anything left of me?” Kyle bolted out of bed, not thinking about the changes to his body and stumbled, hitting the floor in a mess of limbs. He looked up in the mirror and saw his own pale face and sighed. Getting himself together he stood up slowly, his luscious legs trembled slightly. <br />
<br />
“Are you okay honey?” <br />
<br />
“No... but I&#39;ll be fine, I just got to take this in.” Kyle looked at his reflection, in front of him was a truly strange sight. On four sets of legs was a torso of the same light brown color, adorned with four large pairs of breasts, with four sets of arms and shoulders lined up perfectly with the breasts, he was now not six feet tall, but eight, the extended torso giving the extra height, he moved his hands around. “Huh... just like they&#39;re natural, that&#39;s a plus.” On top of this torso was the slender neck one would expect, but on top of that neck was the pale and average face of Kyle, his short brown hair having grown longer into wavy shoulder length hair. He looked further down at the cocks, moved his legs around to see if there was anything left of his own old body, huffed and then turned around to look at his mom, bare breasts exposed for her to see.<br />
<br />
“Well.... shit.” He said in a honey Latin voice. “I think we need to call Mrs. Lorenza.”<br />
<br />
“Why, shouldn&#39;t we call a doctor?” His mom cocked her eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“What are they gonna say? Oh, you&#39;ve had a relapse of SMS, there&#39;s really nothing we can do, you&#39;ll just have to live with it from now on. Why waste the time?”<br />
<br />
“But why Isibella?”<br />
<br />
“Because...” He gestured to his four new busts, “I;m pretty sure these are just like hers, she&#39;ll know my new bust size.”<br />
<br />
“You are really calm about this.” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, well.... it&#39;s not like I want this, but I can make this work.” He turned back around. “But what am I going to wear other than four bras?” His mom laughed at this, he was going to be alright, but on the other side of town, his friend Jennifer was waking up to a new set of problems of her own.</p>
