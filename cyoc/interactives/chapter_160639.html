<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The warning is more for the mention of things that carried over from the last chapter.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aaron Tachibana was quick to pay attention to what had happened and did what he could to make sure Rachel wouldn&#39;t be infected, and for the moment, her scent was that of a normal human being, which meant that she hadn&#39;t swallowed any of his semen and that she didn&#39;t have any open wounds. Ever prepared for most things like this, he retrieved some paper towels that he kept in his closet to clean up  after nights when he&#39;d either been alone or with someone who&#39;d come home with him and something like this happened. It was all part of a measure of responsibility that every were-species expected of its members, and after the antics that Yvette Smith had caused, the Skulk was especially sensitive to this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m really sorry,&quot; Aaron said softly to her as he carefully wiped away the remnants of his orgasm from Rachel&#39;s hair, face, and hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay... I mean... becoming a werefox is one of the two choices I&#39;d narrowed things down to... and possibly the one I&#39;d prefer,&quot; Rachel answered as Aaron tossed the first paper towel into a wastepaper basket that was next to the bed, &quot;and to be honest... I kinda got lost what you were doing... which was very good, though this is the first time I&#39;ve ever been in a situation like this... so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But if you hadn&#39;t made the final pick yet, that could still count as me taking advantage of you,&quot; Aaron answered, &quot;and that&#39;s something that Moon Lake looks down heavily on. While the Mandatory Were Law does say that at least one member of a new family must join were society... it&#39;s with the condition that the &quot;family were&quot; has the choice of what were to be. No were is to try and take away that specific choice, and that could be taken as a violation of Statute 1A.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel nodded. She thought she remembered Melissa saying something about that, but at the moment with all the stuff that related to her father&#39;s response to Moon Lake that she&#39;d observed and what she&#39;d gotten out of her dreams, she was more nervous over what might happen that would relate to that. For if her father tried to flee and got caught, the end result would end up being having her choices taken away in accordance with the Mandatory Were Law. Though she also noted Aaron coming forward again.<br />
<br />
Aaron did so, and kept periodically sniffing, mostly to make sure that he&#39;d gotten everything off of Rachel. Not necessarily to hide it from his family or anything like that, as just about every were knew that teenage weres had the potential to be even more hormonally charged than adult weres. They may not necessarily want their children to be heavily active, but Aaron had the sense that they also recognized that forcing some kind of puritanism wouldn&#39;t help either, thus why so many classes in the Middle School grades were specially taught to help born weres and Moon Lake normals understand just how humans became weres and the safety measures that would prevent accidental changes.<br />
<br />
And what had gone on was something that could lead to that. The fact that Rachel didn&#39;t begin to immediately change was enough to prove that she hadn&#39;t swallowed any of his semen, and that was a good thing, but the fact that he&#39;d gotten it on her as a result of their fun was enough raise the potential for it. From what Aaron new, the were virus lost its potency when exposed to the air and that once it dried, it wouldn&#39;t be infectious anymore, but given that it was approaching nighttime now, it was likely that they wouldn&#39;t have that time to wait. Thus he came in close and gave a few hesitant sniffs, making sure there wasn&#39;t any trace of semen on her. The only thing that he could pick up was a small trace on the outer part of Rachel&#39;s lips. It wasn&#39;t at a point where it would have gone into her mouth and most of hit was likely removed with the paper towel, but Aaron couldn&#39;t let anything infect her and thus gave a few licks and removed the last of what was there, and was sure as he picked up the salty taste on his tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...!&quot; Rachel began as she stepped back, &quot;what...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just making sure you were clean,&quot; Aaron spoke, &quot;I&#39;m sure Megumi told you that you can&#39;t become a were by kissing or holding hands... but if anything of me was in a position where you could swallow it, at least potentially, I&#39;d then be responsible for taking your choices away and I wouldn&#39;t want to do that to you... Not to mention the further consequences that might happen if... well... I&#39;m sure Megumi told you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her and my best friend, Melissa,&quot; Rachel nodded, remembering the discussion how fertile weres were or at least could be, &quot;though again... while there is one other were species representative I&#39;d like to talk to... I&#39;m largely leaning towards becoming a werefox.&quot; She paused as her cheeks flushed red with a blush, &quot;and you didn&#39;t necessarily do anything that would change my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron found himself giving a rather dopey grin at that, as he found Rachel quite beautiful and very forward with regard to some things. It&#39;d been his experience that normal humans that were so easily interested in becoming weres were usually Moon Lake normals, who were either born in Moon Lake and lived with weres all their lives or were quite young when they moved to Moon Lake and their parents, or an older sibling, became the family were and they still grew up with weres. Normal humans born outside of Moon Lake and with no familial connection to Moon Lake were often slow and hesitant with regard to things that related to Moon Lake&#39;s were population. Those that did turn and turn quickly had often seemed to Aaron to be either werewolf or &quot;furry&quot; fans or they fell in love with a Moon Lake native, and learned from their lover, were or normal. It made his heart flutter as a thought ran through his mind that seemed to say &quot;forever&quot; about her, but for the moment he didn&#39;t think too hard on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re right... my dad didn&#39;t take to things with your Mandatory Were Law well,&quot; Rachel sighed as she began getting dressed, glad to be clean, &quot;which means I have some things to worry on there, just with becoming a were... I wouldn&#39;t want to end up a teen mom, besides.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron nodded as Rachel slowly dressed herself and picked up her items from the floor, which thankfully hadn&#39;t been soiled by anything they&#39;d been doing. Once she was dressed, she picked up her backpack and looked back to Aaron and gave a small smile, which again made his heart flutter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, again,&quot; Rachel answered, &quot;both you and Megumi have been helpful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We always try to be helpful,&quot; Aaron managed, &quot;let me walk you home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel nodded and let Aaron lead the way out. They managed to make their way out without attracting any additional attention, though Rachel thought she could hear Megumi reporting something to someone behind a closed door as they left, but Rachel assumed that was a family matter and thus let that be. With that they made their way out the front door and out of the gate, and into what was clearly nighttime in Moon Lake. The sun was down and there were a few street lights that were on along the main street that ran through the center of Moon Lake&#39;s east-west road, though Rachel also noted there were fewer lights than there were in towns she&#39;d been in Michigan. They provided enough light for people to see, but allowed for enough shadow that someone would have to really be paying attention to note that Aaron wasn&#39;t wearing a costume.<br />
<br />
&quot;This way,&quot; Rachel commented as she walked to the east and then rounded the corner along the outside of the wall that surrounded the Tachibana family&#39;s compound. &quot;So... does most of your family live on your grandmother&#39;s estate here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually no,&quot; Aaron answered, &quot;A few do... but given how big our family is, even with the loss of my grandfather in WW2, we couldn&#39;t all live there today. Most of the family lives in their own homes spread throughout Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it is quite beautiful... like a palace,&quot; Rachel commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... grandma does have familial ties to a noble family in Japan, and given that she&#39;s around two hundred years old... there are times where she can be very traditional,&quot; Aaron explained, &quot;though it does add to her charm. My parents... they were among the youngest of my grandmother&#39;s own children and with the Second World War still fresh in American memory when grandma and her part of her family immigrated to America... as I said, they wanted to give me a more &quot;American&quot; name so that I&#39;d fit in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thus Aaron Tachibana,&quot; Rachel smiled again<br />
<br />
Aaron nodded as they walked along, and he trailed after her a bit, largely because he didn&#39;t know where Rachel lived, but he was also rather alert to some of the nighttime sounds that were beginning to rise through Moon Lake. He could hear what sounded like a large predatory were giving a sort of a growling moan off in the distance behind the house that was just to the north of the Tachibana estate, which could mean it was either a lone were based off a lion, tiger, bear, or leopard/panther either with a partner or pleasing himself/herself. The sound was enough of a reminder that weres were more active at night, thanks to the restrictions regarding their were forms being lessened at night. Though, that also could mean trouble, particularly if someone went looking for went looking for whoever was making the noise.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re neighbors,&quot; Aaron said with some surprise and some cheer as they arrived at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Rachel answered and then thought to herself, &quot;and hopefully dad doesn&#39;t do something stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will I see you at school tomorrow?&quot; Aaron wondered, &quot;or after school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... that depends on what Megumi will give you permission to do,&quot; Rachel teased and mentally noted, &quot;and assuming my dad doesn&#39;t do anything stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... then I suppose I should talk with my cousin,&quot; Aaron answered waved to Rachel as she opened the door and went inside.<br />
<br />
As she went inside, Rachel found the house surprisingly quiet. Not only was it quiet but that the ground floor lights weren&#39;t on, which left things a bit dark as she entered and that surprised her even more. She&#39;d expected that Rob would be home and either finishing his homework or watching television and that her parents would be either in the kitchen or somewhere else in the house, but things were practically silent as she entered. The only thing she did hear was one set of footsteps coming down the stairs, which turned out to be Frank.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re home a bit late,&quot; Frank stated to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry... I&#39;d walked home with a friend,&quot; Rachel answered, &quot;we worked on our homework together...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was Rob with you?&quot; Frank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Rachel answered, &quot;he left the high school before I did... I think... as I said, I was with a friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Melissa?&quot; Frank wondered, remembering the red-haired teen that Rachel often hung out with in Michigan.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I saw Mel... but I was with a new friend... a friend she made here,&quot;  Rachel answered, &quot;her name is Megumi and her family lives in the estate that&#39;s just to the south of our house.&quot;<br />
<br />
She left out getting involved in a bit of active foreplay with Megumi&#39;s cousin, just in case there was any issue of improper actions that Frank might tell their parents on. A part of her wondered on what Frank thought on the Mandatory Were Law. A part of what she&#39;d heard from him the previous afternoon gave a slight indication that he was at least willing to learn about weres, but with her father sounding hostile to it and her mother sounding nervous, she hadn&#39;t been brave enough to ask her older brother. Though, if her parents were out and Rob wasn&#39;t home, she thought there might be a chance to see what her older brother though, especially since he was a big reason why the family had decided to move to Moon Lake rather than just letting him come to the college and picking him up at the end of the school year.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s probably good,&quot; Frank gave a sigh as Rachel flicked on a light in the living room, &quot;given that we&#39;ve had a lively afternoon here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Rachel wondered, a bit fearful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... dad&#39;s been against the whole were thing since we met Mrs. Twist,&quot; Frank said slowly, &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed that much. And their Mandatory Were Law is enough of a surprise that it&#39;s perfectly understandable on dad&#39;s part to be upset. But he and mom did loosely agree to figure some things out first before making any decision regarding staying... becoming weres or anything like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel nodded as they moved around to take seats in the living room. Rachel sat down on the couch that was facing the television while Frank set down on one of the recliners that was facing the front windows. She was very nervous about what might be coming, given the dreams she&#39;d had that had put her against a clock before something happened that would force Moon Lake&#39;s hand in regard to enforcing their Mandatory Were Law. If her dad did have some kind of &quot;escape plan&quot; in place, she could find herself being forced to becoming a werewolf, if her dreams were right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... apparently the limit of dad&#39;s thinking has been more on how to get out of it,&quot; Frank said slowly, &quot;not learning about Moon Lake or its weres... just on how to escape the town. And from what little I could overhear... or what mom told me... the base plan was simply to pack everything we can tonight... clothes, electronics, pictures, books, and so on and then leave first thing tomorrow morning after the sun comes up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s dumb!&quot; Rachel exclaimed and practically jumping up, her mind flashing to Aaron or Megumi, though Frank waived her down for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom didn&#39;t use those words... but I get the sense that she wasn&#39;t too keen on dad&#39;s idea either,&quot; Frank explained, &quot;particularly when dad apparently said he was willing to abandon me if I agreed to be the family&#39;s were... and I think that set mom off a bit... that he would be so closed minded about things. For you know that dad has been openly tolerant and welcoming of many things... at least prior to all that relates to the Mandatory Were Law.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So where are they now?&quot; Rachel asked, &quot;staring at each other?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her feelings were a bit mixed at the moment. It appeared that her father DID have some dumb escape plan in motion, which Rachel was pretty sure wouldn&#39;t work and could lead to what she&#39;d had nightmares about. And while Melissa had told her a bit about prophecy dreams, there were parts of Rachel&#39;s mind that couldn&#39;t be certain if that sort of thing was truly &quot;real&quot; or not. For one could never truly know exactly what would happen, otherwise everyone would with the lotto every time because they&#39;d know the numbers that would come up. She did, however, know that her nightmares certainly felt real to her. And the fact that her mother seemed to be against her father&#39;s escape plan went against the idea that her nightmares foretold the future. That fact gave Rachel some hope that her father&#39;s scheme wouldn&#39;t be implemented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It ultimately exploded into a full on argument,&quot; Frank said slowly, &quot;and mom accused dad of not thinking... and I think she took a shot at his masculinity too... and essentially dared him to walk out into the woods with her and meet a transformed were... And dad took the dare and left just before you got home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound any smarter... I mean if you were with your girlfriend back in Michigan... would you want mom and dad to walk in on you?&quot; Rachel commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not... but then I&#39;d think both mom and dad are under stress,&quot; Frank said slowly, &quot;and hopefully no one gets hurt.&quot;</p>
