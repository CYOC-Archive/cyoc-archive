<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Moving was always a difficult thing and in a time when travel was being restricted due to a global pandemic, it was even tougher. Within the US, some airlines worked, but they were limited and ran into difficulty when it came to fueling and passengers. Not as many people were wanting to travel in an enclosed space the way they did before the pandemic and thus weren&#39;t buying as many airline tickets. And even opening up certain areas of the country hadn&#39;t changed that. And major moves couldn&#39;t really use flying much at all, as things like furniture, clothing, and other personal things would have to be driven across the country, and while Joanne was delighted that her servants had agreed to stay on, covering the move was ultimately higher then expected, particularly as country came to grips with the pandemic and the present protests going on at the same time.<br />
<br />
Of course for some of the children and other family members it was something of an adventure, particularly as Animalia and Lyre were practically a world away and hadn&#39;t had anywhere near the same level of direct hardships that the rest of the country had dealt with. And finding that they were moving from either apartments or small suburban homes to a mansion, or at least &quot;servants quarters&quot; in a mansion seemed attractive. Particularly when it came to the fact that Joanne ultimately came out to offer hugs and to say &quot;thank you&quot; as the moving trucks arrived. Though there were some things that puzzled her...<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Jasper,&quot; Joanne spoke to the man beside her as a pair of moving men carried in a bed-frame and following one of the other staff members.  Jasper stood by calmly and quietly with his graying hair combed neatly as befitting his place at the head of her staff. He&#39;d also taken the lead when it came to saving her life after her having a nervous breakdown over the thought of losing her connection to her daughter, &quot;if you decide to become Animalians... you may need different kinds of beds... I mean the Elephant Animalians aren&#39;t the biggest Animalians overall... that would probably go to the Sauropod Dinotopians down in Dino City... but they would be big enough that most Human sized furniture would be too small...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure, ma&#39;am,&quot; Jasper answered calmly, &quot;though I&#39;m not sure that ALL of the staff would want to convert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They wouldn&#39;t?&quot; Joanne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nothing against Animalians, ma&#39;am,&quot; Jasper said respectfully, &quot;but to my knowledge... most of those that willingly converted to become Animalians were &quot;furries&quot; that already identified more with some anthropomorphic animal than with normal Humans, and thus Animalia was a natural attraction for them... And among those that didn&#39;t fall into that category, most went through things like Project Phoenix and relied on the Animalia Virus&#39;s uncanny ability to heal wounds and damages when a Human becomes an Animalian. Most of the rest either wanted the ability to fly or... reconnect with family, ma&#39;am. Not necessarily something that would apply to all the staff. Some may, I cannot be sure... but I would imagine that most would not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even to regain their youth?&quot; Joanne wondered, &quot;I feel like I&#39;m in my twenties again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasper looked over to the older Fennec Fox. She looked strong and healthy, with much the same build as other Animalian females in general, though a bit more conservatively dressed than some Animalians that he&#39;d seen. The big thing was that she did look younger and more toned, more energetic, and above all, happy. It was a major plus from the memory of her crying in the evenings and often drowning her sorrows in wine. He knew enough that she and her daughter, Nicole, had a long way to go and had some therapy sessions that were designed to help them work through all their differences, but the Fennec Fox Animalian that stood beside him looked much happier and healthier than the Human woman who had tried to slit her wrists with a dinner knife.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;re all happy to see you happy, ma&#39;am,&quot; Jasper answered with a small nod, &quot;and some may look into that eventually for that reason... but you cannot assume that everyone will want to become Animalians just because it gives them their youth back. For many times people may be quite happy with their lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanne bit her lip for a moment and then nodded, &quot;well... if anyone DOES wish to become Animalians...  let them know that I would pay for it. My way of saying thank you... for saving me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve done that and more, ma&#39;am,&quot; Jasper answered politely, &quot;we know and understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
The invitation to stay on had been a total surprise for Jasper and the other members of Joanne&#39;s staff. While there had been the hope that they could stay on with her, much of that idea centered around Joanna becoming an Animalian, getting some cheer back as a result of the transformation and her coming back to New York and her original place of residence. Her decision to move to Animalia to reconnect with her daughter wasn&#39;t necessarily too much of a surprise though, either, for from what Jasper had seen, Joanne had deeply card for her daughter and that the real issue between them was in communication and not in actual love. Thus if the Animalian conversion snapped Joanne out of the depression she&#39;d fallen into, which it did, she would try to make things up with her daughter. <br />
<br />
Though, that then carried the assumption that Joanne would let them go and hire new staff in Lyre/Animalia. After all, while none of them had managed anything more than the shifts needed to keep Joanne&#39;s home clean and the owner and her family fed, they did understand the costs that would relate to Joanne moving her offices , or at least her corporate headquarters to Lyre/Animalia. A lot of the work might still go on in New York, at the center of America&#39;s fashion world, but that wouldn&#39;t relate to Jasper and Joanne&#39;s staff, and with their employer moving from New York to Nevada, it would be costly for them to move, and as such they never expected Joanne to actually offer to pay those costs for them to move and stay on as her staff. It was even more surprising that some extended family that might have lived with some members of the staff were also offered employment and transport to Lyre/Animalia. Jasper gave that a case of proof where one could never write off generosity and assume that just because people were wealthy that they lacked the capacity for that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know...&quot; Joanne replied, &quot;but it still feels like I owe you. I&#39;ll leave you and the others to monitor the moving men... as their work will be setting up for YOUR comfort. When they&#39;ve finished... let me know and I&#39;ll handle the payment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, ma&#39;am,&quot; Jasper answered politely.<br />
<br />
With that Joanne moved off to head inside while Jasper monitored the last loads that were being carried in. Some looked like they were bigger than others, but he supposed some things would be bigger than others. There were some things didn&#39;t come with them and they had to pawn off, largely things like refrigerators, washers, and dryers, and many of those sorts of things. Joanne&#39;s mansion already had those things and when they&#39;d had the tour, they&#39;d found that even the &quot;servants quarters&quot; were attached to the main kitchen area and laundry area which was large enough to handle multiple families on its own. The staff had agreed that this was likely part of what Joanne was offering for them to all move in. The mansion was more than a rich home for one person but almost a large scale apartment complex.<br />
<br />
Jasper then walked in following after the last of the moving men, to keep an eye on things as they were put in place. These things went fairly well, though there was some commotion with some of the rooms on where specific things were to be placed. Eventually one of the maids came out  from a room with the movers nodding to her as they left. They looked to Jasper and raised one hand and rubbed their thumb against their fingers as though they were counting or moving dollar bills. Jasper asked them to wait a moment and then moved to talk with the maid, Margaret.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well everything is placed, John is excited about a place to stay that&#39;s &quot;so big&quot; and Doug is glad nothing was broke,&quot; Margaret spoke referring to her husband and son, &quot;though I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll get used to how cavernous this place is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think there was some expectation that we&#39;d wish to become Animalians as well,&quot; Jasper told her, &quot;and potentially big Animalians, and thus the mansion was built to accommodate that. And Joanne seems more than willing to pay for the conversions if that is desired...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think everyone gathered that with the tour apparently including an area for &quot;nude sunbathing&quot; before going on shift,&quot; Margaret answered, &quot;odd... and very open... but not for me. Not with a ten year old who&#39;s still at the sort of stage where girls are &quot;icky&quot; as he&#39;d put it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll probably change in time,&quot; Jasper chuckled, &quot;but still... Joanne has made the offer and I&#39;d imagine that was part of her thinking in the mansion&#39;s design... That just because we were offered the chance to keep our jobs and that Joanne would pay for our moving here that there would be some interest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe with some... not with me or my family,&quot; Margaret answered firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if others do show interest?&quot; Jasper asked carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would work along side them as though nothing had changed,&quot; Margaret replied, &quot;and I would hope to be treated the same in return.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure that won&#39;t be a problem,&quot; Jasper assured her.</p>
