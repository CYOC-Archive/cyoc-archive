<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Right then, let’s get going” the head attendant announced. Liam continued to sweat profusely as he feared what was in store for him. Parker and Alexa also paid close attention as they wondered what their colleague was planning.<br />
<br />
The man strode over and opened the office door before wedging it open with the door stop. He asked Parker to step through the door first, which he duly did. It was then that he turned his attention to the subservient mare. “Now listen to me Jenny, I want you to wedge yourself in the door frame so that it is impossible for you to free yourself.”<br />
<br />
Alexa and Parker exchanged confused looks across opposite sides of the door, while Liam kept shaking nervously. His cocky facade had been completely obliterated at this point.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jenny did what she was told as the bridle conveyed the man’s orders. As described, she slowly walked over to the open door. She had barely managed to squeeze into the small office in the first place, and not without human help. She was able to fit her front half through the doorframe without needing any assistance. But then the frame found her widest point: her large barrel-shaped belly. She squeezed a few inches of her wide mid-section through the gap before the friction became too much to bear. <br />
<br />
Once in position, Jenny began testing that she was well and truly secured, as dictated by her instructions. She pushed backwards and forwards and wiggled from side to side in a determined effort to break free. She pulled and heaved until it was obvious that her task was complete; now she really was well and truly stuck!<br />
<br />
“Perfect Jenny!” The lead attendant smiled as he approached her backside. “Now Parker I just need you to take the bridle off her and pass it to me. Understood?”<br />
<br />
“Um yes boss,” Parker replied questioningly “if you’re sure.” The young stable worker then did as he was told. He undid the bridle’s various straps before sliding it off the horse’s muzzle. He convinced Jenny to spit out the metal bit which allowed him to fully remove the device. Parker then handed it to his colleague before he stood on his tip-toes, eagerly trying to see what was going on in the other room.<br />
<br />
As for Jenny, the removal of the bridle caused her thoughts to slowly come back to her. She began to sense the outside world again and feel real emotions. Initially she felt relieved to have her senses returned to her, then she felt confusion about why she couldn’t remember the past hour or so, and finally she felt panic as she found herself wedged in her precarious position.<br />
<br />
She pushed and pulled, wiggled and twisted but, just like before, nothing would budge. She looked around in confusion to see the four attendants surrounding her, three of whom were smiling, while the other was visibly shaking.<br />
<br />
“Sorry doc,” the head attendant announced, “you’re not going anywhere until I say so.”<br />
<br />
Jenny stamped her hooves in frustration as it was apparent that she was rooted to the spot.<br />
<br />
“Now then Liam, I think you need to make good on your promise to help me out. Put on the bridle” the man demanded bluntly.<br />
<br />
Liam was slightly taken aback by the question. He didn’t seriously expect the device, which was clearly designed for horses, to work on him, did he? But this thought prompted another; what if it actually did? He couldn’t let himself become enslaved like Jenny had been!<br />
<br />
“NO!” Liam blurted out his answer. “I won’t end up like her” he said as he pointed to the struggling mare.<br />
<br />
“Fair enough” the head attendant replied casually, “upload of those photos shouldn’t take long.” The man then whipped out his phone and began touching the screen. “Let’s see… all selected… upload…confirm…“<br />
<br />
“Wait!” Liam shrieked. “Don’t do it, please! There must be something else I can do for you, anything?!”<br />
<br />
“I’m sure you could Liam, but seeing you in this predicament is far too entertaining.” The attendant smiled, clearly enjoying watching Liam squirm. “So I will ask again; wear the bridle or I upload. Which is it?”<br />
<br />
Liam cursed under his breath. He knew for a fact that his life would be ruined if those pictures got out. He knew he’d end up plastered all over the internet, and would probably wind up in prison or on some weird register. He knew he couldn’t let that happen. And so Liam snatched the bridle from the attendant’s hands, taking the chance that it wouldn’t work on a human.<br />
<br />
Liam fed the metal bit into his mouth before clenching down with his teeth. He gagged slightly as he tasted remnants of Jenny’s warm saliva still coating the metallic surface. Then the head attendant helped to adjust the various straps for a human head. Soon, the device was fitted although it looked ridiculous.<br />
<br />
“Now take note Alexa,” the sadistic man said as he remained focused on their bet, “I only gave Jenny one command from the bridle, as per the rules. Those same rules never said anything about using the bridle on other people. So I think you’ll find that what I’m doing is still legit.”<br />
<br />
Alexa shrugged in indifference. “Sure, whatever” she replied with disinterest in the precise rules of their dumb bet. After all, she had already acquired Jenkins’ expensive locket meaning that winning the bet no longer concerned her. However, she was still very interested to see what fate the man had in mind for Liam.<br />
<br />
“Good, glad that’s settled. Ok Liam, let’s see if this works… transform into a virile stallion!”<br />
<br />
Liam shuddered as a tingling feeling gripped his entire head. He suddenly seemed to lose all trains of thought as he just stood, not in pain but with a strange feeling as if he somehow lacked any emotions.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the other three attendants watched in anticipation, looking for a sign that the command had worked.</p>
