<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two boys were scared stiff. They couldn't even<br />
scream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't even try to open the door,&quot; the doctor man<br />
said. &quot;It has been locked securely; there's no use in<br />
trying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack and John looked at each other. They had tears in their eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me,&quot; the man said, calmly but harshly at<br />
the same time.<br />
<br />
The two boys didn't want to get this guy mad. They had<br />
No choice but to do as they were told.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seeing as you two seem to be so interested in<br />
sneaking around the building, I've decided to give you<br />
a little tour myself. I'm sure that you'll enjoy it,&quot;<br />
the man chuckled as the two friends gulped<br />
simultaneously.  <br />
<br />
The man led the boys down the hallway, and then opened<br />
a door which was not numbered. When the door was fully<br />
opened, the boys found that it was not another white<br />
room, but a stairway.<br />
<br />
The man led Jack and John down the stairs, and when<br />
they reached the bottom they found themselves in yet another enormous hallway. The building had appeared to be relatively small from the outside, but it ended up being a huge maze of hallways and staircases once inside. <br />
<br />
The man stopped at a door labeled “Observation Room.” He took a key out of his pocket, and then proceeded to unlock the door. When he opened it, the boys noticed that there wasn't much inside. The only objects in the room were three chairs facing a window that looked into another room.<br />
<br />
“Sit down, gentlemen,” the man said. “I want you to see this.”<br />
<br />
The boys sat down in two of the chairs, and the man took the seat next to them. The boys noticed what appeared to be a photographer with a camera and a backdrop in the room that the window looked into. There was a stool in front of the backdrop. It reminded the boys of the sets that were used on school picture day. But who would want their school pictures taken in this place?<br />
 <br />
The photographer looked at his watch, and then yelled “I’m ready for the next patient!” <br />
<br />
Nothing happened for a few seconds, but then someone walked into the room. <br />
<br />
“Please take a seat on that stool,” the photographer said.<br />
<br />
A kid in a bathrobe slowly walked toward and sat down on the stool. He looked nervous.<br />
<br />
“What the hell?!” John yelled.<br />
<br />
The kid sitting on the stool was John’s brother, Ben. Ben was 14, one year younger than John. <br />
<br />
“How did Ben get here!?” John cried. He got up out of his chair.<br />
<br />
“He must have followed us,” Jack replied.<br />
<br />
“Ben!” John cried, pressing his hands against. “Ben! It’s me! John!” <br />
<br />
But Ben didn’t seem to notice John.<br />
<br />
“The boy can’t see you,” the man said. “It’s a two-way mirror.”<br />
<br />
“Please don’t hurt my brother,” John said, trembling.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry,” the man replied. “In fact, were going to make him much better.” The man smiled.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” John asked.<br />
<br />
“Just watch and see.”<br />
<br />
The photographer was finished adjusting his camera, and spoke again. “Alright now, let’s see… Ben. What will we do with Ben?” The photographer was looking at a sheet of paper.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes,” the photographer said to himself, smiling. “This will make a great picture. Alright Ben, all I need for you to do is give me a big smile, ok? ”<br />
<br />
Ben was still nervous, but managed to grin slightly.<br />
<br />
“Perfect. Now say cheese!” the photographer said. He was a very eccentric man.<br />
<br />
“Um… cheese.”<br />
<br />
The photographer immediately pressed the button on the camera. There was a flash of light… but this was no ordinary flash of light. It was the brightest flash that John and Jack had ever seen. It was almost blinding.<br />
<br />
John and Jack rubbed their eyes, and then opened them again. Their jaws dropped.<br />
<br />
Ben, the 14-year-old was no longer sitting on the stool. Instead, there was a 21-year-old man seated on it. <br />
<br />
“Very nice!” the photographer exclaimed. “You take a great picture!”<br />
<br />
Jack ran up to the window, next to John. They stared at the young man.<br />
 <br />
“Wh-where, d-did, B-Ben go?” John stuttered. <br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” the doctor replied as if nothing had happened. “He’s sitting on that stool.”<br />
<br />
“But… what happened to him?!” Jack asked.<br />
<br />
“I guess you could say that John’s brother has grown up in a flash!” the doctor laughed. “Oh, I do crack myself up sometimes!”<br />
<br />
The two boys couldn’t see the humor in the man’s joke at all.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the photographer seemed to be examining Ben from all sides.<br />
<br />
“How do you feel Ben?” the photographer asked.<br />
<br />
“Fine,” Ben replied in a deep bass voice that was unrecognizable to John. “Why wouldn’t I be?”<br />
<br />
The photographer was smiling from ear to ear. “Awesome! Now Ben, would you mind standing up? I’d like to get a few more shots of you in different poses.”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t mind at all.” Ben didn’t seem to notice the changes that had occured. It was as if he hadn't changed at all. He stood up.<br />
<br />
“Have you ever posed naked before, Ben?” the photographer asked.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm… I can’t say I remember. Maybe... I think the flash of that camera’s left me a little dizzy.”<br />
<br />
“Well, you’re a fine-looking man Ben. I’m sure you’d make a great nude model-”<br />
<br />
The photographer didn’t have to say anything more. Ben smiled and stripped off his bathrobe, dropping it on the floor.<br />
<br />
It was evident that Ben had not only gained age, but muscle as well. He flexed his arms for the photographer. It was obvious that Ben was proud of his Herculean body. He was wearing a huge hard-on as well.<br />
<br />
“Ya think?” Ben replied, smirking.<br />
<br />
The photographer immediately started taking picture after picture of Ben flexing and posing. When Ben started to grab his hard-on, John had had enough. He walked up to the man in the lab coat.<br />
<br />
“You bring my brother back to the way he was or I’ll-”<br />
<br />
Before John could say anything more, he started shaking…</p>
