<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When they took Matt/Jamie from their camp, they set up camp a few feet away from Jamie&#39;s camp and set you down in their tent after they set the tent up. You moan and wriggle to their touch as you are set down. &quot;Did you hear that Jeff? This one made a noise!&quot; Jeff called out from the tent as Chris readies the fire pit and walks in the tent, &quot;Really?&quot; he then kneels down beside Chris to look at you and Matt and you feel Chris&#39;s hand on your flat body and moan and wriggle. Chris is not surprised, &quot;Oh, it must have came from that human converting spandex factory a few hours away from here. I know, my friend told me that he&#39;s going to become a living spandex sex toy for his girlfriend for her to enjoy. It&#39;s kinda creepy to me but it ain&#39;t bothering me.&quot; Jeff asked, &quot;Why do young people like this kind of thing?&quot; Chris shrugged and said, &quot;Anyways, I got the fire pit set up, let&#39;s get some dinner and go to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
At night, the two of the campers stared at you and Jamie who still said nothing. You fear for the worse that he might be gone. And then you hear a voice in your head, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m still here Matt. And I know what&#39;s going on.&quot; You internally sigh in relief and asked him, &quot;How are we going to turn you back?&quot; as Jamie thinks for an answer, you hear the both of them talking, &quot;Please tell me you brought the sleeping bags. I was going to use this for an extra blanket.&quot; Jeff said. He then rub the back of his head in embarrassment and reply, &quot;Uh.... I forgot them when we got here....&quot; Jeff facepalmed and groaned in embarrassment, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go in that with you man....&quot; Jeff said. It&#39;s your luck and coincidence. You moan and wriggle in a seductive like way as both men looking you blush. An awkward silence excluding your moans filled the tent until Chris broke the silence, &quot;Look, the both of us don&#39;t want to sleep in the tent cold and this sleeping bag is the only option.&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes, but this is made for only one person though. How do you think he&#39;ll fit us?&quot; Jeff asks. Chris then picks you and Jamie up and you moan in pleasure as you stretch and you tell your best friend telepathically, &quot;Don&#39;t moan Jamie, don&#39;t moan in this pleasure... Don&#39;t moan....&quot; you hear his struggle, &quot;I&#39;m trying....&quot; Chris then stops stretching the both of you, &quot;It looks like we can fit.&quot; Jeff tries to make an excuse but, gives up, &quot;Ugh, fine. Just make sure our backs are facing each other so that we don&#39;t... You know...&quot; he then blushes.following Chris. &quot;Y-yeah I know....&quot; Just as they zip down the zipper; before they enter, Chris suggested that they should take off their clothes, &quot;Are fucking kidding me?&quot; Jeff said with a grimace on his face. &quot;Look I don&#39;t like it either but our clothes are too baggy and we don&#39;t want to break it when we return it quickly before he returns from his night time stroll. &quot;How do you know that he&#39;s walking at the middle of the night?&quot; Chris shrugs. Jeff sighed and gave up again, &quot;Fine...&quot; Soon, you feel them stuffing themselves inside the both of you and zip up. &quot;You weren&#39;t kidding that we can fit, but damn, I&#39;m really getting you for this...&quot; Jeff says. &quot;Sorry man, but we don&#39;t have a choice.&quot; You then wait for the to fall asleep and several minutes later, you telepathically say to Jamie, &quot;Do it!&quot; You both massage and moan as you then shrink around them. You and Jamie try and give them an orgasm as best as you can and hope you two this is the way to return Jamie back. After minutes of caressing, they came while they were sleeping. You then hear Jamie&#39;s voice, &quot;Matt, I&#39;m feeling... sleepy... I.... Hope this..... Works....&quot; It also happens to you as you too fell asleep.<br />
<br />
In the next morning, you and Jamie woke up and yawned. Wait... You feel movement from your jaw... You also feel a body behind you and you recognize the shape and form unlike the campers that were in you. &quot;J-Jamie?&quot; you ask in a daze. &quot;Matt? Matt? Is that you?&quot; Jamie then zips down the bag&#39;s zipper and gets out and reaches for a hand to help you up as you get up. Your body still feels tingly from your events as a living spandex sleeping bag. You feel glad that you have your limbs again, your young body, and your dark brown hair as you roam your body and smile at him as he did the same, you both embraced in a hug with your naked bodies and then you hear both muffled groans from the bag. You both look down at the deflated spandex as both wriggled and moaned trying to understand what happened. You then look at each other and Jamie realizes, &quot;Wait, if you&#39;re human then...&quot; You nodded. &quot;Let&#39;s roll them up and find out what we should do. next,&quot; you say as the both of you wear their clothes and Jamie then rolls up the moaning sleeping bag and pack up their stuff and head back to pack up Jamie&#39;s stuff. Along the way, you and Jamie walk slowly as you figure out a plan. Jamie speaks first, &quot;So, do you still want to be my living spandex sleeping bag Matt?&quot; you nodded with a gentle smile on your face, &quot;Yeah, I maybe your friend, but I&#39;m now your property now. And I like how you still treat me like I was still human.&quot; Jamie then asks about the conjoined campers around his left arm still struggling. &quot;What are we going to do with them?&quot; he asks. &quot;I think we&#39;ll head back to the factory and see what they&#39;re going to do with these two. And then, have them turn me back into your living sleeping bag again.&quot; Jamie nods at your simple plan as you finally reach his campsite and pack up and go to the van and place the two camper&#39;s stuff in their car and drive off to the factory.<br />
<br />
At the zentai factory&#39;s hiring station, both you and Jamie with the sleeping bag walked up to the front desk. The same pink zentai being, still there, looked at the both of you as you say, &quot;Yes hi, can I speak to the other zentai being that turned me into a sleeping bag please? It&#39;s kind of urgent.&quot; The zentai made a gesture to the two shiny silver zentai drone and a polka dotted zentai as they walked towards them and showed them the way. When you arrived the room you got turned into a zentai bag, the dull grey zentai that transformed you showed up, &quot;Mr. Matt? How did you change back without the necessary items to reverse the change?&quot; he/it asks. Jamie then shows the zentai bag that is still moaning and wriggling. You then reply to his answer as you tell the story that you turned Jamie into yourself and how he end up fusing with him and taken by two campers and how the turned back and end up here. &quot;I see.&quot; the grey drone crossed his arms on his chest pondering what to do next and think of what to do with the sleeping sack and Jamie. He/it then asks, &quot;We&#39;ll find a way to revert them back to normal despite of them not fully return to normal. But, what about you? Now that you&#39;re back to normal, do you still want to be with your owner as a sleeping bag, or to another furniture or sex toy? Or live your normal life again? Or would you like to be his zentai butler?&quot; Jamie puts a hand on your shoulder and walks up to you, &quot;Do you still want this man?&quot;</p>
