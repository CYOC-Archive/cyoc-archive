<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris scrolled through all the pre-set options for himself, all in relation to his father. Son, daughter, <br />
brother, wife, cousin, best friend, blah blah blah. Then one caught his eye. Chris - Father, Mike - Son. It <br />
sounded like a fun change to him. Now he could be the strong man in charge, bossing around his dad who would <br />
soon be his age. Let's see how he likes being grounded for a month because he was caught using a fake ID to <br />
get vodka! He selected the options, pressed OK and clicked through all the pop-ups, barely reading what they <br />
said because he was too eager for the changes to begin.<br />
<br />
Finally the transformation started as his previously loose shirt was beginning to tighten from him growing <br />
several inches taller. His dad was still in the bathroom, so he stripped out of his clothes, not wanting to <br />
rip them, and ran towards the nearest mirror. The changes were occurring quickly, already looking over 20 <br />
years old. He could definitely pass as a model with his chisled jaw and scratchy stubble. He had a furry <br />
covering of hair over his hardening pecs and developing abs, almost obscuring them entirely. He had definitely <br />
received his father's genes, who had enough hair on his body to knit a sweater. Turning his head, he could <br />
just make out, and feel with his hands, a thin layer of hair on his back. His dick was swelling, reaching it's <br />
8 inch length. Chris smiled with brilliantly white teeth, then thought maybe he should stop this <br />
transformation while he was still this attractive hunk. He scoffed at the idea, knowing he could always make <br />
himself young again if he didn't like being his dad's age. <br />
<br />
There was a brief pause in Chris' changes as he reached that small gap in life where puberty was long finished <br />
and middle age hadn't entered. But that didn't last long, as he noticed the first signs of aging. His hairline <br />
was advancing up his head at an alarming rate. He put a hand to his head, feeling a bald spot at the back. He <br />
frowned, remembering how his dad had lost all his hair over the past 5 years, and it looked like he was <br />
heading down the same route. He might even be bald before the age his dad had started losing his. There goes <br />
his supermodel looks. He tried to ignore his rapidly receding hair and checked out his other changes. His <br />
stubble had lengthened into a short beard, now starting to get grey hairs. It looked like he was started to <br />
put on weight, his stomach looking slightly bulged, but he had so much body hair, it would of been difficult <br />
to see muscle to begin with without trimming it. By now, all that was left on his head was a horseshoe ring of <br />
hair, casually littered with grey hair, increasing in percentage the closer to his temples. His face looked <br />
rough and a bit weathered, crows feet slowly cracking though. His jaw was looking less chisled, a second chin <br />
threatening to appear beneath the salt and pepper facial hair. <br />
<br />
Chris was looking more and more like his father now, hoping the transformation would stop soon. He could hear <br />
that his dad had turned off the shower, and he didn't want him coming downstairs to see him naked. He wondered <br />
how his dad had transformed and if he'd actually noticed. He hadn't warned his dad beforehand, but there <br />
wasn't any shouts of shock from upstairs. Maybe it happened to one person, then the next. It was probably his <br />
imagination, but he was starting to look older than his dad's 38 years of age. He had dark patches under his <br />
eyes, making him look tired. Wrinkles were becoming more plentiful, criss-crossing his face like a map. He was <br />
definitely putting weight on now, his belly looking swollen under it's hairy coating, his once perky pecs now <br />
sagging downwards from gravity. His beard was now mainly grey, as was what was left of the hair on the sides <br />
of his head. His cock was now resting against a pudgy leg, having gone flaccid a couple of minutes ago as <br />
erectile dysfunction kicked in. Chris was worried now. It was obvious he was older than his dad now, closer to <br />
50 than 40. <br />
<br />
This isn't what he wanted. Chris started to panic, not sure what to do. Wrinkles were starting to spread past <br />
his face, as the skin around his neck became flabby, and the skin on his arms became looser. He was starting <br />
to diminish in height, making his weight gain look more extreme. His upper arms and thighs had lost their <br />
definition years ago, now wobbly flaps of fat. His stomach had ballooned, growing outwards and sagging down <br />
several inches, blocking his smaller cock. His belly became a makeshift shelf for his drooping man-boobs. He <br />
slapped a boney hand on the side of it, sadly watching it jiggle about like a water balloon. He couldn't see a <br />
single brown hair on his body, all of it now various shades of grey and white. His face was all rubbery and <br />
spotted with liver spots, especially on his head, looking like prosphetic make-up. Pulling on a chubby cheek, <br />
it stretched out further than he was comfortable with before it softly snapped back with a wobble. His once <br />
shiny teeth were yellow and decaying, before they all suddenly fell out of his mouth, vanishing before they <br />
hit the floor. Chris started to sob, this wasn't what he wanted at all! He wanted to be a hopefully attractive <br />
middle-aged man, but instead he was an ugly, fat old man. <br />
<br />
Chris felt a shiver up his spine, before a flood of new memories entered his mind. While that distracted him, <br />
clothes appeared on his body, a large button-up shirt covered his massive bulk, thick hair sticking out of the <br />
collar and through the gaps between buttons, and a pair of pants were held up by suspenders, his stomach being <br />
too big to see the belt underneath. A dapper looking bow-tie held tight around his neck. A pair of thick-<br />
rimmed glasses helped him to see eaiser, not noticing how bad his eyesight had been getting. His facial hair <br />
was magically trimmed and sculpted into a perfect moustache and goatee combo, thick around the mouth and <br />
unsuccessfully covering the multiple chins he had. The horseshoe fringe of hair around his head had grown a <br />
bit longer, emphasizing his male pattern baldness. A pair of false teeth found their way into his mouth. Chris <br />
was still crying at his reflection in the mirror, the tears soaking his goatee, when Mike came down the <br />
stairs. Concerned, he walked over to the old man and put a long arm over his shoulder, saying &quot;What's the <br />
matter dad? Are you thinking of mom again?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Chris looked up at his dad, now son, and gruffly replied &quot;Oh, yeah...&quot; remembering that his wife had passed <br />
away a few months ago. Mike just nodded and walked into the kitchen to give him some space. After he'd left, <br />
Chris wiped his puffy face with a tissue and tried to push away the happy memories of his wife, reminding <br />
himself they weren't real, and yet the pain he felt was. He waddled over to the Chronivac which was still left <br />
open and tried to find out what happened. He couldn't seem to remember how to work the device at all, grunting <br />
in frustration. God, he needed a smoke from his pipe. But wait, he'd never smoked a day in his life. After <br />
multiple unsuccessful clicks, he eventually found his profile again which now said:<br />
<br />
Name: Chris Sanderson<br />
Age: 65<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Height: 5'9''<br />
Weight 330lbs<br />
Build: Obese<br />
Status: Widowed<br />
Sexual Preference: Straight<br />
Penis size: 4 inches, erectile dysfunction<br />
Occupation: Retired<br />
<br />
This wasn't what he thought would happen when he chose the option! He thought he would be Mike's age and Mike <br />
would get younger to his previous age. Instead, the Chronivac had just increased his age to the point that he <br />
was the father without Mike getting any younger. His youth was long past him now. But it looked like the <br />
Chronivac had also changed reality so he was always this way. The realisation made him gasp, giving him a <br />
rough coughing fit that made his chest ache. Damn it, he should of read those pop ups instead of just clicking <br />
through them! Memories of his previous life were quickly being replaced with his new life as a retired old <br />
man. He tried to remember what happened last year, but his memories of being a teenager were hazy. It was 50 <br />
years ago after all. No wait, it was only a couple of years ago. Come on brain! Chris tried to hold onto those <br />
vague memories, his dad teaching him how to shave, going shopping at the mall with his buds, visiting the <br />
beach with his parents when they were still married, going to concerts to see his favourite bands, learning <br />
how to drive, the time he smoked his first pipe, going on a road trip back in college, meeting his wife after <br />
she got caught in his dog's leash, proposing to her atop the Eiffel Tower, yes it was all coming back to him <br />
now. Chris stared at the screen, not remembering why he was standing in front of it in the first place. He <br />
hoped he wasn't starting to develop Alzheimer's Disease, being the prime age for it to appear. Whatever was on <br />
the device's screen, he didn't understand what any of it meant. It was some sort of fantasy mumbo jumbo he <br />
didn't had time for. Turning away, he could feel a dull ache in his bones, signalling the need for a sit down. <br />
He scratched his goatee and headed to the kitchen where his son was hopefully making breakfast and he'd be <br />
able to finally smoke the pipe tucked away in his breast pocket.</p>
