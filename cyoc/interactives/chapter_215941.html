<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>A few inconsistencies have popped up over the last few chapters so I just want to clarify the state of things in my chapter:  <br/>
Simon: Original Nerd turned into a jock by football team. Tried to turn Jeff into a jock. Simon does not appear in this chapter.  <br/>
Jeff: Simon&#39;s nerd friend. Was turned into a cum-dump. Incorrectly referred to as Simon in the previous chapter. A few chapters ago Jeff was also referred to as a jock, but AFAIK there was no actual written transformation where that happened. <b>For this chapter Jeff has not been turned into a jock.</b>.  </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Firstly, lets enjoy more of your stink Jeffy boy.” Skunky pulls Jeff’s face away from his crotch and with the fresh air Jeff comes back to his senses. The janitor then gets down and lifts up Jeff’s arm, shoving his own scruffy face in to take a deep whiff of his armpit. He stays there inhaling for a few seconds before pulling his face back out.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck!? You don’t stink at all!” Skunky growled dropping the arm and standing back up.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean I don’t stink?” Jeff asks confused “I’m covered in sweaty jockstraps and cum!”<br />
<br />
“Oh you’re definitely <i>covered</i> in stink but you aren’t producing any of your own! There’s no point keeping you like this” Skunky replies and starts pulling jockstraps off you, occasionally taking a huff when he picks up a particularly stained one, “No this won’t do at all. Let’s get these jocks off you and get you in the shower. You’ll soon be back to your normal self.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” Jeff perked up and nearly cried. “Thank you Sir! Thank you!”<br />
<br />
As Jeff was being freed from the pile, a subconscious desire was urging him to grab one of the jocks and take a sniff. But once Jeff was no longer buried, Skunky pulled Jeff’s clothes off and dragged him by the arm to the open showers. Jeff started panicking. A part of him wanted to stay as a cum-dump and was terrified of being cleaned. But he was given no choice as Skunky turned the water to full blast and shoved him under the powerful spray.<br />
<br />
The cold shocked him but immediately he could feel the jock sweat flowing off him, the stench and grime washing away as he became himself again, free from the desires of jock cum. He scrubbed himself hard all over and when he felt completely clean he turned off the water and stepped out feeling refreshed. There weren’t any towels around so he had to cover his little dick with his hands as he walked back to the locker room, only to find Skunky standing there waiting for him and his clothes nowhere in sight.<br />
<br />
“Where are my clothes?” Jeff asked, very embarrassed by his naked state now that the cloud of horniness was gone.<br />
<br />
“Oh you won’t be needing those anymore, not when I’m done with you.” <br />
<br />
“Please No! Just let me go home,” Jeff sniveled, “I’ll give you anything you want!”<br />
<br />
&quot;No no no, I wouldn’t dream of taking away the football team’s cum-dump. It’s good for morale. We’ll just have to make you a stink pig in a different way.” Skunky started running his hands up and down Jeff’s smooth torso, “But we can&#39;t have you dragging around that pile of jockstraps forever, those lads will need them back eventually. And besides you gotta make your own sweaty musk to jerk your little dick off to at home.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jeff tried to back away, Skunky grabs him roughly by the ass cheeks and pulls him closer.<br />
<br />
“Oh you’re not going anywhere little nerd. Now lets see what went wrong the first time.&quot; Skunky starts inspecting Jeff’s body, reaching between the nerd’s scrawny legs pushing and squeezing his little balls. Jeff is too scared to do anything but accept it. Thinking maybe if he obeys, he’ll be let go unscathed. “Fuckin&#39; hell who was the one who tried to turn you into a jock with musk?”<br />
<br />
“My friend Simon” Jeff sniffed.<br />
<br />
“Hmph I guess I can’t really expect a new dumb jock to know better.” Skunky snorted “By the look of you there was no way they can stink you up with that method.”<br />
<br />
“W-what do you mean? Are you going to try to turn me into a jock a different way?” Jeff asks. Though he might’ve been resistant to the idea a few hours ago being a jock was much better than being a cum-dump. In fact part of him was getting aroused at having a big cock and big muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pfft, no point in tryin&#39;. Too much of a baby dick wuss you are. You&#39;re obviously not jock material. Simon at least had the balls to try and stand up for himself.&quot; Skunky turned to a large gym bag on his cart. As he opened the zip Jeff scrunched up his nose at the cocktail of dreadful smells emanating from it. &quot;You&#39;re a nerd all the way through; Couldn&#39;t be a jock if your life depended on it. But lucky for you jocks aren&#39;t the only ones who stink.&quot;<br />
<br />
The janitor crouched down riffled around before pulling something out from the bottom of the bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh here they are, been over 20 years but they&#39;re still ripe.&quot; Skunky turned holding up a pair of large, ripped, yellowing tighty-whities, “Bet you&#39;re wondering where I got these from.”<br />
<br />
Jeff gulped with dread but remained silent.<br />
<br />
“The jocks tried to hoist some dork by his tighty-whities up the flagpole, only he was too fat and the undies ripped clean off before he was two feet off the ground. These days he runs the comic book store off main street.&quot; Skunky walked up to Jeff and dangled the pungent rag in front of him, &quot;Holes himself up and acts like king dweeb in his dinky little nerd shop, because he knows as soon as he steps out into the real world he&#39;s just a baby dick loser. These will be perfect for you nerd.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shakes his head and opens his mouth to protest but Skunky takes the opportunity to grab a cum soaked jockstrap from the nearby pile and shoved it into Jeff’s mouth. He then pushed the nasty nerd briefs into Jeff’s face. “Go on take a huff.”<br />
<br />
Jeff tried to hold his breath but it was in vain. When he finally inhaled the foul odor infiltrated his nose. Not the strong musk of manly sweat and cum, but the smell of a lazy obese slob who didn’t shower.<br />
<br />
He saw his body in the mirror begin to expand, not into big bulging muscles but soft flab. Love handles began forming around his stomach, a second chin protruded from his jaw and he felt a unwashed beard sprout from under his neck. His pubic fat swelled to engulfed his shrinking dicklet.<br />
<br />
With every breath he could feel all his hard earned knowledge draining away. The long nights reviewing science text books were forgotten, and in their place his brain was filled with useless sci-fi trivia. His three years studying french were washed over by random japanese anime quotes. The skills he had learned from the debate team were replaced by a library of colorful insults he had heard from strangers in online video-games. Memories of night time group study sessions instead replaced with &quot;Spells: The Union&quot; tournaments where thousands of unwashed nerds came together to play card games.<br />
<br />
Then he tasted the cum in his mouth. He had forgotten how good it tasted. Why did he ever want to wash this away? Jeff started earnestly sucking every last drop of semen out of the jockstrap. And in doing so he felt his tiny virgin dick getting rock hard buried though it remained. Without thinking he reached down and started to pull on his little stiffy with two fingers. It only took a few tugs before a pathetic nerdgasm dribbled out, and with it any hope of returning to his former self now lost, as he gave himself in to the pleasures of being a stinky jock-sucking nerd.<br />
<br />
“There much better,” Skunky said pulling the briefs away from Jeff’s face. He lifted up Jeff’s saggy moobs and sniffing the undercarriage. He then grabs the garbage picker from his cart and uses it to push against Jeff’s pubic fat and inspect his now even tinier penis. The smell of stale piss, dried cum and smegma emanates out from under his fupa. A smell he will no doubt spend countless nights masturbating over. <br />
<br />
Skunky puts the torn briefs back in the bag and pulls out another pair of tighty-whities and throws them at Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Here these are for you, cover up your disgusting little nerd dick.”<br />
<br />
Jeff doesn’t even wipe the cum clinging to his scraggly pubes and obediently pulls the briefs on and lets them soak into the fibers.<br />
<br />
Skunky pulls out the jockstrap from Jeff’s mouth, now sucked clean of any jock cum.<br />
<br />
“Well then my fat stinky neckbeard...”</p>
