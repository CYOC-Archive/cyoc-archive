<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max walked back toward Neil, still on the phone. “So, uh, Matt is apparently outside, and…” <br />
<br />
“It’s fine. He can come along on the hike—as long as he behaves himself, that is. No selfies with you unless you let him,” Neil responded, smirking. <br />
<br />
Max grinned at that, then resumed his conversation with Clara, beginning with “Neil says Matt can come, if…” <br />
<br />
Neil’s attention drifted as Max continued to talk to Clara, directing her to park along the side of the house where it would be harder for the paparazzi to photograph them all. A house, Neil mused, looking around at the stylish furnishings; it was certainly an upgrade over the dormitory! <br />
<br />
“We’re set,” Max announced, regaining Neil’s attention as he slid his phone into a pocket of his shorts. “Matt’s already in the back of Clara’s car. If we slip out now, we can hopefully get away out the back before those idiots with cameras realize what’s up.” <br />
<br />
“Man, your life just got complicated, didn’t it?” Neil offered, a wry grin on his face. <br />
<br />
“Ugh, don’t remind me,” Max sighed. Then he looked around. “Although the house is pretty nice,” he admitted, smiling slightly. <br />
<br />
“I was thinking the same thing, actually,” Neil laughed, “And your house isn’t just ‘pretty nice,’ it’s absolutely amazing! Honestly, I can’t get over the fact that you have an actual house!”  <br />
<br />
Max smiled as he put on a hat and sunglasses, hiding his suddenly famous visage as best as he could. “Let’s leave my ‘absolutely amazing’ house behind and go on that hike already,” he chuckled, leading Neil out a side door to where Clara was parked, the motor of her older sedan still running. Out of the corner of his eye, Neil saw a single photographer sitting forlornly on a nearby curb, staring at Max’ Lamborghini and completely missing their escape. Despite the newly minted film star’s paranoia, it seemed that photographers were less interested in seeing him at home than at the gym. <br />
<br />
Max quickly settled down in the front passenger seat of Clara’s car while Neil got in back, next to Matt. After heading out through the back gate, they were on the road, headed away from Max’ new house and toward the nearby hills. Max’ mood lifted along with the elevation, the stress of his new fame fading away as the car followed winding roads up into the hills, away from the city below. <br />
<br />
As they drove, Neil couldn’t help but notice the looks that Matt kept giving him; little glances that took in Neil’s magnificent physique, still dressed in workout gear after his session with Brock. Smirking slightly, Neil bounced his big chest when he noticed Matt admiring it, making the other man blush and look away. That amused Neil to no end; Matt’s contradictory behavior was strangely intriguing—earlier that morning the football star had been on his knees, giving Neil an amazing blowjob. Now he turned away red-faced when caught ogling; it was an odd contrast. <br />
<br />
Clara’s sedan crested a hill, then drove down the other side, headed to a large lake that glittered in the afternoon sun. The beauty of the lake and its surroundings relaxed everyone; even Matt managed a smile, his embarrassed blush dissipating. <br />
<br />
The quartet parked in a lot near the lake, then exited the sedan. Max and Neil in particular needed to stretch briefly, their large bodies somewhat cramped in Clara’s car. Feeling the warm sun shining down on them, Neil pulled off his tank top and tossed it into the trunk as Clara retrieved a backpack of water and other supplies. Max followed suit a moment later, stripping off his shirt. “Well, this is getting interesting…” Clara observed, admiring the bare-chested musclemen. She stepped up to Max and ran her fingers over his strong pecs as he grinned down at her and took the backpack off her hands, wordlessly offering to carry it instead. <br />
<br />
Not wanting to be left out, Matt also pulled his shirt off. His athletic physique would have stood out in most groups but compared to Neil and Max he just looked small. Matt was keenly aware of the disparity between them, but stubbornly followed the group as they began to hike in the hills around the lake, staying bare on top just like the other men. <br />
<br />
An hour later, the four hikers found a nice spot under some trees near the lake’s edge. They broke out the water bottles and rested in the cool shade, making light conversation. The longer they rested, the more Max and Clara began to just talk with one another, their voices getting softer, their body language more flirtatious. Then they were gone, having slipped off to some place more private.<br />
<br />
“Just us now,” Neil observed. Matt looked around in confusion for a moment, then realized that Max and Clara were nowhere to be seen. Matt’s face reddened. He was alone with Neil Booth: the man whose dick he’d sucked that morning. And the other night. Part of Matt’s mind rebelled; surely it was his dick that should be getting sucked, not the other way around, right? Yet another part of him not only remembered those times with Neil, it remembered them fondly, even eagerly. <br />
<br />
Neil stood, then stripped off his shorts and underwear, which went into a neat pile atop his shoes. “That lake looks refreshing,” he commented before striding toward it, his big cock and balls swaying back and forth, pushed out by his huge thighs. Matt watched him go, noting Neil’s impressively thick back and dramatically tapered lats. Moments later the big bodybuilder was in the water, submersing himself in it before coming up again. The afternoon sunlight glinted off of his wet muscles, highlighting his amazing development. Matt yearned to join him, yet he hesitated. <br />
<br />
Not far away, Clara leaned back against a smooth stone, stripped down to her bra and panties. “Let’s get you out of your ‘incognito’ gear,” she purred, gently removing Max’ hat and sunglasses as he put his hands on her trim waist. <br />
<br />
Max pushed up against Clara. “What can I say?” he chuckled, “I can’t say no to a romp with you. Especially out here.” <br />
<br />
“Not worried about getting sighted?” she asked, running her hands up and down his powerful arms. <br />
<br />
“Not at all. Not when I’m going to be having sex with the woman that I’m passionate about!” Max leaned in and kissed her. “And isn’t that…” <br />
<br />
“…what’s most important?” Clara finished. Her hands drifted to his thickly muscled chest, noting that fame had led to some grooming changes, like body hair removal. The smooth look showed off his muscles perfectly and as her fingers drifted over his skin, she could feel herself becoming wet. “You’re so smooth, babe,” she whispered. <br />
<br />
“Gotta be. For the cameras,” he purred back. It was strange, having this new life, overlaid over his old one. Both seemed to live in his head: Max Walmann the geeky college student and Max Walmann the muscled actor. As unsettling as such duality could be, Max was adamant that he would live the best life that he could.<br />
<br />
And as far as Max was concerned, his best life included sex with his girlfriend. Max slowly pulled her panties down, then tugged his own underwear off as well. He straightened and kissed her passionately, his smooth, muscled ass on display as they began their sensual lakeside dance. <br />
<br />
It was a nearby moan of feminine pleasure that pushed Matt to strip off his own clothes and head for the lake as well; apparently Clara and Max hadn’t moved that far away before getting busy with one another. Neil smiled and waved him over, moving to meet him at the shore. “Water’s nice?” Matt asked, just as he was about to put a foot in. <br />
<br />
“Frigid as hell!” Neil laughed in reply. Matt hesitated, only to have a pair of huge, wet arms surround him and lift him up into the air. Before he could gasp out a protest Neil had taken several steps into deeper water and took them both under. <br />
<br />
The chilly water was a shock to Matt and he finally managed to find his voice as Neil released him. “What the hell, man!” Matt complained as he staggered upright, his motions jerky. <br />
<br />
“Oh come on, the water’s fine,” Neil teased back. He opened his arms wide, inviting Matt in. “Come on, I’ll warm you up.” <br />
<br />
Matt crossed his arms over his chest, stubborn. But then he began to shiver. Half reluctantly, half eagerly, he moved toward the larger man, letting him wrap those huge, hard arms around him. Neil was warm, his big body seeming to put off its own heat. Matt melted into it, the tension slipping out of him, even though his legs were still partially immersed in the cold lake. Neil pondered the contradictions in Matt’s behavior; one moment the smaller jock was throwing himself at the huge musclegeek, the next moment he was blushing and retreating when caught looking. It seemed that Matt needed a little push to help him feel more comfortable in his new skin. <br />
<br />
Neil’s arms tightened and Matt let out a soft moan, sensing the strength that the other man possessed. For a long moment they remained like that, just feeling each other’s presence. Then their embrace added a kiss, Matt’s head tilting back so the taller man could properly access his lips. Neil’s tongue made the next move, invading Matt’s mouth slowly but implacably, wrestling with what it found there. Neil’s big arms relaxed, still surrounding Matt but becoming more focused on reaching down and around so he could grope the jock’s enticing ass. Feeling Neil’s prodigious member harden against his stomach, Matt could resist no longer. “Oh fuck, Neil, I need you!” he blurted out, “I need you to fuck me!” <br />
<br />
The big man was more than ready. He lifted Matt up, his powerful arms bulging spectacularly as he positioned the smaller jock over his erect cock. Matt let out a howl as it entered him, the pain of penetration mingling with the excitement he felt from having sex with a gorgeous, manly specimen like Neil Booth. <br />
<br />
For his part Neil was patient, holding Matt in place and kissing him tenderly while he waited for the smaller man’s ass to loosen up a little. When it finally did he let Matt slowly slide down onto his shaft, until all ten inches were inside the horny jock. “Oh fuckkk…” Matt moaned, running his hands over Neil’s powerful shoulders. Matt’s mind was abuzz with pleasure and he let out cries of carnal joy as Neil slowly began to pump his oversized cock, thrusting up into Matt with slow, powerful strokes. “More!” Matt panted, “Fuck, Neil, more!” <br />
<br />
Chuckling, Neil complied with Matt’s demand, his hips moving faster and more forcefully, causing Matt’s speech to degrade into incoherent ramblings of ecstasy. But the two men were changing as well. Neil was growing larger and more masculine, his pecs in particular surging with added size and heft. Matt gasped out loud as Neil grew inside him, his already oversized dick adding another half inch of length, with girth to match. But there was another change: Neil’s features shifted slightly, his Korean heritage increasing as his subconscious recalled his experiment from the morning, making him fully half-Korean. <br />
<br />
Matt was changing as well, but in a different direction. He was becoming smaller, his athletic body shrinking in muscle mass and overall size. He was still fit, but no longer had a body trained for sports, but rather one that was built to look good. His glutes in particular were standouts, retaining all of their mass and seeming bigger and rounder in comparison to the rest of him. The largest change was in his face, which became less masculine but also more attractive at the same time: he looked younger and cuter than ever. <br />
<br />
The sensations that coursed through Matt were too much to bear, and he cried out as he came, spewing his seed over Neil’s cobblestone abs. The big man lasted a few minutes longer, but then he too orgasmed, his mighty rod pumping a hefty load into Matt. Neil held the smaller man close, noting the extent to which Matt had changed since, well, since everything changed.  <br />
<br />
Neil pulled out of Matt and set the smaller man down. When Matt’s knees began to buckle, Neil picked him up again, cradling him in his arms as he carried the smaller man out of the lake and back to the shady spot under the trees, where Max and Clara were waiting, snuggled together. They both blushed as Neil arrived, clearly having seen some of the show that the two men had put on. Even though he’d just fucked Clara, Max was getting hard again, turned on by the sight of his hulking roommate pounding Matt’s ass. Clara stared at Matt, weirdly fascinated by just how pretty the man suddenly was. <br />
<br />
“We’re going to sun ourselves on that rock over there and dry off,” Neil explained, before heading toward the slab of stone that jutted out from the hillside. He carried Matt up there and laid him out, then lay next to him, closing his eyes and feeling the sun’s rays soak into his wet skin. Neil felt oddly protective of Matt; it was difficult to explain why, given past torments. But this Matt was different—smaller, cuter, and utterly changed in terms of personality. And after seeing Matt change in the water, Neil knew that at least some of it, somehow, was his fault. <br />
<br />
Max and Clara joined them on the large rock, interrupting Neil’s ruminations. “So, uh, we may have seen some of what you guys were…” Max began, only to be cut off. <br />
<br />
“The same thing we heard you and Clara doing in the bushes,” Neil shot back, grinning impishly. <br />
<br />
“Guilty,” Max laughed, sitting down beside his naked roommate. He blinked a few times. “Um, Neil?” he said, sounding tentative, “You look a bit different than you did before. You know, kind of like how this morning, you came out looking a little different. But it’s more now. Like, half-Asian or something.” <br />
<br />
That surprised Neil. He hadn’t actively been thinking about Korean bodybuilders while in the lake—he’d only thought about fucking Matt. On reflection, perhaps that was the problem: the last time he’d been with Matt, he’d been concentrating on his experiment. He’d have to be more careful in the future, either by thinking differently or just fucking people who weren’t Matt. At least, he assumed both of those options would work. But, he realized, he wasn’t actually sure. And it would be a shame never to fuck Matt’s perfect ass again. The thought of those round little globes of gluteal muscle made his soft cock begin to stiffen. <br />
<br />
Next to him, Max stared as Neil’s dick began to stir. He felt like pinching himself; the realization that his ordinary, geeky roommate had become a towering stud felt like a crazy dream, sometimes, eclipsed only by his wonder at his own changes. Yet as he watched Neil’s shaft harden, he couldn’t help but wonder what it would be like to have sex with the big man. His gaze flitted away from Neil’s growing erection, only to meet Neil’s eyes directly. The two musclemen stared for a moment, the lust building between them the longer they shared that long look.</p>
