<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Azrael, the anthro sentient-lizard, “awakens” by powering up his systems, he is unaware of what had happened in the next room. The lizard-bot looks around the room, Dennis’s bedroom, noticing that both Dennis and Jeff are still asleep, and with nothing else to do, Azrael decides to take a walk and start to explore the world he had been pulled into to.<br />
<br />
The lizard-bot quietly, to not wake anyone, slips out of the room after putting on the clothes Dennis had lent him and heads out the front door.<br />
<br />
Azrael walks along a path, absentmindedly rubbing one of his arms, “I still can’t believe that my whole life was nothing but some human’s imagination,” he mumbles to himself, “everything I remember, all those memories, none of them are real. And now I’m here, in the real world, I have a real life now, and that is all thanks to Jeff by extracting me from that comic, freeing me from that false life, I owe him so much”.<br />
<br />
As he walks, Azrael looks down at one of his hands, a smile appearing on his face, “I really love my new appearance,” he says, “with the body Jeff gave me, I feel less like a machine and more like a real lizard-boy”.<br />
<br />
“Whoa! What a cool costume,” Azrael suddenly hears someone call out from behind him, turning around he notices what appears to be a 6-year-old boy with short blond hair, blue eyes, a slim figure and a light brown skin tone. The 6-year-old’s eyes are wide, staring in awe at Azrael, “I never seen such a realistic costume before! It must have been super expensive,” the boy says, his voice filled with amazement.<br />
<br />
Azrael tilts his head, “who are you, and what are you doing on Dennis’s farm,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Oh, my name is Ty,” the boy says, “I’m a neighbor of Dennis. I just love the animals here on the farm, and the family doesn’t mind me wandering around, as long I don’t do anything stupid”.<br />
<br />
“I see,” Azrael replies.<br />
<br />
“So, who are you and where have you gotten that awesome costume,” Ty asks.<br />
<br />
“My name is Azrael,” he says, then chuckles, “and I am not wearing a costume”.<br />
<br />
“What a cool name,” Ty says, his eyes then widen, “y-you mean… you really are a lizard? Why can you walk and talk like a human?”<br />
<br />
Azrael can’t help but chuckle at the 6-year-old’s wonder, “I am what you call an anthro, a animal that is able to walk and talk like a human,” he says, “but I am not a “real” lizard, I am a robot”.<br />
<br />
Ty’s eyes, if possible, widen more, “a r-robot? B-but… but you seem to be able to… um… think for yourself! I don’t know much about robots, all I know is that they are programmed to do tasks”.<br />
<br />
Azrael nods, “most robots are like that,” he says, “but I am what you call a sentient, I have the mind of a person, but below my… um… “skin”… everything is made of metal, cables, circuits”.<br />
<br />
“So cool,” Ty says, “who… who made built you? If you don’t mind me asking”.<br />
<br />
Azrael hesitates, unsure of how to answer, “I was made by Jeff Davis,” he then says, deciding to just go along with the new reality he now lives in.<br />
<br />
Ty tilts his head, “Jeff? Who’s that?”<br />
<br />
“A friend of Dennis,” the lizard-bot says.<br />
<br />
“Never heard of him”.<br />
<br />
Azrael nods, “Dennis and Jeff met a day ago”.<br />
<br />
“I see,” Ty says, “soooo, Jeff is your owner?”<br />
<br />
Azrael chuckles, “well, he did build me, but instead of seeing me as “property”, he sees me as a friend,” he says, “he allows me to do whatever I want, you know, like a real person”.<br />
<br />
Ty smiles, “this Jeff guy sounds like a cool dude,” he says.<br />
<br />
“He is,” Azrael says.<br />
<br />
There is a long silence, with Ty just staring at the lizard-bot, “can… can I touch you,” he then suddenly asks.<br />
<br />
Azrael is taken by surprise, but then he smiles, “sure,” he says.<br />
<br />
Ty cautiously walks up to Azrael, reaching out a shaky hand and touches the lizard-bot’s arm, slowly stroking it with his fingers. “Whoa, so soft,” he says, looking up at the lizard-bot, “feels like real scales and skin”.<br />
<br />
Azrael chuckles, “well, silicone is a soft material,” he says, “it has a skin-like feel to it”.<br />
<br />
“Cool,” Ty says, “are… are you able to feel me touching you?”<br />
<br />
Azrael nods, “yes, I am able to feel you touching me,” he says, smiling, “it feels nice”.<br />
<br />
Ty smiles back, “so cool,” he says, his eyes moving to Azrael’s tail, “your tail looks so powerful! I bet you could do some damage with it, if you wanted to. Are you able to wrap it around things?”<br />
Azrael chuckles, “you sure are one curious boy,” he says, letting out a little laugh when Ty blushes, “don’t worry, I don’t mind. Yes, I am able to wrap my tail around things,” he then grins, “like cute little boys such as you,” he adds before his tail wraps itself around Ty’s waist.<br />
<br />
Ty lets out a surprised squeak when the tail wraps around him, but then he giggles, “on noooo! The big bad lizard has got me!”<br />
<br />
Azrael laughs, unwrapping his tail from the boy, “you’re so cute, Ty,” he says.<br />
<br />
Ty blushes, rubbing the back of his head as he grins, “hehe… I guess I am,” he says.<br />
<br />
Azrael smiles at the boy, he then tilts his head when he notices something in Ty’s eyes, “what’s wrong, you kinda look sad”.<br />
<br />
“Hm? Oh… I’m not sad,” Ty says, “I’m just kinda… well… it’s hard to explain”.<br />
<br />
Azrael lies a hand on Ty’s shoulder, smiling at him, “try explaining what is on your mind,” he says, “maybe I can help you?”<br />
<br />
Ty chuckles, “I doubt it,” he says, “I guess I’m just curious, I’d like to know what it’s like being a robot. Imagining myself being a robot, being stronger and faster than other kids, that would be exciting!”<br />
<br />
Azrael tilts his head, “well… being a robot has its ups and downs,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Like what,” Ty asks.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Azrael says, “the good side of being a robot is that I don’t age, I am stronger and faster than a normal person, I am unable to die, unless someone would erase my “mind”, or somehow manage to damage me, or take me apart and I’m smarter than a normal person”.<br />
<br />
“What are the not so good things of being a robot?”<br />
<br />
“Well, we can be infested by malicious programming, which can cause us to become violent, misunderstand commands,” Azrael says, “to prevent such a thing from happening, I regularly need to run diagnostics, which is pretty straining”.<br />
<br />
“I see,” Ty says, “still… it would be so exciting if I were a robot”.<br />
<br />
“Well, it depends on what kind of robot you’d want to be,” Azrael says, “would you want to be a sentient like me, or just a regular robot who follows whatever program is installed?”<br />
<br />
Ty tilts his head, “I… I honestly dunno,” he says, “I’d be happy to be able to think and decide for myself, but I also think I’d be happy following a program. Both sound exciting!”<br />
<br />
Azrael chuckles, “I see, what about being something else?”<br />
<br />
Ty tilts his head, “like what?”<br />
<br />
“Well, what about a vehicle, like a car, or an aircraft like a drone,” Azrael asks, “but you could also be an animal, like a dog, horse or dragon. There are so many machines you could be”.<br />
<br />
Ty’s eyes widen, “whoa,” he says, “could I also be a robot that is able to change its appearance?”<br />
<br />
Azrael nods, “that’s also a possibility,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Whoa,” the 6-year-old says, his excitement building, “that would be amazing! But,” his expression saddens, “I’ll never become either one of those things! There is no way a human like me can become a machine… a robot!”<br />
<br />
Azrael looks at the boy, ‘he looks so sad, I want to see him happy,’ the lizard-bot then says, “well… there is a way”.<br />
<br />
Ty’s head snaps up to look at the lizard-bot, “wh-what?”<br />
<br />
Azrael smiles, “there is a way for you to become a machine or robot,” he says.<br />
<br />
“How!”<br />
<br />
“I have the ability to make you into anything you want to be,” Azrael says, “you want to be a sentient, like me: done! You want to be an animal-bot: done! You want to be a aircraft or vehicle: done! You want to be a robot, which follows a program: done! You want to be a robot that is able to change its appearance: done!”<br />
<br />
Ty’s eyes widen, “y-you really are able to do that?”<br />
<br />
Azrael nods, “yes, but you need to be absolutely sure you want it,” he says, “because, once I convert you into the thing you choose, there is no going back!”<br />
<br />
“What… what about my family, friends… people that know me?”<br />
<br />
“Depending on what you choose, the reality will alter to make everyone believe you have always been a robot, aircraft, animal-bot, vehicle or some other machine,” Azrael says.<br />
<br />
Ty’s eyes widen, “w-wow,” he whispers.<br />
<br />
By the look on the 6-year-old’s face, Azrael can tell that Ty is thinking about it, “so, Ty,” Azrael asks, smiling, “what is it you want to be?”</p>
