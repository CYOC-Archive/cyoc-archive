<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they reached his door, Daniel had never been so nervous. He heard the keys shaking in his hand as he <br />
struggled to thread one into the doorknob. &quot;Do I make you nervous? Relax sweetie.&quot; Keri, gorgeous, fit, blond <br />
pom pom girl Keri had her arm around him as he finally got the door open.<br />
<br />
As she followed him inside, he could hardly believe this was happening. Daniel was a man of science. Had that <br />
old man in the woods really been telling the truth? Steve teleporting was seared into his memory, as was <br />
Brad's smokey vampiric demise. Keri cringed a little as he thought of it, her telepathy giving her a window <br />
into his every thought. <br />
<br />
And his power, to make women want him. Seemed to be working on Keri, and she didn't even care. She reached <br />
around his waist from behind, &quot;should I care why the sun rises or sets? It simply is.&quot; She whispered in a <br />
raspy voice, &quot;I want you Daniel, and I generally get what I want.&quot; Her hand slipped down and stroked his still <br />
hard cock. &quot;Now, did you want to head to the bedroom, or should I pick up right here?&quot; <br />
<br />
Her touch distracted him for a moment, until he led her off towards his room, thankful his college roommate <br />
didn't appear to be home. He had hardly sat himself down on the bed when the lights went out, and she gently <br />
shoved him over.<br />
<br />
A moment later she was straddled him, unbuttoning his pants. He'd never been this close to Keri before, or any <br />
beautiful woman for that matter. Somehow looking up at her in the dim light, she looked even more sexy, her <br />
tits appearing even bigger than their normally ample size. &quot;Sweetie, if you keep thinking about me that way, <br />
you're going to make me all wet, and I promised you something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
She peeled his underwear back and he felt her fingers slip against his bare skin for the first time. He mind <br />
was consumed with the slow rubbing and teasing. 'Yeah, get hard for me.' He had tilted his head back, enjoying <br />
the sensations. 'Yeah, that's nice, relax.' She rubbed her fingers around the head a little, then a little <br />
more, until she could see him react. 'There we go. I know you liked that.' <br />
<br />
She took a few longer strokes before rubbing the tip. 'Damn. Now I'm getting totally wet. Maybe I shouldn't <br />
have promised him a great hand job.' Daniel noticed her candid thought, and realized she hadn't intended him <br />
to hear it. Then he heard her laugh at herself, 'Hah, when I'm done with him he'll be begging for me every <br />
night.' He felt her body shift, her motions momentarily awkward, then she slid down his legs, before he felt <br />
cool soft skin press against his lap.<br />
<br />
'Let's see how you like this.' He wasn't sure what he was feeling, then he was. It was the amazing and <br />
unmistakable feeling of her gorgeous firm breasts rubbing back and forth across his lap. She pressed his shirt <br />
upward. By the time she coaxed it off, he felt self-conscious, never having been very comfortable with the <br />
extra body fat he couldn't get rid of. He looked at her topless, and felt he couldn't compare to her perfect <br />
firm body. <br />
<br />
'Don't compare, baby, just enjoy.' She leaned in, grinding into his erection even as she rubbed her breasts <br />
against his chest. The feeling of her body was all he could think about. He let his hands be bold for the <br />
first time, feeling her tight thighs and butt through her jeans, and letting his hands wrest on her waist. <br />
'You like that. It's all for you.' He could feel her tense up her abs as he rubbed his thumb against her. <br />
<br />
She sat up, &quot;I don't think I've ever felt so beautiful.&quot; Which seemed to perfectly fit his thought. He'd never <br />
seen anyone so beautiful. In the dim light, the contour of her firm tits and tight tummy were stunning. <br />
Unrivaled. Something animal and primal inside him wanted to touch them, to taste them. &quot;Oh you do, do you?&quot; <br />
She grabbed his hands, forcing them above his head as she leaned forward, dangling her tits inches from him. <br />
<br />
Keri was so sexy he hardly knew how to respond. He enjoyed staring at the gorgeous shape of her, until she <br />
leaned in, letting him put his lips against her bare breast. It was somehow soft and supple yet firm and <br />
tight. He stabbed his tongue at her awkwardly. 'no not like that.' Somehow her suggestion guided him, until he <br />
was dancing his tongue at her nipple, raking his teeth against it sparingly. 'damn. getting wet again.'<br />
<br />
She abruptly sat up, shifting until she was lying next to him. Her hand again finding his erection. He felt <br />
her body pressing into him, her tits compressed against his skin, as she resumed her stroking motions. Then <br />
her lips came closer, then closer, until they connected. It was awkward at first, til again, he felt her <br />
suggestion in his head. 'no no. like this. yes.' In moments, she somehow had him dancing his tongue into her <br />
mouth dexterously. The pacing of her hand slowly but steadily increased. 'i can feel it. you're going to come <br />
for me now. here it comes.' Her strokes steadily increased. More and more, until finally he felt the final <br />
build of his climax. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh!&quot; she screamed out as he climaxed, slowing her motions as he sprayed messy cum onto himself. When he <br />
finally opened his eyes again, she was staring down at him. &quot;Wow, that was different. I think I know what it <br />
feels like to come as a guy now.&quot; She paused. &quot;I guess dealing with the periods is worth it after all.&quot; She <br />
snickered at her own joke before Daniel connected it's meaning. <br />
<br />
A moment later she was up and slipping her bra and top back on. &quot;Oh, don't get up. I have to head home. My <br />
roommate expects me, and well, I have to get back. I'll be here at 8am sharp. I'm totally into you, but if <br />
we're going to roam campus, you're going to need a little image makeover.&quot; <br />
<br />
After all the jokes Daniel had heard about girls lingering around and wanting to cuddle, he had expected the <br />
evening to end differently than Keri smiling and waving as she ran out the door with him still messy on <br />
himself. Not that he had any complaints.</p>
