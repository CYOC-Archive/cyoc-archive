<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the discharge procedure was completed, we all went in towards the car. As I was in Melody&#39;s body, I was carried by Melody, who is now my big brother. It really makes me feel too sad to think that I would have to live the rest of my life like my 4-year-old little baby sister. As we reached the car I was placed inside the booster seat.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s too tight&quot; I said grumpily in my little girl&#39;s voice, which seemed more like me pouting.<br />
In response to it, my mother said &quot;I&#39;m sorry sweety,&quot; while patting my forehead she said, &quot;that&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to be. Child safety laws and all that.&quot; As we all sat down only Melody and Amelia were smiling. Melody was happy because she got to be a big boy now and as for Amelia she was happy because she can now boss me around which she wasn&#39;t able to before as she always disliked my habits of being a neet.<br />
I bet she must be planning on making me wear all sorts of ridiculously girlish clothes, from which I was saved by Cassi as we both would be staying in the same room like always. I feel really grateful towards her since she understands me the best as we are twin, or should I say were! As a little girl, I wasn&#39;t able to properly control my emotions and started crying, then Cassi holder my tiny hands and assuredly said &quot;It&#39;s fine you don&#39;t need to worry, You will always be my twin brother in my heart and our relation would never change even if your body changes, it is still you inside David. So don&#39;t cry.&quot; As if her words had a mystical power I started to feel a bit relaxed as I dozed off in the booster seat while crying.<br />
I woke up as I heard the voice of my mother saying &quot;wake up David&quot;, I asked &quot;Have we reached home&quot; still a bit sleepily.<br />
Before my Mother could answer I heard Amelia say &quot;Yes little Melody, we have reached home, you must still be sleepy since I heard little girls need more than grownups like me &#39;your big sister&#39;&quot;.  She emphasized the word little and even tried to indirectly show her now superior status.<br />
I retorted back saying &quot;At least I was willing to change my life, so our parents won&#39;t have to work tirelessly like before, not like some little bitch who only thought about herself and wouldn&#39;t care about others&#39; emotions!&quot; Amelia&#39;s face grew red when she heard my retort and said with a grinning smile &quot;I wonder who is the little bitch now&quot;.<br />
As I heard her speak I realized I was really a little girl, I grew embarrassed at the thought of living as a girl for the rest of my life, due to which my face turned a little red. I was again beginning to cry &quot;Uuuhh....&quot;. As my mother and Cassi heard me cry they told Amelia to stop harassing me. &quot; Young lady, you are a big girl and you still try to bully your little sister, if I ever see you do this again then I will deduct 80% of your pocket and use it to buy clothes for your little sister and you would also be grounded for a whole week&quot;. My Mother scolded Amelia, though I felt good that she scolded Amelia, I felt sad as I heard her call me Melody.<br />
&quot; Come on let&#39;s get inside so we can discuss how we will handle things from now on regarding you both&quot; She said to Melody and me as she carried me inside the house. I said to my mom &quot; I can walk on my own&quot; as I said that she didn&#39;t stop and said to me calmly &quot;sweety, it&#39;s faster this way&quot;. I couldn&#39;t retort about that after all now I could barely see my mother&#39;s thighs from my eye view.<br />
When we reached home we all sat down at the dining table. As my Mom placed me on the seat where Melody used to seat. My parents turned serious as everyone went silent. My Father said &quot;David, first of all, let me thank you for what you did for us&quot; He said as he looked towards my side, &quot;but you must also know that we cant disclose information about your body wap, so from now on you would have to live as your little sister Melody and as vice versa Melody will have to live as you&quot; He continued saying this. As I heard this I felt sad, but words didn&#39;t come out of my mouth as it was what I decided to do voluntarily. I could only say &quot;Okay&quot; in a very low tone but opposite me, melody(now my big brother) happily said &quot;Okie Dokie mommy, daddy&quot;. <br />
&quot;Well then let&#39;s talk about something related to your body swap, as both of you might have noticed it already, Melody now has the proper mentality of a grownup and in contrast to it now David has the mentality of a little girl, according to there bodies.&quot; My Mother said while giving me a little hug. she continued saying &quot; As we discussed before Cassi and Davi... I mean Melody will now share a room together and Melod... I mean David will have his own room, but let me remind you both will have to start living as each other starting this moment&quot;<br />
As the talk was coming to an end I felt a sudden urge to go to the bathroom, I then remembered that I would have to pee like a little girl, which made me feel embarrassed, so I tried to suppress my urge as I thought about asking Cassi to help me in this predicament which I wouldn&#39;t have to face if I was still a boy. But as I tried to restain it actually went out like a fountain as it dirtied the underwear I was wearing Uuhhh....., due to which my family noticed this and My mom sternly said: &quot;Young lady, you need to let a grownup know when you have to go to pee, as you behaved misbehaving of a good girl, I don&#39;t have a choice but to punish you.&quot; I heard her continue in a little playful and serious tone which made me sort of feel scared, which I shouldn&#39;t have felt before. &quot;from now on you will call me and your father as &#39;mommy&#39; & &#39;daddy&#39;, do you understand?&quot; she asked to which I sheepishly nodded while feeling a bit scared, I don&#39;t know why but it seems my instincts were also the same as melody&#39;s now. <br />
My Mom then took me to what seemed like my old room, which now seemed pretty big in comparison to when I was David. My Mom and I went inside the bathroom as she asked me to undress while saying &quot;David, I know its difficult for you to accept that now you are a little girl, but as Melody you need to start to rely on others, which you didn&#39;t do when you were David. You must remember that mommy and daddy will always care for you, even if you are now our little daughter. So don&#39;t feel ashamed about sharing anything from us or your siblings as Melody had still needed &#39;Potty training&#39;, so do you. Now let&#39;s get you undressed and ready to take a nice bath&quot;. As she said this I was feeling shameful to see my little sister take a bath, though it was all in my head as it felt instinctual to take a bath as Melody, maybe due to her motor skills still remaining in her body.<br />
My Mom undressed me while also tying my hairs while educating me and saying that &quot; Us girls need to take care of our hair when we take a bath as it can become like a melted rubber which is very sticky and smells very bad&quot; she said while making a &#39;yuck&#39; expression.  When we went inside the bathroom she first washed my body while telling me the benefits of bathing, then she started to shampoo my hair, and after washing it, She also conditioned it with a cherry-flavored conditioner which left the fragrance of cherry in my hairs. Then she put me inside the bathtub that was filled with hot water mixed within were some herbal fragrant essential oil, which made me smell of flowers as I came back after taking a bath, which surprisingly felt very refreshing and good. When I came back, I saw my father replacing my old stuff with Melody&#39;s stuff, which made me feel really sad, but when I saw him take my Gameboy I couldn&#39;t hold back and say &quot;daddy, please don&#39;t take my Gameboy with you, I really like it&quot;.  Dad was a bit taken aback when he heard me say him daddy but he still looked at me sternly and said &quot;It&#39;s not that I can&#39;t let you have it but you will have to promise me that you won&#39;t play any games that are for kids more than 5 years old if you can than I will give it back to you tomorrow!&quot; To which I readily agreed as it was a memento of me and my friends. &quot; I agree daddy&quot;.<br />
When Dad left the room my mom placed me on the bed while helping me dress a pink-colored comfy top which had a mini mouse printed on it, after that she took out what seemed like white training pants which were in truth a diaper, to my despair she made me wear the diaper saying something &quot; Melody, you must understand that you don&#39;t understand a female body properly yet, and do you think you would be able to control the urge to pee when you are sleeping?, so please do as I say my dear&quot;.<br />
I sort of felt kindness in my mother&#39;s words which made me unable to refuse, so I reluctantly nodded, after which She made me wear Pikachu underwear with some frills on which I wore a pink-colored mini mouse printed pajama. When I was ready, my mom looked at the clock as she noticed that it was around 5 p.m. She said to me to play with my toys as she goes and orders some pizza for me and Melody( now David) for being good kids. To which I did felt pretty good, which made me have a nice smile come on my face which looked really adorable.<br />
When my mom left the room, I went over to see a mirror through which I could only see a &#39;cute& adorable little girl with blond hair, to my dread, it was my reflection now, as I was engrossed in my thinking, Amelia came in my room sneakily and startled me, when Amelia saw my expression she asked grinningly &quot;Did you enjoy the feeling of being a diaper baby that you started acting like one, you got scared witless with just this&quot; as she said this, she continued mocking me &quot;Melody, you should start calling me big sister, otherwise when mom and dad aren&#39;t home, I will make you become my dress up little doll&quot;. As I heard her, I felt really angry that I wanted to punch her and as I went closer to her, I could only see her stomach, which made me feel very powerless, but then I remembered what my mom said, so I told her &quot;You see Big sister Amelia, currently you were trying to harass me which means that for this month mommy will deduct your pocket money by 80% and you will be grounded for a whole week without your cellphone, so I wonder how should I phrase it in front of mommy?&quot;. As I said that Amelia felt a little angry &quot;uh..&quot;, she as though had a 360-degree change, she started pleading to me while saying &quot;Oh my dear big brother David, please don&#39;t tell mom about this, I can....&quot; After mulling over something she continued saying &quot; I can sort of retrieve an item from the stuff that dad took from your room to you if you promise to not tell mom about this&quot;. <br />
When I heard her, I was really tempted, so I said &quot;sure, If you can get me my camera back, I&#39;ll not tell mommy about this&quot;. With this, we both came to a mutual agreement. As we both were discussing we heard mom call us down for dinner.<br />
When Amelia heard she went out directly towards the dining room, as I started to go towards the dining room from my room, it felt like I had to cross a mountain as the stairs I could cross even blindfolded seemed very large to me right now, as I came down I saw that everyone was sitting at there places supposedly waiting for me, My mom said: &quot;Melody, come take a seat.&quot; As I heard I went towards Melody&#39;s seat, which now I had to climb to seat on it.<br />
As I sat down properly my Dad said &quot;Due to the great contribution of David and Melody we are now debt-free, we will celebrate this day with some lip-smacking pizza and pasta. And let me also say this the extra money we received from the operation will be transferred to both Melody and David&#39;s accounts which they can use after they reach 20.&quot;<br />
We all then continued to eat our pizzas, when suddenly my Mom said something really nice &quot; Melody and David, we have decided that you both will be having a break of 10 days to fully reorganize yourself in your new body. So make sure that you try to act like how your bodies should do, so from tomorrow onwards you will try to get used to your daily routines of each other by replicating the environment at home.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay&quot; we both nodded. Amelia also said that she will also help us with coordinating with each other&#39;s lifestyle.<br />
After eating our meal, We all started watching television, when it was around 7 p.m. my mom came over from the kitchen after cleaning the dishes, as she noticed the time she said &quot; Melody, it&#39;s time for you to sleep. Come on get up.&quot; When she said that I looked towards Melody to see her get up, but she didn&#39;t and my mom then came in front of me indicating that she was referring to me. I said, &quot;Mommy, It&#39;s not even dark outside, why do you want me to go to sleep now?&quot; My Mother replied to me &quot;A little girl of 4 years should sleep early since it&#39;s not healthy for them&quot;. I pleadingly looked towards my father and Cassi. My father just shrugged helplessly saying &#39;I can&#39;t help you with it&#39; but my sister said to my mother &quot; Mom, since it&#39;s Davids&#39;s first day of the swap, you should let him slack a little&quot;. My Mom just refuted her argument by saying &quot; She is currently in the body of a young girl, even if I let her stay awake, she won&#39;t be awake for more than 30 minutes, it&#39;s better to let her go and sleep after going to the washroom&quot;. With this refutal Cassi could only zip her mouth and continue watching the television.<br />
My mom picked me up, against my refusal with relative ease, I couldn&#39;t help reminisce about my old body which was even taller than my mother&#39;s. My Mom took me to the washroom and helped me take a piss while explaining to me about the female genitals. <br />
After my trip to the washroom, my face had a little red on it as I felt really embarrassed about what I did just a while ago.<br />
When I and Mom reached my room, she said that she will tell me a lullaby to me like old times to help me relax and sleep. I don&#39;t know why but I really felt relaxed and slept like a log. My mother covered my body with a blanket and left the room.<br />
In the morning at around 9 a.m., I woke up seeing my .......................</p>
