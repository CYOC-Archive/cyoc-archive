<br />
**************************<br />
<br />
At his office on the other side of town Mitch was putting the finishing touches on his presentation before heading to the meeting with management. He was looking through the large powerpoint, when he started to lose focus on it. He could only read a couple slides at a time before feeling tired and bored. He started to go through baseball stats in his head, and then it hit him. He had never cared for sports before, but his mind was telling him otherwise. His memories started to go fuzzy...<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, he felt an intense pain in his stomach. He made a gagging sound, got up, and ran to the bathroom, with his suitcase in hand. He got there, slammed the door, and locked it behind him. He was hoping he was just overreacting because of his big presentation that afternoon. He looked in the window and wiped some sweat off his forehead.<br />
<br />
Mitch had arrived at work wearing traditional business wear: black suit, black tie, white dress shirt, and shinny black dress shoes. He was clean shaven and his short trim non-descript brown hair was parted neatly to one side, but, before his eyes, his dress shirt began to whiten, and blue stripes appeared vertically up and down the shirt. The sleeves shrunk down to the typical length of a t-shirt or a uniform. The material thinned out, cheapening and becoming cotton. His dress shirt changed in the other way, becoming thicker, and turning a navy blue. The sleeves raced down his arms, and the shirt became thicker. From nowhere, a logo hit him on the left side of his chest, he recgonized it as the New York Yangees team logo. ZANDEN, along with the number 8, smacked him on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, my uniform!&quot; thought Mitch. &quot;But wait, a uniform? I don't pay baseball... or do I?&quot; Mitch was confused, the two personas battling in his head for superiority.<br />
<br />
The tie on Mitch looked very out of place. It started moving, by itself, inching up Mitch's body, wrapping itself around his head. The two ends of the tie started to fuse together, looking like Mitch was wearing a bowl or something. A brim started to stick out of the hat, going slightly over Mitch's eyes, sheilding his eyes from light. The whole hat changed fabrics to wool and cotton, contrary to the silk tie it was before. A logo smacked his hat, the same one that was on his uniform top.<br />
<br />
Mitch felt movement under his dress pants, around his penis. His briefs were moving around, and soon it felt like something was cupping his genitals. His briefs had changed into a jockstrap. His dress pants started to whiten, just as his shirt did, and it also had vertical blue stripes appear on it. The bottom part below his knees started to bunch up slightly, revealing his legs. They looked more muscular than before to Mitch. His socks started to stretch up in height, crawling up his leg until you could only see them and the pants, no more skin.<br />
<br />
Mitch looked down at his shoes. They looked very out of place to him. &quot;Why am I wearing these? I wear cleats when I play baseball.&quot; he thought to himself. His shoes started to form some functional spikes on the bottom, and padding started to thicken in the shoe. Where he had slipp on shoes before, he now had laces and a tongue in his shoe.<br />
<br />
Mitch looked in the mirror, and looked at his face. He started to feel itchy around his chin and sideburns, and strached it. Hairs started pouring out of the follicles, and where Mitch had never gone a day without shaving before, there was now a full two days of beard stubble on his face It was a dark brown, clashing with the blond of his hair on his head. Suddenly, he started to feel like he was being shocked with electricity, as his jaw widened and became more prominent as the beard stubble thickened and darkened. Mitch's Adams Apple was much more prominent now. The bangs that you could see under Mitch's hat turned the same color as his beard, and receded. He now had a short crew cut. His biceps started to swell to a huge size, suitable for hitting home runs with. His pecs started to swell and become more defined, and thick, dark brown hair started to swirl around his nipples and down his 6 pack abs, and even down his legs. His feet grew three sizes with his shoes growing to fit it, and his legs started to thicken a bit more.<br />
<br />
Gone was the Mitch of old. Mitch stood there, and he said &quot;Where the hell am I? This isn't practice!&quot;</p>
