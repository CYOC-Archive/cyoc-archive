<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Night was quickly approaching and a sense of dread came across Barbara and the others, in the books and movies night was always the time where the worse of the worse monsters would come out. Since it seamed like the entire city of New Orleans which had a population near 400,000 where now monsters it was safe to assume some of those monsters would be nocturnal in nature. <br />
<br />
“We need to get somewhere safe.” Stated Stacy as she looked around, others had started to move away from the building however more people where watching the burning remains of the hotel. It was strange looking at all these former humans now turned into monsters/creatures watching the fire just like a normal human would. <br />
<br />
“Where?” inquired Lindsay<br />
<br />
“Somewhere.” Answered Barbara as the four of them turned and headed away from the fire, others had started doing so as well fanning out. Some heading away from the city assuming that the army would be there the girls went the other way deeper into the city.<br />
<br />
“Why are we going this way?” inquired Barbara as they followed Elizabeth toward the very heart of the city.<br />
<br />
“My father works for a company which has a building near downtown, I know for a fact that place as a generator and a satellite communication system.” Stated Elizabeth “We can maybe reach out to our families and call for help.”<br />
<br />
“Besides, I don’t think we can get very far and everyone else from the hotel seams to be heading away from the city.” Stated Stacy as she looked back the way they came. <br />
<br />
“You can still see them?” inquired Barbara<br />
<br />
“You can’t?” inquired Stacy confused as to why her girlfriend could not see what she saw<br />
<br />
“I can.” Added Lindsay as she raised one of her many tails up instead of a hand<br />
<br />
“Well cats and foxes have better night vision then dragons and fairies it seems.” Laughed Elizabeth, but it was sad and hallow laugh. <br />
As they moved down the ever-darkening streets it got hard and hard to pass. Cars where abounded everywhere and multiple buildings had fallen onto the roadway making some roads dead ends. They were heading down a side street when the sound of hooves on the road caused everyone to stop. Normally they would assume that a horse was coming but now it could be almost anything. <br />
<br />
Coming out of the darkness was a jet-black horse with a long golden horn poking out of the center of it’s head. The unicorn looked at them for a moment and then kept moving down the road, what caught everyone’s eyes was that the unicorn had a saddle, a police saddle.<br />
<br />
“Looks like it wasn’t just humans which where affected.” Stated Lindsay<br />
<br />
“I was wondering why we hadn’t seen dogs or cats.” Added Barbara as suddenly a squirrel ran across a nearby power line, however two very large fangs kind of like a Sabre tooth cat poked out from it’s mouth. All four of them paused and watched as the squirrel moved down the line, then suddenly a nearby tree limb shot out and wrapped itself around the squirrel and pulled it back toward itself Before their eyes they watched a large mouth with razor sharp teeth appear on the tree as it proceeded to eat the squirrel. <br />
<br />
“My God.” Said Elizabeth as some of the squirrel’s blood ran down the bark of the tree as the mouth once again disappeared. <br />
<br />
“Even the trees are deadly?” inquired Barbara as she looked toward another tree…that looked normal enough but so did the 1st tree. They where all wondering what had become magical in nature and what hadn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
“We need to find a place to hide, there is no way we can reach downtown by nightfall.” Stated Stacy as they kept going. As the darkness took greater and greater hold on the city, the need to find a place to hide became paramount to everything else a sense of dread began to fill them. <br />
<br />
In the end they found what looked to be a small night club, it was not much a warehouse like building with a large dance floor and a second floor with multiple tables, lounge areas and the like with an open area in the middle to allow those on top to see what was happening on the dance floor. When they entered, they were not alone, there was maybe two dozen people all of them different types of monsters ranging from an almost perfectly human looking elf to what was an actual ghost. The ghost one was surprising but there he was just floating by one of the doors. <br />
<br />
“Come on in.” he said as he waved them in with a huge smile. “We don’t have much, but this place is safe as it can be.”<br />
<br />
When they entered, they found some kids, all of them monsters playing like they would if everything was normal. A young girl centaur, who had to be six at most almost ran over Elizabeth as she played tag with a few other kids all of them different types of monsters they were taking this change in strive. It was the adults who had concern and fear all over their faces. Some huddled around phones trying to make them work but failing. Others were speaking in low whispers to others asking what they saw. <br />
<br />
The only adult who did not seam that concern was an elderly looking African American man who sat near the DJ stand at the front of the dance floor. He was playing a saxophone and playing it well as someone sang along. It took a few moments for Barbara to realize that it was the same old man, he had grown a second head and an extra set of arms. While one head played the saxophone, the other head was singing.<br />
<br />
“Well what now?” inquired Stacy</p>
