<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now who is that?&quot; I asked as I went to the door.  For some reason I decided not to call out and ask who was <br />
there, which I normally did.  Instead I gazed through the peephole.  I was shocked to see Adam standing <br />
outside.  I thought as fast as I could.  I wished silently that Adam would not be able to hear either me or <br />
Rachel for the time being.  I turned back to Rachel and said, &quot;It's Adam.&quot;  Before she could say anything I <br />
explained, &quot;I made a wish he can't hear us.  What do you want to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel looked worried.  &quot;How does he look?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
I looked back through the peephole and tried to ascertain his disposition.  I said to Rachel, &quot;He looks a <br />
little beat up.  And a little sad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The cops had to subdue him,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Adam knocked on the door again.  &quot;Joe, are you home?&quot; he called through the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, what do you want to do?&quot; I asked Rachel.<br />
<br />
She took a deep breath.  &quot;You think the ring can protect us if we'll need it?&quot; she asked.  I nodded.  &quot;Then <br />
let him in.&quot;  Just as I was about to open the door, Rachel said, &quot;The bruises!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right,&quot; I said.  &quot;I wish that Rachel's bruises would return, but in appearance only so that they do <br />
not cause any physical pain.&quot;  The ring did its work and Rachel looked as beat up as she did when she knocked <br />
on my door yesterday.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't feel anything, are they there?&quot; she asked.  I nodded.  &quot;OK, let's do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wished that Adam could hear us now.  I opened the door slowly, and only slightly, so that he couldn't look <br />
into the apartment from his vantage point.  &quot;What can I do for you, Adam?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm looking for Rachel,&quot; he said.  &quot;I know I'm gonna get in more trouble, but I need to talk to her.  Is she <br />
here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, she's here,&quot; I answered.  I tried to act tough and said, &quot;Why should I let you in?&quot;<br />
<br />
His expression soured.  But it turned to one of hurt rather than one of anger.  &quot;Come on, man,&quot; he said.  <br />
&quot;I...I need to talk to her.  I'm not going to do anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed at him.  &quot;I'm going to hold you to that,&quot; I said.  I opened the door and allowed him to enter.  <br />
<br />
He walked in just a few steps and caught sight of Rachel glaring at him from the couch.  &quot;Oh...&quot; he said.  He <br />
looked genuinely stunned at her appearance.  He covered his eyes with his hands.  &quot;What the hell did I do?&quot; he <br />
whispered.<br />
<br />
We both heard him, however.  Rachel got off the couch and slowly walked towards him.  &quot;You beat the shit out <br />
of me, you asshole,&quot; she said.  I had never heard Rachel speak with such hatred in her voice.  Since she <br />
didn't want to take any kind of overt revenge against him, I wondered if she was genuinely angry or not.  <br />
&quot;Don't you want to admire your work?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Adam uncovered his face and looked right at her.  &quot;Of course I don't!&quot; he protested.  &quot;You think I'm proud of <br />
what I did?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said.  &quot;Because it took two policemen to pull you off me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam winced at her words.  It was as if every word she hurled at him was an arrow dipped in poison.  He looked <br />
back at me and asked, &quot;Can you leave us alone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely not!&quot; Rachel said.  &quot;This is Joe's apartment, he gets to be where he wants to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
I tried to broker the peace and said, &quot;Why don't we all go sit in the kitchen?&quot;  I led them to the kitchen <br />
where I had a table around which we could all sit.  I made sure to sit in between them so I could at least <br />
block a direct path to Rachel if Adam tried anything.<br />
<br />
Once we were situated Rachel looked at Adam and said, &quot;I swore out a restraining order.  I could have you <br />
arrested again,&quot; she said.  It could have been taken for a taunt if not for the fact that her face was dead <br />
serious and cold.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that,&quot; he said.  &quot;It's a chance I have to take.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well say what you want,&quot; she replied.<br />
<br />
Adam took a deep breath.  &quot;Rachel, I just don't know what came over me,&quot; he began.  &quot;I really don't.  I'm not <br />
gonna try and make excuses either.  There just is no excuse for what I did.  I'm a lot of things, but I never <br />
thought I was someone who'd...who would do what I did.&quot;  Neither of us said anything.  Adam continued, &quot;I <br />
guess I've got problems I didn't know about.  No matter what happens, I've gotta take care of them.  So what I <br />
really came to say was I'll stay away from you.  I'll have to accept you don't wanna be with me.  I don't <br />
expect you to believe me, but I am sorry.  If you can, try to remember whatever good things we had.  If you <br />
wanna hate me, I'll have to accept it.&quot;  He stood up from the table.  He looked at me and said, &quot;Thanks for <br />
letting me in, Joe.&quot;  He looked at Rachel again.  She stared ahead and did not look at him.  &quot;Bye, babe,&quot; he <br />
said.  &quot;I'll just show myself out,&quot; he said to me.  <br />
<br />
With that, he walked out of the kitchen and then out of the apartment.  I waited a few seconds and then went <br />
to the door myself.  I looked out of the peephole to see if he was still there.  He was not.  I quietly opened <br />
the door and peeked my head into the hallway.  It was empty.  I closed the door and called to Rachel, &quot;He's <br />
gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stood up from the kitchen table and walked back to me.  &quot;Good,&quot; she said.  &quot;Can you get rid of these <br />
bruises again?&quot; she asked.  I complied and wished them away.  &quot;What did you think?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
I shrugged my shoulders.  &quot;I don't know him well enough,&quot; I said.  &quot;But he seemed pretty sincere.  Like you <br />
said, you could just call the police and have him arrested again.  He had to know that.&quot;  But then a thought <br />
entered my head.  &quot;And yet...&quot; I started but my voice trailed off into silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Rachel asked confusedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking back to when I wished for world peace,&quot; I explained.  &quot;I worded it so that no person would <br />
ever consider violence as a reasonable means of action against another person.  And I made that wish just <br />
before you came over here, so it was after he did it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you saying?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That my wish might have made him remorseful,&quot; I said.  &quot;He might never had said anything if I never made that <br />
wish.  Or he might have tried to do something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel looked devastated.  &quot;So what should I do?&quot; she asked as she threw up her hands.  &quot;Have him arrested <br />
again?&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought for a minute.  &quot;How about this?&quot; I asked.  &quot;I don't know if this will work, but we'll try.  I wish <br />
that Rachel would know if Adam was truly sincere in everything he just said and whether or not it was just a <br />
byproduct of my world peace wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at Rachel and was horrified to see her head convulse slightly as her eyeballs twitched and fluttered.  <br />
After a few seconds her eyes went wide and she let out a deep breath.  She stumbled forward and I caught her <br />
to make sure she did not fall.  &quot;Oh, God,&quot; she said as she gasped for air.  &quot;I don't think we should do that <br />
again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did it work though?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
She straightened herself and stood up straight.  She thought for a second.  &quot;Yes,&quot; she said slowly.  &quot;Yes, it <br />
did work.  He was sincere.  It wasn't the wish at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know why he did it?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Again she thought for a few seconds.  &quot;No, not really,&quot; she said.  &quot;I assume he snapped.  You only wished for <br />
me to know if he was affected by your wish, not why he did it.  And before you ask, no, I don't want to know <br />
why.  It's not important anymore.  He was sincere, so...it's time to move on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, then,&quot; I said.  &quot;Before we were interrupted, you said you had an idea.  What was it?&quot;</p>
