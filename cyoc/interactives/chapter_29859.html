<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A couple and their son walked on the beach from the parking lot carrying their bags, towels and an umbrella. It was Wilson family. Max was their beloved child, he was only 9. He couldn't wait for going swimming with his father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, dad! Let's swim!&quot; he said excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet, Max. Mom and I are going to install the folding chairs and towels. Why don't you go there and take a look at that statue? When you return tell us what's that, because I never saw something like that on a beach.&quot; his father said.<br />
<br />
Max's father was an athletic man, but not very muscular. His wife and his son were the most important thing for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Max said happily and quickly ran to the statue.<br />
<br />
When he arrived there he became amazed. A giant muscle boy statue was standing in front of him. &quot;Cool! I'd like to be like him when I grow up!&quot; he thought. Then he noticed that there were some words inscribed on the base. He wanted to read them but he was still learning how to read and he was very slow. He put his hand and leant on the statue in order to read the text when suddenly he felt an electric shock. A spark came from the statue, and went through Max's hand!<br />
<br />
Then the changes started. Every muscle in his body started to expand. In a matter of two seconds, Max became a new boy. He was still the young 9 years old kid he was before, but now he was definitively more muscular.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh... What happened?&quot; he asked himself. Max looked down at his new body. His t-shirt was ripped now because his muscles were too big for it. His swimming trunks were still intact but they started to feel very tight for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha! This is so cool! I can't wait for showing my new body to my friends!&quot; he said excited. The athletic boy rubbed his own muscles, it felt very great.<br />
<br />
But he still didn't read the inscription, so he put his hand again on the statue and started to read...<br />
<br />
Welcome to Sam’s Beach;<br />
Where we offer sun, sand and much, much more.<br />
Touch my muscles and...<br />
<br />
Max couldn't finish reading the inscription! The electric shock reappeared on the statue and went through his hand again. This time, the changes were more radical. He started to grow wider like before, but now he was becoming taller too! When the changes finished he took a look again at his body.<br />
<br />
He was now older. He seemed to be 12 years old in that moment. His body was even more muscular than before. His t-shirt disappeared at last and his swimming trunks got bigger in order to fit his new package.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoah! This feels great!&quot; he said and noticed he had a new voice. He loved it when he heard himself, he did some poses smiling. Having those pectorals was priceless! But he wanted to continue reading...<br />
<br />
...you’ll be feeling great;<br />
You’ll leave here feeling better than you’ve ever felt before.<br />
<br />
And then, he felt the electric shock again when he touched the statue. He grew wider and taller. But he wanted more! He was starting to love that shock and, of course, becoming more and more muscular. He touched again the statue! After the changes stopped...<br />
<br />
Max was not a 9 years old boy anymore. He seemed to be now 24 years old, but his old kiddish mind was still inside that body. He was a muscular man, he was definitively stronger, wider, and taller than his father. His biceps were like bowling balls! He rubbed all his body until he noticed his new manhood. Fortunately, it was very well hidden thanks to his new tight swimming trunks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I changed too much... I should stop touching the statue or mom will be upset.&quot; he thought. He decided to return. His mother seemed to be very far, but now he had new calves that let him run fastly than ever!<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Max's mother turned to the voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Hi, who are you? Can I help you on something?&quot; she said confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! It's me! Max! The statue changed me!&quot; Max said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What!?&quot; Max's mother was even more confused. That man seemed to be an adult version of his son (in fact he had the same number of freckles and was wearing the same swimming trunks), but she couldn't still believe it.<br />
<br />
Ty and Kent were very near and heard the conversation. Ty smiled and decided to help Max. Thanks to his magic he made Max's mother believe him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god! Max! You changed a lot! How are you going to live now? You are only a 9 years old boy!&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry mom. I can still go to school. In fact, school will be funnier than ever with this body! My friends will be amazed! Look, look at my muscles!&quot; Max said happily. He was definitively the same kid but with a new body. He started to do poses for his mother. &quot;And maybe I can become a professional wrestler now! I'd like to be a wrestler, mom! Can I do it? Can I become a wrestler, mom?&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, son. I'll buy you the necessary clothes. But only if you continue going to school.&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll do it, I promise it, mom! Thank you!&quot; Max said and hugged his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoah! Mom, you are very small now!&quot; he said and both laughed. &quot;By the way... Where is dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He went to the car, he forgot the folding table.&quot; Max's mother said.<br />
<br />
Max continued doing poses for his mother. She loved seeing his son so happy. When suddenly...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi.&quot; Max's father appeared with the folding table and he seemed to be very mad! &quot;Who are you?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Ty and Kent were still hearing the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! We have a problem. That boy's father thinks he is making advances to her. Ty you should fix this!&quot; Kent said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are right, this is going to be a problem if we don't fix it. From now, people will still recognize men changed by the statue!&quot; Ty said and a giant white light appeared on the statue.<br />
<br />
In that moment, Max's father recognized his son. Both men went to the sea. With his new body, Max could swim faster than his father! Later, both enjoyed playing on the water like kids and making sand castles (in fact, Max was still a little boy inside).<br />
<br />
After some hours, the family left the beach but... What would happen to Max now that he was an adult? How his friends would react?</p>
