<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William and Martha were still relatively unsure on the results of the meeting. Both had worked in academia and Martha had had some experience in working with young children  as an elementary school teacher, and this had given both of them some understanding of things that related to the arguments that Tom Herald had made at the meeting. And if he was right in what he expected regarding the growth of technology and the possibility of weres being exposed outside Moon Lake because of it, coming out while there was still time to control the narrative made logical sense. However, they were also parents and their desire to protect their children and that left some feelings that weren&#39;t necessarily that logical, and at the same time there was their own memory of how they reacted to the Moon Lake&#39;s mandatory were-law.<br />
<br />
They knew they&#39;d both disbelieved in weres existing until Ben at least partially transformed in front of them, and they were openly antagonistic at first with regard to the fact that at least one member of the family had to become a were. It was something that only heightened some fears over what might happen if weres did reveal themselves. They&#39;d come to love being weres and the healing it&#39;d actually accelerated in their marriage, but much of that started after William had been attacked and became a werefox, essentially forcing Martha to have to become a were just in order to stay with William if a werefox&#39;s bond to Martha formed, which it did. Martha became a werecat, largely recognizing her sexuality and ceased trying to repress it while also nervous that William might bond to Yvette or simply wouldn&#39;t have that bond. It was something that was a firm reminder of how shaky their marriage had been since what happened in Minnesota and that they didn&#39;t truly heal until they became weres.<br />
<br />
But many people outside Moon Lake wouldn&#39;t have those sets of circumstances. And if they responded negatively, which was quite likely, there would be enough of them that they would dominate the conversation. It was that sort of thing that left them nervous and potentially even conflicted as they arrived back home. They could see the plusses and minuses to both sides of the argument and really hadn&#39;t reached a full decision on where to truly stand. The biggest saving grace was that things were relatively quiet when they returned home. The lights were out, which likely meant that Nate was somewhere in the woods with Alex and they took that as a means to go in.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we tell Nate and Eric?&quot; Martha asked as they came through the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now, Eric isn&#39;t a concern,&quot; William commented, &quot;with him being with Julie... we can assume that the Stovalls will tell him, as I think this meeting proved important enough for people to know about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Nate?&quot; Martha wondered as she looked back to her husband as he shut the front door behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll probably come back at the new weekend curfew we gave him after the three of us... changed,&quot; William said with a sigh, &quot;we can tell him in the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha saw her husband&#39;s chest collapse as he let out a deep breath with the sigh towards the end of his answer. It reflected the surprise and worry that came along with what had been revealed at the meeting. And she was sure she felt the same amount of internal conflict on the whole issue, but there was something in the way William had answered that indicated something else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Martha asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had some ideas on what to do this evening,&quot; William said slowly as he looked to her, &quot;take our TRUE forms... go out, see if we could find the Hales... and then that meadow we found.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha&#39;s mind flashed to Douglas and Dawn Hale, a married par of werefoxes from their den who had much the same sort of open marriage that she now shared with William, mostly because Dawn, like Martha, was bi. Martha really didn&#39;t think to much on Douglas, he was polite and friendly and was an admittedly handsome man, but William was the only man Martha felt she needed. The thought of Dawn though did raise more thoughts, as the vixen was quite attractive and Martha did enjoy the sort of sex party the two married couples had had after William formal welcome to the Skulk. Some of the memory set some other thoughts soon through her head and she could soon feel her nipples pushing against the cups of her bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s understandable...&quot; Martha said slowly, &quot;though we don&#39;t necessarily have abandon all parts of that plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
William looked over to see Martha kick off her shoes and then wrestled her feet out of her socks, ultimately raising one foot to pull them off with her fingers. He caught some arousal on her scent as she looked back to him as her eyes shifted from brown to green and her dark pupils stretching upward across her emerald colored irises. He watched her lips pull into a small smile even as brown fur began to grow out over her body, even the parts still covered by her clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;This meeting may have presented some surprises and things to worry over... but there could be some good parts to it that we can&#39;t predict yet,&quot; Martha smiled as she dropped her socks to the floor and began to head up the stairs, swaying her his as she did so, &quot;and if there are parts that aren&#39;t acceptable, the Deputy Mayor did say that the final vote actually doing it won&#39;t happen until they have a plan written. A best this was just the start... perhaps we shouldn&#39;t go too crazy over just the start of something... and have a little fun... just you and me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only a little?&quot; William asked as he could feel Martha&#39;s aroused scent affect him, with his penis growing erect in his pants.<br />
<br />
Martha only giggled as she continued to ascend the stairs and continued to take on her werecat form, painlessly feeling her feet lengthen into digitigrade paws and undoing the button on her pants. She could feel her ears growing pointed and sliding up onto the top of her head, sliding to through her hair as they did so. The meeting might have killed some of the earlier romantic mood, and there was some conflict over it in her mind, but it couldn&#39;t kill everything and she wasn&#39;t about to let it do that. Once she reached the top of the stairs she dashed for the master bed room, feeling her face push forward into a feline muzzle while her growing tail was starting to put pressure on the back of her pants.<br />
<br />
She made it to bedroom and managed to get her pants down and let them fall to the floor, heavily grateful that as a werecat her were form wasn&#39;t so large that she&#39;d destroy her clothing while transforming in them. Though she did have to admit as she felt her breasts swell slightly larger to proportionately fit her new furry body that some of the things she wore before her transformation into a werecat could be a bit constricting at times, though as she got her shirt off and lowered her panties enough that her tail wasn&#39;t being restrained by them. She sat down and let it flip and twitch behind her as she waited for William to come in, hopefully as a very horny werefox. She was not disappointed as William soon entered with his shirt under his arm, a very large tent in his pants, pulled down slightly in the back to let his long brush like tail wag behind him and with his long pointed muzzle pushing forward on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are,&quot; Martha smiled as William undid his belt and pants, letting them fall to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here I am... at full attention,&quot; William answered as he removed his underwear letting his pink vulpine penis stand at full attention and watching Martha give it her full attention. He came forward and as he approached Martha reached for him and gently licked at the erect shaft before her. Her rough tough made William jump a little, but he did little to stop her from actively taking it into her mouth. And as her head bobbed up and down on his member, William managed to see Martha&#39;s breasts bounce a little inside the black bra she was wearing, though it also seemed tight enough that it might be pinching her. &quot;Ohhh... Maaaaaarrrrrrrttthhhhhaaaaaaaaaaa…&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha happily kept going. He might have jumped a bit at the barbs on her presently feline tongue, but the following moan and drawing out her name gave her enough of a sign that she wasn&#39;t hurting him and she pulled him closer to her. As she did so she soon felt his hands drift down to the clasps on her bra. The clasps were unhooked and despite her breasts&#39; natural firmness, they soon bounced free as the bra was unclasped. She let her arms fall limp and then let the undergarment fall down her arms, which she then tossed down onto the floor, as she did so, she soon felt William&#39;s hands reach for her breasts. Even as her head bobbed up and down on his penis, his paw like hands gently worked soft circular patterns of rubbing on the sides of her breasts and even occasionally managing a flick at her erect nipples. It felt good and she managed a small moan even as she felt her husband&#39;s member begin to throb and twitch in her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Martha...&quot; William moaned as she continued and then paused massaging her chest as he then erupted into her mouth and it was only after that that she ceased. She then sat back on the bed licking her lips and looking very much like the werecat that ate the canary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that good for you?&quot; Martha smiled.<br />
<br />
William nodded and paused to kiss his wife. They managed with their muzzles, even if it was a bit awkward, and William did catch a bit a salty taste in his wife&#39;s saliva as what remained. He then smiled to her and decided to continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was very good... and I think I should return the favor,&quot; William smiled.<br />
<br />
He then eased her back  onto the bed,  and Martha soon felt his hands return their attention to her chest. He softly massaged and rubbed at Martha&#39;s chest with the attentiveness that every soft spot that seemed to delight Martha he found and massaged with instinctive precision. William also left a trail of gentle licks and kisses that went down her neck until the same attention was coming down to her breasts, and Martha could clit growing more engorged and leaking more sexual fluid down to her vagina as it pressed against her panties, which where still on. She only became more sure of this when she could feel William&#39;s penis, growing hard again and pushing against her underwear and her clit underneath it but not being able to enter her vagina as she so desperate wanted it to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will... I... I&#39;m gonna cum... Will... I need...&quot; Martha slowly moaned out, trying to urge husband to give her time to get her panties off but between the gentle attention he&#39;d paid to her breasts, licking and nibbling at them and periodically switching between nipples and even trailing the attention down the valley between her breasts. Occasionally a hand slid down over her stomach and then to her hips and then to her butt and the base of her tail and as he stroked her brown fur in all the right ways, she simply began happily mewing and came.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should have moved here years ago,&quot; Martha panted for a moment as she recovered a bit from the orgasm she&#39;d just had and as William finally began to pull down her panties, &quot;Just after Eric was born... he could then grow up a happy human boy... while we became what we are now... insatiable weres, loving every sexual encounter together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;d be complete, enjoying me and the Twists and some other bisexual woman that strikes your fancy as you enjoy EVERYTHING that makes you... YOU,&quot; William smiled, &quot;letting love conquer all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeeeeeeeesssssss,&quot; Martha moaned out again as she wrapped her legs around her husband&#39;s waist and accepted his erect member into her with the private feeling that regardless of whether or not weres came into the open, love would be the ultimate winner.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I don&#39;t think some of these rumors are real,&quot; Kenya commented quietly as she and Ben rounded one corner of the woods and soon came up on what was fast becoming &quot;their tree&quot; where Kenya first introduced herself to him, &quot;Given how hard weres have tried to stay hidden... I doubt raising an army or taking on the state of Washington was ever accurate... let alone some of the other things that had been flying around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben sort of nodded in agreement. His mom&#39;s ended up bringing home some food from the Local Diner and soon withdrew to their bedroom for the night. Ben had a couple of questions he wanted to ask, mostly as the rumors he&#39;d heard around school seemed to continue to escalate, even to the point where some of the teachers even asked him questions because of questions they got. He&#39;d figured Samantha might know something, but he didn&#39;t get much more than a frustrated sigh. Which to Ben meant that even if things with this meeting were &quot;nothing,&quot; they were still creating frustrations that Samantha felt being put on her, even if her role as Town Chancellor didn&#39;t involve her in City Council affairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I get that,&quot; Ben nodded with a sigh, &quot;it&#39;s just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s created a lot of stress... stress you didn&#39;t expect,&quot; Kenya commented.<br />
<br />
They&#39;d met after dinner and proceeded to jog along the exercise route in the woods that ran between the spoke that was Wood Street and the street that Alex Ramsey lived on. There might have been some interest, at least initially, in something more than just conversation, but then some of the pent up frustration that Ben didn&#39;t even fully know was there soon kept them talking. On certain levels he might have expected some residual stress from the debate over whether or not he could play flag football for the Thanksgiving Day game, even though that situation had resolved itself, but it was some of the odd and senseless rumors that had floated about with the meeting. Some of which even made it to the afternoon&#39;s football practice, with one even commenting that he&#39;d heard a rumor about it being that &quot;every were was to adopt a kitten.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Ben admitted and kicked at some of the loose leaves on the forest floor and gave a sigh as he could hear some of the sounds that he&#39;d grown used to in Moon Lake, weres often enjoying each other&#39;s company. Among them were two male howls to their immediate south, which he guessed was Nate and Alex. It was something that he was long comfortable with, and a part of him even thought on the idea on some private fun with Kenya. However, he&#39;d found that the rumors that had gone around the High School had gone around the college as well, and while Kenya seemed fairly laid back with some of these things, he could tell that even a part of her was stressed by all these rumors. &quot;A lot of this may turn out to be nothing... but if so... it just keeps going on and on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which could mean there was more to this meeting than what would be normal,&quot; Kenya commented slowly, &quot;for while the rumors may be absurd, they generally related to a common theme... and if they were &quot;nothing&quot; they would have dried up by now... though... like you, I really needed to get away from all the rumors. Even the meeting would be too much... I&#39;m sorry to have only added to your stress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Ben eventually said managing a weak smile, &quot;It might just be a good thing to vent on these things... I know there is nothing I can do control it... but letting stay bottled up can be good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kenya slow nodded her head and rubbed her rounded muzzle to Ben&#39;s, which he then returned. Some things might not be perfect, and the stress that came down from all these rumors was one of those things, and while neither knew about the meeting&#39;s results, they could at least take some solace in being able to talk things out. It relieved some of the stress.</p>
