<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is not an accurate portrayal of condom sizing in real life. Be sure to properly research the right condom for you, and know that safe sexual practices don&#39;t stop there!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake sees a sign on the empty shelf with the "Xtr Sml Cdm" price label<br />
<br />
"Please inquire about this product with one of our staff!"<br />
<br />
He groans and spots a guy wearing the store's uniform stocking shelves a few feet away. Jake plucks up his courage walks up behind the clerk and clears his throat.<br />
<br />
"Ehm I was wondering about an...item...back there. The note said I should ask..."<br />
<br />
The clerk turned around and Jake immediately recognized him as one of the guys on his football team he didn't really talk to. He blushed and starts trying to retract his statement and duck away but it's too late.<br />
<br />
"Oh you mean the extra small condoms?" Josh declared loud enough for anyone nearby to hear "Yea we had to stick them behind the counter because they kept getting stolen. People getting them as gag gifts can't be bothered paying, kids who want to know what wearing condoms are like but can't afford them, guys who are too embarrassed to go to the counter stuff like that."<br />
<br />
"Uh yea well my mate has this birthday coming up" Jake stumbled quickly "and I think it would be a funny..."<br />
<br />
"Don't worry, you don't have to explain" smirked Josh. "Come with me to the counter Jake"<br />
<br />
Any hope that maybe Josh didn't recognize him evaporated as Jake dejectedly shuffled towards the counter behind Josh, trying not to stimulate his penis too much. He waited at the counter while Josh looked around for the condoms, after a few minutes he called out to the back room.<br />
<br />
"Coa-Uhh Mr Davis!" Josh yelled "Where are the extra small condoms?"<br />
<br />
Jake was beyond mortified, what was wrong with this guy. Just as he thought his day couldn't get worse, he saw a large bearded man emerge from the back room and instantly recognized him as the coach of Jake's football team and father of Brandon Davis, one of the linemen. <br />
<br />
"C-coach Davis-" Jake stammered "I didn't know you worked h-here"<br />
<br />
"I own the shop, Brandon eats so much I can't pay my bills just by coaching," Coach Davis joked "Now you're looking for the extra small condoms?"<br />
<br />
"I'm not..." Jake blushed "It's for a friend..."<br />
<br />
"Now now, there's no need to be embarrassed" Coach Davis assured "Safe Sex is very important, especially for young men. Much better you come in for condoms now than a pregnancy test later."<br />
<br />
Though Coach Davis was a friendly guy off the field, when practice came around he had a sharp tongue and a cruel streak, always barking insults to push them harder. Jake hoped this wouldn't be used as fodder against him at next practice.<br />
<br />
"Umm, yea, well can I just get the...stuff" Jake rushed, trying to hurry things along. Josh had returned to stocking shelves nearby but Jake knew he was listening in.<br />
<br />
"Well, there's another reason besides theft I keep them behind the counter" Coach Davis explained bluntly "A lot of men who lack confidence will underestimate the size of their penises. They don't bother to measure, and since guys look at their penis from above, perspective tends to make it look smaller than it actually is. Other times inexperienced men might think because their penis is very short they need the extra smalls, even though their girth is more suited to the smalls or normals. This can cause the extra small condoms to break. You need to be absolutely sure you've measured your penis properly before you use these. If you are anything over four inches in girth, you are better off with a small condom and only rolling out half. Have you properly measured you penis Jake? Is it less than four inches around?"<br />
<br />
"No coach I haven't-" Jake scrambled, "I'm not- They're just a joke gift for-" But he stopped when Coach Davis gentle smile turned into a stern frown.<br />
<br />
"I'll not be having one of my best players ruin a promising future or drop out of the team because of a debilitating STD." Coach stated flatly as he reached into a drawer and pulled out a ribbon of measuring tape and slapped it on the counter. "You can use the staff bathroom, make sure your penis is fully erect and measure around the thickest part." <br />
<br />
Jake was too embarrassed to argue, and quickly shuffled past Coach Davis who was holding open the bathroom door for him. Jake watched as the door closed and stood still while his small cock continued to twitch and drip. It was still being stimulated by the fabric and he could feel an orgasm approaching. Slowly Jake pulled his jeans down to his ankles and his underwear to his knees. This gave his tiny dick some room to move without rubbing against anything. Jake figured he might as well measure properly since he was here. He wasn't sure about his girth and maybe coach was right; the small condoms might suit him better.<br />
<br />
A full three minutes passed before Jake felt his tiny worm had settled enough for him to touch it without cumming. He slowly wrapped the tape around his stiff weenie, careful not to jostle it too much. Even with the slight touch he could feel himself building towards the edge of another orgasm. Just as he read the numbers off the tape Coach Davis' voice echoed from behind the door.<br />
<br />
"Jake, it's been five minutes, are you ok in there?" Coach Davis knocked "Did you forget how to meas-" but he was cut off as the door swung open from the knock. Jake hadn't locked the door. A sudden draft rushed in the room stimulating the tip of Jake's little nub. The resulting startled shudder pushed him over the edge. He watched Coach Davis' surprised expression as Jake's small stiffy started pumping spurt after spurt of semen out of his hard little pecker, splattering white goo onto Coach Davis' black polished shoes. Josh was behind the Coach in the distance trying to contain his laughter as Jake's three incher started to slow down it's explosive ejaculation eventually turned into a trickle, down into his tighty whities. Jake froze with the measuring tape still holding his tiny dribbling willy in place, too stunned to move or cover up, his beet red face contorted in a mixture of shame and pleasure. Once Coach Davis recovered from the surprise, he apologized and quickly shut the door.<br />
<br />
Jake slumped onto the toilet seat completely humiliated by the situation. He unrolled some toilet paper and tried to clean up his undies and the floor. He also attempted to wiped the last remaining drops of cum from his small shrunken weewee only to have the friction bring him back to a full erection. When his trousers and briefs were pulled back up he headed back to the counter.<br />
<br />
"Did you get a measurement?" Coach Davis asked gently, trying to sound casual. "When you were erect?"<br />
<br />
"Yes coach" Jake muttered, eyes on the floor "It was around three and a half inches"<br />
<br />
"Good, better safe than sorry" Coach Davis assured him "Do you want the numbing ones or the normal ones?"<br />
<br />
"Numbing..." Jake murmured as he reached for his wallet.<br />
<br />
"Ok don't worry Jake, this one is on me." Coach Davis insisted as he scanned it through. Coach Davis proceeded to give Jake a pep talk about growing bodies, late bloomers and the completely natural events of healthy young men but Jake was too mortified to pay close attention.<br />
<br />
"Thanks coach" Jake mumbled when there was a brief pause. "I should get going"<br />
<br />
"All right then Jake" Coach finished after Jake had grabbed the bag and already turned to leave, "Remember to stay safe and have fun!" <br />
<br />
As Jake rushed out the door, he faintly heard Josh in the background saying he was going on his lunch break.</p>
