<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He had no idea how long he'd been out for and when Bill slowly opened his eyes he <br />
couldn't quite remember what had happened as he stared back at the gawping faces of his <br />
football associates, all of whose eyes, he noticed uncomfortably, were trained on his dick, <br />
which he then immediately remembered was not there anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay everyone, come on, stop staring. Billie's just had an accident, it happens to the best <br />
of us,&quot; Bill heard the coach's voice coming from behind the crowd he'd amassed. &quot;Come <br />
on, everybody out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gradually, the other kids filtered out of the locker room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; the coach asked sensitively, as Bill pulled up his shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've ...&quot; he stopped pulling them up and showed the coach his privates. &quot;I've ... look!&quot; He <br />
was shaking as he pointed at where his penis used to be.<br />
<br />
The coach's eyes barely glanced at Bill's missing piece.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; he said. &quot;It's okay, but you've gotta understand, the other kids, it's weird to them. <br />
I think they were just taking the chance while you were out to take a look. They're curious. <br />
Everyone's a little curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But - I'm a boy, I had a - I had a -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You had an accident. And it couldn't have happened to a less deserving person. Look, <br />
don't worry about this, you've had your share of problems here what with ... your little <br />
difference ... you know you can always come to me to talk, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill had no idea what the coach was talking about. Why wasn't he freaked out by the fact <br />
that a boy had just turned into a girl in his locker room?! He was acting like Bill had always <br />
been like this!<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, get those shorts on, go home, and I'll have a word with your friends. I can't make <br />
any promises about them understanding but, we'll work through this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill spent the bus ride home in a daze. His mind kept going over the conversation with <br />
coach, while his hand kept going inside his jockstrap, hoping maybe his peepee would <br />
somehow come back. And everytime, he shuddered at that soft, numb, nothingness.<br />
<br />
As he ascended the driveway outside the house, he was relieved to see neither of his <br />
parents were home yet.<br />
<br />
Erika was walking into the kitchen, carrying a couple of grocery bags, as he walked <br />
through the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you DO?&quot; he screamed at Erika, suddenly launching himself at her ready for a <br />
fight. He knew it was her, could tell from the smirking look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whaddoyou mean?&quot; she screamed over him, putting the grocery bags down on the <br />
kitchen counter, beating him back with her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know!&quot; he found himself crying again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; she said sincerely. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got ...&quot; Bill began, &quot;... I've got ... I mean, my ... my ...&quot;<br />
<br />
Erika suddenly felt really bad for her brother. She'd never seen him so upset and she knew <br />
that whatever it was, it must be what the salve on the jockstrap had done to him. She <br />
moved forward to hold him, and though he backed away initially, Bill ultimately couldn't <br />
help accepting his sister's cuddle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry. It was a stupid idea,&quot; she told him. &quot;It did something to me too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Bill asked, pulling away from her to wipe his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeh.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was an awkward silence between the two siblings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show me,&quot; Erika, said, a little too excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Bill replied, putting his hands instinctively over his crotch as if her were already <br />
naked.<br />
<br />
Erika bit her lip looking at where his hands had flown so rapidly. &quot;It did something there?&quot; <br />
she said nervously, wondering whether she was embarrassed or turned on by her brother's <br />
secret.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll show you mine if you show me yours,&quot; she finally blurted out.<br />
<br />
Bill didn't say anything. He could feel his little baby gina squirming between his legs. Even <br />
though he was clearly different down there than he'd ever been, he still couldn't begin to <br />
conceive of showing his sister his private area. They hadn't seen each other naked since <br />
they were kids, and he could barely even remember that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on. You've gotta show someone. I'll go first.&quot;<br />
<br />
He couldn't deny, he was curious about what, if anything, &quot;it&quot; had done to his sister ... <br />
whatever &quot;it&quot; was. He let his eyes drop to the floor as he said, &quot;OK.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erika acted like she'd been waiting for this moment all her life, pulling her panties down in <br />
an instant and lifting her skirt proudly to show him her new shrunken privates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, look, silly!&quot; she shouted.<br />
<br />
Bill sheepishly raised his eyes and let out a gasp first at the mere sight of his sister with <br />
her panties down for him and then at what now lay beneath them. &quot;It&quot; had clearly done <br />
exactly the same thing to her as it had to him ... but ...<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you so happy?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea,&quot; she giggled, wiggling her legs about a little and pushing her puffy lips <br />
together, &quot;I just love it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She lowered her skirt again. &quot;Okay now you. Do you have a little peepee now or <br />
something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill kicked at the floor a little. &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on!&quot; Erika giggled, rushing towards him and grabbing at his shorts, undoing the <br />
button and zipper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; he cried, embarrassed, but somehow he just couldn't find the strength to fight her. <br />
In any case, she stopped fast just as soon as she'd ripped his underwear off. She practically <br />
fell back with a gasp, staring at his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god. I had no idea it would do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stared at his face that was just beyond sad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm so sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill suddenly thought he was going to cry again, but he soon found out it wasn't that that <br />
he was feeling as he felt the kitchen floor growing wet beneath his butt. He could see his <br />
sister watching him pee and felt so embarrassed but he just had no clue of how to stop it <br />
and that's when the tears came again.<br />
<br />
Erika suddenly smiled again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got something.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stood up and started delving in the grocery bags.<br />
<br />
&quot;I went shopping after you left, it's all okay, 'cos I was using tissues in my panties see? <br />
And, but, well, they weren't really good enough. So I figured - I have a baby gina, it needs <br />
baby clothes, so I went shopping, and I got me some diapers. Did you know you can get <br />
them nearly our size? I guess some of our friends have something they're not telling us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill heard a crinkling of plastic and paper and before he knew it, Erika was back in front of <br />
him with an open diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've gotta be kidding me,&quot; he said, horrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Until we can figure out how to reverse it, I can't think of any other option. Unless you <br />
wanna explain your wet seat to mom and dad when you stand up after dinner tonight. And <br />
your wet bed in the morning.&quot; She gestured at the puddle on the floor, &quot;Trust me, this is <br />
far from a rare occurrence. I expect to be going again myself any second.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill sighed. &quot;Whatever,&quot; he said, suddenly hoping this was some kind of freaky nightmare, <br />
at the same time trying to shake the picture in his head of his sister peeing her panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lay back, I'll put this on you,&quot; Erika told him.<br />
<br />
Bill moved across the floor from the pee puddle and Erika put the diaper under his butt. <br />
He didn't know what was weirder as he looked down at his wet baby girl parts, his sister <br />
putting a diaper on him, her own panties still laying on the floor behind her. Erika <br />
suddenly walked away leaving him lying on the soft diaper. She returned with some of her <br />
tissues, with which she proceeded to wipe between his legs. It felt beyond weird, and when <br />
she was done wiping, Bill gasped as Erika suddenly touched him right in the middle of his <br />
new vacancy with her finger. It was cold and tickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; he shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I just wanted to know how yours felt,&quot; she said innocently.<br />
<br />
She stared at it a little too long for Bill's comfort, then finally lifted the front of the diaper <br />
and pulled the sticky tabs tight around his waist. He felt dreadfully cosy in the absorbent <br />
bulk, and couldn't help smiling calmly up at his sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can touch mine if you want,&quot; she said, suddenly feeling awkward the moment the <br />
words escaped her lips. &quot;I mean ... could you diaper me too?&quot;<br />
<br />
She lay back on the floor, pulling her skirt up over her waist, once again exposing her <br />
privates.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you've done this before. I used to like when you did it,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can remember that far?&quot; Bill said, getting on his feet, suddenly loving the feel of the <br />
diaper between his legs. &quot;I don't know if I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well try,&quot; Erika said, raising her butt off the floor and waving her privates towards him.<br />
<br />
He grabbed a diaper and immediately managed to make a mess of opening it out, tearing <br />
a couple of the sticky tabs off completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just get another one,&quot; Erika said, expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay let's see,&quot; he said, bringing a fresh diaper to his sister on the floor and putting it <br />
under her. He suddenly felt a few drops of pee coming out in his own diaper as he got <br />
down on the floor. Erika giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just peed!&quot; she laughed. &quot;You make such a cute face.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't funny, Erika,&quot; he tried to sound angry but for some reason he knew he wasn't.<br />
<br />
As he lifted the front of Erika's diaper to seal the sticky tabs, Erika put a hand out and <br />
stopped him. Her grip felt stronger than usual and Bill wondered if whatever she'd done to <br />
him had done other less obvious things to him than the change between his legs. &quot;You <br />
really can touch mine if you want to, I don't mind,&quot; she told him, all eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't ...&quot; he said, staring at her little gina, and absent-mindedly licking his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; Erika said, smiling and letting his wrist go.<br />
<br />
Bill lifted the front of the diaper again, but suddenly, before pulling it up to Erika's waist, <br />
he leaned forward and put his head down between her legs. He couldn't help noticing the <br />
faint smell of pee, but still, he stuck his tongue out and licked his sister's little lips, <br />
following up with a tiny peck of a kiss. He sat back, scared of what her reaction would be, <br />
but eventually raised his eyes to meet hers as he pulled the diaper around her waist and <br />
sealed the sticky tabs. Erika was smiling.<br />
<br />
Standing up together, they suddenly looked at each other and said in unison, &quot;That was <br />
weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill silently wiped his little accident off the floor with paper towels while Erika picked up <br />
her panties and put her skirt back on. After pulling his shorts up a little awkwardly over his <br />
diaper, he finally looked over at his sister and said, &quot;OK, so what exactly was it that did <br />
this to us?</p>
