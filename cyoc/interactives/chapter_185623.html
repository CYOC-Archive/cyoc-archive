<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I know I&#39;ll need to be honest about all that&#39;s gone on,&quot; you said slowly and then looked down, &quot;as when I left my house... I was an eighteen year old male. Now, I look much older and decidedly female in addition to the obvious canine features that comes with being a MILF-wolf at night. My dad isn&#39;t blind. So it&#39;s not like I could walk in and he wouldn&#39;t notice...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He might not recognize you right now,&quot; Roxie commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the more reason to have some explanation ready,&quot; you replied, &quot;because I&#39;ll either need access to the house... or to at least get my personal things back as things move forward. Which means I&#39;d need to explain why a MILF-wolf wants the personal effects of Nicholas Maxwell. And figuring out HOW to explain that is the thing to figure out.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that was a concern, and dealing with your father. He wasn&#39;t necessarily evil or abusive, but he was highly conservative in most things. In this you knew he didn&#39;t like or support things like gay marriage, which your relationship would Luna would now fall under since you were both female. He likely wouldn&#39;t understand or agree with your being transgender before becoming a MILF-wolf put you in what you felt was the right gender. You also had some worries that he might not respond well to even Luna being a MILF-wolf because he often ranted that the environmental laws that had developed as a means to protect werewolves&#39; hunting ranges and thus prevent conflicts with humans hurt economic progress. And since you&#39;d never told him about your being transgender and didn&#39;t know Luna was a born MILF-wolf until you came into the Vaxer household earlier that evening, arriving at the door would come as a sudden shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might be best to be direct and honest,&quot; Roxie commented, &quot;don&#39;t beat around the bush. Explain that you wanted to be a MILF-wolf and went to our home with the thought that we could help you find one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not knowing that we were already MILF-wolves,&quot; Kellie nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but that may explain what I did, but that&#39;s likely only going to lead to an explosion of anger from him,&quot; you said nervously, &quot;and well, I can accept if he wants to throw me out or something like that. As I&#39;m eighteen, in theory I&#39;d be old enough to go out into the world anyway. But I&#39;d still need things like my birth certificate, voter registration, and so on. We&#39;d need to do this in a way that wouldn&#39;t so anger him to the point where he&#39;d not only throw me out but block me from being able to get the things I&#39;d need for identification.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t tell him you were transgender?&quot; Kellie asked, showing some level of concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really haven&#39;t told anyone until tonight, largely for fear of being ostracized or something like that,&quot; you sighed, &quot;and while my dad may have strong opinions against those things... he&#39;s also tended to miss things that could be painfully obvious to others. As Luna figured it out and was supportive, which was what kept me close to her growing up. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if my step mom also figured it out and thus helped make sure my dad never found out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now... you can&#39;t hide that anymore,&quot; Roxie said slowly and then rubbed a temple with one paw, &quot;that makes things more difficult. Because in many ways... honesty is the best policy. You come out and be direct and to the point. If your dad is likely to be angry over who you are... trying to get around that probably isn&#39;t going to change the response and not telling him at all could well make it worse. About the only thing that will help you now is that despite all his political quirks and beliefs, he may still be a loving father and the worst you&#39;ll get is disappointment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was mostly hoping for a way to ease that sort of blow,&quot; you said weakly, &quot;or a strategy to ease that blow. Something...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If your father isn&#39;t already aware of your being transgender... Roxie is probably right,&quot; Kellie commented, &quot;you may not have much choice but to be directly honest to explain your change the reasons for it. And I&#39;d still suggest that at least Luna goes with you. Roxie and I can come too. It might provide some explanation as to how or why these things happen and how real love endures after these changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Roxie wasn&#39;t transgender,&quot; you pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Roxie nodded, &quot;as Rook... I was a one hundred percent heterosexual man. I had no sexual interest in men and only in Kellie as the woman I loved. But ultimately, because we didn&#39;t know in the mutation of the were virus when Kellie got bit. I thought it was just a normal werewolf and that I&#39;d remain Rook and Kellie and I would live out our lives as werewolves together. But then, it turned out that the were virus did mutate and Kellie became a MILF-wolf and thus when we next had sex... I became a MILF-wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna took your arm and patted it gently as Roxie continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;At first... I wanted to insist that I was only interested in women sexually and Kellie in particular,&quot; Roxie continued, &quot;after all, she is my wife and I love her very much. But then... as I watched Kellie carry Luna, feeling every kick that Luna gave while Kellie was pregnant... as I watched Kellie smile as she nursed Luna for the first time after she was born... a part of me began to realize I wanted that experience. To be a mother. And that meant I would have to be with a man, at least once, or with a male werewolf. But every time a male werewolf has been available... I haven&#39;t been in season. So... in this... that mothering instinct has essentially made me bi over time. I still love Kellie and I&#39;m very attracted to her, but that doesn&#39;t change that I want to be a mother to. And that will probably happen with you, too, Nicki, particularly as Luna goes through her pregnancy with your daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still wouldn&#39;t want to get pregnant with my own father&#39;s child,&quot; you answered, &quot;that&#39;s wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I apologize for that, it just slipped out,&quot; Roxie admitted, &quot;probably because it&#39;s been so long since I became a MILF-wolf that I&#39;m more used to that mothering instinct that comes with being a MILF-wolf and I forgot even how hard it was for me to recognize that in myself. But it does also show how those things adapt and how all of us adapt to this change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My dad won&#39;t understand that,&quot; you sighed, &quot;he might even be more puzzled with you than with me. He might just accept that I&#39;m weird and leave it at that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the condition of my change was more accidental than deliberate,&quot; Roxie answered, &quot;that I can explain...&quot;<br />
<br />
You then nodded. Perhaps Roxie could help explain things to your father on how that change worked and how it affected males that became MILF-wolves. You privately didn&#39;t want to admit that you might find yourself attracted to men, but if what Roxie said was true and that she became bi-sexual because the mothering instincts that MILF-wolves had, and a big part of how and why they got their reference to term &quot;MILF&quot; or &quot;Mother I&#39;d Love to Fuck,&quot; it would be quite possible that you&#39;d end up in the same condition, but for the moment that wasn&#39;t your concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that may not help with the fact that my change was deliberate,&quot; you answered, &quot;and yeah... maybe it may best to be open, honest, and direct. As... I think if my step-mom figured things out... she might at least manage to keep dad reasonably calm. But I don&#39;t know... I really don&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;d be best if we all go,&quot; Kellie spoke, &quot;not just for explaining things... as I think we&#39;ve got that plan down by now... but to present the ability to get the things you need. As by law, things like your birth certificate, ID cards and so on, those things your father can&#39;t just throw away without reason. And despite having XX chromosomes now and looking like you&#39;re in your thirties, genetic tests would prove you are who you say you are and would present your exposure to the MILF-wolf strain. Thus he can&#39;t just withhold it from you. If he flips out, we can explain that we can take your belongings, identification, and leave. If not... we can at least talk and hold some civil conversation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we could support you,&quot; Luna added, licking your cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; you answered, &quot;and I think I would like everyone&#39;s help. Get everything I need and make things easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s go,&quot; Roxie commented, &quot;it may not be super late, but we don&#39;t want to interrupt anyone getting ready to go to bed.&quot;</p>
