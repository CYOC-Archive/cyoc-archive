<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Here and now if this your one wish, to truly appreciate our art!&quot; replies the Lady as she removes those black rimmed glasses and starts digging in her purse.<br />
<br />
You walk in circles looking for the a candid camera from some Tv show.  A quick notice brings to your attention that the lady and yourself are the only two people in this viewing room. &quot;This has to be a hoax or some crazy game show, well I might as well see it through!&quot; you think to yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, what's first, I mean how do I walk into the scene?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
The lady removes from her purse a small gray box with several buttons. She turns to you and announces', &quot;Ready, there is a stop for you in the scene!&quot; <br />
<br />
Stretching your arms out straight as if to fly away into the picture eyes close and a dumb grin comes on your face. &quot;Ready!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly the smells of sweaty horses and humans fills each breath you take. The Sun's heat bared down yet and you can feel your own body lathering as well. Voices of the children calling out in excitement as you arrived. The girl who was sitting on the stallion's back jumps down and runs to greet you.<br />
<br />
Looking about you remember the scene as the sounds, smells, and sight of those draft horses, wagons, and hay baler are all too real. A casual look to the rear brings the strange sight of a small carrige and one old man sitting there holding the reins.<br />
<br />
The Father of this household comes near and greets the old man with a hand shake and a smile. Words are spoken but odd it seem's as if they speak in a different language. The whinny of a horse turns your attention as two boys yell to their animals and the hay wagons begin to move.<br />
<br />
It isn't long before the local insects realize that you are there. Shaking your head and neck in a violent manner rids them from your eyes and mouth. The real use of that heavy tail comes to very practical as swating flies is almost becoming a hobby.<br />
<br />
A wiggle of the reins on your back makes you take your first equine steps. The motion is so smooth that in no time your clopping along and catching up to the hay wagons.<br />
<br />
Now your mind is at ease as the physical excertion of trotting alone removes all wonder or worry. The buggy out back is as nothing at all for the great strength you are feeling. The light touch of the reins and the man's soft but firm voice makes you feel safe and cared about.<br />
<br />
The man's words though not understood, still sound as if he is happy that your there and as his. That ole' Sun is slowly setting but his daytime heat remains. Your trotting brings on a sudsey lather of sweat on neck, shoulders, belly , and flanks. The dust kicked up by those ahead wafts into your nose as each deep breath glups in air and all with it.<br />
<br />
At last the lights of the farm house is in sight and in a short time the boys are removing your harness. As the girl and a lady enter the house the Father and his four sons stand nearby. The man who sat in the buggy is looking into a corral and talking. You twisted your head to look only to jump back as the bridle reins give a tug.<br />
<br />
You almost giggle to yourself as the boy holding the reins clucks at you and tugging the reins wishes to lead you to wherever. &quot;The corral, it must be where you will spend the night!&quot; A passing thought and one filled with happy feelings as you'd have time to get used to being this way.<br />
<br />
The one boy opens the gate as the Father reaches up and slips off your bridle and that vicious bit. A slap to your rearend sends you trotting into the corral. A quick turn to look as the gate is flung shut with a bang. <br />
<br />
A snort of consent to be latched in this dusty corral and not put in a straw filled stall as the other horses were. Then a scent, a wild and sensual scent fills the air. A snort, but it wasn't you! Turning your vision is blurry if not looking at something close. Then out of the dark comes that odor, or a heavy scent of male sex and horse in one.<br />
<br />
The stallion, the circumcised stallion who was once a man like yourself! He plods closer and you duck your head down seeing his massive maleness flagging about. The stallion is very intent on you and seems to be in some sort of domination rage.<br />
<br />
You scream a whinny back to those friendly people back at the gate. Their words sound all too much as ridicule now and you wonder why?<br />
<br />
A hind kick to the Stallion begins a battle you know you can't win. The other horse has been a horse for one long time and you just don't know the correct moves. Around the corral you run as he is close behind. A whinny and snorting you try to ward him away since fighting him could mean injury or death.<br />
<br />
Then he stops and stands screaming whinny after sorrowful sounding whinny. You look at him and then prance back to those people still by the gate.<br />
<br />
The gate opens and the Father walks in holding his hand up for you to sniff. As you obey a sniff his scent he takes a quick grasp of your left ear and sinks his teeth into it's softness.<br />
<br />
Fear takes a real hold as your new unknowing equine mind wonders what's next?<br />
<br />
&quot;THUD!&quot;<br />
<br />
A quick look back tears the man's hold on your soft ear as the huge stallion now is laying over your rump and back. One short struggle lets you know he has you tight, now unable to move.<br />
<br />
A quick look and turn of the head let's you see the old man walking up, a thick glove on his one hand. He talks to you as if in a loving tone. Reaching between you and the stallion his gloved hand picks up something. <br />
<br />
Then true terror strikes as your butt feels very hot and whatever the old man had is now being touched to your rear end. The stallion know's his duty well as shoves his pelvis forward. The heat of your body goes wild as the sudden thrill and terror mix. <br />
<br />
&quot;A horse yes you are but not a male, a mare and in heat!&quot; the thought thrills the horse part of you as the male human feels revolt. Then it gets wilder as the huge draft stallion thrusts into your rear. Inch after each glorious inch plunges down into your rear. At first you hated what was happening but as thrusting continues the hormones of a mare bring on wierd animal feelings of lust.<br />
<br />
After just a few minutes you can't believe but your meeting his thrusts and pushing back agains his sheath. Each movment is a wonderous time of joy as your body feels his weight. Hanging your head in feelings of bestial domination, you are thinking of yourself as now owned by him and not his equal.<br />
<br />
The bang of the rear screen door turns your one eye to see the girl coming into the corral. She comes closer and closer and then digging in her pocket takes out her black rimmed glasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you we had a place for you in our scene!&quot; she says as this time her words sink in and your screwed up mind knows where you are.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fucked and being fucked, a mare and an animal used for it's strength and endurance! I' fucked and not a stallion but a mare, oh such a foolish step I took!&quot; you think as the stallion withdraws and the old man announces, &quot;George keep her here till he's mounted her at least seven times. Then we'll wait and see if she is with foal! If not then Samson there can have her till he gets it right!&quot;</p>
