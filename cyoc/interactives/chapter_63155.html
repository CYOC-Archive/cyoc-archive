<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Going into the room you see that there are at 12 showers, 6 on each side. The showers are in cubicles that have opaque glass doors that go from the top of the cubicle t the bottom, with a gap at the bottom at least 30cm's off the floor. A long double-sided wooden bench sits in the middle of the room, at the end of the room stands some lockers and a towel rack with clean white towels on them. Taking one of them you place it on part of the bench in front of the 2nd cubicle from the entrance and begin to undress. You clothes are really damp from all the sweating you did when you took the vaccine and stink slightly too, probably due to the dumpster you sat next to when you were hiding from that guard from before. Leaving your clothes on the bench you step into the cubicle and turn the shower on, feeling the cool drops of water hitting you head and face was nice after the stressful day you have had. You spend a couple minutes to relax in the coolness of the water hitting you, letting your mind wander off.<br />
<br />
You start to think about Becky and if she is OK wherever she was taken to. Looking around the cubicle you see that there is a bottle of shampoo and some shower gel in a dish to your left and a washing scrunchy underneath it on a hook. You pick the shampoo first and get hit the smell almost immediately, you can tell it is honey incensed but the sheer power of the smell nearly knocks you out at first. Pulling the bottle away quickly you cough as you try to catch your breath again. 'That is some strong stuff' you think to yourself. You try not to smell it again as you put some into your hands to wash you hair. When you put the bottle back and raise you hands to your head you notice that it is really matted and full of knots. Before you even start you hit your new ears atop your head, you never really had a good feel of them before, as last time you did you were in a state of panic, but they are really soft to touch. As you lightly stroke them you feel them flick, like a dogs would when someone touches them, but they are reflex actions that you do not even know you could do already. You think about making them go flat and they do so, you then make them swivel around, then you make one go down then the other go up. While amusing it was also kind of disheartening that you could control something that, not long ago, were normal human ears that sat at the sides of your head rather than on top and prehensile. Snapping back from your thoughts you resume to wash your hair, even though they now sit on top of your head you move your ears around so not to get them in the way. Afterwards you pick up the scrunchy and lather it up with shower gel, which also has a strong smell of peaches. Washing your body of the dirt and sweat was nice and you feel nostalgic of how normal it seems, just having a shower like everyone else in the world not having to worry about what might happen that day or meeting any strange guards that blow stuff at you. Reaching your back you hit your new tail hard which pulls you sharply back into reality as you yelp in pain. Looking down you can see the tail hanging loosely between your legs. Putting the scrunchy back on its hook for now you pull your tail around to look at it. It was pretty big, mostly due to the amount of fur on it, and long too, reaching down to the back your knees. Having the chance to look at it properly you see that the tail seems to be mostly Gray but it also has shades of brown and black, from the base it starts off as Gray halfway down the tail then starts to turn black towards the tip, their are brown stripes of fur placed along the tail. You wonder if you can move this too so you try to make it flick in your hands but, after a minute or two, it doesn't budge. A little annoyed you let go of it and as you do so it starts to wag in response to your agitation, thinking back you do remember reading on the machine that your tail does respond to your emotions. Going back to washing your self you lather you hands with the shampoo and finish of washing, as you start to hand was you breasts you gasp in surprise as to how sensitive your nipple have become. Lightly touching one you groan slightly as get hit with a wave of pleasure, pulling your hand away, breathing heavily and nipples hardening, you remember another thing from the computer:<br />
<br />
Enhanced arousal and Pleasure<br />
<br />
Blushing slightly you try to push on through you shower, occasionally letting out a small moan when touching your sensitive/erogenous areas. After you finish you turn off the shower and start to head out, your mind racing with the pleasure you just received from slight touches, you face blushing. Exiting the shower you see that Sam still hasn't arrived back, so you start to dry yourself off. However you still feel uncomfortable after touching your sensitive areas in the shower. 'I knew it would be sensitive but by this much?! Geez...' you think sighing. Hearing the door open you quickly wrap the towel around you and look towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luna its me&quot; says a familiar voice<br />
<br />
You see Sam enter the room carrying some clothing and no longer wearing a lab coat. She places the clothes next to your old ones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice shower?&quot; Asks Sam looking you smiling slightly<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; you reply pushing some of you hair off your shoulder &quot;The shampoo and shower gel had strong smells though&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah yes I forgot about that&quot; Sam replies putting her hand in her pocket &quot;You remember right? the computer said you would have enhance smelling ability&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking back you do remember that it said that. Looking back at Sam you she she has taken a book of some sorts from her pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats that?&quot; you ask picking up the clothes Sam brought checking them out.<br />
<br />
&quot;This&quot; she replies opening the book &quot;Is a smelling book. I'm going to test how much your smelling has actually improved&quot;<br />
<br />
Putting the clothes back down you look at the book as she opens the first page and instantly you are hit with an overpowering smell. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fuck!&quot; you shout coughing and eyes tearing up &quot;What the heck is that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's strawberry&quot; replies Sam caught off guard by your reaction &quot;You can already smell it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I can smell it!&quot; you retorts covering you nose &quot;It's piratically burning my nose!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam quickly closes the book and says &quot;Sorry. I didn't realise how much stronger your smell sense had become. This is a slight smell though...I mean I can't even smell it until I put my face right next to it&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking back at her after waving the air free from the smell you ask her &quot;Slight smell? I thought I would faint with the amount of abuse my nose was taking!&quot;<br />
<br />
Walking back to Sam wipe you eyes of the tears in them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry&quot; She says apologetically putting the book back in her pocket &quot;I'll get a lower grade one next time&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright&quot; You tell her with slight guilt &quot;Could you turn around? I need to change&quot;<br />
<br />
Although Sam raises an eyebrow she obliges and turns around saying &quot;No need to be shy. I am a girl as well&quot;<br />
<br />
Not answering you put the clothes and underwear on, noticing that the trousers have a hole in them for you tail. The underwear is simple and a pinkish-white in colour, Sam obviously remembered your breasts size from the machine as the bra fitted perfectly. The clothes consisted of a lilac coloured tank top, light blue denim jeans and white socks. Putting the shirt and sock on was easy but getting the jeans on was a bit difficult. Finally you give up and ask Sam for help.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew you might have trouble with that&quot; she replies sighing &quot;It is a pain to fit in something with an extra appendage after all&quot;<br />
<br />
She pulls the jeans up to your waist and shows you how to put your tail in, so you can do it yourself later. Fitting it in you fell as though that part of you is still not covered enough, but you think that this must be normal as you reason that you don't wear jeans with a deliberate hole in the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; you tell Sam turning around<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem&quot; She replies patting you shoulder while smiling &quot;Wanna have a look at yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
She points to a mirror at the entrance to the showers, which you didn't notice until now. Walking towards it you slowly edge into the view of the mirror, mostly as you dread of what you look like now. You tilt your head in first and see your normal face, which surprises you as you thought you would look a lot different, but maybe this was all in your mind. Walking infront of the mirror to show you entire reflection you are surprised at how normal you actually look. You still look like you, no physical changes, no lopsided eyes or elongated face. You look like you but with a dog, wolf you remind yourself, ears and a tail. Looking at your ears you see that they are the same pattern as your tail, gray at the base turning black towards the tip, and some small stripes of brown. Tilting you head down you also notice that the colour of you hair is mostly the same until it get near you ears, it then becomes grey to match the base ear colour. You feel a sliver of happiness work its way into you as you realise that you don't look as different as you first thought you would have. You feel your tail swish slightly behind you, which causes you to smile and laugh a bit, you even tear up a bit. Sam comes to your side and places her hands on your shoulders and stares at the reflection with you.</p>
