<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was surprised that it was Jessie Tyler who was volunteering. She is 17 years old (just like 80% of the people from school invited to the party); brown wavy hair, 5’8 tall with a curvy body, and (not that I noticed) a C-cup rack. As she walked towards the stage I noticed that she was dress up a Zelda from The Legend of Zelda which is not surprising giving her interest in stuff like that. Which leads to the most confusing part; my relationship to her.<br />
<br />
In the pre-Monica reality; she is the closet thing to a friend that was a girl. We oddly end up in the same science class since the beginning of middle school we were even paired as science partners. We got along great and our grades were the talk of the class. However lately we been growing distant from each other and Jessie seemed upset with me mostly because I was trying to get her to open up more about herself; she never talked about her family.<br />
<br />
In this post-Monica reality; we were best friends not just with me but with Monica as well. The whole same science class and parters still exist here. She and Monica always history class together and were always paired up as partners for projects. This led to us hanging out together which lead to us being best friends.<br />
<br />
However when Monica and I started dating; Jessie been silent with us. She has been silent in our projects and it seem to be keeping her distant from us. Then three weeks ago the most shocking thing happen.<br />
<br />
<b>3 weeks ago</b><br />
<br />
<b><i> “Jessie why did you have me meet you on the roof of the school?” I asked Jessie as we met on the roof of the school. Jessie turn towards me and got closer.<br />
<br />
“I know you’re with Monica but there is something I want you to know.” Jessie said getting in front of me. She almost sounded a bit hurt. I was confused at what she was planing.<br />
<br />
“Which is?” I asked nervously then to my surprised: she stood on her toes and kiss me on the lips. The shock lasted 10 seconds before I accept it and closed my eyes then embracing it. The kiss lasted for a minute before Jessie broke off the kiss. I was surprisingly disappointed that the kiss ended so quickly.<br />
<br />
“I love you, Joey Flynn as well as Monica Beaumont.” Jessie said with tears forming in her eyes before leaving me in my stupor.</i></b><br />
<br />
<b>After school that day</b><br />
<br />
<b><i>“And just like that she left me on the roof.” I said Monica as we walked home (one of the few days we walk home from school) from school.<br />
<br />
“So that explain the tears when the same thing happen to me.” Monica said with concern in her voice.<br />
<br />
“Wait the same thing?” I asked and she nodded as we stopped walking.<br />
<br />
“She texted me asking me to meet in our history class room during free period. I found her in tears and at first I didn’t grasp at what she was saying until she kiss me.” Said Monica. I needed to check something so I turn to face her, put my hands on her face before guiding her lips to mind as I initiate a full blown kiss. Sure enough the spark we always had when we kiss was still there.<br />
<br />
“It felt the same right? The spark we get when we kiss?” I asked Monica with tears in my eyes. Monica tears up as well as she nodded her head.<br />
<br />
“Yes then she says she loves me and you before running off. The problem is I still love you but I also seem to start feeling something for Jessie.” Monica answered. I pull her into a hug to comfort her even thought tears are escaping down my face.<br />
<br />
“Me too Moni. Me too.” I said as I comfort her.</i></b><br />
<br />
<b>Now</b><br />
<br />
I learn two things that day; first I have feelings for Jessie that is just as strong as Monica, and second Monica is bisexual. I knew for the type of trick I was going to perform we need to talk first before I commit to it. As soon as Jessie was on stage; I silently made my wish and snapped my fingers behind my back. The world went silent as if everyone froze in place; everyone except for me, Jessie, and Monica.<br />
<br />
“What the?” Jessie said confused as she saw that everyone but us three seem to be on pause. Monica looked confused as well. I looked at her and as if she can read my mind; Monica got up from her seat and got by my side.<br />
<br />
“Jessie; we need to talk.” I said as if it wasn’t up for debate.<br />
<br />
“Something wrong?” Jessie asked clearly not comfortable about being gang up like this.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry to tell you this but I love you. Both you and Monica.” I declared.<br />
<br />
“And I feel the same, Jessie.” Monica declared with conviction. This cause Jessie to blushed.<br />
<br />
“I appreciate that but as you know polygamy relationships are kind of frown upon.” Jessie said as if she has no regrets. I just shook my head side to side.<br />
<br />
 “Jessie; you saw that some of my magic can alter reality. Everything outside this house now has shape to take into account that those two I turn into their opposite gender were born that gender. Altering reality so polygamy relationships are somewhat acceptable would be child’s play.” I explain which cause Jessie to smile.<br />
<br />
“Really? So we can be together?” Asked Jessie.<br />
<br />
“Yes but we need to plan about your new life since will not be Jessie Tyler anymore but I can try to keep our history pretty much the same as a blue print.” I explain.<br />
<br />
“I think that is a good idea dear.” Monica commented.<br />
<br />
“Agreed but can you change one event?” Asked Jessie causing me to be curious.<br />
<br />
“What point would that be?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Do you remember the summer camp before we started high school? When you and Monica invited me to go skinny dipping with you guys?” Asked Jessie causing the both of us to blush. “Change it so I didn’t chicken out and went with you guys.”<br />
<br />
“That is acceptable. Now let’s get back into position so I can unfreeze time.” I said. Monica move back to her seat and Jessie got to the edge of the stage. I made my wish and snap my fingers then time unfrozen. <br />
<br />
“Jessie Tyler everyone.” I announce to audience as Jessie got on stage causing everyone to applaud her. Mrs. Brockman approach her and put her hands on Jessie’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for volunteering young lady but I must ask why?” Asked Mrs. Brockman and I understood what she was trying to do; get a little more info out of Jessie. “Why do you want to be my daughter?” Jessie turn her head to the side and blush a bit.<br />
<br />
“Do you not remember two weeks ago? Joey, Brad, Amber, and I were working on a science project together?” Asked Jessie which caused Mrs. Brockman to nodded. “I went to the bathroom and caught the tail end of a conversation you were having with your younger daughter.”<br />
<br />
“Betty? Oh right I was scolding her for pushing herself too much in her school work.” Commented Mrs. Brockman.<br />
<br />
“Doing that plus at the end where you hug her saying you were proud so far and she doesn’t need to push herself too much.” Jessie continue. “I want a mother like that.”<br />
<br />
“Your mother is not like?” I asked causing Jessie to shake her head. When she was done she look at the both of us to explain.<br />
<br />
“My mom is a teen mom, she had my older sister Iris at 16. Initially she had support from my grandparents and manage to convince the boy who knock her up to marry her. He had to work part time jobs to support my mom and for a while that was working; but the looks she got from others, cause my mom to conform in the form of going to church.” Jessie initially explained before taking a breath.<br />
<br />
“Somewhere down the line she begin breaking, becoming into a radical conservative church nut. No one knows when and some say her having me two years later cause her to spiral further. Her ‘beliefs’, and need for her to be more controlling cause her family to drift away.”<br />
<br />
“First my dad, her constant complaining and demanding to be perfectly loyal to her as well as support the family caused him to leave us when I was seven years old. He pays child support but he divorced her and reclaiming the life he thought he lost. Last I heard he remarried with 3 kids who he shows more affection towards them then he ever did me and Iris.”<br />
<br />
“Then my grandparents abandoned my mom. At first they were religious as well as their daughter and were happy she found god. However as time let on, mom’s rambling got them so frustrated that they turn away from god. They secretly moved away when I was 10. They say that is when my mom broke as she became very strict with me and my sister.”<br />
<br />
“They were wrong it got worse. My sister was always rebellious and when she was sixteen;  she got pregnant. Unlike mom; my nieces dad didn’t take responsibility and mom threw one hell of a fit. She and Iris got into a fight a lot & mom thought Iris had no where to go; she was wrong. When Iris turn 18 & graduated high school; she took her daughter and moved in with her friends that now live hours away.”<br />
<br />
“Things got worse for me; I had to hid certain things from her hell I lied of where I am this evening.” Jessie said tearing up. Mrs. Brockman quickly pulled Jessie into a hug.<br />
<br />
“There, there little one it will be okay. Soon my girl and you will never have to worry about that horrid woman again. Okay Bailey?” Mrs. Brockman soothe but Jessie did a double take.<br />
<br />
“Bailey? That is going to be my new name?” Asked Jessie. Mrs. Brockman nodded her head.<br />
<br />
“Yes since you’re going to be my blood daughter now; you need to keep up with the B letter in your first name, so Bailey Jessie Brockman will be your new name.” Mrs. Brockman said letting Jessie go who only tear up as the audience coo at this. Deciding now to take control of the situation, I silently made my wish and snapped my finger. Slits appeared on one of the two boxes.<br />
<br />
“This is very touching but we need to get on with the trick.” I said walking over to the box with slits on it and open it. “Now Jessie will you kindly step into this box?” I asked. Jessie nervously step into the box as I closed the box and silently made my wish as I locked it.<br />
<br />
“Now for this trick I will have my lovely assistant…” I said as I made my way behind the box and then dragged a barrel full of swords into view. “Will insert these through the slits in the box.” I finished as the audience gasped softly in shock. Mrs. Brockman looked shock at what she has to do until I got her attention by putting my hand on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
‘It’s okay. She will be okay when this trick is done she will look different but for that to work it has to be you to do this.’ I whispered to her as I took my hand off. She seem to calm down as she went over to the barrel and pulled out a sword. I got in front of the box and knocked on it.<br />
<br />
“Jessie, are you okay in there?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Is it too late to go to the bathroom?” Jessie jokingly asked. I chuckled as Mrs. Brockman moved into position to insert the sword.<br />
<br />
“Okay this may pinch a bit.” I said as Mrs. Brockman insert the sword.<br />
<br />
<i>‘I wish for a world where polygamy relationships exist within reason. For example if a male starts a relationship with multiple females all females must be bisexual with the same going for the opposite, are the only polygamy relationships allow to legally exist. This type of relationship is made legal three decades ago.’</i> I silently wished as Mrs. Brockman insert the rest of the swords into the box on the three sides minus the door.. <br />
<br />
Soon she got the swords in all the slits she could see, she move to the front of the box with looks of concern on her face. I unlock the box and open the door to reveal all the swords sticking in but no Jessie. Mrs. Brockman sigh with relief as I closed the door and locked it. I turn to address the audience.<br />
<br />
“Now it seems that my assistant made our volunteer disappeared so it is her responsibility to take those swords out and make our volunteer reappear.” I said as I motion for Mrs. Brockman to proceed but she just stoop there looking at the audience with an angry look. I clear my throat getting her attention.<br />
<br />
“Sorry about that.” Apologized Mrs. Brockman turn back to the box and walked up to it.<br />
<br />
<i>‘I wish as soon as Mrs. Brockman removed the final sword; Jessie will reappear in the box. However not as Jessie Tyler but as Bailey Jessie Brockman; Tim & Julie Brockman’s seventeen year old middle daughter whose birthday is today and is the perfect combination of the both of them. She will have no memory of being Jessie Tyler just the new memories of Bailey Jessie Brockman.<br />
<br />
Also she is mine and Monica’s girlfriend in a polygamy relationship going on for three months that we were keeping secret until tonight. Our personal history with her is identical to when she was Jessie Tyler except in the summer camp before high school, she went skinny dipping with us. No one but me, Mrs. Brockman, Monica, and everyone watching the show will be aware of who she once was; to the whole world she has always been Bailey Jessie Brockman.’</i> I mentally wish as Mrs. Brockman took the swords out with urgency. <br />
<br />
As soon as the last sword was out; a golden wave shot out and I found myself holding my head sporting a headache. I knew it was a side effect of the reality alteration. I took a quick look at the audience and my assistant who were also sporting a headache and smiled to see that the wish effect was true. I waited for them to recover a bit before I approach the box and unlock the lock then open the door.<br />
<br />
Damn. The new Bailey step out of the box and man was she beautiful. She was wearing the same Zelda costume but it was adjusted to fit her body. Her body could rival Monica’s, her face nearly look’s like a seventeen year old Mrs. Brockman only her eyes and hair look different. No where did she had any trace of the original Jessie. <br />
<br />
“Ta da!” Said Bailey as she pose as if this was rehearsed. <br />
<br />
“Bailey Brockman everyone.” I announced causing the audience to break out in applause. Bailey took a bow as I approached her, once she straighten back up a gave her a kiss on the lips causing multiple responses from everyone around us. “Thanks for your help Bailey.” I said to her.<br />
<br />
“No problem, anything to take everyone minds off what that douchebag orphan try to do Nadia.” Said Bailey as she went over to Nadia and Monica. I silently made a wish and snapped my fingers, another chair appear next to Monica and Nadia. Monica got up while Nadia remain seated as Bailey bend down to meet Nadia’s eye level.<br />
<br />
“Did those last two tricks made you feel better Nadia?” Bailey asked Nadia. Nadia gave a few nods but still didn’t say anything. Bailey smiled and stood back up straight, she turn towards Monica. She smiled as she gave Monica a full blown kiss on the lips getting another reactions from the audience. <br />
<br />
“Mine and Monica’s girlfriend, everyone.” I announced causing everyone to breakout in applause. Bailey took her seat next to Monica who hug her. I smiled as I turned back to the audience.<br />
<br />
“Now for the next trick we’ll need…”I begin to say until Mrs. Brockman came up next to me.<br />
<br />
‘I know the next two to pick for the next trick.’ She whispered to me.<br />
<br />
‘Really? Normally we pick volunteers.’ I whispered back.<br />
<br />
‘Yes but some people were rude during the entire performance.’ She whispered. I just sighed realizing why she was glaring earlier. Well this was obviously more of targeting but I will indulge her for the next couple of tricks. After that she needs to get bed rest cause that is when my wish for her to be well enough to move on her own will were off.<br />
<br />
“Okay folks for this next trick my assistant will pick out two people from the audience.” I announced as Mrs. Brockman pointed to the audience.</p>
