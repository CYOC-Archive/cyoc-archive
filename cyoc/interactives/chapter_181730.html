<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Terry, Fara, Drake, and Kim were four friends who newly introduced into the workforce, found themselves facing the reality that the Immersion Passes had brought to the job market. The simple fact was, with the power of the contracts now in the hands of pretty much everyone either legally or illegal, collage educations didn&#39;t matter as much as they could have. Why spend four to twelve years learning how to do open heart surgery, when you could have all the knowledge planted straight into your head? <br />
<br />
Education itself was becoming seen as something to be phased out by politicians always looking for somewhere to cut corners. After all, with the Immersion Passes, all you needed was a little sign up and boom, ready for tomorrow. <br />
<br />
The four friends had much to their displeasure had found themselves in that transition period, where they&#39;d worked hard to earn their education, only to find everyone else able become the model, well, anything, with their name on a piece of transparent material. <br />
<br />
And the worst part was, was how, well, -perfect- those who signed up were! No mere human being could to match them anymore than the world&#39;s best body builder against a construction crane. <br />
<br />
And that was how the four of them stepped inside the city&#39;s Immersion Center.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we get in, sign up, and get out,&quot; Terry said decisively. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine by mine, this place gives me the creeps,&quot; Kim remarked matter of fact. <br />
<br />
&quot;I still can&#39;t believe you guys got to fold like you,&quot; Drake said. &quot;What&#39;s a man without his principles?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can worry about those after we have that &#39;made for the job&#39; mark on our resumé,&quot; Kim replied.<br />
<br />
Fara sighed trying to shrink into her jacket. &quot;Let&#39;s just get this over with... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry babe, it&#39;s gonna be fine,&quot; Drake said. &quot;And if these bosses tries anything, I&#39;ll just pound&#39;em!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if I beat you to it,&quot; Kim said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t,&quot; Fara begged her friends not making eye contact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing&#39;s going to happen, besides what we came here for,&quot; Terry said. &quot;I don&#39;t like this either guys. I know it being legal doesn&#39;t make it right. But we have to make due.&quot;<br />
<br />
 The foursome made their way to the front desk, with the spiral like Immersion Center logo in huge size on the wall behind it. Sitting behind the desk was a human woman in a business suit and short hair, smiling with bright eyes. She sat up straight at attention, and she had bright blue wolf ears. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the Immersion Center, how may I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re looking for job Immersion please,&quot; Terry said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s no problem at all!&quot; She grinned, her fangs showing. She reached down under her desk, her blue fluff tail showing. <br />
<br />
The naked blue wolf woman stood up, and handed the paperwork to each of the friends. &quot;I know that you&#39;ll all be happy with your Immersion!&quot; She said, her yellow eyes sparkling with delight. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; Kim asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; the anthro said with a nod. &quot;Just fill it out, sign your name, and everything will work out just fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim looked at the anthro critically. &#39;How do these &#39;yes sir&#39; types stand it?&#39; She thought. <br />
<br />
Still, that was as far as any of them questioned it, the Immersion Passes were normal after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Also,&quot; the wolf woman added, her over-sized chest bobbing up and down as she moved, &quot;Please make way in the lobby and fill out the paper work in room 104 please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Fara said first, Terry and the others give her a look, but went along with it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like, right that way,&quot; pointed the busty wolf woman, her tongue hanging out. Her collar&#39;s pretty tag bouncing against her chest.<br />
<br />
Kim pulled Drake along the directed hallway as he continued to stare enthralled at the blue furred beauty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, okay thanks,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Like, see ya soon!&quot; The receptionist wolf woman waved, her long purple hair cascading down her back. <br />
<br />
Terry did his best not to say how uncomfortable he was at the sight, but it was legal for anthro to go around naked as if they wished or it was part of their job, even if he didn&#39;t like it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I say we write it up in room 103 just because,&quot; Kim suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s not make this more convoluted than it needs to be,&quot; Terry replied as the friends went inside. <br />
<br />
The friends entered the assigned room, it was as generic as possible for any room in a business building, comfy and devoid of any identity.<br />
<br />
The four sat down, and taking the pens provided in the room, began to fill out the forums. <br />
<br />
For what kind of jobs they were looking for, Terry filled out &#39;Security.&#39; <br />
<br />
Fara swallowed, and managed to scratch out &#39;entertainment.&#39; <br />
<br />
Drake laughed to himself and filled out &#39;fighting.&#39; <br />
<br />
Kim rolled her eyes and filled out &#39;domestic work.&#39; <br />
<br />
Once all were signed, the text glowed, their filled information becoming part of the text, the paper turning golden and translucent, then vanished. <br />
<br />
None of them questioned this, instead, instinctively, all of them stood up at attention. <br />
<br />
Terry&#39;s clothes vanished as they were replaced by fur, white four along his neck and chest, and light brown fur along his back with black markings along his side. A furry tail grew from the base of his spine, his feet became digigrated paw, his hands gained pads and claw. His head morphed into that of a husk. Around his neck a blue leather collar formed with a police badge as a tag. This was followed by a tool belt around his naked body containing the expected police gear.<br />
<br />
Terry stood perfectly at attention, a grin on his face. <br />
&quot;I exist to uphold the law, to sustain the public trust, and to protect the innocent. I am a police dog, I am a good police dog, I am the best police dog. I&#39;m a good boy.&quot; His tail wagged, a lifetime of police experience pouring into his head. He felt no shame or discomfort. This was normal, he was normal. <br />
<br />
Drake&#39;s clothes vanished as well, his muscle mass doubling, but his strength and durability increasing more so. His skin becoming golden bullet proof scales, even a stinger missile would be painful, but not fatal. A lizard&#39;s tail grew from his rear, as a pair of leathery wings were next. <br />
<br />
His neck extended somewhat, he became bald, a fin crest forming on his head as his ears became tiny holes, his face becoming that of a reptile, a fork tongue slipping in and out. A third lung formed in his chest, he knew instantly it was for his fire breath. His nails became claws that could rip through tank armor. His manhood became protected and unnoticeable, in fact, he felt no lust of any kind. <br />
<br />
Around his neck appeared a &#39;dog-tag&#39; (dragon-tag?), and a headset designed particularly for him. He needed no other equipment. <br />
<br />
&quot;I will fight for my nation, I will kill for my nation, I will die for my nation, for the nation is the people, and I will fight for our people,&quot; the military dragon said proudly, smiling as he stood at attention like a statue staring straight ahead. <br />
<br />
Bright red fur with a white front formed on Fara&#39;s skin, his body becoming bigger, wider, her chest growing to a bewildering size that should have given her back aches. A foxy tail grew from her rear as her head changed shape as well, becoming that of a vulpine and a long braid of hair grown down her back. Her waist should not have been that possibly thin without the removal of internal organs. Her feet were bare and digigrated, black paws actually. Her hands were likewise black paws with thumbs. Her clothes changed into golden jewelry, with red clothes that was transparent and did zero to actually hide anything. <br />
<br />
Fara spoke in a bold sensual voice, &quot;I am a dancer, give me a stage, give me an audience, let me enthrall them with my wiles, let me excite them with my beauty, let them lead them by their own desires, let me give the happiness, it is why I am here, it is why I exist!&quot; <br />
<br />
And finally Kim... who possibly had the most flawless posture of them all. Her body was covered in pink fur. His feet became the digigrated paws with retractable claws. His hands gained the same &#39;swiss army&#39; claws and pads. A long fur covered tail grew underneath her clothes as they changed into a pretty french maid uniform. Her head became that of a feline&#39;s. Kim bow. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am a perfect, obedient, loyal, subservient catgirl maid, I am ready to serve my Master to the best of my ability forever more. And to never, ever unionize.&quot; <br />
<br />
The four anthros smiled at each other. THey&#39;d never felt so free. Free of doubt. Free of worry. Free of indecision. They knew their purpose. They knew their reason for living. <br />
<br />
Kim curtsied, &quot;Let us go and celebrate our liberation. For being given a chance to do what we were always born to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To do my lawful duty with my friends of course,&quot; Terry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;To crush all who&#39;d harm us,&quot; Drake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;To entertain any who look upon us,&quot; finished Fara. <br />
<br />
The four anthros left the room, the three headed wolf woman waiting at her desk for them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like, you guys are cool!&quot; Said the left head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy your lives,&quot; said the right head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Totally hot, you!&quot; The center head said pointing at Terry. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome Madam,&quot; Terry said simply as the four left the Immersion center.</p>
