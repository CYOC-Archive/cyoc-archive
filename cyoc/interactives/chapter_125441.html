<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You are Sean, a boy who has seen too much fan art online of people being transformed into horny, stupid, sex crazed bimbos. So much of it has ranged, but all of it has grabbed Sean&#39;s attention. He loved bimbofication.  He loved watching people loose their intelligence and inhibition, and having them replaced with sexy beauty, a love of wearing the color pink, and a sex drive that could give rabbits on Viagra a run for their money.<br />
<br />
He loved it to a point where he wanted to BE a bimbo.<br />
<br />
Sean wanted to be blissful and stupid to drown out the problems of the world, to just be happy and giddy and giggly. Adapting most of the stereotypical bimbo traits into a secret lifestyle. His apartment was completely repainted to be a pretty hot pink, Sean&#39;s new favorite color. It was so warm and fulfilling to have it surrounding him, it made him feel safe. He kept all sorts of outfits in his closet, most of them being casual outfits for a male. But in the back, he kept a box of slutty, pink outfits, high heels, a blonde wig and three different makeup kits. Sometimes when he&#39;s alone, he loves to put on a skin tight party dress from that box, layer his face with a thick amount of makeup, style the wig into a sexy hairstyle, and pose in front of a mirror for an hour.<br />
<br />
But it also made him feel so empty, realizing he was so far from his fantasy. He wanted to be pretty. He wanted to be slutty. He wanted to be a pink wearing bimbo stereotype. He wanted to be a cum guzzling sex addicted stripper chick. Oh, to be born with the curse of being a boy...<br />
<br />
*ding dong*<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming...&quot; He said in a depressed tone. He walked across his fuzzy, pink carpet in his apartment, loving the feeling of it under his bare feet. He opened the door to his apartment, but saw no one. He looked outside the hallway, to the left then right, then down at a small box at the base of his door. A package? He didn&#39;t order any bimbo-type items recently. Sean picked it up then brought it into his apartment.<br />
<br />
He sat down on his recliner, and opened it. Inside, there were five test tubes, filled with a strange pink fluid. There was no way to tell what it was, all that was inside was a vague note. Sean picked it up, and read it out loud. &quot;To help make your dreams come true. Signed, C.&quot; C? Who the hell was C? Better yet, was this REALLY for his greatest dream?...would this pink liquid make him a bimbo?<br />
<br />
As soon as that thought crossed his mind, the bimbo-wannabe pulled out one of the vials and uncapped it, chugging it down like it was the potion for eternal life. It tasted strange, but yummy. REALLY good. It eluded him what it was at first...until sexual thoughts began to replace his old, boring ones. &quot;It tastes like cum!&quot; How did he know what cum tastes like? He never had sex...it was bimbo stuff! Like, this pretty pink drink was doing bimbo stuff to her! To HER!<br />
<br />
Shauna started giggling, unable to contain her joy at what was happening. As she felt her disgusting tube retract and reform as a heated, tight pussy, she moaned and thanked whoever this &quot;C&quot; was for blessing her with the gift of bimbofication! She groped her bloating chest as her new breasts grew out, rather rapidly. Double H. She grew out to Double H cups in only a minute! She was so happy, and her happiness was only enhanced by a sudden sensation of bliss and ignorance. Yes! Her intelligence was fading!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehehe...like, more fuzzy for Shauna&#39;s head~&quot; She giggled to herself as her brown hair grew out and started turning blonde. Shauna could feel her brain cells melting away as what little thought process she had was turning into thoughts of dressing pretty, and a constant need for sex. To fill her needy vagina, and to drink up as much cum as she could milk out from her lovers! All other thoughts were clouded out by pink clouds of blissful ignorance. &quot;Hehehe! Head feels fluffy! More, more!&quot;<br />
<br />
She fingered herself vigorously, aiming to have her first female orgasm, her transformation giving her a hypersensitive body, so she was going to cum a lot sooner than most girls. Fine by her, she wanted to cum. She wanted to cum endlessly, over and over, it only made sense since she was a bimbo. &quot;Aaaaaahhh!~&quot; Her blonde hair grew down to her plump, squeezable ass, and her lips plumped up to a point where anyone would have a sudden urge to kiss her just to know how it felt. All this pleasure from transforming and from masturbating pushed her over the edge.<br />
<br />
She came. Hard.<br />
<br />
The slutty bimbo came what little brains she had out, almost a gallon of the stuff coming out. If she was still a boy, she&#39;d probably question it. But she was not just a girl, but a sex hungry bimbo. To her, not only did this much cum make sense, but it felt RIGHT...just like it made sense for her to scoop it up, and pour it into her mouth, wanting to taste the sweet and salty taste of her own spunk. She moaned in delight. She LOVED it!<br />
<br />
You were no longer Sean.<br />
<br />
You were Shauna. You loved being a stupid, ditzy bimbo. You loved all things bimbo. To constantly fuck, to stop using intelligence and just be an air head. To make everything you own pink for a bimbo theme, and to share her pleasure with everyone she met.<br />
<br />
Hm...this felt right...but something was missing. You weren&#39;t dressed the part. In fact, you outgrew your icky boys clothing and just laid in your cum covered chair naked. Nudity felt amazing, but you needed SOME kind of clothing. Then you remember that you have a line of bimbo clothing hidden in your closet! And a makeup kit! You can go out and look pretty!<br />
<br />
But then...she still had 4 more vials of the bimbo drug. Perfect. She could go out and make people just like her, not realizing she was the bringer of her own bimbo apocalypse.</p>
