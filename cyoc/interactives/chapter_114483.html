<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Our episode title is also the name of a song first recorded by The Drifters.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
Virginia McCoy gently led Harold Jenkins to his bedroom with one furry arm wrapped around his waist.<br />
Once they were there, she closed the door behind them and said &quot;Harold?&quot; in a gentle voice. &quot;I need to get you out of these clothes,&quot; as she began to undress him.<br />
Harold just stood there like a mannequin, lifeless and still, as Virginia undressed him.<br />
When she was done, the were-tigress noted that his fur was starting to form the classic tiger pattern like hers: black and orange stripes across the body with a white belly beginning to take shape.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to be a handsome weretiger soon, and someday make some weretigress a happy mate,&quot; Virginia said, before dropping her robe to reveal her own furry self.<br />
<br />
As if in a daze, Harold stared at her.<br />
He had never seen her fursona before, but even before today, Harold was reluctant to admit that Virginia McCoy was a striking beauty.<br />
Now, something was stirring deep within him. An animal lust that could not be denied.<br />
Especially considering how long it had been since he had last been intimate with his original mate.<br />
Yet thoughts of her stirred something in Harold&#39;s mind.<br />
&quot;It-it-it&#39;s not right,&quot; Harold finally managed to say. &quot;E-e-e... Eliza...&quot;<br />
&quot;Eliza? Your wife? I&#39;m sorry I never met her, but from everything you told me, she was a wonderful woman worthy of your heart.&quot;<br />
&quot;I-I still love her,&quot; cried Harold, unable to hold back the tears as his shaking started getting worse. &quot;I-I do have some interest in-in you, but Eliza...&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Harold,&quot; said Virginia, as she moved closer to hug him. &quot;I&#39;m not trying to replace her. No woman ever could. But if you stop and look, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll see there is room for more than one person in your heart. After all, Melissa is already there too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s right Harold,&quot; said a voice.<br />
&quot;W-who?&quot; asked Harold, looking around for the speaker, then spotting the beautiful woman standing next to Virginia. &quot;E-Eliza?&quot;<br />
When she turned to look at where Harold was staring, all the weretigress saw was just empty space.<br />
&quot;We both knew this day would come,&quot; said Eliza&#39;s ghost or whatever Harold was imagining in his fevered state. &quot;I wish the circumstances could have been better, but she&#39;ll make you a good wife someday.&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Harold, backing away from both Virginia and the figment of his imagination. &quot;Don&#39;t want a second wife. I&#39;m still happily married to you Eliza.&quot;<br />
<i>His fever&#39;s getting worse,</i> realized the weretigress, seeing the beads of sweat forming on his brow as it started to sprout fur. She knew they&#39;d have to mate soon to complete his transformation, as the hint of a tail began to swish behind his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;We <i>did</i> have a happy marriage,&quot; pointed out his imaginary companion. &quot;All those wonderful years together and bringing Melissa into the world before that damn cancer claimed me. But seriously. It IS time to move on, even if you weren&#39;t at death&#39;s door unless you complete your transformation.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t go Eliza. I still love you,&quot; Harold Jenkins pleaded to empty air.<br />
&quot;And a part of me will always love you too my dear. But your future is right in front of you,&quot; added the whatever she was, indicating Virginia McCoy. &quot;She is a good choice for you and the lady is right. You do make a handsome weretiger. Have a good life,&quot; she added, kissing Harold Jenkins on the cheek before the image of Eliza Jenkins faded from his sight.<br />
<br />
Then Harold turned to stare at the weretigress before him.<br />
&quot;Virginia?&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Yes Harold?&quot;<br />
&quot;Eliza said it was okay before she left,&quot; as he stepped back into her arms.<br />
&quot;We both only want what&#39;s right for you,&quot; replied the weretigress, noting his ears were beginning to shift from their human to feline position as his eyes started changing color.<br />
Without any further delay, Harold laid the lady across the bed, not caring that part of Virginia McCoy&#39;s furry body was on what was once Eliza&#39;s side of the king size bed as he mounted her.<br />
It was slow and gentle at first, as his new lionhood appeared out of its sheath and entered the moist wet folds of the weretigress&#39; pussy.<br />
But within a few strokes Harold started rapidly picking up the pace.<br />
Both growled in pleasure as his penis&#39; newly formed barbed spikes penetrated her depths, making sure Harold would stay within Virginia for quite a long time.<br />
He looked down at the woman and smiled as his face rearranged itself into a muzzle, with his teeth altering accordingly.<br />
Yet it was only when Harold Jenkins let out his first mighty roar as a new weretiger that Virginia McCoy finally smiled.<br />
<br />
Outside the Jenkins house, those gathered who knew what was going on actually cheered that Harold had successfully completed his first transformation.<br />
All but Alice Decrux. The wereraccoon started to cry as she continued to struggle against her bonds.<br />
<br />
Spent, the new weretiger and the tigress laid collapsed within each others furry arms in the bed, their tails swishing happily in unison at completion of their first time.<br />
Then, with his cock still deep within her, Harold sat up as best he could and started looking at as much of his new body as was within sight.<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; was all he said, taking in his furry arms and paws. Despite having something akin to pads on the palms like any feline, the digits were still basically fingers, just with sharp nails on the end.<br />
Then Harold looked down at Virginia.<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; he said, staring at her, &quot;I was starting to feel some attraction to you even before... this,&quot; he added, waving a paw in front of her.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; she asked, never having had such a fulfilling moment in her life, not even when she had her own induction into were society.<br />
&quot;Can we do it again?&quot; he asked hopefully.<br />
&quot;Whenever you like, as often as you want to,&quot; promised Virginia, as she began running her paws through his new fur.<br />
&quot;There is one other thing I&#39;d like to ask you, if you don&#39;t mind,&quot; said Harold.<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; wondered Virginia.<br />
&quot;Whenever we leave this bedroom, can we go out on a date? I&#39;d really like to get to know you both with and without fur.&quot;<br />
&quot;Whatever you want Harold. Whatever you want,&quot; said Virginia with a smile, as they shared their first kiss.<br />
<br />
