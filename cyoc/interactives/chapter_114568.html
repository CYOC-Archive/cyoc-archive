<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike started chugging his stein of Bear Tonic as though in a fraternity boat race, much to the surprise of his wide-eyed, hirsute compatriot.  Try as he might, though, Mike could only get a few gulps down before coming up for air.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn that shit is strong!&quot; Mike said, panting and exasperated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really like it, actually,&quot; replied Brad, taking a few more swigs, as hefty as his waistline.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Tina.  Let me get a water, if that&#39;s all right,&quot; Mike requested,  &quot;something tells me I&#39;m gonna need something to help me get all this down!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or someone...&quot; Brad muttered under his breath with a smirk, inaudible to anyone but himself.<br />
<br />
Tina slid down a clear mug full of tap water to the eagerly-awaiting Mike, who caught it in his lithe, slender hand.  He took a couple swigs and set it down beside his stein of Bear Tonic, and engaged in conversation with the laughably tiny Jason and Brad -  who had been quietly quaffing  away at his pint and munching on peanuts.  Before long,  Brad finished his stein and set the empty vessel down on the bar with an emphatic *clang*.   &quot;And now the fun begins,&quot; he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
At 6&#39; tall and 325 pounds, Brad was not a small man by any stretch of the imagination.  In fact, with his thick dark, but increasingly salt-and-pepper beard, deep-set brown eyes and and thick build - he was the type of guy most people in public would cross the street to avoid.  Brad didnt mind his bulk - in fact he quite liked it - in fact he cultivated this look once he saw the direct his genetics were taking him.  At 36 years old, he did not mind the salt and pepper creeping into his beard  - it signified his transition from cub to bear to bear daddy - something he anticipated excitedly. As a kid, all the men on his dad&#39;s side of the family had be big, burly types with enough padding to show they ate as hard as they worked in their blue-collar day jobs.  Brad had always admired these strong, pillars of masculinity in his family, and looked forward to fully becoming one himself.  In a way, he wanted to surpass them all himself, but in hanging out with Mike, that never seemed a priority, and in hanging out at Tina&#39;s, they had the chance to explore other &quot;facets&quot; of their relationship.<br />
<br />
Having now drank all of his Bear Tonic, Brad felt a twinge of excitement deep inside him.  He liked the way he looked, and he was excited to see how the drink would augment the features he so valued in himself already.  <br />
<br />
The first change Brad felt was a deep sort of tingling in his man parts.  They definitely weren&#39;t growing - yet anyway - but it was the same sort of feeling of confidence and assertiveness he&#39;d experienced when subduing Mike during their, uh, intimate time.  It felt almost like priming the engine for the changes to come, and felt a wave of warmth wash over him.  In line with that, Brad felt a mild itching all over his body, as the Fuzz Muster part of the drink began to kick in.  Mike and Jason were facing each other and deep in conversation at this point, with Mike&#39;s back to Brad, blocking Jason&#39;s line of sight - so Brad was quietly taking in this quiet change by himself.   His meaty and already hairy forearms  turned darker, as each coarse hair grow wider - and between each one, sprouted another, equally robust follicle.  Lifting up the short sleeve of his black t-shirt, he noticed this increased hirsutedness sweeping up his arms and to his thick shoulders.  He saw that for the first time he had thick, bristly hair sprouting on his biceps and even the inside of his elbows - nevermind the thick mansweater that was ever-thickening down his back.  His chest, already fully covered in coarse, curly hair, was thickening to the point that it was tufting and pushing out on his shirt.<br />
&quot;Damn this stuff is making me a furball,&quot; Brad growled lowly slipping a meaty hand under his shirt and grabbing a hand full of thick, luxurious man fur that grew a full inch and a half deep.  Not to be outdone, his already impressive beard also thickened further, moving up to the top of his cheekbones and creeping down his neck, to where it met his chest carpet.  Brad grinned, bearing his teeth, but couldnt even see his mouth behind the face thicket that now hung down to his pecs.<br />
<br />
As Brad&#39;s hair growth subsided, he felt another part of the tonic kick in.  He was sitting, admiring the new furriness he&#39;d been gifted when he was suddenly struck with his muscles randomly cramping across his body.  He twitched one way and jolted another, making the bar stool beneath him squeak and groan against the concrete floor.  One even caused his arm to stretch out and smack Mike in the middle of his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow man, what the hell?  Whoa...&quot; Mike said startled, and seeing the changes in Brad.  &quot;I see that Bear Tonic is starting to kick in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man, ack! isn&#39;t it oof! great?&quot; Brad replied, his voice interrupted by the muscle spasms, but admiring his hairy body all the while.  Mike and Jason just gazed upon the jolting hairy man for the next minute, hoping he wouldnt spasm himself off the bar stool.  As the spasming wore down, the familiar tingling feeling returned and Brad looked up and smiled through his wooly face.  <br />
<br />
With that, Brad began to feel a dull ache all over his body as he looked upon himself and felt everything vibrate and expand. Instinctively, he took his brown construction boots off and kicked them onto the floor, just as he saw his feet lengthen and widen, from a 12 to a 14 to 17EEEE, that covered in thick hair along the top resembled thick paws more than a normal human foot.  That broad base laid the groundwork for the growth to come as his shins and thighs lenghtened, hips widened, chest and shoulders broadened and deepened like a steel barrel.  His wrists thickened as his arms grew longer, and even his skull grew larger and thicker, giving his brow more prominence and deepening his eyes.<br />
<br />
Upon these newly thickened bones, Brad noticed cords of muscle thicken on his taller, hairy body.  He first noticed it as his thick forearms thickened further, looking like he could have the kind of grip strength that could crush a sealed can of beer with each hand.  His upper arms, previously no slouches in mostly filling his sleeves, stretched the fabric as they swelled from 19 inches, to 22 inches, before settling at 25 inches cold.  His shoulders bouldered out, making him look wider than two normal sized men.  His lower body beefed up impressively, with a giant ass and thighs that looked like he could squat a Buick, and meaty calves that looked like they&#39;d ably carried the massive load for years.  Brad&#39;s traps and upper back thickened, his neck broadened to 24 inches.  Most impressively, his pecs began to jut out stretching his black t-shirt to the brink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ach! This thing is strangling me!&quot; Brad barked, exasperated, before grabbing his shirt in the middle of his chest and in one motion tore it from his swelling body, using just his right hand.  Sweaty and heaving for air his enormous body was so densely covered in hair from afar it would have been impossible to tell that he was shirtless.  But his chest kept bulging out eclipsing his belly, then far enough that he could not see his feet below his chest.  His beard was long enough that is bushed outwards at a 45 degree angle, pushed out by his chest beef.<br />
<br />
Now standing, man fur matted down with sweat, the bar directed its unanimous attention at Brad.  &quot;Get an eyeful, boys! I&#39;m quite the specimen aren&#39;t I?&quot; he said, his deepened voice dripping with masculine braggadocio.  &quot;And Tina,&quot;  he quipped, &quot;you&#39;ve done me right!&quot;  before grabbing a glass of water, taking a massive chug from it (which wasn&#39;t that big anymore given his new height) and flexed his pecs, placing the glass of water on top of the shelf it formed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neat party trick, babe,&quot; replied Mike, &quot;but isn&#39;t there something else in that Bear Tonic?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad&#39;s dark eyes widened and gleamed and the mention of this.  &quot;Ohhhh yeah,&quot; he boomed, &quot;now comes the fun part.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Brad lowered his now  massive 6&#39;10&quot;, 440 pound frame down onto his stool, which accepted his mass with a grown.  As if on cue, his hairy, muscular body exploded with mass as pound after pound of fat poured across his body.  Soon, no striations could be seen anywhere on his enormous frame as it became insulated in inches of thick padding , converting his defined, 25 inch biceps into 28 inch slabs of thick beef.  His hairy forearms thickened like ham hocks, his hands getting thicker, his fingers widening like sausages, and his wrists thicker than anyone outside of his husky uncles.  Pounds of fat accumulated on his back and up his neck adding inches in circumference and large, meaty rolls at the base of his skull.  Brad craned his neck back as far as his bulk would allow, feeling the flesh accumulate behind his neck, and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah, becoming a BIG boy now,&quot; Brad boomed, &quot;and only getting BIGGER.&quot;<br />
<br />
His form continued to fill out, well-defined tree trunk legs losing their shape and becoming elephantine.  Love handles piled on by the dozens of pounds, changing his  v-shaped torso into a VERY wide I.  But not for long, as Brad&#39;s belly - of which he took much pride in before - erupted in size. He&#39;d previously been proud of his well-earned 57 inch gut, and the way it ponderously hung over his oversized belt buckle.  That belly would have seen pathetic now, as his abdominal cargo expanded bigger and wider.  His fat, hairy gut ballooned in size, and the hairs actually seemed to spread further apart as pounds of flesh pushed out from beneath, until Brad could see it stick out below his already obscenely-stuff pecs, and then ballooned out inches further.  <br />
<br />
He was forced to stand now, as his rapidly-increasing mass was making his barstool squeal for mercy.  On top of his already impressive 6&#39;10, 440 pound form, the Gut Buster added mountains of fat upon his hulking frame.  His gut couldn&#39;t have been less than 90 inches in circumference and as Mike came over to hug his enormous lover, based on how little his wingspan could get around - he figured it was more than that!.  Brad stuck out his gut proudly as it hung down ponderously over his sensitive bits - having long since blown his attire to smitherines - not that he minded one bit.  For good measure the remainder of the tonic added a few years to his body - though only a couple - giving him a few more flecks of grey to his thinning hair, and some lightness to his sideburns.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; Mike and Jason said in unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Brad chuckled in his now much deeper baritone, causing his beard and pecs to jiggle.  &quot;They weren&#39;t kidding about that Bear Tonic.  I&#39;m bigger than a fucking grizzly bear.  I&#39;m the hairiest guy i&#39;ve ever seen, and I have some absolute BEASTS in my family tree.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad looked down past his immense beard over the beastly body he was just blessed with and took a few heavy steps experimentally.  He noticed his enormously prominant gut and gave it an appreciative swat.  &quot;And, I&#39;ve got the hottest goddamn daddy bear gut in the state - if not the country!  I feel like more of a man than than an entire NFL Offensive Line and I dont care who hears it!&quot;<br />
<br />
A hush fell over the bar and Brad seemed to snap back to reality, noticing everyone was looking at him in silence - and that he was naked.  Well, besides his ample man fur of course.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, Tina.  You, uh, got anything that&#39;ll fit a behemoth like me?&quot; Brad asked, almost sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I for situations like these, we keep a an extra extra EXTRA extra large singlet in the back.  It&#39;s easy to get big boys like you in and out of.  Plus somehow nobody ever seems to mind having to wear it.&quot; Tina replied.  &quot;Let me go get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Tina procured the enormous lycra tent, which Brad put on, as carefully as he could in maneuvering his new 700 pound mass. Soon, he was at least decent, with every curve obscenely accentuated with  red fabric, looking like an obese yeti about to wrestle in the WWE.  He slid two barstools together, and eased himself onto them, causing each to squeal.  Not surprising, since he&#39;d just more than doubled his weight and now weighed as much as four normal-sized men.  He noticed he had to sit further back than normal, as his immense belly kept him a lot further from the bar than it had previously. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you think, little buddy, ready to finish yours?&quot; Brad asked Mike, eyes gleaming.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I think so,&quot; Mike said hesitantly, &quot;but after I go to the bathroom.&quot;  He then scampered off to the back of the bar, confused but immensely aroused.</p>
