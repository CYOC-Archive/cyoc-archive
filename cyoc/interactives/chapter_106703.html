<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martin arrived home after having an excellent day at work. His budget passing the town town’s council with a unanimous vote; signifying that the town’s finances will be in the black for the first time ever. It put him in a good mood. When Melissa called him to inform the Sheriff’s warrant to search Julie’s computer did sour the mood some what. Being told that the sheriff found nothing did alleviate some of his concerns.<br />
<br />
Entering through the front door, he walks to the kitchen to see Julie at the table working on school work and Melissa cooking some chicken and pasta. Martin enjoying the smell from the stove grabs a lite beer from the fridge and sits next to Julie; “What are working on?” He looks at her.<br />
“A history report regarding the Spanish American war,” Julie laments; “But I would like to use my computer to do research.”<br />
“Why don’t you?” Martin asks.<br />
Melissa speaks up, “Because she is not using her computer until she finishes her homework.”<br />
“Can we not make an exception for a history report?” Martin asks.<br />
Melissa sighs, “I suppose; But not until after dinner. Martin can you stir the pasta so it doesn’t clump in the sauce?” Melissa makes a beeline for upstairs.<br />
“Mom been feeling ill all day,” Julie comments; “I thought she was feeling better when she started grilling the chicken.”<br />
“That’s the downside of being pregnant Julie,” Martin comments while at the stove. Your body’s hormonal levels are in flux when you conceive. They’ll rebalance in a few days.”<br />
“Do you know if it will be a boy or a girl?” Julie asks.<br />
“Martin looks at Julie; “Way too soon to tell Julie. Give it a few months.”<br />
“Well then what are you hopping for dad?”<br />
“I won’t lie,” Martin smiles wistfully; “I’m hoping for a boy.” Looking back at Julie; “Do you have other homework you can do until supper?”<br />
“Just some math,” Julie sighs.<br />
“Then get on that first,” Martin answers; “No sense in staring at a blank page for a report, that you don’t know how to word just yet.”<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Melissa was in Julie’s room and on her daughter computer. Inserting a USB thumb drive she installs a key logger program and links it to Martin’s home office PC. After a few minutes the program is installed and Melissa does a test run of it. Looking into the task manager window she is satisfied that the logger is disguised as an important operating system file; she removes her USB device and places everything back the way she saw it. Heading to the washroom she flushes the toilet to ensure Julie heard that her mother was in the washroom; playing off the morning sickness that she did have on and off throughout the day. <br />
<br />
Heading back downstairs to see Martin dishing out the grilled chicken alfredo she started earlier all sit down to enjoy a meal together. With Julie’s back turned she gives Martin a nod informing him that the program is in place and starts at her food; Melissa only hopes that she will be able to keep it down.<br />
“What did you do today dad?” Julie asks, slurping pasta noodles.<br />
“Town council meeting,” Martin answers; “and don’t slurp the pasta. Use a spoon to ball it on the fork.”<br />
“Sorry,” Julie mumbles, trying to use the spoon like her father showed her.<br />
“Today was the day the council voted on next year’s fiscal budget,” Martin continues.<br />
“Did it pass?” Julie asks.<br />
“Unanimously,” Martin answers happily; “It’s hard to vote down a measure that puts the town’s finances in the black for the first time in a century,” Martin smiles.<br />
“Does that mean there will be money to repair the elementary school?” Julie asks but continues; “Mom had the radio on. It was in a news report. The basement flooded in last night’s storm and a tree that was struck by lightning fell over on a power line.”<br />
“Plus the roof in the original section of the school had a major leak,” Melissa answers.<br />
“I heard about that as well after the council meeting,” Martin sighs; “I’m sure there will be an emergency session comes Monday with the school board appealing for funds.”<br />
“If Benton is there, won’t he shoot that down?” Melissa asks; “like last time?”<br />
Martin chuckles, “Benton was kicked off the elder council last night. He assaulted several of Tachibana’s employees Thursday morning.”<br />
“Holy shit,” Julie Responds.<br />
“Language, both parents shout back.<br />
Martin continues, “But that not the half of it. Frieda is now to take his seat when she turns twenty one. Plus the council has bared Benton from shipping her off to some boarding school so that she can be made available to train under and existing member.”<br />
<br />
Julie was stunned but remained silent. While the news did shock her; she was still confident that her plans for revenge will still come to pass. Not knowing that her mother surreptitiously installed a key logger or that Brain Walker was planning his retaliatory act through a worm in an email. Julie quietly ate as she listened in on all the gossip that her father is telling at the table.<br />
<br />
Minutes later after dinner was finished, Julie helped with the dishes while Martin relaxed sipping his beer.<br />
“When you’re done, Julie you can go on your computer to do research for your report,” Martin says calmly.<br />
Julie finishes putting the dishes away Julie grabs her history text book and race upstairs to her room. Both Melissa and Martin head to Martin’s private office and watch through his computer everything Julie is doing.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later both Stovall parents leave the office. Seeing Julie researching the causes regarding the Spanish American War they both wonder if Julie was being truthful with the sheriff earlier.<br />
“If she was up to no good this morning; we’ll never know,” Martin sighs.<br />
“I’m certain she was up to something,” Melissa states; “She’s good in hiding her emotions; but not her intentions. If she did report to the sheriff concerning Brain Walker’s relationship with Alyssa; it was probably her way of getting back at both of them.”<br />
“Both of them?” Martin asks.<br />
“Brian for publicly dumping her at school on Tuesday,” Melissa answers; “As for Alyssa? Trying to get between our marriage?” Melissa shrugs unsure of an answer.<br />
“Either way Julie is bound to slip up,” Martin responds; “I’ll check the logs in the morning to see what else Julie might be doing.”<br />
“Early night then?” Melissa asks.<br />
“I was thinking of watching some t.v. before turning in,” Martin states while getting up; “News, financials and what not.”<br />
“You just want to watch football,” Melissa chides.<br />
“Well it is an away game for the Seahawks,” Martin muses.<br />
“Just try not to be up to late,” Melissa kisses him; “Dr. Frances is coming by tomorrow for another therapy session.”<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
Shortly after supper Julie is on her computer researching about the Spanish American war for her history report. Not knowing that her parents are overseeing her computer use through covert means; she press on. Not wanting to fall behind despite the fact that she is suspended indefinitely from school; she spends a couple hours working on her report. Deciding that she can continue the rest tomorrow she goes on her social media to see if what her father said was true; Frieda being tasked to assume control of her father’s seat on the elder council.<br />
<br />
Not only does she not find anything regarding this or the news of Benton Knight’s public outburst; Julie was about to dismiss it as an unfounded rumor when she realized that if it was true; then the council would do what is needed to keep the event quiet to ensure the town’s secret stays a secret. Instead she checks to see what her outing of Brian’s after school activities had any effect; check Brian Walker’s page she sees several comments from his friends asking what happened to the hot chick picking him up. Pleased that Alyssa finally had to leave town or lay low; Julie was about to turn in when an email shows up from one of her friends.<br />
<br />
Opening it up to find it empty; she shrugs her shoulders and get off her PC. Not knowing that the email in question came from Brian Walker and it had a worm; a worm that would soon cause her problems as it quickly and quietly self-installed and infected her computer. Julie heads to the bathroom to brush her teeth and use the toilet.<br />
<br />
Minutes later she comes out and takes off her clothes. Deciding to sleep naked in bed she grabs the box under her bed and grabs the vibrator she had secreted in it. Turning off the lights she gets under the covers; switching on the vibrator and using her right hand, she slowly inserts it in her sex; Julie uses her left hand to play and tweak her nipples. Thrusting the vibrator in and out of her; Julie sighs and moans quietly as she can feel her pleasure climbing.<br />
<br />
The feel of her pert and erect nipples being tugged and pinched by her fingers; Feeling the soft rubbery barbs on the vibrator brush up and dig into her canal as she pushes it in and pulls out, causes her to bite her lip as her crescendo nears. She winces as her vaginal muscle clamp down and her body shudders as her orgasm rolls over her body. Breathing heavily she sighs in content as the afterglow lingers. Switching the vibrator off; Julie leaves it in her, enjoying the feeling of being stuffed. Julie eventually drifts off to sleep, spread eagle and her juices leaking from her sex; she doesn’t notice her computer come out of sleep mode and several internet windows open as the worm that infected her computer begins its dirty work.</p>
