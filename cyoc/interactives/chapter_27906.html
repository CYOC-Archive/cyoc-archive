<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On the identity request sheet, you put down that you want to become a pro football <br />
player.  &quot;It would be so cool to be big enough to mow people over&quot; you were thinking as <br />
you signed the form and took it up to the receptionist, although in your mind this still just <br />
a joke.<br />
<br />
After waiting about fifteen minutes, the receptionist calls your name and asks you to go in <br />
the door to the right of her desk and sit down.  You open the door and enter, only to find <br />
a small office with a couch, much like you'd find in a psychiatrist's office, so you sit and <br />
wait a few more minutes.  <br />
<br />
While you're daydreaming about why you're here, a large man in a lab coat comes walking <br />
in, startling you.  &quot;Hi, I'm Dr. Thomas and I'll be administering your procedure today&quot; he <br />
loudly announces, holding his large hand out to shake.  &quot;Hi,&quot; you meekly state, and shake <br />
his hand, feeling it practically get crushed from the Doctor's strong grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I see here you want to become a big guy like me&quot; the Dr. says, &quot;let's figure out exactly <br />
what we're going to make you into.  Any particular position you want to play?&quot;  &quot;I guess I'll <br />
play linebacker, mow a few people down&quot; you tell him, seeing him nod while typing some <br />
things into the computer.  &quot;So, like Brian Urlacher then?&quot; he inquires, and you respond with <br />
a &quot;yeah!&quot;.  &quot;Cool, that helps me out here...Brian is 6'4&quot; and was 258 pounds last season, <br />
will that work for ya?&quot;  &quot;I guess so, I'll take any suggestions you've got&quot; you tell the Dr.  He <br />
continues typing into the computer and occasionally writes something down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; the doctor continues, &quot;now I need to setup some of your environment.  As you saw in <br />
the ad, we modify your personality to match your new &quot;purpose&quot; in life, so I have some <br />
more questions to ask.  Seeing that you want to be like Brian, I'll assume you'd like his <br />
personality characteristics too - we'll alter them somewhat so you're your own person still.  <br />
That saves me some time, as the computer helps us out.  I guess I'll get to the important <br />
stuff.  What team do you want to play for?&quot;  Wow, you think, I haven't thought of that.  &quot;I <br />
don't know, I guess I'll go with the Colts.&quot;  &quot;Good choice,&quot; the Dr. comments, &quot;for the Colts, <br />
I've got player number 53 available, is that cool?&quot;  &quot;Yeah, that'll work,&quot; you state, eager to <br />
find out what's actually going to go on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've sent your new specifications to the computer so we can commence with the <br />
procedure.  It will take a minute, so sit back and relax while I go get your room ready,&quot; the <br />
doctor tells you while he's leaving the room.  You're getting just a tad bit nervous because <br />
things haven't gone as you'd expected, but then calm yourself down thinking that maybe <br />
in the room is where they're going to admit the joke's on you.<br />
<br />
It seems like it's only been a couple of minutes, but the doctor comes back in and asks <br />
you to come to the procedure room next door.  You follow him into the room, as he <br />
directs you to a table next to the door.  &quot;Here's the new clothes you'll need after your <br />
procedure is complete.  You see they're all Indianapolis Colts team gear ready for you to <br />
wear.  Take a look at these while I do one last thing,&quot; he tells you and then walks to the <br />
other side of the room.  You notice there's an XL sleeveless t-shirt there with the Colts <br />
logo on the front, even the official NFL logo too.  You turn the shirt over only to find your <br />
last name and number 53 screened on the back.  &quot;Wow,&quot; you think, &quot;they're really on the <br />
ball here.&quot;  You also notice an extremely large pair of shorts in the team color blue, a cup <br />
and jock, and a pair of blue and silver Nike cross training shoes.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It's time for the physical portion of the procedure,&quot; the doctor says, &quot;please remove all of  <br />
your clothes and come sit in this chair.&quot;  You strip your clothes nervously wondering what <br />
he's going to do next and sit in the chair, which is extra wide and has a lot of cusioning.  <br />
You notice the armrests are weird though, as they are high up and extend your arms out.  <br />
The doctor instructs you to put your arms on the armrest and relax, meanwhile you see <br />
he's attaching some tubes into the wall behind you.  &quot;I'm going to now take these tubes <br />
and needles and poke you, they're going to act like an IV but only computer controlled.  It <br />
will only hurt a few seconds,&quot; he says as he sticks you once on each arm.  &quot;That's great.  <br />
I'm going to start the pump, you're going to see a bright yellow liquid go in on your right <br />
arm, and a dark brown liquid on your left.  The brown stuff is like an energy drink, <br />
providing you with a high amount of protein and other nutrients necessary for body <br />
growth.  The yellow stuff is primarily saline, but also includes other necessary nutrients <br />
and one of our special ingredients necessary for the procedure,&quot; he continues, as you feel <br />
the liquids enter your body.  &quot;This stuff is going to make you feel bloated for a few <br />
minutes until the changes begin, but it has to build up in your body first.&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel incredibly cold as the liquid continues to flow into your arms.  You can feel it <br />
spreading throughout your body.  &quot;OK man, I have the trigger here in my hand,&quot; the doctor <br />
explains while holding up a syringe full of a blue liquid.  &quot;I'm going to inject this drug into <br />
your bicep here.  It basically will rewrite your DNA to be a pro football player, much like <br />
Brian Urlacher.  You'll still be yourself when this is done, but your body will be <br />
&quot;professional grade&quot; if you get my drift.&quot;  He injects your arm with the drug - as you see <br />
him press the syringe you can feel it painfully enter your arm.  &quot;God that shot hurts,&quot; you <br />
exclaim, only to hear the doctor tell you &quot;just wait for the rest!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your arm starts to burn like it's on fire.  It's spreading down your arm into your fingers, <br />
and up into your shoulder.  You start to whimper as the pain starts to overcome you.  It <br />
spreads into your chest and back quickly, and now into the rest of your limbs.  You feel <br />
your bones begin to crack.  They're growing.  You look down at your elbows and hands <br />
and see them enlargen before your eyes, quickly doubling in bone size and density.  Your <br />
legs and arms lengthen.  You feel the vertibra in your back increase in size and you are <br />
quickly approaching 6'4&quot;.  Your ribs extend outward and your pelvis widens to become <br />
proportional to the rest of your body.  All of the bone material in your head begins to grow <br />
as well, quickly enlargening your skull, nose, and jaw to a football player look.<br />
<br />
Just as quickly as the bone growth came on, your muscles begin to swell with an even <br />
quicker pace.  It feels as if they are contracting constantly and won't let go.  They are on <br />
fire, pulsing with every heartbeat making them grow bigger.  Your biceps are now 24&quot;, <br />
your legs are now like tree trunks, and your chest has formed a large shelf for your pecs <br />
and a rock solid six pack.<br />
<br />
The burning begins to slow down as the hair on your head recedes completely, making <br />
you bald.  The doctor then takes the tubes out of your arms, telling you &quot;congratulations <br />
big man, you're almost in the realm of the NFL!&quot;.  &quot;Get up out of the chair and put on those <br />
clothes you were looking at earlier.  I know it probably still burns but it's better if we get <br />
to the next step quickly!&quot;.  You get up, still feeling that it is hard to move, but go put on <br />
the new Colts team gear by the door.  It fits perfectly on your new huge body, <br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me big man,&quot; the doctor instructs you, &quot;and go into this small room.  It's our brain <br />
alteration machine, and it will give you the personality and thought processes needed for <br />
the NFL.  As soon as I close the door the machine will start to reprogram you, are you <br />
ready?”  “Yeah,” you respond and the doctor quickly closes the door.  As soon as the door <br />
latched the word ‘football’ enters your brain.  You focus on it, you can’t of anything else <br />
but that word.  Your muscles begin to twitch, making it very uncomfortable, but you then <br />
begin to realize you’re learning how to play football with their every movement.  You then <br />
begin to focus on your new life, how you love to hang out with the guys and talk about <br />
football, lifting weights, and doing drills.  It’s as if many puzzle pieces are falling into <br />
place, making your life complete, filling you with everything you need to know about life <br />
as a pro football player.  It’s coming so fast at you, it’s hard to comprehend it all.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the machine stops and the doctor opens the door, but your mind is still racing, <br />
your muscles still twitching from learning how to use this new massive body you now <br />
have.  The doctor tells you “the head recruiter from the Colts is out in the waiting room <br />
ready to pick you up, so you better hustle!”  Once he tells you that you begin to come to, <br />
and rush out of the machine, grab a gym bag full of football equipment that had your <br />
name and number 53 on it, and went out to meet him.</p>
