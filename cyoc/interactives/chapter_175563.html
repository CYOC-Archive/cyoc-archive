<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Billy was rather confused by what he was feeling right now.<br />
<br />
He was newly 21 years old, and he had never felt so strong, so vital...so sexual. He knew about the latter, after all, he had taken the requisite classes, but there was a difference between learning about something and so keenly feeling it. His muscles were stronger and larger, more well toned than they&#39;d ever been. He had been so eager to grow up, but he had never really known this was what being grown up meant, evidently. And he could tell Luis liked it too. Both of them were fucking jacked!<br />
<br />
Billy couldn&#39;t wait to show off his new build to Katie. She was most likely gonna change her mind about how immature he was based on this! At least he told himself that. Nobody could be immature and have a buffed out body like this! He looked over at Luis, who seemed pretty eager to go do something too. The more Billy looked at him the more curious he got. His breath caught a bit in his throat, and he gasped. He was...really liking how Luis was looking.<br />
<br />
Now, make no mistake! Billy told himself, I like Katie...but it seems... Billy gulped, and then remembered how it felt when Luis felt up his muscles like that. The feeling was incredible, and it was almost like the feelings Billy remembered getting when he thought about Katie. Was this... was this attraction? No, no. Billy told himself. He wasn&#39;t gay! He liked Katie, he liked girls...but somehow, it seemed there was more to it than just that.<br />
<br />
Billy asked in a somewhat nervous tone, &quot;H-Hey Luis...can I uh, can I feel your muscles now too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, man, go right ahead. Fuuuuck, we&#39;re so good looking now.&quot; Just Luis saying that almost made Billy swoon. He loved how they&#39;d developed, and that almost made Billy contemplate going further. Sure he looked this good at 21. But what if there was so much more? Could he look even better than Luis at 25? 28? 30? Billy knew people at those ages mostly as just distant adults, and the idea of somehow immediately acquiring those ages now made him feel a distinctly heady sensation.<br />
<br />
Arousal.<br />
<br />
Billy eagerly moved and stepped up behind Luis, starting a few feet apart, but then drawing closer and closer as Billy grew more daring. He started to feel Luis&#39; shoulders, noting as he did the distinct striations of the shoulders - the backward part, the side shoulder, and the front. Muscle...this was all Luis&#39; muscle. That he had gotten from that leeching cube. Billy&#39;s cock was erect - he was aware of that much. Well, it was half hard right now really, but it was enough of an impression in his pants to make him think otherwise.<br />
<br />
Billy&#39;s hands moved quickly and impatiently, out of due reverence for whatever may end up stopping their session cold. He felt the unyielding masculine muscle of Luis&#39; chest, feeling how tight and toned the muscle was...and then he fingered something erect, pointed, and pressing against Luis&#39; shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh....&quot; Luis moaned as he felt Billy rub his hands over his nipples. Luis himself had never done anything like this, so he was just as inexperienced. Billy kept touching and feeling the pecs and more to the point Luis&#39; nipples, dragging out moans and groans from his best friend. Billy had never heard Luis moan like this before, so he asked, &quot;Are you...feeling alright, Luis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh yeah, Billy, I am feeling amazing! Keep...keep on doing that.&quot; Luis looked back, flush faced and grinning. <br />
<br />
Billy took that as an indication Luis liked what he was doing, so Billy kept going, kept pulling himself up closer. Up until he realized his manhood was pressed against Luis&#39; rock solid butt. All the while Billy was feeling Luis&#39; chest, arms and abdomen, moving quickly across the solid physique his friend had developed. All the while still teasing at Luis&#39; nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Dude...sorry, my uhh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...just...keep going. Fuck I feel something coming on.&quot; Luis responded, and leaned back into it, pressing his ass against Billy&#39;s dick. The two of them moaned almost in tandem as it went on. Billy had never really experienced anything like this before, nor had he really read much about it. It just felt so incredibly good. He...he still wanted Katie to be his girlfriend some day. When she was big and grown up like he was now.<br />
<br />
But right now, Billy knew what he wanted. And this...whatever this was, it was what he wanted. He moaned into Luis&#39; ear, &quot;D-Dude, this is like, turning me on so fucking much...I---should we...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luis tapped Billy&#39;s torso and murmured, &quot;Let&#39;s do something. Move off for a moment.&quot; Before long Billy let go and Luis turned around and gripped Billy&#39;s hands. Billy was able to see that Luis was rocking the same kind of hard on he was. Billy gulped and looked at Luis.<br />
<br />
&quot;G-Guys...guys can fuck too. Do you wanna try that, Billy? Cuz this...this feels really, really great!&quot; Luis said in an eager tone, trying evidently to cool off before starting this, so he didn&#39;t just immediately fire off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You wanna do that with me, Luis?&quot; Billy gulped and contemplated. He knew he was straight...ish as of right now, and he knew he liked girls. But Luis was here, Luis was available, and Luis wanted to do something Billy had never really done before. He looked at Luis...</p>
