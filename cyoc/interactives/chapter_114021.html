<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hell yeah dude, I love it when you fist-bump like a real man,&quot; Simon said, grinning.  &quot;It&#39;s about time you grew the fuck up and learned that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about.  I like it -- I like a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For sure bro,&quot; Devon said, scratching casually at one of his pits, rubbing his thick hand through the fur there.  &quot;Feels good man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; Simon said, rummaging through the athletic bag.  There&#39;s some Axe Instinct.  Stand up so I can spray you.<br />
<br />
Devon sat up off the steel chair, glad to have the cold off his tight ass for the moment, feeling his big ass feet against the soft carpet as he lumbered over to Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here man, let me just mist this shit over you,&quot; Simon said as Devon bowed his head and closed his eyes, letting out a grunt as the first drops of spray clouded over him.  &quot;Puff out your chest, bro,&quot; he said.  Devon did was he told and Simon sprayed a little Axe in the center of his chest.  &quot;Here, let me get your chin,&quot; he said.  Devon leaded his head back, feeling the tight muscles of his neck flex back against his thick back as the light mist settle all over his jawline.<br />
<br />
Devon had his eyes closed and felt his mind wander, which happened pretty quickly as he wasn&#39;t into making calculations and shit like he might have once cared about.  That mist felt good.  He felt Simon spraying some down on his legs and thighs and felt some mist settle on his forearms too.  &quot;Ok man, I sprayed you pretty good,&quot; Simon said, leaning over and rubbing the Axe into Devon&#39;s pecs across his chest.  Damn, Simon&#39;s hand felt good rubbing those pecs of his, Devon absently thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;K bro, what happens now?&quot; Devon stupidly said.<br />
<br />
Simon looked into Devon&#39;s eyes and said, &quot;You just wait bro, should happen soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Devon didn&#39;t feel anything happen, and absently scratched at his jaw.  Then all of a sudden he did, like a tinge in his body had started.  He felt flushed, and scratched almost instinctually at the center of his chest as he started to get hair there.  It just started sprouting from the skin and it really did itch but now he was scratching all down his legs too -- even his face -- as he felt fur erupt all over his chin like he was getting a goatee or even a short beard of all a sudden.  It was just poofing out of him, he thought, bristly and brown and... aww shit, he thought stupidly, as he rubbed his now hairy face.  He had a short beard.  He smiled stupidly, feeling happy about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man looks good on you,&quot; Simon said, clapping him on the back and fist-bumping him on his chest as the hair continued to sprout.  Devon noticed his pecs had started to get more swole, too, as Simon rubbed his hand around them, feeling the contours on Devon as his pecs tightened up, round and hard, the nipples getting slightly hard from the sensation of Simon&#39;s hand.  Devon wanted to feel Simon&#39;s pecs, too, he realized, just so he could feel this good too.  Felt great to have a bro appreciate this shit, he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man, look at those thighs,&quot; Simon said, bending down to investigate the wiry carpet of hair that was busting out all of the place now on Devon&#39;s increasingly swole thighs.  The hair seemed to have caught fire with his groin hair and connected with that, too, as it spread out onto his thighs from here.  Devon&#39;s lower legs were the most hairy, and he was getting some real beastly calves, too.  &quot;Yeah man, getting cut,&quot; Simon said, wrapping one thick hand around Devon&#39;s hairy leg to feel diamond shape he was getting.  &quot;Flex your leg, dude.&quot;  Devon did as he was told, flexing hard against Simon&#39;s smooth palm so he could really feel it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah bro, where&#39;s a mirror, here,&quot; Simon said, leading Devon into the bathroom and flipping on the light.  Holy shit.  Devon looked in the mirror and knew that furry faced dude with the thick pecs, the hair that had sprung up in a patch on the center and shit, even all down his more ripped forearms in a fuzzy tangle of masculinity -- that was him now.  He grinned stupidly and flexed one arm up for the mirror just to see his biceps mound and the thatch of hair bust out.  &quot;Damn man, look at these guns,&quot; he said, turning to Simon and grinning.  He felt like he just looked even more primal, or some shit, he wasn&#39;t sure what he was talking about... anyhow, with this fur on his face.  It felt good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, Simon dude, I could just wrestle the fuck out of you for doing this to me, man, here let me give you a bear hug,&quot; he said, grabbing Simon around the chest with both arms and squeezing him tight as Simon laughed.  Simon rubbed the hair on Devon&#39;s head, &quot;yeah man, feels good, am I right?  I&#39;d wrestle the shit out of you so fast you wouldn&#39;t know what hit you though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah you think you could take me?&quot; Devon said, feeling free and unrestrained.  &quot;Like, we should do it, dude.  We should go camping or some shit and just practice some moves on each other, I bet no way you could pin me first try.&quot;  Devon didn&#39;t even know what he was talking about, really, right now he was just feeling super grateful and excited about how his body felt.  He pulled Simon closer to him, looking straight at him in a weird way, almost hungrily, but that wasn&#39;t it.  &quot;Dude, feel my chin, look at this fucking beard you gave me,&quot; Devon said, grabbing Simon&#39;s hand and putting it up against the scruff.  &quot;Damn man bet you can&#39;t grow one like that,&quot; Devon said, tauntingly almost.  Damn he felt good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah shit man, you should have only seen you before,&quot; Simon said, &quot;what a little bitch you were.  I&#39;m 100% sure I could still pin you.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Devon said, a glint of excitement clear in his eye.  &quot;Yeah son, you really think so?  You really gonna say that?&quot; he said deeply just to tease Simon with how cool his new voice sounded.  &quot;Maybe you&#39;re the little bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah bro, well I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find out,&quot; Simon said, looking forward to this one.  Devon looked like a whole new man with the broad way his back now flared and that fur all over him.  Simon was totally down for strapping up in a singlet and wrestling this bro.  A weekend out in a tent in the woods might not be a bad idea, but Simon felt really like maybe they should fire up the heater downstairs and roll out a wrestling mat tonight still just to see if Devon even had any coordination with this new jock body.  Simon felt pretty damn sure he could still take him, at least til he got the hang of it.  He loved how enticing and rough -- almost animal -- Devon looked now with that fuzz all over him and his scruffy face.</p>
