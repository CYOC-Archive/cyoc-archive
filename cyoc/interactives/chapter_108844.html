<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan got home before diner and acted like nothing happened at all. Mike and Aaron got home quite late they probably hung out with their buddies or -more commonly now since Ryan started changing them- together.  Even during dinner he still seemed to feel Lauren&#39;s enveloping warmth around his dickhead, of course he was imagining this but to Ryan it felt like it was still warm and being squeezed. His manhood remained a bit swollen because of it. As he finished up he went upstairs and found himself some privacy in his room. He decided to churn a quick one out while leaning back in a chair. He took his swollen partially erect cock and rubbed it slowly with one hand and supporting his shaft with the other. In time while thinking of fucking Lauren it grew to it&#39;s massive fully erect length. He breathed heavily as his closed his eyes and tried to envision Lauren.  He was softly moaning while rubbing it thinking back and looking forward dreaming of all he could do to her. He then in a somewhat thoughtless horny euphoric high decided he could make Lauren even better! He straightened up and let his erect cock rest on his lap  while the thoughts of making Lauren even more stunning made it feel even harder and made it throb even more. <br />
<br />
He opened up Chronivac and selected Lauren. First he softened up her face which had been pretty but a tendency to look stern and hard. He made it softer and cuter while still keeping it seductive, he then lengthened her already long hair and applied it.  He made her hips slightly wider and her ass slightly fuller then decided to increase her breasts another cupsize as well and hit apply again. Ryan  leaned back continuously rubbing his shaft with his left hand while thinking. He then decided on a whim to make her slightly shorter so that her assets would look bigger but still kept her the tallest of the cheerleading girls and made sure her waist wouldn&#39;t thicken. He applied the changes without changing his own memories but changing everyone elses, he wanted the new and improved Lauren to be a surprise for him tomorrow. From the corner of his eye he could have seen  that Chronivac was at 14% before he shut it down and took his manhood in both hands again but he never consciously perceived it in his current state of arousal. Leaning back and imagining a Lauren that was even hotter than the one he had sex with before was enough to set him off almost immediately as his balls contracted and he let out a deep moan that he struggled to keep down he just in time managed to grab a jar and put it over his cock at as he came with generous amounts of cum filling the jar despite having fucked Lauren before. He really did graduate from paper napkins at this point. After cleaning up while still in a haze from his orgasm he climbed into bed with a  still hot 14 inch semi-hardon.  <br />
<br />
In the morning his manhood was back to it&#39;s normal flaccid one foot long size much to Aaron and Mike&#39;s distress as they caught him in the shower naked again. Ryan didn&#39;t even get the chance to react before they made themselves sparse. Ryan&#39;s morning ritual proceeded as normal and he managed to get to school slightly earlier than usual. He gaze around trying to find Lauren. We would now be even more easy to spot with hair almost reaching down to her buttocks. His dick throbbed in his pants already before he spotted her. She luckily was alone so Ryan headed over to her after a quick look around. He didn&#39;t see anyone he knew around. None of Aaron or Mike&#39;s friends nor any other acquaintances he knew. He greeted Lauren and gave her a quick subtle complement on her looks. &quot;Do you have anything to do after school?&quot; He asked after talking a bit about nothing in particular. Lauren frowned painfully. &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m going shopping with the girls in the next town over.&quot; With the girls she meant the other cheerleaders, Ryan gathered. Ryan said he was sorry that they couldn&#39;t spend time together and they went off doing their own business after a quick farewell. Ryan still held her image in his mind, she had looked so damn fine now he really really wanted to fuck her again but he knew he had to be patient for now. <br />
<br />
The school day went by without problems or rather there were fewer problems thanks to Ryan&#39;s recent involvement. For some reason all bullies were on their toes and acting nicer lately. Ryan however didn&#39;t care about it and was mostly oblivious to the likely temporary change. When he got home his parents weren&#39;t around yet. To his surprise Aaron and Mike stormed into his room. &quot;Ryan! is it true? Someone/Jake spotted you with Lauren, the hottest (cheerleading)girl of our school!&quot; Aaron and Mike both said in a garbled manner. Ryan turned and grinned at them. &quot;I might have.&quot; He said suggestively. Mike and Aaron both looked at each other. &quot;You can&#39;t. No way.&quot; Ryan nodded. &quot;You better not have had sex with her.&quot; Ryan smirked and looked away. &quot;No way! There&#39;s no way.&quot; Aaron said. &quot;There&#39;s no way with that monster of yours.&quot; Mike added. Ryan looked challengingly at them.&quot;She even said I gave her the most orgasms she had ever had.&quot; &quot;There&#39;s no way you could make her orgasm. I bet you can&#39;t even bottom out in her.&quot;  Ryan leaned back and said while grinning wildly. &quot;A real man can make a woman orgasm without needing to go balls deep in her.&quot; Aaron frowned and threw a piercing look his way but decided that objecting to that notion would mean admitting that he couldn&#39;t make a woman orgasm without going balls deep himself. They heard the door open downstairs and the heavy footsteps of their father. Aaron and Mike looked at each other. Aaron sneaked up to Ryan quickly followed closely by Mike. &quot;You better stop it with Lauren, Ryan, Mike and I really would prefer it.&quot; and Aaron and Mike walked off. Ryan sighed deeply at the subtle thread dropped by Aaron. Perhaps it was time to give Aaron and Mike something to get them out of his waters, so to say.</p>
