<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Secure in the office suite, they quickly dispersed to find out what they could. Mia and Eliza first dug into the strain database to find out what had altered Casey and the others. Eliza shared what she found with the rest.<br />
<br />
&#39;Laquine strain, another rare hazard rating 7. Before this there had been only one known outbreak in the world.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;infectious through bodily fluids, one hour transformation time, plump hyperendowed herm horsecocked bunny... Yeah we know that part. Oh, here we go. Classified as a hazard seven due to infected releasing a powerful mood altering drug into the air. Described as a aphrodisiac, narcotic, and euphoric effect. They are not immune to their own production and will be high for the rest of their lives. Extreme aggressive sex drive when in heat/rut, hybrid equine lapine musculature in their legs make them spectacularly powerful runners and jumpers. Rated at maximum of hazard scale due to rate of spread indoors and long term ecological impact of the excessive cum as contaminated water and soil is expected to remain infectious for years.&#39;<br />
<br />
Eliza stopped at that, they understood there would be no help from outside their group.<br />
<br />
They drifted apart, Eliza and Mia glued to work stations (thankfully hooked into the emergency backup power).<br />
<br />
A few hours in Eliza walked down to cold storage to check on the Laquine sample. She knew (to her shame) how Chrysalis escaped, but she hadn&#39;t messed with Laquine.<br />
<br />
Entering the containment area, she walked past the sample cases for the hazard 1-6 strains and swiped through the heavy security door into the ultra secure section for the sevens.<br />
<br />
This was a much smaller room, perhaps 10x10, containing locked steel sample cabinets. At the rear was a wall safe, to which even Mia/Eliza did not have access. It contained the classified strains that the CDC did not openly admit existed. Only Director Harris had the safe combination. <br />
<br />
Eliza saw two impossible things as she entered. Somehow Angela had gain access, and even more alarming, she had opened the safe.<br />
<br />
&#39;Angela! Stop, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing! Those are insanely dangerous.&#39;<br />
<br />
Angela turned.<br />
<br />
&#39;Poor timing, I had hoped to do this uninterrupted.&#39; Her hand rose into view, wielding the pistol that had been with the torn police uniform back at Mia&#39;s apartment. Angela must have acquired it when no one was watching.<br />
<br />
&#39;I do feel bad for you and Mia, you have no idea the game in which you were pawns.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I loved going drinking with you and your Pride buddies. But I especially loved the stories you&#39;d tell when hammered, of the crazy viruses the CDC covered up. It stopped being entertainment the night you told me about one of the classified strains, Siren. Instant supervillain you described it. Gives the ability to control others with their voice, as well as a overwhelming urge to do so.&#39;<br />
<br />
Angela held up a silver pendent. Eliza couldn&#39;t remember seeing it before, but at the same time it seemed as familiar as her name.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ive always had a big thing for hypnosis, so once I knew about Siren I needed it. So my pendent and I had many nice nights where you spilled absolutely everything you knew. My plan to get Siren became your plan to be human again. I cultured your narcissism and vanity, building up your rejection of your perfect new Pride life. With my orders buried at the bottom of your mind, you didn&#39;t even question unleashing something as dangerous as Chrysalis.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;The fission into two people was a surprise, but Chrysalis turns you into your ideal feminine futa self. I think the self love and obsession I built in you made it so you split so you really could love yourself literally.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t feel bad, I manipulated my brother too. I needed him as cover for tagging along with you as you acted out my subliminal script.&#39;<br />
<br />
She raised her voice. &#39;Marcus pet, restrain her.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes mistress&#39;<br />
<br />
Eliza felt huge paws grab her from behind.<br />
<br />
&#39;Marcus and I had hours of quality time last night. After his transformation he was oh so mentally pliable. I hadn&#39;t expected a big kitty slave, but I have fun plans for him now.&#39;<br />
<br />
Angela pulled a vial out of the safe. &#39;Siren, at last!&#39; and drank it.<br />
<br />
Her throat clenched, and she fell to her knees. Gasping unable to breathe, her neck pulsed and the flesh under her skin writhed like a bundle of snakes. <br />
<br />
With a cough, it subsided, leaving no external sign. <br />
<br />
&#39;Release her&#39;.<br />
<br />
Eliza felt a jolt roll down her spine and a tingle in her pussy. Angela&#39;s voice was enchanting, purer than a thousand silver bells but sensual enough to arouse her with two words.<br />
<br />
&#39;Strip and come here Eliza. You get to complete me.&#39; <br />
<br />
Angela stripped herself as Eliza approached, erect cock leading the way.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m the one who told you to use Chrysalis with Herm-F. I&#39;m going to create a new world; one of without discrimination by beauty, gender, or sexual orientation, as everyone will be a hot futa who wants to fuck other hot futas. And I will be the queen. It has been such a tease waiting to change, but I knew you&#39;d never let me near this place otherwise.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Did you even wonder why all the transformed are driven to infect others but not you? Because your subconscious knew that doing my bidding was the greatest thing you could do to make this a pandemic.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Now fuck me.&#39;<br />
<br />
Eliza pushed Angela back against the wall and penetrated the madwoman&#39;s dripping sex. She hammered the aspiring villain&#39;s cunt, bouncing their bodies on the cold hard wall. Eliza&#39;s head rolled back, overwhelmed by the combined pleasure of fucking and obeying that enchanting voice.<br />
<br />
Angela felt it building inside her, not just orgasm but her pending rebirth. With every thrust her skin felt tighter. With a wet pop, her new cock tore free. She moaned as its sensitive flesh was pinned between their rutting bodies.<br />
<br />
Everything felt compressed, her ideal herm self was not a slender ballerina. Her chest tore like wet cardboard as huge pale tits bloomed underneath. Her legs split like a cheap pair of jeans as her thighs swelled. Eliza pumped relentlessly, lost in bliss and the sensation of Angela&#39;s changing body and the heat radiating from her.<br />
<br />
Angela flexed her body as she climaxed, bursting the remnants of her old self. Her face fell away as two toned red and black hair cascaded downward.<br />
<br />
Eliza hadn&#39;t slowed her pace, still obeying the command she had received.<br />
<br />
&#39;Cum for me&#39;.<br />
<br />
Eliza exploded, her body straining to push out every last drop she could. <br />
<br />
They slid down the wall.<br />
<br />
Angela looked far from angelic. Ass length straight black hair with red forelocks falling down both sides of her face. Her skin was porcelain white. Lips were plump and deep red, her eyes also red with slit pupils. <br />
<br />
She now dwarfed Eliza, she would be six and a half feet tall standing and thick with muscle. Her tits stood proudly, probably a H cup. Her cock stood proudly I&#39;m front of her defined abs it&#39;s tip just past her navel - easily a foot long.<br />
<br />
&#39;Marcus pet, your turn. Are you ready to become my perfect servant?&#39;</p>
