<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Human life?&quot; Prince River questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh…&quot; Damon said to herself as she realized what she&#39;d just done. She sighed and decided to tell Prince River a bit more about herself. &quot;River. I have to tell you something.&quot;<br />
<br />
The merman swam and laid himself to Damon&#39;s side. &quot;What is it, Dana? You can tell me anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon didn&#39;t want to reveal to her lover that she was once a man, but she knew at least to be honest about her land-filled past. <br />
<br />
&quot;The truth is, my prince… That I wasn&#39;t always a wandering mermaid. In fact, I was once a human woman living on the land.&quot; Damon said.<br />
<br />
Prince River&#39;s blue eyes widened a little. &quot;A human... But how? You&#39;re a mermaid, not one of those dirt treaders.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon let out another sigh. &quot;After I was broken up from a relationship, I found a lamp in my apartment. The lamp was the home of a genie.&quot; Damon raised up her fish tail. &quot;As you can see, I used my first wish to become a mermaid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Prince River&#39;s expression softened. &quot;Oh, well that makes sense. I&#39;m very aware of genies, but I often see humans using their wishes for their foolish and selfish greed, not to become merfolk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon nodded. &quot;I know… I honestly just wanted to become a mermaid to improve my life. I even included a power to transform consenting humans into merfolk with my wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Prince River smiled at that. &quot;I appreciate you using such a valuable wish to join my people. I may be biased, but I think your wish was a very wise one. Do you enjoy being a mermaid than a human?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon eagerly nodded. &quot;I do. Being a human with a broken heart was such a pain but being a mermaid with you is simply a dream I couldn&#39;t ever imagine.&quot;<br />
<br />
The smile on Prince River&#39;s face became warmer. &quot;In retrospect, I probably should&#39;ve suspected that you&#39;d be a former human. Only a dirt treader would be stupid enough to break up with someone beautiful like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
A melodic laugh emerged from Damon as she heard the merprince&#39;s words. &quot;Tell me about it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Prince River joined in with laughter as well as he playfully hugged Damon&#39;s body and kissed her all around her neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha! Stop it, stop it!&quot; Damon giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that? You want more? Okay, princess!&quot; Prince River replied as he continued his kissing.<br />
<br />
Damon moaned as she enjoyed the soft feeling of River&#39;s lips on her delicate neck. She playfully tried to push River&#39;s body away but she couldn&#39;t push her fingers against the merprince&#39;s strong chest - He naturally resisted Damon&#39;s pushes. Damon also tried to push her red tail against River&#39;s but the merprince&#39;s muscular blue tail was easily able to coil around Damon&#39;s tail. The mermaid was now completely under Prince River&#39;s mercy.<br />
<br />
When Prince River finally let his lips go from Damon&#39;s neck, the couple noticed Prince River was now directly on top of Damon. River grinned at his dominance and Damon sighed as she was catching her breath - Her gills were pulsing rapidly.<br />
<br />
Damon slowly relaxed until she looked down at her body. Her eyes noticed her exposed vagina nestled cleanly within where the her scales joined with her skin. Damon gasped a little as she eyed her glistening womanhood, it looked beautiful, but she let out a louder gasp as she looked up and saw Prince River&#39;s penis.<br />
<br />
Damon was once a human male who enjoyed pornography, so she knew what a penis and vagina looked like but Prince River&#39;s manhood was different. For starters, it was much longer than the average human dick. Second of all, River&#39;s penis was covered in beautiful blue scales. Third, his penis had small soft fins protruding from the sides, making it seem like a sea creature. Finally, his penis wasn&#39;t even fully erect, it was still inching towards Damon&#39;s damp slit without the merman needing to move forward.<br />
<br />
Prince River looked at Damon&#39;s face and spoke. &quot;Contrary to what you might think, I&#39;m actually a very conservative merman. I never touched myself and I never masterbated. I&#39;ve met many mermaids before that have tried to win me over, but none have ever aroused anything out of me… Until now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon&#39;s mouth opened as her eyes widened &quot;But… That means…&quot; <br />
<br />
River pointed to his penis. &quot;Yup, this is my first time seeing my little guy out and about like this. Do you like what you see, Dana?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I certainly like what I see.&quot; Damon replied confidently but the mermaid&#39;s confidence was soon replaced by bashfulness as she looked at her delicate vagina. &quot;The real question is… Do you like what you see. River?&quot;<br />
<br />
The merprince smiled and the soft fins on his manhood flapped eagerly as he replied to his lover&#39;s question. &quot;Of course I do, Dana. It&#39;s such a lovely little thing. I&#39;d be honored if you let my knight enter the castle, if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
River&#39;s penis was fully erect, the tip of his organ now barely touching the mermaid&#39;s slit.<br />
<br />
Damon grinned. &quot;Do your worst, merprince.&quot;<br />
<br />
Almost immediately as the words left her mouth, River&#39;s penis penetrated Damon&#39;s vagina.<br />
<br />
Damon let out a gasp that was quickly stopped as River&#39;s mouth crashed into hers. Damon could only moan as she was overwhelmed by pleasure.<br />
<br />
Quickly, Damon was starting to get into the high energy of the lovemaking. As the couple ate each other&#39;s faces, Damon ran her fingers through his short blonde hair. In return, Prince River ran his fingers on Damon&#39;s long blonde hair.<br />
<br />
Damon started to stroke River&#39;s blue tail, scaly as a real fish but muscular like a human. River moaned in pleasure as he returned the favor and stroked where Damon&#39;s skin smoothly transitioned to her scales.<br />
<br />
Prince River let his arms go from Damon, only for one of his hands to grab her breasts while the other stroked Damon&#39;s belly. The merprince humped harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha! Mmmn. God yes. Ohh. Y–Yes. You—ahn!—are perfect!&quot; Damon cried out as she laughed in pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me your king, Dana. Call me the king of the ocean!&quot; Prince River said smugly.<br />
<br />
Damon struggled to fight against her laughter, but she finally made a reply. &quot;Okay, okay! You are —ahn!—my king. You&#39;re the—mmph—the king of the ocean. My ocean.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, River allowed himself to climax and, for the first time, he felt something hot and sticky race up the length of his cock and into Damon&#39;s vagina - officially taking her virginity. <br />
<br />
The lovers shared a large moan of pure pleasure as River fell on his bed and the couple took deep breaths, processing what they had just done as their sex organs were hidden once again by their tails.<br />
<br />
River and Damon lovingly looked at each other in the eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;You were amazing, Dana.&quot; Prince River whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So were you, River. Thank you for making me feel at home under the sea. In fact, I don&#39;t really miss my human life anymore.&quot; Damon replied.<br />
<br />
The merman warmly smiled and hugged his mermaid lover. &quot;You&#39;re welcome, Dana. Welcome home.&quot;</p>
