<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Carla was presenting to a confused Anna, most of the group were suppressing giggles or flat out laughing.  Mark walked up to the two ladies and put a hand on each of them.  “Come on honey, don’t scare off these two too.”<br />
<br />
Carla straightened and had her bikini pieces vaguely providing coverage when she turned around, “Sorry.  Mark says I’ve already embraced the animal lifestyle too much.  Not that he complains at night.”<br />
<br />
Mark blushed at that last comment, “So, Anna, David, want to join us for lunch?  We know a good place on the way out to the farms.  Loser buys, that’s the real prize.”<br />
<br />
Carla put her hands on her hips, “Well, I see how it is.”  That made Mark blush harder.<br />
<br />
“That sounds nice,” Anna said, “just let us get dried and dressed.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good, we’ll go do the same and meet you by the road.” Mark said, and the two groups parted ways.<br />
<br />
Back at their towels, David asked Anna, “So what were you going to do if Carla had been serious?” as they dried off.<br />
<br />
“I think she was serious.” Anna said, blushing.  “But I know what you mean, probably just stand there weirded out.  You and I are one thing, but a stranger…”  She hurriedly pulled on her dress, trying to hide the blush.<br />
<br />
“I know what you mean.” David said.  He took a moment to inspect his genitals, before putting on his shorts.  His balls were the same big, black donkey balls they were earlier and he guessed they were done changing.  But his cock, that looked bigger, thicker and longer.  Not much, but enough to make him hope.<br />
<br />
Anna was gathering up their things as David tossed on his t-shirt and the two headed to the meetup spot.  As they neared the waiting group, David grinned and whispered to Anna, “We won’t need toys tonight.”<br />
<br />
That got a gasp out of her.<br />
<br />
The others were close enough to catch the gasp and tried to suppress their amusement.  David, however, was busy adjusting to the sight.  Most of them were dressed comfortably like he and Anna, Mark wearing a baseball cap too.  Beside him was Paul, still in just his damp swim trunks.  Rich and Joan, however, were the big sights, apparently comfortable in their hair and fur, respectively, and ready to go all naturally.<br />
<br />
“Oh, um, are you really ready to go?” Anna asked.<br />
<br />
“Yea, why?” Joan asked, “Oh right, well it’s not like we’re the only ones in the city going out nude.  Besides, the fur is itchy and scratchy.”<br />
<br />
“Sure, sure.” Anna said.  She and David faded into the background as they all waited on a cab.  The cab that came was surprisingly roomy and fit everyone comfortably.  Someone in the group said it was to accommodate people who were bigger because of the changes.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The cab pulled up to a place called the Hay Barrel.  “Bout time we made it, the hotel can’t beat the food here!” Carl said as the first one out of the cab.<br />
<br />
“So is it all vegetarian?” Anna asked, “Because I still like—“<br />
<br />
“No, you can get whatever.” Carla answered, “I recommend the burgers.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t know why though, the salad and vegetables are unbeatable.” Carl say, holding the restaurant door for everyone.  “Eight please.” Carl called to the young host before he could ask.<br />
<br />
Silently, the host led them to a table in the rustic styled restaurant.  It reminded David of an actual barn crossed with one of those fancy places that tries too hard to look rustic with the burlap and rough wood.  Still, it smelled like the food was as great as Carl said.<br />
<br />
The waiter placed down their menus and left them to it.  The others helped Anna and David decide by the time the waiter came.  Anna, Carla, Mark, and Paul ordered burgers while the rest had salads and fixed veggies.<br />
<br />
“So why did everyone come?” David asked, unable to hold the question any longer.<br />
<br />
Mark was the one to speak up, “College gap year.  Most of us are going to be seniors and we decided that coming here would let us have some fun and then earn a good chunk of money for tuition and loans.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, smart, my parent’s would have come and locked me in my dorm for just mentioning such a plan.” Anna said, “So you’ve all signed up for heavy labor and stuff once your transformations are done?”<br />
<br />
“Signed up for everything.” Rich said.<br />
<br />
“Well not everything.” Joan cut in, “Carla and I said there was no way we’d do a pregnancy for any amount of money.”<br />
<br />
“Well, not any amount.” Carla muttered.<br />
<br />
“But you all are so..” Anna started but paused, unsure how to describe it, “your progress is all over the place.”<br />
<br />
That got some laughs.  They noted Mark, Carla, Carl, and Rich all had deeper, rougher laughs with some brays mixed in there.<br />
<br />
“We weren’t all lucky enough to come together.  Some of us have been here longer.” Joan said.<br />
<br />
“What about you two?” Mark asked.<br />
<br />
Anna answered before David could, “Just trying to have some fun together.”  David nodded, realizing she didn’t want to get personal right now.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, the food came before anyone could pry.  To Carl’s credit, they were as good to David as suggested.  While they were eating, David noticed Mark without his hat and how the line of hair up his back and neck formed a small ridge or mohawk in his hair.  It was easy to tell where the natural ended and the city’s influence began, as the line of hair was more like a rust-brown color than the rest of the red hair.<br />
<br />
As everyone was finishing their food, Rich asked, “So got any plans for the afternoon?”<br />
<br />
“The lake had been our only plan for the day.” Anna said.<br />
<br />
“Cool, want to come with us out to the farms?” Rich asked, “We’re going to get Paul some new shoes and you you haven’t seen them yet, it’s a good idea to visit the farms.”<br />
<br />
“But…shoes, why?” David blurted out, “I mean, he already…” and jerked as he started to look under the table but stopped himself.<br />
<br />
Paul smiled and clomped one of his hooves on the floor a couple of times, “Horseshoes.  They recommend getting them as soon as the hooves finish developing.”<br />
<br />
Anna answered before David could pull himself together, “That sounds fun, thanks.”<br />
<br />
When they were finished, David excused himself to the restroom.  While emptying, he noted that his cock was definitely bigger.  And beyond that, his tool was darker with pink blotches along the shaft, faint, but the color starting to come in.  As he finished and stuffed his cock back in his shorts, David noticed the head was bigger compared to the shaft, and flatter too.  After washing his hands, he took a moment to admire the monster bulge in his shorts.<br />
<br />
When he returned to the group, David smirked as he noted that none of the other guys’ bulges compared to his.  Or Carl’s proudly exposed equipment.  With that happy thought, the group headed for the farms on the edge of the city.</p>
