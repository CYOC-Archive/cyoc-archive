<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drake changed:<br />
<br />
His chest grew to massive beach ball sized pecs but not fat there wasn&#39;t an ounce of fat on him. They were large and firm pecs punctuated by a nipple the size of plate.<br />
<br />
His waist reduced down to a size 38. He wasn&#39;t fat before but this gave him that V shape that no one had.<br />
<br />
From his now massive chest to his almost diminutive waist grew abs. But not a six pack. You could see every strand of muscle poking out as though they were individual abs forming into larger bundles.<br />
<br />
His shoulders spread dangling massive arms from the ends. His arms strained the flesh at every bulge and joint ending in some massive fingers. If he had been fat they would have looked like sausages but even the muscle in his fingers grew large.<br />
<br />
His head grew thick. His neck having been swallowed in the mass that was now his chest. His chin became more chiseled and his forehead though looking more cro-magnon seemed to have grown for the soul purpose of increasing the area for his brain. He had long flowing hair, dark in nature but not particularly black or brown. He had 5-O&#39;Clock shadow which rubbed against his chest and if allowed to grow would become wisps trailing down onto his bare chest.<br />
<br />
From his small waist grew massive legs, Larger around than his waist was and almost sticking out at a 45 degree angle spreading his pelvis so that his junk could dangle free. His feet looked so large that they looked like a swimmers flippers but then such a massive body needed support and that was what these did.<br />
<br />
Drake was now the most perfect man on the face of the earth.<br />
<br />
The women were next to be altered. Every one became slim. Very slim. But there were two areas that had fat on them. The first, the most expected were their breasts. Just as Drake had beach ball breasts so did all the women. But theirs weren&#39;t firm. They were huge mounds pressed together. The other place was their ass which wrapped around giving them huge child breeding hips. That hourglass look was just what Drake wanted. Long hair. He liked blonds because they tended to be ditsy to him but just like not every blond was stupid neither was their  hair always blond. It was various shades but always that blondish look. And hyper sexual.<br />
<br />
The last change happened to the men. And Patrick noticed it in himself. His first change was his increased attraction for Drake. This didn&#39;t change him too much but the straight men in the world found themselves fantasizing about drake when they slept with their wives or lovers.<br />
<br />
The next change was that every man&#39;s body began to change. In comparison to him they were fat. This is how Drake saw every man. There were fat men that became enormous. Easily doubling their weight. People like Patrick became obese hitting somewhere in the 350 to 500 range. The muscle men lost their mass and became saggy looking more like the off season body builders that they knew but no matter how  much they worked out they never got better than this. And their off season made them look huge.<br />
<br />
Drake now how a couple dozen men, straight and gay, that would massage his massive body. They were his slaves and would do whatever he wanted to be close to him.<br />
<br />
There were many men that, although wanting to be part of that elite group of Drake servants they were left out in the world worshiping from afar. The women were similarly resigned. Drake had a harem of women that he would breed with. His massive cock wrecking them for other men and on his travels he would find women to breed with. But then his male servants were also used sexually, giving blow jobs, being fucked, even masturbating Drake, fluffing him in preparation for the women. But the women used the men as simple breeding stock after the change. Not one of them found the men attractive. They too dreamed of Drake as they lay with the fat man next to them.<br />
<br />
But Drake got bored with this life knowing that as a god he should seek to be better for this world. His children began to fill the world but he would always be the most massive, each one of his children having some of the traits of the population. Big breasted women. Fat men. But not exactly like the others.</p>
