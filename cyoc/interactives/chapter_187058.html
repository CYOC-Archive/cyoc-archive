<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some time waiting, Mika closed his eyes, sending silent prayers that it wasn´t all a fake. With closed eyes he didn´t see something came out from the wall just before his nose. And before he could open his eyes again, that something opened and sprayed him with a strong narcotic gas, letting him fall asleep instantly. Then the sleeping man was taken to a hidden room in the cellar of the factory, ready to be worked on. And, over the next few hours, three more young man, all around the same age and size as Mika, did the same as he did and were taken into the cellar workshop.<br />
<br />
When Mika woke up slowly hours later, he had no idea what had happened. He felt rather numb, and quickly noticed he couldn´t move an inch of his body. Opening his eyes didn´t help him, seeing nothing but darkness. <br />
When slowly more awareness slipped into his body, Mika took notice of a few things. There was a big plastic gag inside his mouth, pressing his tongue flat into the bottom, while it also held his lips closed rather painfully around it. Something tube-like had been forced into his nose, also feeling unpleasant to him, but kept him breathing easily.<br />
His head as a whole was held firmly in place by something hard behind it, and it seemed to held the rest of his body just as tight. His arms were bond to something warm beside his sides, his hands wrapped tight while grabbing something just as tight. <br />
He would have gasped if he could when his lower body returned to awareness. Something hard was pressed into his ass, leaving no wiggling room down there. It was also quite painful, as if it was the only point holding his body in place. Adding to that was pain from his balls, firmly pressed up by tight bindings. That resulted in his cock standing fully erect and nearly vertical up his body.<br />
His legs were pressed together, down to his feet, with felt like they were glued together as well. And just as he had guessed with the pain from his ass, his feet didn´t touch the ground below.<br />
<br />
It was a painful long time Mika just hung there in silence, not able to make any noise, before someone spoke up somewhere in front of him.<br />
“Ah, I see you are all awake now, good. I could have continued with my working on you four, but what fun is it for you if you are unaware of the proceedings?” laughing was heard afterwards.<br />
Mika became suddenly aware that he wasn´t the only person being here immobile. With a start he realized that his hands were grabbing onto other hands. What the hell was going on?<br />
<br />
Unaffected by the sudden realization of his captured young men, the unknown man, who had chatted with all off them under the name of Forever, started to work on their bodies. While their legs were tightly bound together, someone looking at them couldn´t see the individual legs. The same was true for their arms, only they were each wrapped to their neighbors’ arms tightly. <br />
But the wrapping was only temporary. It was in place to keep the limbs in position, so something he injected them now would affect it right. Each man was injected into the back of their neck from something behind them. It was the base of their new purpose, something he had to fit them too now.<br />
<br />
Mika noticed quickly how stiff his muscles became after that prick in his neck. While he had been unable to move a muscle before, he was sure without the bonds he would be able to. Now, while whatever he got injected worked through his body, they all ceased working, at least it felt like that. It only worked on his muscles, not his organs, as he could feel his heart beating even faster in his raising panic. And, unbeknownst by him, the other three men were feeling exactly the same.<br />
<br />
“You should be completely stiff by now, not able to twitch anything. Maybe you are still able to blink, but that won´t help you. Now, let´s unwrap you so I can work with your nice, naked bodies.” Again, Forever laughed as he started to unwrap the bindings on Mika´s legs. He was quick to remove them, but Mika remained completely still, just as he needed him to. Next, he moved to his right side, unwrapping Mika´s left arm, from the man next to him.<br />
Forever walked further, unwrapping said man’s legs next, and so on, until he lastly unwrapped Mika´s right arm, finishing his round. “Now a few finishing touches to you boys, and then we can work on keeping you like that forever.”<br />
With that said, Forever got something he had prepared already from a workbench right beside his captives. Mika was the first to feel something being painfully stuffed into the tip of his fully erect cock. He would have screamed in pain if he could, but no sound left him. Whatever it was, was then pressed against his cock´s side and further down between his legs, replacing a pencil-like object that had been placed between the wrapping, before he connected it to the object inside Mika´s ass. The same Forever did to the other three men.<br />
When all their cocks were connected to their holding pole, Forever next removed something from their faces, something mask-like. Underneath he could see three small glands, one slightly bigger coming from the mouth while the others came from each nostril. Now, these were connected to a tube as well, running together along their chin and around their necks, where they were connected to the holding pole as well.<br />
<br />
Mika had tried to open his eyes as the mask was removed, but the result was the same darkness as before, and he realized there must be a blindfold over his eyes, blocking all light. Luckily whatever was happening afterwards wasn´t painful, as he was in enough pain already, similar to the others.<br />
“Now, who gets to be painted first? Wouldn´t do if any of you can move after the paralyzing agent stops working, right?” After another laugh for his own comment, Forever answered his own question: “No, it wouldn´t. Let´s start in order I collected you, so Mika is first.”<br />
<br />
Mika would have screamed at the cold brush running over his body. It felt freezing cold on his naked skin. But he could do nothing while Forever coated the skin on his whole body with the cold paint. He took his time, making sure to coat any surface. The brush was able to go between Mika´s legs, even when they were tightly pressed together. He painted each toe, each finger, and even each strand of Mika´s hair with maximal accuracy, leaving nothing out. As to make it the most intense for Mika, Forever left his cock and balls for last, and beside the cold strokes of the brush, Mika felt a growing pleasure form it.<br />
<br />
After finishing Mika´s paint, Forever nodded at his work. “That´s seems perfect now. And if I left something, I´m sure the second layer will cover it later. Now it´s your turn, Peter.” While Mika felt like he was frozen solid in the paint, he already feared the second layer. “Will it get even colder?” went through his mind.<br />
After Peter followed Juan, the only man with slightly darker skin, not that it mattered. And when Juan was finished, Forever started on David.<br />
<br />
After a break were Forever ate something, all four boys felt freezing, that effect never leaving their bodies. Not that it helped when Forever returned for their second layer of paint. It felt even colder to them, surprisingly. <br />
After finishing the second layer on them all, Forever grinned at his work. “You all come along good. But as it is quite late, the third layer will have to come tomorrow. So, something to eat for you, and then you can sleep. Hope you sleep well, boys.” And he left laughing.<br />
<br />
All of the sudden something was pumped into the tubes connected to their mouths and shot through their gags, directly down their throats. They couldn´t taste it that way, and it quickly run down into their empty stomachs, stilling their hunger they hadn´t eve realized was growing. It was a freezing cold, sleepless night for all four of them afterwards. Without any sense of time, they all hung there in silence. <br />
<br />
When Forever returned the next morning, he said nothing, just started on the third layer, surprising each of the four as they hadn´t realized he was there again. Only after he finished, he finally greeted them. “Good morning. Slept good in your coating? Feel free to complain.”<br />
As much as each of the four wanted, they couldn´t make a sound. “Nothing? That´s good, as I would hate if you don´t like your new life. You see, you four are now what you ever meant to be. My new, gold-colored coat-rack Let´s give you one last look at your new predicament, before there will be darkness forever.”<br />
<br />
Mika, Peter, Juan and David all felt their hearts stop. Has he said a coat-rack? Forever slowly lifted the blindfold-like goggles from their eyes one after another, and when they finally could see in the bright light, they were all shocked. They were in a room with mirrors all around, so they could easily see themselves as well as the other three, looking like golden statues. Only a little bit around their now uncovered eyes was still skin-colored.<br />
Behind them was a big pole standing above their heads, with something like a headband connected to their heads. They couldn´t see it, but the second holding was the pole up their asses, feeling like a dildo two sizes to big. Even as they trained their eyes down, they couldn´t see what was inside their cocks now. The tubes were hidden through the paint.<br />
<br />
Before long, Forever returned, having watched them from the outside, enjoying their panic-filled eyes, their emitting fear. He didn´t put their goggles back onto their eyes. Instead, he took out some duct tape, and covered their eyes with that. Mika and the others closed their eyes on instinct as the tape came near, and the tape itself stopped their eyes from opening again. <br />
Forever pressed it tight enough that you could see the eye-shaped form, and after securing all eyes, covered them in three layers of golden paint as well, drying each with a hairdryer.<br />
<br />
When the paint was dry, Forever rolled his new coat-rack out and to its new destination in his rather big house, and enjoyed his new piece of furniture. He added some small tips to their ears and their noses, so each boy had three places to hang coat on their heads, alongside the low natural hook that were their cocks. As the whole coat-rack stood on a pedestal, even that “hook” was high enough for most coats, and also the favorite spot for most of his guests.<br />
<br />
To Mika, Peter, Juan and David, that was pure torture. Because even if with time they learned to “life” with the pain from their dildo-shaped ass-holding, any weight hanging from their kept erect cocks was absolutely painful. Even the pulling weight from something hanging on their noses or ears was nothing compared to that.<br />
<br />
And so, all four remained frozen, unable to move anything, unable to make any sounds, being tortured by being used as their new purpose, a coat-rack They were only kept alive by being forced to eat and drink whatever was pumped into their mouths and being forced to breath by the tubes in their noses. Whatever needed to leave their bodies run either through the tube in their cocks or directly out their ass into the dildo, with no one the wiser. And with only their master and owner, Forever, knowing where they were or that they were even alive, they felt truly trapped forever.</p>
