<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking ahead, a smile formed on Henry&#39;s muzzle at the sight of a rest stop at the next exit. &quot;Maybe our kits could use a break. I bet they&#39;re all pent up from sitting in the car so long.&quot; He told Linda, putting a paw hand on his thigh. &quot;I was thinking the same, too, dear! My legs and tail could use a good stretch as well. Besides, we haven&#39;t marked our trail for a while since we started this trip.&quot; Debra frantically nodded his head in agreement, his patience growing thinner as Sam was now thrusting his hips into his older brother&#39;s thigh while Rick got up from his seat and was now intentionally poking his white furry sheath against Debra&#39;s arm.<br />
<br />
The car quickly pulled into one of the parking spaces, indicating Henry&#39;s ability to do complex human actions remained, and all five male foxes spilled out of the car, their paw hands stretching above their heads, tails pulling straight back out behind them and paw feet on the tips of their paws before relaxing their whole body. The rest stop itself was one of the larger ones that included a small grassy area for people to relax on and walk any dogs, small drinking fountains and lowered spouts for cleaning, cleaner bathrooms that were maintained and even a small welcome center.<br />
<br />
Before they did anything else, their first priority was to relieve their bladders and mark their spots in doing so. The men&#39;s bathroom seemed the most occupied with only one urinal stall left, so Debra called dibs, wanting to have some time away from his annoying twin brothers, even for just a few minutes. Disappearing inside the restroom, Linda looked to see a nice looking mailbox situated just outside the welcome center receptionist window and gleefully walked over to it, readying her sheath. The twins wanted to play with the water fountain, so they went over to the combined drinking fountain and spout, the presence of both appealing to their childish wiles. And Henry opted to stay near the car, eyeing a lamppost situated right in front of the beginning pathway that lead through the grassy area.<br />
<br />
Once everyone was situated in their spots, the Eversons lifted their legs and relaxed their bodies as a warm stream of gold flowed from their sheathes. Because they were also marking their spots, the urine had a strong, musky scent to them. The rest stop wasn&#39;t crowded, but their were enough people resting outside to witness the bizarre events unfolding. Yet, like the heat radiating from their cars, the magic, too, radiated from the Eversons&#39; car. Shocked and disgusted expressions soon faded to normalcy as the magic enveloped all those in the vicinity.<br />
<br />
Linda had his paw hands resting on the mailbox as he leaned into his actions, lifting his leg proudly and relaxed. Unbeknownst to him, the tourist and the receptionist he was chatting to about the area were caught by the influence of his vulpine urine and the magic. They heard the odd sound of liquid hitting the metal box, both turning to see the source of the noise. At first, they were mortified to see a naked furry guy was urinating all over it. When the smell hit their noses, however, the feeling faded and both continued as if nothing was out of place. As the two talked, their clothes disappeared in the wind, revealing orange and white fur spreading out from their bodies. The receptionist was leaning on the counter, resting her bulbous breasts on it until they began shrinking away, leaving only a flat chest. If she was outside the center, the tourist would&#39;ve seen her genitals pushing out into a sheath and furry balls. Of course, he began naturally referring to the receptionist as if he had always been a male anthro fox as their bushy orange tails fluffed out behind them. It also didn&#39;t occur to the three male foxes that Linda&#39;s urine was also leaking into the mailbox, soaking all the envelops in his scent. <br />
<br />
The twins we&#39;re having a blast around the water fountain. They weren&#39;t the only kids around there as there were a few other boys and girls that stopped by the rest stop with their families. They all gathered around the twins, thinking they were amazing looking and brave to be naked and peeing all over the fountain. Since they thought they were so cool, none of the kids hesitated to throw off their clothes when Sam and Rick suggested a game of &#39;Naked Sheath Tag&#39; Of course, this was mainly due to the musk of their urine and the magic that also caused their clothes to fade away before they even hit the ground. As they explained how to play, the other kids were confused at what was a sheath, that is, until they grew their own furry white sheath and genitalia. The group of kids then were running around the grassy area, some with tails wagging while others had foxy ears, poking each other with their sheathes. Soon the group of kit boys were poking their furry bodies against each other.<br />
<br />
Henry was happily watching his twin kit boys having a fun time with the other kits as he continued marking the lamppost. The lamppost itself was sisituated around a group of benches that kit&#39;s families were resting at. Like the others, they two were shocked at Henry&#39;s appearance and indecency before the magic and his musk overtook them and rewrote their minds about the situation. None of them objected to him marking the post and some even grinned slyly as he did so, the urine making contact with their feet as it flowed. Soon, naked parents and relatives were showing off their bodies as well, with husbands stroking their wives&#39; furry white sheathes, uncles were making out with each other and grandparents were grooming their adult kits as their ages dropped to be just above their offspring. In the end, it didn&#39;t matter if the families weren&#39;t familiar with other families. They all shared a kinship and skinship with their fellow male vulpine.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the stalls, Debra found the empty urinal he was looking for in the middle of the row and immediately jumped to it. He quickly lifted his leg and rested it on the dividing wall, aimed and let flow his pent up tension. Of course, the scent of the warm urine did not go unnoticed by the other &#39;patrons&#39; but they were so focused on their own business, it didn&#39;t matter to them that the bathroom became dense with musk. It didn&#39;t even bother them when the penises in their hands became enveloped in extra skin and white fur. No one even cared when their pants dropped into nothingness, exposing their asses outlined with white fur and the orange fur spreading around it. In fact, they even began lifting their own legs without a second thought! If anyone else came in at that moment, they would have witnessed the strange sight of the exposed furry fox butts and tails sticking out of the urinal stalls. The ones in the toilet stalls were no exception either. The pants bunched around their ankles dissolved away, along with their shoes, leaving only their changing paw feet being covered with dark fur in view.<br />
The women&#39;s restrooms weren&#39;t immune to the effects of the musk wafting over onto their side. Reality was changing as well as the restroom walls began disappearing, leaving the restrooms wide open, revealing the women&#39;s restroom to mirror the men&#39;s with its own set of urinals and formerly female foxes occupying them. Even the signs changed, both becoming images of male anthro foxes.<br />
<br />
Soon, the Eversons were done with their business and began heading out. They said their farewells to their fellow foxes, the twins in particular whining about how they wanted to play with their kit friends a little longer. Families of foxes and vulpine travelers left one by one, leaving only the receptionist behind to close up for the night, simply hanging a closed sign off his sheath as he slept comfortably on the shifting counter as it lowered, allowing his newly grown sheath to be shown off when he works in the morning.</p>
