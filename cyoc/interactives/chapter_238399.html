<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking through his options, Jeff cause something that seems really appeasing.  And just at the right time too.  Today is Thanksgiving and it&#39;s basically tradition to spend time in the house with family and friends and have a delicious turkey.  To his family, the idea of going out to eat on Thanksgiving seems to make sense as the mother won&#39;t waste hours on end preparing for the feast.  But with restaurant costs starting to rise, it would be difficult for them to afford an affordable meal outside the house.<br />
<br />
Jeff though, he felt that it wasn&#39;t much of a Thanksgiving if they are just going out.  He wanted to be indoors and enjoying an actual Turkey dinner with the family instead of eating out.  He would do anything to leave the family in the house and that they would have a proper Thanksgiving meal.  And that&#39;s when he noticed an option of the Full Food option on the Chronivac<br />
<br />
&#39;Thanksgiving Turkey&#39;<br />
<br />
Normally, his plan would be to become a full on food product for an hour.  But looking at the turkey option, a strange thought occured to him.  Since the family never had turkey in the house, why not become a turkey for an actual Thanksgiving dinner.  Sure the warning stated that if he gets eaten while changed, he won&#39;t revert back to normal.  Meaning that he would actually die if he was devoured.  But a part of him wants his family to have Thanksgiving in the household and would do anything to get them in the house.  And since there&#39;s an option to become a turkey, that means sacrificing his life for the sake of his family.<br />
<br />
Looking at the option, he sighed and said, &quot;You know what...?  It&#39;s about time my family gets to spend Thanksgiving here and not at some expensive restaurant.  Even if it means loosing my life just for them to be happy, then so be it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at the clock, he could tell that he has to hurry.  His family will arrive at six as they were taking part in the Thanksgiving festivities in town.  And in twenty minutes, they will arrive so they can get ready to leave for a restaurant.  That&#39;s something he didn&#39;t want.  &quot;Let&#39;s see, the family will arrive soon.  If I can do it just now, I will have everything for them to spend time here.  That includes me being a turkey itself.  Better get back to work if I am to have my family stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cracking his knuckles, he looked to the computer screen and said, &quot;Let&#39;s get to work!&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly clicking on the option, a new page appeared asking for the target of the change, complete with info bars and the like.  Not to mention extra options for the change including reality, mental, awareness, etc.  Seeing all of this, he went on ahead and started to type down the information he has before accepting the changes.  Once done, he checked to make sure he didn&#39;t make any mistakes.  In info goes like this...<br />
<br />
Target Name: Jeff Kendrick<br />
Age: 16<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
IQ: 110<br />
Language: English<br />
Sex Drive: Low<br />

<br />

Aware of Changes - YES<br />
Change Clothes - YES<br />
Reality - YES<br />
Transformation Time: Fifteen Minutes<br />
Duration: Permanent<br />
Transformation Intensity: Heavy<br />
<br />
Looking through is options, Jeff smiled and knew he got everything down.  As for the alt options, he needed to say yes to everything giving that if I doesn&#39;t, it would mean that the family will be confused by where Jeff was and why there&#39;s a Turkey in the dinning room table.  Though it is weird that there is a clothing option.  After all, turkeys never need clothes.  But he has to do it anyways as he needed to fully changed experience.  Still, the thought of a well dressed Thanksgiving turkey really amuse him.  He let the transformation change be that of fifteen minutes as they will arrive in twenty.  By the time the changes are finished, they will arrive to see a proper Thanksgiving dinner and not going out to eat.  And off course, the changes need to be permanent, as he isn&#39;t planning to change back any time soon.<br />
<br />
Looking to his options, he smirked and said, &quot;Okay...  That should do it.  All the information all set and ready.  Now just need to hit the submit button and dinner will be served.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clicking on the submit button, a warning window started to appear in front of him.  It reads...<br />
<br />
‘Warning: You are about to be transformed permanently.  By agreeing to be changed, Chronivac Technology isn’t responsible for damage and/or death of the target.  Do you wish to continue?’<br />
<br />
There is a yes or no option, stating if he wishes to change or not.  Jeff looked to the message and knew what they were saying.  This is a permanent change and if he gets devoured, it wouldn&#39;t matter as he wishes to remain a turkey and get eaten.  But he needed to get this done, otherwise the family won&#39;t spend an actual Thanksgiving in the house.  With that, he shrugged and said, &quot;Of course I want to continue.  This is the only shot for my family to have Thanksgiving here and not some expensive restaurant.  They need to understand what Thanksgiving is all about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hovering over on the Yes option, he smiled and said, &quot;Time to Gobble...&quot;  By clicking on it, another message appeared and it says...<br />
<br />
‘Thank you for choosing the Chronivac 4.0.  We hope you will enjoy your new transformed self.’<br />
<br />
As soon as the message was made, Jeff felt a tingle and realized what it was.  &quot;Hmph...  Looks like the changes are starting.  I am feeling compelled to head downstairs though.  Might as well...&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he could leave, he felt his room shimmering.  Getting up, he turned to see his own bedroom shifting and shaping.  Discarded clothes and objects breaking apart and deteriorating.  Posters on his wall peeling and tearing off.  Furniture moving around and reorganizing itself.  It is like he is witnessing his room morphing before his eyes.  In a few moments, what was once his room became nothing more then a guest bedroom with is rarely touched, the only thing that hasn&#39;t changed is his computer on the study desk that was running the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Starring at it, he was amazed that it changed really quick.  &quot;Whoa!  Didn&#39;t see that coming.  Guess reality is altering to the point I don&#39;t exist.  Meaning by the time my family arrives, they won&#39;t remember that they have a middle child.  Kind of makes me wonder what else it can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
He soon get&#39;s his answer as he was feeling a bit of a draft.  Looking down, Jeff noticed that is clothing is deteriorating before his eyes.  The laces of his sneakers begin to untie themselves until they grow smaller, going through the holes until they vanished completely.  Then the stitches unstitch themselves and the soles around his feet curled up and exposed his socks, sinking right up into the soles.  And then the soles begin to shrink under his feet until they disappeared completely.  Once the shoes were gone, his socks were next to go at the tips unravel to expose his toes and traveling up his feet.  As soon as they were gone, the seams of his blue jeans were unraveling as well and traveled up his legs.  Reaching the top, the zipper lost it’s metal and the button grew smaller until it popped out of existence.  The belt then got affect as the buckles separated and the ring around it split and shrank while the pointer shrunk as well, vanishing completely.  The belt itself soon shrank by itself while the little holes disappeared one by one.  It spread around his waist until is disappeared into the ether.  With his pants gone, his shirt was next as the bottom seems of his waist and upper arms unravel and spread up his chest and shoulders before that too was long gone.  His watch he had one was affected as well as the hands on them shrank and sucked in while the surface of the watch crumpled and was removed.  The gears soon disappear one at a time until it was bare and the ring around it lessened from the inside and wiped away.  The leather straps of the watch soon unravel from the spot where the watch was and the buckle end did the same way as the pant’s belt, leaving his wrist armless.  The only thing that was left were the boxers he had on until it too unstitched itself and vanishes away, exposing his penis and rear.  Now Jeff stood there naked in the middle of the guest bedroom.<br />
<br />
Seeing himself in the nude, Jeff chuckled and said, &quot;Wow!  That was...weird.  Then again, I&#39;m going to be a turkey, so I don&#39;t need much of clothes.  At least my family isn&#39;t here, otherwise, it would be a bit embarrassing.  Speaking of...  Better hurry downstairs before they arrive.  No doubt I&#39;m going to be turned into a turkey real soon and I have to be at the table.  Can&#39;t keep them waiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
On instinct, he left his former room and headed down the steps to get to the dinning room table.  By the time he got down and passed the kitchen, he already smell something already at the table.  &quot;Wait...  What&#39;s that smell?  It smells...really good.&quot;  Approaching the dinning room, his eyes grew wide and discovered what was the smell.<br />
<br />
On the table, he could see that food was already prepared for the family.  All across the table, he could see mashed potatoes, salad, corn, yams, cranberry sauce, stuffing, pretty much everything necessary for a Thanksgiving dinner.  Looking on, he was in awe as the site of it.  &quot;Damn!  Check out this spread!  Almost like someone did Thanksgiving dinner for the family.  All that&#39;s missing is the turkey itself.&quot;  Looking at the middle of the table, he noticed a silver plate with lettuce and fruit around the border.  Looking at it, he knew what&#39;s that for.  &quot;Hmm...  I take it that&#39;s my plate huh?  Guess so.  Better get on it before my family arrives.&quot;  Approaching the table, he climbed on it and crawled to his plate, being careful not to hit any of the other dishes.  Getting to the silver dish, he went on his back and looked up to the ceiling, positioning himself like that of a turkey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now all that&#39;s left is to become the turkey.  Hmm...  Wonder when it will start?  Hopefully soon.  The last thing I want is my family seeing a naked teen boy in the middle of the table waiting to be ea- oh!&quot;  He soon cut himself off as he felt a little flustered.  He was soon getting turned on as his body temperature was rising.  &quot;Oh...  What&#39;s this feeling?  I feel so...turned on...&quot;<br />
<br />
As he was feeling it, his dick started to lift itself up and was starting to get erect.  On instinct, he immediately placed his hand on the rod and started to pump on it hard.  Jeff bit his lip and was breathing heavily.  He continues to jack harder and harder until it exploded like a volcano.  But instead of cum, instead it looked like some some of golden brown liquid that was coming out of his dick and down his privates and across his body, reaching down to his hands and feet.  The substance then went up to his neck reached his face. When the substance got on his lips and went into his mouth, he tasted it and realized what it was.  It was a buttery glazed that was meant to cover the turkey to make it super tasty.  Licking his lips, he tasted herself and was getting more turned on then before.  &quot;Mmm...  This is so tasty.  I didn&#39;t think that my dick can produce some tasty butter.  I wonder how my family will think when they get a bite at me.  Mmm...  So good...  I can&#39;t stop...tasting myself...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff could feel himself getting weaker and light headed as he could feel the changes on his body.  Meaning that he will soon become a turkey for my family to be eaten.<br />
<br />
As his body was trembling and quivering, the actual changes were taking place.  First, the toes on his feet started to merge together and become a huge stub.  Then his feet shrank down his legs and formed two bumps at the end while the thighs started to expand and become extremely meaty.  Then the finger shrank followed by his hands as the numbs went down his arms and became pointy while the arms themselves were cracking and shifting, becoming a pair of featherless wings.  In his body, all of his organs were melting as the bones were shifting to match that of a turkey while anything vital like a heart, lungs, and kidneys blended into what is breaded stuffing.  His body itself started to bloat as his stomach exploded in fat and his hips compressed.  Pretty soon, Jeff&#39;s body was that of a roasted turkey with his head is the only human thing left.<br />
<br />
But Jeff didn&#39;t mind as he was in pure bliss as his transformed body was heightening his pleasure. Jeff&#39;s mind was going away, as memories, knowledge, and dreams were draining away. In fact, Jeff was thinking about the one thing and one thing only.  &quot;Yes...  That&#39;s the spot...  Make me delicious...  Make me a turkey my family will love to eat...  Make me the turkey perfect for Thanksgiving...&quot;  That&#39;s the last thing he said as his head was making the biggest of change.<br />
<br />
Slowly, his head was shrinking into his neck as his features are slowly melting away.  Eyes glazing over and popped away.  Nose getting smaller and the nostrils sealing themselves.  Ears shrinking away and concealing the holes.  Lips deflating and mouth zipping up.  Even the hair on his head shrinking away and until her head was bald.  Jeff was now a featureless head that was shrinking away.  All of his sense were shut down with the only sense he felt is the sense of feel.  Even his awareness was wiped out as well he believed, even without a head, he was a turkey that wants to be eaten.  Once the head finished shrinking, the only thing left is a the neck hole.<br />
<br />
As soon as Jeff became a Turkey, it grew smaller, becoming an actual size of a regular turkey.  In fifteen minutes, Jeff became nothing more then a thanksgiving turkey, waiting to be eaten.  The last thought he had thought is...<br />
<br />
&#39;Eat me...&#39;<br />
<br />
Now the turkey rest in the middle of the dining room table with sides around it, waiting for the family to come and eat it.  Jeff knows that despite sacrificing his life for his family to spend Thanksgiving at home, he knew that deep down, it will be worth it.</p>
