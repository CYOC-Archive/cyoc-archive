<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was able to get a very general sense of what was going on, they were outside for a moment then in the car. The radio was playing and his dad was singing to a song.  Dad repositioned in his seat or was bouncing to a song which turned Jeff on. A moment later as his dad noticed what was happening he repositioned Jeffs fabric cock so it couldnt penetrate. <br />
<br />
Jeff was programmed to not be able to cum unless inside his dad as that was the youthening agent he sought. Jeff&#39;s dad continued doing whatever it was he was doing which drove Jeff mad with the need to orgasm. Dads sexual punishment. Damn him. <br />
<br />
Jeff lost his sense of time, overwhelmed by lust and only having the faintest sense of what was going on. They had gotten to work and had been there a while, the lust had burned everything else out of Jeff&#39;s brain. Finally his dad let him in and he was able to get off, it was magnificent. <br />
<br />
Jeff now able to think straight, noticed that he could sense things again. Either his dad was intentionally letting him in or he had become distracted by the day and the telepathic, proverbial. door, had swung open of its own accord. <br />
<br />
Jeff quietly paid attention, not wanting to alert his father if it was an accident. Getting a sense of the time it was nearly noon. Jeff spent half the day in a lustful pit, unable to sate himself or think of anything else. Released from his solitude, Jeff began connecting with his dad&#39;s emotions, he could taste the coffee coming out of his dad&#39;s pores, he could sense his dad&#39;s nervousness and with concentration he could hear the conversation going on!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Marc!&quot; Jeff&#39;s dad called.<br />
<br />
Marc turned, smiled and raised his eyebrows, waiting for Jeff&#39;s dad to continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was hoping we could go grab lunch together, and get to know each other better in an &#39;outside work&#39; sorta way.&quot;<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t tell if his dad was trying to make a friend or actually initiate dating, but secretly he hoped this Marc guy would just say yes so his dad would stop his tortured existence. Marc was handsome, by Jeff&#39;s estimate somewhere between mid 20s and early 30s, slightly shorter than his father and by his build, has previously been in sports or worked out. He had perfect teeth and short, dirty blonde hair. He looked like he could be a model with his heavy stubble and piercing blue eyes. Jeff could understand why his father found him attractive, gay or straight, this man was disgustingly gorgeous. <br />
<br />
Marc took a deep sigh and looked sideways, seeming to deliberate. Jeff noticed that even his profile exuded strength and charisma. A second later he looked Jeff and his dad (since they shared the same perspective) straight in the eyes and put a hand on his shoulder, &quot;Last week, when I commented that you are funny and remind me of my uncle, I was trying to say it was that goofy cross generational humor and I can barely relate to you, You are a nice enough guy and I know you mean well but I feel our relationship is best left as strictly professional. As I understand it, I am much closer to your son&#39;s age than yours.&quot; Marc bit his lower lip, tilting his head down slightly, then he looked up with his eyes causing his forehead to crinkle and exuding innocent, puppy dog like sadness. &quot; Maybe if things were different... but they&#39;re not, I hope you understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff could sense how strongly his dad wanted to kiss this man, he had a mesmerizing cadence and gait. His whole presence lulled you into thinking he was the most charming thing you&#39;ve ever seen. Jeff&#39;s dad took a deep breath, &quot;Yeah, I think I do understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marc turned and walked away, Jeff&#39;s dad stared after him for a moment and then went back to his desk pulling out his laptop and began typing while the rest of the office was at lunch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, I saw the whole thing, I know that must have hurt, I&#39;m sorry it didn&#39;t work out as you had hoped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate that son, and I&#39;ve been thinking about what you&#39;ve said. I have come to the conclusion that you are right, it would be selfish of me to abandon your mother and brother without someone to replace the spot I fill in the family. Even making it an old wound by having me have left before your brothers birth would mess the family up in other ways. I realize that you don&#39;t want to be in the position you are in and I know you don&#39;t understand why I did this to you, but there is a reason. You see, you always did take after your mother and thats why we butt heads so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff barely noticed that his vision blurred, his dad&#39;s  constant tele talking must be using all the telepathic bandwidth so to speak, Jeff was completely engaged in the conversation though, surprised his father was able to admit wrongdoing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I live today, you and she live in the tomorrow. When we were younger she loved my spontaneity, but when you came along, fun and last minute changes caused her grief without end. I am wired to get it mostly right and then go back and change things once I see how it works, you and she are wired to consider every possibility, pick the best one, and ride it out. The world needs both kinds of people, but we don&#39;t mix well for long. There, done.&quot; <br />
<br />
With that he clicked something on the keyboard and as the haze over his vision cleared Jeff understood his father was blocking his ability to see him update the Chronivac program.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?&quot;, Jeff asked nervously as a warm tingling enveloped him. almost immediately an erection formed and he found his cozy spot in his dad&#39;s butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;A few things,&quot; Dad said as he rocked back and forth further stimulating them both. &quot;You were right that I am not the type of person to want to wait 6 months to get what I want. I made you more willing to take one for the team so to speak, if everyone but you benefits, you are willing to accept a bad hand. I made us both more horny and quicker to recharge. I doubled the youth you give to me and I added that when I cum into you, I give you two weeks of my age. From now on, we will both cum at the same time. So when we cum, I get a month younger and you get a month older. When you are old enough you will begin thinking of me as a brother then when I am young enough, I will release you to take my place as husband and father. You are the mature one, you will become the mature man she and your brother. err, son deserve.&quot;<br />
<br />
The terror of being forced become something completely new, the excitement of knowing he will be human again, and the physical stimulation all culminated into a gigantic orgasm that he and his father shared simultaneously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad thAts NOt rIght&quot;, Jeffs voice cracked and he felt hot with embarrassment and horny again craving more of his fathers aging seed. &quot;You should just make yourself straight, I meAn what if I wAnt my own kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont worry Jeff, Ill make both of them a little younger so you can continue the family if you want, nobody will realize what&#39;s going on and you will be completely hetero and happy&quot;</p>
