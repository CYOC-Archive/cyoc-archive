<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This chapter got a bit away from me, would be thankful for some feedback.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was pretty creepy that the shopkeeper knew Adrien’s name, but not nearly as creepy as him knowing what Adrien wanted. In fact, Adrien realized that this alleged skin was exactly what could make his fantasies a reality.<br />
<br />
Of course, Adrien hadn’t dreamed about becoming a real-life succubus. That would be oddly specific. However, his father had turned to religion a few years ago and had forced his son to attend certain sermons. His dad’s church was weird, telling boys that secular women were tempresses without morals and that their only goal in life was to corrupt the pure and faithful. Adrien didn’t know what the girls were told, but it was probably something very similar.<br />
<br />
Now, the young man had already been too old to believe such rubbish, but it had fuelled his imagination. First he had masturbated to the idea of being ‘tempted and corrupted’ by whatever hot girl or woman had his attention. Then, slowly but surely the idea of turning into such a woman himself wormed itself into Adrien’s mind. It was a basically impossible fantasy, of course, as changing one&#39;s gender was hardly a trivial matter. That’s why he wasn’t into cross-dressing. It wasn’t the real deal.<br />
<br />
And yet, here in his hands was a way to allegedly turn into a succubus, what might be the most outright predatory and sexual female being Adrien knew of.<br />
<br />
If it was true. <br />
<br />
“I want to try this skin,” he said and closed the box again.<br />
<br />
“Ah, a youth after my own heart,” the shopkeeper answered and clapped him congratulatory on his shoulder, “smart and decisive! Just this way, my young friend.”<br />
<br />
Adrien was led a room. It had a large mirror, comfortable chairs and an elaborate coat rack, like a changing room should have. It also had a humongous sofa, a few shelves and drawers and a stylish coffee table. This was more like a nice living room than the cramped booth he had expected.<br />
<br />
“Enjoy yourself and come out once you made your decision, with or without the skin on,” the shopkeeper wistfully shouts after he closes the door.<br />
<br />
Immediately, the blond locked the door and started to strip, dividing his clothes between the coat rack and a chair. Within moments he was naked and opened the box once more. This time the eyes only briefly gleamed and Adrien lifted the head out of the wooden container. It wasn’t connected to the main body and ended at the beginning of the neck. He had never touched softer skin than this and the lips were even more alluring. The long blonde hair was like flowing silk and the purple horns somehow didn’t make the head any less beautiful. For a second, Adrien considered starting with the mask, but then decided against it.<br />
<br />
He put the head on top of his clothes and took out the main body. It felt as nice as the head and Adrien let his hands run across its surface for a bit. Then he took a closer look at it.<br />
<br />
It looked like a basic female body. Normal feet, albeit with crimson nails, long legs, inviting hips with a nice ass - judging purely by its deflated state - a slightly toned upper body, regular hands with red nails and what must be nice breasts once no longer hollow. How Adrien would fill them was beyond him. It wasn’t tall, but he was quite short for a guy anyway so it should work out.<br />
<br />
There were, however, unnatural features.<br />
<br />
First and foremost was the pink color of the skin. It wasn’t a natural shade in the least. Next was the thin, spade-tipped tail, which had a slightly darker hue. The entire body was also utterly hairless and the nipples and vagina had a more magenta coloring. It also had a distinct smell of fresh lavender to it that was both soothing and inviting. <br />
<br />
He quickly noticed that the back could be pulled apart, with the body splitting from the neck down to slightly above the tail. The second the blonde had opened the body, the scent got stronger. The inside had the same magenta shade as the genitals and was glistening from moisture, moisture that would hopefully help putting it on.<br />
<br />
Just as Adrien was inserting his right foot into the opening, another surprise startled him. The flesh of body started to move and to grow thin tendrils, eagerly grasping for his foot. Creeped out, the teenager stopped entering and prepared to fight against the tendrils, but they weren’t at all forcefull. It quickly became apparent that the body was just helping him along and not forcing itself onto him.<br />
<br />
With the tendrils’ guidance his foot all but flowed into the corresponding appendage, the slimy inside offering no resistance. Within seconds, Adrien’s entire right leg was covered by pink skin. The left leg immediately followed and once it, too, was entirely inside, he could feel the succubus skin tighten and take on its proper shape.<br />
<br />
Adrien got up onto his new legs, tendrils from the skin’s interior reaching out and eagerly awaiting the rest of his body. His new pink skinned legs looked very much like they belonged to a model and not to a short, albeit athletic guy. He wiggled his toes and the dainty, feminine feet followed suit, the crimson nails even glittering in the light of the room.<br />
<br />
Happy that this skin seemed to work as advertised, the blond continued. As he pulled the skin further up, the tendrils went back to work. First they enveloped his erect dick and pulled him into the vagina. Worried that his rod would be poking out of the skin he pushed it aside to take a look, but only saw the pink and magenta folds sitting quite snugly against his crotch. Next he could feel them probing and then penetrating his ass. Adrien jerked from the strange sensation, and prepared for pain. Pain that never appeared. Instead, there was a pleasant feeling of fullness, which faded as the skin’s hips covered his. <br />
<br />
Like with his legs, the young man’s senses quickly translated to his new form and he felt his new and firm butt, along with his now wider hips. And as the feeling of penetration in his ass disappeared a new sensation appeared. The tail was a pain to control, but it was clearly not just a decoration. The blond was tempted to touch the vagina, but decided to continue the change.<br />
<br />
In order to pull the skin further up, Adrien worked his hands into the corresponding openings and let the tendrils work their magic. Soon, he could feel his fingers slipping into the perfectly manicured and elegant succubus counterparts. But not only that. With his hands covered, the tendrils were easily able to cover what remained of Adrien’s body with the succubus skin. In a matter of seconds, he could feel the weight of incredibly perky and firm D-Cups on his chest, while the opening behind him was slowly sealing up. <br />
<br />
Not that he cared at this point. He was too busy touching his new skin and marveling at the sensitivity and smoothness. While one dainty hand was caressing his thighs, the other was busy with his new breasts. Without thinking about it, he suddenly pinched his nipples and the electric pleasure of it caught him by surprise. His eyes rolled up, he bit his lips and even his knees got a little weak. <br />
<br />
Adrien moaned deeply before he finally got a grip and stopped feeling his new body up. The skin was nearly finished sealing and he could see in the mirror that he had indeed now the gorgeous body of this skin, curves, tits and genitals. And the intensity of it all was quite something. Even without the head, this skin was certainly special.</p>
