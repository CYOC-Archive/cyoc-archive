<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Petra quite grateful that she was finally allowed through Project Hermaphroditus. So much of the project had been tough to get into with more then enough hoops to keep track of things. Most of those that had been allowed through had been the victim of some sort of black market deal and even with those that were allowed to go through with it still hade to meet with a Doctor Jones to allow Horizon to be sure that they weren&#39;t mistaken in anything. It was mostly to make sure that those who volunteered for Project Hermaphroditus were truly transgendered and weren&#39;t just playing at something. It struck her as embarrassing, but Doctor Jones had stated that it was part of general policy and the rules that was part of Horizon company policy and what the government had managed to add hear and there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still think that a lot of this is silly,&quot; Petra commented, &quot;Especially when I won this at a drawing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the rules and regulations that are there,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke, understanding that Petra had won her selection as part of a raffle, &quot;My guess is that after the attack made by Heather &quot;Wilcox&quot; last fall, the government was doubly concerned on the combination of animal instincts and a more humanoid body. And with the present Congress and President... who have ALL campaigned on the defense of Christian values, there&#39;s also the greater regulation in the hopes that you become a rabid Christian and denounce such things as sinful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that part makes me sick,&quot; Petra practically growled.<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones nodded as he opened the door for Petra and let her walk in. A lot of the things that he&#39;d noticed with regards to how the Federal government was trying to handle Animalia seemed conflicted and times bipolar. There were plenty of attempted bills and statements that had been tried to strip Animalians or regulate the sale of Animalia Virus to the point that no one could purchase it, but nearly all of these had failed to pass. Those bills that did pass were all considered to be rather moderate. At the same time, however, there had also been some of the random tweets and comments given by those in the administration that seemed to hint on the support of Animalia as a &quot;cure for homosexuality&quot; some of the reports in the scientific reports gave an indication that those who were homosexual began to become more bisexual as the animal instinct to breed kicked in. That part, Doctor Jones was sure would make some people angry for trying to use the Animalia Virus to change people&#39;s personality and others anger them at the hypocrisy when one considered how they were behaving in other areas with regard to Animalia.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of it makes many people sick,&quot; Doctor Jones answered, &quot;but for the moment there isn&#39;t that much that can be done... Hopefully things will get better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra nodded and they walked along through the hallways at Horizon. Simply going through a standard conversion or going through the connected special projects, like Project Phoenix, all had their assorted offices and scientific representatives. Though, that could often vary given how often so many of Horizon&#39;s projects often overlapped. They eventually managed to come up to one of the main desks that was there, presently with a lone clerk doing some of the secretarial type work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi... I&#39;m Petra,&quot; Petra introduced herself, &quot;I&#39;m here for my part in Project Hermaphroditus... I&#39;d won the raffle to be one of the project&#39;s first two lions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I can say that her paperwork and profiles are all in order,&quot; Doctor Jones said from behind her.<br />
<br />
The clerk nodded and looked up. It was eventually Judy that came out to talk with them directly and lead them toward one of the transformation rooms. As they reached the door to one that was available, a great roar seemed to echo through the building making Petra jump.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; Petra wondered, her mind being drawn to the Dinotopians that Animalia now had and wondering as to whether or not Horizon was testing to see what sounds Dinotopians could make and how much were &quot;natural&quot; and how much were mimicry.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would probably be Cameron, the male lion that is to be uplifted,&quot; Judy answered, &quot;he arrived a little while ago with a zoo staff carrying him in. He might be a bit cranky at the moment with all the handling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What will they do?&quot; Petra wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ll likely tranquilize him so that he can be safely uplifted,&quot; Judy commented, &quot;or will use a dart to provide the initial dose and the second dose will be done the normal way... once Cameron is an Animalian and won&#39;t be a threat to attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra nodded and then looked back to Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime we can handle your conversion and then introduce you to Cameron after he is uplifted,&quot; Judy offered.<br />
<br />
Petra nodded to Judy and then looked back to Doctor Jones, who stood by quietly. He offered Petra a small assuring smile and waited while Petra followed Judy into the transformation room. For the moment, he remained for assurance purposes and to be able to ask a few questions of Petra after her transformation. It&#39;d make sure there were no hormonal changes that would go with the Project Hermaphroditus conversion. It was another of those rules that were demanded, and Doctor Jones had generally found that the best to keep new Animalians comfortable and easing what nerves were frayed by various other actions.<br />
<br />
Judy emerged a few moments later and waited quietly with Doctor Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you met some of the cases suggested?&quot; Judy asked to him quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regarding Brawn and Leo?&quot; Doctor Jones asked and then nodded, &quot;Yes... They both did come in... at least to schedule some full appointments.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ll be okay, right?&quot; Judy asked.<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones again nodded, &quot;Yes. I don&#39;t think that Regressive Hypersexuality is a threat with either of them. Some level of anxiety over breeding instincts having some influence on their sexuality may be something for them to adjust to... but I think that will really fix itself as they get more comfortable with themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully you&#39;re right,&quot; Judy answered.<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones nodded as a new voice roared from inside the transformation room behind them. It sounded a bit like Petra, but was a bit deeper. It was a bit lower than it was before and definitely carried more power to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh yyyeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaah!&quot; they heard Petra roar through the door, &quot;this fffeeeeeeeeeeellllsssss ggggggooooooooOOOOODDDDD!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shi&#39;s having a good time,&quot; Judy commented, &quot;I&#39;d best go get some of the alternative clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones gave a nod. He guessed that Petra had had a good time with hir transformation, as that was something many people seemed to have, especially if they were double dosed. And it was more than his Regressive Hypersexuality Patients that felt that way as well. He was left quietly standing in the hallway for a few moments until he heard the door open, and Petra came out, confident and unashamed, with a long leonine tail swaying behind hir and with hir mane doing a good job of covering up hir larger breasts. Lower, however was the obvious signs of maleness that showed the differences that those in Project Hermaphroditus went through in comparison to those normally going through conversion into an Animalian. Hir chest was obvious, but shi&#39;d also grown hir own set testicles in front of hir vaginal opening with a the sheath containing hir penis just in front of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Cameron?&quot; Petra asked as she looked down to Doctor Jones, &quot;I thought I&#39;d get to meet him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He might be uplifted, but I don&#39;t know on how it was done,&quot; Doctor Jones commented, &quot;if they tranquilized him to do the uplifting... he could still be under... as it were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra slumped hir rounded lion ears for a moment and gave a growling sigh. Shi was looking forward to meeting Cameron. As all Animalians generally seemed to be good people, and there was some level of excitement and curiosity that went along with meeting an Animalian that was experiencing something totally new. But, without knowledge on how Cameron was uplifted, that may not go well. She&#39;d just accepted that when her ears perked at doors being opened and footsteps were heard. They grew steadily louder as whoever it was got closer. Eventually Petra determined it was from behind a large set of double doors in front of her. Eventually it opened to reveal another lion Animalian, though Petra thought she could catch both male and female scents on the new arrival.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cameron?&quot; Petra asked hesitantly.<br />
<br />
The newly arrived Lion Animalian nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I heard you roar in triumph too,&quot; Cameron nodded as shi adjusted the shorts shi&#39;d been given, &quot;it&#39;s a pretty neat experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... you liked it?&quot; Petra wondered, noting the basketball shorts that Cameron wore along with a tee-shirt that swelled around hir impressive chest. Petra also noted that Cameron&#39;s voice wasn&#39;t as deep as Doctor Jones. It had a slightly higher pitch, not as high as a woman&#39;s tone of voice would be but not quite as base toned as a man&#39;s voice would be. Thought Petra shrugged and ignored it. To Cameron, Petra&#39;s voice probably sounded the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;I loved it,&quot; Cameron smiled, &quot;I got my nuts back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones couldn&#39;t resist a chuckle at that. Much of Animalia had heard at least something about Goldenrod&#39;s accepting of being one of the first in Project Hermaphroditus. Though, he guessed that any animal that had been neutered and was suddenly able to get those parts back would feel good about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I heard you won a... raffle to be like me?&quot; Cameron asked to Petra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... be complete and so on,&quot; Petra answered, &quot;ad more than willing to be friends with someone like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
And from there... a good friendship, at least, was born...</p>
