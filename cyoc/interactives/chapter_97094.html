<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With his new longer and stronger legs, Simon quickly walked home from the school. About a mile long walk, his longer stride rapidly ate up the distance. However, since it was still early in the school year and in the early after noon, Simon was soon sweating, causing his shirt to dampen. As his sweat moistened the already dirty clothes he was wearing, his body began to grow again from his body fluids mixing with those already imbedded in the garments. The growth was not nearly as dramatic as before, but by the time Simon reached his house, he had gain another few inches of height and his muscle had become a little bit larger and more cut. Now the clothes, which had been large on his frame, hugged his body displaying his impressive form.<br />
<br />
Slipping into his house, Simon was grateful to find that nobody was home when he arrived. Going up to his room, he pulled off his shirt and brought it on the floor. Simon’s room was what someone would think of as a typical nerd’s bedroom. Before a few moments ago, dirty clothes would never be found left on the floor. Instead, Simon had always kept his room neat, with science trophies and a framed periodical table as decoration. His desk, the only area that was not kept in perfect order, was covered in homework assignments, textbooks and one of the latest Apple laptops.<br />
<br />
Having built up a sweat on the way home, and since his body now more readily produced a strong odor, Simon decided to take a shower. Removing the athletic shorts and the jock strap and dumping them with the shirt he had been wearing, Simon walked into his bathroom. That was when he finally was able to see his new form upon arriving home.<br />
<br />
At first, Simon did not notice any changes. Since the transformation had not been nearly as dramatic, Simon at first was not sure what had caught his eye. But, after watching himself flex for a few moments, he realized that he was taller and his muscles were bigger and more defined. This thrilled him for about a minute, but as he admired himself in the mirror, he suddenly became aware of what he was doing and how much he was enjoying it.<br />
<br />
A wave of fear moved through Simon as he stopped flexing. Wanting more then anything for the smell to be gone, he hopped in the shower. With the water running over his body, Simon tried to forget everything that had happened to him over the course of the last few hours. Starting by washing his hair, Simon could not help notice how much thicker and less oily it now was. The irony was not lost on Simon that his hair was less oily but his body was a sweaty, smelly mess.<br />
<br />
After finishing his hair, Simon got to work on cleaning his body. Before, Simon could get in and out of the shower, having washed his hair and cleaned his body, in less then five minutes. This time, though, it was almost fifteen minutes before he finally was getting finished. It had not occurred to Simon before this, but being so much larger meant it would take a longer time to get clean.<br />
<br />
Finished, Simon chose to simply stand under the hot water and enjoy the feel of it as the liquid cascaded over his body. As he stood there letting the water carry away the worries, he did not notice that his was getting an erection.  Unbeknownst to Simon, his hand slipped down and wrapped itself around his growing manhood. Slowly, Simon’s hand massaged his member, sending waves of pleasure running through his body.<br />
<br />
At first, Simon was so absorbed in the pleasurable feeling; he did not take into account where it was coming from. Finally opening his eyes to seethe source, Simon realized what he was doing and tried to stop himself. Unable to, watched as his penis came to an astounding full mast of twelve inches long. It was a soda can within his hand with balls the size of peaches. It only took a few moments of work with his right and before he exploded all of the walls of the shower. Simon produce more semen in that one eruption then ha had produced in his entire life combined.<br />
<br />
What Simon could not know as he let the water wash away his mammoth load was the fact that as this masturbation session unfolded, his body had grown more. Now standing just over seven feet and was over two hundred and fifty pounds of muscle. He now had the body that coaches dreamed about.</p>
