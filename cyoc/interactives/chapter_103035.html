<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karen hated winter. The beauty of a fresh snow glistening in the sunlight was lost to her as she trudged<br />
through it, nearing the town of Draketon. She could see the outline of the town ahead of her as she<br />
crested a hill. Smoke was rising out of the chimneys lazily and people were set out to do the day’s<br />
activities. <br />
<br />
In the center of town was the reason for Karen’s travels: a large glass structure twice as big as<br />
any other building in town, called a greenhouse by the guardsman who had told her about it back in<br />
Lothrong. Apparently it grew plants all year round, and that was just what Karen needed.  She reached up<br />
and checked her ears out of habit, glad to feel that they were still normal for now, her curse not starting<br />
to break through the Azuchroma in her system. She was worried, though. She had only two flowers left,<br />
which wasn’t really enough to stop her changes if she let them get bad enough, and they were wilting<br />
more and more in this weather, no doubt lessening their magical properties. Sighing, Karen headed<br />
down the hill towards the town.<br />
<br />
Phil walked with pride as he came down the hill from the mountains with purpose and speed, a medium<br />
satchel tied to his belt clinking as he walked, the contents inside harmlessly hitting against itself. He had<br />
just completed his latest exploration of the caves that littered Drake Mountain, rumored to have once<br />
been the home to hundreds of dragons…or was it giant tunneling worms? That didn’t matter to Phil, as<br />
they were filled with gemstones, and he had found a fair amount this trip, enough to buy a proper house<br />
in town, rather than live in that shack he was currently occupying up near the mountain. His thoughts of<br />
a warm and cozy cottage filled him as he began jogging into town.<br />
<br />
“You’re kidding, right?” Karen asked the florist in the greenhouse.But the florist, a shy looking doe<br />
anthro, calmly shook her head.<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid not. Azuchroma is such a rare flower. 100 Gold is the best I can do,” she responded quietly. “I<br />
have other options that are less dear if you like.”<br />
<br />
“No, I need Azuchroma. How about a bulk discount?” Karen asked, getting agitated.“If you give me them<br />
for 25 each, I can take a dozen off you today and buy more in the future.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, madam,” the doe said, shrinking back a bit at Karen’s tone, “but I wouldn’t be able to sell you<br />
twelve, even at full price, that would wipe out all of my plants and I wouldn’t be able to grow more.”<br />
<br />
Karen took a deep breath and calmed herself.She didn’t want to frighten the doe. They were known to<br />
be a bit more skittish than other anthros, and this one’s demeanor wasn’t helping.<br />
<br />
“Is there any price that you would sell me the dozen you have at? I need them very badly,” Karen said<br />
calmly.<br />
<br />
The florist thought carefully for a moment, her ears moving occasionally. “If you are able to get me a<br />
Drakestone, I will give you them, but you must let me extract some seeds from them,” she responded<br />
confidently.<br />
<br />
“Drakestone? I’ve never heard of that. Why would you want one anyway? You’re a florist.” Karen asked,<br />
a bit happier that there was at least hope.<br />
<br />
“The Drakestone is a rare gem found only on Drake Mountain outside of town.  It is said to have magical<br />
properties that would allow my plants to grow three times as fast,” the deer said, seeming to daydream<br />
a bit as she spoke.<br />
<br />
“I will get you the Drakestone, but I need the flowers for magical purposes, so I also need the seeds,”<br />
Karen said sternly. “Will these suffice to allow you to start growing them again?” Karen asked, taking out<br />
the case with her two remaining wilted flowers and showing them to the deer.<br />
<br />
The doe’s ears perked up as she saw the Azuchroma.  She gingerly picked them up with her hoof-tipped<br />
hands and examined them. Karen was a little amazed at how delicate she was, considering her own<br />
experiences when her hands were part hoof. <br />
<br />
“These will work, but I need to use them immediately,  otherwise they’ll be useless,” the deer said, gently placing the flowers on the counter.<br />
<br />
“Take them then, as a deposit. I will be back with your Drakestone as quickly as possible,” Karen said,<br />
smiling. “Thank you, Mrs…?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, just call me Buttercup, that’s what everyone does,” the doe said, smiling and shaking Karen’s hand.<br />
“I never got your name…”<br />
<br />
“My name is Karen, and I will see you soon…hopefully,” Karen said, leaving the greenhouse.<br />
<br />
“Now how to find that stone,” Karen said to herself, looking up at the mountain that looked over the<br />
town. Perhaps she could find some help at the local pub, maybe a miner who wouldn’t mind some side<br />
work. Looking down the road, she headed out to find it.<br />
<br />
“Another round for me and my friends!” Phil shouted a bit drunkenly as the tavern erupted with<br />
cheering at his announcement. He didn’t remember having so many friends, but who cared? It would be<br />
nice to know more people in the town he would be living in shortly. He had gone to the town hall to see<br />
about a cottage, but they had been to lunch, so Phil figured why not grab a bite himself. Unbeknownst<br />
to Phil, that had been four hours ago, and his quick lunch had turned into an afternoon of revelry for<br />
half the town on his dime.  Phil stumbled back as he took a long gulp of his latest drink, bumping into a patron who had just entered  the bar. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, ma’ammm,” he slurred as he backed away from the tall woman in leather armor, who<br />
continued on her way after scowling at him.<br />
<br />
Maybe he had had enough, Phil thought as he returned to his bar stool, watching the barmaids handing<br />
out the tankards he had just bought for everyone. He’d best get some rest and go back to town hall in<br />
the morning with a clear head. Signaling the bartender, he put a night’s stay on his tab and headed<br />
upstairs to sleep it off.<br />
<br />
Karen, meanwhile, inquired at the bar about Drake Mountain and any locals who knew the caves .The<br />
bartender replied that most in the room had spent most of their lives mining out the mountain.<br />
However, with all the occupants of the bar drunk on Phil’s free drinks, Karen simply put up a want ad on<br />
the job board and hoped a few would be looking for extra cash when they woke up and realized how big<br />
their tabs were.<br />
<br />
“Ooooh, my head,” was all Phil could say as he descended the stairs in the morning. His head felt like<br />
someone was trying to cleave it open, and by the moans of the still-sleeping patrons in the bar area, he<br />
was not the only one.<br />
<br />
“HOW MUCH!?!” Phil shouted, grasping his head in pain at the loudness of his own voice as he reacted<br />
to the bill the bartender had just handed him.<br />
<br />
“1500 Gold, lad, and that’s a discount. You bought drinks for everyone in the bar for hours yesterday,”<br />
the gruff bartender, a stout but muscular man with a thick orange beard, responded.<br />
<br />
Phil didn’t even have that much gold on him, and it would take half his gems to cover that amount,<br />
leaving him well short on affording his new home.<br />
<br />
“Can I pay you later?” Phil asked. “I can mine some gems from the mountain and pay you with those!”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, lad, but I’ve had miners like you promise to pay me double, and I never see hide nor hair of them<br />
again,” he replied sternly.<br />
<br />
“Very well…” Phil sighed, grabbing a good amount of the gems from his satchel. “Will this cover it?” he<br />
asked solemnly.<br />
<br />
The bartender looked at the gems closely, even calling over the barmaid briefly to get her opinion.<br />
After the beautiful vixen barmaid gave a nod of approval, he smiled. <br />
<br />
“These’ll do, laddy. I hope to see you around again,” he said, offering his hand.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure you will, though I won’t be buying any rounds for the house, I assure you.” He smiled, shaking<br />
the man’s hand and heading towards the door, only to stop when something on the job board caught his<br />
eye.<br />
<br />
Karen yawned as she sat down at the bar.  She hadn’t gotten much sleep with the racket from<br />
downstairs, but at least it was quiet for now.<br />
<br />
“Coffee, please,” she said, as the bartender approached and promptly got her a piping hot cup.<br />
<br />
“That lad’s looking for you,” he said as he placed the cup down and pointed to a young man sitting at<br />
the other end of the bar. “Saw your ad on the job board.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well today might be better than I thought,” Karen responded, heading over to him.<br />
<br />
“So, you can help me find a Drakestone? You look a little young for the experienced miner my ad asked<br />
for,” she said as she sat next to him.<br />
<br />
“Depends on how much you are willing to pay. Drakestone is only found in the deepest caves. Few who<br />
venture in can find their way out again,” he responded confidently. He knew only idiots got lost in those<br />
caves, but he doubted she knew that. “And I prefer to be called a spelunker.”<br />
<br />
“I see.  How much is this going to cost, spelunker?” Karen sighed, not looking forward to the answer.<br />
<br />
“800 Gold,” Phil responded quickly, hoping to take advantage of the woman.<br />
<br />
“Ha, I’ll give you 400, and consider yourself lucky,” Karen said.  For 800 she’d rather just buy eight flowers<br />
from Buttercup and move on to the next town.<br />
<br />
“That’s half of what I asked for!” Phil responded. “600,” he countered.<br />
<br />
“400 Gold is all you’re going to get,” Karen said, remaining stern.<br />
<br />
“Fine,” Phil responded, annoyed. “But I get to keep any other gems we come across.”<br />
<br />
“We split the gems 70/30 in your favor,” Karen countered, glad the negotiations were going her way.<br />
<br />
“Deal!” Phil said, extending his hand. “My name is Phil, by the way.”<br />
<br />
“Karen,” Karen responded, shaking his hand. “Are you ready to go now? I’m on a tight schedule.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa, hold your horses, Mrs. Karen. I need to go buy some equipment for the both of us. This isn’t<br />
your average expedition. How does meeting back here in a few hours sound?” Phil asked.<br />
<br />
“Very well,” Karen said, reaching into her bag and pulling out a small satchel of gold coins. “Here is half<br />
of your fee now, don’t skimp on the equipment.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, ma’am,” Phil said, grabbing the coin purse off the counter quickly. “I’ll be back in a few hours,” he<br />
said, dashing out the door.<br />
<br />
Phil couldn’t believe his luck: his goal of getting a house in town was now back within reach thanks to<br />
this Karen woman. Running to the supply store, he picked up the standard fare of pickaxes, mining<br />
helmets with attached enchanted light stones, and most importantly, a large marker stone so they could<br />
find their way out again.  As he was about to purchase the equipment, something caught his eye: it was a small pendant made out  of Drakestone carved in the shape of a dragon’s head and neck.<br />
<br />
“What’s this, some sort of trinket?” he asked the clerk, picking the pendant up and looking at it.<br />
<br />
“It’s magically enchanted to glow if you are near Drakestone, or that’s what the woman who supplies<br />
them says,” the clerk replied gruffly as he started totaling up Phil’s other items.<br />
<br />
“Well, I suppose it can’t hurt to have a little extra help. How much?” Phil asked, placing one of the<br />
pendants around his neck.<br />
<br />
“Two Gold for the pendant.You’ve got to come back and tell me if it works,though. And 50 Gold for<br />
everything else,” the clerk responded, bundling up his items.<br />
<br />
“It’s a deal, my friend,” Phil said, paying the man, gathering up his other items and heading back to the<br />
bar.<br />
<br />
Karen sighed as she looked in the mirror at her ears.  They were starting to grow pointed at the top.  This<br />
was not what she needed right now, especially with no Azuchroma till she got ahold of that stupid<br />
Drakestone. Thankfully they were just starting.  She figured they wouldn’t get too bad till tomorrow<br />
morning if she took it easy, and even then she could just hide them with her hair for a while. After that,<br />
however, other changes started becoming a bigger factor.<br />
<br />
Karen decided to leave most of her belongings in her room at the Inn.  The owners assured her they<br />
would be safe. The lighter the load, the less she had to exert herself while she and her guide were<br />
exploring the caves in Drake Mountain, so as it were, she was only wearing her leather bracers and vest,<br />
not seeing there being a high chance of combat in the bowels of the mountain.<br />
<br />
Phil stumbled into the tavern carrying their supplies, managing to place them on the table just before he<br />
dropped a few of them. Karen was there waiting and began examining the equipment.<br />
<br />
“How long do you expect this to take?” Karen asked as she placed a small pick on her belt.<br />
<br />
“If we are lucky and we find one as soon as we get deep enough, two days, beyond that it’s up to how<br />
lucky we are,” Phil said, shrugging. “I’ve known people to go searching that mountain for weeks and not<br />
come back with anything.”<br />
<br />
“We have four days,” Karen said sternly as she calculated how advanced her changes would be by then.<br />
“After that, the Drakestone is no longer useful to me.”<br />
<br />
“Whatever you say, as long as I get my fee,” responded Phil, who finished packing up.<br />
<br />
“You’ll get it,” Karen grumbled before noticing the pendant on Phil’s neck. “What is that?  You didn’t have<br />
that before.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, the supply shop had them.  It’s supposed to be magically enchanted to glow when Drakestone is<br />
nearby,” said Phil cheerfully as he examined the pendant again with interest.<br />
<br />
“Well, be careful…magic is a dangerous thing,” Karen said, a hint of sadness in her voice. “Let’s be off,<br />
our four days started this morning.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, ma’am,” Phil said as they both marched out of the bar at a fair pace and headed up the mountain.<br />
<br />
“Make sure you place the next marker within sight of the last!” Phil shouted behind him as he looked at<br />
the pitch black tunnel ahead that descended into the darkness before him.<br />
<br />
“I heard you the first time,” Karen responded, annoyed, as she scraped the marker stone on the tunnel<br />
wall as she had been doing for the last two hours, making sure to do the specific pattern that Phil had<br />
showed her, a circle with a flat bottom with an upside down V inside it.<br />
<br />
“At least she’s not slowing me down,” Phil thought to himself as they continued to walk, the enchanted<br />
light stone on his helmet barely making a dent in the darkness. He had set a pretty demanding pace<br />
once they entered the mountain, partially due to the four day deadline Karen had set, but mostly<br />
because the faster they got out, the faster he got paid, and Karen had kept up with ease. He had just<br />
rounded a bend when his new pendant began to glow brightly.<br />
<br />
“No way there’s Drakestone at this depth.  It should be at least another four hours before we even have a<br />
chance of finding it,” he said, surprised, as Karen stood next to him. “Probably just a worthless broken<br />
trinket.”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t be so sure,” Karen said, pointing up ahead to a glow emanating from underneath a pile of<br />
rocks.<br />
<br />
“Someone must have dropped it!” Phil said excitedly as he began moving the rocks only to find a tiny<br />
glowing chip of Drakestone no larger than his pinkie nail.<br />
<br />
“I’m guessing you need something larger than this,” he said flatly, picking up the chip.<br />
<br />
“Your guess is right,” Karen said with a chuckle. “At least we know it works, very well it seems if it<br />
detected that tiny chip.”<br />
<br />
“True, guess it’s not all bad news,” Phil said, pocketing the chip and continuing on, his necklace still<br />
giving off a faint glow that made him feel an odd tingling sensation on his chest where it sat.<br />
<br />
The hours ticked on and they descended deeper and deeper; the marks Karen continually made on the<br />
tunnel walls were their only lifeline to the surface. The caves of Drake Mountain were not like other<br />
caves.  They lacked stalagmites and caverns, instead there were only roughly uniform tunnels that<br />
stretched on forever in a maze of twists and turns.<br />
<br />
Karen sighed as she checked her ears again when she stopped to make another mark. The fast pace and<br />
heavy mining equipment were taking more of a toll on her than she’d anticipated. Her ears were already<br />
into elfish range, but thankfully with her hair and helmet they were well hidden from Phil’s view, though<br />
she doubted he would notice anyway with how dark the tunnels were. What annoyed her more was the<br />
pattern she had been drawing for the last six hours: the more she looked at it, the more it looked like a<br />
hoof print, and the irony was not amusing to her.<br />
<br />
“We’re deep enough for Drakestone to be nearby,” Phil said, as he looked around for any signs of<br />
previous miners, glad to see the tunnel walls were undisturbed.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Karen smiled. “Anything I should be looking for to show where they might be?”<br />
<br />
“Unfortunately, not really. Drakestoneis always found in pockets of gems, so the only way to tell if there<br />
is any without digging is if part of the gem pocket is showing,” Phil said, scratching his chest below the<br />
pendant. “Hopefully this pendant keeps working and we can find some hidden beneath the walls.”<br />
<br />
“Let us hope,” Karen said as they continued on through the tunnels, keeping their eyes on both the<br />
tunnel and the faint glow of Phil’s pendant.<br />
<br />
Phil scratched his chest again. A strange itch had started there and he wondered if the pendant was<br />
causing a rash. Stopping and looking down at his shirt, he saw the area was slightly red, but nothing<br />
beyond what scratching would produce. Shrugging it off, he continued on his way, with Karen following<br />
behind.<br />
<br />
The hours crept by as they explored the pitch-black tunnels, and neither the pendant nor their eyes had<br />
spotted any signs of a Drakestone deposit. Phil continued to scratch at his chest, and now his arms as<br />
well. The rash seemed to be getting worse. He was just about to take the pendant off when its glow<br />
brightened a hundred fold, temporarily blinding them both before their eyes adjusted.<br />
<br />
“Looks like we found one!” Phil said, a bit excited, a gleam in his yellow eyes as they looked around,<br />
eventually spotting a small red ruby barely sticking out of the wall above them. Both of them took out<br />
their pickaxes and beat away at the area around the ruby carefully, not wanting to damage anything.<br />
Soon the rock above them fell away and gems started falling out of the hole by the handful for a good<br />
minute, leaving a hearty pile of gems on the floor. <br />
<br />
Phil gasped at the quantity and size of them.  Something inside him made him want to grab all of them at once. In fact, he was so distracted by the  gems that he didn’t notice the itching had returned with a vengeance. It quickly covered his whole<br />
body.Therewere even two brief areas of pain on his head, but they went away relatively quickly, and he<br />
focused on the gems again.<br />
<br />
As the two looked up into the hole, they were amazed at the sight of a large Drakestone nestled within<br />
even more gems. The stone itself was a radiant deep translucent red with streaks of gold throughout.<br />
<br />
“It’s huge!” Karen gasped in awe, unable to believe she actually had good luck for once.<br />
<br />
Phil was just speechless as he reached up and carefully extracted it from the gem pocket, held it in his<br />
hands and stared at it greedily.<br />
<br />
“Phil…Phil…?” Karen said, waving her hand in front of his face, trying to get his attention. But he was<br />
totally absorbed in the stone, his necklace was glowing brightly still, and there was a toothy smile on his<br />
face.<br />
<br />
“You okay?” she asked, nudging him lightly with her hand, when she noticed something as her helmet’s<br />
light stone lit up his face. Along his jawline, there appeared to be small black protrusions that<br />
disappeared into his hairline. As Karen looked closer, they appeared to be slowly growing, red scales<br />
forming around them.<br />
<br />
“Phil! Let it go!” Karen exclaimed, taking an empty satchel and grabbing the stone out of his hands with<br />
the bag, not wanting to touch it herself after seeing Phil’s spines. Phil’s pendant returned to a dull glow<br />
as she removed it, and his hands revealed to have elongated a bit with sharp black claw-like nails that<br />
had ripped through his gloves.<br />
<br />
That managed to break Phil free of the funk he was in. He clutched his head as a dull throbbing pain in<br />
his head appeared. “What happened?” he asked as the pain began to subside.<br />
<br />
“The Drakestone was changing you.  Look at your hands,” Karen said as she placed the stone in her pack.<br />
<br />
“Changing me?What do you mean…?” he asked as he bought his hand up to his face and saw the black<br />
claws poking through the fingertips.<br />
<br />
Ripping off one of his gloves, he saw the top of his hand was nearly covered in scales that tapered to a<br />
cream color on the underside.The shape had changed as well: his pinkie looked shrunken while the<br />
other digits were swollen.<br />
<br />
“What’s happening?!?” he cried frantically, feeling the rest of his body for other changes and finding the<br />
spines on his face Karen had seen earlier. There was also a lump at the base of his spine and his boots<br />
looked and felt two sizes too small. Finally, as he took off his helmet to use the light to look at his shoes,<br />
he heard Karen gasp as she pointed to the top of his head.<br />
<br />
Karen stared at the two three-inch-long black horns poking through Phil’s hair. They ran along the length<br />
of Phil’s ears, which were now elongated and covered in red scales, reminding her of her own ears,<br />
which twitched a bit under her helmet.<br />
<br />
“This isn’t supposed to happen!” Phil exclaimed as he felt his small horns. “Drakestone has magical<br />
properties, but nothing that would cause this!”<br />
<br />
“Let’s just get you out of here before it gets worse.  I’m sure someone in town can help,” Karen reassured<br />
him, stepping towards the last mark she made.<br />
<br />
“Good idea,” Phil said, carefully grabbing a satchel out of his pack and gathering up the gems on the<br />
floor.<br />
<br />
“Phil, forget about those, we need to get you help!” Karen said, urging him to come.<br />
<br />
“Why would I leave my treasure out for someone to steal?” Phil asked, now working on the gems still in<br />
the ceiling, his thickening fingers making him a bit clumsy.<br />
<br />
“How about, you’re turning into a dragon!” Karen yelled, seeing the lump in his spine wiggle and grow a<br />
bit as he collected.<br />
<br />
“Right…sorry…” Phil said, snapping out of it, putting the gems he had collected in his bag, and giving a<br />
big yawn, revealing sharp teeth. “Perhaps we should rest for a bit. I know time is of the essence, but<br />
navigating these tunnels exhausted will only make it take longer.”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure? I don’t want to wake up with a dragon next to me, looking at me like a snack,” Karen said<br />
begrudgingly, knowing she was exhausted as well and straining herself would not be good for her own<br />
changes.<br />
<br />
“Well, I don’t seem to be changing that much anymore now that I’m not holding the Drakestone, and<br />
you’re too skinny to be much of a snack,” Phil said with a slight chuckle and a toothy smile.<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Karen said sarcastically. “Perhaps you should take off that pendant as well, didn’t you say it<br />
was made of Drakestone?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, probably should, just to be safe,” Phil said, removing it slowly and giving a sad look as he handed<br />
it to Karen,who promptly put it in her bag with the Drakestone before placing it on the ground.<br />
<br />
“Let’s get a few hours in, then we’ll get you straight back,” Karen said, leaning against the walland<br />
closing her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Yes, ma’am,” Phil replied as he did the same, having to adjust his position a bit more as to not squish<br />
the nub that was his tail.<br />
<br />
Soon both were sleeping soundly, and what was meant to be a few hours turned into four, then six,<br />
before Phil got up in a semi-conscious state. Ambling over to his bag, he took out the satchel of gems he<br />
had collected earlier and poured them in a neat pile where he had been sleeping. He then walked over<br />
to Karen’s pack, unaware of the ripping sounds that came from his boots with every step, and grabbed<br />
the pendant, placing it around his neck before going back to the pile and laying down, resting his head<br />
upon them.<br />
<br />
Karen awoke a few hours after Phil’s sleepwalking, feeling much better than before, until she sat up and<br />
felt how tight her clothes were. Turning on her lightstone, she frowned as she saw her body. Her pants<br />
were tight around her butt and her shirt was riding up a bit on her larger torso. Her feet looked and felt<br />
cramped in her boots, and she felt a four inch nub of a tail in her cramped pants.<br />
<br />
Blowing through her lips in a very equine fashion and placing her helmet on her head, feeling her ears<br />
get smooshed by it a bit, she looked over to Phil.<br />
<br />
Phil wasn’t looking too hot either.  His face had now pushed out into a blunt muzzle that rested on the<br />
pile of gems he collected yesterday. His tail had ripped through his pants and was now a good foot long<br />
if not more, covered in red scales that faded to a golden color on the underside. His boots were in<br />
shreds at his feet, which were now almost entirely draconic in structure, only having three large clawed<br />
toes.<br />
<br />
Karen also took note that the Drakestone pendant was back on his chest.<br />
<br />
“Phil?” Karen said, trying to rouse him as she got herself up and in order, tucking her shirt back in.<br />
<br />
Phil just turned over, revealing two large lumps in the back of his shirt, which was tight on his body. His<br />
stature also seemed to have grown larger.<br />
<br />
“Wake up!” she yelled again, nudging him with her boot lightly.<br />
<br />
“Grruuh?” Phil said, slowly waking up. “How long were we asleep?” he asked, sitting up and examining<br />
his tail.<br />
<br />
“A lot longer than a few hours.We need to get going,” she said, picking up her pack.<br />
<br />
Phil nodded and attempted to place his helmet on his head, but was stopped by his bigger horns that<br />
make it impossible to wear. Growling lowly, he tore the light gem from the helmet and picked up his<br />
pack, his shirt ripping around the bulges as he reached down.<br />
<br />
“Drat, I liked this shirt,” he mumbled, scooping up his gem pillow into the sack and placing it in his bag.<br />
<br />
“Well, you put the pendant back on,” Karen scowled.<br />
<br />
“I did?” Phil said, looking down and seeing the softly glowing pendant. “I don’t even remember…”<br />
<br />
“Come on, let’s get out of here before you get even worse,” Karen said, annoyed, leading the way along<br />
the tunnels bearing the marks she had made.<br />
<br />
Phil reached down to take the pendant off, but couldn’t… he felt compelled to keep it on. But seeing<br />
Karen’s light fade, he quickly grabbed his pack and followed, taking a few steps to get used to his legs’<br />
new digitigrade gait.<br />
<br />
The first few hours went well, Karen keeping a fast pace that made good progress. As they stopped to<br />
take a break, Karen and Phil examined the bulges on his back, which were now clearly turning into<br />
wings, red scales covering the outer edges of the golden-colored membranes. Though they were still<br />
very small, they had caused Phil to stop carrying his pack on his back, for they got in the way.<br />
<br />
“Can you move them?” Karen asked curiously.<br />
<br />
“A bit,” Phil responded, a concentrated look on his face as the small wings began to fold a bit before he<br />
relaxed.<br />
<br />
“Well, we’re making better progress than yesterday. We should have you out soon,” Karen said as she<br />
looked at Phil’s now three-foot-long tail.<br />
<br />
“I hope so. I don’t want to be stuck as a dragon…”Phil grumbled, his voice deeper.A small tear was<br />
forming on the front of his shirt and seemed to get worse with every breath as his frame continued to<br />
grow.<br />
<br />
“We’d better keep going then,” Karen said, getting up and proceeding downthe tunnel.<br />
<br />
Phil followed, but kept an eye on the ceiling as he followed.  His horns had started to catch on low points<br />
when he wasn’t paying attention.<br />
<br />
Things started to get worse for Phil the further they ascended, as if whatever was affecting him seemed<br />
to sense their proximity to the surface. Every time he looked back, his wings and tail looked larger, and<br />
he seemed to have to bend down more often to avoid hitting his growing horns on the tunnel’s ceiling.<br />
*RIIPPP* was the sound of his shirt finally succumbing to the changes, his growing frame and the large<br />
golden belly scales that were forming on his chest tore it in two on the front, and his growing wings tore<br />
apart the back.<br />
<br />
Phil growled and ripped the rags off in frustration, tossing them asidebefore resuming following Karen.<br />
Karen was also looking different as time went on, but Phil was too concerned with his own situation to<br />
notice much.<br />
<br />
As they stopped for water, Karen went around the corner while Phil was drinking to check on her own<br />
changes. She seemed to be holding up for the most part, though her face felt a little swollen, and her tail<br />
had definitely grown, and it protested at being confined in such a tight space. Grumbling, she loosened<br />
her belt a notch and let out a sigh at the slight relief in pressure, only to frown again as she realize it was<br />
the last one.<br />
<br />
Heading back to Phil, she was growing worried, his wings were starting to become obtrusive, each nearly<br />
the size of his body. She hoped he wouldn’t have much trouble navigating the narrow tunnels, but she<br />
knew they were almost out.<br />
<br />
Phil took the last drink from his canteen before putting it away in his pack, resisting the urge to gaze at<br />
the gems inside. He was slowly coming to the conclusion that he was never going to get to a mage in<br />
time. His muzzle was nearly formed now by his estimation, and though Karen said it wasn’t, he was<br />
pretty sure she was just trying to make him feel better.<br />
<br />
Maybe it would be best to stay here in the tunnels…there was lots of treasure, after all…<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Karen’s return broke him out of this train of thought, and they continued on.<br />
<br />
“We made it!” Karen shouted as she walked out into the sunlight, glad to be free of the darkness of the<br />
mountain.<br />
<br />
Phil, however, found the sun somewhat unsettling, and he didn’t know why. But he smiled and used the<br />
light to get a good look at himself. He saw the body of an anthro dragon instead of his own, covered in<br />
deep red scales that faded to gold on his front. A tail nearly as long as himself waved behind him lazily, a<br />
spade capping the tip. His wings were huge, and he felt great as he stretched them to their full length,<br />
the golden membranes glistening in the sun.The only clue that he had been human was the severely<br />
ripped remains of his pants that somehow clung to his body, little more useful than shorts at this point.<br />
He had felt the changes slow down to a stop a little while ago, so hopefully he wasn’t going to get any<br />
worse.<br />
<br />
“Let’s get you to town,” Karen said after enjoying the outdoors for a bit.<br />
<br />
“I’ll make my own way there, I think, Karen…right now I think I’ll go flying,” he said, giving his wings a<br />
mighty flap and feeling the immense amount of lift they produced.<br />
<br />
“What?!” Karen asked, surprised. “Don’t you want your old body back?”<br />
<br />
“Eventually, but to tell you the truth, this feels too good to pass up right now!” he said, smiling. “But<br />
thank you for your help, Karen. Otherwise, I might have panicked and gotten stuck in those tunnels.”<br />
<br />
“Well if you’re sure, I’ll leave you to your fun,” Karen said warily. “You can keep the gems.You’re<br />
probably going to need them more than I.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks!See you around!” Phil smiled, shaking her hand and taking off quickly, flying seeming to come<br />
naturally to him.<br />
<br />
“Don’t kidnap any princesses!” Karen shouted jokingly as he flew off and she headed into town. She had<br />
a florist to see.</p>
