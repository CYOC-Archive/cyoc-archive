<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Four Months Later<br />
<br />
Life was good, and honestly I couldn&#39;t say it could get any better. Then again being a billionaire with a feisty, kinky, girlfriend will make a man say that.<br />
<br />
It had been four months since I had found the ring, purchased this estate, and began seeing Joanne. Since then the days and weeks had blurred into a lust and fun fueled extravaganza. My days mostly involved redecorating my home and seeing how kinky me and Joanne could get with my new found magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
I blinked, rubbing the sleep from my eyes before looking towards the melodic voice. A small smile spreading across my face as I gazed at Joanne&#39;s nude body. The 22 year olds massive breasts hovering inches from my face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; I yawned, stretching before looking into Joanne&#39;s mischievous face. &quot;What time is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven thirty,&quot; she replied. &quot;Was thinking about heading into the office a little early. Think you can wish me up some clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
I chuckled softly, flashing a small grin at Joanne. It amazed me that with the amount of money we had, she still liked working. I had pressed her on this, wondering why when we had billions if dollars she still wanted to work as a Real Estate agent. &quot;Why are you going to work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I may look like a Zoomer but I still have that Gen X work ethic,&quot; she proclaimed. &quot;Besides, it keeps me busy. Can&#39;t just sit around fooling around with you all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish you would,&quot; I chuckled. Joanne grinned, leaning over to plant a deep kiss on me before smiling. &quot;Oh believe me I know their Joe,&quot; she said. &quot;But I like my job and besides. It gives us a little extra cash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m worth 5 billion dollars,&quot; I laughed. &quot;Whats an extra couple hundred?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Principal of tbing,&quot; she replied. &quot;Now you gonna wish me up a new outfit or what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; I smirked. &quot;I kinda like this look.&quot; I reached out my hand, giving her firm ass a quick squeeze. Joanne laughed softly, casting me a lustful yet serious look.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have rules against nudity,&quot; she grinned. &quot;Dont get me wrong, looking forward to getting down to business later but I want to head into the office early.&quot; I sighed, giving her a slight nod. Joanne smiled, giving me a knowing wink as she now stood before me, naked as the day she was born and awaiting her newest outfit. However, I felt like having a bit of fun with her today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you fucking kidding!&quot;<br />
<br />
A smiled impishly, admiring my handiwork. Instead of a form fitting and expensive business suit, I decided to dress Joanne in something more age appropriate. Joanne now stood in a pair of flip flops with a pair of tight jeans shorts, topped with a comfortable looking tshirt with a college logo. &quot;What i think it looks good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah if I&#39;m going on spring break,&quot; she countered. &quot;This doesn&#39;t scream business, it screams bong hits and keg stands.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats wrong with that,&quot; I grinned. &quot;Bet I could drink you under the table.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please,&quot; she scoffed. &quot;Back in college I would of kicked your millennial ass in every drinking game. Beer pong, asshole, flip cup. I was the Queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay boomer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanne scrunched up her face, sticking out her tongue as she turned to leave. I always savored these quirky discussions. Joanne was weird in a good way, a quirky, fun loving ball of energy with no filter. If amazed me how much I enjoyed having her around. Yeah she looked fantastic but her personality put her on another level.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucky for you I have an outfit in my car,&quot; she stated. &quot;I&#39;ll catch up with you later Joe.&quot; I now watched as she strolled out of the room, her hips swaying as she went. Man, I wanted her to saty a little longer. My morning wood was still painfully at attention and nothing was a better cure than a kinky romp in the sack with Joanne. <br />
<br />
A thought now crossed my mind, temporarily deadening my wood. It would only be temporary and after I changed her back I was sure I could recover. Hopefully, Joanne wouldn&#39;t be too pissed as I made my wish.<br />
<br />
As Joanne now began to walk towards the huge front door, she paused as she felt an odd feeling flow over her. Stopping for a moment, she looked herself over. Her clothes still fit, meaning Joe wasn&#39;t shrinking her. Joanne felt her face flush, she had to admit she enjoyed Joe shrinking her out of her clothes. <br />
<br />
Currently though nothing seemed different. Shrugging she kept moving forward, chalking up her feeling as nerves or the coffee she had. As she approached the door though, she could tell something was amiss.<br />
<br />
Joanne&#39;s formerly tight shorts seemed a little slack around her waist. As she studied herself she was a bit confused, her height hadn&#39;t decreased but she had lost a little bit of weight. Heating up her breasts, she frowned, noting her breasts didn&#39;t seem quite as large as before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it Joe,&quot; she grumbled. She needed to reach the car. Joe had done something similar awhile back, shrinking her down to about 4 feet tall. Once she had pulled out into the street though, Joe quickly reversed the wish, returning her to her previous size. She just needed for him to see she had left before she would return to normal.<br />
<br />
Exiting the house, Joanne now looked tobher brand new BMW. She had purchased it after receiving the commission for selling the estate. She felt an incredible amount of pride in that purchase, it was a sign that she had succeeded in her profession. Glancing at herself, she grumbled in annoyance.<br />
<br />
She was definitely changing, her breasts had lost a couple of cup sizes, now resting in the B cup territory, her shorts were quite loose on a thinning waist, even her flip flops seemed somewhat oversized. Oddly though, the world didn&#39;t seem any bigger but experience told her it wouldn&#39;t be long before tha changed. Reaching into her purse she now paused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where the hell are my keys,&quot; she whispered. &quot;And my wallet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanne paused, something wasn&#39;t right. Her voice sounded different, it was higher, more girlish than she was accustomed too. What was going on? Shuffling towards her car, Joanne looked into one of the side mirrors before letting out a girlish shriek.<br />
<br />
Staring back at Joanne was her, just a much younger version of her. Joanne couldn&#39;t be more than 14 now, her face round and innocent, her body waifish. Now she understood why her clothes were so ill fitting, she was reliving puberty in reverse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda hard to go to work when your not old enough TOO work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanne turned her youthful face trying to look angry but only conveying that of a moody teen. &quot;What the hell Joe,&quot; she whined, wincing at the petulant childish voice. &quot;I look barely old enough to be in high school!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I wanted you to stay,&quot; he smirked. &quot;And last time I checked Gen A wasn&#39;t old enough to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh ha ha dingus,&quot; she snorted, silently cursing herself, she wished she would have sworn instead. &quot;Can you grow me up please? Not trying to be back in a training bra.&quot;<br />
<br />
I chuckled, pondering what I would do with a teenage Joanne.</p>
