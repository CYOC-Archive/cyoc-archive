<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heart in my throat, butterflies in my stomach, the next words filled me with dread...<br />
<br />
"Are you ready? We're here at the beach!" <br />
<br />
As soon as my bare foot touched the sand of the beach I felt a short pinch in my nipples. I squeaked quietly. Somehow I knew that even though I couldn't feel anything unusual after the pinch the process of my breasts growing already started.<br />
<br />
I looked at Andrew to see if he heard my squeal. Apparently he didn't because he just continued walking as if nothing happened. I was glad he didn't realize the process had started. The last thing I wanted was him making me pose for him so he could watch the growth.<br />
<br />
As we went into the beach people stopped looking at me as there was nothing unusual in walking barefoot on the sand. One thing that struck me though was how the beachwear has changed in this another reality. Because I wanted neither bras nor any other form of breast support to exist it was impossible for a bikini as I know it to exist. Instead women wore just bikini bottoms and extremely short 'sundresses' covering their constantly moving breasts and reaching down to just above their belly buttons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also the only ones playing beach volleyball were men. For obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
From people gathered on the beach this one woman was looking at me. Then as we walked into the beach she stood up and walked to me. She must have seen me entering the beach barefoot.<br />
<br />
She was quite pretty; nicely tanned, 4 or 5 inches taller than me and from the way her 'sundress' stuck out one could clearly see that she possessed a pair of grapefruit-sized breasts. Seeing her was the moment when I realized that even though I was in a girl's body now I was still attracted to females. Thanks god. That also made me think - <i>does this mean that I'll arouse myself after my boobs grow?</i> <br />
<br />
The woman came over to me and smiled pityingly.<br />
<br />
<br />
"I saw you walking in barefoot and heard your squeal. I know it must be hard for you and I only wanted to say you shouldn't worry too much. Each one of us had to go through this. And even though you might not get used to having breasts just know that we're here to support each other. As for an advice - recently I found this cream which reduces the jiggle almost to nothing. It's very expensive but at some point you might want to use something like that. Look! They almost don't jiggle at all!"<br />
<br />
She took her 'sun dress' off and I saw her magnificent breasts in their full glory. She cupped them with her hands. They bounced up and down and the whole teardrop shape seemed to jiggle like water balloons.<br />
<br />
If she considered this as <i>"almost no jiggle at all"</i> how will my chest behave without that cream? I didn't even dare to think.<br />
<br />
"Yeah, so you might want to find your place on the beach already." She said putting her top back on. "It's definitely started."<br />
<br />
<br />
She pointed at my chest and I saw what she meant. Where a minute ago, before the pinch I felt, the front of my sundress was perfectly flat now it was bulged in two places on my chest. It looked like my sister's chest when she was 12 in the old reality, small A-cups. I didn't feel any tugging nor jiggling and hardly any weight though which I found peculiar. It was just the way they brushed against my dress; I thought I could feel every single thread of the fabric it was made of.<br />
<br />
As I took a peek inside under my dress I found out why I didn't feel what I expected to feel. There wasn't any breasts there yet. It was all just nipples.<br />
<br />
They were the puffiest nipples you could possibly imagine. With the areolae measuring over 3 inches across whey stuck out 2 inches. On top of them there were the actual nipples, each of them slightly bigger than the tip of my thumb. And they weren't even erect! How much bigger they could possibly get?<br />
<br />
As I was looking at them, their dark pink color contracting with my pale and freckled complexion I saw some light blue veins appear in some places on the skin of my chest. My body was ready for the appearance of my mammary glands.<br />
<br />
I was breathing heavily but then I noticed that when I exhaled my nipples didn't quite returned to the same position. They stuck out a little more. I pressed the flesh near the nipple with my finger until I was touching my rib. Before my very eyes I saw the soft skin of my chest slowly enveloping my finger more and more until I felt I can't get my finger to touch my rib anymore.<br />
<br />
<i>"Shit, shit, shit shitshitshitSHIT!!"</i> I was screaming inside.<br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't want Andrew to see that the process has already started so while he was busy watching some other girls walking by I quickly put a blanket on the warm sand and laid down on it, my back up.<br />
<br />
It wasn't even two  minutes into the process and already I could feel some strange weight on my chest shifting as rotated on the blanket.<br />
<br />
<i>"Oh, God..."</i> I thought. <i>"What have I gotten myself into?.."</i></p>
