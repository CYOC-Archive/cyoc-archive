<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What greeted you when you open the door surprised you even more as you shortly realized that it was a gypsy. As there was something different about the way this one was dressed for it did remained you of those Asia clothes that getting a closer look at this person wasn&#39;t an old lady in its 50s, but was actually a man for he was about the same age to you also. You weren&#39;t sure why he was dressed in a girl&#39;s gypsy gown as this sort of reminded you of corporal Maxwell Q. Klinger from M*A*S*H, yet you didn&#39;t bother on asking into it then what happened to you thus far.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I help you?&quot; You asked as you were unsure if this was the right call on how to answer to a stranger who was just inches from outside of your doorstep, let alone on how things will turn out with you now being a human pony girl. Still, you went through with this and started the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot; Hello Young wol-&quot;, he began to say, before being interrupted. Saying that you were legally still Who You Are as to what you look like now, after placing on this horse mask which turned you into what he sees before him now.<br />
<br />
The crossdressing gypsy man then facepalms himself, almost as if he forgotten about something very important. To this knowledge, he then tells about your problem as you were hoping that there must be away for this gypsy to help you out of this and turn you back. if there was a way to help fix this, it would be him as you were just about ready for any news that came your way. Good or bad, you had to know.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! That&#39;s why I&#39;m here. It&#39;s about Those mask. Well, where do I begin? First off, the mask will not come off if you have interaction with a man as the changes will otherwise become irresistable. If you can live long enough to last and survive for the next year that the mask itself will revert you back to normal as it will accept your decision on removing the mask by slipping itself off of you to try on a different mask, slip it back on for the body you have now, or just not want anything to do with these masks at all. In addition, you can not use the effect of trying on any other mask while in the use of the activated mask that you wear now. Otherwise, your mind will be lost on how many mask you&#39;re wearing and how long theyll each  be waiting to be stripped off of you. Furthermore, if you were to wear another mask over to the one you wear now will pause the first mask&#39;s timer as this will start your new timer of your new mask that each of these mask has a form of there own. Also, you can&#39;t tell anyone as to who you once were as they&#39;ll think that you&#39;re crazy, ill, take advantage of your predicament and keep you for themselves, or worse. Some may also take this news about you seriously and try to help you, but that a small chance as there are some who will keep you for farming, slave, petplay, a maid, to even begin in their secret dungeon for the list goes on. You can stay and try to build up your new life for a year, or you can see if you want sanctuary by a gypsy and come with me for safety. Over wise, I can lend you two wolf gaurds that I have. &quot; he said as he then clapped his hands together twice, to then see that there were two large wolf like gaurds coming out of his horse carriage and approached to either side of his sides.<br />
<br />
You couldn’t help but notice on how hot looking they were, even if they were canine predators in armory. they looked like something from the 2022 nefix film the school of ood and evil that the gypsy soon after pulls out his crystal ball as it was glowing both green and blue. You did ask tho as to why this has to do with being gorgeous, sexy horse girl with a cute set of clothing for men to get a nice good glimpse at you.<br />
<br />
Just then, thoughts on what you just said started to clik in. &quot;wait a minute, gorgeous? Cute set of clothes? Men to get a &#39;gulp&#39; nice good glimpse of me? This can&#39;t be real. What&#39;shappening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
As you were about to panic on what was going on, He then smacks you and tells you to listen. Telling you that it was your female mind starting to kick in. Telling you that the mask has also mental changes to come with the changes, to those who can&#39;t handle the mental changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;So wait, wait a minute here. You&#39;re saying that if I were to  put on say... a cow mask on my friends, they would also become cows as they&#39;ll live out on a farm for one whole year? and if something were to happen to them, then the changes will liggally become permanent?&quot; You say.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s mostly to what I just said, you dumb bitch. I just explained mostly everything that you need to know to you are you deaf on hearing?&quot; He says.<br />
<br />
Just making sure on what you said about these masks and all of the rules. Rules like not to wear more than the mask that I have on, or my mind might slip into daze on how many mask I&#39;m wearing while living the life of each mask for one year. Still, I think that I&#39;m safer with these two wolf gaurds o have by that i&#39;ll take them off of your hands.&quot; You said, not admitting that you wanted them because they were so hot looking to think of wanting to be one of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well. GAURDS!  From now on, you listen to your new master of this house. I&#39;ll come by with in a year to see how things are progressing.&quot; He says that the two wolf gaurds made their yes sir and marched over to your two sides.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, the horse was a lucky choice. Was it because I&#39;m not a disgrace? or is it because I&#39;m beautiful?&quot; You say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes. It&#39;sa good choice. A little bit of both actually, it suits you quite well. Oh yeah, I almost forgot.&quot; He says as the gypsy starts to chant something that you beging to feel lightheaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before I go now, the wolf gaurd on your left is Kyle as the one that&#39;sto your right is Armando. And yes, like you that they each had worn a wolf mask as they even chose to permeability stay into their new forms. Feel free to change their names if you like for I&#39;ve been calling them gaurd 1 and 2. And believe me, it gets harder to their names intact for who you call on when you get to have more than five around the house. that said, what is your decision now?&quot; He, the crossdressing gypsy said that both Kyle and armando were one your friends from school. so why were they now wolf gaurds? What has this gypsy done to them? Do they still remember who they are and what has happened to them? If so, why would they want to stay as these wolf gaurds? Still, why are you being turned on by your friends when you should be a guy yourself?<br />
<br />
Seeing as your mind was reaching out with questions while being confused that the gypsy man was shortly taking advantage of your situation, by seizing the momentf grabing you away. However, Kyle snapped you out of it that when he shouted your name made you clear enough to ward him off. What did you do after that?<br />
<br />
(This is where you decide on what happens next. feel free to add your own story line ups as there are a few listed down below for you can chase off that crossdressing gypsy with your two new wolf gaurd friends, return back to the house for a better choice, or even skip to one year later and see what happens from there. Thank you and happy reading.)</p>
