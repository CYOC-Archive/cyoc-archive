<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darius sat up slowly, rubbing at the back of his eyes as the morning sun peeked through the curtains to wake him. He&#39;d had such a strange dream last night, like all his size was draining into his ass, and all his masculinity into someone else. What a nightmare, it was like this man had been a vampire, stealing his hard-earned muscles.<br />
<br />
He opened his eyes, then blinked at the tiny delicate wrist in front of him. Oh no. No, no, no, no. He cupped both hands around his cheeks, feeling the baby-smooth flesh and narrow jawline, effeminate and even cute. His hair was longer too. Ugh!<br />
<br />
Panicking, Darius stumbled out of bed. He lurched forwards with a yelp as he nearly fell. His backside felt heavy, and there was a half-minute where he needed to lean against the bed to steady himself, learn how to walk again. He took that moment to get acquainted with his delicate girlish feet, poking out from beneath an oversized shirt that fit him like a nightgown. He swallowed hard, remembering how this same shirt had been stretched to its limit the night before, straining across his pectorals.<br />
<br />
Nervously, he looked over his shoulder and lifted the back end of his shirt. His ass was obscene, looking like someone had shoved two beachballs onto his tiny twink body. Each cheek eclipsed the size of his own pretty head and then some. His waist may have been lithe and tiny but his hips flared out twice as wide as his shoulders. This was humiliating. It was like his whole body had been reduced to call attention to his absurdly accentuated rump.<br />
<br />
Darius did the only thing he knew he could do. He crumpled to his knees, weeping. Tears burned hot down his cheeks as he felt his mammoth butt rest on the ground before his knees did. He deserved this. He&#39;d acted like an ass and had been made into mostly ass. There was no way this could be any worse.<br />
<br />
A hurried thunderous pounding across wooden floors shook the entire apartment. Darius looked up, staring through tear-stained eyes at a giant hairy goliath stampeding towards him. The man was well over seven feet tall and his well-combed magnificent beard was braided down his chest. He looked as if he&#39;d just bought a pair of new clothes, jeans in the triple-xl size that still did little to hide the massive python straining at the bulge od his pants.<br />
<br />
Darius wanted to say he knew this man&#39;s name. He must have introduced himself at the club. He&#39;d been a much smaller man then. His real name escaped him, so Darius looked up, tearfully whimpering the only name he remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy?&quot; He said sniffling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking hell, Darius,&quot; Daddy said. He thundered over to him and knelt down on one knee. Sitting down, Darius didn&#39;t even reach over Daddy&#39;s massive nipples, poking obscenely through his shirt. &quot;You all right, kid?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darius tried to stand. God, even with Daddy kneeling Darius was barely eye-level with his jaw.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so s-s-small,&quot; Darius whimpered, blubbering through his tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy baby boy, I know,&quot; Daddy said, reaching out. He took Darius into his huge hairy arms, scooping him up into a massive hug. Darius&#39;s entire body was only just taller than the length of his torso and upper thighs. &quot;I got you some clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Darius said, blinking in realization. He squirmed until Daddy let him back down. He stumbled, on awkward weight, barely able to walk upright thanks to his absurd bottom. &quot;You just left me here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Store&#39;s right across the street baby boy. I left you a phone and I had my cell on me,&quot; Daddy said, frowning. &quot;I figured you would appreciate having something to change into when you woke up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck you!&quot; Darius yelled, remembering some of his fire. &quot;Look at me! You can&#39;t just abandon me-me...noooooo! Make it stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darius and Daddy both watched in open-mouthed horror as Darius shrunk again. The inches melted from his body one by one, except for in his ass, which only seemed to swell and bubble in spite his protestations. It gurgled and jiggled as he staggered into his new height, barely knee high to his daddy now, who&#39;d done his own growth and swelling. Darius couldn&#39;t be sure, but he guess his own height to have drifted below the four foot mark, making him positively tiny and helpless. His ass was no half as wide as he was tall, and he staggered back, falling onto it as if it were a plump cushion.<br />
<br />
Daddy&#39;s shirt ripped down the chest as his massive hairy pecs exploded in size. The 8 foot tall man groaned and sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;There went my clothes budget,&quot; he sighed. &quot;Baby boy, if you want to stop shrinking. You need to calm down. It&#39;s your disobedience doing this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK YOU!&quot; Darius shrieked. Then screamed bloody murder as six more inches disappeared from his body and vanished into an ass that really now was almost as tall as his entire body.<br />
<br />
Daddy frowned as his head hit the ceiling. &quot;This isn&#39;t easy for me either you know. I can&#39;t afford to outgrow this apartment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darius would have protested further, but was nearing the point of equalization. He gulped and kept his mouth shut, before he said something that would render him smaller than his own ass.</p>
