<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The cabin smelled of incense and was  illuminated by a couple of old oil lamps. In the center, on a carpet, was an anthropomorphic mare with a black fur like the night with her legs crossed. As if he had noticed the presence of his visitor, she left her lethargy.<br />
<br />
“so You finally come back”.<br />
<br />
“ More than seven years have passed. Kiv´la”.<br />
<br />
The mare showed a smile as she looked at her guest. A gray stallion dressed in a jacket and a fedora over his head-<br />
<br />
“You still look ridiculous with those looks”.<br />
<br />
“¡Ah!”  Jack didn&#39;t know how to respond or if he felt offended by that answer. His clothes were one of his greatest pride. The mare looked him funny.<br />
<br />
“And you continue to behave like a colt” she rise as she extended her arms making a gesture to him to come closer” Come here, nephew”.<br />
<br />
Jack approached his aunt and hugged her. After which, they both sit down again facing each other.<br />
<br />
“What brings you here to the north”.<br />
<br />
Jack had been thinking these last three weeks, since he left Zion about what he could say, any excuse that delayed the moment of truth. He decided to respond directly and face the consequences.<br />
<br />
“I came in search of Nao”.<br />
There was no trace of sadness in her aunt&#39;s features. Only resignation as if she were already waiting for this conversation<br />
<br />
 “So you&#39;ve decided to take the path of doom”.<br />
<br />
´More omnious impossible´.<br />
<br />
She already knew what I would say but she had to understand the importance of this. <br />
<br />
“I know that it is considered crazy but I know that there is a way to find it- he also made it to reach his diary that had tied him to the hips- I know that father was studying a series of tumults ...”.<br />
<br />
“Your father and uncle always had the same idea in their heads” nostalgia  seemed to invade her. With a fanciful voice she continued “Finding Nao and the Tree of The White Light and the Black Tree of The Dark Shadow “ a sad sigh left her lips “ They both went beyond the cursed lands and entered the mountainous regions. You know how this story ends”.<br />
<br />
Jack didn&#39;t dislike his aunt. But he hated her fatalism. <br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t know that” He replied.<br />
<br />
“Your father and your uncle died in those mountains, Jack. If not, I don&#39;t want to think about the alternatives. Especially with the news that comes to us from Mirmid”.<br />
<br />
The silence was made in the room that could have lasted an eternity.<br />
<br />
“They found little Sheila ...”<br />
<br />
“That…” The fury seemed to emanate from his aunt but she held it back inside, leaving a remnant reflected in her eyes”thing was not a member of The Herd of Sagittarius. The girl who ran free through the meadows died six months ago when she lost herself in the forest”.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What if there was a way to help her?&quot; He replied.<br />
<br />
“There is no way and you know it, Jack”.<br />
<br />
He clenched his fists.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t accept it. And you shouldn&#39;t either”.<br />
<br />
Acara looked like she was tired of his attitude and decided to take action on the matter. <br />
<br />
“While you are under my gaze I will not allow you to continue with this madness, nephew” he was no longer talking with her aunt but with the Nak of the tribe”it is not only about you but also about the welfare of the Madra tribe”.<br />
Jack did not insist on the matter. His aunt used to be a person given to others. But as chief of the tribe, her greatest <br />
duty was to take care of her people even at the expense of others.<br />
Jack snorted and scratched his head. Leaving Nao aside for the moment he changed the subject.<br />
<br />
“I heard that you found something interesting in the prairies”.<br />
His aunt&#39;s attentive gaze did not leave him.<br />
<br />
“One of our hunting groups found an unconscious mare in the caves two days ago. By bringing her here our shaman confirmed that it was a Shiv´la”.<br />
<br />
Jack paid attention to his aunt&#39;s words as he unconsciously adjusted his hat. Shiv&#39;la or ´the one who walks by your side´ was like the descendants of the Herd of Sagittarius had decided to call those mysterious beings from beyond the Void. The most superstitious among the tribes thought they were demons that would bring destruction and ruin over the pack of Sagittarius but the truth was simpler. Those creatures were neither better nor worse than the inhabitants of this world, although their knowledge used to be the seed of great changes, many tribal inhabitants used to treat them with reverence or even fear. The monks of the old order of Aro thought they were sent from the 10 spirits come to this world to guide the Sagittarians.<br />
<br />
´Maybe they are´, you think with a certain sneer.<br />
<br />
 The truth is that the reasons why those unfortunates people were transported to this world with new forms identical to the Sagittarius  were unknown. There was no apparent purpose behind or any kind of divine sign. Apart from that attributed to the superstitious and religious.<br />
<br />
“¿What are you going to do with her?”<br />
<br />
“This night will appear before the whole Tribe. And I intend to be part of it through the adoption ritual”.<br />
It didn&#39;t surprise Jack. The Madra tribe had an acceptance policy among foreigners and even the Shiv&#39;la. In contrast to the rest of the tribes scattered throughout the Land of the Prairies, those poor unfortunates used to be expelled at the time of their discovery and even in the regions of Mirmid and Madack they could be sentenced to die and be executed or used as a sacrifice. <br />
<br />
Jack chuckled.<br />
<br />
“It is commendable that you still worry about strangers”.<br />
<br />
His aunt seemed to have regained the good humor.<br />
<br />
“ I am not guided only by pure altruism, nephew. Since our sister villages were razed by the Savages 3 years ago, our people need new blood more than ever. The blood of a member of the Shiv&#39;las is very precious to us. Tomas has been a great help to improve the village&#39;s defenses and has become one of our best hunters. Even after Ana&#39;s disappearance he has remained in his position”.<br />
<br />
Something caught the attention of that last sentence-<br />
<br />
“¿Ana?” He was confused by that statement” ¿What happened to her?”.<br />
His aunt&#39;s eyes seemed about to burst into tears. When she spoke the following words her voice was broken by grief.<br />
<br />
“She lost herself”.<br />
<br />
That phrase fell like a stream of cold water on Jack backside.<br />
<br />
“I ... thought he had adapted well. I thought she was happy in the tribe”.<br />
<br />
“I thought so too, dear”her aunt&#39;s eyes closed” even in her best days her gaze was full of certain ... melancholy. I thought Tomas could help her but it wasn&#39;t enough to forget those who were left behind”.<br />
<br />
“¿What happened to her?”<br />
<br />
“She Disappeared among the wheat fields. We have not seen her again”.<br />
At that moment the entrance to the hut rose, and a stallion that Jack knew very well entered.<br />
<br />
“Arlo” Upon this arrival her aunt dedicate him a polite smile” you&#39;ve already made the orders I asked for”.<br />
<br />
“Yes” Arlo made a genuflection” I&#39;ve also talked to Ariel. Shee has agreed to adopt the newcomer in her family”.<br />
<br />
“Thanks Arlo”  She focused on Jack again “ I would like you to stay tonight during the celebration. I think our new arrival will want to meet you”.<br />
<br />
“Mh” He doubts that Tomas and the rest of the hunters let him go exploring. And he really didn&#39;t want to have to go back to the south with the hands empty. Maybe this stranger could tell him about the world she had left behind.<br />
Making a bow answered by his aunt, Jack left the hutand entered the village illuminated by the reddish light of twilight.</p>
