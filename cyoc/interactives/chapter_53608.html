<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And for the herd, the wheel simply turned. A never ending cycle of being born, growing up, <br />
finding your mate, having fawns, raising them the best you could, and becoming lunch for <br />
a hungry lupman or or leoman. If you were lucky your fellow Gold Deer then dragged off <br />
your hide, hung or laid it among a collection of others, some final farewells were said. Your <br />
fawn with the same name as you become Senior and their fawn ceased to be Junior and <br />
became Mister or Miss instead. Your suffix became known as Ancestral same as all your <br />
other ancestors before you who were dead.  Then the wheel just continued turning without <br />
you, your part in the show done. <br />
<br />
With no hide to be recovered for Eve, there was no final farewell for her, and with her fawn <br />
dead before it could be born, that was the last Eve among the Herd that would ever be <br />
unless another doe named her second fawn as such. After all, fathers named the bucks, <br />
mothers named the does. <br />
<br />
Jack and Marcine grieved for the loss of Eve in a senseless loss of life. Both her and her <br />
fawn were now know as Ancestral Eve, and the wheel simply turned. <br />
<br />
Adam of course didn't take another mate, EVE had been mate, her death did not change <br />
that fact in the least, he never understood the practices of taking new mates done by Man <br />
(meaning HUmans, LEOmans, LUPmans, and FELmans).  This was another factor of Gold <br />
Deer behavior that left biologists pulling their hair out. <br />
<br />
They had come to the strange island through the place where smells made no sense, which <br />
then turned into a twist heaving mass of madness... lost Eve, felt insanity itself have them <br />
attack their own predators preemptively, then once the story had broken slowly seemed to <br />
become something out of a idealistic fawn's fever dream. <br />
<br />
Now they had arrived back to their ancestral grounds either via the place where smells <br />
made no sense, or by skipping over the horizon. They form formation with bucks <br />
protecting the ranks and does protecting the fawns, and resumed their foraging as they <br />
had always done. They made sure to keep their senses about them when the lupmans <br />
returned via the mirror. The Lupmen did not attack them... today.  The Gold Deer looked at <br />
the massive mansion in indignation.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll fall in time,&quot; Jack told the fawns as Jack Senior as told Jack, &quot;This foul unnatural thing <br />
Man calls 'civilization' will destroy itself soon enough as all unnatural things do.&quot;<br />
 <br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Alice and Abbey hadn't asked Moja and the others to help with transporting the gargoyles <br />
and the teen wolves back to Glendale, only the Herd. However, <br />
<br />
&quot;It's the civilized thing to do.&quot; Moja explained, &quot;We're leomans, we can't do anything less.&quot; <br />
<br />
Abbey and Alice of course gratefully accepted the older children's help. First went <br />
Frontdoor with Moja, then Backdoor with Mibili, then the compass points with Tano and her <br />
sisters. <br />
<br />
Maxine and Robyn were happy just to get back to Millie faster. And went with Nneli and <br />
Tatuli.  Maxine wasn't quite sure where she had gotten the idea, but she had the strangest <br />
notion of writing down a little note in her own blood to tease Millie about once being <br />
adults and now being teens before Millie, Robyn and herself forgot that no longer <br />
happened. Robyn thought the entire thing was bonkers, but she couldn't help but admit <br />
that Maxine's trick seemed to work. Or at least delay the inevitable. <br />
<br />
Amber took in a deep breath looking out at the island. She remember being turned into <br />
living amber like her namesake and fur color. She remembered being split into two <br />
separate beings each with their own independent minds and awareness. She remembered <br />
the Dance of Chaos and the fulfillment it brought of absolute freedom. She remembered <br />
violently attacking her own packmates and the leomans as if it was all a game leaving <br />
broken bones and internal bleeding in her wake.  She remembered Ami/Amy, Father Paul, <br />
and Miss Serenity's sidekick Trevor destroying Kurse. She remembered being forced back <br />
together, and having to find piece of with the two sides of herself. She saw Big Bad Island <br />
was more beautiful (if somewhat strange) than when the Teen wolves had arrived to build <br />
the pack's secondary home here. <br />
<br />
'Too bad Other-Mother Kurse had to throw all that out of whack along with the experiment <br />
to see on the Gold Deer adapting to new environments...' Amber thought agitated. <br />
<br />
Opal leaned next to Cobalt/Caroline hugging her. &quot;Are you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cobalt/Caroline sighed leaning on him, the teenage wolf said, &quot;It's not fair... Alpha Jensen <br />
gave us this island to look after for him, to be it's care takers... to establish another home <br />
for our pack here... now we have to leave it...&quot; <br />
<br />
The opal colored teen wolf answered, &quot;It's not forever, once the Game is gone from <br />
Glendale and everyone is healed up I'm sure we'll be given another go at it... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Cobalt/Caroline said, &quot;Because I feel like the magic now part of this island is now a <br />
part of us, or maybe we're a part of it, we're not sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cobalt/Caroline shook her head, &quot;You became one again after Kurse was gone... but the <br />
two parts of me had become too unique to fuse back together... but... neither of us wanted <br />
to be without you... so we ended up with one body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you almost stayed like the twins?&quot; Opal tried to play down the situation, &quot;I'm sure they <br />
wouldn't have minded another playmate... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Opal... do the names Jasper, Topaz, Goldie, Luzuli, and Carnelian mean anything to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Names?... I can't say they do... those are the colors of the real twins right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cobalt/Caroline nodded, &quot;Right... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why did you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... not any reason that actually matters anymore... &quot;<br />
<br />
Opal looked Caroline/Cobalt in the eye, &quot;So you're tell me there's two of you in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cobalt/Caroline nodded. &quot;We both care about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it's magic and everything but... I don't think there having two awareness' in one <br />
brain is really healthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right Opal... but ... we're going to become again one NATURALLY, and at our OWN <br />
pace... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry we can keep a secret.&quot; Amber said simply. <br />
<br />
The teen couple started seeing Ulysses, Coral, Amber, Tourmaline, Ruby, Emerald and <br />
Garnet standing all around them. <br />
<br />
&quot;When, how, why-&quot; Opal asked astounded.<br />
<br />
Emerald said sarcastic and deadpan, &quot;Next time you want to reveal a deep secret... do it <br />
more than twenty feet away from your packmates.&quot;<br />
<br />
Opal and Cobalt/Caroline nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;That goes double for us.&quot; Robert said. <br />
<br />
Opal and Cobalt/Caroline looked behind themselves to see Robert, Wendy, Jessica, and <br />
Rose standing there. <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't think we were so oblivious.&quot; Opal sweat dropped. <br />
<br />
Cobalt/Caroline sweat dropped, &quot;We just keep forgetting just so freakin' huge our pack <br />
is...&quot; <br />
<br />
With perfect timing Alice and Abbey came out of the water at the same time that the cubs <br />
also returned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone ready for the Lion King Express?&quot; Nane grinned. <br />
<br />
Tano sighed, &quot;You love that movie way too much.&quot; <br />
<br />
Garnet said, &quot;I'll stay behind for the last trip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amber nodded, &quot;Me too.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tourmaline entered, &quot;I guess I'll stay here too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose rose a paw, &quot;Now hold on, pink wolves stick together kiddo-&quot;<br />
<br />
Tourmaline replied &quot;Don't confuse me with Amber.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amber snapped, &quot;I'm not a pup either!&quot; <br />
<br />
Wendy groaned, &quot;It's a what? Five minute trip at most? I'll wait for the last trip instead, you <br />
can go this turn Tourmaline.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Nu-Wendy.&quot; Tourmaline nodded and bowed slightly. <br />
<br />
Abbey took hold of Caroline/Cobalt's hand, &quot;Okay! Let us go right sister?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed sister.&quot; Alice nodded taking Opal's hand in turn. <br />
<br />
The cubs took a hand of the remaining gem and gallery wolves minus Wendy, Amber and <br />
Garnet and within seconds the three wolves were alone on the island. <br />
<br />
The three of the listened to the surf and the wind through the trees. They looked at the <br />
multicolor landscape of oddly colored rocks and flowers that seemed to change every time <br />
they looked away. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't mind staying here... &quot; Amber said, &quot;No one to mistake me for a pup, always <br />
something new to explore and find out, each day a new adventure in the same place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No giant breasts she-wolves to give you over enthusiastic hugs,&quot; Garnet said, &quot;The <br />
coconuts are easier to dodge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wendy waved her claw, &quot;Now don't either of you two get started. We all have a <br />
responsibility to Alpha-Jensen and Alpha-Kaylee, not to mention the Pack itself and our <br />
packmates...&quot; <br />
<br />
Amber said, &quot;You've got to admit.. this place is enticing... I know the other pack members <br />
just see the aftermath of a war now but... &quot; Amber fell backwards purposely and let the <br />
sand invade her fur not caring how long it would take to get out, &quot;I honestly like it here <br />
now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Wendy said authoritatively, &quot;You can come back once everyone is healed and this mess with <br />
the stupid Game is finally done with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Garnet replied, &quot;Don't talk to us as we're still pups.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not pups, but not adults yet either... I know that's an unfair position to be in... but <br />
do yourselves a favor and enjoy it while it lasts... it won't come again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I know.&quot; Garnet replied leaned down looking at a flower as it transformed and <br />
morphed before her eyes, she leaned down to sniff it. The bud turned into a fairly with a <br />
womanly figure, and a fairy with a child's figure came out of a second bud a moment later, <br />
they handed Garnet a tiny but beautiful flower that grew to full size in seconds... The <br />
fairies giggled then vanished in a shower of sparkles... Garnet saw Amber looking at the <br />
sky and Wendy looking at Amber hadn't seen it. Garnet sighed and put the flower in her <br />
hair. <br />
<br />
Tano and the glass pups appeared a couple moments later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is everyone ready?&quot; Tano asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Garnet said. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, but let's go.&quot; Amber replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, let's go.&quot; Wendy finished wanting to be home. <br />
<br />
Tano took hold of Wendy while Alice and Abbey led Amber and Garnet through the water's <br />
reflective surface, and the island was devoid of Man.  Two spirits now ingrained into the <br />
island from Kurse's ritual would keep the island tame and domesticated until it's legal <br />
owners and de facto mistress returned. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
The first thing all the teen wolves did with the exception of Maxine and Robyn did the <br />
moment they got home was head straight to bed and knock out immediately before hitting <br />
the mattress.  <br />
<br />
The other cubs were waiting politely for their sister and pride mate to return before <br />
reengaging their water war with the twins not knowing yet of their decrease in active <br />
numbers on the other side of the mansion. Saba just wanted to get her wresting match <br />
with Paula back under way. <br />
<br />
Alice curtsied at Moja, Tano, and the other girls in turn saying, &quot;Thank you very much for <br />
keeping your promise to help myself and my sister to transport the herd, and for going <br />
above and beyond your promise by helping move the Grotesques and our packmates too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It was what was civilized Alice, it would be improper for a leoman to do anything less.&quot; <br />
Moja spoke for the others. <br />
<br />
Then Tano added quickly, &quot;And you're welcome.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Please excuse us then, myself and my sister wish to check on our sister Samantha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go right ahead, we're not your Alpha.&quot; Saba said. <br />
<br />
The glass pups then entered the manor, avoiding the medical wing and going straight to <br />
the pup's den ignoring the noise coming from the Omega's den... <br />
<br />
'Good thing this room is sound proof.' Abbey thought seeing the cute sleeping forms of her <br />
half-siblings. 'Or that noise next door would wake them all up.' <br />
<br />
Alice and Abbey silently (as they always were as glass) and entered the mirror that showed <br />
the reflection of the bedroom with Samantha sleeping, fidgeting in her sleep from the <br />
trauma she had suffered. <br />
<br />
Alice and Abbey climbed onto the warm, comfy bed as they slowly moved closer to their <br />
sister, observing her sleeping, rest, dreaming, so peacefully, so wonderfully, so nice.... <br />
<br />
Alice and Abbey fell asleep on the mattress before they knew it. Without the task of <br />
transporting the Herd, their pack, and guardians back to the estate, and now flesh and <br />
blood in the mirror verse for more than a minute... they finally fell asleep and were in <br />
dreamland having tea with walking dictionaries that spoke with Jamaican accents. <br />
<br />
This however had the side effect of them falling right on top of Samantha, which started <br />
her awake.  She shook her head, shaking off the nightmares, and notice her sisters on top <br />
of her, still wearing their dresses. Samantha looked down to see herself in her nightgown... <br />
She looked to see her other half-siblings also sleeping sounding within the protection of <br />
the sound proof walls and the only real door on the inside of the manor. <br />
<br />
Door for the pack of course normally meant only 'opening in the wall to a room' since the <br />
pack really had little to no sense of privacy let alone modesty and the pup's room was the <br />
only room in the entire house with an actual solid 'door.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Curiouser and curiouser.&quot; Samantha said to herself. She saw the time on the clock said six <br />
PM, but she had no idea if that meant today, tomorrow, or yesterday. <br />
<br />
Careful not to disturb her sisters' slumber, and really not wishing to go back to bed, the <br />
dirty blond blue eyed pup changed into her white dress and blue apron that was identical <br />
to that of her sister's.<br />
<br />
Samantha then exited the mirror, her dressing vanishing and her body becoming solid <br />
glass. The living glass in the shape of a wolf pup inched along not making a sound as she <br />
came to the door, slowly opened it and stepped out quietly closed the door behind her as <br />
was the prime and proper thing to do. <br />
<br />
She entered the Omega's room seeing Giselle and Gretchen no longer living solid gold <br />
talking and chatting with...<br />
<br />
&quot;Omega-Abdul? Omega-Maddex? Omega-Ryan?&quot; Samantha said with surprised. <br />
<br />
Martha saw Samantha looking up from her own children and said, &quot;Mistress Samantha! You <br />
should be resting! Your rather specifically wanted you to rest!&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha blinked and said, &quot;But-, I, is that-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is me and the others.&quot; Abdul said, &quot;Mistress Amy and Master Zelipe restored us from <br />
what the game made us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha would have to make a point to thank Amy and Zelipe later. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Samantha.&quot; Giselle said first, &quot;I'm happy to see you're okay again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm... I am quite happy that you and your sister and your father are all back to normal.&quot; <br />
Samantha said though Alice always laughed at the word 'normal.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Sammy.&quot; Giselle replied. Gretchen wasn't letting go of her father for all the tea <br />
in China. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sammy.&quot; Maddex's heads said breaking away from his multi-mate and kneeling down face <br />
to face with the glass pup, &quot;Lilly and Casandra are in the mirror world right now playing <br />
somewhere... I want them to know their daddy is okay... can you please take me to them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha thought about that, &quot;We'd kinda have to look around on our own... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay, I was told they're here at the manor, so please can you?&quot; The two heads of the <br />
silver blush wolf asked his two third eyes looking at her as pleading as his four normal <br />
eyes. One hand on her shoulder, one on his knee, and the other two on the floor. <br />
<br />
Samantha thought about it, then curtsied, &quot;Of course I can Mr. Omega-Maddex... &quot; <br />
Samamntha took Maddex's paw on his knee, then lead him into one of the mirrors placed <br />
all around the manor to make it easier for the glass cubs to come and go as they pleased <br />
when messages needed to travel fast. <br />
<br />
The fact that the pack was willing to let two five year olds, and a seven and half year old be <br />
potentially looking at them at any time anywhere within the manor and hadn't even <br />
thought of giving even the slightest pep of complaint said volumes of the pack's total lack <br />
of the concept of 'privacy.' <br />
<br />
Giselle and Gretchen waved their 'uncle' off still holding onto their father like glue.  <br />
<br />
Another revision to reality concern the twins not coming in on their parents love making <br />
and actually stopping in time to actually ask to come in. What price would be extracted <br />
from this was anyone's guess. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Kathy wondered how to answer her mother's question, like any person (not just women) the <br />
experience of nearly being overpowered and being violated wasn't something she wanted <br />
to share due to a false sense of shame. <br />
<br />
Felman were much smaller than Leomans, and on average were a little smaller than <br />
humans and simply not as physically strong as the naked ape. In spite of this seemingly <br />
physical disadvantages, this hadn't changed one fundamental part of Kathy's personality, <br />
one that had remained with her though all of this. <br />
<br />
Kathy was prejudice. She had been prejudice in believing humans in particular cats were <br />
superior to humans before. And she believed that now. Her recent misadventure and <br />
ordeals had done nothing to change this way of thinking one iota. In fact, now she saw <br />
Lupmans, Leomans, and Felmans as superior to humans, (not capitalized), and Leomans <br />
and Felmans as superior to Lupmans, and Felmans as superior to Leomans.  <br />
<br />
She still remembered transforming her parents, brothers, the mailman, and others into <br />
Felmans,(and in the case of her brother dragon-felman hybrids) with infinite uses of the <br />
dreaded game of Transform or Dare that were now very much gone from her (she had <br />
checked). Kathy considered this an upgrade for them all even if for her brothers it was a <br />
half-upgrade.<br />
<br />
 But as far as her own memories told her now, she had always been felman, a strange piece <br />
of medical confusion considering how in the old reality her family had been all humans. <br />
Being able to speak with cats but being intimidated by Leomans she soon adopted their <br />
sense of racial superiority. Even their religion to Bast (as was obvious from her use of the <br />
word rather than the traditional spelling Bastet). <br />
<br />
She had too much pride to tell her family about her near rape at the hands of the human <br />
goon. And since she had always been a felman, her family had not that reason to move out <br />
of Glendale. Instead they now moved when the local scrutiny and their family asking again <br />
and again if Kathy was really her father's child (which she very much was in any and all <br />
timelines) had reached the breaking point. <br />
<br />
&quot;There was some human who wouldn't accept that I was telling him 'bug off' but he <br />
wouldn't take a hint but the cub came out of nowhere and gave him a bite and scared him <br />
off.&quot;  Kathy Clintoned. <br />
<br />
Her mother replied. &quot;That sounds a little harsh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't, trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother had called Wanda's home, but had only gotten her answering machine. Having <br />
no clue that the recent chaos that struck over a million people world wide was caused by <br />
the curse of Glendale they thought they had left behind of course she didn't connect the <br />
two. She did leave Wanda a message. She tried Wanda's cellphone but got a similar result <br />
(Wanda was sleeping and her cell phone was back at the station anyway since she hadn't <br />
exactly taken it into battle).  Another message was left on the cell phone. <br />
<br />
Anne with a captive audience was reading her copy of the bible aloud to the recovering <br />
lupmen and leomen. Christians present were surprised that it contained the assassination <br />
of a military officer in his sleep by the woman who had just offered him rest. Many non-<br />
christians presents were very surprised that it contained more than 'burn in Hell if you're <br />
not one of us' in fact... it contained a lot more... <br />
<br />
Michelle due to the nature of her Transform was able to read through the bible faster than <br />
Anne was reading it. She found it to be rather interesting all things considered. <br />
<br />
Gamma-Zack had said how Anne was weird for treating everyone as though they were <br />
pack and pack members as if they were part of her subpack. And seemed to be teaching <br />
that way of thinking to her four adopted pups. <br />
<br />
Anne would often reply how, &quot;Being altruistic, isn't about just returning favors and repaying <br />
debts.&quot; Anne quoted the lamb himself saying, &quot;Even sinners, are grateful to acts of <br />
kindness done onto them.&quot; <br />
<br />
Then the adult she-wolf heard, &quot;You give people more credit than I do little girl. There are <br />
people who see kindness as blackhole does light, something never to be returned.&quot; <br />
<br />
Anne turned and dropped her bible. &quot;Mother Glenn?&quot;<br />
<br />
She, along with Julie and Darla, Joy and Ingrid, and the mending pride and back members <br />
who could turn their heads saw the giant lioness step into the medical wing with Mary <br />
being her forerunner who immediately ran to her parents. <br />
<br />
Four more leomans followed behind her subserviently, it was Penny and Kirk's parents.  <br />
with Laura and Zulema flanking Mary. The moment they saw the two three headed six <br />
armed six breasts, six tailed identical twins they immediately ran to one that looked <br />
identical to the other and cheered. &quot;MOMMY! YOU'RE YOU AGAIN!&quot; Laura and Zulema <br />
cheered tears of joy not caring they were shouting in sync for once. <br />
<br />
&quot;My babies!&quot; Ingrid knelt down crying and hugged her daughters, pressing them against <br />
the red cross on her chest. <br />
<br />
Yamato tried to get up to greet her formally and failed miserably. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mother Glenn.&quot; All the leomen said seeing her. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
As Kirk recounted his life, details being a little bit different each time, Amy came over to <br />
Penny and Kirk again. <br />
<br />
Amy said nothing at first, but offered the wheelchair bound a small book, a ink pen and an <br />
empty ink well from who knows where. Kirk just kept recounting, almost as if in a trance <br />
now. <br />
<br />
Amy said, &quot;Pierce your skin, draw blood, and write with your own blood. The rules reality <br />
goes by prevents injuries, scars, coming into existence, and death of a person from being <br />
adverted.  This means anything you write in your own blood will remain because it counts <br />
as the immediate result of an injury...&quot; She raised up a paw showing a scar on the padding, <br />
&quot;I've tested it already.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This might then just turn into fiction.&quot; Penny said, but at the same time, her eyes misting <br />
up more, but this time almost in joy. <br />
<br />
&quot;It might ... it might not... but it's a record of how things were or rather never were... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Penny asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;You still remember, for now, like me. You also knows it's wrong but unavoidable and <br />
uncheatable what's become of existence: your Pride, my Pack, the Herd, all of them were <br />
just strangers in the old reality... now we are all a unique brand of family... something <br />
beautiful... to destroy one thing, merely to recreate another thing is wrong if the current <br />
has a value unto itself... but that doesn't mean that value of the previous should be <br />
ignored... it should be acknowledge... write down everything about the Kathy you knew, <br />
everything about the Penn you were, everything you remember about your fellow police <br />
before they became Pride... everything... as I do the same for my Pack and the Gargoyles <br />
and what little there is to tell about the Gold Deer...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe I am the reincarnation of a Shinto Priestess who spoke out against Nippon's entry <br />
into the second world war and died when the bombs were dropped... if I am more than <br />
that... I don't know, maybe it's part of divine intent that I don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny chose not to argue the point. It wasn't wroth it. Not now. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are welcome.&quot; Amy bowed and left Penny with Kirk who not broken out of his recount <br />
once. <br />
<br />
Penny used one of her claws, cut open her paw, and let the blood drip into the ink well, and <br />
then began to write about Kathy's childhood when she had dressed up as a pixie <br />
Glowbright cartoon character for Halloween. Princess Barbie the next year with a special <br />
plastic/rubber head mask, and Wonder Woman the year after that, and a witch the year <br />
after that, and pixie the year after that, and Princess Leia from Starwars the year after that, <br />
and a two person My Little Pony with her best friend, two other girls (a pair of sisters) had <br />
gone with a more realistic horse costume and had lamented about wishing it was even <br />
more realistic so they could win the school prize when a boy in too good a goblin costume <br />
had asked them Transform or Dare... and the poor confused terrified mare with two <br />
separate minds in it was disrupting the party half an hour later with their human mother <br />
crying her eyes out at the loss of her children to the game. <br />
<br />
Penny cringed at that but continued to write, feeling sick remembering a horse at a ranch <br />
she had visited that had acted bipolar but very -very- smartly. 'Father Mike, Father Paul, <br />
PLEASE... make enough of that cure already to finnish this!!!' <br />
<br />

<br />
Running-Bear didn't sense anything unnatural about this animal, it was a cat pure and <br />
simple, but at the same time, there was a strange feeling of wrongness about it. A slightly <br />
out of phase of 'not right' underneath the layers that were in perfect alignment with <br />
creation and the rest of the natural world. <br />
<br />
He had gone around one twist and turn too many, getting rude gesture and harsh words <br />
from people he ran past, with more than a few saying he didn't belong where he was. He <br />
didn't care. But he didn't like how long this was taking. He needed to get back to his <br />
foster-daughters soon. He didn't want them to be left alone for too long, he was worried <br />
for them like any good guardian should be. <br />
<br />
Finally, Joseph calmed his mind, thinking of how the wrongness was moving, seeing if <br />
there was any pattern at all... there didn't seem to be... except it never repeated the same <br />
step twice... which was very much a matter in of itself... this meant... he did his best to <br />
herd the animal he was chasing looking like a fool. Finally he led it where he knew were <br />
two spaces between houses both shaped like a capital T... which mean if the cat went <br />
one... it had to go... THAT WAY! <br />
<br />
There was no where for it to run now... the animal, a black cat, seemed very much <br />
surprised to hint herself boxed in. <br />
<br />
The first thing to come out of Runner Bear's mouth was, the most logical thing he could <br />
ask. If he asked who, he'd just get a name. If he asked what, he wouldn't know if his girls <br />
were truly in danger. So instead asked, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Being better than you.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Idiot.' He berated himself, 'Never, ever, expect a cat to EVER give a straight answer!' <br />
<br />
That was when the cat used the walls to jump from one edge of a corner to the other and <br />
up over the wall and onto a roof and out of sight.. and suddenly he couldn't sense it <br />
anymore. Like it was never even there. <br />
<br />
'Jesus save us.' Running-Bear silently prayed. <br />
<br />

<br />
In 1673. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;T-t-th-thank y-you...&quot; Marie Cruz said as the Grotesque kindly put her down. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I... I.. that is... I'm happy you saved me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's what I'm here for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her godfather came next to her and said, &quot;You don't think I'd put you though that training <br />
without having something ready in case the rope failed did you?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Marie the wolf pup said, &quot;Marie no idea she was being watched.. her godfather wanted her <br />
to conquer that fear.&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie and Mutt both looked at each other. She then looked back at the Grotesque, &quot;Thank <br />
you Mr....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vatican, my name is Vatican... and no Mr. please.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Vatican? Are you from the church?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sort of... it's where I rest and where I protect... thus that is my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is how Grotesque name themselves Marie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Marie said taking that bit of information in. <br />
<br />
Mutt just tried to process what his sense of smell was telling him was just rock was moving <br />
on it's own... and the skeleton in the corner throwing a hissy fit and then stomping out the <br />
door. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if I should now change my name to Marie then.&quot; Said the male gargoyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;HUH?&quot; Marie blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We name ourselves after what we protect... and I just protected you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... but I'm Marie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not the only person in the world named that dear.&quot; Her godfather said, he then <br />
looked at the Grotesque, &quot;But that would cause too much confusion I think...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Vatican said, &quot;Still... &quot; The Gargoyle shook his head. &quot;Oh whatever... I am simply <br />
glade to be of service.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As am I.&quot; Her godfather said. &quot;Marie, stay here with Mutt for a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Godfather.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Grotesque and holyman often disguised as a plague doctor spoke to each other once <br />
out of earshot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that I've saved her I must know. You humans normally keep your females completely <br />
away from fighting... why are you teaching this pebble to fight then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... She will be drawn into my world weather I like it or not, and I will not be there to <br />
protect her... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should give her to a real family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did... she ran away and came back here twice through the extra security on both ends... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn't bring myself to lie to her and tell her I didn't love her... that weakness with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is not a weakness.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Depends on who you ask.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Their business with the Wises done, the witchlings did their work with Joella. <br />
<br />
Joella was near catatonic from the attempt of making her mind into that of a child with <br />
matching memories by the three witches, they had simply gone about it in simply too <br />
forceful a way... leaving much inside broken. <br />
<br />
The tramatized little girl didn't notice when her clothes vanished, or that she stopped <br />
breathing, or that she was getting smaller again, or that her body turned green... or a <br />
pillar rose up underneath her that her legs hung down. In a matter of moments there was a <br />
half-scale jade statue of a naked little girl swinging her legs over the edge of the marble <br />
pillar she was on that no business being in the house of a puritan perhaps. <br />
<br />
She -did- however feel Goldwyn touch her, yes, Goldwyn, that was her name. <br />
<br />
&quot;I promise Joella, we'll be back for you and have you a good little girl soon!&quot; <br />
<br />
Joella, yes, that was her name. But what was she again? Have he a good little girl? Did that <br />
mean she was a bad little girl? Did it means she was a good little boy? Did it mean she was <br />
a big girl? Joella felt confused. <br />
<br />
The witchlings quickly left the house and met up with Princess, who was happy to hear that <br />
the Wises were now with their family, but told the girls going back to the Wises now would <br />
bring up too much suspcion from their foster father and they'd have to wait. <br />
<br />
&quot;But we promised Joella we'd be back soon!&quot; Giselle protested. <br />
<br />
&quot;And you will, and you will, but not right now. You're not breaking your promise, so you're <br />
not being like adults. You didn't say how soon was after all.&quot; Princess said. <br />
<br />
The witchlings nodded at this. <br />
<br />
Of course, unlike their children, the Wises could not simply cease to exist, too much, too <br />
many events, too many factors, too many people, simply too much was theirs alone. So the <br />
house didn't suddenly come under new ownership.<br />
<br />
&quot;Running-Bear at the time,&quot; Marie said, &quot;Didn't put the vanishing of the Wises together <br />
with that of the girls, after all, the Wises had done nothing evil to the girls, so he thought <br />
there was no reason they'd harm them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty said, &quot;So naturally, he'd have no reason to think they'd alter them into animals and <br />
statues thinking it was a good thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The black dressed Marie nodded, &quot;Exactly. However, since the Wises up and vanished, and <br />
of course with no heirs, their property went to other family remembers and creditors... and <br />
that meant some items were just sold off... including...&quot; <br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY! You can't sell that! That's our friend!&quot; Declared Goldwyn holding Princess a month <br />
later. <br />
<br />
The labor man looked down at her calmly and sternly. He put down the statue and pillar it <br />
was set into and looked at the child and her two friends. &quot;Look kid, I don't know what <br />
games you played with this thing, but it doesn't belong to you and it's already marked for <br />
auction, I'm just doing my job.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She... is... my friend... I made... a promise...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I made a promise too to make sure this statue made it to auction so too bad...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Is... that ... so...&quot; Goldwyn said sounding very angry. Gita and Giselle were startled by this, <br />
even Princess, normally Gita was the one to bursts of hot headedness. <br />
<br />
Holding Princess tight, to the point of almost brusing the cat, Goldwyn tapped into the <br />
infinite chaos. <br />
<br />
The man was suddenly paralyzed, unable to do more than panic and think. And panic he <br />
did as he clothes vanished leaving him naked on this fine spring day making him blush. <br />
Then his body shrunk down, gaining baby fat and his muscle vanishing as he came a little <br />
boy now eye level with the girl holding... where did that cat come from? And YIKES! Why <br />
did that girl have the face of a skull-?!<br />
<br />
Suddenly he was no simply paralyzed, but rigid, his body... was now... stone? Next the <br />
shape changed.. it was not as noticeable at the age he was at but.. was he... was she now a <br />
girl? Suddenly he became smaller, much smaller than the girls in front of him, then she sat <br />
down, and suddenly something rose out of the ground bringing her back up almost to their <br />
level... she... she was a statue? A nice statue that was going to be auctioned off just like <br />
was promised? That... that was good... yes.. because one has to keep their promises... Her <br />
mind began to fill with images of being a pretty gallery with fellow art or being in a garden <br />
somewhere or decorating a pier seeing the ships come sailing in the morning... She never <br />
noticed the auction tag vanishing from the other statue onto the herself. <br />
<br />
The three girls together lifted Joella leaving the identical statue behind to be found by <br />
another worker wondering why no one was moving this stuff yet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Said two voices together. <br />
<br />
Marie turned her head breaking out of her story as she saw Samantha (who she knew from <br />
them both having been Kurse's daughter Glass), and a two headed, four armed, two tailed, <br />
silver with blue highlights lupman with a eye in his foreheads. <br />
<br />
&quot;... My name is Marie.&quot; said the blond and blue eyed wolf pup. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;PAPA!&quot; Lilly and Casandra declared bumping heads as they ran towards them, got up and <br />
ran away. He picked up one in each set of arms. &quot;IS that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only me.&quot; The two head said together one looking at each other. <br />
<br />
Lawrence and Betty stared in amazement at the restored Omega.</p>
