<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff’s father looked to this program and was amazed by what it does. A program that can actual change a person or thing into whatever he wants. The possibilities are endless. So much so, that he wanted to do something that he wish to do.<br />
<br />
But before he could do it, he asked Jeff to leave for a moment.  Turning to his son, he told him, “Hey Jeff? Can you get down to living room to watch the game while a stay here for a moment? There’s something I need to do here that is a bit private.” Jeff looked to his father and was a little confused by his request. Normally he wants to see what his father wants to do with the Chronivac and what it was. Maybe he thought dad wanted to do something that was private.  Shrugging his shoulders, he decided to leave him be. “Alright… Whatever you say dad.” He said to his father, “I need to go to the bathroom anyways before I head on down. Just don’t take too long.” He soon walked away from his computer and left his room, leaving his father alone in his son room.<br />
<br />
Once he was gone, Mike approached the computer that’s running the Chronivac and looked through his many options.  That’s when he discovered something that caught his eyes, ‘Time Travel Package.’  Clicking on it, a message appeared and says…<br />
<br />
‘Welcome to the Time Travel Package. This is where you choose whether to go back to the past and forward into the future. Your options depend on how you want to time travel. Here are some good examples:<br />
<br />
Option 1: Age Time Travel<br />
<br />
This options let’s you regress or progress your age while traveling back and forth through time. All you have to do is select the desired age in your past or future and the Chronivac will take you to that time and age. You have to option to have the mentality of your own being on or off or whether you want a time duration if you want to return to original age or permanently remain on that time period with the age you selected. Just a brief warning before you choose this option. If you want to travel to the past with your age and try to change it, do it with caution. Because to slightest change can alter your present and future in a big way. So please choose this at your own risk.<br />
<br />
Option 2: Reality Time Travel<br />
<br />
This option lets you and the entire planet go back in time to into the future, warping reality along with it. Here’s an example, if you choose a time in the western period, you and your family would live, act, and do things that western people do. If you go forward into the future, then your family would live, act, and do things in the future. Again, you would have the option of whether or not you wish to return to your current time period or change your mental state.<br />
<br />
Option 3: History Lesson Time Travel<br />
<br />
This option is really popular for high school students and college students whenever they have a History Test and they don’t have time to study or in need of more information. It’s simple to manage. Just select the time in history you wish to see and the Chronivac will take you to that time period. Now I know that you will be worried about you entering a certain period in time and there will be people who will notice you. But don’t worry; we had already taken care of that problem. See, when you go back to the past, you will go back as a ghost of yourself. It’s a projected self that is invisible to those around you, meaning anyone from the past won’t see you. You will feel safe and secure without worry about people looking at you strangely.<br />
<br />
And there you have it. Just a few good options for you to time travel. Please remember that we’re not responsible for anything you would do once you go to the past or future. Just be careful on what you would choose and have fun. Thank you for reading this.’<br />
<br />
Looking to this, he smiled and said, “There it is, just what I need to live the life I wanted.”<br />
<br />
See, when Mike got married and had three kids, apart of him realized that he missed out on so much before hand.  There were so many things in his single life that he wanted to do, he would’ve lived his dreams or get girls of his own before seeing his wife.  Long story short, he wanted to live a far better life then he currently has.  And there were times he wished that he would travel back in time and did the things he always wanted.<br />
<br />
Sure a part of him means while Jeff, George, and Amy will cease to exist and his wife will marry someone else if he choose the girl he wanted.  Not that he hated his family, as he does care for them.  But these are small sacrifices to restart his life a new with a different outcome.  So looking through his options, he decided to get started on getting himself back in time to live his life long dream.<br />
<br />
Already, he choose the Age Time Travel option as he and the world around him will go back to whatever age and year he wants to live.  Soon after he typed it, another message appeared when the next page opens.  That reads…<br />
<br />
‘Thank you for choosing the Age Time Travel Option. How it works is simple. This option lets you go back and forth through time as you age or regress to a specific year in that time period. All you need to do is pick a certain year (whether it be in the past of the future) and the Chronivac will take you to that time with your new age. Not only that, your clothes and the world around you will alter to match the age and year. You can even decided to mentally change yourself, make you aware or not the duration of the trip, and as a interesting option, decide to stay in that time period or return to your original time. Makes this program very interesting. Enjoy this trip through time.<br />
<br />
Warning!<br />
<br />
If you enter the past, careful with what you do. Any small action you make in the past will permanently alter your future. So choose wisely. Also, do not go too far back in the past or too forward in the future. Just go to the time to when you are conceived to a hundred. If you go too far in between you might either cease to exist or die incredibly old. The Chronivac is not responsible for the death or unconception of the user. So please be cautious when choosing your years.<br />
<br />
Enjoy, and thank your for using Chronivac 4.0.’<br />
<br />
Mike read the message, including the warning, but he didn’t mind.  His plan was to go back to the past and stay there, going through life all over again, but in a different path.  So he won’t have to worry about any consequences if he doesn’t goes back to the future.<br />
<br />
With a bit of a smile, he continued to move on, typing all the information he needed, including the year and age he choose.  Still, he hopes his son doesn’t arrive too early to see this.  Otherwise, it would get complicated.</p>
