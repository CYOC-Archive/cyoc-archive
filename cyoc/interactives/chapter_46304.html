<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“ Aging Metabolism “<br />
<br />
Jon dreaming had seen and retained vivid memories of what he saw were as knowledge when he awoke, finding his own body as assaulted by many changes. His seeing himself changed and what was different, continued to conform to his soon to be new species. He sat up and noticed quite quickly his expanding chest and a ripped shirt that the sound of it tearing had awakened him.<br />
<br />
Seeing was believing, as having seen how one student racked by fast changes, he became as a highly sensual donkey, seemingly enjoying his animalistic transformation.<br />
<br />
Learned and quite logical of a person, teacher Jon wondered if the younger age and hearty metabolism of one so young did work well with the transforming, making it happen faster.<br />
<br />
When Jon sat there and had the mental alertness to check of his own body, he seeing how he had begun to change too, he had an epiphany.<br />
<br />
“ Transformation happening to those of matured years might then occur at a slower pace due to the slackening pace of the body and its aging metabolism!”<br />
<br />
An expanding chest on Jon and the subsequent changes as to skin becoming a thicker sort of animal hide, and from it grew fur, it too, thick but rather coarse to the touch. Stroking a hand to the furry chest, Jon liked the sensations he felt, and being a logical man by nature, he knew this should frighten him, but it had the opposite effect.<br />
<br />
Discomforting the feelings, he combing his fingers threw fur actually growing upon his own body, caused then a purely animal reaction to delighted sensation, he began to feel an arousal moving in his groin.<br />
<br />
This disturbed Jon greatly, he leaping up from off the couch, stood then feeling a rush of excitement helping to unfold what he felt as expanding. Distention of his maleness from within a sheath, it having grown to be as an unique part with his lower abdomen, this raised his already heightened sense of sensual delight.<br />
<br />
Quickly did he use his hands to press down his dress slacks from their covering his waist and legs, allowing the pants to flop in a pile about his ankles and feet.<br />
<br />
Protruding past the elastic band of his underwear, the sheath creased the material, but his arousal stood past there, building in length, girth, and stout to the task of sometime mating with another of his then kind. Having seen the reaction to stroking of the aroused big male organ, Jon did not touch it, but let the thing inflate, it hanging large and loose did stiffen, as it stood then to come equal in height to stand hovering near his still human mouth.<br />
<br />
Jon knew of his having libido like nothing he had known was his before! Seeing it and the radical feelings coming from having such a huge new male organ was a major distraction from the concerns of how else he had so changed. The expansion of his rib cage and chest in general, helped to add new bulk and girth to his lower abdomen too. This added rotundas big belly helped to keep the aroused penis from coming to bump at nervous lips and a mouth suggesting he should suck at his own self. <br />
<br />
A furry belly held the monster organ away and at bay, but as it graced to the furry belly, the sensation of this became a new and delighted distraction of its own.<br />
<br />
Aroused in these new ways, Jon noted he had begun to hyperventilate, this helped to excite him, letting flow the accursed adrenaline; a natural hormone secreted to aid in the fight/flight pattern. <br />
<br />
Renewal of body strength lost due to age did aid and guide the transforming agents to work in many areas all to once. Bulking of torso, Jon felt his neck beginning to thicken, it seemed as if longer, while his groin, testicles, rump and of that back there did sense the surge of change.<br />
<br />
Thinking of his sudden urge of thirst, Jon stepped out of his pants, walking with a strange stance, went to the kitchen sink and turned on the faucet. He stood for a long moment trying how best he should try and get a drink. Jon made note of the coffee mug there by the sink, but something in him said the use of this was not possible. He eyed the spin-n-grin, and reached a hand at this, giving it a turn, did plug the drain, allowing the water to fill the sink.<br />
<br />
Minutes passed, and Jon felt a heightened sense of anxiety, he having to wait for some time as the sink filled slowly. Yet when it reached the overflow limit, Jon shut down the faucet, and leaned forward, bringing his then thickening lips and mouth to try and suck up the life giving liquid.<br />
<br />
Drinking in this fashion, Jon had a sudden realization of how he was drinking and how it varied from doing it as he had done it in the recent past. Ceasing to drink in this way, he raised himself upright, stood for a moment and then sensing something as drastically wrong, he began to touch and feel with hands and fingers to his then changing head.<br />
<br />
Anxiety turned to a sense of personal horror, as Jon discovered his skull had begun to change, it conforming so quickly to being likened to that of a donkey. Rushing hands and roaming fingers took a inventory as to what all had changed, and was then still changing. Blurry eyes, a new sense of smelling of scents, a mouth and tongue lacked then in flavor tasting ability. The thought of interminable sessions of daily grazing and the ingesting of pounds of greenery, Jon normally disliked eating of salads, knew that such would become his primary menu.<br />
<br />
Excited and as well upset, Jon would have whimpered a cry of anguish, yet from a changing neck, throat, and mouth, his disgruntled cry came as a soft braying sound.<br />
<br />
“Hee,” the sound Jon then made as he inhaled, and a reacting “Haw,” sound he made as he would exhale as brashly as he did inhale air to breathe and make his one basic manner of communicating.<br />
<br />
Jerking from the painful feeling around back and above his bigger behind, Jon shrieked a “Hee,” he feeling the sudden protrusion of his growing tail bone. As of then most of his changing transformation came without any pain, save that of mental anguish over the loss of his human bodily self. Anger and anxiety mixed as pain nagged at him, it reminding Jon of what he thought logically, as how having a tail, was the truest idiotic difference between mankind and the animals.<br />
<br />
Ignoring his gripped hand holding him standing by the kitchen counter, Jon turned, thinking to walk away, only discovering quite quickly how his legs and feet were in their own manner of transforming. Falling face first, he slammed his thicker chin on the linoleum floor. Sprawled out on the floor, the slam knocked the wind out of him, he felt that lousy adrenaline flowing again, and then a surge of more change.</p>
