<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Can anyone tell me the name of Hamlet’s father?” Mr. Cornigel asked while scanning across the room of grade twelve English students. Most of them were lost in space, texting under their desks, or otherwise not paying attention. So after a few seconds of silence he just called one of them out, “Becky please answer the question.”<br />
<br />
Becky immediately froze and stared blankly at him while her phone was held aloft on her lap. Me. Cornigel smirked and turned his attention from student to student and all of the graduating class gave the same lost and vacant expression until his eyes fell on the trump card, a student, who without fail got every question right on the rare chance she was called on.<br />
<br />
“Haley! What is Hamlet’s father’s name?” He asked and the girl froze with her eyes going wide and a massive blush forming on her cheeks. She slumped downwards awkwardly as if making herself smaller would make him shift his attention elsewhere. He knew better than to shift it away. Instead he held it on the shy girl until she rose up again and cleared her throat.<br />
<br />
“His name is also Hamlet,” She eventually answered in a very quiet and polite tone that could barely be heard over the ventilation system. He remained quiet and waited. Haley’s blush deepened and she cleared her throat again before speaking up but a little louder, “His name is also Hamlet.”<br />
<br />
“Correct,” Mr. Cornigel nodded before moving his vision from Haley and asking a few more tricky questions until the bell rang. Then everyone collected their books and walked out the door.<br />
<br />
Haley gave a silent sigh of relief as she walked through the loud hallway and eventually hit her locker. People blabbered about the biggest parties that weekend while she put her textbooks away and put several in her backpack. She had her final English exam on Monday and needed to study. There were four major finals total. English 30, Math 30, Biology 30, and Social Studies 30 spread across the week and she could get zeroes in every exam and still pass her classes. The only truly dreadful thing she had been worried about had passed at the graduation ceremony the week prior. She had stood up in her slim and beautiful Blue dress and approached a podium before hundreds of parents. She had fought through her anxiety and stutter and delivered the valedictorian speech to the audience with her voice amplified by a microphone and her mother crying in the audience. She had then skipped any graduation parties and spent the evening at home where the most annoying thing was her sister Jezelle and her three daughters. Jez barely paid them any attention and spent the whole day downing so much alcohol the attention was eventually shifted off Haley to her drunk sister. Otherwise it had been nice. Mom had gone through three graduations so far plus an extra one for Veronica thanks to her graduation from university. It had gone smoothly and without issue.<br />
<br />
She could totally freeze up during her finals and flunk them but she wanted hundreds on them and knew she could get them. The weekend would be pretty easy and her main goal was to finish “Lucille’s tales” a collection of adventures centred around an immortal woman experiancing three hundred years of change, prosperity, poverty, and disaster that wracked a fictional and magical kingdom. In the last chapter the head of the Dragonfang Sages has usurped the power of his fellows and crowned himself emperor of the kingdom. Haley wanted to find out what happened next and how big of an effect it would have on Lucille.<br />
<br />
It was then while she filled her locker with textbooks she didn’t need and her backpack with textbooks she did that one of the boys in class shut his locker and noticed her. Haley had always been a girl in clothing two sizes too big or ill suited for her modest frame. She was tall and thin with minute curves but those curves were still impressively perfect for her body. Somehow she made breasts somewhere between a large A-cup and small B -Cup more attractive than any D-cup pornstar or large ass shaking classmate he knew. Haley had a modest but nice ass and it was protruding outwards as she dug into her locker. It had been at the start of the year, after Candice and Izzy had graduated, that he noticed the quiet girl was actually attractive. It was because Haley was suddenly wearing clothes she bought herself. The sweaters remained huge but during the summer her fashion style could finally be seen. Jeans that didn’t need a belt to be held up and didn’t hang over the backs of her shoes and shirts that fit her snugly and were always coloured brightly. From purples to reds they framed her small breasts amazingly and made her slim shoulders look even better. There was nothing slutty or attention grabbing from her and when she had shown up on graduation day she had stuck out amidst the girls. No enormous dress that made it hard to sit and so little makeup she was the only one who didn’t look like she was made of plastic. But she hadn’t come to the party and all this guy, named Frankie, could think of was inviting her to a party and discovering she had a wild side. The mere thought of the quiet girl who blushed when talked to dancing on a table with a multitude of drinks in her was such a hot thought that Frankie got a slight erection and decided to go through with his thought. He walked up to Haley’s locker and stopped next to it. She shut it and suddenly noticed him, taking a step back, going very quiet, and blushing heavily.<br />
<br />
“How are you today Haley?” He asked and she swallowed nervously.<br />
<br />
“Um, good,” she replied quietly while her neck began to lower into her shoulders and said shoulders crash in. She was trying to make herself as small as possible so he put a hand on her shoulder and she froze. This only made Frankie’s resolve to get the quiet girl to let loose grow tenfold. She didn’t know what to do and her blush only depended when he smiled at her and opened his mouth.<br />
<br />
“I wanted to invite you to a party at my place tonight, it starts at eight. Be late,” Frankie announced and Haley’s mouth opened in shock. Frankie decided to throw one last thing in to make sure her social anxiety worked in his favour, “Hope to see you there!”<br />
<br />
With that he let go of her shoulder and Haley was left with her mouth agape and staring at the distance rather blankly, completely unsure of how to process this development.</p>
