<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex was nervous for he was unsure as to tell Zack on what he wanted him to become, not to mention on how he would respond this. &quot;So, what kind of fox thing do you want me to be for justa year?&quot; Zack asked as he was wanting to know on what Alex fox fetish thing he wanted him to be for a temporary one year thing that Alex gulped down a swallow, before he answered quietly the first time around.<br />
<br />
&quot;it&#39;s a mix request, but your body is an anthro fox biker girl with your mind in the body of a sports motorcycle.&quot; Zack didn&#39;t quite understood to what his brother had said, so he asked to repeat on what he said. as a result that Alex repeated his answer for Zack was to become an antho fox biker girl for his body while his mind was going to be placed in the form of a red sports motor bike, but spoke up louder for Zack to hear this time around. Zack wasn&#39;t sure to what his brother was talking about that he brought up a small pitcher on the web from the site called deviantart by hardboildchicken as this person had it titled by the name wolf motorcycle and showed it to him, explaining to him on what he wanted Zack yo be for a year.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? You serious?&quot; Zack asked, checking to see if he heard his brother right about this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want your body to become an anthro fox biker girl while your mind is placed inside the body of a red sports motor bike. besides, you did say that you would be anything for at least a year.&quot; Alex answered very embarrassed about this now.<br />
<br />
&quot;well, alright then. Could be interesting.&quot; Zack said smiling as he was punching the information in.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seriously going to be an anthro fox biker girl with your mind in the body of a red sports motor bike, just for me for a year?&quot; Alex asked surprised while feeling super embarrassed on what his brother was agreeing to become as for his request. while making his setting on the Chronivac to become what his brother wanted that he set it as a temperately one year thing, along with the other settings for Alex.<br />
<br />
Subject: Zack Smithson<br />
Object: mental mind in the body of a red sports motor bike, physical body is turned into an anthro fox biker girl<br />
Reality Shift: On<br />
Aware: On<br />
Pleasurable: Off<br />
Time as: 1 year<br />
Change Time: 15 minutes<br />
lover: Alex Smithson<br />
Those Aware of Reality Shift: Alex Smithson & Zack Smithson&#39;s mind<br />
<br />
Zack then said mischievously &quot;besides, If I love this enough that I&#39;ll might become it this permanently. just for you, after the year ends.&quot;<br />
<br />
it&#39;s true that Zack was going to be something in which involves a fox for Alex and something inanimate for himself, yet something was missing about this. Alex was thinking about this for a moment while wondering as to why he was naked for this when Alex came up with an idea of Zack&#39;s body having a mind of its own. he also thought about Zack&#39;s body being a bit younger to be a bit closer to Alex&#39;s age that before Zack started it up, he told him his idea. Zack was soon finish typing what his brother wanted for the basics, even if he was going to be it for a year that Alex stopped him for a sec, before he entered it in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zack, wait! could you make a few more change before you start your transformation?&quot; Alex asked his brother. this made Zack wonder to what these changes were.<br />
<br />
&quot;sure bro. What did you had in mine?&quot; Zack asked wondering.<br />
<br />
&quot;first off, could you make the anthro fox biker girl a bit younger? somewhat to the same age as me. It&#39;ll be weird to know you&#39;re my brother who&#39;s maybe older then what I am, if the two of us decide to go on a date or something. also, I want your body she&#39;ll be using to have a mind of her very own. can you do those things for me?&quot; Alex asked his brother Zack that to his surprise, he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sense I&#39;m going to be her red sports motor bike that I might as well give this fox a mind of her own, at least for a year from now. i&#39;ll even give her a life style as she&#39;s been with you since childhood upon the third grade.&quot; Zack said that he set the settings in.<br />
<br />
for starters, her name was going to be Aj Maria fox as she&#39;s a kind biker with a tough girl act and has a crush on Alex Smithson to call him her boyfriend. she was born an anthro fox as she was raised while also moved by her parents who now live in the forest of a wooden cottage to this day. here. she has a night-shift job of being a waitress at a local bar while also being in a biker gang called the red skulls that she dose street race at nights. during the day however, she dose go to school regularly as she dose help out on a farm ranch during the summers. despite being half of a fox that she dose not have the true animal language, to understand to what they&#39;re saying as she dose get her rabies shots from the vets while treating her favorite first motor bike like it was her motor baby for she dose let Alex ride on it when she&#39;s on it for they even made out on the sports bike last night under the stars, near the rood fenced hills. she is legal of age to start drinking beers and wines to also smoke, thankfully she doesn&#39;t. she also have two older brothers and an older sister with a little brother and sister that come by to see how she&#39;s doing in life, despite Aj being the fourth born in line. all and all, she turned out to be ok while living under the Smithson family house.<br />
<br />
&quot;wow! that&#39;s some work you put into there.&quot; Alex said while impressed by his typing skills that he soon got up off his chair to look at his brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it was nice being your brother, while it lasted Alex.&quot; Zack said that with a smile, Zack then hit enter as it then began. Zack know that this was going to one happy year as more of his memories were being rewritten into the body of a red sports motorcycle while Zack&#39;s body felt a tingling in his groin. Zack knew his penis & balls were withering away to nothing, leaving behind only a white smooth furred spot in it&#39;s place for it was soon enough by now his very own vagina. most of Zack things like his navel didn&#39;t really changed much as it began filling in that soon, there was a furry white indication to where he had a belly button while His nipples were being bushed out for his chest grew away until they pop into an existence of two C cup breasts.<br />
<br />
All of Zack&#39;s clothes and boy things disappeared for Aj&#39;s clothes and girl stuff as his computer soon became Alex&#39;s that Zack walked over to a spot in the room while his toes & finger nails became black blunt claws & did a punk stance for him, before he was really out of his mind. Zack&#39;s feet became black fox paws as his hands were following suit of becoming his new black fox handpaws. Zack the human would no longer existed for Alex was now only seeing Zack&#39;s body as his fox girlfriend now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh My god.&quot; Alex said surprised while seeing all of this for the first time. if he wasn&#39;t seeing this, he wouldn&#39;t believe this out of Zack&#39;s own mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing, right?&quot; Zack asked Alex with a smile. Zack shortly sat on Alex&#39;s bed, next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does, dose it hurt?&quot; Alex asked wondering. he was a bit worried to know if he planned on using this device upon anyone else, namely himself one day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a bit. Also,&quot; Zack began to say to Alex as he smiled, before he made a surprising move of a kiss towards him. this made Alex wonder as to who was in control right now for was it his brother Zack, or was this his future girlfriend Aj Maria fox? he didn&#39;t care about it though for Alex thought that he was going to be loving it. [The Chronivac is so cool.]</p>
