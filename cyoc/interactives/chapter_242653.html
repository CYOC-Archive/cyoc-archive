<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer wanted to lay on her bed and look at her room for a while. The room looked smaller than it was yesterday. Jennifer’s room looked like it belonged to her younger sister and not for a 18-year-old high school teenager. Instead of band posters Jennifer had posters of ponies and a study desk on the room. The cleanliness of the room was passable but there were some dust and crumbled papers and pencils on the floor. Jennifer noticed her self drawn drawings on her wall. The one picture that got Jennifer&#39;s attention was a drawing of a melancholic purple pony with a big gray lock on top of it&#39;s head. Behind the lock was a big murky looking thing that dripped it&#39;s oozy liquid like substance on top of purple pony&#39;s head. The dark colors made the drawing look moody and it stuck like a sore thumb in the pastel colored room.<br />
<br />
Jennifer lifted herself from the bed and looked outside of the window. The urban view from the ground level to the street implied to her that their mansion sized house had lost one floor in the transformation. The view from Jennifer&#39;s window looked familiar and the grass outside looked green. Jennifer was glad to see the same street she had grown all her life. Which only meant that Jennifer&#39;s house had gotten smaller in size.<br />
<br />
Jennifer turned around and exited her room. In front of her Jennifer saw a hallway and spotted the bathroom door on the opposite wall from her room&#39;s door. The living room and the kitchen was at the other end of the hallway. Next to the bathroom was another door which Jennifer assumed to be her mother&#39;s bedroom. Jennifer looked at the floor and saw that the hallway was clean but it too looked a bit dusty like her room. Jennifer was convinced that there was no way that her mother could afford maid to clean for them which meant that her mother had to do almost all of the cleaning in the house.<br />
<br />
Jennifer entered to the bathroom and looked at her own reflection on the big mirror. Jennifer looked like a normal middle school student but with a big pregnant belly. Jennifer counted with her fingers that if she was now year younger than Alex and Alex was still fourteen. It meant that Jennifer was now 13-year-old. Jennifer looked at her reflection. She couldn&#39;t believe what she was seeing. Jennifer felt embarrassed at herself as she had gotten pregnant at age thirteen and was lying to a middle school boy who was year older than her. Only positive thing what Jennifer saw on the mirror was that she was eating properly and that she looked healthy. Jennifer turned her head and looked at the normal looking bathroom to see if it had any changes. Jennifer felt relieved that the bathroom looked the same and walked back to the hallway.<br />
<br />
All the constant thinking was making Jennifer hungry. She didn&#39;t want to wake up her snoring mother by making toast with a toaster but she really wanted to eat some bread for some reason. Jennifer&#39;s belly was guiding her to the kitchen and when Jennifer arrived in front of the fridge she noticed something on the door. There was a colorful birthday card which read, “Happy Birthday to 27-year-old Silvia”. Jennifer stared at the card for a long time and an odd feeling overwhelmed her. She didn&#39;t want to eat bread anymore as the card became the most important thing in the kitchen. <br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at the card again and like a leaky faucet something was dripping into her brain. A strange feeling. She should had been half of her mother’s age for her to be twenty seven years old. The birthday card was grabbing Jennifer&#39;s attention like car crash that she couldn&#39;t help but watch as Jennifer&#39;s heart begun to beat louder. Something was growing inside Jennifer. She couldn’t name the feeling but seeing her mother’s age at that low scared her. Jennifer looked down at her own belly and felt a cold sweat running on her temple. She didn&#39;t want to eat bread anymore. Jennifer ran back to her room and quickly scrolled through the messages that she had sent to Frank.<br />
<br />
Jennifer noticed the first message where she had told Frank that she felt sick. The message was sent to Frank seven months ago. Month prior that message Frank wished happy birthday to Jennifer and asked if she could meet with him. Jennifer dropped her phone on to the floor and realized something. Jennifer had lost her virginity on her 13th birthday. She remembered that day vividly. A locked memory that she had completely forgotten. Frank had given Jennifer a foaming can of something which didn&#39;t smell good and he had asked Jennifer to drink it. After Jennifer had drank the liquid everything became fuzzy. A huge chunk from her memory had disappeared from her head that day. Jennifer&#39;s legs begun to shiver as she remembered that she wasn&#39;t able to remember anything. Jennifer was having her first mental breakdown in her room at age thirteen.<br />
<br />
Jennifer’s anxious thoughts were interrupted when she heard a knock on her door and out of the door frame peeked a very young looking Silvia. Jennifer’s mother asked if Jennifer was ready to come study with her. Jennifer stared at her mother with horrified look while Silvia waited for her daughter’s response to her question.</p>
