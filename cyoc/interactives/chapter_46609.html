<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;CRAY!!  WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME?!&quot;  Matt repeated as he got to his feet and <br />
staring hard at his monstrous friend.<br />
&quot;I'm not sure!!  It depends on what your mind has always wanted!&quot; Cray said, still eyeing <br />
Matt and searching for changes.<br />
&quot;Am I going to become a total immoveable freak like GUY?!&quot; Matt said growing more <br />
exasperated and pointing at the mammoth Guy.<br />
&quot;It all depends!&quot; Cray replied, wondering when the changes would start.<br />
&quot;Oh god, how cou-&quot; Matt started to say, but suddenly he got quiet, with a shocked look on <br />
his face.<br />
&quot;It's starting!&quot; Guy exclaimed, waddling over to watch Matt.<br />
<br />
Matt began to shake slightly as he looked down at his hands.  They were starting to puff <br />
up and reshape themselves as they grew bigger.<br />
&quot;Oh god!  Help me!&quot;  Matt shouted in pain.<br />
Matt's T-shirt began tightening across his chest as his pecs rapidly blew up like being <br />
filled with a pump.  His sleeves were already stretching across his growing biceps and his <br />
triceps had already taken on a very defined horse-shoe shape.  His legs were keeping <br />
pace by almost instantly filling out the jeans Matt was wearing, becoming very very tight <br />
at the quads and almost equally as tight in the calves.  His feet did not seem to be <br />
affected however, and remained in his sneakers.<br />
&quot;Wow, he's growing fast!&quot;  Cray said to no one in particular as Matt's neck rippled thicker <br />
and thicker, starting to tear the collar of the t-shirt.<br />
&quot;AAAUUGH...&quot; Matt groaned, &quot;this can't be happening!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt watched as his the sleeves of his t-shirt began splitting at the seam beneath his arm, <br />
as his biceps and triceps swelled bigger and bigger.  His forearms were already the size of <br />
most bodybuilder's biceps.  Matt's waist was also growing outwards, actually popping the <br />
button off his jeans as it reached it's limit.<br />
&quot;Oh god!  My jeans are so tiiiight!&quot; Matt screamed.<br />
Indeed, Matt's jeans had grown obnoxiously tight as they resisted the growing and <br />
inflating muscle contained within them.  <br />
&quot;I'll try and get 'em off!&quot; Cray shouted as he tried to find a place to grab the taut denim to <br />
pull them off.  But the jeans had become so tight that there was no place to get a good <br />
grip on the pants.<br />
Then, the zipper literally burst open and with the force of that break, the jeans split right <br />
around the crotch, and allowed the seams running along the inner leg to rip straight down <br />
each leg.<br />
<br />
Newly freed from their denim prison, Matt's quads and calves went into overdrive, his <br />
quads colliding with each other and pushing each other apart.<br />
Meanwhile, Matt's shirt had reached it's breaking point.  His lats were pulling the shirt <br />
tautly across his chest laterally, and his gargantuan pecs and inflating back muscles <br />
pulled at it the other direction.  The tears that had formed from Matt's now bull-like neck, <br />
which had  now grown wider than his head, started to rip through the rest of the now <br />
sleeveless shirt.<br />
<br />
The t-shirt was wrapped tightly around his growing abdomen and 8-pack abs and his <br />
ridiculously wide lats and even more ridiculously humungous chest.  Finally, the t-shirt <br />
couldn't hold in the big boy it had once easily contained with room to spare, and it ripped <br />
apart and fell in shreds around his still-sneakered feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;HELP ME!&quot; Matt shouted looking desperately at Guy and Cray who were just looking in awe <br />
at Matt's swelling form.  &quot;Help me!  It's getting harder to move!!&quot;  he shouted.<br />
<br />
Indeed, Matt's growing frame was not getting any taller than it's 5'9&quot; height as it continued <br />
packing on the pounds and pounds of muscle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what to do!&quot; Cray said to Matt, &quot;We'll just have to ride it out!&quot;<br />
&quot;I can't take much more of this before I am not going to be able to move at all!&quot;  Matt cried <br />
as he began waddling to the mirror in the living room.  His movements were slow and <br />
deliberate.  He was shocked to see just how large he had become as he watched himself <br />
inflate in the mirror.<br />
<br />
His pecs had grown and inflated so much they now nearly brushed his strong chin, and his <br />
traps had creeped up as they pumped bigger and bigger so that they completely <br />
eliminated his thick bull-neck.  Matt's shoulders had grown so incredibly round and huge <br />
they resembled flesh-colored watermelons, and his biceps were even more impressive as <br />
they grew upwards, pushed skyward by his ever-widening lats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap!  Look at his abs!&quot;  Guy, who with Cray had followed Matt into the living room.<br />
<br />
Matt glanced down at his abs in the mirror, since his neck was virtually locked into place <br />
by his pecs and traps.<br />
<br />
His abs had become so large that they had run out of room to grow, and as a result were <br />
pushing outward, over his enormous, and bulbous thighs.<br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot;  Matt cried as he watched his growing mid-section puff and inflated larger and <br />
larger.  His quads were still growing, but were now evening out in how much they stuck off <br />
his body with his inflating abs.  The hard ball of muscle that made up Matt's inflating <br />
stomach was now being partially supported by his quads.  <br />
&quot;Wow!  That's what I call a MUSCLE GUT!&quot;  Cray exclaimed, thumping the large belly with <br />
his thick, meaty palm.  <br />
&quot;DON'T TOUCH ME!&quot; Matt yelled, turning to Cray, with tears starting to form in his eyes.  <br />
But Matt tried to move too fast, and was not used to all the new space his body now <br />
occupied.  &quot;WHOA...!!  AHHHH!&quot;  Matt cried as he started loosing his balance, his quads <br />
rubbing and colliding with each other and his arms uselessly swinging far and free from <br />
his body kept there by his tremendous lats.<br />
&quot;I gotcha!&quot; Cray yelled as he grabbed Matt's beach-ball biceps and tried to steady the <br />
enormous and still growing man wearing only a pair of over-stretched boxer briefs and <br />
sneakers.  &quot;GUY HELP!&quot;  Cray shouted as he struggled to hold up Matt's gigantic, swelling <br />
frame.  <br />
<br />
The 500 pound, and much stronger than Cray, Guy waddled quickly over and grabbed one <br />
of Matt's inflating arms and put his own thick, and gigantically muscular arm as much <br />
around Matt's still-widening waist to attempt to study the gargantuan man.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH GOD!  HELP!!&quot; Matt screamed, as Guy and Cray did the best they could to maneuver <br />
the humungous Matt to the couch.<br />
&quot;OOF!!&quot; Guy and Cray heaved Matt's growing body onto the couch.  The couch cracked as it <br />
took on the immense load.<br />
&quot;OW!&quot; Matt yelled.  He seemed to finally be reaching the end of his growing, much to Guy <br />
and Cray's relief.  They watched as the last several pounds piled onto Matt's already too-<br />
large body.<br />
<br />
Matt had gone silent and had closed his eyes, his breathing heavy and labored as his <br />
tremendous chest rose and fell.<br />
<br />
He was a sight to behold, and while he looked similar to both Cray and Guy when they had <br />
grown to immobility, both men were still staring.  Matt had grown an enormous muscle-<br />
belly.  The gut had grown so large, that it was unable to support it's own impressive <br />
weight, and sank slightly to be supported by Matt's inhuman quads, which had also grown <br />
much, much larger than either Guy or Cray's had done.  The muscle belly had grown so <br />
large, that with how Matt was positioned on the couch, reclined slightly, with his <br />
grotesquely wide and thick back holding him up, and his very round and over-stuffed butt <br />
muscles keeping him high off the seat of the couch, his muscle gut actually stuck further <br />
out than his own monstrous pecs.<br />
<br />
His shoulders had to have a width of at least 4 feet or more, which was highly impressive <br />
at Matt's fairly average height of 5 feet, 9 inches.  Matt's beachball biceps hung heavily <br />
from his tremendously stuffed shoulders, with enormous forearms attached, at a very stiff <br />
angle.<br />
<br />
Finally, his legs, which were one of the most impressive part about Matt's immense body, <br />
were so huge and enormous that the muscle each contained could probably be divided up <br />
to make a heavyweight professional bodybuilder.  The quads were slightly obscured by <br />
Matt's immense belly hanging over them, and blocking the view of his crotch and strained <br />
boxer briefs.  the quads blew outwards, so far around that Cray doubted he could get even <br />
his own fairly long arms around just one.  Matt's quads pressed heavily into one another, <br />
and overlapped, one slightly on top of the other since the quads were so large, that both <br />
could not be comfortably held next to each other, as they would push Matt into almost <br />
doing the splits at the waist.  The quads quickly cut to his knees and hung over the boney <br />
kneecaps like a cliff.  The knees led into gigantic calves which looked as though someone <br />
had stuffed medicine balls behind each leg.  But the calves quickly cut down to very <br />
normal, and small, but strong-looking ankles which rose from his still-intact sneakers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot;  Guy said in almost a whisper.  &quot;That was incredible!&quot;  as he looked over Matt's <br />
enormous muscle belly and legs.<br />
&quot;Yea!  Check out those legs!&quot;  Cray replied.<br />
<br />
Just then, Matt's eyes fluttered open and he looked from Guy to Cray.<br />
&quot;Oh my god, what happened!?&quot;  Matt said.<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Cray began, when Matt interjected as he looked down with his eyes and saw nearly <br />
half of his view obscured by his pillow-sized pecs.<br />
&quot;AHHH! HELP!!&quot; Screamed Matt, trying to get up, but in actuality, he was only able to <br />
wiggle his fingers and ankles and toys and shift around in his seat by flexing and unflexing <br />
his giant muscles.<br />
&quot;AAAHHH!!! I can't move!!&quot;  Matt yelled, tears starting to form in his eyes.  Seeing such a <br />
huge and over-inflated muscle man cry was something incredibly shocking and sad to <br />
see.  &quot;You have to help me!!&quot;  Cried Matt to the other two very muscular men in the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please!&quot; Matt continued, I have a wife and two young kids at home!  They can't see me like <br />
this!&quot;<br />
&quot;He has a wife and kids?!&quot; The very large Guy said to Cray.  &quot;And you still wanted to do <br />
this?!&quot;<br />
&quot;I forgot about that in all the excitement to see how huge he would get!&quot; Cray replied.  <br />
&quot;And let's be honest, he's pretty impressive!&quot; <br />
&quot;Never mind that!&quot;  Guy hissed back, &quot;What if he can't control his clearly very powerful and <br />
easily influenced subconscious??&quot;<br />
&quot;Help me, please!&quot; Matt cried again trying to see over his huge muscled chest to look at <br />
Cray and Guy.<br />
&quot;We'll try!&quot; Cray said coming into view around his left pec, and wiping a tear from Matt's <br />
eye.<br />
&quot;Yes, don't worry.&quot;  Guy said, but he gave Cray a worried look.</p>
