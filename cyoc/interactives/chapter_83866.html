<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had caused quite a commotion when almost immediately after being restored to her familiar husky form, Naomi had requested to become a mermaid. Naturally, she&#39;d taken a bit of time to get caught up on some recent events, have a few valuables moved to storage, and make proper arrangements for their old apartment. Charlotte had refused to come along even for that much of a check-in however, and she hadn&#39;t wanted to leave her on her own out here for long. She&#39;d also wanted to avoid as much contact as she could with any male huskies. Having to spend so long as a merman had been distressing enough, and so far as she knew, whatever tampering had been done to their orientation had not been reversed. Even with her recent swim on the other side of the fence, finding herself attracted to some male was the last thing she needed to deal with.<br />
<br />
She still wasn&#39;t sure what to make of the whole &quot;Irene&quot; situation. On the one hand, she understood the concerns Zack had voiced to her, and how horrifying it was for someone&#39;s personality to change so radically. On the other hand, she&#39;d always insisted that Zack and Harry would be far happier and well-adjusted with an upgrade to the superior gender, and if nothing else, this was certainly strengthening her case.<br />
<br />
There was a bit of an awkward moment when she&#39;d had to turn down the offer to attend &quot;Harry&#39;s wake&quot; but the timing just hadn&#39;t been right. Jessica&#39;s flight hadn&#39;t landed, Katie wasn&#39;t answering her phone... She did hope they&#39;d be able to work out some practical means of visiting each other. Hopefully once the dust was settled, that offsite facility could be refit as some sort of gateway to the ocean, should anyone wish to join them out here, but communication was a tougher issue to solve. When this mermaid template had been recovered, everyone had learned that their voices and hearing range had been pitched up to a range incompatible with humans. Some friends at the park agreed to look into finding some sort of waterproof &quot;translators&quot; but naturally, the funding for any special equipment would have to come from her and Charlotte&#39;s pockets, at least until mermaid forms came into popular fashion. Of course, they didn&#39;t exactly have anything better to invest in at the moment.<br />
<br />
Still, for now what it all came down to was that it was just her and Charlotte, alone, with a whole ocean to themselves, and no one else in the world to talk to. It was rather romantic, in an odd sort of way... and of course, there was always the possibility, maybe even the likelihood, that all that &quot;experimenting&quot; Charlotte had coaxed her into when she&#39;d been male meant they&#39;d have at least a little more company a few months down the road. It definitely wasn&#39;t something she&#39;d ever thought she&#39;d have to deal with, but Charlotte had been doing an extremely poor job of hiding how much she was clearly hoping for it. Time would tell, she supposed.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Jessica headed straight to the park when her flight landed. Presumably, there&#39;d be no issue with her staying at the facility itself. After all, she was still an employee, just at a different branch. She still couldn&#39;t believe the state things were in here, and was rather keen to badger a few people about it. Of course, Naomi was apparently a mermaid, her replacement leaving for some sort of &quot;spiritual journey&quot; is what she&#39;d been called down here for, and all the higher ups she&#39;d love to take to task seemed to be missing aside from the Minotaur, and apparently he wasn&#39;t all there lately. Still, she&#39;d have to pay a visit before she flew back. First though, she and Zack, and the twins were on their way to drag Katie out of her house.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Irene still felt a bit bad at how upset her friends were with the new direction her life had taken her in. She didn&#39;t let it get her down though. She still had Lawrence, the most fantastic lover she&#39;d ever known, and as they wandered across the country, she&#39;d been spreading the word on how to find true happiness to everyone who came to see their glorious new forms. Some were too repressed to understand, but several walked with them for a while, taking in her teachings, and others simply rushed to the park, to experience it for themselves. In time word would spread, and the world would be a better place for it.<br />
<br />

Goldie was surprised when she was called in to receive a letter. She&#39;d cut ties to her old life rather cleanly, and she really hadn&#39;t been close to anyone to begin with. There certainly wasn&#39;t anyone who&#39;d have anything nice to say to her. She was rather relieved in fact when she saw it was a summons to appear in court and testify against Max. At least until she realized how far she&#39;d have to travel and for how long. Her expenses would be covered, but there were... other issues. The park had swept certain details of how she came to be here under the rug, but as she&#39;d never really planned to leave, she hadn&#39;t exactly updated her driver&#39;s license... in fact, as she&#39;d snuck in under a fake I.D. she wasn&#39;t sure what had even happened to any of her old things. Her wallet, her birth certificate... she certainly didn&#39;t have any clothes she could properly wear to court. A meeting was arranged with Steve to sort out all her new paperwork, but before she flew out, she still needed to buy some clothes, and decide if she should see if Sam could take the time off and share a hotel room.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Wendy hesitated in the transformation chamber. Chuck said he&#39;d catch up inside, he was trying to get some footage Terry could hopefully do something with down the road. Apparently they&#39;d caught the security team at a bad time, and he was trying to negotiate whether he could take the camera through, or at least get some nice indignant shouting on film. He still hadn&#39;t shared what he&#39;d be coming through as on the other side, and she wasn&#39;t so sure herself. There was certainly something to be said for being &quot;Wally&quot; again. It would definitely get a warm welcome out of Terry... not to mention Katerina. She blushed a bit, remembering her last trip. On the other hand, she could stay female, in which case there would apparently be no attraction between herself and the boyfriend she was here to visit, which would be rather awkward too. Especially since Chuck was probably going to be a male rabbit if he didn&#39;t get cold feet on the whole thing. She&#39;d lost enough of her self-control last time to know that was likely to lead to a very awkward situation, they might not even reach the warren. Seeing Terry and Chuck together would be rather upsetting too come to think of it. She went to retrieve her clothes and double back, but apparently there were new security features due to a recent incident which meant the only way out was to pick a form and let the machine do its thing. Sighing, she made her choice, hoping they could all live this down in the end.</p>
