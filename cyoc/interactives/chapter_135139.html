<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">   This being Max&#39;s first time wearing an Animcostume, he was worried the animal part of the costume would be too strong and take over his mind so he figured he should pick one that is the proper size to his human body.  As Max approached the animsuits rack in front of him to get a better look he heard the donkey-woman come back in the room behind him. &quot;One more thing,&quot; she said and handed him a backpack with the company logo on it, &quot;you can put your clothes and other important items in this backpack and place them in your locker&quot;<br />
   Max slightly confused, &quot;I have a locker?&quot;<br />
   Realizing the Max was new to all of this and remembering he didn&#39;t read the paperwork at all, the donkey-women explained, &quot;Not yet, but when you pick your suit there will be a key to your locker attached to the info tag on the suit.&quot; She noticed Max&#39;s puzzling look and explained further, &quot;The info tags on the suit tell you everything from the suit height, recommended sizing, and strength, to suit species, breed, and color etcetera.&quot; Max then nodded showing he understood. &quot;Your locker will be found in the locker room through that door,&quot; she points to a door across the room labeled locker room, &quot;and don&#39;t forget to take everything with because the door will lock behind you. One last thing, if you don&#39;t like any of the suits on this front rack there are a lot more racks of suits in the back room,&quot; as she points to door next to the locker room door, &quot;and there is a changing room back there so if you try one on you don&#39;t like you can switch it before leaving to the locker room.&quot;<br />
   &quot;Have fun.&quot; she said giving Max a wink as she left the room for the last time.<br />
   Max immediately grabbed at the closest info tag to see the sizing on the front suits. He quickly skimmed through the tag looking for the sizing and then he saw it &#39;RECOMMENDED MIN. WEIGHT: 180 lbs&#39;.  Max&#39;s heart sank a bit, he quickly looked through the rest on the rack; 190 lbs, 170 lbs, 210 lbs, the lowest weight he could find on the front rack was 160 lbs. Max let out a sigh, the front suits looked amazing but they all seemed too big for him. Max headed too the back room in hopes to find one closer to his weight.<br />
   The back room looked like a clothes store, there where ten racks stuffed full of equine animsuits and a booth labeled changing room. Losing patience and just wanting to try on his first animsuit, Max started quickly looking at the tags just looking at the weight to find one the matched him. It wasn&#39;t until the 5th rack that he ran into a bunch of suits that where a lot smaller than the rest, these ranged from a minimum weight of 80 lbs to 110 lbs. Max didn&#39;t see any 120 lbs suits but at this point he would settle for a suit with minimum 110 lbs. Before grabbing it off of the rack he looked to make sure it wasn&#39;t a pony or donkey and the breed said: Arabian.  With that Max pulled it off the rack and ran to the changing room. <br />
   The changing room was nothing special, it had a bench and some coat hangers but oddly no mirror. Not wanting to waste anymore time, Max stripped his clothes off and threw them in his new backpack. The suit was a single full body suit with a large slit in the back that is suppose to self-seal. Max started by putting in his legs in the suit, followed by his arms and head and pulling the suit around his body. At first it felt really loose and weird, like he was wrapped in a damp blanket. But then the back sealed up and he felt light headed and nearly passed out. When Max came to his senses the first thing he noticed was that he was much taller, he was now a 6&#39; 6&quot; anthro-horse covered in a peach fur. His tail swished behind him blowing air between his butt and he stretched his arms, legs, and back noticing that he could feel everything as if he was the entire costume. The whole experience felt unreal to Max and better than he could have dreamed.  Max look down at himself and noticed that he was a little more slim than he imagined but he felt ten times stronger.  He had well defined muscles and his pecks looker strangely large, but as he continued to look over himself he noticed the suit had no penis and testicles.  Max has heard about some companies using gender-less suits to prevent sexual misconduct in the workplace and sadly it seemed like this was one of them. Max picked up his back pack and untied the info tag and key from his wrist and headed toward the locker room.<br />
   Walking in the suit felt surprisingly easy, Max thought it might be tough to learn to walk on digitigrade legs with hooves but that knowledge must have come with the suit.  As Max walked he could feel the air moving around him which made him think &quot;for wearing a big full body costume I feel surprisingly naked.&quot; Max also took notice of how weird it felt to walk without the male package between his legs, it felt... freeing.  Max got to the locker room door, double checked that he had everything, and went in.<br />
   Max looked at his locker key &#39;318&#39; and then started searching for his locker.  The locker room was pretty empty because it was mid-day and most of the employees where still working.  Max walked down a few rows when he saw a anthro-mustang who must have just gotten out of the showers because he was dripping wet. He must have been 8&#39; tall and had a beautiful black mane and dark brown fur and had massive muscles from his neck, to his arms, to his pecks, to his abs, to his... oh my... Max just noticed he had a massive semi-erect horse cock sticking out of his sheath, and balls the size of two baseballs. His cock had the signature flat head of a horse with dark and light patches, it looked absolutely beautiful... &quot;HEY!!, My eyes are up hear honey!&quot; the mustang didn&#39;t notice Max at first because he was drying his head but gave Max a startle when he yelled.<br />
   Max noticed his jaw was hanging open and quickly shut it and walk quickly to the back of the locker room with his head down. Max was not sure what came over him there, maybe it was because he&#39;s never seen a horse cock in real life before and it took him by surprise. He found his locker in the back of the locker room and there was another anthro-horse by his locker. This one had his back to Max, but Max could see that he was the same size and breed as Max, they where nearly identical aside from the fur pattern, Max was a peach and the other one was painted. Max was confused as to why that guy back there had a horse penis on his costume but he didn&#39;t have one so he decided to has the horse next to him. &quot;Hey, so is the horse penis that the other guys have an add-on to the costume or part of the costume?&quot; Those words felt weird coming out of Max&#39;s mouth and in a tone unfamiliar to Max.<br />
   The painted horse turned around and said in a very feminine voice, &quot;No, unfortunately those are part of the costume. Give a man a larger dick and he becomes a larger dick.&quot; Max noticed that this was a female horse thanks to her voice and when she turned around her C-Size breasts. &quot;You must be new here, are the guys giving the new mare trouble already. I can set them straight if you want. Name&#39;s Ashley by the way.&quot;<br />
   &quot;Hi Ashley, I&#39;m Max. No, no one is giving me trouble... wait did you say new MARE?&quot; Max responded slightly confused.<br />
   &quot;Yeah, that is what a female horse is called.&quot; Ashley saw the puzzled look on Max&#39;s face.<br />
   That&#39;s when it struck Max like a ton of bricks. &quot;I gotta use the toilet.&quot; Max quickly ran to the toilet stalls and closed the door. He sat down on the toilet and started to feel between his legs and... oh that feels nice. Max slipped his fingers into his new found hole, it felt amazing. He began massaging his new vagina moving his fingers in and out, in and out, in and out, in and - &quot;MAAAX?! Is everything OK?&quot; He heard Ashley call out which made him come to his senses and stop feeling himself for a second. It was then that Max noticed he didn&#39;t have strangely large pecks, they were small AA size breasts.</p>
