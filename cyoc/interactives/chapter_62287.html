<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Officer Jenkins and I slowly mad our way into Columbia Falls's relatively small cell &quot;block&quot; where man who had tried to kidnap Megan was being held. He was pacing the cell. When the door opened he began to spring to life.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is disgraceful! I...&quot; he was quiet hen he saw me and then glared angrily when he saw Officer Jenkins following me.<br />
<br />
&quot;William!?&quot; Officer Jenkins gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thief,&quot; the man, who Officer Jenkins had identified as William growled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch it,&quot; I growled back at him, making him back away from the cell bars, &quot;if ANYONE growls around here, it will be me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't your business, feline,&quot; William said nervously from a deeper part of the cell.<br />
<br />
&quot;You kidnapped the child of a friend of mine,&quot; I replied, &quot;it should be obvious that I would be involved... or do you think I would let you get away with kidnapping?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was merely reclaiming what was mine from the start,&quot; William shot back.<br />
<br />
&quot;William?!&quot; Officer Jenkins gasped, &quot;How... what are you doing here? Why did you take Megan from me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was never yours to begin with,&quot; William answered her, &quot;from the moment she was conceived, she was mine!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you say that?&quot; Officer Jenkins demanded, &quot;I carried her, I gave birth to her, I named her, and I raised her. I've loved her. How can you, who's never met or seen her before claim ownership of her? And for that matter, why do you even think you're Megan's father to begin with. I had only just found out I was pregnant when I was fired in Spokane... and I was drunk when Megan was conceived...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you assume that I was just as hammered as you?&quot; William challenged, &quot;don't make me laugh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll admit I made mistakes,&quot; Officer Jenkins admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistakes?&quot; William taunted, &quot;You were naked and hitting on everyone there. You were lucky the father is me and not one of the other slobs there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Jenkins was silent for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am merely reclaiming what is mine,&quot; William answered, &quot;I'm doing you a favor, little miss. You wanted to run around like some mindless skank...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch your tone, kidnapper,&quot; I growled at him, &quot;people can change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As some furry freak with dementia can easily prove,&quot; William gave a challenge, though from the deepest part of the cell.<br />
<br />
I had all I could do to keep myself from lunging at him, claws extended. I didn't try to get myself transformed. That was an accident. Neither did I support the lawsuit against Leona. I could accept the results, but that didn't mean I agreed with them. However, arguing those details was not the point of the present conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was speaking of things other then physical form,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I have changed,&quot; Officer Jenkins added, &quot;I was fired from Spokane for being pregnant... my behavior at the Christmas party may have been a factor in the decision, but my pregnancy was the reason. I carried Megan Jenkins, MY daughter to term, and learned some responsibility to take care of myself and to raise her. I am not the young woman who foolishly got herself drunk at a Christmas Party.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the same, the girl is mine,&quot; William answered, &quot;I am her father. She deserves to be with me. Not with people who needed to be taught a lesson in order to become a decent person!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Says the man facing kidnapping charges,&quot; I quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't I tell you that this was none of your business?&quot; William shot at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, you said something before?&quot; I tilted my ears a bit, &quot;I'm sorry, I wasn't paying that close attention. A fly buzzing on the wall was far more interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She is mine! My daughter! I will have her!&quot; William shouted angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you even know I lived here?&quot; Officer Jenkins asked, hoping to ease some of her curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ran from Spokane, took my child with you,&quot; William answered, &quot;I've spent years looking, until a friend finally tipped me off as to where my daughter was. And I came to claim her. Save her drunken fools like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And who was this friend?&quot; Officer Jenkins asked, &quot;Who told you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is for me to know and you to never learn,&quot; William answered with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless of your opinions,&quot; I spoke up, &quot;what you did was kidnapping. Megan Jenkins will stay with her mother, Officer Danielle Jenkins of the Columbia Falls Police Department.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The rest of the day went quietly Officer Jenkins and I tending to rather normal patrol duties. The next morning, we again made our way into the Kalispell courtroom to listen to MacClure's trial progress. Judge Pax brought the trial to a quick beginning and turned the floor over to the DA to begin the day's questioning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, your honor,&quot; the DA answered, &quot;to begin with we will establish the atmosphere of the night of the murder and present a character witness in regards to the defendant, Dusty MacClure. The defense calls the sons of the victim, Joshua Marksman to take the stand.&quot;<br />
<br />
I noticed that it was Brent Marksman that actually took the stand. He then spoke to Judge Pax as he approached the witness stand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid my brother is not in any condition to testify, sir, would you mind if it was I who testified?&quot; Brent asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is acceptable to me,&quot; Judge Pax nodded, &quot;so long as it is acceptable to the DA.&quot;<br />
<br />
The DA nodded. Judge Pax then motioned for the official questioning to begin and Brent Marksman was sworn in. The DA then turned to begin his questioning. Many of them were similar to what Officer Jenkins and I had asked him, though the DA managed to tip-toe around the fact that both Brent and Kyle had been drinking the night of the murder. In answering the questions, Brent Marksman presented the image of their return home to see their father fighting with Dusty MacClure, and then presented the image of MacClure being a short tempered and opinionated individual. As the DA finished with those questions, I knew that they wouldn't stand well on their own, but as the trial progressed the additional information would support Brent Marksman's testimony while revealing that MacClure was grasping at strings, at best.<br />
<br />
Once the DA was done, the defense attorney came forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Young Mr. Marksman,&quot; the defense lawyer spoke, &quot;you say you came in and saw my client arguing with your father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Brent answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, is it possible that people could have an argument and not have it accelerate into an argument?&quot; the defense attorney asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Brent sighed, &quot;but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No buts, that's all we needed to hear,&quot; the defense attorney answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I had a point...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brent Marksman, did you see my client shoot your father?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; the lawyer cut him off, &quot;as you can see ladies and gentlemen of the jury...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY! I WASN'T FINISHED YET!&quot; Brent screamed at him.<br />
<br />
Judge Pax brought his gavel down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will have order in my court,&quot; Judge Pax answered, &quot;Counsel, you will allow the witness to make a full answer to the questions asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, your honor,&quot; the defense attorney sighed.<br />
<br />
Brent then gave his answer in full, &quot;It is possible that Mr. MacClure and my old... my father could have had an argument and it wouldn't lead to murder. And Kyle and I did not witness the murder itself, but to play to that possibility ignores his character, and ignores the fact that the argument was already heated when Kyle and I got home. Mr. MacClure was gesturing wildly and screaming at the top of his lungs. He seemed close to the point where one would draw a weapon and shoot someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you can not say for sure that that is what happened?&quot; the defense attorney questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did not witness it, if that is what you're asking,&quot; Brent replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is what I was asking,&quot; the defense attorney answered, &quot;as you can see, the prosecution is merely speculating in its case. We have no clear idea who killed Joshua Marksman. No one saw the actual crime. Merely the fact that Mr. MacClure had visited prior to the murder and that he had a disagreement with Joshua Marksman. Everything after my client's departure is hidden and we do not know WHAT happened. It is my opinion that because of the lack of a credible witness to the murder that the murder charges against my client be dropped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you contest this motion?&quot; Judge Pax sighed to the DA.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do not have a witness, but we do have evidence that we feel marks MacClure as the murderer,&quot; the DA answered, &quot;not just Brent Marksman, your honor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Judge Pax nodded, &quot;the motion is denied. Do you have any further questions for the witness?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I believe I have made my point,&quot; the defense attorney answered.</p>
