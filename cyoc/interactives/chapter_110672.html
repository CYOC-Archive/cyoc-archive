<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">   As the lights slowly turned on Rick saw what he had become. He in every meaning of the word was a freak. Rick almost fainted as he saw himself.<br />
<br />
        He was covered in a strange latex like fur. Every part of him was rubbery and strange. He had a muzzle and a long furry tail and if it weren&#39;t for the fur he wouldn&#39;t resembled a anthropomorphic canine. The scariest part however was his eyes. They were nothing but white pupiless orbs. Empty and filled with nothing.<br />
<br />
   Rick&#39;a hands and feet had become paws, and after almost cutting himself finding out they also had retractable claws that unlike his rubbery skin was sharp and dense. <br />
<br />
  &quot;Yes, while you were unconscious we tested those claws, they seemed to be highly advanced, they could even cut through diamond without so much as a scratch!&quot; said the Doctor.<br />
<br />
  Rick nearly jerked as he heard the doctors voice. He had nearly forgotten he was there as Rick examined his new body. <br />
<br />
   &quot;Do-Doctor, what am I?&quot; Rick said nasally, still not use to talking with a muzzle.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Well, that is a very good question that we could only speculate why. When you were first brought here you despite your enormous injuries you were perfectly human. However the effect the chemicals had on your body is profound. Your entire DNA structure has change to the point of becoming completely non human.&quot; the Doctor answered.<br />
<br />
   &quot;How did it change so much?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Well, testing on your body has been very difficult, your new skin despite being normally soft and rubbery, when applied to pressure it seems to condense and become harder than steel. We did manage to gain some DNA samples from you. Your DNA seems to be much more adaptable, your entire body is more like a base form, so to speak. Your body seems to be able to change and mutate within a moments notice. Whatever you are, your definitely incredibly unique. But there is something else...&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;What? What is it?&quot; Rick asked. This was all too much but he had to know.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Rick, whatever you are now, your new species is strange, the blood samples we had taken from you had almost seemed to have a mind of their own. They desperately tried to return to your body. We couldn&#39;t test much on your blood and had to resort to your saliva, which seems to be highly acidic by the way, but when we exposed your blood to other animals, specifically a squirrel your blood... started eating it.&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;What! What do you mean by that?!??&quot; Rick said. This was getting insane. Maybe this is all a bad dream, but whenever Rick tried to pinch himself, he didn&#39;t wake up.&quot; <br />
<br />
  &quot;Your blood isn&#39;t liquid. It&#39;s for lack of a better word it is esstentialy a gelatinous slime. When it detected the squirrel it started moving towards it. The squirrel tried to fight and escape but eventually it failed. Your blood started covering the squirrel, every inch was covered with it. Then the slime compressed suddenly and then the squirrel was gone and your blood had grown bigger. We returned your blood to you and in fascination we watched as it almost melted into your skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Rick looked as if he was about to throw up. What the doctor said, it was almost like he had remembered it, &quot;eating&quot; the squirrel. There were other new memories too. The memories of the squirrel. Rick could recall every moment of the squirrel&#39;s life. And as he though of the squirrel his hand started to shift. The black latex twisted and contorted. It became a light brown, the latest fur became less rubbery and in nearly a blink of a eye his hand became a giant squirrel paw.<br />
<br />
   The Doctor&#39;s eyes nearly burst out as he saw. Clearly he had never seems this before. <br />
<br />
  &quot;Th-This is new, it seems as that your DNA is much more versatile than I thought! You seem to be able to shapeshift into anything you had consumed before!&quot;<br />
<br />
  Rick examined his new paw with a frightened look on his face. He was military solider but this wasn&#39;t anything he was told about. This was completely new and different.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Rick asked two more questions. &quot;Doctor, this is all shocking and more, but why do I look like a rubber dog?&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;Oh, that is a easier question to answer. You see the chemicals that created this change was building your new body with your previous genetic material, however it seems like material from one of the military canines had also been on your body when you were exposed. So it seems like the chemicals simply integrated that canine DNA into your new body.<br />
<br />
       Rick looked at his squirrel once more, concentrating he watched as his squirrel paw shifted back into its original black latex paw. Interesting. Perhaps this wouldn&#39;t be so bad.<br />
<br />
    Rick looked at the the doctor and asked his last question.<br />
<br />
  &quot;What&#39;s going to happen next?&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;I don&#39;t know, the government have taken immense interest in you now. In all honestly its possible they may want to weaponize you, especially if they hear about your shapeshifting abilities. Do you happen to have any of the squirrel&#39;s memories by the way?&quot; The Doctor asked.<br />
<br />
  &quot;I don&#39;t think so, not that I can tell anyway.&quot; Rick lied.     <br />
<br />
   The Doctor nodded and after biding Rick farewell went off to make his report.</p>
