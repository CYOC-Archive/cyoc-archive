<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dion suddenly felt a tingling sensation against his arm, and he nearly squeed in cheering that it meant the Amulet had worked and he would soon be himself again. At least he thought that&#39;s how it would work. He&#39;d been in such a hurry because he didn&#39;t know how much time he would have before his mother and sister came home, and thus how much time he&#39;d have with the Amulet. As he ran into the bathroom stark naked, not caring, he didn&#39;t know how long it would take for the transformation to begin or take. Silently, he watched and waited as he stared at his hated female form in the mirror.<br />
<br />
At first he thought it was a trick of the eye, but he quickly noticed that he seemed to be slightly taller. As he watched in the mirror, he could see that he was in fact growing before his very eyes. Smiling, Dion looked down at his lower body, hoping that his boy parts would soon make a reappearence. He was frustrated when he didn&#39;t feel anything, instead still growing taller, but slightly wider too, as his hips and thighs seemed to be slightly bigger. He looked up at the mirror and froze in shock. His face was still female, and even worse it appeared older. His hair was longer, hanging down to his back and still growing slightly. His breathing began to quicken as he realized the error of his decision. He wasn&#39;t transforming back into himself, or even an older version of himself, he was becoming an older version of herself.<br />
<br />
As he continued to get slightly taller, Dion nearly screamed as he backed into the wall, distraught with how things had happened. It was almost like something out of a horror film, as he watched his skin stretch across his growing frame, his face becoming more and more like a teenage girl&#39;s with every passing second. He looked down at the hated cleft between his legs and was almost mesmerized by the tiny hairs that grew around the now slightly larger and puffier lips of his girl parts. Glancing down further, and at his arms, he could see that both his hands and feet appeared to have been manicured at some point, and each nail was somehow coated in a glossy pink polish. A quick glance at his face seemed to reveal that he had makeup on there as well, at least as far as he could tell. His hand brushed by his chest, and he immediately recoiled from the sensitivity there, looking down at the hitherto unnoticed part of his body. As a young boy, he didn&#39;t really understand anything about breasts, so it was almost curious watching as small fleshy orbs began to grow on his body. They grew larger and larger, till it looked like he had a pair of small melons hanging off his chest, throwing off his sense of balance.<br />
<br />
After a few moments, it appeared that the changes were done and Dion stood up at his...now her full height. She didn&#39;t mind being grown up; at least now she&#39;d be older than Holly...but still being a girl was definitely not in the plan. What&#39;s worse, he know that he read something about their being a time limit between using the Amulet. He tried to take stock of the situation, and ran back to his room. He didn&#39;t even know what he could wear, but stopped short when he saw the inside of his bedroom. Like before, it had transformed to match his new persona. Gone (mostly) were the myriad of stuffed animals and plushies, replaced by a simple queen size mattress and headboard. The pastel pinks were still there, but on the wall now were posters of bands and...boys. Dion shuddered at that thought, shuddering even more when he saw the makeup table and vanity in the corner next to his dresser. Going over to the closet, he was distraught to find that his wardrobe had gone from being girly things to being teenage girly things, with mostly dresses and skirts lining the hangers. Almost mechanically, he picked out a simple blouse and the jeans that had caused this whole mess to begin with, before grabbing a simple pair of panties and a matching bra from her underwear drawer. It didn&#39;t dawn on him that not only did he know how to put a bra on, but he had thought nothing of doing so in the process. He glanced down and saw the Amulet sitting on the floor where she had dropped it. Not knowing what else to do with it, she placed the Amulet under her mattress with the notebook, and waited for some time to pass before she could transform again. A buzzing sound over on a nearby desk caught her attention, and Dion was surprised to see a phone sitting there. She picked it up, seeing who was texting her...</p>
