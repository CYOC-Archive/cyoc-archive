<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Just to keep continuity straight, of all our Earth 1 stories, <i>Moon Lake: Tad</i> has already been to the Halloween dance and is now on November 1, 2015. <i>Moon Lake: Jenkins</i> has just reached the dance and <i>Moon Lake: Andersons</i> will arrive soon.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
It was a nice, romantic walk to the high school.<br />
Harold Jenkins and his fiance Virginia McCoy walked furry arm in furry arm as the two toga wearing weretigers strolled to the Halloween dance.<br />
Along the way, they acknowledged the few trick or treaters they saw, noticed some members of the Skulk standing at street corners to assist those in need, and acknowledged everyone they met.<br />
What was more important about walking to the dance was to show that Harold Jenkins was healthy and happy as a new weretiger, there was no ill will toward the lady who was now his fiance, and that Virginia McCoy had been cleared of all possible Statute 1A* violations.<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; began Harold with a smile on his furry muzzle, &quot;I honestly can&#39;t remember the last time I was out on a romantic walk, let alone with such wonderful company,&quot; he added, before kissing Virginia on her furry cheek.<br />
&quot;Flattery will get you anywhere with me Mister Jenkins,&quot; cooed Virginia.<br />
&quot;And I&#39;d love to see how far it does get me, <i>after</i> the dance,&quot; replied Harold, noticing that they were now approaching Moon Lake Senior High School.<br />
<i>Harold not only seems to be adjusting quite well to Moon Lake and were society now, but he&#39;s genuinely happy. Probably for the first time in years since Eliza&#39;s passing,</i> realized Virginia, as they walked around to the exterior entrance to the high school gym.<br />
There, Virginia excused herself to check in and report for chaperone duty while Harold stayed outside in case his daughter Mel(issa) and her date Trevor hadn&#39;t shown up yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;They haven&#39;t signed in yet,&quot; said Virginia, when she came back out.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because Trevor&#39;s pick up truck is just now pulling into the parking lot,&quot; replied Harold, while raising a paw to point at the vehicle in question.<br />
&quot;I did notice that Alice Decrux has already come and gone, dropping off her candy prizes for the dance in the process, so I warned Principal Andrews about the possibility of them being laced with her Love Potion #9.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good. Hopefully that will stop any plans she might have against Mel tonight,&quot; said Harold, unaware of Decrux spiking the punch with the sexual aphrodiasic and telling four wereraccoon boys that the one that got Melissa Jenkins to drink some would have the time of their young lives with Decrux herself later.**<br />
Virginia lovingly put her arm back around Harold as the couple watched Trevor get out of his pick up, and then walked around to open the door for Mel.<br />
It was only when the young couple grew closer that the four started conversing.<br />
&quot;Hail Caesar!&quot; said Mel jokingly, as she raised her arm in salute.<br />
&quot;Well, well,&quot; said her father in return. &quot;If it isn&#39;t Miss Hepburn and Mister Peppard fresh from the set, or am I addressing Miss Golightly and Mister Varjak?&quot; he asked, completing the movie reference to <i>Breakfast At Tiffany&#39;s</i>.<br />
&quot;Oh dad,&quot; said Mel, before hugging him, while Trevor shook Miss McCoy&#39;s paw.<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t that costume a little big on you?&quot; asked Virginia, as Trevor shook Harold&#39;s paw now that the Jenkins had finished hugging.<br />
&quot;What? Oh. Thanks for reminding me,&quot; said Trevor before assuming his werebull form.<br />
Mel watched in fascination as her new boyfriend grew in height while gaining muscle mass. Small horns sprouted from the top of his head as Trevor&#39;s face assumed bovine features.<br />
&quot;Much better,&quot; he added, noticing that since his dad was bigger and more muscular, the suit was still a tad big on him, but not as much as before now.<br />
&quot;You two look happy,&quot; said Mel, observing her father and fiance.<br />
&quot;Thanks. You two do too,&quot; replied Virginia, as Trevor took Mel&#39;s hand gently in his.<br />
&quot;Listen, dad. What do you know about visions and prophecies?&quot; wondered his daughter, before repeating everything that happened to her in the Tyson family attic this afternoon.***<br />
When Harold Jenkins finished listening to Mel, he had a concerned look on his feline features. &quot;Your mother had moments like that from time to time in the past, but nothing as major as that,&quot; he recalled. &quot;The few I know about, she always chalked up to <i>woman&#39;s intuition,</i> and if she ever had any visions like what you say you&#39;ve experienced, she never told me.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, it&#39;s not just living in Moon Lake now,&quot; realized Melissa Jenkins.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard all kinds of stories since moving here myself,&quot; said Virginia. &quot;Some of them I can even attest to as being true,&quot; she added, before kissing Harold on his furry cheek. &quot;But that&#39;s a first, even for me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; agreed Trevor, while moving a bit closer/protectively toward Mel.<br />
&quot;So, whatever gift I do have is natural, and Moon Lake is just making it better than it would have been anywhere else,&quot; summarized Melissa Jenkins. She thought about it for a moment and then said, &quot;Oh well. As long as I avoid the candy, punch, and raccoon boys, I&#39;m having a good time with my date tonight. Coming?&quot; she asked everyone else, as she started walking toward the gym.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Unbeknownst to the Jenkins, Virginia, or Trevor, four raccoon boys were in the parking lot; just hanging out and passing the time until the dance got more under way.<br />
While outside, they had seen the weretiger couple walking to the gym, but thought nothing of it.<br />
But they did take notice when a red haired girl got out of a pick up truck.<br />
&quot;According to Decrux, the red head must be Melissa Jenkins. I&#39;ve seen her around but never had a name to put with the face before now,&quot; said one wereraccoon.<br />
Considering the facial features of a raccoon, whether of nature or were fursona, the four friends had decided to come to the dance together as a gang of masked outlaws in hope of having a good time and getting some girls.<br />
&quot;I recognized the guy before he changed. That&#39;s Trevor Tyson, he&#39;s in my math class, and must be her date,&quot; realized the second raccoon.<br />
&quot;As chummy as they were, the male weretiger must be her father,&quot; figured the third.<br />
&quot;Then the other has to be Miss McCoy in her fursona. I heard she was in some trouble for scratching a normal, but it must have blown over if she&#39;s here with the guy now,&quot; said the fourth.<br />
&quot;Never have liked McCoy. She keeps flunking me in History,&quot; complained the first wereraccoon, never acknowledging that if he studied harder and applied himself, he might do better in her class.<br />
&quot;The big question is, how do we get her to drink the punch?&quot; asked the second, for none of them were close enough to overhear the conversation, even with a were&#39;s better hearing.<br />
&quot;Yeah. I don&#39;t know about you guys, but I hear Alice Decrux is one horny MILF****, and I wouldn&#39;t mind having a piece of her.&quot;<br />
&quot;Say, what if we all work together?&quot; asked the fourth. &quot;Then Decrux would owe and have to do ALL of us instead of just one!&quot;<br />
&quot;YEAH!&quot; the other three shouted in unison, as the wereraccoon outlaws started making their plans.<br />
<br />
TO BE CONTINUED...<br />
