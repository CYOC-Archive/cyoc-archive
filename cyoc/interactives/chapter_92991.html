<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“… I just don’t know if I can say it.” Nate said seemingly afraid of something.<br />
<br />
“Honey… just say it. We get all kinds of requests as I am sure you can imagine and when I said that only your imagination limits what you can go through… I mean it. So, what is it that you’ve always wanted to be?” Samantha said consolingly.<br />
<br />
“I’ve always wanted numerous things for myself… if I am going to be completely honest. I have always wanted to be a thick muscled, bullish and bearish type male. A hairy power-lifter kind of guy for starters. Though, I have also always wished I had a thick cock. My length is good where it is, but I am not that thick… maybe an inch across.” Nate said pausing, feeling flush and embarrassed that he was telling a complete female stranger, but continued. “I’ve also always wanted to be a werewolf too, but not just any werewolf. I have a dark side… a very sinister, dark and evil side… one where I want to do unspeakable things. Is… is this something you can help with Samantha?” Nate asked stammering at the end, feeling a bit better now that all of this was off of his chest and he was even smiling, enjoying saying what he did while his cock had hardened in his pants a bit.<br />
<br />
“Nate, I am glad that you have gotten that off your chest and the company can certainly make all of those things happen for you, but I can’t. I can only help with what we here call white desires… yours are black. I can even help you with being a werewolf, that’s a white request, but since you admitted to having dark desires, I am no longer able to help.” Samantha said kindly, seemingly uncaring that Nate wanted to unleash his dark side.<br />
<br />
“Alright Samantha… you said that your company can help, but not you. So… where do we go from here then?” Nate asked a bit sharply, but trying to keep his cool because he knew it wasn’t that woman’s fault.<br />
<br />
“Well… Nate… if you wouldn’t mind holding for a minute or two, I can get you connected with Lucien. He is one of our best dark request fulfillers. He is a dark warlock… one who communes with demons and even Lucifer himself… or so he claims. So… if you’d like, I can make sure you get connected to him since he would be the best help for you.” Samantha said as plainly as she has typically spoken.<br />
<br />
Nate smiled as his lips curled into a sneer on the phone, elated with how everything was going. “Yes… I would very much want that!” Nate replied happily.<br />
<br />
“Alright, please hold while I get you connected with Lucien.” Samantha said as the call went silent for a moment, placing Nate on hold with the song starting right up where he left off. Then, in what seemed like a few moments, the click sounded and Samantha spoke. “Nate… I have Lucien on the line with us now.”<br />
<br />
“I bid you dark greetings oh purveyor of darkness.” The man known as Lucien said, his voice was deep and dark sounding, which made Nate smile and giddy with anticipation.<br />
<br />
“I bid you greetings as well oh servant and enabler of darkness!” Nate said in reply, not sure if that was the right response, but figured that was close to what could be correct.<br />
<br />
“Well Nate… I will leave you and Lucien to it. Enjoy your unlocked desires and I am glad to have helped you get one step closer to fulfilling your transformation desires.” Samantha said cheerfully and there was a click, then silence.<br />
<br />
“Lucien… is she gone?” Nate asked plainly.<br />
<br />
“Yes, she is… the light that indicated her connection to the call has ended. Now, tell me of your desires… your lusts… your darkest dreams you have always wanted to fulfill, but never dared believe it to be a possibility.” Lucien said gleefully in a very sinister way.<br />
<br />
“Lucien… I want one thing more than anything else in this world… I want the beast inside me released that I know exists. I desire my human soul removed and replaced with a pure demonic soul… or multiple to make my dark power absolute. I want to have the power of Legion to spread demonic control over the weak, pathetic and pitiful humans that ruin the planet. I want my human form to be massively built and hairy like a bearish power-lifter, but I know my beast is not a bear… it is a wolf. A werewolf to be precise. I want to slaughter any I choose or those who dare to stand in my way… blocking my goals. I want to do as I please… even so much to turn children and corrupt them as early as possible. The earlier, the better and I can only imagine just how sweet their corruption would be. I want to corrupt only men around me, slowly, bending their will to mine till I make them one of my pack… a demonic werewolf bent on serving my will… to spread our influence.” Nate said almost growling over the phone with foamy spittle flying from his mouth, drooling on the sides as the thick saliva clung to his flesh.<br />
<br />
“Oh my! You definitely are a wicked one… aren’t you?” Lucien said sounding incredibly pleased.<br />
<br />
“I am indeed! I wish to serve Lucifer as I have been told you do.” Nate said grinning while composing himself slightly.<br />
<br />
“Well then Nate, you’ve not only got the right sorcerer for your needs, but you’ve also piqued my interest in you immensely. You are the first I have spoken to who I can sense a fully complete dedication to Lucifer and your desire to dominate humanity pleases our master greatly. He spoke of one who would need his power and I would be his conduit. Our master told me that this one would be my master on the Earth; that I would serve you and all your desires, needs and wants. You… my master, have the full disposal of Lucifer’s power to make you as you wish. He has declared that you would be a legion of demon souls unlike any before you. How does having the entire collective demons inside of you sound? It is so vast that a number can not begin to quantify it.” He said with giddy anticipation, knowing what Nate would say if he was indeed the one Lucifer spoke of.<br />
<br />
“Nothing would please me more than to be Lucifer’s ultimate gateway to lay claim to the world that was originally promised to him.” Nate said with a sneer.<br />
<br />
“Perfect! I shall be there to greet you in person as this request needs my physical presence… not just my power. This job has bored me and now that I have found you, Master, it is time for me to take my place by your side.” Lucien growled and the familiar click assaulted Nate’s ear and the line went dead as the cellphone beeped three times signaling the call ended.<br />
<br />
Nate just sat there, wondering what just happened and what the fuck he was going to do. There was an immense fear in him that made him paranoid, thinking this Lucien character was nothing more than a plant by the local authorities trying to arrest citizens before they could ever commit a crime. What Nate had admitted to wanting was definitely something that would get someone thrown into prison indefinitely as he would be a threat to general civilized society. Suddenly there was a light whirring noise that was coming directly from his right side. Slowly the noise grew louder and louder until a flat and formed focus of energy visibly manifested. With quick speed, it swirled in place as it grew larger and larger. As it grew bigger by the second, it began to open as a hole in space and time formed. Steadily and with increasing speed, the swirling energy hole grew exponentially until it was large enough for another person to step through. Curious, Nate peered into the two dimensional spatial displacement hole and smiled because of what he saw. On the other side of the portal was a clear view of a cubicle, a computer, a telephone connected to a headset for ease of handling calls… especially if it was in a high volume. Then there was one other thing… rather someone… that Nate saw and assumed it was Lucien.<br />
<br />
The man on the other side had a decent height, standing at six feet and an inch… matching Nate’s height perfectly. He had thick, chocolate brown hair; a toned, athletic body; a decent coating of thick and dense body hair that poked out from the open collared shirt he was wearing as well as the hair on his forearms that went down to his hands and swept down the top of his hand slightly; his hands were a decent size with slightly plump fingers of an average length; his face was hard and chiseled with a strong jawline; his face was covered in a thick , but short beard of the same hair color; his eyes were a beautiful and deep cobalt blue. As he saw me looking at him through the portal he opened, he looked me up and down then smiled a wry smile. I grinned showing my teeth, which were nice and white with my bicuspids looking sharper than humans normally had… which he caught on to immediately.<br />
<br />
“You must be Nate… or should I call you Nathan or Nathaniel?” The man said, whom Nate guessed was Lucien.<br />
<br />
“I am indeed and I suspect you are Lucien?” Nate said, purposefully not answering his initial question.<br />
<br />
“Indeed… now, which shall I know you by?” Lucien asked again plainly.<br />
<br />
“I was born as Nathaniel, but my mother called me Nathan to shorten it a bit while my friends all just call me Nate. So… you may call me as you please. Though, while it is longer to say, I do miss being called Nathaniel. It sounds like an angelic name, which as you know… we will be corrupting. It means ‘Given or Gifted by God’ and I give myself as a gift to our dark lord Lucifer who will become god.” Nate said with an evil and sinister sneer.<br />
<br />
“Yes… that is fitting. Nathaniel is what I shall call you and you are perfect to be offered to Lucifer!” Lucien said as he stepped through the portal, instantly standing chest to chest with you in your home.<br />
<br />
With the snap of his fingers, the portal closed behind him before too many could poke their noses in business where they didn’t belong. Lucien grinned as he thought about those there, the ones serving the disgusting light who would be corrupted and turned into a brilliant bastion for darkness. Lucien knew that they would be perfect to use, right where they are, to corrupt all of their callers and turn them into what Lucien and Nathaniel would become.<br />
<br />
“Master Nathaniel… I am here and our Lord eagerly awaits your entrance into his glorious darkness. Are you ready to accept?” Lucien asked, his lips curled into one of the most evil smiles Nathaniel had ever seen.<br />
<br />
“Yes Lucien… I am. I have grown tired of this life, this human existence and this world we know to exist as it is now. Bestow upon me what Lucifer gives to me… I await to become his glorious instrument of evil, which will be good in our sight… with good becoming evil. The one we call God is no more than a child that was given the ability to do as he pleased, but created this messed up existence. Lucifer, the fallen angel who was the ‘Keeper of Light and Knowledge’ is the one who deserves what was given to ‘God’… not ‘God’.” Nathaniel roared as his anger rapidly peaked as he spoke.<br />
<br />
“Yes… our Lord chose well in you and his gift to you is at hand!” Lucien shouted as he grasped Nathaniel’s head, pouring his dark power straight from Lucifer into Nathaniel’s mind. <br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah!” Nathaniel growled, the sound growing deeper and deeper by the second, “Release me!”<br />
<br />
Nathaniel clutched at the shirt that hung loosely off of his out of shape and fat laden body, tearing it open and baring his hairy chest.<br />
<br />
“Soon Master!” Lucien bellowed as he smiled, looking directly at Nathaniel’s chest, finding where his human soul resided to be an empty vessel.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, right where Lucien expected it to be, he locked onto Nathaniel’s soul and smiled deviously. With a quickness that didn’t seem possible for humans, Lucien placed his hand flat against Nathaniel’s chest and closed his eyes as he concentrated. Nathaniel grunted and groaned, feeling Lucien digging through his torso, reaching to the core of his being with an ephemeral hand. Digging deeper and deeper Lucien grew ever closer to Nathaniel’s soul, causing the pain and discomfort to intensify even further. To Nathaniel, this discomfort and pain was not a bad thing… in fact Nathaniel delighted in it. Suddenly, as Lucien dug all the way down to his core, Lucien’s eyes lit up and he grinned evilly.<br />
<br />
“Master, I’ve got it!” Lucien shouted as he clenched his hand into a fist and grasped it firmly, then yanked hard and pulled it straight out of Nathaniel’s body. “See it? So how bright, pure and white it is?”<br />
<br />
Nathaniel nodded, his gaze empty and showed that without his human soul, he was an empty and conscious shell. “I… see… it… Lucien. What now?”<br />
<br />
Lucien smirked and opened a small portal into Hell, looking directly at Lucifer himself. Nathaniel’s glossed over eyes looked at him with utter disbelief. The disbelief was in that he never thought he would ever look upon the face of the one he always dreamed of serving. Now, Lucifer was visible to him as clear as day and unbelievably he didn’t look anything any description of him ever made in literature or medieval art. He was gorgeous! Lucifer was one of the most attractive, sexually arousing and hottest male beings Nathaniel had ever laid his eyes upon.<br />
<br />
“Now… Lucifer will take the soul given to you when the one known as God gave it to you while you were in the womb of your mother. Lucifer will take it into himself and then give it directly back to you from his being. It will be your old soul, as Lucifer could not place something that didn’t belong to you in you to begin with, but it will be corrupted and transformed into the anchor for all demon souls to attach to. Once the corrupted soul is inside you, our Lord’s power will begin to fill and change you as the legion slowly fills your form. It will increase your power constantly and slowly, allowing you time to absorb each one completely until you are a being beyond imagining.” Lucien explained as Nathaniel watched his soul being pulled into Lucifer’s body, consuming it and making it new… making it whole as Nathaniel only imagined in his wildest dreams.<br />
<br />
Nathaniel just stood there in his dazed state, his eyes fixed on the soul that was once inside of him being consumed by Lucifer. It was brilliant, radiant and the whitest white light that could ever be. Slowly the white light entered the Dark Lord and was consumed by his darkness and Nathaniel grinned as he watched it darken more and more as the corruption spread throughout. As it grew dimmer and dimmer, darker and darker, the soul once inside of Nathaniel entered completely into Lucifer as Nathaniel watched him smile deviously.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm… that was a very delectable soul… one that yearned for its’ transmogrification by me. Yes, the soul that ‘I AM’ put inside you was doomed to be destroyed from the start… as it had my corruption already at its’ core… just overwhelmed by the shell of light surrounding it. That is why you, Nathaniel, the one who shall be known as Legion, bringer of unbridled freedom, were drawn to me… your true and original Lord. I give it back to you now, as it once was, free of any confinement by his doing.” Lucifer said, his voice was powerful and authoritative. Even without the soul in him, part of Nathaniel’s being remembered where his true allegiance had always been and revered the Dark Lord greatly.<br />
<br />
Nathaniel bowed, his eyes empty and as a void, though he still grinned with sinister delight. “You honor me my Lord. I hope that I shall take this gift you have given me and use it to further your work!” Nathaniel said growling, feeling his beastial nature beginning to emerge even before the released soul was returned to him.<br />
<br />
Having gone without his soul for so long, there had been nothing holding back the creature that truly resided within him… the creature that he was born as, but caged without his knowing or choice. Nathaniel could feel it creeping to the surface, clawing its’ way up and out, finally and one hundred percent unshackled by anything being in its’ way and suppressing it.<br />
<br />
“That’s it… feel your beast on his way out! He will be fed countless souls, both human and demon. His power will be magnificent and you will be a gorgeous creature of damnation to destroy what ‘I Am’ created. Such a pretentious thing to call one’s self, considering I am his equal and we were both there at the creation of the world. He just got the jump on making everything before I could. If I could have, the usurpers Adam and Eve wouldn’t have been shown mercy, I would have shown them death and remade new mothers and new fathers. Humanity would not be the weak and pathetic creatures they are at his hands. No… I have plans for humanity… that’s for sure!” Lucifer boomed as Nathaniel felt his voice calling the beast out.<br />
<br />
It was as amazing as it was intense. Nathaniel could feel that sinister side coming out more and more, free to do as it pleased without restraint. He wanted so much more to happen, to command and be there to witness it. Fathers of sons would be sexual with one another; sons would please their fathers and be rewarded the seed that created them as a treat, corrupting the two simultaneously and making them a part of his family. Sons would reward their fathers similarly when the father hungered for cum. Large orgies would ensue, all men, regardless or relation would join in and be what we were created as. Suddenly Nathaniel heard Lucifer cackle, enjoying his vision and ambition, while he grasped at what he had just consumed. Slowly, a writhing and squirming mass came out of Lucifer’s body. Its’ darkness swirled with billowy and pluming black sulfuric smoke while at the core was a sinister, but brilliant crimson light that swirled around itself. It was alive… it was conscious and most importantly… it was free. Nathaniel grinned, his eyes still vacant, but the sinister smirk on his face grew ten times as he watched it not only come out of Lucifer, but rushed into Nathaniel with a great force, causing him to stumble backward a bit having not expected that. Then, suddenly as it took root into his being, Nathaniel groaned the deepest and darkest groan that had ever been uttered on the Earth.<br />
<br />
“I. AM. FREE!!!” Nathaniel bellowed as his eyes flashed dark crimson energy, his arms outstretched, enjoying the freedom that was now his.<br />
<br />
“Lucien, I am done with you! Close this portal and let your new master do his work, fore much needs to be done!” Lucifer commanded with Lucien simply nodding his head in complete obedience.<br />
<br />
Just like that, the portal closed in an instant and Lucien was there with his new master, wondering what was going to happen next. It was exciting for him and Lucien couldn’t wait to see what was in store for himself or the rest of creation.</p>
