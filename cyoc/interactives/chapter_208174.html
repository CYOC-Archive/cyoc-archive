<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You manage to catch a glimpse of the suit even as you are jostled to-and-fro within your what is behemoth bovine girlfriends gasp, the sight making you feel even more flushed than you already were from your changed lover&#39;s new length. She seems to have picked out another minotaur suit for you, though there are some rather... Significant differences between this one and her own. It&#39;s not quite so tall, but it&#39;s definitely bigger than you. It&#39;s hard to tell like this, with the suit hanging empty off the rack, though this one seems like it would still be at least a good seven feet, maybe even as large as nine. A bit more manageable compared to hers, but very much gargantuan by your standards. Another thing that you can tell right away is that this one is obviously more feminine, the frame seeming softer, less muscular than her own. It still looks strong and powerful, but instead of sculpted abs it looks a bit more plush and cushy, the thighs large and soft, and the hips and rear rather wide as well. Much more striking, however, are the breasts. Both sets. The suit is well-endowed indeed, a pair of soft, furred orbs draped across it&#39;s chest. But along the belly there&#39;s also a pink, squishy udder bulging out, along with a bit of chub giving a bit of a matronly look overall. The fur pattern is also different. Your girlfriend&#39;s suit (And, by extension, she) had tawny coloration, whereas this one more resembled your traditional Holstein. White along most of the body, with black accents, a couple of splotches here and there. The headpiece is suspended from the costume&#39;s torso. A broad-snouted cow-like face, white except for a dark spot over one of the eyes. This one, however, has much longer hair, a flowing black, with streaks of white, with a fringe over the eyes and cascading down the back, and seeming to have a few braids mixed in with the locks. The horns are smaller too, just stubs poking up from under the hairline, just next to a pair of cow ears. It seemed sort of tribal in a way, all at once having a strange fierceness to it, but also tenderness. <br />
<br />
You squirm in your girlfriend&#39;s mighty grasp, your mouth agape. She just beams at you. &quot;It&#39;s absolutely perfect! Don&#39;t you think? We&#39;ll match! I&#39;ll get it ready for you.&quot; She says enthusiastically. You blink, not sure how to respond. You really aren&#39;t so sure how to respond. This whole situation has just been bizarre from the get go, and it just escalated from there. Admittedly trying on a bunch of skinsuits (that now you can tell do, in fact, seem to be magical) you found laying around in a haunted house required a bit of a logical leap, but it was certainly kind of exciting. Weird, but still! Then she wanted to try on not only a minotaur suit, but a male one... Stranger still. You never really thought too much on your sexuality, but you never thought of yourself as gay. Still, you loved her, and wanted to make her happy, so you went with it. And, yes, once you dove in there was something oddly kinky about the whole thing. Seeing your girlfriend as a huge, monstrous bull man, and the dissonance between her body and her behavior, not only strangely endearing, but, as it turns out, wildly kinky, as your own groin has been telling you. But now she wanted to turn you into a minotaur too, and a female one at that. You don&#39;t know just what you think of her plan. You don&#39;t know if you are fully comfortable undergoing not only a change of species, but also sex as well. But... She did. And maybe you should, just to humor her? After all, maybe you&#39;ll like it... She seems to be enjoying yourself, and the whole situation is kinda wildly arousing. Still, it&#39;s a tough call, and you just aren&#39;t sure if you are ready to try something like this. Your girlfriend, however, does not seem to have any idea whatsoever that you are hesitating at all. She&#39;s already turned the costume around, the back seam wide open for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you go! Ready! Okay, just hold still. I&#39;ll help you i- Uh, ooops!&quot; <br />
<br />
You are shaken out of your introspection by the sound of her voice as she starts shoving you towards the costume, making you wriggle around a bit. No, you can&#39;t commit to this just now. You have to tell her that you need to think it over! Though it seems that she wasn&#39;t expecting you to be quite so active. As you move around and try to talk to her she lets go fall as you are brought up against the suit! At least... You think it was accidental. In any case, you don&#39;t seem like you have much of a choice in the matter anymore! It seems that you are going to be a minotaur whether you want it or not. Though you tumble as you are released from her grasp, the fold in the suit&#39;s back filling your view as you plunge forward. She was in the process of placing you into the suit, after all, and rather haphazardly as well. Your eyes open wise, trying to hold your arms out in front of you to catch yourself, though you just end up collapsing into the suit head-first! It all happens in an instant, though your thoughts are racing, and everything seems to be running at slow-motion for you. As darkness fills your view and you can feel the soft fabric caress your nude body, at first you just think that you&#39;ll just end up seeming a buffoon and your girlfriend is going to have to pull you out. And yet... You can feel your arms land within the suit&#39;s legs, the inner material squeezing around them tightly, feeling smooth, warm, and rubbery in a way, almost fleshy, as your hands land within where the feet are supposed to go. As they settle in they, as well as your arms, start to feel hot tingly, flesh beginning to feel unbearably tight. Before you even realize what is happening your hands start to clench, feeling hard, stiff, fusing with the suit&#39;s materials as they start to form into a pair of thick, sturdy hooves. Your arms as well, fusing into the lining of the costume, starting to feel thicker, stronger, a bit less flexible as well, as they start to lengthen, sticking out in front of you as they merge to the skinsuit, rippling with new fur and muscle, your wrists crackling as the shift into digitigrade ankles to support your hooves, whilst your elbows pop, shifting into knee joints. As you feel your biceps starting to thicken up, feeling softer and fuzzier, a wave of horror washes over you. You are, indeed, going to be a minotaur it would seem. But not her better half...</p>
