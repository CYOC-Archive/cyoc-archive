<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well YEAH!” Paige exclaimed a little too loudly, “I wanna see you become a baby like me then I’ll have a playmate” she grinned.<br />
<br />
“Ok, ok, wow I didn’t expect you to get on board with this so fast.”<br />
<br />
The two year old just lightly giggled in response before sucking her thumb.<br />
<br />
Still holding her precious baby girl in her arms Sarah carried her to the kitchen where she set the toddler down. Picking up Paige’s phone from the counter she scrolled through the list of contacts and asked, “What’s your brother’s name?” Pulling her thumb from her mouth for a few seconds Paige answered, “Mark, and his wife’s name is Heather.” She thought it would be a good idea to give both for future reference.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, and it goes without being said that I’ll do all the talking since you sound nothing like a grown up right now” Sarah admitted.<br />
<br />
“Neither will you in a couple of minutes” Paige playfully teased her soon to be baby mommy.<br />
<br />
“That all depends on if the two of them say yes” she grinned before dialing Mark’s number hoping that he would pick up at three o’ clock on a Friday afternoon.<br />
<br />
After three rings the call went through and Mark’s voice sounded from the other end.<br />
<br />
“Hello Paige?”<br />
<br />
“Sorry Mark it isn’t Paige I’m just using her phone. This is Sarah, Zane’s sister and Paige’s sister-in-law calling.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah Paige mentioned you a couple of times but we never really met or talked until now. Anyway how’s Paige doing?...Is she alright? I heard about Zane’s death and I called her the day after and also talked with her at the funeral but since she was so depressed I’ve been keeping my distance for the past month, me and Heather that is” Mark replied.<br />
<br />
Hearing Mark’s long-winded explanation Sarah was quick to reassure the man, “She’s doing fine…actually she’s been doing better than ever since this morning but that’s beside the point. I’m calling you because I have a babysitting job for you and your wife and Paige told me it’d be right up your alley given your situation” Sarah quickly said while being sensitive to the fact they couldn’t have children by not voice it aloud.<br />
<br />
“Sounds interesting. What are the details?” he asked curiously.<br />
<br />
“Two toddlers, both baby girls around the age of two and who are still in diapers. Me and Paige need someone to look after them for the whole weekend and don’t worry we already have all the supplies on hand to take care of them” Sarah explained before pausing to let the man answer.<br />
<br />
“And how come neither you or Paige can take care of the girls yourselves?” Mark questioned in confusion.<br />
<br />
“It’s complicated and I can’t really explain why over the phone. If you and Heather agree to babysit and come on over to Paige’s house today then I can tell you everything” Sarah said trying not to sound so cryptic, “But if you and Heather can’t do it this weekend because you’re both busy or something then me and Paige completely understand, we’ll find someone else to watch the girls.”<br />
<br />
“Actually the two of us have nothing better to do this weekend so watching two toddlers would be alright. There isn’t a catch though, these girls aren’t still going through that terrible two’s phase?”<br />
<br />
“No, no they’re both very well behaved for their age I can assure you” she promised quickly, afraid she was about to lose the guy.<br />
<br />
A brief laugh came from the other end of the line, “I was just kidding ya there Sarah. Even if the girls are little devils my wife would probably still would be happy to watch them, she’s got the whole baby fever thing bad and so do I to an extent. Let me just put you on hold for a moment to discuss it with her, “Hey honey could you come here for a moment? I got some great news to tell you!” he called out before there was silence, then seconds later some muffled dialogue between the two which ended with an excited squeal. Hearing that noise made Sarah smile as she knew it was a done deal and that she would be spending the rest of the weekend with Paige as a baby.<br />
<br />
A moment later Mark’s voice returned, “Okay I’m back and Heather all for the babysitting job. However we still have some things to do around our place so we won’t be able to make it over there for another two hours, say around five o’ clock we’ll meet you and Paige?”<br />
<br />
“That’ll be perfect” she answered as she wanted to spend some toddler time with just Paige before their babysitters showed up.<br />
<br />
“Great. We see you both at five. Bye” Mark said before hanging up.<br />
<br />
Putting Paige’s phone back down on the counter Sarah turned to looked down at her little girl who was bouncing up and down in place, the two year old having heard every sentence of her conversation with her brother.<br />
<br />
“Since you’re already up to speed what do you say we go turn mommy into a toddler now?” Sarah cheekily grinned.<br />
<br />
“I say let’s do it!” Paige exclaimed already excitedly running in the direction of the hallway, intending to lead her to the door to the basement and youth machine.<br />
<br />
“Whoa slow down there baby girl. First mommy needs to grab something important from your nursery” she explained causing the over eager child to stop in her tracks.<br />
<br />
“Oh, okay then” Paige replied before changing directions and dashing off to her nursery. Sarah calmed walked after her and upon entering her baby room found the young girl patiently waiting for her.<br />
<br />
“So whatcha need from here?” she asked in typical childlike clueless fashion.<br />
<br />
Chuckling to herself at the little one’s ignorance Sarah walked over to the changing table and plucked a pamper from the bottom shelf, “Mommy needs her own diaper for when she becomes a baby silly. Or did you forget Paige that babies can’t go around without otherwise they’ll have an accident all over the floor?”<br />
<br />
Paige’s cheeks burned red in embarrassment at forgetting something so simple. Instead of replying she just sucked her thumb silently.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm?” Sarah pondered out loud as she eyed the closet where she stashed the toddler clothes she recently bought for Paige to wear, “I think I also want to wear something else in addition to my diaper” she said as she opened the doors to the closet and began rifling through the pile, quickly settling on a horizontal red and white striped dress that would come down to just below her diaper. “This one will do” Sarah said proudly as she cradled the clothing along with the padded garment.<br />
<br />
“I wanna get something too!” Paige announced eagerly toddling over to the clothes pile.<br />
<br />
She ended up picking out a light purple shirt that would do nothing to cover her diaper and that also featured the my little pony character Twilight Sparkle on the front. Paige mentioned that my little pony friendship is magic is her favorite children’s show of all time while they were in the clothing section of the store. So she ended up buying a whole bunch of shirts in that theme for her to the toddler’s obvious delight. Seeing that she was having trouble putting it on Sarah helped the baby girl get the shirt over her head and her arms through the sleeves. Then with a few some tugs she got the bottom down to hang just above the waistband of her padding.<br />
<br />
Now that she had her clothes and Paige had hers the two left the nursery and headed for the basement to pay a visit to a certain machine.<br />
<br />
“I’m so excited to become a baby again” Sarah commented out loud as they walked side by side, “Did you know that you’re the reason I became an abdl Paige?”<br />
<br />
Paige was surprised by that fact, “Really?”<br />
<br />
“Uh huh. When Zane told me your secret fetish all those months ago I ended up doing research into the subject and next thing I knew I had fallen in love with the idea of regressing back to an age where I needed diapers. Diapers are going to be what I’ll love most of all about being a baby again. I’ll also admit that when I agreed to watch over you I had hoped to find some way to use the machine myself from time to time” she revealed as she reached for the basement door and opened it.<br />
<br />
“Well then its your lucky day mommy cause your wish is about to come true” Paige said.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for being so understanding Paige” she replied as the two descend the staircase into Zane’s lab with Paige holding onto the railing for safety given her small size.<br />
<br />
Upon reaching the bottom the two made their way over to the Youth Booth which still stood in the same dusty corner. The door was still hanging open from when Paige had used it earlier in the morning. Placing the pamper and dress on a nearby cardboard box Sarah faced the machine then looked down at her charge.<br />
<br />
“So what do I do exactly?”<br />
<br />
“It’s simple just walk in, closed the door and push the red button on the wall to start it. Then when its over you’ll be little just like me” Paige explained.<br />
<br />
Once again excited by the idea of becoming a thumb sucking, diaper wearing toddler like Paige Sarah nodded and throwing caution to the wind practically jumped into the booth and shutting the door behind her. Not two seconds later did the machine spring to life with humming sound.<br />
<br />
“Oh Paige its starting…ooo I can feel myself getting younger already” Sarah called out from within already sounding like a teenager in just the span of a few seconds.<br />
<br />
Three more seconds passed.<br />
<br />
“I’ve become a child again…I think I’m nine years old right now.”<br />
<br />
Three more seconds passed and then the machine stopped as Paige heard a high pitched and very babyish sounding giggling coming from within.<br />
<br />
Overwhelmed with suspense she was relieved when Sarah finally opened the door and stepped out of the booth allowing Paige to see that she was now…</p>
