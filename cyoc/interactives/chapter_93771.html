<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Something strange enters the store.  You cannot think of anything to equate it to; rather, it looks like an amalgamation of random parts stuck together, although somewhat humanoid in shape.  One eye looks relatively like that of a normal human; however, the other has a slit-shaped pupil inside of an emerald-green iris.  As you stare, you note that the slitted eye even has a nictating membrane, which makes you think of a snake or crocodile.  Two black ram-like horns curl out from the forehead and back over the skull, which is covered in leathery, gray skin similar to that of an elephant.  Furthermore, where there should be ears, instead are a pair of fin-like appendages with iridescent scales.  Each hand only has three fingers, each of which comes to a point, and are dark green.  You also spot a tail proudly trailing along behind, but it is nothing like your own fluffy addition.  Instead, it has a mottled lizard-like appearance.  Despite the startlingly odd appearance, you feel the effect is intensified by the fact that the person is clothed in a strikingly classic suit, which is obviously tailor-made and of designer quality.  You assume that this person must be one of the Game Master&#39;s prior unwitting victims, and has returned to finally be transformed back into human form.  You gaze on empathetically as the man (or so you assume from the shape) strides over confidently to the Game Master, and opens his slightly elongated mouth to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well well, looks like you have another customer,&quot;  a surprisingly human voice issues from the creature&#39;s mouth as he indicates you with a nod of his head.  &quot;Should I come back later?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Game Master looked up, and from his response, you realize the entrant is someone he is familiar with.  &quot;Don&#39;t mind him, he&#39;s the new help.  So you are back again, are you?  The claws weren&#39;t enough?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man looked down at his abnormal hands with what could only be described as a look of satisfaction.  &quot;I admit, it took a while to learn how to type with only three fingers, but now even the secretary can&#39;t keep up with me.  And I have found them rather helpful when it comes to free climbing.  Adaptability is a human&#39;s strongest suit, as I always say,&quot; he stated confidently, then turned to you.  &quot;A tail, an appropriate choice for a first transformation.  Mind you, it does take some adjusting when it comes to seating arrangements, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed.  I haven&#39;t tried the furry route yet, seemed too tame for me when I first started, but this...&quot;  he says as he reaches around and runs your tail through his claw appreciatively, &quot;...maybe I was too quick to judge.&quot;  <br />
<br />
You freeze like a deer in the headlights, feeling somewhat violated, despite the fact that the tail is only a part of you temporarily.  The Game Master notices your discomfort, but responds nonchalantly, &quot;Don&#39;t annoy my assistant, Luke.  He&#39;s not one of you;  he isn&#39;t even a &#39;he&#39; normally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke doesn&#39;t seem deterred, but still looks you over.  &quot;Well, at the moment, I&#39;m not sure if even I can still be called a &#39;he,&#39;&quot;  Luke smiles, leaning over.  &quot;The game last month happened to switch my bottom half for female, so if you&#39;re looking to try something new...&quot;  he whispers confidentially in your ear.<br />
<br />
Your curiousity is only outweighed by your discomfiture, and you&#39;re tempted to flee.  The Game Master then broke in, &quot; If you&#39;re ready to get started, shall we move on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, of course...&quot; Luke turned back to the Game Master, but not before throwing you a wink, made all the more disconcerting by the third eyelid.  &quot;Which game will it be this time?  Memory Morph?  Pin the Tail on the Human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What type of change were you looking to get?&quot; the Game Master inquired, obviously skipping the usual banter about risks and rules.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, in honor of your new helper,&quot;  Luke nods in your direction, &quot;how about we go with something soft this time?  It could prove interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Wheel of &#39;Fur&#39;-tune it is,&quot;  the Game Master deadpanned as you gape in disbelief, and the customary mirror popped up.<br />
<br />
Out of nowhere, a large wheel appeared on the floor of the shop.  However, rather than being one wheel, you notice that there are actually two smaller wheels set inside the larger wheel.  While the large outer wheel had pictures of all sorts of furred creatures, the middle wheel had various body parts, and the inner wheel was covered in gradated colors.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you would prefer a more natural selection, I can of course eliminate the inner wheel,&quot;  the Game Master offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;In for a penny, in for a pound,&quot; Luke grinned.  &quot;Somehow I don&#39;t think the color will matter that much.&quot;<br />
<br />
You notice something, and can&#39;t help but ask, &quot;What if it lands on &#39;Bankrupt?&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All of the changes are undone,&quot; the Game Master replied.  &quot;Luke here goes back to being a regular human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All of my hard work undone,&quot;  Luke sighed exaggeratedly.  &quot;I&#39;d have to start over again.&quot;<br />
<br />
An arrow appeared in front of Luke, and at a look of approval from the Game Master, Luke leaned over and spun the wheel.  The middle wheel turned in the opposite direction from the outer, while the inner wheel matched the outer, albeit at a much slower rater of speed.  After a few revolutions, the wheel finally came to a stop, the arrow pointing at &quot;kangaroo,&quot;  &quot;feet,&quot;  and a shade of blue which was slightly lighter than navy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hang on a second, let me get these off,&quot;  Luke cried out as he sat down and quickly untied his shoelaces, removing his obviously expensive shoes and argyle socks.  As Luke wiggled his still-human toes, you notice a gradual change taking place.  As Luke watched gleefully, his feet began to elongate and darken.  His toes begin to fuse, resulting in four claws, the middle two toes being fuzed up to the claws.  Short dark-blue fur sprouted along the top of his feet, while the bottom grew a rough pad.  However, the change did not stop there, and you notice an odd change in the proportions of his legs as his knees appeared to travel higher, his hipbones shortening, and his lower legs elongating.  The alterations caused the expensive yet delicate trousers to rip in a few locations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, guess I should have removed those too,&quot;  Luke pouted.  &quot;Oh well, I&#39;m going to need to have new ones made anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke struggled to his feet, and in spite of yourself you lend him a hand.  He smiled gleefully at you, but thankfully, this time the smile was related to his excitement.  At first he tried to take a step, but after teetering and nearly tipping over, it was apparent to all that Luke would need to move in a different fashion.<br />
<br />
The Game Master waved the Wheel of &quot;Fur&quot;-tune out of existence, and gathering his courage, Luke took a slight hop forward, barely managing to keep his balance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like this is going to take some practice,&quot;  Luke declared eagerly.  &quot;Good think I came with my chauffeur;  my private car will probably need a few adjustments.  Thanks again, see you in a few weeks!&quot;  Luke called back to the Game Master as he bounded out of the store happily carrying his shoes and socks.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?!&quot;  you ask the Game Master incredulously.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was a transformation addict,&quot;  the Game Master responded without missing a beat, returning to his project.  &quot;Although they prefer to be known as &#39;transformation connoisseurs.&#39;&quot;  Noting your confused look, the Game Master continued, &quot;Some people just like the process of transforming, and it does not matter to them what that transformation is.  The ones who have enough money and time can indulge their hobby to the utmost.  Take Luke there, he runs a multi-million dollar stock trading company, and makes enough income to ensure that no one can complain about his private life.  There&#39;s quite a few of them;  they get together from time to time, each one trying to outdo the other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Considering your own financial situation, it is beyond your comprehension that someone would not only choose to transform themselves into something inhuman for mere entertainment, but alter their entire lifestyle to do so, no matter the cost.  To each his own, you suppose, but you quietly ponder the baffling complexity of human nature as you clean up some scraps which were torn from Luke&#39;s trousers during his change.  <br />
<br />
As the evening winds down, you are looking forward to finally going home when...</p>
