<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The bedroom soon looked like it had when Jared lived and slept in it, is was a mess! The bed ransacked, dresser drawers pulled halfway out and what was inside of them then set hanging out is such a disarray.<br />
<br />
Although the closet was full of his clothing, the thought of his naked self had become a distant consideration; he had to find that magical belt buckle!<br />
<br />
More than an hour had passed as Jared sat disgruntled on a round rug in the middle of his bedroom floor. He sat there and scanned the room, peering under his bed, but there he saw only dust bunnies and some dirty dishes that had stiffened food still stuck to the surfaces.<br />
<br />
Nearly ready to cry out of lost hope, Jared heard a squeaking of the floorboard at the top step of the stairs leading to the second floor bedrooms.<br />
<br />
Jared turned his head toward the door just as it slowly opened.<br />
<br />
The door then was swung open harshly, leaving in the doorway the friend Jared had all but forgot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey their big sire, you are out of uniform, no black hide, no black Angus fur, no tail, and I see too no balls, but then you were the one who had more balls about nearly everything we got in trouble for doing!&quot; So John said, he then bursting into a cute grin, both knew the other had had their time with what the magic belt buckle could wheel.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sick, I want back what that damn farmer cut off and then tossed my balls to his dogs for a treat! I fella can't begin his life looking like this!&quot; Jared said, as he got up to a standing position, motioning with both hands at his smoothed groin below where he boasted yet of a male member resembling that of his bull like bovine form.<br />
<br />
John stood there with that, &quot;I know something that you do not know,&quot; sort of grin. He dug a hand down into his blue jean pocket and slowly withdrew the magical buckle.<br />
<br />
Jared looked more than just stunned, he beamed with delight at the possibility was then real of his regaining the balls given to two farm dogs as a treat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got the buckle,&quot; Jared said, almost screaming at John, his voice filled with his own delight for finding it, and of what he planned to try to make right.<br />
<br />
John held it firmly, as if he thought of not giving it back to its recent owner.<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; said Jared as he reached out a hand and took note that John continued to grasp it tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I learned some about this thing, it grants wishes alright, but can respond to questions put to it, as it likes to write out answers on the face or a mirror.&quot; John informed Jared, as he turned to walk down the upstairs hallway and entered the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Jared followed John, the two stood there quite ignoring Jared being naked, both had tried life as living like naked animals, bulls as they were, and from doing so they paid little concern about one or the other standing openly unclothed before someone else.<br />
<br />
John rubbed the belt buckle alert with his thumb caressing over the shiny metal.<br />
<br />
Jared watched in silence, he still trusted John, although if John wanted Jared out of the way he need only ask to return his friend to be again as a bull, or worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic buckle, hear me now, I have a question to know an answer!&quot; John spoke, as the buckle glowed alive, humming as it had done before, sounding like the noise made by a giant dynamo. <br />
<br />
On the mirror spread a coating of steam, and in the foggy mirror an unseen finger wrote answers.<br />
<br />
&quot;READY, POSE YOUR QUESTIONS!&quot; so wrote the finger in the fog covered mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;My friend here has spent a long span of time being as and doing as would a Angus bull. During this time a farmer....&quot; John speaking, his questioning of the buckle trailed off, as the mirror steamed over and the finger wrote, &quot;YES, I KNOW OF IT ALL, HE WAS GELDED, HIS MALE TESTICLES REMOVED AS ARE MANY THOUSANDS EACH AND EVERY DAY ON FARMS ALL ACROSS THE LAND.&quot;<br />
<br />
John turned to look at his stunned friend, he then massaged the buckle some more, harder this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please then, can Jared regrow or get back what was taken from him?&quot; John posed then the main question.<br />
<br />
The noise coming from around the buckle became a high pitched screaming whine, the buckle glowed more brightly than it had ever when a wish was posed and some youth became then as animal.<br />
<br />
&quot;TWO POSSIBLE COURSES CAN REPLACE WHAT WAS TAKEN AND LOST. THE EASY WAY IS TO ASK AND RETURN TO THE PLACE, FORM, AND TIME BEFORE THE SITUATION OCCURRED. RUN, YOU MUST, AWAY FROM THE HERD OF COWS WANDERING TOWARD THE BARN, AS IT WAS THERE YOU WERE CORNERED AND THE DEED DONE.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even as these words stretched to fill the mirror, they quickly faded away, as with a gust of wind there in the bathroom the mirror fogged over again and the unseen finger wrote more.<br />
<br />
&quot;RETURN YOU MUST TO BE AS THAT BULL ANIMAL FORM, TO LIVE OUT YOUR DEALT LENGTH OF TIME AND RETURN AT THE APPOINTED MOMENT, TO TAKE UP LIVING AS WHAT YOU WERE BORN AND DESTINED.&quot;<br />
<br />
The words faded, and the mirror fogged over again as the finger wrote its second possible way for Jared to follow.<br />
<br />
&quot;ANOTHER PATH IS EASY AS WELL, MERELY ASK FOR WHAT WAS TAKEN FROM YOU, AND IT SHALL BY THE POWERS GRANTED TO THIS ONE, ALL WILL GROW BACK, THAT WHAT WAS LOST, AND AS WELL THAT OF WHAT YOU WERE. IN ESSENCE, THE REGROWTH, GAINING AGAIN THE ABILITY TO MATE AND BREED SHALL DEEM A CHANGE IN THE COURSING PATH OF TIME ITSELF.&quot;<br />
<br />
Whoosh, and the mirror fogged yet another time.<br />
<br />
&quot;GONE SHALL ALL MEMORY OF YOU BE FROM THOSE WHO KNEW YOU EVER EXISTED.  A RETURN TO BEING BOVINE, BULL, AND THE HERD SIRE WILL BE FOREVER YOUR CHANGED AND NEW DESTINY. YOU SHALL HAVE AGAIN YOU LOST MALENESS, BUT GAINING THEM WILL FORCE THE LOSS OF KNOWLEDGE LEARNED AND KNOWING OF YOUR EXISTENCE. IGNORANCE SHALL FILL THE MIND AS TESTICLES WILL AGAIN HANG BETWEEN STRONG HOCKS.&quot;<br />
<br />
The words faded, the mirror did not fill again with steam, as it seemed to both friends that what would return missing testicles came with renewed danger and or the loss of everything but the thrill to mate as if a bull understood his own passions and desire.</p>
