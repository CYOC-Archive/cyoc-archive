<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary was staring at him with a giggle: John look so ridicolous! Maybe this would be pefect to make her sister leave him. What a pity she can&#39;t prove it! John was red with shame and, taking off the dress, tried to say “ehm... I thik... I think I&#39;ve found something yours, miss...” with a shameful giggle. Mary look ati him getting her nightdress and seriously said “Oh, I can see, Mr. Smith... I can see and I think I&#39;m expected to say this to my parents and my sister...”<br />
John gaze at her scary and, giving her back the dress, try to explain “oh no, miss... It&#39;s not like you think... I&#39;m not a pervert or similar... I... I.. I was just curious”. Mary smiled and laughed “curious? Curious about what?” finding fun ribbing him “Oh, you see...” John tried to answer “you see, I just was curious to see how a skirt fits me” he confessed blushing. “And you don&#39;t find this pervert, Mr?” “Oh... in a cartain manner you may be right... but I&#39;m not a sodomite... I perfectly know what his the role of a man and what that of a woman... And I proud to...” but she interrupted him “I have understood, stop explaining. So are you interested about female things?” “this is not what I was trying to say, miss” “oh don&#39;t misunderstand me, man. I&#39;ve understood you&#39;re happy to be a man and you will a perfect husband for my sister. Only answer sincerely to my question and I won&#39;t tell nothing to Gabrielle and my parents. Does femininity whet your curiosity?” she challenged him. But he seemed not to understand her and simply said with a smile “what do you mean?”. So she tried to say this directly without laughin (and keeping a serious face instead!) “I mean: if you had a far possibility, do you like to spend a few days in a girl body? Just for &#39;curiosity&#39;?”.<br />
He was silent for a moment: he had never thought what is like to be a girl, but he perfectly knew that, if he was given the far chance to try something I haven&#39;t never tried, nothing could stop his curiosity! “O yes, I think that if this was possible I&#39;d like to spend only a few day as the fairer sex... but only for curiosity, do you know?” he answered with a smile thinking at the same time that his future sister in law was a nice and very understanding person. Mary smiled at him and solemnly said “it seems this is our fortunate day! I&#39;m curious too!” she was lying only to convince him but he doesn&#39;t know “please follow me, just for a walk, then I will explain you!”<br />
So, finding her fun, he followed her through a path, silently and smiling at the beginning. After a curve the path they were following leads through the wood, along the river. “Could you tell me where are we going? I&#39;ve never been here” he asked. The girl soon asked “we are going to visit a woman who can satisfy our curiosity”. He thought this was a sort of joke and asked laughing “oh... and how can she help us” they passed a wooden bridge and after that Mary answered gazing him “Mr. Smith, I&#39;m not joking.” she indicated a small house and said “the woman in that house can swap our bodies so we can find for a few day what&#39;s like to be the other sex” she made the best to be convincing while saying the worlds &#39;few days&#39;. Mary&#39;s serious glance convinced him she wasn&#39;t joking. He smiled and followe her. They arrived to the house and John knocked. A woman, that seemed to be in her fourties opened and made them enter. Mary explained what they wanted and the woman said them that she had what they need. She quickly prepared a strange concoction and pour it into two cups. Then she gave them the cups. Before drinking John wanted to satisfy other curiosities. “How muche will the body swap last?” he asked. The witch slowly answered “it has not a fixed duration. You will decide it. You just have to bath together in the river at midnight for half an hour. But remember: if the girl will be wet, even with a drop of river water when full moon is in the sky tha change will be permanent and you can change back only coming here again and asking me another potion. Consider that for a second potion I will ask you a cow and three chickens as payment”.<br />
John considered it a moment and then smiling at Mary said “it will be full moon in two weeks, so this won&#39;t be a problem, since we are going to do that bath in a few days!” he drunk the potion hasty. Mary giggled and confirmed “oh yes, man you&#39;re right” with a malignant gaze that John couldn&#39;t notice. She drunk the potion too.<br />
In just a moment, without strange feeling that often occurred in tales like this, they had their bodies swapped.<br />
“It worked! I&#39;m so happy! I think I can be considered the happiest man in word! Ehm... I want to say, the happiest girl in the word!” John, now in Mary body said. Walking to home she couldn&#39;t express how was strange but at the same time exciting to be in a famale body. She was finding sensations she never could find as a male. The most strange thing was walking without feel the male &#39;presence&#39; between &#39;her&#39; legs. Fortunately, being not so tall and 16 years old, she had not very large breasts, so it wasn&#39;t to strange to have an extra weight in that side.<br />
Mary, in John body, wasn&#39;t really so happy, but still smiled. &#39;He&#39; liked be a girl and never really dreamed to be male, but this, if &#39;he&#39; can really make it permanent, could be the only solution to her problem: he could live forever with her beloved sister. There was also the silver lining: being male in their society had a lot of advantages. And he would be very glad to make the new girl experienced all the pain that their society caused to the weaker sex. So, before reaching home, Mary (in John body) whispered “I hope you will remember your new role and be respectful and submissive to your father this days you&#39;re going to spend as a girl”. John in her body smiled and assured her “I&#39;ll be a good girl, don&#39;t worry. I perfectly know what is the role of a woman in family and in society. You can be sure I won&#39;t never betray my values only for being &#39;on the other side of the river&#39;”. “Good, now, remember to call me John, to use male pronouns with me and to treat me as the guy I&#39;m now. I will do the same with you calling you Mary and treating you as the girl you are. Even in private and for all the duration of the swap”. Mary nodded. From this moment on we also will follow this instruction and will say &#39;Mary&#39; intending &#39;John in Mary&#39;s body&#39; and &#39;John&#39; intending &#39;Mary in John body&#39;: this will be more shorter and rapid.<br />
So, reached Brady&#39;s house, Mary, happy for her new curious adventure entered. John, instead, waited out the door Gabrielle and, once she arrived kissed her hand gently.<br />
Then he came back to his new fields repeating at himself “only waiting for full moon. Then I will play out my plan and marry Gabrielle”.</p>
