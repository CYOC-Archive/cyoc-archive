<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the werewolf disc jockey at the Halloween dance finished honoring his request to play &#9835;Do You Believe In Magic (In A Young Girl&#39;s Heart)?&#9835;, recently created weretiger Harold Jenkins continued to dance with his fiance, the weretigress Virginia McCoy.<br />
Harold couldn&#39;t believe the dramatic and wonderful turn his life had taken lately.<br />
While not something he planned to do in his immediate future, Harold loved being a weretiger now almost as much as he loved Virginia.<br />
Part of him realized that the two went hand in hand, or paw in paw.<br />
There would still be a place in his heart for his first wife, who Harold lost to cancer.<br />
But everyone who ever suggested it before was right.<br />
Mourning was over. It WAS finally time to move on, and Harold couldn&#39;t think of a better way to do so than with the wonderful lady before him.<br />
After their third number together, Virginia stopped and looked at him. &quot;Harold, you&#39;re quite a dancer. You really know how to shake your tail,&quot; she said with a smile.<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t danced in years. Not since...&quot; and then he stopped himself from mentioning Eliza.<br />
&quot;I know dearest,&quot; replied Virginia, giving him a brief but reassuring hug. &quot;But I need a break, besides needing to get back to chaperoning.&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand honey,&quot; he said, offering Virginia his furry arm before the weretigers walked back to her station near the refreshments table.<br />
But as they approached, their good mood started to turn as they heard Migumi Tachibana say, &quot;How did this get back out here?&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Virginia, as they drew near.<br />
&quot;The bowl with the punch you said was spiked Ms. McCoy,&quot; replied Migumi.<br />
A cold chill ran down Harold&#39;s spine as Virginia asked, &quot;How can you tell the difference?&quot;<br />
&quot;Needing to attend to all my duties hosting the dance, I left the spiked bowl in the cafeteria kitchen to dump later. I can tell the difference between the two because, despite both of them being plastic and otherwise identical in appearance, this one has a slight chip around the rim.&quot;<br />
Virginia turned to look at Harold, but he was already trying to find the answer to the question on her mind.<br />
WHERE WAS MEL?<br />
Still being new to were society, Harold couldn&#39;t easily pick out his daughter&#39;s scent from everyone else there, despite the fact that she was still a normal human being.<br />
Then Harold spotted her.<br />
Mel was being led out the gym door into the night by a group of teenagers, as they all turned to the left to head away from Moon Lake High and into the woods behind the school property.<br />
<b>&quot;MEL!&quot;</b> roared Harold, as he and Virginia started off after the group.<br />
<br />
BACK ON THE DANCE FLOOR...<br />
Trevor Tyson didn&#39;t want to be here.<br />
Or at least, the werebull didn&#39;t want to be on the dance floor with Anna, another werecow.<br />
If Trevor was going to dance with anyone, he wanted it to be with Melissa Jenkins.<br />
He kept trying to get away from her, but Anna wouldn&#39;t take &quot;No&quot; for an answer.<br />
Then Trevor stopped in his tracks as he heard Mel&#39;s father roar his daughter&#39;s name.<br />
Trevor looked around and saw two familiar weretigers heading rapidly for the exit.<br />
Trevor tried to follow them, but Anna grabbed his hand again.<br />
&quot;Just where do you think you&#39;re going?&quot; she asked coldly.<br />
&quot;After my girlfriend,&quot; he replied, pulling away from Anna.<br />
&quot;But she&#39;s right here,&quot; protested Anna, grabbing his hand again.<br />
&quot;No, she isn&#39;t,&quot; snarled Trevor, pulling away from Anna more violently than he did the first time. &quot;Now you listen and you listen good. Even if you thought there ever was anything between us, it&#39;s over now! I LOVE MELISSA JENKINS!&quot; he told her very loudly.<br />
&quot;If anything happens to her, I will never forgive myself, and if I find out you had <i>anything</i> to do with what&#39;s going on right now, I swear I <b>will</b> kill you before I kill myself!&quot; he vowed.<br />
Anna cowered in fear as she saw Trevor&#39;s eyes suddenly turn a very angry shade of red!<br />
Without another word between them, Trevor turned and ran toward the gym exit.<br />
<br />
OUTSIDE...<br />
Melissa Jenkins wasn&#39;t quite sure what was going on at the moment.<br />
All she knew for sure was that she was feeling very hot and very excited as a group of teenagers were leading her out the exterior exit of the high school gym and turning left to head into the woods behind the high school.<br />
Mel looked around for her date, but didn&#39;t see Trevor among them.<br />
<i>He&#39;ll be along soon,</i> she thought, feeling the dampening moisture increase between her legs, the nipples of her small but pert breast harden, and the increased arousal of wanting to claim the werebull as hers and become his werecow.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
The group of teenagers were excited to be heading into the woods.<br />
Some of them had also drank the punch Alice Decrux tainted with the aphrodisiac she called <i>Love Potion #9.</i> Others, being teenage weres, were just naturally horny.<br />
There were already plenty of couples paired off and ready to get hot and heavy with each other, but a group of unattached males were still hanging around the red haired girl, trying their best to lead her into the woods behind the school.<br />
None of them knew about Alice Decrux or the tainted punch.<br />
No one realized that Melissa Jenkins&#39; apparent cooperation at being escorted outside was because of that.<br />
All any of the boys cared about at that moment was having the red haired girl to themselves.<br />
Soon the teenagers would realize that not only was Mel still a normal human being, but a virgin as well.<br />
This would make the boys a lot more anxious to be her first, even if that also meant she would become the female version of whatever were they were in the process, and they were a mixed bunch.<br />
A dog, a wolf, a lion, a tiger, and a fox were all vying for the girl&#39;s attention. An argument over who would be &quot;the one&quot; would be unavoidable.<br />
Whether or not that turned into a fight, with &quot;the winner getting the honors&quot; remained to be seen.<br />
But what the group didn&#39;t know was that time was working against them.<br />
Besides the fact that Mel&#39;s father and her boyfriend were now aware of what was going on and about to give chase, the tainted punch was NOT at full strength between the melted ice and the leftovers from the second bowl being poured into it.*<br />
Between all that and the cool night air, Mel&#39;s head would eventually start clearing and the erotic fire burning within her would die down just enough for Mel to realize what was going on and decide whether or not to say no.<br />
But would all of this happen in time before Mel joined were society?<br />
Especially considering that the only were birth control pill she had was a prescription for werecow, and Besides the fact that she hadn&#39;t even taken her very first one yet, it required at least an hour for a new prescription to become effective, so Mel might wind up furry AND pregnant this night!<br />
<br />
