<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The milk had been already spilled to the floor. Bobby knew that he had to do something and told his mother that the naked middle-aged girl was his sister.<br />
<br />
As Mark arrives next to Annabelle both took a closer look at the weeping older woman next to Bobby. Mark asked from Annabelle if she had any sisters since the woman reminded him of his wife.<br />
<br />
Bobby kept insisting and defending his aged-up sister. Annabelle knew that Bobby was a boy who wouldn&#39;t approach strangers he didn&#39;t knew. So in the end Mark and Annabelle decided to bring adult Amber to the kitchen and give her something to wear from her mother&#39;s closet.<br />
<br />
It was middle of the night. One hour before midnight. The whole family was sitting the kitchen consulting Amber. Annabelle asked questions that only Amber should know. Amber answered every question somewhat correctly and in a way that she could answer.<br />
<br />
Mark was confused and asked Bobby how did he know that Amber had grown older and in that moment he remembered that Bobby had bought a ring from a magic shop moments prior as the whole family was in the park.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bobby. Could you turn your sister back?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
<br />
Bobby pointed the ring finger to Amber and thought of her being a 9-year-old but nothing happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- I can&#39;t...&quot; Bobby muttered. &quot;The owner said that I need more money to get the &#39;better ring&#39; or something...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark was visibly angry but bottled up all that anger as he knew that if Bobby got too scared something horrible could happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we need to wait for tomorrow and go see this owner and demand them to change Amber back to her previous age.&quot; Annabelle noted. &quot;Mommy will sleep with Amber in the parents bedroom while Mark you can sleep on the sofa for the night?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark quickly turned his head towards Annabelle as if he was about to interject but let out a sigh as he knew that there was really nothing to be done for tonight.<br />
<br />
Bobby asked if he was in trouble and both Mark and Annabelle said that it was the store owners fault for not telling Bobby that how dangerous the ring was. Then they asked if Bobby could just take the ring off for the night so there wouldn&#39;t be more &#39;accidents&#39;.<br />
<br />
Bobby struggled to take it off and even with help of his father. They all concluded that it was firmly stuck in the finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Let&#39;s just sleep for the night and tomorrow morning the whole family goes to this store to see how we turn Amber back and take that cursed ring out of Bobby&#39;s finger. Deal?&quot; Mark asked from the whole family and they all agreed to do so.<br />
<br />
Temporarily Mark was sleeping in the living on top of a sofa. Annabelle and Amber sleeping together in the king sized bed in a Mark&#39;s and Annabelle&#39; bedroom. Lastly Bobby left sleeping by himself in an empty room by himself.<br />
<br />
He knew deep down that he was in trouble even if no-one said anything. Bobby tried to just sleep but couldn&#39;t as his heartbeat was too loud.<br />
<br />
Next morning as the whole family woke up. Bobby felt a hint of nervousness in the air. Amber was wearing her mother&#39;s pyjamas and Mark stared in disbelief that Amber had grown older than him. Occasionally he would give side-eye to Bobby as they both knew that the ring was causing more trouble.<br />
<br />
Gladly Amber acting more like herself and only said how funny it felt to be as tall as mommy and papa. She had difficulties with more adult clothes and as the clock hit the nine in the morning. Mark drove the whole family in front of the magic shop.<br />
<br />
Inside the shop the clerk greeted Bobby and asked if he brought more customers. Mark was furious and almost gave a sucker punch to the clerk before he was stopped by a magical wand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now there sonny my boy. Never had a customer this heated in my life.&quot; The clerk laughed as he hold Mark in place with his wand. &quot;I&#39;m having a hunch that the youngest of the group caused a lot of trouble to you? Sadly I&#39;m sorry to say that there&#39;s no return policy in this store. Once something is bought it can&#39;t be returned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark was released from the magical hold and gasped air as he couldn&#39;t move a muscle, let alone open his mouth. Mark coughed and Annabelle asked from clerk if he could change her daughter back to more appropriate age.<br />
<br />
Clerk, while dusting his robes, told Annabelle that she could buy a  ring that could regress people at mere 100 000 $ price. The clerk explained that the age ring usual came in pairs but that there were mass production on the age accelerating ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is why even from my goodness of the heart just hand you the ring. It holds more magic and can&#39;t be replicated. I&#39;ve even tried it myself.&quot; The clerk explained to the family.<br />
<br />
Annabelle asked that it was too hefty price and begged if they could only borrow it for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t. The ring becomes complete once it&#39;s both halves are struck together and the ring itself is absorbed by the user until they are nothing but a dust of bones themselves. The last wizard Marrdork used it for his nefarious purposes at the year 1100 before accidentally using the magic on themselves.&quot; The clerk continued and light their pipe to show the story in smoke silhouettes.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you are expecting our little boy here just buy the other half of the ring at some point. That&#39;s absurd. Why even sell a ring with such high risk to a boy with no understanding of their actions.&quot; Annabelle contested the Clerk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t sell the ring to mess with mortals. I can see that the boy can handle his mind even under a stress.&quot; The clerk pointed his pipe at Bobby. &quot;Even a wizard such as myself couldn&#39;t do that on a whim. The boy has talent or if he didn&#39;t you&#39;d be piles of bones by now as the magic can be only activated by mind and not by words.&quot;<br />
<br />
The whole family was flabbergasted as nothing he said made sense. Mark grunted and asked if he could buy the ring with credit. The clerk humored Mark and asked if he was willing to make a contract to seal the deal.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s what you wish for then so be it. I just want me baby girl to be-&quot; Mark said and in puff of smokes vanished.<br />
<br />
Whole family gasped but quickly went quiet as they had no memory of Mark and The clerk handed the other part of the ring to Bobby saying that it had been paid.<br />
<br />
Bobby in confused state put the ring back on his finger on top of the other one and as they begun to spin a like CD-disc around his finger the ring didn&#39;t get absorbed inside his finger.<br />
<br />
Instead Bobby felt a sting in his left eye. The clerk prepared his wand as he witness a part of Bobby turning into an imp. The right side of his face had become gray and had a small stubble of a horn. Bobby&#39;s right side canine tooth had grown more wolf-like and he could feel something pushing behind his back and around his tailbone.<br />
<br />
Annabelle and Amber screamed in horror as a reddish pupil and yellowish iris with black sclera was forming like a liquid bloodshot.<br />
<br />
Bobby didn&#39;t feel scared as this escalated but remembered what Merlin had done to his father.<br />
<br />
In that small moment of time Bobby felt that he had to do...</p>
