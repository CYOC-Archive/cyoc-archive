<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Penny found a lot of Dino City to be rather quaint in many ways. Despite being built up in the second largest state by land area, it didn&#39;t really have any &quot;mansions&quot; among the homes and buildings that looked like they were designed by a stone age cartoon. It was impressive in a way, though it wasn&#39;t exactly what she figured would be the case for a wealthy family like her own. Her father had seemed to accept it and that was okay. It provided enough for Penny to let that all that be for now, and in some ways that gave her time to look more into Dino City and how it played into the sort of phenomenon that Animalia had created. A walking tour of Dino City provided plenty of things for Penny to find out about it and see some reasons that could accept about the lack of mansions.<br />
<br />
And there were plenty of things that were fairly interesting about the Dinotopians that resided in Dino City. The population was rather low and for the moment, most of the people residing in Dino City were actually Humans. Those that had a clear Texan accent had been residents and would have been part of the general Glen Rose community before Dino City was built. Most of the rest were the &quot;hippies&quot; that had moved into Dino City and were essentially in line to become Dinotopians. Some weren&#39;t too bad, though Penny also found that they were probably deserving of the roar that her father frightened them with after he became a Dinotopian. Though that sort of thing was something that Penny was well familiar with even before Animalia came around. People always seemed to think that her father had mined &quot;blood diamonds&quot; and that she had piggybacked on the success of that enterprise, but she&#39;d powered on and had success in her own right.<br />
<br />
And the Dinotopians that were there were in many ways enough of a reason to consider it. They were fairly friendly, a bit stricter when it came to things like wearing masks, but Penny let that be. All fit the same basic design that all Animalians had in being both extremely fit and very curvaceous among females and well muscled among males. It wouldn&#39;t surprise her if there were women out there who had their fantasies of getting in bed with any of the male Dinotopians, and her father might ultimately be in the search for someone who might fit in that category. And she was fairly sure that most men wished that every woman wanted to hang around the Dinotopian women where their cup size started at a D and got bigger, though she had the sense that the two Sauropod females, Jen and Marjorie were well bigger than that. That got Penny thinking on what to do, as she was sure there was a way she could tie that into her band, particularly if she were tailor her business for jewelry for Dinotopians and the unique adaptations they had.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Tyrannotitan?&quot; said the male Theropod Dinotopian that Penny met at Dino City&#39;s Horizon office. He looked like a mix of different predatory dinosaurs, mostly T-Rex, but there were some other noted features that stood out, namely two horns above his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, like my dad,&quot; Penny answered, &quot;bring all things together, Mr...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Green, Jeremy Green,&quot; Jeremy answered as he reviewed the paperwork, which was in order, &quot;and just making everything is in order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m clear of Covid, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re checking,&quot; Penny said in a low voice as she watched Jeremy shuffle through the paperwork.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t have gotten past the entry area if you had Covid,&quot; Jeremy commented, &quot;this is more standard procedure and is something quite normal. All the present pandemic has done has slowed a lot of that stuff down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Penny commented, &quot;and you&#39;ve been working on Animalia&#39;s Covid Vaccine...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s been more with Dinotopia Aquatica and the main Horizon Offices in Lyre,&quot; Jeremy said slowly, &quot;they might be setting up a field office in Wisconsin... but far enough down the command structure that I don&#39;t know on how well that&#39;s going. The big &quot;medical&quot; thing that&#39; I&#39;ve been working on has been more to see on how Dinotopians would handle Rabies...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rabies?&quot; Penny wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, all Mammal Animalians get vaccinated against it, just in case they have to deal with a rabid animal, and this includes yearly boosters,&quot; Jeremy answered, &quot;Reptile, bird, and amphibian Animalians haven&#39;t had the need for it or at least not the perceived need and there the Rabies Vaccine is more an option for them than something that is mandatory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I ask you what got you into looking into Rabies?&quot; Penny wondered, &quot;don&#39;t hear many cases of that in America.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From experts I&#39;ve talked to... it&#39;s actually pretty big with many mundane animals in America, though mostly wild animals with pets largely being vaccinated,&quot; Jeremy answered, &quot;from what I&#39;ve found is a bit mixed... Blood tests would indicate that the Rabies Virus doesn&#39;t completely affect Dinotopians... at least not in the way it&#39;s known to with modern Animals and Humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it&#39;d be non-lethal for you?&quot; Penny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually no... it WOULD still be lethal without treatment or vaccination,&quot; Jeremy answered, &quot;and my best guess is because all Dinotopians, with the exception of a few of the smaller ones are all converted Humans. Thus the Rabies Virus would find the part of our genome that has the &quot;Human&quot; part of our genes and goes in from there... but because of the bridge between reptiles and birds that Dinotopians occupy... I think it&#39;d actually take LONGER for the worst symptoms to set in. Thus, vaccination may be needed, but it wouldn&#39;t be quite as necessary as with the normal Mammal Animalians.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny nodded.  She wasn&#39;t expecting a discussion on Rabies and how the disease might effect Dinotopians, but it seemed that while it was a possible threat, it wasn&#39;t as bad as the main pandemic going on. Why Horizon&#39;s top scientist in Dino City had been working on this project was an unknown, but that was his business and with all the other stuff going on, he might have the time. After all with so many things slowed down, it wasn&#39;t like there was a great rush of conversions. The pandemic made a mess of things and the politics around it made it worse, though some things hadn&#39;t been completely shut down. In some of her tours she&#39;d heard something about a wedding to be held on Christmas Day at the ranch that belonged to a relative of Dino City&#39;s mayor. From what she&#39;d heard this wedding wasn&#39;t in Dino City or even close to it, but it was about the best that could be managed given things. Though, since Penny didn&#39;t know Dino City&#39;s mayor, she decided to let that be as Jeremy then motioned for Penny to follow him. She did so and followed him from the waiting room that she&#39;d been lead to and then one of the conversion rooms where a nurse was waiting with what looked like a very large needle there. Here eyes widened a bit at it, which Jeremy noted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, the needle isn&#39;t long,&quot; Jeremy assured her, &quot;what you see is built more to accommodate my hands and allow for you to receive your two doses in one go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy watched as Penny nodded. He accepted the syringe and carried it into the conversion room and ushered Penny into it. She looked at the size of the bed in the room, all of which scaled up to fit Dinotopians, which was likely something she&#39;d be aware of. He&#39;d heard plenty of stories on some of the things that Patrick Diamond and Penny had been up to since Patrick&#39;s conversion into a Tyrannotitan Dinotopian and his daughter&#39;s arrival, and a lot of it had been enough for him to be sure that Penny knew about how things in Dinotopia worked, and why many things were scaled up to fit Dinotopians. She clambered up onto the bed while Jeremy readied and alcohol swab.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will probably need to remove your clothing when I leave,&quot; Jeremy spoke as he wiped the alcohol over Penny&#39;s shoulder, &quot;as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware... Tyrannotitan was not a small animal...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Comparable with T Rex but more closely related Giganotosaurus,&quot; Penny smiled back, &quot;interesting how there were so many large predators in the Cretaceous period and all of comparable size... must make finding mates competitive...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy said nothing to that. His real &quot;search&quot; for a mate was never all that active. His interest in science and drive to help his sister had often kept him distracted from many social functions, and about the only one that ever broke through that was Heather. It had lead to its fair share of ups and downs and the trouble he&#39;d gotten into with Horizon for smuggling Animalia Virus samples out to Heather, which lead to her becoming the first Syntixisaurus Rex Dinotopian. But it also lead to the surprise that Heather had long had some interest in him, and that was why she had so often came back to him, and that discovery lead to their now happy marriage. Though, he supposed others might have more open competition for people&#39;s attention than he&#39;d ever had, but that wasn&#39;t his business. He administered Penny&#39;s shot and then moved to head for the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will be outside the door, and my &quot;nurse&quot; should have clothing that will fit the new you when you&#39;ve finished transforming,&quot; Jeremy spoke, &quot;and welcome to Dinotopia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t stay with me?&quot; Penny inquired flashing a toothy smile and Jeremy watched as those teeth began to lengthen and flatten into the long and blade-like Carnosaur teeth that Tyrannotitan had, and likely wouldn&#39;t be too different in tooth structure from Mr. M and Officer Slash, though they were Carcharodontosaurus Dinotopians.<br />
<br />
&quot;Horizon policy would require you keep your privacy,&quot; Jeremy answered, &quot;and my wife would kill me even if that policy wasn&#39;t there... and I love her very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your loss,&quot; Penny shrugged as her Human hair began to fall out and as Jeremy made his way back out into the hall.<br />
<br />
There he was met up with his aide and nurse again, who took the used needle and moved off to dispose of it.  With the door shut behind him, and only the hum of the lights to be heard for the moment, Jeremy breathed out a sigh of relief. He didn&#39;t expect to be hit on, and was glad that with all the Covid related issues, Heather was doing most of her ad design work from home at the moment. The last thing he wanted was a fight to break out. As it stood, he didn&#39;t Penny would really hold that much interest in him in the long run. The Dinotopians were to follow the same edicts that all Animalians had and he also knew that his marriage to Heather was pretty well known by now. He guessed that Penny was just being playful or was trying to mess with him.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, his &quot;nurse&quot; returned with the standard clothing that would likely fit Penny once her transformation was completed. It was only a short time after that that there was a knock ad the door and a slightly deeper version of Penny&#39;s voice was heard calling through the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m ready for whatever clothes you have!&quot;<br />
<br />
The nurse took it over and opened the door just enough to pass the clothes through. Jeremy thought he heard a &quot;humph&quot; before they were accepted. When the door opened again, Penny emerged and turned her head to look over to Jeremy with one one eye and with her hands on her now generous hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;This a bit common, don&#39;t you think?&quot; Penny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re not bad,&quot; Jeremy answered, &quot;and keep in mind, we keep a pretty generic line of clothing around, as we don&#39;t know the fashion choices of our customers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ll give you a pass on that,&quot; Penny answered, &quot;though I&#39;d also like to talk with your wife at some point... give her some ideas on bling she could enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy only gulped at that. That was not one of the things that he would be looking forward to and didn&#39;t know on how Heather would respond to it.</p>
