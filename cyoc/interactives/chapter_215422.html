<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;But it&#39;s not alright!&quot; Ryan stamped his foot in frustration. &quot;He does this to all my friends!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s not my fault!&quot; Christian tried to defend himself. &quot;Jeff&#39;s too damn hot!&quot; He looked confused over the words that he was saying. Obviously, he wanted to say something else, but it didn&#39;t come out.<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s face flashed the meanest glare he possibly could. Jeff was quick to get between them. &quot;How about we just go to the mall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine...&quot; Ryan grunted. He was already out of his room when he finished letting the word out.<br />
<br />
Christian turned to Jeff. &quot;What the hell! Why can&#39;t I tell him that you changed me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a little override,&quot; Jeff smirked as he waved his phone around. Christian stared in disbelief. His mouth hung open as he looked at the blank screen. &quot;What? Is that so hard to believe compared to the other stuff that happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess not...&quot; Christian muttered.<br />
<br />
Ryan was clearly getting antsy. &quot;ARE WE GOING OR NOT?!&quot; he shouted from the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re coming!&quot; Jeff called back as he pulled up his shorts and struggled a bit to get the sleeveless shirt over his head. He practically jumped down the stairs and landed in front of Ryan. &quot;Ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan took a second to really take it all in. &quot;Y-yeah,&quot; he swallowed hard at the massive beast in front of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m coming too,&quot; Christian called out as he struggled with his own clothes. With how broad his shoulders and how thick his arms were it was pretty hard to get a shirt over top his torso. He had to wiggle to get the covering to lower down on top of him. He had to rest on the couch as he struggled to get his shoes on, but when he did, he popped back up. &quot;Ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine...&quot; Ryan sighed as he headed to Christian&#39;s truck. &quot;You&#39;re driving.&quot;<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
Ryan found it hard to believe just how much he and Jeff had in common. Somehow it was like they had been friends for the last decade. Jeff seemed to know all about the most popular manga and even some more obscure titles that Ryan felt like he was the only one reading. Same with comic books too. He&#39;d been a bit cautious at the beginning of the conversation but didn&#39;t realize how comfortable and easy it was to talk to Jeff.<br />
<br />
Of course, Christian gave the general vibe he thought Jeff would have; aloof, grumpy or just completely disinterested in the topic all together. If Christian wasn&#39;t driving, he clearly would have left on his own. But Ryan wasn&#39;t interested in Christian. That&#39;s why they started off in the secondhand bookstore. It was a bit of a larger franchise and they would buy used books for money and then resell it for a bit more than they bought it for. <br />
<br />
As they walked in Christian left Jeff and Ryan to find his own form of entertainment. It started out by looking for the fitness section, though quickly changed when he saw a guy down one of the aisles. A compulsion led him to walk down the aisle. &quot;Sup,&quot; he cocked his head back as he got the other guy&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sup,&quot; the guy echoed. He clearly wasn&#39;t used to talking to guys like Christian. The 6&#39;4&quot; muscular beast covered in hair was almost the complete opposite of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatcha looking for?&quot; Christian continued the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... J-j-just some comics,&quot; the guy responded. He didn&#39;t expect it to continue at all. His eyes went back to the shelves. However, the strong natural scent wafting from Christian kept drawing his eyes back to the massive man standing over him. Even though he would have normally found such a smell off putting, this one felt so alluring. The potent musk was somehow almost smelling better with each breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything good?&quot; Christian paused, awkwardly as though to ask for his name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric,&quot; Eric responded. &quot;And no. I&#39;ve either already read it or it looks like shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww man, that fucking sucks,&quot; Christian said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man. Takes too long for this shit to get published. And then half of its crap,&quot; Eric stood up. He was expecting there to be a good 8 inches in height between him and Christian but found it to be closer to 4. He then reached to the sky, feeling a deep stretch all the way down to the bone. For a second he wondered why it was 4 when they were near eye to eye. Eric naturally reached for his glasses to adjust them but didn&#39;t find anything there. For a brief moment confusion overtook him. However, his hand continued upward and adjusted his ball cap, twisting it around. A tuft of his dark brown hair popped out.<br />
<br />
Christian laughed at the statement. &quot;Never could get into it. It all looked like crap to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not,&quot; Eric defended his hobby. &quot;You just gotta know where to look.&quot; He rolled his shoulders back for a second. It was a natural response at first, but then he realized it was more because of his shirt. The graphic tee he was wearing felt so tight. Then something about his sleeves. He flexed his arm a few times feeling his bicep bulge. With each flex, it felt gripped tightly by fabric. It constricted around his arm. <br />
<br />
Then he flexed again. Nothing. Eric shook his head, fully remembering that he was wearing a sleeveless shirt. The superhero logo on his shirt stretched against his expansive chest. The thick pecs underneath it, pulled the shirt taught against his chest and loose around his thin waist. Perfectly cut abs ran down the rest of his torso giving him a rather thin waist. Though his thick perky ass and massive quads clearly made it hard to buy anything other than flexible shorts as the hip to waist ratio was way off. Massive legs held his heavily muscled body up while even larger feet were underneath that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? And where would that be?&quot; Christian moved in closer to the other man. His natural musk filling Eric&#39;s nose. One of Christian&#39;s hands found their way to onto Eric&#39;s hard dick and gently rubbed it.<br />
<br />
Eric growled a bit in frustration. He knew he was turned on, just always forgot how obvious it could be. A massive log ran down his left leg imprinting against his flexible shorts. &quot;I think I know a place we can start,&quot; he said. Then adjusted his shorts so it wouldn&#39;t be as obvious as it had been. <br />
<br />
The smile on Christian&#39;s face only grew as Eric led him to a private corner in the bookstore. With so many shelves, kiosks, toys and tables in the large store, it was a very private part of the store. He pushed Christian against the shelves. His strong hands held Christian&#39;s hands behind his back as he kissed the nape of his neck. &quot;God damn...&quot; Eric cursed as he moaned. &quot;I know a lot of guys called me gay in high school but none of them turned me on. How the fuck are you so hot?&quot; he continued pressing his body up against Christian&#39;s taking in the strong smell of the other man. With each breath, Eric fell deeper into bliss over the situation. His movements turned more erratic as he gave into the desire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just how I am...&quot; Christian said.<br />
<br />
He barely even registered that Eric had pulled down his shorts, just enough to expose his hairy muscular ass. Then he felt that powerful rod he&#39;d only seen an outline of press against his asshole. As more pressure was applied his hole opened up. A sudden whimper exited Christian&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut the fuck up,&quot; Eric hissed. Christian nodded and more of Eric&#39;s dick pushed inside. &quot;Good boy,&quot; Eric could tell how hard it was for Christian to hold back any noises. The other man&#39;s breathing had grown a bit haggard as his strong hands gripped the bookshelves with all their might. Each thrust almost made Christian shout out in pleasure, but because of Eric&#39;s command he dutifully listened. With each thrust he felt himself coming closer and closer. <br />
<br />
Christian&#39;s body sudden thrust as his hands clamped down on the wooden shelves even harder. However, the lightest sound of a gasp escaped him as he felt his jock fill with cum. The sudden jump and thrust back onto Eric&#39;s cock sent him into a tizzy. His controlled thrusts turned more sporadic as he tried to finish up. Each thrust drew himself one step closer and then the pure bliss happened.<br />
<br />
He flexed a few times to speed up the blood flow away from his cock and then pulled up his shorts. Before he knew it Christian was in his phone putting in his phone number. &quot;If you&#39;re looking for something besides comic books,&quot; he added slyly as he put Eric&#39;s phone back into Eric&#39;s pocket.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s basically what always happens,&quot; Ryan explained as he and Jeff wandered around the bookstore. &quot;I invite a friend over and then Christian has sex with them. It&#39;s like they&#39;re still the same person but not. It&#39;s weird...&quot; He put his head in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weirder than a giant tiger man?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess not,&quot; Ryan somewhat smiled. &quot;I just don&#39;t get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.... You don&#39;t have to worry about me wanting to work out all the time. I already do that,&quot; Jeff bragged. He tossed up bicep showing off his massive arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Ryan smiled. &quot;Though, I don&#39;t know if we have all that much in common either...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff glared. &quot;Not with that piss poor attitude.&quot; He looked around and saw a hat stand near one of the exits to the store. On it were several different animal ears attached to the hat. Jeff grabbed...</p>
