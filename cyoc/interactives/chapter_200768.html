<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Calm down. Calm down,&quot; Troy tried to console the woman on the other side of the counter. He hadn&#39;t quite thought that she would be this distressed by something like this. But at the same time, it kind of made sense. Bethany no longer had human ears. Troy wondered if she&#39;d noticed the eyes yet though. The bright yellow with a black slit down the middle weren&#39;t exactly not noticeable.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on in here?!&quot; A male officer shouted as he entered into the coffee shop. A female cop was right behind him, hand on her gun. <br />
<br />
Troy naturally threw his hands up into the air. &quot;I was just getting a coffee and her ears started turning into cat ears.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two officers paused, calming down a bit. &quot;What?&quot; they asked in unison. Slowly Bethany started to show herself a bit more. Tears rolled down her face messing up what makeup she was wearing. The officer&#39;s mouths hung slightly agape. &quot;That&#39;s not a costume?&quot; the male one asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no,&quot; Bethany cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright...&quot; the male officer lowered his guard. &quot;You,&quot; pointed at Troy, &quot;over here. Let the girls talk a bit and you can explain what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Troy said as he followed the officer over to one of the tables on the side. The officer had a strong commanding presence. His shoulders were wide and his uniform fit tightly around his biceps. Same with the black pants as Troy couldn&#39;t help but notice the firm butt as he walked closely behind. &quot;Rosco, sit,&quot; Troy said as sit down. Rosco did as he was told and Troy gave him the puppicino. The dog&#39;s eyes went wide as he licked vivaciously at the whipped cream.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got a good dog there,&quot; the officer said. He went to go pet Rosco but paused. &quot;May I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. He&#39;s a real good dog. Half the time I forget he&#39;s not human,&quot; Troy said, making sure to point at Bethany. He wasn&#39;t trying to be mean, but he needed to test the book out as much as possible. If this meant another opportunity, he had to take it. <br />
<br />
As he spoke the word, Bethany began squirming. She rubbed at the bottom of her spine, but was surprised to see that it was growing longer. &quot;Oh God! It&#39;s happening again!&quot; she wailed as a long black and white tail erupted from behind her. Her khaki pants fought for room as tail grew longer and down one of her pant legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Christ!&quot; the male officer exclaimed. &quot;What the fuck&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy did his best to match the energy. &quot;No idea man! It&#39;s like she&#39;s half a fucking cat!&quot; This time he made sure to point at the female officer. The officer leaned in to console Bethany, but didn&#39;t realize as her own ears were starting to move to the top of her head. They grew longer and longer as grey and white fur sprouted on them. It wasn&#39;t until one of the bunny ears flopped fully forward that the officer realized what was going on. She let out a scream as well, holding Bethany even tighter. However, she let out a painful gasp as a cotton tail pushed out of her backside. <br />
<br />
The male officer jumped up out of his seat. &quot;What the hell&#39;s going on!?&quot; he shouted. The two woman straightened up at his strong commanding presence. &quot;Is it spreading?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what is it?&quot; Troy asked, despite knowing full well it was him. &quot;And then why is your partner a rabbit while she&#39;s a cat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; the male officer shouts. He seems to be getting a bit more desperate as watched his partner and Bethany freak out even more. <br />
<br />
Troy takes advantage of the chaos, telling Rosco to go check on the girls. The dog happily obliges, wagging his tail as he walks over to them. The male officer grabs him by the collar, but Rosco continues to pull. It was just enough of a distraction for Troy to as quickly as he possibly could, say, &quot;Half.&quot; His finger pointed at the male officer, thinking about a tiger.<br />
<br />
&quot;He-hey!&quot; the officer shouts. &quot;Get your dog under control!&quot; His voice had already deepened an octave. Even as he looked over his shoulder, Troy could see massive fangs filling his mouth instead of human teeth. Each one was far larger than they had been before, rapidly filling the limited space in his mouth. But his mouth started to push out more into a maw. The already strong masculine jawline only grew bigger and wider. His nose pushed forward, creating a snout. He wiggled it a bit trying to get it to feel more comfortable as whiskers grew from the sides.<br />
<br />
Orange and black fur erupted around his face, rapidly changing from his blondish hair color. As the fur ran down his neck, his muscles started to grow. The width of his neck nearly doubled and his shoulders broadened significantly. Every part of him seemed to just be getting bigger. The orange and black fur kept going down his arms, strengthening his already strong biceps to the nth degree. Even without flexing the uniform he was wearing was wearing stretched tightly against his arms.<br />
<br />
Troy didn&#39;t know whether or not he should be upset by the development. On the one hand, he liked seeing the police uniform barely hold the massive man&#39;s body, on the other, he would have liked to see the strong powerful muscles underneath as well. Every second seemed to add another 10 pounds of muscle and size. His body rapidly grew taller. But most surprising was his tail bone growing out his backside. A hole seemed to be cut specifically for it. Not that Troy was looking too hard at it as the male officer&#39;s muscular ass was easily just as interesting. It had be fairly prominent before, yet now, Troy could almost feel like he could see the hard definition in each of those muscles.<br />
<br />
It was obvious the man knew how to do squats and refused to skip leg day as his pants tightened against them. His boots grew at least a few sizes larger to fit his massive feet. They had to be large to hold up his towering frame, but Troy couldn&#39;t help but notice the claw marks that were on them as well. The hard leather clearly took a beating as his nails dug into them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Enough!&quot; he finally roared. The added depth of his voice along with his massive size seemed to give him an even more commanding presence. Even Troy felt as though he needed to straighten up as he heard the man&#39;s powerful voice. &quot;Listen. It&#39;s okay. We&#39;ll figure this out. Alright?&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
Troy felt himself chuckle as he watched the towering tiger man console the two women who&#39;d only changed a little. They seemed to have calmed down a bit more as they were being scolded by the male officer, but still didn&#39;t seem to like it. It didn&#39;t matter that he&#39;d gone under a massive transformation that completely changed him, they looked at him as though he was always had massive black claws jutting out of his finger tips. Or his bright orange and black fur running across his muscular body was completely normal. Or the tail that slowly waved behind him wasn&#39;t out of the ordinary. Or that he stood a good foot and a half taller than the average man was not something to gawk at. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, we&#39;re going to try to calm down and figure this out,&quot; the male officer said. The two women nodded.<br />
<br />
Troy called over Rosco and whispered in his ear, &quot;Shape. Shape.&quot; and pointed at the two women. Instantly their animal features disappeared and they no longer there. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the--?!&quot; The male officer brought one of his hands to his forehead. &quot;You changed back!?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two women looked at each other and quickly brought in a hug. &quot;We changed back! We changed back!&quot; they chanted. The male officer continued to look on in confusion as Troy quietly made his way to the exit.</p>
