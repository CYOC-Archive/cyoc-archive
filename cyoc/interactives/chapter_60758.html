<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Alice spent a few minutes admiring herself in the bathroom mirror. Despite having goat legs and a protruding tummy--or perhaps because of them--she felt uniquely sexy. Her slightly goatish eyes had a wild gleam in them, and with the partly-formed muzzle on her face, her lips were constantly curled up into a tiny smile.
<P>Excited to see what else she could try on the program, she returned to the computer. At the top of the screen were a few tabs. The active tab was labeled "Physical," but there were also tabs that said "Mental" and "Awareness."
<P>"Ah, I should set the awareness parameters before anyone comes home. Otherwise I'll have a lot of explaining to do." Alice clicked on the tab and saw among the options a box that made her the only one aware of her previous existence as a human. Hopefully, the rest of the world would treat her as if she'd always been a satyr.
<P>The she clicked on the "Mental" tab that took her to a new menu full of mental traits. Her current attitudes, likes and dislikes were on display.
<P>She thought for a minute about leaving them alone. "Well, I can always change some of these back if having my brain altered freaks me out. I just have to make sure not to go overboard with new preferences."
<P>She looked over her mental settings. Her love of the outdoors was already rather high, and appropriate for a satyr. She saw a slider for music appreciation and musical talent. She brought those up a bit and in a box labeled "Instruments Played" she typed "Flute, Recorder, Panpipes." Instantly three new sliders appeared, setting her proficiencies in those instruments. Alice kicked all three sliders up to the highest setting.
<P>She tweaked the settings under food preferences to make herself like more vegetables. She didn't care much for a lot of veggies currently. "New body, new rules. Satyrs live off forest scraps, and though I don't plan to do that myself, having a larger veggie palette ought to do me some good." She also thought that satyrs would be more indulgent, and so she increased her appetite a little and sped up her metabolism slightly to compensate.
<P>She looked over page after page of sliders, adjusting some here and there that seemed to help with her satyr role play. She increased her sense of humor and playfulness, and decreased her tendency to become sad or nervous. She noticed her introvert/extrovert slider was middling between the two extremes, and decided to move it halfway toward extrovert. She found a slider controlling her attention span and reduced this a bit. "Satyrs are flighty creatures sometimes," she giggled.
<P>Also remembering that satyrs were debaucherous creatures, she looked over the menu regarding her sexual habits and preferences. She snickered at seeing a slider marked "Normal Arousal State," thinking it would be better labeled "Horniness Factor." Hers was low, unsurprisingly, at 8%. She decided to bring this up to 20%. "Wonder if I'll get a kick out of that," she said. "Or if it'll be too much for me to cope with." She really had no idea what kind of grade this slider was based on. Did 100% mean just always thinking about sex, or did it mean being so obsessed with it she had to be constantly screwing something in order to stay sane? Either way, she was confident any higher than 20% was more than she wanted at this point.
<P>For fun, she checked out the other settings for sexuality. She decided to give herself leather, hair and glove fetishes, and increased the sensitivity of her lips, inner thighs and ears. She noticed that her vagina and breasts' sensitivity already increased slightly when she adjusted her horniness.
<P>This made her think of what to do about clothes. "I can't exactly wear anything on my legs without the fur itching like crazy," she said. "And satyrs don't seem to wear a lot of clothes anyway. Maybe I can...?" Alice searched through the program until she found a preference for clothing and clothing types.
<P>"Okay," she said, playing with the sliders. "As far as a general interest in clothing, I should go way down." She moved the main clothes slider from its original position, close to "strongly like," over toward "strongly dislike," though she made sure not to go all the way, lest she develop such a mad-on for clothes that she started to burn her entire wardrobe or something. "And as long as I HAVE to wear some kind of clothing, I'd like to make it fancy and exotic." She increased her attitudes for silk, linen, and other delicate clothes, as well as her interest in jewelry.
<P>"Hmm...that's all I can think of for now," she said to herself. "I covered a lot of ground already. Time to see if this works." Alice clicked save once, and felt her head spin for a moment as new thoughts and ideas swept in, pushing some of her other thoughts to the back of her mind.
<P>"Woah," she said breathlessly. She shook her head to clear it up. Her hair tossed around, tickling her newly sensitive ears and Alice felt a rush of heat from her crotch. "Oooh, that was cool," she said. "Must be the horniness and...sensitivity kicking in..." She reached through the thick fur around her crotch to rub a finger against her slit. It felt better than ever before. Although it was more highly stimulated, she noticed it was still keeping itself dry. "Gooood," she moaned. "I'm not super-horny. Just...really interested." She pulled her hand away and tried to focus on the program once again.
<P>She felt much more ambitious about her changes than before. The prospect of going through her day as a satyr brought a squeal of joy to her lips. "Oh, I can't wait to go out and do something. But I have to make sure I'm really ready." Alice skipped to the bathroom again to take another look at herself, in case there were any more changes she wanted to do.
<P>Upon seeing herself in the mirror, she felt something was different about the way she looked, although she knew she hadn't changed physically. "Why did I not notice how hot my hair looks like this?" She ran a finger through her dense brown curls. An urge welled up in her to play with it a little. "I know, I think I saw a picture somewhere..."
<P>Alice jogged back to her room, feeling her small gut sway back and forth and her hair blow up in a large bush behind her. She pulled a book of classical art from her bookshelf and flipped through the pages to find one of her favorite paintings of a satyr. She found it quickly. It was a picture of a female satyr, naked of course, offering an apple to two cherubs in a beautiful forest setting. The satyr was plump, a little thicker in the limbs than Alice, but she had the same long brown curls. In the midst of these was a braid that began halfway down, consisting of half her total locks and laying upon the strands that still hung loose. It lent an ironic sense of style to the exotic disarray of hair.
<P>Alice plopped down on her bed and began working on the braid. Because she only had to start from the halfway point, it was easy to pull the locks around to her front side and start braiding. She was so gleefully focused on her work that she didn't notice the time go by, until...</p>
