<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The door flew off its hinges as the now transformed Alex lunged and tackled Matt, licking his face and upper chest as he did so. “Ahh man you never told me you got another dog Bryan. Were you really going to leave this guy out there begging, not cool man?” Matt started to pet the transformed Alex, even as Bryan started to huddle into his closet door.<br />
<br />
Bryan watched in mixed emotions as his now doggy brother licked and rubbed himself against his best friend Matt. Now Matt was a big dude, easily six feet three inches, with a thick muscled chest that came from years of weight lifting. So to see him so carelessly petting Alex and not being adversely affected brought him some measure of relief. <br />
<br />
“I guess I was over reacting, maybe something that I ate.” Bryan said as he chuckled nervously watching his brother and friend play, even in this strange transformed state. He watched as Matt started furiously scratching the bottom of Alex’s’ rear and in turn how Alex lifted his tail high in the air, then he flipped over and presented his stomach. Along with his long erect red dog knotted penis.<br />
<br />
Matt moved his hands over the stomach but was careful not to touch the dripping penis, “Man I guess you guys haven’t had the chance to fix this little guy, because he certainly seems excited.” Matt said to Bryan as he continued petting, while Bryan just chuckled nervously again.<br />
<br />
Bryan turned away and walked to his on-suite bathroom turning to say, “Hey I need to use the bathroom, I’ll be right back.”, and then closing the door and locking himself in. He faced himself in the mirror, an eighteen-year-old looked back. Roguishly handsome as his now canine mother once said, his short cropped brown hair went well with his mocha brown eyes, not to mention his square jaw line. “God what is wrong with me, my family is a bunch of dogs and here I am making small talk with Matt.” He rubbed some water over his face before adopting a seriously expression,” I need to get Matt out of here before whatever happened to the rest of my family spreads to us as well.” He whispered to himself before toweling off his face and moving to open the door back into his room.<br />
<br />
Which was now empty….<br />
<br />
Looking around frantically Bryan tried to find his large muscled friend, but could not find him anywhere in his room. So with much reservation he looked out into the hallway, keeping one hand on the door in case he needed to slam the door shut for some reason. He was meet with the wagging tail of his youngest brother disappearing behind the side hallway that led towards Alex’s room. Grabbing a wooden bat that he kept as a memento of his baseball years Bryan walked slowly down the hallway, seeing the now drying puddle of cum that came from his brother as he did so.  Walking one foot in front of the other Bryan made his way towards his brothers’ room, which now had the door shut. Slowly grabbing the handle, he turned and opened the door slowly, all the while keeping one hand on the bat.<br />
<br />
Matt was on the ground, he had his arms and legs spread, and Bryan could hear some panting. He moved forward, eyes scanning the room as he did so, and approached Bryan. Moving towards his body Bryan started to allow himself to relax seeing neither his brother or his transformed parents in sight. He grabbed on to Matts shoulder and gave him a light pull to help him up, only for his friends’ body to not budge at all.<br />
<br />
“Hey Matt are you alright?” He asked as he tried once again to turn his friends hunched form to face him, but was only meant with more panting.<br />
<br />
Feeling a little apprehensive of the situation Bryan slowly walked in front of Matt and stood at his head, who had his head bent down and was acquiring a slow pool of drool beneath it. Crouching down to be at his level Bryan slowly moves closer to Matt when suddenly Matt lunges at Bryan, his large muscled form too much for Bryan to handle Matt pins him to the ground their faces inches from each other. Matt looks normal aside from his eyes which are glazed, but as he stares into Bryans face Bryan sees they start to fill with lust. Matt moves closer and captures Bryans mouth in his, moving his tongue around deep into Bryans mouth, who tries to fight but is unable to move against Matt. Their tongues interlock and even though Bryan is disgusted he can’t fight the erection that is starting to press against his shorts.<br />
<br />
Apparently Matt felt the same as he stopped for a moment before straddling Bryan, squeezing his muscle legs together holding Bryan down. He brought his chest up breaking their mouths apart, Bryan took the moment to take a deep breath and watched as Matt stripped. He took of his top first revealing his taunt muscled chest that was covered in a light sheen of sweat, for some reason however instead being disgusted it made Bryan even harder. Bryan was embarrassed as his boner poked through his shorts in the pelvic of Matt, but he didn’t seem to even notice. After taking off his shirt Matt rejoined their mouths, this time with a loud moan as their tongues interlocked. Bryan didn’t even notice that he didn’t fight back as much this second time as he did the first, he was starting to enjoy it. With Matts naked chest pressed up against him, Bryan was at a state of arousal he didn’t think was possible. <br />
<br />
A large poking sensation pressed against his own erection and Bryan let out a silent moan as his body shuddered, moving his eyes downwards he saw Matts own boner rubbing up against his through their shorts. This turned both Bryan and Matt on more than they had been before, and without que both slowly started dry humping their waists together. Matt once again broke off and stood up, Bryan didn’t even think of running. His chest was now covered in sweat which only made his muscles stand out even more, his pecs were like steel and his abs iron. He moved his hands down and slowly removed both his shorts and underwear, revealing in its eight inch glory his long dick and hairy balls. Bryan tried to fight some feeling welling in his chest but failed and started drooling at the sight of Matts equipment.<br />
<br />
Matt moved over Bryan but instead of restarting their mouth locking he instead started to pull at Bryans own shirt, Bryan didn’t even resist as Matt pulled it off revealing his own lean and toned body. Matt started licking in between Bryans pecs, dragging his tongue in deep long strokes. He moved all over the chest, tasting Bryan, enticing him, playing with his nipples. Bryan couldn’t stand it any longer and moved his own mouth up to do the same to Matt, the irresistible urge to lick and mark Matt overriding any other thought as he dragged his own tongue over Matts nipples. <br />
<br />
They continued this for a while before Matt slowly started taking his licks closer and closer to Bryans groin, who started to thrust forward with each lick that got closer and closer to him. Once he reached the top of Bryans shorts and moved his hands from their place on Bryans hips and slowly inches down the shorts, until all that was left was Bryans tight white underwear that was stretched with his raging erection and had a damp spot from leaking pre. With a smile Matt removed this too until Bryan was as naked as he, then he took Bryans dick into his mouth and started sucking. Bryan went light headed the sensory overload being too much, the pleasure from Matt was too great and he felt the first signs of something. Bryan felt his balls swell up and fought the sudden urge to cum, but couldn’t hold back. With a loud moan Bryan came right into Matts mouth, who didn’t even stop sucking as he swallowed all the cum down. Bryan felt Matt still sucking and became hard again, not wanting to leave Matt out he followed suit.<br />
<br />
Soon both had their heads by the others dick and balls, and was lathering their partner’s privates in slobber and saliva. Then…</p>
