<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex shut his eyes, and waited. He expected to feel something. But nothing came. Tentatively he opened his eyes. The strange man known as Luke was gone. He didn’t have to look down to know he still had his udder, he could feel it pushing against his legs still. He kicked off the remains of his pants and underwear and sighed. How was he going to live? He felt his eyes water as tears began to form. He took a step forward, his new udder followed suit, bashing hard against his leg. <br />
<br />
	He sat down on a kitchen chair. He had to adjust himself several times. His heavy udder kept bumping into the chair and pushing it back. The boy sobbed for what seemed like hours. How was he going to live like this? He couldn’t sit for long though, he felt a familiar tingle in his legs. They were falling asleep. The heavy udder was preventing blood flow to his legs. Alex sighed as he got up, his cheeks still caked in tears. He grabbed some ice cream from the fridge and a spoon, not noticing the ice-cream label had changed. He waddled back to the living room. <br />
<br />
	Each step almost threw him off balance. He had to be deliberate and quick with his feet. A single leg couldn’t support his new massive accessory. Each step was more like a stumble, and each stumble caused his udder to swing like a wrecking ball, threating to throw him off course. By the time he reached his couch he was exhausted. The simple act of moving was now more like a workout. Out of breath, he collapsed on the couch. Spreading his legs wide he was able to prevent his new heavy accomplice from suffocating his legs. Eyes still watering, breath still heavy, and legs still weak he dug into his ice cream with reckless abandon. He turned on the television to distract himself from his new permanent predicament. <br />
<br />
	What he saw made his jaw drop. On the TV all the men had udders. They were much smaller than his own, but the basketball sized lumps of pink flesh hanging over their pants was unmistakable. He even switched the channels, but it was the same. All the men now had udders, the women were unchanged. That man must have altered reality somehow. It was then that his words echoed in his mind. “Make me normal again.”  He had done exactly that, it was now normal for men to have udders. He looked down at his own milk bag. He jostled his legs, making the heavy sack sway. <br />
<br />
	When he went to get another spoonful of ice-cream he almost dropped the whole thing when he saw the logo. In his shock he dropped his spoon, the frozen desert landing on his exposed udder flesh. He jolted at the ice cold sensation, quickly brushing the spilled ice-cream off his heavy addition. He 	studied the carton more closely. The old cow label was gone, instead now had a picture of a happy farmer with a large udder. He read the label.<br />
<br />
	“Old style ice-cream made from the finest fresh dairy milk given fresh from men across the United States.”<br />
<br />
	He quickly pulled up his phone and went on his social media. All his male friends had the same pink flesh bags between their legs. No one seemed to cover it. What really confused Alex was that all his past pictures had been changed. He now always had the udder, and it had always been bigger than that of his peers. He even had some pictures he had no memory of. He held a certificate at a local county fair “Best milker, Junior division.”   Apparently his udder was a big deal now. He went on the internet and searched up how else the world had changed.<br />
<br />
	The was still mostly the same. The only exception is that human milk is far more common than it used to be. In fact, a man could make a living off of his milk if he made enough. In addition, a man’s udder seemed to be very attractive to women in this new reality. Many online websites about increasing the size of one’s udder kept popping up for Alex. It seemed the bigger the better. This made Alex happy, looking down at his own ginormous weight. He looked down and rubbed his new addition. It sent shivers up his spine. His new pink flesh was obviously very sensitive. He might actually enjoy this he thought to himself. Continuing to browse the internet while absentmindedly rubbing his udder.</p>
