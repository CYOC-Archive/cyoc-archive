<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mika was quiet as Mary Elise now pulled into her driveway. Mika had never been to her house before and was now surprised by what she saw. The colonial home appeared to be well taken care of with a nondescript lawn. As she exited the car she now gazed at the home intently. “So this is where you live,” she asked.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise simply nodded as the two teens now approached the front door. “Not what I was expecting,” Mika said quietly. Mary Elise turned, glowering at the Japanese teen. “What’s that supposed to mean,” she spat.<br />
<br />
“No nothing,” Mika said quickly. “It’s just, I don’t know, was thinking it would be spookier or something.” Mary Elise sighed as she now opened the door. “Ugh I swear,” she grumbled. “What is it with everyone? Your sister and Lisa seemed to have everyone believing I live in a haunted house or something.”<br />
<br />
“You kind of did that yourself,” Mika retorted. “That whole mistress of the night vibe makes people presume the worst.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise said nothing, frowning as she opened the door. As the two stepped into the foyer they were greeted by an auburn haired woman. “Mary your home,” Mrs. McKinnon said. Turning her eyes widened as she saw Mika. “And you brought a friend?!”<br />
<br />
“I bring Karen over all the time mom,” Mary Elise groaned. <br />
<br />
Mrs. McKinnon blushed, apologizing as she now gazed at Mika. “Sorry,” she said quietly. “It’s just, we don’t have company over too often. Well, Mary doesn’t. It’s just, well, it’s nice to meet another friend of Mary’s.”<br />
<br />
Mrs. McKinnon smiled as she now extended a hand towards Mika. “Nice to meet you,” Mika said warmly. “I’m Mika.”<br />
<br />
“Mom,” Mary Elise groaned. “Mika and I have some homework we have to take care of so we’ll be in my room.” Turning towards Mika she now sighed heavily. “This might take awhile you want  to stay for dinner?”<br />
<br />
Mika nodded, much to Mrs. McKinnons surprise. Without another word Mary Elise and Mika now quickly made their way upstairs. As they entered Mary’s room the auburn haired teen quickly closed the door, locking it before sighing heavily. “Ugh my mom is such a pain,” she groaned. “She seemed alright to me,” Mika answered as she gazed around the room. As she did a small smirk spread across her face. Mary’s room was pretty much what she expected. Dark colors, gothic pictures, and what appeared to be an old Victorian dresser adorned the teens room. Mary Elise frowned as she noticed the smirk on Mika’s face. “What now,” she groaned.<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” Mika smiled. “But this is pretty much what I expected. It’s cool by the way so don’t get all bitchy.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks I think,” Mary Elise mumbled as she now looked at Mika. “Okay so since you and me are practicing I should talk with you about how magic works.” Mika nodded as Mary Elise now began to explain how to cast a spell. As she listened she was impressed how the sullen teen seemed so confident in her teachings. If Mika didn’t know any better she could swear that the girl was a teacher. “So it’s all about concentration then,” Mika said to which Mary Elise nodded. “Yeah,” she said. “When you cast the spell it’s all about focus and picturing what you want to the magic to do in your mind. Just when you cast the spell try not to do anything weird. Already worried enough about what Claudia and your sister might do.”<br />
<br />
“Why do you do that,” Mika frowned. “Why do you keep taking swipes at my girlfriend and my twin?”<br />
<br />
“Well I’ve never gotten along with Kumi for one,” Mary grumbled. “And Claudia has been freaking me out with the whole anthro tigress thing. Not to mention the whole hermaphrodite thing.”<br />
<br />
“Not for nothing you did the same thing,” Mika grumbled. “We all know you changed into an anthro owl so just stop. Claudia is my girlfriend and Kumi is my sister. If you weren’t so nasty then maybe you could actually get along with the rest of the girls.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise said nothing as Mika sighed heavily. The girl was right, Mary Elise was being nasty. Yes she had bad history with Kumi and Lisa but things we’re slowly getting better. As she thought about it she realized it was probably jealousy. Their had only been a few of them that knew magic not too long ago. That had made her feel special. Now the rest of the group was receiving magical training, including two girls who Mary Elise saw as rivals. Rubbing her eyes she realized how unreasonable she was being.<br />
<br />
“Hey cute stuffed cat.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elsie’s eyes flew open as Mika picked a small stuffed cat off of her bed. Catching a breath she now lept towards Mika, snatching the stuffed animal away from Mika. “Don’t touch that,” she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Mika said nothing as Mary Elise clutched the small toy to her chest. “Sorry,” Mary Elise blushed. “I..I shouldn’t of freaked out about that. It’s just, my dad gave this to me, it was the last thing he ever gave to me actually.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Mika said quietly. “I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“Not your fault,” Mary sighed. “And I’m sorry, your right. I have been acting nasty. I guess, I’m just a little jealous. I liked it when I was one of the few that knew magic. Now that everyone else has magic too, I kind of feel like I’m just, well not special.”<br />
<br />
Mika said nothing as Mary Elise clutched the small cat to her chest. “My dad said he would get me a real cat someday and that this would have to do until he could find one. He just never got around to it.” Mary Elise went quiet, wiping her eyes as she now placed the worn looking cat toy back on her bed. “Anyway Mika,” she said sadly. “Whatever you going to transform me into you should do it now. Just remember that you need to picture it in your mind and let the magic flow though you.”<br />
<br />
“Does it always have to be a person,” Mika asked. “Have you ever tried changing an object?” Mary Elise shook her head. Mika rubbed her chin a small smile spreading across her face as she now began to focus her magic. <br />
<br />
Mary Elise braced herself as she awaited the inevitable transformation. After a few moments she frowned as she looked at Mika. “Are you concentrating,” she asked. “Yeah I am,” Mika responded. “Now quiet down for a sec will ya. This is harder than Inthought it would be.” Mary Elise still had no idea what Mika was doing, gazing around the room her eyes grew wide as she gazed at her small stuffed cat.<br />
<br />
The small stuffed animal was glowing, growing slightly larger as Mika worked her magic. At first horrified that Mika would try her magic on the last thing her father gave her she paused as she looked closer. The stuffed animals fur appeared to be filling in as the bald patches she had rubbed bare began to fill in. Soon enough the stuffed animal looked exactly as it had the day her father had given it to her.<br />
<br />
The changes were not finished though as Mary Elise watched intently. Slowly the stuffed animal seems to become, more solid. It was almost like the animal was gazing a skeleton and muscles as it continued to change. Slowly approaching she watched as the cats dull plastic eyes began to change. The eyes of the animal began to look less like plastic and more life like. Unable to speak she continued watching as a small crack began to spread along the toys fAce. In seconds Mary Elise watched as a full and functioning mouth formed on her once lifeless doll. <br />
<br />
“Mika What are you doing,” Mary Elise whispered as she watched the toy blink.<br />
<br />
“I would think it would be pretty obvious,” she said. “Now let me finish this up okay.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise said nothing, watching in fascination as the toys tail began to twitch. Whiskers slowly began to grow from toys face as it’s muzzle pushed out slightly. The hard plastic nose began to lighten and become flesh. As the spell completed Mary Elise’s toy blinked before letting out a meow and rubbing against the teens outstretched hand, purring loudly.<br />
<br />
“Wow,” Mika said happily. “I guess I can bring things to life.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise said nothing as she now picked up her former toy. The cat, while only around 8 or 9 lbs, felt heavier and life like in her hands. The cat gazed up at the teen with its amber eyes, purring contentedly as it rubbed its muzzle against the teen.<br />
<br />
“You made me a pet cat,” Mary Elise asked, still shocked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah Mary I gave you a pet,” Mika said warmly. “Listen, I know we’ve had a lot of problems over the years. I know you’ve been hurt since you lost your dad. I’m hoping your new pet will show you that, you have friends. Whether you wAnt to admit or not Mary. Were your friends and we care about you.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” Mary Elise sniffed, a single tear rolling down her cheek.<br />
<br />
“Hey don’t worry abOut it,” Mika smirked. “Just helping your dad keep his promise. Besides, youy going to have to worry about cleaning up her litter now.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise gave a short laugh as she now pet her new cat. If finally having the pet her father promised her meant cleaning up cat liter, she would gladly do it.</p>
