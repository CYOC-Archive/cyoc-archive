<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael made his way to the lab for his nightly shift. It was a pretty decent gig, especially for a college student, as a lab assistant. Three nights a week from 10PM-2AM he was tasked with observing an ice core the university was housing. This basically meant he would sit in a locked room for hours occasionally checking a thermometer. While it was boring work, Michael was in a very specific situation that made this job ideal. The 19 year old man wasn&#39;t like most college students. While he looked like a decently average male standing around six feet with thick brown hair, and lightly tanned skin. He most usually wore a pair of black shoes, long pants, and button shirt. The most difficult aspect of his appearance he worked to maintain was a clean shaven face. This was a particular issue for Michael because unlike most college students, Michael was actually a satyr. Or more accurately he had been turned into one by accident.  <br />
     See unfortunately in high school Michael had befriended a young witch. He didn&#39;t know she was a witch at the time. Maddie just happened to be a really fun girl to hang out with. The two became fast friends bonding over their mutual hatred of their English teacher. Michael would always invite Maddie to his house, but never him to hers. He made the mistake of finding out why when he followed her home one day out of suspicion. When he entered her home without permission a curse made by Maddie&#39;s ancestors activated that would, &quot;send one back to their magical roots.&quot; Apparently in witch speak that meant it turns any uninvited, unmagical, human into whatever magical creature who intermingled among their ancestors or bloodline. Apparently one of Michael&#39;s ancestors was a satyr because when he entered the house he hit the floor in great pain as a small pair horns sprouted from his skull and his legs reformed into those of a goats complete with a thick covering of brown fur with bits of red in, a little spade shaped tail, and a pair of hard cloven hooves. The transformation was incredibly disorienting. HIs senses had been highly sharpened. He could hear much more with a new set of fuzz covered caprine ears. Especially considering his dick had also increased in size along with his libido. Michael and Maddie were lucky Maddie&#39;s mother was home to cast a restraining spell on Michael or he probably would have hurt Maddie in his fit of confusion, lust, and anger. He was 17 when that incident occurred. <br />
     Maddie&#39;s mother was able to enchant a small bracelet that allowed Michael to take a human form. Eventually he learned to shift between human and satyr at will. Apparently that is an ability young satyrs had that would fade as they grew older. Of course his new life span was much longer. &quot;Older was quite long relative to normal people.&quot; Though of course their were some drawbacks. Michael couldn&#39;t completely hold the satyr back. After his transformation into a human, Michael maintained a decently heavy amount of body hair. Nothing abnormal, but he had gotten into the habit of always wearing long pants and long shirts when he could. He also always tried to keep a clean shaven face though it very much wanted to grow some sort of beard or goatee. Michael was kind of a late bloomer in high school and didn&#39;t want anyone questioning his sudden growth of hair and other features. The habit eventually stuck even when he was past the point of worrying. He also couldn&#39;t maintain a human form indefinitely. There was always a point where he had to shift back into a satyr. He could maintain a human form for a fair bit of extra time, but he would also have to compensate by staying in his satyr form even longer. <br />
     That&#39;s why this lab job was perfect for him. The locked lab was a small room in a basement that had no security camera. It was never visited, and even if it was he would have advanced warning through the door buzzers and his enhanced hearing and other senses. As long as Michael checked the thermometer, It was the perfect place to transform and be himself. Michael would use the opportunity to relive some of his libido. It was always easier to maintain a human form if he consistently masturbated. Maddie had helped him create a special &quot;kit&quot; he could use to help manage his condition. It was basically a small enchanted cleaning kit he could take to a secret place and quickly masturbate. The kit would then quickly remove any evidence as he worked to transform back into a human. Bringing this kit with him everywhere had become something of a ritual for Michael. An emergency valve he could pull if needed. It was a valve he found he needed many times as well. Since becoming a satyr men, women, and everything in between at times seemed appetizing to Michael. Yet he had never actually encountered another satyr and was very afraid to let his condition spread beyond Maddie and her mother. Not even his parents knew their son was secretly a goat man. It was a secret he very much hid away so he avoided any real romantic encounters. Unfortunately, beyond his innate satyr senses Michael and Maddie had never clicked romantically. The one time Michael had tried romance went quite poorly. <br />
     He was 18 and had been living with his condition around a year. He thought he had gotten pretty decent at controlling the satyr. He would let it out regularly in the privacy of his room. Maintaining a human form had become much easier so he said yes to getting drunk at <br />
 a small graduation party with some friends. Michael&#39;s libido kicked in and unable to stop himself because of the alcohol he started transforming during some foreplay with one of the girls at the party. She started screaming about his &quot;demon horns&quot; after she saw them. That was enough to snap Michael back to reality. Thankfully Maddie had also attended the party and was able to alter the memories of the attendees to keep his secret. The only thing the other attendees remember about the party was getting blackout drunk. Since then Michael has worked to avoid pretty much any party or relationship. He instead focused on his studies and got into a strong science college. As hard as being a virginal satyr has been he had found an adequate way of dealing with his condition for the moment. At least until college is over.<br />
           Michael entered the small lab and locked the door behind himself. He spread his senses around the building quickly, sensing nothing, and feeling secure Michael set an alarm on his phone and set it on a desk with his other things. He removed his clothes. His toes didn&#39;t feel the cold floor long as they quickly turned to hard black hooves. His legs reformed into their ungulate shape quickly as the thick brown fur spread across his legs. The hair across his upper body thickened as well to the point of having some patches of fur. His horns then sprouted, a small curved set that had kept growing, and would continue to grow, from the nubs he sprouted when he first transformed. The horns came with the caprine ears, now properly fur covered to match his hair. His nose had also started to take a slightly more caprine shape recently. Another sign of a satyr growing to maturity apparently. The transformation was always a rush that brought an erection. Michael&#39;s member quickly popped out from his satyr legs, ready to go. <br />
     Michael took a quick walk around the room to stretch his legs then pulled out his laptop and moved to pull up one of his favorite porn collections. He quickly went to work stroking his erect dick to relive his stress. This was his usual ritual. He would masturbate until he felt relived, use his magic cleaning kit, checking the temperature of course, and enjoy some time stretching his goat legs walking around the lab, even though it was a smallish space. When his phones alarm would go off he would transform back, get into his clothes, then leave for the dorms where his roommate would usually be asleep. <br />
Michael went through his usual ritual which he&#39;d gotten decently used to doing over the past few months. After buzzing out of the science building Michael made his way along the path the dorms. The cold night air felt good, even though he wasn&#39;t able to fully feel it due to his restrictive clothes. A part of him wanted to strip naked and turn back to his satyr form and go running down the path, but students would probably worry about a horned goat legged &quot;devil&quot; running around campus at night so Michael quashed the want. He hurried back to the dorm hoping sleep would permanently put those wants to bed. As he got to his door though Michael saw a small envelope on the floor outside his door. He could see it had his name written on it in large letters. He picked it up and after opening it, he removed a folded note. <br />
     The note read simply: &quot;I know what you are.&quot; followed by small stamp or ink drawing of a goat legged man. Michael&#39;s heart skipped a beat. After the stamp it continued to read, &quot;Come to 18756 Campus way immediately if you want to keep your secret.&quot; The threat was pretty clear. He took off towards the specified address which happened to be somewhat close to the dorms. It looked like an older house without any lights on. Of course it was pretty late at night. Michael cast his sense out towards the house and couldn&#39;t pick up anything which was odd as he could usually always smell or hear something. He cautiously approached the house and stepped onto the porch. There was a small sign that said &quot;Knock at all hours, someone will answer.&quot; Michael did as he was told and knocked on the door with three hard raps. It was silent for a moment before the door opened. a beam of light appeared along with, a....</p>
