<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nina (his baby sister) crawls toward her toys. Once she gets near them she sit and start playing with them pressing him against the floor. She giggles and babble happily as she plays with her toys and he is forced to listen to all this which gets annoying after a while. Jeff really wonder what can be so exciting in randomly moving various shapes and forms around. Nina occasionally moves around causing him to twist and tug uncomfortably. But he can&#39;t speak or move in any way. Jeff got no choice but to bear with it and the worst is yet to come.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this was not such a good idea he begins to think. Things will certainly get nasty (to say the least) when she finally &quot;use him&quot;. He can already see himself at the bottom of the diaper pail waiting to change back. The more he think about it the more he wish he&#39;d pick something else. Jeff begin to hope that all that twisting and tugging will somehow make him come off allowing him to escape the fate that usually awaits diapers. But unfortunately he is well designed and his arms and leg acting as the diaper&#39;s tabs holds him firmly into place.<br />
<br />
Jeff wonders how long she can keep him clean. Considering that Nina was just changed he think that maybe she wont &quot;go&quot; for a while and perhaps he&#39;ll change back before she does. But then he remember that the timer was set to 48 hours. He doomed himself from the get go... Even if he had not been worn immediately, there would have been plenty of time for his turn to come and then some. Jeff feels like crying as he realize that there is no escape. &quot;I&#39;m definitively going to get soiled&quot; he think hysterically.<br />
<br />
As if on cue, he feels a warm liquid splashing against his face. He feels like his entire face is submerged in pee as it start to puddle in the diaper quicker than it can drain threw his mouth. His lips acting as leg guard making sure not a single drops leak outside. &quot;OMG !! IT&#39;S HAPPENING !&quot; Jeff thinks in panic. The pee seems to make way to his stomach before progressively being absorbed by what feels like his tongue. Yet the taste was strangely nice it had a rich salty flavor not strong salt but a soft, yet the flavor was so much more complex more like that of a carbonated soft drink, but with out the bubbles, and then having his face covered in the warm liquid feels so good, but this only serves to make it worse because he knows its disgusting and the fact that it feels nice only makes it more so.<br />
<br />
Seems like the surface layer of the inside which is supposed to keep the gel beneath it is his face and the countless tiny holes in it allowing pee to pass threw act like is mouth. The thin sac containing the gel powder is his stomach. The gel powder itself (which ultimately absorb pee locking it away in a semi-solid form) feels like his tongue but is really all his vital organs (including his heart and brain). The pee is slowly being absorbed and fused with his inner self. Jeff is somehow conscious of all this and his horrified as he feel his body absorb more and more pee regardless of his will. This continues until his sister is finally done and the pee finally soaks all in leaving her skin almost dry.<br />
<br />
Nina kept playing without a care in the world seemingly unaware of what she just did. Yet she was unconsciously relieved and satisfied. Enjoying the warm squishy feeling that her brother was now giving her every time she moved. Jeff on the other hand was going mad. The awful taste grew better and better as the pee was gradually soaking in, but this only serves to increases his horror over the whole odeal. By the time all the pee was finally absorbed, the taste was flooding his mouth like he just drank a whole glass of soft drink and showed no signs of fading. Seems like the wonderful taste was there to stay.<br />
<br />
Jeff lost track of time. The annoying giggling or the uncomfortable twisting and tugging did not mattered anymore. All he could think about was that his sisters disgusting waste was part of him now and worse it felt and tasted so good. How long have he been enduring it? It felt like years had past already. But it was obviously less than that. &quot;48 hours of this... what in hell was I thinking !&quot; he reflected. &quot;A diaper ! Of all things a diaper ! It&#39;s going to be fun ! Smart Jeff... real smart&quot; he scolded himself in his desperation.<br />
<br />
Eventually, he feels himself behind lifted into the air and carried away as he hear is mother say &quot;Times for dinner sweety&quot;. Moments later Nina was in her high chair and her mother was feeding her. Jeff could somehow hear strange and creepy gurgling sounds coming from his sister. Being strapped around her so closely, he could easily hear what was happening inside her body. He was starring at his sister&#39;s ass in profound disgust. He have just been reminded that as miserable as he is now, things could still get much much worst unless his sister was changed soon. Unfortunately for him, his sister did not seem to mind her wet diaper one bit. His mother always bought high quality diapers that did great at keeping babies&#39; skin dry. No particular design was selected, so the Chronivac apparently copied the design of the surrounding diapers so that he would fit in perfectly. The baby powder was also helping with residual moisture. Increasing his sister&#39;s comfort. Jeff&#39;s sister would probably need to pee some more before she start feeling uncomfortable. The simple thought of having to absorb even more pee made him want to throw up.<br />
<br />
Unless something else happens first he thinks starring at his sister&#39;s asshole again. Then it started to throb and twitch a bit to Jeff horror. &quot;GOD NO ! not yet ! Not so soon !&quot; He thought hysterically. She only let out a fart as if answering his prayers but still giving him a small preview of what&#39;s to come. Most of the air was expelled to make room for the dreaded gas. The smell was like burnt cheese, which was strangely enjoyable but there was still a hint of foulness to it like the cheese was past it&#39;s used by date. The water tight diaper was doing a good job of keeping the smell contained prolonging Jeff&#39;s ordeal. Yet beside all this, Jeff was still grateful that it was just a fart. A fart would eventually go away. Then he heard more gurgling sounds as her mother was still feeding her. The sounds seemed scarier than ever. He felt that the food was not intended for his sister, but in fact for him. Like his mother was helping her prepare poop for him.<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t take it anymore. He wanted to get out of this nightmare. He would kill himself if he could. But he was a diaper now. Faithfully fulfilling his duty whether he likes it or not. He would contain all his sister&#39;s wastes until his mother finally discard him. There is nothing he could do about it. That is just how things were. He&#39;ll just have to wait until the 48 hours are up and then he could try to forget everything about this. Still, he hoped his mother would change her before she gets to use him further he thought. Then Jeff panicked as her ass twitched again letting out an other fart. Then Jeff realized something. When people start farting repeatedly it often means that they need to poop. &quot;Please mom, change her already ! I mean she have been wet for a while already. Come on !&quot; Jeff begged in silence.</p>
