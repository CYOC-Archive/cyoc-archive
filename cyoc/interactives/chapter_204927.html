<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unsurprisingly, it was the mother of the group, Tiffani, who got all of the bickering kids to stop fighting. Her woman&#39;s intuition informed her that these two strangers could be trusted. She grabbed Brenda and Meiko&#39;s hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, have I ever taught you two to be rude to guests?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, mom&quot; Meiko repeated, with Brenda repeating soon after. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Brenda, I want you to let our other guests downstairs leave in peace, with maybe a fresh pair of pants if we have any.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine&quot; Brenda huffed, as she walked on her eight legs and did as she was told.  <br />
<br />
The two undercover policemen ran outside the house and into their car as fast as they could, not even noticing Barry and Regina in the rush. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
The two groups of women were mutually surprised as their hostile negotiations gradually cooled down from boiling to a simmer, the ladies seeming more and more like a sewing circle as they got to know each other better.   <br />
<br />
Regina had been worried at first that Barry would continue to escalate things with her righteous indignation or that she would make some careless wiseacre comment at Brenda or Meiko, but overall, she was behaving herself pretty well. Regina was proud of her, she was doing so well on her first &quot;adventure&quot; as Barry had called it earlier, and a small part of Regina secretly wished that Barry was her Co-Sorceress Supreme instead of Aziza, who she liked as a friend but found too immature as a partner.<br />
<br />
Alas, the job position was already filled.<br />
<br />
Brenda and Meiko Weir had calmed down too, or at least they had become less guarded and more willing to see things from their guest&#39;s point of view once they sufficiently believed that neither stranger was planning to steal the Chronivac from them. <br />
<br />
Regina explained her role as the Sorceress Supreme, a brief explanation of the recent history of her world and why she and Barry were here. <br />
<br />
When Brenda asked for proof that Regina was a sorceress, Regina had opened a portal in the Weir&#39;s living room that showed everyone a stunning view of the cosmos, which Shannon had audibly gasped in childlike awe at when she felt the heat from a nearby G class star. When Brenda snarked that she could see the same thing at any planetarium, Regina with a casual flick of her finger transformed the blonde beauty into an actual spider, a harmless Daddy Long Legs, before quickly transforming her back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you believe me now?&quot; Regina asked, with a smirk. <br />
<br />
Brenda had been thoroughly convinced, shaking her head. <br />
<br />
Meiko was sufficiently humbled too. Compared to this &quot;sorceress&quot;, if such a thing really truly existed, her power to inspire awe and reverence in everyone who gazed upon her seemed so quaint by comparison. <br />
<br />
Tiffani and Shannon, meanwhile, were being thrown for a loop. Their lives had already drastically changed over the last few days thanks to Brenda and Meiko&#39;s actions, and now freaking witches from other realities and their Muggle girlfriends were invading their home. <br />
<br />
&quot;So on your version of Earth, you&#39;re *all* lesbians? Like, everyone is?&quot; Shannon asked, dumbfounded.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. It took a magic ring created by the Sumerian goddess Inanna and a born woman making a really impulsive, poorly considered wish with it that could have ended disastrously in a million different ways, but somehow it all worked out. Six years running, and mostly everyone seems happy with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenda and Meiko looked at each other, knowing what the one one was thinking. <br />
<br />
Their plan could work. Lesbian Land could work. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Discussion turned towards the rarity of all female worlds in the multiverse, and how this world and the Great Change world seemed very compatible with one another. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know how there are sister cities? Our worlds are like Sister Earths, and sisters need to stick together&quot; Regina pitched. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell how much you two love each other&quot; she elaborated, staring deliberately at Brenda and Meiko. &quot;So I thought we could all be, you know, allies, starting with perhaps an exchange of sorts.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of exchange?&quot; Brenda asked defensively.<br />
<br />
&quot;The first thing is that since there will inevitably be men that won&#39;t or will refuse to join your new religion, and that part of your goal is to depopulate the earth for environmental reasons, I could set up a portal so men who are unwilling to go lesbigay could pass through it and live on our version of Earth. Climate change has already been dealt with on our planet, and we have plenty of room, so the population growth won&#39;t hurt us at all. And if they want to come back, it&#39;s just as easy as walking through that portal. Perhaps some of them would just be curious to see what an all female world is already like, or they have a lesbian fetish and want to hang around a bunch of hot women. I already mentioned how after the Great Change, our attractiveness is off the charts. Giving men an option to opt out of this place would alleviate lot of the moral problems I have with your new religion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You honestly wouldn&#39;t mind a bunch of gross pervy guys ogling you as you walk to the mailbox to get your mail like they&#39;re on hot girl safari?&quot; Brenda asked, her face contorting into one of disgust for the first time since Regina and Barry&#39;s arrival. She, like Meiko, truly detested men. <br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I wouldn&#39;t really care&quot; Regina shrugged, making a face.  &quot;I don&#39;t mind guys. I used to be one. I just don&#39;t find them physically attractive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s easy for you to say&quot; Tiffani said. &quot;You&#39;re Asian chick Dr Strange. What about any Average Jane just going about her day? I know that I&#39;d be uncomfortable.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You two clearly don&#39;t have a mind for business&quot; Barry injected, staring at Meiko and Brenda. &quot;You both could make a fortune being gatekeepers for every horny guy that wants to go on vacation to lesbian Disney World. I know garbagewomen that look like Maxim cover models on our Earth. Garbagewomen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s not like everyone thinks the exact same way just because we&#39;re all sexy lesbians&quot; Regina said. &quot;We didn&#39;t turn into Muff Diver U.S.S.R where there&#39;s only one official line of thought. There&#39;s still a diversity of opinion on everything, including the extinction of men. A lot of us miss men. I mean, there are a lot of rah rah I Hate Men, Vagina Power dykes out there too, but not as many as you&#39;d think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Barry added. &quot;I&#39;m happy being a woman overall, but I don&#39;t hate men either. Henry Rollins is a guy, and he&#39;s pretty cool. Or he was anyway. Now she&#39;s a she. So seeing a pair of balls and a dick jogging past the house every now and then wouldn&#39;t really bother me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meiko blushed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I always thought that sexy lesbians like us would just love a world with no men in it. I guess I thought wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s your god complex talking, Meiko. Believe me, I&#39;ve had to deal with that myself&quot; Regina said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I get a god complex whenever I win at Call of Duty, so I get it too&quot; Barry added. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait&quot; Brenda countered. &quot;I actually am not on board with this. You told us about this Kylie Perkins broad earlier, and she sounds absolutely messed up. If you have some mentally unstable woman in your reality with crazy god powers that can create eternal winters and make the laws of physics her bitch on a whim, there&#39;s no rhyme or reason to what is real anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Tiffani agreed. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t feel safe with this Kylie person running around, or even just the potential of her coming through the portal and causing chaos here, and her girlfriend sounds selfish as fuck. I get being in love. Your partner sounds sweet and romantic and I get where she&#39;s coming from, but like...girl, you&#39;re simping for a maniac.&quot;<br />
<br />
Regina shrugged. <br />
<br />
&quot;What can I say? They&#39;re kids and they&#39;re in love. They can&#39;t... won&#39;t see the bigger picture yet. They don&#39;t understand that romantic love doesn&#39;t last forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch&quot; Barry said right next to Regina.<br />
<br />
Regina rubbed Barry&#39;s attractively thick thighs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Besides us, dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I have Kylie and my partner under control&quot; Regina added. <br />
<br />
&quot;For now&quot; Meiko said. &quot;Until you don&#39;t have things under control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So&quot;, Meiko asked, &quot;what&#39;s this second exchange?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My second proposal, is that we can set up some type of dispensary for your pills on our Earth. There undoubtedly would be plenty of women dying to be young and immortal, and I would like to be your first customer.&quot;</p>
