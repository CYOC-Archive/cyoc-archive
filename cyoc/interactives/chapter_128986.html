<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was still early when Katie finally woke up. The little six year old stretched and gazed at the ten other girls spread across the fold out couch they had all slept on. “Huh we’re still little,” she mused. Smiling Katie hopped off the couch and padded to the kitchen to find something to eat.<br />
<br />
Even making cereal was a chore at her current age. Sloppily she poured a bowl of cereal, spilling milk all over the kitchen counter. “Hey,” a little voice chirped. “Be careful.” Katie turned to see Lisa frowning at her. The little red haired girl was dressed in a pink nightgown and was tapping her barefoot in displeasure. “Sorry Lisa I was hungry,” Katie giggled. Lisa smirked as she looked at her niece. “I’m hungry too but we’re too little to really make anything. Just grab a snack for now, like cookies.”<br />
<br />
Katie watched as Lisa grabbed a chair, pushing it to the kitchen counter and climbing it. Searching the table top Lisa gave a childish cheer as she grabbed a package of cookies and hopped down. “I thought you said never to eat cookies for breakfast,” Katie giggled as she grabbed her bowl of cereal. Lisa stuck out her tongue, happily shoveling a bunch of cookies in her mouth. “That was when I was a grown up,” she giggled. “There’s no grown ups around now so we make the rules.”<br />
<br />
Katie giggled as she watched the young girl walk back to the living room and hop onto the couch. She now happily began flicking through channels as she swung her feet above the floor. “Anything good on,” Katie asked as she began eating. Lisa shook her head frowning. “It’s all boring news shows,” she grumbled. “Usually I don’t mind but the usually I’m not six. I miss the days when Saturdays had nothing but cartoons.”<br />
<br />
As the t.v. blared Katie could see some of the others begin to stir. Slowly Kumiko, Julia and Claudia stretched and yawned. “Wow I slept great,” Julia yawned, turning she could see that none of them had turned back to their old selves yet. “How come we’re still little,” she asked. Katie shrugged as the tall girl now stood up and looked at the others. Frowning she now approached Lisa. “Lisa why are we still kids,” Lisa shushed Julia as she now found some cartoons. <br />
<br />
“It’s not nice to shush people,” Julia grumbled as she now stood next to the smaller girl. Lisa looked up at Julia feeling a tiny bit of intimidation from her. Gulping she tried to steady herself. “We’ll be normal soon,” she said, trying to hide the fear in her voice. “Just relax til then. You want some cookies?”<br />
<br />
Julia frowned before taking the bag of cookies from Lisa and eating. “Hey,” Lisa whined. “I said some not all gimme them.”<br />
<br />
Katie now watched as Julia and Lisa began wrestling for the cookies. Julia, being much taller was able to overpower the smaller girl, knocking her to the floor. Lisa now began to whimper as her eyes began to dampen with tears. “Your a meanie,” she whined. “I’m telling.”<br />
<br />
Julia froze looking at the girl. “No,” she yelled. “Don’t tell I’m sorry please.”<br />
<br />
Extending her hand Julia now helped Lisa onto the couch as the two began to share the snack while happily watching t.v. Katie had watched this exchange with interest, noting how childish Lisa and Julia were acting. Looking at the ring she began to worry. Taking a deep breath she now asked the ring if everything was okay. “Whatcha doing Katie,” Kumiko asked.<br />
<br />
Katie looked up to see the young Asian girl curiously looking at her. Kumiko was sporting a purple nightgown that rested at her shins. Her chestnut hair falling to her upper back. “I wanted to ask the ring a question,” Katie said. Kumiko nodded looking at Lisa and Julia. “I’m guessing because those two are acting like kids huh,” she said flatly. Katie nodded, surprised by Kumikos response. “How did you know,” she asked in amazement.<br />
<br />
“I’m guessing they’re feeling just like I am,” she smiled. “It’s weird but ever since we became kids last night I’ve been feeling more and more like a kid. It feels...weird not like a bad weird but weird...am I making any sense?”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded again as she thought. She had been feeling like that also. As she thought about it she began to form an idea. This was only the second time she had made herself younger, while she felt like a kid she had a grasp over it. For Lisa and Julia they had both been reduced to childhood on several occasions. Katie figured that the more you revisited your childhood the easier it was to act like a child. She also figured that the longer you spent as a child the more childish you began to act. “I understand Kumi,” she said. “And just out of curiousity how come you’re not acting like those two?”<br />
<br />
Kumiko smiled as she placed her hands on her hips. “I was always very mature,” she stated. “My parents would never let me act like a kid so I never got a chance to. Kind of why I went a little wild as a teen.”<br />
<br />
Katie looked at the ring now asking when they would return to normal. In only moments though she got her answer causing her to sigh with relief. “Well Kumi,” She said. “If you’re going to act like a kid I suggest you do it soon. We should all start changing back to normal in an hour.”<br />
<br />
Kumiko now thought about the answer for a moment before smiling. Kicking off her slippers the young girl now raced for the pullout bed and began to jump. “Wake up sleepy heads,” she giggled as she jumped higher and higher. Lisa and Julia looked at Kumiko for a moment before smirking. “Can’t let you have all the fun Kumi,” Lisa giggled as she now joined her friend. The two girls were soon joined by Julia who laughed wildly as the three grown down adults giggled loudly.<br />
<br />
“What’s with those three,” Claudia groaned as she rubbed her eyes. “They’re just enjoying their second childhood. How are you Claudia?”<br />
<br />
“I’m okay,” she answered yawning. “Aside from the fact I’m super short and feel like a kid.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah that’s happened to all of us,” Katie giggled. “We should start growing back up in an hour so enjoy being a kid till then.”<br />
<br />
Claudia sighed as she looked over at the others. “Too bad it’s not longer would be fun to be a kid for a day.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah but could be dangerous too Claudia I mean we’re too young to take care of ourselves plus we’re becoming More childish as time goes on.”<br />
<br />
“Katie,” Claudia asked tentatively. “Are we in danger of becoming little kids for real?”<br />
<br />
Katie looked at the ring before answering. “No,” she said. “But I think the longer you stay a kid the more you want to stay a kid. Kinda like go on a long vacation and not wanting to leave.”<br />
<br />
Claudia giggled at the explanation as she turned towards the fold out bed. “Well then I better enjoy the time I have,” She giggled as she raced towards the bed and began jumping. Katie finished her cereal and joined the others giggling and laughing like a child. The hour passed too quickly and soon the girl she began to feel the tingles indicating they were growing back up again.<br />
<br />
“Aww already,” Katie groaned as she saw herself go from 7 to 8. The others also began frowning. Julia, Kumiko and Lisa now jumped down off the couch pulling their nightgowns down. “”We um seem to be getting too big for our britches,” Lisa muttered noticing the nightgown was now resting mid theigh and quickly rising. KAtie and Claudia turned and laughed. The three adults were age in grade faster than the others. Already preteens they quickly ran towards Lisa’s bedroom, trying to keep the nightgowns from exposing their rears.<br />
<br />
As Katie’s and Claudia became 9 they notice don’t the other beginnings to stir. “What was with all the yelling,” Sammy moaned noticing her blue nightgown was getting shorter. “Just reliving our childhoods Sammy,” Claudia giggled as she now grabbed up some clothes to change. The others began doing the same realizing they would all be showing off their panties if they didn’t. Katie now turned to Kellie who was smiling at her.<br />
<br />
“Aren’t you gonna change too,” Katie asked as they became 10. Kellie smiled before hugging her girlfriend. “Yeah in a few minutes,” she mused. “But How can’t I pass up the opportunity to see my girlfriend in her panties. Katie smiled as she gaZed at Kellies growing body. “I see what you’re saying,” she cooed. “Definitely hard to pass up.”<br />
The two girls now held hands as they began to swell through puberty. As they became 13 the two teens noticed puberty beginning and couldn’t help but kiss. By the time they were 16 the girlfriend she couldn’t help but blush and giggle. The nightgowns barely covered their asses showing off a great deal of their stretched cotton panties. As they now walked towards Katies room to change they wondered what the rest of the summer would hold.</p>
