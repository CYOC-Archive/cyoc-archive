<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bowen smirked, groped and ravaged his hard member and proud of his well-timed prank on the Leader’s Big Bro in college. He needed sum good fuck from that bitch later, whose taking too god damn long in the shower.<br />
<br />
But first, he had to have some fun with the contacts he’d gotten over the invite in the gaming group which his “STOOOOOPID” leader forgotten to add him in which he yelled-<br />
<br />
“WHAT?! DONT TELL ME I EXISTED ONLY YESTERDAY YOU FUCK!” He responded , unknowingly with incredibly irony, just mere hours ago before hopping into his girlfriend’s private car and to her place.<br />
<br />
“YO BITCH! HOW LONG MORE!”<br />
“A GIRL NEEDS HER PRIVATE TIME YOU INCOMPETENT BRUTE!”<br />
“ARRGGHHHHH!”<br />
<br />
He yelled in anger, face flushing red as he laidback on her princess designed king sized bed naked and incredibly aroused-frown not long after shifting to a cocky-dirty looking smirk as he shifted one hand to fondle with his manhood and the other to prank an unsuspecting victim before scoring.<br />
<br />
And man, he needed a good fuck from that whinny BEEEEETCHHHHH<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Eiden was so excited today, after many attempts of careful persuasion and months of bonding, he finally managed to muster up the courage to convince his crush to come over to chill and play MOBA.<br />
<br />
Ray Koh was a cool nerd, those do exist apparently, being an asian with quite decent muscle as well as playing soccer from time to time despite being sick often.<br />
<br />
And has a deep sounding voice that simply drives Eiden’s insides insane.<br />
<br />
Eiden’s simply lived alone and independently when he managed to get into his college of choice. Choosing one of the more secluded dorms far west so that he wouldn’t be awakened by those noisy flats with frat boys in them.<br />
<br />
He thought about how Ray looked, standing around 5ft 11 with muscle laying on his arms leanly so as though they just fit tightly through sleeves.<br />
<br />
Typically dressed casual in a plain starched button down tee with brown shorts and a couple of loafers-to which most of his business course mates including himself wore.<br />
<br />
His thighs being little to the muscular side in which they bursted out of the light brown khaki shorts he wears often, after all-he kicked balls pretty often, with feet being a thick rough size 14 to which he occasionally kicks his loafers off and exposes them crosslegged next to his secret admirer in class.<br />
<br />
Similarly, his buttocks were extremely grope-able, being round as ever and filled with muscle definition probably cause of the squats he did during soccer. Oh and not to mention the cute outline of slightly protruding pecs <br />
-with possibly a faint six pack hidden below- accentuating his soon to be V shaped manly chest and most prominently thick broadening muscles shaping up his back to which Eiden just drools over.<br />
<br />
Ironically, those features he described were incredibly close to how Eiden himself looked. Except...just replace the parts with muscle and broadness....with fat and pudgy...yeah. Though this is that part where Ray’s completely different.<br />
<br />
His hair full of wavy curls to which he styles it in a messy pompadour-ish fashion like the koreans do-  tanned-yellowish complexion which compliments his small slanted eyes/prominent nose and square shaped jaw with features and pale politeness from the Japanese while rugged country slang and broadness from the chinese.<br />
<br />
Features a complete mixture of Japanese-korean and chinese, not that Ray could speak anything from his heritage aside chinese-hokkien, but still it was completely cool and in which Eiden just finds it soooo hot—<br />
<br />
Better than his pastry pale skin, button nose and wide eyes despite supposedly being half chinese. Wavy long hair that just refuses to stay still and a face round as ever that accentuates his pudginess even more.<br />
<br />
With the comparison of looks...of course, even if Ray was gay...love is most likely one sided. Plus from their experiences in class, despite both playing the same MOBA-their interests are way different. Him being the more athletic sociable type while Eiden just wants to stay by himself and only interact when there’s a presentation for show.<br />
<br />
Eiden’s knew this all along yet Ray was too cute to pass off. He had to try, or at the very least, relish every moment they spent time with one another...even if that ain&#39;t often.<br />
<br />
And a start&#39;s always a start, waiting for his buddy and crush on his chair as—-<br />
<br />
RING RING<br />
-pick up-<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Ray? Is that you---?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah Fuck Man! You sound like a fucking gay dweeb SHIIIIIIIIIT!&quot;<br />
<br />
He went out of the voice call area for a sec- clicking on the profile pic on the caller and cross checked it with his favorite MOBA group...which to his amazement is spammed full of notifications.<br />
<br />
Recognizing the new addition , with the name listed as “Bro-wen” and a douchebag mugshot of himself flipping off as his profile pic, his status being an iconic “Sup fuckers” which represents his asshole-ery.<br />
<br />
The complete dickhead apparently spammed nearly every bit of his group chat. From music commenting that he only listens to sweet ass raps from alphas, from general talking about how he “Whooped” the enemy team over and over, from his introduction asking for hot pics of gamer girls while arrogantly spamming pics saying how hot he is-pics filled of his swole gamer bod-posing in rude-typical boyish swag which Eiden obviously lacked.<br />
<br />
Which naturally, too, attracted the gay dweeb. Despite his ever longing love for Ray, he had to admit-this guy is really hot. With boner rising into action-so did the curse with an-UGH!<br />
<br />
As the first waves of nausea hit him for mere seconds. So did the hetero homophobic curse.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong MANNNNNN?! Caught the gay? HAHA!” Bowen boisterously laughed, soon to be fucking cunt, as Eiden snapped out of his Daze and gently spoke.<br />
<br />
“Oh...you’re the new—-“<br />
“MAN! I just can’t wait to be grinding that PUSSEH like FUCK FUCK!”<br />
<br />
Eiden paused briefly, not knowing what to respond to that incredibly heterosexual line. But as the het curse commanded it, his mouth hollered on their own-fingers becoming meatier and worn as though they been lifting things-<br />
<br />
“Haha dude! Solo again?”<br />
“FUCK NO, Just bitch showering again.”<br />
<br />
Things-More like weights as he suddenly thought of as the wave of nausea dissipates. Palms growing huger and rougher, full on gamer hands as though he played for ages instead of just to impress his crush.<br />
<br />
Still in a daze, not even fully comprehending the het convo he’s having with the other male as his thoughts slowly shift from gay lust to working on his physique-and yeah he needed that...to impress em...just like his bro bowen....bowen???<br />
<br />
&quot;HAHA Shit man...&quot; he facepalmed, a deep bellow emmersed from his mouth as he spoke those words, sounding dumber and lamer like a hybrid you&#39;d only see in a westernised asian.<br />
“That means she ain’t into you—-?!”<br />
<br />
“WHA KANINA CHIBA-!”<br />
“WALAO EH CALLIN ME CHIBAI CHIBAI?”<br />
<br />
“ONE V ONE ME SCRUB!” The duo bellowed in unison to the other. Words that come out of someone whose obsessed with his MOBA.<br />
<br />
His nostrils flared, skin reddening under the imitation of the slang and crude speech from the other side of the phone. One gamer hand holding the phone while the other curls into a fist and-<br />
<br />
FLEX! Does a bicep curl as though he’s lifting an invisible weight with TWO KG, back down and TEN KG, back down and TEN KG! A need to flex and work out to reaffirm his masculinity as his right and left arm swelled simultaneously into hard-earned biceps from the gym.<br />
<br />
Either way, the conversation continued with the growing male winning in putting the already-ultra het male down. Not stop with his winning streak, rudely “teasing” his new MOBA friend with absolute aggression. In less than a minute, their convo became so natural like as though they were bros just fucking around with each other.<br />
<br />
 “EUUGHHHH!” Eiden yawned loudly, with a lack of any decency. Arms stretchiiiiing not long after due to the “workout” he just had as he decided to leave his phone on voice speaker and proceeded to flex side ways to admirer his muscles.<br />
<br />
Partially in a daze, he chucked dumbly as  he watched his thickened arms straining against his short sleeved buttoned down. Biceps curling thickly as they tale on a dark shade of tanned-yellowish brown like as though he’s been out of the sun very often.<br />
<br />
He rolled his shoulders backwards, bones popping satisfyingly as he kicked his feet upward on the computer desk as with every word, every broken syllable uttered to his bro, his legs lengthened massively by 5 centimeters. <br />
<br />
Stopping only at a hefty 6ft 2, something he would admire if the het virus wasn’t dulling his senses.<br />
<br />
Rolling in his swivel seat, longer legs barely missing the credentials his computer desk as his lazy shoulders widened, proud of the aftermath of the workout as the tanned hue spreads to his back.<br />
<br />
Tints of light-hearted boyish boisterous welled deep within, as his shoulders get loaded with muscle like the hollering het he is talking too. Tough broad shoulders that can lift little bros and babes anywhere.<br />
<br />
Though...he does not have a brother...or does he?<br />
<br />
Longer legs springing him back to the direction of his bed. Room subconsciously changing in according to the new reality with for some reason happened right after-<br />
<br />
DING DONG!<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa...FUCK!&quot; <br />
-SPLASH!-<br />
“FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT DOORBELL!”<br />
<br />
Eiden instantaneously slicked his slightly wet hair backwards, in total shock as while the old him would occasionally put a glass of water on his bed side table-the new him would lay out his hairdryer and some gel products that he used for hair fluffing after a good long shower.<br />
<br />
“SERVES U FUUUUUUCKIN RIGHT MAN!”<br />
“GO FUCK YOURSELF!”<br />
<br />
He turned around and quickly got up. “Da Fuck?” Eyes now wide open and staring at his towering new height over 6 ft with huge strong arms to go with it, as he simultaneously flexed them once more and looked around the room-<br />
<br />
He was a gamer by heart-but now he’s a full on gamer by default. Tons of gaming headset gear-various consoles and even tournament trophies dedicated to “The Brash Titans.” Which he distinctly remembered being a part of.<br />
<br />
He cracked his shoulders satisfyingly, if he’s gonna be buff then he’s gonna be buff. Personality traits shifting alongside the room, sensing the growing attraction towards girls via a mixture of beautiful ladies and cute girls from his MOBA.<br />
<br />
He snagged the blow dryer and aimed directly at his hair-letting the water dry up to wax that assisted in the fluffiness of his messed up hair. <br />
The girls dig his messed up pompadour, and knowing how many girls he scored makes him confident-and that’s what he needed.<br />
<br />
He swaggered out his his swivel seat, not even realising it becoming messier and messier with every step, unwashed dishes piled up in his mini sink and piles of clothes scattered about. <br />
<br />
So messy but he was a guy, bet the chick outside won’t mind—-<br />
<br />
“CREAKKK!”<br />
<br />
“Sup dude!” The younger teen standing outside the door, who the former Eiden would go head of heels to-<br />
<br />
He couldn’t care less about the man. Like he’s just another guy-nothing wrong nothing interesting.<br />
<br />
Though the remaining part of the old Eiden tried to fight back, wanting to be in a relationship with the cute boy he crushed on-he wanted it so bad—<br />
<br />
“Ohhh Fucking gay isit?”<br />
&quot;Fuck dude no...NO!&quot; <br />
<br />
Eiden shouted at his bro, completely ignoring the presence of his house guest outside as his eyes glared to no one in particular. Lifting his arms up in a very frustrated way as he stomped back into his gamer chair.<br />
<br />
“CHILLLLL lah...know you got bitches attached with you...”<br />
“HELL YEAH I DO!”<br />
<br />
Eiden paused for a sec there, eyes swirling in confusion as a faint outline of breasts appearing, before they multiply endlessly surrounding his otome-like fantasy. Dick rising full mast-which sped up his remaining transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man...bitches love me.&quot; Eiden uncorrected his gaming posture, cracking his already broad shoulders and THRUSTING his chest and pecs out as he starred at his new fullbody mirror.<br />
<br />
With someone whose scored a lot of girls and women in this new reality, his ego inflated, narcissism reaching a peak as he RIPPED his old threads right apart ,his shirt in tatters hanging from his chest as it swells with a THUMP- A THUMP-!<br />
<br />
“OHHHHHHHH!”<br />
<br />
He watched his pectorals inflate to the size of grapefruits. Bouncing them like he’s carrying his team as Pop pop POP POP POP POP! COBBLESTONE ABS BUILT FRESH FROM THE GYM.<br />
<br />
Continuing his conversation with Bowen whilist admiring himself, tannish hue overtaking his bare chest along his his thighs-feet-het virus circulating faster than ever as he took a deep GULP! As whatever he swallowed remained a lump on his neck -giving him an even deeper-sexier-hammier-more asian voice than he ever had as his face flushes in that same hue that donned his entire body.<br />
<br />
He brushed and adjusted his ripped short sleeved dress shirt. Looking in the mirror and thinking he should leave the middle unbuttoned permanently for the ladies to see. The remains etching a lighter material, darkening to black with white Hawaiian prints that represents how chill and cool he is.<br />
<br />
Which was ironic since he is never chill but appropriate since he’s cool.<br />
<br />
Cool, minor body hair formed around his body, some on his arms, a treasure trail, and his legs. Legs-thighs melting all that fat and converting them to muscle as he SQUATS, feeling the stretch and tear of years of soccer practice-sure he did football too but SOCCER WAS HIS LIFE MAN!<br />
<br />
Kicking balls ever so frequently as his feet expands to a size 15. So big and thats why he was the lead, tons of soccer memorabilia was added on top of his gamer equipment. His own khakis becoming stretchier and stretchier like his jockstrap hidden below as they turned into XL soccer shorts, colors imprinted of his favorite team.<br />
<br />
Unknowingly, also the favorite team of Ray-<br />
<br />
“Specially miss the chick back at New York and all her-!”<br />
“Hey Bro....?”<br />
<br />
The sound of that multi-nese asian suddenly caused his meatier fingers to contract and SHUT his phone. Like...the little guy was supposed to be someone important to him but he just can’t put his game finger on it....<br />
<br />
Turning to the door as his ass- PUMPS OUT a nice solid bubble butt, wincing slightly as he feels his groin push and plump out even further despite him trying to focus on his house guest.<br />
<br />
Not literally though cause that’ll be GHEYYYY!<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry man...?&quot; Eiden apologised, scratching behind his head-subconsciously adopting the other teen’s habits the old him admired from a distance. Gesturing the younger male to come towards him on his bed as he sat down and reopened and typed on his phone-<br />
<br />
—-LAST MESSAGE FROM BRO-WEN—-<br />
<br />
“Who dat fucker?”<br />
“Just my lil bro.”<br />
“Oh ok, cool.”<br />
“Chat more later tmr face to face k?”<br />
“K, gotta go fuck bitch she finally out.”<br />
“Go fuck her senseless man.”<br />
<br />
—-END CHAT—-<br />
<br />
“You talking to your girlfriend again?”<br />
“HAHA WHICH? Jk nah, just my best bro Bowen.”<br />
“Oh him, kay cool.”<br />
“Kay cool YOUR ASS!”<br />
<br />
On the count of ASS, he pinched Ray’s butt as ,whose supposedly now his little bro, so hard until the beta male shrieked and jerked up with a “YEEP!” He deserves it for trying to be a carbon copy of his bro ....den...something den....ah shit he’ll remember his name eventually.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man...teasing lil bro is so fun...&quot; The man smirked once more, recalling those cute expressions Ray responded to his messing around. The remaining part of the gay left within him smiled-while the near complete straight version of himself could only think one thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lil bro be givin me the faggot, chibai...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that thought, he spanked his little brother’s back so hard till he fell onto the floor. Clenching his head as the final transformation takes hold.<br />
<br />
“WHATS WRONG WITH YOU MAN?”<br />
<br />
&quot;Ngghhhhhhhh....&quot; The almost-transformed older brother tried resisting the homophobic thoughts echoing in his head. Struggling to keep hold of the image of Ray before an imagine of Bowen appears and yells<br />
<br />
“NO HOMO BRAH!”<br />
<br />
The two faces merged into one, as his jawline defines, chiseled while angular like his old crush. Eyes slanted with an occasional need for glasses cause of his intense gaming like bowen. Eyebrows frowning, nose prominent and sexy like “an adian superstar” like a babe called him that. <br />
<br />
Looking at the full body mirror in front of him, not a trace of the former Eiden remaining as black studs PIERCE onto his ear with an  “No....!”, as his confused expression shifts to an uncontrollable smirk. Eyes cocky as ever as he YELLED<br />
<br />
&quot;NO HOMO BRO!&quot;<br />
<br />
Raiden Koh bellowed loudly as he smacked his younger brother in the butt. Arm hugging his younger sibling like the good ol days of roughhousing when they were younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t wait to tell your cousins that---!&quot; Raiden raised his toned biceps and pulled his younger, furious looking brother to a hidden camera ,stashed near his bed, and bellowed--<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU JUST GOT PRANKED BRO! AHAHAHA!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck off la Raiden...!&quot; Ray shouted, fury in place of any politeness, which he held back with his classmates-letting it loose in front of his Big bashful brother.<br />
<br />
Eiden would probably be distraught if he heard that “fuck off” from Ray directing to him, Raiden is damn proud of his younger sibling using the language he shamelessly on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chillllllll dude....!&quot; Raiden exaggerated his movements in a sarcastic fashion, eyes wide open with an expression that could barely contain his laughter. &quot;No need to go all fag about it...Its just a prank brah !&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro! That was so lame!&quot; Ray mouth starting to curl up at the corners. &quot;I bet your mother can do better than that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ray and Raiden’s sibling rivalry may be a rocky relationship, but the both of them sure loved one another as family, which is why they always hung out with one another...even if one may be a brat sometimes and the other a douchebag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna prank some geeks like old times, bro?&quot;<br />
&quot;You already know what&#39;s the answer , man!&quot;<br />
<br />
BROFIST!</p>
