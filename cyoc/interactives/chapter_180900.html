<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So what&#39;d you wish for?&quot; Paul asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Secret,&quot; Jeff smirked. &quot;You&#39;ll have to figure it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul rolled his eyes at the challenge. &quot;Fine. But what do you want to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see just how strong that body is of yours. But how..?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The school gym?&quot; Paul offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are we supposed to get in there?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your key? You didn&#39;t lose it did you?&quot; Paul sounded a bit worried.<br />
<br />
Jeff instantly went to his pockets. &quot;Right. My key,&quot; a memory of the school principal handing it to him, filled his head, but he couldn&#39;t quite place it. Why would they give a student a key to the gym? He ignored the question. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two hopped into Paul&#39;s jeep and headed back for the school. They parked around near the gym and Jeff pulled out the right key to the door. It almost felt instinctual. Even more so, finding the circuit breakers to turn on the lights in the gym. Jeff could almost count the number of steps he needed and quickly flipped on the switches to only light a little bit of the gym and the weight room. &quot;Ready?&quot; He went back to his keys and pulled out the one specifically for the weight room. Then paused.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Paul looked at him a bit skeptically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Jeff dismissed the thought again. &quot;Let&#39;s just go.&quot; They entered into the large open gym. The strong smell of sweat and musk from men working out mixed with the metal smell of all the weights. Jeff spotted the scale right outside of the coach&#39;s office. &quot;Hey. Let&#39;s see if you&#39;ve gained anymore weight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul rolled his eyes. &quot;Alright coach,&quot; he said mockingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! You&#39;re the one who keeps growing,&quot; Jeff gave him a friendly punch to the arm. Paul rubbed at it, adding to the joke.  &quot;Aww... Poor baby. That hurt?&quot; Paul stepped onto the scale. Jeff quickly rolled the weights on the old machine, starting with the hundreds. He first checked if Paul was up to 300 yet. Not quite, but the way the bar slowly drifted down instead of an instant drop, he knew Paul must be getting close. He pushed the bottom weight back to 200 and then shifted the 10 pound weight down to 280. Still not enough. 290. It didn&#39;t drop completely. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit...&quot; the two said together. A smile was drifting onto Paul&#39;s face as he stared at the number. He was massive. It was impossible to deny. He didn&#39;t even care when Jeff moved the single pound bar up to the 5 mark, finishing his weight at 295. <br />
<br />
Paul stepped off and went over to the mirror to flex. &quot;I&#39;m fucking massive.&quot; He turned to the side and could barely even see a gut sticking out in front of him. He quickly flexed his abs and saw the blocks appear out in front of him. HIs poses changed consistently, showing off each and every one of his massive body parts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Jeff nodded. &quot;Let&#39;s make sure to warm up first. Don&#39;t want you hurting yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing coach,&quot; Paul said. But this time, the word &#39;coach&#39; wasn&#39;t as mocking of a tone. He almost sounded serious. <br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, then pulled at the collar of his shirt. Suddenly, he felt a little awkward. He couldn&#39;t quite describe the feeling running through his body, yet he was even more confused whether or not he liked it. There was a dull heat running through his body. Each of hits muscles could feel it. Sweat started to drip under his arm pits. But he was more distracted by his cock jumping to attention. Just seeing the football stud stretching his massive body was sending all kinds of weird signals from his brain. Jeff couldn&#39;t look away as he saw those muscles move. <br />
<br />
&quot;You feeling alright?&quot; Paul asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Yeah...&quot; Jeff breathed. He was back down to reality, but he could still feel the sweat pouring off him. &quot;I just need to go check on something. You warm up with the free weights. I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing coach.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff let out a heavy breath of air as he stood on the other side of the weight room&#39;s door. He hadn&#39;t realized he was holding his breath. But hearing Paul so earnestly called him coach nearly made him explode. His cock was throbbing, begging for attention. &#39;I can&#39;t... He&#39;s a student. But an 18 year old one,&#39; he reasoned with himself. &quot;What? No! I&#39;m a student too. What the fuck?&quot; Jeff hurried himself away from the weight room and over to the locker room. Something deep inside him was conflicted and he needed some time to think.<br />
<br />
He went into the locker room. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with me?&quot; His body felt like it was on fire. What made it even worse was just how tight his clothes were. His shirt felt like it was clinging to him, making the sweat feel all the more sticky. He pulled at it, trying to make any kind of room. That&#39;s when he heard a rip. &quot;No... No. No. No,&quot; Jeff quickly rushed over to a mirror. <br />
<br />
His eyes went wide as he looked himself over. This wasn&#39;t his body. Not at all. There was all kinds of bulk quickly adding onto his lean soccer frame. Each time he moved, he could see more and more weight adding onto him. But his hands went to his face. Years of work and stress were rapidly taking away his boyish good looks and replacing them with that of a hardened man. Deep crevices formed near his eyes and his skin took on a more rugged appearance.<br />
<br />
The floppy mop of brown of hair on his head was retreating back into his scalp. A ring of hair traced around his ears and back of his head, but it was cut far shorter than the facial hair growing out of his chin and sides of his face. His hands ran through the thick forest of hair growing anywhere on his face other than the top of his head. &quot;N-no!&quot; Jeff cried out. He looked distinctively older. Not someone who was about to graduate high school or even college. His face looked to be at least in his thirties. &quot;What the hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
His muscles spasmed, forcing him to bend over. That&#39;s when they started growing. The lean muscles he had built from soccer were bulging in every direction. They completely filled his shirt, tearing it large holes in it. His biceps pushed hard and rounded out. His flatter chest ballooned out in front of him as two meaty pecs filled their place. The abs that he had worked so hard on, softened into a bit of a belly. Yet, that only seemed to make him look even stronger. It accentuated his thick hips and even thicker quads. Each of those four muscles were bridled with insurmountable power from years and years of working out with the football team and making sure they knew to properly do their squats. <br />
<br />
The pain finally subsided and Jeff was able to get a good look at himself in the mirror. A thick coating hair seemed to cover every portion of his body except for the top of his head. He ran one of his thick hands over his clean scalp. &quot;Shit...&quot; His mind returned to Paul. And with that his dick sprung up. &quot;At least that&#39;s not broken,&quot; he mused. But walking back he saw that the office inside the locker room had his name on it. &#39;Jeff Simmons.&#39; Curiosity got the better of him. <br />
<br />
Also the thought that there might be a spare change of clothes in there. He walked in and found a locker for him. He quickly pulled up the khaki pants and put the school&#39;s polo over his shoulders. It clung tightly to his meaty chest and arms. A mirror lined the wall and he gave himself a once over. A bit of pride filled him as he saw his large muscular bulk fill the school uniform. &quot;Fuck... What&#39;s Paul going to say?&quot;</p>
