<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day, as Adrian went to the park for his lunch break, he couldn&#39;t help but wonder what the powder he&#39;d just bought was. It didn&#39;t feel like it made sense that the employee hadn&#39;t known what it was. If they did all the stocking and he was likely to try just about any of it, it seemed unlikely that he wouldn&#39;t know what the store was selling. However, something else in his brain was telling him that was all stupid. The guy behind the counter was clearly just saying that. It&#39;s not like he could know every product they had. <br />
<br />
Adrian sat on a park bench and pulled out his lunch box. He opened up his water thermos and poured a scoop of the powder into it. He closed it back up and shook it, then took a drink. However, as the liquid touched his lips, he couldn&#39;t stop drinking. Adrian pounded his hands against the bench as he felt the rush of water run down his throat. He couldn&#39;t move his hand. It was getting harder to breath. Luckily he didn&#39;t fill the thermos all the way up.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what the fuck...&quot; Adrian gasped for air. He panted for a few seconds wondering what had happened. However, his heartrate hadn&#39;t slowed down. He gripped at his chest feeling it almost speed up. &quot;What&#39;s--&quot; he grunted before being cut off. A shot of pain spread through him as his body flexed. Veins bulged out of his skin. He nearly fell over from the intensity.<br />
<br />
It stopped for a second. Adrian didn&#39;t know what was going on, but knew he didn&#39;t want to look like he was having a heart attack in the middle of the park. He stood up and started back towards his office. However, as he walked, he couldn&#39;t help but feel the tightness in his dress shirt. The button down was feeling rather tight around his chest and shoulders. This was especially weird because he had been worrying about it getting tight around his waist. At 5&#39;8&quot; and 160ish pounds, he was starting to develop a bit of a belly. It came mostly with just age and a slowing metabolism. That&#39;s why he was going to start working out.<br />
<br />
Though, this was weird. He felt the top button of his shirt start pulling and straining against his neck. He reached up to unbutton it, but then his sleeves started to feel weird. They no longer ended comfortably around his wrists, rather they were pulling up against his forearms. Looking down Adrian felt a sense of dread. His shirt was pulling tightly over a frame that he didn&#39;t quite recognize.<br />
<br />
Pecs had started to form under his shirt. They pushed at the now straining buttons of his work shirt. The buttons looked like they were barely holding on as more and more tension from the rapidly growing muscles were putting far more strain they they should have had. Adrian went to unbutton them, but heard a loud rip of his shirt as his arms pulled the sleeves off at the seams. His arms were filling them completely.<br />
<br />
Adrian staggered as he continued to try to walk forward. He didn&#39;t understand why it was so hard. It mostly came from his growing height. He&#39;d already grown past 6&#39; and was nearing 6&#39;2&quot;. Each step seemed to put another inch on his height. The strain of his clothes grew more apparent as the bottom of his black pants rode up his legs. Even his feet were having trouble in the black dress shoes. What had always been a bit uncomfortable was absolutely unbearable as his feet grew nearly a half dozen sizes too large for their confines. They burst through the hard leather completely destroying what remained of the shoe. <br />
<br />
Panic set in faster as more rips and tears filled Adrian&#39;s ears. Different parts of his clothes were ripping faster, showing off more and more of his growing muscular body. What most people would have been proud of the hard defined muscles, Adrian was terrified and unsure. They just kept growing bigger and bigger. First starting out as looking fairly lean toned and athletic, then doubling in size to put bodybuilders to shame. Even as he stretched and grew to 6&#39;6&quot; he still had the absolute powerful look of a bodybuilder as his muscles bulged with an obvious power and strength. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what the hell?&quot; everything around him looked so much smaller now. Even as the end of the growth happened and he finished growing to 6&#39;8&quot;, he couldn&#39;t help but wonder what happened. He flexed his arm watching the massive muscle bulge. What most guys would have been happy with was 20&quot; however, with how tall he was, he almost wondered if it was closer to 25&quot;. His entire body bulged and swelled. Adrian easily weighed in the 350&#39;s if not rapidly approaching the 400&#39;s. However, every bit of him was lean and defined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh--Oh shit!&quot; he quickly tried to cover himself. His nude body was on full display in the public and worst of all, he was hard.</p>
