<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily pondered for a while. The kind of money she would need to pay for this costume would be a serious cut out of her checkbook, one that would take her a long time to pay off. Especially worrying was when she considered that she could have trouble finding work as a robot. Thus, she figured that getting a job here would be the safest option, but she didn’t want to have to wait a month to go out in public as a robot. <br />
Then she thought about the transformation details. She loved robots, being a huge fan of stuff like Robocop, that was the main reason she wanted to get this robosuit and become one. Emily wanted to go all the way. If she was going to become robotic, it was going to be all the way: she was going to become a full-fledged machine. On the other hand, as far as appearance went, she thought that the mask and hair might be overkill. In the end, she decided to ask questions before finalizing her choice. <br />
“Ma’am, what will the pay be for working here? And what about the hours?” <br />
“The starting pay will be $50 an hour. I know that may seem suspiciously high but if you look at the price tag of the suit I’m sure you’ll see why we feel it necessary to offer such a generous starting salary, given that the suit costs $30,000. Now, again, I know that you’re probably feeling like only making $400 in wages a day with all of it going to the cost of your suit may seem like a complete rip-off at first, but remember, as a robot, you won’t need things like food, water, sleep, medication, or even really clothes. Even as a cyborg, those needs will be significantly reduced. That will eliminate a significant portion of your expenditures already. However, it will of course come with other needs, like charging, regular and irregular maintenance, and of course, cleaning, though more like cleaning a car than cleaning a person, since you will physically be more akin to a car than a human. You will be able to do all of this in the store if you need to, and the suit comes with all the equipment you need to wash yourself, perform maintenance, and of course charge, so you’ll be able to take care of yourself at home and here. It’s also worth mentioning that the equipment I mentioned is free with the suit. We’ll also cover your bills until you pay off the suit, at no interest to you. Also something I should go over is tips. You keep 100% of every tip you get, and it is fully your choice how to spend them, whether it be putting more money towards the cost of your robotization or spending it on yourself. We’ll essentially cover all your needs, bills, and even potentially some “unnecessary” things like game consoles or upgrades to your body if you do a really good job. Once you’re done paying off the suit, not only will you most likely have received a promotion by then, but your pay will be increased to $75 an hour, and while we will no longer cover your bills like water or paying off your house, we will still provide for you.” <br />
“Wow, that’s a really sweet gig! I’m sold! I want the job! How does 8-5 sound?” <br />
“The store opens at 8, and we need you around to help before then. How about 7-5? You’ll also get paid your full wages if you choose to work overtime.” <br />
“Deal! Now as for the head, what happens to my face and hair if I decide to become a full robot but leave my face and hair uncovered by the helmet?” <br />
“Your skin will be turned into shiny plastic, with almost the skin complexion of a Barbie doll. Your hair will likewise be turned into plastic, and it will no longer move like hair but instead stay in exactly that shape. As for the rest of your head, your back head below your hair, including your ears, will be covered by the remaining portion of the helmet, meaning that the back will be metal and you will have the ear covers instead of human ears. The inside of your mouth will also become plastic, with your voice coming out of a speaker in the back of your throat, and your mouth will move to create the illusion of speaking like a normal human.” <br />
“Sounds awesome! I love the idea of my face looking almost toy-like, but still human in appearance. I know what I want.” <br />
“And what is it?” <br />
“I want to have my face and hair uncovered, and I want to become a robot.” <br />
“You understand what this means, correct? You want to become a machine? To willingly give up your humanity and be transformed into a robot? You understand that once you put on that suit, there is no going back? If you end up regretting this decision, you’ll be stuck as a mechanical woman until you get decommissioned.” <br />
“I understand completely. I know what I want. I want to be a machine. Being a human is fine, but I… can’t fully explain what it is. I’m Christian, I’m not afraid of dying, I believe in Heaven and I hope I’ll get there someday. It’s not that I want to be a robot because I’m afraid of dying. I’m very proud of my personality and who I am, it’s not like I want to become some soulless robot with no emotions that just obeys its programming mindlessly. I’ve never wanted to be that kind of robot. But something about robots fascinates me, especially feminine ones, though that’s because I can most easily see myself as them. I’ve never been very interested in sex, and personally I think that over-sexualization is gross, so the idea of having this sort of more conservative (but still feminine) robot body without being able to have sex really does entice me. I just can’t help but feel giddy at the idea of charging. I’m enamored with the prospect of walking around, my gears clicking, motors whirring, feet clanging on the ground, and my metal body shining in the light. And perhaps most importantly, I love the idea of being able to help others for decades, if not centuries after my organic body would have started slowing down. Please. I’m ready. Make me into a robot.” <br />
The woman smiled. “You seem like just the kind of girl who should have this. I have no doubt that you’ll be a better robot than any other other, since you are already such a wonderful person. Now, please sign here.” She produced a set of documents. Emily did read them all very carefully, but saw that everything was as the woman had said. She signed all the papers, and prepared herself. “Let’s go to the dressing room. Follow me.” <br />
Emily followed the woman, who wheeled the suit into a large room with a small podium in the middle, a little larger than a person, surrounded by mirrors. Emily’s excitement could hardly be contained as she saw the woman disassemble the suit. Emily was about to start putting on the pieces when the woman said, “Wait. First you need to take off all your clothes. This will fit you very tightly.” Emily did so, and the woman directed her to stand on the podium. Emily did so, eagerly awaiting her suiting so that she could cover and replace her skin with metal. <br />
First, the woman helped Emily squeeze her legs into the robot boots, before she put on the thigh pieces. Then came the waist, followed by the abdomen. The back plate clicked into place as the breastplate hugged her chest tightly. Next, her upper arms were fitted into their robot versions, followed by the forearms, and then the hands. The woman hesitated for a bit. “Are you sure you want this? This is your last chance, then your transformation will begin and it cannot be canceled or reversed.” <br />
Emily looked at her metal hands, and then the rest of her body. She looked immaculate. This was exactly what she wanted. She decided to make her final words a reflection of what she was about to become. “Affirmative. Finalize procedure.” The woman attached the neck piece, and finally, the helmet minus the face and hair. “Initiate conversion.” <br />
The woman, satisfied that Emily was ready for this, said, “Prepare for robotization.” <br />
It did not take long for her body to begin changing. Her feet and legs lost all feeling as they became robotic, with her arms following suit. Her torso then began to be transformed, with all her insides becoming mechanical. After her neck became robotic, she felt the inside of her head change. Everything became robotic, her eyes becoming cameras with lenses in her pupils, changing the color of her irises to blue, like the numerous lights coming on across her body. Her brain was converted into a magical supercomputer capable of replicating her brain functions and keeping all of her consciousness intact, and her skin and hair hardened into plastic. Finally, Emily’s tranformation was finished, and she said, “Conversion complete. Emily-01 online and standing by. Beginning reboot process.” The robot girl slumped over for a moment and the lights on her body went out before Emily finally booted up and the lights came back on as her new life began.</p>
