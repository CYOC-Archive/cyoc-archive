<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad stared at his reflection. His body was so different! While he was no hulk, his body had nonetheless changed dramatically and for the better. Previously, he had been achingly thin; his flat, shallow abs more a matter of low body fat, rather than abdominal musculature, his limbs long and thin, his muscles firm but lacking heft. It was a body built to run for miles without tiring, a body that had jettisoned counterproductive extra weight in the pursuit of a singular goal: to run the furthest the fastest. Quite simply, Brad had been a superbly efficient, long-distance-running machine. <br />
<br />
And then, that light, efficient body had changed. The thin limbs became more substantial, the muscle that ran along the bones becoming thicker and firmer, the separations between muscles more noticeable. His abs were more prominent, modestly rounded little cobblestones of muscle under his thin skin, rather than the flat affair his abs had been before. His chest, to his mind, was the most dramatic improvement. Previously, it had been an all but featureless area of pale flesh, the monotony of it interrupted only by his nipples. Now, it was two well-defined expanses of pectoral muscle, split by a noticeable separation along Brad’s sternum. He brought up one arm and slowly flexed, watching not only as the bicep rose, but also as his delts and pec moved, the muscle fibers seeming to slide under his skin. “Amazing,” he breathed. <br />
<br />
Brad’s cock ached, as hard as the muscles that he admired in his reflection. He resisted the urge to touch it; Janet would be by soon, after all. <br />
<br />
Five minutes later though, he had a new text from her, and it wasn’t good: [Babe, this sucks, but work just called and they need me to pitch in for a couple hours, somebody is out sick.] <br />
<br />
The message was followed by a string of emojis, most of them involving crying. <br />
<br />
Brad wrote back: [Damn babe, that sucks.] He paused, then added another response: [Maybe I’ll hit the gym then. Meet me there when you’re done?]<br />
<br />
[Sounds great! Get all pumped for me, babe!] Janet sent in reply. <br />
<br />
Brad sighed, looking down at the tent in his underwear. It seemed to look back at him, inquiring what he was going to do about its distressed state. Growling, he shoved it down and stomped over to his dresser, pulling out some gym shorts and an old tee shirt. His mocking boner tented his underwear as he slipped on his gym gear. The shirt no longer hung loosely off of his thin frame, his shoulders filling it out properly at last. The gym shorts molded against his rounded glutes as he pulled them on. He adjusted his tented crotch, tied off the drawstring, then went to find socks and shoes. <br />
<br />
As usual, Brad ran to the gym. The three-mile distance wasn’t quite as effortless as usual, but it was still fairly easy, and he maintained a seven-minute pace without too much trouble. Luckily, by the time he arrived his erection had settled down into a semi-flaccid state. It would have to do. Brad entered the gym, checked in with his phone, and then headed out to the floor. <br />
<br />
His workout was a revelation. His body was stronger; that was obvious from his new muscles. Every single lift was easier, and he added a healthy amount of weight to every one. But the biggest surprise was his new state of mind. While he hadn’t been a stranger in the gym, he hadn’t exactly been a regular either; too much of his time had been spent on long runs. Suddenly, the gym was familiar territory. Brad knew every piece of equipment, he realized. He knew the weight plates by sight—the difference between 45 pounds and 35 was obvious to him from even a modest distance. <br />
<br />
As he performed each exercise, Brad noticed that his form was improving. Sometimes it was major improvements, such as avoiding momentum that would “cheat” a lift. Sometimes it was more subtle changes, like wrist positioning when performing skull crushers with an ez bar. Not only was Brad lifting more weight, he was lifting it properly; for several exercises, it was the first time he’d ever done them the right way. The fact that he even had the knowledge necessary to notice the difference was astounding in and of itself. <br />
<br />
Although Brad knew about workout splits and the need for rest and all the rest, on his first day he went all out anyway, too excited to limit his workout to only some muscle groups. What should have been a one-hour workout became two, and he only stopped when he received a text from Janet, letting him know that she was outside. <br />
<br />
Brad rushed through some cooldown stretching, then headed out to the lot, looking for Janet’s car. He saw her sitting in the driver’s seat, idly scrolling on her phone, passing the time as she waited. Brad walked right up to her and tapped on the window. <br />
<br />
Janet let out a squeak of alarm at the sound, her head whipping around to look at who was there. She scowled as she saw Brad’s grinning mug in place, and she rolled down her window. “That wasn’t funny, buster!” she began to chide, but her voice trailed off as she got a good look at him, the shirt plastered to his sweaty body, showing off the contoured muscles beneath. “Oh. My. GOD!” she squealed, “It’s real! Is it real?” A shaking hand stretched out and she reached for one of Brad’s pumped pecs. Her fingers sunk into the slab of wet-shirt-covered flesh. In response, he flexed, her fingertips pushed back, the muscle shifting under the sweaty shirt. “Fuck Brad,” Janet breathed, a hint of a moan in her voice, “Get in already! I need to get you home! And into the shower!” <br />
<br />
Brad laughed and walked around to the passenger side of the car, pulled off his wet shirt, and got in the front seat. He was still fumbling with his seat belt when Janet took off, taking them backwards out of the spot, then forward, heading for the parking lot exit. “Easy, babe!” Brad laughed as they pulled out into the street, tires screeching as Janet accelerated into the turn, “It would be a shame for us to wind up all mangled.” <br />
<br />
Janet took a breath and slowed a little, but the frustration was evident. At every red light, her fingers drummed on the steering wheel, clearly impatient. At a particularly long red, Brad leaned over and kissed her cheek. The drumming stopped, her hands gripping the wheel, knuckles white. She turned to look at him. His handsome face rising above an athletic body. He shifted, and so did his deltoids, under the skin. Her breath quickened. He was so…<br />
<br />
Behind them, a car honked. Janet froze, then whipped around to face forward and see that the light was green. In a split-second decision, she made a right turn, heading down a side street. <br />
<br />
“Babe? Where are we going?” Brad asked, confused by the change. <br />
<br />
“Behind the store where I used to work. They shut down a few months ago. And I can’t wait anymore!” she replied, turning off the road and taking them behind the boarded-up store where she had worked one summer in high school. The area was quiet and out of sight. “Brad, I can’t wait any longer!” Janet exhaled, taking off her seatbelt and turning to face him. <br />
<br />
Brad took off his own seat belt and within moments they were kissing and making out, Janet’s hands roaming his damp skin. Even though his muscles weren’t huge, they were firm and defined, as well as larger than before; certainly, Janet liked Brad’s new body much more than his old one! <br />
<br />
It wasn’t long before clothes were shed and seats were flipped back as Brad and Janet’s mutual appreciation kicked into a higher gear. His erection had returned, with gusto, and Janet eagerly teased it with her fingers while her lips and tongue roamed the new muscles of his upper body. She guided him onto his back and then straddled him, running her hands over his chest and shoulders before lowering herself onto his trembling cock and beginning to slowly ride it. <br />
<br />
Brad’s tool had been eager for action all day, only to be denied, over and over. Finally, it had the relief of Janet’s pussy, enveloping it, warm and wet and tight. And that was when it exacted revenge on Brad, ejaculating a minute into their passion. He gasped loudly, then took deep breaths as he came, his treacherous penis happily pumping a load into his girlfriend. <br />
<br />
“Wow. Already?” Janet asked, disappointment obvious in her voice, as she stopped her movements, feeling his dick spasm inside her. As the tremors subsided, she regretfully dismounted and slid into the seat next to him. <br />
<br />
Brad didn’t respond. He looked over at Janet. This was supposed to be the best sex they’d ever had! He took in the curves of her body, her ripe breasts and the hard nipples that capped them. He wasn’t going to give up that easily. <br />
<br />
It was awkward due to the cramped confines inside the car, but Brad shifted position and moved until he was looming over Janet, his strong arms and chest holding him above her as he leaned in to plant a kiss on her lips. More kisses followed and his dick, which had never gone soft, regained its full hardness. He adjusted his position so that his chest and shoulders were right in front of Janet’s face and his dick nuzzled against the outside of her pussy. <br />
<br />
“Wow! Already!” Janet gasped, repeating her previous statement, but with a voice filled with wonder as she felt Brad’s rod enter her a second time. <br />
<br />
“You didn’t think I was going to leave you high and dry, did you?” Brad rumbled, slowly pushing forward into her, pulling back, then going forward again, thrusting his dick with slow, controlled movements. “I’ve been jonesing for you all day, babe!” <br />
<br />
Janet moaned in response. She ran her hands over Brad’s chest and shoulders, feeling the tense muscles that kept him suspended over her. Her fingers reached out to caress his tight arms, which held his upper body still while his lower body focused on thrusting. “More!” she demanded, reaching up and gripping his lats, trying to pull him down onto her. <br />
<br />
Brad slowly lowered himself onto Janet, making her gasp as she felt his new weight settle atop her. She wrapped her arms around his torso, her hands feeling up his muscular back and traps as he thrust into her. Those thrusts became stronger, surer, as he repositioned himself more advantageously. Janet’s gasps of pleasure let him know he was on the right track. He redoubled his efforts, slamming his dick into his girlfriend, her cries of ecstasy and the claws on his back letting him know that finally, she was getting the kind of fuck that she craved. <br />
<br />
Brad’s second round seemed to last forever. By the time they were both satisfied, he’d had a couple more orgasms, while Janet had lost count of her own, having surrendered to the pleasure of being fucked by Brad’s improved body. <br />
<br />
Once they recovered and got dressed, Brad offered to drive. Janet gratefully agreed, her legs a bit wobbly from being thoroughly railed. As Brad led them back onto the streets, Janet leaned over and put her head on his shoulder, keeping it there until they got to her home. <br />
<br />
“You need a shower, mister,” she observed, her voice playful as she scrunched up her nose to imitate sniffing as they walked in the door. <br />
<br />
“Only if you’ll wash my back, babe,” Brad replied with a grin, “I don’t think I can reach all of it anymore.” <br />
<br />
“That’s not all I’ll wash, stud,” she purred, pulling him in for a kiss as she shut the door behind them.</p>
