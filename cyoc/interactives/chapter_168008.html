<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ginger had pulled on white satin panties and a bra. She sat on a bed looking at her toned stomach. She wore one of Kal&#39;s white formal shirts. She had stolen some white stockings. These clothes she had stolen either from the store, had seduced a man to do the stealing or had stolen them from a backyard that had a clothes line. Carl would have commented that her clothes were an odd fit. This was why. <br />
<br />
Thankfully as a woman Ginger didn&#39;t need a glasses. She turned into a young woman however she knew that dogs aged and died more quickly than humans. As her canine mind understood the old idea of dog years. However she knew that only a 3 year old bitch she was young. But would being turned back into a dog shorten her lifespan? Her did time spent as a woman increase her lifespan.<br />
<br />
Was she like the humans who could turn into animals in Harry Potter? Did her transformations mean that she would outlive the average female bitch? Would Mark have an Irish Setter forever 3, or would she age inline with her canine self. <br />
<br />
She had saved up some money as a stripper. She was club favorite and she remembered the struggle trying to find a name. Speaking to the manager she had said her &#39;Ginger&#39;, she was told there was another redhead who called Ginger. She tried Scarlett, also taken. Blame the Avengers movies. Finally she reached for the stage name &#39;Blaze&#39;, too morbid. <br />
<br />
&quot;Katy?&quot;, they had a Katy but she had gotten married, most of the girls were married or engaged, and she had quit. So she was Ginger in her daily life and a stripper named &#39;Katy&#39; at nights. The woman manager had Ginger walk up and down the stage in a cheap bra and panties. She had watched clips online and knew what men wanted. There was the issue of the dog collar around her neck, she told the manager it would give men a hard on and it was the only item she would ever wear.<br />
<br />
The manager then said that she could take her bra off when she was ready. She took all her clothes off and walked up and down as if she owned the stage. Her main competition was a  five foot five DD chested woman who came from some part of Russia. Her hair was dyed red, &#39;Katy&#39; with her canine nose could smell the chemicals. Even through the smoke, booze and body odor of the club. &#39;Ginger&#39;, real name Sophie, was about a head shorter than &#39;Katy&#39;.<br />
<br />
&#39;Katy&#39; was a real red haired vixen with a statuesque beauty that put the smaller and rounder &#39;Ginger&#39; to shame. They got into a cat fight, but &#39;Ginger&#39; didn&#39;t know she was fighting a dog. When she tried to remove &#39;Katy&#39;s&#39; dog collar it was a violent attack. The width of the collar was the thing keeping her a woman. The next night &#39;Katy&#39; slipped a crushed amount of Valium into ole &quot;Ginger&#39;s&#39; white vodka making her tipsy. Once in the bathroom, their breasts pressing she found that &#39;Ginger&#39; was bisexual, the hitting on her was sexual.<br />
<br />
&#39;Katy&#39; laughed. &#39;I&#39;ve got a real toy for you.&#39; Ginger/Sophie bent over exposing her ass to &#39;Katy&#39;, she produced the cursed dildo and attacked it to a belt to make it a strap on. Then she grunted and slipped it into her vagina. Ginger yelped The next day I woke to the sound of a buzzing alarm. Walking sleepily to the bathroom to get changed, I gave a whimper when I saw the face in that mirror. Her eyes were dog eyes.<br />
<br />
Her iris was a light ring of brown surrounded by a huge black pupil. &quot;Oh no,&quot; the words escaped from Sophie&#39;s mouth, along with a whimper. &quot;Oh no,&quot; The &#39;oh&#39; sound out into a long whine.  Her two canine teeth had grown large -- like a dog&#39;s. A whimper escaped her mouth, as tears ran down her face.  &quot;Katy,&quot; She said, her voice muffled by the new teeth, &quot;WHat is happening to me?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
She found her nails growing pointed and the same color as her dull brown eyes. All of a sudden, a now splitting around her buttocks, to allow a thick, brown tail to emerge. <br />
<br />
Above her overinflated breasts chest had grown a thick mat of brown hair. She took a look at her hands, they had grown a slight film of hair on top. Sophie&#39;s feet had grown a slight mat of hair on the arches. Her hands had become stiff and clawed. Looking in the mirror, a whimper escaped her lips, and dull yellow fluid trickled down her legs, dripping on the floor. She had changed again.<br />
<br />
Her human ears had disappeared, being replaced by smooth skin where her ears once stood. In place of Sophie&#39;s human ears, two gentle pointed ears had grown on the top of my head. There was a slight tuft of white hair in each of the ears themselves. Brown hair had spread not only around her ankles and wrists, but all over her hands, too. She also had grown a nice little crop of brown hair all over her breasts and stomach. <br />
<br />
She felt her buttocks, they had spouted hair all over them -- a very thick mat -- and that that mat had spread down her legs to cover them. Her had grown a bunch of hair, now practically covered by it. <br />
<br />
Her button nose and mouth was bulging -- about half of a dog&#39;s snout. She tried to stand up and pull the dildo out. About halfway there, I tripped on a stair, and fell down onto the floor, her furry naked body twisting and turning to get a hold. She got to her hands and knees, and tried to get up. Sophie couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t paralyzed but as she shuffled her body around she was panting and fogging up the mirror, but even through the fog she could see that hair was covering my back. Panting, her tongue hanging out of her mouth, she used my elbows to walk around as &#39;Katy&#39; kept pumping the strap on into her vagina. She took a look at her dangling breasts. They were shortening. <br />
<br />
Her legs felt strange, too -- and they were shortening as well! Her arms were completely hairy.  Her hair fell off, and her nose and mouth grew forward into a full dog snout. A small black nose formed at the tip of the snout, and her tongue elongated. Sophie&#39;s hands and feet became paws. With a mighty yelp, she took a look at her breasts. They had gone. My hands and feet had become a dog&#39;s hands and feet.<br />
<br />
She was a dog. Specifically a Siberian Husky. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am a witch&quot; breathed Ginger &quot;fuck with me again and I will leave you as a dog, do you understand you Russian whore?&quot;<br />
<br />
The dog whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ginger pulled out the dildo and the fake redhead fled back to Moscow or wherever. After that she did both her shifts and the disappeared Russian&#39;s. She soon had plenty of money. The manager didn&#39;t like the dog collar but the clients liked it and something told her that she shouldn&#39;t mess with the new Ginger. She dropped the name Katy and became the real Ginger, the clients loved her. Here she learnt how to be a woman in a man&#39;s world.<br />
<br />
The dildo only worked when inside the target but it was enough to break nearly everyone she had to fight. Now she walked the stage as the sole redhead, acting like a Queen who ruled these men. When ever she spoke to them, the manager noted she spoke very little, they felt like a real life angel had taken time to speak to them. But she had no social security number, no license and no birth certificate.</p>
