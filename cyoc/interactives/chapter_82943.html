<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan had to grit her teeth and ignore a lot of pain, but she had the strength for a pushup. Hard to say if it was enough for what she needed to <br />
do next, but it was promising. Under normal circumstances, she would never consider the risk, but the one thing that had kept her sane and <br />
maintained that glimmer of hope was knowing that she'd have her own body back when this was over. Sure, that bastard had taken an eye, <br />
broken her legs, snapped her fingers, and inflicted dozens of other injuries to get his sick thrills, but if she could get out of this hole, that <br />
would all go away.<br />
<br />
She tried standing, and almost immediately collapsed. The breaks in her legs had had time to heal up a bit, but they'd set wrong. If she put too <br />
much pressure on them, she'd end up even worse off than when that damn Wolverine first attacked. She repeated her mantra. Pain is freedom. <br />
Light is salvation. It sounded a little too religious for her taste, but then if this didn't work, it might be time to try embracing some faith <br />
anyway.<br />
<br />
She still couldn't believe she'd gotten into this. She'd opted to attend the park as a bear to get some rest. The pressure at work was really <br />
getting to her, and she couldn't relax at home with the kids bothering her. Just a nice relaxing stretch as a bear, resting lazily in a cave, at the <br />
time it sounded perfect. It was too, right up until that maniac had smashed her up and forced her through that narrow crack...<br />
<br />
She'd lost weight since then. He was only feeding her enough to keep her alive. Not so great when it came to retaining muscle mass, but the <br />
trip back out wouldn't be nearly as tight a squeeze. Her arms would matter more than her legs for this. All she needed her legs for was <br />
reaching the crack. She tried standing again. Wobbly, but if she was careful, she could manage. She felt along to ceiling, trying to find the lip in <br />
the dark. There it was. She let herself rest some more. Higher than she'd hoped. She'd have to leap a little to get a good grip. That was going to <br />
hurt. She had to ready herself for that, make sure she didn't lose her grip from the pain. She rubbed her shoulder for luck. She was pretty sure <br />
her arms were up for this. One had been dislocated not long ago, but she could push herself off the floor, and they were still stronger than <br />
what she had as a human...<br />
<br />
She ran through the whole plan one more time. She'd leap to the hole, and catch a handhold. That would be it for her legs, and it would be up <br />
to her arms. She'd have to pull herself up, at least to the waist. From there she could rest a little, just enough to get her strength back. A bit <br />
more crawling and she'd be in the main part of the cave. She had to have been missing long enough to be missed. They'd be combing the hills, <br />
wouldn't they? If she could just get outside, be seen, it would all be over. Even if he came back early, from up there she could scream. The <br />
acoustics would carry it, right?<br />
<br />
One last time, she carefully pulled herself up. She confirmed her target, crouched down, and leapt...<br />
<br />

<br />
Katie was eager to go looking for Harry, but this needed dealing with first. As she saw how many does were approaching the Stags camp, she <br />
shook her head in disbelief. Which one was Chad? Not one had the same arrogant stride in her step. That one she was half tempted to just let <br />
pass, but her reputation was at stake here. What on earth would possess people to put themselves in this position anyway? &quot;I wouldn't go this <br />
way if I were you,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back off bitch! There's a backstabbing loser in that clearing who's getting a piece of my mind!&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, that answered that. &quot;Let me spell this out for you, because clearly, it hasn't sunk in. Behind me, there is a large number of bucks, hopped <br />
up on extra testosterone and adrenaline. They have been spending their whole morning trying to impress what few does they can find, and as <br />
your little incident caused them to break things off early, they have a lot of pent up energy I am sure they are hoping to burn off somehow. <br />
'Your mind' is not what you are going to end up 'giving a piece of' to any of them. Are you getting the picture here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie was a little shocked to see how they reacted. She'd expected cringing, but this was more squirming. One or two were even licking their <br />
lips, not that they seemed consciously aware of it. Even so...<br />
<br />
&quot;Today has been enough of a fiasco without that on my conscience. If you want to come back here tomorrow where there's enough of us <br />
around to keep an eye on things, that's your business, but for now, you've only got three options. You can head back that way, where the new <br />
TGs tend to gather, and get some lessons you all clearly need. You can head that way, get to know the rest of the deer in the park, maybe <br />
apologize for how you've been treating them. Or, if you really want to have a safe evening, you can follow me back to the station, and we can <br />
find you all a chaperone to keep you from getting yourselves in any trouble. Pick one, and let's go!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a bit of hesitation, but eventually the does began to disperse. If any objected to her authority, they certainly were keeping quiet <br />
about it.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Max headed up higher into the hills. Rarely did any of the guests come up here. Maybe if goats were a more popular choice they might, but as <br />
it stood, he had things largely to himself. The wind blew downward here. It would carry his scent to whoever was after him, but that was <br />
alright. Clearly he was leaving today anyway. He might have to leave his toy alive, but if he had a little fun with one of the huskies, the rest <br />
would be too busy dealing with the mess to notice when he climbed over the wall. He had a perfectly clear view of anyone approaching from up <br />
this way, and a fun surprise or two ready to set off for just this situation.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Goldie returned to base, hoping to find Zack or Harry to give her new orders, but instead finding only the twins. After making sure they'd been <br />
informed of the circumstances under which the security detail had been cut short for the day, she stood at attention, asking if she could be of <br />
any further use.<br />
<br />
The twins sighed, in unison of course. &quot;Look Goldie. Harry's been busy all day. First there was a phone call from Naomi checking in on things, <br />
and then someone from management called him in for a meeting about something, so he's going to be busy for a while.&quot;<br />
&quot;And Zack's busy with something else today, with plans to meet up with us later tonight. Things seem to pretty much be under control today, <br />
so you may as well take a break.&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldie was a bit disappointed. She was already feeling a bit guilty that she had let herself get distracted when there was a disruption before. <br />
&quot;Ma'ams, I'd be happy to volunteer for any extra duties you might be able to think of, ma'ams!&quot;<br />
<br />
The twins rolled their eyes. &quot;You realize there's such a thing as being too helpful, don't you?&quot; Goldie gave a worried look. &quot;You're relieved of <br />
duty for the rest of the day.&quot; Her tail curled between her legs with a bit of a whimper.&quot; &quot;OK how about this? We order you to go relax. Now <br />
shoo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldie wandered away, feeling rejected and trying to work out what she'd done wrong, to find Sam waiting outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi again! Busy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Not at all. Is there a problem somewhere?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam chuckled. &quot;Nothing like that. I just thought we could take a walk. Come on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldie's tail started to wag. He wanted to take her out on patrol? Eagerly, she trotted over, to follow where ever he went. Wait, why was it she <br />
cared so much about Sam's approval? She was having such a hard time focusing... and wait, he was putting an arm around her shoulder? Did <br />
she look so down she needed cheering up? Was he upset? Had he hurt his leg? She wrapped an arm back around him in case he needed the <br />
extra support, but no, he was walking fine... why was it so hard to stay focused today? She had no reason to be so nervous... and there was <br />
something she'd wanted to talk to him about. Combat training? She pictured him wrestling her to the ground and... no no! She had to clear up <br />
that whole thing about him being attracted to her, that was it.  &quot;Sam?&quot; she asked...<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Wally wasn't focusing very well either. This Katerina here was a lot closer to how she'd expected to find Terry. Calm and confident, confronting <br />
her like this. Not that... sex-crazed monster. If he'd found Terry like this, he might even have to try things out like this. Especially if she was <br />
doing what Katerina was doing now. Running her finger down her body, and reaching up to stroke his ear. You know what? He thought. He <br />
ought to do it. If there were anything left of Terry in there, and she saw him cheating on her, maybe that would snap her out of this. Before he <br />
even realized what he was doing, he had his arms around Katerina, her back pressed up to the nearest tree. But could he really do this? Would <br />
he just get sucked into all this like her? Well... he was a man at the moment. They didn't want to stick around afterwards, wasn't that the old <br />
joke? Just once to see what it's like, then he'd march back out, back to normal, and... get a court order or something.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Agent Sherman pulled the car up to the park. This wasn't exactly the sort of place she'd ever expected to come. A bunch of freaks and deviants <br />
as far as she was concerned. Her partner Johnson had seemed excited to come. She had to wonder about him sometimes.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how do you this is going to play out? We going to be walking out of here with a fox in handcuffs or something like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something like that. Look, it's fine by me if you want to come back here the next time you're on vacation, but for now can you handle yourself <br />
like a professional? This guy tortured  five people to death in Tennessee, evaded arrest with and dropped off everyone's radar for a year before <br />
we tracked him here, and that was before getting a new face. We aren't going to get more than one shot at bringing him in, and somehow this <br />
place has worked out a deal that bans state law enforcement from the grounds. We're going to be dealing with an incredibly dangerous <br />
suspect, in what is essentially a stretch of open wilderness, with no armed backup. And that's not even getting into the problem of everyone <br />
inside being one of those transformed freaks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better get that out of your system now. I doubt they're going to want to cooperate if you don't think of something else to call them.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Zack was onto the scent now, tracking Max high up into the hills. He was having to navigate by scent thanks to the angle of the sun, but at <br />
least he had the wind on his side. He'd been hoping this would be simple, but now he was really wishing he'd brought some backup. Still, it was <br />
just one guy. Wolverine or not he'd be able to handle him in a straight-up fight if it really came to it.<br />
<br />
That was when he heard the rockslide.</p>
