<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joanna left the bathroom and moved back to the food court. Her mom stood by the table where they’d eaten, looking down on those around her with a wicked smile. She looked… excited? But Joanna couldn’t think of why that would be. Her mom had always towered over everyone around her, with all of her seven feet of height. Joanna wished she’d inherited some of her mother’s genes, but sadly it seemed like she’d stopped growing while still a foot and a half short of her mom.<br />
<br />
“Finally back? What took you so long?”<br />
<br />
The last thing Joanna wanted to do was relate the story of what happened in the bathroom, but despite herself the story was pushed out of her throat and through her fat lips.<br />
<br />
“I had to take my dildo out to pee, and then I had a ton of trouble getting it back in. I didn’t mean to, but I accidentally orgasmed in front of some other girls, who caught the whole thing with their phones. I even tripped on the way out, and accidentally flashed them. Can we just go get some stuff for my hair, and then go home? At this rate, I’m going to end up plastered all over the internet.”<br />
<br />
“You’re the one who got your body into this position, so it seems pretty unfair for you to get upset when other people gawk at what you’ve become.”<br />
<br />
“But mom-”<br />
<br />
“No buts. Well, except the obvious one.” She gestured to Joanna’s huge behind. “If you don’t like people staring, I suppose I better help you get used to it.”<br />
<br />
“No, mom!” But it was too late, she was already tapping away at her phone, and just a second later, she held it out for Joanna to see.<br />
<br />
The phone was displaying something called “Joanna’s World.” It was styled almost like a blog, with rows of image posts and text. She only got a glance before her mom pulled the phone away. “I really shouldn’t trust you with this, should I? Look at your own phone.”<br />
<br />
Joanna pulled out her own phone, and saw a new app installed with the letters “JW.” She opened it, and was met with the same style of entries, and recognized her new body in the pictures. One was a video post, and she didn’t need to hit play to see that it was the video of her in the bathroom. Scrolling back, she found videos and pictures of her licking her tits clean at the food court. There were also posts from all kinds of people who had snapped pics of her walking around the mall. It was like anyone who had seen her knew to capture pictures and videos of her ridiculous body and post them right here.<br />
<br />
But the worst part was the view counter. Looking at the video of her accidental masturbation session, it looked like the view count was going up by thousands every second, and it was just a few minutes old! Some of the pictures from earlier in the day were already in the millions! A pit in her stomach, she clicked on the bathroom post to read the comments.<br />
<br />
“Lmao slut,” “Looks like she could use some help, if you know what I mean,” “My boyfriend and I have been laughing at this for a solid minute,” “what a dumbass,” “how is she so fat”<br />
<br />
Just then, she got a notification in the corner of the app, and tapped it to open it. It looked like some kind of tagged post from… her mother? It was a picture of Joanna from behind, on her way to the bathroom, with a caption of text. She scrolled to read it.<br />
<br />
“It’s been a tough day for me today at the mall. As everyone knows, Joanna can barely control herself, and I’ve been deeply embarrassed several times. This is her on her way to the bathroom, and by now I’m sure you’ve all seen what happened next. I do my best as a mother, but every day I’m pushed to my limits by my disgusting cow of a daughter.”<br />
<br />
Again, comments were already streaming in. “You’re too good to her,” “Stay Strong!” “You should really teach her a lesson.”<br />
<br />
“There,” her mom explained, “Now everyone is keyed into you on your own social media app based entirely around you. Anyone who sees you in public can get pictures or videos, and post them here for the enjoyment of everyone else! And don’t worry, when no one is around at home, I can be sure to provide plenty of pictures for everyone.”<br />
<br />
Joanna scrolled through the feed in horror at what her life had just become. She saw a ‘best of’ tab, and selected it to see highlights of her day, and scrolled back through pictures mostly taken by her mom, sprinkled with crisp, well framed images captured from random mall-goers.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that one’s my favorite,” her mom pointed to the one she took earlier, when the dildo had first appeared in her while she was writhing on the floor of the breast pump store. Her mom had shown her that picture before, but since then her thighs had thickened, and her lips had pumped up even more, and the reality altering nature of the chronivac had changed this picture to reflect that, too. With her eyes closed, and her lips pushed out, it looked more like she was orgasming on the floor rather than trying to get up.<br />
<br />
“Isn’t it funny? That picture really looks like you were cumming right there, but really I just happened to take it at exactly the right instant. And then you get caught masturbating in the bathroom! You’re really providing for your fans.” With that, her mom put her finger to her chin in thought. “You know, actually...” She began tapping away on her phone.<br />
<br />
Joanna watched as every picture in the gallery subtly changed. The picture of her gorging herself on nachos changed so that her hand was tweaking a nipple, and her face was flush with an obvious horniness. A picture of her walking through the mall changed so her fat tongue was running along her lips, and her eyes shifted slightly so they were focused on the camera, like they were hungry for something carnal. A picture of her maneuvering her fat ass to sit down in the chairs changed so that her hand was on the dildo protruding from her, while she bit her lip in obvious pleasure.<br />
<br />
“What did you do now?” She whined.<br />
<br />
“I made it so that any picture or video taken of you would always be overtly sexual. That way, your fans will get nothing but the best content!”</p>
<hr/><h3>What do you do now?</h3>
