<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff and Micha, now Champ and Rex respectively, were still sane and concious, hidden behind their new puppy personality.<br />
<br />
Both of them had to learn to live with their new bodies and identities, and hope their master would turn them back after a year. Of course, that was only one possible outcome.<br />
<br />
Dean hadn&#39;t exactly commited to a decision yet. After all, they were barely half a day in their year long puppy journey.<br />
Half a day in, and both biys had already gone through so many embarassing moments. They were too small to do anything. They couldn&#39;t even jump up the couch (not that they&#39;d have control over that action anyway). But that was a minor embarassement. The real problem came from their reacquired incontinence.<br />
<br />
Having regressed to 8 weeks old, their tiny puppy parts couldn&#39;t hold much for long, and their doggy brain didn&#39;t mind. While Champ and Rex would &quot;mark&quot; their way ariund the house, Jeff and Micha were afraid they&#39;d have to go through potty training again. Both boys felt ashamed of their condition, which Dean had already considered and was fully enjoying. However, he couldn&#39;t spend all of his time cleaning his pets&#39; mess, so the training began early.<br />
<br />
Finally, the day passed... then the next... and another... Both boys remained uncomfortable, their minds and bodies still alien to them. And that feeling would not go away for a long time.<br />
<br />
While Dean spent his days doing his regular tasks and hobbies (which now included  trainning and caring for his two friends, now reduced to undevelopped dogs and hidden away behind their dumb puppy persona), Jeff and Micha&#39;s days were spent witnessing their new lives.<br />
With no way to interact or communicate with the world around them, all they could do was hope for their humanity to be returned.<br />
<br />
The days felt excrutiatingly long...<br />
<br />
And yet time flowed.<br />
Quickly for one.<br />
Slowly for the others.<br />
<br />
A week passed by.<br />
<br />
Dean was slowly satisfied with their training session.<br />
While going potty was *mostly* taken care of, their next embarassement came from the tricks they had to learn. While Jeff and Micha were okay with learning Sit, Stay or Speak, they didn&#39;t feel too okay with Dean teaching them &quot;Mount&quot; and &quot;Present&quot;.<br />
Were dogs even supposed to learn that? They didn&#39;t like the idea of being used as breeders. However, they felt something else while practicing those commands; something they would only come to understand 4 months later. Something Dean had changed to ensure they would never get used to their new lives.<br />
<br />
More days passed...<br />
Then another week...<br />
<br />
Training was going well. The two puppies had to live through the pain of their first bath time. Dean washed them thouroughly, but made sure to stop when he reached their tiny undevelopped genitals. Their master was grinning at their sizes. He couldn&#39;t help taunt them and shame them. Their balls hadn&#39;t dropped yet, and their tiny furry sheats barely held any content. Their puppy dicks were tiny and truly useless. They already had to live with their loss everytime Chamo and Rex tongued themselves, feeling their minuscule manhood in their own mouths. While the boys wished their master wouldn&#39;t notice, Dean couldn&#39;t get enough of pointing it out.<br />
<br />
A few days passed... or was it a week? Both of them ended up losing track of time much faster than they thought. Their lives had grown so agonizingly slow, they felt like they were gonna go insane. Unfortunately for them, Dean had tempered with their settings and had made sure his two friends would remain sane and concious for the whole year.<br />
<br />
Soon, months had started passing... then another... and another... each felt longer than the last. Jeff thought 8 months had passed. Micha thought they were nearing the 1 year mark. And still the days went on... Hours? Minutes? Even seconds were nothing but drawn out embarassement.<br />
<br />
Until one morning.<br />
<br />
Champ woke up as usual cuddled to Rex. However, something felt different. While they had grown a little over the past months, it wasn&#39;t because of that. By the time the minds of Jeff and Micha woke up, Dean was standing in front of them both with a big bowl of treats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surprise!! How are my good boys doing? Did you two sleep well?? I hope you did, &#39;cause today is your special day!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two puppies barked in excitement, while their human minds felt... odd...<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right! Today, you two are becoming men again!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two boys couldn&#39;t believe it.<br />
&quot;IS IT OVER?!&quot;<br />
&quot;HAS IT BEEN A YEAR?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean spoke behind a sadistic grin<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right!! You two aren&#39;t boys anymore! When I... repurposed you two, I made sure your bodies would become sexually active once you reach six months!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both dogs wagged their tail, lightly swinging their tiny erections from left to right... and both boys could finally feel and understand this odd feeling they had since they woke up. It was a primal need... Lust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit!&quot; Dean commanded.<br />
<br />
Both of his pets sat down, exposing their tiny erect cocks.<br />
The boys were at a loss...<br />
<br />
Dean placed the treats in front of them, which he had took the time to layout in a phallic form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now before you too start to chow down, I might need to explain something... See, there&#39;s 2 changes I&#39;ve made that you two weren&#39;t aware of yet. The first is simple. Even though you two are different breeds, I&#39;ve made sure you were both blood related. I also took the liberty of setting both of your birthdays exactly 6 months ago. So you two are officially brothers from the same litter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brothers?? What was the point of making them brothers, except making them feel weird?<br />
<br />
&quot;...as for the second change, well...&quot; Dean grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39; t I let you two do the math.&quot;</p>
