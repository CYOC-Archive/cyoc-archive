<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;... a pair for breeding.  Huskies, probably,&quot; she said with only a hint of shame.<br />
<br />
Tom opened his mouth to question what she was even talking about when a sensation like sudden heat burn raced up his throat and tighten his chest.  His arms folded in, there was the crack and pop of his ribs followed by a cramping of his hands.  He fell forward, only just getting his hands flat to save his face hitting the carpet.  Catching his breath, eyes shocked open, a soreness in his jaw spread to his nose which twitched and started to turn a shade of black.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, Tom,&quot; Matt gasped, nearly sapped of his strength at the sight of his friend&#39;s rapid descent into an already more canine looking form.  Tom&#39;s legs were looking thinner and were shrinking in his pants while Matt could see his friend&#39;s feet were growing out of the confines of his socks.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-husky?&quot; Tom muttered, his breathed staggered by the sight of his nails darkening passed the view of his growing... muzzle.  His glasses fell off just before he looked up at Kate.  &quot;I have a husky at home... Ralph,&quot; Tom tried to smile but only felt the sharpness of his new teeth against his changing lip.<br />
<br />
Kate sighed and walked in, looking down at down as tufts of fur were showing around his neck, waist line and chest.  She knelt down and ran her hand down Tom&#39;s back, causing him to shiver, his ears pointing up more and more.  &quot;Is Ralph fixed?&quot; she asked.  As she did, Matt saw her hand reach the base of his friend&#39;s spine where his loosen pants revealing a growing and already fur sprouted tail. <br />
<br />
Tom gulped, feeling a tingling heat in his crotch, his balls, and his cock hard and leaking but without any actual release.<br />
<br />
With a hard swallow, Tom answered, &quot;N-n-no,&quot; while his hands cramped into paws and his palms grew blackened pads.<br />
<br />
Kate, looking right Matt, slipped Tom&#39;s pants off, revealing his backside which was nearly identical to a husky bitch in her first heat.  Save the brief shriveling away of his cock into the swollen sex now between his legs, even teats beyond were showing on Matt&#39;s former&#39;s male friend&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you what, since I made the mistake, I&#39;ll make sure Ralph gives you your second litter,&quot; Kate said, tugging Tom up by his tail in order to free him of pants and socks and little remaining humanity.<br />
<br />
Tom had already knew, somewhat, that he wasn&#39;t male anymore but to hear it was a wash over him that caused him to flush, making the hair on his head finally shed to make way for his canine ears and new fur.  &quot;I used to have... drrreams,&quot; Tom struggled to say, his new tongue lapping out and waves of new hormones passing through his veins with every breath, &quot;of Ralph mounting me... thought it was... weird... wrong... maybe it was just... my fate...&quot; were the last words he managed before whines and throaty barks replaced language.<br />
<br />
Tom worked himself, with help form Kate, from his shirt as the last of the fur, and changes, took him.  <br />
<br />
She touched his head, looking over at Matt who had let his pants slip down, revealing an engorged red doggy cock sprouting from an already furry crotch and balls.  His ears were elongated along with his black nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom really wanted that, huh,&quot; Kate muttered.  She looked up and saw the entranced look in Matt&#39;s eye.  &quot;Go on, boy.  Once you finish, you&#39;ll be that dog forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate meant it as something of a deterrent but Matt seemed to take it as a challenge.  He moved forward, tugging off his shirt to reveal a sweating, already sunken and changed rib cage and muscles.  Trying to walk, he only stumbled forward onto his changing hands.  It hardly impeded him as he crawled on, becoming more and more dog as the scent of his roommate fueled a lust that was doom him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... won&#39;t die a virgin...&quot; Matt whimpered before losing his voice, and head, to the husky he now was.<br />
<br />
Kate stepped out of the way as Matt came up and shoved his new wet nose into Tom&#39;s swollen cunt.  Both started to pant and Kate could only turn away to hide her laugh.  She thought at first this would be something that would haunt her for years but both these boys seemed to want this.  Her mind was interrupted by a yelp from Tom as Matt had begun his first attempt at mounting, his body now almost fully husky.<br />
<br />
Kate moved to Tom&#39;s shoulders and held him still while Matt&#39;s forelegs gripped harder.  <br />
<br />
Ten minutes ago, Tom and Matt were thinking about what to order for dinner and now Tom was coming to grips with being a mom... to puppies.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll make sure you keep your mind somewhat.  For Ralph at least,&quot; Kate whispered in Tom&#39;s ear.  &quot;Just let the instincts do most the work.  Remember, you kinda want this,&quot; she reminded him just as Matt found his mark.<br />
<br />
Kate moved away, watching what were now just two very horny huskies fucking in the middle of some torn clothes in a dorm.  She pulled out her phone and made the call, with the can arriving downstairs just as Matt&#39;s cock started to swell.  As the massive first load of Matt emptied into Tom, anything of Matt the human disappeared and what remained was what could have been a 2 year- old husky from birth.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll only need one cage,&quot; Kate instructed over the phone as the two dogs collapsed.<br />
<br />
While Matt was just a dog, Tom was hazy but still very away there was a dog cock stuck in him.  In his cunt.  And that he was very likely, <br />
<br />
&quot;Pregnant,&quot; said the farmer who gave Tom only the quick once over before affixing a collar to him and Matt.  Pushed into a large cage, Tom&#39;s heart started to race as the heights of arousal dipped and the depth of his predicament started to set in.  And what he had admitted to.  With Ralph...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ralph?&quot; the farmer asked Kate as the cage was pushed into the back of the van.<br />
<br />
She handed him an address she had taken from Tom&#39;s phone.  &quot;I kinda made a mistake, Uncle Frank.  Least you could do.  Just offer the parents a big stud fee.  They&#39;ll need the money for all the search efforts for their lost son,&quot; she added with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, you&#39;re twisted&quot; he said to her, taking the address and shutting the back doors.</p>
