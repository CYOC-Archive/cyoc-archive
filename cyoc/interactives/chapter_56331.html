<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen wiggled down the hall toward her locker.  She needed to find her friends and that was the best place to start.  There were always people hanging around her space.  Hangers on, that only wanted for her to show them a little attention.  Maybe there would be a little hunky dork she could twist into getting her off.<br />
<br />
As she made her way up the stairs she found her rubbery midsection seemed to wiggle distractingly.  She passed a student on the steps and he nearly fell down the stairs trying to look up her skirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;See anything you like?&quot; Jen scolded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just curious,&quot; the boy said.  &quot;I always wondered what a fuck-doll looked like down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a fuck-doll,&quot; Jen said bitterly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could have had me fooled,&quot; the boy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; Jen was angry now.  She knew that people would start to treat her like a sex toy.  Tiffany had done that thing with the banana after all.  But she expected that some people would treat her like normal for a little longer.<br />
<br />
Another boy came into view on the lower landing.  &quot;Yo, Dinkus!  Don't talk to that.  People will think you're nuts if you talk to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was stunned.  Too shocked to talk back, as the boy on the stairs turned and started after the other boy.  He had referred to Jen as an it.  A thing that was not to be talked too.  Even while she was still able to talk.  She had to do something about this.<br />
<br />
Racing as best she could to her locker she had to push past a small crowd of petty social climbers.  Jen was trying to think of someone that she trusted enough to try to get to help.  She ignored the other people as she opened her locker.  Lost in her thoughts she started to remove the mornings books from her bag and replace them with the ones for the afternoon.  Her biology text tumbled to the floor of the hall from her incredibly messy locker.<br />
<br />
Before she even thought about it, Jen bent over to pick it up.  Her massive, inflated ass flipped her skirt up exposing itself to the people standing about.  As she tidied up the mess of her bag, Jen suddenly felt a hand on her rump.<br />
<br />
She froze.<br />
<br />
The hand was from one of the clowns that was tried to impress people with their antics.  Jen never paid any attention to those morons, but there always seemed to be one in every clump of students.  Now one of them had placed his hand on her ass.  Jen was about to spin around and tear the boy's hand clean off his arm but she was unable to move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  Guys!  Look!&quot; the boy was saying.  He used his hand to squeeze Jen's bum.  He made it squeak and pop as he kneaded the rubber skin.  He slapped her and made the inflated body part bounce about comically.  The others laughed.<br />
<br />
Jen could not move.  She could not stand.  She could not walk away.  In her mind she wanted to.  She wanted to run but she could not make her legs move.  Was this it, she thought.  Was she stuck to this place until someone screwed her?<br />
<br />
The showman started to make suggestive hip movements behind Jen.  He feigned like he was screwing her ass.  He humped and ground his groin into her round butt to the hoots and hollers from those assembled.  Occasionally his hips would cause his dick to rub against Jen's skin and it sent tingles of pleasure down her body.  She wanted him to do something more than mime screwing her in the ass.  She wondered why he did not just pull off her panties and stick his meaty dick deep into her back door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just do it already!&quot; Jen screamed.  But it seemed no one was listening.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're gross,&quot; one of the junior cheer-girls said suddenly.  Jen had seen the girl before.  Lisa, was a cute little elf like girl that would be great for throwing during cheers.  Jen wanted to call out to Lisa to make the boy do something more.  But Lisa was not even looking at Jen.  She was laughing along with the others even if she looked uncomfortable. &quot;Stop before Mr. Danforth comes and kills you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's he going to do?  I ain't doing anything wrong.&quot;  The boy continued to bop Jen with his hips.<br />
<br />
Jen was almost incapable of thinking.  The blood was rushing to her head and she was feeling dizzy.  Also the feelings she was getting from her ass was enough to frighten her.  It scared her how much she really wanted to be done up the ass in front of all these stupid kids.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare?&quot; Jen screamed.  Or she tried to.  As soon as she had started to form the first word she was pelted by a massive orgasm.  It wobbled her legs and stopped her tongue.  Jen collapsed in heap on the floor moaning and screaming in pleasure.<br />
<br />
It was full minute before she calmed down enough to realize she was still in the hall.  It was few minutes more before she discovered that the crowd had dispersed.  Mr. Danforth had come running at Jen's loud wailing and found a group of students doing something inappropriate.  He had shouted and the kids had fled.  And through it all no one had bothered to look at the sad sex toy dressed in a cheer uniform slowly writhing on the floor.<br />
<br />
Jen burst into tears.  She wobbled on her massive ass as she sat on the cold floor.  She did not know if it was because no one cared or because she had missed a chance to be turned back to normal.  Slowly she got to her feet and straightened herself out a little.  She slammed her locker shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright, Jen?&quot; a voice said behind her.</p>
