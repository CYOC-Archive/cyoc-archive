<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I have a surprise.” Kayla said, with a smirk.<br />
<br />
She hopped out of bed, pulling a book on her bookshelf. To Daisy’s surprise, the bookshelf opened inwards, revealing a hidden room. Inside was a refrigerator. Kayla opened it and grabbed the one item it held - a glass bottle containing a viscous white liquid. The side of it said “Colt Jizzmilk Co.” and had an equine in a cow print bikini lying on her side as the logo.<br />
<br />
“This is a special equine drink. Just the label gets me excited. You can only buy it in Mareville. I had this sent to an abandoned building outside of town. I snuck in past 3 am. I was shaking, dressed in all black, convinced someone would see me. That was two weeks ago. I’ve kept it here ever since, waiting for a chance to drink it. Now I have you to share it with.” <br />
<br />
Kayla took the top off of it and inhaled deeply, moaning as she savored the wonderful scent. Looking at Daisy, she poured half the bottle into her mouth. Using all her willpower, she stopped herself from consuming it all. Kayla’s nipples turned rock hard.<br />
<br />
“Oh… oh my Goddess… this is the most delicious thing I’ve ever tasted!” Kayla shouted out in ecstasy. She strutted over to Daisy. “I’d heard it was an aphrodisiac… but, mmmm… oh, try some, lover!”<br />
<br />
Daisy looked at the bottle and took it, unsure if she should try it. After all, it turned Kayla near insane with lust. The mayor looked at her with excitement in her eyes, waiting for a response.<br />
<br />
Daisy thought about it for a second but then caught a whiff of the elusive drink. Her face lit up, and immediately after that, she chugged the rest of the bottle, sticking her tongue in to get as much jizzmilk as she could.<br />
<br />
As Kayla watched this happily, she didn’t realized that she’d started changing.<br />
<br />
Kayla’s body hair disappeared as her body became toned and fit. Any flaws or imperfections disappeared on her body as a layer of permanent makeup appeared on her, including her perfectly manicured nails. Her lips grew significantly, becoming DSLs like all horse herms had. Kayla’s ears moved to the top of her head, becoming shaped like a horse’s as they grew a fine layer of fur that matched her hair.<br />
<br />
Daisy looked at Kayla, wondering what was different. However, the Jizzmilk kicked in, and her libido rose dramatically as she changed identically to Kayla.<br />
<br />
Daisy and Kayla were now well on their way to being fully transformed, but their transformations had paused. The two couldn’t resist anymore as they began making out once again.<br />
<br />
Kayla and Daisy began fingering each other. Their vaginas and anuses changed next, becoming equine. Their scents changed, both now matching the musk that had filled Kayla’s house before.<br />
<br />
As the two of them made out passionately, grabbing each others’ bodies and each fingering the other’s horsy pussy, the changes sped up. Each girl’s hips and rear expanded, their now massive stripper asses firm and round. To match their ears, a tail grew above each of their impressive butts, each with the same color fur as their ears.<br />
<br />
Kayla and Daisy’s breasts expanded next, becoming massive orbs standing proudly on their chests, their nipples growing and becoming as long as their thumbs. Their bosoms continued to defy gravity as they filled to the brim with corruptive equine milk.<br />
<br />
Finally, on each girl, a horse cock and balls quickly grew in above their equine vaginas. Daisy was now pounding Kayla from behind. Reality was altering; equine porn played on Kayla’s huge TV and Kayla’s bedroom was now filled with equine goodies; dildos, pocket pussies, Jizzmilk by the gallon, and lots and lots of porn. Instead of Mareville being a small part of Glendale, the entire town was now known as Mareville, the idea of Glendale disappearing. Just as the small section had changed, the rest of Mareville did too, the gate still separating them from the outside world but now encompassing a town of 50,000 - with just enough of a majority of horse herms to vote Kayla, the world’s first horse herm mayor, into office. Just as it had changed before, the boring suburban town became a villa surrounded by equine specialty shops, cafes, and a huge public square dedicated to Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Much of the town was still opposed to horse herms, but stayed there exclusively due to the “no one under 18” rule. There was conflict, but Mayor Kayla Jensen and her wife, First Lady Daisy Jensen took good care of the town.<br />
<br />
As the two horse herms orgasmed, shooting from their cocks, tits, and pussies, reality finished rewriting itself. Wedding rings appeared on Kayla and Daisy’s fingers, the two now happily married for over a year.<br />
<br />
The two herms panted as the flopped down on the bed.<br />
<br />
“That was wonderful, babe.” Kayla moaned out.<br />
<br />
“Your pussy is so fucking tight on my massive cock.” Daisy said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
However, Daisy clutched her head. SOMETHING was wrong here. She vaguely remembered being an aid to the mayor, a strict, no nonsense, equine hating woman… but that couldn’t be right! Her wife, an equine, was the mayor. Daisy’s head spun. Suddenly, she had a revelation.<br />
<br />
“Babe. I’m gonna go visit Jennifer. I need to speak to her about something.” Daisy said to Kayla.<br />
<br />
Kayla looked at her, a bit worried. Her wife didn’t normally get this serious, at least to her knowledge.<br />
<br />
“I understand. Tell Jennifer I said hi. And if she’s still up for round two, bring her back here, we can have a threesome.” Kayla said, giving Daisy a smack on the ass.<br />
<br />
“I will, babe. I love you.” Daisy said.<br />
<br />
“I love you too. She should still be up, at least for a few more hours.” Kayla said.<br />
<br />
Daisy dressed in yoga pants, a pair of sneakers, and a tank top. Part of her remembered that she loved running, like all horse herms do, but another part reminded her of being an asthmatic human that hated exercising. She shook her head; she needed to get to Jennifer, fast. She’d know what to do.<br />
<br />
Daisy began her run through an unfamiliar town. It was very nice, almost like a European city, but none of it felt familiar. Soon, she arrived at Jennifer’s palace. She noticed how much she was sweating - despite that, her breath was at a steady pace and she didn’t feel tired in the slightest. She’d run 9 miles - that was normal, wasn’t it? And sweating was normal for equines, they found it attractive. Unlike humans who smelled bad, equines smelled wonderful when they sweated. But something was telling her it was wrong to be covered in sweat or to have such a delectable musk. She needed to see Jennifer, desperately.</p>
