<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle grabbed the chrome colored pack of gum. Scanning for any words or text; there was nothing.<br />
<br />
Out in the distance something caught Kyle&#39;s eye it was Josh walking in a fag like way to his car. Kyle shoved his rod down his pant leg and tried zipping up his fly to no avail. But it was too late as Josh knocked on his window.<br />
&quot; Let me in.&quot; He said looking him directly in the eyes. <br />
&quot; Why would I do that?&quot; he said glaring right back at him.<br />
&quot; Because I can help you with that.&quot; pointing to the outline in his pants.<br />
&quot; Fuck no! Get away from me!&quot; He shouted through the glass. <br />
&quot; I would hate for these pictures to get around then.&quot; He said as he held up his phone to the glass. They were all pictures of him asleep as his penis squirted down his pants into his shoe.<br />
Kyle couldn&#39;t let anyone see this.<br />
&quot; Get in and shut up.&quot; he said with contempt.<br />
He unlocked the door as Jon came in and got in the passenger side.<br />
&quot; Let&#39;s pull around to the back of the parking lot.&quot; He said with his gay lisp.<br />
Kyle didn&#39;t like being ordered around especially by someone like Jon, and especially by being black mailed. He did as he was told and went to the back of the parking lot where there were few cars. They were alone. <br />
&quot; Okay now take it out babe.&quot;<br />
&quot; What the Fuck for?&quot;<br />
&quot; You obviously need some help down there let me help relieve some of that pressure.&quot; He said as his head got closer to his pants and he scooted closer.<br />
&quot; Fuck no we aren&#39;t doing this. I&#39;m not letting you suck my dick!&quot; He said .<br />
&quot; Tisk Tisk Tisk, you need to calm down and don&#39;t forget about my phone.&quot; He whispered.<br />
&quot; And what is stopping me from beating your ass and breaking your fucking phone Bitch?&quot; He declared back<br />
&quot; Its already on my iCloud we mine as well get to it.&quot; he whispered seductivly<br />
He was screwed. But what was the harm, get a free blowjob, with his massive dick at 10:30 in the morning, why not? <br />
&quot; Fine but I&#39;m only doing this because your fucking me over.&quot; he said in regret.<br />
&quot; Oh of course Kyle.&quot; He said as he undid the button.<br />
Kyle took his penis out.<br />
<br />
It was smaller than it was a few minutes ago but Jon didn&#39;t seem to care. His eyes gazed over as he saw it come out in full force. <br />
&quot;We need some more space lets go in the back baby.&quot; he said as both boys got in the back of his SUV. Kyle played on his back as Jon maneuvered around to his legs and started stroking his member.<br />
He started licking it and lobbing it in his gums. He played with his balls a little bit to. Kyle just looked up at the ceiling of the car and pretended not to notice the sucking sounds from below. At some point he started deep throating and Kyle actually started to like it, although it would take a lot more time for him to cum. After another five minutes Jon was making some progress. The car was fogging up and pre and saliva was running down his 18 inch shaft Jon took up a little more than half that. He was thrusting into his mouth going up and down. <br />
&quot; Im not leaving this car until you come Kyle.&quot; He declared.<br />
Kyle started thinking about the dream he just has of the girl sucking him off. It was warm like this and if he didn&#39;t look, Jon kinda was the slut in the dream. After another two minutes he was getting close and Jon could tell to. Kyle didn&#39;t tell Jon when he was cumming though on purpose. Suddenly Kyle sat up and shoved Jon&#39;s head on his shaft as he moaned a little when the white flood exploded into his mouth. Jon flinched and jerked as he was forced to swallow the gallon. A few jerks of his own and he was finished. Kyle let go but Jon stayed on still slurping what remained. In the end Jon pulled the rest of his dick out of his mouth gasping. <br />
&quot; That was by far the biggest, the longest, and most full dick that I have ever sucked.&quot; he said breathing heavily.<br />
&quot; Yeah okay cool, thanks I guess?&quot; he said not sure how to respond.<br />
&quot; I&#39;m a boi of my word so here.&quot; He said as he pulled out his phone for Kyle to see as he deleted the picture of his phone and iCloud backup.<br />
Jon said thanks and left the car making sure that Kyle knew he was welcome to it again.<br />
Only seconds after this Kyle got a text from Jack.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It read &quot; Fuck dude you gotta help me I look like my fag cousin! Get over to my house now! I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening to us?!?!&quot; <br />
Kyle looked at the gum pack and floured it to Jack&#39;s house.</p>
