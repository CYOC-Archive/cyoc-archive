<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Laying on the floor, slightly dazed, the large man, now without what had been a beautifully thick cock, slowly swallowed down the lifeguard&#39;s seed, stomach bloated with the sheer volume of the stuff. The pool employee had left in a hurry, but the frantic blowjob had been nearly as good as any sex the man had previously had in his life.<br />
<br />
He felt so good, so <i>full</i>, that it was difficult to imagine hauling himself off the shower floor. But even as he fantasized at laying there, on the slick ground, as his body slowly processed the seed that had been pumped into him, the man felt a new spark of arousal.The man groaned, both in trepidation and anticipation. Whatever had been happening to him, whatever had suddenly stolen his cock and balls, had also granted him more pleasure than he had ever experienced, even as he never crested the hill into true orgasm. But, it seemed, it also had made him hornier than he had been, even in his teenage years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; a voice calls out, startling the man as he tries to look towards the sound. Someone shifts, and the soft sounds of a locker trying to open and being stopped in place by its lock echoes through the largely empty room, off the tiled floors. &quot;Is anyone there?&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice sparks his arousal higher, and the man can&#39;t help but bring a hand back to the sensitive skin of his pubic mound, pleasured focused more there than it had ever been in his cock. There was something alluring about whoever was speaking, and he began the laborious effort of standing with multiple pounds of extra weight sloshing around inside his stretched stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you stuck in there?&quot; the man asks, voice hoarse from both his previous wanton moans and the cock that he had stuffed down it only minutes before. &quot;Yes,&quot; comes the answer, sounding somewhat contrite.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you... did you see that?&quot; The feeling of shame is starting to well up within him for the first time, but it&#39;s quickly quashed. His arousal is returning full force, suddenly the idea of the stranger in the locker watching him no longer seeming as mortifying in the face of what would&#39;ve been one of the hardest boners of his life, if he still had the equipment to allow for one.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; the voice in the locker confirms. The man has to hold back a groan, feeling hotter than before. That someone <i>had</i> seen him felt sexier than anything else he had ever experienced, and he desperately wished he could return to writhing on the floor. The idea of it was even more appealing before, knowing now that he had an audience.<br />
<br />
The man felt light-headed, mind clouded with arousal. The hand on his empty groin pressed against him harder as he bucks up into it, bloated stomach <i>sloshing</i> with the motion as the added weight causes it to droop further down than it had before, resting on his hand. It all felt so unimaginably <i>good</i> that he felt himself slipping again, felt his knees weakening beneath arousal and the heft of the cum filling him. <i>It won&#39;t be long until I&#39;m on the floor again,</i> a distant part of him absentmindedly notes, unconcerned. He can feel his attempts at masturbation, though he has a suspicion that they&#39;re likely to be completely futile, begin to ramp up in intensity again, but the voice from the locker abruptly interrupts him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you get someone to help me out of here, please?&quot; When the man in the locker had begun to speak, his arousal had tapered off, just enough for him to listen and process the request. But once it had been made, his head was heavy and fogged again, and would&#39;ve left him feeling miles from his body if it wasn&#39;t for the strong, tactile sensations of his stomach stretching across an unimaginably huge load of semen and his own hand on his empty groin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; the man agrees, still absentmindedly chasing the pleasure he had been party to before. He nearly lost himself to the motion, almost let himself sink back into a masturbatory haze as he chased a climax, but the voice from the locker stopped him once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should probably get dressed,&quot; Kaden helpfully supplies from within the locker he had managed to get himself trapped in. The man nods, pleasure singing through him, and stumbles, somewhat dazedly, to where he had dropped his swim trunks what feels like forever ago. As he pulls them up, the fabric both feeling and sitting oddly on his empty groin. He&#39;s rewarded for his efforts with more arousal, a washing of pleasure nearing the intensity of that of an orgasm, but without the focus of his now-gone cock, he feels it all the more strongly, throughout his entire body.<br />
<br />
His knees almost buckle, the man only narrowly catching himself with one hand against a nearby wall. He distantly registers that he&#39;s moaning and gasping, nearly out of his mind as he experiences the sensations. It&#39;s better than anything he has ever felt before, and despite his distraction, he can somewhat fit the pieces together.When he had agreed to help the man in the locker, and then followed his directions, his body had responded in ways that it didn&#39;t to his own touch. It was probably a long shot, but he couldn&#39;t help but want to chase it, already craving a repeat of what was only now just beginning to taper off. The man wets his lips, slowly easing his weight off the tiled wall. It was tempting to try and reach the fading high once more, but he would do his best to resist for now. If he could simply acquiesce to what the man in the locker asked of him and be granted pleasure beyond what he could achieve by himself, why shouldn&#39;t he? It would be so, so much easier.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, if Kaden hadn&#39;t still been magically stoking the large man&#39;s libido to an absurd degree, he would be hitting something akin to post-nut clarity. But he was, making the man in the showers so horny that he would be nearly unable to think. If Kaden could get this to work, maybe he&#39;d be able to have someone subservient to his every whim. Just the idea was enough to make him shudder with pleasure, his own arousal beginning to flare. Maybe it was about time to allow himself another orgasm - it&#39;s not like he&#39;d leave a mess in the locker, not with his lack of a cock.<br />
<br />
Blearily, struggling to keep his mind on the task in front of him, the man works his way out of the showers, through the pool&#39;s locker room, and to the small check-in desk, currently staffed by a teenager - probably on his summer break. He catches a glimpse of the lifeguard who had cum so hard down his throat that he&#39;s still bloated by it, who quickly begins to flush and flees back to his post. Though the experience hadn&#39;t been as pleasurable as what he&#39;d felt while complying with Kaden&#39;s requests, a cock in his mouth had been a near divine experience. One that he wouldn&#39;t mind repeating, though perhaps later.<br />
<br />
The teen manning check-in looks uncertain as he takes in the man&#39;s rumpled state. It wasn&#39;t unlikely that he had heard there was someone getting off in the men&#39;s showers, and it wasn&#39;t as if the lifeguard had successfully escorted anyone out. The man distantly notes the younger man&#39;s name tag reads &quot;Bryan&quot;, though he doesn&#39;t particularly try to commit it to memory, nor does he have any shame over this Bryan potentially knowing just what he had been doing not that long ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you, sir?&quot; It&#39;s obvious that Bryan&#39;s plastered on smile is somewhat strained, but trying his best to stick to customer service protocol. It takes a few moments too long for the question to finally penetrate the man&#39;s horny fog, head filled with little beyond potential physical pleasures. Bryan looks like he&#39;s a senior in high school, or perhaps a college freshman. It&#39;s younger than the man would usually go for, being nearly twice Bryan&#39;s age, and the lean form isn&#39;t his usual type, but he can&#39;t help but imagine a cock grinding up against his empty loins, filling his ass, pumping down his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir?&quot;Bryan is looking near-pained now, polite smile beginning to slide off. The man manages to pull himself out of it, for just a moment. Long enough to get out the words he had been sent to deliver. &quot;Someone&#39;s stuck in a locker, near the showers.&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice is hoarse, both from the pounding it had taken from the lifeguard and the amount of moaning he&#39;d done in the last hour or so. But Bryan seems to care more about the new piece of information he had just been given, rather than the building evidence that something&#39;s wrong with the swimsuit-clad man in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me go find the master key then,&quot; Bryan says, in a rush, &quot;and I&#39;ll be right in to help them out. Do you know what happened?&quot; <br />
<br />
The man&#39;s answer is slow to come, the single word drawing out for a beat longer than it would with someone still with all their faculties intact. &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan&#39;s growing concern is visible on his face, but he pushes it aside to deal with what seems to be registering as the more immediate issue. He rummages, briefly, under the counter where a small sign-in sheet is, before turning to go into the tiny nearby office, barely large enough for a modestly sized desk. He returns not long after, a ring of keys jingling against each other as he steps around the counter and towards the men&#39;s locker room.<br />
<br />
He gives another tentative smile to the man, and disappears around the corner. The man follows, still nearly feeling as if he&#39;s floating, head feeling heavy with the fog of arousal. Before he makes it back to the showers, he can hear the quiet conversation echo against the walls of the shower room. The young man is just stepping out of the lockers as the man answers, and he&#39;s greeted with what feels like a brilliant smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for getting help,&quot; he says, &quot;you were a very good boy.&quot;The man almost drops to his knees as the words hit him, his baseline arousal immediately spiking into a full body orgasm, more powerful than anything he had experienced yet, even with all he had been through in this short period of time. He&#39;s awash in pure pleasure, riding the wave that crests ever higher. The pool employee, Bryan, is staring at his in slack-jawed shock. It&#39;s only then that the man registers his wanton moaning, some nearing hoarse screams as he feels only vaguely connected to his physical body.<br />
<br />
Kaden is smiling, triumphant, and turns his gaze towards the newly arrived man. He had already had a couple of test subjects, but another wouldn&#39;t hurt.</p>
