<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After thinking a lot Luna decided that it would be better to seek medical help. The first thing she did when she got out of the shower was call her boss telling her she couldn&#39;t go to work that day to see the doctor, choosing to have the appointment with Daniel because he had known her for a long time and given her condition he would probably be the only one who would believe her when she said that male genitals had grown to replace the female parts between her legs.<br />
<br />
Luna called Daniel right away to make an appointment, she didn&#39;t want to say what the problem was over the phone because she was embarrassed. She took the subway to the clinic where her old crush worked, so she put on baggy pants where her dick wouldn&#39;t form a very obvious bulge. Arriving at the office, the secretary told her to wait a while while she was going to notify Daniel of her arrival, leaving a few minutes later asking her to come in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Luna, nice to see you after so long. Looks like you&#39;re doing just fine, or maybe not since you had to come see me at work.&quot; Daniel said greeting her as soon as she entered the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I also think it&#39;s good to see you again. Something really happened to me, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something serious enough to put my life at risk, but it&#39;s very weird and I don&#39;t really know how to say it.&quot;  Luna said<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to think too much, just say what you&#39;re feeling that bothers you and I&#39;ll do the rest.&quot; Daniel said<br />
<br />
&quot;So I will say, it may sound strange but I need you to believe me. I have a dick. It might be hard to believe but a dick grew in me yesterday and my testicles formed, today when I woke up my dick and my balls were bigger and I didn&#39;t have my vagina anymore.&quot; Luna said<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...I&#39;ve never heard of a single case of a woman having her genitals replaced, much less so quickly. I need to see this. Can you please drop your pants?&quot; Daniel said<br />
<br />
Luna took off the underside of her clothes as Daniel asked and sat on the exam table, she spread her legs to make it easier for him to see.<br />
<br />
Daniel examined his old schoolmate and saw that the dick and balls appeared to be totally healthy and there wouldn&#39;t be anything strange about it if it weren&#39;t between the legs of whoever was there and the circumstances that made it to be there. With no records of any woman who had spontaneously exchanged her genitals for those of the opposite sex, he believed that he was either some Trans who had become too much like his old schoolmate and tried to impersonate her, or she was already a transgender. a boy in transition since that time and he never noticed. He was very suspicious but didn&#39;t want to say it openly, so he decided to take the test and said &quot;To me it just looks like a normal dick and balls and....&quot; put a finger deep in Luna&#39;s ass &quot;...you also have a prostate here. According to what you say you didn&#39;t have any of that until yesterday morning, did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, when I woke up yesterday I was still a normal woman.&quot; Luna said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, you can put your clothes back on and go to the room at the end of the hall, there you will do some tests to help identify what happened to you.&quot; Daniel said<br />
<br />
Luna followed the instructions and went to the indicated room and when she arrived she was greeted by a woman with the identification &#39;Dra Lang&#39; on her badge. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, you must be Luna. Daniel sent me a message explaining that you grew a penis, he informed me that I am going to do an ultrasound on you to see how your internal organs are doing.&quot; Dr Lang said. She also didn&#39;t believe Luna&#39;s story, believing it less than Daniel, and intended to do a battery of tests on her to unmask her.<br />
<br />
Luna lay down on a stretcher where she was indicated while Dr Lang turned on the ultrasound device and after applying the gel placed it against her belly. She just watched as the doctor looked at the screen, but she then felt and realized that her dick got hard, which the doctor noticed and said she didn&#39;t have to worry about it, returning to staring intently at the screen without saying anything.<br />
<br />
Dr Lang didn&#39;t say a word until she blurted out &quot;It can&#39;t be.&quot; and leave the room leaving Luna alone, returning two minutes later accompanied by Daniel. &quot;That doesn&#39;t make sense, I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.&quot; she was saying when she walked in<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see this.&quot; Daniel said and ran to the ultrasound screen, where he looked for a minute before commenting &quot;Curious&quot; and start groping Luna&#39;s dick<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it Daniel, you&#39;ll make me come.&quot; Luna said<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s exactly what I want. We found something unexpected and to understand better we need to see when you have an orgasm.&quot; Daniel said. He then signaled to Mrs. Lang, who understanding his intentions took a beaker cup and took it there, so she lowered Luna&#39;s pants, took her dick and continued stroking it pointing into the glass.<br />
<br />
With her old schoolmate examining the images on the monitor, Luna came and her cum was collected by Dr Lang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Daniel, tell me what you found.&quot; Luna asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I can see here that you have a totally healthy male reproductive system, but even without a vagina you have everything else in your female reproductive system intact. Your uterus and ovaries are still there perfectly functional.&quot; Daniel said<br />
<br />
&quot;This can get me in trouble! for my health?&quot; Luna asked<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not sure yet, so we&#39;ve collected your semen for testing.&quot; Dr Lang said<br />
<br />
&quot;Now give me your arm, I want some of your blood to test too.&quot; Daniel said and took a sample of Luna&#39;s blood, then released her to wait for the results at home and that they would call her when the tests were ready.</p>
