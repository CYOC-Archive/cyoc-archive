<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Nolan pushed himself out of the chair and made his way for the door. &quot;Well I guess I should break you <br />
in&quot; he said to the watch &quot;but where should I begin&quot;. As he left he checked his pockets for his keys and <br />
phone when his hand brushed against something soft. He pulled out the folded up napkin and looked it <br />
over. &quot;Oh, I know exactly where I&#39;m starting now&quot;<br />
<br />
He made his way down the street trying to remember the way back to the coffee shop he had visited <br />
yesterday. It wasn&#39;t long before he found himself back in the market district, but he still couldn&#39;t <br />
remember where the coffee shop was. He passed a few familiar stands and shops but nothing clicked.<br />
He was about to double back when his nose caught wind of the familiar earthy smell of coffee grinds. <br />
<br />
He followed the smell down a block and around the corner until he found the little shop, nestled <br />
between two red brick building through the window he saw Nicole waiting at the counter, her head <br />
propped up by her arm. He targeted her with the watch before entering and tried to hide his <br />
excitement.<br />
<br />
As he entered she picked up her head and smiled sweetly at him. &quot;Welcome back Mr. new-in-town&quot; she <br />
greeted &quot;comeback for more?&quot;<br />
&quot;I had some time open up today so I figured I&#39;d get some air and I found myself her again, and the <br />
names Nolan by the way&quot; he extended his hand <br />
&quot;well nice to formally meet you Nolan&quot; she give a gentle smile as she shakes his hand&quot; so what will you <br />
have today?&#39;<br />
&quot;Another chai latte if you could, whole milk!&quot; beating her to the punch<br />
&quot;Ok, sorry but I got &#39;a charge you this time&quot; <br />
&quot;Sure, sure&quot; he went for his wallet only to see that it was empty. Quickly he targeted the wallet and <br />
selected stock. Instantly it was filled with bills and handed her a twenty <br />
She worked the register and handed back the change, Nolan raised his hand denying &quot;no keep the <br />
change, its thanks for being so friendly to me&quot; Nicole blushed <br />
&quot;Well thanks Nolan, that&#39;s really sweet of you&quot; she handed off the drink to Noal who gave a polite wave <br />
and headed towards a nearby table<br />
<br />
He took a sip from his drink before targeting Nicole with the watch. He scrolled through the tabs <br />
selecting the size option with none aware, then taped the apply icon. He took another sip from his drink <br />
with a pleased smile stretching across his face.<br />
<br />
Nicole was chatting to another customer about the shops drink selection when her jeans became rather <br />
tight in appearance. Slowly her ass began to expand inside her jeans, hugging every curve becoming skin <br />
tight. Soon the seams gave way as soft mounds of skin began to escape through the openings. The <br />
customer had finally made his decision and Nicole began her work. Tears formed on both of her ass <br />
cheeks revealing the soft flesh, her rump now double in size. With a pulse it expanded further tearing <br />
the jeans further as she turned around with drink in hand; unaware of the new growth she spun back <br />
around and bumped the counter causing a cup of straws to spill onto the floor. The jeans had had their <br />
final straw as she bent over to clean up the mess, they tore into shreds of fabric revealing the massive <br />
ass cheeks each now the size of a medicine ball.<br />
<br />
As she stood back up her rear bumped into another section of the counter making another mess giving <br />
Nolan another good look at the perfectly formed ass, this time here panties snapped and flung across <br />
the room link a rubber band. No longer warring any pants or undergarments didn&#39;t seem to bother her <br />
that much though Noal noticed goose bumps run up her legs as the shops door opened letting a cold <br />
breeze in.<br />
<br />
Another customer approached the counter, judging from how fast he ordered he must have been a <br />
regular, in a hurry Nicole swung around the counter making the order this time her bootie slammed <br />
hard into one of the tables, knocking over the containers of milk, spilling her whole supple across the <br />
floor. In a panic she apologized to the customer and began cleaning the mess (somehow avoiding <br />
making another) <br />
<br />
Had this been a cartoon a light bulb would have flickered on above Nolan&#39;s head. He searched through <br />
the watch and found the reset option for Nicole and gave it a gentle tap. Slowly Nicole&#39;s buttocks began <br />
to return to their original size, deflating like two flesh colored balloons. As they returned to normal <br />
Nicole didn&#39;t seem to notice she was still pant less, luckily her apron was long enough to cover her <br />
womanhood.   <br />
<br />
Nolan approached her &quot;do you need a hand cleaning that up? I haven&#39;t seen any other employees <br />
around here.&quot;<br />
Nicole picked up her head for a moment before going back to cleaning &quot;no, no I can handle this, and I&#39;m <br />
the only one who works here, I don&#39;t make enough to pay anyone else to work here&quot;<br />
&quot;Well can I help with anything? I feel a little sorry for you doing all this on your own&quot;<br />
She moped the last of the cream off the floor and discarded the towel into a bucket &quot;no it pretty much <br />
all done now, I just need to restock my supply now is all.&quot;<br />
&quot;well ok, just don&#39;t over exhort yourself&quot; he walked away out of view.<br />
<br />
He began to peck away commands into the watch. &quot;Oh I think I know a way I can help you restock your <br />
supply&quot; he whispered to himself. He shortly wondered why he always talked to himself in this manner <br />
before concluding that I didn&#39;t really matter. He watched as Nicole finished cleaning and walked into the <br />
back room out of sight before activating the watch. <br />
<br />
He slowly creped to the door and cracked it open to peer inside, this time would be different from the <br />
last time he used the watch, he wanted to see how Nicole would react when she was knowingly <br />
transforming.<br />
<br />
Inside the back room was a collection of shelves, two large refrigerators, two deck ovens and a large <br />
metal table. Nicole emerged from one of the refrigerators carrying a load of milk cartons, a look of slight <br />
discomfort on her face. She set the load down on the table and rubbed her lower stomach trying to <br />
relive the odd pain. With a pulse her lower stomach bulged out, creating an odd lump under her apron, <br />
her eyes shot open in surprise and panic. Another pulse hit as it grew larger, then another, and another <br />
each adding to its size until it was roughly the size of a volleyball. She cradling the lump with both hands <br />
as its weight began to build, becoming uncomfortable and unable to support itself.  <br />
<br />
Nicole was too afraid to look at what the mysterious mass was, nor did she have the time as a warmth <br />
began to build at the base of her spin. Slowly a small mound of flesh began to build and stretch outward <br />
matching the curvature of her back it slowly it reached one foot in length, then two, and finally stopped <br />
at three feet long in length. Small red hairs began to sprout from its tip until a soft velvet red tuff of fur <br />
caped what Nicole easily recognized as a tail of some sorts, which flickered back and forth without her <br />
control.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? WHATS HAPPENING TOOOOOOOOOO ME?&quot; she quickly covered her <br />
mouth with both hands in shock. The mass dropped onto her lap uncomfortably, she returned one hand <br />
to supporting the unknown mass. Still clasping her mouth she suppressed her laughter as something was <br />
beginning to tickle her ears. She turned to look at her reflection in the window of the refrigerator to see <br />
what was tickling her, only to find it was her ears themselves. They had grown four inches long and were <br />
covered in a fine white and red fur the same color as her hair. They flopped to the sides of her head, <br />
flicking in unison uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
Still gazing into the mirror she saw a small black dot appear on the tip of her nose, it quickly spread <br />
across her nose without warning. The black skin became rough and damp to the touch, bust seemed to <br />
stop for the time being. Unfortunately the changer had stopped there, as a pressure began to build in <br />
her shirt. It only took a glimpse down to see that her modest breasts had begun to grow, her cleavage <br />
now fighting its way through her top.<br />
<br />
The pressure became unbearable as they stretched the limits of her bra. She carefully lowered her <br />
stomach mass onto her lap and quickly removed her apron.  Closing her eyes tight so not to look down   <br />
(still too afraid to look at the mysterious growth on her midsection) she franticly fumbled with the clasps <br />
of her bra, finding it harder than usual to undo, something felt wrong with her hands. Looking forward <br />
she brought her hands in front of her face and slowly opened her eyes. It took one look and her eyes <br />
began to well with tiers. Her index and middle finger had merged together, as did her ring finger and <br />
pinky and her thumb had swelled to accommodate the new digits.<br />
<br />
Tears ran down her cheeks, both from panic and pain. The swelling of her breast had not stopped and <br />
her bra was now digging into the tender flesh. Suddenly with the snap of metal the claps gave out, <br />
sending the garment flying across the room like a rubber band. Nicole closed her eyes and slowed her <br />
breathing, subdue the panic. It took all the courage she could muster, but she took a deep breath and <br />
opened her eyes looking down the front of her body.<br />
<br />
The first thing she noticed was her now massive breasts (now easily F cups) blocked most of her view. <br />
They felt swollen and full, a pressure still resting inside of them. Her nipples had also grown, now the <br />
size and length of her old thumb and red. She cradled them in her hands and found them surprisingly <br />
more sensitive than they were before, had she not been filled with fear she may have found the touch <br />
arousing. She took another deep breath and looked past her breasts. What she saw caused her to <br />
stumble backwards into the wall and slide down into a sitting position onto the floor.<br />
<br />
Between her legs lay a basketball sized mass of flesh. It was pink and had four points each the size and <br />
shape to her nipples, vanes running just under its surface just barely visible. She reached down and <br />
caressed it with her hand, brushing one of the teats. The sensation was surprising; she didn&#39;t know how <br />
to describe it but simply acted on it. She grabbed one of the points in her hand and yanked on it softly. A <br />
steady stream of white fluid shot out of its end, a feeling of relief washed over the mass like a ripple of <br />
water.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh... God...&quot; Nicole silently cried to herself &quot;OHGODOHGODOHGOD! IT&#39;S AN UDDER! I HAVE A UDDER! <br />
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN! PLEASE MAKE IT STOP, WHATEVERS HAPPENING PLEASE MAKE IT STOP!&quot;<br />
As if on queue her sneakers suddenly became very tight, their seams beginning to pop as presser built <br />
within them. Every stich gave way as her feet exploded in size, her toes merging into two fat digits. The <br />
nails became hard and black as onyx, expanding around her foot until they resembled a very obvious <br />
hoof.<br />
<br />
The final nail in the coffin of her transformation started at her newly developed hooves. Small white <br />
hairs began to sprout across her ankles; they slowly crept up her caves before swarming up her legs like <br />
a tide of white fluff. As it spread over her thighs small and large splotches of velvet red appeared, the <br />
pattern continued up her back and upper arms as the fur consumed her entire body.<br />
<br />
Nicole looked down her body once more the odd feeling having vanished, she held her breath waiting <br />
for another change but after a minute nothing happened. She knew what she was now, the udder, tail, <br />
hooves, and spots all made it painfully clear. &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m... a... cow...&quot; Nicole silently mumbled under her <br />
breath, the words getting caught in her throat. Tears began to well in her eyes as she covered her face in <br />
her hands and started sobbing. &quot;HOWD THIS EVEN HAPPEN? IT&#39;S IMPOSSIBLE!&quot; she screamed.<br />
<br />
Still crying she felt her hands being pushed away from her face. Through teary eyes she could see that <br />
her nose had broadened and extended, she franticly ran her hands over her face to discover that her <br />
nose and jaw had grown into the muzzle of a cow. She laid her hands on her lap in defeat. She sat still <br />
for a moment before drying her tears and gathering her will. She seemed to have come to terms with <br />
what had happened. She still had no idea how or why but this is how it is now.<br />
<br />
She was about to stand when the presser from her udder and breasts built again becoming painful. <br />
&quot;UGU! I CANT TAKE THIS ANY MOOOOOOOOOOORE!&quot; ignoring her involuntarymoo she<br />
grabbed one udder teat and her breast and began to massage them slowly, milk began to bead at their <br />
ends and slowly began to stream down her body and pool on the floor underneath her. The motion was <br />
deeply arousing and Nicole couldn&#39;t restrain herself from the pleasure and relief the action provided. <br />
&quot;MOOOOOOOOOO!!!&quot; she moaned passionately to herself.  <br />
<br />
Nolan was still giddy with excitement. The watch red &quot;task complete&quot; as he watched Nicole fondle <br />
herself in a puddle of her own milk. He couldn&#39;t help but feel guilty and twisted inside for putting her <br />
through the transformation, seeing the fear of a real person&#39;s life and body being turned upside down, <br />
he&#39;d never thought about it when he was viewing images and comics online but it put knots in his <br />
stomach. On the other hand, the whole sight had been incredibly hot and sexy. It took every ounce of <br />
his being to keep from blowing his cover. Everything at once was making it hard for him to think or <br />
figure out what to do next</p>
