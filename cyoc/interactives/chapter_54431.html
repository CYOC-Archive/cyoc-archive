<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">AN: Okay's here's part two of two. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Penny asked leaning towards Amy as best as she could with having a <br />
pair of useless legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;it's much faster to show you rather than tell you, I'll be right back Penny-San!&quot; Amy <br />
bowed and ran back into the house, Penny given a clear view of Amy's brush like tail <br />
swinging over her butt. 'I guess I'm going to have to get used to that... or not if I've been <br />
seeing naked people with fur my whole life of course I won't think it's weird... no one else <br />
is ...' <br />
<br />
That was when it hit Penny... 'DANGIT! Now if I want something I need to roar at Kirk or <br />
drag myself across the lawn!!' Penny hissed to herself.  At least from what Penny smelled, <br />
the home owners and guests didn't use the front lawn as a bathroom... so things could <br />
have been worse... <br />
<br />
With little other choice, and with technically not needing anything at the moment, Penny <br />
watched the game between the pups... 'Those giant bust statues are so tacky and sexist.. I <br />
guess when you're rich you can afford to be tacky and sexist.' Penny might have fainted if <br />
she had learned it was the very straight heterosexual Alpha Female of the Big Bad Wolf <br />
pack who had 'ordered and commissioned' the fountain heads as an obvious tribute to her <br />
anime fetish. <br />
<br />
In spite of being perhaps the most normal cub there, Mary was proving to be quite the <br />
little commando though Nane and And Gretchen were still avoiding anything other than <br />
half-hearted pot shots at each other like supposedly 'opposing' AI characters in a game <br />
where all the AI targeted the human regardless of it supposedly being a free for all and <br />
when unable to do so mulled about like slugs. <br />
<br />
The pups for the most part were being forced to play defensively now, being careful to <br />
avoid falling for another kamikaze attack, and had basically taken the fountain as their <br />
base, the statues strangely providing seemingly good cover, almost as if the statues were <br />
blocking for them. This forced the cubs to rely on the hose to refill, slower, and only one <br />
at a time. <br />
<br />
Saba and Paula's wresting match was well underway with Kirk watching... Paula actually <br />
somehow managing to use her smaller size to a slight advantage, of course, Saba just had <br />
more experience. <br />
<br />
Amy came out of the mansion, her almost glowing white fur now covered in dust and her <br />
red brush stroke marks looking like blood smears due to the dirt covering her now. Amy <br />
came straight to Penny to see what she was holding. <br />
<br />
&quot;You want to have a tea party with me?&quot; Penny blinked in surprise. <br />
<br />
&quot;No Penny-San, I want you to use your power to free this man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What... you.. you're, you're kidding!&quot; Penny stared at the ancient teapot.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not. This man was once the chief of police in nineteen-thirty-five.  That was when <br />
in the original timeline the Great Uncle of Jennifer Smith, Jesse Smith, used Transform or <br />
Dare, to turn the current chief of police into an antique tea pot that was worth a small <br />
fortune and sold it off to sustain the Smiths through the depression after their shares <br />
deflated on the stark market crash a week after some of Glendale's population got the idea <br />
of getting ride of the curse by simply wasting turns outside of Glendale...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to be joking.&quot; Penny shook her head, 'Why am I even still surprised anymore?'<br />
<br />
&quot;Please stop saying that Penny-San. Jesse Smith would go on to become Glendale's chief of <br />
police, the truth of what he had done wouldn't be discovered until some time after <br />
nineteen-seventy-eight, after Jesse Smith died of old age... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about this timeline?&quot; Penny had to ask. <br />
<br />
&quot;Much the same sadly... the Big Bad Wolf pack member Gamma-Jesse used the game, got <br />
a small treasure that was once a human being, and got money for it to keep the Pack's <br />
earnings afloat until the end of the Great Depression. No one found out what he had done <br />
until he was dead and in the ground. And the teapot had found it's way back into the <br />
Pack's possession. It's been remembered then forgotten and repeat ever since then Penny-<br />
San.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And no thought to try and cure the poor person to see if he was still alive?&quot;<br />
<br />
 <br />
&quot;An antique tea-pot can't answer answer 'transform or dare' so the 'one minute if you <br />
DON'T' answer opposed to 'CAN'T' answer applied... same with the art victims over the <br />
years...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So once either of us use our power, the man becomes a person again instead of a tea <br />
pot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's a person right now, he just can't speak to us. But yes, he'll be flesh and blood again. <br />
But he'll also have always been either a part of the Pride or the Pack from 1935.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny thought, &quot;...Maybe it would be better if he became part of the Pack... right now the <br />
Pride and Pack are at peace with each other... if someone from the Pack turned someone <br />
from the Pride into something just for money... it might have sparked a blood feud.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if he had been a member of the Pack, that means he was betrayed by a member of <br />
his own family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit, if only we could ASK HIM what HE wants...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can assume, safely, for the moment, he doesn't want to remain a teapot until it's <br />
smashed, gather dust in the attic or basement...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you want me to use my power, and I want you to use your power...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if we used it at once?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... That might open so big a can of worms that reality might finally decide we're all not <br />
worth keeping and just forget any of us ever existed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't help but think it would be interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we both know the saying about 'interesting times.'&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny just nodded. &quot;And the other statue victims scattred across Glendale who never <br />
made it to the gallery or were shipped out of Glendale? What about them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;..They are yours... they'll be part of the pack... I won't fight over people's lives... The Pride <br />
will enable them to keep more of their original lives.. It is better that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny thought about it, &quot;Yes it is...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy then shifted the topic away from the game victim she was holding in her hands, &quot;SO <br />
if you want the memories gone, why have you written it all down?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why have you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because even if it's brushed off as a fictionalization of events, people like our friends and <br />
family deserve to know what sacrifices where made in saving the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are no other curses are there? Are they? No sleeping time bombs waiting to warp <br />
the planet into slaves or maniacs are there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a relief.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thouhg.. if the game has been directing into itself and eating up all the magic in this <br />
immediate corner of the cosmos to sustain itself and make true all it's twists to reality... <br />
the curse's death will let magic naturally return to the planet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, it's rather natural to how things are in most of the rest of the universe, magic's a <br />
natural part of creation. Most simply are ignorant of that: Due to Glendale's curse eating it <br />
all up for itself over three hundred years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, it'll be gradual, there will be time for culture and people to adapt.&quot; 'Much like <br />
the one thousand year Leoman shift, IF it even happens.' <br />
<br />
&quot;How can you be so sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just am.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And we're still left with the teapot whose a person who needs their life back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So everyone in the pack and pride know what Gamma-Jesse did?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More or less. The young children of course don't know, I'm not -supposed- to know. The <br />
police in this timeline know, and so do all the adult Pack and Pride members... but we do <br />
have one thing on our side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The 'Anthropic Principle' Penny-San.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't major in philosophy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not precisely philosophy. It's states that the conditions for sentient life in the universe <br />
must exist because we exist. In other words, BECAUSE the Cubs and Pubs are playing a <br />
PEACEFUL FRIENDLY GAME right now, and Pack and Pride are looking after each other after <br />
a battle they joined together to fight without a second thought, that must mean they ARE <br />
at peace with each other and DO have good relations with each other. And the simple fact <br />
for reality it would simpler to keep the Pack and Pride at peace than start a blood feud.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.... and being part of my pride, means the man gets to keep more of his life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Hand me him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy placed the antique teapot into Penny out stretched paws. And in the shade of the <br />
crabapple tree, her disable legs laying on the grass, the sun setting, and the stars coming <br />
out, Penny stroked the teapot speaking her chant. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are a Leoman, a part of the Pride, you always been a Leoman, you have always been <br />
part of the Pride, will always be a Leoman, will always be part of the Pride, you are not <br />
human, were never human, could never be human.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Amy meanwhile thought of the first verse of the 1939 nursery rhythm, [i] &lt;i&gt;  &quot;I'm a little <br />
teapot,<br />
Short and stout,<br />
Here is my handle,<br />
Here is my spout,<br />
When I get all steamed up,<br />
Hear me shout,<br />
Tip me over and pour me out!&quot;  [/i] &lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
The teapot's color began changing from porcelain white and pink to copper, and grew <br />
large, Penny quickly put it down and dragged herself away from it taking her notes with <br />
her.  The handle broke off at the bottom and stretched out, the spout closed off and <br />
moved upwards, the opening of the kettle closed and the inside began to fill in and three <br />
extensions grew from below the teapot's body as it tilted over on the grass.  The teapot <br />
grew larger, and larger, and larger, the clay clearly now flesh with bone within it and <br />
copper fur covering it. The semi-spherical shape of the pot squished and stretched out, <br />
the grip of the teapot's lid growing larger, with a brass colored mane surrounding the <br />
head. The teapot grew from the size of a teddy bear, then a child, then a grown human <br />
being, then a full adult Lupman and just kept on growing!  The spout and handle now had <br />
fingers, with retractable claws on the end. The two extensions of the base had now paws <br />
and claws of their own, while tail began to wish about. Penny say a split appear on the <br />
bottom of the teapot's base and immediately knew what it was as the Leoman lay face <br />
down in the grass as his muzzle pushed out of the teapot grip along his ears, eyes, and <br />
other features. Penny watched as his muscled form like being sculpted from an ever <br />
growing mass of clay from the flex of his haunches and the small of his back, 'He's so hot!' <br />
Penny thought, thought about what she thought, and realized there was no dang point in <br />
even pretending to fight anymore and just went with it. <br />
<br />
Still growing and forming, Amy began to push on his side, to pathetically unspectacular <br />
results, &quot;Penny-San help me turn him over, he is -your- Pride after all...&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny simply nodded and using the strength in her arms helped Penny turn him over and <br />
she got a good look at his sheath before looking at his chiseled like muscular chest and <br />
finally his face framed by brass colored mane. <br />
<br />
'Kirk's still nicer though.' Penny thought. <br />
<br />
His chest rose and fell, he opened his eyes, yellow like many leoman's, and gasped out, <br />
tasting the air, &quot;Are.... you the one who saved me?.... Am I, is this a dream? Am I dead?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. No. No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you... &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you move?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's been so long, I haven't needed to... since.. since that day..&quot; He croaked out <br />
remembering how his vocal cords worked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your muscles shouldn't be atrophied,&quot; Amy said, &quot;You just need to -use- them.&quot;<br />
<br />
The copper lion man nodded, and before Penny's eyes with what seemed Herculean effort <br />
like a toddler learning how to walking, he sat up, breathing in deep, feeling his lungs <br />
inflate.. &quot;I'd long since given up hole... how long, how long?&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny whispered in his ear. <br />
<br />
The lion man gasped, &quot;I knew, but I didn't want to believe, then again, I had given up... &quot;<br />
<br />
'This club isn't for everyone.' Kira commented from her view at the fountain. <br />
<br />
'In particular for those -forced- into it.' Helen said.<br />
<br />
'We were.' Nelson/Nessie pointed out.<br />
<br />
'But we came back by choice.' Michelle said.<br />
<br />
'Well if he finds the modern world too much he'll find his way to us.' Kira said. 'And if he <br />
doesn't, well, I'm sure the other Leomans won't mind another 'time traveller' in the Pride.'<br />
<br />
Penny finally roared out, &quot;GRANDMOTHER! THERE'S SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TO MEET YOU!&quot;<br />
<br />
The great white lioness strutted foreword, wondering what the sudden drama was. She <br />
saw the tired looking male sitting next to Penny.  She didn't recognize him at once, but <br />
something about the leoman was familiar... something long ago for the older than old <br />
lioness who had live far longer than the human being she had never been lived.  Was she <br />
or was she not on four legs yet? She couldn't remember precisely... <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you...&quot; The leoman said in surprise and shock seeing the giant lioness coming towards <br />
him, &quot;Are you, is you really--&quot;<br />
<br />
Mother Glen herself however was being shocked herself, &quot;You.. impossible... what-is-your <br />
name?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;G-Gillian.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Gillian What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gillian II Daleson!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Gill! My GIll is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Marilyn?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Mother Glen now, legally on my ID...But-but-but-what happened? Why are you--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Penny's power freed him.&quot; Penny said simply. <br />
<br />
Mother Glen instantly began to nuzzle the uber pale beige lioness, &quot;OH PENNY! You <br />
wonderful! Wonderful girl!&quot; Mother Glen licked her like she was still a kitten. Mother then <br />
went back to nuzzling Gillian who was partially a limp doll under her show of affection. <br />
<br />
'Looks like that one won't be joining us any time soon.' Helen observed.<br />
<br />
'Oh well, plenty of other fish in the sea.' Kira mentally shrugged the statues silently <br />
grinning. <br />
<br />
Penny and Amy both breathed a sigh of relief when nothing changed regarding the Pack <br />
and Pride's good relationship, that was the last complication anyone needed. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
At the home of the police chief of Glendale, the three fourths Native American turned in <br />
his sleep.  So many of his men were now women who went around naked except for their <br />
badges and equipment belts and were nine feet tall covered in fur!  And of course, per the <br />
rules of the stupid game, nobody but him, and Serenity and whoever else even realized <br />
human beings were supposed to be the only sentient life on the planet! <br />
<br />
&quot;There's times I wish this stupid curse -didn't- make it so-ugh.&quot; 'No matter how many <br />
times reality gets screwed with, I remember perfectly how it was and I don't get a bit of a <br />
clue how to live in the new version.'  Gill noticed the room seemed to be getting bright <br />
and raised his hand thinking it was impossible since the sun had finally gone down... <br />
<br />
Gill saw the copper colored fur growing on his hand, he only had one response to this, &quot;Oh <br />
fudge.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gill sat up, felt some weight on his chest, looked down, and said, &quot;Double fudge.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you worried?&quot; Madam Serenity asked in the alchemy lab beneath the church drinking <br />
a cub of coffee.<br />
<br />
&quot;About what?&quot; Father Mike asked holding a fask with his monkey's tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;With reality altering around the people turn into lions, wolves, cat  people, statue <br />
monsters, and -dragons- doesn't that mean you and your brother might end up being <br />
born the way you are instead of being victims of the curse?&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Paul stopped what he was doing and Judas looked up from where he was watching. <br />
Father Paul decidedly did NOT want to end up just a fancy trained Orangutan, he had <br />
trouble enough being accepted as a person. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll admit,&quot; Father Mike said, &quot;It is a horrid possibility, but I am not worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Father Paul, Madam Serenity and Judas all said together in their respect means of <br />
'speaking.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Anthropic Principle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Refresh my memory to what that is.&quot; The detective/fortune teller/alchemist/retired police <br />
officer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Myself and my brother are still victims of the curse. And if we had not been victims of the <br />
curse, then we would have not have been in a position to finally accept it's existence as <br />
my Exorcist father did, and thus discover, translate, and create the cure. If we had not <br />
been victims of the curse. In short, my brother and I HAVE to be victims of the curse, or <br />
we would not be here creating amounts of the cure here with you, but we are, so <br />
therefore, we have to be curse victims.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity after years dealing with the game wasn't sure how to deal with that kind <br />
of answer, but if Father Mike was right, then at least they could focus on the cure, and if <br />
he was wrong, best they focus on completing their task before reality got around to them <br />
either way... <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Rick admitted it. Rick had wanted to start over as a little girl, it was an ideal for him. <br />
Something thought impossible that he yearned for. And as Kurse twisted things, he had <br />
hoped she'd grant that wish. Instead he was turned into a thing of pure absolute violence. <br />
And then Kurse was no more... and he was a man again, a human being... He hoped <br />
beyond hope even as he romanced Marie's mother that some lingering effect of the magic <br />
would make his wish come true. He even tried to 'Transform or Dare' himself in the mirror <br />
to no effect. He was still an adult male, not some idealized age and gender that resembled <br />
a female child. <br />
<br />
But he had to be a man and accept that. And he was going to be a father now, a man of <br />
responsibility, someone Marie and her mother were going to need! Weather he liked it or <br />
not, he had to leave such fantasies behind. HIs family was going to need him. And Marie <br />
needed him more than he needed to alter himself. And though Marie he;'d in a way have <br />
his wish as she lived her life with him and he'd be there to experience it with her. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy... will Yomato accept me just saying we were both idiots and we're even?&quot; Penny <br />
asked as Mother Glen and Gillian caught up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Never. Your mistakes are not his mistakes. That's like that. He'll demand that any <br />
compensation must be your decision and come purely from you.&quot; 'He's as harsh to himself <br />
as he is towards others... ' Amy remembered the fiasco when it brought up that Amy -<br />
might- have been Yomato's child like some horrid soap opera! Yomato had been VERY <br />
harsh on those who had soiled on his honor.' <br />
<br />
&quot;And if I give him a slap on the wrist?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He'll either think you're joking or insulting him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotcha... &quot; Penny thought for a minute and drudged up what little she knew about <br />
Japanese culture, &quot;Tell him that until he heels, one of his she-wolves is to be with me as <br />
my arms and legs until I heal, and if he heals before I do, he'll take over the position <br />
himself until I walk again, at which point, the debt is wiped clean. Will he accept that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded, &quot;Yes, he will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good... &quot; Realistically Penny was perfectly happy with Kirk being with her, but she didn't <br />
want the lupman Yomato to kill himself over what in this timeline had been just stupidity <br />
on both sides... <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll tell him at once... the sooner it's done, the sooner he'll stop contemplating Seppuku.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glade...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy bowed and rushed into the house, taking a glance at her pink furred brother, who <br />
seemed to be finding his inner courage with help from Pence. Amy smiled, 'She was a <br />
wonderful wife. He'll make a great man one day.' <br />

<br />
&quot;It was a good thing for the witchling that the Pack did not come to Glendale all that <br />
often, otherwise the two pack members they had harmed might recognize Goldwyn as the <br />
girl who had been trespass on their property and had attacked a pack member... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they didn't look for her afterwards?&quot; Betty asked. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Princess did a fair job of covering their scent on their way back. And they ultimately <br />
concluded that predators had beaten them to the punch lacking anything remotely <br />
resembling another logical theory.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha said, &quot;Didn't think of magic or simple tricks to cover their scent?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They did, but again, Princess was able to keep Goldwyn from being noticed, and the <br />
wolves didn't really both looking all that hard in the praying town, and remember, the girls <br />
were slowly building one layer of enchantment on top of another on local authorities to <br />
make themselves and their activities invisible to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilly asked the obvious question sitting with her father, &quot;What happened next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They went back to their studies, both mundane and arcane. Joseph, of course DID teach <br />
Goldwyn about using her sixth sense. Losing an eye was, of course, an even worse <br />
condition than it was then. He knew she had to learn to compensate with her sixth sense <br />
from her loss of perception and decreased range of vision.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did half of her face really look like a skull?&quot; Casandra had to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet. By the time that happened, she was firmly Gogatha rather than Goldwyn. But <br />
before any of that happened, both of Goldwyn's sisters had to find their familiars. Gita <br />
would find hers first. Griselle would meet hers exactly a year later. In that time, all would <br />
practice their magic and learn about the real world, and become more convinced their idea <br />
was the right idea with every word they read... they even hated the rule you had to start a <br />
new line when writing whenever you quoted a character.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone looked at each other at that one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turning evil and bad grammar...&quot; Maddex noted. <br />
<br />
&quot;And Marie, I mean Marie Cruz? She'd go through much the same I take it?&quot; Lawrence said, <br />
noticing the parallels between Goldwyn and Marie's life events. <br />
<br />
&quot;Her sixth sense would be more self taught, not having a prophet most of the time to <br />
teach her, and it would develop differently, as different as Marie was from Goldwyn.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++   <br />
<br />
&quot;It was now 1674, and the blond Gita the eldest was now ten years old. Girls enter <br />
puberty faster than boys, and Gita was closing in on the age where she'd enter the flux <br />
between child and woman. The black haired Goldwyn had begun to grow her hair longer so <br />
as to cover her lost eye. But at the same time, she over the last year now moved with <br />
almost the same sureness as if she had both. <br />
<br />
&quot;The family had dared enter the market at Glendale for much needed supplies. Griselle <br />
found another drunkard, and turned him into a nice perfectly happy cloth girl dolly, and in <br />
retrospect did the same to his wife and child who Goldwyn had pointed out were nearby. <br />
The girls had become a warped clean up crew of sorts, anyone who didn't find a job quick <br />
enough to came to Glendale found themselves the subject of the girls' 'compassion.' The <br />
dollies would spend their happily little existences until wear and tear released their spirits <br />
in the arms of children in the praying town. The locals had also noticed children were <br />
growing a little bit slower than they should be. Subjects of Gita's peaceful and careful <br />
experiments (not wanting a repeat of Joella) in trying to prevent children from growing up. <br />
One failed experience made a child age backwards and they had quickly turned him and <br />
his mother into a pregnant fertility totem to prevent him from de-aging back into an <br />
separate egg and sperm. The father became a happy teddy bear that through a spell of <br />
fate would never be far from the totem. <br />
<br />
&quot;Traveling through the town was a small caravan of relatively exotic animals. Most of them <br />
at an age that was illogical for them to be separated from the parents, most of those <br />
wouldn't survive long, and naturally, this business by the same virtue wouldn't last long if <br />
it continued to sell short lived products. Where most of them came from was anyone's <br />
guess, and most of the people in Glendale wanted absolute nothing with the men who <br />
owned the tiny caravan and hoped he did what little business he and his men had here and <br />
moved along! <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course the girls were curious, and so was Running-Bear, though he could see that <br />
many of the animals were unhappy, he knew if he did anything, he would be punished and <br />
the animal would still be miserable. <br />
<br />
&quot;The caravan owner introduced himself as &quot;Victor, seller of anything that moves.&quot; Though <br />
even he admitted he wasn't sure where some of the animal came from, having traded <br />
handlers at least twice by the time he bought them. <br />
<br />
Princess looked at the small collection of oddly colored and patterned cats, looking at <br />
them with a 'I'm on the other side of these bars and you're not!' expression that her <br />
master didn't see. <br />
<br />
Gita looked at the animals, looking for something she knew not what. She went from one <br />
small cage to the next. Until at last she saw a snake... it was big, but at the same time it <br />
looked somehow young in spite looking like it was eat a garden snake whole. She looked <br />
at it, and the one year old boa looked back. It's scales were all red. This alone made the <br />
puritans not want to get near it, much like Princess and her black fur. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Gita whispered, she had seen this snake before, it was smaller then. <br />
<br />
She didn't react all that strangely when the snake spoke back to her, &quot;You may call me <br />
what you wish, but you must also tell me my true name...&quot;<br />
<br />
Gita looked back at Princess and Goldwyn, she knew Goldwyn was close to figuring out <br />
Princess' real name, using her sixth sense to find it. Gita looked back at the snake, &quot;Okay, <br />
I'll call you... Daisy until I know what your real name is...&quot; The snake whose true name was <br />
Lilith bowed it head, &quot;As you wish, I'll stay with you if you wish to know my true name.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gita stood up and pointed at the cage, &quot;I want this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man looked at the girl, then at Running-Bear, who looked at Gita, the man explained <br />
the price. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's impossible.&quot; It was easily more than Running-Bear could afford.<br />
<br />
&quot;But she wants to be with me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad.&quot; Said Victor, &quot;You can't pay, can't have her, them's the rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
That word alone made Gita's blood boil. <br />
<br />
With their foster father right there however, they had to be patient. The girls hated that <br />
even more. <br />
<br />
The girls had it down to a routine now of one of them distracting their foster father with <br />
princess running interference while the other two went about their charity work. <br />
<br />
Gita and Griselle made their way back to the market, and met with Victor again at once. <br />
<br />
&quot;Give me Daisy, she's my friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
The large bald mustached Victor looked surprisingly sympathetic, &quot;Too bad kid, look, I <br />
went to a lot of trouble moving these animals and feeding them and looking after them <br />
and buying them in the first place, it's not fair for me to just give them to you, I gotta eat <br />
too ya know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... you do... it's not fair you need to do all this to eat it seems...&quot; Gita called upon the <br />
infinite chaos, actually reaching into the cage and touching Daisy. <br />
<br />
Victor was paralyzed, he couldn't move, scream, or shout, only think and maybe move his <br />
eyeballs. He felt his clothes turn to dust, he saw the world getting smaller, he felt the fur <br />
covering his entire body, he felt his fingers fusing together... and he felt his manhood of <br />
which he was quite proud invert on itself and things inside him changed... When the <br />
paralysis ended he suddenly was on all fours. He, she, looked at the children very scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Run along now, Veronica...&quot; Said Griselle kindly... &quot;You'll find lots of friends...&quot; <br />
<br />
The feeling of being exposed and helpless becoming overwhelming Victor fled the scary <br />
humans. Victor's men came looking for their loyal boss a couple minutes later and soon <br />
Midge, Betty, and Nacy and a freed slave now named Abungu... By the time Swift-Hoof's <br />
Herd found the new scared and confused doe fawns, the had wandered too close to the <br />
Wolf Estate, and Abungu had her neck torn out and her heart eaten by a pub making their <br />
first pub as their passage into becoming a man. The witchlings knew none of them, as far <br />
as they were concerned they had saved five poor people from the world of adults and <br />
rules.  <br />
<br />
After failing to find the keys and finally breaking the lock, Gita reached out her arm and <br />
look the baby boa up her arm without fear. &quot;Welcome home Daisy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes my master.&quot; The snake replied. <br />
<br />
Princess made a note to indoctrinate 'Daisy' about the glorious destiny their masters were <br />
set for.  The girls absent-mindedly left the rest of the caged animals to their fates. <br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get that snake?&quot; Of course their foster father asked.<br />
<br />
Gita produced a simple lie about Victor having a change of heart and simply giving it to <br />
them. <br />
<br />
The blond Griselle pouted in her room that night at the unfairness of it, both her sisters <br />
now had their special friend except her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry.&quot; Gita promised her sister, &quot;I'm sure you'll find your familiar in no time.&quot; It <br />
would be precisely another year until the crow whose true name was Solome would come <br />
in contact with it's master Griselle.</p>
