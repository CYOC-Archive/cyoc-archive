<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I laid on the bed, pushing and moaning. My contractions getting bigger. My Mate, my husband, Tal. He was by my side, holding my hand. So big and strong, a fine man. <br />
<br />
In just a few moments, one of our destinies would be greatly altered. The healers were down between my legs, reaching for the baby. <br />
<br />
I pushed hard one more time, screaming out as I do. <br />
And then, there he is, my beautiful baby. <br />
Tal shuts his eyes and sighs. <br />
<br />
Its a boy, that means its going to be him. <br />
<br />
Tal leaves my side, tall and proud, he never looks back. That&#39;s just the way he is. He&#39;s a warrior, stern and firm. That&#39;s what I loved about him. <br />
<br />
Tal walked over to out baby. He put one hand on him, and fulfilled our Tribes tradition. His body steadily glowed. <br />
<br />
He leaned back as his body turned to a golden dust, dissolving away. Tal was gone. <br />
<br />
Half of the gold dust went into our son, the rest arose to the Heavens above. As was with all first born. <br />
<br />
Had our child been born a girl, It would of been me. <br />
<br />
My son was wrapped up and handed to me, I held him tightly to my chest. <br />
Trig. That&#39;s the name Tal and I had chosen. Now Trig and Tal were one with each other,as a part of my husband was now apart of Trig. <br />
------<br />
We lived in one of the medium huts in our village, It wasn&#39;t anything special, but it was home. Others greeted me as I brought Trig home. I wasn&#39;t sure how ready I was for this. And I didn&#39;t know how ready Trig would be, but we would both have to be. <br />
<br />
I changed him and fed him with my breast. He was so peaceful, and quiet, rarely crying. We had a room ready for him. Tal built the bed himself. It could be adjusted for any age. Right now it was good for a cradle. <br />
<br />
It would be perfect for him. <br />
<br />
One night, about a week after I brought him home, I laid him in his cradle, and kissed him good night, then retired for the night myself. <br />
<br />
The next morning, I awoke and went to get him. But when I looked into the cradle, no longer was he a newborn infant. He was now a toddler, around 2 years old. His clothing had ripped as it was too small on him now. <br />
<br />
It had begun. As was tradition. <br />
-----<br />
Trig&#39;s mind developed with his growth, he was quick to crawl, and in a few days later, he began walking. <br />
I worked with him on speaking. He managed a few utters at first, but worked his way to a few words. <br />
<br />
I still continued to feed him, using actual food this time. But one day before his next change, he began to feed himself. Picking up the food and eating it. <br />
<br />
In the middle of the night, I heard him groaning. I went to his room to find he had grown again, to age 5. <br />
<br />
He turned to look at me. &quot;M..mooo..mother.&quot; He muttered. His mind had aged once again. <br />
I retrieved him some larger clothing. <br />
<br />
I decided he needed to interact of other children. I took him out to a large field outside of the Village where other children tended to play. <br />
<br />
Other parents were there, I found a group of children who were about Trig&#39;s current age. It didn&#39;t take him long to interact with them and began playing, as was common with children at that age. <br />
<br />
Some of the other Children were first born. So they would have much in common with Trig as they too were rapidly aging. <br />
<br />
I gathered with other Mothers and Fathers. They were most impressed with how my boy was getting along with the others. <br />
<br />
I thought about how that part of him could be Tal, the part of him that became one with Trig. <br />
<br />
Trig made friends that day, something that made me very happy. He would surly become a fine warrior. <br />
----<br />
A Year had gone by since Trig was born. But he was already a 10 year old boy. <br />
<br />
I watched from afar as The trainers taught Trig how to use a spear properly as well as a bow and arrow. He got a few scrapes and bruises but quickly picked up on it. For it would be his duty to help protect the Tribe and all of us once he was complete. <br />
<br />
I certainly saw a lot of Tal in him, which made me very excited for what was to come. <br />
<br />
After training, he had gotten rather dirty. I decided it was a good time for a bath. We went to the bathing pool. Trig went to one spot, while I bathed behind some rocks not far off. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t think I noticed but I did. He took several quick glances at me from behind the rocks. My back was turned to him but I knew, it put a small smile on my face. <br />
I was glad to know I was still beautiful. <br />
<br />
I wondered if Trig had figured it out yet, or started to notice. What he was going to become to me. What his friends were becoming to their remaining parents. As was Tradition. <br />
<br />
The water was warm and Trig was relaxed. He hardly felt himself growing again, this time to age 13.<br />
-----<br />
Two weeks later, Trig asked to go to a small gathering that his friends had planed. They had all reached 13 as well and it was a custom for all First Born who reached that age to throw a little celebration together. <br />
<br />
Of course I agreed and he headed out with the rest of his friends. I knew not of what went on at these Celebrations as I was not a First Born. <br />
<br />
I&#39;ve heard it was when all First Born went on their first hunting trip with one of the village elders. It was a great experience for them or so I&#39;ve heard. <br />
<br />
In short, Trig was almost a natural at hunting. He had a lot of Tal in him, the piece of his soul gave him a good amount of skill. <br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t be more proud of him<br />
-----<br />
A month later, Trig grew again. He became a 17 year old. His body had begun to fill out more. He gained a small amount of muscle all around his body, he was as tall as me. His face was changing and his voice had gotten a little more deeper. <br />
<br />
He was starting to look like Tal. I was most impressed with how he was turning out. It wouldn&#39;t be much longer now. <br />
 <br />
He began noticing me more, now that his mind was much more mature. By now he had learned what his true purpose was, what I was raising him to become, as did all the other First Born. <br />
<br />
They knew what they had to do, they became increasingly loyal to their signal parents. As was Tradition. <br />
-----<br />
A few months later, The Village held the Grand festival, held once a year at the center of the Village. The whole tribe attended. <br />
<br />
A large fire was ignited in the center as the Tribe gathered around and danced and ate and had a great time. <br />
<br />
Trig and I arrived together, he found his friends, at least two of them were fully grown by now, as I found my own friends. <br />
<br />
It was a grand evening, everyone loved it. I began to dance on my own, Trig noticed and matched me. Together we danced. He took my hands and held me close as we danced a traditional Tribal dance.<br />
<br />
In the light of the Fire, He looked just like Tal. <br />
<br />
We broke away and I turned around for a moment to greet one of my friends. When I turned back around, Trig was nowhere to be seen. <br />
<br />
I asked one of his friends, She told me he went off towards the forest. He looked like he was going to be sick. <br />
<br />
Worried, I headed off after him. <br />
-----<br />
I lit a torch and found his tracks, Tal had taught me how to track, but I hoped it wouldn&#39;t be to much needed. <br />
<br />
Sure enough, I was right.  <br />
<br />
Trig was on the ground against a tree, he was keeled over clutching his stomach and groaning in pain. <br />
<br />
I knew what this was, my heart caught in my throat. It was time. <br />
<br />
He was getting hot for he removed his top. There was a pole for holding torches near by, I stuck my torch there and hurried by his side. <br />
<br />
I got down on my knees in front of him as he leaned forward. He looked right at me with a worried look and my eyes widened as his face began to contort and deform. His whole face elongated with a sickening crack as he hunched over hiding it from me. <br />
<br />
I gently placed a hand on his back as sort of a calm way to assure him it would be okay. <br />
<br />
With a stretching noise, he began growing one last time. He became bigger than me rather quickly. His arms and legs throbbed as they became larger with muscle. His torso began expanding, becoming bulkier and stronger, he was becoming like his father. <br />
<br />
His groans became deeper and manlier as he gripped the ground with his growing hands. <br />
<br />
This went on for several minutes, until it was all over and Trig collapsed. Breathing heavily. <br />
<br />
Thanks to my instincts, I was smart to grab a blanket form the Camp when I went to find him. I threw it over his body as he steadily began to rise up. <br />
<br />
I backed away and marveled at his large form. He stood up, towering over me. He looked up and I could see his face in a torch light. <br />
<br />
His jaw was wider, his features were hardened and mature, his eyes looked tough and he looked determined. Now he and I were the same age, Trig was a man now. My mate. As was Tradition. <br />
<br />
Still somewhat weak, I helped escort him back to our Hut. <br />
We passed by the Campfire on our way home, yet no one seemed to notice us as a few other First Born were going through their last changes as well. <br />
<br />
One boy was laying on his mother&#39;s lap as his body was steadily growing, he was painfully groaning. A Girl was on her knees as she steadily grew taller with her father right by her side while her robes ripped down her back. <br />
<br />
The two of us hurried along and made it back to our Hut. <br />
I guided Trig to my bed, our bed and had him lay down. <br />
<br />
I laid next to my new mate. <br />
-----<br />
Trig became a fine warrior and Mate to me. He was one of the strongest Hunters our tribe had. The night after his last transformation, he felt the tenderness of a woman for the first time. He was everything I needed, the right amount of gentle and aggressive.  <br />
<br />
A few years passed and I had given birth to two children. As these were my second and third born, Neither me or Trig had to go. And the children would age at a normal rate as any other human would. <br />
<br />
Two daughters, Atta and Enna. They were two years apart and became the best of sisters. <br />
<br />
Trig and his First Born friends formed a hunting team, Three Hunters and two Huntresses. And when an Enemy tribe attacked us, Trig and his team saved the day with out losing anyone. <br />
<br />
I saw this as Tal watching over him and us. <br />
<br />
I lost one Mate, but gained a new one in Trig as did the other First Born. <br />
<br />
And our Village was fortunate to have Strong warriors to protect them all. <br />
<br />
As was Tradition.</p>
