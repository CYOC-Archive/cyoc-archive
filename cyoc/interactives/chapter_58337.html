<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two stone cherubs merely stood guard. It was considered an even worse taboo for <br />
gargoyles to cheat death by transferring into a new body once they had reached <br />
'adulthood' than it was to transfer the spirit of a flesh and blood being into the vessel of a <br />
gargoyle. <br />
<br />
And Free and Equality, were simply happy that they had lived long enough to see the end of <br />
the curse that had plagued their Man companions centuries before. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Judias' considered going to his Bast dogmatic siblings and scaring the tails off them with <br />
his newfound power. 'But that's not exactly the Christian things to do is it?' Thought the <br />
Catholic cat. 'And the days of converting others with displays of power have come and <br />
gone.' <br />
<br />
Eliza, due to her mental link with her child, knew much. Eliza and Marie still had different <br />
souls and separate Egos however (while Julie, Fran, and Darla considered their sense of <br />
similar self a badge of honor). And Eliza said simply, &quot;Now now, she may now be the most <br />
powerful being in the world, but she's still my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blond pups, Maddex's heads, Betty and Lawrence all looked at the victorian era <br />
dressed human. <br />
<br />
&quot;And we can stay in, oh right, Glendale until this awful business with the curse is over, and <br />
the all seem like very good people. But Marie and I don't exist in a void. We're on a <br />
vacation, so we're free to spend it where we like.  But after that I have a job back home, <br />
sadly on the other side of the planet, and I have family and friends there. Just a my Marie <br />
does.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice stayed silent, Samantha and Abbey started. They didn't want to be rude, but they <br />
really hadn't considered the idea that Marie had friends or a place to be already. <br />
<br />
&quot;I said I didn't have a pack, I didn't say I didn't say I didn't have people who thought about <br />
me each day… I couldn't ask your friends, family, and all the rest to simply move to the <br />
other side of the world. And I can't ask my school mates, teachers, or grandparents, all to <br />
move to Glendale . . . besides, in the world within all mirrors, everywhere is just three steps <br />
away remember? We can visit each other like we lived across the street anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
THe three blond pups, one wearing the dress of the famous Alice, and the two smaller <br />
ones wearing inverted versions of it, started and looked at each other, they HAD forgotten <br />
that! <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza was also trying to keep it from her mother's mind that she was realistically <br />
considering staying in the mirror world as much as possible so she wouldn't spend as <br />
much time as immortal glass. 'Though that would mean limiting my interact with people <br />
which wouldn't be a good thing. I could bring my toys with souls here… I created so many <br />
when I got this power, I was so reckless and inconsiderate on how they were people and <br />
not just toys who could think back…  But what about all my other friends back home? No <br />
easy answers. No cheap and fast solution.' <br />
<br />
Marie's avatar with Judas assuming the guise of a bronze lupman pup statue observed the <br />
injured, hurt and recovering lupmans.  'With just a gesture of power I could heal all of <br />
them . . .  but for what purpose? None of their lives are in danger. All of them are going to <br />
recover anyway. And if I healed just them, my next logical step would be to heal everyone <br />
at Glendale's hospital. And the one after that, and the one after that… ' Marie knew that <br />
the first taste of using her power would be all it would take to start down the sliding slop.  <br />
She also knew to any outsider observer with a shred of sanity or compassion she'd look like <br />
a ice hearted brat. 'After all, less police means more eager criminals, and that means more <br />
people hurt . . . what shall I do about that? Be a super hero until I decide to cut out the <br />
middle man and be judge and jury and remake criminals into useful members of society by <br />
either turning them into slaves and over-writing the person they already are?' <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza had a new appreciation for God. 'The problem with being all powerful… is <br />
doing anything.' <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza's avatar considered granting Rick's demented wish of becoming a little girl, or <br />
separating that desire from him and turning it into a twin of her. But Marie didn't trust <br />
herself with this power, and she didn't dare trust someone else. And a girl born from a <br />
wish of escapism wouldn't be exactly restrictive on such god like power. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
In one of the many doorless bathrooms of the manor Anne checked the test results… this <br />
was the forth test.  Lupman had perhaps the single least amount of modesty and sense of <br />
shame ingrained into them and their culture as any of the races of men (gargoyles were <br />
humanoid by convenience only), but Anne still felt a bit like hiding.   <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to be a mother . . . &quot; Anne whispered. &quot;Megan, Ashley, Margot, they were all <br />
right . . .  I am pregnant . . . &quot; Anne just hoped she could explain to the twins that they <br />
weren't being replaced.  In the storm of a thousand plots and thousand intentions, Anne's <br />
pregnancy was just a little thing, such a tiny thing. <br />
<br />
The moment Lawrence set foot outside the mirror world with help from Samantha Anne <br />
realized she needed to tell her husband and ran like mad though the mansion, finding the <br />
white wolf formally lithe now muscle bound (she wished she had done a better job of <br />
helping him realize God loved all them regardless of how they looked). <br />
<br />
She leapt into his arms at once, nearly sending him through a wall and declared, <br />
&quot;LAWRENCE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE BABIES I'M PREGNANT!&quot; <br />
<br />
Considering everything Lawrence had learned in the last few days listening to Marie-Eliza's <br />
tale (not knowing he had barely escaped ceasing to exist as Lawrence), and everything that <br />
had happened to the pack as of late. He had just one reply to that, &quot;Finally, something <br />
normal.&quot; He then kissed and hugged his wife. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto said to Monkey King. &quot;So they're going to disassemble us and <br />
place us in Amy's Shinto shrine once everyone is healed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Want to bail out? Unlike  Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto, you and  Uke Mochi <br />
aren't bound by any pregnancy and can simply LEAVE and start up your lives again in the <br />
moving world.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meh. This is the path I chose, I'm going to see it to the end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand that… and … actually I'm not scared… I'M EXCITED! I can't wait for it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't worried it's gonna be like being chopped into pieces?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little. But everything I've seen about your transformation has proven to be peaceful, <br />
calm, and serene. And we're not being broken or melted down, you said your Transform or <br />
Dare prevented that. So we're just being naturally taken apart, and being put back together. <br />
Let me try something.&quot; <br />
<br />
For a moment there were two twin statues of Sarah the she-wolf, both half the size of the <br />
original, then she was once again the likeness of Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto. <br />
<br />
&quot;And how was that dear?&quot; Monkey King asked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It didn't feel like I was being cut in two, it felt like I was simply in more than one place. <br />
Since we don't have brains, a nervous system, or eyeballs, or ears, I think our awareness is <br />
equally distributed among our forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you  Uke Mochi? It just takes a thought to walk away. Heck, you could leave <br />
and come back once the move was done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; . . .  No . . . I want to see through to the end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be silly… it's not an end! Simply a new beginning!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right, thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little over poetic but once.&quot;  Thought out Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So . . . so everything ready?&quot; Madam Serenity called, not wanting to mention to Gillie they <br />
had two cartoon horses living with them in the church at the moment.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not the mayor Serenity.&quot; Gillie said over the cellphone. &quot;But everything on my end is <br />
looking good . . . We're ready to go at the drop of a hat, and you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll have a enough cure ready in two days. I double checked with the fathers, they said <br />
that as long as one does the blessing at the water station itself, and another with the radio <br />
and some loud speakers, it shouldn't MATTER if some people don't hear it or not!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It feels like you're almost TRYING to figure out a way to escape the cure for someone <br />
else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Just covering all my bases. So what about you, booked the brainwasher yet to cheat <br />
fate and leave me all alone?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot; . . .  I told you I wouldn't do that until AFTER the game was dead.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know . . . &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Asked Never-Star, &quot;Could you have your priesthood send someone to run a chapel for <br />
our farm? Since we live so far away from the city and we prefer to keep a low profile for <br />
obvious reasons. We don't want to be exploited or sued by a toy company.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And live for eternity as a cartoon horse?&quot; Father Mike asked simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everything's got it's price, it would be cheating if it didn't.&quot; Valentines said simply. &quot;That's <br />
why we FARM our food instead of just wishing for it to grow itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Paul meanwhile used sign language, the only form of self expression he had besides <br />
writing even now that was now half human instead of a full orangoutang. <br />
<br />
'If you wish me, I will go, I am already pretty much not human, and if you desire one of the <br />
faith with you, I will help you. It's my duty as a priest.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Brother.&quot; Father Mike whispered.<br />
<br />
'We didn't shrink from our duty to accept our fates and kill the curse within ourselves. I <br />
won't shrink from our duty now.' He signed. <br />
<br />
Father Mike was so distracted by his brother decision (which he was quite steadfast) he <br />
accidentally sent some of the cure instead of some holy water to the address the Ponies <br />
provided (in the middle of nowhere but still had a viable location . . . until it decided to <br />
shift to insure it's occupants happily-ever-after as it nearly had when Kurse was ready to <br />
turn the world into soup). <br />
<br />
This included instructions for what it for and how to use it. <br />
<br />
The delivery man figuring he was at some estate run by some insane toy lover who got <br />
their hands on the game, delivered the package and got of there in a flash and felt no need <br />
to tell anyone about it however that would cause trouble. <br />
<br />
The Ponies couldn't hide forever, and didn't plan to, they simply didn't wish for Ponyland to <br />
become a tourist attraction. <br />
<br />
Night and Day examined the package, read the instructions, figuring it was for them, and <br />
found a hoe, and began to dig a circle around Glendale's city limits, the work going much <br />
faster than they thought it would. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hope we don't run out.&quot; Said Day, and the salve containing the cure didn't run dry until <br />
they had completed their circle around Glendale, and not once they had been seen by any <br />
except innocent children. <br />
<br />
By fate, part of the water system happened to JUST run under part of the circle the Ponies <br />
had made. And no wind would blow by that would disrupt the circle the ponies had made <br />
in service of the church. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Kaylee whispered to her husband in bed, her sister wives asleep like a log, &quot;Dear, when <br />
this all over… let's go on a second honeymoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;… I have to agree.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. Mind if we stay for a while?&quot; Kathy asked to the little lion with tabby like coloring who <br />
had opened his front door for her. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Then the day came.  Many had gathered in the townsquare. The cure was in the water <br />
system. <br />
<br />
And Father Mike spoke the incantation… and just like that, with no fan fare, no drama, no <br />
last minute surprise, it was done. It was done. The game was dead.</p>
