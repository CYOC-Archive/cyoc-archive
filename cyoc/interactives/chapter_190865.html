<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff had always had a bit of trouble putting on size - well, at least before he took his dose of Muscle Tech-X. Sure he grew muscles eventually, and became quite the athlete, but it took him a lot more work to do than any other young athlete there. It just seemed he was naturally a hard gainer. But as Jeff flexed his bicep, observing the incredibly toned, tanned sphere of pure muscle, he could enjoy at long last the fruits of labor. Not exactly the typical gym labor, but labor. A grin tugged at his face, and he knew he should be getting ready for work, but he decided to indulge in a little more flexing.<br />
<br />
Whatever this stuff was, it certainly did its job well enough getting him nice and pumped up. Insane how fast it worked, too. He and his girlfriend both had put on size. Fuck, just thinking about his girlfriend and him, and how much they&#39;d changed and developed was turning him on. Jeff knew he could not make time for that, so he just adjusted his pants, slid on a new shirt, and got ready for work. Sure there was the awkwardness of having his manhood sticking out, hard and strong, at the seat of his pants, but hey - Jeff was a bodybuilder now.<br />
<br />
Why not flaunt what he had?<br />
<br />
Sure he still wasn&#39;t the most hung guy, but the way his strong, insurgent manhood pressed up against his pants...ooh! Maybe he could fool around later on break. Jeff shrugged and got ready to go. He worked in an office down past the 20 Fitness, and indeed, most of his coworkers who were so inclined worked out there an hour or so after work, once they were done socializing or getting ready. As he adjusted his jacket, he doubted that many people that day would be able to recognize him.<br />
<br />
As Jeff got ready to go to work, heading for the door, he stopped when he saw some remaining pallets of Muscle Tech-X. A thought came to his head, and he grinned. He looked over at some small water bottles resting on the couple&#39;s couch, and before long Jeff was driving out with a cooler full of water bottles containing an exact dose of Muscle Tech-X. The idea had just...come to him, as he was getting ready. He figured some of his coworkers might appreciate the increased muscle size the stuff provided.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t think about attaching any warning about the number of dosages - and figured most people would probably see what happened with one dose anyway and be satisfied.<br />
<br />
As Jeff parked and headed into the office, he got his first taste of compliments once he entered the building carrying the cooler. &quot;Jeff? Is that you...? Oh my! Someone&#39;s been working out!&quot; &quot;Dude, where do you tan!? That&#39;s an awesome look.&quot; &quot;Jeffy is looking neat today!&quot; &quot;Someone&#39;s been hitting the gym!&quot; By the last one, Jeff had gone from one of the less outgoing guys at the office to swaggering all the way to his cubicle. He made sure as he went to spread the info about what he had;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anybody that wants a good workout drink, I&#39;ve got a pretty nice one in my water cooler. If you&#39;re going by, just give me a shout and I&#39;ll give you one.&quot; A wink and he sealed the deal. Jeff did not know what effect this might have on office dynamics, but he was pretty excited to see what it might do for his coworkers. Everybody deserved to have a chance to become a ripped fucking greek god like he had. Ooh, oh! There it was again.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt his manhood pressing against his slacks, and swore he was going to need to get a better handle on his libido. And...oddly, his nipples were pressing against his button-up shirt. They weren&#39;t any bigger or anything, but they definitely looked like they were just as well reflecting the excitement he was feeling. As Jeff took his seat at his cubicle, he eagerly awaited his first guest - and the first person to be given the gift of Muscle Tech-X.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jeff, heard you got a pretty sweet pump lately.&quot; Oh that was not who Jeff had expected to see come by.<br />
<br />
Scott Lambert was a huge, well muscled guy - his jawline was already strong and wide, his neck thick like a linebacker&#39;s. His hair was bright blond and curly, his skin lightly tanned, and his body was very muscular already, albeit somewhat more stocky rather than rippling. Nonetheless, everyone around the office was boundlessly impressed by Scott Lambert, especially the women. Now, Jeff had a girlfriend, but he couldn&#39;t help but be a little jealous of all the attention Scott got from his female coworkers. Standing at six foot four inches tall, even freshly grown, Jeff was still an inch or two shorter than Scott.<br />
<br />
Thankfully Scott&#39;s worse moments came more from ignorance than malice - he was just kind of clueless rather than aggressive. &quot;Oh, hey Scott, don&#39;t tell me YOU want one of these things. Aren&#39;t you buff enough already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, there is no such thing!&quot; A chuckle then that said Scott was half joking. But his eyes were steadfastly on the cooler, &quot;Is...THAT how you got so ripped, bro? Fuck, we have got to workout together sometime. You down?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, man.&quot; Invited to workout by the biggest and most popular guy at the office. What a day already. Jeff was feeling pretty curious though. What WOULD one dose do to Scott? He&#39;d seen what one dose did to he himself, but Scott being this big...? It really begged the question!  &quot;So you want a dose of this stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just give it a try. See how it feels, and if the drink&#39;s for me.&quot; Scott shrugged, not even knowing the potency of what he was about to have. He&#39;d been a purely natural lifter before this, so he had no concept of what this was. Nor did he even know it was Muscle Tech-X and its dosage requirements.<br />
<br />
Jeff handed one of the drinks to Scott, and watched the office jock walk back off to his own generously sized cubicle. Jeff had a pretty good view of Scott&#39;s worksite, so he would be able to reasonably well watch the results of this go on. Time to see, he figured, how much bigger this stuff would make Scott. As well as what else it might do to him...</p>
