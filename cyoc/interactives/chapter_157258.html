<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">But Ty wasn´t done with Dustin. He wanted him gone mostly, so he had to change him inside the snowman he had built around him. Slowly all of Dustin&#39;s flesh would change into snow as well, while his bones would turn into wooden branches, still connected. Dustin&#39;s organs would turn into stones. In a few hours there would be no human Dustin in that snowman, but a wooden skeleton one with a couple of stones in between. <br />
And when the snow melts away, so would Dustin&#39;s flesh, and his by then wooden skeleton would fall apart, dropping his stone organs down. And he would feel everything, even after he had fallen apart. He would feel every drop of water that had been his flesh turned snow trickle away on the ground, every twig of wood that had been his skeleton lay, break and rot away, and every stone that had been an organ dropping to the ground and be walked over or thrown away.<br />
When he was fully melted, Ty would collect some of the stones, most important the one that had been Dustin&#39;s brain, which would be the final prison of Dustin&#39;s consciousness. And Ty would be happy to just throw it into the middle of an ocean, never to resurface again, or something else. The other stones he would simply throw in other different places, so Dustin would feel differences with them. Maybe he would keep one of Dustin&#39;s eyes as a paper weight and make sure Dustin could still see with it. The twigs and branches could be chopped and strewn, slowly rotting away. <br />
“Have fun with your punishment, Dustin.” Ty said, even when he knows that Dustin wouldn´t hear him, before he headed inside again, leaving Dustin to slowly vanish inside the snowman.<br />
Dustin was in panic, he couldn´t do anything. Not move, not see or hear, nothing but think and feel. And that didn´t help him. He would apologize to Ty for whatever he had done when he was able to, not knowing that would be never. After what could have been an eternity he felt a small tingle start to move through his body. It was an odd feeling, and annoying that he couldn´t so anything about it. But would he have known he was slowly dissolving into snow, wood and stone he would only panic more.<br />
Ty had fun playing inside with some things that originally belonged to Dustin, already his by now. Nobody remembered Dustin, so everything he had owned belonged now to Ty. From time to time he used his powers to check on Dustin&#39;s progress in dissolving, and was pleased to see him vanishing. After a couple of hours there was nothing human left, and Ty used his power to label the stones so he could easily find what he wanted later. Then he did other things, Dustin kept out of his mind.<br />
It was only three days later when the snow begun to melt that Ty remembered to check on Dustin, mostly how he was feeling and thinking.<br />
Dustin had no way to tell time anymore, and counting didn´t help either. He didn´t know that hie thoughts were slowed by his brain being stone, nor that he had changed at all. Strange was only that he could feel things inside his body, as he felt with his stone organs and wooden skeleton, but didn´t think much of it. Then he slowly felt the heat reaching him inside the snow, and hoped that now he would be unfreezing. But then something felt wrong, as he felt parts of himself connect with the ground and sinking in. He felt a small part being absorbed into something, not knowing his water droplets were nourishing the grass underneath his position.<br />
Only when nearly nothing was left of his snow body he realized what happened, and mentally started crying for Ty to turn him back. He could see again, but his eyes laid on the ground, together with the rest. He could see his skeleton that fall apart with the rest of some stones and realized what they were as well.<br />
Ty felt the calling from Dustin and moved to look what had happened. Seeing the heap of twigs and branches together with the stones he smiled at it when he moved nearer. “I see you have finished melting, Dustin. Nothing left of that annoying foster brother of mine now but some wood and stone. Now to collect a memento and throw the rest away.”<br />
Dustin was shocked by Ty&#39;s words. But could do nothing but screaming at him mentally as Ty looked through the remains of his body.<br />
Ty took the both eyes and ears first, putting them inside his pockets. He had decided on set of eye and ear would be in Dustin&#39;s old room, which was now his own, while the other would be placed in the living room, so he could see and hear his parents as well. He also had changed his mind a bit, so instead of the brain it was the heart that went into the ocean with a small wish, crashing like a comet somewhere into the Atlantic. Dustin&#39;s bowels Ty willed into an volcanoes magma, but made sure it wouldn´t melt. He heard Dustin&#39;s pained screams when he placed it there.<br />
He dulled that pain for him a bit, so he could also feel the rest of his body moving. The rest was willed around the world, some stones into a desert, other into the Arctic or the Antarctic. When Ty was finished all that was left on the ground was the  stones that had been Dustin&#39;s brain and his small cock. The brain was then placed inside their door step, so every visitor would step on it. For the cock he had another idea, changing it into a chew toy for their neighbours dog, which he delivered to him after it was finished. Then he got back inside, placing the eye and ear sets in their new places. Dustin was still screaming in pain from all the sensations of cold and heat at the same time to do anything other than that.<br />
When Dustin had adjusted a bit and wasn´t screaming that much anymore Ty did the next cruel thing as he moved the shredder outside, taking one eye with him so Dustin could see what Ty did. It was painful to get his bones chopped into splinters, and Ty laughed like a madman while he did that. Afterwards he strew them around their garden before getting back inside. <br />
From that on he nearly forgot about Dustin himself, only every month or so did he try to hear Dustin&#39;s thoughts. After a year, Dustin&#39;s mind was to fractured by the pain he felt permanently, so Ty let him rest in that state. Maybe he would restore Dustin&#39;s mind later, but for now he was satisfied. Life was going well for himself, as with small nudges his foster parents now loved him, he wasn´t bullied anymore and had a girlfriend. He used his powers from time to time, but was satisfied without using them to much.</p>
