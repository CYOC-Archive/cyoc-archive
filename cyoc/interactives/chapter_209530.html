<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>A huge thank you to rawr7 for helping brainstorm ideas and write sections of this chapter.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Owen put his hands greedily on Troy’s back, “You know kid, I really can’t get you outta my head. Can’t focus on my work”<br />
<br />
Troy felt Owen’s meaty hands push into Troy’s hard back, his boss really seemed to love him. Troy couldn’t help but feel a little nervous. Owen’s presence over Troy gave him full control do whatever he wanted. Owen moved up and down Troy’s body slowly, feeling the coarse rough skin, his dick moved in and out rhythmically inside the Rhox’s hole. Troy could feel himself shake as moaned with stuttered breath, trying to keep as quiet as he could. His voice stifled, hot air escaping from his parted lips. Owen grinned as he made Troy his complete toy.<br />
 <br />
Owen laughed, “Maybe I’ll call you Toy from now on instead of Troy.”<br />
<br />
Troy couldn’t think, his legs quaked with ecstasy, he was going to cum. Owen grunted as his thrusts grew deeper and more forceful. Troy couldn’t help it, he exploded all over the barrier they were hiding behind, sticky white painting the solid concrete. Owen wasn’t far behind, letting out his own moan as he sprayed his seed inside Troy. Troy felt the rush of cum leak out his hole as Owen slowed down. Owen caught he breath, leaning down onto Troy, kissing his back repeatedly.<br />
<br />
As Troy began to regain his focus, he looked around to make sure no one had seen them. He then saw a person over by their clothes, someone was fucking with their stuff!<br />
<br />
Troy called out, “Hey stop it! What do you think you’re doing.”<br />
<br />
Owen pulled Troy back in, “Let ‘em, pervert ain’t doing nothing. And I’m not done with you yet.”<br />
<br />
Owen started pounding Troy’s ass again, holding him firm so that Troy couldn’t move. Troy struggled, fighting the returning pleasure from Owen’s cock. What if someone got his book! Who was touching their stuff? Suddenly, Troy heard the person say “Shape.” Troy instantly began to feel different. His body was heating up as he began to sweat. He recognized this feeling. He was be changed! He looked as his large hands as they had begun to shrink. His three digits split back into five. Not only this, but they turned a peach white hue. He could feel his tail receding back into his body, his rough skin becoming smooth and flat. He felt the horn on his head with his hands as it shrank back into his head. Troy’s body began to deflate as well, his muscles losing definition. His stomach shrank as the fat on his body melted away. Troy was certain, he turning back into a human.<br />
<br />
The cock in his ass also began to feel different. Troy angled himself back so he could see Owen. Owen’s skin was now white, and he had lost his tusks. He was also becoming human. Perhaps surprisingly though, not much seemed to change for him. He was still hugely muscled, and he still had a little bit of a gut. Troy chuckled as Owen was essentially the same guy before and after he was changed.<br />
Troy managed to pull himself away from Owen as Owen decided he wanted to have a cigarette. Troy quickly walked over to the person who had his book.<br />
<br />
Troy shouted, “Stop, give that back!” He didn’t even think about the embarrassment of being naked in public.<br />
<br />
As he approached the figure, Troy recognized them. He got a sinking feeling in his stomach as he watched Drew laugh as he held up his new combined book. It was much larger than when he had it during the D&D game, did he have more books than just Troy’s?<br />
Drew laughed, “Not to break up your sex, you fur fag, but I couldn’t help but notice you just left your book out in the open. Not a smart move dumbass.”<br />
<br />
Troy had hoped that Drew wouldn’t come after him, that they could be temporary allies, but it seemed that plan had fallen through. He began to plan on how he could get his book back. Troy suddenly realized a horrible truth; he was completely powerless. Without his book, there was nothing he could do except physically overpower Drew, which wasn’t going to happen. Was this the end of the road?<br />
<br />
Troy begged, “Please, you have to give that back to me, I need it!”<br />
<br />
“Oh my, you want your book back? Why don’t you beg me for it, and I’ll see if I feel like it.”<br />
<br />
Troy had no choice; he bit his lip. He got down on the dirty concrete, completely naked, and bowed before Drew.<br />
<br />
Owen called out for Troy, “Where are ya kid, finished my cig and I’m ready for round three!” He walked to where Troy and Drew were. “Whoa, what’s going on here? That one’s mine to use. Get your own, fat ass.”<br />
<br />
Drew scoffed, “You were fucking this oaf? Oh well, I could always use another figurine. Inanimate.”<br />
<br />
Owen suddenly froze up, his body crumpling up as he shrunk down to the floor. “Wat Ar You!?”, was all he was able to eek out before his mouth was sealed shut. Tusks grew back from his now plastic mouth as his skin shone with a light tinge. Owen fell to floor, now a tiny figurine of an Orc fighter. Drew picked up the figure.<br />
<br />
“I will say though, he did make a good orc. Now he can be an orc figure.”<br />
<br />
Troy recognized how the figure looked. Drew managed to beat Drake! He had the Book of Transmutation. How many books did he have now?<br />
<br />
“Hm”, Drew pondered. “I thought that making you human again would be a good punishment for indulging in your furry fantasy, but I think I have a better idea. Kiss my feet and I’ll let you live.”<br />
<br />
Troy’s mind began to race, what could he do! Where was Lancer, was this really even happening! It had to be a nightmare, it just had to be. Troy took a deep breath; he had to regain his composure if he was going to get out of this alive. Drew wouldn’t kill him.<br />
<br />
“Okay, fine. I’ll kiss your feet.”<br />
<br />
Troy crawled over to Drew slowly. Drew took his foot out of his shoe and sock. Troy lowered his head and kissed the bare foot.<br />
<br />
“Modify.” Drew whispered.<br />
<br />
Troy wondered what that smell-er, spell, had done, but was quickly distracted by Drew’s foot. The chubby nerd waggled his toes and spread them wide. Troy stared, growing increasingly enticed as their pleasing scent wafted into his nostrils. Wasn’t that why he’d started dating Drew? To worship his beautiful feet?<br />
<br />
He glanced up at Drew and the man merely smiled and nodded. “It’s okay, babe, no one can see us.”<br />
<br />
Troy smiled and sniffed Drew’s foot, taking his time to really enjoy the experience. There was a delightful scent to it, like a locker room, that had him salivating. He raised a shaking hand and began to massage it, thumbs rubbing in a circular motion. Drew moaned and leaned back, taking off his other shoe and sock.<br />
<br />
He placed his other foot on Troy’s erect cock and began gently rubbing it. It was Troy’s turn to moan, inhaling more of his boyfriend’s luscious scent. They were dry and soft, a little hot and damp from walking to the construction site. Troy started to lick the heel of Drew’s foot, and felt Drew clench his toes around Troy’s cock in return.<br />
<br />
“Babe, your feet are so hot.” Troy moaned, suckling on a pinkie toe.<br />
<br />
Drew leaned back, moaning, foot still rubbing in tandem with Troy’s suckles and laps. Troy ground his crotch against his chubby boyfriend&#39;s beautiful foot and nuzzled against the arch of the one in his hands. His raging erection was leaking slippery precum all over the bottom of Drew’s foot, making the foot-job all the more pleasant.<br />
<br />
Troy didn’t care about the incredibly pleasure he was receiving, all he wanted to do was taste the salty musk flavor of Drew’s toes. His tongue slipped between them, cleaning them. He moaned as Drew clenched his toes around Troy’s cock like they were fingers and moved his foot up and down.  It was too much for Troy. Feeling his boyfriend masturbate him with his beautiful foot made him cum, spurts trickling down Drew’s feet in a warm gush. Drew, whose fist was a blur on his own cock, looked down at Troy and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Merge.” Drew whispered.<br />
<br />
Troy felt his lips become fixed to Drew’s foot. He couldn’t let go! He let out a yell, but his lips wouldn’t part to make a sound. Troy’s lips did open eventually however. He began to slowly put Drew’s whole foot into his mouth. Troy felt full as he pushed the foot deeper and deeper into his maw. He felt his body shrink and shift as he legs dissipated into tiny nubs. His vision blurred as he could no longer see anything but the foot in front of him.<br />
<br />
“Drew!” Troy managed to say over the slobbery foot. “Plea-hrrrmmmgh!”<br />
<br />
“No more talking, foot.” Drew smirked, shoving his foot deeper.<br />
<br />
Drew’s toes pushed against the roof of Troy’s mouth and suddenly, all sound cut off, leaving only the dull pulse of his own blood. Troy shuddered, head feeling heavier than it ought to as Drew slowed down, watching Troy’s eyes as they darted frantically around the construction site for help. Drew grinned and pushed gently but unrelentingly further into Troy’s brain.<br />
<br />
Troy shuddered again, the odd sensation of something twitching and wriggling in his head made him feel so heavy. His body relaxed as the toes flexed again, hitting something that made him feel loose and good. He struggled to form coherent thoughts, but all he could think of was Drew’s foot. Its shape, how it smelled.<br />
<br />
He wanted to plead with Drew as he felt the toes wriggle further in, but all he could do was whimper incoherently around the mass stuck in his mouth. Troy was stuck in a swamp filled with musk stink, his head feeling tight and loose all at once, like something important was missing. All he could think about was that addicting smell, that taste, the imagery of Drew’s delightful foot never leaving his mind’s eye.<br />
Drew waggled his toes one last time and pleasure exploded in his brain. The chubby nerd’s toes pushed through the top of Troy’s skull as his head collapsed around them, forming back into a perfect, slightly chubby and sweaty, foot. Pleasure exploded in Troy’s mind as he finished the transformation, little hairs poking out the top of his former head.<br />
<br />
“You look better this way, you foot kisser. I bet you even liked that didn’t you. God, you’re such a pervert.” Drew said as he wiggled his new toes, shifted his foot at the ankle. He then pushed his foot into the ground, rubbing it against the hard pavement.<br />
<br />
Troy felt what was left of his mind begin to slip away from him. Drew’s taunts continued, but Troy could no longer make out what he was saying. He was enclosed in darkness as Drew’s sock was pulled over him. He no longer could see or feel anything but the inside of the shoe.  Troy felt the gravity of Drew’s body as he placed all his weight on him. His entire being tensed. Then Drew turned and Troy had to work hard adjusting all the different muscles and tendons he was now in control of. His mind began to hyper-focus on keeping Drew’s balance as the chubby nerd walked away from the construction site. Gradually, it was all Troy could think about, and then he didn’t think much of anything as his thoughts devolved into pleasant minutiae.<br />
<br />
He was a foot, after all.</p>
