<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What the...?!&quot; Ryan shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is this possible?&quot; Bradley asked. &quot;How were we able to become conjoined siblings with you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor Parker and Doctor Parker explained it to us when we got back,&quot; said ConjoinVerse Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Basically, anyone from your dimension can become a conjoined sibling to anyone here,&quot; ConjoinVerse Bradley said. &quot;All it takes is for the person to come into direct contact with another&#39;s body in any way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we can still separate when the time comes for us to go home, right?&quot; Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The docs didn&#39;t say,&quot; ConjoinVerse Ryan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we can&#39;t be stuck here forever!&quot; Bradley shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might get used to it,&quot; ConjoinVerse Bradley said. &quot;Since everyone in your universe has only one head, this could be a cool experience for you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan and Bradley though about it, and agreed with their ConjoinVerse counterparts. Their NormVerse parents were in fact twins and married as such, and the close family was even closer in this universe. After lunch, the four-headed boys left their parents to clean up while they and their siblings went into the living room. They were Ryan and Bradley--combined with their ConjoinVerse counterparts--Derek and Eli; Terry, Dylan, and Thatcher; and their ten-year-old sisters Mary, Anne, Elizabeth, and Victoria. The three-headed bros took the remote and started watching TV, Derek and Eli went back upstairs to nap some more, while the four-headed sisters played with their dolls--their multi-headed dolls.<br />
<br />
The NormVerse Ryan and Bradley couldn&#39;t help but notice and be amazed at the similarities and differences between their universe and this one. Not only was it normal here for everyone to have at least one conjoined siblings, but even this one difference provided several fundamental differences between NormVerse and ConjoinVerse. For one thing, there was no seat furniture here that Ryan and Bradley would recognize as a chair: that was because in this universe, it was extremely rare for any person to have just one head, and therefore every torso in this universe was significantly wider--hence, the wider seats. In fact, Ryan and Bradley--due to sharing a torso with their ConjoinVerse counterparts--possessed a shared torso that was now about five NormVerse feet wide. Secondly, the family pictures and photographs looked the same as those in NormVerse, except here--obviously--each person had at least two heads, either doing the same thing or different things simultaneously. Thirdly, the clothing was no doubt one of the most unusual things in this universe. Instead of the standard clothing designs of NormVerse, the clothes here were significantly different. Each shirt was large enough for at least two NormVerse people to wear to resemble a person from ConjoinVerse; the same could be said for pants, jeans, and shorts here. Additionally, there were not just shirts for two-headed people; there were also clothes for three-headed and four-headed people, and it was possible to NormVerse Ryan and Bradley that some people here could have even more heads. This universe was definitely still weird and unusual to NormVerse Ryan and Bradley, but now that they were literally a part of this universe, they decided that they should at least embrace it and get used to it.<br />
<br />
One of the first things they noticed was a video that Thatcher was was looking at on his laptop. Terry and Dylan were watching the TV, but Thatcher was busy watching an old commercial--one from about 2004. ConjoinVerse Ryan and Bradley had already seen this commercial, but NormVerse Ryan and Bradley had not; at least, not this version. In NormVerse, the commercial was for a Leapster, one in which a boy names each function and ends up with four heads, and at the end apparently his sister as well. In this ConjoinVerse version, the commercial starts with the same boy, still with one head; this commercial, however, was for a strange new device.<br />
<br />
The boy on the screen said, &quot;All I want is a way to be like my family.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy then aimed the device at his left side and fired a beam; his left side expanded outward and grew a second head.<br />
<br />
The new head said, &quot;And like my friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
The original head said, &quot;Yeah, dude!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude.&quot; said the second head.<br />
<br />
Another beam to their left side repeated the process; the boy now had three heads.<br />
<br />
The third head said, &quot;In our own kicking way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duuuude,&quot; said the first two heads.<br />
<br />
One more beam, one more head.<br />
<br />
The fourth head said, &quot;Plus, we could make more!&quot;<br />
<br />
They did not. The heads then started doing different things: eating, drinking, reading, etc. The original boy was now one of identical conjoined quadruplets, the clothes had modified themselves to a multi-headed body with each new head, and they looked the same as the boy in the NormVerse version of the commercial--of course, in this version, it was real, not computer-generated imagery.<br />
<br />
The third head then belched in the direction of the second, prompting the second to exclaim, &quot;Dude!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, dude,&quot; the third head replied.<br />
<br />
Next, all four heads were shown saying, &quot;Only Cloner lets you get &#39;a head&#39;!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the conjoined quadruplets continued to perform their various tasks, a voice was heard:<br />
<br />
&quot;Want conjoined siblings? You can have them with the Cloner Handgun. It&#39;s safe to use, works on anyone, and gives you as many heads as you would want to have, each functioning as your conjoined sibling or siblings!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the quadruplets&#39; sisters were shown: four heads just like the NormVerse version, but from context this version had always had four heads. One of them said, &quot;It&#39;s my turn!&quot;<br />
<br />
Three of the male heads gave disapproving facial expressions--a stuck-out tongue, a head shake, and an eye-roll. The fourth said, &quot;Dream on.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sisters then simultaneously exclaimed, &quot;Mooooooooms!&quot;<br />
<br />
A final shot of the device appeared, with the voice from before: &quot;The Cloner Multi-Head Handgun. Effects are not reversible, so use carefully.&quot;<br />
<br />
NormVerse Ryan and Bradley were amazed: a device that could give you conjoined siblings? Obviously, the commercial was meant for the rare one-headed people who wanted to be conjoined siblings like others or from those who wanted one-heads to blend in with them. Regardless, they did not need it, because they now had conjoined siblings. And thus, the four headed bros walked out of the living room to go upstairs.<br />
<br />
As with the furniture, the stairs were wider in ConjoinVerse as well. Upstairs, the hallway led to at least six visible rooms--the master bedroom for Sean and Shane and Helena and Lisa, four bedrooms for each group of conjoined siblings, and a bathroom. It occurred to both Ryans and both Bradleys that it would be difficult to sleep in a bed meant for a two-headed person, since they were now basically a four-headed person. However, it would be a while until they had to sleep, and perhaps the moms--Helena and Lisa--would bring home a larger bed by then. The reason ConjoinVerse Ryan and Bradley wanted to come upstairs was to show NormVerse Ryan and Bradley firsthand what life in this universe was like.<br />
<br />
Inside one of the other bedroom&#39;s, Bradley recognized some of Thatcher&#39;s furniture, meaning that this was Terry, Dylan, and Thatcher&#39;s bedroom. What someone from NormVerse would see as a triple bed was actually a normal bed here--remember, these body bros share a body with three heads. In fact, everything they owned was designed for three heads--three phones, three computers, the hoodie that the triple bros were wearing when they walked up to their younger brothers (and their new ones). Fortunately, as in NormVerse with Thatcher, the three bros were kind towards their younger siblings, so none of the four had any reason to worry.<br />
<br />
Next, ConjoinVerse Ryan and Bradley decided to show NormVerse Ryan and Bradley more of ConjoinVerse. First, the four walked to ConjoinVerse Ryan and Bradley&#39;s bedroom--like the house and the other rooms, a combination of Ryan and Bradley&#39;s bedrooms from NormVerse. There was only one wallet--one body--but also two cellphones, one for ConjoinVerse Ryan and the other for ConjoinVerse Bradley. Ryan and Bradley had brought their wallets and phones from NormVerse, and they were still inside their large pants&#39; pockets. Once back downstairs, the four-headed boy(s) walked outside, with Ryan and Bradley ready for their ConjoinVerse counterparts to show off their world.</p>
