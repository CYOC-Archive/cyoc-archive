<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sasha was right,  slowly but surely Lynne was coming around.<br />
<br />
Although the girl ran with a completely different group at school she was warming to Gloria and her friends. While at first Lynne found herself talking with Felicia and Gloria (Felicia was dating a popular boy while Gloria was family) she did eventually make time for the others. By the end of the week Lynne was floating between the two groups effortlessly. For Gloria it helped to lighten her mood and help with her healing, for the first time in a longtime Lynne seemed happy.<br />
<br />
As the week came to a close Gloria was truely in the spirit to celebrate and with good reason. Saturday would mark her 15th birthday. While Gloria felt she was getting too old for an actual birthday party Lisa and her friends were fairly persistent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cmon Gloria,&quot; Jackie whined. &quot;It doesn&#39;t habe to be anything big. We can just have a few people over to celebrate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont know Jackie,&quot; Gloria mumbled. &quot;I mean aren&#39;t we a bit old for that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kackie frowned as she gazed at her friend. While she didn&#39;t want anything big, she did want to celebrate as the two had done in previous years. &quot;Cmon Glo,&quot; she said. &quot;In case you forgot we share the same birthday. It could be fun having everyone over to hang out. Please, lets do this. It will be just like old times.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria smirked as she looked at her friend, she did have alot of fond memories of the two of them celebrating their birthday together. Often times the two would hold a joint party with their family and friends. As Gloria remembered this she realized that was probably what had made the two of them so close.<br />
<br />
Sadly though things were beginning to change, Gloria was dating Nate and branching out with other friends while Jackie seemed to spend more time talking with Ann. While still close the two had noticed that they were at different places in their lives. &quot;Maybe this will be good for both of us,&quot; she thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Jackie lets do it,&quot; she said. Jackie squealed in delight as she hugged Gloria tightly.<br />
<br />
When Lisa and Jackies mom found out about the girls party plans they immediately began to brainstorm with one another, much to Gloria and Jackies chagrin. Before the two teens knew it their small party had become a big event. Aside from their friends Gloria and Jackie discovered their moms had invited Adam and Nate as well as their mother Maddie. Gloria also discovered that Katie, Kellie and Ann would be attending as well as Cole, Kumiko and the Tozawas. What started as a small get together with friends was quickly becoming a very big get together.<br />
<br />
As Gloria and Jackie now hung out in Glorias room they could hear Lisa and Jason making the final preparations. &quot;Man your mom is going all out,&quot; Jackie sighed as she listened to the commotion downstairs. Gloria nodded in annoyance as she stared out the window. &quot;Igh tell me about it. Not only Nate and Adam coming over but so is their mom. Almost ervyone we know is coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Jackie said sheepishly. &quot;Maybe I shouldnt of pushed this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria looked sadly over at Jackie. Taking her friends hand she gave her a reassuring smile. &quot;His isnt your fault Jackie,&quot; she said. &quot;My folks just got a bit carried away that&#39;s all. Guess their just happy things have been going better this week so they want to celebrate. Besides...it will give you a chance to see Ann.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie blushed as she thought about Ann. She had mentioned that she and Ann had lost their virginity to one another. That would be something that she would keep between Ann and herself. Aside from that she realized that unless some magical intervention took place their would be no way her and Ann would be able ti hangout at the party. Ann was still 42 while Jackie would only be 15.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey girls what you up too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie and Gloria turned to see Lynne peaking into the bedroom. Smiling the two teens beckoned the red haired teen to join them. &quot;Hey Lynne,&quot; Gloria said. &quot;What are mom and dad up to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh their going all out down there,&quot; she sighed. &quot;They&#39;ve got streamers, balloons, the works going on. Even Jackies mom is helping out. They may have gone a bit oveeboard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie and Gloria groaned causing Lynne to stifle a giggle. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she smirked, noticing the two teens frown. &quot;Things will be fine. Lets just focus on having okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your right,&quot; Gloria said quietly. Lynne smiled before reaching into her bag. &quot;Look things will be fun,&quot; she said. &quot;Until then though here, I got these for you two. Happy birthday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie and Gloria gazed curiously at the small packages Lynne gave them. Cautiously they opened them, knowing Lynnes pension for pranks. Unwrapping them the girls were surprised to see a small book for Gloria and a very pretty charm necklace for Jackie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got you a notebook Gloria,&quot; Lynne said. &quot;Where Im from you have your own spellbook. I figured I&#39;d give this to you so you can start writing your spells down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Gloria whispered. &quot;Thank you Lynne, its beautiful. I cant wait to start filling it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lynne smiled turning to Jackie as she admired the necklace. &quot;Its not magical Jackie in case your wondering,&quot; she said.&quot;I noticed that necklace one day when you came to visit my mom. I thought it was pretty and asked where you got it from. Turns out you said you got it on your 15th birthday. Guess I was fated to give it you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie smiled, hugging the young teen tightly. &quot;Thanks Lynne its gorgeous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lynne smiled warmly, watching as her sister flipped through her empty spell book while Jackie put her necklace on. She couldnt help but feel a tremendous amount of joy as she watched the two. &quot;Hey dont worry things will be fun,&quot; she said. &quot;Lets just enjoy the party okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie and Gloria nodded as they smiled at the young teen. Hopefully it was a fun event for al of them.</p>
