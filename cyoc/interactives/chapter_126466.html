<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Hello,<br/>
Let me know what you guys think.  If you wan't feel free to write a chapter yourself adding on to mine.  Just keep it close to the subject matter at hand if possible.  I'm still pretty busy and cant update it too much but i'll let you know I do plan to continue if people like this.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Authors note:  The story will be told from Canus&#39; perspective from here on out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trying to contain my arousal as I approached the next frat house I contemplated what to make of the situation.  My corrupted thoughts wanted me to spread my taint to many or to start my own pack, but i&#39;m still such a new demon that perhaps it would be better to gain power and knowledge from Equus first.  As these thoughts distracted me I had already found my way to the frat house as I stepped inside the party there.  The first thing that hit me was a wave of scents I never knew existed, I could practically smell the thoughts of lust and sin coming from the men inside the house.  I had practically froze up in the middle of the room as party-goers drank and danced around me.  Panic started to set in, I had almost no plan in mind for how I would go about accomplishing either of my goals.  I just stood still as I drank in the scents as my canine erection swelled.<br />
<br />
People began to notice my presence and in my lusty haze I still knew I couldn&#39;t make a scene yet with no plan to go on.  Not to mention the baggy sweatpants I was wearing still showed quite a sizable bulge in them.  I stepped into the basement trying to get away from the crowd while I collected my thoughts and devised a course of corruptive action.  Stumbling down to the laundry room I jumped into the closet nearby to hide, my new amber colored eyes could still see plenty well in the limited light.  It was then I realized that the laundry room might not have been the best choice, the scent of musk here was even more pervasive as the room and closet I was in was strewn with sweaty gym clothes that were thick with the virile smell of sex.  My demonic dick quickly grew to full hardness again but I was happy to gently rub it through my sweatpants as it helped the thoughts of corruption come easier to me.  Rubbing my forming knot with glee I began to plot my plan to have both of my goals achieved.  I would lure two thirds of the party back to Equus to receive my reward and make my creator happy.  But I would return to have those that remained to be corrupted by my own wolfish brand of taint.  Grunting in pleasure as I began to really work my cock, pumping out tainted pre all over the inside of my pants I heard a noise as someone entered the laundry room with me.<br />
<br />
A college fratboy, slightly skinnier and more nerdy looking then the rest stepped down into room.  He smelled different than the rest of the jocks... he smelled ripe with the seed of corruption inside him ready to take root, and I soon found out why as he locked the door behind him.  The man was here for reasons of lust, he went through the bins of dirty college laundry as he looked for his prize.  Putting on a devious smile he pulled out a powerful smelling jockstrap from one of the baskets and took a deep sniff as his erection grew.  It didn&#39;t take long before sat down in a corner huffing the jock with one hand and working over his cock with the other.  <br />
<br />
This little show of his pleased me as something inside me knew that this one in front of me deserved the corruption of my own leaking dick.  He was far too good for the equine demon at the other frat, I had to have him.  Both of us had been working up quite a sweat beating our meat, I could tell his eyes were closed as he jerked off in bliss and this would give me a perfect opportunity to reward him for his lusty act.  Quietly padding out of the closet and approaching him without making a sound I smiled a fang filled smile as I lifted my arm up and pressed the musky mat of fur in my pit up against his face.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you could use some company pup, and it looks like you might enjoy a more direct source of that smell you enjoy.&quot;  I rumbled to him.  With hardly any hesitation he began to sniff my pit and even lick my fur there.  It was clear that my pheromones had already begun to effect him.   &quot;Mnnf... more..&quot;  He moaned, practically lost in my scent.  &quot;You&#39;re quite enthusiastic there pup.  I&#39;ll tell you what I will give you an even better treat if you tell me your name.&quot;  I suggested it casually but I knew he was already under my spell. <br />
<br />
He seemed almost disappointed he had to stop his actions for air and to speak back to me.  &quot;Miles... my name is Miles.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;You can call me Canus Miles, now lay back and let me give you your treat for being such a good pup.&quot; I growled seductively as I groped my massive bulge.  Slipping out of my sweatpants had me exposing my leaking footlong wolf cock to Miles, but instead of shy away from the strange tool he eagerly leaned forward to lick away the river of pre that ran down my cock.  Letting slip a deep moan at his action the short fuzzy nub of my tail began to wag in joy out of sight.  Oral would be nice but I had special plans for this one, letting Miles get a few more gulps of my tainted pre down I pulled out of his mouth and pushed him down as I climbed atop the smaller male.  His own decent six inches of maleness now grinding against my knotted beauty, and my massive ball-sack rested against his own surprisingly large sack .  Giving Miles a quick kiss I began to frot against him, our slick cocks grinding pleasurably.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you feel my body against yours?  All of this can be your&#39;s Miles.  The strength, the body, the lust.  If you give in willingly to my corruption it will be so much better, you can smell like a true beast!&quot;  I moaned into his ear as our body&#39;s rut against each other in the light of the laundry room.    Speeding up our thrusting I could start to feel Miles give in to the lust as a sense of power flowed through me, my own body taking corrupt joy in the sensation of tainting another.  My fangs began to grow larger and my tail pushed out another inch.  As I neared my limit and my balls began to tighten up I spoke into his ear once more.  &quot;Pledge your loyalty to me Miles and receive your gift.&quot;  I deeply growled into his ear. <br />
<br />
Hearing him moan the words yes triggered something inside me as the dam of pleasure finally broke.  My body shook in ecstasy as I began to coat his cock, balls, and chest in a wave of my wolf spunk as my knot pulsed against his cock.  Another primal sensation stirred in my brain as I leaned down and bit gently into Miles&#39; shoulder, marking him as special.  As my load continued to coat him in cum his own cock pulsed with release.  At first weakly spraying into coating of cum I was giving him, but then began to pick up the pace as his balls swelled with tainted power.  Miles&#39; was grunting softly with each burst of essence he let loose but as his dick began to taper into more of a canine shape his grunts dropped an octave as he road out the waves of pleasure.  While his cock grew a few inches in the process what really caught my eye was how large his balls were inflating.  They churned with a massive amount of cum as they rivaled my own spunk factories in size even though Miles&#39; was smaller in every other category.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Canus... what will you have me do?&quot;  Miles gasped as he finally came down from the high of release, his body still covered in a thick layer of our combined loads of cum.  <br />
<br />
Giving my new recruit a toothy grin I replied &quot;I have some work that needs to be done, I will return but why don&#39;t you stay down here in the meantime and see just how many loads you can churn out with your new equipment.  I know all of this laundry would be improved if you added your own scent to it, don&#39;t you think?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Miles smiled back and before I headed back upstairs to start working on my plan I let him know one last thing.  &quot;If you manage to impress me when I get back I might even make you my Beta pup.  Let&#39;s see if you can squeeze 20 loads out of those fat balls of your&#39;s.&quot;   I relished the sound of him starting to pleasure himself at that suggestion immediately.  When I heard him moan out that he could get to 30 before I got back I knew that he was the right choice for the job.</p>
