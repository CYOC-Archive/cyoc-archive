<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dinner was called as Dustin was becoming very well practiced in the bedroom. Though straight, his memories were that of a very bisexual version of himself and presumably history matched. As Dustin came back from being in his own head he processed that everyone was in the kitchen and felt awkward taking the place his dad always sat.<br />
<br />
Ty made a few wishes to perfect the lawn and landscaping as well as giving Dustin a few friends in the neighborhood to really solidify his integration into adulthood. A wish nudged June into asking him to invite Tom and his family from down the road over for a barbeque before the weather turns and Dustin loved the idea only to immediately withdraw as he realized he never met Tom and his life is a lie. <br />
<br />
Dustin ate and ate but June knew how much to cook and was left with a meal for one of the boys or a snack for Dustin. The boys got up and began the dishes, clearing the table and setting up the dishwasher as Dustin filled and attacked his third plate of food occasionally taking a few gulps from his Thermos. The kitchen was back to sparkling and June went to the living room to relax after a full work day and immediately shifting into making a meal.<br />
<br />
Dustin (and his newfound pride in his lawn) were geared towards yardwork, he got up with a groan realizing his back and knees hurt. After all he was in his mid 40&#39;s and well over 300 lbs... he&#39;d spent his life lifting heavy things to cultivate this masterpiece of a body.... wait... Dustin realized it was getting easier and easier to slip into accepting his new life and he needed to figure this out with his adopted son fast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty, could you join me in the garage, I&#39;ve got some work for you.&quot; Dustin commented truly wanting to fix his life and get back to being well maybe at least as young as his early 20s, possibly back to 16. By the time they had both stepped outside Dustin began talking about weeding and fertilizing as he grabbed himself a beer from the beer fridge they stored out there. Ty just listened and and enjoyed knowing any chores will be wished done in an instant, but he was waiting for the moment Dustin&#39;s reality imploded, which came soon enough. Ty didn&#39;t want Dustin to have too much time and energy dedicated to formulating the perfect conversation after all, that would ruin the payback.<br />
<br />
Dustin took a gulp from his beer and immediately looked at it like it was an alien artifact, &quot;Wait wait wait wait wait!&quot; he cried as he was once again fully aware and had never acquired the taste for beer but, like coffee it was part of his routine. &quot;I keep falling into this life&#39;s habits, but I want to really talk to you!&quot; his face the picture of desperation. &quot;I never wanted to be body builder huge, just lean and muscular. And, and, I get that I have a good job and good life but it feels like remembering someone else&#39;s life. Its not me! I like fitness but never would have made a career out of teaching it in high school. I don&#39;t remember any parties, or vacations, or nights out with the guys during college. I had perfect A&#39;s in all my classes, that&#39;s not me. I know you&#39;re trying to help but you turned me into the robot hulk of suburban dads! How do we fix this?&quot; Dustin took another swig and grimaced setting the beer down.<br />
<br />
Ty froze time briefly and laughed maniacally, this was part of what he had been waiting for and Dustin had just opened the door to so many fun alternate realities to subject him to. Ty steadied himself, prepared for his act, and restarted time. &quot;I.. I got these powers a day ago and the first thing I did was dedicate them to trying give you everything you ever showed me you cared about... You were never kind to me and always completely self absorbed, but I am trying to forgive you and make sure you have a good life before I figure my own out.&quot; Ty had tears streaming down his face and had previously given Dustin parental instincts when it came to Mark and himself ensuring that Dustin was emotionally just kicked in the balls.<br />
<br />
Ty turned away and took a few deep breaths. Though Ty was faking the emotions, his body took over producing real tears and snot. &quot;Fine, I mean, this is for you right? I wish Dustin partied hard and regularly throughout the end of high school and any additional schooling he did. I wish he prioritized vacation, relaxation, and fun over his career advancement and stopped trying to bulk up or maintain his physique after reaching 200 lbs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty and Dustin looked around the garage, &quot;Is it working?&quot; Dustin asked nervously. &quot;I think so...&quot; Ty said cautiously. His previous wishes made specific holes in reality for Dustin or Mark to fall into but this was a bit reckless blasting apart 30 years of history and interactions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, Ty?&quot; Dustin was watching himself as a sleeve tattoo crawled up his arm and reaching onto his neck. Dustin was deflating down to a much more average size rapidly though he was no longer shredded and had a definite dad bod complete with beer belly. &quot;Oh man, I think I&#39;m drunk and high.&quot; he said with a somewhat distant appraising thoughtfulness taking a drag off his cigarette and reaching for his beer. &quot;Weird, but it feels kinda good and really familiar.&quot; he said with a drawn out chuckle.<br />
<br />
As reality reworked itself Mark aged to 26, now the product of a one night stand when Dustin was 18. Dustin was a deadbeat father who never tried to move up because it would just go to child support for the next almost 2 decades. Although he no longer owed child support for the last 8 years, Dustin wasn&#39;t qualified for skilled labor and never got farther than being really experienced at entry level positions. <br />
<br />
The house vanished, or more accurately, Dustin was relocated to his crappy one bedroom apartment. The stench of stale tobacco smoke and weed hung in the air. Dustin had never married, he was always a victim of circumstance and that was a major turn off for anyone looking for more than a good time. The bisexual history Ty had given him earlier expanded throughout his adult life. Dustin&#39;s entire history was now a textbook expression of hedonism and he couldn&#39;t bring himself to stay of clear mind long enough to make his life anything more that what it was, chasing after weed, alcohol, or sex.<br />
<br />
Ty was relocated back to the adoption agency. No longer a tween, his chances of being adopted were slim to none, but that didn&#39;t matter now. he had the ability to alter reality. Ty made a small wish to know what had become of Dustin in his new life and spent a good 30 minutes laughing.</p>
