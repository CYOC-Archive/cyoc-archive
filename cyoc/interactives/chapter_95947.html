<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the bar came back from their state of hypnosis I notice that everyone is paired together. <br />
<br />
And even though every one was now somewhat of a bear of a man there was quite a range. There were a few muscle bears. Big strong men that didn&#39;t really fit in with the rest of the crowd but were paired with a man of their own.<br />
<br />
One of these muscle men was paired with a mountain of a man. easily twice the weight of the muscle man.<br />
<br />
There were a couple of big men in a booth both pressing on the edge of the table but just like the bartender had intended these men like to eat.<br />
<br />
The bar tender wanted his bar to sell more food and in return more liqueur so he made all the men that came in good eaters. Some better than others. The salty food made them thirsty. It was a diabolical plan and it worked. Even on the few muscle men he made.<br />
<br />
I noticed the stool that my buddy was sitting on was quite a bit more sturdy than I remembered. But how did I remember. This was all normal. He had always been a big guy and we had always been buddies.<br />
<br />
As I hopped off the stool I occupied I noticed that it seemed to be a lot farther to the floor than I had remembered.<br />
<br />
Then my buddy stood up and he towered over me. I was eyeing him at crotch level. I was impressed with the site but somehow I knew that wasn&#39;t the important part of our relationship.<br />
<br />
I was a midget. I pulled out my wallet and looked at the drivers licence and there my height was at 3&#39;2&quot; I was somewhat round being nearly 250 on the licence so I wasn&#39;t a skinny boy and it looked rounder on me than the belly that loomed over me.<br />
<br />
We headed out and got in my car. For some reason My buddy didn&#39;t have a car and I drove.<br />
<br />
As the time wore on the hypnotic training became more set.<br />
<br />
We went home and I told him to strip. And he did very obediently.<br />
<br />
I was a dominant man in this world. <br />
<br />
AND I LIKED IT!<br />
<br />
I told him to get on the bed and I hooked some shackles to his wrists. Handcuffs would be too flimsy for this man. They were chained to a rigid steel frame that the bed rested over. There was a set of cuffs at the foot of the bed that I could have put on hims but I took his legs and put them in some shackles that had a long chain on them and then started to twist a wheel that pulled his legs up over his head bending the fat man in half. His belly poked out between his legs making it hard for him to see past his belly and hard to breath.  But it exposed his ass ready for my use.<br />
<br />
As I undressed slowly listening him pant trying to get his breath I climbed up on the end of the bed and put my hands on his belly. Grabbing hold and looking into his eyes.<br />
<br />
Hush I commanded as it looked as if he wanted to say something.<br />
<br />
I pulled out my cock and even soft it was massive. It didn&#39;t take long to get it hard and although many men jokingly call their penis a third leg this was literally a third leg on me. It hung down to my toes when soft and when it hardened up it was taller than me and thicker than a two liter bottle.<br />
<br />
I had been shoving sticks of lard up his ass to lube him up and shoved my cock in pushing the three pounds of lard deep inside of him. His body heat would soften them up and the friction of my cock would do the rest.<br />
<br />
I grabbed on to his love handles, yea not really handles they were more like a spare tire from a dump truck. And began thrusting deep inside of him.<br />
<br />
This got him to panting even harder. Not just the size of my penis which he was now use to but just pressing down on his chest repeatedly made him short of breath. I forced the air out of his lungs and soon he passed out from the pressure and the lack of an ability to fill his lungs with enough oxygen to keep him conscious. It was a repeated scene that he and I played out.<br />
<br />
As he lay there I finally came deep inside of him took the plug and shoved it in to hold in my cum and the lard and let his legs down to be secured to the foot of the bed.<br />
<br />
His breathing returned to a labored and eventually to normal.<br />
<br />
His tiny cock didn&#39;t even cum but then he had been trained not to cum unless instructed.<br />
<br />
When we woke from a fitful rest we dressed and headed back to the bar with the plug still lodged in his ass.</p>
