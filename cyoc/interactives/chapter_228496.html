<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh man, what can’t you do.” Wanda says, smirking, “let me think…” she finishes, lifting up the cake again to take another bite.<br />
You weren’t quite sure how these ‘apology favours’ worked quite yet, so you decided to ask Wanda, as she seemed somewhat familiar with this brand new concept.<br />
“I guess I’m just forgetting, give me an example of an apology favour? That isn’t just ‘have me sit on your lap.’” You ask,<br />
“Dude are you okay?” Wanda asks, “like as if you haven’t made me do an apology favour before.”<br />
“Just humor me.”<br />
“Fine. Let’s say… uhm… you ask me to spit in your mouth or something.”<br />
“Seriously?” You reply, mouth open in shock,<br />
“Yeah… it’s not that weird when it’s an apology favour though.”<br />
“Is it… like a sexual thing.”<br />
“You’re messing with me.” Wanda says, rolling her eyes at you, fed up with your game, “y’know what, for your apology favour you can rub my tits for me.”<br />
“Dude…” you say, shocked once again.<br />
“What’s going on?” Wanda says, frustrated, “like are you actually okay.”<br />
“I’m okay. I am.” You lie, “I promise— no I wish you just let me ask my questions and you always answer honestly.”<br />
“Whatever, it’s fine. Now I’m getting bored!” She says, moving her cardigan to show off her tank top.<br />
<br />
Almost naturally, you felt yourself gravitate towards Wanda’s chest. You have to lean across the table, over the drinks to actually get your hands anywhere near her breasts.<br />
It felt weird… not only were you inches away from playing with a girls boobs, but you were in a completely public space, and not a single person seemed to be batting an eye, and not to mention less than two hours ago, Wanda hadn’t even had breasts!<br />
You put your hands on her chest, feeling her bra around her fleshy mounds. They weren’t too huge, but they weren’t too small. They were actually quite nice. If she wasn’t wearing a bra, you’d be able to feel her nipples a little better.<br />
“Ooh…” Wanda moaned, smirking, “been a while since I’ve got an apology favour from you.” She chuckled again, her body reacting a little as you continued to fondle.<br />
“Is this weird for you?”<br />
“Not really… it’s pretty pleasant.” Wanda said with another cocky smirk, now she started leaning back, even putting her hands behind her head to try and mock you in a way,<br />
“So it’s good.”<br />
“As good as it can be,” Wanda started, her body still fidgeting from pleasure a little, “just wish they were a little bigger.”<br />
“Huh?” You asked, continuing to play,<br />
“My tits. Wish they were bigger.”<br />
You hesitated after her response. She opened one eye, she shook her head in confusion, “you stopping already?”<br />
“Uhm… no.” You said, “I wish they were too.”<br />
You didn’t stop or slow down, but you could feel her bosoms changing. The lumps of fat on her chest began to feel thicker and heavier. In your hands, the way your palm held them became a lot more comfortable as they took up more space. They swelled bigger, rounder, shapelier. Gravity pulled on them more and more as they stretched out her tank top more, allowing them to find their own pocket, becoming even more pronounced.<br />
As they grew, you too felt more excited, and began rubbing them, massaging them more and more sensually. You looked at Wanda’s face, she was loving it.<br />
Though you weren’t familiar with how the whole apology favours thing worked, you had a feeling they usually didn’t last this long. Wanda was being especially cheeky.<br />
“Long enough?” You asked, still continuing to play,<br />
“Y-yeah… apology accepted…” Wanda said, her breathing at an irregular place. You took your hands off her chest, and she let out a long sigh.<br />
<br />
Sitting yourself back down in your seat, adrenaline still kind of running, you look at ahead at Wanda, who is currently readjusting her clothes. Looking at her boobs, they’re significantly bigger. Not gigantic, but somewhere around the size of fairly ripe oranges. In her tank top, the line from her cleavage had extended a number of inches too.<br />
Her bust increase, on top of her somewhat weight change was making Wanda sexier and sexier. And even then, she’d just asked you to play with her boobs!<br />
<br />
“Have a good time?” Wanda asked, chuckling to herself, looking down her top to readjust her bra again,<br />
“Yeah… you happy with your tits now?” You joked. Your eyes widened, realising Wanda still doesn’t notice when you make wishes,<br />
“Hah!” She laughed obnoxiously, “you know me.” She said, pulling at the strap of her bra, “I’m never satisfied with the size of my boobs.”<br />
You looked a little puzzled, “really?” You had to ask, “even though they’re…”<br />
“They’re pretty good, don’t get me wrong. But I guess I’ve always wanted bigger boobs anyways.”<br />
<br />
Interesting.<br />
If you were being honest, you wanted nothing more than to fulfil her wish, and make her breasts bigger. Maybe even too big for her, find her limit. She didn’t seem to be satisfied, which was always case even when you knew her as a man. But you stopped yourself… you wanted to play around even more.<br />
<br />
“Hi!” A voice said from next to you. You see that it’s the same waitress from earlier, and she’s holding two cards, “I know I already apologised earlier, but I just wanted to offer both of you one of these.” She said, leaning over and placing the cards on the table, “they’re just free drink offers. You don’t have to use them today, but they’re straight out of my pay check, so don’t worry.” She smiled at the end, clearly still feeling very guilty. Which puzzled you.<br />
“It’s really okay, you sat on my friends lap. That’s more than enough.” You said, pointing to Wanda, who wasn’t quite looking on this young woman in the eyes,<br />
“Huh, oh right! Yeah thanks for that, and these!” Wanda said, grabbing one of the cards, looking at it for less than a second, then looking right back at the waitress, “what’s your name by the way!”<br />
“Dude… it’s Heather, did you not hear her tell us earlier?” You said, putting your hand on your head from embarrassment,<br />
“Oh my bad. I was looking at her ass.” She said candidly, your eyes widened. You quickly looked at the waitress, who was equally shocked and embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“I am so sorry!” You said, trying to not make this more uncomfortable. You looked at Wanda, but she looked confused, like she didn’t even know she did something wrong.<br />
“What? What!?” Wanda said, “I was just telling the truth, being honest, I swear.”<br />
“It’s okay, please.” Heather said, “I appreciate the compliment…” she blushed.<br />
Now you were really puzzled. You couldn’t tell if Heather was uncomfortable or actually turned on by this. You looked at her eyes… they were occasionally glancing down at Wanda’s chest. Maybe she was into this?<br />
<br />
“Fuck it.” You said, you held up the card, “can I get a glass of milk?”</p>
