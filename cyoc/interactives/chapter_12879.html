<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The bell had rung for the first period of class to start, when the history teacher walked through the door, followed by a student who nobody seemed to know. <br />
<br />
“There’s an empty chair over there, Tim. Why don’t you take your seat so that we can get started with class?” Mr. Thompson said to the boy.<br />
<br />
Tim was 15 years old, he was about 6 feet tall, but he looked just a little overweight. He had a friendly face, with short, brown hair and dark brown eyes. He wore blue jeans and a black polo shirt, and he had a necklace which consisted of small, white sea shells around his neck. <br />
<br />
When Tim sat down and opened his blank notebook, he tried not to look over at anyone and to mind his own business. The first day at school was always hard, especially when a new student came from a different school that was out-of-town. Tim had transferred from his high school in Tampa and was now living with his parents in Orlando. The big city had provided new jobs for his parents, but Tim didn’t want to leave his old friends in Tampa. He hated the idea of being in a new school in a large city where he didn’t know anyone, and he decided just to keep to himself since this was only his first day and he didn’t have time to make any new friends yet.<br />
<br />
“Now, we shall continue our discussion on the aftermath of D-Day, when the United States entered the war in Europe during the German occupation” the teacher began to explain. Tim briefly looked around the classroom while the teacher was writing several names and dates on the blackboard. Nobody seemed to pay much attention to him, although a few of the guys were giving him curious looks. <br />
<br />
He figured that someone would introduce himself to him eventually, and it would only be a matter of time before he had a few friends. But at that moment, the new school seemed like a big, lonely place to Tim. He decided to check up on the extracurricular activities so he could see if there were any groups, clubs or teams he wanted to join.<br />
<br />
After two periods of history and two periods of math, all the students went to the cafeteria to grab some lunch. The line was long and crowded, but the food was pretty good. Tim got some spaghetti and corn, with a diet soft drink. He decided to sit on an empty chair at a table which was standing by itself in the corner. <br />
<br />
When all the other tables were full, some of the students started walking over to the table where Tim was sitting at. At first Tim felt a little annoyed that he couldn’t sit and eat his lunch all by himself, and then he realized that it was probably a good opportunity to meet some of the guys at his new school.<br />
<br />
A tall, stocky boy with short, spiky and light brown hair sat down at the chair next to Tim, carrying his tray with the same selection of food that Tim had requested. The boy was wearing a black polo shirt with the “Orlando Magic” logo on his shirt, he was wearing a pair of shorts that belonged to some basketball jersey, and he was wearing the LeBron James basketball shoes. He seemed rather muscular for his age, and Tim immediately guessed that he was a basketball player.<br />
<br />
“Hi…” he said, as he started to take his first bite of his spaghetti.<br />
<br />
“Hey…” Tim answered back. <br />
<br />
“How’s going?” the boy asked him, as he was trying to break the ice. “I saw you in history and in math class this morning. Are you new here?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah…” Tim replied cautiously. “My name is Tim. I just moved from Tampa.”<br />
<br />
“Cool!” the basketball player answered. “I’m Peter! I’m originally from Canada, but I’m living here with Cousin Tyler and Dustin. Ty is also in our class, by the way. So how do you like it here so far?”<br />
<br />
“It’s alright…” Tim said feeling a little disappointed. “I would have preferred sliced carrots over corn, though…”<br />
<br />
Tim then looked back towards Peter, who just smiled.<br />
<br />
“You mean, like that?” Peter said, as he pointed to Tim’s plate.<br />
<br />
Tim looked back down at the plate which was before him and gasped, when he saw that he had sliced carrots on his plate, instead of corn! For a moment, Tim blinked. He wondered if somehow somebody could have switched his plate, for he knew for sure that he had received corn instead of carrots.<br />
<br />
“No, what I meant was, how do you like it at this school, so far?” Peter said, restating the question. Peter just stared at his own plate with a grin on his face as he chewed on his spaghetti. Tim was still in shock, and he had no idea that the boy who was sitting next to him had the power to transform him.<br />
<br />
It’s alright…” Tim said still feeling confused over the corn which had changed to carrots. “I’m just looking for some thing to do after class is over…”<br />
<br />
“Oh there’s plenty to do around here!” Peter chuckled, as he continued to chew on his spaghetti.<br />
<br />
“I figured you’re on the basketball team, right?” Tim guessed, as he looked back at Peter.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, and I’m on the swim team too!” Peter replied. “We could actually use a few new swimmers. Why don’t you come and check out the pool after class? I can show you where it is, and I can introduce you to Steve, who is my coach. And you’ll also get to meet Allen, who is the captain of the swim team.”<br />
<br />
“Cool… well thanks for letting me know about the swim team. I guess I’ll check it out…” Tim said calmly.<br />
<br />
“No problem, dude…” Peter said. Then Peter got up and grabbed his plate, just as Tim had finished all his carrots.<br />
<br />
“Oh, and Tim…” Peter said, before he walked away. Tim turned to face Peter, who was standing besides him.<br />
<br />
“Eat your carrots! They’re good for the eyes!” Peter chuckled, as he turned around and walked towards the garbage can where he threw away all the plastic that was on his tray.<br />
<br />
Tim looked down at his plate and gasped once more when he saw that he had a whole portion of fresh, sliced carrots on his plate! Didn’t he just finish eating all his carrots? Tim wondered if there was something magical about Peter…<br />
<br />
Tim attended the next two periods of English class, followed by one period of Geography, before the long day of class was finally over. As soon as the last bell rang and he had strolled out of the classroom, Peter suddenly appeared standing before him.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Tim…” he said with a smile. “Let me lead you to the swimming pool where I can introduce you to my teammates…”<br />
<br />
Peter then walked out the main building and walked towards the gym. It was just behind the gym where the track, the pool, the basketball court and the football field were located.<br />
<br />
Just besides the pool was a small building which contained the locker rooms, storage room, and the office of the coach and his staff.<br />
<br />
When the two students arrived at the pool, another tall student with muscular build and short, red hair walked up to Peter.<br />
<br />
“Hey Peter,” Allen said to him. “I’m glad you’re here. Most guys are out of town this weekend, so it’s just the three of us. We can swim a few laps, since there isn’t much going on right now…”<br />
<br />
“Hey Allen, this is Tim…” Peter said to Allen, as he introduced Tim to him for the first time. “Tim is interested in joining the swim team…”<br />
<br />
“Cool… good… very good” Allen said, as he examined Tim from head to toe. A wide grin appeared on his face, signaling to Peter that Allen liked what he saw in Tim. <br />
<br />
“Well, you look pretty strong…” Allen said with a smile. “Let’s see how fast you are in the water…”<br />
<br />
Peter and Tim then walked into the locker room where they changed. Peter had his navy blue Speedo on, but Tim was wearing a pair of beach shorts. Tim was feeling embarrassed, and he decided not to wear a Speedo to his first practice. But Tim wasn’t aware of the fact that Peter had picked up on his small size, using his psychic powers.<br />
<br />
Peter and Tim finally dove in the pool and swam their laps from one end of the pool to the other. They practiced the breaststroke and the backstroke, and they were pretty good, only Peter was just faster than Tim. Allen realized that Tim was probably feeling a bit nervous, since this was his first day at school and this was his first practice session.<br />
<br />
About forty-five minutes later, the three guys had gotten out of the pool and were standing around talking, when a short girl with long, brown hair walked by the group of swimmers. She was wearing jeans and a nice shirt, and she had sunglasses on. Tim noticed that the girl immediately walked up to Peter.<br />
<br />
Allen walked up to Tim, as Peter was talking to Joce.<br />
<br />
“Who’s that?” Tim wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“Oh that’s Joce.” Allen replied. “She’s Peter’s new girlfriend… I guess Peter’s a lucky guy, huh?”<br />
<br />
“No, not really…” Tim replied. “I’m not really into girls, you know?”<br />
<br />
In a way, the remark made Allen feel happy. Allen began to show a liking towards Tim. Tim was still kind of timid and shy, and Allen noticed that he struggled with keeping up with Peter while he was swimming his laps in the pool. Allen understood how hard it must have been for Tim to be new in town and to be the new guy in school, and he decided that he wanted to be friends with him.<br />
<br />
Allen thought about Tim for awhile, and he realized that Tim could definitely use some help. He saw that Tim needed to grow a little more, and that he could use a little more muscle and height as well. Then he got an idea! He waited for Peter to finish talking to Joce.<br />
<br />
“Hey Tim,” Allen said to him. “Give me a minute, and I’ll talk a few things over with Peter…”<br />
<br />
As soon as Joce was gone, Allen pulled Peter aside and started to talk to him, while Tim sat down on the wooden bench which was by the entrance of the locker room.<br />
<br />
“So, Peter…” Allen began. “Where did you meet your friend?”<br />
<br />
“I just met him today, while we had lunch in the cafeteria” Peter explained. “So what do you think of him?”<br />
<br />
“Well, he’s kind of cute…” Allen pondered. “He can use more muscle, just like you!”<br />
<br />
Allen then chuckled, as he saw Peter’s pectorals expand a little bit. Allen then made his biceps grow a little bit as well.<br />
<br />
“Hey, go easy on the muscle growth, okay?” Peter chuckled. “Leave some muscle for Joce! She’s got to grow me too, you know?”<br />
<br />
“Peter, I got an idea…” Allen said to him. “How about you give me the power to change Tim?”<br />
<br />
“Why?” Peter responded, with a confused look on his face.<br />
<br />
“I think he can use a little growth here and there…” Allen said, as he looked back at the new kid on the team. “And I find him kind of cute… Look, if you give me the power to change Tim, then I won’t mess with you anymore. What do you think?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, it doesn’t bother me. You can still change me whenever you want. So, you want me to give you the power to change Tim as well?” Peter asked him, just to confirm what Allen was asking him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… I would really like that…” <br />
<br />
“Alright, then. But remember, Tim is new at school and he doesn’t know anybody… So for you to start changing him right away, that might come as a shock to him. Don’t do anything to freak him out!” Peter grinned. “I turned his corn into sliced carrots today, and he was very confused. So, be considerate, alright?”<br />
<br />
“No problem…” Allen replied. “I’ll take care of Tim like he was my very own brother…”<br />
<br />
“Good…” Peter said, as he closed his eyes for a moment. “You got your power…”<br />
<br />
“Excellent…” Allen whispered to himself. <br />
<br />
Then Peter walked to the locker room with Tim and they changed back into their normal clothes, before heading back home. Allen let Tim hang out with Peter, since Peter was the one to meet him first.<br />
<br />
“Starting tomorrow…” Allen thought to himself, as he watched Peter and Tim walk down the street, “You’re going to be all mine, Tim…”<br />
<br />
Allen walked into the locker room and got ready to take a shower. When he closed his eyes he saw what Tim was doing and how he was feeling.<br />
<br />
When Tim got home from school and swimming practice, he started to feel very tired all of the sudden.<br />
<br />
“I want you to become sleepy” Allen thought to himself, as he wished for Tim to go to bed early. “Get some good rest, and starting tomorrow you’ll be feeling like a new man!”<br />
<br />
Allen just laughed as he closed his eyes. He felt Tim dozing off on his bed…<br />
<br />
What would Allen do to help Tim out, using his new powers?</p>
