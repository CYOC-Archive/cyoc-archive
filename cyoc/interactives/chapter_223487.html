<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle stepped out onto a concrete porch with his multitude of bare feet, the warm pavement sending shivers up his spin, his legs moving in a strangely circular pattern moving more like a starfish than a person. Looking around he found they now lived in what could only be called suburbia, green hedges and white picket fences adorned the yards in surrounding houses, it was all his mom ever wanted, so at least that went right.  He got over to the car and his mother started unloading bags, but instead of placing them in his hands, she places them on the shelf of flesh made by the new asses in the second row. <br />
<br />
“I just want to see what your capable of now, if your careful you could probably walk all the bags in at once!” His mom beamed, he feigned a smile, trying not to scream as she placed more weight on his multiple asses. Once finished Kyle slowly turned around and gingerly walked into the house, with twenty bags of groceries on him he was surprised at the gracefulness of his movements. He managed to carry the groceries into the kitchen and stopped as his mother removed all of the bags and placed them on the table.<br />
<br />
“Okay honey, you can go and enjoy yourself now.... I know I would.” She said, again with a lusty voice, almost as if she was envious, Kyle shivered and rushed to his bedroom, nearly tripping over himself as he got through his door and shut it, he collapsed on the floor, all of his legs naturally sitting on their heels he wrapped his arms around himself and rocked there for a while. How was he going to deal with all of this? What if he was forced to use the curse again, would it make him screw himself up more? Was it because of how Jen worded her curse? Was the curse punishing him for what he did to Jen? He didn&#39;t want to find out, fortunately he didn&#39;t have to go to school anymore, so he could get away with not seeing his friends, maybe that would work. He gathered himself and slowly stood back up, his bedroom had changed again, a bigger bed, larger wardrobe, his desk and gaming computer were lower to the ground, which made sense, no chair would support the body he had now. He spent the rest of his night in his room, even eating there, his mother winking as she handed him dinner, he winked back, trying not to think of what she thought he was doing. Kyle finally went to sleep at midnight, the crowd of legs in his bed making it difficult to lay down, he finally just sat, his legs tilted to the sides, and found that it was the most comfortable he had been in a long time.<br />
<br />
A few weeks had gone by, he had gotten used to his twenty six legs, the sensations now second nature to him, the rhythmic movements of his multitude of hips becoming almost comforting. His mother&#39;s behavior had gotten a little weirder, but not too perverted, he told her it was kind of uncomfortable for him, but she persisted, almost acting as if she was a sister making dirty jokes with him. Kyle work up the courage to walk around outside, finding the sun comforting as well, it was today that he decided to really get out of the house, being at home constantly was making him a little crazy. He walked down to continence store he knew was down the street, a little fearful of running into someone he knew, but bravely moving forward. He turned the corner and stopped, walking out of the store was an old friend, Alex, who noticed him.<br />
<br />
“Kyle?” Kyle tried to walk away, “DUDE!” Alex ran over and hugged him. “Look at you, you look great, dig the style, wish I could pull this off.” Kyle felt a screaming presence in the back of his mind, the curse wanted to be used.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it&#39;s pretty nice, I bet you could pull this off, by the way, who do you think has the nicest legs in your family?” Kyle found himself saying.<br />
<br />
“Oh, let me think...” Alex said. While Alex thought of an answer they carried on conversation as if everything was normal, Kyle for his part was chanting a mantra in the back of his head. <br />
<br />
“Please don&#39;t give me more. Please don&#39;t give me more.” <br />
<br />
“Oh hey! I&#39;ve got to say that my sister has the best legs in the family! Why, you think I&#39;d look good with a bunch like yours?” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, in fact. Transform or Dare?”<br />
<br />
“Dude, really? Transform dude!”<br />
<br />
“So for your transformation, you&#39;ll grow six pairs of your sister&#39;s legs, surrounding you like mine, they&#39;ll be clothed just like her right now, and you&#39;ll never have any health problems because of these new additions. They won&#39;t have any wombs, but pocket pussies you can play with. Everyone will treat this a normal, and your sister will treat this as a compliment!” <br />
<br />
Kyle watched as Alex was changed, the six new legs grew in lifting his original pair up by a full foot, then each were clad in a pair of short shorts and wedge heels.<br />
<br />
“DUDE! I LOOK AWESOME!” Alex practically spun around looking at all of his new slim and athletic legs. “Hey, I&#39;ve got to repay you. Transform or Dare.”<br />
<br />
“Transform.” Kyle found himself saying, he now knew the wording of Jen&#39;s curse was at play and internally he screamed.<br />
<br />
“Okay, dude! For your transformation, first, I think you should be able to show those legs off better, so all of your pairs are going to turn around, so they face outward, second, chicks don&#39;t have dicks, so you&#39;ll lose both of them, third since you&#39;ve got a weird number there, you&#39;ll lose the center pair, cause I think you should even out, and last....” <br />
<br />
“DON&#39;T YOU FUCKING DARE!” Kyle screamed internally.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re gonna get magic powers.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean magic powers?” Kyle was surprised, he thought this was going to go much worse for him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah dude, I can&#39;t help but see your naked from the waist down, it&#39;s really hot but you may wanna get some clothes on sometime, and with all those legs it&#39;s crazy hard. So last you&#39;ll have the magic ability to make anything you want appear on your body, shoe, clothes, even sex toys if you catch my drift. That way you don&#39;t have to bother with dressing all those sexy legs of yours.” Kyle felt his body shifting, he would miss having those cocks as he felt them shrink away, his center pair of legs melted with them, leaving an awkward hole in the center of his twelve pairs of legs, but they started to shift, one by one, each pair rotated so that their feet pointed outward until each pair was facing in it&#39;s new configuration, the space in the center being shifted so that the waists of the legs now connected much more closely. It looked as if Kyle&#39;s original legs never existed, he looked down, and found that his body now seemed strange to him again.<br />
<br />
“Dude! Try out your power! I wanna see it!” Kyle paused, and thought of some clothing he wanted, suddenly he felt soft denim against all twelve pairs of his legs, his feet felt lifted off the ground as each pair were clad in the same wedge heels Alex was wearing, he looked down, and saw that each of his pairs were clad in bell bottom jeans, even his bra and blouse changed, making him much more comfortable.<br />
<br />
“Hey, thanks Alex! This is really handy!” Kyle and Alex chatted for a while longer, and parted ways, Kyle shopped for what he had come for and went home, feeling confident in his chice fashion. Getting home he heard his mother gasp.<br />
<br />
“Kyle! Where did you get those jeans, I simply must have a pair!” <br />
<br />
“Oh, they just magically appeared!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, shit... I forgot you could do that. Could I have a pair?” <br />
<br />
“Sure!” Kyle took off three pairs, and gave them to his mother. “I can just make more.” He made three more appear, which he thought would make the others disappear, but they didn&#39;t. “Huh, interesting.” Kyle thought. He would spend the rest of the night exploring this new power, experimenting with different looks on his strange body. By midnight he finally crawled into bed, his legs now allowing for a much more comfortable sleep, as he fell asleep he mused to himself whether he should change his name, being pretty much completely female now.</p>
