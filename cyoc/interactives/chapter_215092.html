<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erin decided her kinky dick arc was still underway when she replaced &quot;intentionally&quot; to &quot;incidentally;&quot; the sentence now read &quot;Erin is incidentally pleasuring herself to make Trish horny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Confirming the modifications changed things up. Erin was no longer looking at the bottom of the dinner table and now was looking at the bottom of a set of shower controls. Behind her and to her left were glass walls with a one tile lip to keep water in. She assumed one of them was the door. To her right was a wall with a pipe running down from above with a shower wand screwed onto the end. Helping hold it up was a small wooden platform just big enough for the shampoo, body wash, and sponges placed on it. Erin assumed these were for her.<br />
<br />
Erin was glad her phone was secure in a watertight case–she could tell what was about to happen.<br />
<br />
Trish turned on the water and Erin could start to see rivulets form in the rainbow hairs as surface tension kept them from falling onto her, at least most of the drops. She was fascinated with seeing the phenomenon in action, seeing the droplets form a trail along the centaur&#39;s barrel, diverting to run down her forelegs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want us to stink when we get to the beach, so make sure you clean yourself extra well,&quot; Trish instructed her.<br />
<br />
Erin could agree to that. She didn&#39;t notice it when she woke up, but when she was emerging from the sheath she could smell the funk coming from her. It was time to wash it off for the day ahead.<br />
<br />
Putting her phone on her little shelf and grabbing the shower wand she started to rinse off her whole body. The feeling of the warm water splashing against and running down her skin and hair had a mild electrifying feel to it.<br />
<br />
With her skin now wet she swapped the wand for a sponge and body wash. Squirting a little in the sponge, she set the bottle down on the tile floor and got to work scrubbing her head and shoulders.<br />
<br />
Running the sponge against her skin was predictably stimulating, although it was still novel to Erin to experience it firsthand. While she was scrubbing behind her ears, she was taken by surprise when Trish loosened up their bladder. Just like last night Erin was consumed by the feeling of urine flowing through her and made her freeze in surprise. The stream coming from her mouth hit the half-empty soap bottle squarely and knocked it over.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sorry, I had to do it. I forgot how good it felt when you washed. If we didn&#39;t go now it would have been after we ran out of hot water,&quot; Trish apologized. Erin couldn&#39;t say anything back as the piss flowed past her lips but she didn&#39;t mind. It was just as good as before.<br />
<br />
When the flow started to peter out, Erin squeezed their bladder a few times before the flow stopped. The last few drops came out when she swallowed, and then she hung there dumbly for a few moments to collect herself.<br />
<br />
Having allowed the pleasure to pass, Erin collected the overturned body wash bottle and got back to lathering herself in it. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t feel bad, it was a fun surprise,&quot; Erin finally got to answer Trish&#39;s earlier apology, &quot;in fact I&#39;ve decided you can do that whenever you want,&quot; she put a playful lilt in that statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, perhaps I should...&quot; Trish replied in an equally playful tone, suppressing a shiver as she paused her back scrubbing. Trish was clearly being inadvertently turned on by her dick washing itself as Erin switched back to rinsing off her head.<br />
<br />
When she was done with this round of rinsing, Erin went back to the sponge and cleaned her chest and back. &quot;Mmf!&quot; Trish exclaimed. A horny haze was beginning to descend over Erin and Trish&#39;s thoughts.<br />
Swapping the handheld sponge for a sponge on a stick, Erin cleaned around her knots. The speed of the sponge picked up as Erin and Trish got off to the sensation. The stick sponge only managed to reach the sheath entrance, and Erin still had to clean the inside. Staging the sponge and soap closer to the sheath, she grabbed the wand again and folded herself in two. She was now facing upward, forehead pressing into her dick self right between the knots.<br />
<br />
This was the first time Erin had gotten up close and personal with her knots. They were partially inflated thanks to their owners&#39; horny state and were currently as big as volleyballs.<br />
<br />
With her forehead pressed against herself, she couldn&#39;t see what she was doing but she could feel around which was enough to get the job done.<br />
<br />
Grabbing part of the sheath in one hand, she sprayed water into the chasm with the other, switching spots to get more of the inside wet. She left the top of the sheath for last which turned out to be a wise idea since it was the most difficult part. Not in terms of reach, she could do that fine, but because her arms were forced to rub against her knots, eliciting some sharp breathing from Trish. Erin meanwhile hadn&#39;t taken a breath in a few minutes she was so concentrated on completing the washing.<br />
<br />
Reaching toward the ground behind her, she groped around until her hands landed on the soap and sponge. She blindly poured the body wash out, hoping to get some on both sides of the sponge.<br />
<br />
It was a race against the clock now. Erin could feel her knots expanding and was fighting a pressure in her core trying to force her straight. Armed with the sponge, she looped one arm around herself to try and resist being flipped back. She forced the sponge in between her body and the sheath and began scrubbing in a fast sawing motion. This was extremely pleasurable but Erin&#39;s desire to finish cleaning was stronger than her desire to finish.<br />
<br />
She worked the sponge around the sheath in a clockwise manner. At the top she left the sponge inside the sheath so she could change arms and complete the circle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erin, I&#39;m close!&quot; Trish alerted her. Erin didn&#39;t need to be told, she could feel it too–more vividly than Trish could imagine.<br />
<br />
Scrubbing finished, Erin practically threw the sponge on the ground as she grabbed the wand to rinse. Mouth dribbling precum, the partial dog-dick quickly sprayed the inside getting all the suds out. <br />
<br />
Right as she finished, it was too much. &quot;Aaah, I&#39;m cumming!&quot;<br />
<br />
Those massive balls tensed, their prostate squeezed, and Erin shot back to the natural position just in time for a huge wad of semen to come flying through and splat against the tiled wall in front of her.<br />
<br />
Erin tensed and rocked in time with the pulses as their prostate kept pumping semen through her. Her whole brain and being was in a fog as she rubbed her forearms against her sides to get as much stimulation as possible. Further up, her knots were pulsing too, getting as big as overinflated basketballs as they tried to seal off a nonexistent tunnel. Erin lost count of how many gobs of cum she expelled after about the fifth one. It was a lot. Semen was piling up against the wall faster than it was draining away, creating a small mountain of it where it collected on the floor. Their climax kept on chugging and more and more semen sprayed against the wall that it the mountain stopped growing and cum was flowing out and filling the shower basin.<br />
<br />
After countless waves, the climax was over and their balls had nothing left to give. The two of them just stood there limply, Trish leaning against the side wall of the shower out of breath, hooves sunk in the 1&quot; deep semen, and Erin slowly being freed from whatever had locked her in the ejaculation position.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am glad... that filling the pool... was a one-time thing...&quot; Trish panted, &quot;because I don&#39;t think... we would have made it... otherwise...&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin washed her mouth clean of what semen was left and grabbed her phone. She idly generated a new sentence to edit as she chatted with Trish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I think that would cause problems if we were that proglrblorble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin had inadvertently swallowed after rinsing her mouth out, forgetting that her &quot;throat&quot; was wired the opposite way, and the last gob of cum filled her mouth while she was talking.<br />
<br />
She spit it out and continued, &quot;sorry, it would cause problems if we were that productive all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we are that productive all the time, its just that we were at the clinic for a few days with no relief,&quot; Trish filled in. This experience was good information the future. The last time Erin washed herself was right after they filled the pool and were still in the refractory period.<br />
&quot;Now we know to come in the pool first any time you need a wash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, that doesn&#39;t sound so bad,&quot; Erin replied.<br />
<br />
Erin finally glanced down at the sentence her phone gave her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erin finds it difficult to speak with semen in her mouth.&quot;</p>
