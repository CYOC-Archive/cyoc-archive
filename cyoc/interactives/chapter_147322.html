<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I stared down at my helpless captive and smiled deviously. The dark streak that had been in me for so many years was now fully manifested. My hatred of people, my objectification of women, my cruel tendencies carefully hidden. The ring would let me engage them in full.<br />
<br />
I was going to fuck up the world now. Do what I wanted to who I wanted. I was a God.<br />
<br />
I cackled menacingly as tiny Reham laid there and cried, shivering. She looked away submissively as I stared at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;First things first.&quot; I grinned, feeling my erection grow stiffer. &quot;As much fun as it would be to break your tiny body into pieces, I think you may have your uses yet. So...&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl trembled and laid flat on the table. She said nothing, she only tried to remain calm. It was wonderful to feel this much power over another human being.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish for you to grow back to half of your original size. Slowly. Painfully.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reham gasped on the table and desperately pushed herself up to a kneeling as the sensations of agonizing growth kicked in. She let out a tiny squeak, breaking into a warm sweat, as my will overtook her flesh and forced her to begin growing in size. Her tiny face scrunched up, she began to shake in tense pain. She let out a cry and lowered her head groaning as she pushed forward from twelve inches. Every milimeter was a struggle, I could see her body tensing from the racking pulling and stretching aching through her.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t the least bit pleasurable. She doubled over and began crying, arms wrapped tight around herself trying to lessen it. She flailed and gasped on the table. She grew to the size of a child&#39;s doll. I could see her color turning from a washed out brown to a reddish mud, every nerve, every cell, every inch of her feeling the same horrible agony. As she stretched. And grew. And pulled. And twisted.<br />
<br />
Eventually it became too much, she started screaming. I only laughed as she reached three feet tall and gained a couple more inches. She was curled into a trembling shivering ball on my table as she tried to regain her breath and cried hysterically.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s enough!&quot; I slammed my fist down on the table in front of her head, making her jump in terror and stagger to a weak standing position before me. Her eyes widened and she sobbed silently.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sorry... sorry master.&quot; Reham said weakly. &quot;I was not strong enough to resist making such noise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As it should be.&quot; I cupped her tiny chin between my fingers and pushed her away dismissively. &quot;Remember that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes master.&quot; The girl said sadly, and looked down to her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now!&quot; I stood, grinning as she saw my bulge and averted her eyes nervously. &quot;Next! I wish that if you leave my apartment, either stepping outside the door or any window, that you&#39;ll spontaneously burst into flames and die.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reham gasped and let out a cry as I grabbed her in my hands and awkwardly picked her up by the arms and legs. She struggled helplessly and grimaced as I carried her over to the front door and smiled mavolently.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; She screamed, gasping. &quot;No, please!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s make sure it works!&quot; I laughed, and held her towards the door. The second she reached an inch of it, she screamed louder as her flesh began smoldering and smoking instantaneously. The putrid scent of singed skin hung in the air and I laughed hysterically as she went limp in my grip and started crying again. I carried her over to the window and repeated the process, watching her body begin smoking and drawing her away before she incinerated.<br />
<br />
I set her down in the middle of my living room floor and stared down with a smile as she stared back with pure hatred in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Planning on escaping, weren&#39;t you?&quot; I taunted. &quot;My little pet isn&#39;t so loyal after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are a monster.&quot; Reham spat, a growl in her voice. In her tiny helpless state she still channeled absolute rage. It was adorable.<br />
<br />
I laughed and kicked her squarely in the stomach, causing her to double over onto the carpet gasping for breath. &quot;You&#39;re three foot nothing. Don&#39;t forget, you little bitch, I can snuff you out without so much as a thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
She regained her composure and stared at the carpet. Though defeated, she was clearly plotting.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, my pet.&quot; I sat down on the couch and stared at the shrunken woman. &quot;What should we do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will kill you.&quot; She snarled. &quot;I don&#39;t know how, or when, but I will. This I swear to you, monster. You will have to destroy me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how can you do that without any hands?&quot; I shrugged.<br />
<br />
Reham&#39;s eyes widened and she stared up at me in terror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgot, didn&#39;t you? Oh, well, you&#39;ll learn.&quot; I laughed diabolically. &quot;I wish you&#39;d turn into a camel but keep your mind. Seems fitting for a little terrorist like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
All at once, shrunken Reham grunted. Already on her hands and knees, her body began to twist rapidly. Her reduced clothing stretched and swelled and tore around her as bristles of fur began to emerge around a fattening and warping body. She barely got out a cry before her face was overtaken by a camel muzzle. Her voice faded to an animalistic grunt as she swelled, her ass grew, and a tail poked out above her pants. These were quickly shredded as she grew and grew into a furry quadruped. Her arms and legs lengthened, her joints snapped, her humps formed. Her breasts deflated, her torso barreled, her ears grew pointed. Where moments ago there had been a shrunken woman, there was now a devastated and deeply panting shrunken camel, wearing the remains of a pink sweater and tattered torn jeans that hung off her flank awkwardly.<br />
<br />
The shrunken camel stood awkwardly, tipping and staggering left and right on the carpet, her remaining clothing constrictive and limiting her unfamiliar movements. I laughed hysterically as she hit my coffee table and fell over, struggling to get back up with a pained chuff from her heavy nostrils. Her loosened head scarf fell away onto the ground. She stared at it with obvious pain on her face. She had lost her humanity now. Her identity. That would teach the little mouthy arab bitch.<br />
<br />
Eventually, she found her footing, standing on knobby shaking knees, and stared up at me pathetically. Her posture said everything I needed to know. Her head was lowered, her ears were back, she trembled softly. I could see the camel thing crying again, tears rolling down her long furry face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to let you think about this for a while.&quot; I rose from the couch, chuckling, and offered the defeated and devastated Reham the camal a snarky grin. &quot;You know, I think I like you this way. You talk less.&quot;<br />
<br />
The camel nodded gently and kicked one of her front legs onto the carpet, lowering her head mournfully and closing her eyes in emotional pain. She shook herself and the tatters of her shirt let go, plopping to the ground beneath her. I heard her chuff and lie down there on the carpet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell, I might never turn you back into a human. You people aren&#39;t even people anyway.&quot; I laughed as I approached the door and grabbed my coat.<br />
<br />
She shot me a sudden death glare, which, as a camel was even more pronounced. Again, I shrugged. &quot;I can take away your human consciousness, too, if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
She gulped loudly in response and shook her head desperately.<br />
<br />
&quot;No? Don&#39;t wanna be a full animal? Or...&quot; I paused, twirling my keys around my finger. &quot;Or maybe little camel Reham should have her mind damaged in such a way that you&#39;re forced to live as a camel but know you&#39;re still in there. Like riding in a body you can&#39;t control. Fuck, I bet I could sell you to a zoo that way. Can you imagine?&quot;<br />
<br />
She stood up in horror and shook her head desperately, mouthing &quot;no&quot; over and over again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! I have a better idea!&quot; I kneeled down, watching the camel thing reel backwards into the living room, mouth agape, eyes wide. &quot;How about another animal all together? Camel is too good for you. I bet worm might be a better fit. Yeah. Or why not something even more simple? I bet you&#39;d make a good amoeba. Or a single cell.&quot;<br />
<br />
She staggered back in abject terror at her potential fate and fell onto her heavy ass as she hit the tv stand, shaking her head no.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or... maybe I should just kill you.&quot; I snapped my fingers. &quot;Why bother playing this game at all? If you&#39;re going to insist on defying me, I can just make you dead right now. Snuff you out. Bam. Dead. Gone. No more Reham.&quot;<br />
<br />
The camel cried out and awkwardly bounded forward on all fours, stumbling desperately and throwing herself down at my feet for mercy. She even started licking my shoes!<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish..&quot; I began, watching the camel&#39;s face shoot up with as much of a horrified expression as a camel could reasonably make. I laughed evilly and nodded to myself. &quot;I wish you&#39;d turn into a camel woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
The camel gasped, crackled, and let out a huff as she began to morph a second time. From a full camel, her back crackled, her humps shrank, and her humanoid body began to return. Her hands grew back from her front hooves, her arms shortened, her physique and breasts swelled under her fur, and in moments I had a shrunken camel woman instead of just a camel.<br />
<br />
The anthropomorphic creature stood slowly on two chunky cloven hooves. She clattered backwards on the kitchen tile and stared at herself and then me.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not a bad looking camel bitch.&quot; I shrugged. &quot;But you&#39;re never going to be a human being again. That&#39;s your punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes...&quot; Reham nodded, clutching her arms around herself and gulping. &quot;Yes, I understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say it.&quot; I commanded. &quot;Mean it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, master.&quot; She looked up at me pathetically and I could see that I had broken her. It was earnest, honesty. She understood the power I wielded. She stroked her thick fingers through her brown fur nervously and nodded again. &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; I grinned. &quot;Now clean up this apartment. All of it. I&#39;m going out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes, master.&quot; The little camel woman said submissively. All hint of emotion in her voice was gone. She turned and reached for a broom that stood twice her height and began sweeping, her little shapely furry body wriggling with each movement, as I laughed and left the apartment.</p>
