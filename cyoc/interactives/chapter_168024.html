<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I know the pun in the title is awful I couldn’t help it okay</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The glow subsided, but the heat certainly didn&#39;t. Jane felt like she was on fire, especially her skin... though it was strange. It didn&#39;t burn, like the one time she had been dumb enough to wave her hand through a flame, but the heat was still intense, raging within her senses. She worried the AC might have unexpectedly gone out on her... until she looked down to her hands, and realized her skin was changing color. Graying, to a gunmetal shade not dissimlar to how most of the jets looked.<br />
<br />
That was a bit worrying.<br />
<br />
Even more worrying was the sudden discomfort that flooded her gut, causing her to double over with arms crossed over her stomach. She coughed, grunting as it seemed like her insides were churning, burning away. What made her eyes truly go wide, though, was the sound of some metal gear ka-chunking inside her gut... and the realization that she had felt that gear, not just heard it. &quot;What the fu-&quot;<br />
<br />
The feeling soon spready through the rest of her body, internal organs from head to toe crunching and swirling as she heard yet more odd mechanical sounds from within. Her skin had now completely ceased to be what she would even call skin, now more like... metal, almost, like the platings that they put on the exterior of fighters.<br />
<br />
Fighters. The image of the jets flashed in her mind. Was this... was this because of the wish she&#39;d made? She had no further time to consider it as a pain emerged in her back. She groaned, falling down onto all fours as it felt like her epidermis was being split open. A cry with an oddly filtered tinge to it left her mouth as she felt the pain explode, only to be relieved as something seemed to slip out from her back on each side. She first caught glimpse of the growths in her reflection from the turned-off TV screen before craning her neck to view what had emerged.<br />
<br />
&quot;...fucking wings?!&quot; Her jaw dropped open, both at the sight of the new attachments, and the husky, mechanical tone of her own voice. Those were fucking <i>wings</i>. A bit of a delta shape, just like the F-35s... same color scheme, too. The impossible realization slammed into her just as she felt her arms gain an immense amount of weight; she glanced down to her forearms, watching with an incredulous stare as metal seemed to grow on the sides. Quickly the metal formed into round objects, gaining definition and a great many small parts, all of which she could feel like they had nerve ends wired through them.<br />
<br />
The lieutenant blinked, her blue eyes having now become a steel gray color. &quot;Are these... fucking... mini-miniguns?&quot; Well, autocannon was a more correct term, but that wasn&#39;t her concern right now. They were small, compared to what most of the fighters mounted, but she was pretty sure the explosive rounds that now fed from belts training into her shoulders hit just as hard. Maybe that wasn&#39;t all that surprising - this was, after all, some downright magic shit.<br />
<br />
Terror at her condition had been replaced with fascination at the outright impossible changes happening to her body when she felt the first ping. It was horribly disorienting the first few times, but slowly she realized it was some sort of radar, the signals bouncing off her surroundings. She could still see what was in front of her, but at the same time, she could sense the outline of everything nearby. Another freaky sensation filled her head, the buzzing of radio signals - she could hear freaking radio now, needing only a bit of focus to change the frequency. <br />
<br />
She gasped as a feeling of shifting and moving spread over her chest. Her nipples seemed to subsume themselves within her breasts, as the size of her endowments suddenly increased by a great deal - while retaining the same sensitivity as before. The now large, rounded endowments somehow still seemed aerodynamic, even as she felt them fill with liquid. Milk? No, that was... that was jet fuel. It made sense, she supposed, but it didn&#39;t make it any less weird, nor any less oddly arousing as she felt the fuel slosh around. Paint appeared around it, instructions on how to open the dark spots of her areolas for refueling - god knows the maintenance boys would pay attention now.<br />
<br />
A sheath formed between her hips, right over her nethers; an armored plate, albeit one that seemed retractable, thank god. A similar one appeared between her cheeks, keeping that orifice protected alongside her rear end&#39;s increase in size. Her hips indeed seemed quite a bit wider, and the reason for that became apparent with a pleasurable surge along her sides. The curve of her hips altered, becoming a bit more angular as a pair of thrusters emerged, one on each side. She quickly experimented, finding that she could shift her legs around to shift their orientation - it would take a bit of getting used to, but the potential mobility was breaktaking.<br />
<br />
With a final shudder as an intake vent rose along the center of her back, she could feel the heat subsiding, an apparent sign that her transformation had finished. A few moments of panting on the floor proceeded before she rushed to her bedroom, taking in the spectacle of her new form in the mirror. <br />
<br />
It was, in a word, breathtaking. She still had a roughly human shape, with head and torso and arms and legs, but with all her new additions... she looked like a cross between a person and a jet, as strange as that was to imagine. The engine that had taken the place of her heard swelled with pride at the sight of the USAF livery painted all over her metallic skin, and at her hair, now long and flowing in alternating streaks of patriotic red, white, and blue. New instincts filled her mind - to fly, to take off into the wild blue yonder... and to blow some shit up, either with the miniguns on her arms, or missiles attached to the hardpoints visible on her wings.<br />
<br />
Whatever she did next, Jane was sure of one thing. &quot;This is so goddamn fucking cool!&quot;</p>
