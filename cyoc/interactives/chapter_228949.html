<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heading to the foyer, Hailey quickly spotted her partner Henry and Geshp standing beneath the overhang. &quot;Hurry,&quot; Henry called. &quot;We&#39;ve been in contact with HQ. The portal will only be open for a few moments to get Kyra out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the children,&quot; Kyra replied nervously. Hailey glanced back, noting the nervousness on the vampire queens face. &quot;We&#39;re going to open it again as soon as the kids are secure,&quot; she said. &quot;For right now just follow us so we can get you to safety.&quot; Kyra bit her lip, an anxious expression on her face before nodding. As the group looked to cross the foyer to the secured exit, they could hear the sound of a door being thrown open. &quot;Well Well what do we have here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hailey and the group paused, watching as Camillia and seven cybernetic vampires now entered the foyer. &quot;My dear queen you wouldn&#39;t be trying to escape would you?&quot; Kyra&#39;s eyes went wide, Hailey and the others now stoic as they realized they would need to fight their way out. &quot;Go,&quot; Nat stated. &quot;Get Kyra out of here. Lilith can find the others while I handle them.&quot; Hailey paused, looking at the teenage dhamphir in surprise. It didn&#39;t seem right leaving this girl alone. Haileys orders were to rescue the hostages, not lose any of the rescuers. Still, studying the auburn haired teenager Hailey could sense something. Somehow this girl wasn&#39;t in danger. Despite the odds being against her, Hailey could sense Nat would be okay. Sprinting out of the room, Hailey now left Nat by herself with an obviously perturbed devil.<br />
<br />
&quot;Handle us,&quot; Camillia replied, obviously annoyed. &quot;You think you can handle us? I think it&#39;s time we teach you some respect.&quot; With a motion, Camillia instructed her soldiers forward. Nat taking a breath as the seven cybernetic vampires now aimed their submachine guns at the dhamphir. The sound of gunfire now echoed through the room, the vampires unloading their weapons at Nat. To their surprise though, Nat was uninjured.<br />
<br />
Nat&#39;s practice had paid dividends, the dhamphir able to make herself corporeal, allowing the bullets to pass harmlessly through her. As the last bullet passed through her, she now assumed a fighting stance as Camillia grumbled. &quot;Okay you have some skill,&quot; she frowned. &quot;Kill her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tossing down their weapons, the vampires charged forward, allowing Nat to show off Akiras training. Countering and attacking the cybernetic vampires, the dhamphir teen easily managed to knock the vampires away. With a jumping spin kick, one now crashed through a marble railing, the sickening sound of his neck breaking heard above the fray. Realizing that hand to hand combat was a fools errand, the vampires now grabbed for weapons that decorated the room, trying to slay the dhamphir.<br />
<br />
Nat&#39;s training was now put to the test, attempting to incapacitate the armed vampires with just punches and kicks. It now forced her to fight more defensively looking for an opening to strike. Despite the obvious skill and ferocity of the vampires Nat was able to hold her own. Dodging out of the way, the teen watched as one of the vampires swung an axe, missing Nat but connecting with one of his brethren. Nat caught a glimpse as the vampire fell over dead, leaving only five more attackers. This momentary lapse though allowed one of the vampires to connect with his weapon. <br />
<br />
Everyone paused as they gazed at Nat. The vampire had hit her with a club to the face. Camillia and the vamps raised an eyebrow in surprise, the blow was strong enough that it should have stunned Nat if not out right killed her. Instead, the dhamphir teen scowled, delivering a spinning kick that sent her attacker soaring into an adjacent wall. Spitting, Nat wiped her mouth, as Camillia smiled. They had drawn blood from the dhamphir.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see,&quot; Camillia grinned. &quot;She is human.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spurred forward by Camillia, the vampires looked to attack with renewed enthusiasm. Nat now lept into the air, flipping to the top of the foyers staircase. Grabbing a pair of daggers that adorned the wall, Nat prepare to fight anew and hoped her lessons with Akira on armed combat paid off.<br />
<br />
Once more, the vampires attacked. Armed with melee weapons, they tried to deliver a fatal blow to the teenage dhamphir. Nat though was ready, countering their attacks and landing blows of her own. The damage she was doing was minimal but it would add up over time. She just needed to be faster than they were.<br />
<br />
Flipping off of the overhang, Nat now drew her attackers towards her. The design of the foyer had an overhanging balcony lined with two marble staircases. As Nat advanced backwards up the stairwell, it forced her attackers to fight in front or from behind, limiting the area that she could be attacked. As one vampire charged forward with a sword and shield, the other lept behind her with a sword. Ducking, she avoided the sword strike, kicking the vampire off the staircase and focusing on a single attacker. <br />
<br />
Secure on the higher ground, Nat forced her opponent to lunge, blocking his attack and countering. She was waiting for the vampire to over extend, to make that one critical error she could capitalize on. Sure enough she was able to find that opening, delivering a kick to the vampires midsection. Knocking the vampire into the wall, Nat now used one of her daggers to pin his arm to the wall before useing the other to pierce his skull. The cybernetic vampires eyes now went lifeless as his corpse sat pinned to the wall. Unfortunately for Nat, she was now unarmed again, her four remaining attackers looking to swarm.<br />
<br />
Cartwheeling off the staircase, Nat now flipped to the second, her pursuers doing the same as the dhamphir removed a sword from the wall. Armed once more, Nat engaged her attackers in a sword duel, deflecting their blows and countering. Unfortunately she found herself surrounded with attackers on both sides. Flipping off the staircase to the overhang now gave the dhamphir more room to fight.<br />
<br />
Nats four remaining attackers now charged, two holding spears while the other two armed themselves with swords. Deflecting the spearmen was tricky, yet Nat managed before engaging the swordsmen. Despite the skill the swordsmen possessed, Akira&#39;s knowledge with weapons was better. Slashing one of the swordsman across the chest, Nat knocked him down the adjacent stairwell, leaving her with three opponents.<br />
<br />
While the swordsman was out of the battle for the moment, Nat could focus on the remaining three. As one of the spearmen ducked Nats attack, he tried to lunge. Nat though was ready, blocking his thrust before piercing him through the heart with her sword. With a mighty front kick, she now sent the vampire crashing through the railing of the overhang. Taking her fallen opponents spear, Nat followed with her opponents in hot pursuit.<br />
<br />
Landing, Nat braced herself, watching as three vampires now lept off the overhang. The vampire she had knocked down the stairwell had recovered, finding a massive spiked halbred. As that vampire attacked, he snapped Nats spear in two. Undaunted however, she improvised, useing the broken spear as a pair of makeshift Kali sticks.<br />
<br />
Kicking the vampire with the halbred away proved easy. The weapon was meant for a mounted rider, meaning her opponent was off balance as he wielded it. It now allowed Nat to focus on the remaining two. Deflecting the spear and sword proved easy for the dhamphir as she countered with quick and furious blows to her opponents. Nat could now sense their frustration, the vampires pressing their attack harder on the dhamphir.<br />
<br />
Their aggression proved to be fatal. Nat now used them to take eachother out. Deflecting the spearmans attack, Nat now pierced the heart of the remaining swordsman with a blow from his compatriot. As that vampire fell dead, she noticed the vampire with the halbred charge. Ducking his attack, she watched as a look of surprise crossed the other vampires face as his compatriot hit him in the head, obliterating it in the process.<br />
<br />
It was now one on one, Nat now focused on the vampire with the massive halbred. The weapon he choose was unbalanced, his attacks powerful but requiring too much recovery time. Useing her broken spear, Nat now disarmed the vampire, knocking him down with a front kick before grasping his weapon. As the vampire lay on the ground, Nat saw his eyes go wide in shock as she brought the massive spiked head down on his skull.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddammit Geshp why do you have to make this so hard,&quot; Camillia groaned. Pinching the bridge of her nose, the devil now wearily looked at Nat who now stood over the corpses of her cybernetic troops. Fighting this teenage girl was a non starter for Camillia. The Normal weren&#39;t paying her enough to possibly die. &quot;Mark my words child and mark them well,&quot; she growled. &quot;Enjoy your little victory today because the war is far from over.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a pillar of flame, Camillia now vanished, leaving Nat by herself. Breathing a sigh of relief, the dhamphir teen now turned to find the others. Hopefully they could get the Tepes family out without any further problems.</p>
