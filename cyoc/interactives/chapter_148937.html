<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As son as the kids went out to Luke’s house, Scott went to his wife and convinced her to merge her body with him once again.  Soon they were the conjoined parents again with Scott on the left and Sharon on the right, their body was set as the last time, with both of Sharon’s boobs and vagina along with Scott’s dick.<br />
They had some moment on the bed, kissing each other, playing with their body, Scott even got a chance to put his own dick into his new shared vagina. . For some reason Scott didn’t care about not having his balls it was good enough to be sharing a body with his wife. <br />
Later they took a shower still joined, and as they dried their body with a towel, Sharon said she had to do the chores of the house and then she had to work on some company paperwork, Scott volunteered to help her in their shared body, since he would only have to work if one of his patients have a complication at the hospital.  Sharon actually liked the idea that her husband would help her with all the cleaning, something she usually gets to do alone but her husband would know what it is like to have both jobs, a mother and an executive director of  a successful company.<br />
In spite of her enthusiasm of a day with her fiancé, Sharon was still uncomfortable with the idea of being naked around the house, even if Scott didn’t care about it, she couldn’t be moving around the house naked even less after knowing that her body would make their children uncomfortable.<br />
“Scott, we can’t be running around the house like this” she started<br />
“But what do you mean? You said that you wanted us to do all the chores like this” <br />
“Yes but I’m talking about the nudity, we can’t be running around naked, you saw how the kids reacted to my body and what if someone else arrive?”<br />
“You know that Ethan have seen us like this before”<br />
I’m not talking about Ethan”<br />
“Okay honey, if you want to put some clothes on, who am I to deny it? Besides it’s your body too” Scott turned his head and kissed his wife.<br />
“Thanks I knew you would understand”<br />
Then they walked over to Sharon’s dresser and she picked some of her underwear, but then stopped<br />
“oh I’m sorry, Scott, I think you would be more comfortable wearing some of your clothes” <br />
“me? Oh no Sharon, please, if those clothes are what makes you happy then wear them” said Scott<br />
A minute later Sharon-scott were on the bed sliding some of Sharon’s underwear throw their legs,  for Sharon was easy but Scott Had some troble moving his leg inside those tight panties, at the end the put it completely and stared at the mirror. It was tight and scotts dick made noticeable bulge on it. Then he had an idea and with his hand he put his dick inside Sharon’s vagina, it was still tight but their dick was less noticeable and they both felt pleasure to have it that way.<br />
Then they were trying to fasten a bra to cover their boobs, it was difficult for Scott since he never used one but within minutes they achieved to fasten it properly.<br />
As they looked into the mirror, Sharon smiled and told Scott that he looked sexy with her bra and panties.<br />
They went to chose their clothes asn Sharon suggested that they could wear some of Scott suits just to make it easier for him, but he then saw an old dress from Sharon, that he taugh she looked beautiful on it. A Sharon aproched to it, she asked if her husband if wouldn’t mind wearing that dress, for a seond scott just blushed and said:<br />
“if that the one that you want, I bet you will look beautiful with it”<br />
Then they put on the yellow dress thas was long enouth to cover their knees, showed a little bit of their boobs and they had to tear a bit of it since both of their heads could fit on it, but still the dress got in without looking torn apart.<br />
At the end the were looking at their body in the mirror<br />
“you look so cute on that dress” said Sharon<br />
“and you look so beautifull, when was the las time I saw you wear this?”<br />
“I think it might be like six years ago, but there is something missing,” said sahron as she walked to get some shoes.” Hope you don’t mind wearing them since we are already like this” she said picking up some high heels<br />
“oh what the hell, it would be fun”<br />
Then the dressed couple stepped out of the room rady for their day together, they weren’t walking perctly since scott had never used high heels.<br />
With that body, they sweep, mop cleaned the bathrrom, the children rooms, did the laundry and prepared the food<br />
When they finished, it was pass midday and Sharon wanted to know if the kids were coming to eat so Scott just called Max to confirm where they were and asked if he and his brothers were going home for lunch but they were eating at Ethan’s<br />
With set, the pair or individual, had their meal and soon they were both sitting in the desk at Scotts office, a room designed for his pass time and work. Sharon was checkin some numbers on some papers while scott was reading one of his books, it was the perfect day as conjoined parent.  Later Sharon received a call from her work, saiying that she will have to leave on a business trip for a couple of days.</p>
