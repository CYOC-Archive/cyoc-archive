<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Only 5 minutes after leaving Alice and Andrea, did I finally relax, now assured that they are not following me. &quot;What the fuck Alice&quot; I muttered to myself. &quot;That was way too stimulating.&quot; Mayyyybbbbeeeee I shouldn&#39;t speak to myself outloud. Huh that girl I swear. How could she have ever been a guy not 2 weeks ago? If I didnt see it for my self, I never would believe it. Although, I never got to see her dick now that I think about it... But I can trust that she wasn&#39;t lying to me. Aghhh what am I going to do about her? I love her so much, but is that real or just her charm? Why am I even thinking about this? Does it even matter? I am gonna eventually marry her and make sure that she is mine forever anyways. She is such a kind person too. Fuck she doesn&#39;t deserve me. Her I am thinking about claiming her too. What is wrong with me? Get it together Vivian! You can&#39;t be like this to her. Come on now, think about something else.<br />
<br />
Mmm oh! What will be needed to kill harpies? Yeah, lets go with that. Ok, harpies fly, so maybe a net or a bola. Although both of those are hard to throw as beginners... shit. Alright, I can shoot them down with my archery, but they will be so fast, and I can&#39;t hit all of them quickly, especially if they get too close or if there are a lot of them. Maybe Alice could possess them and we kill them as she grounds them 1 by 1? We would need to be careful not to kill her though. Actually I am sure she coukd just drain them easily enough. But then why am I even there? Forget it, I&#39;ll figure out this later. I am already at the first store.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to White Waters.&quot; Greeted the counter worker. &quot;Hey, if it isn&#39;t Vivian! I see you are no longer quite as piggish anymore. Can I take it as a successful mission?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sup Flik. And yep, witch dead, curse lifted. Should be back to my beautiful self in a few more days.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well congratulations then, although if I am being honest, you are seriously rocking the 6 tit look. Ever consider making it a permanent addition? I can give you a serious discount, how&#39;s 80% off work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Flik, but I... Wait 80%? Seriously? Damn I might actually have to consider that then. And its completely reversible right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t sell it if it wasn&#39;t. Ellie tested it on herself too just to be sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You seriously need to stop your wife from doing that. What if one day it isn&#39;t reversible?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, she never use to be a human shapped centaur. She was as human as you and me, well just me at least. I forgot you are part elf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait that is all because of a failed test? But she moves so naturally! Like she has had 4 legs from birth! She even can climb up ladders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, she is quite talented. And even enjoys her body. She always loved horses even before the accident. But enough about me and my marriage. What can I do you for? A little celebration gift to yourself for regaining your humanity? Or have you finally found that special someone to share a double ended dildo with, you horny little lesbian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if I said she was a succubus?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I would say oh hell no! If she is a succubus, then we are gonna need some major equipment. A double ended dildo will never be enough for a job that size. I&#39;m talking some serious shit, like bondage gear, transformatives, or maybe even an amputation kit, actually forget about that last one, I ain&#39;t ever selling one of those to you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those succubi can be some fucked up perverts sometimes. So you better be careful. I don&#39;t want to see you being walked into my store naked, collared, on a leash, with nothing but stumps for limbs, and a dog tail stuck up your ass by some succubus asking me to swap out your vocal cords for dog ones. Nuh-uh, not doing it. Me and Ellie think of you as if you were our daughter. And I am not turning my daughter into a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could fix me though right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If the cuts were clean, sure. It would be easy. But if they were hacked or ripped off by some amature, then its gonna be a painfully long time to regrow them. And I&#39;m serious about the pain too. But you ain&#39;t even getting that far in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax Flik, she is more of the submissive one anyways. She also is a bit different than other succubi too. And while I am at it, I never knew being the dominant one could be so tiring sometimes, you know?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That I do. But it also gets a little bit easier with experience too. Alright, how kinky is this succubus?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Earlier today I made a joke about how she is our party&#39;s pony since she flys while carring us around. I said how I should buy her a bridal with a mouth bit while shopping as a joke. And she leans over and tells me she would prefer a concealed ring gag over other the bits. In the middle of the Guild hall too. Sure she whispered it, but still, she even blew a guard earlier just to push a message through to the rest of the guard units as an example, so they won&#39;t bother us. She is extremely considerate of many things, but sometimes the obvious goes right over her head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that sounds like a succubus alright. Sex is always an answer for them. And if I had to venture a guess. Her blowing a guard once, to stop a lot of future harassments seems like an easy trade off. While it may sting innitially, unfortunately that comes with dating a succubus. They will attempt their very best to be considerate of you. But you gotta remember, that in order for them to live a normal, comfortable life, they need to regularly have sex, and often many times a day at that. And I hate to say it, but you just can&#39;t meet their requirements on your own. If you truly love this girl, you are ultimatly going to have to share her. Usually it&#39;s a 3 partners to 1 succubus ratio in order to keep her just satisfied enough, but most go 4 to 1 to be sure. So if you have 2-3 more friends, that you trust, you may want to consider that as an option. Maybe invite some of your old party to join? Or, find some new ones. But I have never heard of a monogamous succubus. They are a harem species after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I need to find even more people? Shit. Damn it Alice.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So her name is Alice? It&#39;s a pitty that I won&#39;t see her too often. Please bring her here, secretly if you must, before you head out next, I wish to speak with her at least once before she can take our #1 customer alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will do what I can. Now about why I am here today. Uh, any recommendations would be extremely helpful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flik was just about to answer when next to him, comming out of the back room, came a young women. She was on the smaller side when compared to her husband, reaching just about 5 foot 5 if she stood up and stretched slightly, compared to Fliks 6 foot 1, but because of her centaur-like body shape, she actually had more body mass, although she never would admit to it. Unlike how centaurs are half horse, Ellie has human features through and through. It almost was like someone cloned her and then shooved the clones head up her ass while moving the clone&#39;s arms and breasts over to the non-clone&#39;s body. The only inhuman thing was her udder which was nestled inbetween her back legs and her tail, which was the same blonde color hair as on her head and was tied into a neat ponytail with a big red bow. Her udder was similar to a horse&#39;s or goat&#39;s udder, in which it had 2 protruding breast-like mounds instead of just a large sack like a cow has. However it was mountainous when compaired to her somewhat flat chest. Even though she has 4 of them, the were at best passible if she were to claim that they were B-cups. But they were most definitely A-cups. This was why both Flik and I were taken aback when she came out in a loose hanging top with a wide collar that showed off an impossible amount of cleavage for someone who doesn&#39;t have any to begin with. <br />
<br />
&quot;Flik! Did I just hear- Vivian!&quot; Ellie cried out excitedly, as she leaped over the 3&quot; tall counter effortlessly and picked me up in a bear hug. &quot;Hey Ellie, you are still as freakishly strong as ever I see. Also since when were you stacked? Did you spill a transformation potion or something? How did your A-cups become D?&quot; Ellie dropped me on the ground. &quot;How rude, they were never A-cups to begin with, I was at least a B cup.&quot; Or so she says while extending a hand to help me up. &quot;No, this is another test product, which unfortunately isn&#39;t sellable at the moment due to a side effect. It is supposed to make your breasts grow, which it does wonderfully, but just not in the right way. Here listen to this.&quot; Ellie points her arms back behind herself and pushes out her chest, then starts to shake back and forth quickly. Her tits flop around like crazy, however there is a super obvious sloshing noise, and following it, 4 wet spots on her top. &quot;Ah shit, they pasties fell off again. As you can see, there is no breast tissue in them, just milk, and my nipples are dialated just enough from the pressure for the milk to trickle out if I dont cap them with something. I&#39;ve milked myself udder 3 times already today too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ellie, just take the damn reversal already, I am tired of having to mop up our floors.&quot; Grumbled Flik as he brought out an already recently used wet mop. <br />
<br />
&quot;Booo, no. I am keeping these babies until I stop lactating, or until I run out of shirts, which, actually this was my last clean one, damn it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t just strip naked in the middle of the store Ellie! Just take the damn potion now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay already, I will. I will. So stop nagging me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, ya crazy woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ellie just flipped him off with her left hand, while she was looking me over, ignoring her husband&#39;s complaints. This was their usual interactions with each other. Ellie was way to carefree, and Flik was doing his best to keep her all in 1 piece while making sure that she never went too far. Flik would only complaign constantly like that to someone who he really cared about. Anyone else he would warn them maybe twice but that was it. Only for Ellie would he keep bringing it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, you are still just a litgle a bit piggish I see, but your way cuter than before, now that your face is back to normal. Although a piggy Vivian would have also been cute, I prefer you like you normally are. So then, let me see what I can find for you so that you can tame your succubus. And don&#39;t worry Flik, I already have a few ideas in mind, so I am not gonna experiment much of at all for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Ellie, you&#39;re the best!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it, now, lets talk about how I can convince you to keep your 6 titties.&quot; Ellie said as she pulled me into the back room with her, all while leaving a trail of milk behind us.</p>
