<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heather hauled her purchases up the stairs to her room and locked that door behind her as well. She pulled the clothing from the bag and tossed it onto her bed in a pile then removed the box of diapers and set it next to them. Then she just stood there, staring at it. It was just a standard cardboard box. The label on the side of it depicted a diaper being modeled by a disembodied pair of hips under the words BIG TOTS (probably the brand name) and a lot of smaller print about sizing, quantity, and where it was manufactured. It looked like what Heather imagined a normal box of baby diapers might look. Except the the hips modeling the product were definitely those of an adult woman, and the sizing guide showed that they were far too big for any baby.<br />
<br />
Heather grabbed a pair of scissors from her desk and cut the tape. Her stomach was full of butterflys as she pulled out one of the white plastic wrapped bundles inside. It had a much simpler label on it than the box, just the words BIG TOTS and the size and quantity. With trembling fingers she pulled at the indicated spot and tiny perforations tore revealing the bag&#39;s contents. Heather gingerly pulled one out. Her skin seemed to tingle where it touched the plastic, like the pins-and-needles feeling you get when your foot falls asleep only lighter. She examined it carefully. It didn&#39;t look like the one on the box. The unknown model was wearing a pure white diaper but this one had a pink butterfly print on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a packaging error.&quot; Heather mumbled to herself. &quot;Probably why it ended up in a secondhand store. I don&#39;t think an adult would want to wear something so childish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;But you do.&#39; said a part of her thoughts that she had been trying to ignore.<br />
<br />
Heather couldn&#39;t deny that. She carefully placed the folded diaper onto her bed and, hesitating only slightly, began pulling off her sweats. Her shirt followed right after and she stood there in just her white panties. She had never liked the lacy lingerie that was always advertised to girls her age. Other girls at her school wore underwear that was cut to be as revealing as possible, she had seen plenty of that in the locker room during gym class. Heather&#39;s panties were made of thick cotton in the standard briefs cut. The meaner girls called them granny panties and asked Heather if she was going to knit herself a boyfriend one of these days. Heather pushed those thoughts out of her head as she pushed her underwear down her thighs.<br />
<br />
Now naked, she picked up the diaper and began unfolding it. It was bigger than it looked. Heather flipped it around in her hands, trying to puzzle out how something so large could be folded up so small. It even felt thicker. She pushed the box and clothing aside to make more space and lay the diaper out on her bed, then climbed up and sat down in the middle of it. The pins-and-needles feeling was getting stronger now, her fingers prickled with every movement. She could even feel it in her butt now where it touched the padding.<br />
<br />
&quot;This thing is huge.&quot; She whispered, a little awestruck.<br />
<br />
She looked over at the packaging, then at the diaper, then back at the packaging, then back at the diaper again. Could someone have packed the box with different diapers? It hadn&#39;t looked as if the box had ever been opened before. There were no tears and the single layer of tape had been pristine. Heather made a note to look up the company later. Maybe there was some kind of mistake at the factory at some point.<br />
<br />
She grasped the front of the diaper and leaned back, pulling it up between her legs and flattening it against her belly. The prickling in her hands was intense now, almost numbing, the longer she touched the plastic the worse it seemed to get. She wiggled her hips a bit to get it centered correctly. Though it still seemed much too large it wrapped around her waist and hips perfectly. She pulled off one of the lower tapes and fastened it securely to the plastic front. Then she did the same on the other side, making sure both tapes secured the diaper around her thighs as she did. Sucking in her gut a bit she pulled one of the top tapes and pressed it down firmly. Finally she grabbed the last tape and, holding her breath, attached it.<br />
<br />
Heather lay there for a few brief moments. With all the anticipation she had been feeling she had expected something... more? The diaper felt just like the one she had stolen earlier, just better fitting. The prickling, which had started to become a little annoying, faded away to nothing. Was that it? Just a diaper that fit her? Heather was more than a little disappointed. With a sigh she stood up.<br />
<br />
Immediately she was hit with the most intense feeling of vertigo she had ever felt in her life. She dropped to her hands and knees, breathing hard and swallowing to try and keep from vomiting. The room spun around her, colors seemed to blur and run in the corners of her vision. The diaper, which had felt thin and unobtrusive when she had first put it on, seemed to swell up. It pressed against her thighs, forcing them further apart. The padding rubbed up hard against her pubic bone and Heather felt a brief burning sensation that spread out both down her legs and up to her shoulders and down her arms. She wanted to collapse to the ground and pass out but some force locked her elbows and kept her mind clear.<br />
<br />
After what felt like an eternity the room seemed to settle again. Heather was able to lift her head and look blearily around her room.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t her room.<br />
<br />
No, it was her room, but it had never looked like this. The furniture was all where it belonged and even looked similar to how it had just been moments before, but there were significant changes. Pink seemed to be the primary color. It covered the walls and ceiling and seemed to have bled into the curtains covering her window and down into her carpet. Her bed had grown high rails, like a crib, and the comforter was now a bright pink instead of the faded gray it had been. Her dresser had lost a few feet in height and gained several more in length, a pink cushion now occupying the space that had once been covered in the usual detritus of any teen girl&#39;s room. Her desk had had to shrink to make space for her new dresser. It had bunched itself up into the shape of a large trunk with the word TOYS emblazoned across the front in more pink. Heather briefly wondered where her laptop and phone, which had been sitting on top of it, had gone to. They weren&#39;t the only things that had gone. The clothing she had tossed on the bed, along with the box of diapers, had disappeared. She looked at the spot on the floor where she had dropped the clothes she had been wearing. They had vanished too.<br />
<br />
Heather panicked. Her legs were still too shaky to to support her but she managed a stumbling crawl to her dresser. Drawer after drawer was wrenched open and slammed shut again. Her clothes were gone. In their place was clothing more like what she had bought at the thrift store. All bright colors and cartoon characters and styles that were popular among the very young. In one of the top drawers, where Heather had expected to find her underwear, were the diapers. They were lined up in neat rows and now that they were out of the packaging Heather could see several different designs printed on them. She slammed the drawer shut and slumped to the floor, the thick padding of the diaper cushioning her.<br />
<br />
She stared down at the diaper. Now it really did look larger. The padding had expanded outwards to the point that she couldn&#39;t close her legs no matter how badly she wanted too, causing her to sit with her legs curled off to the sides a little awkwardly. Her legs looked weird. Heather hadn&#39;t bothered to shave the last couple of days and while she didn&#39;t have much hair on her legs it was usually noticeable. Now they were bare and soft, not like they had been freshly shaved, but like they had never grown hair at all. Fear and panic growing she lifted her arms. The small patches of hair that once adorned her armpits were gone too, along with the fine hairs on her forearms. She frantically tugged at the diaper, not even thinking to try the tapes. She had secured it far too well. She shoved her hand under the waistband and wiggled her hand deep into the diaper&#39;s thick padding. Her searching fingers met nothing but smooth, soft skin all the way down and around. Not even a hint of the usual stubble.<br />
<br />
She yanked her hand free of the diaper. She was beginning to hyperventilate now. Her eyes tore frantically around the room looking for something, anything, that showed this to be the room of a teenager and not an oversized infant.<br />
<br />
As she was about to lose out to despair she saw something under the oversize crib.</p>
