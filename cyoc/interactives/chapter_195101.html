<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite fears that they would end up in diapers by Sunday, the two were pleasantly surprised to find themselves still 20 by Sunday morning. The two women had to alter their plans slightly, instead of going to a fancy restaurant they went to a movie instead. As Julia now awoke, she stretched before making her way towards the bedroom mirror.<br />
<br />
Dressed in a baggy t-shirt and sleep pants,, Julia looked every bit the college coed. A beautiful unlined face, perky D cup breasts, killer curves and long luxurious blonde hair brought a smile to Julia&#39;s face. As Julia now made her way into Gwen&#39;s kitchen she could see her girlfriend putting dishes away. &quot;Hiw you feeling Gwen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen turned, her young face beaming. &quot;Fantastic,&quot; Gwen smiled. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I feel this good. Usually after drinking wine I have a wicked hangover.&quot; Julia simply chuckled as Gwen went about her business. Although Gwen was speaking, Julia wasn&#39;t paying attention to what she was saying, instead admiring Gwen body.<br />
<br />
Like Julia, Gwen was sporting a baggy tshirt and sleep pants, pants that the leabian woman had to continually adjust as they slipped off her hips. Julia couldn&#39;t help but smirk as she gazed at Gwen, she may not have had Julia&#39;s curves put she was certainly quite attractive.<br />
<br />
As she watched Gwen once more hitch her sleep pants up, a fiendish idea began to form. The employee she had talked to said the reversal dice would be delivered by Tuesday. While she and Gwen were able to take a week off from work, it meant they wouldn&#39;t be stuck at a younger age for much longer. Gazing at the 20 year old, a mischievous feeling began to stir. <br />
<br />
Julia had wanted to shrink Gwen this weekend, instead the two had ended up at 20, not what she intended. Now watching Gwen adjust her pants she realized she could shrink Gwen in other ways. Julia thought about only making her friends shrink a size, so she will have the upper hand over the smaller Gwen.<br />
<br />
Carefully Julia now made her way to where the dice were. Gwen, was still oblivious to that as she now gently picked it up. As she gazed at it, she wondered what age to make her. Like a shot in the night it hit her. Now looking at the dice Julia purposely looked for the number before rolling the dice onto that side.<br />
<br />
20 years you have walked this Earth. Now this number is but 17. Each roll returns more of what you have lost.<br />
<br />
Julia was already looking forward to seeing her friend&#39;s reaction. Turning towards the shriek, Julia couldn&#39;t help but smirk as Gwen&#39;s predicament.<br />
<br />
Gwen had returned to her teen years, the freshmen 15 from college having been wiped away. As Gwen returned to high school her hips and waist had thinned, causing her sleep pants to cascade down to her ankles. Julia couldn&#39;t help but smile wickedly as she gazed at Gwens saggy underwear that now exposed the top portion of Gwen&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
Gwen blushed fiercely as she listened to Julia&#39;s wolf whistle. What the hell was she thinking? Spinning on her heel she now glared at the teenage beauty but still that of a student that was eyeballing her. &quot;What the hell are you thinking,&quot; she yelled.<br />
<br />
Julia couldn&#39;t help but grin as she studied a now 18 year old Gwen. She couldn&#39;t believe how skinny she was. Boyish hips with barely B cup breasts, and a round face with only the barest hint of maturity. She recognized the girl from her memories, the girl who had been one of her closest friends when they had been 18 year old high school seniors. &quot;What,&quot; Julia grinned. &quot;I told you I wanted to see you shrink out of your clothes, guess I get my wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen could only glare at Julia, studying her friend angrily. It appeared Julia used only her dice. While she had became a high schooler, Julia was still an adult, making her à teenager again was unacceptable but she could at least made her the same age.&quot;How could you make me even younger,&quot; Gwen frowned. &quot;I m only 17 now !&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it did get you to turn five different shades of red,&quot; Julia grinned. &quot;By the way? Did anyone ever tell you how cute your butt is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not helping,&quot; Gwen grumbled, pulling her shirt lower.<br />
<br />
Julia chuckled. Gwen noticed on her last sentence that her voice sounded an octave or two higher. She was just a girl now, barely adult with raging teenage hormones. &quot;Julia this is serious,&quot; Gwen stated. &quot;Look at me! I look ready for prom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda what I was going for,&quot; Julia stated, causing Gwen to gape. &quot;Look Gwen its no secret, you had a massive crush on me when we were seniors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you are not a seniors and me neither by the way&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That’s true, but see Gwen I wanted to allow you to live out your teenage fantasy with me but In return I am the older one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen was momentarily confused before gasping as she watched Julia shuck off her baggy shirt. Gwen now couldn&#39;t help but gape at Julia&#39;s massive C cup breasts confined inside a bra that was perhaps a size too big. Julia now began to pose, vampire for Gwen before undoing the string on her sleep pants and letting them fall to the floor. &quot;these panties are a bit baggy,&quot; she giggled.<br />
<br />
Julia fiddled with her baggy underwear before turning to Gwen. Much to her delight, Gwen was in shock as she gazed at Julia&#39;s body, the one she crushed on but on a more mature form. &quot;Oh Gweny,&quot; Julia called in a sing song voice. &quot;My back hurts SOOOOO MUCH! Can you give me one of your famous back rubs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen shook herself out of her stupor as Julia now layer down oh her couch. &quot;You can&#39;t be serious, I know that you are playing with the fact that I am younger and more innocent than you&quot; she said In an accusatory tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please little Gweny,&quot; Julia asked, her voice almost whiny. &quot;Your the only one that makes it feel better.&quot; Gwen simply shook her head, chuckling softly as she now straddled her girlfriend and began to give her a backup. Julia of course moaning in relief/ecstacy as she seemed to tease her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you would go this far just to get a back rub,&quot; Gwen chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your have magic fingers Gwen,&quot; Julia sighed. &quot;Besides, know you must have fantasized about this all the time growing up. How many girlfriends can grant their girlfriend&#39;s wishes. Now keep massaging.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen smirked, reaching her hand up before pulling her bra and snapping it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow,&quot; Julia exclaimed. &quot;That hurt you brat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Takes one to know one,&quot; Gwen countered with a smirk. Julia now chuckled, sighing contentedly as Gwen continued with her massage.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don’t appreciate what you are doing Julia,,&quot; Gwen stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;You’r making me feel very uncomfortable right now, if only you were younger it wouldn’t be so embarrassing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you want to be in equal ages ? Don’t you like being under my protection&quot; Julia chuckled.<br />
<br />
<br />
But seriously you need to be careful. If thise dice roll again I could be in sa erious trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You worry too much Gwen,&quot; Julia said. &quot;The dice will be here in a couple of days. For now, let&#39;s just enjoy ourselves for awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Gwenn massaged Julia&#39;s body, she felt bad how much more shapely her curves were than his, and it was true, she was a high school girl massaging a college girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah keep massaging in that corner there,<br />
&quot;Thanks you so much my little Gweny&quot;.</p>
