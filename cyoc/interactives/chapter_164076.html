<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> Von Crucial stopped his soft chanting and smiling he commanded the two to turn and face each other.  <br />
<br />
“like I said,  I think for either of you this as lucky as you can get.” He said and started laughing louder  <br />
<br />
Cindy felt whatever invisible bonds loosen somewhat as she looked at her  husband.  She was horrified to see that his face had been altered.  His  nose and eyes had been shifted up on his face slightly and there was  now what looked like an anus just below his nose.  Equally as impossible  there was now a vagina, with its plump outer lips pulsing in and out as  John appeared to struggle to breath.  Below the vagina was blonde pubic  hair on his chin, neatly trimmed into an inverted V, and if it were not  for the altered anatomy on his face it would appear to be a regular  goatee.  Cindy tried to scream as she looked closer to the area just  under his chin at what looked to be a tattoo on the pale, smooth skin  just below where the pubic hair ended just above his Adam’s apple.  She  looked again, and again she was shocked to recognize the quarter dollar  sized tattoo, it was of a red heart and it had Cindy Lou written below  it.   She screamed a garbled scream as she realized  it was her vagina,  right down to the blonde pubic hair and tattoo she got when she was 16  on her boyfriends face.  She screamed again when she also realized that  if it was her vagina it was also probable that her anus was also on his  face.  <br />
<br />
She tried to find words to protest but in doing so, she found it was  hard to talk.  It was as if her tongue was swollen and it was hard to  control.  She opened her mouth to speak and was again horrified to feel  what protruded out from her lips as she closed her mouth around what  should have been her tongue.  She quickly pulled it back into her mouth  and as it slid in between her lips she noticed how it felt as it did so.   It was almost as if the tip was swollen, but it was also very  sensitive a feeling that was somehow familiar but defiantly foreign.  <br />
<br />
John was watching this all in horror, he could see Cindy was reacting to  something, something that was upsetting her immensely.   He too felt  the invisible bonds release a little and the numbness slowly dissipated  from his face.  The feeling wasn’t right though, the way the air felt on  his face just didn’t feel right.  For one thing, breathing in and out  of his mouth was sending strange sensations through his face as air  escaped through his lips which felt swollen.  Exploring his mouth with  his tongue he realized whatever this guy did to him he took his teeth  for one thing.  His tongue poked around his toothless cavity, it was all  soft, no palate no gums, just soft warm skin and very strange  sensations, almost pleasant…almost like….  <br />
<br />
He looked at Cindy and he felt his knees go weak as she opened her mouth  and out came a penis, with it’s round bulbous head from between her red  lipstick colored lips.    <br />
<br />
“Go ahead” Von Crucial said reach for it  <br />
<br />
John didn’t know how but he instinctively reached for his crotch, only  find smooth skin where his penis should have been.  Below that, he was  somewhat relieved to feel his familiar hairy ball sack, but it was a  bitter sweet relief.  <br />
<br />
“What did you do?” he said, or tried to say.  “Ungahha hghha hahh ha” is what Von Crucial and Cindy heard.  <br />
<br />
John reached up to his throat. “ Uhgnna “ he again tried to speak.  His  hand slid up his throat and he stopped when he came to the patch of  pubic hair making up his “goatee”.  It had been years since he had had  any facial hair, but even then it had felt different than what was  currently on his face.  Where his beard had been course, this was  lighter feeling, almost whispy in nature, even the skin on his face  through the hair felt softer to the touch.  His hand slid up and over  his chin, making contact with the plump outer lips of Cindy’s vagina.   His jerked his hand away in shock.  He made eye contact with Cindy, her  eyes were almost full of tears.  He slowly put his hand back to his  mouth, or atleast to where his mouth should have been.  No wonder his  tongue was sending back mixed signals.   He had a God Damn vagina for a  mouth now.  It’s vertical slit taking up the lower part of his face.  He  felt around, he felt the outer lips and how if he tried real hard he  could use his facial muscles to open it slightly, just enough to get his  tongue out.  Keeping his hand over it, he let his tongue explore the  alien lips.  He pulled his tongue back into his “mouth” and marveled at  the strange sensations as he felt it slide across both the plump outer  lips and the thinner but more sensitive second set that resided just  inside of his new mouth.   He looked at Cindy and she was looking at  him.  He tried to ignore the strange sensations emitting from his new  mouth as he slowly slid his hand further uphis face.  He felt the at the  top of the vagina as the vaginal lips gave way to smooth skin, and was  shocked again when his finger slid over another opening, this time it  was small and tight and round and as he gently poked it with a finger  tip, the sensation that was returned confirmed to him that he not only  had a vagina on his face, he also had an anus just below his nose.  A  subtle sniff of his finger confirmed what his mind was still unable to  comprehend.  The musky mix of female scent and butthole was the last  thing he remembered as he slipped into unconsciousness.  <br />
<br />
The tape caught the rest.  On it we could see Von Crucial use his magic  beam to shrink John and his assistant then appeared to take him away.   He motioned to Cindy and she became rigid and her body began to shimmer.   Slowly she shrank, smaller and smaller until she was about 6 inches  tall.  He then placed a small disk on her head and then like some kind  of special effects her mouth opened and kept of opening.  Wider and  wider her mouth opened until the penis that was her tongue stuck out,  almost erect.  Her body molded itself into a formless cylinder and her  teeth dissolved into nothing.  After a few moments where the former  Cindy stood, now was an 6 inch penis.  Von Crucial bent down and placed a  card underneath it, almost as if it was a paperweight and then he  looked at the surveillance camera that had been recording the events and  smiled.  Suddenly a bright light caused the film to become over exposed  and the recording stopped.  <br />
<br />
Agent Smith was the first on the scene and after nobody answered the  door and with both vehicles in the driveway he became suspicious and  forced his way in and called for backup.  Nothing was out of the  ordinary that is except for the groceries on the kitchen floor that is.  <br />
<br />
Detective James arrived as soon as he could.  The two witnesses were nowhere to be found.  <br />
<br />
“Let’s check the tape” he said, maybe there is something on there to go  on.  Agent Smith went into the laundry room to playback the day’s  recording while Detective James looked closely at the fallen groceries.   There among the paper towels was something out of the ordinary.   Putting on his latex gloves he carefully moved one of the rolls and  stepped back.  There on the floor was what at first glance looked to be a  sex toy, a dildo.  What caused him to step back was that it moved.   Using a pair of salad tongs, he carefully picked it up, to his shock it  moved again, and fell to the floor making soft slap against the hardwood  floor.  This time, using the tongs and a dustpan, he carefully picked  it up again and laid it on the kitchen counter.  Looking closely, it  moved, almost as if it were breathing??? Rolling it over, he could see  what looked like two very small holes on the underside of the “head” of  the penis and below those, what could almost be a mouth.  In fact it was  mouth with lips and everything.  Rolling it over again, he stepped  back, were those eyes?  Looking again in shock, he could see two blue  human looking eyes staring up at him from just behind the head of the  penis.    <br />
<br />
“Can you hear me?” he said  <br />
<br />
No answer.  <br />
<br />
“Blink if you understand”  <br />
<br />
The eyes blinked frantically darting back and forth.  <br />
<br />
“Detective, you need to see this it’s unbelievable” agent Smith said coming into the kitchen.  <br />
<br />
“Try me” Detective James said</p>
