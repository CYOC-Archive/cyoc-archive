<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We all went into the kitchen and helped ourselves to whatever food we wanted.  About 10 minutes later I looked around the room and didn’t see Scott or Joyce.  While the other three chatted, I snuck out of the room and crept into the hallway.  I walked quietly in the direction of the bathroom.  The door was closed.  I pressed my ear to the door as best I could and heard a few soft moans coming from the other side.  I smiled and turned back to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Where’d you go?” asked Pam when she saw me return.<br />
<br />
I said, “Oh, I was just, uh…”<br />
<br />
“Jeez, Joe, let them do what they want,” scolded Carl.<br />
<br />
Rachel said, “It’s not like we didn’t see them sneak out first or anything.”<br />
<br />
“Who’s sneaking out?” a voice asked.  We turned around to see Scott walk back into the kitchen.  “Somebody leaving?”<br />
<br />
“No, not that at all,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Good, because you promised a lot of fun,” he said.<br />
<br />
A couple of minutes later Joyce walked back into the room.  I noticed a few things different about her.  “You took off your pantyhose,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Yea,” she said.  “I don’t know, they were just bothering me.  So I threw them on that pile.  That’s the game right, just throw the clothes on the pile?”<br />
<br />
“For now,” answered Rachel.  “Joyce, you look a little different.”<br />
<br />
“How so?” Joyce asked.<br />
<br />
“Now don’t get mad at me, but I’d say you look younger,” said Rachel.  “Your face looks smoother than it did.”<br />
<br />
Joyce said, “Really?”  She felt around her face and cheeks.  She went over them several times to be sure.  “I think you’re right.”<br />
<br />
“They did say that people would become their ‘prime age,’ or something, right?” asked Pam.  “Maybe you’re losing a few years.”<br />
<br />
“I’d be fine with that,” admitted Joyce.  “How about you three, what’s different so far?”<br />
<br />
“We all seem to have smaller feet now,” I said.  “I can feel my hair getting longer.”<br />
<br />
“Same here,” said Scott.  “I’ve also noticed…uh…” He stopped and looked at Joyce.  “I’m pretty sure my dick is smaller.”<br />
<br />
“He still used it pretty well,” said Joyce in a matter-of-face tone.  Scott looked surprised at her for her statement.  “They all know what we did,” she said.<br />
<br />
I tried to make Scott feel normal.  “I noticed that a few hours ago,” I said.  “I’m sure it’s smaller now.”<br />
<br />
Everyone turned to look at Carl, who was at first oblivious to the attention.  Once he gathered that we had focused on him, he said, “I haven’t checked.  But if it’s happening to Joe and Scott, I’m sure it’s happening to me.”<br />
<br />
“What about your weight?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yea, where’s my scale?” he asked.  I pointed it out to him and he quickly stepped on it.  “Down to 235,” he said.  “Do you think it’s that whole ‘prime age’ or ‘prime condition’ thing that’s making all this weight go away?”<br />
<br />
“I would hope so,” said Rachel.  “This way you get a fresh start at being healthy.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” Carl said.  “I hope I can actually stay that way.  If I’m going to be thin, that is.”<br />
<br />
“Just don’t eat like a pig,” said Pam.<br />
<br />
Carl glared at her.  “You’ve never known someone with a weight problem, have you?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Sure I have,” Pam replied.  “And they all had one thing in common.  They ate too much.”  Carl just shook his head and Pam didn’t say anything else.<br />
<br />
The effects of the wishes resumed as I saw Rachel tug at her shirt.  “That’ll be enough of this,” she said as she worked at the buttons.  She struggled with the first ones so she said with frustration, “Oh, the hell with this.”  She grabbed the top of the shirt and ripped it completely apart.  Buttons flew in either direction as she tore the shirt from her body.  Her bra-clad breasts jiggled back and forth as she pulled the shirt away.  “Something else for the pile,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Yea, same here,” said Pam, who hurriedly removed her shoes.  The two of them walked out into the living room and deposited what they had discarded.<br />
<br />
When they re-entered the kitchen, Carl asked, “So how much clothing will be left by the end of the night, I wonder.”  Again we all laughed.<br />
<br />
A little while later we decided to go back to the living room.  But we made sure to bring the liquor with us.  We sat around the coffee table and began to throw back shots.  Now that everyone was beginning to loosen up, the conversations became more adult in nature.  Sex stories flew left and right, with Carl being quite eager to share his.  I learned some more about Rachel’s sexual history, but none of it bothered me.  She shared a few stories of time she had with other girls.  I listened intently to these tales, as I mentally took notes for any ideas I might be able to use once the change finished.<br />
<br />
Finally I had to ask, “So have you and Joyce ever done it?”<br />
<br />
Everyone stopped dead.  Scott looked shocked. Carl looked amused.  Pam seemed eager to hear the answer, which I could tell she hoped would be, “Yes.”  Rachel looked surprised that I asked the question.  Joyce didn’t look surprised in the least.  She looked at Rachel and said, “Your choice, sweetie.”<br />
<br />
Rachel looked back at me.  It looked like she was going to cry.  Suddenly she burst into laughter.  “Oh, sorry to pull your chain, Joe,” she said.  Then she turned dead serious again.  “But, yes, we have.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa!” Pam, Scott and Carl all exclaimed in unison.<br />
<br />
“Oh, come on, details,” I said.<br />
<br />
Rachel laughed again.  “Sure,” she said.  “This is a good story.  So it’s about five years ago.  I go for my first modeling job.  I don’t know what the hell I’m doing.  The photographer starts to lose patience with me.  So he calls over this other model and tells her to show me how to do it right.  And she’s basically forcing me into all of the poses.  But while she’s doing it I notice that she keeps running her hands over my ass.  But I was worried about losing the job, so I just let her do what she wanted.  It worked because the photographer was pretty happy when we finished.”  She stopped and took a quick drink.  “I go back to the dressing room and find the model that helped me.  I said to her, ‘I appreciate the help but why did you keep touching my ass?’  She looks at me and says, ‘Because mine used to look like that and I got jealous.’”<br />
<br />
Joyce interrupted and said, “Oh that is not what I said at all!  What I said was, ‘Because I’m jealous mine doesn’t feel like that anymore.’  Big difference.”<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you pick it up from here?” said Rachel.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” said Joyce.  “We introduced ourselves formally.  She starts picking my brain right away, wanting to know anything and everything that she can use to get ahead.  I invited her out with me that night.  We went to dinner, and then we went out to a club and there was just this…connection.  So we ended up back at my place and…well, in the morning she was still there.”  Joyce took a drink.  I expected her to say more, but she did not.<br />
<br />
“And?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry, Joe,” she said.  “Not everything is fodder for conversation.”<br />
<br />
“What?” I asked again.  I turned to Rachel.<br />
<br />
She just shrugged her shoulders and said, “She’s right.  Some things are private.  Maybe some day I’ll break down and tell you, but not now.”<br />
<br />
I threw up my hands.  “Oh, what a tease,” I said.  “Can you at least tell me if that was it or…”<br />
<br />
“No, just that one time,” Joyce cut me off.  “We realized it was just something that happened.  We could never have a relationship in that world.  For one thing, there are no secrets in the modeling world.  They’d get rid of us so fast.  I could have handled that, but I wasn’t going to let Rachel lose her chance at success.”  Joyce took another drink.  A sad look crossed her face.  “The modeling world chews you up and spits you out.  It’s just about through with me.”<br />
<br />
That comment brought a silence upon the room.  I quickly glanced around the room.  Scott stared at his feet.  Carl looked ahead at nothing.  Pam looked confused.  I looked to Rachel and saw that she was looking at me.  I tried to throw her a look so that she would say something.  <br />
<br />
Luckily she caught my intent.  “Well who knows now?” Rachel said.  “Maybe things will be different for you.”<br />
<br />
“For all of us,” said Pam.  “I mean…what’s life going to be like after this?  What’s going to change about all the things we’re so used to and just accept?  Will we still have the same jobs?  I mean, will you even still be a model?”<br />
<br />
Rachel looked at me again.  “I don’t know,” she said.  “We’ll just have to find out.”</p>
