<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Okay, first thing’s first,” Vicky said as she continued to stroke the snarling pug in front of her, “let’s get this little madame into a more… advantageous position, shall we?”<br />
<br />
As Vicky said this she motioned to a piece of equipment in the corner of the room. It essentially consisted of a large wooden board, upon which stood two steel hoops on the end of a couple of adjustable poles. Worryingly, you thought you already had a fairly good idea what this would be used for as Vicky lifted the apparatus up onto the nearby table.<br />
<br />
Clearly, Jemma and Fiona also had an idea of what was in store as they made their objections known. However, the most passionate reaction by far came from Rianna as she started to yap and snarl loudly.<br />
<br />
Sadly though, Vicky only laughed at these reactions as she started adjusting the equipment in front of her. She seemed to know what she was doing as she collapsed the two poles and moved them closer together. Then, she opened the two hoopes and made sure the locking mechanisms worked. It was now painfully obvious what this device was for and, more importantly, who would soon be using it…<br />
<br />
Right on cue, Vicky’s hand darted down and grabbed the angry pug by the base of her neck. Vicky laughed as she held the dog up for all to see, even as she continued to yap and snarl in her hands.<br />
<br />
“What a feisty little bitch you are,” Vicky said as she looked the pug in her eyes, “so much aggression and anger, even without that old human cock of yours.” This taunt made the dog seethe with rage as she swiped out with her claws. However, Vicky simply chuckled at this reaction as she slowly moved her free hand over towards the pug’s exposed underside.<br />
<br />
Rianna then yapped out in surprise as Vicky’s fingers started to gently stroke over her furry belly. Vicky’s touches were deliberately slow and sensual as she investigated the mounds of the dog’s teats and rolled the soft flesh around in her hand. These intimate touches were clearly having an effect as the dog’s snarls and barks became quieter and less frequent. Instead, the dog soon seemed to be focused on keeping her composure, as a very obvious hint of pleasure started to creep across her face.<br />
<br />
After noticing this change of stance, Vicky decided to press onward by targeting the dog’s sensitive nipples. Rianna gave a breathless yip of surprise when Vicky suddenly flicked her finger over one of the sensitive nubs on her chest. Vicky did this a few times before she took things to the next level. Soon, she was roughly pinching and tugging on the nipple between her fingers as she tried to coax out even more of a reaction from the startled canine.<br />
<br />
This tactic quickly proved effective as Vicky spent the next few minutes moving around Rianna’s chest, where she would alternate between softly rubbing and caressing a teat, and then twisting and pinching hard on the nipple connected to it. And throughout this, Rianna’s resistance steadily faded into nothing as the pleasurable sensations simply became too much for her. As a result, the pug was soon left rolling around with her tongue lolling out as she panted and moaned in need.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm, now I think we’re seeing your true colours,” Vicky said as she flicked one of Rihanna’s bottom two nipples, “but I think there is one part of your body that we must not forget about.”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky’s fingers slid off Rianna’s teat and made their way further between her furry legs. Vicky also made sure you had a good view as she held the dog up for you. You immediately grimaced in disgust as you watched Vicky’s hand slowly slide further down until it made contact with what could only be the bitch’s plump, spade-shaped vagina.<br />
<br />
Rianna howled out in surprise as Vicky’s fingers traced lightly around the swollen folds surrounding her vagina’s entrance. Though it was only a slight contact, the sensations seemed to make the pug lose all control as she started to tremble in Vicky’s grip. However, this only seemed to encourage Vicky as she placed a finger between the dog’s pussy lips and began to slowly rub it up and down over the tight slit that lay between them.<br />
<br />
“Ooooo, you like that don’t you girl?” Vicky said as she continued to twiddle her finger over the dog’s sex, “already so horny and eager to have your pussy filled.” Rianna was unable to argue as she continued to moan and writhe around pathetically under Vicky’s ministrations. Clearly, the pug was in heat, which explained why her vagina looked so fat and swollen. It also explained why she was enjoying herself so much as you briefly remembered just how your own equine heat had made you behave not so long ago.<br />
<br />
You continued to dwell on this until the sound of Vicky’s voice snapped you back to reality. “Yes, I think that will do,” she said as she abruptly pulled her finger away from Rianna’s now-glistening spade, “you are now in a much better frame of mind than you were a minute ago. Now I think you are looking forward to having somebody tending to that bitch’s cunt of yours, aren’t you?”<br />
<br />
Rianna didn’t disagree as she remained limp in Vicky’s arms. She therefore offered no resistance as she was brought over to the strange equipment that was positioned nearby. Vicky then let out a slight giggle as she held the pug on her back and locked the two rings around her neck and lower abdomen. Then, after checking that everything was secure, Vicky stepped back; leaving Rianna trapped in what was obviously a canine breeding stand!<br />
<br />
“Right then,” Vicky said excitedly, “now that our bitch is in position, I think we can continue to today’s special therapy session. I just can’t wait to get started!”    <br />
<br />
As Vicky said this the snake and cockroach exchanged a worried look. Meanwhile, you could only stare at the restrained pug in fear, now dreading what else Vicky had up her sleeve…</p>
