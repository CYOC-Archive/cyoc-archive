<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It would be a lie to say after Project Return, there had not be a massive increase in public <br />
incidents regarding mythicals, emphasis on 'public.' This from a quick glance and a few <br />
seconds of thought of course lead to the reasonable conclusion that apparently having the <br />
truth of mythicals made public had emboldened said figures of myth to enact in ways that <br />
violated both mundane and mythical laws. <br />
<br />
In reality people often failed to appreciate just how many resources had been dumped into <br />
pulling the wool over their eyes, from the blacking out of new paper articles to <br />
programmed filters of digital information disguised as part of the operating system (once <br />
the facts of the veil worked their way into the public school system this misconception <br />
would be greatly reduced). The incidents in recent years -had- become more numerous as <br />
such criminals realized how much of the kingdom of illusions had become internalized <br />
and for example infect a person with a were curse sublimely and the victim would never <br />
realize the warning signs or seek treatment in the early stages. <br />
<br />
With the truth now in the public mind, many scrambled to readjust their strategies, while <br />
other criminals and monsters chose to continue to continue their current style of operation <br />
without adjustment in defiance of the revaluation of truth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Boring rules! Boring! Kittie-chans come easy before! Kittie-chans come easyu now!&quot; Sara-<br />
Neko, 'Cat Princess' was one such person who defied this call for adjustment. <br />
<br />
Once upon a time she had been just another overweight, lonely, over-opinionated otaku <br />
with a furry fettish. Then came the bits and pieces of spells he had cobbled together from <br />
the internet, out-dated books and the tinniest bit of natural talent not that he had a clue <br />
what it was a natural talent for. Trying to bring the picture of a stereo typical cat girl he <br />
had commissioned to life, he had failed to take into account that you couldn't create a <br />
sentient being out of thin air with such crude methods (the soul had to come from <br />
somewhere), and the spell had taken the most immediate source of raw material available, <br />
him. <br />
<br />
'Where am I? I not know! I'm a pretty kitty! There should be more pretty kitties in the <br />
world!' Had been her first thoughts. Sadly, she retained enough wits to reproduce the spell <br />
that had spawned her, and had gone about what she had considered a service to the world. <br />
Sometimes she would lure someone out of the way and added them to japan's growing cat <br />
girl population, or leave 'surprises' in spots less traveled by, but often she would just <br />
chose a public location late by night and simply 'upgrade' any humanoid, child, elderly, <br />
man or woman she laid eyes.  still being able to learn in her own right, she eventually <br />
found buyers for her spawn who were more than happy to 'help' their princess in any way <br />
they could so she could pay her grocery and utility bills (even if she had thought of it, her <br />
spawn would find themselves hard pressed to remember their own credit card numbers). <br />
She became a large cog in the hetai industry...<br />
<br />
She had also begun to realize there would 'bakas' who would not the world to have more <br />
pretty kitties and had begun to time her frolics so to collect her prizes then flee... she <br />
never realized that a large part of her window was from the setting up of farces and <br />
blackouts magical and mundane to keep people from noticing her or the 'bakas'... (doing <br />
it afterwards had been deemed too risky after she had started to become too big a rumor <br />
on the net from eye witnesses) .... <br />
<br />
Thus, she was thoroughly confused when the bakas (magical girls aka 'modern day mikos' <br />
and magical boys aka 'mage knights') showed up ten minutes early, had her disarmed and <br />
on the ground, and the local magic uses examining her to how they might restore her to <br />
sanity along with her victims.... <br />
<br />
This incident in japan was just one example of such happenings, and the world was a <br />
brighter place for it. Sara-Niko wasn't the only victim of magic to live in her own world, <br />
but someone's world was about to come crashing down around her ears. <br />
<br />
Kathy skipped into King Tommy's throne room, by her king's decree she had started <br />
wearing much more conservative attire opposed to her original 'queenly' outside that only <br />
hid enough to make you want more when she didn't just strut around in the fur. <br />
<br />
It was a puzzle how much Kathy was aware of her own origins and past, sometimes she <br />
talked about how she was 'glades things were different from how they had been' but the <br />
same time blinking in confusion at the name 'Karther.'  Karther's memories were the <br />
memories of a stranger to her, and completely alien to her, there was nothing of Karther <br />
inside her for these memories to call out to.  Her brain assimilated what memories of <br />
Karther she could that she could hammer into her own existence, passing off what she <br />
couldn't as bad dreams. <br />
<br />
&quot;My king.&quot; She had asked the day after her king has renamed himself, &quot;Why didn't you <br />
make love to me last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her King Tommy had tripped over herself verbally at her out of the blue question at <br />
breakfast and had explained that he had much to do still in the restoration of their society <br />
and city and didn't have time. Kathy accepted this answer, and became determined there <br />
after to get her king to relief his stress with her no matter what! It was taking time, but <br />
she was wearing down his defenses. She knew she was interfering with her king's work, <br />
but she wasn't about to let him shut himself off from her because of some sense of <br />
obligation! <br />
<br />
So had asked Alexandra why their king had grown so reluctant and uncomfortable around <br />
her, but Alexandra had tip toed around the subject, merely telling her that the king was <br />
simply recovering from his sickness and needed time. Well! Kathy knew just the cure he <br />
needed then! <br />
<br />
Kathy knew the game and knew how to play it well, and Alexandra provided what <br />
assistance she could. Kathy knew where all men were vulnerable and played upon those <br />
weaknesses with a smirk on her face. Tommy was her king,  but he was also still a sage <br />
fennec, and Kathy was perfectly able to wrap him around her little finger ever so slowly.  <br />
After all, it was her duty, honor, and pleasure to make sure the burden of being the king <br />
of all fennec kitsune didn't crush her beloved ruler.  She was impressed and awe inspired <br />
of course at how her king was quickly making allies and peaceful relations with <br />
surrounding kingdoms, but she feared of course the stress getting to him. <br />
<br />
'I wonder if his Majesty would make him his queen?' Kathy wondered, 'I know I am but his <br />
release and nothing more, and I do not envy nor desire his burden of leadership, but it is <br />
my duty to ease the burden of leadership when able for him.' Kathy shuddered as she <br />
remembered one of her nightmares, the words she realized echoing the words of a <br />
monster with her king's face in her dream. She look her head, 'No, I'd NEVER steal my <br />
king's responsibilities!' She felt sick at the thought,  'We all have our places! Mine is at his <br />
side in whatever role he sees fit! It is not mine to question! But to obey... ' Kathy <br />
rationalized her king had NOT told her not to try and relax a little during his recovery and <br />
she knew how men could be about any sickness or injury. 'All men. They think they're <br />
invincible or have to put up the farce of being invincible. Oh well, as long as I can present <br />
it in a way that it's his idea to take a break, he won't object I know it.' <br />
<br />
Kathy wandered the royal halls, hoping to catch up the latest happenings with Alexandra <br />
this morning. She hadn't been in her room. She hadn't been in the kitchen either. She <br />
hadn't even been in the garden or in the market place so that left just one place.<br />
<br />
Kathy had happily skipped into the throne room, saw her king and asked, &quot;My King <br />
Tommy,&quot; She asked sweetly, &quot;Do you know in your infinite knowledge where Alexandra is <br />
this fine morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy looked at her surprised and even confused that Kathy would even ask such a <br />
question. He stayed silent for several seconds as Kathy obediently stood waiting. <br />
<br />
&quot;She... is gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gone? Gone where?&quot; She asked innocently. <br />
<br />
Tommy sighed. &quot;She has left us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again with the innocence, &quot;Left us? Left for where?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy tried to say this the best he could without crushing Kathy's butterfly wings. <br />
&quot;Back... to her own nation... Alexandra... in... an incident, Alexandra was contracted into <br />
serving our court, her contract has expired and thus she was returned to her male human <br />
self and return to her own nation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Time froze solid! &quot;What?... When... when shall she be back?&quot; Kathy asked meekly. <br />
'Alexandra was once human?... I... I remember that from my nightmares.... someone <br />
changed her as part of her contract?  Who?... Someone selfish, immature, perverted, and <br />
manipulative....&quot; Kathy tried to remember who from her nightmare but it was no use and <br />
she didn't care, she didn't want to remember someone so awful and in particular anyone <br />
who had possibly wronged Alexandra. <br />
<br />
&quot;Never. Alexandra has returned to her original life, I offered her the chance to return to <br />
her old life and she had accepted it. She is gone from us now.&quot; Tommy said, feeling like he <br />
was missing something very important. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Kathy sighed, then began to ramble, &quot;No,no,no,no,no!&quot; The vixen rushed over to <br />
Tommy and flee to her knees in front of his throne and grabbed his legs and bowed her <br />
head, &quot;Bring her back! Please bring her back! Your Majesty! I beg you! Please! Bring her <br />
back! Bring her back~!&quot; Kathy cried, and continue to cry. Tommy watched in stunned <br />
silence as the vixen fell to pieces at his feet.  &quot;She's my friend! My only friend! The only <br />
friend I've ever had! Please bring her back! Please bring her back~!&quot; The vixen blubbered. <br />
<br />
Not knowing what else to do, the king of all fennec kitesune took up the vixen in his arms <br />
and held her close. &quot;I can't do that... it was her choice... no one else could make it for <br />
her....&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why! WHY MY KING! Why didn't she tell me she was leaving-?!  Why!  Did I mean nothing <br />
to her?! Was I nothing to her?! I-I-I-&quot; The vixen continued to cry in her king's arms. <br />
<br />
Her cries echoed through the throne room as she shuddered. <br />
<br />
Tommy slowly stroked her fur. 'I know better than anyone that you're an innocent victim in <br />
this Kathy. I'm sorry.' &quot;Maybe... she wanted the final time she'd be with you to be a happy <br />
occasion...so you wouldn't worry about her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... but... she didn't even give a chance to say goodbye!&quot; Kathy cried. &quot;She's always been <br />
my friend! The only one besides you my king whose ever been friends with me! Even in my <br />
nightmares she's my friend!... No matter what she was always there for me!... She was the <br />
only thing ever good about my nightmares... Even when she wasn't in the same room as <br />
me I knew that I wasn't alone as long she was with me... I don't want to be alone...&quot; <br />
Without Alexandra, Kathy had the sick feeling of being in a kingdom full of strangers. <br />
<br />
Tommy pulled her body against his and whispered in her ear, &quot;.... you're not alone, Kathy.&quot;</p>
