<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Duke was speechless. Dracula, the original lord of the vampires and his direct ancestor stood before him. How was he still alive? What was he doing here? Finally, what did he know about Vanessa? After lingering at the gravestone, Dracula turned, beckoning Duke and the others to follow as he returned to his cabin. As the trio entered, they now beheld the place Dracula had called home for centuries.<br />
<br />
The cabin was quaint, appearing to have been built by Dracula himself. The exquisitely built home contained perhaps five rooms. Duke now noticed a small library as well as a kitchen, all ancient in their appearance. A small fireplace now burned softly, illuminating the home in an orange glow. For whatever reason, Dracula did not appear to have any modern appliances as he now invited the trio to sit on a hand carved velvet couch. &quot;You built all this didn&#39;t you,&quot; Duke said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; Dracula replied. &quot;Lisa and I designed this cottage when we settled here in 1480. Since that time I have maintained it yet never updating.&quot; Dracula now moved towards his small kitchen, producing four goblets and a dark bottle. Pouring out a red liquid, he now offered his guests a glass. &quot;I&#39;m human I don&#39;t drink blood,&quot; Sahsa said softy. &quot;Its wine,&quot; Dracula stated. &quot;Red wine to be exact. Vampires don&#39;t always drink blood, we can consume human food. It has been far too long since I have entertained guests.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking a sip, the trio were surprised to find Dracula was being sincere. The wine was exquisite, Sasha finding it to be rich and wonderful in taste. &quot;That bottle is 300 years old,&quot; Dracula stated. &quot;I have been saving it for a special occasion. Meeting my descendents seemed an appropriate time.&quot; The trio nodded, taking a sip as they studied the legendary vampire. Dracula was an impressive physical specimen yet he also seemed sad. Duke wondered why he had never returned to the vampire realm. &quot;Excuse me Dracula..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vlad,&quot; Dracula replied. &quot;You may simply call me Vlad. I haven&#39;t been Dracula for a long, long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then Vlad,&quot; Wyatt replied. &quot;I need to ask you a question then. Why have you abandoned your people for centuries?&quot; Sasha and Duke shot Wyatt a look, telling him to be quiet. &quot;I will not be quiet,&quot; Wyatt exclaimed. &quot;Our great grandfather has been living as a hermit for centuries, his people believing him dead! If he had been there the Normal would have never dreamed of invading. My family is in danger because this old man refused to take responsibility!&quot; Sasha and Duke squirmed nervously on the couch, finding Wyatt&#39;s outburst excessive. The last thing they wanted was to anger the original lord of the vampires in his own home.<br />
<br />
Vlad though was quiet, Duke watching the man gaze off into space as he rested his strong hands upon his lap. Duke now noticed the small wedding band glint in the fire light of the cabin. &quot;Wyatt we didn&#39;t come here to cast blame,&quot; Duke stated. &quot;We need information on Vanessa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah and insulting Dracula in his house is just really fucking stupid,&quot; Sasha added. Wyatt sighed, offering a stiff apology before sulking. &quot;What can you tell us about the Mad Queen Vanessa?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vlad raised an eyebrow, taking a breath as he studied this trio carefully. &quot;Centuries ago a woman named Lisa came to my castle,&quot; he said. &quot;She wanted to be a doctor and sought my knowledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that have to do with the Mad Queen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting to that,&quot; Vlad stated, casting Wyatt a stern look. &quot;Lisa was an impressive woman. Fearless, determined, and caring. Within five minutes I was charmed, willing to show her the knowledge of the immortals and asking only for her company.&quot; Duke and Sasha watched as a soft smile cracked across his face as the memories of that time flooded back. &quot;For a time, I was happy,&quot; he continued. &quot;We wed, had a child. For a time all was well. She encouraged me to travel, to see the world and learn about humans. It turned out to be a mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened,&quot; Sasha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She died,&quot; Vlad said sadly. &quot;Burned at the stake for witch craft by the church. I lost my mind, enacted my revenge before our son Alucard mercifully ended my life. That should have been the end of my story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you cane back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We both did,&quot; Vlad replied looking at Duke. &quot;Neither one of us could explain it but, we had a second chance. We decided to travel, settling in this small town where the sun rarely shines. We began a new life here, a simple life. One where we could live in peace, away from both humans and vampires.&quot; Vlad sighed his powerful shoulders slumping in the glow of the fire. Already Duke and Sasha could sense that something bad had happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was with child,&quot; Vlad continued. &quot;Your grandfather Bastian. Unfortunately she became ill. Smallpox. She...she was dying and I couldn&#39;t bare the thought of losing her again.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You turned her didn&#39;t you,&quot; Duje asked, to which Vlad nodded. &quot;I did,&quot; he whispered. &quot;I swore I never would but I broke that promise to keep her alive. God, it seems, is not without a sense of humor. Lisa became a vampire but, she wasn&#39;t Lisa anymore.&quot; Sashas eyes went wide, slowly it dawned on her what Vlad was saying.  &quot;Are you telling me that the Mad Queen is..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Vlad said sadly. &quot;Vanessa the Mad Queen is my wife Lisa Tepes. When she turned, she lost her mind, tried to kill everyone both human and vampire. She renounced her name and I was forced to banish her into the realm of man. As penance I renounced my throne, going into exile in this village, the only place in the world that i have ever known peace. I abandoned my son Bastian to rule in my stead and hoped the vampires would forget I ever existed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They didn&#39;t,&quot; Wyatt replied. &quot;Your grandson, my father Miro held you in the highest regard. He said you were an example of the strength of vampires.&quot; Vlad simply shook his head no. &quot;I am an example of our hubris,&quot; he said. The trio paused, looking first to the forlorn vampire before turning to one another. Despite Vlad&#39;s guilt over turning his wife, they needed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandfather,&quot; Duke said softly. &quot;Your family needs you. As we speak, Vanessa holds dominion over the realm of the vampires. Many will suffer if she isn&#39;t stopped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Including my children,&quot; Wyatt added. &quot;If you want to atone for your mistakes, help us now in rescuing your innocent descendents.&quot; Duke, Sasha, and Wyatt watched as Vlad twitched, a stern expression crossing his face as he pondered what they were asking. All they could do now was hope, Dracula would find his resolve and help them.</p>
