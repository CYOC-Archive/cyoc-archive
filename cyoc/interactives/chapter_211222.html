<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Raiden paused, nervously glancing at the scene before him. The young kitsune had never seen his father act like this before.<br />
<br />
Raiden had heard stories of course. Fukushu was the most fearsome, the most violent, the most blood thirsty kitsune warrior to ever exist. Raiden thought the stories were exaggerated. Yes, he had seen with his own eyes his father fight off the kumiho that had attacked him but that was different. Raiden was in danger at the time and everyone understood that a parent would go to extraordinary lengths to protect their children. <br />
<br />
This was different. Raiden had just returned home when he saw Akira and Granny Yuriko exit their home. No one had even noticed, not even his parents. Before he could even ask what was going on, he watched his father crash through the wall of the house in anger before attacking. The attack from his perspective was brutal, his father never even unsheathing his sword as he attacked. Raiden had never seen someone hit so hard, the kitsune had watched his father pummel a werewolf into submission. If he had not run to his father&#39;s side, he wondered if he would have even stopped.<br />
<br />
Gazing down fearfully at the mangled body of Morgan, Raiden noted she had already transformed back into human form. He did not recognize the woman, she looked to be middle age with dark hair that was now matted with her blood. So beaten by his fathers attack, Raiden could see she could barely move, tears leaking from her eyes as she mumbled to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful boy,&quot; Fukushu said harshly. &quot;She is dangerous.&quot; Raiden doubted this woman posed much of a threat at this point. The kit felt sorry for her if anything, she appeared to be in incredible pain as she struggled to simply breathe. Leaning closer he now tried to hear what she was saying, an odd look crossing his face as he finally heard her words.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Raiden,&quot; Fukushu asked. &quot;What did she say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy,&quot; Raiden replied quietly. &quot;Shes calling for her mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu paused, a concerned look crossing his face as he looked between Morgan, Raiden, Yuriko, and Akira. Despite the violence of his attack, he was still cautious of the dark sorceress&#39;s magic. Already he could feel something building, a dark power that was slowly advancing towards them. &quot;Raiden,&quot; he said softly, his eyes trained on the woods beyond. &quot;Help Yuriko and Akira inside now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do as I say,&quot; Fukushu said quickly. &quot;And hurry! This battle is not yet over.&quot; Raiden quieted, quickly running to Yuriko as they hoisted Akira to his feet. Yuriki was still in shock, shouldering the unconscious six tailed kitsune as they made their way towards the damaged house. Glancing back the kit now watched hisbfather unsheath his sword as his eyes narrowed.<br />
<br />
Fukushu grit his teeth, his body tensing as he anxiously glanced at the forest before him. Something powerful was advancing towards them, a creature that felt both familiar and yet foreign at the same time. &quot;What have you summoned Morgan,&quot; he growled, his eyes going between the battered sorceress and the trees. <br />
<br />
Fukushu&#39;s question was answered as two beings now shambled out of the forest. The kitsunes eyes narrowed as he gazed at the pair of undead slowly advancing towards him. Despite the emaciated and rotted appearance of the corpses, Fukushu recognized exactly who they were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika Harris and Kellie Carlson,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;Clever girl Morgan, summoning the spirits of the two wizards who hate me the most.&quot; The corpses of his old enemies now snarled, their eyes glowing red with hatred inside their emaciated skulls as they lunged towards the kitsune.<br />
<br />
Fukushu dodged the initial attack. Despite being dead for decades, both corpses seemed to possess the same magic they once had in life. The corpse of Kellie Carlson was adorned in the golden armor she was able to summon when she was alive. Coated in grime from the grave the corpse of Morgan&#39;s mother moved rather quickly as she now lept to her daughters aid, unleashing a blast of magic that shattered the ground Fukushu stood on. <br />
<br />
The nine tailed dodged the initial attack, preparing a spell of his own as Mika now charged at him. In life Mika Harris&#39;s spells were connected with the elements of water and quite powerful. Married to Claudia Harris, she had been the calmer spouse but the one Fukushu feared more. When he had attacked, Fukushu had made sure Mika was away. Despite Claudia&#39;s strength, it was Mika that the kitsune feared could destroy his plans in framing Evan Harris and pushing him towards darkness. Killing Claudia had succeeded in his plans, eliminating a powerful foe and driving Mika insane with rage. Before she died, she had believed Evan Harris had killed her beloved wife and turned her rage towards him. Now, with the benefit of time and the knowledge of the afterlife, Mika understood that it was Fukushu who had destroyed her beloved wife.<br />
<br />
Fukushu grunted as Mika now attacked, the wizard had caught him in the chest with swipe of her enchanted chains. Rubbing the spot, the kitsune now barely avoided a second blow from her watery blades as the wizard looked tobtake her fury out on the kitsune responsible for the death of her family.<br />
<br />
The battle was pitched, both sides every matched as they exchanged blows. Unfortunately for the kitsune, he was at a disadvantage that had nothing to do with numbers. Kellie and Mika were fueled by rage and hatred. Any damage inflicted on their bodies had no effect. The undead wizards severed body parts would reattach with every strike he made, their howls of pure hatred made the kitsune realize they couldn&#39;t be reasoned with. These creatures may have the souls of his old enemies but it was clouded by anger they felt towards him.<br />
<br />
Fukushu paused, trying to catch his breath as his latest attack sent the pair sailing backwards. Already he could see his undead opponents attempting to stand, the sounds of their broken bodies cracking back into shape unnerving. They wouldn&#39;t stop and Fukushu was running out of ideas. How could someone stop a creature that functioned on pure, righteous, hatred.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu turned, surprised to see Darren now sprinted to his side. The youngvteen now casting a spell of his own as he withdrew the Dragons Tongue. &quot;Leave Catalyst,&quot; he stated. &quot;This is not your fight!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to just let these things hurt people,&quot; Darren stated. &quot;What are they anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Spirits of vengeance,&quot; Fukushu grumbled. &quot;Morgan has summoned the souls of her mother Kellie and Yurikos aunt Mika.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can they be stopped,&quot; Darren asked. Fukushu paused, he wasn&#39;t quite sure. As the two undead wizards attacked once more, Darren blocked them attempting to counter. The spell he cast knocking the two back harmlessly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm these things seem kind of unkillable,&quot; Darren replied nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re already dead Catalyst,&quot; Fukushu exclaimed. &quot;I&#39;m open for any suggestions.&quot; Darren grimaced, blocking an attack from his undead opponents. He needed to come up with an idea if they were going to defeat their undead opponents.</p>
