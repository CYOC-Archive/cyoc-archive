<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">History was next, and getting to it was going to be a pain. I was still cursed, so looking at any of the others wouldn’t be good for my health, and the class was on the opposite side of the school. Keeping my eyes glued to the marble floor, I stayed near the wall and followed it all the way round. Turning corners and having no encounters. No monsters grabbing me, no werewolves tracking me, nothing. Finally a stroke of good luck, I counted the remaining classes and finally got to my destination. Still looking away as I stepped inside, and hit my head against fur.<br />
It was short, well groomed, and quite soft. Relaxing even, as my forehead rubbed against what I was assuming to be this creatures shoulder. A bit of a cushiony sensation provided by the impact, the monsters arm rising and patting my head. Large digits scratching the top of my skull, as I sunk further into whoever this was. Nose perfectly positioned against this other man’s pits, the fur there partially wet and spreading his fragrance. It’s an inviting, musky scent, hidden behind sandalwood and citrus deodorant. The added body spray quite heavily laid on, like a feeble attempt to overpower his natural stink. Yet despite his efforts, it’s as clear as it could be. Something heavy and hefty starting to bump against my leg as other students push past us. His cock and balls swaying underneath his loincloth, and his strangely familiar voice liberating me from my current trance.<br />
“You have gotten quite older, Jeremy.”<br />
I finally look up, ignoring the room and gazing into the eyes of a minotaur. Bull-like face being human enough to show expression. A joy filled smile being shone at me, as if he’s reuniting with a long-lost friend. Who could he be? There’s nothing remaining of whoever he was, at least visually.<br />
“Uh, yeah. Seems to be happening to everyone.”<br />
“It has, yes. But you are still human so it is much easier to tell. Done your readings for the class? I am free after if you are still behind.”<br />
That’s when it clicked. This wasn’t a student, this was a teacher.<br />
“Mr Holstein?” He nodded, and I felt myself lock up. Of course it would be him, he is the history teacher, but also why is he a minotaur? It’s in line with everything else, teachers are leaders, but still its… so weird to take in. I did like Mr Holstein, he was caring and kind, putting in the extra mile to make sure we all passed. He even came over to my house after school to repeat lessons, always having time for me and anyone else.<br />
Though now he went from an average man to a minotaur. Mr Holstein was the definition of your standard guy. 30-something, partially balding and a little chubby. A few hairs always sticking out of his shirt, top button undone and tie never finding itself around his neck. He did dress well, but it was still dressing light. Preferring to complement his garments with dress shorts and brown shoes. Simple, but it worked, and was perfect for the man he is.<br />
But now, the only piece of clothing he has is a single loincloth that does barely anything. He’s the beast of legends, hooved feet and masculine chest. My curse burning within me, hardon forming and rising as this monster takes a step closer. One arm grabbing the top of my pants, tough nails almost completely black, pulling my trousers all the way down. Lifting my legs one at a time to unloop the covering, and toss it to a corner of the room.<br />
Meanwhile, I’m treated to a view of this behemoths back. V shaped body spread for my appreciation. The numerous furs hiding his leathery skin, but I still need to explore what he has to offer. At first, I just put the tips of my fingers against his fur. Cautiously pressing down as the hairs part, and I touch his rough skin. It’s thick, yet still taut. Muscles well formed and well spread, my arousal turning almost painful as my need increases with the display. Mr Holstein freeing my feet as he strips me of socks and shoes. Standing upright as he begins to pull up my shirt, and I use that opportunity to stare at his heavy chest.<br />
He&#39;s sculpted like a Greek statue. Pecs heaving out, abs forming an eight pack and trailing down to his loincloth. He’s just as hard as me, his undergarments just flimsy cloth that can’t contain the bulls full length. Hung like a horse, and with no sheath to contain his dick. No wonder the teacher’s only in a loincloth, other clothes would be painful for his animalistic cock.<br />
“There you are, it is more comfortable, is it not?”  I didn’t even notice I was naked. Not until the cold wind from the nearby window blew against my skin. My cheeks starting to flush, Mr Holstein keeping a comforting hand on my shoulder. “Do not worry, this is just how I teach my class. See?”<br />
He gestures to the other seats, all the other students matching our attire. Gnomes with their thin bodies and wild hairdos, Gnolls with their spotted fur and torn underwear, Goliaths with stone like skin and pelts covering their crotch. Everyone really is in the nude, and I’m also the only human here.<br />
“Thank you, sir. But I shouldn’t hold up the class anymore.” I take the nearest seat and settle in, simultaneously glad that the situation is over, and missing the intimacy I felt being near my teacher. To distract myself from my current bewilderment, I started to take in my environment.<br />
At the very least, the building looks a lot more inviting than the summoning hall. Brownish-grey stone floor, square like pattern spread out as if it was actually made from brickwork. Walls smooth and white, pillars trimmed with gold and found in all four corners. Metal brazier’s hanging from the sides of the room, it has a striking eastern design to it, looks to be made of jade.<br />
Curiosity peaked, I check out of the left window to see we’re on a hilltop. The Chinese aesthetic continuing outside, with statues of guardian beasts and peaceful streams running across the land. Lanterns hanging outside the other buildings, stalls set about as merchants peddle wares or offer food. I’m still not familiar with where I am, must be a pretty far off zone, or maybe even unreleased content. If the Far Seer’s can get into this sort of stuff, then whose to say Mr. Holstein can’t?<br />
“Class, today we will be learning about Shoonys. Remember, these lessons will give you an innate bonus to all interactions with the noted creature, so pay as much attention as you can.”<br />
My teacher pulled a book out from under his desk. A leatherbound grimoire, gem encrusted in the centre and emitting a bright light. Reflecting from the book to his pointed horns, and from his horns to my eyes. Momentarily blinding me, as he starts to read from the text, and my bracelet starts to activate.<br />
“Shoonys are dog-like creatures. Easily identifiable from other beast-kin due to their short stature and innocent expression.”<br />
I blinked a few times, my vision blurry, but recovering. Though something was weird, my eyeline slightly lower than before.<br />
“These creatures detest violence unless absolutely necessary. Valuing friendship, kindness, and comfort. Though if needed, they will fight for what is important.” <br />
I looked to my teacher, expression softening as I remember how strong our bond was. He really cared for me, and really did anything he could to help me learn. I needed to be there for him when it mattered, and I knew I would.<br />
“Thanks to their heritage, Shoonys mechanically share several traits with dogs. Including but not limited to incredible hearing, fantastic vision, and a snout that can detect almost any scent.”<br />
My ears perked up, Mr Holstein’s words never clearer. My eyes refocus, the slightest smile visible on his older face, a few greying bits of fur softening with his expression. My nose picking up a new smell, it’s wet and contained, but still reaching me.<br />
“In some cases, a Shoony may even feel the need to absorb the musk of another beast-kin. Their sensitive noses unable to resist the call of mating season, and their eager selves happy to help any beasts in need of a partner.”<br />
That stink was invading me, my head lifting as I visibly sniffed the air and followed the trail. Rising from my seat as I stumbled forward, not used to my smaller legs, but motivated by my natural duty. Someone needed me, and I was getting closer. Reaching Mr Holstein as I recognised him as the source of the smell. My head between his legs, nose rubbing against his loincloth as I whiffed what I could. It was the same musk, like a barnyard, recently cleaned yet forever stained with the animal’s scents. <br />
“All Shoonys are skilled with their hands, and able to take off another mans loincloth. Their paws perfect for unwrapping the fabric, and stroking a juicy cock.”<br />
Hairs were starting to cover my hand, the texture of my palms beginning to change as I unwrapped Mr Holstein’s loincloth. Folding it underneath him, then wrapping a hand against the top of his dick. The mottled black and pink head barely fitting in my hand. It was huge, but I was used to this sort of thing. It was in my nature after all. My teacher pausing his lesson to look down, scratching the back of my ear as my tongue sits between my lips.<br />
“Good boy, are you listening?” I nod immediately. “Yes, am I listening well?” His response being another scratch. “Perfectly. I know you will take every word to heart.”</p>
