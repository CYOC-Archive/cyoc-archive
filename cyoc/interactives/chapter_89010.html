<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Clemens returned from his shower to find Jenny getting ready to set the table. Things were progressing for both of them and their wedding was getting closer. True there was a lot to think through and coordinate, but the fact that they were getting closer was enough to see a light at the end of the tunnel. She gave a small smile as he approached the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there you are, looking nice and shiny,&quot; Jenny said with a smile as he approached.<br />
<br />
Clemens managed a small smile back as she rubbed one arm before turning back to finishing to set the table. That was actually one of the things he did enjoy with regard to his choice of animal to become when he took the Animatrix Serum. Any Animal Person could still shower and bathe, but there were always complications. Mammals, because of their fur would have to deal with issues related to their fur. It likely wouldn&#39;t smell all that great while it was wet and would complicate matters with regards to cleaning as bar soaps weren&#39;t designed to lather on fur. They&#39;d have to use liquid based soaps and conditioners to do the job required, and several companies were starting to sell such soaps on a much larger scale than used before. And then once clean, it would take time to dry off and would require greater maintenance with regard to the shower itself. Clemens remembered having to occasionally clean his own hair out of the drain when he was human and that was just with hair from his head. George and Molly probably had to do a lot more given that they&#39;d have to clean out shed fur. By contrast, standard soaps could lather, to a degree, on his scales and while drying he had to be careful that he didn&#39;t rub scales the wrong way, he could dry off at a faster rate than any Animal Person who had fur to dry off. And at the same time, Clemens had noticed that his scales did have a bit of additional luster after just coming out of the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a new penny,&quot; Clemens laughed as he sat down at his chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say you&#39;re worth considerably more than a penny,&quot; Jenny commented as she sat down in her own chair and the two began eating.<br />
<br />
The two ate quietly for a few moments before the next subject really came up. Clemens was quietly cutting his serving of pork into smaller pieces when Jenny came up with the question that they would have to talk about next.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... who would prefer as your Best Man?&quot; Jenny asked, &quot;My brother or your cousin.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was something that Clemens was unsure on how to answer. He&#39;d met Jenny&#39;s brother Peter a couple of times and the meetings had been friendly. The only &quot;bad&quot; thing had been the standard protective brother type of line where Clemens had been told that if he ever hurt Jenny that there was no place that he could hide. Of course the two of them ended up laughing at each other&#39;s jokes and Clemens learned that Jenny got much of her interest in sci-fi and fantasy stories thanks to her brother introducing her to the stories as children. But Peter Young lived a few towns over and presently coached high school football. So it wasn&#39;t as if he and Clemens were especially close and the contact the two had had wasn&#39;t enough to really grow closer. Though at the same time he had to consider Joseph&#39;s travel time and the time he could get off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... to be honessst, my firsst thought would be Jossseph,&quot; Clemens commented after a moment, &quot;He was my besst friend growing up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny didn&#39;t say anything for a moment, chewed her food and then swallowed and looked over to Clemens. Clemens then noticed that she had one eyebrow raised as she turned her head toward him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something you think that your cousin doesn&#39;t deserve to be part of the wedding?&quot; Jenny asked, &quot;the choice of Best Man is yours... just as the Maid of Honor is my choice... I&#39;m not going judge you if you choose your cousin over my brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It isssn&#39;t about choiccess,&quot; Clemens answered, &quot;It&#39;s about what can be done. Jossseph hasss to come across the country during a time when he iss expected to be at work. He can get leave... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t want to be a burden on him? Is that it?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He livess to teach,&quot; Clemens answered, &quot;Nothing makess him sssmile more than to ssee kids do well. If he iss the bessst man than he&#39;d have to come earlier to be part of the rehearssssal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he wouldn&#39;t come because of that?&quot; Jenny wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... if I asssked, he&#39;d come,&quot; Clemens gave a shrug, &quot;but I don&#39;t want to take advantage of him...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a brief silence for a moment before Clemens continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it isn&#39;t like your brother and I are on bad termss,&quot; Clemens then finished.<br />
<br />
Jenny noticed how Clemens&#39;s voice trailed off at the end. It was clearly something he was thinking over a lot of things. He was even prodding a piece of pork along his plate with his fork as the two of them talked.<br />
<br />
&quot;But if the other things weren&#39;t an issue... who would YOU choose?&quot; Jenny asked him, &quot;It is your choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clemens nodded. He knew that. &quot;If there wasss nothing elsse to factor in... I&#39;d choossse Jossseph... he is who I am clossesst to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then maybe you should call him, see if he&#39;d want to and if he can,&quot; Jenny spoke, &quot;If he can, that&#39;s great... and if he he can only get the time off to come to the wedding, than we can ask Peter who is free.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clemens then nodded.</p>
