<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Something was bothering Jennifer. Was it the fact that she looked like a 13-year-old? She felt like that anyway. Others treated her like a 5th grader which made her tick. She was older. She could handle the school day all by herself. She even had a boyfriend for pete&#39;s sake. So why? Why was this frustrating her so much. She was a passerby right now. Everytime she woke up the changes had already happened. She would either look older or younger. Something was not adding up. This time it seemed that she was experiecing them on real time or... Was it because of something else she had done. She had talked with more people and apologized for them. What else she was missing? What if it was her 18-year-old mind messing with her younger self perception of reality. Could it be possible that her lies were affecting her current situation. Ridiculous . That can&#39;t be the case. It was natural to lie. Then again... The whole school day felt different. She never had a friend like Holly in her life or an older boyfriend named Marcus. Her friend&#39;s name was Kat- Holly. No, it was Ka- Holly. No, no, it started with aitch and not with H. Wait. What was she thinking... She couldn&#39;t remember her friend from the past. Was it just a dream. No, she was sure that she had talked with some other girl and that she was older... who was she..? Jennifer&#39;s memories were bouncing up and down as past people, beside her mother, had been replaced with her new friends. What was going on? She placed her hand on top of forehead and noticed that it was warm. Did she have sudden fever or was she getting sick again. Holly had been her best friend since elementary school... No... She wasn&#39;t.. There was another girl... she had blonde hair... Kay- Her name was Katie!<br />
<br />
Jennifer remembered her name as if she hadn&#39;t heard it in a long time. Wasn&#39;t she a high-school senior... Why would she be friends with someone from high-school when she was still a middle schooler. That didn&#39;t make any sense at all. Was she Jennifer&#39;s cousin or something? She could feel her brain not connecting the dots as the Katie&#39;s face was foggy in Jennifer&#39;s mind. She only remembered her name. Something as odd happened with her this time. Her body didn&#39;t show any signs of headaches or tremors as she remembered her name. Strange. Jennifer also remembered that there was another boy who she had crush on. Who was he again... She had no idea.<br />
<br />
The bus halted near her home and Jennifer headed straight to her home&#39;s front door. No distractions this time. Thankfulyl the home looked the same but the grass and weeds sere a sore sight to behold. Who would even tend them as her mother was a single mom taking care of... Uhmm... Well at least she provided food for them. Her mother were always busy with her own little business so she had no time to cut grass anyway. Jennifer quickly opened the door and walked inside the house. Without thinking she took off all her clothes, flung them all over the floor and made a lenghty stretch to enjoy her right of freedom. No more clothes for today. Birthday suit made her feel more open and free as she inhaled the familiar scent of her house. The school felt too sanitary and hospital-like for her own taste. Jennifer turned her head and saw her mother sitting on the living room sofa. She was waving her hand to Jennifer as next to Sylvia was a sleeping man who her mother hugged. He snored on the sofa as they both wore morning jackets to cover their bodies. Jennifer waved back at her mother and begun to walk up the stairs with a genuine smile. The man must have been one of her singing clients who paid a lot of money for her mother&#39;s lessons.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was back her own room and took out the homework she had to do. In Jennifer&#39;s mind all she had to do was to make sure that all of it was done before tomorrow. Her mother didn&#39;t care if she learned it or not. So Jennifer used her phone to just cheat all the answers to all the questions leaving couple of mistakes in. This way teachers wouldn&#39;t bother her or her mother. During the dinner her mother had prepared canned tuna with oven heated fries. It was feast as her mother happily told Jennifer how much money she gotten this time. It was unsual for them to eat fish like this. Usually her mother was a penny pincher and relied on the coupons she had. Tomorrow was different. She promised to order pizza after Jennifer gets home from school as they had some money to spare. The sun was already setting in distance making the sky cool blue. Jennifer decided take a small nap in her room as her mother had an another one of her assistants to come help with her plumbing. Jennifer listened their work with a left ear as she closed her eyes. Slowly falling asleep on top of her mattress. The day had been busy. The sounds what her mother made echoed in her room as she fell into more deeper slumber.<br />
<br />
That same night before the clock had hit twelve am. Jennifer woke up from her nap and walked to the bathroom to take a leak. The house was quiet as her mother was sleeping inside her own room. Jennifer opened the bathroom door gently and without disturbing her mother sat on the toilet. Somehow as she was sitting there she felt her stomach turning upside down. Something was twisting it like a blender. Mushing it&#39;s contents like berries and fruits in a small bowl. Jennifer begun to sweat, ears begun to tear up and she felt weak as she had to take support from the sink. The whole bathroom was twisting and turning as Jennifer&#39;s vision was rapidly blurred and distorted. Things didn&#39;t feel normal. Memories, names and everything becoming a huge memory smoothie as everything felt beige and cardboard. She could only remember her own mother, the house and herself clearly. What could she do in this situation? Was this the transformation she experienced every night? Was she getting older or younger this time? Jennifer didnt know. Everything felt possible as the memories were shuffled back-and-forth like a deck of playing cards.</p>
