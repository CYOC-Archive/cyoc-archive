<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fukushu snarled, lashing out once more with a brutal attack that knocked Evan into a grove of trees. This was no fight, this was a street brawl.<br />
<br />
While Fukushu&#39;s attention was split between his two opponents, it appeared they weren&#39;t on the same page. Every time Evan gained a slight advantage, he would immediately make a move towards Raiden and Sachiko. In those instances either Fukushu or Morgan would try to stop him. Morgan was gentler in her methods where as Fukushu would simply batter the dark wizard with magic or physical attacks. Neither side seemed to be gaining any advantage though. Instead, all parties involved were bloodied and battered as the fight raged on. Growling Fukushu now fired off a pair of fireballs at Evan, only for Morgan to jump in the way, takingbthe brunt of the attack. As Morgan flew backwards, Evan screamed, countering with a blast that struck Fukushu in the chest knocking the kitsune backwards. &quot;This is growing tiresome,&quot; Fukushu thought in annoyance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu paused, turning in surprise as Darren now sprinted towards him. &quot;How did you get here,&quot; he now asked the teenage boy. &quot;I don&#39;t know its weird,&quot; Darren said quickly. &quot;Somehow the sword was talking to me. I..I just knew Raiden and Sachiko were in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu now grinned, understanding what had happened. As the guardian of the kitsune the Dragons Tongue would warn its wielder if a kitsune was in grave danger. Considering how precious the kits were, Fukushu now understood that the sword would push Darren to help them in a time of need. &quot;Wbos that with Evan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An old enemy of mine,&quot; Fukushu stated. Darren nodded, furrowing his brow as he now stood shoulder to shoulder with Fukushu.<br />
<br />
Evan now slowly stood, his eyes narrowing as he glared at Darren. &quot;Was hoping to see you sooner rather than later,&quot; he grinned. &quot;Save me the trouble if getting rid of you.&quot; Evan now yelled, firing off a blast of energy directly at Darren.<br />
<br />
Much to the dark wizards surprise, Darren now deflected the blast before counering with a spell of his own. It amazed the dark wizard that Darren was progressing as quickly as he was. When he had first met the boy he had seen that Darren had alot of raw potential but no skill. Now it appeared that the boys training was beginning to pay off. Still, evn with Darren&#39;s improved abilities, the boy was no match for him.<br />
<br />
The two wizards now charged at one another, unleashing magical blasts of energy, which their opponent easily deflected. Evan, while still confident, was getting annoyed at this teenagers tenacity. Closing the gap he now attacked, hoping to obliterate the Catalyst once and for all.<br />
<br />
What happened instead was a complete shock. Evans eyes went wide as Darren dispelled his attack before stunning Evan with an attack of his own. Stumbling the dark wizard now stared at Darren in shock. This teenager had gained an advantage on him. For Evan, the blow was a massive one to his ego.<br />
<br />
Seeing an advantage, Darren now readied himself. Thrusting forward he now looked to stop Evan once and for all. Instead, and to the surprise of everyone, a silver werewolf now lept in front of Evan. Darren and Evans eyes going wide in shock as he impaled Morgan with the Dragons Tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan!&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan now pushed Darren away useing his magic, the teen tumbling backwards as the dark wizard now cradled the injured werewolf. Removing  the blade, Evan now tossed it to the side as Morgan once more assumed human form. &quot;You&#39;re going to be okay,&quot; he said quickly as he tried tibstem the bleeding. Morgan coughed, her lips flecked with blood as she gazed up at her nephew.<br />
<br />
Darren was confused, watching as Evan now fearfully tended to the Lycan sorceress. In his dealings with the dark wizard, he had seen him show little regard for anyone but himself. Darren now gasped as Evans eyes locked with his. The dark wizards face was twisted, a look of rage and despair emanating from his eyes. Evan looked as if he had lost his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did this to her,&quot; he bellowed, his mouth frothing. &quot;I&#39;ll kill you! Do you hear me! I&#39;ll kill.....&quot;<br />
<br />
That was all Evan could scream before Fukushu attacked. Grabbing the dark wizard by the hair, Fukushu now delivered a thunderous right hook before slamming the wizards face into the ground. A sickening thud now emanated throughout the woods as Evans body went limp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he dead,&quot; Darren asked cautiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Fukushu murmured. Staring down at the unconscious wizards, Fukushu breathed a sigh of relief as he turned his attention to Darren and the others. &quot;Is everyone alright? Are you hurt?&quot; Darren and the others now shook their head no, Fukushu breathing a sigh of relief as he now narrowed his eyes. He had one last piece of business to attend to.<br />
<br />
******************************<br />
<br />
&quot;Casseus,&quot; the Boss called. &quot;Have you heard anything from Evan or Morgan?&quot; Casseus now entered the Bosses office, closing the door behind him as he approached. &quot;No,&quot; he stated. The Boss sighing in annoyance at his answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell I thought the kid was taking her out to scout,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Where are they scouting? Mars?!&quot; The sound of the door being thrown open now drew the Boss and Casseus attention, both their eyes narrowing as they gazed at the pair of kitaune in the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe these belong to you,&quot; Fukushu stated, tossing the unconscious bodies of both Evan and Morgan in front of the Bosses desk. The Boss now stared down at his employees, noting their extensive injuries. &quot;I take it this was you work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can take credit for the boy but the Catalyst was the one to incapacitate the woman.&quot; The Boss imply nodded, pressing a button on his desk a medical team now entered, placing both Morgan and Evan on a stretcher. &quot;Take them to medical,&quot; he said. The Normals medical team now went about their task, casting a uneasy glance in Fukushu&#39;s direction. As they left, it was now just the four of them left. &quot;So I take it you two have come to finish us off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu now glanced back at Akira, the six tailed stoic as he stared at both Casseua and the Boss. &quot;Akira is not her for my protection,&quot; Fukushu smirked. &quot;He&#39;s here for yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
A look of confusion now crossed Casseua face as he studied his old allie. Slowly, it began to dawn him what Fukushu meant.  Akira was the only one keeping him from reducing the entire building to ash.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve come to talk Boss,&quot; Fukushu stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes to talk,&quot; Fukushu said slowly as he stepped closer. &quot;You see, I am growing rather tired of you attacking my child and my people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; the Boss stated, folding his hands under his chin. &quot;Well fortunately I have some spare time. Say what you wish but you should know that that kid of yours kind of a high priority with our organization.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu chuckled softly, shaking his head before glaring at the Boss. &quot;Until today,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ve come to parlay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Parlay,&quot; Casseua asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;You see, after several attempts on my sons life, on Akiras daughter, and even the attempted genocide of my people, I have grown weary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you want,&quot; the Boss asked. &quot;And what are you offering in return?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Their will be no further attempts on my sons life or Akiras daughter,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;You seem like a sensible person Boss. You must realize that any further attempts to eliminate them will only cost you money and man power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we haven&#39;t found the answer yet,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;All puzzles have answers, if I keep trying it will only be a matter of time before we succeed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Fukushu conceded. &quot;However, I do not think you know who you are dealing with? Tell me, what do you know of MY history?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Skilled general, son of Tatsu, fought the last Catalyst,&quot; the Boss replied nonchalantly. &quot;I still don&#39;t see why this means I call off the hit on those kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Boss we are both in the business of genocide.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Boss paused as Fukushu now slowly began to pace. The nine tailed kitsunes eyes fixed on the hooded figure sitting before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am almost 900 years old,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;During my centuries of life I have made it my mission to eliminate any and all threats I deemed problematic to my livelihood. The amount of blood I have shed could fill oceans. Humans, the kumiho, and countless others have become nothing but footnotes in history thanks to me. Murder is as natural to me as breathing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu now slowly approached the Bossea desk, placing his hands upon it as he dug his claws into the polished oak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ask Casseua or even that bastard kumiho you dug up about what I can do,&quot; he sneered. &quot;They will tell you that my resolve to destroy any and all who stand in my way. All who have opposed me have been turned to ash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets say I believe you for a moment,&quot; the Boss replied. &quot;Why not do that now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am trying a different path,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;But do not mistake my kindness for weakness. Any move made against the kits and I shall unleash my wrath upon you and all you hold dear. When I am finished I will have scrubbed the very existence of the Normal from the pages of history.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about the Catalyst?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu shrugged his eyes still fixed upon the Boss. &quot;The Catalyst can take care of himself,&quot; he stated. &quot;However, I will give you some friendly advise. Fighting a Catalyst is no easy task. Believe me, I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Boss nodded, leaning back in his chair as he pondered the proposal. If he left the kits alone, he wouldn&#39;t need to worry about Fukushu. However, if he continued to try and eliminate them the kitsune would happily destroy everything he had built and dance on its ashes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;I&#39;ll leave the kits alone. The Catalyst though is fair game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Fukushu stated. Slowly the kitsune now turned to leave, glancing back once more to look at the Boss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pray that we never meet again for next time I will not be so merciful.&quot;</p>
