<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jeff came to the next morning, he couldn’t remember anything after the last bet of the night - the one where he and all the guys bet their proudest thing. He recalled he had a good hand, but wasn’t sure if he won - and all he knew in the moment was that his hangover was making his head throb. His stomach began to churn as he rolled over and realized he was feeling sick, he quickly bolted out of bed and stumbled into the conjoining bathroom, where he emptied the contents of his stomach - mostly beer - into the toilet. ‘This is the worst hangover ever…’ He thought to himself, despite this only being his second one. <br />
When he finally started feeling better, he managed to stand himself up to clean out his mouth and wipe off his face, but paused when he looked in the mirror. He still looked like himself, but he noticed he looked far more mature than he did the previous day. He didn’t really look any older, apart from the nice, thick beard around his face that looked well maintained. Below that was a hairless torso that instead of looking like the usual body Jeff was used to, instead carried the thick hard-earned muscle of someone who spent most of their free time in the gym. His pecs stood out past his face, restricting him from being able to look directly down at the rest of his body (both due to the size of them blocking his line of sight, and him not being able to turn his head low enough before they pressed into his chest), his shoulders seemed to almost swallow up some of his thicker neck. Thick volleyball-sized arms protruded out from either side, with thick and powerful forearms leading to massive hands. His stomach was ridged, displaying 8-pack abs that were visible even unflexed, and obliques that you could cut a steak on.<br />
It was at this point he noticed his increased height. He had shot up over a foot in height, going from 5’4” to 6’7”. He noticed this because, well, instead of only seeing his stomach over the bathroom counter, he could see his large steel-pipe sized quads and his cock and balls - at least the base of it. Still mostly flaccid, his cock swung between his legs  and his cockhead wasn’t visible in the mirror until he stepped back against the far wall, where it stopped at the 11-inch mark with a pair of large egg-sized balls to match. He realized it was longer than George’s, but as he thought about it, he had probably ‘gained’ an inch due to the lack of fat padding he didn’t have at the base of his cock, unlike George would’ve had. <br />
“Woah…” Jeff grumbled, coming out far lower in pitch and with far more authority than he was used to. He reached toward his neck with one of his thick hands and felt a massive Adam’s apple hiding just under his beard. “Holy shit.” He said, louder this time, feeling the vibration in his throat as his booming voice filled the bathroom he was in.<br />
Jeff returned to the bedroom with a cocky smile on his face, but as he did, he realized he wasn’t in his usual bedroom. Sure it had all his stuff in it, and clothes that fit his massive new body were strewn about like they always were, but this room was larger - this was the master bedroom, where his parents usually slept. Only now this was his room… Jeff peeked in the bathroom and it was filled with beard care products, nutrition supplements for bodybuilders, even a hamper for his dirty clothes (that was usually unused, as Jeff, like most 15-year old boys, preferred the bedroom floor for dirty clothes). He searched through the dressers, finding all kinds of workout gear in addition to his usual clothes, resized to fit his new massive form. <br />
This new revelation had begun to concern Jeff - what had happened to Mi- his dad? Jeff felt confused, why was it difficult to call Mi-… his dad by anything other than his name? He decided to quickly put a pair of basketball shorts on (choosing to go commando underneath) before leaving his bedroom.<br />
Jeff walked downstairs, making the floor creak from his new weight as he did, where he found Jane, his mom, cooking breakfast. For the most part, everything looked the same in the house. However, Jeff noticed that the family photograph hanging from the wall was different - instead of standing in front of his parents, he was tall and muscular, standing behind Mike, his dad, looking proud, with a hand on Mike’s shoulder.<br />
“Morning Jeff.” Jane called out, having heard him approaching through the loud thumps he made as he walked.<br />
“Morning Jane.” He replied with a smile. He sniffed the air, smelling the aromatic breakfast being made. “Breakfast smells great!”<br />
Jane smiled. “Thank you, it’s one of my favorite recipes.” She continued tending to the omelette she was frying. “Do you mind going to get Mike up? I don’t want to accidentally burn one.” Jeff nodded, turning to go back upstairs. <br />
Jeff reached the door to his old room. He knocked, slowly opening the door. “Wakey wakey, time to get up.” Inside, he found all of the things his parents kept in their bedroom, crammed into the much smaller room. It was still well decorated, but more claustrophobic. On the bed laid a shirtless Mike, who looked a brit different than Jeff remembered. He had a bit of a more muscular build - not tremendously, but he now looked more like a man that played football in college instead of golf like he had in the past. He was a bit taller as well, and now sported a neatly trimmed goatee instead of being clean-shaven like usual. Jeff reached down and shook Mike’s arm. “Time to wake up kiddo.” <br />
Mike stirred and grunted, his voice an octave lower than it was yesterday. “Five more minutes dad…” <br />
“Alright, but if you’re not down in five minutes I’m going to add to your chores.” Mike groaned in agreement and Jeff left, closing the e door behind him.<br />
It dawned on Jeff what the deal with Mike had done. Instead of Mike being his dad, Mike was now considered Jeff’s son! But he was still 16, just a tall, masculine, muscular 16 year old… with a 47 year old son…<br />
He started to get confused about how it worked the more he thought about it, and instead decided to go back downstairs for some breakfast. At the table, Jane, how Jeff’s daughter-in-law instead of mother, had placed 3 settings for breakfast. Jeff by default walked to the head of the table, where two large omelettes awaited him, alongside a prepackaged bodybuilding supplement smoothie. After thanking Jane, Jeff began to dig in, eating ravenously as his enormous new body required many more calories than it had before. Jeff noticed that his omelette was filled with lean protein sources, which any bodybuilder would need, and despite that, still tasted like his moms- or rather Jane’s special omelettes that he had always loved. The smoothie he thought was disgusting, but Jeff consumed it with the same amount of fervor that he had the omelettes, seemingly used to the taste and enjoying getting the supplements he needed. <br />
It wasn’t until Jeff had finished eating 15 minutes later that Mike had arrived downstairs, still shirtless and wearing a pair of grey sweatpants. Against his will, Jeff noticed an enlarged package swinging freely from Mike’s crotch, though it was no match for his own meat.<br />
“You’re late, son.” Jeff said with a disappointed tone. Mike sat down with a groan. <br />
“Sorry dad… I think I had one too many last night.” Mike looked at his dad sheepishly. <br />
“I understand, but rules are rules.” Mike gulped, afraid of what his dad would say next. “After you get home from driving me to the gym, I need you to mow the lawn today. Got it?” Mike nodded, relieved that the lawn was the only thing being added to his chores for the day.<br />
“So Jeff, have you been looking into options for getting your own place when you turn 18? I know I asked last month, Mike and I are just excited to help you get out on your own!” Jane said. <br />
Jeff had to think about that. He didn’t know if he had in this reality or not, but as he thought about it, memories of house searching arose in his mind. “I have actually. Found a nice place in the next town over, actually, right next to a bodybuilding gym that was looking to sponsor me. I have an appointment to view it next week and if everything goes right, it’ll be mine the day I turn 18.”<br />
The three of them excitedly discussed the topic for a bit more before Jeff went upstairs to change into his gym clothes. He put on a jockstrap that was just barely large enough to contain his meat and a pair of red spandex shorts, putting his legs and package proudly on display. He then put on a large black stringer tank that was cut low enough for his nipples to be exposed, which caused him to smirk. On top of that he put on a set of matching oversized black sweatpants and sweatshirt that covered his muscle enough to look like just a large man instead of a bodybuilder. He packed his gym shoes and other equipment into a gym bag and sling it over his shoulder. He put a prepackaged lunch from the fridge in the cooler bag inside his gym bag when he got downstairs, then put on his sandals, which he noticed were way larger than before - size 17, up from 8! Mike got into the drivers seat and Jeff the passengers - after all, he hadn’t gotten his lisence yet, and nothing he’d done yet would have changed that. Mike and Jeff made small talk as they drove to the gym. When they arrived, Jeff left the car with a hug for his son and walked into the gym, excited to try out his new body for the first time.</p>
