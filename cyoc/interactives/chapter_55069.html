<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian walked in to the waiting room.<br />
<br />
There were several others waiting filling out some forms and signing <br />
the disclaimers when he got up to the window. Brian rang the bell and <br />
the opaque glass slid open.<br />
<br />
Fill these out was all she said and then slid the door shut again.<br />
<br />
Brian found himself a seat next to this football player type as he <br />
looked around there were no women that had responded. No chicks? Brian <br />
said and nudged the football player guy.<br />
<br />
Guess not he replied. Then looked back at his forms.<br />
<br />
Brian filled out his form and then sat there looking around.<br />
<br />
The door slid open and the lady that had given him the forms called <br />
all the men waiting in the room in. She showed them to a conference <br />
like room and said the Dr. would be with them in a moment.<br />
<br />
Brian and the 8 or so others waited another 15 minutes or so and then <br />
this big man in a white coat walked in and went to the front of the <br />
room.<br />
<br />
So I guess you all are interested in helping with our research. Or was <br />
it just the money?<br />
<br />
Most giggled at that as did Brian since that was their true motive but <br />
the football player guy just looked down.<br />
<br />
Ok so I guess you saw that we have a new product. We have a nice <br />
variety of men here to test them out and if you choose to participate <br />
your payments will start in one week.<br />
<br />
First of all we need you here for the first week. Will that be <br />
inconvenient for anyone? And after that you will be placed in a house <br />
that will monitor your progress and assist you as needed for the rest <br />
of the year. Will that be a problem? This first week you will be put <br />
on a liquid diet to assist in the process.<br />
<br />
No one left. Good!<br />
<br />
Well lets get you all fitted. In walked the nurse and the Dr <br />
instructed everyone to strip. We all stood there somewhat trying to <br />
hide our nakedness as the nurse came around and found the proper fit. <br />
Marked down some stats on her clipboard and then weighed and measured <br />
our height as well as some other statistics.<br />
<br />
When they got to the football player guy it seemed as though the pair <br />
they had for him was the largest they had.<br />
<br />
When we were all dressed in our diapers the Dr. said ok now here is <br />
the start of the liquid diet. They looked like a protein shake and was <br />
about a two litre bottle full. Just go at your own pace. Most of the <br />
boys took awhile but Brian and the football player chugged it in an <br />
almost competition to see who could finish first.<br />
<br />
There was one guy that didn't finish his but then he was a skinny <br />
little thing. The diapers almost fell off of him.<br />
<br />
Ok now you are going to be paired off. Our rooms hold two each so you <br />
will have to have a roommate.<br />
<br />
The football player and Brian were paired off but since that was the <br />
only one he had talked with it was ok. Brian found out his name was <br />
Tom and that he had a problem with his bowels. That was why he was <br />
there. He needed a way to take care of his problem. That must have <br />
been why he had looked down.<br />
<br />
The skinny guy had no roommate and I wished that I had that room but <br />
Tom was a good guy.<br />
<br />
For that week we sat and drank our shakes using the diapers.<br />
<br />
Say doc I am putting on some weight here and so is Tom I said in one <br />
of our daily meetings. I looked around and so were the others.<br />
<br />
Yea this diet does tend to do that for a bit but don't worry about it <br />
this diet will change when you move into your sponsor house.<br />
<br />
It hadn't occurred to me that the skinny guy wasn't at any of the <br />
meetings. When the week ended we were all measured and assigned to a <br />
house. Tom and I had been assigned to the same house but most of the <br />
others had been assigned to a single house. We were told that this <br />
house said they could take two.  Or now this will help you in your <br />
placement houses. The nurse went around and gave everyone a shot. It <br />
made our heads a bit woozy and then the debut of skinny was presented <br />
to us.<br />
<br />
When they got around to the skinny guy he came into the room on shaky <br />
legs. He looked huge. He must have tripled his weight in the last <br />
week. His legs were round and smooth and his belly stuck out. He was <br />
as smooth as a baby and he jiggled. All he said was goo and cooed a <br />
bit.<br />
<br />
He sat down on the floor and started playing with some baby toys like <br />
it was normal and this shot seemed to make me think it was normal as <br />
well.<br />
<br />
When the handlers came they put us in large strollers and pushed us <br />
out to their waiting cars. Tom and Brian were rolled into a large <br />
house where our room had one massive cribs, two high chairs, a play <br />
pen and all sorts of toys to play with. It seemed both odd and right <br />
at the same time.<br />
<br />
Brian found that his voice was going as was Tom's. When they strolled <br />
us in we were too big to be lifted into the cribs so there was a <br />
harness that we were lifted with and placed in our crib. We were given <br />
bottles with our familiar drink with some additions and we sucked it <br />
down as we went to sleep.<br />
<br />
We were big babies</p>
