<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile as Mary went off and did some of her chores about the main house, Jess and her stud stood together in the same corral. Jess felt her body urging her to return as she had to her stallion, she felt the need to be with another of her kind. <br />
<br />
Everything began to slip into a logical progression of a digressing mental state equal to the animal body Jess became. Even as the instinctive thoughts entered her mind, she felt new urges, forgetting the taught morals of the human kind, she grasp then the social ideology of being equine. The last literal act of her changing mind to do something of complete decided forethought, Jess lip nibbled and opening the corral gate, let then the stallion to come and join her in the wide pasture. <br />
<br />
The stallion felt an eagerness to graze where he could only dream of being on the other side of his fenced corral. Jess felt something similar, if not for wishing to graze, her feelings leaned toward reaching beyond the limits of being human, and grasping at the fantasies of becoming as is a horse, mare, and mated by a stallion.<br />
<br />
Jess followed her mate, she watching him, as he began to graze, she lowered her head and tried with thick lips to do the same. Whether it came from her building instincts or the added ramifications coming over her after being bred by a stallion, but Jess marveled in her degrading mind the ease of how she began to graze as if it were always that way.<br />
<br />
A couple of hours went their merry way, as from placid grazing and a fuller feeling in their stomachs, the mare and stallion became sexually aroused, frisky one with the other.<br />
<br />
Later, with her head hung low to the ground in a stance of submission to he mate, Jess then wholly of body and mind was as any other, real born mare. She stood with her hind legs spread apart, offering her stallion a sound rump for him to mount, lean over, and begin the ritual of stallion thrusting and finding.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jess,&quot; Mary yelled, she calling from just beyond the gate to the pasture, seeing hos the two horses out there were locked in their time of passion and lust.<br />
<br />
Yelling for Jess to come to meet her at the pasture gate, once the mating ritual had come to its relaxed ending; Mary yelled, calling the name of her friend, but the mare warily paid much attention to the strange creature making all the loud sounds.<br />
<br />
Somewhere in the then equine mind and memory totally controlling Jess, she felt a faint remembrance of that yelling creature, and thinking a moment of wonder, Jess straining to think, seemed to know of a thing who was kind to her once before.<br />
<br />
Calm acting and very slowly, Jess meandered her grazing to walk closer to where Mary stood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come to me Jess, please stop acting the beleaguered horse and mare act, you know me, as I know you!&quot; Mary said, she gaining a bit of disgust at her friend acting the role of becoming a horse and like some ignorant mare.<br />
<br />
Jess finally raised her head, she slowly sauntering closer to meet this noisy creature, it being of course Mary, but Jess failing to have a working human memory in her horse head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you are getting into the swing of things, and the stallion really has something big to swing,&quot; Mary says, she starting to laugh at her almost pun, yet the laughing causes Jess to perk up her ears, staring at Mary, she reached her head toward Mary and with a wholly equine horse mouth, she let go a screaming whinny.<br />
<br />
Stunned, Mary stopped her laughing, &quot;You can't communicate at all, Jess you let the instincts take full control, you really became now a horse!&quot; Mary said, she horrified at the thought of her helping to doom her best friend into being permanently possibly as for the rest of her life she need be as is a horse and mare.<br />
<br />
Jess stood there acting a bit nervous. As from the pasture came the black stallion, he trotting up and behind of Jess, did stop and with his upper lip curled into a flamen manner, he drank in the scent of his chosen mare.<br />
<br />
Caught between two interesting things, Jess did a side stepping to stand horizontal to the pasture fence.<br />
<br />
Mary thought this as if Jess wanted her friend to have a better examining look of just how perfect a mare horse body Jess then had as if her own.<br />
<br />
Smoothing a hand along the neck to the withers, fondling the base of the full mane, Mary stroked her hand along the spine, coming to taking her index finger and give a friendly poke as the base of what Jess had as her tail.<br />
<br />
The slight poke made nervous Jess jerk and jump; her stallion mate took an immediate offense to this action, he reached his head toward Mary, and tried hard to bite her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dude, cut that out, she was my friend before she became your horny mare! Jess you back me up on this, this..., oh damn Jess, oh no, not again!&quot; Mary stood there bemoaning her friend acting still as if she were just some ignorant common animal.<br />
<br />
The stallion stood near the fence and with his hormones heightened, a simple snuffing snort at the tail of Jess and she took to the proper poise of a mare welcoming her stallion to pleasure them both.<br />
<br />
Mary stood there speechless, studded at what happened then so close in front of her, something she had see on TV, on the Animal Planet channel, but never in person and she being directly beside two big animals in the act of breeding.<br />
<br />
A huffing stallion standing almost in a upright stance, his huge male organ jammed inside of Jess, he rutting it, seeking some realization of mutual pleasuring. Buried to his sheath lips inside his mare, he worked his maleness in long in and out stroking movements. Suctioning sounds coming from the tight working piston in a leathery vaginal sleeve, the brutal movements made both mare and her stud to give off rippling big farts.<br />
<br />
Stinking farts trailed to the nose of Mary, she tried to cover her nose and hold her breath, but mesmerized as she was for seeing two horses in the brutal act of mating, and she being so close, Mary stood there and said nothing. <br />
<br />
Seeing the stallion begin to slow his pelvic thrusting, Mary took a step forward and stopping, she knelt down to get a much different view of this sort of ritual.<br />
<br />
Likely from the sensation of yet another, her forth gained load of stallion semen of that first equine day in her life, Jess raised her head, turned and looked back and down at the crouching creature on the other side to the pasture fence.<br />
<br />
The stallion too cocked his head and with a soft appreciative sort of a whinny, his stance stiffened as from out of his inserted male member roared another load inside of Jess. So much was inside her, the new load had nowhere to go but to seek out, and streaming past the black vulva lips of Jess, the thick juices, stringy flow, did spray and splatter Mary all over her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuck,&quot; Mary said in that instantaneous blast of male and female equine bodily fluids, it struck Mary by plastering her in the face, down her neck, and all over the top of her blouse. Her verbal response only added to the vile situation. Speaking a quick word in response, Mary with mouth open did get some of what the Stallion ejaculated past then her oral lips.<br />
<br />
Too late, Mary turned her head away, but with a last big spurt from the stallion and inside of Jess, the spewing spurt forth another jetting spray of mating juices. This near wall of juicy stuff hit Mary in the back of her head, coating her long brunette hair in white and sticky stuff.<br />
<br />
Eyes closed and with hands trying desperately to clean away the slime from off her face, Mary fell face down on the grassy lawn. Rolling over on her back, Mary pulled the lower tails of her blouse out of her jeans and with sticky hands she used the still clean and dry cloth ends to clean away the semen from covering her eyes. Once able to see again where she could go, Mary ran for the water lawn watering hose, turning it on, she stood dousing her head in cold water, thinning the clinging semen from her hair, top of her head, and face.<br />
<br />
Working feverishly at cleaning herself, Mary gave a reminded look toward Jess and the stallion.<br />
<br />
Maybe this what she should have expected, as with Jess drinking the full vial dry, she would become as is a mare, completely, and that likely of body and in mindset.<br />
<br />
Feeling sad and quite responsible, she first thought to allow Jess the time, days or weeks, months or even years of living as is a mare. The thought of this had yet a reminder, the parents of Jess, she living at home, they there would be expecting her to return home. How could Mary explain she doomed her friend to be as is a mare? She knew she was in for some big trouble, with finishing her cleansing off of the sticky yuck'o, Mary got up, walked to the pasture fence and tried again to talk with her changed friend.</p>
