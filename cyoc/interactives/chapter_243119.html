<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lesily turned to the enormous board, now glowing with new results. The audience waited in breathless anticipation. As the results flashed up, a cartoonish rendering of two college guys in their mid twenties with the title below it. It says...<br />
<br />
(Diffuse Both: Quadruplet 12 year olds)<br />
<br />
Lesily looked to that and was intrigued by it. &quot;Got a taste for diffusing have you? I can&#39;t blame you, it&#39;s amazing to see the many facets of a person fully expressed without being balanced out by another side. Let&#39;s give this one another go, shall we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Approaching Dan and Dex on stage and asked them, &quot;Dan & Dex? Can you both hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan and Dex remained in a trance and both responded with, &quot;Yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Dan & Dex, when I snap my fingers, you both will diffuse one more time into two people each of you. Any traits, characteristics, and physics will be divided into those two people. You both will have two new identities, but all four of you will be quadruplet brothers who are on the verge of starting puberty, each with their own path that you&#39;re interested in pursuing ahead of you, but all four of you are bonded by blood. Are you two ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan & Dex simply nodded as he said, &quot;Yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s all she needed to hear as she stepped away and got her fingers ready to snap. &quot;Great! Now...let the diffusion commence.&quot;<br />
<br />
-snap-<br />
<br />
The moment she snapped her fingers, Dan & Dex&#39;s bodies started to tingle. She and the audience watched as they watched as the twins’ bodies began to glow brighter and brighter, their adult frames were melting away like ice cream under a heat lamp. All muscles and fat deteriorated away as arms and legs became jelly before absorbing into the increasing mass. Body hair, nipples, and belly buttons started to assimilate into the melting body as their penis and balls started to suck right into the blob. Their heads were loosing facial features and hairline as the head itself merged with the mass. What was Dan & Dex  now were two fleshy blobs on stage, but that&#39;s just the start of the changes.<br />
<br />
Slowly, the two blobs rippled before splitting into two smaller blobs each, creating four smaller blobs that then started to grow and take shape. Slowly, stumps of both arms and legs grew as hands, fingers, feet, and toes formed at the ends. Heads popped up like huge zits and took shape as facial features grew in. Lesily and the audience could see that four boys half of Dan & Dex&#39;s ages were being created, however, they all took on different looks.<br />
<br />
From Dan&#39;s blob grew up two boys, one wearing a football jersey above gym shorts, wearing knee high socks over shin guards and with cleats tied together by their laces and hanging around his neck. His brown hair was just a tad bit long, enough to eat away at the tops of his ears and have his bangs fall messily on top of his eyes. Clearly this boy was Dan&#39;s athleticism given an age appropriate drive.<br />
<br />
The other Dan blob grew to have ripped jeans, long hair to his shoulders, temporary tattoos up and down his arms, and well-worn sneakers that looked beaten up. The boy pulled out a pocket knife and a piece of wood and began to whittle away. Lastly there was a challenging and sly look to his eyes, and Lesily figured out that diffusing Dan further had release Dave&#39;s sly and wild side.<br />
<br />
From Dex&#39;s blob grew up two other boys, one was dressed in a neatly arranged polo shirt and boy shorts. His Sandy brown hair was neat and tidy, with a side part and gelled hair giving him a 1950&#39;s good boy appearance. All of this was matched with an innocent boyish grin that seemed genuinely curious and happy. Clearly this was Dave&#39;s well-behaved side.<br />
<br />
From Dex&#39;s other blob grew up a twelve year old boy with sandy brown hair who crossed his arms over his average looking t-shirt and jeans. Just by meeting his rolling eyes, Lesily could immediately tell that this boy was definitely the most intelligent one, but also the most bored and unimpressed with everything as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, are you going to ask us our names or are you waiting for an engraved invitation?&quot; asked the unimpressed twelve year old that had split from Dex. And clearly the one most likely to complain as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clever, Damian,&quot; commented the twelve year old boy with a pocket knife.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t asking for your opinion, Derek,&quot; retorted Damian back at the boy with the knife.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m free to give my opinion, whether you like it or not,&quot; said Derek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we not fight, for one minute?&quot; asked the well-behaved boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, Dennis!&quot; yelled both Damian and Derek before they returned towards antagonizing each other.<br />
<br />
Dennis, the well-behaved boy looked as though he wanted to say something before standing still in shock as both boys continued to argue. Dennis soon clamped his hands over his ears and then sat down where he was on the stage, rocking back and forth on stage while pressing his hands firmly against his ears. As soon as he did this, he was quickly joined by the fourth boy, who sat next to Dennis and quietly put an arm around him. This seemed to calm Dennis down who then went from holding his hands against his ears to hugging his brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;And since we got everyone else&#39;s name, who might you be?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Devin,&quot; said the athletic boy with a curt but polite nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it seems you look out for Dennis over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone has to. He&#39;s always been a bit sensitive to fighting...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a fan of it?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Damian and Derek both love to argue and play fight--they&#39;ll look for any excuse to start a fight--but it all means nothing. Dennis though, well, he hasn&#39;t figured it out yet that it&#39;s all an act, and when he gets too upset he then tries to interfere and break up the fight himself and ends up getting all three of them hurt by actually trying to fight,&quot; explained Devin.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you like to do when you&#39;re not being your brothers&#39; keeper?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m really dedicated to Football, as you might see. I wanna be an athlete when I grow up, I don&#39;t know in what yet, I&#39;ve tried baseball, basketball, rugby, cricket, and now football.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like you&#39;re both a coach&#39;s dream and nightmare,&quot; said Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda... I guess,&quot; said Devin.<br />
<br />
Lesily brought her crystal back out and put all four boys back into a trance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, folks, there you have it. One man, divided into four boys. Now, while these four boys may be fun as they are, is there anything else you want to do to them?&quot; asked Lesily.</p>
