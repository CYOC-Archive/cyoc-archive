<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You're wanting to take my cubs from me?&quot; Gary asked puzzled, but still hurting on the inside as he noticed Penny's eyes beginning mist up.<br />
<br />
&quot;They need a mother figure, Gary,&quot; Penny said weakly, &quot;I owe it to Fox to try... and we are not stealing them from you. I know you love Tano, Sita, Saba, and Nane. I know that Fox was your Prime Mate, but she was my best friend. I have to do it for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not like we want to take them out of your life,&quot; Kirk spoke up, &quot;I'm sure we could even arrange something that you could come along as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd be a third wheel for you too,&quot; Gary commented, &quot;I can't do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd still be more then welcome to visit and to be in their lives,&quot; Penny spoke, taking Gary's paw, &quot;you are their father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't lose them, Penny,&quot; Gary said weakly, &quot;they're my last reminders of Fox...&quot; he sniffled... &quot;I loved her so much...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We all now,&quot; Penny nodded, &quot;I was her maid of honor... and... and... and I wanted her to be mine when Kirk and I get married.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gary nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I owe it to Fox to give them a mother figure,&quot; Penny said weakly, &quot;and Kirk and I do want you involved in lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is likely to create the oddest family life ever,&quot; Gary told her, &quot;You raising my cubs with me only as a visitor...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only other option would be for you to take a new Prime Mate as soon as we can all walk again, and given how much you loved Fox, that will never happen,&quot; Penny replied.<br />
<br />
Gary slowly nodded. It would be quite awhile before he even considered dating again... but he didn't want to lose his daughters... At the same time, he also knew that Penny had a point. Tano, Sita, Saba, and Nane would grow up to be lionesses, they would need a lioness to raise them. Teach them how to hunt.<br />
<br />
It was the problem of what had happened in relation to the battle with Kurse. It made Gary want to switch places with Fox. A good part of him felt that if Fox could be in his place and he would willingly take hers. His daughters would have their mother and everything would get better eventually. It was a thought that soldiers in war commonly had, and might give Gary some similarities with Mr. P in a sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not fair,&quot; Gary said after a few moments, with nothing else to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Penny sniffled heavily, &quot;I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny then leaned her head into Kirk's side and cried for the loss of a friend as she found herself breaking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll promise I can visit them?&quot; Gary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We expect you to visit them,&quot; Kirk answered, &quot;you're their father.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Carl Williams was quiet he swept out a corner of Glendale's Fire Department. Dead tired from a long shift, he had missed the effects of Kurse's actions almost completely, and he was sure the other Fire Department officers were the same. He didn't really know about those that did the night shift.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Carl,&quot; a voice spoke to him. &quot;Morning,&quot; a second voice added as well.<br />
<br />
Carl then turned to see a snow white male lupman, with no highlights in his fur, and was no relation to Lawrence or Betty. Beside him was a grayish white leoman male with a white mane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Frank,&quot; Carl addressed the lupman, and then to the leoman, &quot;Chad.&quot;<br />
<br />
These were his friends. He and Frank were fairly close, but he always seemed to be busy with his wives or worried about his daughters. Carl and Chad, however, were like brothers, even if not actually related. Carl remembered all the fun times he and Chad had had as kids. Chad would push him on the swings in the vain attempt many kids have to try and go over he top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our family had some great news last night,&quot; Chad said proudly, &quot;You remember Trevor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor?&quot; Carl asked as his clothing vanished, &quot;wasn't he the cub you said supposedly committed suicide?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad nodded as brass colored fur began to cover Carl, &quot;Yes, but it turns out that was false. He was threatened by someone, but some old lady saved him. He's alive, he called my son to say that he was back with the Pride again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carl barely noticed a silver colored mane beginning to circle around his head and neck, and rounding ears. As retractable claws replaced his finger nails, Carl nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's wonderful,&quot; Carl spoke as his tail grew out behind him and swished slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Chad smiled, as Carl's muzzle grew and filled the sharp teeth of lion, &quot;it really made my son's day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How's Marsha?&quot; Frank asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Recovering,&quot; Carl answered, &quot;With baby Jill with her. She is so sweet looking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does she need to see Beta Julie?&quot; Frank asked, &quot;I mean a leoman, human hybrid has to be bigger then a normal human infant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Carl gave a half joke, &quot;I fit in her just fine. The birth was no more painful then normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Frank nodded, &quot;just making sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three then continued with their work, Carl not knowing that when he returned home he would inevitably transform his wife and infant daughter into leomen.<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Katherine's family had the resources to get them to Glendale?&quot; Lilly asked.<br />
<br />
Marie nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn't she have used that to get Marie to accept her?&quot; Lilly then asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She could have, but didn't,&quot; Marie answered, &quot;the wealth of her family wasn't that much of a concern for Katherine. She wanted to come because she was Marie's friend. It is just that her family's wealth would help once Marie accepted her help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did she persuade her?&quot; Lawrence asked.<br />
<br />
Marie was about to continue when she heard two more new voices speak from behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marie! What are you doing here?&quot; came Abbey's voice, &quot;shouldn't you be with your mother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha!&quot; came Alice's voice, &quot;Here you are!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I'm here,&quot; Samantha answered as her sister/cousins rushed up and hugged her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Alice questioned, &quot;you were not with us when we woke up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You kinda collapsed on me when you came back,&quot; Samantha licked Alice's cheek, &quot;but I'm alright. I've been listening to Marie's story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't you be with your mother, Marie?&quot; Abbey asked, &quot;won't she miss you if you're here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I sensed the feelings of confusion as reality altered around your brothers and sisters and friends at the manor,&quot; Marie spoke, &quot;and since Amy wasn't here, I thought I'd help... but mostly I was here to apologize to your sister for what Kurse did to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said, I should be apologizing to you,&quot; Samantha spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still felt I should apologize,&quot; Marie said, &quot;anyway, Samantha was asleep when I arrived, so I lent my paw to help the others and met Mr. Lawrence, Ms. Betty, and Cassandra and Lilly. I have been telling the story of how the witches went from quite innocent little girls to insane and evil witches. You're more then welcome to stay and listen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice and Abbey traded glances as they were both concerned about their sister. They didn't want such a story to hurt her after all she had been through.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm alright, sisters,&quot; Samantha told them, &quot;truly I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose we can listen,&quot; Alice spoke, &quot;but if something troubles Samantha in the least, we will take her back to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie nodded, &quot;Let me catch you up on how far we've gotten so far. It won't be in exact detail, but it'll give you the gist of everything.&quot;</p>
