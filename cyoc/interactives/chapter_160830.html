<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dried off and sitting on the bed in his pajamas, Michael waited for Chris to come back into the bedroom. As he waited patiently, he could hear Buddy whining from the floor below him. <br />
<br />
“Man” Freddy thought to himself, as he continued to whine. “I can’t believe I’m relegated to sleeping on the floor like Michael’s pet. I really don’t want to have to do this for more than one night. I hope Sofya’s amnesia spell or whatever gives us enough time to try to get the ring back from the mayor. Once it wears off, it’ll be that much harder to try to get it back again. I really hope Michael has a plan for this.”<br />
<br />
“Why are you whining, Freddy?” Michael asked, as he called to Buddy from the bed.<br />
<br />
“Wouldn’t you like to know?” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy let out a loud bark. <br />
<br />
“You’re not going to be making all that noise while we’re trying to sleep, are you Freddy?”<br />
<br />
“No” Freddy thought to himself, as he shook his head “but I ought to. Why won’t you just let me up on the bed with you and Chris? What’s the big deal if I shed a little fur?”<br />
<br />
In that moment, Chris came back into the bedroom, wearing another tight fitting pair of pajamas. <br />
<br />
“Are you sure you’re buying the right size clothes for your frame?” Michael asked, as Chris made his way onto the bed. <br />
<br />
“They probably shrunk in the wash” Chris replied, as he settled into the bed with Michael. <br />
<br />
The two of them laid on the opposite ends of the bed. Michael doused the overhead light, as he sat for a moment in silence. Before Chris could settle in to pass out, Michael called out to him.<br />
<br />
“Chris” he whispered.<br />
<br />
“Huh?” Chris replied. “What is, Mr. Scavolini?”<br />
<br />
“I want to talk. Would you mind staying up?”<br />
<br />
“Oh for Christ sake” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy whined loudly. <br />
<br />
“Sure” Chris replied. <br />
<br />
Buddy put his paws over his eyes and let out another loud whine. <br />
<br />
“Easy boy” Chris said, as he turned back on the overhead lights. <br />
<br />
“You don’t have to have the lights on” Michael said, as he shut them off again. “I’d feel better if I don’t see you while I’m talking. Less chance for me to feel nervous and clam up.”<br />
<br />
“If you say so.”<br />
<br />
A moment of silence passed them by, before Michael spoke up.<br />
<br />
“I wanted to talk about my feelings, if you don’t mind.”<br />
<br />
“Mr. Scavolini, can I ask you something?” Chris asked. <br />
<br />
“Sure…I guess.”<br />
<br />
Chris sighed, as he turned to look at Michael. <br />
<br />
“Look” he continued “I know you still have your reservations about me and all of that stuff, but I kind of wanted you to ease up a bit on the formality. It’s driving me nuts continuing to call you ‘Mr Scavolini’ like you’re my friend’s dad and not my contemporary. We went to school together. I’d like to drop the title, if you don’t mind.”<br />
<br />
“I mean” Michael replied, as he turned to look at Chris “in fairness, you did ask me what I preferred to be called.”<br />
<br />
“I know, but it’s driving me a bit nuts, especially with all the stress we’re dealing with at the moment. I’ve rarely dealt with anything this dangerous before in my entire life and I served our country for four years. Cop work was never this stressful, as bad as it could get sometimes. Just in the past few days, wee’ve faced a string of assassins, a psychotic mayor hell bent on keeping power, a magic ring, your husband turned into a dog, your son targeted by my former fellow officers and who knows what else is coming down the pipeline. <br />
<br />
“My point is, I want to to try to ease myself up a bit. I’ll keep referring to you as your title, if that’s what you prefer. However, I would like it if I could go back to calling you Michael again, if you don’t mind me doing so.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll think about” Michael replied shortly. <br />
<br />
“Just a thought. No need to get testy with me.”<br />
<br />
“Am I getting testy though?”<br />
<br />
Chris sighed, before he confessed his true feelings.<br />
<br />
“I think so and I’m sure Freddy does too. Right Freddy?”<br />
<br />
“You’re telling me” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy nodded his head in agreement from the floor.<br />
<br />
“See?” Chris said. “Your husband agrees with me.”<br />
<br />
“I’m just under a lot of stress right now” Michael replied. <br />
<br />
“I am too.”<br />
<br />
“We all are” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy let out a loud bark.<br />
<br />
“So maybe we can try to loosen some of those rules of yours a bit” Chris continued. “For example, the intimacy thing. You went in for a hug today, which I’m assuming means you’re ok with relaxing the touching guidelines.”<br />
<br />
Michael blushed, but Chris couldn’t see it in the dark. <br />
<br />
“That was an accident” Michael replied. “I just kind of got overwhelmed in the moment, that’s all.”<br />
<br />
“It’s ok, Michael. You don’t have to make excuses for it. I get it.”<br />
<br />
Chris moved over from his end of the bed to get closer to Michael.<br />
<br />
“I liked it too” he confessed. “It was a nice release of emotional stress. It’s not good to keep all that stuff pent up like that. Hugs are a good way to release it all and let it go.”<br />
<br />
Michael nodded, as Chris looked at him deeply in the eyes. <br />
<br />
“It’s not a sexual thing at all, Michael. Guys who are in touch with their feelings do this all the time. I used to do it with my buddies in the army and none of us were going around fucking each other afterwards. We just saw a lot in combat and needed to let out our pain. It was purely platonic. Nothing wrong that.”<br />
<br />
“I just get all worked up about it for a couple of reasons” Michael admitted.<br />
<br />
“Such as?”<br />
<br />
“For starters, how much my husband gets such a reaction out of you.”<br />
<br />
Buddy’s ears perked up, as he heard himself being referenced. <br />
<br />
“I totally get it” Chris replied. “I kind of suspected it when I first saw him gawking at my hairy chest that first day I made breakfast. I figured the reason you didn’t want me to make it anymore was because of that.”<br />
<br />
“That had nothing to do with it, actually” Michael replied honestly. “I just like doing things my way in the kitchen. I was also a little bit jealous that you were getting so much praise for it.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, well, I thought it was because you were mad at your husband ogling me that first morning. I mean, you did get into that argument with him about it afterwards.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, what?”<br />
<br />
Michael turned on the overhead lights and sat up in the bed. <br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” Michael asked nervously. <br />
<br />
“I overheard you guys talking about it in the kitchen” Chris confessed. “You two were arguing—”<br />
<br />
“Wait, you overhead my argument to Freddy about the rules?”<br />
<br />
“I did.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh! Chris! I don’t like you listening in to my private conversations like that.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, Michael. I just happened to be coming down to get Evan a drink and happened to overhear what you guys were talking about. That’s when I got the idea to tell Evan to tell you how much you meant to him. I was trying to ease the tensions in the household and use my positive influence on your son to get him to show his dad and papa his appreciation more often. Besides, it’s not like you don’t snoop on other people’s conversations in this house.”<br />
<br />
“Arf?” Buddy whined.<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about, Chris?” Michael asked with an irritated tone in his voice. “I don’t snoop on other people’s conversations.”<br />
<br />
“Of course you do” Chris replied, as he sat up in the bed and started at Michael. “I heard you outside the door when Freddy and I were having our private conversation the other day.”<br />
<br />
“Arf?” Buddy whined again.<br />
<br />
“I was not!” Michael shrieked. <br />
<br />
“You were too” Chris replied. “I heard your footsteps outside the door as we were talking.”<br />
<br />
“I guess as much as I noticed you watching me give Freddy head this morning, huh Chris?” Michael retorted with a snort. <br />
<br />
Buddy got up from his spot on the floor and walked closer to Michael on the bed. <br />
<br />
“Heh” Chris chuckled. “I thought I was being discrete.”<br />
<br />
“You got up way too quickly after Freddy shook you awake. You made a suggestion that you would ‘give us alone time’ when I offered to make breakfast this morning. I knew I saw you watching us and I knew you weren’t really asleep. I told Freddy it was a bad idea to do it while you were still laying next to us, but I didn’t want to him to touch you, so I did it begrudgingly.”<br />
<br />
Buddy whimpered, as he looked up at Michael solemnly. <br />
<br />
“I didn’t want to say anything” Chris replied honestly “as I didn’t want to make it uncomfortable for you guys. But yes, I caught you giving Freddy head this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Ugh. I knew it. I knew it was a bad idea.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not a big deal. In hindsight, I should have just coughed to let you know I was awake.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy didn’t want to say anything to you because he didn’t want you seeing his erection this morning.”<br />
<br />
“I mean, if we’re going to share a bed together, morning wood happens. I get it constantly and I’m sure you do too, Michael. It’s natural. Guys just deal with it.”<br />
<br />
“Your body hair was turning him on. That’s why I should have just turned down the heat last night.”<br />
<br />
Michael sighed, as Chris got up close to his face. <br />
<br />
“Listen” Chris said to him quietly. “The past is the past. Let’s just move on from all of this and try to get some sleep.”<br />
<br />
“You remind me of my dad” Michael blurted out. <br />
<br />
Chris stared silently for a moment, as Michael began to blink out tears from his eyes. <br />
<br />
“What?” Chris asked curiously. <br />
<br />
“There, I said it. Part of the reason I’ve been having such a hard time adjusting to you living in my house is because you remind me too much of my dad. You have a similar build, even if your face looks very different from his and you’re a bit beefier. You have a similar background, Italian American jock. You’re both really hairy sons of bitches. You might arguably be even hairier than my dad was. It’s just making things difficult for me and it&#39;s bringing up a lot of memories, both good and bad. <br />
<br />
“My dad loved me very much, but he could also be a real fucking dick sometimes. He was raised catholic and did things that really hurt me when it came to my relationship with Freddy. Seeing you here in my bed reminds me of my dad. He loved me, but he also hurt me too. That’s why I get afraid when I’m with you, Chris. <br />
<br />
“In high school, you hurt me a lot. You denigrated me, said I wasn’t good enough for your ‘bud’ Freddy, put me down, picked on me and treated me like shit. But like my dad, you also have your good qualities too. You’re thoughtful, caring and kind. You’re a good listener and someone who knows how to give practical advice. I may be infinity more intelligent than you are—”<br />
<br />
“Gee, thanks Michael” Chis replied sarcastically. <br />
<br />
“But what you lack in book smarts, you make up for in street smarts. You’re a guy who has been around the block. You just have a way of knowing how to deal with people and knowing how to reach people who otherwise can’t be reached. You’ve gotten my son to open up in a way Freddy and I have never been able to ourselves. Maybe it’s because he needs a manly presence like yours in his life or maybe it’s because he likes girls like you do. We’re gay, so we can’t really talk to him about that kind of stuff.<br />
<br />
“Whatever it is, you’ve really helped him out the last few days. Even if it’s only been for a short period of time, your presence in his life has already made a tremendous difference. If you weren’t here with us right now, I don’t think Evan would be able to handle all of this stuff as well as he has. You’re a good role model for him, Chris. When this is all over, presuming we survive this—“<br />
<br />
“Survive this?” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy barked three times. <br />
<br />
“Easy Freddy” Chris said calmly. “As you were saying, Michael.”<br />
<br />
“As I was saying” Michael continued, giving Buddy a dirty look “if we get through this, I want you to be a presence my son’s life, even if it’s just on an occasional basis.”<br />
<br />
“I’d be honored to” Chris replied honestly. “I’ve really taken a liking to your son, Evan. He’s a great kid and I’m sure, if I can have some more alone time with him, that I can get him to open up to me more and we can help sort out his problems. But putting all that aside, I want you to know that, even if I may kind of look like your father and even though I was a bully to you in high school, I want you to know that I’m not that nasty kid anymore.<br />
<br />
“Unlike your dad, I didn’t grow up in a religious household. He grew up in a different time than us. People weren’t as accepting of gays then as they are now. My parents attended church when they were kids, but they gave that up before I was born. Being the oldest of three boys, I was always the adult in the room with my siblings, but we never felt short on love. <br />
<br />
“My father was affectionate with me, like you say your dad was to you. I guess it’s the Italian in us, but he was very touchy feely with me. He didn’t mind kissing me or giving me tight hugs. He still kisses me, even though we are both grown men now. I’m not ashamed of it and I think it makes for a healthy bond among men. <br />
<br />
“It’s not weak or girly to want to be open about your feelings with people. I love that you felt comfortable enough tonight to tell me how you were feeling. I want you to know that unlike your dad, I support you and Freddy in your relationship. I think you make a wonderful couple and I am totally happy to say that I support you guys 100%.”<br />
<br />
Michael began to sob, as Chris looked at him sympathetically. <br />
<br />
“Michael?”<br />
<br />
“Yes” Michael replied, as he let out a sniffle. <br />
<br />
“Can I give you a hug?”<br />
<br />
Michael nodded, as Chris leaned over to tightly embrace him. There was nothing sexual between them in that moment. It was just a long, overdue release of emotion. Michael ignored the uncomfortable feeling of Chris’ bushy black beard on his shoulder. He cried into his husband’s bodyguard’s shoulder and released the pain he was feeling inside of him. Chris patted him on the back, while Buddy whimpered from the floor. The bully became the comforter in that moment.<br />
<br />
When they were done, Michael pushed Chris back gently and laid back down on the bed. <br />
<br />
“Thank you for that” Michael said. “That really helped me a lot. It’s nice to know I can come to you if I need to talk about these things.”<br />
<br />
Chris nodded and yawned loudly.<br />
<br />
“Are you tired?” Chris asked groggily, as he laid down on his back.<br />
<br />
Michael nodded quietly. <br />
<br />
“So I have to ask you something before we go to sleep” he continued. <br />
<br />
“What is it, Chris?”<br />
<br />
“What do you want to do about the room temperature?”<br />
<br />
Michael was confused for a moment, before he knew what Chris was referring to. <br />
<br />
“Oh” Michael replied.<br />
<br />
“Do you want to keep the temperature as it is?” Chris asked. “Or should I take off my shirt?”<br />
<br />
Michael thought for a moment, before he made a decision.<br />
<br />
“You can take off your shirt” he begrudgingly answered. “I like the temperature as it is now.”<br />
<br />
Chris nodded, as he sat up on the bed and tossed his shirt on the floor. Buddy, curious to take in Chris’ smell from his clothing, got up and walked over to smell it.<br />
<br />
“He seems to like it” Chris said with a smile, as he settled back down into the bed, noticing himself rubbing up against Michael. “Am I too close to you now?”<br />
<br />
Michael could see the forest of fur on Chris’ chest, but his vision was obscured by the darkness. <br />
<br />
“Kind of” Michael replied quietly. <br />
<br />
Chris nodded, as he scooted towards the other side of the bed. <br />
<br />
“Wait” Michael said suddenly. <br />
<br />
Chris stopped moving and looked at Michael directly. <br />
<br />
“I’m a side sleeper” Michael replied. “I know this may not be appropriate to ask you, but would you mind cuddling me from behind, please?”<br />
<br />
Chris looked at him nervously, as he hesitated to move towards him. Buddy looked up from sniffing Chris’ shirt and stared at Michael closely.<br />
<br />
“I just miss Freddy being able to hold me in his arms” Michael confessed “and I feel I need to be held in order to go to sleep. Please Chris. Please hold me.”<br />
<br />
Buddy cocked his head, while Chris sat on the other side of the bed for a moment. Giving up hope after a time, Michael settled onto his side and let a tear roll from his eye. Whimpering, Buddy moved from the shirt on the floor and made his way to Michael&#39;s side of the bed. Hopping up, Buddy licked the tears off of Michael’s face. <br />
<br />
“Stop that” Michael said, squirming as Buddy ignored his attempts to stop licking him.<br />
<br />
“I wish I could tell him that everything is going to be ok” Freddy thought to himself. “I wish I could talk to him now to tell him I love him.”<br />
<br />
Noticing Michael beginning to get sleepy, Buddy hopped off the bed and settled onto the floor by his side. Before he began to pass out, Michael could feel the bed sag next to him. In an instant, he could feel Chris hairy chest rubbing up against the back of his t-shirt. <br />
<br />
“I’ll hold you” Chris whispered into Michael’s ear. “Now go to sleep. It’s really late.”<br />
<br />
Buddy felt a sense of relief, knowing that Michael would be ok. Feeling exhausted himself, Buddy settled onto the floor before trying to go to sleep. An hour or so passed, before Michael stirred awake from his slumber. He could feel something poking at his butt. At first, he thought it was Freddy’s morning wood, until he remembered that Freddy was Buddy. He freaked out, knowing whose boner he was feeling on his backside.<br />
<br />
As Michael came to, he felt Chris’ beard on his neck and his hairy arms tightly wrapped around his chest. He didn’t want to wake his sleeping partner, but felt uncomfortable in this moment. Unlike his father’s encounters with Barry all those years ago, Michael did not just accept this. Tapping Chris’ hairy arm, Michael quietly whispered to him.<br />
<br />
“Psst, Chris” Michael whispered. <br />
<br />
Jostling awake, Buddy’s ears perked up.<br />
<br />
“Psst. Chris.”<br />
<br />
“Mmmmm” Chris moaned in his sleep, as he held onto Michael tighter. <br />
<br />
“Psst. Chris.”<br />
<br />
“Huh? Michael, go back to sleep.”<br />
<br />
“I can’t sleep. Your penis is jamming into my ass.”<br />
<br />
Chris stirred awake and looked down at his pajama bottoms. He immediately felt his boner poking into Michael’s perky butt. He started to blush, as he pulled himself away from his embrace. <br />
<br />
“Oops” Chris said with an embarrassed tone in his voice. “I apologize for that. I don’t know how that happened.”<br />
<br />
Buddy whined, as he stood up on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Maybe you were having a weird sex dream” Michael replied, as he reached out to pet Buddy. <br />
<br />
Chris gulped, as he hesitated to move any further. He was having a lot of mixed feelings in that moment. He was embarrassed that he stuck his boner at his boss’ husband’s ass like that. He was ashamed that he even had gotten a boner, as he did not have a sex dream, as far as he could remember. He also didn’t want to admit that, a part of him liked doing it. He wasn’t sure how to broach this topic with Michael, so he laid silently in the bed. <br />
<br />
“Chris?” Michael asked quietly, as Buddy continued to stare at him.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm?” Chris moaned quietly. <br />
<br />
“Are you ok?”<br />
<br />
Chris paused for a moment, unsure of how to answer this question. He had a mix of feelings in that moment, but they weren’t all necessarily bad. Regardless of the emotion, though, he didn’t feel “ok” in that moment. <br />
<br />
“No” Chris quietly admitted. <br />
<br />
“What’s wrong?” Michael asked, as he turned to face him in the bed. <br />
<br />
The odor off of Chris’ ripe armpits wafted into his nose. Michael coughed for a moment, as he tried to compose himself in his bed partner’s presence. <br />
<br />
“Uh…” Chris stuttered out. <br />
<br />
Michael patiently sat and watched Chris, who was fighting to say the right words to describe how he was feeling in that moment. After coming up with an answer he felt comfortable sharing, Chris finally spoke up.<br />
<br />
“I know you’re going to freak out with this admission I’m about to make” he said.<br />
<br />
“Uh…” Michael replied nervously. “What is it?”<br />
<br />
Chris sighed, as he sat up and turned on the overhead light. Buddy whined, as he struggled to get used to the brights lights shining into the bedroom. <br />
<br />
“I have a confession to make” Chris said, as he looked at Michael sitting up in the bed. “Please don’t be mad at me when I say this to you.”<br />
<br />
“Uh oh” Michael mumbled. “What is it?”<br />
<br />
Michael had a strange feeling he knew what Chris was about to tell him. The lustful eyes watching him giving Freddy a blowjob and the poking at his butt gave him a strong hint as to what it was. Buddy watched closely as well, wondering what Chris was about to confess. <br />
<br />
“You see” Chris continued nervously “although I’ve told you that I’m ‘straight,’ I’ve kind of come to the discovery recently that I’m not totally comfortable with that label.”<br />
<br />
“Arf?” Buddy whined. <br />
<br />
“Uh….” Michael uttered out as a reply.<br />
<br />
“I mean” Chris corrected “I still consider myself to be ‘mostly straight.’ I still like women and I still want to be in a long term relationship with another woman someday soon. However, as I’ve been spending more time with you and Freddy, I’ve kind of been coming to a belated realization about myself.”<br />
<br />
“What kind of realization, Chris?”<br />
<br />
“Michael, I guess I’m not 100% straight. I’m kind of like, maybe 10% bicurious.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.”<br />
<br />
“And I have to admit to something else too.”<br />
<br />
“Oh? What is it?”<br />
<br />
“Well, you know I’ve been telling you that Freddy gawking at my hairy body kind of freaks me out, right?”<br />
<br />
Buddy whined, as Michael nodded his head.<br />
<br />
“Well, I guess it’s not because I’m a straight man being gawked at by a gay one. It’s because I don’t actually find Freddy attractive.”<br />
<br />
“That’s a relief.”<br />
<br />
“It’s because I actually find you attractive, Michael.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
Buddy barked loudly, as he stood back from the bed. <br />
<br />
“What the hell?” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy began to shake nervously.<br />
<br />
“Uh…..” Michael let out nervously. “What?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Michael” Chris admitted honestly. “It’s true. The reason I’ve been giving your husband such a hard time and have been trying so hard to ingratiate myself to you is because I secretly kind of have the hots for you.”<br />
<br />
“Oh god.”<br />
<br />
Buddy continued to bark, as Michael got up to sit on the floor. Buddy came over to him and shimmied his body around him. Scooting to Michael’s side of the bed, Chris sat up and looked down at Michael sitting on the floor below him. Buddy continued to move himself into Michael’s peripheral, as his husband nervously pet his fur. <br />
<br />
“Michael” Chris said hesitantly. “I’m sorry I confessed that to you just now. I should have kept it to myself.”<br />
<br />
Michael ignored Chris’ comment, while Buddy nudged his face into Michael’s. <br />
<br />
“I’m going to go downstairs now.”<br />
<br />
Buddy growled, as he looked up at Chris, not wanting him to leave.<br />
<br />
“Seriously, Freddy?” Chris asked.<br />
<br />
Buddy aggressively nodded his head. <br />
<br />
“Don’t move” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy stared at him intensely. <br />
<br />
“It’s ok, Freddy” Michael said quietly. “Let him go.”<br />
<br />
Chris tried to move off the bed again, but Freddy growled louder this time.<br />
<br />
“I really don’t think I should stay here” Chris said. “I think it’s best that I go back downstairs to the sofa bed now.”<br />
<br />
As Chris made his way off the bed, Buddy ran over and blocked the door. He barked loudly multiple times, as Chris froze in place. <br />
<br />
“What the hell, Freddy?” Michael asked with an irritated tone in his voice.<br />
<br />
Michael got off the floor to look at Buddy with an angry expression his face. <br />
<br />
“Let him go&quot; he commanded.<br />
<br />
Buddy shook his head no, as he continued to firmly stand in the doorway, blocking Chris’ exit.<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Chris said. “It’s for the best. You really should let me go downstairs now.”<br />
<br />
Buddy continued to bark loudly, pushing himself up to Chris and forcing him back on to the bed. <br />
<br />
“But Freddy” Michael said, as he looked down at Buddy “Chris has the hots for me. Aren&#39;t you uncomfortable with that?”<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t matter” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy barked loudly. “He stays.”<br />
<br />
“But what if he tries to do something again?” Michael asked.<br />
<br />
“Michael” Chris said solemnly. <br />
<br />
Chris got up and gave Michael a hug. <br />
<br />
“Call me Mr. Scavolini” Michael hissed, as he pushed Chris away. “I didn’t give you permission to use my name like that.”<br />
<br />
Buddy growled, as he stared up at Michael.<br />
<br />
“Knock it off, Michael” Freddy thought to himself. “Stop being such an asshole.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael said, as he looked down at Buddy “why are you doing this?”<br />
<br />
“I guess he’s worried about you” Chris replied, as he sat back on the bed. “Maybe he’s concerned about your safety if I’m not in the room with you guys.”<br />
<br />
Buddy nodded, as he looked up at Michael.<br />
<br />
“But Freddy” Michael said. “I just don’t know if I feel comfortable anymore.”<br />
<br />
“Make it work” Freddy thought to himself, as he used his head to knock Michael back onto the bed. <br />
<br />
When Michael landed, Chris helped him get back up. <br />
<br />
“Are you ok, Mr. Scavolini?” Chris asked. <br />
<br />
“I would be” Michael replied “if my husband wasn’t being such an asshole about this.”<br />
<br />
Buddy growled at Michael.<br />
<br />
“I think he’s just looking out for your safety, that’s all” Chris replied, as he hesitated, before putting an arm around Michael’s shoulder. <br />
<br />
Michael sought to move Chris’ arm, before he was met with another disapproving growl from Buddy.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” Michael hissed. <br />
<br />
“I think he wants you to calm down now” Chris replied. <br />
<br />
Buddy nodded in agreement. The dog pushed Michael back onto the bed and urged him to settle back down into a sleeping position.<br />
<br />
“Go to sleep” Freddy thought to himself, as he walked over to Michael’s side of the bed on the floor and laid down to rest. <br />
<br />
“I won’t do anything you don’t want me to” Chris said, as he scooted back up into the bed with him. “I’ll stay on my side from now on.”<br />
<br />
“Wait” Michael said.<br />
<br />
Chris turned to look at Michael, who had a sad look in his eyes. <br />
<br />
“You can cuddle me again.”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure, Mr. Scavolini?” Chris asked. “I don’t want to—“<br />
<br />
“I’ll ignore it” Michael replied. “Let’s just get back to sleep.”<br />
<br />
Michael doused the overhead lights, as Chris hesitated for a moment. Sighing, he rolled over in Michael’s direction and held him in his arms. Before long, Chris’ erection popped up once again. Michael noticed this and decided not to address it. Chris, however, couldn’t help but comment on it.<br />
<br />
“I really think I should roll over onto the other side of the bed” he whispered in Michael’s ear. <br />
<br />
“Oh for fuck’s sake” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy growled loudly.<br />
<br />
“Freddy’s trying to sleep” Michael replied. “Just ignore it and I’ll go back to sleep.”<br />
<br />
Chris sighed, as he settled back into his embrace with Michael. Another few minutes passed, before Michael felt Chris humping at his ass. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck, Chris?” Michael hissed quietly.<br />
<br />
“Huh?” Chris replied, before he noticed what he was doing. “Jesus!”<br />
<br />
Buddy barked loudly and got up from the floor.<br />
<br />
“Will you guys shut the fuck up!” Freddy thought angrily to himself, as Buddy continued to bark loudly. “I’m trying to sleep here. I’m exhausted as hell.”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t know what I was doing” Chris replied nervously. “I’m so sorry, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think he was mad at you about that” Michael said. “I think he just wants us to fall asleep. It’s almost morning at this point.”<br />
<br />
Buddy nodded his head, as he laid back on the floor. Chris sighed again, as he embraced Michael again and finally fell into a deep sleep, with Freddy&#39;s husband firmly in his grasp. They managed to sleep for about five hours, before Michael stirred awake. It was already morning, but he could feel some wood poking at him from behind. Chris’ embrace of him had tightened as they slept and he could feel a wetness on his back.<br />
<br />
“Oh gross” Michael thought to himself, as he began to shudder. “Chris sweated all over my back. Now I’m soaking wet.”<br />
<br />
Chris, feeling Michael moving in front of him, stirred awake quickly.<br />
<br />
“Is it morning yet?” Chris asked groggily. “How much sleep did we get?”<br />
<br />
“About five hours” Michael replied. “That’s the best we could do, considering we got back so late last night.”<br />
<br />
“Is Freddy still a dog?”<br />
<br />
The two of them looked over to see Buddy soundly sleeping on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Guess he is” Michael replied. <br />
<br />
“Do you want to try to go back to sleep?” Chris whispered in his ear. “If Freddy is not ready to wake up yet, then maybe we can get in a little extra shut eye this morning.”<br />
<br />
“I’m good with just resting until he gets up. Chris?”<br />
<br />
“Yes Mr. Scavolini?”<br />
<br />
“I need to take off my shirt, if you don’t mind. Your sweaty chest hair soaked it last night.”<br />
<br />
“Oops.”<br />
<br />
Chris felt his body get hot from blushing, as Michael loosened his grip on his chest and pulled off his shirt. He tossed it onto the floor, next to where Buddy was sleeping, and settled back into bed. He shuddered at Chris&#39; wet chest hair rubbing against his smooth back, but he quickly got used to the sensation. Noticing the dank smell from his husband&#39;s shirt in front of his canine nose, Buddy began to sniff it, as he slowly stirred awake. <br />
<br />
“Guess he’s up now” Michael commented. <br />
<br />
Buddy let out a yawn, as he stretched and stood up. He looked up at Michael, who still looked very tired. Buddy hopped on the bed to lick Michael’s face. <br />
<br />
“Morning Freddy” Michael said, as he squirmed at Buddy’s affection. <br />
<br />
Buddy leaned over Michael and licked Chris’ bearded face. <br />
<br />
“And good morning to you, boss” Chris said, as he let out a light chuckle. “I hope you weren’t too bothered by me hugging your husband last night.”<br />
<br />
Buddy shook his head, as he hopped back onto the floor. He stared up at them, panting happily as he did so.<br />
<br />
“You sure you were ok with this?” Michael asked nervously. <br />
<br />
Buddy barked and nodded his head. <br />
<br />
“Ok then.”<br />
<br />
Michael reached out to pet Buddy. The dog got closer and slid his head under Michael’s hand. Michael scratched him behind the ears, causing him to tap his back paw on the floor in excitement. <br />
<br />
“Good boy.”<br />
<br />
Buddy took a whiff of the air with his nose, as he noticed an arousing smell. The smell began to cause a reaction in his canine member. Seeing Buddy’s red rocket poking out from his sheath, Michael let out a gasp.<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael said excitedly. “I have an idea.”<br />
<br />
Buddy perked up his ears, as he wanted to hear what Michael had to say.<br />
<br />
“Remember how you used to change back last time?”<br />
<br />
Buddy nodded his head.<br />
<br />
“Well, you haven’t had a chance yet to try to pleasure yourself as a dog yet. Why don’t you try to do that now and see if it triggers a change?”<br />
<br />
Buddy thought for a moment, before he barked and nodded in approval. He sat down in a corner and began to lick his exposed red penis. While he was doing so, Michael could Chris’ rocket poking at his ass.<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Chris called out.<br />
<br />
Buddy stopped licking his penis and looked up at Chris.<br />
<br />
“Can I ask you for a favor?”<br />
<br />
Buddy hesitated, before he nodded his head. <br />
<br />
“I was kind of wondering if you would allow me to experiment with your husband?”<br />
<br />
“What?” Michael asked in shock, as he turned around and pushed Chris away from him. <br />
<br />
Michael wiped the sweat from Chris’ hairy body on to the sheets below him. Buddy laid on the floor and silently stared up at Chris. He was very turned on in this moment, with the smells of his husband and his bodyguard permeating into his nose. He wanted to please them, but worried about what this could do to his marriage to Michael. Anything that happened between them needed to be consensual. <br />
<br />
“My instinct is to ok it” Freddy thought to himself “but I’m not sure that I should. Also, what does Michael want?”<br />
<br />
Buddy got up, trotting over to the bed, as his red rocket waved about. He whined as he did so, but then moved to look Michael in the eyes. Michael turned and stared at Buddy, unsure of what is husband was suggesting.<br />
<br />
“Of course” Chris said “that is, if Michael gives me the ok first.”<br />
<br />
Michael turned to look at Chris, who smiled at him nervously. He could see his thick, black chest hair was damp and covered in sweat. His bearded smile did something to lower his inhibitions. The musk coming off of his body also lowered his guard. He wasn’t sure if this was a good idea. He wasn’t even that turned on, but he knew who was. <br />
<br />
Turning to look at Buddy, he could see him panting happily, waving his red dick around as he did so. He wanted to try to turn his husband on as best as he could to get him to trigger a transformation. If Buddy could come to orgasm, then maybe he’d change back. He also knew what his husband was after, so he turned to Chris to propose a deal.<br />
<br />
“I’ll tell you what” Michael said. “I’ll make you a deal. If I let you fuck me, then you have to let Freddy fuck you too.”<br />
<br />
“Arf?” Buddy whined. <br />
<br />
“Uh…” Chris replied, nervously hesitating to respond. “I, uh, I don’t know how comfortable I am with the idea.”<br />
<br />
“It’s really my husband that wants to sleep with you, though. I figure that if you get your way with me, then my husband gets a turn as well. That way, we can call it even and none of us can say we cheated on the other.”<br />
<br />
Chris hesitated for a moment, before he leaned into Michael.<br />
<br />
“I can’t promise you that I will hook up with your husband” Chris replied, as his face got closer to Michael’s. “However, I promise you that I will consider it.”<br />
<br />
Buddy looked up at him and barked happily. Michael turned to look at him, as Buddy panted and wagged his tail back and forth. <br />
<br />
“Is that alright with you?” Michael asked Buddy.<br />
<br />
Buddy barked three times, as he circled around the room in excitement. <br />
<br />
“Guess that’s a yes, then.”<br />
<br />
Chris leaned into Michael, wanting a kiss. Michael, freaking out, pushed him away.<br />
<br />
“No” Michael replied sternly, as he turned around and pulled down his pajama bottoms. “Anal sex only.”<br />
<br />
Chris shrugged, as he chucked off his bottoms and threw them onto the floor. Buddy, smelling the musk coming off of them, ran to Chris’ bottoms and began to sniff at them rapidly. On the bed, Chris began to smack his dick on Michael’s perky butt.<br />
<br />
“I have to confess something to you” Chris whispered in Michael’s ear. “When I saw you giving head to Freddy yesterday, I got insanely jealous. A deep part of me wanted to be the person getting head from you instead. I know you’ve been thinking that I’m trying to replace you as Evan’s dad, but the truth is, I’ve almost been subconsciously trying to replace Freddy as his papa instead.” <br />
<br />
“Seriously?” Michael asked with a confused tone in his voice.<br />
<br />
“Mmhmmm. It’s like, a weird, deep part of me feels this way. I never wanted to admit it to myself until now. The reason I always used to tease you and say that Freddy was too good for you is because I was always kind of jealous of him. I was mean to you because I was almost hoping to replace him as your boyfriend. I don’t find guys too similar to me to be attractive. I see Freddy too much as my bro and a pal, not as a lover. <br />
<br />
“You’re different. You’re really smart, kind, a good cook, a loving husband and a caring person. You’re a family man, one who has sacrificed so much to make everyone else in your household happy. If I were to ever consider being a relationship with another man, I’d want to marry someone like you.”<br />
<br />
Chris kissed Michael on the neck and continued to smack his dick at the perky butt cheeks in front of him.<br />
<br />
“Of course” Chris continued to whisper in Michael’s ear “I need to see how I like this part first. Before I would ever consider marrying a man, I have to know if I can ever be able to enjoy having sex with one. That’s kind of why I’m thankful for you letting me experiment this morning.”<br />
<br />
Michael gulped and shuddered, as Chris eyed the room. <br />
<br />
“Do you have any lube?” Chris asked. <br />
<br />
“Hold on a second.” Michael replied. “Freddy!”<br />
<br />
Buddy stopped licking himself for a moment to bark and look up at Michael. He was getting into a good rhythm, but could wait to hear what his husband had to say.<br />
<br />
“Would you go get the lube from the bathroom, please?”<br />
<br />
Buddy barked in the affirmative, as he got up from the floor and made his way into the bathroom. Opening the cabinet door under the sink with his paw, Buddy grabbed a bottle of lube with his teeth and carried it over to the bed. Nudging Michael with his head, his husband took the bottle from his mouth and patted him on the head. <br />
<br />
“Thanks Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Buddy barked happily and made his way back over to the floor. He continued licking himself, trying to build up towards getting an orgasm. Michael handed Chris the bottle of lube, which he used to coat his penis. Pausing for a moment, Chris whispered in his ear. <br />
<br />
“How many fingers should I put in to start?”<br />
<br />
“Just one” Michael whispered back. “Let me get used to it first.”<br />
<br />
“Ok.”<br />
<br />
Chris squirted some lube on his finger and gently inserted it into Michael’s asshole. He played around with it until he found the prostrate. Gently flicking it, Michael began to moan.<br />
<br />
“Feels good?” Chris asked. <br />
<br />
Michael nodded in approval. <br />
<br />
“Good.”<br />
<br />
Chris pulled his finger out and lubed up a second one. He added it in, causing Michael to moan even louder. <br />
<br />
“Oh my god” Michael moaned in pleasure. <br />
<br />
Buddy heard Michael’s moaning and continued to lick his red rocket faster. This was really turning him on. Even though a part of him had second thoughts about this, considering the kind of strain it would have on their marriage, he was too lost in horniness to think about this clearly. The sights, sounds and smells clouded his critical thinking skills. <br />
<br />
Chris pulled out the second finger and added a third. <br />
<br />
“Wow” Michael moaned, as he squirmed on the bed. <br />
<br />
Chris chuckled, before he pulled his fingers out and lubed up his dick once more.<br />
<br />
“I may be new to gay sex” Chris whispered in Michael’s ear, as he positioned his dick at his bed partner&#39;s asshole “but I’m not unfamiliar with anal sex.”<br />
<br />
Chris gently pushed until the head of his dick entered Michael’s warm love chute. <br />
<br />
“Oh my God” Michael moaned, as Chris sought to sink his head further inside. <br />
<br />
Chris paused for a moment to let Michael get used to the sensation. After a minute, he pushed more of himself in, eventually feeling his hairy bush resting on Michael’s smooth butt cheeks.<br />
<br />
“I’m all the way in” Chris strained himself to say. “This feels so good. Your ass is amazing.”<br />
<br />
Slowly, Michael could feel Chris pull his dick out and gently push it back in. After a time, Chris began to get into a rhythm, pumping his dick back and forth into Michael&#39;s asshole. Despite the sensation feeling quite good, Michael felt something was missing.<br />
<br />
“There’s no emotional connection here” Michael thought to himself, as Chris continued to pump into him, panting as he did so. “It’s not like sex with Freddy, where we feel connected to each other and bond on a deeper level. This just feels like Chris using my asshole to get himself off.”<br />
<br />
Chris didn’t necessarily disagree, as he gripped Michael’s thighs tightly with his hands and continued to pump into him, gaining speed along the way.<br />
<br />
“This feels great” Chris thought to himself “but it’s just a warm hole for me to pleasure myself with. I don’t have that kind of emotional bond I do when I’m fucking a woman.”<br />
<br />
As they continued to fuck, Buddy watched Chris pummeling his husband’s ass from the floor. He could see that Michael was bothered by this and whimpered quietly to himself.<br />
<br />
“I knew this was a bad idea” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy’s erection began to wane and his penis returned into its sheath. “Michael is going to hate me after this. I don’t even care about Chris reciprocating with me, to be honest. All I care about is making sure this doesn’t jeopardize our marriage. I just don’t want Michael to be mad at me for pressuring him into doing this.”<br />
<br />
Buddy continued to stare at them, as Chris got closer to reaching an orgasm. Soon enough, Chris bucked faster and harder into Michael and rapidly panted in his ear. <br />
<br />
“I’m going to cum soon” Chris moaned into Michael’s ear, as his beard scraped into his bed partner&#39;s neck. “Can I come in you?”<br />
<br />
Michael hesitated, before he nodded his head in approval. <br />
<br />
“You’re clean, right?” Michael asked.<br />
<br />
“Positive. I haven’t had sex in almost a year and I’ve been tested since.”<br />
<br />
Michael felt Chris pounding into him faster, as he reached the point of no return.<br />
<br />
“Ahh!” Chris moaned through strained, jagged breaths. “I’m gonna cum in your ass! I’m gonna blow! Argh! Fuck!”<br />
<br />
Chris moaned loudly, as he let out a torrent of cum that flooded into Michael’s asshole. Normally, a pounding like that would see an erection form on Michael’s dick and a hands free ejaculation. However, Michael wasn’t feeling particularly turned on in that moment. Instead, all he could focus on was the wet, warm feeling of Chris’ cum filling up his asshole. Eight contractions of Chris’ dick came quickly, attacking the walls of his innards with its aggressive pulsations. Chris moaned in pleasure, as let out his sticky seed and gave it to Michael&#39;s warm hole. Michael wondered if Freddy’s little swimmers were playing around with Chris’ inside of his guts. <br />
<br />
“I know it’s not rational” Michael thought to himself “but if Freddy had fucked my ass a few days ago, who knows what might still be up in there.”<br />
<br />
When he was done, Chris panted into Michael’s ear and hugged him tightly in a sweaty grasp. Michael could feel his back getting wetter then before, as Chris&#39; wet chest hair rubbed up against his smooth back. After a minute or so, Chris reached for a tissue on the nightstand and placed it underneath him.<br />
<br />
“Let me catch my load so I don’t make a mess on your bed” Chris suggested with a coo. <br />
<br />
Michael nodded, as Chris pulled his dick out. He watched his load spill out and cover his waiting tissue with his sticky seed. When Michael had expelled it all out in a series of farts, Chris chuckled, as he got up from the bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was considerate of you&quot; Michael admitted. &quot;Freddy never offers to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was the least I could do&quot; Chris replied with a shrug.<br />
<br />
He hesitated for a moment, before he called out to the dog.<br />
<br />
“Hey Freddy” Chris said.<br />
<br />
Buddy looked up at him, with intrigue in his eyes. <br />
<br />
“I know you like my cum, so you want to try some before it dries out?”<br />
<br />
“Ew” Michael remarked in disgust. <br />
<br />
Buddy nodded, as Chris got up and placed the tissue to his snout. Buddy licked the cum up with his tongue and felt himself shiver in delight.<br />
<br />
“Tastes good” Freddy admitted to himself, as he looked at Chris’ naked body before him. <br />
<br />
Chris&#39; body was still sexy, even if was covered in sweat. The smell of his ripe pits hit his canine nose and caused him to pant happily. The fur on Chris was massive, damp and coating his entire front. Freddy hoped to be able to touch it someday and feel it on his fingertips. Having given him permission to fuck his husband, Freddy expected the favor to be repaid by Chris. <br />
<br />
“I can’t wait to tap that ass” Freddy thought to himself, as Chris threw the seedy tissue in the garbage. <br />
<br />
Chris settled back into the bed and whispered in Michael’s ear. <br />
<br />
“How was I as a lover?”<br />
<br />
Michael shrugged, which caused Chris to frown.<br />
<br />
“Eh” he replied honestly. “It’s not the same as Freddy, to be honest with you. I’m not a fan of hairy guys and I just didn’t think we had much of a connection to each other in bed.”<br />
<br />
“I agree” Chris confessed. “Your ass felt wonderful, but I just couldn’t connect with you on an emotional level. I just kind of saw your hole as a way to get myself off. It kind of confirms that I’m really more into girls than guys. Thanks for helping me recognize that.”<br />
<br />
“Wait.”<br />
<br />
Michael put his hand on Chris’ dick by accident. He blushed, as Chris looked him in the eyes and chuckled. <br />
<br />
“Want another round?” Chris asked, as he licked his lips. &quot;I could possibly arrange that, if you are so inclined.&quot;<br />
<br />
“No” Michael replied sharply.<br />
<br />
Michael moved his hand away and looked at Chris in the eyes.<br />
<br />
“Please do your best to repay the favor. Freddy really is going to want to get his hands on you now. I helped you out in your sexual discovery. If you want to make sure our marriage doesn’t feel a strain because of this, then you have to give him the opportunity to try it with you too.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know if I’m comfortable with that.”<br />
<br />
“Chris.”<br />
<br />
Michael stood up and looked at him angrily.<br />
<br />
“I’m already having mixed feelings and second thoughts about this. I’m sure Freddy will as well, when he lets his dick take a hiatus from clouding his thinking. Speaking of which, Freddy?”<br />
<br />
Buddy looked up at him and nodded. <br />
<br />
“Did you manage to cum just now?”<br />
<br />
Buddy shook his head no.<br />
<br />
“Son of a fucking bitch!”<br />
<br />
“Easy, Michael” Chris cooed. <br />
<br />
“Mr—“<br />
<br />
“Look.”<br />
<br />
Chris stood up and looked Michael deeply in his eyes. <br />
<br />
“We just went as intimate as two people can get with one another. Whether it’s a good idea or not is something we’ll have to talk about when this is all over. For now, though, the line of formality has been crossed. Lovers don’t address each other by titles.”<br />
<br />
“It was just a little dalliance” Michael replied. “At the end of the day, you’re still Freddy’s employee.”<br />
<br />
“I planted my seed into you. Who else besides your husband has ever done that to you before?”<br />
<br />
“It doesn’t change the facts.”<br />
<br />
“Are you fucking kidding me?”<br />
<br />
“I knew this was a bad idea.”<br />
<br />
Michael stormed out of the bedroom and made his way to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“Wait!”<br />
<br />
Michael slammed the bathroom door shut, as he intended to take another shower. <br />
<br />
“Great” Chris said with a sigh, as he sat back down on the bed. <br />
<br />
Buddy whimpered, as he got up and placed his nose in Chris’ lap.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think we should be doing this, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Buddy ignored him, as he nuzzled his face into Chris’ crotch. He took in the musky smell of his pubes and felt comforted in that moment. <br />
<br />
“Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Chris patted Buddy on the head, as he spoke to him calmly.<br />
<br />
“I think I really messed this up big time, boss. I probably should have kept my dick to myself. Now, you’re going to have a problem on your hands and it’s all my fault.”<br />
<br />
Chris let out a tear, as Buddy looked up and saw it flow out. He quickly jumped up and licked it off of his face, causing Chris to squirm. Chuckling, he patted Buddy all over his body. Chris laid down on the bed and rubbed Buddy all over his body. Even though he was still filled with remorse and regret, Buddy was making him put those feelings aside for the moment. <br />
<br />
A more somber feeling hit Michael, as he quietly took a shower. He knew, once again, that this was a very bad idea, and that Freddy&#39;s, and now Chris’ dicks, did the talking for them.<br />
<br />
