<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>In response to a request from a reader, this chapter contains John's POV of the scene where he was changed.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back in the Master Bedroom of the Trojan Suite, John was still a lion-man, specifically a Nemean lion-man.  He was as strong as Hercules, but being a &quot;monster&quot; not as handsome or heroic, except to his wife. He&#39;d never really BEEN &quot;handsome&quot; or &quot;heroic&quot; -- but as lions went he was pretty good looking. He had a shorter muzzle than an actual lion. He could shift a bit between completely lion and human-with-significant-lion-features. He had gold fur that was soft and sleek, and a rusty mane that was still quite soft. He had a tail. That was ... different.<br />
And his wife Sharry... there was something new in their relationship, that he&#39;d been missing and never realized.  Sharry was pounding into him with a dick that most women would find too big to take comfortably, and honestly, if he weren&#39;t a semi-invulnerable lion-man, he&#39;d find it too painful. But instead he found it wonderful. This was their third time so far: first on the couch in the shared great-room, then in the bathroom, and now on their bed, and Shar was a complete turn-on to him. He had always had a crush on muscle, especially on the kind that was hard and smooth and not over-ripped. And that was Shar now, blessed with the best attributes of male and female both. And though he might miss seeing actual breasts, the giant pectorals with their large and sensitive nipples ... he took a moment to bend forward and nibble on one with his teeth, gently pulling on the other with his fingertips, avoiding the claws.  He started purring as Shar thrashed in a sudden unexpected orgasm, clenching around his tail which was sliding in Shar&#39;s quim, pushing deeper into his ass with the perfect dick that was impaled there.  He shuddered himself with another edge-riding orgasm himself.<br />
That would be a great band-name, he mused. Unexpected Orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re thinking something nerdy,&quot; Shar said, collapsing onto him.  &quot;What is it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Band name. Unexpected Orgasm.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s pretty nerdy.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. Even as a massively hot and sexy lion, I remain a nerd at heart.&quot;<br />
&quot;So... why ARE you a lion?&quot;<br />
&quot;A massively hot and sexy lion.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah that. Why?&quot;<br />
John-Lion wrapped his arms around his wife. &quot;Hey, are you still my wife or do we come up with a different term??&quot;<br />
&quot;Wife is still fine. I&#39;m still the mother of our children.&quot;<br />
&quot;You wanna do that right now? We could have that daughter you always wanted.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I think we&#39;ll hold off for now.  Answer the question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s important to realize that I was drunk.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh really? Why is that important?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because I was drunk and also dressed up... here, I&#39;ll start from the beginning.&quot;<br />
He shifted his partner so that the still-hard member that was still pushing his tail out of the way was not pressing on his bladder from the inside, and delicately licked their face.<br />
&quot;Our slightly older son had brought me a special dish from the cook, and practically hand-fed it to me. I didn&#39;t know it but it was finished with some wine that was blessed by Hebe.&quot;<br />
&quot;The spa goddess?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, the goddess of youthful vigor.&quot;<br />
&quot;And that got you drunk?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, the weird mix of wine and things that Dionysus put into my mushrooms got me drunk. There may also have been something odd about a few of those mushrooms.&quot;<br />
&quot;Tell me more.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I was tripping balls. I felt like I was 18 again. I mean, literally ... my gut was gone. My hair was back.  I was stoned out of my gourd like that time your treacherous roommate brought you a hash brownie and you let me have it because you were trying to keep your training diet.&quot;<br />
&quot;That was hilarious,&quot; Shar said. &quot;Though I did get that bitch expelled for it.&quot;<br />
&quot;You said you didn&#39;t take revenge!&quot;<br />
&quot;I lied. She was trying to wreck my position on the team.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad you got rid of her. Anyway,  I barely remember when you were taken off by that group of hot satyr boys.&quot;<br />
&quot;You liked them huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;I was imagining being one of them. No need for that now,&quot; John-Lion said, moving his tail inside Sharry&#39;s woman-part, just a little, because lion tails twitch.<br />
Sharry smiled and brushed his whiskers with their left hand. &quot;Nope. Now keep going or I&#39;ll have to start going in and out again.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh no, don&#39;t throw me in the bramble bush!&quot;<br />
Shar began moving slowly and John-lion winced. Still a bit too sore, still edging.<br />
&quot;OK, OK. So after dinner we were led down to the amphitheater we saw on the tour. The kids and I were put in the seats at the right hand of the gold throne, and Dyon -- who is actually Dionysus, in case you didn&#39;t notice.&quot;<br />
&quot;I did in fact notice this. I saw some of it in a dream while I was in the spa.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh? Magic dreams? That&#39;s cool, so you got to see my acting chops.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yep. Acting pork chops.&quot;<br />
&quot;That was the barbecue scene. Apparently Greeks were into barbecue, who knew?&quot;<br />
&quot;Who knew.  So, lion?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. The play started, and this chorus of satyrs starts telling the story of how the play got produced and it was hilarious, even Derrick and Juli... Jules, huh that was weird. Even Rick and Jules were laughing at them. But while they were making jokes, four or five nymph types dragged me off to &quot;volunteer&quot; for the part of the Nemean Lion. Versus Hercules.  They promised that I wouldn&#39;t actually have to die or anything.  Which I was legitimately worried about, don&#39;t laugh.&quot;<br />
Sharry laughed of course, so John-Lion clenched down below, two or three times in reproof,  causing Sharry to  moan and twitch, biting their lip because they were also edging again and it was way too intense having just come twice in a half hour in two separate places in their body.  <br />
&quot;So, I was taken backstage and given another cup of wine, and they pulled out this huge lion skin,  it was actual leather, and tried it on me.  I told them I was an awfully skinny lion and this one guy laughed and said stage magic and padding would fix that. He was really friendly, reminded me of some of the wrestlers back in school who I now realize were hitting on me, but at the time I was clueless. You knew, didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I encouraged them. The thought of you getting fucked by another guy made me hot. Not that you get to do that now, except if I give you permission,&quot; Sharry said. &quot;Of course the same goes for me and anyone else.&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course. Anyway  I thought was the actor that would normally play the part, but he said he was just there to help with the costume. He made me take my clothes off and he and one of the satyrs rubbed this grease into my skin -- and you remember when I was 18, I had basically no body hair, no beard, barely underarm and pubes. That&#39;s what I had, and they still shaved off what little I had, including that stupid wispy attempt at a mustache I had at that age. They even shaved my head and eyebrows. I was so drunk I thought it was funny.  But then the big guy -- you know, I didn&#39;t notice it at the time, but I think he was another Nemean Lion.  He had the ears for it. And the tail. Anyway he stitches me into the costume, using this claw thing to punch holes in it so he could stitch it tight. He stuck my ears in its ears, my toes in its toes and my fingers in its fingers and my dick in the lion-dick that I am sure someone used for a coin pouch at some point.  And then he said it was time to pad it out but first he had to clean me out. So they took this big bladder thing with a hose on it and filled it with warm water and shoved it all up my ass and then made me hold it for a count of ten, then push it out again... they did that at least twice more, but the last time I think it was wine or something because everything went all super-drunk and when they were done I felt all stretched out down there, and the guy said he had to tuck the asshole in, I&#39;m pretty sure he stuck his finger, or maybe his hand, up my backside. It&#39;s hard to remember, I was just drunk and suddenly incredibly horny and I couldn&#39;t move and the lion-suit was way too tight... For all I know he could&#39;ve crawled inside me.  Then someone waved some really stinky incense in my face and it woke me up and I could barely move, I felt so sore all over and at the same time I felt really really good.&quot;<br />
&quot;So the Nemean Lion crawled up your ass into your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, not everyone gets to have a lovely spa day. Besides I liked it better,&quot; John-Lion said. &quot;It was like when we were first married, you would tie me up in that bondage-suit that your crazy cousin gave us.&quot;<br />
&quot;Back to the story. Crazy cousin is still crazy.&quot;<br />
&quot;OK, so they gave me another drink, a small one, but this one was really spicy and burned in my throat. I could barely talk, everything came out all growling and roaring and coughing. Then this HUGE guy comes back, I mean, more muscles in his left pinky than most people have in their left leg.  But he&#39;s really cool, and he explains what my part&#39;s gonna be, meanwhile, I hear two of the nymphs swooning about how hot it would be if they could get Hercules to have sex with them, but then the costume guy tells &#39;em that they&#39;re out of luck, he&#39;d have to get Hebe&#39;s permission first and she won&#39;t give it to them.<br />
So while I&#39;m realizing that this big muscle dude is really Hercules, they stick a big weird giant carved lion mask on me, and one of the satyrs puts on a black hooded robe so he can go onstage to pretend to be my dialogue coach.  Well. Pretend. He really IS my dialogue coach, except all I get to say is &quot;Roar&quot;.  Partly because they stuck the  mask over my head. They attached a wig to the back of it for a mane. The mask was built with the mouth open to roar and pretend-bite. Anyway then it&#39;s time and they shove me out onto the stage, which ... I know it was flat, but to me after all that weird booze -- never drink ouzo and vodka at the same time -- it sure looked to me like a mountainside in Greece, with just scrubby plants and heat and the smell of someone&#39;s sheep, which for some reason I thought I&#39;d hunt.  I guess I was getting into character.<br />
So I see this big goofy looking muscle dude who I realize is Herc wearing one of those carved masks that really doesn&#39;t look much like his real face, and he acts all surprised like I had snuck up on him, and the dialogue coach feeds me my line, something about Hera&#39;s vengeance, but when I say it back with feeling, it seems like nobody hears it, they just hear roar roar Roar roar because the mask distorts my voice which is really deep and raspy after the spicy drink.  <br />
Which is fine. We have a lot of fun with it. He says he doesn&#39;t speak Lion, I say I&#39;m speaking Nemean, he says he doesn&#39;t speak Nemean either. Very funny except Herc pulls out a bow and starts shooting arrows at me, but they bounce off like they were bullets and I was superman, or rather, super-lion. My dialogue coach runs to hide offstage, and I do a biceps-flex at Herc. So he throws a bunch of rocks, which also bounce off, and kind of tickle, then he throws a big boulder, and I catch it and sit on it bored, and clean my nails. They itched.  So then someone hisses at me from through the arch thing to get off stage, so I pick up my boulder and go inside and put it down - one of the satyrs makes me move it back outside because it was blocking the arch. I dunno why he didn&#39;t move it himself.&quot;<br />
&quot;Because it was a giant boulder and he wasn&#39;t strong enough?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nah, it was a prop. I bet it was union rules.&quot;<br />
&quot;Must be. Keep going, Lion-boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So by now I was sobering up. I know, it seems kinda weird, but after Dyon gave me those mushrooms, I noticed that I could stop being drunk if I wanted to, but I could also go right back. Kind of awesome, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure sure. I saw some of this part, the goat-boy chorus was going on about how wonderful the playwright was.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s part of the play structure, because they did &#39;em as competitions.&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh. So this is a play in honor of Dionysys, that&#39;s being judged by Dionysus, that he wrote.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yep! He has competition though. Apollo and Athena like to write them too.  So does Hestia.  You know, the hearth-goddess who doesn&#39;t leave the house? She writes the ones with the most insane relationships and wierd sex. They can&#39;t show most of them to mortals.&quot;<br />
&quot;And how do you know this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh... Huh, how DO I know this?  Hmmm.  Oh! I still have a copy of the Nemean&#39;s memories in my head.&quot;<br />
&quot;Because he crawled up your ass.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, he put me on like a costume. Only fair, I was in his skin.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s disturbing and not sexy.&quot;<br />
John-lion shimmied around a bit, making sure his tail also moved, to restore the &quot;edge of orgasm&quot; sensation that they&#39;d been enjoying all along. He licked Sharry&#39;s chest gently, kneading with his hands like cat-paws on their back until they and he were almost panting again.<br />
&quot;OK, back to the story.  So Herc goes back onstage while I stay in my &#39;cave&#39; and he messes around outside.  He starts fanning this roasted-meat smell in, using his loincloth, and that cracks me up because it smells like barbecue and why would his crotch smell like barbecue sauce, and I am pretty sure I could be heard outside, but the backstage people say I am doing good.  So Herc goes stomping off to the other end of the stage and then backs into the arch half-way, just his mask hanging out onstage, and then the orchestra started making farting noises. I figure out he must&#39;ve been eating beans or something, anyway, he pulls his mask inside and then there comes a THUMP from one of the drums, and my dialogue coach says, &#39;inhale!&#39; and I do but it&#39;s a trap. He waves some burning-egg incense at me that is nose-murdering horrible, and I go lurching out onto stage coughing.<br />
&#39;Pst! Eat the barbecue!&#39; the dialogue coach says.<br />
Well, I am onstage again but it looks real at the same time again, y&#39;know? So there&#39;s a fire pit and this huge haunch of a mammoth on a spit, and that smell is still coming from the cave mouth, so I grab that boulder and shove it in front to block the stink. Then I sit down and go to town noshing on that haunch of mammoth. At that moment, I&#39;m so incredibly hungry, and it&#39;s bigger than me, but I eat it anyway. It&#39;s salty but moist and tender and crispy on the outside, Mmmm!  My lion-skin starts feeling REALLY tight, then. All the stitches are getting stretched out, the cords weren&#39;t made out of Nemean Lion skin, so they weren&#39;t strong enough to really hold. And not just my belly, all the stitches on my arms and legs and the sides of my chest. Anyway, I get down to bone and I realize that the meat was really really REALLY salty and I am SO thirsty.  But there isn&#39;t anything to drink.  I decide to go back inside, partly because the goat-boy chorus is helpfully saying there was fresh water in my cave, so I move the boulder and Herc comes lurching out and falls into my arms like he&#39;d been gassed or something.  I take a few steps back because that stink is still there in the cave entrance, and Herc says it be stanky in there, his bad, we should let it air out some.  I tell him I am dying of thirst, so he gave me some wine which he conveniently is carrying a LOT of wineskins.  And, while it&#39;s a little sour, it&#39;s just exactly what I need.  Of course, I start getting drunkish again, but my tolerance is growing or something, and the wine-god has something else in mind.  So Herc tries to get me drunk so he can kill me, thanks for the tip-off goat-boy chorus, and I ain&#39;t having any of that, I tell him he had to drink one too. I figure if we&#39;re both drunk, neither of us will have a bigger edge. Although, really, I have my claws, which are a way bigger edge.  We end up drinking two more skins apiece, and man that stuff is good.  We&#39;re feeling all brothers-in-drunk so we come up with this scheme to fool his stupid cousin, but we have to do this contest to see who can choke the other one.  So they light up the back-stage so all the shadows show on the white curtains that the stage-hands pull across. We go inside and we&#39;re yelling things about how stinky it is -- mostly Herc though because I still only speak Roar, and he was clearly lying when he said he didn&#39;t. So I run down to move the curtain-boulder off the other end, and then he grabs me and drags me back to the middle arch and grabs me by the dick and says, &#39;Time to see who can choke who.&#39; And then he kisses me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, it was kind of hot... I mean, really uncomfortable hot because we had those stupid masks on.&quot;<br />
&quot;Aww.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah well, we&#39;re making out with the masks on, so I&#39;m trying to push him back so we can take the stupid things off, and there&#39;s this bright light on one side of us that&#39;s throwing these shadows up on the arch, and then he pulls out his dick, and you know that club he carries around? Well, at this point, I could not tell you which was which. And the way he moves it around it&#39;s making shadows that make it look more like the club than the chub, right?  So he sticks it in the mouth-hole of my mask and I can&#39;t really bite with the mask, like I would do if I was really the lion, but then something in my head says, &#39;No, this is pretty much how it went down originally too,&#39; and then he&#39;s actually in my real mouth pushing back and forth but he has no stamina, or the wine had something in it, because he starts coming down my throat.  I choke a bit and things get dark-and-starry as he&#39;s got this giant meat-club shoved in my throat, but I figure if I swallow I can keep up. But I can&#39;t. He&#39;s moaning and yelling, I&#39;m gurgling and I go limp and everything fades to black.<br />
When I wake up, I feel like something huge pushed out my ass again, but they&#39;re rinsing me there and all over with some sort of diluted wine vinegar, to take the grease off I guess, and things tighten up down below. I feel looser over my body, and I see that the lion-skin has been un-stitched and taken away. I still have the lion fur though, and the claws and my hair is wild and I have a tail. And muscles everywhere. My ears twitch. My nose whiffs, and I smell spunk and wine and some kind of not-egg incense, and I can&#39;t really see.<br />
So when they wipe the gunk off my eyes, and then rinse me off by emptying a few buckets of water over me, I can see that I&#39;m in the room downstairs of the stage, with Herc and the guy who sewed me into the lion suit, who has the lion-suit draped over him.  Who is, I realize, an actual Nemean Lion, and he and Herc are acting like best buddies, and he says, &#39;That was great, Leo, thanks for all your help. Dyon is sure to win this time.&#39;&quot;<br />
&quot;So you had oral sex with Hercules,&quot; Sharry said.<br />
&quot;More like he used me to get off ... but I think he had to. See, once they fed me up to size, the lion had to get out, and Herc was just pushing him out with hydraulic pressure, or lubing him up with god-spooge or something.&quot;<br />
&quot;And probably giving you some kind of blessing. You have muscles in places where regular people don&#39;t have places.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you mind?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh, NO. I like it. Besides, now I also have muscles like I always wanted.&quot;<br />
&quot;Purr. Roar?&quot;<br />
&quot;OK, I think we can go for another.&quot;<br />
Sharry and their lion began moving together again, faster.</p>
