<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After both Ian and I had calmed down, I let him grab a shower in my parents bathroom while I did the same in mine and Chris&#39;s. I noticed in the bathroom a huge clump of sticky tissue in the bin. Chris had heard us and had been sorting his own needs out. Oddly I felt a pang of guilt that I hadn&#39;t serviced him too, but he would get his later, definitely.<br />
<br />
I returned to my room, wearing only a towel around my waist. Looking in the mirror I was met with a my own handsome face, damn the small-dick diet does do the body good. Dropping my towel to see myself in all my &#39;glory&#39; I admired my body. I was tall, athletic, great thick crop of sandy brown hair, good thick eyebrows, a touch of stubble coming in. I had to admit I looked great. Looking down I could see my tiny nubbin above my tiny balls and sighed. Well you couldn&#39;t have everything I thought, blushing. Ian came in behind me, catching me looking at myself.<br />
<br />
I quickly grabbed my towel and covered up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah dude, damn it is fucking tiny!&quot; Ian strode up to me, taller and more imposing, his towel obscenely bulging out in front of him, barely covering his huge cock.<br />
<br />
I blushed, my cock instantly hard. Ian laughed, &quot;That really is a hair-trigger you got there bro! He tapped the tip with his index finger... that dwarfed my inch long cocklet. I came on his hand...<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! Oh my god Ian... fuck I&#39;m so....&quot; He held up his now cumming hand to stop me, well it had a little cum on it, less than he the amount of pre he produced in one pump to be honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You just swallowed two massive loads from this.&quot; He grabbed the base and shook his cock, the towel swinging with it. &quot;A little cum, a very small amount of cum, isn&#39;t gonna be an issue dude.&quot; And he did the unthinkable. He reached forward and held the hand in front of me. &quot;Yours I think?&quot;<br />
<br />
I instinctively licked it off his hand. OK this was the first time tasting my own short-dick cum and to be honest... it was rancid! I pulled a face and Ian laughed at me. &quot;Eww that is... god it&#39;s so bitter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess when you take away the large-dick, what did my dad call it, batter? Yea batter. I guess it&#39;s just sperm and carrying fluid. Not as tasty?&quot; He wiped his hand on this towel.<br />
<br />
I shook my head and squirted some water in my mouth from the bottle next to my bed, swilling it out. I looked back at him saying &quot;Yea large-dick batter is much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right then little dick,&quot; another throb from my dicklet, &quot;weren&#39;t we meant to be playing some games and hanging out?&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded smiling. And we did. We hung out just like we always had, the power dynamic was kind of weird, like when I beat him I felt embarrassed not happy, when he won I felt proud. It was weird but I guess normal for me now.<br />
<br />
After a couple of hours Ian surprised me with questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Dan, Mr Jenkins?&quot; Ian raised a sexy black eyebrow at me. &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
I blushed, looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah dude, it&#39;s your life, I just can&#39;t imagine it. I mean I know you guys are happy to get it whereever, but he&#39;s so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Old?&quot; I offered not looking up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, like ancient old, like does it just produce powdered batter?&quot; He found this hilarious and his deep laugh made my spine shivver a bit, in a good way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, no not at all, in fact the... uh... batter... actually gets better with age apparently. I googled it and the concentration of nutrients is higher, it&#39;s like super charged I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, well is mine not as...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop!&quot; I held up a hand. He looked at me confused. &quot;Dude, I am not discussing who&#39;s is better, that&#39;s weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? That&#39;s what&#39;s weird? I mean I&#39;ve never met a short-dick so I guess I have no idea how it all works. I really only care about two things.&quot; I looked up questioningly. &quot;Am I a good... source for you and are you, you know... happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled widely &quot;Yes and actually yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, then I&#39;m happy for you.&quot; Ian slapped me on the back hard. A moment passed and he sat up again quickly. &quot;Wait, have you... you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know?&quot; He pressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don&#39;t, have I what?&quot; I really didn&#39;t know where he was going now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your cherry?&quot; Ian whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... that... well erm yea... Chris... this morning...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; Ian mouthed &quot;Waitago Chris!&quot; And we laughed again. I was really loving this new normal for me. The laughter was broken by the door bell.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got it!&quot; I heard Chris shout up. A moment and &quot;It&#39;s George for you little dick!&quot; I throbbed again. Every. Fucking. Time. Damn...<br />
<br />
I looked at Ian and his face soured instantly. &quot;George? Really? I mean it&#39;s up to you but I&#39;ll get rid of him if you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would?&quot; I asked coyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Totally, I&#39;m not having that dweeb use my best bud, the mental image alone is... ugh.&quot; Ian shuddered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean he&#39;s actually got a...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, no... don&#39;t wanna know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was gonna spend all day with you, and I&#39;m not exactly hungry... let me go tell him I&#39;m busy...&quot; I stood to go before Ian grabbed my wrist pulling me back onto the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea right, and the moment he large-dick&#39;s you by rubbing it or something you&#39;d be kneeling before him. I&#39;ll tell him.&quot; Ian walked past me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be kind, he&#39;s a good guy.&quot; I called at his muscular back as he left.<br />
<br />
I stayed in the room listening. I could hear talking, nothing sounding like anger or shouting. If anything they seemed to be shooting the breeze. I crept onto the landing to listen closer. Chris obviously had the same idea as he was there listening too. He grinned at me. I nodded back.<br />
<br />
I was trying to listen, Chris was definitely listening, but all my eyes could see was the massive mound in my brother&#39;s joggers, all hung to the left, the balls making huge round outward dents in the fabric, his thick python of a cock, snaking down to his knee... my mouth watered, I wasn&#39;t hungry at all but damn that looked good.<br />
<br />
They seemed to be finishing up their convo when I saw Chris look over at me, smugly. He reached down and lowered the first couple of inches of his joggers, the turnk thick first three inches showing. I gulped. He nodded and mouthed &quot;all yours boy&quot;. I nodded back. He turned and went back to him room.<br />
<br />
Ian bounded back up the stairs, two at a time and caught me on the landing looking flush. &quot;You OK?&quot; I nodded slowly. &quot;Well OK, he&#39;s actually not a bad guy I guess. He said he&#39;d actually come over for two reasons, one was, well for the obvious ha!&quot; Ian beamed at me &quot;Little dick has already got them queuing up hey?&quot; My already straining nub spurt some pre. &quot;The other was actually to make sure you were OK, he was worried about you, apparently before he found out you were a short-dick you were kind to him and he wanted to make sure you didn&#39;t feel like he&#39;d taken advantage of you, well we laughed at that, but I knew what he meant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See...&quot; I gasped a little, &quot;he is a nice guy, I wouldn&#39;t mind him being, you know...&quot; Ian nodded and put his hand on my shoulder, giving a brief squeeze, as he went back in my room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey as long as he&#39;s behind me in the queue, go for it.&quot; We returned to gaming, my mind trying to get off of my brother&#39;s cock, off George&#39;s sweetness, off of Ian&#39;s python, visibly laying against his thigh two feet to my side. It was closing in on 6, almost time for Ian to get a lift home.<br />
<br />
I led him to the door just as the doorbell rang. We had a hug and I opened the door to see Mr. Ito stood waiting for his son, the car running behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Daniel, hello. Ready to go Ian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Mr. Ito. Good to see you sir.&quot; I bowed politely, Mr Ito chuckled, I&#39;d been doing that since I was 8, since Ian told me jokingly I had to else his father would be offended and never let me over again. It was an old habit that always made him smile so I carried on.<br />
<br />
As I stood I heard a sharp intake of breath. Mr Ito was staring at my waist. I blushed. Ian went to grab his father&#39;s arm. &quot;Come on Dad, it&#39;s time to...&quot; Mr Ito shook him free and said something sternly to him in Japanese. Ian nodded solemnly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything... OK?&quot; I asked quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... are you a Mijikai-Otokonoko?&quot; Mr Ito took a step forward, he was a lot shorter than me, maybe 5&#39;6&quot;, but his trousers were well packed, for a man in his 50s he was stocky and firmly built too. I licked my lips unconsciously.<br />
<br />
&quot;A what?&quot; I asked looking to Ian.<br />
<br />
&quot;He asked if you were a short-dick.&quot; Ian added<br />
<br />
I looked at Mr Ito and nodded. Mr Ito said something to Ian again. Ushering us in and stepping inside and closing the door behind him he stood in front of me.<br />
<br />
I was so confused. &quot;Mr. Ito? What are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Boy.&quot; He snarled at me. &quot;Did you serve my son?&quot; Ian blushed.<br />
<br />
Serve? Well I guess it&#39;s as good a word as any. I nodded quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonderful!&quot; He shouted clapping his hands. &quot;Oh yes, that is very good.&quot; He reached out and patted me on the shoulder. He left his hand there. &quot;I could never have... you are Ian&#39;s best friend, but now you have, are you by chance, hungry?&quot; He reached down and unbuckled his belt with his free hand, the one on my shoulder pressed down firmly. I knelt willingly, my eyes fixed on my best friend&#39;s dad&#39;s cock. I was mentally remembering how Ian&#39;s looked, would it be the same size, shape, colouring, I was more than curious. I looked over at Ian who was smiling at me.<br />
<br />
After the buckle was loose his trousers went to drop but got caught on his fat cock. &quot;You sort this short-dick, do a good job for you old friend Yuki.&quot; I tugged at the trousers and his huge cock swung free, slapping me in the chest, then his left leg and then hanging free. Fuck it was almost a carbon copy of his son&#39;s! Mr Ito was now talking to his son, something about dinner when they get home, had he eaten, did he have a good day. I was too busy salivating over this mature version of Ian&#39;s cock. Lifting the great head up to eye level I opened my mouth and took him in, my tongue now instantly distending and swirling around the fat head. Mmm he tasted salty and rich, his pre had a sweet nutty taste and he produced a lot.<br />
<br />
I leaned up and started to deep throat him, taking all 15 inches in one go. I was getting good at this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Dad, he&#39;s amazing isn&#39;t he, it&#39;s genuinely impressive how he does that.&quot; Ian nudged his dad looking down at me grinning happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, very... ung yes boy.... very impressive I must say, you&#39;re mother cannot...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eww dad I don&#39;t wanna hear about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Ito laughed and groaned as I began to slide his thick fat cock into and out of my throat. &quot;Son your short-dick friend is fellating me, and what me and your mother do is nothing to be ashamed of! Oh little dick, yes swallow around it more, milk that huge cock, yes that&#39;s it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is different dad, jeez! It&#39;s like me commenting on your dick, it&#39;s just weird.&quot; I moaned around the fat cock at the thought of Ian complimenting his dad&#39;s dick. That sounded so fucking hot, especially compared to my nub.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh short-dick likes that. Come on son, tell the dicklet boy.&quot; Ian took a breath, this was weird, but turning a short-dick on made it seem fine to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck dad, look at that huge cock, I think it&#39;s as big as mine, maybe bigger.&quot; I was moaning, my cock spurting pumps of pre in my trousers. &quot;Damn and compared to that little bitch&#39;s nubbin, you look like a fucking giant to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really boy? You think so? Ung... fuck yea&quot; Mr Ito now began to pump along with my working his cock, it was causing him to slam into me now and it was driving me mad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Totally dad, I mean look at it, it&#39;s fucking massive,&quot; kneeling until we were sideways face to face, watching his dad&#39;s cock slide in and out of my mouth, &quot;the head is stretching his throat, you can see it as you slam up and down. Here you feel this?&quot; Ian placed his hand on my throat, his dad moaned at the sort of contact. &quot;You can feel the ridge of the head sliding in there, up and down. You like this right dicklet? My best friend the cock worshipper, how many is it now? I mean you&#39;ve had me and my dad now... hey dad, maybe Thomas should come over when he transitions? I think he&#39;d gonna be a large-dick like us based on what I&#39;ve seen. Thomas was almost 14 and had yet to transition, but he was a confident and loud kid, trademarks of a guaranteed large-dick, usually the cockier they are the... well cockier they are!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh son, it&#39;s so good, I&#39;m gonna feed this boy now. You ready you little dicked cock sucker, take it!&quot; I came as Mr Ito began to unload into me. Ian stood and patted his dad on the shoulder to congratulate him. To large-dick&#39;s getting your dick serviced if front of another large-dick was never embarrassing and was often met with a manly show of support, a cheer, a pat, maybe a thumping hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ung, good boy.&quot; Mr Ito said and then sliding out of me bowed comically to me. Ian burst out laughing, I knelt there dazed and giddy and cum drunk again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you... sir...&quot; I mumbled. Ian patted me on the head and then they left laughing and chatting on the way. I could hear Mr Ito faintly buckling his belt through the door.<br />
<br />
I staggered to my feet and smiled foolishly.<br />
<br />
Mmm, I thought Ito cum is pretty awesome! I knew I could say that now I have two points of reference!</p>
