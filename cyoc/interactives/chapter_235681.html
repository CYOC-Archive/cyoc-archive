<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff felt a wave pass over him and Kevin stared at Jeff in disbelief, torn between feelings of giddy delight and shame for changing his friend in ways he expected Jeff wouldn&#39;t love, initially.<br />
<br />
Having taken much longer to explore the machine with Jeff&#39;s profile, Kevin had found the creative transitions he could impose. It started with &quot;If target becomes severely injured...&quot; and Kevin&#39;s mind drifted to the rugged superhero who could heal through mortal wounds. Jeff will have a surprise if he ever gets in a bad car accident or bar fight but that&#39;s only where things started. <br />
<br />
Kevin had an unexpected reaction to the idea of his friend being able to take glassfuls of whiskey, ride a motorcycle, handle himself in bar fights, and even smoke cigars. Jeff&#39;s mental tweak to Kevin hadn&#39;t been long enough ago for Kevin to realize these new feelings were simply tied to Jeff.<br />
<br />
Kevin added friends with benefits to Jeff&#39;s profile on their relationship, being careful not to remove his heterosexuality, the idea of a polycule with Jeff bringing its own appeal. Kevin set all the changes to occur while he triggered them through giving Jeff oral. Kevin orchestrated everything, Then Jeff moved on the bed, complaining how long it was taking... Kevin snapped out of it, confused where all this was coming from... before he could carefully revert the unexpectedly pervy things Jeff grabbed the mouse and applied the settings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Kev, I was thinking we could hit the mall. The surrounding area.. oof, I feel it.&quot; Jeff shot a smile back at his friend... the boundary of Jeff&#39;s room being the first trigger. &quot;The surrounding area has good food places and we could check out a bar after our spending spree.&quot; Jeff had raced down the stairs grabbing his shoes.<br />
<br />
Kevin descended looking at his friend as his machinations came to pass... Jeff&#39;s foot slipped into his shoe, the second trigger. Jeff stood up, &quot;Ahh, man! I feel so... so... ready to explode... I need a minute, I need to be outside. Ugh!&quot; The feelings had been intensifying since stepping out of his room<br />
<br />
Rather than going to the car, Jeff went to the back deck as Kevin planned. Kevin  reached the sliding glass door, Jeff was distraught and confused, as he planned... the table and chairs now replaced with a lounger, chair, and outdoor coffee table.<br />
<br />
Kevin moved to the agitated boy, pulling him into a hug, his touch being the penultimate trigger before the cascade of transformations occur. Kevin&#39;s touch, the only thing that soothed the gnawing fire growing within Jeff. Reality warped once again, Jeff knew his  relationship with Kevin was friends with benefits but questioning that was the last thing on his mind.<br />
<br />
Kevin gently ushered Jeff to the lounger, &quot;Your transformation is almost done buddy. You&#39;re doing great.&quot; Jeff&#39;s physical changes hadn&#39;t actually started, though the process from here will be pleasurable. Kevin gently caressed Jeff&#39;s body soothing the fire and lulling him into a trance, Kevin moved to Jeffs shorts and with a quick jerk exposed his groin. <br />
<br />
Jeff, in a stupor, reached over to the cooler that had appeared, grabbing a beer and slid it against the bottle cap remover affixed to the underside of the coffee table. Kevin&#39;s exploratory touch eliciting waves of elation throughout Jeff&#39;s body. Jeff reached over grabbing a cigar from the box that appeared, he removed the tip like this wasn&#39;t his first time and lit it with the lighter sitting nearby.<br />
<br />
Jeff briefly questioned what he was doing and what was happening to him but Kevin&#39;s mouth touched his penis and the resulting shockwaves triggered the long awaited physical transformation and as intended, Jeff&#39;s personality shifted and merged with the newly added characteristics.<br />
<br />
Kevin&#39;s hands felt Jeff&#39;s fat melt away as he caressed Jeff&#39;s abdomen, and his muscles grew. He heard Jeffs voice deepen with each moan. Kevin was inexperienced and it took him a while to get Jeff off but as he did Jeff&#39;s transformation completed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks man. That felt great, I don&#39;t know why I felt so awful a moment ago but that set me straight.&quot; Jeff said. The different aspects of the reality changes effected Jeff&#39;s mind to varying degrees as part of Kevin&#39;s elaborate meddling. &quot;I&#39;ll be ready to go in a minute or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff took a heavy drag on his cigar and dropped the ash in the ash tray that had appeared and took the final swig of his beer, Kevin was now pent up having been moderately turned on while setting up the changes, now fully turned on at getting Jeff off. &quot;Hey, um, would you like to, uh, get me off before we go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I&#39;m not feeling it right now, but if you wanna take care of yourself, we can wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin was floored, he felt so small, ironic as he was actually taller than Jeff, but it somehow made him want Jeff more... They were friends with benefits, how could Jeff... No... Kevin realized he had only been editing Jeff&#39;s profile... Jeff&#39;s relationships... Jeff&#39;s relationship with Kevin had benefits. Kevin&#39;s relationship with Jeff was best friends.<br />
<br />
Kevin remembers catering to any time Jeff wanted to get off but wasnt in a relationship and couldn&#39;t find a willing woman, he also recalled receiving for Jeff, getting hand jobs, being caressed... but only when Jeff wanted to fuck something, only when Jeff wanted to feel like he could get someone off, only when Jeff wanted to be tender. Kevin was Jeff&#39;s fuck slave, but as much as it was one sided, he liked it.<br />
<br />
Jeff finished his cigar and stubbed out the butt, he bounced up ready to go. He sauntered into the house as his dad came in... &quot;Hope to be out late tonight dad.&quot; He called as Kevin scrambled to follow along shutting the door behind him. &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re driving.&quot; Jeff said eyeing his motorcycle, then Kevin&#39;s old car. &quot;Or we&#39;re going separate.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll drive.&quot; Kevin offered knowing Jeff would probably get shit faced if he doesn&#39;t start talking to a woman within the first 30 minutes of hitting the bar. And so their night began.</p>
