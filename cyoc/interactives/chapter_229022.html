<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brianna Smith walked through the front door of her and her wife’s house, she had to rub the bridge of her nose. She wanted nothing more now than to take a hot bath, light some candles and just relax. Seeing that the house was empty she decided she would do just that. <br />
<br />
She kicked off her shoes at the front door, placing her backpack in it’s normal spot by the front door. She had an whole outfit in the bag along with everything she would need to spend two days away from home. It wasn’t that she really wanted to live out of a bag, but as a nurse who happened to be on call more times than not she sometimes had to go out the door in a hurry more often then most people. <br />
<br />
She moved down the hall passed her 14-year-old son’s room and her 8-year-old daughter’s room before reaching the master bedroom at the end of the hall. Both kids were in school, and her wife Stacy would be getting out of the gym about now and had said last night she planned to do a few hours in the law office on a light day. <br />
<br />
She stepped into the master bedroom only to find it not dark but illuminated with multiple candles and sitting on the edge of the bed waiting for her was her wife, Stacy. She was dressed in a pair of black lingerie which showed off her rather large chest. It was actually Brianna’s favorite lingerie that her wife had, a black corset which covered her whole area from her breasts down with front facing white strings. A simple string bikini bottom. The top of the corset and bottom were covered with some white fur, the black fabric had white tiger strips on it giving an opposite pattern of a white tiger. Brianna had a thing for cats about ½ of her own lingerie had cat fur patterns on them.<br />
<br />
“Had a rough day? Maybe I can make it better.” offered Stacy in almost a purr as Brianna gave a playful smile back as she pulled off her hospital scrubs to show a simple black sports bra. She didn’t have the massive chest that graced her wife’s chest but they where a good B cup, she reached behind and undid her ponytail letting her golden blonde locks fall down to her shoulders. She closed the door and locked it, the kids weren’t suppose to be home for a few hours but better safe than sorry.<br />
<br />
“I did, but I can put in some more work.” said Brianna as she wondered what toys they would be using now. She didn’t know what the special occasion was for Stacy to pull out this set of lingerie and to take off work. Her mind raced for a moment trying to recall if it was any special event that she had forgotten about. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, you haven’t forgotten anything.” Purred Stacy as she beckoned her wife forward as she got off the bed and lead Brianna down so she was sitting down on the bed. <br />
<br />
She got on the bed, her knees on either side of her, but far enough back so there was some space between them. <br />
<br />
This was one of their favorite ways to start some fun in the bedroom. Brianna grinned as she prepared to undo the strings on Stacy’s corset front and “unwrap” her, maybe she would use her teeth to make this special event even more fun. However Stacy stayed back, which caused Brianna to look confused.<br />
<br />
“Brianna there is something I have to tell you.” Said Stacy “I lied to you about something.”<br />
<br />
“About what?” inquired Brianna thinking Stacy was cheating on her, cheating was the one deal breaker both had put forward when they started their relationship. For a moment her mind was racing, if Stacy was cheating how would it effect not only their kids but custody, Stacy had given birth to them but they had used sperm donated by Brianna’s very gay twin brother so they where all related biology but would the courts see it that way, Stacy was one hell of a lawyer she could easily…<br />
<br />
“I am not human.” Stated Stacy as Brianna paused mid thought and blinked. <br />
<br />
“Really?” laughed Brianna “Really funny Stacy but…”<br />
<br />
Brianna stopped laughing as her wife’s features began to change, she grew in size, not by much she was already tall for a women but she did grow at least 3 or 4 inches. Brianna’ was now eye level with her wife’s breasts which had grown at least a half a cup size and where straining against the corset. The real change however was her skin, her skin began to grow a large amount of white fur, some of the fur was thicker between the breasts but not all the fur was white. Black strips of fur were growing as well, a clear tiger pattern. She noticed movement behind her wife as a very long fur covered tail moving behind Stacy. <br />
<br />
Brianna’s eyes were as wide as dinner plates as she looked up, Stacy’s face had changed. It was still Stacy but now a feline nose, jaws and other facial features replaced the human ones. Rounded ears poked out of long black hair which remained the same. <br />
<br />
“I am a were-tiger.” Stated Stacy, her voice fearful as she waited to see how her wife would react to the news.</p>
