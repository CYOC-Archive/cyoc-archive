<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fredrika picked out a drop-dead gorgeous vixen costume. Emma found a cat costume that she liked. The two of them undressed and slipped into their costumes. Fredrika began to feel a tingling sensation. She could feel her waist thinning and her hips and boobs expanding. She also felt her face reshaping itself into a cute little muzzle. The costume then became her own pelt. The tingling stopped. Fredrika checked herself out; she was now a sleek, shapely anthro vixen. A bushy tail had grown just above her firm butt. She had a exquisite hourglass figure. It sure beat her old banana figure! She also now had a belly button piercing. In addition to her foxy fur, Fredrika had long ginger hair flowing from the top of her head down to her waist. But the biggest change was in her boobs: they had expanded from AA-cups to G-cups! She looked at Emma, who was now a beautiful anthro tabby cat. Her AA-cups were now E-cups. Emma now had auburn hair down to her shoulders. &quot;This is so cool!&quot; shouted Fredrika.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Emma, &quot;I never thought I could be this hot. And you're even hotter!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Fredrika, whose hand had strayed down to her clit. She began to pleasure herself, stroking and caressing her clit as the sensation built. Finally it ended in an explosive orgasm, sending waves of pleasure through Fredrika's body. &quot;I... think... my... sex... life... is gonna.. take... a... turn for the... better.&quot; She stammered so much because Toon World was beginning to replace her old human life with a new toon life that it had written for her and Emma. Fredrika was now Fredrika Beckingham, a teenaged vixen from a wealthy family. Emma had become Emma Darlington-Smythe, a tabby girl from the posh end of town. Their families had both just moved to this town, and the two girls were starting their first day in their new school. Their human lives had been completely erased from their memories (and those of anyone who knew them as humans).<br />
&quot;Fredrika, why on earth are we naked?&quot; asked Emma.<br />
&quot;I.. think I know,&quot; said Fredrika, &quot;When I found out you were a lesbian, I offered to 'play' with you a bit in the changing room before class 'cause I'm bi. Remember? I think I can still feel the aftershocks of the orgasm.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah!&quot; said Emma, &quot;How could I forget great sex like that?! Come on, Fredrika, We'll be late for class.&quot; They put on their clothes (which had changed from thrift store clothes to designer outfits) and ran off.<br />
<br />
While walking through the hall, Emma and Fredrika noticed an unpleasant scene. A poodle girl dressed head to toe in expensive furs noticed a fat elephant girl wearing a glass diamond necklace. &quot;Cute necklace, Becky. I have one just like it... only it's real.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'll get the last laugh when I make the cheerleading squad,&quot; said Becky.<br />
&quot;HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, good one! And I'm trying out for the sumo team! Say, why don't you try out for that? Your weight's just right.&quot; The two then went their separate ways, the poodle looking smug and Becky blushing. Fredrika and Emma couldn't believe what they had just seen.<br />
&quot;Who was that?&quot; Fredrika asked a jaguar boy standing near them.<br />
&quot;That was Giselle Chenard,&quot; said the jaguar, &quot;She's the queen bee of our school. She can be a real bitch when she wants to be, which is most of the time.&quot;<br />
&quot;Emma, we have got to dethrone that monster,&quot; said Fredrika, &quot;I could become the new queen bee and use my power to make the school a better place instead of using it to put people beneath me!&quot;<br />
&quot;That sounds like the plot of a cartoon,&quot; said Emma.<br />
&quot;And we are in?&quot; asked Fredrika.<br />
&quot;Shhh! Don't break the fourth wall!&quot; said Emma, &quot;Still, it could work.&quot;<br />
We have to do it,&quot; said Fredrika, &quot;It's the Beckingham way! You can be my sidekick. Every queen bee needs one. Over lunch, we can recruit my girl posse.&quot;<br />
<br />
After class, they headed to the cafeteria. It was full of girls. All Fredrika needed to do was pick out the classiest ones for her posse. &quot;First we need a sweetheart,&quot; she said, &quot;We're all going to be nice, but we need at least one girl whose niceness stands out.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why,&quot; asked Emma.<br />
&quot;Because it's a cartoon,&quot; said Fredrika, &quot;We need certain archetypes.&quot; Just then, a gorgeous doe came up to them.<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; she said, &quot;Welcome to our school. I'm Rebecca Frost. Since you're new here, I can give you a tour of the school before lunch break is over.&quot;<br />
&quot;Crap!&quot; shouted a girl, &quot;I forgot my lunch!&quot;<br />
&quot;That's okay,&quot; said Rebecca, &quot;Have some of mine.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think we found our sweetheart,&quot; said Fredrika.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Emma, &quot;She seems perfect.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey! Rebecca!&quot; called Fredrika.<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; said Rebecca.<br />
&quot;What do you think of Giselle Chenard?&quot; asked Fredrika.<br />
&quot;I can't stand the way she treats people,&quot; said Rebecca, &quot;We need a new queen bee!&quot;<br />
&quot;I can arrange that,&quot; said Fredrika,<br />
&quot;You can?&quot; asked Rebecca.<br />
&quot;I'm Fredrika Beckingham,&quot; said Fredrika.<br />
&quot;And I'm Emma Darlington-Smythe,&quot; said Emma.<br />
&quot;And we're both rich, pretty, and popular,&quot; said Fredrika, &quot;And we're gonna use it for everybody's benefit. We're going to overthrow Giselle Chenard and replace her dictatorship with benevolent rulership. We'd like you to be part of my girl posse. We need somebody as nice as you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; said Rebecca, &quot;I wanted to be friends anyway.&quot;<br />
&quot;Great, said Fredrika, &quot;Now let's build up the rest of the posse.&quot; Fredrika then noticed a very stunning squirrel. &quot;Who's that?&quot;<br />
&quot;That's Debbie Richards, the president of the drama club,&quot; said Rebecca, &quot;She's really nice. Drama's very big in this school. You should recruit her if you're planning to take on Giselle.&quot; Fredrika walked over to Debbie.<br />
&quot;Are you Debbie Richards?&quot; asked Fredrika, &quot;I'm Fredrika Beckingham, this is Emma Darlington-Smythe, and you already know Rebecca Frost. I intend to take down Giselle Chenard. I'll need you in my girl posse; will you join me in my quest?&quot;<br />
&quot;Absolutely!&quot; answered Debbie, &quot;Anything to knock that bitchy creep down a peg. As long as you're building up your posse, I think I'll introduce you to Bethany Hoyme, our resident party girl. Hey, Bethany!&quot; A cheerful-looking lioness walked up. &quot;Meet Fredrika and Emma. Fredrika's going to replace Giselle as the new queen bee, and...&quot;<br />
&quot;Ooh, can I help? Do you need me to join your posse? Of course you do! I'm in!&quot; Bethany said, &quot;Did you here about the dance next Tuesday? It's gonna be a blast! I'm going with Derrick!&quot;<br />
&quot;Welcome to the posse,&quot; said Fredrika, &quot;Now we need to find someone generic, but popular.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know, I know!&quot; shouted Bethany, &quot;Lucy Jones! Everybody adores that dalmatian! You'd love her, and she'd love you! Oh, there she is now!&quot; A dalmatian wearing sensible-but-smart clothes walked up.<br />
&quot;Oh, hi,&quot; Lucy said, &quot;I've never seen the two of you here before. I'm Lucy.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm Fredrika and she's Emma. We're on a quest to replace Giselle as queen bee.&quot;<br />
&quot;That nasty poodle who belittles all my friends? Count me in! Can Pandora join too?&quot;<br />
&quot;Pandora?&quot; asked Fredrika.<br />
&quot;Pandora Black. That's her over there,&quot; said Lucy. She pointed at a bat dressed from head to toe in Hot Topic stuff. &quot;I'm her only friend.&quot;<br />
&quot;Errm...&quot; said Fredrika.<br />
&quot;Remember,&quot; said Rebecca, &quot;you don't want to be like Giselle.&quot;<br />
&quot;You're right,&quot; said Fredrika, &quot;She can join.&quot; Fredrika approached the bat girl.<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; said Pandora, &quot;I'm Pandora. How are you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm great,&quot; said Fredrika, &quot;My name's Fredrika. My friends over there are Emma, Rebecca, Debbie, Bethany, and your buddy Lucy. You know, you seem pretty happy for a goth.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Pandora, &quot;Everybody seems to think that just because we bats have a goth style we must be freaks. You're only the second kid to talk to me after Lucy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Pandora,&quot; said Fredrika, &quot;I'm trying to become the new queen bee. Would you like to hang out with me and be one of the alpha girls?&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean that you're trying to dethrone Giselle Chenard?&quot; said Pandora, &quot;She's teased me relentlessly ever since I came here. I am so in!&quot;<br />
&quot;I think I have my posse, Emma,&quot; said Fredrika.<br />
