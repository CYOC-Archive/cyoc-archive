<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charlie sighed, wondering if there was anything more. He’d expected a clue or a riddle, but he didn’t see anything that would help him out. When he inspected the chests, he couldn’t see any discernible difference, which was the most maddening part of this <br />
<br />
It was obvious that this room was a trap, and while the gryphon head claimed that both of the chests were helpful, that was clearly a lie.  After all, why would a wizard just leave a powerful item in his own dungeon, for no other reason than to help his enemies?  <br />
<br />
Charlie tried pulling on the door, but it wouldn’t budge. He tried looking for a hidden switch or lever, but there was nothing there. Or at least nothing he could find.<br />
<br />
“Shit,” he thought to himself.  Trap or not, he’d obviously failed a roll at some point in this room, which meant that the only way out was to open one of those chests.  Would they each turn him into something different?  Or was his fate the same regardless of which he chose?<br />
<br />
He didn’t know.  What he did know, however, was that Veles still had one Trim left.  So, at the end of the day, his choice didn’t really matter.  He’d get turned into something horrible, per Finn’s directive, and then Veles would come save him. <br />
<br />
There was nothing for it. <br />
<br />
Thumbing the coin in his paw, he tossed it in the air – Tails. <br />
<br />
He walked over to the chest on the right side of the room and took out a dagger.  Pricking his finger with it, he wrote ‘I opened this chest, please turn me back when you solve the riddle – Charlie’ on the lid.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Charlie threw open the lid. Inside was a strangely squishy red interior that looked like velvet. Then a long tongue unfurled and eyes opened on the lid. Charlie attempted to leap away but the tongue shot out and stuck to his chest, the bulbous tip covered in an adhesive substance.<br />
<br />
“Mimic!” Charlie cried, trying to swing a dagger at the tongue.<br />
<br />
The mimic was too fast, it pulled him forwards and off-balance. His head entered the chest and muffled his terrified cries. Charlie managed to brace himself against the sides of the chest but couldn’t match the muscle power of the tongue. His paws slipped in, dagger clattering to the floor, followed by his torso, leaving his legs kicking wildly outside the mimic’s maw.<br />
<br />
Charlie experienced an odd feeling of deja vu before the tongue pulled him in tight and the lid of the chest snapped shut. The eyes of the mimic closed and the box started to rumble as it started its strange digestive process. <br />
<br />
Inside the mimic, Charlie was struggling.<br />
<br />
The “chest” might have been empty but it was cramped for the wolf, who tried pushing in every direction. The walls of the mimic’s stomach were soft and kinda rubbery. They stretched with every push, though never to the point of tearing. It was a monster whose entire body was basically a muscle it could shape at its whim.<br />
<br />
A strange liquid began to ooze through the wall. <br />
<br />
He couldn’t avoid it, and it splashed on his fur, saturating it and tingling on his skin. It made his body feel strangely numb. Then the mimic began to churn its insides. <br />
<br />
Charlie found his body being rolled around as the stomach of the mimic churned.<br />
<br />
The insides of the box grew tighter, the fleshy walls pulsing. Charlie found himself being forcibly twisted and pulled. He was swallowing gulps of the fluid, his mouth and insides growing as tingly and numb as his outsides. <br />
<br />
As the mimic’s innards writhed, Charlie felt himself bend unnaturally backward, snout thrusting into his twitching anus.<br />
<br />
He could smell his deep, familiar musk, and then his head was shoved deeper, sliding further into the musky passage. Charlie screamed, but all that came out was a gurgle, his lungs flattening as he was shoved past his chest into his own throbbing pucker. <br />
<br />
The wolf no longer needed to breathe, his body compressing and tingling.<br />
<br />
Charlie was having difficulty holding onto his thoughts. Between being rubbed against himself, the constant pleasurably numb tingles and squishing, he couldn’t do much but enjoy the ride. <br />
<br />
His cock was hard and throbbing, each pleasurable clench and squeeze of the mimic’s churning guts squeezing it longer and longer.<br />
<br />
Charlie let out an indignant grunt as his balls were pulled apart, and then he gasped as they were massaged and stiffened strangely. The tingles in his brain increased, numbing his thoughts, making it impossible for him to think of anything but the sensations, the churn, the rub.<br />
<br />
His head somehow popped back out of his rear, but everything was wrong, his head was compressed, and then all he felt were tingles and numbness….<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
With a pop of displaced air, a small brass ring clattered to the floor of Finn’s lair.<br />
<br />
Finn wasn’t paying attention, growling and writhing as his new kobold expertly sucked him off. His beautiful new kobold was so good, he might cum before the quest was even over! But another part of him didn’t want Erwin to stop, and he found his claws gently rubbing the little blue-scaled reptile encouragingly.<br />
<br />
The ring on the floor was vaguely aware, though Charlie was struggling to remember what had happened, the mimic’s digestive process had done a number on his poor organic brain.<br />
<br />
He could still see, in a strange fashion, from two lifeless gems set into the ring’s dull metal.  There was a dragon that looked awfully like Finn, but surrounding him was veritable palace, filled with expensive furniture and enclosed by marble walls.  Did that mean he was still in the game?<br />
<br />
With a roar, Finn came, anointing his newest kobold in his blessed draconic seed. The kobold basked in the hot cum tongue lapping it from the source with pure delight. Erwin rubbed his Master’s load into his scales, bathing himself in the musky ablution.<br />
<br />
“Th-that was good, little one.” Finn gasped, lying limply on his couch. <br />
<br />
The other kobolds were upon Erwin, licking the dragon’s cum off his new body. Erwin gasped and groaned as the cleaning became more sexual, and soon his had Dave’s pink cock in his mouth and Mike’s dick buried in his anal vent. Finn watched his new kobold get initiated into his growing clan with a smile.<br />
<br />
Then Finn glanced over at the floor, where a magic ring glittered on the stone.<br />
<br />
“Charlie?.” the dragon asked.<br />
<br />
Charlie wanted to shout Yes!, Its me!  Help!  But with his new ring body, all he could do was lay silently, no more alive than the marble tile below him.<br />
<br />
Charlie’s body felt so weird, he couldn’t feel his arms or legs, and his torso felt like it was bent over backwards to the point that his mouth was pressing up against his own ass.<br />
<br />
The dragon walked over to him, sticking a claw into the hole in the center of Charlie’s body, pressing up against the entirety of his ‘spine’ as the dragon slowly picked him up.  Charlie could only watch as he was brought up to its snout, while a huge reptilian eye carefully looked him over.<br />
<br />
“Must be…” the dragon droned out.<br />
<br />
“In case you couldn’t figure it out, I’m Finn,” the dragon said before puffing its shoulders out and spreading its wings.<br />
<br />
“And this!” the dragon pointed Charlie’s gem eyes out towards the room before rotating around it.<br />
<br />
“Is my lair!”  the dragon chuckled, “how do you like it?”<br />
<br />
But Charlie didn’t answer – he couldn’t answer.  He couldn’t do anything.<br />
<br />
Finn let out a sad grunt, “well, I suppose you’re not really in a position to comment.  I have to say, I was hoping to get to watch you fail.”<br />
<br />
Finn paused, “but I was a bit preoccupied, and I didn’t catch your last mishap.”<br />
<br />
Charlie felt himself begin to get pawned between Finn’s claws as the dragon slowly rotated his new, ring body between them, all while the room spun around him in a disorienting blur.<br />
<br />
“Well, bronze isn’t particularly valuable.” Finn said with a hint of disappointment in his voice, “you’re not worth keeping in my horde, or even giving to Erwin here.  So I suppose I’ll roll back time, just this once.”<br />
<br />
The ring had the sneaking suspicion Finn was only doing it to experience what appeared to be an amazing orgasm again. If it could roll its gemstone eyes it would. But at least he wasn’t going to be stuck as a ring forever. <br />
<br />
“Make good choices, sweetie!” Finn winked at the ring, “It’s time for you to…”<br />
<br />
