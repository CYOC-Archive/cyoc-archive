<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the ringing of the bell, Amy and Jennifer slipped their shoes back on, said goodbye to their friends, then proceeded to walk to their next class, study hall.  In truth, Jennifer was actually looking forward to it.  Yes, she and Amy had a history quiz coming up in the next period, but Jennifer found herself quite confident in her knowledge and knew she would ace it.  She was also pretty certain Amy was going to excel at the test as well, though she would probably decide to spend study hall going over the material, if anything just to pass the time.  As such, Jennifer planned to have a little bit of fun with Amy while she prepared. <br />
<br />
As the two girls walked to their lockers to exchange out their books, then started to walk to the library, Jennifer was surprised by a few observations.  Her first observation was how much she kept thinking of and hating her footwear.  Sure in her previous life, she, like any girl, liked shoes and had a collection of shoes for various different outfits, occasions, or fashions.  She was nowhere near some of the girls on the cheersquad, but she did have a healthy amount of options.  Now, she was fairly certain she only owned maybe two pairs of shoes, including the ones she currently wore, and she hated them.  They were stuffy, made her feet feel hot, and felt rather itchy honestly.  She wanted little more than to simply slip her feet out of her shoes and walk the rest of the way to the library in her socks.  The only thing that kept her from doing so was the fact that she didn&#39;t want to get her socks dirty and she did not want to risk getting a demerit for not following the school&#39;s rules.  <br />
<br />
Her next observation was just how much she kept on glancing around at other girls and oddly enough, other people&#39;s shoes.  Looking at other girls, well that was pretty obvious.  Now being a lesbian she looked at other girls, but with new eyes.  Had she always been so cute?  Did she always have such big boobs?  These questions were just the tip of the iceberg, though none of the girls dissuaded her from her love of Amy.  The more interesting thing was how she would occasionally glance down at a person&#39;s feet, both girl and guy and see if she could get a sense of what kind of socks they wore.  While she was far more interested in what the women wore, the sight of seeing the occasional guy in long, colored socks caught her attention.<br />
<br />
The last real observation she made a note of was how much of her old life was beginning to become vague or alien to her.  She could clearly remember being a part of the cheersquad, but she could no longer recall all of her squad-mates&#39; names.  She remembered having a boyfriend, but she could no longer remember his face and the idea of having a boyfriend grossed her out.  She could remember all the stances and dances of cheerleading, but even standing in one of those goofy poses for longer than a few seconds made her feel self-contentious and silly.  What&#39;s more, she was concerned that she, for the most part, did not seem that worried about losing her old life.  Sure she had lost something valuable, but she&#39;d gained a true friend and lover.  Perhaps this new experience could be just as good, if not better?<br />
<br />
As she thought this, Amy and she finally arrived at the school&#39;s library.  The East Watch High School Library was a fairly extensive building, containing several archives, several secluded tutor rooms, reading nooks, and even a second floor with large windows that let in plenty of light.  This gave the library a very welcoming aura that even students who were not heavy into reading found enjoyable and inviting.  Yet, this bright light also came with its dark shadows which is thankfully were a majority of the tutoring rooms were.  It was no secret that many of the tutoring rooms were just hook up spots for students due to their windows with curtains and non-lockable doors.  However, the administration could not do more to the rooms as they knew the students would riot.  As such, each tutoring room came with a small book rack, several simple yet comfy chairs, and a large, thick table with a metal pole rammed through the center of it.  The poles had been principal Strinder&#39;s idea, thinking the students could not have sex on the table if they could not lay on the tables.  No one bothered to tell the principal that many of students simply banged around the pole.<br />
<br />
Approaching the front desk, Amy and Jennifer greeted Margret, a young thirty-something, librarian.  Recently hired, Margret about a foot taller than Amy or Jennifer, wore a simple light-green top with long sleeves, a pink bow in the collar, tan skirt, black tights, and a pair of heels.  Seeing the girls enter, Margret quickly walked over to the front desk, her heels clicking and clacking along the floor.  Aside from that, Margret was a rather calm and cute blond with some light freckles along her cheeks.  <br />
<br />
Taking the lead, Amy spoke up, &quot;Afternoon Margret, here for the usual room if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Amy and Jennifer, so good to see you on this lovely day,&quot; answered Margret as she pulled out the sign in book.  &quot;You two know what to do.  And remember, no funny business.  I don&#39;t want to keep lying to my superior saying you two are working on some comedy act.  If you want to do...,&quot; at this Margret&#39;s cheeks blushed.  &quot;Well please wait to get home... okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see what we can do,&quot; answered Jennifer before Amy could answer.  Signing her name, Jennifer handed back the book and noticed a few things.  One, even though Mable was very cute, she wore no wedding ring meaning she was quite available.  This combined with the fact that Jennifer could tell Mable&#39;s heart rate had increased based on the warmth of her hands, confirmed Jennifer&#39;s suspicions that Mable was probably a lesbian, though she might not know it.  &quot;See you Mable,&quot; finished Jennifer as she spun towards the tutor rooms, gave Amy&#39;s butt a quick squeeze, and started walking her way.  Amy squeaked at the unexpected joy, but more interesting was that Mable squeaked as well.<br />
<br />
Amy and Jennifer happily made their way into the tutoring room where they quickly stepped in, closed the door, and pulled the blinds closed, much to Mable&#39;s chagrin.  Once inside, Jennifer did not so much as kick her shoes off and just step out of them, leaving them near the door like some useless pieces of trash. Looking down at her blue, green, and white striped feet, Jennifer cooed in delight and quickly bent down to roll up her jeans to about mid-calf, that way she could really show off the technicolor-ed feet.<br />
<br />
Turning to Amy, Jennifer&#39;s two minds were both surprised and not surprised to see Amy unbuttoning her shirt to reveal with neon pink undershirt underneath.  However, Jennifer was disappointed to see Amy had not discarded her shoes.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Amy,&quot; began Jennifer, &quot;Don&#39;t you want to, ya know?&quot; she said as she motioned to her discarded shoes.<br />
<br />
Amy looked over and smile.  &quot;Maybe in a bit, but right now I just want to get settled.  We do have that history quiz coming up next period.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jennifer sighed and walked over to the table with her backpack.  She quickly plopped down into a chair across from Amy, pulled out the material the history quiz would focus on, and began to run through it.  Dates, figures, and major events rolled over Jennifer and yet she found herself not so much internalizing as much as just reminding herself of what she was already fairly confident with.  <br />
<br />
Within five minutes of a fifty minute study hall, Jennifer had breezed through the material and was fairly confident she would ace the quiz.  Leaning back in her chair, even propping her socked feet on the table, Jennifer looked beyond her attention to Amy and smiled.  The girl across from her was quietly studying away, reading small snippets of information to herself, endeavoring to internalize anything that might be remotely important.  That was one thing Jennifer always respected Amy for.  Where others might see someone who was paranoid, Jennifer saw Amy as just through.  If you are going to do something, why do something poorly?  Why not take a few extra moments to really make sure you get it right?  That was one of Amy&#39;s many go to phrases whenever Jennifer talked about her study habits.  <br />
<br />
That said, Jennifer also knew Amy would be fine with the quiz and had from time to time, over studied.  As such, Jennifer knew what she needed to do.  While Amy was distracted with a particularly long passage, Jennifer made a show of dropping her pencil and slipping under the table after it.  Quickly brushing the pencil aside, Jennifer moved to her true goal, Amy&#39;s shoes.  Thankfully, Amy had not retied her shoes since the cafeteria, so they were already falling off.  Shifting her weight to her knees, Jennifer carefully slide herself into reach of Amy&#39;s feet.  Amy sat with her left leg over her right, leaving her left foot elevated.  Gingerly, Jennifer reached out for the heel of Amy&#39;s left shoe.  Pulling swiftly, Jennifer revealed Amy&#39;s foot clad in.........</p>
