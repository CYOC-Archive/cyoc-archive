<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maybe Jamie should&#39;ve thought twice about taking a strange pill. He didn&#39;t know it, but the pill he was given was not meant to give him a transformation like Charlie&#39;s. Charlie had chosen to become a new superhero and had seen a possible monster to fight in Jaime.<br />
<br />
Jamie began to sweat and thought that maybe the pill was having a bad effect on his body. He thought he should go throw it up but it was too late . . . its toxins were already working on his DNA transforming him from the inside into something that this world had not seen outside of legends . . . something a hero like Charlie could fight!<br />
<br />
Jamie&#39;s fingers  were going numb. Actually, his whole hands felt numb, like he had sat on them. He brought them up and saw them change before his eyes. His fingers began to grow longer and thicker, just like his palms. They became rough, his knuckles bulging out, thick claws stretching from every digit! He tried to scream, feeling like he was having a nightmare and that would wake him up. New thickness in his neck drowned his scream, and it was barely a grunt. Hair began to grow all around him, starting from his chest and pubes but spreading throughout his entire body! His shoulders, back, arms and legs began to become covered in a forest of white hair that became denser on his forearms, shins and chest. His hands had grown to five times their size, and felt too heavy, until he noticed that his wrists were growing as well to match the new width of his monstrous hands. Everything about him was GROWING thicker and LONGER.<br />
<br />
Jamie brought his giant hand to his shoulder and saw that it was much bigger than before. He could barely bend his arms, as every muscle beneath the thick mat of fur was exploding with mass, bones thickening and enlongating. The hugely tall yeti-like creature Jamie was becoming suddenly shot upwards even higher and he knocked his head on the twelve-foot high ceiling, causing him to grunt loudly. He saw his feet had become as big as his giant hands. They had become as big as school desks, with incredibly broad  toes tipped with powerful claws and covered in white hair. Then, when he was beginning to look lanky, his body began to grow wider and wider. His traps swallowed his neck, shoulders exploded to the sides. His extremely long, extremely thick hairy arms had become colossal weapons of destruction that wanted to be used. Jamie brought his hands to his face and felt it changing. His brow grew into a white shelf that made him look furious. His eyes turned yellow and his jaw became thick and square. Enormous fangs grew from his every teeth, especially his lower canines, which jutted out from his lower lip! He had grown a long thick mane that flowed all the way down to his enormous back, and a thick beard that fell down to his chest. Beneath the mat of hair covering his crotch, he felt his manhood grown to proportion of his beastly body, a powerful shaft that could fuck anything.<br />
<br />
When the transformation was coming to an end, he was leaning down just to fit inside his room. His outward transformation had made a mess of the room. He suddenly became lucid again and looked at his hands. He had become some kind of yeti, only much bigger, much stronger. The width of his upper body wouldn&#39;t fit in sewage pipes, and his legs and powerfully large feet could stomp a fully grown hippo into a pulp. He screamed in horror and the defeaning roar that came from his mighty chest shattered the nearest window. The floor beneath him was beginning to groan, not able to hold the 2500 lb monstrosity.<br />
<br />
The monster Jamie was starting to shake, terrified of itself and wondering if he would ever return to being human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brother there&#39;s something in the house!&quot; said Timmy as he ran into the room. His little brother, who was now no bigger than Jamie&#39;s hair-covered calf, screamed when he saw the monster in his house and peed himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Timmy ith me!&quot; Jamie tried saying but his fangs got in the way. He bit his tongue. &quot;Timmy I donth knoth what happenth!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the floor gave way and the giant wendigo fell through, landing on the floor below, shattering everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie!!&quot; Timmy yelled and looked down the hole in the floor!<br />
<br />
In his shock, Jamie tried getting up and the floor began to groan again. Crying, feeling like a pathetic monstrosity, Jamie began crawling out of the house, having to break the doorway with his enormous shoulders to exit to the lawn. He didn&#39;t know that the pill wasn&#39;t yet done with him!</p>
