<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah sighed, glancing over several personal files strewn across her desk. Being the director of a new government agency was certainly tedious. <br />
<br />
With funding now readily available, Sarah had been tasked with bringing in agents who she believed would be the right candidates. Unfortunately, it was proving harder than Sarah envisioned. Yes, she had many qualified agents she could bring in from various agencies but, who could be trusted and who would actually believe it? &quot;Morning Agent McMillan.&quot; Sarah glanced up from her work, a small smile spreading across her face as Jacob Moreland entered her office. &quot;Morning Jacob,&quot; she said. &quot;I take it things have gone smoothly on your end?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean did I give all the information I have on the supernatural to Greg and Michelle,&quot; he àsked. &quot;Yeah, they&#39;re just putting it on the hard drive. You should know though, I do keep some secrets to myself.&quot; Sarah simply nodded, once more perusing the personal files of perspective agents. While Jacob had given over a plethora of information on supernatural creatures, he was holding onto the secrets of demon hunting. Those, as he explained, were family secrets. Providing information on vampires, werewolves, and demons was one thing. Secrets about demon hunting were a completely different topic. &quot;You look like you got alot on your mind Sarah,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m supposed to bring in at least fifty agents to help staff this agency,&quot; Sarah sighed. &quot;When it was just Greg, Dave, and Michelle it was one thing. Now, trying to find fifty people to not only trust but work with? It&#39;s proving to be overwhelming.&quot; Jacob nodded, offering his assistance as he now began to peruse several personal files. After a few moments, the elderly hunter paused before grabbing an additional file. &quot;These two,&quot; he stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay why,&quot; Sarah asked, glancing at the files in Jacob&#39;s hand. &quot;Also, one of them has been on comp for the last couple of months. So why them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they were partners,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;Also just reading through real quick I see they were attacked in the West Virginia wilderness while trying to track down a drug factory. Says they were attacked by a wild animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay yeah but I&#39;m still not following.&quot; Jacob now pointed to the agents file. &quot;Check out the one who returned to work,&quot; he said. &quot;Last couple of months she&#39;s been taking a week off every month.&quot; Sarah shrugged, still not seeing the connection. &quot;Also her partner,&quot; he stated. &quot;Check out the doctors reports. His injuries have healed but he&#39;s claiming PTSD and a quote debilitating illness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably trying to milk the system,&quot; Sarah stated. &quot;You&#39;d be amazed how many guys try to milk comp, especially in the summer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or they&#39;re werewolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah paused, raising an eyebrow as she curiously gazed at the retired hunter. &quot;Come again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got a good feeling their infected with lycanthropy,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;Just glancing at the reports it states they were attacked by, what they describe, as a large rabid animal. Chances are they got bit, one of them more severely wounded than the other, which is why he&#39;s still out. The woman, she figured out something was wrong pretty quickly. Thats why shes been taking vacation time and I guarantee if you check the dates she took, they would coincide with the full moon.&quot; Sarah glanced at the reports and while Jacob&#39;s theory made sense, it was still hard to fathom. Then again, only a couple of months ago she would have dismissed this all together. &quot;So what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you should bring them in for an interview,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe let me talk with them, and if they ask I can cure them.&quot; Sarah nodded, it couldn&#39;t hurt, especially when they had over 10 years experience as DEA officers. &quot;Well two down and only forty eight to go,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Any other suggestions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not Cole Harris?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sgt. Harris,&quot; Sarah asked in surprise. &quot;He&#39;s a civilian now. What makes you think he&#39;d want to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t but he&#39;s had way more experience dealing with this kind of thing than anyone else besides myself here,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;And from what I heard his service record was pretty impressive. Wouldn&#39;t hurt to ask him.&quot; Sarah nodded, thanking Jacob for his incite. Despite the retired hunters reluctance to help at first, he was proving to be a valuable asset. &quot;Jacob,&quot; she said. &quot;I appreciate the help, which is why I really need some assistance with something else.&quot; Jacob paused, casting the agent a curious look as she began to explain.<br />
<br />
Although her original team was adjusting to their new rolls, Sarah was worried about their youngest member Michelle. Ever since the first assignment, Michelle had been distracted. Something was bothering the young agent, yet she had been quiet about what that was. Considering Sarah&#39;s original team would become her most trusted advisors, she need them to be open with her. &quot;Somethings bugging her and I just can&#39;t figure out what, &quot; she said. &quot;I was hoping if the two of us asked, she would say what it is.&quot; Jacob nodded, after so many years hunting, it was best to be open with one another.<br />
<br />
Michelle bit her lip as she stared at Hee computer screen. After all her research, she was still torn about what to do with Duchess Jenkins.<br />
<br />
According to the information she had received from Jacob, vampires were soulless demons, possessing the body of deceased humans like suits. A vampire possessed the memories of the person they once were, but that was it. The person they were was dead. Still, after talking briefly with Duchess, Michelle felt that wasn&#39;t quite true. She had read other sources, some saying that in a way vampires were still that person, just lacking a soul. These sources were rare, which only added to her anxiety. What if a part of Duchess Jenkins still existed? And what should Michelle say to Wanda?<br />
<br />
&quot;Michelle you got a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle glanced up from her computer screen, seeing Sarah and Jacob looking at her. Anxiously nodding, the young agent now nervously stood as she followed the pair into a small conference room. Closing the door, Sarah now offered her colleague a concerned glance. &quot;Is everything okay Michelle,&quot; she asked. &quot;You seem tense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its just been alot of stress trying to get S.P.E.A.R&#39;s databases up and running, &quot; Michelle sighed. Sarah nodded, studying her young protégé carefully. &quot;Michelle,&quot; she asked. &quot;Can I be honest with you?&quot; Michelle nodded, nervously glancing between the pair as Sarah continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Michelle something is definitely bothering you,&quot; she said. &quot;I know we&#39;re all under alot of stress lately, trying to get S.P.E.A.R off the ground but, we can&#39;t have any personal secrets that could jeopardize the agency. When everything settles down, I&#39;m going to rely on you heavily. You, Greg, Dave, even Jacob, we started this so we have to be honest if something is bothering you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand Director McMillan,&quot; Michelle stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Sarah smiled. &quot;Now, can you tell me why you&#39;ve been so anxious lately? And please, don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s because of the work. I already know it&#39;s something else.&quot; Michelle bit her lip, fidgeting under Sarah and Jacob&#39;s gaze. She had always tried to do the right thing, follow directions, her drive for perfection a blessing and a curse. Sarah had trusted her to actually bring her on as a founding member of S.P.E.A.R, the last thing she wanted to do was let her down. Sighing, she lowered her head, an almost defeated look washing over her. &quot;Director McMillan does the name Duchess Jenkins mean anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
Over the next fifteen minutes, Michelle let loose with a torrent of information. Everything from Wanda, to her encounter with Duchess and Cassandra, to her own research. It felt cathartic for the young agent to finally let loose with everything that had brrn troubling her. Sarah, for her part was understanding. Jacob though, had a much gruffer response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your friends sister is dead,&quot; Jacob said flatly. &quot;The thing you were talking too was a demon with her memories. It&#39;s best to tell your friend her sisters gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But she&#39;s not gone,&quot; Michelle insisted. &quot;Duchess is alive. How can I tell Wanda her sister&#39;s dead when I saw her with my own two eyes!&quot; As Jacob was about to reply, Sarah interrupted, calmly asking Jacob to allow her to speak. &quot;Michelle,&quot; she said softly. &quot;I understand wanting to give your friend some good news but, Duchess is gone. Besides, how would you explain a vampire to a civilian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t S.P.E.A.R trying to set up some sort of diplomatic ties with various supernatural communities,&quot; Michelle asked. &quot;Why couldn&#39;t our initial outreach be to the vampires?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because all people are to vampires is cattle, &quot; Jacob grumbled. &quot;If all of us tried going to their homeland it&#39;d be like ringing the dinner bell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re telling me no one can enter their homeland at all,&quot; Michelle asked. Jacob paused, sighing, which drew Sarah&#39;s attention. &quot;What,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically there are two who could enter their homeland and not worry,&quot; he sighed. &quot;But they&#39;re just kids! I don&#39;t want to put them at risk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wouldn&#39;t hurt to ask,&quot; Sarah said. Jacob grumbled, asking for a moment as he now pulled out his cellphone. Hopefully Caleb had Dukes number, he was about to ask Duke and Nat for a very big favor.</p>
