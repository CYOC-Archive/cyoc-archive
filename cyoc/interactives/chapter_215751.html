<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The DnD dungeon is sent to my editor, it&#39;s 21 pages, so he&#39;s gonna take a few days. So I&#39;m using the downtime to write random chapters. Any chapters you wanna see more of, drop me a DM.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Where do you think you&#39;re goin&#39;, Axe-hole?&quot; Jeremy snarled from behind him, his massive paw shot out the door and stopped the &#39;Alpha&#39; wolf in his tracks. Axel gulped as he watched the huge white wolf squeeze his way out of the door, his devilish grin joined by Austin&#39;s from behind.<br />
<br />
Axel whimpered in terror, tail tucked between his legs, as the two massive wolves glowered down at him, growling, saliva dripping from their fanged chops.<br />
<br />
“Tch, he doesn’t even know what he’s done.” Austin said, the red wolf rumbling a laugh.<br />
<br />
“W-what?” Axel asked.<br />
<br />
Jeremy reached behind him with one clawed hand…<br />
<br />
And handed Axel his backpack.<br />
<br />
“You forgot this at your desk, Alpha!” Jeremy said brightly, his tail wagging.<br />
<br />
“Ah…thanks?” Axel said, taking the backpack from the massive white wolf.<br />
<br />
He was nearly bowled over by Austin’s red furred form as he rushed past him with a sudden eagerness.<br />
<br />
“Gym time!’ Austin said, the red wolf prancing around the two other wolves happily, his tail wagging and claws clicking the linoleum. “Gym time, gym time!”<br />
<br />
Axel was a little taken aback at how energetic Austin was behaving, but his tail was wagging as the red wolf’s enthusiasm caught on. That’s right, Austin and Jeremy had gym at the end of the day, just before football practice.<br />
<br />
“You guys have fun, I have AP Bio.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Austin’s tail dropped. “I thought you had gym with us now.”<br />
<br />
“He does,” Jeremy nudged Axel, “Here, your dad handed me this on my way out.”<br />
<br />
Axel took two pieces of paper from Jeremy’s big paws.<br />
<br />
One of them was his class schedule and the other… was a signed permission slip from the head coach. Axel’s tail started to wag. He was on the football team! Axel would be starting practice tonight!<br />
<br />
Austin and Jeremy were basically pulling him along as they walked to the next class. They passed the corridor to the labs and science classrooms. Wait, were they actually taking him to the gym?<br />
<br />
Axel looked at his schedule and his eyes practically bulged out of his head.<br />
<br />
All of his classes were gone! No AP Bio, no AP English, all of his classes had been replaced with the easier ones. He was in Advanced Trigonometry, so why was he in Remedial Math now? That was for dumb jocks who couldn’t keep their grades up! <br />
<br />
No, no, no! All of his fun classes like Home Ec were shop classes now, too!<br />
<br />
“Oh wow!” Austin said, his tail wagging as he read the class schedule  over Axel’s shoulder, “you’re in all our classes!”<br />
<br />
“Remedial math?!” Axel found himself growling.<br />
<br />
Austin’s ears flattened, “Sorry Alpha. I…I don’t like math. The numbers don’t like me either.”<br />
<br />
“And why am I in mechanics class? I don’t have a car!”<br />
<br />
“You can help me repair mine!” Jeremy chortled, slapping Axel on the back. “I’ll take drive where ever you want, Alpha!”<br />
<br />
Axel wanted to scream.  “That’s it, no way!”<br />
<br />
He ran, breaking away from his canine companions and rounded the corner-<br />
<br />
-And ran straight into his best friend, TJ.<br />
<br />
The impact sent them both sprawling. Books and papers flew everywhere. Both young men stumbled back, though Axel was able to stay on his paws whereas TJ landed on his plush rump, thick black-framed glasses askew.<br />
<br />
TJ was a fat young man who liked wearing t-shirts referencing his geeky hobbies, though he’d been gaining weight recently so they rarely fit. Not that Axel minded, he thought his plush friend was cute when he was stuffed into clothes that barely fit him. Axel would never tell TJ that, of course. <br />
<br />
Axel looked down at TJ as he struggled to his feet and sighed with relief. Thank god, he could talk to TJ, tell him all about the weird things going on with him today. <br />
<br />
But when TJ managed to adjust his glasses and peer up at Axel, his face was screwed up in horror.<br />
<br />
“Axel! It was an accident, I-I wasn’t watching where I was going!”<br />
<br />
Axel frowned, stepping back. “TJ? Why are you looking at me like that?”<br />
<br />
“Ah! Sorry, I wasn’t looking at you the wrong way!” TJ squeaked.<br />
<br />
“TJ, why would I hurt my friend?” Axel asked quietly.<br />
<br />
“Friend?” TJ stared up at the wolf, his jaw dropping. “We’re not FRIENDS! You and your pack are always picking on me!”<br />
<br />
Axel was dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
He would never hurt TJ! He kinda had a boyhood crush on him, and not just because of his appearance, but because he was so nice to him. Helped in homework and was always giving Axel his milk.<br />
<br />
“But you help me with schoolwork and give me your chocolate milk every lunch period… “ Axel said, confused.<br />
<br />
“Your goons beat me up if I don’t!” TJ said, voice hard. “How don’t you know that?”<br />
<br />
Axel’s stomach dropped.<br />
<br />
He was about to apologize, tell TJ he was sorry, when Austin and Jeremy rounded the corner. They took in the situation instantly, going form the boy on the floor to the papers and books scattered everywhere. Axel realized what was about to happen and tried to hold the two back, but they moved too quickly for him to do anything.<br />
<br />
“What the hell did you do with our Alpha!” Jeremy growled, the massive wolf upon TJ faster than Axel could blink.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, nerd!’ Austin snarled, lifting the fat kid up and slamming him against the lockers on the wall. “You’re dead meat!”<br />
<br />
“Wait, don’t hurt him!” Axel cried.<br />
<br />
“Eh? He needs to be punished, Alpha.” Austin said over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“S-sorry Axel, I didn’t mean to run into you!” TJ wailed. “Please don’t hurt me!”<br />
<br />
The hallway was starting to be filled with students going to their last class of the day.<br />
<br />
Jeremy seemed to have noticed the glances the other students were giving them<br />
<br />
“Alpha is right. Too many witnesses.” Jeremy strode to a classroom that was empty, the lights off.<br />
<br />
“It’s locked,” Axel said as he gathered up all the dropped items. <br />
<br />
There was a crunch and the wolf pulled the knob-lock and all-out of the door, then opened it. Austin tossed TJ in, who managed a squeak before Jeremy followed. Axel hurried in after them and shut the door.<br />
<br />
“So…” Jeremy growled, cracking his paws and advancing on the cower human, “What should we do to you?”<br />
<br />
“Please!” TJ whined.<br />
<br />
“Don’t hurt him!” Axel strode forward, placing a paw on Jeremy’s massive shoulder.<br />
<br />
The wolf paused.<br />
<br />
Austin turned to Axel. “You don’t want us to hurt him? Then how should we put him in his place?”<br />
<br />
Axel grimaced, his ears lowered. How would he deal with this? The two wolves were looking at him expectantly. It was clear that he needed to do something.  They weren’t taking no for an answer.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you…” Axel paused, wondering what would be a good punishment.<br />
<br />
Then he remembered the day he’d come over to TJ’s to play some games and found his browser open.<br />
<br />
TJ had been looking at pictures of furries. More specifically, a drawing of a anthropomorphic wolf sitting on his couch, his paw stretched towards the viewer in detail, beads of sweat dripping from it. The caption beneath said something like ‘Go on, clean it’.<br />
<br />
“Alpha?” Jeremy asked, shaking TJ. “We beating his ass?”<br />
<br />
“No.” A grin curled Axel’s muzzle. He tried to look as evil as possible. “Pull up a chair for me.”<br />
<br />
Austin obliged. <br />
<br />
Axel sat down on it and beckoned TJ forward. Jeremy tossed him at Axel’s feet.<br />
<br />
“Kneel.” Axel said, trying to speak in a deep, commanding voice. <br />
<br />
TJ knelt, looking up at him, fear in his eyes. “W-what now?”<br />
<br />
A shadow crossed the door of the empty classroom. <br />
<br />
Axel turned and thought he saw his dad pass by, the anthro wolf’s silhouette unmistakable. He held his breath and the figure moved on down the hall. Probably to the Teacher’s Lounge, which was down this hall.<br />
<br />
“Axel?” TJ asked.<br />
<br />
Axel turned and extended a paw. <br />
<br />
“Go on. Clean it!” Axel demanded.<br />
<br />
TJ blushed. “I-I don’t know-”<br />
<br />
“Use your tongue, slut.” Axel growled, flexing his toes in what he hoped was a tantalizing manner.<br />
<br />
TJ’s nose twitched and he sniffed the air. That blush deepened, and he bent forward and tentatively licked Axel’s pawpads. Axel flinched-it kinda tickled- but held steady.<br />
<br />
“Lick it like you mean it, pup!” Axel grinned, pressing his paw into TJ’s face.<br />
<br />
He watched TJ’s run his warm, slippery tongue back and forth along the underside of his toepads, flicking up the claw, and back down again. He linger, sucking on Axel’s splayed toes like they were tiny cocks, and Axel found his cock swelling hotly erect. He noticed that’s TJ’s tent hadn’t gone down.<br />
<br />
With his other foot, he gently rubbed his old friend’s crotch.<br />
<br />
“Nnnf!” TJ Groaned, bucking his hips, thrusting his crotch desperately into Axel’s paw, a growing wet stain spreading across his crotch.<br />
<br />
“I think that fucker likes it!” Jeremy barked a laugh.<br />
<br />
“What a total paw-slut!” Austin agreed.<br />
<br />
Axel glanced over at them and saw they were stroking themselves off to the sight of their Alpha dominating the fat nerd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, is it punishment if he likes it?&quot; Austin asked, pausing mid-stroke on his throbbing cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;No guys, he totally hates it!&quot; Axel insisted, nudging TJ&#39;s crotch, &quot;right, TJ?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nff! Mmm, yeah, ugh, I hate it, so stinky,&quot; TJ moaned, suckling on Axel&#39;s toes, &quot;yuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
The fat boy continued to rub and caress Axel’s paws. Axel switched feet, making sure to grind his paw into TJ’s groin all the while. His friend was huffing at his feet and massaging the pads nicely. <br />
<br />
“You like being my paw-slut, TJ?” Axel asked quietly.<br />
<br />
TJ just let out a surprisingly canine whine and continued to nuzzle Axel’s paw.<br />
<br />
That sound- that pathetic whine-it did something for Axel. It drove him into a frenzy. He had to HAVE TJ, posses him. Axel suddenly felt flushed, his cock hard and twitching, but there was something else. His mouth was filling up with hot, thick saliva. <br />
<br />
The saliva made his mouth feel numb and tingly.<br />
<br />
Axel opened his maw, thick streamers of drool falling from his black lips and panting tongue onto the floor, sizzling and spitting when it hit the linoleum.<br />
<br />
He found himself leaning forward, eyes on the TJ’s soft, plump shoulder, tongue licking his chops hungrily. His maw opened wider and he-<br />
<br />
“Alpha, stop!” Jeremy lunged, pulling Axel back.<br />
<br />
Axel whined and growled, snapping the air.<br />
<br />
“Hold him, Austin!” Jeremy yelped as Axel bit his shoulder. <br />
<br />
Then Austin was on him and Axel couldn’t move, the two wolves pinning him to the floor. <br />
<br />
After a few more minutes, his struggles ceased and the strange drool ceased flowing from his mouth. Axel lay on the cool tile floor, panting. He was feeling a bit woozy, unsure of what had just happened.<br />
<br />
“Gosh, close call there.” Jeremy said, patting Axel and helping him to his paws.<br />
<br />
“You really wanted to add that fat nerd to our pack, Alpha?” Austin said.<br />
<br />
Axel blinked, wondering what the haze that had dropped over his vision had been. “W-what?”<br />
<br />
“The Bite.” Jeremy said. “You were gonna turn that dweeb into a wolf like us! Man, I get it was exciting, but…”<br />
<br />
Wait, he can bite someone and turn them into a wolf? Axel glanced down at TJ, who was whimpering. His crotch was soggy. Axel smirked. Maybe he owed his old friend that much.<br />
<br />
“You’re right.” Axel said, looking at his two packmates. “But think about it. We need someone we trust to do our homework for us, and later help us with other things. My dad always said a pack doesn’t work on muscles alone.”<br />
<br />
“Sure, right, but him?” Jeremy asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I see where you’re coming from, but seriously, TJ?” Austin cocked his head.<br />
<br />
“I think you two underestimate him. Let’s see how gym goes.” Axel said. “Get up, TJ!”<br />
<br />
TJ scrambled to his feet.<br />
<br />
“C-can I go then? I have to get to gym class.”<br />
<br />
“What a coincidence,” Axel grinned, wiping the last of the strange spittle from his maw. “Me too.”<br />
<br />
TJ blushed and looked away.<br />
<br />
Axel placed a heavy arm around the fat boy, making sure his armpit was close. He knew his musk would drive TJ wild. And sure enough, the fat kid started snuffling, his damp shorts tenting. <br />
<br />
“Let’s go boys,” Axel said, feeling oddly proud.</p>
