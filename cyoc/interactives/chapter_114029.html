<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite some thinking, I had always wondered what it would be like to be the little brother of the family. I had no interest in being a baby again, but I still wanted to try being the little brother to both of my sisters. I eventually settled on being 6 years old in body and to the world except my family. Okay, so I also allowed some mental changes as well; I just kept my awareness and memories intact. As I clicked &#39;save&#39;, I felt just a little bit of excitement at the thought of being young again, even just for this week. I hurried over to the bathroom mirror as I felt my body tingle.<br />
<br />
I face the mirror only to see that I had already started shrinking, although not by much. My muscles started losing their definition, and it didn&#39;t take long until whatever body hair I had to begin with started to recede as well. I looked about 14, but I was getting a little impatient as I felt like I was gradually sitting down. Before I knew it, my height started dipping rapidly as I was starting to look like I was in middle school. My face was starting to look more round and my shoulders more narrow. Whatever signs of puberty I still had left were quickly melting away, and I also noticed that even my clothes have changed! My shirt must be at least one size smaller now, my waist size much smaller, and that was just the beginning. &quot;Holy crap! I really do look different now!&quot; I exclaimed in a much higher voice, one that sounds like a preteen. I then grasped my throat and noticed the missing adams apple. &quot;Unbelievable! My voice is high again!&quot; I said before my jaw dropped at the sound of my younger voice. It was then that I noticed a major difference with my teeth as they never really settled down when I was younger until I had braces at 13. At this point, I could easily pass for 12 or even 11. I was slightly jumping in excitement, as if a newfound surge of energy starting going through me.<br />
<br />
As I started to go below 5&#39;, I decided to see how my former manhood is dealing with the changes. Zipping down my now smaller cargo pants and expanding my tighty-whites (which used to be a pair of boxers), it was exposed. My member was bare and it was much smaller. Not to mention that it was impressive to begin with. I tried to touch it, only to find that it is more sensitive to the touch. &quot;Wow,&quot; I exclaimed in a voice that was even higher, &quot;I&#39;m really gonna be little again.&quot; As I stared at the grinning 10 year old in the mirror, I started to really feel my maturity bleed out of me. I still retained my memories past 4th grade, but as far as I now know, I&#39;m now just as smart as one of them. Hell, I even feel 10 right now, with my interest in girls out the door, my common sense being reduced to that adopted by a 4th grader, and not to mention the cartoons that I am somehow obsessed with.<br />
<br />
My clothes morph again as I end up 9 years old again, only 1 year older than Rebecca. I lifted up my Batman t-shirt to see my not-so-impressive upper body, which needed some work to begin with. However, its current status is a far cry from what I had this morning. &quot;I&#39;m officially a shrimp now! This is amazing!&quot; I exclaimed, while enjoying my even higher voice. I started to laugh in ecstasy at my continued shrinking, especially as I passed age 8, becoming Rebecca&#39;s equal. Baby teeth started returning at a faster rate with the front teeth prominent and still remaining, albeit budding in my jaws. I had also adopted the selfish phase I had at this age until my parents snapped me out of it. Hopefully I won&#39;t have to go through the spanking again, especially sine the feeling suddenly became too familiar.<br />
<br />
As I continued to shrink, I found myself standing on a stool that was never there; it must be almost over, and I&#39;m now younger than both of my sisters. Near the end, I started to form a little belly; my baby fat is coming back. My old instinct would be to work it off, but now that I&#39;m 7 again, I&#39;m now not worried about my shape. Less than a minute later, the shrinking stops and I&#39;m really 6 years old again. A big grin appears on my face as I stare at the soon-to-be first grader with the SpongeBob t-shirt, colored shorts and socks, and undergo in the mirror. This is me for the week, and I don&#39;t have a care in the world.<br />
<br />
Before I could leave to see what changed in my room, I was startled by the door opening, only to see Rachel enter. &quot;Michael, is that really you?&quot; Rachel asked, to which I excitedly nod. &quot;Well, I guess this is what mom meant when she said you&#39;re gonna be different this week.&quot; Rachel replied. It didn&#39;t feel weird at all that I had to look up at Rachel. In fact, I somehow look up to her now. &quot;Do you mind if I ask how old you are now?&quot; Rachel asked. &quot;This many!&quot; I replied while holding up 6 fingers, before finding myself smothered by her. &quot;Sorry Mikey...er...Michael, you&#39;re just so cute now, you know, like this,&quot; Rachel said shortly before letting go. I then walked out, knowing that she might need to use the bathroom. I was told she needed it for &#39;grown-up&#39; stuff, which I no longer understand.<br />
<br />
As I walked back into my room, I was greeted with several changes. The queen sized bed was replaced with a twin bed with bedsheets that have a racer design. The wubby that I remembered having until I was 7 returned. The walls were transformed to baby blue and orange with the posters completely gone. Also gone was my TV, replaced with a mountain of toys, which suddenly look more appealing now. Despite my temptations to play with them, I noticed that my computer from when I was older remained with the Chronivac present. I immediately checked the results of my change.<br />

&quot;I&#39;m really a first grader again,&quot; I stated, elated to hear how high my voice had become, &quot;I like this so far! This is cool!&quot; Well, I did tell my parents it was only gonna be for the week, but I can stay like this longer if everyone, including me, likes the new arrangement. My inner child then kicked in suddenly and I found myself playing with the new Lego set I somehow got earlier.</p>
