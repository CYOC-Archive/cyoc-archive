<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The drunken knight Sir Trovan stood shocked sober in my room as I held an arrow to his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen Princess,&quot; he slurred, &quot;I just seem to have walked in on the wrong lass is all. There was a girl down <br />
there giving me the eyes and I must have mistook her for your maiden o'er there!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trovan lied through his teeth and I scowled at him. I wondered if this was the kind of behavior that came over <br />
Prince Andrew when he had been drinking and fancied himself some company. It would certainly have been karmic <br />
to let Trovan carry on with Arn if that had been how she acted when she was Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen Sir Knight,&quot; said Morgana as she slinked across the room and wrapped her arms around Trovan.<br />
<br />
&quot;All we be forgotten if you perform a simple task for us. We need a spy in the Molossia camp. Prince Conrad <br />
and his father have not been so forthcoming with their intentions for marrying into the West Kingdom royalty. <br />
They may have sinister plans to usurp the throne and damage the Kingdom. We need you to discover their <br />
intentions.&quot; Morgana cooed in Sir Trovans ear. Her hands drifted down his body and into his trousers where <br />
they clasped his growing member and began gently stroking it up and down. <br />
<br />
&quot;W-well, subterfuge is not very honorable... It's rather unbecoming of a Knight,&quot; he grinned as Morganas hands <br />
slipped across his stiff shaft, lubricated by his own precum. &quot;You are doing a fine job of convincing me, <br />
however. Perhaps we can...come to sort of arrangement?&quot; Trovan smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I have no doubt we will,&quot; Morgana chuckled in his ear.<br />
<br />
Morgana stroked upwards and her hand slipped away from his cock. Her index finger came pointing down on the <br />
tip of his penis and she began pushing gently down. A jolt of pleasure shot through Trovans urethra. He <br />
shuddered and let out a decidedly unmanly &quot;Ooh!&quot; which made Morgana giggle. I easily guessed what was <br />
happening to him at this point and my own hand slipped between my legs and got to work by itself.<br />
<br />
Morganas free left hand slid up his toned body and under his tunic where she gently plucked his left nippled <br />
between her thumb and forefinger. His eyes rolled back and closed as he relished the feeling. She pinched a <br />
little harder and pulled his nipple outward. The motion seemed to be mirrored on his right nipple as well <br />
which stood erect as if pinched by another unseen hand. The effect was obvious.  New tissue spread out under <br />
his skin from his nipples like splashes in a puddle and then began to rise up into weighted bosoms like a <br />
cooking muffin. Soon he sported two soft, round breasts. My free hand crawled up to my breasts and began <br />
fiddling with my nipples, heightening my pleasure.<br />
<br />
Morgana continued pushing down on his still hard phallus which retracted into him along with his testies. Even <br />
as she pushed in his hips seemed to push out with his bottom until it curved like an upended spoon. His height <br />
seemed to be decreasing in line with his penis and Morgana was soon looking over his shoulder and then over <br />
his head. He'd now lost nearly 2 feet as well 5 inches. I slid to my knees, unable to continue standing as the <br />
energy drained from my legs and seemingly shot up through my vagina instead.<br />
 <br />
She then leant forward, opening her mouth wide and biting into Trovan's neck &quot;Ahh uh-uh-huh,&quot; a quick and <br />
girlish succession of moans fluttered from his adams apple-less throat. His eyes shot open briefly before <br />
gently closing and rolling back again. If he could pay attention he'd have noticed his eyelashes lengthening <br />
out an inch. Mouth hung open in a wide &quot;O&quot; big, painted red lips as crimson as his softened cheeks. Dark hair <br />
curled down from his head hanging over Morganas head as she continued nibbling Trovans neck. I bit my lower <br />
lip and winced as my hand rubbed tirelessly at my nethers. <br />
<br />
Morgana's finger curled round pushing the last little nub of Trovans former penis up into its new place <br />
nestled between the lips of &quot;her&quot; new vagina. Yes, Trovan was now very much a &quot;her&quot; with a curvaceous body and <br />
pretty face to prove it. Morgana continued to rub her little nub and she tried to moan but her voice couldn't <br />
quite make it out as she shook in Morganas hands. Her knees weakened and buckled and she fell back into <br />
Morgana. The witches grasp the only thing keeping her on her feet. Trovan at last exhaled with a loud moan of <br />
ectasy and Morgana let her slip to her knees and spool out on the floor where she lay for a few moments before <br />
rolling over and looking up at Morgana dreamily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa... what did you do? That felt incredible,&quot; the girl asked, lazily. I face contorted into an awkward half <br />
grin, at his obliviousness, the pleasure I was giving myself made it difficult to control my mouth from <br />
opening wide and moaning.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just gave you your first female orgasm, honey.&quot; Morgana said brightly<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-what? B-but I'm a guy!&quot; said the new girl with a funny slackjawed look on her face. I couldn't contain <br />
myself any longer and interrupted with a loud &quot;OH, yes!&quot; causing everyone in the room to look at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm carry on.&quot; I said, not caring and still smiling like a goofball, enjoying the afterglow.<br />
<br />
Trovan turned back and looked up at a triumphant Morgana. &quot;I'm supposed to be a guy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you can be a guy again if you slip into Conrads camp... and bedsheets, to find out what he's up to. I've <br />
given you the perfect body to seduce him and any guards you may need to in order to complete your task.&quot; The <br />
witch said, nonchalantly.<br />
<br />
Trovan gulped. He really had no other choice but to play along.</p>
