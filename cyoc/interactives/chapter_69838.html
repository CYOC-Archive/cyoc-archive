<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff sat on his bed, staring at the purple plush dragon, who he thought to be rather girly in appearance and odd that it didn't have a name and was simply known as dragon. After a moment, he adjusted the dress he was wearing, despising how it felt against his privates. Looking at Mr Sparkles the unicorn and picking up the unicorn, and than selected the plastic comb next from the various accessories and gently began to comb the unicorn's mane.<br />
<br />
Wondering where Angela was, wanting to play with his big sister, he sighed when he realised how he had just thought of the girl. Setting down Mr Sparkles, he reached for the hem of his dress, which stopped just a couple inches above his knees.<br />
<br />
As he lifted it, Jeff wondered why his mother had did this to him, as he had come to the conclusion a couple days ago that it must have been his mother who had done this to him. &quot;Which would explain why she doesn't accept that I've been bad and must be forced to dress as a girl,&quot; as he lifted the dress up past his genitals and stared at the deformed mass of flesh.<br />
<br />
Its change had begun only a day ago, but Jeff thought that it was speeding up. Gazing at the fact that his wiener was now split into two, his nuts had vanished and the sack that held them was now deflated and appeared to also be splitting in two, he realised that his mommy would tell him what a bad girl he was for not wearing any underwear. Touching his two wieners, finding that one that was more toward his front was really sensitive, he thought, &quot;One for peeing and one for nothing,&quot; as he wondered what the front one was for.<br />
<br />
Dropping his dress back into place, he stood, adjusted his clothes, tucking his privates betwixt his legs as he did so and sitting back down, he picked up the plush dragon. Studying the pink spines starting on top of its head and moving down its back, the pink wings, which felt like some type of plastic material and had a couple pieces of plastic sewn into each to give definition, the purple hide and pink claws and the creatures pink eyes, Jeff wondered how anyone could find it adorable as he suddenly found himself thinking it to be both extremely girly and adorable at the same time. Setting the creature down, he picked it up and hugged it close, idly running a finger up its long throat and the down, stopping about midpoint of the dragon's belly, thinking that that there must be something wrong with him if he thought it was adorable.<br />
<br />
As he did traced a finger up and down the creatures front, he stared out in the space, still thinking the plush dragon to be adorable, but also wondering how it was that his mother had been able to do such a thing to him and how long he would have to remain as a girl, figuring that it must be some form of punishment. Glancing down at the plush dragon, he kissed the thing between the two pink nub-like horns on its nose and whispered, &quot;Don't worry. Mommy will always love you and never allow anything bad happen to you,&quot; and setting the dragon down, Jeff reached for Mr Sparkles, unaware that there was anything off about how he'd just addressed the plush dragon.<br />
<br />
Cuddling Mr Sparkles in a way that resembled a mother holding her new-born, Jeff once again wondered where Angela was, as he really wanted to play with her, and reaching for some of the dolly accessories, he ran the comb through the unicorn's mane, pretended to dab some make-up on the her face, muttered, &quot;That shan't do,&quot; and then pretended to wipe the make-up off as he told them plush animal, telling it, &quot;Mommy wants her girl to be pretty, but her girl has to understand that only big girls wear make-up,&quot; as he did so and pretending that he had just caught Mr Sparkles trying on make-up.<br />
<br />
As he laid the plush unicorn down, Jeff glanced at the door, hoping to hear Angela approaching and idly reaching for one of the garments he had laid out for the Mr Sparkles to wear Jeff accidentally knocked the brush he had been using to groom the unicorn's mane onto the floor.<br />
<br />
Reaching down for it, he accidentally knocked some of the ribbons and the purple plush dragon off the bed and huffing in mock-agitation, Jeff slid off the bed and onto the floor. Arranging his skirt, he folded himself into a lotus position and reaching up onto the bed, he started to take Mr Sparkles and the unicorn's clothes off, when he paused. Leaning down a bit, Jeff peered under his bed and at the thing that had caught his attention and after staring at it for a couple seconds, he reached for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Angela's necklace,&quot; he thought as he pulled from out beneath his bed the amulet that he had fallen asleep with a couple nights ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or was it a month ago?&quot; he asked himself.<br />
<br />
Unsure what the correct amount of time had passed when he had fallen asleep tracing its image, Jeff now stared at that very image, unsure what he was seeing, but sure that it might be somebody in mid-transformation into something else. After a couple seconds, Jeff figured that he would give it back to Angela, as he really didn't want his big sister mad at him for touching her stuff and draping it around the dragon's neck, he let it clunk to the floor, as it was clearly to big for the plush animal.<br />
<br />
Returning his attention back to Mr Sparkles, he told her, &quot;Mommy is going to make you pretty,&quot; and laying the creature on its back, he began to put a cloth diaper on the plush unicorn.<br />
<br />
After a he done that, he leaned down and kissed Mr Sparkles on the snout and told it, &quot;Be right back. Mommy has to tinkle,&quot; and standing, Jeff skipped out of the room and down to the bathroom without realising how much he was acting like a girl, only troubled by the fact that he was turning into a girl.<br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom, he hiked up his skirt and sat down on the toilet. A couple seconds later, he felt his bladder letting loose and knowing that only one of his wieners was expelling pee-pee, Jeff once again wondered what the second wiener was for as he finished, grabbed some toilet paper and patted himself dry. Dropping the soiled paper into the toilet, he glanced down, noting that his sack was pretty much now part of the area between his legs and that the rest of his privates had taken on more of a whitish-pink hue.<br />
<br />
A mixture of feeling about staring and touching the area between his legs suddenly flashed through Jeff's mind and grabbing a bit more toilet paper, he hastily finished his business, stood, flushed and went to the sink to wash his hands. Returning to his and Angela's bedroom, he was just about to sit down and continue dressing Mr Sparkles when it came to him that this wasn't supposed to be his room.<br />
<br />
Exiting back out the room, Jeff looked up and down the hallway, spied his mommy's room, the bathroom, the linen closet and a closed door that his mind told him led to both a guest room and what was actually supposed to be his room. Confused, Jeff stood there for a couple minutes, looking down the hall at the closed door before finally going back into the room he shared with Angela and sitting lotus style down on the floor, he idly stared to dress Mr Sparkles in her clothes. After he had down that, Jeff hugged the plush unicorn close and still bothered by the thoughts that his room was actually where the guest room was, he stood and exited back into the hallway.<br />
<br />
Downstairs, he could hear Angela arguing with their mommy about something and deciding to ignore this, instead of investigating it like his mind said he normally would, Jeff hugged the plush unicorn closer and proceeded down the hall.<br />
<br />
Stopping outside the closed door, something inside his mind insisting that when he opened this door he would find his room, Jeff stared at the wooden door before reaching up and turning the knob. Pushing open the door, he was greeted by a bed that hadn't been made up and a dresser that had all of its drawers pulled open. Immediately the voices in his head stopped speaking as he realised that this was were grandma and grandpa Silvestry slept when they came over, as well as Aunt Brian and Uncle Philbert.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder when they'll visit again?&quot; Jeff asked himself as he cuddled the unicorn closer and pulled the door closed and started back down the hallway.<br />
<br />
Stepping into his and Angela's bedroom, he was just about to sit down and play with his plush animals when he heard Angela coming up the stairs and turning back around, he rushed out into the hallway, calling out, &quot;Angela I found your necklace. Will you come play with me?&quot; as he did so.<br />
<br />
As his sister reached the top of the stairs, he listened as she told him, &quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heading back into the room, ecstatic Angela was going to play with him, Jeff paused when the dress he was wearing brushed up against his wiener and with a jolt, he realised that at some point between now and when he had used the toilet, it had shrunk even more. But than Angela called out, &quot;You found my necklace,&quot; and Jeff immediately forgot about his transformation as he sat down, adjusting his skirt as he did so, and told her, &quot;Yeah. It was under my bed for some reason.&quot;</p>
