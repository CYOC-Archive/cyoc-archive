<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke at 6am. I was annoyed that I had leaked during the night. There were some blood spots on the bed. I obviously need a bigger pad. I sponged off the sheets as Sarah had shown me and I decided I had time for a bath.<br />
<br />
Today I put on a dark green, short sleeved, knee length dress. It was the last of the outfits Sarah that had suggested were suitable for work wear. From now on I would have to make clothing choices for myself.<br />
<br />
At breakfast Mum asked me to deliver her the pleated skirt so she could make sure it was clean and pressed. She also asked for Sarah’s suit. She seemed very surprised when I said it had already been dry-cleaned and returned to Sarah.<br />
<br />
I was waiting at the post office door when it opened at 8am. I handed the cards over to the shop assistant and she came back with 3 large but light parcels. I was struggling to carry them all at once. <br />
<br />
A guy in the queue behind me offered to help. I accepted and he ended up carrying two of the parcels and putting them in my car. “Thank-you” I said to him. I had no doubt I would have been on my own, had I still been a 26 year old male.<br />
<br />
“My pleasure” <br />
<br />
Work was again busy. At lunch I had a chance to talk with George. He was married with 3 teenage sons. I asked why he only worked 3 days a week. He said he earned enough money in 3 days and had made a lifestyle choice that 3 days a week, locked in a room was enough. <br />
<br />
I gave Sarah a ring after 5 as I was walking back to my car. She had returned to work today and was just leaving herself. She said she had ended up going out to dinner with Zach and Amanda last night. She thanked me for returning her suit and invited me to come around to her place for dinner. <br />
<br />
I sent a message to Mum ‘Going to Sarah’s. Will have dinner with her’ <br />
<br />
Sarah was walking to her door as I pulled into the driveway behind her. Once she saw me she waited then gave me a sisterly hug as I got out of the car. “Hi Jenna. That dress really suits you” <br />
<br />
I followed her inside then to the back door where Biddy was scratching and yelping in excitement. Once let in he jumped all over us. “How about a cuppa then we take him for a walk” said Sarah as she put the kettle on.<br />
<br />
“I’ll just visit the toilet if you don’t mind” I went to the toilet and changed my pad. This was one part of being female I was quickly tiring of.<br />
When I returned to the kitchen Sarah was gone. The kettle had boiled so I poured water into two cups that Sarah had put teabags in. I added milk to Sarah’s knowing how she liked her tea. She emerged from the bedroom having changed into a polo shirt, shorts and pink runners. She put a pair of white sandshoes on the floor. “These will be more comfortable for our walk” I assumed they were for me to wear. The sandals I was wearing had a 2 inch heel.<br />
<br />
While we sipped our teas Sarah told me how she, Zach and Amanda had gone to the same pub where we had gone several weeks ago. That had been when I was Sarah and she was Zach. I told her that I needed to become friends with Amanda so that I could stay in contact with Zach. She understood and said she would try and arrange situations where I and Amanda were together.<br />
<br />
I put the sandshoes on. They certainly didn’t match the dress I was wearing but they would be much easier to walk the dog in. I had learned how spiky heels and walking on grass did not mix.<br />
<br />
We took Biddy on a slightly longer walk, a route that would take about 45 minutes. I told Sarah about the doctor’s visit and the dancing lesson. <br />
<br />
“I think you must be a stripper or a sex worker of some kind. I’ve never had such a thorough examination. It also explains all the dresses”<br />
<br />
“It’s not a career I particularly want to continue, but I actually enjoyed the dancing. I was amazed by how flexible this body is. I was thinking of continuing the dancing lessons”<br />
<br />
“That’s up to you. No harm I suppose. Maybe you could pass on a few tips to me. Eventually I’ll have to find myself another man”<br />
<br />
It should have been me I thought. Attractive as my body was. It was not to Sarah’s taste. I knew at some stage I would have to watch as she was wooed by a male. I wondered when that happened would I be jealous or envious. I changed the subject “I picked up some parcels today from Jenna’s Post Office Box” <br />
<br />
“Oh. What are they?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. I haven’t opened them yet. They are in the car”<br />
<br />
“Let’s have a look when we get home”<br />
<br />
“How are the funeral arrangements going?”<br />
<br />
“I’m really leaving that to Hilda and Mum. Zach is going to say the eulogy”<br />
<br />
“Well he knows Rod better than anyone”<br />
<br />
“Yeah”<br />
<br />
“Do I play any part?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think so. We are printing a funeral program, maybe you could hand them out to the guests as they arrive”<br />
<br />
“I can do that”<br />
<br />
“I’ll need to find something to wear. Mum said not to buy anything specifically. But I want to look nice”<br />
<br />
“I suppose I need to think about that as well. I’ll need to check out the black dresses in my wardrobe. That reminds me. Who owns the dresses in the wardrobe in Monique’s old room?”<br />
<br />
“Actually you do. I’m fairly sure they are all Jenna’s. Some might be Mum’s or Monique’s. I’ll go through them with you next time I am over”<br />
<br />
“That would be nice” How many clothes did Jenna own?<br />
………..<br />
Back at the house Sarah started making a pasta dinner while I bought in the 3 parcels I had collected from the post office.<br />
<br />
The 1st parcel was the smallest. It turned out to be from an online lingerie supplier. The receipt described the contents as ‘Navy French knickers, Cami top and Wrap combination’ Also there was a ‘Burgundy floral lace, push-up lingerie set’ and a ‘Burgundy lace teddy” All up with postage $135.97 had been deducted from my master card. “Interesting” was all Sarah said.<br />
<br />
The second parcel was from an online fashion house. In it were 3 different items. A pale pink, sleeveless, knee length dress with wrap features’ whatever that meant, a ‘Black, short sleeved midi dress with lace inserts’ and a ‘Black and silver midi pencil skirt’ This package had cost Jenna $155.85. “You will have to try them on” said Sarah<br />
<br />
I opened the third package. More dresses. The receipt said I was now the owner of a ‘Floral, crushed velvet form fitting dress’ and a ’Form fitting floral velvet dress’ I had no idea of what the difference was. The third item was a ‘Botanical print self-belted velvet coat’. This parcel had cost Jenna $78.85. “I think Jenna had a dress obsession” was all I could say. <br />
<br />
“The pasta is ready but as soon as we have finished I want a fashion show” said Sarah<br />
<br />
I replied “It’s only fair that there are two models. You show me what options you have for the funeral”<br />
<br />
“Fair enough, But I insist on seeing all the fashion, including the lingerie”<br />
<br />
Well you choose which lingerie you will wear. You can see it in the mirror. The Navy or the Burgundy?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll go the French Knickers. That was the Navy I think”<br />
<br />
As we ate dinner I must admit I was feeling a sense of anticipation. <br />
<br />
When we had finished Sarah said “Leave the dishes. I’m eager for the show. How about you make sure all the curtains are shut while I collect the black dresses from the guest room. That can be your change room. I’ll use the master bedroom”<br />
<br />
I closed all the curtains and blinds around the house. I didn’t want any peeping Toms either. When finished I took all the packages to the guest bed. From the lingerie package I extracted the Navy pieces and placed them on Sarah’s bed. She already had a collection of black clothes there and was now searching through the wardrobe in that room. “What do you want to start with?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Let’s wear the lingerie underneath, but not reveal it till the end”<br />
<br />
“Ok let’s start. I’ll meet you in the lounge in 5” <br />
<br />
I returned to the guest room and shut the door. I pulled out the lingerie. The panties were bikini style not a G-string. They were very lacy. The teddy seemed like just a piece of lace. I guessed you did not wear both at the same time so put the teddy aside. I stripped off what I was wearing and put the bra and panties on. I was still bleeding so put a new pad in. The bra had thick cups and was a little tight. It certainly enhanced my cleavage. <br />
<br />
I started with the bigger parcel and pulled out one of the velvet dresses. It looked very pretty. It was a floral pattern with white and Red flowers on an orange background. It had elbow length sleeves and zipped up at the back. I stepped into it and pulled it up. It clung to my contours and came to knee length. I was easily able to pull the zip up. I looked in the mirror. Nice enough. I wondered on what sort of occasion I would wear it. <br />
<br />
“How are you going in there?” Sarah was calling. She was already in the lounge.<br />
<br />
“Just ready now” I opened the door and stepped out. <br />
<br />
Sarah was wearing a form hugging black dress. The skirt part only came to mid-thigh and it had long sleeves. “What do you think of this” she said “Is the length too short for a funeral”<br />
<br />
“Yeah something a bit longer I think….. Where would I wear this?” I indicated the dress I was wearing.<br />
<br />
“Maybe a date to the movies or a dinner party……. Turn around” I did so “Put your sandals back on. You need heels when modelling” I did so. “Nice but realistically you would look nice in anything…… Let’s change”<br />
<br />
We returned to our room. Next I chose the pink dress. It had a side zip under my left arm and thin straps over my shoulders. The top was quite plain, with a slight V shape but was not too revealing. The skirt part looked like it might have been a wrap skirt but it wasn’t, it was just the way the material was sown together. Like the description said it came to my knees.<br />
<br />
I entered the lounge. Sarah was just entering as well. She was wearing another black dress. This time it was very lacy. The skirt flared out but still only came to mid-thigh. Her shoulders were exposed, revealing navy blue straps of the camisole she was wearing underneath.    <br />
“I like that” said Sarah, looking at me. “Put a jacket on top and you could wear it out to dinner or work. Only problem would be it will show dirt. I wouldn’t play with Biddy in it” Fortunately Biddy was asleep on the floor. “What do you think of this?” She indicated what she was wearing.<br />
<br />
“You look great, but maybe it is a bit too sexy for a funeral”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it’s more of a party dress. Time to change”<br />
<br />
“I’ll need to borrow top to wear with my knew skirt”<br />
<br />
“There are plenty to choose from in the cupboard”<br />
<br />
I returned to the room and undressed. I chose a satin white shirt from her cupboard and put my new skirt on underneath. It was of black material with a floral pattern made of silver sequins. I thought it looked great. It was a pencil skirt but there was a slit up the back so it was easy to walk in.<br />
<br />
I almost ran out of the room eager to show Sarah. She was still in the other room. “Hurry up. I want to show you this one” I called out.<br />
<br />
“Well you had better come in and zip me up. I’m having difficulty” I entered she had her back to me. I pulled up the zip at the back of her dress. She turned around. She looked fantastic. “That’s perfect” I said. “What would you call it?”<br />
<br />
“I like it too. You would call it an A line dress, because of the way it flares out” The skirt came to just below her knees. It had long sleeves but exposed her shoulders. “I particularly like the detail on the sleeves” She showed me a lacy insert near each wrist. “I’ve never actually worn it. I bought it for a race day we ended up not going to”<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it’s perfect for the funeral”<br />
<br />
She scrutinized what I was wearing “That skirt is lovely”<br />
<br />
“I’m thinking of wearing it to work tomorrow. Do you think it might be too dressy?”<br />
<br />
“You are a receptionist, you need to look good. I didn’t realize Jenna had such good taste. Go and put you next dress on. I’m going to try out some accessories”<br />
<br />
I returned to the guest room and put the second velvet dress on. This one was blue with a pattern of red and white flowers. It had a strappy top and clung to my body. It came to the top of my thighs. Barely covering my panties.<br />
<br />
time when we met in the lounge Sarah’s comment was “Did I just say Jenna had good taste? I don’t like that. You look a bit slutty”<br />
<br />
It is comfortable to wear” <br />
<br />
“Maybe something to just wear at home them, or to a striptease maybe……….What do you think? Should I wear dark pantyhose?”<br />
<br />
I now saw she had black pantyhose on and had changed to black heels. “Looks nice, can’t say that I immediately noticed though”<br />
<br />
“Do you think I should were a brooch or other jewellery?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think you should overdo it. But maybe something Rod gave you”<br />
<br />
I’ll show you one more black outfit. What have you got left?”<br />
<br />
“Just the black dress and the velvet cloak, then the underwear”<br />
<br />
“Put the cloak on over the dress, then you can show me a striptease” She said that with a big grin on her face<br />
<br />
I returned to the room. Took off the velvet dress and put on the black dress. I liked what I saw in the mirror. It had buttons up the back so took a bit longer to put on. I then put the cloak over the top. To be honest it looked like a garish dressing gown. It was soft to feel though.<br />
I heard Sarah back in the lounge. This time she was wearing a black knit top with an ankle length black skirt. “No” I said when I saw her. “You look like a goth”<br />
<br />
“That’s what I thought as well……… What are you wearing? It looks like a dressing gown”<br />
<br />
“I imagine that’s how I might use it. It’s a bit too colorful for my liking” She nodded. “But look what’s underneath” I took of the gown revealing the black dress.<br />
<br />
“Wow that’s really nice. You could wear that on Monday. Maybe black pantyhose and shoes with it”……..”A hat as well, I think. Maybe a brooch?…………Wait there” She went to her room and shortly afterwards returned and pinned a large gold brooch to my chest. “Yeah that looks nice”<br />
<br />
“Let me look in the mirror” I went back to the guest room and admired myself. Yep I could wear this to the funeral. <br />
<br />
Sarah had followed me in “What’s left to try on?”<br />
<br />
“Just to reveal the lingerie”<br />
<br />
“I’m curious to see this chair dance you learnt. Any chance you could give me a demonstration? Maybe a striptease at the same time?”<br />
“Hmm. Ok but what is good for the goose is good for the gander. Actually maybe I should say what’s good for the goose is good for the other goose. I’ll do that if you do likewise. I’ll try and teach you the moves”<br />
<br />
“Ok, deal”<br />
<br />
“Let me change back into that velvet dress. You put a chair in the middle of the lounge and put some dance music on. Here take your brooch. I’m sure I can find something similar in Jenna’s collection”<br />
<br />
I removed the black dress and put the blue velvet dress back on. Over the top of that I wore the gown. “Ready when you” are I called out.<br />
 <br />
“How about The Chainsmokers?”<br />
<br />
“Ok”<br />
<br />
I heard the music start. I was now wishing I hadn’t agreed to do this and felt a bit self-conscious. To late to pull out now. I started swaying to the beat. I needed to get into the zone and just think about the music, get into Jenna mode. I opened the door, Sarah had turned off the fluorescent kitchen light. The sole lighting was from a lamp in the lounge. I flicked off the bedroom light as I left the bedroom. <br />
To the beat of the music I did the sexy walk that Katie had shown me on Monday night. Thrusting my chest out and flicking my hair around. I approached the chair placing one leg on it and leant forward as I had been shown. Then still gyrating to the music I slipped out of the gown and tossed it to the floor. <br />
<br />
Now in my blue dress I circumnavigated the chair, continuing the sexy walk and head shakes, I had added the pelvic thrusts Katie had taught me. I had finished the 2nd part of the routine and was now sitting on the chair leaning forward. I really don’t know how I did it, but somehow in time to the music I had pulled the dress up over my head and was now in my burgundy bra and panties. I ran my hands up and down over my body and began the third part of the routine. It finished with me wiggling my bum towards Sarah squatting on the chair. I then got off the chair and did the sexy walk over to the CD player and turned the music off.<br />
<br />
“Wow!” Said Sarah. ”That was sexy. Keep that up and I’ll turn lesbian” I had picked up the dress and thrown it back on. <br />
<br />
“I had to improvise the stripping parts. I haven’t been taught that yet”<br />
<br />
“Actually I suspect that your body knows how to do that instinctively. It fitted into your routine seamlessly. You looked very professional”<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure whether that is a compliment or not. Your turn now. I’ll show you how to do the walk”<br />
<br />
I tried to demonstrate the 1st part of the routine. Unfortunately it didn’t work with the long dress that Sarah was wearing. “You will need to get out of that dress. You promised me a demonstration of the lingerie”<br />
<br />
“I did, didn’t I” She went into the master bedroom and soon returned in just French knickers and camisole, under the thin wrap. Boy did I wish I still had a penis. The outfit hid very little. My nipples were erect.<br />
<br />
I got myself back under control and demonstrated the walk again, culminating with my leg on the chair.<br />
<br />
Sarah copied me and I had to touch her at times to demonstrate leg placements and arm movements. I found it very hard not to pull her to me and kiss her. Eventually I was satisfied that she had mastered the sexy walk.   <br />
<br />
“You still have to model the Teddy” She reminded me.<br />
<br />
“So long as you stay as you are” She nodded.<br />
<br />
I returned to the guest bedroom and looked at the Teddy. I stripped off then stepped into what I hoped were the leg holes and pulled the rest of the garment up and inserted my arms. It hid nothing. My nipples and pubic hairs were very visible through the lace. <br />
<br />
I returned to the lounge. Sarah had removed her wrap, she was now just in the navy French knickers and camisole. We looked at each other. I couldn’t hide that my nipples were erect. They were pushing out 15 mm. I examined her body. I could see Sarah’s brown pubes through her outfit, her areolae and nipples were also obvious. I reached out and touched her breast. Tracing her nipple with my finger. She let me. I lifted my gaze to her eyes. They were glistening. I saw she was crying. <br />
<br />
“What’s wrong” I asked<br />
<br />
“I can’t” she replied “I’m sorry”<br />
<br />
She broke away and ran to the master bedroom closing the door.<br />
<br />
I picked up the gown off the floor and walked back to the guest room. I took off the teddy and put on the original clothes I had arrived in. I packed my new clothes as much as I could into the boxes. I went and knocked on Sarah’s door. “Come in” She was lying on the bed. Still only in the lingerie. “I’m so sorry” she said “I could see you wanted it and I wanted to please you. But all I see is my sister. Unfortunately I’m not a lesbian. I know who you are and I love you but…… but I wish you were male”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I wish I was male as well. I’m sorry I put you in this situation. I know I am not a lesbian either, but my mind is still partially male. The dressing up started out as harmless fun, but I get confused around you. I still love you. I have to learn how to love you only as a sister” She sat up and we hugged. I was very careful not to let my hands wander.<br />
<br />
“You can keep the outfit you’re wearing. I have more than enough lingerie. Time for me to go home anyway. I‘ll call you tomorrow. Goodnight little sister”<br />
<br />
“Goodnight Jenna”<br />
<br />
I took my belongings back to the car and drove home. It was only 9pm it felt like midnight.</p>
