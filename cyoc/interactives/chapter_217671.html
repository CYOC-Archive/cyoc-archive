<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Heavily edited by Krentol</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charlie abruptly stiffened in Rodrigo’s embrace, his heart racing in his chest. <br />
<br />
What was he doing?  Did he fail a charm person check?  He needed to concentrate on their survival, not grope the wolf when their lives were on the line! Charlie gave the wolf a pinch on his rear and stepped away. Rodrigo blushed but let Charlie go. <br />
<br />
Then Charlie looked around the room.<br />
<br />
Cobwebs, long covered in dust, hung limply from the corners of the ceiling. In the center was an old wooden table, surrounded by a few strange skeletons, warped by some unknown power. They appeared to have died eating dinner, though the meal was long gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this place?&quot; Rodrigo asked, his voice filled with a mixture of curiosity and fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;The living quarters of the engineers who built the tomb above us, I think,&quot; Charlie said, feeling a strange sense of certainty. <br />
<br />
“We’re close, then?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe.” Charlie gestured at the skeletons. “Someone murdered them.”<br />
<br />
Rodrigo reached out to touch one of the skeletons, but Charlie stopped him. &quot;Don&#39;t disturb them,&quot; he whispered. &quot;We can&#39;t handle the undead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rodrigo looked away, embarrassed. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s just... he&#39;s wearing my family crest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie looked at the skeleton again and realized that it was indeed a wolf, like Rodrigo, though the strange bony tumors that disfigured his body made that hard to tell. <br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,,&quot; he said, trying to hide his own excitement, “but use detect magic first.”<br />
<br />
“Detect Magic.” Rodrigo intoned.<br />
<br />
Charlie waited, watching the wolf scan the room with eyes that glowed a soft blue light.<br />
<br />
“There’s a sink with a Purify Water enchantment on it.” Rodrigo pointed. “The plates are glowing with transmutation.”<br />
<br />
Charlie&#39;s mind raced as he realized what had happened. &quot;They poisoned the plates, not the food,&quot; he said, stroking his goatee. &quot;Genius.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rodrigo looked at him, his eyes wide with understanding. &quot;They had access to the Purify Food and Water spell,&quot; he said. &quot;These guys were probably Artificers and likely cast it on their food before eating. Their killer knew that and sabotaged their dishware instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie nodded, impressed by Rodrigo&#39;s insight. &quot;Let&#39;s continue,&quot; he said, eager to solve the mystery and get to safety.<br />
<br />
The continued through the worker’s quarters and found several rooms with rotted beds and ancient plumbing.  While it might have been nice to have a soft bed to rest on, the dormitories weren’t what he was interested.  No, what Charlie was looking for was the storeroom, or even just an emergency supply stash.<br />
<br />
He found it a few minutes later.<br />
<br />
The inside of the small closet had a few bags of dust and rusty cans of likely very spoiled food. Unless someone had cast gentle repose on them, nothing here was edible. What caught Charlie’s eye were the wands on the shelf.<br />
<br />
“What’s this?” Rodrigo asked as Charlie handed them to him.<br />
<br />
“Create food. Create water.” Charlie said. “And this one is create object. Time to camp here tonight.”<br />
<br />
Having thoroughly raided what was left of the dormitory’s supplies, the pair poked around in the other rooms until the found the head engineer’s quarters. It was bigger than the others and had a fireplace. And although all of the pleasantries had long since rotted away, it was still well appointed.<br />
<br />
Rodrigo held up the wand and got to work, conjuring blankets for the bed and logs for the fire. <br />
<br />
Charlie used his flint and steel and soon the room was warm and cozy. Rodrigo crafted some bread and water for them. It was a meager meal, but the bread was guaranteed nutrition.<br />
<br />
After the meal, Rodrigo rose to his feet and slowly undid his belt, revealing the soft expanse of his belly that jiggled enticingly. With a seductive flourish, he stripped off his sweat-soaked clothes, revealing every inch of his glistening skin. Then, with a flick of his wrist, he conjured up a bucket of water with his wand, tossing his clothes in to soak. The sight of Rodrigo’s supple body and effortless mastery of magic left a tantalizing impression on Charlie.<br />
<br />
Rodrigo turned to face Charlie, his luscious curves and naked body fully exposed, the wolf unperturbed by his nudity. <br />
<br />
“Well?” he purred, his voice dripping with seduction. “Don’t be shy. Let’s get cleaned up with these wands.” <br />
<br />
He gestured towards the magical devices, his gaze lingering on their bodies with a sultry intensity. The sight of Rodrigo’s voluptuous figure and his alluring confidence left Charlie weak-kneed and breathless, eager to follow his lead.<br />
<br />
With a shy hesitation, Charlie peeled off his leather garments, covering himself with a bashful air. <br />
<br />
But Rodrigo was not one to be deterred. “Prestidigitation,” he murmured, pointing his wand at Charlie’s leathers. In an instant, the leather was restored to its original state, oiled and supple as before.<br />
<br />
With a seductive gesture, Rodrigo beckoned Charlie closer, the heat of his body palpable in the air. Charlie’s nakedness felt exposed and vulnerable, but he couldn’t resist the allure of Rodrigo’s sensuality.<br />
<br />
“Create Water,” Rodrigo whispered, and a cool cascade of liquid flowed over them both, drenching their skin and leaving them tingling with desire.<br />
<br />
As the water flowed over their bodies, the wolf seemed utterly unfazed by the moment. It put Charlie at ease, and he couldn’t help but sneak a glance at the wolf. He admired the fullness of Rodrigo’s pert, plump bosom, the soft, supple curve of his belly, and the way his luscious buttocks bounced with each step, all captured Charlie’s attention. Rodrigo carried himself with an alluring confidence. He found himself drawn to Rodrigo’s irresistible confidence, and his senses were heightened by the alluring display.<br />
<br />
Charlie didn’t realize his maleness had come erect until he saw Rodrigo look at his crotch with a smile. <br />
<br />
“Prestidigitation,” Rodrigo pointed.<br />
<br />
The dirty water was blown away by the spell. The two naked, dry, and clean anthros stood in the room by the fireplace. Charlie covered his groin, embarrassed. Rodrigo just smiled, his tail wagging behind him. Slowly, Charlie lowered his paws. He had nothing to hide, not if Rodrigo was willing to bare all.<br />
<br />
“Sit with me, Charles.” Rodrigo indicated the chairs by the table. “Tell me more about yourself.”<br />
<br />
He hobbled over to the small table and winced as he sat down, his ass still smarting after the fall.<br />
<br />
“You feeling okay?” Rodrigo asked.<br />
<br />
“Butt hurts.” Charlie said through mouthfuls of bread. He was FAMISHED. “Scraped it on the walls.”<br />
<br />
“Do you need a little more healing potion?” Rodrigo asked.<br />
<br />
Charlie nodded. ”Uh, yeah, I can do another dab-”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’ve got it. Get on the bed over there.” Rodrigo replied. <br />
<br />
He lay on the bed as Rodrigo carefully measured out a little potion. <br />
<br />
The wolf hissed as the cloth carefully dabbed the wounds on his ass. They were just scrapes, really, but they stung like the dickens. Rodrigo was a skilled hand, though, and the pain was soothed away in a few moments.<br />
<br />
Rodrigo dabbed a few more times, all cross Charlie’s rump, then kneaded the other wolf’s ass flesh. It was a nice massage, and Charlie could feel his tense muscles loosen as the warm potion soaked in. His flesh seemed to swell around Rodrigo’s fingers, his firm muscles pliable and wobbly.<br />
<br />
Then he felt a drop of something hit his tailhole and flinched. His hole tingled pleasantly where the droplet had hit him and the muscles began to twitch. A few more droplets hit his tailhole and it began to spasm violently.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Charlie gasped as the muscles in his ring contracted and tensed as though fighting off an intruder.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, let me clean that off quick.” Rodrigo said, sounding embarrassed.<br />
<br />
Rodrigo lifted Charlie’s tail out of the way, making the wolf feel vulnerable and exposed. <br />
<br />
Then he gently dabbed the cloth around the wolf’s pucker. Charlie’s tailhole spasmed at the soft touches, his cock growing hard. It was embarrassing, but the other wolf paid him no mind. The soft, gentle rubs began to soothe to tense muscles and they relaxed.<br />
<br />
The cloth gently circled his tailhole before slipping in.<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Charlie said, then moaned as the cloth touched something in him that had his cock drooling and his hole clenching. “Ooooh!”<br />
<br />
The tingling intensified and then the smell in the room shifted. It was a deep, wholesome musk, one Charlie recognized as his own, though different, more mature. Rodrigo kept Charlie’s tail lifted and dabbed a few more times. Charlie’s anus gave one last, feeble twitch before it began to puff and distend. Rodrigo kept dabbing until the muscle simply parted on contact with the cloth, as though it had given up any resistance. <br />
<br />
Charlie relaxed, his tongue lolling out, his cock drooling precum as the wolf finished working his pleasantly throbbing hole.<br />
<br />
Rodrigo pulled away from Charlie’s slack ring and capped the phial.<br />
<br />
“There. Just enough. Sorry about the spill, I think I got it.” Rodrigo smiled.<br />
<br />
“T-thanks.” Charlie struggled to his feet, his big, bubbly ass wobbling.<br />
<br />
“No problem Charles.” Rodrigo winked.<br />
<br />
Charles blushed and tried to ignore his canine erection bobbing in the air in front of him like a flag. He couldn’t help but notice Rodrigo’s trousers were tented. Their eyes met and Charles felt his heart flutter in his chest.<br />
<br />
“W-wanna sleep? I can take first watch?” Charles asked.<br />
<br />
“No need.”<br />
<br />
Rodrigo closed the door and locked it. Then he cast a spell and the door disappeared. Or, at least, it seemed to. <br />
<br />
“What did you do?” Charlie asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I just made it look like a wall. Illusion.” Rodrigo explained. “Better than locking a door, in my opinion. But I’ll push the table in front of it just in case.”<br />
<br />
“So, who will sleep first?”<br />
<br />
“Why, we’ll share the bed. Gotta conserve our body heat.” Rodrigo grinned.<br />
<br />
“In the nude?”<br />
<br />
“What other way is there?”<br />
<br />
Charles lay down, and Rodrigo clambered after him. They stayed next to each other for a moment, enjoying the warmth of their bodies, then Rodrigo scooted closer. Charles didn’t fight the other wolf when Rodrigo embraced him, nuzzling against the wolf’s side.<br />
<br />
“Now, where did we leave off, hmm?” Rodrigo murmured, trailing his claw through Charles’ chest fur. He paused as his paw landed on Charles’ erect cock. “Oh my, is someone needy tonight?”<br />
<br />
Charles moaned as he felt his lover’s soft pawpads alight on his throbbing dick. “Y-yeah.”<br />
<br />
He thought he heard Rodrigo uncork the phial and then a warm, gentle ting enveloped his shaft. Charles tried to look down to see what was going on, but Rodrigo leaned in close, blocking his line of sight, though Charles could see his arm moving as he stroked the assassin off. He moaned, enjoying the long pleasurable strokes.<br />
<br />
His cock began to feel swollen and tight in the other wolf’s paws. It felt like each gentle stroke of Rodrigo’s chubby fingers drew his dick further and further from his body. Charles groaned as he grew ever more erect. Looking down, he saw his big, fat, foot-long red rocket throbbing in Rodrigo’s paws. Something about that felt a little off, had he ever been so big?<br />
<br />
Then Rodrigo began to fondle and roll Charles’ balls in his paws. Charles moaned, a primal heat flooding his body. The plump mayor gave Charles’ testes a squeeze and the wolf assassin flushed as another wave of pleasant heat enveloped him and his fur stood on end.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, like that.” Charles moaned, his voice sounding oddly deeper to his ears.<br />
<br />
Rodrigo started moving his fingers in small yet precise, deliberate movements. <br />
<br />
At first, Charles didn’t mind it. The little pokes and prods were highly pleasurable, shooting sparks of bliss straight into his brain. But then, inexplicably, a strange pressure began to build throughout his body, hidden behind the sharp jolts of pleasure.<br />
<br />
After a gentle tug on his cock, Charles began to feel oddly bloated. It was a pleasant sort of fullness, like he experienced after a particularly good meal. Another decisive stroke and jerk and his muscles relaxed and puffed rounder and fuller. Rodrigo gave his dick another soft tug and then pressed a thumb against the head of Charles’ canine cock. <br />
<br />
“Fuck that feels good.” Charles rumbled and idly scratched his oddly swollen pec as coarse body hair curled through his fluffy coat.<br />
<br />
Charles ran his hands over his tight, lean abs and paused, feeling only an undefined slab of muscle and fat where his cobblestones should be. Rodrigo’s nimble fingers moved faster, distracting the younger wolf from inspecting his increasingly burlier body too closely. <br />
<br />
Rodrigo jerked and pressed Charles’ cock again and the younger wolf let out a soft belch. <br />
<br />
Though it relieved the building pressure, his body softly swelled, growing less firm. It felt good, each tug and jerk on his erect cock had his toes curling in bliss, his nipples so hard they could cut glass. But Charles just couldn’t understand what Rodrigo was doing. This all felt too specific to be a mere handjob.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing down there?” He moaned, tensing up as his cock was played with. <br />
<br />
“Putting in a cheat code bro, hold on a sec,” came a familiar sounding, gravelly voice. <br />
<br />
Charles wasn’t sure he had heard that right. A cheat code? Wait, that voice might have been Rodrigo’s, but the intonation was definitely-<br />
<br />
He groaned as Rodrigo gave Charles’ slippery dick a few more quick tugs and another firm press on his cock. <br />
<br />
Charles suddenly felt himself overwhelmed with a powerful orgasm in addition to a new sensation. As he came, his heavier muscles were covered with a swell of fat. His body grew softer and pudgier, frame widening. With his rounded head and bigger musculature, Charles looked more like a bear than a wolf. <br />
<br />
Then a wave of weariness overtook him as he began to age rapidly. The body hair he’d accumulated started to turn gray, streaks of white appearing in his elegantly trimmed goatee. His long sidecut suddenly trimmed itself into a conservative comb back as the headfur seemed to recede at his temples. As the years piled on, the small belly grew rounder, more bulbous, before sagging softly.<br />
<br />
“There we go, dude. You’re a DILF now!” <br />
<br />
It was that same voice, where had Charles heard it before?<br />
<br />
“F-Finn?” Charlie groaned, still writhing in the midst of the incredible, life-changing orgasm.<br />
<br />
He heard Finn’s chuckle come out of Rodrigo’s mouth. <br />
<br />
It was disturbing, but more disturbing was feeling his old identity slip away as his mind was reprogrammed. Charles moaned as years filled his mind. Retiring from adventuring, settling down with Rodrigo, getting married. He tried to resist, but this new body, these memories were all pleasant and comfortable.<br />
<br />
Like his cock was a control stick, Finn had toyed and tinkered with him until eventually Charles was playing with a new character now. Rodrigo tugged Charles’ cock twice, coaxing another spurt of cum erupting from Charles’ tip. With it went the rest of Charles’ memories. <br />
<br />
All that remained was the fat father figure Finn had wanted all along.<br />
<br />
“And there goes the mind.  Don’t worry, I’m sure you’ll love the new you.  Just don’t fail another roll!” Finn/Rodrigo gloated.<br />
<br />
Charles’ hips continued to buck ineffectually in Rodrigo’s grip. His dazed eyes looked into Rodrigo’s, the lust evident in both.<br />
<br />
“Mmm,” Rodrigo hummed, his voice returning to normal, “you’re looking a bit different, but not quite to my tastes yet.”<br />
<br />
Rodrigo kept working his hands up and down Charles’ shaft, causing tingles of warm lightning to pulsate through his body.<br />
<br />
Charles felt a tightness in his cock as Rodrigo’s hand seemed to grow smaller with each stroke.  But it wasn’t Rodrigo’s hand that was changing – with every stroke Charles’ dick grew longer and wider.  His balls kicked into overdrive, filling with semen until they were about to burst, then growing larger to accommodate.  They kept growing and growing, producing more and more cum, all while Rodrigo kept moving his fingers up and down Charles’ sensitive shaft.<br />
<br />
Finally, Charlie felt a tremendous pressure swelling up inside of him, as though his body had grown as much as it could but it still wasn’t enough to contain the cum inside of him.  He took one last glance at Rodrigo’s smiling muzzle, then rolled his eyes back into his head as his taint clenched, causing his balls rocket upwards, smacking up against the base of his cock, all while a frothing torrent of semen looked for a way out of him.<br />
<br />
Stars exploded in his eyes as his felt his cock flex and spasm while a creamy white liquid gushed onto the wolf sitting next to him. <br />
<br />
Panting, Charles let his body relax as the world around him came back into focus. Rodrigo was there, though he looked smaller than before, and soaking into his abdominal fur was a thick white gel.<br />
<br />
Then Charles looked down at himself.  <br />
<br />
His gut was protruding outward quite a bit, almost enough to block his view of the foot long cock hanging between his legs. Any semblance of musculature on it was long since gone.  For the briefest of moments, he was concerned that he might be, well, fat, but then he looked at his arms and the sight of his bulging biceps told him that he was as strong as ever.  Sure, they were softer thanks to a layer of pudge, but that wasn’t because he was he out of shape.  He was old, and no matter how well he ate or how hard he worked out, that gut of his just didn’t seem to get any smaller.<br />
<br />
“Admiring your belly, sweetheart?” Rodrigo teased.<br />
<br />
Charles blushed as the fatter wolf gave his gut a slap and watched it wobble. <br />
<br />
“Don’t be ashamed. Men our age tend get thicker round the middle.” Rodrigo hefted his own gut for emphasis.<br />
<br />
Charlie smiled at his husband, feeling less self-conscious.<br />
<br />
Rodrigo ran a finger through the cum matting his fur, then brought it to his muzzle and sucked it clean.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm.  I’m going to go get cleaned up.  Why don’t you get ready for bed?”<br />
<br />
Charles watched as Rodrigo picked up the wand of refreshment and began using it to hose himself off.  Perhaps not its intended use, but effective nonetheless.<br />
<br />
As Rodrigo cleaned himself off, Charles tried to pull his pants up, only for them to get caught around his upper thighs.  Charles yanked, trying to suck in his gut, but they wouldn’t rise up over the mounds of flesh in his rear. He didn’t think he’d grown, but for some reason his old pants just couldn’t stretch enough to past his butt cheeks.  <br />
<br />
“Having a little trouble?” came a sly tone from the other side of the room. <br />
<br />
Charles looked up, a blush creeping across his muzzle.<br />
<br />
“When I said get ready for bed, I didn’t mean to go to sleep.” Rodrigo winked as he hosed the last of Charles’ cum off.  <br />
<br />
Charles eyed the handsome wolf. But it wasn’t Rodrigo’s face that interested him – it was the semi-erect cock hanging from Rodrigo’s naked crotch.  His mouth watered and his asshole clenched tightly, almost as if it could sense what it was about to be used for, and was trying to make itself as tight and pleasurable as possible.<br />
<br />
Charles chuckled to himself as he hopped onto the nice sheets that Rodrigo had prepared earlier.  That asshole of his was going to get one hell of a stretching tonight.  Or so he hoped.</p>
