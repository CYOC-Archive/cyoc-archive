<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><b>Flash<br />
Flash</b><br />
<br />
As the flash cleared, I looked down at myself. Sure my body was different again and I was sitting on the floor. I was wearing an orange T-shirt and which seems to be training pants. I looked at my right hand and sure enough the ring was still there. I knew I was three years old again, and I heard crying that caught my attention. <br />
<br />
It was still the same room we were in the last time except now one area has been cleared and that’s for me and the other older kids where at. While the now sophomore and freshman class which are now babies were crying from the playpen. Quite understandable because for the sophomore class, they were just in their mother’s bellies and now they were in a playpen. I bet for the freshman class it was terrifying experience not existing then existing now. Both classes youthful mothers coming in to calm them down.<br />
<br />
A whine next to me caught my attention next, I looked at my left, and there was Gabe. He was two years old, approaching three years old and wearing both training pants and a green T-shirt. Next to him was a three-year-old Brad also wearing training pants but wearing a black T-shirt. I can understand where he was coming from one moment he was in his mom’s belly hearing her heartbeat next thing he knows he was here. Brad was hugging him for some odd reason. It wasn’t until when he started to say that I understand why he was doing this.<br />
<br />
“I kay.” Brad said his limited three year old vocabulary would say comforting Gabe, he was trying to calm Gabe down. Surprisingly next to all three of us were two girls our age, and I recognize both of them. One was the school slut, Ashley but the other was confusing, it was the top heavy  junior cheerleader name Bailey Jackson, but because she was top-heavy and a habit of wearing things with spots some of the time most of us would call her Bessie. Both girls were wearing dresses no doubt with training pants underneath them and they were getting along which is odd because they hate each other.<br />
<br />
I begin to wonder if I ever thought this wish through well enough. Originally, this was so Brad would have plenty of friends with the rest of our classes but I probably did not take in the changing dynamic for others. I mean we start at babies and now we flash-forward to toddlers but while we had memories of our old life, we were experiencing memories of our new life. Even though we skip being two years old, we still remember everything.<br />
<br />
“You know, I question you bring all these people in especially two years ago, but now I see the fruits of that labor.” Came an oddly familiar voice, so I looked up and left. Standing close by us was Mrs. Brockman at the age she would’ve been while we were toddlers. Standing next to her was Tim Brockman, her husband and the father of her children. <br />
<br />
“Yes now our little Brad has many more friends, although there are times I do regret bringing this many people together and not think of the consequences.” Mrs. Brockman said now sporting a seven month pregnant belly no doubt pregnant with Brad‘s little sister Betty. <br />
<br />
To my surprise, a couple came up to them and I was shocked at who they were. This would probably explain why Ashley and Bessie were getting along. Despite the fact they’ve hated each other throughout high school. The man was Ashley’s father, which was odd, but it’s who he had his arm around that was shocking. It was Bessie‘s mom, she was just as top-heavy as her daughter and she was sporting a pregnant belly almost as big as Mrs. Brockman. What the heck happened here?<br />
<br />
“Don’t be that way Julie. It’s not your fault that you invited practically every new mothers and women who were going to give birth in a couple months in the area and not expect things to go wrong.” Bessie’s mother said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah my ex-wife Trixie was always loose. Despite the fact I tried to have her focus on me. So I was not surprised that she would meet a man at these parties two years ago and she cheated on me with him. However, it was your encouragement that allow me to man up during the divorce and take full custody of Ashley.” Ashley‘s father said.<br />
<br />
“Plus you’re one hell of a matchmaker because last year you practically pushed us to talk to one another. We ended up bonding over being single parents admittedly for different reasons. His wife cheated on him a lot and I thought I would never get over Paul’s death when I was still pregnant with Bailey. Next thing we knew one thing to another and now we’re happily married with both our daughters acting as sisters plus with a little one on the way.” Bessie’s mother said, and as if the emphasize her point, she put her hand on her belly.<br />
<br />
“Really?” Ask Mrs. Brockman. “In all honesty James; I thought you were into busty women given how busty Trixie was.” Mrs. Brockman joke. Ashley’s dad blush while both Tim and Bessie’s mom started laughing.<br />
<br />
Oh, so that’s what happened. Such a big change and if things keep going like this, this will be very confusing for both girls once we return to 17 years old. Maybe, I can work with that in a trick for a bit of damage control because I cannot see this ending well for those two unless major changes are made. Taking my attention off of them I looked over to my right and see a family I haven’t truly seen before or perhaps I wasn’t paying attention. It was a man and a woman standing next to a 10-year-old Monique and her twin sister. Both girls were wearing dresses and while Monique was wearing a green flowery dress, not Monique is in a red roses dress.<br />
<br />
Smiling, I managed to get up and start walking over towards the group making grabby hands and sounds. The man, no doubt their father noticed me.<br />
<br />
“Les filles, il semble qu&#39;un petit admirateur vienne vous voir.” Said the man as both girls turn towards me. Monique gave me a smile while not Monique gave a sinister smirk. Not Monique got down on one knee and hang out her hands.<br />
<br />
“Come here, Joey. Come here.” Not Monique said. But as I got closer, it was very clear I wasn’t heading towards her.<br />
<br />
“Moni!” I explained with limited vocabulary as Monique smiled. Her parents laugh while not Monique pouted. Then I got close enough, Monique got down under her knee and hang out her arms. She then grab me and lift me up. I was now face-to-face with her.<br />
<br />
“Hey Joey, how are you doing?” Ask Monique and she turned her face away from me as if they hear me better when I give a response. Being cheeky, I toddler kissed on her cheek. She turned her face towards me, smiled and gave me a kiss on my forehead.<br />
<br />
“It seems my son has a taste for French girls.” A voice came up to us. We turn towards the source and a man I recognize as a young version of my dad came up.<br />
<br />
“It is surprising that he is attached to my daughter Monique, Mister Flynn. It is also oppressed that he can tell the difference between her and her twin Nadia. Not even my own little brother can’t tell the difference.” Monique’s father said in a heavy French accent. Monique transferred me into my father’s arms as he turned to address Monique’s father.<br />
<br />
“He is surprisingly smart for his age Mr. Beaumont. It is lucky that we have met like this through an unlucky source.” My dad said in respond.<br />
<br />
“Indeed, Marcus Flynn it is surprising that I met high-quality business partners like you and Timothy Brockman through a birthday party hosted by his wife.” Mr. Beaumont said. So this is interesting, not only is Brad, my best friend since diapers in this ever changing reality but now my parents are business partners/friends with Monique’s parents. Deciding that this was long enough I finally mentally made a wish the fast-forward to the next birthday party.</p>
