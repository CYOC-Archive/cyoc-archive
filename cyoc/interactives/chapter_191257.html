<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Within a week, Natalia found herself driving to the Tozawa home for dinner. While the idea of turning the family was appealing, that was not why she was going this evening. She was their ti gather intelligence on the wizards, find out any strengths or weaknesses they may have. Perhaps later she would find the opportunity to bring Reiko and her family into the fold.<br />
<br />
Pulling into the Tozawa&#39;s driveway, Natalia now glared at Cassidy and her &quot;father&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright you two,&quot; she warned. &quot;Remember the plan. Gather information and try not to make a scene.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what makes you think we&#39;d make a scene?&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalia frowned as she watched the older male vampire now run his tongue along Cassidy neck, the teenager groaning in ecstacy as she squeezed her firm breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m serious Duncan,&quot; she yelled. &quot;We have to look the part! I doubt you and Cassidy dry humping at the kitchen table will go unnoticed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duncan sighed, brushing his reddish brown hair back as he leaned away from Cassidy. &quot;Now be a good girl for daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I will be,&quot; Cassidy replied lustfully. Natalia could only sigh as she now rang the Tozawas bell.<br />
<br />
Reiko now opened the door, flashing an inviting smile as she invited the trio inside. As Natalia now entered, she studied not only the Tozawa home but Reiko&#39;s body language as well.<br />
<br />
The Tozawa home was traditionally decorated with some more conservative yet beautiful pieces of furniture mixed in. Natalia instantly took this as the style if a woman who was repressing her own desires. Desires Natalia picked up on as she noticed Reiko&#39;s gaze linger on her ample cleavage for just a moment.<br />
<br />
Natalia had made sure to wear an outfit that was modest yet showed off her curvaceous body. Decising on a blouse that gave Reiko a small peak at her cleavage appeared to work like a charm. &quot;Dinner smells wonderful Reiko,&quot; she commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Reiko replied. &quot;Tempura and Mico soup. Its kind of specialty of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the trio now followed Reiko, they continued to make small talk. Duncan playing his part well. A widowed father of Cassidy who had moved to this town for business, along with his sister in law Natalia and his daughter Cassidy. Natalia could only smile as she listened. Despite Duncan&#39;s zealous relationship with the teenage Cassidy, when he needed too he could be charming and personable.<br />
<br />
As the group now sat down, Duncan struck up a conversation with Reiko&#39;s husband Hideo while Cassidy talked with both Naomi and Diane. Natalia was now free to speak with Reiko, hopefully use her charms to gain any insight into the wizards. A knock at the door though interrupted those plans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naomi were you expecting anyone,&quot; Reiko asked, to which the teenage girl shook her head no. Curious, the middle aged woman now answered the door, surprised by who she saw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shiro,&quot; she said happily, hugging her son. &quot;What a pleasant surprise and you brought Jen with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalia watched as two young adults entered the home. Natalia, Duncan, and Cassidy exchanging a look as they watched the young Asian man and a blond woman who appeared to be his girlfriend. The smell of magic was undeniable. The vampires almost entirely sure that these two were wizards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to just drop by unannounced,&quot; Shiro said sheepishly. &quot;But Naomi kind of mentioned what was for dinner.&quot; Reiko now glanced back at her youngest, the girl flashing a wide smile as she went to hug her brother and girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;So does Mika know too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalia now glanced at her compatriots, seeing them shift nervously. Who was Mika?<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually she just pulled in with Claudia and the kids,&quot; Shiro replied. Reiko bow glanced past her son, her face beaming as she saw her grandchildren.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my babies!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Reiko now bent down, picking up the almost 3 year old Kari. &quot;Nana,&quot; Kari exclaimed as she now hung on her grandmothers neck. Reiko squeezed the child tightly as she waved to her daughter and her wife Claudia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Mika, Hello Claudia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey mom,&quot; Mika sighed, the youngest woman looking exhausted as she held her squirming son Aaron. &quot;Hope you don&#39;t mind us dropping by.  Was working late and Naomi mentioned dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We even brought the kids,&quot; Claudia called as she held her daughter Haley. <br />
<br />
&quot;Any chance to see my babies,&quot; Reiko said happily. Inviting her daughter and her family in, Reiko now smiled as she gazed at Natalia. &quot;This my daughter Mika and her wife Claudia,&quot; she said happily. &quot;And these three are my grandchildren. Kari, Aaron, and Haley.&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalia balked, not because Reiko was a grandmother but because of what her grandchildren were. A vampires senses were far more enhanced than a usual humans. Vampires could smell blood, magic, they could even discern the scents of different races of creatures.<br />
<br />
Natalia glanced backwards at Duncan and Cassidy. The two vampires also recognized the scents of the two youngest children. Those children smelled like Oni. Japanese folk creatures and demons. Oni were notoriously chaotic, wild, like the rapids of a river. The vampires had dealt with Oni on a few occasions. Needless to say it was impossible to say how those meetings would end. <br />
<br />
The oldest one though clutched in Reiko&#39;s arms was a scent the vampires had never smelled before. The smell of this child was unique, a combination of magic, cherry blossoms, and the forest. Natalia was befuddled by this, slowly standing as she first looked to Duncan and Cassidy before turning to Reiko.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re so precious,&quot; she said, forcing a smile. &quot;Excuse me Reiko, can I use your bathroom?&quot; Reiko nodded, gesturing to a room upstairs. Natalia now excused herself, her compatriots giving her a warm look as the female vampire made her way out of the room.<br />
<br />
Racing upstairs, Natalia closed the door, before pulling out her cellphone. The sheer amount of magic in the house had changed the odds for the vampires. When it was Naomi and Diane, Natalia was confident that the three of them would be able to handle the wizards if they discovered what they were. Now, with the inclusion of four very powerful wizards as well as these children, Natalia had her doubts. <br />
<br />
Pulling out her cellphone, Natalia immediately dialed a number. &quot;Pick up, pick up,&quot; she hissed. Their was only one vampire who could possibly give her an answer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; a voice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Selene,&quot; Natalia whispered. &quot;What can you tell me about the Tozawa&#39;s grandchildren?&quot;<br />
<br />
Selene, the former lich turned vampire, had been an invaluable asset since Miro had turned her. The former liches magic was formidable, however, her transformation into a vampire had been troublesome. Liches kept their souls entombed within an enchanted item. When she had been regressed and given life the soul had remained inside that item. <br />
<br />
Miro had thought at first that turning the old witch would allow the parasitic spirit of a vampire to inhabit the former liches body. Instead, Selenes actual soul now shared its body with the parasitic demon. Selene may have the strength of a vampire but she was a wildcard. She owed no allegiance to the vampires, did not confirm to the laws of the vampire nation. Selene was loyal only to herself and while thankful to have the strength of a vampire, Natalia worried how long before she betrayed them.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Tozawa grandchildren,&quot; Selene exclaimed. &quot;What about them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m at the Tozawa&#39;s home now,&quot; Natalia said quietly. &quot;I can smell the children. I know two of them are Oni but the oldest. I&#39;ve...I&#39;ve never smelled anything like that before. What is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
A long pause now stretched on the other end. Natalia worried the phone had been disconnected. &quot;You&#39;re right about the two youngest,&quot; Selen finally said. &quot;From what I&#39;ve learned the twins are kintaro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is a Kintaro?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tiger demon,&quot; Selene stated. &quot;The oldest though is the one you should be worried about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
A another pause on the other end was almost maddening to Natalia. Selene seemed to know what they were dealing with. If the recently minted vampire didn&#39;t give her answer, she swore she would stake her through the heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know what a kitsune is,&quot; Selene finally asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kitsune are a race of magical fox creatures,&quot; Selene answered. &quot;Incredibly rare, incredibly powerful, and very, VERY, protective of their kits. From the rumors I&#39;ve heard that child is connected to the leader of the kitsune.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve dealt with more than my share of rulers over the years,&quot; Natalia scoffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t seem to understand Natalia,&quot; Selene exclaimed. &quot;The leader of the kitsune is a near God! Skilled, magical, and stronger than anything you&#39;ve ever encountered. It&#39;s only a rumor but supposedly that child is his daughter. If any if you were to hurt that child, I have no doubt he would hunt you down and destroy you as well as the entire vampire nation!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He can&#39;t possibly be that powerful,&quot; Natalia replied nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before I joined the vampires I worked with his son,&quot; Selene stated. &quot;Fukushu was perhaps stronger than even Miro and even HE said that his father would crush him in battle with ease. Trust me when I say this Selene, making any threatening moves against that child would be signing your own death warrant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalia simply nodded, hanging up the phone as she exhaled. She would need to tread carefully in how she dealt with the Tozawas.</p>
