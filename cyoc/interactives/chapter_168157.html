<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Tfw when you just want to have a sexy transformation and instead write someone a sympathetic character, backstory and lore.<br/>
<br/>
Actual potentially important note: I noticed that Mike and Jeff&#39;s names were mixed up by someone in one of the previous chapters on this branch. It shouldn&#39;t matter too much considering they have new names (and bodies) now, but some of my options listed here are directly inspired by the personality traits they were introduced with and decided to just keep everything the way it is now to avoid more confusion. Just keep that in mind if you wanna continue one of these.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well, that leaves only me and you two,” Anat, horsewoman of war, announced as she approached the twins. “Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t be so cruel to tear you two apart. I can easily take care of both of you.”<br />
<br />
Anat’s words did nothing to lessen the fear she could see in… pretty much their whole bodies. She let out a sigh. “Lilith, you did inform them what was about to happen, right?”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, but we wanted to be back as soon as possible so we could be done before dinner.”<br />
<br />
The sigh turned to a groan. “Wish Di was here, she&#39;s much better at this,” she muttered under her breath. Anat bent down to be on eye-level with the twins, or rather tried, she still towered a full head over them. “Look girls, eh… Mia and Nicole was it, right?” She didn&#39;t get a response. “I can understand that you probably just went through some very tough times. Monsters invading your home, being saved by a demon who claims to be your friend and then watching another friend being turned into… whatever Galib’s into…” She pointed at Erra.<br />
<br />
“I was once like you, well not exactly, but…eh… Anyways, the earth’s kind of on a constant loop. Every few millennia demons, angels or sometimes both descend on the planet to cause destruction and give humanity pretty much a soft reset. The last time this happened I was just a normal girl like you. I managed to catch the attention of Ares, the former horseman of war, when trying to fight against some demons and he turned me into what you see now.<br />
<br />
“I want you to know that you don&#39;t have to be afraid. You&#39;re currently in one of the safest places in all realms. Nobody here intends to harm you, unless you try something stupid. Princess Carmilla not only saved you, she gave you the chance to become something far greater. We demons aren&#39;t really as bad as the first impression might suggest. I got the body of a badass amazon warrior,” –of course she flexed at that– “the job pays well and I got a loving wife, who’d probably squee at how adorable you are… her words, not mine. And just so you know, if you decline I’ll just have to find someone else to become my successor and you two, best case, you’ll become the princess’ two-headed pet hydra, worst case, back to earth. So, what do ya say, wanna become my daughters?”<br />
<br />
The twins still looked apprehensive, but then Nicole spoke up, head held low, “When they attacked… I could do nothing… I just took Mia’s hand… and ran away…”<br />
<br />
Mia started to slowly come out from behind her sister, tears already running down her face, “Mommy, Daddy, Benny, David… I just stood there and w-watched as they k-killed them… if… if Nica didn&#39;t drag me away…”<br />
<br />
Then both said at once, “Can you protect my sister?”<br />
<br />
Anat grinned, “Nope.”<br />
<br />
With all tension suddenly gone the twins gave the demon confused looks.<br />
<br />
“I’ll give you the power to protect each other.” <br />
<br />
Anat put one hand on each of their shoulders and both girls felt her flaming aura flowing into her. Nicole accepted it without issue. Mia still had some reservations and looked in the direction of Carmilla. The princess gave her a smile and just for a moment Mia could see again the human girl that had been her best friend for many years and she had developed a small crush on. With that she let the energy freely flow through her body.<br />
<br />
Nicole felt a burning in her extremities. She felt her thighs becoming even more pronounced with new muscles, while small yellow scales formed all over her legs. Her toes became longer and ripped through her shoes as they turned into strong talons. Long, red feather came out of her arms as her hands turned into claws. Tailfeathers came out of her back and while her hair stayed the same length it turned into the same color as her feathers. Her remaining clothes shifted into golden armor protecting her chest (with nipple spikes), crotch and legs. It was rounded out by a helmet in the shape of a hawk.<br />
<br />
Mia felt her body stiffen. As everything started to harden and whiten her joints turned to ball-joints. Only her breasts seemed to defy her hardening, as they grew slightly and, if anything, became bouncier. First the toes and then her whole legs were absorbed back into her legs, which thinned out until they ended in sharp points. Mia felt most of her facial features flatten away, leaving only eyes and the shape of her nose. The rest, like pupils, eyelashes and even mouth, became mere painted-on decoration. Her blond hair became golden, as her clothes turned into a black and red dress (or rather combat skirt). She turned into a living doll, but not just an ordinary doll, as her body was filled with various weapons she could draw out and back at will.<br />
<br />
With the physical changes done this left only their new memories. Their new lives, their roles in the demonic court, their mother Anat, horsewoman of war, and her wife, Diana. Nicole became Neith, a demonic harpy unmatched in speed in the air and on the ground. Mia was now Menhit, a literal war machine. Both kneeled in front of Anat. “Thank you for giving us this great gift, mother,” they said, with Menhit’s voice coming out without her moving her lips. <br />
<br />
“Which of the two did you choose to become your successor?” Lucifer asked.<br />
<br />
“Both. I equally divided the essence of the horseman between them.” She ignored the concerned looks from the other horsemen. Not even Deonna knew what exactly that meant. Instead Anat addressed her daughters again. “Girls, show them your little trick!”<br />
<br />
The even more unequal twins immediately knew what she meant. They faced each other as they interlocked their fingers and a red light enveloped their bodies. When the light faded the twins were gone and a giant amazon of a (demon) woman was standing in their place. Her size was the combined height of the two girls and her body carried the chests of Menhit and the thighs of Neith. The legs ended in talons with blades instead of nails and built-in sharp-pointed high heels. Strong arms were held together by doll-joints, while giant wings ending in bladed claws came out of her back. She wore a golden breastplate (with nipple-spikes, again), which left a deep cleavage and transitioned into a black and red combat skirt with a hole for her tailfeathers. Out of her hawk-shaped helmet came golden hair that turned red at the tips. Her face carried the features of Neith, while the doll mask of Menhit’s face was set in her bosom, still featuring the same smile.<br />
<br />
The woman kneeled in front of the others. “We are the combined form of Menhit and Neith,” she said, both voices coming out of her mouth. “We are Mennith, the daughter of war.” After that the fused demon glowed again, dividing back into Menhit and Neith, the latter literally standing on the former’s shoulders. <br />
<br />
Anat approached her daughters. “Well done, you two. Now I still have some business here, so you should have enough time to show the princess how grateful you are. And I mean, really show her,” she punctuated with a dirty grin. “After that we’ll see how many windows will survive Diana seeing you two. And by the way, if anyone asks I found you two while you were defending yourselves single-handedly against a squadron of demons, gotta keep my image.” Then she turned to the other horsemen. “And if anything that happened here ever leaves this room I’ll introduce that demon’s business end to the business end of a spear!”<br />
<br />
Deonna watched as Menhit and Neith ran over to Carmilla and Erra and the four demon girls embraced each other. She smiled at the four friends being reunited again… and then starting to sloppily kiss each other… and then starting to do what Deonna and her friends did earlier (at the exact same spot, in fact). She continued smiling until she couldn&#39;t take it anymore, grabbing Mania and ramming her tongue into her mouth, Jahi soon joining.<br />
<br />
“Aw, being young again~” Lilith cooed as she watched her daughters while casually fondling Limos’ chest.</p>
