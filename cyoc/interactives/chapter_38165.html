<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>"Where to?" asked Samantha.
<P>"Around the park," Tricia said as she took the remote from her friend. "To show off our new looks."
<P>Sam checked herself over just to be sure she was back to normal. "I don't have a new look," she said. Then it dawned on her. "Ugh. What are you going to do?"
<P>Trish gave Sam a cute smile before punching more buttons on the remote. "I've always wanted my own pet to walk," she said.
<P>Sam waited patiently, sighing frequently, until Trish was done programming her new form. She prepared herself for the worst.
<P>"Now I don't want you to be frightened. Just relax and enjoy the change."
<P>"Yeah, that's comforting," Sam retorted. "Now I'm more scared than ever."
<P>Trish giggled as she shot Sam with the remote again, then turned her back. Instantly, Sam's clothes vanished. Unlike the other times when it transformed into something different, the vague form of the fabric didn't linger. She was rendered completely naked. Sam covered her crotch with one hand and crossed the other arm over her breasts. "TRISH!"
<P>"Not so loud," Trish said, still looking in the opposite direction. She seemed to be working on the remote some more. "People might come around these bushes and see you."
<P>Samantha was suddenly very grateful they had found a secluded area of the park for this. She didn't have long to think about it, however, as more changes happened across her body.
<P>The first thing she felt was an uncomfortable itching that accompanied the growth of brown fur. In minutes, her entire body was covered from head to toe in thick black and brown hair. Her muscles ached as they gained girth and strength. She saw herself rising up, probably two feet or more. Her legs reshaped into animal hindquarters. Surprisingly, there was no pain involved, although she could hear bones bending and cracking as they took on an inhuman structure. Her feet lengthened from the heel to the toe, gaining her even more height. Her toes merged together and hardened into a solid black substance that molded into the shape of large cloven hooves. She could feel her body gaining bulk, especially the upper parts. She was forced to hunch over from the new weight.
<P>"What--" Sam cut herself off for a second in reaction to the deep, monstrously distorted voice that came from her own throat. Her mouth and tongue were lengthening, her teeth sharpening. It was making it harder and harder for her to speak clearly. "What...did yooouuu...grr...do tooo...snarl...mmme?"
<P>She squinted through strained eyes. The world was losing its color rapidly, and she was having trouble focusing. She didn't hear Trish answer her, but she thought she could see her body moving farther away. She reached a hairy arm out toward her friend, and realized for that it no longer had a hand at the end. Instead, they had been turned into hooves as large as the ones she was standing on.
<P>The motion of raising her arm had thrown her off-balance, and she found herself unable to right her massive body. With a resounding thud, her fore-hooves hit the ground, digging into the dirt. Her neck lengthened and thickened to continue her distortion into a four-legged animal.
<P>"Trrrr...Trrrisshhh...aaarrrr...!" She could no longer speak. Her calls to her friend were degenerating into the snarls of a beast. She was really scared.
<P>The changes continued mercilessly. Her fur pelt thickened around her hooves, nearly covering them in black fur. Her hair joined with growing fur on her back, chest, and shoulders to create a massive shaggy black mane. A stretching sensation in her spine told her a tail was forming. It snaked out behind her a good four feet, covered in long messy black hair. Her head pounded as two thick horns burst from her scalp, growing out of her monstrous mane and curving up and around. She was glad she couldn't see them. Had she a large enough mirror, she would have seen them curve in a semicircle three feet wide and then arc down on either side of her shoulders. They were dark gray and thickly ribbed.
<P>Thick yellowish fangs poked out of her square-shaped lower jaw. Long brown fur-covered ears flopped from the sides of her head. From out of her spine grew little horn-shaped spikes that started at her neck and poked out of her hair in decreasing size as they ran down to her tail.
<P>The changes finally felt like they were subsiding, but Sam still had a lingering itchy feeling all over from her newly grown fur. She couldn't stand it, so she aggressively shook her entire body. Long black hair darted in front of her eyes and her brown fur everywhere else shifted and settled back into place. She threw her head up twice to get the hair out of her eyes.
<P>Finally regaining her full senses, she looked down at her hooves. They were sunk in several inches into the ground. She felt strong as a giant...and nearly as big. She tentatively picked a hoof up, shifting her weight onto the other three, and flexed the foreleg. Her muscles felt limber and powerful. She felt a sudden urge to run a marathon through the park.
<P>She tried again to speak, but when she attempted a mere whisper, she only elicited a rumbling grunt.
<P>With her grayscale vision now able to focus, she noticed a small figure standing in front of her. It looked like Trish, but she was incredibly tiny. Had Sam grown that big?!
<P>"Well? What do you think?" came her little voice. Sam was able to pick it up very clearly with her new goat-like ears...but something sounded different about the voice. It was much higher-pitched.
<P>Sam knelt down, folding her legs beneath her. She made a dull thud on the ground. Now that she was much closer, she could see what had happened. Tricia had actually made herself smaller...no, younger! She barely looked over the age of five. Her pretty Goth dress and curls remained the same, though, as did the unsettlingly cheerful smile on her pretty little face.
<P>"I'm going to need a big strong guardian if I'm going to be walking around without my parents," she said innocently. "Ready for your walk?"
<P>Sam grunted in protest. Trish bravely walked up to the hulking beast she had created. She hugged as much of Sam's neck as she could get her arms around. "Don't worry about causing a panic," she said as she stroked Sam's long scraggly fur. "I set the remote so that everyone will think this is normal."
<P>How could nobody think this was normal? was the question Sam wanted to ask. Even on all fours, she was somewhere between eight and twelve feet tall. She didn't even want to think of looking at her full body in a reflection. She was sure she'd suffer a heart attack.
<P>Another blinding light from the remote choked Sam. She instinctively straightened her upper body, and she tried to feel her neck to see what had happened, but her hooves merely clunked together uselessly.
<P>She saw a line hanging from her down to Trish's hand. It was a leash! Trish must have created a collar and leash.
<P>"I didn't want you to go running off," Trish said, giggling like the little girl she was. "Come on, it'll be fun. We'll play fetch or something...whatever giant hellbeasts like to do."
<P>Sam couldn't voice her protest as Trish dragged her along and out into the public areas of the park. Somehow the tiny girl was able to pull hard enough against Sam's attempts to stay put. There must have been some kind of magic in the collar that made Trish's pulling on the collar superior to her own beastly strength.
<P>And so, together, the pretty little Goth girl and her fearsome pet set off for a walk through the park and its innocent, unsuspecting populace.</p>
