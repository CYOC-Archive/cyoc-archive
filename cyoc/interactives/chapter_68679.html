<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ok folks, here is the rule for the second round of dancing and bidding! Still no penetration of the dancers. You can touch them, get them to touch you, anything but penetration with tongues, or other things.” Ozzy the otter gave a soft barking cough for emphasis. “The dancers may remove their thongs once you buy them, if they desire. Once again, that’s up to them!”<br />
<br />
A lusty cheer went up from the crowd.<br />
<br />
“So! Without further delay! Welcome our first dancer Rufus!”<br />
<br />
The crowd cheered as the roo boy jumped on the bar to start his routine.<br />
<br />
-	*	 -<br />
<br />
Onca lay on the floor of the break room looking up at Fennec and Bane on the couch. Unlike last time none of them was paying attention to Rufus on the television.<br />
<br />
“You two are such amazing dancers. I wish I was as good as you guys.”<br />
<br />
Fennec chuckled but looked at Onca with serious compassion. “Dude, this is my 6th time doing this. My first time I was no better than you. Each time you get better. If you sign up some more times you will be every bit as good as me. As for Bane, he is just an animal.” Fennec ran his sharp fingernails down Bane’s leg causing him to emit a low sensual growl. “He has a rare natural gift, believe me it’s been noticed. Don’t use Bane as a measure of your own ability.”<br />
<br />
Onca nodded at Fennec, “Thanks for that. I look at Rufus dancing and….he just kinda sucks.” All three boys laughed at that.<br />
<br />
“He’s a little weak in the talent department”, admitted Fennec. Bane just nodded his agreement. “Ozzy should have made him a waiter.”<br />
<br />
“Any suggestions for me to get better?” It was obvious the fox had the panther’s undivided attention.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Play with the customers. Throw out the last of your inhibitions and just go for it.” The fox was grinning from ear to ear. “After the dance, take a shower. I know that’s where I’ll be after the next dance.”<br />
<br />
“Me too.” Added Bane.<br />
<br />
“What happened to you guys?” Onca looked a little baffled. “You look different, sexier somehow. For some reason my memory is a little clouded about exactly how you two used to look.” <br />
<br />
Fennec and Bane exchanged a brief look of concern, but the expression quickly faded from both of them and was replaced by lewd grins as they admired each other’s reclining bodies.<br />
<br />
“Trust me Onca, you really want to take that shower”, said Bane as a very feral grin crossed his face. His new fangs were visible to Onca and gleaming white.<br />
<br />
The look alone was almost enough to make the panther boy cum in his thong, he bucked his hips and moaned, but stopped short. After Onca regained his composure he asked, “You sure you guys won’t mind? It sounded like you were having sex in there” <br />
<br />
At this Bane ran his claw-like fingernails down Fennec’s leg causing him to yip and buck. Another moan escaped Fennec before he pulled himself together. <br />
<br />
Fennec slapped Banes hand lightly as he said, “Bad wolf!” Once the laughter stopped Fennec looked at Onca and continued. “We are dancing on tables semi-naked for strangers. Later tonight we will likely be dancing naked and having sexual encounters with total strangers in public. I thank you for worrying about our privacy, but I think both Bane and I are totally beyond that worry. We don’t care if you watch, hell, join in if it looks fun.”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely Onca, you’re cool. Besides it would be a shame if that kitty cock made it all night without exploding a few times. It’s really awesome when you stop fighting it and just give in. Be you animal Onca! Embrace your panther!”<br />
<br />
“Jeese Bane, weren’t you the scared straight kid when you got here? The one that didn’t know what he was into?” Onca looked at Bane closely, his tail thrashing. Onca was  doing his best to read the wolf boy’s soul.<br />
<br />
Bane thought a moment before answering. “Yeah, that was pretty much me. A scared human kid feeling trapped in a box with no way out. The dancing though just speaks to my soul. I’m not the kid Jake, I have truly become Bane. Frankly I hope I am always Bane. I don’t want this to end, and I don’t care if I never hear that human name again.<br />
<br />
Onca watched Bane intensely as he spoke, then closed his eyes and nodded. “I’m very envious of you. I will do as you two say and force myself to embrace what I am.<br />
<br />
A moment of silence passed in the conversation even as percussive trance music belted out of the TV speakers. The roo boy’s dance was nearing it’s climax.<br />
<br />
“There is just one more question I have for both of you.” Onca looked like he might not finish the question, but given the discussion already he felt it would be stupid not to ask. “Are the two of you an item? Are you having a relationship?”<br />
<br />
Fennec shrugged, then looked at Bane. “Do you want to?”<br />
<br />
Bane answered immediately, “Fuck yes you sexy beast.”<br />
<br />
With that the fox and wolf boys embraced and exchanged a long passionate kiss that lasted over a minute as their tongues explored each other’s mouths. They broke apart with feral grins on their faces.  The bidding on Rufus could be faintly heard in the background as the boys leaned back into their respective ends of the couch.<br />
 <br />
“I guess it’s gonna have to be an open relationship though. I know I fully intend to suck Onca’s cock in the shower if he joins us.” Bane was grinning from ear to ear watching Onca turn bright red. <br />
<br />
“Yes!” Fennec answered immediately, “Besides I fully intend to plunge my cock into his beautiful panther ass…And then there are the customers to consider…”<br />
<br />
After a moment of stuttering silence from the panther boy, the fox and wolf broke into gales of laughter. <br />
<br />
Suddenly one sentence burst into all of their minds. “And now folks it’s time for our second dancer! Let’s have a big hand and howl for Onca! The sexiest cat in the jungle!” The roar of the crowd could be heard down the hallway as Onca leapt to his feet and ran for the bar. Fennec gave the panther boy a playful swat on the ass as he ran past.<br />
<br />
“Think he’ll actually do it?”, Bane asked Fennec speculatively.<br />
<br />
“I have no idea, but whatever happens you and I are gonna have a blast and tear this place up.” Fennec leaned over to Bane and embraced him once again. They exchanged yet another intense kiss as Onca began his routine.</p>
