<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The paper wasn’t crumpled too badly. Still easily legible. That was good. Kelly wasn’t sure what she would do if her scaly belly had shredded it. There was a fair bit of text, and she only had 15 minutes, but luckily Kelly was a very fast reader.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for purchasing Lamia Leggings from Mana Industries Inc,™ the makers of the finest enchantments on the market.”<br />
<br />
‘How did I miss the manufacturer?” Kelly wondered. ‘This is what I get for impulse buying, I guess.’<br />
<br />
Magic was a relatively new phenomenon. Or at least relatively rediscovered. Neither Kelly nor Jake had any capacity for it (magic-sensitive people were supremely rare), so really didn’t take much interest. According to researchers, it apparently waxes and wanes over the course of centuries, and started coming back late in 2012.<br />
<br />
So far, people hadn’t been able to do much with it, and the massive hype from its discovery had died down. Mostly it was used to amplify the effects of some chemicals, reinforce some materials, and replace electricity in some products. Their air conditioner for instance was powered by a cold enchantment rather than older methods. Useful to be sure, but magic was surprisingly boring in its application.<br />
<br />
‘Or it had been, anyway,’ Kelly thought. ‘If they can do this,’ she looked down at her snake tail, ‘how was the breakthrough not all over the news?’<br />
<br />
“You are one of the first people given the opportunity to participate in our open beta and test our new line of products, powered by major breakthrough in arcana and archaeology.”<br />
<br />
‘Figures…’<br />
<br />
“Rest assured that our products have been thoroughly tested, and are safe and stable for consumer use. Discoveries of ancient remains of magical species, long since extinct, have been combined with the naturally increasing global mana supply has led to remarkable and rapid advances in magical theory.<br />
By imprinting the magical essence of these extinct magical creatures onto our premium blend of silk and synthetic fabrics, we are able to allow our customers to take the form of these spectacular beings.”<br />
<br />
Kelly smiled. This was so cool! And it sounds like it’s perfectly safe too!<br />
<br />
“Please enjoy your new body! We would appreciate if you would fill out the survey (see the attached form) once you’ve acclimated. With your help, we hope to be able to arrange a wide public release by mid 2022!”<br />
<br />
Kelly looked around the packaging for the leggings, finding the survey, along with a separate instruction sheet; one with big bold lettering at the top saying “ALERT! Read carefully before using!” She sighed.<br />
<br />
“Warning! This product is a new form of enchantment approved for limited public testing. It will cause bodily transformation unlike any previous magic that has been employed. Make sure you are prepared for this prior to using. The transformation is progressive, occurring in stages. You will NOT be able to return to your normal form until the transformation has been concluded.”<br />
<br />
Then there were some boiler plate disclaimers about pregnancy and heart conditions, but nothing that really concerned Kelly. After that came the product-specific instructions.<br />
<br />
“Instructions for use: Apply Lamia Leggings to the lower body. This product will only function when both legs are encased at least up to the knee. Place the upper lip of the leggings at the height you desire your lower body to remain human.”<br />
<br />
‘So if I hadn’t pulled the leggings up all the way, I could have kept a human vagina, and Jake could have kept his dick,’ Kelly thought. She didn’t feel at all disappointed though.<br />
<br />
“Initial transformation of the affected area into an equal-weight Lamia tail will occur within 1-3 minutes. Some customers may experience mild discomfort or pressure during this process.<br />
<br />
Progressing the transformation further and generating increases in mass requires additional energy, generated either by consuming large amounts of food, or through vigorous activity.”<br />
<br />
‘Like sex, maybe?’ Kelly smiled, feeling a bit of warm wetness beginning to build in her slit. She was also feeling a little hungry. She hadn’t actually eaten over her lunch break.<br />
<br />
“Transformation will progress as follows:”<br />
<br />
The instructions showed a diagram, beginning with a figure of a fairly average looking woman in what looked like a sports bra, and a flat, stubby snake tail only a little longer than her legs would have been. An arrow then pointed to a final form.<br />
<br />
“Wow.” Kelly was REALLY looking forward to this. The final figure had a much longer tail, stretching at least five times as long as the upper body. It was as thick around at the torso as the figures widened hips. The figure also had considerably larger breasts. ‘This is going to be SO hot!’<br />
<br />
“Notice: Female-specific products (Lamia Leggings, Succubus Cloak, Siren Skirt, etc) are not recommended for use by men. Based on archaeological examination, these appear to have been all-female species. Male subjects will become female for the duration of the transformation.”<br />
<br />
‘Well, that explains that.’ She really should have read the instructions first. But a good part of her was actually happy she didn’t. Getting Jake off with his nice snakey slit was very fun. Kelly also figured that, if Lamia were all female, they must be at least bisexual. She’d never found other women attractive before, but she found the idea of Jake transforming more so very enticing.<br />
<br />
“LAMIA FEATURES: A fully transformed Lamia has a snake body stretching between 15 and 30ft from the end of the human torso. They possess long, forked tongues and a Jacobsen’s Organ. They are also able to perceive body heat.<br />
Notice: Lamia have venomous fangs. Be cautious when interacting with non-lamia. The venom has paralytic and narcotic effects on mammals. Other Lamia are immune to this, and most other toxins.<br />
Lamia are also highly resistant to cold, and have a high sex drive.”<br />
<br />
‘Yeah, no shit. Guess that explains the product description.’<br />
<br />
“Reversal Instructions: To return to human form, turn the leggings inside-out and stretch it over your snake tail. The leggings will absorb the spell from your body, allowing it to revert to its default form. Continue to pull up the leggings as the tail shrinks until all of the affected area is covered. Full reversal will then complete within 1-5 minutes.”<br />
<br />
‘Pretty simple,’ she thought.<br />
<br />
“NOTICE: This process cannot be done until the initial magic has run its course, and the transformation into a Lamia has been completed.<br />
<br />
WARNING: Reversal must occur within 7 days of application of the leggings. After that, your body will have acclimated, and your transformed state will become your default form.<br />
Reversal will then be possible only with an additional product (Human Stockings), but ONLY after a month has passed (residual magic from the Lamia Leggings will otherwise interfere with other products).”<br />
<br />
‘A whole week. Tons of time to have fun.’<br />
<br />
“WARNING: Take care and use protection with your partner. Pregnancy will prevent reversal until the pregnancy has run its course or been terminated.”<br />
<br />
‘No worries there,’ she smiled. Her pussy tingled at the thought, “We’re both girls after all!’ The thought of Jake growing a nice pair of tits was really turning her on. And being Friday with a long weekend coming up, she couldn’t WAIT for the work day to be over! Jake was in for a world of new experiences!<br />
<br />
“Kelly! I made sandwiches!” Jake called from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Her stomach grumbled loudly. She looked up at the clock: 3:05. She was very glad she was a fast reader. <br />
<br />
“Coming!” She dropped the paper and quickly slithered into the kitchen. The paper drifted to the floor, forgotten. At the bottom of the page was a final warning that Kelly never got around to reading;<br />
<br />
“Warning! Be careful while performing oral intercourse! Lamia are capable of impregnating other Lamia. Orgasming while giving oral intercourse will cause a Lamia’s fangs to spray venom. Lamia venom can function to fertilize Lamia eggs.”</p>
