<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a dusky evening that saw Greg and Lee enjoying what was building up to be their usual hangout and sleepover. Both boys were eager to live it up on that Friday Night - they could enjoy video games and TV shows well into the night, chat about what went on in high school that week, and vent about their brothers. Greg had Clyde, and Lee had Garrett - both were out and about that night, not likely to come home. All the better, usually. The two elder brothers...were Influencers. Specifically, on Tiktok and Instagram - and they distinctly occupied a space in the fitness and lifestyle arena. And they were every bit as onerous to know as one might expect.<br />
<br />
Greg and Lee were both skinny, thin nerdy boys - and both were treated as something approaching distraction or embarrassment by their elder siblings. Greg had thick, messy blond hair, often greasy and left in poor condition. He had a bit of a skinny fat look, making his appearance without a shirt even worse than it might otherwise suggest. He had the same blue eyes as his brother, but they were often covered by glasses.<br />
<br />
Lee meanwhile had dark hair cut rather haphazardly, and was more just plain skinny as opposed to Greg&#39;s look. Lee in particular had some resentment of the fact that apparently, Garrett used to be as skinny as he was...and then puberty and other things along with all that muscle building hit him like a truck. Now, Garrett was a tall, muscled hunk, and Lee was left to watch the revolving door of girlfriends.<br />
<br />
Especially for their younger brothers. Not a day went by when Clyde and Garrett weren&#39;t flaunting their bodies, making fun of their younger brothers for lacking &quot;Social Swag&quot;, and even occasionally body shaming them on livestream - to millions of likes by fellow teens their age and younger.<br />
<br />
Greg laid out on the couch, clicking through TV Shows. &quot;Man, it&#39;s nice to have a day when we can just be ourselves and not have to deal with it all, right?&quot; He recalled Clyde roping him into a Tiktok - and making the &quot;hilarious twist&quot; be that someone as &quot;trendy and hot&quot; as Clyde had to have a brother like Greg to &quot;balance things out&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it sure is,&quot; said Lee. On Lee&#39;s part, he would very often see Garrett swaggering around the house in just a pair of boxers. Eminently pleased with his own good looks. And honestly, it got...just, so grating to basically see his brother&#39;s dick pressing up against his underwear nine times outta ten. Lee had attempted a few times to ask his brother to please, put on some clothes, and the response amounted to &quot;Yeah&quot;, &quot;Sure&quot;, or the much more direct and open &quot;You&#39;re just mad you don&#39;t have a nice ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I honestly can&#39;t believe Clyde and Garrett put so much effort into their looks like that,&quot; Greg commented as an ad for a muscle-building supplement played on screen. &quot;Not just their muscles. They&#39;re total pretty boys.&quot; That was another thing about their vanity - they never really left it at just how good their bodies looked. No, they were that swaggering brand of utter ego that couldn&#39;t leave the house without caking six different products on their faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know. Garrett&#39;s just trying to get attention, and he gets that from girls with his body,&quot; said Lee. &quot;And his face. Unfair, to be honest. I try my hardest to get good grades, to distinguish myself. But Garrett moisturizes every night, works out, and all the girls can talk about is how he looks.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t say Clyde&#39;s really doing it for the same reasons. It&#39;s more that he&#39;s obsessed with fitness,&quot; said Greg. &quot;He&#39;s been like that ever since freshman year. He&#39;ll stand for minutes making these Instagram Posts, pouting and giving a look at the camera. I think he&#39;s in love with himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh,&quot; said Lee. &quot;They both suck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So glad they&#39;re not here,&quot; said Greg. &quot;Can&#39;t wait until the summer. At least then they&#39;ll be gone most times - off... I dunno, &quot;vacaying&quot; or whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can finally get the place to ourselves,&quot; said Lee. &quot;Apparently those two are gonna be joining a bunch of other insufferable halfwits for a &quot;beach adventure&quot;.&quot; Fancy way of saying &quot;fucking their way up and down Cancun&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda wish I could understand it, to be perfectly honest,&quot; Greg said as he looked on his phone - which had buzzed to let him know about some news on the current phase of Marvel movies. &quot;I mean, what&#39;s the point? I just cannot figure out why these guys spend so much time---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There has to be more to life than six pack abs and bitches,&quot; said Lee. &quot;Has to be. Just wish I knew what they found so appealing about it all. It seems so banal. So little thinking. So little processing. No real intellectual investment...&quot; He sighed, leaning back and looking up at the sky, swearing he saw something up there. A light starting to shine.<br />
<br />
As Greg looked out the window, he saw a comet fly by in the slowly darkening evening sky. And though he didn&#39;t say anything, he felt a weird tingling feeling - little did he know that Lee felt it too. Both decided not to mention any odd feeling to the other, figuring it would probably just fade with time. Maybe they had just been...sitting badly. Posture wasn&#39;t exactly in their list of priorities, typically.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t get it either,&quot; Greg continued, trying to ignore the odd feeling that was already slowly and seemingly fading, &quot;Why put in that much effort on the sides of the abs? What was that called? Obliques?&quot; Greg then felt something ache suddenly in his stomach - the moment he finished saying that. He was confused, as it felt like when he had to do crunches in PE, when the last time he had PE was a year ago.<br />
Lee just nodded along, not sharing that he felt an ache in his stomach too. Neither young man realizing that in that moment, their flat, untoned midsections had suddenly toned - muscle sculpting itself underneath, forming a distinct six pack.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s not these little et cetera muscles, it&#39;s freaking out over a spot on their faces.&quot; Lee recalled, cupping his chin as he leaned against the wall, &quot;I mean, Garrett one time freaked out like hell over a single pimple.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clyde does the same thing,&quot; Greg said, &quot;One time, his face broke out with spots all over. He went on a rampage trying to find the best spot remover. I swear, dude will even use foundation to make sure his IG posts look good.&quot; Yet even as Greg said that, both he and Lee&#39;s faces cleared up. As if they themselves had applied some good moisturizer and cleanser to make themselves look as good as they could. And somehow neither noticed the slow changes in their faces.<br />
<br />
Any remaining acne spots or scars smoothed over, skin becoming smooth and perfectly treated. Their boyish, thin countenances also began looking somewhat more handsome. Their jaws became sharper, their eyebrows thinned, and their hair looked fuller and glossier. &quot;Well, if Clyde and Garrett want to waste their money, I guess that&#39;s their choice,&quot; said Greg. &quot;Have you seen some of the workouts that those two do? They stream em on their socials.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They sure do,&quot; said Lee. &quot;And I mean, why? Why do they think the entire world wants to hear two oversexed goons grunt out numbers over and over again...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be doing way more interesting things than working out if I were them,&quot; said Greg. &quot;Just yesterday they made a whole video about their shoulder workout.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shoulders...huh.&quot; Lee shrugged, not noticing as he raised his shoulders, they began bulking up under his shirt. As he lowered them, he rolled his shoulders, feeling an odd ache - and in the process, the lateral, frontal and rear delts all bulged with muscle. Swelling up underneath his shirt and filling out the sleeves much more thoroughly. He just figured his shoulders were aching from like, a random body ache or the like. Sometimes you just registered things like that hours after you carried around something at school you probably shouldn&#39;t have.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah those two love wearing shirts to show off their shoulders,&quot; Greg commented, not even noticing his own shoulders following a similar trajectory to Lee&#39;s. &quot;I mean, the shirts are tight and stretchy, but it&#39;s not like you can&#39;t see their physiques. They love showing off their muscles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate it,&quot; Lee groaned. &quot;They&#39;ll take their shirts off and bounce their pecs, show em off for the camera...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody wants to see your sweaty muscle tits, bro.&quot; Greg winced at the memory, rubbing his chest as he felt an odd ache there. Lee did likewise. Under their shirts, their pectorals as if in response to the conversation topic, bulked up in sequence - lower pec, middle pec, upper chest...all that kept the sweltering pectorals present on the two nerds from being noticed were the clothes they habitually wore. Lee however did bite his lip as he felt his nipples press against his shirt. The rubbing of the sensitive tissue there making the young man briefly bite his lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you believe how much they like flexing their biceps?&quot; Greg chuckled, though even he felt a little tingle in his own. His shirt sleeve starting to get tight. Greg awkwardly stretched as he stood there, trying to swing his arm and ease out whatever ache or pain he was experiencing. Not knowing that the experience was his biceps swelling in size.<br />
<br />
Lee&#39;s sleeve tightened around thick, meaty triceps, his biceps quickly catching up. A long, hard horseshoe of pure muscle, coupled with a big, thick bicep that quickly became rife with veins and pumped mass. &quot;They are just like...so vain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Greg. His own arms filling out and bulging with muscle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Always making the most of their shirts. Making sure to roll their sleeves up. And always, ALWAYS, making sure to take a picture from the top down, and the side.&quot; Lee chuckled, and then said, &quot;Have you seen how they&#39;ll wear those skimpy shorts whenever they wanna show off their legs?&quot; Even as Lee spoke, he grunted by the end, feeling a cramp in his legs as his quads and thighs began to swell with well honed, powerfully built muscles. Straining the jeans with a visible tension against the material.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh. You&#39;re right.&quot; Greg frowned as his legs, even in the confines of his jeans, grew larger. His quads filled out, calves getting bigger. His thighs rubbing together due to his stance as they thickened, his new body evidently a fan of both high weight deadlifts and very hefty squats. His midsection even etched itself a little tighter in response, a little broader - in response to the extensive leg workouts being edited into Greg&#39;s history.<br />
<br />
&quot;Garrett loves those shorts. I swear, they show way too much. I don&#39;t wanna see my brother&#39;s dick.&quot; Lee said as his thighs and quads swelled with muscle, pressing his own manhood against his jeans...</p>
