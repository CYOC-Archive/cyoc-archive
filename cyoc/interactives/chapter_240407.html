<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stirring in her own thoughts for what felt like ages, Jen eventually regained enough of her composure to assess her situation. Though, she didn&#39;t have much to go off of, as the only thing she could see was the underside of the underwear she had been wearing earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... happened...? Did I black out...?&quot; She thought to herself, feeling a weird soft warmth still lingering in her, though not being quite able to pin point why exactly her body felt so off. She pushed herself to move, to get her clothes off of her so she could see around, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh...? Why can&#39;t I... W-what&#39;s going on...!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly, she began to panic, as she realized she couldn&#39;t move her body. She tried calling out to anyone, but that too had no effect. She could only sit there and wait for someone to come to her rescue.<br />
<br />
Long after school had finished up, she had still been sitting there, at the bottom of a pile of her own clothes, when suddenly, her front door creaked open. This snapped Jen back into reality instantly. Hoping it was her mother, she tried everything within her power to grab her attention, even if none of her effort resulted in any action. Though, Jen had taken note of how late it must have been if her mother was back now. Had she really zoned out that badly?<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hello...?&quot; A voice Jen hadn&#39;t recognized called out. It sounded light, timid, and like it belonged to a girl her age. The person who called out stepped into the home, looking around curiously but cautiously. As she looked around, her eye snapped to the pile of Jen&#39;s clothes, and she began to rummage through them. After moving Jen&#39;s panties out of the way, she immediately recognized the unique look of the panties that had been hidden under them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my GOD!? NO WAY!&quot; She snagged Jen up from the floor and started inspecting her all over, stretching her a bit in her grasp.<br />
<br />
Once freed from the pile, Jen had been able to see the environment she was in, noting that the sun had began to set outside, bathing her living room in a warm golden glow. Her mother still wouldn&#39;t have been home by now, but that confirmed to her that she did definitely zone out hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought Kyle was joking! How is this even POSSIBLE!?&quot; She lit up with excitement and surprise, always having assumed that the stories Kyle told her about his own experience with Transform Or Dare had been nothing but fairy tales. But now, she had tangible proof stretching right between her own two hands. <br />
<br />
Jen was completely lost, unable to voice any of her questions or concern as this stranger grabbed and prodded at her, only growing more panicked as she had heard the name Kyle mentioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle...? You mean... T-transform or dare... that was all... r-real...?&quot; She thought to herself.<br />
<br />
Mentally connecting the dots, she realized this person must have been the friend Kyle mentioned over the phone. Though he had told Jen that she and her friends had bullied her in the past, Jen did not remember this person&#39;s face nor name at all. While Jen ruminated about all of this, unable to even fully comprehend what was going on, the stranger holding her, whose name was Chloe, continued to be completely utterly amazed at what she was looking at.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just can&#39;t believe that all that transform or dare stuff was real all this time! That must mean you&#39;ve got possession of it now, right? I vaguely remember Kyle mentioning something about that, like the curse gets passed on to whoever underwent the whole thing... Gosh, you&#39;re even made out of a super nice feeling fabric too! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever felt underwear this comfy before...&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to respond in any way, Jen could only sit and be at the whim of this person she didn&#39;t even know. Her expression permanently frozen on the back of the underwear she now was, capturing the moment of warm bliss she had experienced during her transformation, which left any of her internal feelings or thoughts completely impossible to read from an outsider&#39;s perspective.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehehe, your face looks so dumb frozen like that... I guess whatever conditions Kyle set don&#39;t allow you to speak...? That kinda sucks... I would have loved to hear how the oh so great Jennifer Smith would be reacting to something so humiliating... Oh well! I guess this is as good of a birthday present as I could have asked for! I don&#39;t gotta worry about you at school anymore AND I get some nice quality comfortable underwear for once!&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite how she appeared outwardly, Jen was losing it on the inside, screaming out at Chloe even knowing she couldn&#39;t hear her.<br />
<br />
&quot;U-UNDERWEAR!? I&#39;M NOT UNDERWEAR! ARE YOU DENSE!? H-HEY! PUT ME DOWN, NOW!&quot; <br />
<br />
Chloe then took Jen and folded her, before placing her in her pocket. Said pocket was pretty tight, as the clothes Chloe wore didn&#39;t exactly fit her, being hand-me-downs from others of differing sizes and cheap poorly made clothing from donations. This compressed Jen pretty tightly, leaving her thoughts a bit hazy, but still more than clearheaded enough to continue being enraged and panicked in her current state. It was strange, feeling her new thing fabric body compressed against itself painlessly. If her situation wasn&#39;t so anxiety inducing, it&#39;d even be a nice relaxing feeling.<br />
<br />
Looking at the pile of clothes Jen had left behind, an idea hit Chloe as she picked up the pile and continued deeper into the house. Eventually stumbling upon Jen&#39;s room, she began looting through her dresser, quickly grabbing any clothes that looked as though they&#39;d fit her, which was pretty difficult given the differences in Jen&#39;s and Chloe&#39;s builds.<br />
<br />
Chloe was considerably shorter than Jen, and definitely way heavier. Being considered a &quot;shortstack&quot; by many, Chloe had a vaguely pear-shaped build, which meant that a decent bit of Jen&#39;s tops would fit her relatively fine, but almost none of the bottoms she found would have even come close to fitting. <br />
<br />
Completely unaware that her clothing was being rummaged through, Jen was left feeling utterly powerless, as she was just completely disregarded and stuffed away, not even able to see or hear much of what was going on outside of the pocket she was shoved in. The pressure was leaving her feeling muted, and the warmth coming off of Chloe&#39;s leg through the pocket was only adding to the new uncomfortable foreign sensations. <br />
<br />
Once she was satisfied with her haul, Chloe cleaned up a bit of the mess she made before leaving the house with all the clothes she had taken, giddily sprinting down the street towards her house with her new wardrobe additions.</p>
