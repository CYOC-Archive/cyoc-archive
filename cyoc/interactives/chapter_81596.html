<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">From what Chris heard from the rumors this device could not only change the physical body but also the worlds perception and an individuals perception. Chris was dying to click go but didn't <br />
want his fun to be interrupted and definitely didn't want his Dad to repossess it upon coming home from work.<br />
<br />
Chris looked back over his stats and his excitement only grew as he thought about how awesome his freedom would be. But then he remembered his Dad asking him where what he wanted to do with <br />
his life and the fight they had about how he would support himself on an acting career.<br />
<br />
Wanting to fast track his dreams but not deal with his father, well, fathering him. He went into the mental settings and considered his options.<br />
<br />
Knowing his father loved him made things much more difficult. His dismissive attitude wasn't that he didn't care about what his son loved but that he cared a lot about his son's security. So <br />
giving his father a mental Illness was out of the question, but changing his fathers role in Chris' life seemed like the perfect solution.<br />
<br />
Working within his father's profile he found his way to the relationship section and found where his name was listed as Son, he deleted the entry and replaced it with Brother/Roommate. <br />
Thought again and replaced it with Awesome Brother/Permanent House-guest. He pressed enter to save the change and a warning box came up:<br />
&quot;Warning: You are changing your parentage, Do you wish to proceed? y/n&quot;<br />
<br />
Selecting yes another popup came up, &quot;Please select source(s) for your new family history!&quot; There was a box that listed his fathers name, a lot of empty space, and a check box at the bottom <br />
saying history already known. Chris selected his fathers name not quite understanding what the machine meant but knowing it would help him secure the new reality. With no more popups Chris <br />
was starring at his father's profile imagining what It would be like to have dad as a brother.<br />
<br />
Not much fun Chris suspected... when he noticed the mental age option. Then a thought occurred to him. 21 to 38 is a fairly large age difference, almost as if Chris were to get a baby <br />
brother now. The age difference would mean they would have completely different life experiences at different times. Chris wanted to stop his father from trying to control him but not push <br />
him out completely... Chris decided that rather than just having a childish much older brother, he would refund the investment his father was about to use. The 16 years of parenting his <br />
father did will disappear shortly after he gets home, but it wont be for nothing because Chris will regress him by those 16 years, back to 22.<br />
<br />
The last things he did with his father directly was go into recent history and remove him discovering and  ordering this device, he also went into the emotions and suppressed recent <br />
excitement surrounding the mail. While there he saw his fathers general stance on things like staying up late, partying, drinking and drugs along with a swath of other interests like sports, <br />
cars, exercising and the like. He modified these slightly and assumed the rejuvenation would do the rest to give him a complacent, fun loving, brother. <br />
<br />
Wanting to add the finishing touches to his masterpiece, he went back into his own mental settings and increased his confidence, self worth and self esteem, telling himself he was just <br />
compensating for what high school did to him. He gave himself a moderate interest in sports thinking it would give him a better chance of making friends and also increased his general <br />
outgoingness. Finally he secured his memories of what he had just set up so that his new life wouldn't replace his old one, like his father's new life would.<br />
<br />
The desktop program was very user friendly, it offered popup warnings and things to consider when changing x trait or y characteristic, some things pulled him into other things, some <br />
messages were not at all helpful but without realizing, hours had passed. He found a setting to make the worlds reality shift to recognize his changes as though nothing changed. through the <br />
popup he was warned that unless his current friends have another method of knowing him or age with him, he will probably loose the friends in the new reality. This didn't bother Chris at <br />
all, he doesn't have any real friends, just some people who occasionally sit next to him at lunch and let him eavesdrop on their conversation.<br />
<br />
After rechecking everything and finally proving to himself that he had thought it through, he clicked &quot;Go!&quot; The timer calculated to 18:32* and started counting down. Chris noticed that an <br />
advanced application tab opened up. Curious, Chris selected the tab.<br />
<br />

<br />
Chris was extremely eager to have the device work its magic for (and on) him but he will have to wait till dad, bro?, gets home. Thankfully Chris just heard dad's car door slam shut. <br />
<br />
Chris checked the timer, 8:12 to go. The door opened and shut, &quot;Chris! I brought pizza&quot;<br />
&quot;Be there in a minute dad!&quot; Chris was changing clothes into the stretchiest basketball shorts and baggiest shirt he could find. Then he ran downstairs, grabbed a plate, slapped two pieces of <br />
pizza and sat next to his dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;How was your day Dad?&quot; Chris started.<br />
&quot;Fine, fine son. Have you given any thought of other majors to focus on for college? Or what colleges you'd like to apply for?&quot; taking another huge bite of pizza.<br />
Chris was getting flustered but realized a new life was just a moment or two away, &quot;Not yet dad, but I was thinking about what you said, I ...&quot; <br />
<br />
Chris felt a slight warm and tingling sensation in his groin which quickly spread throughout his body. It was over just as soon as it passed. Chris looked at his dad who appeared to have <br />
been effected similarly. The machine is starting to copy dads memories and give them to me! Chris realized, as he remembered his Grandfather as a young man, back when Chris was just a <br />
toddler. Grandpa was in his late 40s when Chris was really a toddler so...<br />
<br />
With a moment of panic Chris excused himself to the bathroom saying his stomach was acting up. He couldn't understand why he didn't stay up in his room till the machine was done in the first <br />
place. Just then another wave washed over him, this one was stronger than the first and his vision momentarily blurred. Chris remembered his first time having sex at 17, sneaking back inside  <br />
late at night. Wile getting inside he was caught by his brother, they stayed up for another hour or so sneaking dad's (Grandpa's?) beer and talking outside. Chris now had more memories of <br />
being a brother to the man in the next room rather than as a son. <br />
<br />
The mental changes being almost done Chris realized the physical changes should be starting too. He reached the bathroom, turned on the light and shut and locked the door. He had set the <br />
physical timer to slow thinking it might be painful but as he looked in the mirror having noticed nothing up until then he realized the changes are painless. He saw his body slowly swelling <br />
and filling out in all the right places, so slowly. He didn't look much older only a few pounds heavier and maybe a little taller but not by much. &quot;Great,&quot; Chris thought to himself, &quot;I'm <br />
going to be stuck in here all night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then there was another surge from his groin that radiated out and the mental changes where completing, Chris' primary instinct was to think of the man in the other room as Bro, Mike, or <br />
Mikey when he wanted to be antagonizing. Looking in the mirror, watching and feeling his old life slip away he had a brief moment of panic where he realized he was loosing himself and <br />
regretted what he had done, he realized that he still remembered his original reality but to do so he had to focus really hard because his original reality was little more than a strange <br />
conspiracy theory or weird dream. The strongest thoughts &quot;Young Chris&quot; had were the ones that didn't clash with &quot;Adult Chris&quot; and he took advantage of that by reiterating that if anything <br />
goes wrong he MUST go to his room, to his computer. It didn't make sense to &quot;Adult Chris&quot; who would go to his brother in an emergency but he took note. With that, Chris' secondary, weaker <br />
and original personality faded into the background as this reality's primary personality took hold.<br />
<br />
With the other changes done the machine upstairs had all its power to focus on the physical changes, Chris got a final blast in his groin but this one wasn't warm and tingly, it was hot, <br />
surprisingly hot, and it didn't gently radiate out, it pulsated outward till his whole body felt like it was vibrating. He ripped off his clothes watching as his average in every way <br />
physique began to not be so average. The sensation was slightly uncomfortable but he barely noticed. He was getting taller and gaining weight rapidly now, his shoulders broadened pecs grew <br />
and defined themselves out of the flatness of his chest, two by two his abs peeked out and grew as the little flab he had faded into oblivion. Looking down he realized just how big a 12 inch <br />
penis is, His balls too seemed heavier and more massive. Seeing it and its potential triggered something in his brain and he was becoming erect. He noticed the arm and leg hair he had been <br />
starting to grow was now thicker, He looked in the mirror and noticed that he no longer had peach fuzz but a full 8 o'clock shadow going on. The situation mentally for Chris was very <br />
strange, a quarter of his personality was excited into overdrive where the rest of him thought nothing was strange at all except that he wasn't immediately taking care of this massive <br />
erection from nowhere.<br />
<br />
Chris felt the body vibrations subside and knew the changes were done, he looked in the mirror and seeing that the results were exactly what he hoped for and more blew his load immediately <br />
without even touching himself. It was ecstasy and brought him to his knees. It felt like 5 years of buildup just released into perfection. He cleaned up after himself and put his clothes <br />
back on. He looked in the mirror one last time at the exceptionally muscular and extremely handsome young man and said &quot;Yeah!&quot; to himself not too loud. The voice that came out seemed strange <br />
for a second and that same overwhelming excitement from &quot;Young Chris&quot; almost brought on another full fledged erection but &quot;Adult Chris&quot; said to himself, &quot;For the love of God get a grip on <br />
yourself.&quot; and managed to keep it under control for the time being.<br />
<br />
Chris opened up the bathroom door and headed back to his pizza which is probably starting to get cold now that he spent the last 5 minutes in the bathroom. <br />
&quot;Hey man grab us some beers, would ya?&quot;, came an unfamiliar voice from the other room. <br />
&quot;Sure thing Bro, you got it,&quot; Chris replied while the personality of the original Chris questioned if that could be his former dad.<br />
Chris stopped by the fridge and grabbed 4 beers knowing that they would probably polish off another 4 or 6 by the end of the night. &quot;Young Chris&quot; was getting excited again as this is new <br />
stimulus to him, drinking with his Dad, not a sip, not a beer, but several beers.<br />
<br />
As Chris came to the table and sat down to finish his meal Young Chris' fascination with Chris' brother made him stare. Young Chris saw a young man that only slightly resembled his father. <br />
The man didn't look so weathered, chubby or tired as Young Chris remembered. He just looked like a normal guy from one of those college catalogs he had been starting to receive. Mike noticed <br />
Chris staring and said &quot;What!?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nothing&quot; Chris said, &quot;You look different somehow. did you change the light bulbs or something?&quot;<br />
Mike just gave his brother a weird look and ignored him.<br />
After the two men finished the pizza and several beers each, Mike decided to watch TV, Chris went up to his room and lay on his bed thinking about things. The last few hour of the day seemed <br />
strange but Chris couldn't place how or why...</p>
