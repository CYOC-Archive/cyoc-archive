<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon was sucked into the lamp formerly occupied by the Genie and almost instantly the lamp was being rubbed. &quot;Hello Master, I am the Genie of the Lamp your wish is my... Kevin?&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing before him, slack jawed and terrified was his little brother, Kevin. He was 13 and a mix between sporty and nerdy... &quot;Hey little bro. This is so cool! You get to be my first Master! What time is it.&quot; Damon looked around to find he was in the basement of his parent&#39;s house and rather than it being late afternoon, the light seemed to indicate it was early morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damon?&quot; Kevin asked choked with emotion. A second later Kevin was sobbing in Damon&#39;s chest. Damon was initially confused but realized the cluttered basement was only cluttered because it was filled with all his stuff, boxed up and stored away...<br />
<br />
After calming Kevin down Damon&#39;s fears were confirmed, months had passed, Damon was presumed dead, there were no leads to his disappearance. Monica showed up to his funeral despite her life being turned upside down and picked through with a fine toothed comb as the last person to see him alive. The family doesn&#39;t blame her, She and Damon weren&#39;t hitting it off but that doesn&#39;t make her a murderer.<br />
<br />
With nothing but a pile of his clothes in his apartment to go off of, the case eventually led nowhere. His wallet, keys, socks, even his underwear where left in a pile in the middle of his room. It was as if he became incorporeal suddenly and in this instance, those who whispered &#39;aliens&#39; weren&#39;t laughed at due to the confounding circumstances. His family, his friends, and his ex suffered greatly not knowing if he was kidnapped, murdered, or ran away from his life depressed due to being dumped.<br />
<br />
Kevin was making all sorts of wishes trying to turn Damon back into his brother but Damon realized that the magic of the lamp would trap Kevin in his place if Damon allowed him to make a wish as foolish as the one he made. Thankfully, all the wishes Kevin had made so far were invalid due to attempting to directly undo someone else&#39;s wish. Freeing the former Genie was a side effect, becoming a genie was the wish... If that wasn&#39;t the case, Kevin would already be trapped...<br />
<br />
Damon magically sealed Kevin&#39;s mouth shut and explained that the genies aren&#39;t the magic, the bottle is. No matter what Kevin does, the bottle will have someone acting as genie by the end of the day. &quot;Here&#39;s what needs to happen... You need to make a wish. Wish for a new computer, or a Playstation, or that mom and dad are rich or something, and then... at the end, you need to wish that nobody remembers I ever existed as a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin shook his head in refusal but Damon explained that it would be best for everyone to not wonder if he was alive, what happened to him, or if he&#39;s in pain. Ultimately Kevin agreed. Damon returned Kevin&#39;s use of his mouth, &quot;So little bro, What&#39;s your first of three wishes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I am going into high school next year. It&#39;s already halfway through summer and I don&#39;t even shave yet! I wish I could grow a beard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon didn&#39;t like the wish one bit, but he could already feel it was a valid wish and magic was coursing through him... &quot;Kevin! AND THAT... Finish the wish!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And that nobody remembers you were ever a human!&quot; Kevin spat out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted!&quot; Damon exclaimed with relief, a wave of magic washed out across the world wiping Damon from everyone&#39;s memories, photos, documents and anything else he showed up in... <br />
<br />
Kevin found himself sitting at a table in the basement, before him was a game called Dwarven Dynasty which showed a dwarven adventurer. The premise of the game was to make the most luxurious and ornamented beard you can on your dwarf as it is highly coveted in dwarven society... and by pushing a button, you can make the beard grow...<br />
<br />
&quot;Genie, this isn&#39;t what I wanted when I wished I could grow a beard and you know that!&quot; Kevin didn&#39;t remember the Genie was his brother.<br />
<br />
The Genie also didn&#39;t remember his life prior to becoming a Genie, so why and how he could bungle up such a simple wish was beyond his recollection... Its not like he cared to protect this child&#39;s innocence for any reason. &quot;Just kidding master, allow me to make it up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Time reversed and it was now 7pm the prior evening, Kevin&#39;s age doubled and new knowledge flooded into his mind. He was visiting his parent&#39;s house for the weekly poker game with his friends, his apartment is too small to host and they get too loud. Plus, while playing in the garage they can all enjoy cigars and the cigarette smokers among them can enjoy their vices without needing to go outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...&quot; Kevin bellowed... &quot;I guess that&#39;s what I get for not understanding how the male body works...&quot; he chuckled. &quot;You probably could have left me at 18 or so though it is coming in stronger now that I&#39;m over 25...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can regress you if you&#39;d like or let you grow a beard like that at 13, but I do try to not turn people into freaks.&quot; genie responded,<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I decide at end of the night? I feel it would be rude not to enjoy the evening you set up for me.&quot; Kevin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since this is a correction of a blatant failure on my part to fulfill your wish, yes, just know that this isn&#39;t a normal offering.&quot; Genie smiled</p>
