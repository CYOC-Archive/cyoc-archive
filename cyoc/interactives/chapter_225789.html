<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The transformation had been complete, and Ryan now sat upon the immense stone throne, his regal form a breathtaking sight to behold. No longer the human he once was, Ryan was now sculpted into an anthropomorphic king lion forged of solid gold. The golden fur of his mane cascaded over his broad, kingly shoulders, each hair meticulously detailed to shimmer with every slight movement. His eyes, once a vibrant blue, were now polished sapphires set deep within his noble, metallic face. His muzzle was poised in a mixture of stoicism and majesty, and golden whiskers splayed finely from either side. A crown, adorned with assorted gemstones, rested with grandeur upon his head. His attire was no less resplendent: a mantle draped elegantly over his torso, alongside a shirt with seamless stitching. His legs were encased in golden boots with a darker gold alloy for the soles, and at his waist hung a sword – its hilt encrusted with rubies and emeralds. Even the belt, looped around his slim waist, was a masterful work of art.<br />
<br />
Though every inch of Ryan was now a divine display of craftsmanship, it was clear he was no mere statue. Life dwelt in his sapphire eyes; a mind still raced behind them, full of thoughts and concerns, most immediately for his friends.<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s voice, now with a metallic resonance, broke the silence that had befallen the room following the coronation ritual. &quot;Where are my friends? Johnathan, Mike, Sei, Erick... Are they safe?&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice, though unintentional, boomed like a command, and the court of statues reacted promptly. The silver fox, still in her ornate uniform, replied with a reverence that seemed to have been programmed deep into her stone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your Highness, your command shall be heeded. Your comrades will be fetched at once,&quot; she declared before turning to address those within the assemblage. &quot;Search the mansion, and bring his majesty&#39;s friends to the throne room!&quot;<br />
<br />
The court sprung to life. A wooden owl, wings carved elegantly and eyes of polished opal, took flight with a surprisingly silent glide despite its rigid form. An iron bear with creaking joints, its armor clanging with every heavy step, lumbered to the main floor. A marble wolf, sleek and white, slipped through the shadows like a ghost, its paws making no sound. Lastly, a brass serpent slithered through cracks and crevices, searching with its emerald green eyes for any hint of their whereabouts.<br />
<br />
As the statues dispersed, Ryan sat in anxious anticipation, his mind embroiled in thousands of thoughts as he waited to be reunited with his friends. Would they recognize him? Would they flee in fear? Only time would tell, but for now, the golden king remained upon his throne, a paragon of splendor and stillness, watching and waiting.<br />
<br />
A sense of unrest lingered in the vast, dimly lit throne room as echoes of armored footsteps and rustling silks filled the air. The statues, now enlivened by some otherworldly enchantment, had dispersed to seek out the whereabouts of Ryan&#39;s friends. Their hunt was swift and unyielding, an unquestioned duty to their newly coronated monarch.<br />
<br />
One by one, Ryan&#39;s friends were ushered—or rather dragged—into the grand chamber. Johnathan, the youngest, stumbled in with wide-eyed disbelief as he beheld the glistening golden figure on the throne. Mike and Sei bore expressions of mixed awe and trepidation, while Erick tried to mask his shock with a thin veneer of composure.<br />
<br />
The statues firmly guided the bewildered group to the foot of the throne, where the silver fox declared in a tone that brooked no argument, &quot;Bow before His Grace, Ryan, King of the Golden Realm!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hesitantly, the friends exchanged glances, uncertain of how to respond to such an outlandish demand. It was at that moment that the golden figure shifted, a gentle clinking of metal against stone echoed softly. The statues stiffened in anticipation of their king&#39;s words.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; came the resonant voice of Ryan. &quot;There&#39;s no need for such formalities among friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those gathered regarded the gleaming lion with confusion—then realization—as Ryan continued, &quot;It is I, your friend Ryan, but not as you remember me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The disbelief was palpable, but as Ryan spoke, each one began to recognize the warmth in his sapphire eyes; it betrayed the humanity beneath the golden guise.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to you?&quot; Mike asked, the first to find his voice amid the collective astonishment.<br />
<br />
With a sigh that felt foreign to his golden lungs, Ryan recounted the tale of his transformation—the statues, the strange and overwhelming sensation of the chocolate kiss, his metamorphosis into the golden being before them. He explained how the liquid gold had covered him, reshaping his form, the chanting that had robbed and returned his mobility, and how the mysterious magic of the mansion had crowned him king.<br />
<br />
Johnathan stepped forward, hesitant to touch but filled with a brotherly concern. &quot;Can we... can we change you back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan contemplated the question, the weight of gold and the ceremonial atmosphere binding him to uncertainty. The truth was, he didn&#39;t know. Perhaps the same forces that had reshaped his very essence could undo what had been done—or perhaps this was a royal destiny he could not escape.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Ryan admitted. &quot;But for now, let us not dwell on my circumstances. You are all here, and you’re safe—that brings me comfort.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tension in the room eased as familiarity took hold. Ryan, their friend, albeit in a vastly different form, remained among them. Curiosity overcame apprehension, and they began to inquire about the nature of his experience, the room filled with a cacophony of questions and the gleam of enchanted statues watching in silent vigil.<br />
<br />
Erick took a tentative step toward the golden visage of his friend. His gaze traveled over Ryan&#39;s majestic silhouette, a mixture of fascination and eagerness lighting his features. &quot;May I?&quot; he asked, his voice tinged with the thrill of the unknown.<br />
<br />
Ryan nodded, the movement a silent shimmer of gold. &quot;Yes, you may.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a reverence typically reserved for sacred artifacts, Erick reached out and pressed his fingers against the lion&#39;s arm. To his surprise, the hard, cool surface of gold yielded slightly under his touch, the fur texture indented by his fingertips, then slowly returning to its original form—a testament to the magic that infused the regal figure before him.<br />
<br />
Erick&#39;s astonishment grew into a gleeful grin, his eyes sparkling with the prospect of adventure. &quot;This is incredible,&quot; he said, withdrawing his hand but unable to shake his amazement. &quot;I have to admit, a part of me would love to experience being like this, if only for the thrill—and if it&#39;s reversible, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beside the throne, the statue of a regal stag had been observing the interaction with an inscrutable stillness. Upon hearing Erick&#39;s words, the Assistant brought its crystalline gaze to bear upon him. With an air of dignity, it stepped forward, the metallic tapping of hooves resonating in the stone chamber.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your desires can indeed be fulfilled,&quot; the Assistant, a wooden Jackal named Anpu, articulated with an accentuated, cultured tone. &quot;The magic of transformation is reversible, granted that the proper ceremonies are performed to ensure the safe return to one&#39;s original form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan turned his head, the golden fur flowing around his noble features, and addressed Erick with a question that felt as weighty as his metallic form. &quot;What is it that you envision for yourself, Erick? Choose wisely, for the transformation is not a trifling matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erick pondered for a moment, captivated by the thought of such an extraordinary experience—a story that would be unlike any other. His answer came as a reflection of his innermost aspiration, an aspiration that had been brought to light by the paradoxical combination of Ryan&#39;s plight and allure.</p>
