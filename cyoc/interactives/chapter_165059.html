<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff sat on the bed in the room he was locked in. His demon stomach now &#39;full&#39; of sins to expunge through a process he didn&#39;t understand. His body magically healed because supposedly he is now immortal.<br />
<br />
Jeff had just had an unexpected meeting with the Ruler of Hell, Jennifer&#39;s dad. Some fears were alleviated, some expectations were set, and some new experiences were had... probably by both of them.<br />
<br />
Jeff placed a hand on his stomach wondering how much a serving of soul would be and if it could somehow make him fat if he eats too much. Jeff collapsed backward onto the bed. His mind wandered through many topics, like would his soul be held to human or demonic morality standards when Sun destroys the Earth? If he needs souls with sins to survive how will he get them living on the mortal plane? Where does the extra mass go to/come from when he shrinks/grows and how does that whole process even work anyway? <br />
<br />
Then it happened, a sudden sensation of release. Like if he had been screaming for the last two days, without realizing it, and just now decided to stop. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Jeff grunted, he tried consciously flexing his newfound control. Like his voice, he could turn it off, or anything between a whisper and full blast, top of the lungs screaming... though there was no sound... it was just how Jeff related to the sensation.<br />
<br />
Could this be the... fuck me aura... Lucifer mentioned? Some kind of defensive, orgy inducing, chaos generator that he naturally put up because he was injured and hungry? I guess it would make sense given that he apparently could transform those he slept with. Allowing him to... do something... to his attackers if being pursued.<br />
<br />
Jeff consciously turned off the aura and quickly drifted off to sleep for a few hours. He awoke feeling fully rested and more alive than he had since this started. He felt nourished and it was mildly intoxicating. He had a sense of restoring something to its new and pristine status and it felt so good. Jeff realized how absolutely infuriating that sensation must have been for the demons under Lucifer the First, who despised humanity, specifically God&#39;s love for it.<br />
<br />
He stretched realizing his aura was on again, though at a very low hum. After turning it off a couple times Jeff realized that keeping it off seemed to require some level of mindfulness. He was akin to a content cat with a constant gentle purr.<br />
<br />
Jeff was initially bothered by this but quickly accepted that at least he CAN turn it off, and without others to test on, his aura may not even be noticeable at this level, he just doesn&#39;t know. <br />
<br />
Jeff sat up realizing for the first time it had been several days and he didn&#39;t want food or need a bathroom. &quot;This will take some getting used to.&quot; He glanced at the mirror noticing he was still a 45 year old man, &quot;This will take more getting used to!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stood before the mirror, wearing sweatpants and what used to be an oversized shirt. After having taken an undisclosed period of time examining himself, &quot;Okay body... Go back to normal!&quot; ... &quot;Be myself&quot; ... &quot;Be younger&quot; ... &quot;Please?&quot;<br />
<br />
So verbal commands didn&#39;t work, which wasn&#39;t really a surprise since he shifted without a sound in the first place. Jeff closed his eyes trying to think of what he looked like and imagine his physical features. As he opened his eyes his newly graying stubbled face greeted him.<br />
<br />
Undeterred, Jeff remembered he wasn&#39;t focusing on his appearance when he changed, so thinking about what he wants to look like probably isn&#39;t the answer, maybe once he gets a better hang of it, but not yet.<br />
<br />
Jeff was unsure of what to try so he collapsed back on the bed to think, his mind wandered to a time in the, hopefully near, future. One where he could control his appearance at a whim. He could look like an underwear model going to the grocery store, an action hero stopping for fast food, or a body builder while going for a stroll in the park. The sense of freedom he would have from being able to shed his identity in a heartbeat was thrilling. <br />
<br />
Maybe if he could talk to a real incubus, he could get tips on how this works? Jeff sat up trying to think. Maybe it would be faster to reach Jenny? Her powers aren&#39;t the same, obviously, but maybe they are activated in a similar way? Jeff sat up unsure what to do.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s reflection caught his eye, no longer graying, he was just as muscular if not a little more. Late 20s perhaps, dark hair, dense perma shadow where his beard would grow in. Handsome, but not himself, not a younger version of the original guy either as the facial structure changed, nor any of the appearances he thought he might try, and definitely not someone he knows...<br />
<br />
&quot;How does this work&quot; Jeff growled to the man in the mirror ending with a confused sigh. &quot;Ugh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff spent the next hour or so trying to keep his mind focused, trying to not fret about how his mom is probably worried sick or what it will be like being back at school with these powers. Unable to figure anything out he knocked at the door to summon the guards, &quot;Hey, is it possible to talk to Jennifer or maybe an incubus?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our orders are to isolate you, sorry human.&quot; Came the emotionless reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I can remain isolated, and talk. Like I am doing with you. I need to know how to control shapeshifting and get a grip on my other abilities, so I can go home. For that I need to practice and experiment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Practice away human, we can&#39;t leave our post for another 23 hours. After that we can pass your request up the chain.&quot; Came the response.<br />
<br />
Jeff was disappointed but the guards were just doing their jobs. He sparked conversations with them through the door finding out that in addition to not needing food, Demonkind doesn&#39;t need sleep and their total shift duration is actually 36 hours, which is progressive and was shortened from a week under the rule of Lucifer 2.<br />
<br />
Jeff tested his aura&#39;s effects through the door with the guard&#39;s permission and found that it didn&#39;t pass through, which didn&#39;t really tell him anything. The door could be warded magically, his aura may require direct line of sight, it may just not work through closed doors, or the types of demons the guards are may not be susceptible to it... <br />
<br />
Throughout the hours Jeff and the guards had a number of small conversations as questions arose. Jeff found out that incubi were rarer demons and are nearly constantly deployed to earth to cultivate sins. They encourage cheating which may lead to lies and they make people jealous, envious, and angry. Each type of demon came from a different type of angelic being, from cherubs to the Archangel Lucifer himself. This grants different groups different special abilities but all demons can use magic in addition to their natural abilities.<br />
<br />
Jeff asked what type of Angel Incubi came from but the guards couldn&#39;t recall. More than all of recorded time had passed since The Fall and memories of the divine weren&#39;t something most demons liked to dwell on even considering their pending divine pardon.<br />
<br />
Jeff had been mostly relaxing with the occasional transformation attempt and aura blast now and again. He was still a muscular, dark haired, 28ish year old man and hadnt figured anything else out. Most of the time was spent questioning the guards and trying to wrap his head around eternity and all this meant for him. Before he knew it however, the guards were saying good bye and would pass his request along as new guards arrived to take their post... Jeff was shocked to realize that he didn&#39;t sleep in over a day and wasn&#39;t feeling tired. Yet another unexpected development.</p>
