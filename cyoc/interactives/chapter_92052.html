<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anxious, Rose waited out the time on a comfortable grinding spot. She got her entire party up to level 35, which was the limit she set herself before the next gym, but she didn&#39;t feel like doing it. She just turned on TV and found an infomercial channel. She manages to get it off her mind and zone out into the repetitive videography, until she realizes she wet herself AGAIN, causing the entire diaper to feel warm and soggy. It was so incredibly uncomfortable, and she cried a little before her second wetting episode was over.<br />
<br />
40 more minutes go by, and Rose&#39;s mom finally pulls up the drive way, so she turns off the TV. Rose nervously stays sat in the loveseat; too nervous to go outside with her bulge, or even come to the door with her smell.<br />
<br />
Her mom passes through the door, walking into the middle of the living room and pulling up a footstool to sit on in front of her. She reaches out and puts a hand on Rose&#39;s knee.<br />
&quot;So, Rosie, you said you breathed in an odd smell, and your underwear turned into a diaper, and then you wet yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose nods, biting her lip.<br />
&quot;And then I peed more... it&#39;s really uncomfortable...&quot; She says, squishing her legs together and putting her hands in-between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I see it?&quot; Her mom asks politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;...mhm.&quot; Rose nods again.<br />
<br />
Her mom helps her to her feet, then goes over to the window and closes the blinds. She unbuttons Rose&#39;s pants, slides them down, and examines her almost completely full diaper. It&#39;s very, very light pink; with vibrant pink trim along the inner-edges, on the tapes, and pink hearts, starts and various shapes along the curve that turn dark purple when wet (in other words, all but the frontmost and backmost shapes were purple). Knelt down to her level, her mom feels it in the front, and gently rubs it in the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing, mom??&quot; Rose wiggles out of her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m checking to see how thick it is.&quot; She says, getting a little more feel.<br />
<br />
&quot;...that&#39;s important?&quot; Rose asks confusedly, inadvertently stepping out of her pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;The reports say that the more thick a girl&#39;s diaper is, the more heavy a soiler they&#39;re going to be.&quot; She pushes upwards against the crotch area. &quot;And seeing how you&#39;ve filled this pretty thick one up in one hour already, it looks we&#39;re gonna be getting quite a big diaper pail for you.&quot; She comments, standing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MOMMY?! I mean mean I mean, MOM??&quot; Rose shakily holds her wrist.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not 100% sure about it yet.&quot; Her mom explains, guiding her into her bedroom. She opens her top dresser drawer, where her panties were located.<br />
<br />
Rose looked over and saw that her drawer was now nothing but diapers. Her socks were unchanged, but her panties had all become mostly like the diaper she was wearing now. Some were blue-ish green, some were cyan, but most were pink or magenta. She had a small package of pads in the drawer (having had her third period last week) that had now turned into large, thick booster pads.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom... what&#39;s going on???&quot; She starts to tear up.<br />
<br />
Her mom kneels back down and looks at her, holding her hand.<br />
&quot;Rose, a large, cloud of smog has been passing through the entire world, and it has been making girls incontinent.&quot; She points to her diaper. &quot;Incontinent, means that you can&#39;t control when you pee, or control when you poop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W... d...&quot; Rose looks sullenly into her mom&#39;s eyes, and down at her diaper.<br />
&quot;You mean I&#39;m going to have to keep wearing diapers...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. But you don&#39;t have to feel bad; it&#39;s happening to every girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose looks down at her mom&#39;s legs, between her businesswoman&#39;s skirt and sees normal blue panties.<br />
&quot;...but only girls my age?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes; any girls 12 years old or younger.&quot; Her mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t I just wear regular underwear, and go to the bathroom really quickly whenever I need to go?&quot; Rose tried to rationalize.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait just one moment, sweetie.&quot; She guides her into her own bedroom, and dives into her old boxes, until she finds some old clothes that she had when she was 14. She takes a pair of panties, and sits them on the bed. She reaches over and starts untaping Rose&#39;s diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom what are you doing...!&quot; Rose stood frighteningly still.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweetie, I hope you&#39;re okay with me seeing you naked, okay? Because you&#39;re going to have to get used to it.&quot;  She explains, taking her diaper off.<br />
<br />
She brought the panties over to Rose&#39;s ankles, then slid them up. They both looked at the panties, and within a few seconds, they had transformed into a diaper. They were green-and-blue flower-power patterned--like the panties they were originally.<br />
<br />
Rose screamed for a fraction of a second and immediately covered her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;See sweetie? Any panties you wear will turn into a diaper. Just like the ones in your dresser.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no.... why? Mom why do you know about this? How long have you?&quot; Rose asked, getting a little hysterical.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since it first got reported on the news, Friday afternoon.&quot; Her mom sighed, getting up, collecting and balling up her soggy diaper and heading to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two days ago?? Why didn&#39;t you tell me?!&quot; She said, gently pushing against her mom&#39;s midsection.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t want to make you afraid about it, since there was nothing that could be done about it.&quot; She explains, throwing it in the trash. &quot;I was going to tell you when I got home from work, because the forecast said it would hit the city tomorrow at around noon, but there was unexpected wind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re SURE every girl in the city is wearing diapers just like I am?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there may be some who are wearing masks.&quot; She answers, getting down into the cabinet and pulling out four rolls of toilet paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, so we COULD have avoided this??&quot; Rose gets a little indignant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rosie, would you have preferred to be wearing a big, sweaty gas mask on your head whenever you go out, and having to go to sleep in a little room without a window and a sealed door, with a set amount of purified air?&quot; She took Rose over to her bedroom again. &quot;According the news, even rich families who spent tens of thousands of dollars isolating their daughters from the smog eventually slipped up a little and failed anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...okay... sorry for getting mad at you.&quot; Rose said timidly, only to then realize that her stomach felt funny, and that she was messing herself. She tensed up and got shaky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; She said, putting the toilet paper on her bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;M...........&quot; Rose bit down on her lip as tears started pouring down her cheeks.<br />
<br />
One look at her, and her mom knew what she was doing. She quickly reached over and held onto her hand, while rubbing her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom...mom...&quot; Rose stuttered, about to break down.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, sweetie. It&#39;s okay.&quot; She whispered to her. &quot;You don&#39;t have to worry about anything; I&#39;ll take care of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.....whhhhat do you mean?&quot; She said as, to her horror and shame, she had a second movement to release.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about anything, okay sweetheart?&quot; She whispered. &quot;Mommy will take care of everything once you&#39;re finished. All you have to do is finish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not knowing how else to react, Rose nodded.<br />
<br />
Once her mom felt Rose relax in her hands, she looked down and saw that she had wet a little bit too. She guided her over to her bed and laid her down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom... are you going to change my diaper?&quot; Rose asked, nervously bending her legs in and out.<br />
<br />
She nods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um mom... I can do it. Okay?&quot; She tries to cover the diaper up with her hands.</p>
