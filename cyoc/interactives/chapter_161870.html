<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katherine winced as the energy jolted through her, dreading whatever change Alan had programmed. She had to get the controller away from him! His erection was blatantly obvious, so chances were he intended to rape her before long. The thought of Alan using her body for his pleasure made Kathy&#39;s muscles tense and her pulse race. <br />
<br />
Alan adjusted the chronivac emitter, keeping it pointed at her and glancing between its dial and her body. <br />
<br />
Kathy made a quick calculation and decided her panties were a liability. If she needed to run or kick they&#39;d just trip her up, and revealing her teenage pubes to Alan might be enough of a distraction to get the controller away from him. Kathy eased her legs apart, letting the oversized underwear slide down to her ankles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why Doctor, you seem to have lost something there.&quot; Alan smiled widely and gestured with the chronivac. &quot;Why not turn around so I can see the rest of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathy bit her lip. She wouldn&#39;t be able to jump him if she faced away. Her pulse was beating a mile a minute and she was starting to feel  sweat beading on her skin. She couldn&#39;t seem to catch her breath either, had Alan given her asthma or something?<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure you want that? I&#39;ve got more you haven&#39;t seen right here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kathy cupped her breasts, keeping them covered with her hands. They felt hot, or her hands felt cold, she wasn&#39;t sure which. Sweat was starting to run all over her body, distracting her. A remote corner of her scientist&#39;s mind noted she might be having a panic attack. She felt tingling in her lips, nipples, hands and feet. Kathy swayed slightly, her vision dimming for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything all right there Kath? You&#39;re looking a bit flushed.&quot; Alan almost sounded concerned, but his smirk gave lie to that.<br />
<br />
Kathy scowled, getting a grip on herself to focus her anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alan. Give me the chronivac. I have no interest in using it on you, but I also don&#39;t trust you to undo what you&#39;ve done to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kathy stepped out of her panties and away from her other clothes. Her stockings were starting to sag, and her feet were slick on the cold floor tiles. Just four feet between them now. She might be able to kick the emitter out of his hand, but the risk of it getting damaged and her getting stuck like this stopped Kathy from acting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop right there, if you please, I don&#39;t want you trying to wrestle this away from me. You wouldn&#39;t want it to wind up broken would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathy flipped her hair back to get it out of her eyes. She rubbed her breasts to give Alan something to focus on, and noted her nipples had tensed up. She licked her lips, tasting salty sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that last change anyway, Alan? I expected you to give me bigger boobs or a bubble butt, given your recent behavior.&quot; <br />
<br />
She teased him, playing with her breasts without revealing anything more. The more distracted he was the better a chance she had of getting out of this situation. The tingling she felt was becoming throbbing, not just in her extremities, but in her head and belly. Kathy was startled by a whiff of scent and realized not all the liquid running down her thighs was sweat. She reached certainty what he&#39;d done before Alan answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Kathy, I made some adjustments to your hormone levels.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You put me into heat, you son of a bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathy lunged, grabbing Alan&#39;s wrist and forcing the emitter to point away from her. Her body slammed into Alan&#39;s, forcing him back a couple steps, but she couldn&#39;t get traction in her stockings to capitalize on that. Alan wasn&#39;t even trying to fight her, wrapping his free arm around her and squeezing her butt cheek as he pulled her pelvis tight against his erection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me the--&quot; Kathy struggled but couldn&#39;t reach the emitter. Alan had raised it over his head and her efforts had her rubbing and writhing against his chest. Alan was keeping it just out of her reach, and clearly enjoying feeling her pressed against him. Kathy slumped unable to catch her breath after her burst of activity. Worse, she realized she was reacting at least as strongly to the stimulation of their bodies rubbing as he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor, I note that while I&#39;ve been squeezing your behind, you&#39;ve neither objected, nor tried to stop me. Could it be you&#39;re enjoying this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Son of a bitch.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kathy felt herself trembling, clutching at Alan&#39;s clothes to keep from collapsing. Her body felt like it was on fire, the room was spinning, and just the smell of Alan, his male sweat and aftershave was making her want to nuzzle and nibble him. His hand on her ass was a warm pulse making her loins ache.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still rape, even if you make me, beg you for sex.&quot; Kathy panted, her forehead pressed against Alan&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think a good lawyer could get the charges dismissed, but Kathy, you aren&#39;t going to make any accusations against me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathy looked up in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;The hell I won&#39;t!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alan leaned down and kissed her. Kathy felt her lips open to welcome his tongue into her mouth. God did she need to get laid! The jolt from the chronivac shocked her so much she broke the kiss, startled to find her arms draped around Alan&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me now?  You won, you know that right? You didn&#39;t need to zap me again, I already gave in.&quot; Kathy felt tingles flowing across her skin as the changes began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Kathy, breaking your resistance is just the beginning.&quot; Alan said softly before kissing her again.</p>
