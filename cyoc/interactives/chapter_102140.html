<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">**Obviously borrowed a few points from the “My Dinner Twists” installment (chapter 232) from Earth-1 since this introduces Kenya to Nate’s family. And on a side note, at my family gatherings all the old men convene to the TV room and sit there like they&#39;re being hypnotized or something - bj88<br />
<br />
A few blocks down the street the Andersons and Twists were just returning from the football game. Ben ducked into his house to drop off his equipment and dirty laundry before rejoining the others. <br />
<br />
“That was fun.” Eric said. He hadn’t expected to enjoy himself as much as he did. He didn’t know much about football, or sports in general (baseball being the exception). Of course, this hadn’t been the typical football game. <br />
<br />
Halfway through the game, the two coaches started yelling at each other over a foul. The werewolf who was coaching Ben’s team, also a pack member by the name of Collin, exploded into his fursona. Thankfully, everyone there already knew about weres. But as a punishment, he had to go the rest of the game with just a pair of shorts on. The poor guy looked like he was going to freeze to death. <br />
<br />
“Glad you enjoyed yourself. You ever think about going out for any sports Eric?” Ben asked. Nate played on the school’s soccer team, but that season had since passed. And while, at the time, Eric hadn’t been interested, Ben suspected the younger Anderson might have had a change of mind. <br />
<br />
“Well, maybe baseball. But I don’t know if I’m any good.”<br />
<br />
“Oh no, here he goes.” Francis whispered to Samantha. They both knew Ben’s real passion was the aforementioned baseball. And once you got him started on that, there was no stopping him. <br />
<br />
Ben and Eric dove into a passionate discussion about the high school team, and other game related subjects. Meanwhile, as the adults brought the food out of the kitchen and into the dining room, Nate texted Kenya to see if she was one her way. <br />
<br />
“PULLING UP NOW.” was the response Nate got. Butterflies in his chest, stomach, and any other internal organs, he rushed to the door. Sure enough, Kenya was there on her moped. She was riding the bike in a dress. A dress. <br />
<br />
He’d advised her to keep things “business casual”. So Kenya showed up wearing a fitted navy blue cocktail dress. Her hair was parted to one side, and a small black purse tucked under her arm. Nate’s heart pumped in his chest, and he did his best to hide the erection in his pants. <br />
<br />
“You look amazing!” Nate leaned in, and up, to kiss her. <br />
<br />
“And you as well.” Kenya smiled as she ran her eyes over Nate. He was wearing a pair of khaki pants and a maroon polo shirt. <br />
<br />
“He cleans up nicely,” she thought, taking his hand in hers. The couple walked arm in arm to the front door, where Nate paused to take a breath before entering. Kenya squeezed his hand to reassure him. Nate opened the door, his confidence renewed. <br />
<br />
“Mom, Dad, Kenya’s here.” he said, his voice only shaking a bit. <br />
<br />
Martha and William went into the living room and were very surprised to see a elegant young woman standing beside their son. They knew that Nate wouldn’t be showing up with some high school girl. But Kenya was the exact opposite of what they had had in mind. <br />
<br />
“Mr. and Mrs. Anderson, my name is Kenya Adaeze. It’s a pleasure to meet you both.” the exotic beauty beside Nate extended a hand to each of them. A bit stunned, Martha and William both shook Kenya’s hand. They gave brief introductions, and then the four moved to the couch to sit and talk. <br />
<br />
The Twists and Eric had gone into the kitchen to give them some privacy. But each very slyly took peeks around the corner to see Kenya. And needless to say, they were just as impressed and surprised by the girl, more like woman, Nate brought home. <br />
<br />
“Wow.” Eric said, staring at the mocha skinned woman sitting on his couch, holding his brother’s hand. <br />
<br />
“It’s not polite to stare Eric.” Ben said, pulling Eric back into the kitchen. But mostly so he could look at her. While Ben felt no attraction to women, he had to admit Kenya was breathtaking. And both Twist women found themselves a bit jealous of Nate. There was no doubt, Kenya was the kind of were they’d love to share intimate experiences with. <br />
<br />
“I hope I’m not intruding on a family affair.” Kenya said. <br />
<br />
“Of course not. We’re happy to have you. And, to tell the truth, have been very eager to meet Nate’s mystery love.” Martha said. Nate blushed, trying to hide his face from his mom. <br />
<br />
“Oh, before I forget, these are for you. Nate said you wouldn’t be needing any additional food, but I still felt like I shouldn’t show up empty handed. He did mention you had a flower garden behind your house, so…” Kenya dug around in her purse until she came up with a bag of seeds with a piece of folded paper inside. <br />
<br />
“Those are Asian bleeding heart seeds. They usually bloom in the spring, so if you were to plant them now they might start showing signs of life by March or April. My aunt works at the Seattle Chinese Garden. She left instructions on how to properly care for them, as well as her contact information in case you have further questions.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you.” Martha took the bag, and examined the long podded seeds, with odd white caps to them. <br />
<br />
“I’m sure you two have a lot of questions regarding my dating your son.” Kenya said. <br />
<br />
“We do, but that discussion can wait until later. Right now all the should be on our minds is enjoying the evening. Come, you still have to meet our neighbors, and Nate’s brother, Eric.” William said. Kenya nodded, and stood. The others came out of the kitchen single file. <br />
<br />
“These are the Twists. Francis, Samantha, and their son Ben.” William indicated each. Ben smiled and waved, while Francis and Samantha shook Kenya’s hand.<br />
<br />
“If you don’t mind my saying, but you look awfully familiar. Have we met before?” Francis asked.<br />
<br />
“Not directly. But I was in the audience when you gave that lecture on psychology at the college few years ago.” Kenya said. Francis nodded, but made a mental note that the lecture she gave had been over five years ago. Which made her wonder, exactly how old was Kenya?<br />
<br />
“And this is Eric.” <br />
<br />
Eric slowly walked forward as his father pointed him out. He was a little intimidated by Kenya’s size, and her almost radiating beauty. It was a lot to take in. <br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you Eric.” Kenya said smiling at Nate’s brother. Nate nudged Eric when he realized his brother was staring absently at her. Flummoxed, Eric blurted out something along the lines of “Meet to nice Eric you.”<br />
<br />
That alleviated much of the tension in the room, everyone laughing at Eric’s response. The only one who wasn’t laughing was obviously Eric, who had turned a brilliant shade of red.</p>
