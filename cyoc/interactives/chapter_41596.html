<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ian had barely begun to walk when a car pulled up next to him. The passenger window rolled down and a lady in her twenties said &quot;Hello there. Do you need any help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks&quot; Ian said. &quot;I'll just walk to the gas station and get some gas for my car. I need a little exercise anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The next available gas station isn't for another five miles&quot; a guy wo was also in his twenties said stepping out of the car and opening the trunk. &quot;We'll give you a ride to the gas station and back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The sign said that the next gas station was only a mile away&quot; Ian said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Afraid that gas station closed three months ago&quot; the guy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's just great&quot; Ian said exasperated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it that you've had a bit of a rough time&quot; the guy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I have&quot; Ian said putting his gas can in the trunk next to a booster seat. He figured that since they were being kind he might as well accept their offer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it looks like your luck is turning around&quot; the guy said. &quot;My name is Bill by the way&quot; he said sticking out his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mine's Ian&quot; Ian said shaking Bill's hand.<br />
<br />
Bill closed the trunk and opened the rear passenger door. &quot;We're headed to a wedding and we need to keep our clothes on this side since our daughter likes to pull on things&quot; he said moving the clothes aside so Ian could get in.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem&quot; Ian said smiling. &quot;How old is your daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's four years old&quot; Bill said smiling himself. &quot;She's a handful but we're glad to have her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a miracle that we did&quot; the lady said. &quot;The doctors had said that I'd never have children after a gymnastics accident when I was twelve. Do you have any children?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid not&quot; Ian said as he slid into the seat. &quot;I've never found the right woman to have children with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I hope that you'll find a nice lady&quot; the lady said. &quot;I'm going to take a guess and say that my husband didn't tell you my name. It's Jill and our daughter's name is Melannie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you&quot; Ian said. &quot;My name is Ian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi&quot; Melannie said waving at Ian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello there&quot; Ian said smiling. It was a sad smile though since he knew that he was starting to get too old to be fathering children. He would have to meet the right woman soon or he wouldn't be fathering any children.<br />
<br />
Bill got back in and started driving. They chatted and Ian found out that Melannie was going to be a flower girl. Ian thought that she would be an adorable flower girl with her short curly blond hair. At an intersection Bill had to slam on the brakes to avoid being hit by a car running the stop sign. The clothes that were hanging on the hook came off and fell across the back of the passenger seat. The medallion Ian was wearing swung forward and touched Melannie's dress. Ian felt a little shock which he attributed to the sudden stop.<br />
<br />
Ian picked up the clothes and hung them back up though he noticed that he had to reach a little further then he should have had to. Bill pulled off to the side so he could check to make sure Melannie was alright. As Bill checked on Melannie he commented &quot;You look shorter Ian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be our nerves from the near accident&quot; Ian said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill's right&quot; Jill said turning around. &quot;You do look shorter. Also your clothes look like they're loose on you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ian's clothes did feel loose but he didn't pay it any mind. &quot;We just had a pretty big scare&quot; he said. &quot;Our perceptions are bound to be a little off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well take a look at yourself in my mirror&quot; Jill said digging out a compact mirror from her purse. &quot;I don't think a near accident could cause what I'm seeing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Opening the mirror Ian couldn't see anything at first. But then he noticed that his eyes were changing color. They were going from their usual green to blue. Then he noticed that his black hair was changing from the root up. His hair was becoming blond. At the same time he noticed that his face didn't look like his face anymore but it was vaguely familiar. As Melannie started to giggle it came to him. His face was looking more like Melannie's.<br />
<br />
He was too intrigued by the changes that he was seeing on his face and head that he didn't notice that he was shrinking. By the time his eyes, face, and hair had finished changing to look like an exact copy of Melannie he had finished shrinking. &quot;Bill, what happened?&quot; Jill asked a little note of fear in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; Bill said. &quot;Are you still you Ian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I am&quot; Ian said then stopped. He had just heard Melannie's voice coming out of his mouth with a cynical tone no four year old should have. &quot;What just happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you seem to still have your mind if not your body&quot; Bill said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ian asked a note of fear in his own voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you now look like Melannie's twin&quot; Bill said. &quot;I'm going to go out on a limb and say that you look like her identical twin sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ian looked down at his clothes that were really baggy on him now. He reached a hand down to his crotch and instead of feeling a familiar penis he felt flat skin. Evidently they saw the fear in his eyes as Jill asked &quot;What are we going to do? Some how Ian is Melannie's identical twin sister now in body. His mind is still his adult male mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what to do&quot; Bill said. &quot;No one will think that he's an adult now. He can't drive his car and he can't wear his clothes. I think we should dress him in some of Melannie's clothes and then go from there.&quot;</p>
