<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lydia let her mind wonder in a daze of fantastic imagination.  Admittedly, her sexual history was short but her mind was quick.  Her whole childhood of dreams swam through her head.  She remembered the first time she had seen a mermaid transformation.  It had been in a movie she had seen when she was quite young.  It had struck something deep in her mind.  Something that had been buried by accumulated maturity.  Now Lydia had not only experienced mermaidism and magic her childish imagination returned as well.<br />
<br />
It was childish abandon but tinged with her new womanly desires.  Lydia hugged her naked body with bare arms.  Her fingers stroked her skin and she found herself missing the soft feel of spandex material.  Skin was nice but there was something about her altered form that she wanted now.  She loved the way her body felt when she was all spandex.  She wondered if her boyfriend, Yu, would like being re-made into a spandex being.  He had seemed amazingly taken by her transformation.  She had noticed how Yu wanted to touch her body when she was like that.  It was a touch that used to reserve for when the two had swam together.  Playing at sex in the pool long before they were willing to stop playing.  Lydia wanted to feel that same touch from Yu's perspective.<br />
<br />
She imagined Yu being turned into a thing she could play with.  The wild animated shows of her youth washed past her eyes.  Evil, magic-wielding women would play with the children.  Turning them into toys or puppets the woman would have their fun and the kids would make the best of the situation.  Trying to live with their helplessness.  Eventually they would find they could live with the magic or the woman would undo what she had done.  Everything always went back to normal.  But the experience would remain.<br />
<br />
Lydia felt like that woman now.  Her toy, was upstairs and his reality was in her hands.  Change him, mold him, play with him, but always put him back nicely.  Yu would feel the helplessness like Lydia had felt it.  He would have the limited control that Lydia had also.  He should find it thrilling and sexy but inconvenient.  The image of the new-Yu became more real in her mind.  Fabric stretched about his body.  His body reshaped to be more exciting to her.  His awkward but exciting discomfort was felt.  And the triggers were decided upon.<br />
<br />
The speed of Lydia's thoughts compressed what seemed like minutes into heart-beats.  More emotional than reasoned Lydia found herself forming a string of sentences that she spoke to the genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Genie, I have a fantasy I wish to live out.  I want my boyfriend to experience what it is like to be a temporary sex-toy.  I wish he would turn into a humaniform creature to pleasure women.&quot;  Lydia did not feel that she had said exactly what she had intended.  She feared that the genie would do something horrible because she could not express what she wanted concisely.<br />
<br />
But the genie was there in her thoughts seeing what she wanted and finding all the hidden feelings that went into the wish.  Lydia could almost feel the genie puzzling it all out.  Then a thought was forced into her mind.  &quot;What you ask is not really a mythical creature.  Is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Lydia admitted feeling a sinking feeling in her mind.  &quot;I guess I will have to find something else.&quot;  Lydia thought back at the magic man.  Time was doing that bit where the seconds dragged on.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!  I can work with this.  Have you ever heard of a golem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like a man made of clay that comes to life.  It's a monster but we can do without that.  And rephrase that to be a man-of-fabric instead.  Have you ever heard of zentai?  It's Japanese.  I can do cross-cultural myths, too.  Full-body transformation, semi-autonomous actions, bound to certain triggers, permanent temporary ... Done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Time skipped forward and back in a blink.  Lydia was unable to remember completely everything that had just happened.  The internal conversation was compressed to a point of memory that could never be fully unlocked.  She did not know about it anymore than she would know that Yu had a similar one in his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Done,&quot; said the genie snapping Lydia back to reality.  There was a puff of blue smoke and he was gone.  Lydia was certain the lamp had also disappeared into the time-space reality.  But she still took a look around for it.<br />
<br />
As her mind reviewed the past few minutes she started to worry.  Had she just done that?  She did not think it was in her character to want something like that.  A male, fabric-coated golem that thought almost completely on making love to its controller so that it could change back to normal.  Why did want that?  Would he like it also?  Would he understand?  Lydia quivered with anticipation.  Or fear.  Or maybe it was the coolness of the basement.<br />
<br />
Yu was on the steps with her sweatshirt.  &quot;Lydia, are you looking for this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I don't know why I thought it was down here.&quot;  She took the offered clothing and pulled the crumpled item over her body.  She stuffed her swimsuit into the pouch.  &quot;The lamp has disappeared,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It has done that before,&quot; he said.  &quot;I wanted to try to get some answer from it.  But I guess we will have to be content with what we know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  I willing to live with it.&quot;  Lydia smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's manageable if we are careful,&quot; Yu said.<br />
<br />
Later he drove Lydia home.  In the car they talked about the upcoming end of school and the summer that pushed university far into the future.  Lydia kept her wish to herself the whole way home.  Tomorrow would be a better time to spring a surprise on Yu.<br />
<br />
She only hoped that after the first time he would still want to be with her.</p>
