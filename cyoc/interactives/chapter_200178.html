<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Evan now watched anxiously as Morgan Carlson was now brought out of cryo sleep. Normal scientists monitoring the werewolf sorceress&#39;s vitals during reanimation.<br />
<br />
Calling Morgan his aunt was a bit of a misnomer for Evan. The adopted daughter of Kellie and Katie Carlson, Morgan was actually Evans cousin. Morgan though was closer in age to Evans own mother, actually being a month older than Lynne Turner. Lynne and Morgan had essentially grown up together, acting as polar opposite sisters.<br />
<br />
Evan had always been close with Morgan. Where Lynne was confident, bordering on cocky, boisterous, and extroverted Morgan was the opposite. A quiet, sweet natured woman with a subtle confidence and even temperament. Evan had grown up always admiring her. Lynne so often boosted of her power where Morgan did not. She had confidence in her abilities without flaunting them. It was a trait Evan wish he could emulate yet he was too much his mothers son. &quot;Is it finished?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; the Normal scientist stated. Without another word Evan now entered the lab, watching as Morgan began to stir. Taking the sorceress&#39;s hand, he now squeezed it tightly as she slowly opened her eyes. &quot;Aunt Morgan can you hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan groaned, her eyes slowly focusing. &quot;Evan,&quot; she asked, her voice groggy. &quot;Evan is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah its me,&quot; he smiled. &quot;You&#39;ve been asleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where am I,&quot; she asked groggily. &quot;The last thing I remember was me and my mother in the Lycan homeland.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan sighed, a frown cracking on his face. Morgan and her mother Kellie had gone to defend the Lycans shortly before his fall into darkness. At the time no one was aware of the Normals involvement in that event. All anyone knew was that the werewolves were destroyed and that Kellie and Morgan were lost and presumed dead.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was a long time ago Morgan,&quot; Evan said softly. &quot;Alot of things have changed since then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan care to introduce me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan and Morgan now turned, watching as the Boss now made his way towards them. Morgan paused, her eyes focusing on the beige and green robes. &quot;I, I know you,&quot; she stammered. &quot;You...you were there! I saw you! You, you killed my mother!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guilty,&quot; the Boss shrugged. <br />
<br />
Morgans eyes now seemed to glow with anger, her canines slowly lengthening into fangs as a guttural growl emanated from the werewolf sorceress. &quot;I remember now,&quot; she growled, her voice low and animalistic. &quot;You attacked the Lycans castle. Slaughtered them! I saw you kill my mom and then....and then..&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan trailed off, the horror of the Lycan slaughter rushing to the forefront of her mind. A single tear now rolled down her cheek as she remembered this robed man killing her mother Kellie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m guessing you hate me for that,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;You want to kill me don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I most certainly do,&quot; she grumbled, the blond sorceress&#39;s muscles growing, tensing under her robes. The Bosses red eyes seemed to narrow now. Evan sensing an impish smirk growing under his hood. The Boss now stood before Morgan, slowly opening his robe to expose his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; he said. &quot;Go ahead. Kill me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan snarled, her nails lengthening as she looked to tear out the Bosses heart. Evan now watched as Morgan seemed to freeze, the sorceress straining against herself. She couldn&#39;t come within six inches of the Boss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bioorganic inhibitors,&quot; the Boss stated happily. &quot;We implanted them into you when we put you on ice. We knew magic wouldn&#39;t have much effect on Morgan Lefay 2.0 so we had to go another route. Marvelous invention I must say. Completely integrated into your nervous system and prevents you from harming the leader of the Normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan snarled, beads of sweat forming on her brow. No matter how much she tried she couldn&#39;t attack her mothers killer. Crying out in frustration she now dropped her arm, her breathing ragged as she glared at the Boss.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve made your point,&quot; Evan stated bitterly.<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;But you both needed to know that you can&#39;t touch me. You know, just in case you started feeling all squirrelly again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan was stone faced, keeping his temper in check as the Boss seemed to gloat. The Boss obviously knew Evan would try to move against him if Morgan was ever released from her icy tomb. Evan had considered it but had put those plans on hold. At least until they had dealt with the Catalyst. &quot;I&#39;ve already proven my loyalty to the Normal,&quot; Evan hissed. &quot;I don&#39;t see why any of this is necessary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I say,&quot; the Boss shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m cautious. Speaking of necessary though there&#39;s a reason I thawed you out Morgan. I need your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I help the man who killed my mother and slaughtered my honorary family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t say I was giving you a choice Ms. Carlson,&quot; the Boss replied. Morgan and Evan now watched as the Boss took a step back, his eyes focusing on Morgan as he began to speak slowly..<br />
<br />
&quot;Autumn. Photograph. Mortuary.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan grunted, wincing at the words being spoken. &quot;What are you doing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pink. Dreary. Automobile. Needle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it,&quot; Morgan yelled, her hands now grasping her head in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Family. Blackboard. Ocean. Mountain. Floorboard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan let out one last scream before her body seemed to relax. Evan gazed at her curiously, puzzled by why she suddenly seemed so relax. The sorceress now turned her gaze upwards, her eyes glassy as she stared at the Boss. &quot;Orders sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do,&quot; Evan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mental conditioning,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;In layman&#39;s terms I brainwashed her. Took years to perfect. During her years on ice I&#39;ve been fiddling around with her mind. All I have to do is say those words and POOF she obeys my every order. Can&#39;t have Morgan here running around with free will. Here just watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan now saw the Boss slowly step towards Morgan, leaning in as he gave her a command. &quot;Morgan,&quot; he stated. &quot;Hit Evan with a magical blast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evans eyes went wide. Turning he saw Morgan now stare at him with dead eyes before unleashing a powerful blast of magic at him. Evan grunted, barely erecting a defense as his aunts magic sent him soaring across the room. Crashing to the floor he found himself seething as he looked between the Boss and Morgan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch,&quot; the Boss winced. &quot;That looked like it hurt. Plus side for you Evan is that once her mission is complete, she deactivates. Part of the programming. She completes her mission and returns to base, meaning she&#39;ll be back to her normal self in a few minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucky for me,&quot; Evan grumbled, rubbing his ribs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont look so glum Evan,&quot; the Boss replied happily. &quot;You get to reunite with your favorite aunt.&quot; Evan said nothing, slowly standing as he now gazed at Morgans expressionless face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll give you two a chance to catch up,&quot; the Boss stated as he began to exit the room. &quot;I&#39;m expecting great things from the two of you in the future.&quot;</p>
