<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jennifer was asleep, she continued to change, just not in the way you might think. Jen&#39;s innards started to change, and over time, Jennifer started to lay eggs. During her sleep she layed around 3 eggs, but was completely unaware of what was actually happening.<br />
<br />
As morning came around, Jen began to awake and as she gained proper consciousness she felt a weird bump beneath her. Jennifer looked down to see 3 eggs, little bigger than a normal chicken, but still eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this...&quot; Jennifer said as she looked down towards the eggs. &quot;This cant be real... can it?&quot; Jennifer looked around the room. She didn&#39;t want to make a scene and wake everyone up, so she grabbed the eggs and headed for the chicken coop.<br />
<br />
Jen was running towards the chicken coop, it was so close. Jennifer was within 50 meters of the chicken coop before she stopped in place. &quot;Whats going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer was about to lay more eggs, she had no control over her motor muscles so she was stuck in the middle of a field laying eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, don&#39;t make me do this... I beg you!&quot; Jen pleaded. It was no use. She sat down and started to push out of her vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.... It hurts so much...&quot; Jen moaned. She sat there in the grass, Jennifer could feel it being pushed down to her vagina. Eventually, she managed to push it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank god...&quot; Jen said. Something was wrong, she still couldn&#39;t move, she was stuck sitting on the ground still. That was when it hit her, she was going to lay more eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I cant.... No more!&quot; Jen pleaded. Again, it was no use, Jen eventually layed another egg on the grass. Once she was done laying the second one she had regained her motor control&#39;s. She reached down and picked up the 2 new eggs and continued to run towards the chicken coop.<br />
<br />
Jennifer made it into the chicken coop and placed the eggs under different sleeping chickens so it wouldn&#39;t seem suspicious when the farmer came around. Going the the chicken coop was a mistake however, as her transformation only continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; Jen said as she again sat down and lost all motor control. &quot;No... Please no!&quot; It was to late, Jen was laying even more eggs. It felt like there was a whole bunch all stacked up trying to get out all at the same time. As Jen was laying eggs, she continued her transformation. Her legs started to harden and shrink, it looked like the turned into toothpicks with 3 little pegs at the bottom.<br />
<br />
Her legs weren&#39;t the worst of her issues, Jen was now starting to gain weight and shrink down to the size of an actual chicken.  Jen could only sit and wait as her whole body continued to transform into a chicken. Jen was now only a foot tall and had the legs of a chicken, with what looked like a belly of someone who was at least 500 pounds.<br />
<br />
Next would be feathers, they all started out small but grew, they where all over the place, on her head and on her ass. Next would come her arms, they started by bending in the complete wrong way, she now had the arms of a chicken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh... Thank god thats over!&quot; Jen said, unaware that she was now completely a chicken.<br />
<br />
Jen then stood back up, and took a look around, everything seemed bigger. A lot bigger. Jen then looked down, she could no longer actually see her feet, all that could be seen was a sea of white chicken feathers!<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap, what am I going to do now?&quot; Jen said. Just as she said that she could hear the door from the house open and close, it was her dad. She couldn&#39;t be seen like this, so she ran up the ramp that was built for the chickens and sat down in it and pretended to be asleep.<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s dad eventually made it over to the chicken coop to take a look and see how the sleeping chickens where doing. He gave each chicken a look over, once he got to Jen, he gave it an extra long look. He eventually looked away and continued on with what he was doing.<br />
<br />
Then the feeling hit her, Jen was about to lay another egg. It couldn&#39;t happen now, it was again to late and she was again unable to move any of her muscles. Jens dad left just as Jen started to lay the eggs, leaving Jen in the painful mess that she was.<br />
<br />
Jen finished laying around 6 eggs in one go and was now sitting on top of them. It was time to leave, but she couldn&#39;t. She no longer had to lay eggs, but she couldn&#39;t move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats going on? Why can&#39;t I move?&quot; Jen questioned. It seemed as if Jen had been inflated to the point where she was no longer able to move, stuck sitting in that one spot. &quot;Well this is just great, stuck as a chicken in this dumb chicken coop!&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
Jen remained sitting there for hours, watching as other chickens got up and left, and others sat with their eggs, stuck with the same fate as her. Jen&#39;s dad showed up at one point with a basket. It looked like he was here to collect the layed eggs. One by one he picked up the chickens and took all of the eggs. He soon got to Jen who he was easily able to lift.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... You got quite the collection don&#39;t you there!&quot; Jen&#39;s dad said. Jen did not reply or do anything, she just stared into the distance. He eventually put her back down onto the nest. Once he was done with all of the chickens Jen&#39;s dad left. Jen for sure thought that now she would be able to get up, but that didn&#39;t seem to be the case, she was still stuck.<br />
<br />
As the day continued to go by, Jen watched as chickens continued on their regular day; eating, laying eggs and etc. It was around night time, when Jen felt the sensation again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.&quot; Jen said in a bored voice. Jen layed up to 10 eggs. She was again no longer able to move any of her mucles, stuck overnight not being able to move. At least she would be able to sleep.<br />
<br />
As morning arrived, Jen awoke. She tried to move her body, and she could! It looked like she had to cool down after having layed eggs in order to move again, she took the most out of this opportunity and got up and started to head towards the exit, only, again the feeling arose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not now... This would have been my escape!&quot; Jen yelled. It was no use, Jen walked all the way back towards her own nest and started to lay eggs again. &quot;Why does this have to happen to me, it could have been anyone else!&quot; Jen yelled!<br />
<br />
Again Jen was now stuck sitting for the full day, on top of 10 eggs. What a life to live.</p>
