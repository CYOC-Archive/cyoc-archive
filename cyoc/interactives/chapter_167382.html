<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex moaned deeply, his body sweaty from the transformation. The feeling was indescribable, he felt power flowing through his whole body. Like he could pounce across a whole football field or rip a door off its hinges. His mind felt clearer, the thoughts of school and fear drifted out of his mind replaced with this beast-like urge to create more were-beasts so that they could share this gift.<br />
<br />
The wolf who had changed Alex, pounced out of the lecture theater. Alex swiftly followed surprised by his enhanced agility. As they travelled through the corridor Alex noticed other students being converted. One in particular was growing so big in size, his beafy arms dented the lockers. Alex couldn&#39;t tell what the kid was yet, he didn&#39;t have time to process the information when the wolf he was following suddenly stopped in his tracks.<br />
<br />
It snarled angrily, shaking violently. Alex looked worringly at the figure, alongside other beast creatures who had stopped converting students. The wolf creature, moaned loudly as his body changed further into an animal. His already muscle tight body expanded outwards to surprising proportions. His muzzle while already long contorted even further, his facial features becoming more expressed. The fur grew more ragged alongside his hide. By the end of this 2nd transformation the wolf was almost a 2 times bigger than he was before.<br />
<br />
Alex was shocked. Is this why the werebeasts were so reliant on converting people, so that they themselves could evolve even further. It would explain the urges which were swimming around Alex&#39;s brain. He wanted that, to evolve. The ability to morph his body however he wanted. But to allow that, he needed to convert.<br />
<br />
Alex ditched the wolf, for a quieter area. He knew a few hiding places around the school. Places he would hang out with his old mates, Alex wasn&#39;t sure they had been converted but if not. He knew where they might be.<br />
<br />
His old friends Clara, Pete and Anji had a secret hideout in the old shed outside the football pitch and beyond the school perimeters. They might be hiding there if they weren&#39;t already converted. Alex made his way down the first floor stairs outside. He felt the cold air wash through the hair on his back. It felt amazing, this feeling of freedom. He never anticipated this was how life would play out.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before Alex had reached the old shed, it was quiet. A little too quiet. While Alex could hear the frantic screaming and howling in the background, they were only echoes nearly 100 metres away from this isolated bit of land. The shed was old, its wood peeled off the walls like dead skin. The building was ominous, even in Alex&#39;s new form he felt a sense of dread by the building. He advanced on all fours towards the entrance, he peered through the cracks but there was only darkness. <br />
<br />
Whispers. Alex could hear them, it must of been his heightened senses but he could make out cold words coming from the old structure.<br />
<br />
&quot;One.....outside&quot;<br />
&quot;Stay......quiet&quot;<br />
&quot;Get.....from door&quot; Alex could make out.<br />
<br />
A strong smell filled his nostrils, the closer he get to the door. An intoxicating smell of iron, that made Alex feel hungry. There were three people in that shed, three victims to convert, three morsels to further his evolution.<br />
<br />
Alex pounced towards the door but was immediately thrown back, the door swung only a portion. A sound of chains, was stopping him from his prey. Alex could hear screaming inside, it send his brain spiralling. He pounced towards the door again, this time with his thick shoulder, the iron chain snapped releasing the door from its stasis. <br />
<br />
Light swam into the room highlighting two students cowering in the far corner of the shed. It was mostly stripped bare, aside from a few tools. Alex recognised the two faces, Pete and Anji his two friends before this whole mess. The male was crying, staring at Alex with fear. While the female was petrified, shaking slightly. <br />
<br />
Alex felt a longing inside of him, the friendship he had with these two. He wanted to convert them, to join him in this splendid form. But he felt wierd about it, unlike before. His enormous body ached as he slowly entered the building. He felt poisoned by choice, he slowly made his way to them, and moaned lowly. His instincts were taking over, all he could taste was iron.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pete....Anji, join me your friend&quot; Alex moaned, not sure if they could understand him. Pete&#39;s eyes whitened and Anji let out a soft cry. But before Alex could make any movements, he felt a sharp pain on his head, before his vision went black.</p>
