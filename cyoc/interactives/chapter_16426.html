<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken sits on the edge of the bed with his head full of alcohol. He really over did it on the drinks tonight. He could recall boasting to his friend Zack about how Jeff would become a dog. He knew he won 50 bucks too. It was shaping up to be a good night.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does this work?&quot; Zack asked him as he sat at the console examining the machine. &quot;I just type it in and point it at somebody?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... try yerself.. hehe&quot; Ken was having trouble talking without slurring his words.<br />
<br />
Click click click came the sound of typing as Zack entered in the next few commands with a wide grin on his face. He pointed the machine at Ken and pressed enter with a theatrical motion to begin the process.<br />
<br />
Jeffy stood like a good dog man in the corner watching. Ken hadnt given him a new command and he was having fun watching Ken in his drunken state so he figured he would hang out and wait a while, see what happened.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yer not changing in... to anything.&quot; Ken stated with a dopey satisfied grin that only one who is drunk can manage.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Im not. I decided to try it on you first. I set the change for 15 minutes and the duration for 2 months so you can really enjoy the change, and then stay that way a while. Dont worry though. I left your thoughts intact, unlike dog boy here.&quot; Zack pointed with his thumb over at the smooth muscled form of Jeffy who just stood watching, he was having fun just being included in the shenanigans, plus his dog half liked being near his master.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? Whadid ya do that for... oh... Im too drunk to care though - hey my clothes!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kens clothing vanished as the transformation began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give em back!&quot; he tried to stand but was too dizzy and sat back on the bed. &quot;Im feeling tingly, and more sober too. Hey. Im not drunk anymore. Whoah thats cool. Wait a second... what did you do?&quot; He glared accusingly at Zack who just smiled.<br />
<br />
Sitting naked on the bed Kens body was on display. His dick was laying on top of his balls, his curly pubic hair adorning the top and a a small trail extending up to his belly button. His chest was normally smooth and had little hair, but it was now totally hairless. In a few seconds his dick was hairless as well. His body hair just sort of fell out and vanished as he skin became shinier.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel warm... oh god my skin is smooth. Check it out! You totally gave me a model's body! Thanks bro!&quot; Ken stood up and admired himself. As the seconds ticked away he became a little muscular, so subtle he almost didnt notice. His pecs swelled and his abs gained more definition. His arms became firm and large as his calves and thighs filled in too.<br />
<br />
He posed there in front of Zack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I look almost as good as Jeffy. Haha!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wait. It gets better. Its only been 5 minutes.&quot; Zack grinned.<br />
<br />
Ken felt himself becoming aroused and looked down. His dick was rising slowly, becoming firm. Maybe Zack had wanted to have sex with him? He wasnt really in to that idea. He quickly realized that wasnt the plan as he felt a little twinge of pleasure ripple through him and saw the tip of his dick expand a little, like a balloon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god. What the hell is that? Whats happening?&quot; Ken watched in horror as the change spread.<br />
<br />
His dick became shiny and smooth. The end closed up and it looked like a clown's balloon sticking out from him. It made a squeak as he reached down and grabbed it. It was inflated, it was smooth and rubbery, but he could feel himself touching it. It felt good like masturbating only different now. Smoother. Rubbery.<br />
<br />
His balls changed too, slowly turning in to a rubbery latex that inflated and then deflated a little as they became a little lump at the base of his dick. Not really there, they werent important anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man you are so gonna get it. Gimme that machine!&quot; Ken reached for Zack who stepped away easily and laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;My hands!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kens fingers had merged together and he didnt notice until he reached for Zack. His thumbs stuck out as his fingers melted together and made squeaky pops as they turned in to plastic, forming his hands in to mittens. His feet were changing too now. They lost some of their form and looked like socks as his toes melted together and his flesh turned to smooth shiny plastic, stretchy and warm as a hissing sound now filled his ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Im inflating. Im turning in to a blow up doll! You bastard!&quot; Ken looked at Zack who just continued to grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup. When you are done I'll get at least 50 bucks worth of fun from you. Just watching this is getting me even hornier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken moaned as he felt his own dick again with his rubbery hands. It was smooth and firm and felt so good. Zack would indeed have fun with him. His ass felt tight and he knew it had changed too. he couldnt see the little hole that formed there, and he couldnt feel it either because his arms slowly pulled up to his sides and extended out in front of him as they grew smooth shiny plastic over them and inflated to become the welcoming embrace of a rubber sex doll.<br />
<br />
&quot;Im gonna get you baf bor bifff..&quot; Kens mouth became an O and he couldnt speak properly anymore. His face felt tight now, he could hear the hissing fill his head as he turned to plastic. His chest inflated a little and became light as it turned to air inside a rubber skin. He tipped backward a little, the feeling leaving his legs, and he leaned gently against the bed behind him.<br />
<br />
With a little snap an air valve pushed out of his belly right where his belly button used to be. At the same time his hair firmed up and turned to plastic. His eyes glazed over and became rubber too. He was completely changed.<br />
<br />
Zack stepped in to his embrace and kissed him on his rubbery mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now its time for some fun.&quot; He reached down and stroked Ken who was totally immobile but felt everything. Zack was unzipping his pants too, totally oblivious to Jeff who stood in the corner silently watching....</p>
