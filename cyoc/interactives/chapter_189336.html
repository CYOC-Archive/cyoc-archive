<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Uhh... Ohh...&quot; Chris moaned as he started waking up. His memory of the past few minutes was hazy. He was watching a movie with his wife and then... &quot;No good. Can&#39;t remember...&quot; he thought to himself as he lifted himself off of the floor. He scrunched the tip of his nose in order to clear himself up. Looking back to the TV, he watched as the son, now his father lifted his father now the son off the floor. &quot;So its only been a few minutes huh?&quot; he thought again to himself. &quot;Hey honey, are you... okay...&quot; Chris looked around for his wife, but when he laid eyes on someone on the floor, he couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. What lay there was a man&#39;s body completely naked, but one he knew quite intimately. He looked away and back several time to make sure he wasn&#39;t seeing things, and uncomfortable swing of flesh against flesh hitting his chest area, but the man remained. It was him. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; he spoke again. &quot;Ah?!&quot; That was when he noticed his voice was weird. He tried to clear his throat, but the high pitched voice kept coming out. As he felt his neck, his Adam&#39;s apple was missing. Looking forward again, the strange feeling continued. At eye level he could usually see the entire door from where he was standing, but now only about three-quarters of the door were fully visible. &quot;I&#39;ve shrunk?!&quot; he exclaimed and looked down. &quot;No way!&quot; And what greeted him were two massive breasts. He fondled them. They were real. Looking further down, his dick was missing and now a pussy and clit remained in its place. Slowly he looked towards a mirror and reality set upon him. What was staring at him was his wife&#39;s naked body. And then his memory returned. How he moved against his will and took off all his clothes, how he ejaculated his entire seed out, how his wife&#39;s vaginal fluids transferred into his penis, taking it away from him and of the changes the rest of his body went through. &quot;But if I&#39;m Suzanne, then this body is...&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris moved towards the man&#39;s body. He had seen it before. It was his old body. It breathed in and out, unconscious, but still alive. It&#39;s dick was still partially erect and he touched it just to see if it was real. &quot;It&#39;s my wife&#39;s body, so it should be okay right?&quot; As he played with it, the body started to stir. He let go of the now erect cock as his old body started to wake up. &quot;Ugh... What the hell happened?&quot; It said as they woke up as well. Getting slightly up, they looked forward and saw a woman looking at them. A few moments later, a look of shock appeared on their face. &quot;What?!&quot; they let out. Startled by their own voice, they touched their neck and felt the Adam&#39;s Apple jutting out. Looking further down they saw their breasts were gone and in place of their pussy was a fully erect dick with massive hairy balls. Looking back up, they stared at the face in front of them. &quot;Suzanne?&quot; the woman asked and a few seconds later, let out a yell. &quot;Ahhhhhhhh! Oh my god! Chris! Honey, is that you?!&quot; &quot;Ye-Yeah! I think you&#39;re me now..&quot; &quot;And you look like me! Oh god! What the fuck happened?!&quot; &quot;We switched bodies, don&#39;t you remember. Suzanne tried to recollect her thoughts and suddenly remembered. How she moved against her will and took off all her clothes, how she cummed out her guts, how her husband&#39;s seed entered her body and transformed her vagina into a fully functional dick and the rest of the changes besides. &quot;That really happened?!&quot; &quot;Well, obviously it did. Look at you. Does that belong to a woman?&quot; Chris said as he pointed at his wife&#39;s groin. Her dick moved back and forth. She touched it briefly and felt it spring up and down more. &quot;Oh my god! I&#39;ve got a dick!&quot; &quot;That you do.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m a man now! This just isn&#39;t right!&quot; &quot;I know. I&#39;m freaking out too, but we need to calm down a bit. Here let&#39;s get into each other&#39;s clothes. We don&#39;t want to be naked, do we?&quot; &quot;Oh... okay. You&#39;re right...&quot; Still a little upset, Suzanne did what she was told and put on her husbands clothes. Her erection still poked visibly though, but she ignored it for the time being. She helped her husband out her bra on and they were fully clothed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boy, we sure did yell a lot their didn&#39;t we?&quot; Chris said as Suzanne clasped the bra back together. &quot;We sure did. I wonder if Alex and Lisa... Wait... We&#39;re they yelling too?&quot; &quot;Yeah, maybe if were lucy, they didn&#39;t hear us and we can pretend we&#39;re... each... other...&quot; Just then, Chris realized what his wife was implying. &quot;You don&#39;t think...&quot; &quot;Umm... let&#39;s check them just to be safe.&quot; Chris and Suzanne left their room and into Alex&#39;s room. Chris knocked on the door. &quot;Hey, are you two alright!&quot; he shouted, but their was no answer. &quot;Open the door,&quot; Suzanne said. Taking a deep breath, he did as she said and opened it. What awaited them were their two baby girls lying on the floor... completely buck naked. &quot;Well shit!&quot; Chris said as he and his wife realized their family&#39;s life was going to be a little different from now on.</p>
