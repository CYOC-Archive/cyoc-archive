<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Naomi&#39;s Perspective:<br />
<br />
Naomi left early in the morning as she had always done, top condition required top of the morning exercise. Stretching as she got out of bed throwing off last nights pajamas to the floor, she&#39;d get them later. She kept her body slender with just a hint of muscle showing through. It was because she didn&#39;t want to scare off the guys after all. With that same goal in mind she kept her body virtually hairless, there was a whole mess of product in the bathroom. Her body was so tight that even her modest B cups were just so perky. Feeling a bit bubbly she gave her breasts a firm squeeze with a big grin and confident chuckle. A little secret that she kept from the others was she kept her tan perfect throughout, meant a bit of private sunbathing but, it was worth it. <br />
<br />
She finally got into her sports bra and panties and sat before her closet trying to decide red or blue today... It felt like a blue kind of day, not exactly certain why but, ah well. With her blue gym clothes on, she quickly yet, quietly made for the door. Natasha was still asleep in her room and could be a real bear if her beauty sleep were interrupted. A roll of her eyes and a click of the lock, she set off on a jog to the gym. The idea of living so close to a gym was all hers, Natasha just kind of piggybacked on the room and board department. Once, at the gym, she got a sports drink from the machine and set off to the track. The jog here was just to wake her up and get a nice warm feeling in her body. <br />
<br />
Warm ups on the side of the track all finished, she waited impatiently from a pair of slow runners and bolted down the straight. She didn&#39;t want to burn herself out too quickly so she kept it at a mild pace for the first few laps. After the third lap though, she alternated as fast as she could go for two laps and a brisk jog for two more. She caught attention with her speed around the track, it was her dream to run for a big team. Daydreaming about that bright future came easily and helped ease some of the exhaustion she felt. Sweat trickled off of her body with every stride she made, the cool wind made for a beautiful temperature on the early summer morning. <br />
<br />
As much as she loved to run and work out though, she did wish she could just sleep in like Natasha. However, she knew that if she did, it&#39;d become a habit and that would bring her dreams to ruin. She ran as fast as she could on this lap to purge the thought from her mind. That was why she had gone along on that trip to the magician&#39;s house. If that wish could really come true then she could sleep in, eat all kinds of junk, and even binge watch a whole lot of movies. Exercising would just be a way to feel good without having to be a ritual. Catching herself slowing too much, she made one last lap at full speed and called it enough for now. She sat along the side of the track to cool down but, kept on with easy stretches so she didn&#39;t tighten up. <br />
<br />
The long day working out at the gym left her feeling amazing, she walked briskly home to start the rest of her day. Unlocking the door and stepping inside, she leaned her head in the doorway hearing a sound. Cautiously she stepped inside, one sometimes had to be wary when you were a young woman living alone. It was coming from the bathroom, she carefully opened the door and saw it was just the shower running. Turning the shower off, she wondered to herself if she didn&#39;t accidentally leave it on last night... The shower would have to wait as she&#39;d want to take a warm one rather than freeze her tits off. So she skipped it for now grabbing a bowl of cereal and flopping on to the couch for morning sports news. It was then that her eyes fell on the figurine sitting in the middle of the coffee table.<br />
<br />
She has gotten it because it came from the types of games that Marie loved to play. It wasn&#39;t a secret among her closest friends that she was into the kinky kind of games. This didn&#39;t bother them much, maybe it bothered Lily quite a bit which made it even more fun for Naomi. On top of getting a gift for Marie, she could have a little fun teasing Lily with it. Having finished her breakfast and gotten tired of smelling herself she took to the shower. There really was a lot of product in here that she hardly ever used since she hardly ever needed to look that good... She tossed her clothes into the hamper and stepped into the shower letting the warm water run down from her hair. She scrubbed herself thoroughly and of course conscientiously around her lady parts just in case. She switched the water over to cold for the final rinse to keep her skin tight and consequently got a rise out of her nipples. They&#39;d ease up by the time she got over to visit with the others.<br />
<br />
Soon she was outside the rest of the group&#39;s apartment with the figurine hidden in a bag. She knocked and made a mental bet which one them would answer, Eve. Sure as the sun would rise in the morning, Eve opened the door and gave a soft smile to Naomi. <br />
<br />
&quot;Early as ever, Naomi. The other girls should be getting up any minute now. I&#39;ve got breakfast ready for everyone if you want any.&quot; Eve wore her smile through the entire greeting. She was more like a mother than a friend sometimes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I just finished mine, I wouldn&#39;t want to have to work even harder tonight to burn it all off.&quot; Naomi grinned with an accompanying chuckle as she eased past Eve. Once she was inside she sat her bag next to her customary spot at the table and settled in to wait for the rest. As dysfunctional as they were, this apartment was like clockwork. First up was always Eve, girl had an internal alarm clock, they all swore it. She always woke up just before sunrise to start the day&#39;s cleaning and cook breakfast. Second up was always Eliza, there she was with her hair tied up in her morning do. She sat at the table with a Sudoku book, she did one puzzle every day to wake up. Next on the line up was Little Lily, she always came out of her room like a little mouse. Poking her face out of the cracked door, she scanned the room and scuttled over to Marie&#39;s. Last of all was Marie, she notoriously stayed up all night playing her games. &quot;Just one more path, one more quest, one more interest.&quot; She always said that and it gave Lily her self-appointed task of waking Marie up for breakfast. Marie staggered out of her room rubbing her right eye still in yesterday&#39;s clothes. Lily hustled out behind her, closing the door and setting at the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mornin&#39;...&quot; Croaked the barely conscious Marie to everyone else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Sleepy. I&#39;ll have your breakfast to you in a moment.&quot; Eve spoke in a sing-song tone to Marie every morning. Something about wanting to make her a bit more chipper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning everyone...&quot; Words spoken passively over a number covered page no less.<br />
<br />
&quot;G-good morning.&quot; Lily had a tiny voice to match her tiny frame. It was a wonder that one of the others didn&#39;t take her to bed like a soft toy. <br />
<br />
That last thought almost brought a giggle out of Naomi. Just the thought of Mama Bear Eve carting Lily off to bed under her arm. It was almost even fitting when she thought about it, might make her less nervous. With a mental shrug she watched the others eat their breakfast at various paces. It was always so nice to have the five of them eat at the table together. Eve always gave the last real chair to one of the rest opting to take the lawn chair for herself. There was a spare in the corner for outtings or just in case another chair broke. Once the breakfast was finished by the gathering, Naomi reached for her bag.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Hey Lily, I got you something...&quot; She said wearing a grin that was just a bit mischievous. Lily&#39;s eyes lit up just like always, she loved gifts and Naomi would be sure to get her one later. Instead for now, she produced the figurine meant for Marie and presented it on the table prominently. The figurine was of a beautiful blonde haired girl in a traditional Japanese school girl outfit jumping excitedly. Seeing Lily starting to reach for it, Naomi grabbed it first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah ah, slow down. This is a special figurine don&#39;t you know?&quot; Naomi&#39;s grin grew wider when Lily&#39;s expression shifted to curiosity. &quot;Yeah, see?&quot; With a swift motion she pulled skirt and panties down the legs revealing the intricately detailed sex underneath. Reactions sparked across the table almost instantly. Lily turned beet red and scurried from the table, Eve put a hand over her mouth in surprise, Eliza sighed and rolled her eyes as she adjusted her glasses, and Marie&#39;s eyes gleamed clearly out of their sleepy stupor. After the clothing was properly situated on the figurine again, Naomi gave it to its proper recipient. Figurine and its new owner disappeared into their cave of a room, Eve removed the dishes giving a softly scolding look to Naomi, and Eliza took her book to her room to ready for a shower. Having had enough humor from her joke, Naomi apologized to Eve and left to the bathroom to figure out why her skin felt a little too tight...<br />
<br />
Once in the bathroom, Naomi stripped down for the third time today to give a self inspection. It must&#39;ve been the lighting but, her skin seemed a bit darker around her torso but, that&#39;d be impossible. The next thing struck suddenly as she had felt like she hadn&#39;t eaten at all this morning. Moreover it left feeling hollow rather than hungry. Without warning she suddenly fell backward away from the sink. When she opened her eyes, she couldn&#39;t believe them. Her waist had separated leaving her split in two on the bathroom floor, overcoming the shock she made to scream. It would&#39;ve been successful if at that moment her body hadn&#39;t collapsed on itself as if made of fabric. <br />
<br />
There she lay unable to move, scream, or even shed a tear as arms and legs came apart like thread drawing inward. Her body continued to darken as more of it fed inward and soon even her head had begun to pull down. Unlike the limbs, it seemed the change was purposely affecting this part of her in a different manner than the rest. The split in her midsection had stopped just about her waist and just below her breast line. Her legs and arms were now gone as her eyes reached her chest, with her bottom section finished first she saw her fate. Her last thoughts were of what she&#39;d become a decorative pair of black lingerie. With the last thought drifting into nothing, the change completed filling the cups with her head. If one looked closely to the design on the underwear lying on the floor, they could faintly make out decoratively designed nipples and vagina on them. <br />
<br />
Eliza walked into the bathroom to get ready for her shower when she saw the underwear lying there. She turned back and leaned out of the door. &quot;Eve, you left your underwear on the floor in here!&quot; <br />
<br />
Eve hustled over from her place by the sink and peered inside past Eliza finding the lingerie as well. &quot;Oh dear... I could&#39;ve sworn I carried it over to my room.&quot; She knelt down picking the silky undergarments and stepped out of the bathroom with an apologetic look to Eliza. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, I&#39;ll be more careful.&quot; She smiled warmly to Eliza as she left to deposit the underwear in her hamper. <br />
<br />
Eliza sighed and closed the door unable to stay mad at the caring Eve.<br />
<br />
With that situation settled, Eve sat down to read the news paper that had just been delivered. On the back of the paper was an ad for a nearby apartment put up for rent.</p>
