<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first experiment had been a resounding success. Ty had granted life and consciousness to a simple plastic toy. The rush of godlike power was almost intoxicating, but meek Ty tried not to let it go to his head. After all, he now had a commitment to the little dinosaur waiting patiently in his hand. What kind of life would it have if it could barely move, couldn&#39;t speak, couldn&#39;t eat, didn&#39;t have working hands, and remained tiny and helpless?<br />
<br />
Ty thought about this carefully. The toy dinosaur seemed to grow nervous again as Ty stared at it.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” Ty whispered again, though sharp enough to make his little friend jump slightly. Apparently it had been lost in thought. The hadrosaur stared up at Ty expectantly, nervously making itself smaller and meeker. “Are you a boy or a girl?”<br />
<br />
The dinosaur cocked its head to the side and looked away, apparently giving it an honest thought. Its stiff arms finally shrugged and it shook its head.<br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t know?” Ty smiled.<br />
<br />
The parasaur shook its head no again and tried to turn, gesturing toward its tail and shaking its head again.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Ty lit up. “I get it! You don&#39;t have a sex. You&#39;re nothing. Is that right?”<br />
<br />
The dinosaur nodded meekly under the human&#39;s gaze and shrank back again in Ty&#39;s palm.<br />
<br />
“Well, let&#39;s start there. Do you want to be a boy or a girl?”<br />
<br />
This seemed to be too much of a choice for the living toy to handle. It shrugged again and nervously pointed its molded hand out to Ty. The inflection was obvious. You pick for me.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re okay with me deciding?”<br />
<br />
The dinosaur nodded gently.<br />
<br />
“Okay. Well.” Ty grinned. “I&#39;d... I&#39;d kind of like you to be a girl. Is that all right?”<br />
<br />
The plastic hadrosaur considered it for a moment and nodded enthusiastically.<br />
<br />
“Okay. Then you&#39;ll be female.” Ty whispered. He urged the hadrosaur to have a defined gender as a female. To his amazement, the dinosaur stood in his palm again, nervously turning its head toward its tail, and together they watched as small plastic bulge emerged under the toy&#39;s tail. Its face seemed to slim slightly. It looked over itself – herself – as she became a subtly female Parasaurolophus.<br />
<br />
The newly minted girl dinosaur looked back to Ty and cowered a little. She was so nervous. Then again, Ty reasoned, if I had just been brought to life and was less than two inches tall in the hand of a giant human with godlike powers, I&#39;d be freaked out too.<br />
<br />
“Hey, I was thinking,” Ty began. “How about I improve your body a little? Maybe give you working fingers, more flexibility, the ability to emote, that kind of thing?”<br />
<br />
The toy looked back over herself and then back to Ty. She looked at him blankly and just nodded.<br />
<br />
“Okay. I&#39;m gonna set you down, all right?”<br />
<br />
The hadrosaur nodded her consent. Ty set his hand down and watched as the dinosaur hopped off his palm, stumbled down his finger, and fell onto her plastic stomach on the carpet. Ty giggled, helped her up again, and she turned to face him, embarrassed slightly.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s okay!” Ty reassured her gently. “Don&#39;t be ashamed. You&#39;re still learning to move.”<br />
<br />
The dinosaur nodded again and waited.<br />
<br />
Ty carefully visualized what he wanted for her. Her body would stay living plastic for now, but her features and dexterity would change. Her seamlines would smooth, making her less of a stiff plastic toy. Her appearance would become smooth and anatomically correct, more closely resembling her real species. Her fingers would develop, her mouth would split, but her face would be able to move, to emote, all of her fine details and molding would become movable and realistic.<br />
<br />
The tiny toy dinosaur staggered slightly and arced her back as her plastic body began to change. Did she feel it, he wondered? She must have, because she was reacting to whatever was happening inside of her right now. Ty watched as the toy&#39;s body lengthened slightly and gained proper proportion. Her arms enlarged, her tiny hands began to split into fingers. Her beak parted and she let out a silent crackling gasp as she could suddenly close her eyes. She did, approximating pleasured erotic shock, which was startling for Ty, as she fell onto her front legs and raised her hindquarter into the air. This went on for several blissful seconds as her body became far more realistic in proportion until it was a perfect copy of what a hadrosaur should look like. Her neck was longer, her flexibility had increased. She was emotive, even at her tiny size, and Ty saw her face turn to utter joy as she stared up at him with simple plastic eyes complete with a newly molded pupil inset. He actually watched her tiny gaze follow him. Yet, far more advanced than a simple dinosaur, she smiled excitedly and wagged her tail.<br />
<br />
“Feel better?” Ty smiled. He was thinking about the strange moment of pleasure he had seen on her developing face. It had been so raw, so exciting for him. He wondered how she felt. Did she experience some kind of toy sexual energy? Did she have a sexuality? He wondered if his little friend could feel his touch. Could she feel other things?<br />
<br />
The hadrosaur looked herself over, her head twisting on a far more flexible neck, and she smiled in approval and nodded up at Ty, face beaming, a pleasant and adorable smile on her little flat beak and the corners of her mouth. She opened it to try and talk, but she still didn&#39;t have the ability. So instead she waited politely, long thick tail swaying slightly.<br />
<br />
“Is it easier to move?” Ty asked, watching as his little friend experimentally flexed her new digits and curled her toes. She raised her legs, turned around in a circle, and twisted her body this way and that, testing out her uncannily impossible orange plastic form. Satisfied, she turned back and nodded pleasantly, still smiling. Ty could even see the detail of teeth and a moving tongue in her mouth.<br />
<br />
The idea of somehow harming his new friend or reverting this creature from this point gave him the chills. He was responsible for her, so he would care for her and keep her. Besides, her excited little face was really cute.<br />
<br />
“Good.” Ty nodded. “Hey, I wonder, can you feel?” He couldn&#39;t resist.<br />
<br />
The dinosaur took her hand and brushed it over her snout gently. She paused, considering the sensation, and nodded.<br />
<br />
“You could feel your changes? Like inside? Outside?”<br />
<br />
She considered, and nodded quickly. To Ty&#39;s infinite amusement he saw her tiny face smile wide again.<br />
<br />
“Felt good, huh?” Ty grinned.<br />
<br />
Again, the toy dinosaur nodded.<br />
<br />
“Can I pet you?” Ty asked, watching the dinosaur eagerly wag her tail and nod. She turned her side toward him and waited with a patient smile.<br />
<br />
Ty reached a finger out the gently stroked the tiny hadrosaur&#39;s back, trailing from her crest, down her neck, over her clearly defined spine (though he was certain she was nothing but plastic inside), and down her tail. Several strokes made the little orange parasaur melt. She smiled, lowered her neck, and enjoyed the touch.<br />
<br />
When Ty stopped, she looked up at him appreciatively and nuzzled his finger with her face.<br />
<br />
“I really like you.” Ty whispered again, making the dinosaur toy smile. “Can I keep developing you? Or do you want to stay this way?”<br />
<br />
She considered this for a moment and stared up at him excitedly. She held out her arms, hands together, and mimicked one hand raising over the other, then pointed to herself. It took Ty a second as he stared at her trying to puzzle out what she meant.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” He realized, pointing. “That&#39;s pretty clever,” he laughed, “You want to grow. Is that right?”<br />
<br />
She nodded enthusiastically, bobbing her snout, and stared up at him with a sweet smile.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I can make you bigger!” Ty smiled. But... did he want to keep her a mute toy? He considered this as he thought about his next move.</p>
