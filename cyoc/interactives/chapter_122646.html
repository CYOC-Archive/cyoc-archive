<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>iWTBAT you're awesome. <br/>
<br/>
Let's make this one longer shall we?<br/>
<br/>
Isaac will leave this crypt either cured...<br/>
<br/>
Or a corrupted in body Monster.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure to never make Isaac lose the rings as it will make it Interesting.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Isaac felt helpless and aroused. The fact that he couldn&#39;t fight back even when he has this new body made him feel helpless and how he was to be used right now aroused him.<br />
<br />
As he was contemplating he didn&#39;t register the fact that they had reached their destination. He struggled and was confused as to why his ice skin was not slippery to them. His vine construct body tensed within as the vines moved in tandem as if it was muscle, which in this body, they are.<br />
<br />
Isaac yelped as his body met the hard stone floor with a sharp crack as his ice skin impacted. He almost didn&#39;t feel a thing. Was that how strong he is now?<br />
<br />
&quot;Me first?&quot; The incubus asked his vile companions &quot;because my balls are really aching right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
A shrug was given as a response by the succubus, that then with a sultry smirk gave a small giggle. &quot;I&#39;d like to get hot... you go first&quot; <br />
<br />
The witch gave a nonchalant but definitely horny &#39;go ahead&#39; motion.<br />
<br />
Landreust turned his head to the vine ice man and gave a smirk. <br />
<br />
Isaac was still lying on the floor thinking of a strategy. The ghoul was holding his legs and the incubus had pinned him to the ground. Its oversized member at full mast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold his arms down for me&quot; the incubus ordered and the succubus and the witch suddenly lunged and pinned his arms to the floor. They were heavy and Isaac could see how his arms flexed in struggle given by how the vines kept shifting within his translucent arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;Say Aaa&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-&quot; was all Isaac could say as a heated rod plunged into his throat. It took a moment to register it was a cock.<br />
<br />
Eyes widening in shock Isaac tried to shake it out. The ice skin on him didn&#39;t crack, as if they were real skin and is flexible. It was as hard as ice but his joints stretched the ice. The incubus went deep as Isaac could feel it stretching his throat wider and the vines and ice skin stretched in submission.<br />
<br />
That was when a sudden feeling of entry made itself known. He tried to struggle and see but all he could see is crotch of the snow white incubus. He felt how the rotten member of the ghoul penetrate him. It was short however as the ghoul didn&#39;t last a minute as it came deep into Isaac. The corruption in the seed spread quickly as it came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmph!&quot; Isaac struggled against the weight. He tried to bite the incubus&#39; member off with his monstrously sharp ice thorn teeth but all it did was make the incubus moan.<br />
<br />
He came into his throat in copious amounts and Isaac couldn&#39;t help but swallow, as the ejaculation appeared deep into his throat bypassing his gag reflex. <br />
<br />
As he swallowed more his body roiled in suffering. He is stronger now, but he couldn&#39;t fight back?<br />
<br />
Corrupted in body yet he was weak?<br />
<br />
No more. The laughs from the vile creatures sparked something within his icy thorny heart. <br />
<br />
NO!<br />
<br />
It was a moment as the room they were in became silent. <br />
<br />
The crack of ice was heard. The survival instincts of the bramble thorns and the apparent rage of an elemental surged through Isaac.<br />
<br />
The room was filled with screams as it was filled to the brim with ice covered thorn bramble vines that took over the entire room. <br />
<br />
The screams died out and the brambles retreated, creating a figureless lump of vines several times bigger than Isaac. It froze instantly into a lump of icy vines.<br />
<br />
The four vile creatures gone from the room.<br />
<br />
As Isaac started to snap out of his apparent rage he couldn&#39;t help but notice how full he felt. It was as if he was overstuffed.<br />
<br />
As his body began to shrink into form the vines started the construction of Isaac&#39;s body. It grew up taller and took a humanoid shape. As it formed several things happened at once. All Isaac could do was gasp as another set of arms bursts from his sides. They were white as snow and Isaac knew they were the incubus&#39;. His form roiled as vines lash at his surroundings in a fit of rage. Horns suddenly burst into being on his head as Isaac recoiled at the sudden appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;GAAH!&quot; Isaac screamed as his body failed to form. <br />
<br />
As a final attempt of survival the vines wrapped around Isaac like a shell and froze. Isaac&#39;s last thought was how lucky he is to still have the ring on his vine fingers.<br />
<br />
After a few hours the shell shifted. It coiled inside the shell and took a form. The new beings it assimilated was put to use. <br />
<br />
As the form took shape and froze Isaac awoke.<br />
<br />
And fell to the floor with a heavy crash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agh! What...&quot; Isaac said as he rubbed his ice head.<br />
<br />
He thought he was fine when he saw the new pair of arms and the feeling of a set of horns adorning his head. The apparent feeling of the vine tail that whipped about his vision froze Isaac in place. <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened here!?&quot; And decided, that he needed a mirror.</p>
