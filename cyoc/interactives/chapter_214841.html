<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Lily went to dial 9/11 on her phone, the baby merchild began to laugh like any happy would but as he/she did it extended its hands.<br />
<br />
“NO…” said Chloe as she tried to stop it but she couldn’t, the baby clapped again as another wave of energy shot out and engulfed the three of them still sitting in the sand but now extending outwards, washing over his sister-in-law Lily, her girlfriend Zoey and her in-laws. <br />
<br />
Once again, all sound seamed to stop and Lily’s eyes widened as she attempted to dial her phone only to have it fall out of her hands and into the sand below. Before she could do anything, she began to fall landing with a thud and a crashing sound. She had landed in such a way, that her shoulder had smashed into her cell phone. <br />
<br />
Staying balanced a second or two longer was Zoey but she fell backwards almost hitting the rocks where they had originally found the merchild.<br />
<br />
“MOM…DAD…” said Luke as Chloe turned toward her in-laws. Molly had been kneeling beside Luke and she had fallen backwards onto her ass but had remained upright while, James had been running back toward the stuff likely in an attempt to get his cell phone or something else that could possibly help. He had been running full speed when his ankles had snapped together so he had faceplanted into the sand. <br />
<br />
Chloe’s eyes widened as she looked at her mother-in-law, she was in her mid-50s and looked about average for her age. Fit but clearly packing more weight than she had when she had been younger, her blonde hair was something she had passed down to both of her children now had more greys in it and had become duller. Her wrinkles, she said marked her with wisdom and was a sign of motherhood. <br />
Those seamed to be disappearing, they weren’t going away but she now looked closer to what she did in photos she had seen of her and her husband’s wedding day. She would put her in mid 30s instead of mid 50s. Her skin seamed smoother and judging by how her cloths where now fitting her breasts had regained some of the perkiness of youth. Her hair began to turn into a golden color just like her now merman son. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck.” Cursed Lily as she rolled over so that she faced the sky. <br />
<br />
Her speaking brought Chloe’s attention to her, Lily looked breathtaking beautiful right now, as if someone had put on a professional beauty makeup on her face. Her lips where fuller, a type of scaled pattern eye green eyeshadow had appeared…or was that actually scales. Her hair had become a golden color like her brother and mother, however unlike either of them her ears where becoming slightly pointed. <br />
<br />
“Zoey…are you alright.” Inquired Lily<br />
<br />
“I wish, I could say I was.” Stated Zoey as she sat up, her legs had already fused all the way, her shorts and bikini bottom having ripped apart. Her legs stretched out as the flesh turned to scales before coming in a rather beautiful mixture of purples, whites and mostly this beautiful lavender color which really popped with her chocolate color skin. <br />
<br />
Her hands moved to touch her tail hoping it wasn’t real, but it was. <br />
<br />
As she did, the rest of her body began to change, before she would have turned anyone’s head but now she looked like she belonged on the front cover of a fashion magazine. What didn’t help was the white bikini top she had been wearing, was now close to overflowing as her hips narrowed even as her bust grew larger. Her black hair seamed to become darker and fuller as it fell around her shoulders in beautiful locks as her now pointy ears, far longer and far more pointed than anyone’s else poked out of her hair. Finally, her eyes turned into the same lavender color as what was found in her tail.<br />
<br />
Getting up now, looking at her own tail was her girlfriend, Lily. She too had a white top on, they had actually picked the same color/style of swimsuit to take photos together today. Lily’s tail colors where almost identical to her brothers with a mixture of blues, blacks and greens, however her tail seamed to have more greens then blue compared to her brother’s. Like all the women, her bust seamed bigger and she looked as if a beauty makeup had become the new normal. <br />
<br />
“Honey…are you alright.” Inquired Molly as Chloe looked back to her in laws. <br />
<br />
Molly had finished changing as well, she looked a lot younger and a mixture of greens, whites and cream colors made up her tail. <br />
<br />
Back closer to their stuff, James was getting back up. His Hawaiian shirt now loser on him as he seamed to have lost a bunch of weight all at once. His arms looked ripped to hell, with muscles clearly visible even at this distance. His brown hair seamed unchanged but long pointy ears could be seen. His tail had more blacks but with more then a few blue scales. <br />
<br />
Maybe it was the medical training in Chloe, but she noticed all the women had the classic mermaid tail, with one fin along with membranes of different colors around their hips while Luke and Nathan had Y shaped fins at the end of their tails and no membrane around their hips. Maybe it was a sexual trait between mermaids and merman.<br />
<br />
“I think…we are all in the same boat now.” Said Nathan as he kept himself pressed to his mother’s side as everyone tried to figure out what the hell just happened.</p>
