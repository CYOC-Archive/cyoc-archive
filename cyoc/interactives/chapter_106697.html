<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Twenty minutes after school let out for the day; Brian Walker left the bus and began the short walk to his home. He knows his mom is about to grill him on his after school affair with Alyssa. Sighing he tries to get his story straight before he opens the door. While he did tell the principal that Alyssa was his Aunt, what he didn’t know was that the principal told Sheriff Copper this at the school, shortly after talking to Eric, Spencer and Frieda. So when Brian opens to door to his home, he is surprised to see Sheriff Cooper at his home being waited on by his mother. Brian was completely distracted with the story he had planned, that he didn&#39;t notice the Sheriff&#39;s cruiser in the driveway.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Walker notices her son; “Sit down now,” was all she said.<br />
Brian nervously sits in a chair across for the sheriff as he is sipping tea that Brian’s mother prepared.<br />
Brian,” Mrs. Walker finally speaks up; “This morning I got an interesting email from an anonymous sender. It told me that you were seeing an older lady after class. At first I didn’t believe it, but when the Sheriff here contacted me asking me about what you have been doing after school and stating he got the same email. To say I wasn’t concerned would be a lie.” Looking at her son; “care to explain?”<br />
<br />
Brian gulps, he is about to give the lie that he prepared when Sheriff Cooper interrupts.<br />
“Before you start know this,” the sheriff speaks while pulling out a photo from his wallet and hands it to Brian. “Does the woman in that picture look familiar to you?” The sheriff asks.<br />
<br />
Brian looks at the photo and his jaw drops. The picture shows Sheriff Cooper with Alyssa. The same Alyssa he was boinking for the past few days. The sheriff takes the photo back.<br />
“That was a few years ago,” The sheriff looking at the picture; “While I do have issues with my cousin’s &#39;life style&#39; choices, she is the only family I got.” Looking at Brian; “So imagine my surprise when I talked to your principal today and got a rather interesting story; you told him that Alyssa was your Aunt picking you up after school. I wasn’t aware we were related.”<br />
“We&#39;re not,” Mrs. Walker comments, looking at Brian; “But I am curious as to what you and the Sheriff&#39;s cousin have been up to for the past few days.”<br />
<br />
Both look at Brian, waiting for him to answers. All Brian could think was ‘Alyssa is the Sheriff’s cousin? Would have been helpful to know that you horny were-mer.’ Floored with this revelation Brian forgets the story he had rehearsed.<br />
“We had sex,” was all Brian said.<br />
“That’s it?” Mrs. Walker responds; “No cock and bull story prepared?”<br />
“Well I did have one,” Brian responds; “Seeing the Sheriff here and finding out that Alyssa is his cousin kind of killed it.”<br />
“So when did you two first meet?” The Sheriff probes.<br />
“Monday evening, at the lake,” Brian answers; “Julie was there. Although I’m sure she’ll lie about it. But you can ask her parents. They showed up looking for her mad as hell that she broke curfew.”<br />
“Is that the truth?” Mrs. Walker asks.<br />
“It is,” the Sheriff interrupts; “I talked to my cousin earlier today. She told me the same story, although not as detailed. And I know all about Julie breaking her curfew because the Stovall’s told me all about that shortly before I had to arrest Julie for assaulting Eric Anderson and Frieda Knight on Tuesday.<br />
Mrs. Walker sighs, “Do you know who sent the emails, Sheriff?”<br />
“It was Julie,” Brain answers; “It had to be her.&quot;<br />
“Do you have proof boy?” The sheriffs answers; “and before you suggest I go over to the Stovall residence and look at her computer, know this. I already did. Found nothing; if Julie was the author of the emails, then she covered her tracks extremely well.”<br />
<br />
Brian’s face twists in disgust. He is about to speak up when the Sheriffs radio squawks a bolo alert regarding a woman in a red dress and a town car reported prowling about the Anderson house. The sheriff sighs; “This day just gets better and better.” The sheriff gets up; “I leave you to deal with your son. Looking at Brian; “While you and my cousin are both active weres’ and as such your actions were legal here in Moon Lake, do not think you have gotten away Scott-free. I&#39;m sure your mother will deal with you in her own way.”<br />
<br />
Mrs. Walker escorts the sheriff out the door. As she closes the door, Mrs. Walker looks at her son; “Grounded; Up to your room now! But do not think that this is the end of the issue.”<br />
Brian heads to his room and closes the door; “Well that could have gone better&quot;, he mutters. At least he was able to keep the story of Alyssa setting him up as gigolo to himself. Getting his phone he composes a message to Alyssa. While he was instructed not to contact her he just had to inform her as to what happen.<br />
<br />
‘Sheriff was here with my mother. Why did you not tell me that you and Sheriff Cooper were cousins? The story I had to tell my Principal that you were my aunt was quickly found out, when the Sheriff visited him today. They know when we met, and have had sex for the past three days; but not what happened last night. I was at least careful with that. I’m grounded but do not know for how long.’<br />
<br />
Brian hits send. Already having memorized her number; he scrubs his phone of Alyssa’s contact info and any and all texts and messages sent and received.<br />
“Well played Julie,” he comments to himself; “well played. But two can play at that game.”<br />
Brian gets on his computer and begins to carefully craft a worm that will allow automatically fill it with all sorts of incriminating information. While Julie was a novice when it came to doxing and phishing; Brain was an experience black hat hacker who went by the handle \/\/3LL 3|\|D0\/\/3D; leet speak for Well Endowed.<br />
<br />
It takes Brain several hours to create his worm; a worm that will plant incriminating information on Julie’s computer; information such as how to remove ankle monitors, and other less than innocent search queries. Crafting a self-deleting email and a phantom address he sends it to Julie’s email and grins; “Now your cooked fish face. Even if you are good at deleting your search history, this little bit of code will ensure that any future searches by the sheriff will show your determination to flaunt authority.” Brian hits send; he scrubs his PC to ensure that the email can’t be traced back to him and gets up to use the washroom.</p>
