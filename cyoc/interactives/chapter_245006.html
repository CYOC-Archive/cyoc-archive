<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The laptop screen blinked as the machine awoke from the hibernation mode Richard had put it in and the Chronivac software self-engaged as safety protocols took control. A message popped up stating, &quot;Safety of Subject: High to Critical Threat Range - Exposure of Chronivac: imminent - Danger to Subject if transformation carried out: High&quot;, followed by, &quot;Timer Function Postponed until safety level reduced&quot;.<br />
<br />
A series of clicks and another message appeared as the programme tried to revert the current subject back to a previous state at the exact instant Richard had morphed into a wolf, all in order to reduce the detection threat to the subject and itself, and another message appeared stating, &quot;Target out of range&quot;. Running through safety features built into the software intended to keep both the Chronivac and the user safe, the programme tried to come up with a viable solution which wouldn&#39;t expose itself to too many people at once, whilst at all while making sure the current user wasn&#39;t put in more danger. No viable option found, the software settled for leaving the last twenty-some minutes of the timer suspended as it tried to scan for the subject in order to revert them back to their previous state.<br />
---<br />
<br />
At first, he wasn&#39;t thrilled with being confined and wanted out. But then, having not found a way to escape, it slipped away from him as he roamed about with the other one of his kind. Passing the next couple days doing what felt natural to do, oblivious to how he&#39;d been a human named Richard, failing to understand safety protocols built into his transformation had shifted the amount of animal-to-human mind set ratio to better protect him, he snapped playfully at the female and uttered a series of sounds of excitement.<br />
<br />
The other wolf reciprocated, turned, nimbly stepped away, then turning to look at him. Each play bowing, letting out cries to convey how they felt, the two continued to grow closer to each other as they established their place and formed the start of a pack. As they did this, they explored the enclosure, stumbled onto where the male had gotten into the female&#39;s enclosure, a place smelling of food and humans, a good area to make a den, as well as marked several areas as part of their territory. Watching all of this from monitors, the humans observed the behaviour of the two animals, made notes, and discussed, among other things, when they would return the two to the wilderness as part of their plan to re-build the diminished population of wolves in the area.<br />
<br />
Time passed, but neither of the wolves had a good grasp on the concept of passing days. Focused on solely doing what they usually did, the only deviation was the way they would sometimes take to trying to find a way out of the enclosure, with the male often the instigator. But then he&#39;d lose interest, it&#39;d slip from him again, and he&#39;d turn his attention to roaming, hunting the game released in by the humans every so often, not that he knew this, or being with the female.<br />
<br />
His attention in her growing, it became more and more noticeable as the snow fell and she developed a certain smell which drew him to her. And as they spent more and more time curled up next to each other for warmth in the winter months, his interest in her grew and before long their play began to take on something much more. Instincts and biology began to step in, and soon the male started to want something from the female she at first was not receptive to give. But being the only timber wolf about, he would not relent, and after sometime, as the snow started to lessen, she started to reciprocate his advances before starting to lift her tail, present herself to him.<br />
<br />
Yet, even as she did this, she still teased and played with him. Making him work for it, it was almost as if she was waiting for a specific moment before she first allowed him to approach, then to sniff at her vulva as she lifted a hind leg, something she mirrored by sniffing at his cock. Then, as if sensing everything was right, she didn&#39;t snap at him or pull away when he approached, then mounted her. Using his front legs and paws to hold her in place, his dick sliding from its sheath, he started to thrust at her, then, when it felt it right to do so, he pushed into her slick, feminine folds. Working at her, it wasn&#39;t long before the two was knotted in place, and for a brief moment, the part of the male which was still human surged forward, and Richard took keen interest in what he was doing. But then the moment past, and he was once again more timber wolf than human.<br />
<br />
Their mating continuing in this fashion, though without the sudden resurgence of his human side, after some time the female became less receptive as different instincts took over and the male lost interest. Watching all of this, the humans took notes, and after a bit, they entered the encloser, where the tranquilised both animals. Running some tests, they made sure the male was still healthy, checked the female to see the same and determine if she was pregnant, and upon discovering she was, the prepared for the next step of moving the two timber wolves back to the wild. Making sure the tracker in each was still active, the tag on their ears was secure, they transported the two deep into a forested range far from where they’d caught the male. Figuring both would be better off away from human settlements, unaware the male was actually a human named Richard, the humans in charge of the project did a final examination of the two, then left them where they were. Sleeping soundly, neither wolf would awaken for hours, but when they did, each set out in their own direction, exploring, hunting, and determining where best to establish territory for themselves.</p>
