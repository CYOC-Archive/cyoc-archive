<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Betty gave something of a giggle as Huck scooped her up into his arms and began to carry her toward the master bed in the cabin area. It wasn&#39;t large, as the guest cabins were more for camping than the cabins on the east side of Moon Lake, which were actual residences, but that was the point. It was to be a nice and quiet setting where Huck could welcome Betty into were society and complete a relationship that probably should have begun much sooner. The two had been close friends for years, and even after Huck became a weredog, that didn&#39;t change. He continually did things with Betty to help her out, or help her family out when something had broken at their home, largely showing off what he&#39;d learned from his own father. It was something that weredogs were known for in their helpfulness and loyalty to friends.<br />
<br />
But until recently, Huck had always seen that as a platonic friendship and that Betty as a Moon Lake Normal, while comfortable with Moon Lake&#39;s weres wasn&#39;t interested in anything more than that. While the revelation that Betty did him as something more than just a friend had come at a bad &quot;time,&quot; it at least did come out and Huck was happy to get that revelation. It at least got things out into the open and now, with them legally married, and the room bathed in the soft lighting of the candles and what filtered through the curtains that had been drawn over the cabin&#39;s windows, Huck was happily looking forward to what was to come next. To be with her in every way and cement things as the probably should have been, and that made him smile as he set Betty gently on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; Huck said to her as he climbed up onto the bed, his thoughts going over what was to come and making his penis grow tight in his pants with the anticipation of what was coming. In theory he could transform and safely turn Betty first, and many smaller weres often went with this route when turning a normal, but while Betty had seen him in his Pomeranian Weredog form, he was still a bit self conscious on it. He&#39;d thought he&#39;d become a larger breed when he became a weredog, like a Husky or a Mastiff of some kind. Something that was big and known for it&#39;s use as a working animal. He didn&#39;t expect to become a toy bread, and much like the Pomeranian as a breed, it left him at times wanting to show he was more than a &quot;toy,&quot; particularly when some of his employees teased him a bit on it, knowing they&#39;d get a rise out of him. But Betty never had.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve already said that,&quot; Betty said with a smile as he approached her with one of his knees coming down between her legs and pressing the negligee down onto the top of the bed with his other leg straddling her right leg. &quot;Not that I&#39;m complaining.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just felt like repeating it,&quot; Huck told her and leaned forward softly kissed her.<br />
<br />
The kisses grew more passionate as Betty began to lay back on the bed and Huck moving forward to continue to kiss and then move to add a trail of kisses that went down her neck to the shoulder strap on her negligee. He also brought up one hand to caress her breast through the fabric, which rewarded him with a moan and the feeling of her nipple growing erect and pressing into the sheer fabric and even into Huck&#39;s hand as he moved it. The fabric was soft and smooth, and he privately wondered if this was something that Betty had bought special for tonight, it&#39;d make sense, and would make things better, as it were, but it wasn&#39;t something he would have expected from her. It was something that he&#39;d expected from someone who was a bit more effeminate than Betty was and didn&#39;t have the interest in woodworking and home repair/construction that Betty did, but he wasn&#39;t complaining. The moment was too big for that. It was something that should have happened awhile ago, had he not been too blind to see it, and now it would finally happen.<br />
<br />
Betty eagerly returned the kisses and felt herself growing wet as Huck payed attention her breasts and feeling the fabric of her negligee softly slide over her nipples. It felt good, even as she eagerly, yet nervously, reached her hands downward and began undoing the button on Huck&#39;s pants. They functioned like jeans and he had plenty of pairs of jeans that she owned, so it wasn&#39;t as though she was unaware of how those buttons worked.  After a moment or two, Huck&#39;s hands joined hers, at least to help shimmy himself out of his pants and underwear. It did reveal a larger than average penis growing erect between Huck&#39;s legs and pointed toward her, and while as a weredog, Huck might not be as big as some other male weres, Betty was pretty sure he was easily bigger than the relatively small number of men she&#39;d been with while in college. Though, Huck&#39;s equipment wasn&#39;t the most important thing, as ultimately what had kept those relationships short and private was the fact that she&#39;d always loved Huck as a person and that was what brought her back after she graduated from a vocational school in Oregon and to Jenkins Construction as a secretary and hand, as needed. And now she knew she would get to join in the way she&#39;d desired for years.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem eager,&quot; Huck teased with a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for this for awhile...&quot; Betty teased back, &quot;and I must say... with the lighting... you&#39;ve certainly done your best to make this memorable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was hoping for romantic,&quot; Huck commented, &quot;soft flickering candles... no outside noises... other than maybe some crickets... and just the two of us, as it should be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As it will be,&quot; Betty assured him and kissed him again, passionately with their tongue&#39;s wrestling with one other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Huck smiled as he repositioned himself between his wife&#39;s legs and reached for the bottom hem of the negligee she was wearing and began to lift it up. He was careful as he didn&#39;t want to rip the fabric, &quot;as it will be...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huck... you don&#39;t...&quot; Betty began as softly began to kiss at her thighs and then moved his way up her body. Once he reached her clit and softly began to lick at her vagina, her sentence fell off into a very heavy moan. &quot;Hooooooooaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmm…&quot;<br />
<br />
That really felt good, likely a legacy from the &quot;practice&quot; that Huck had likely had over the years. It was pretty common knowledge to Moon Lake&#39;s residents that Moon Lake&#39;s weres enjoyed sex and were highly active, particularly after they transformed. No were lost control, unless some kind of drug was involved, but their higher libidos made them far more open to saying &quot;yes&quot; to it than normal humans would be. It could make nights in Moon Lake potentially rather noisy given that many of these weres also took their adventures outside their homes, but Betty was used to that, having grown up in Moon Lake all her life. She knew on how active weres could be in that regard, and in that she knew that Huck was no novice when it came to love making, because he&#39;d been a were since High School. The fact that he&#39;d left his pack meetings after the &quot;business&quot; part of the meeting was through was touching, particularly with the sentiment that he was realizing he wanted and needed someone special, and not just another partner for the evening. Though, that was also a different point, and it appeared that Huck was going for a bit of foreplay, and not just plunging himself into her. It was so good that Betty had nothing to complain about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Huuuuuuucccckk…&quot; Betty moaned heavily and thrust her hips up and forward while pulling up with her arms to pull the negligee up. She managed to get it out from under where her bottom was and then let herself come back down. Huck kept his attention with soft licks and kisses that moved from her clit to her other leg and then back to her clit and then up to her navel has Betty continued to pull her negligee up. As she finally got it off and then set it on the bed in a rumpled up pile beside her, Huck&#39;s kisses reached her breasts. And he softly kissed one nipple, Betty finally was overwhelmed and came. &quot;Ohhhhhhhhhhh…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re ready,&quot; Huck said softly to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not going to change?&quot; Betty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll change when you start to change,&quot; Huck said softly to her, &quot;that way we do it together...&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty smiled at that and kissed him again, as Huck came forward and while gently gripping her shoulders began to slowly enter her. Betty moaned heavily as Huck&#39;s erect shaft easily and painlessly slid in and filled her completely. She soon moved her own hips forward to push him further in. Once in, Huck came in again for a few soft kisses to Betty&#39;s lips, cheek, and then neck before falling off into a steady series of thrusts as Betty responded with a series of counter thrusts that built into a steady rhythm, and Betty felt like she was in heaven. She was even happy to see Huck smile down to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you... Huck,&quot; Betty said as she felt her body quiver as another orgasm built and then released as Huck thrust into her again and then felt his penis begin to twitch inside her.<br />
<br />
Huck continued his pace, as he knew he was getting close and then as he finished another thrust into her, he was pushed over the top and erupted into her and moaned, &quot;I... looooove… yooooouuuuu… Mrs. Jeeeenkiiiinsssss!&quot; Betty only answered him with a cry of &quot;yes&quot; as she could her body quiver again before her vagina clinched around his penis in orgasm. Huck leaned over to watch as what was about to soon begin, as Betty began her first transformation. And he didn&#39;t have long to wait.<br />
<br />
It began shortly after Huck had cum into her. In fact it was almost instantaneous for Betty. She felt a great deal of warmth build in her body, along with a burning need in her wet slit, still wrapped around Huck&#39;s penis. It was like every part of her body absolutely needed him and finding that Huck was getting hard again, Betty thrust her hips up firmly with a heavy grunt to begin the next round.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need you...&quot; Betty declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... it&#39;s starting,&quot; Huck said as he looked down to her and watching Betty&#39;s transformation begin.<br />
<br />
It started with silver-gray hair/fur that began growing over her body. It wasn&#39;t super long and nowhere near as long as his brown and black fur in his weredog form. The most telling thing, though was that as Betty&#39;s fur began to grow longer it began to curl a bit at its ends.  She reached up and marveled at her newly grown fur until she could get her hands onto Huck&#39;s shoulders, feeling his longer straight fur grow out as well and use that for leverage to keep thrusting against him. Huck simply replied in kind as he thrust back against hers, moving to complete her transformation, and he could already feel the canine knot developing at the base of his penis and straining against Betty&#39;s vaginal opening.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s happening!&quot; Betty said happily as she looked to her furry arms with the curled fur, though it wasn&#39;t to oversized. It didn&#39;t match her hair in terms of color, but then that part really didn&#39;t care. Not every were&#39;s fursona matched their hair color, and she supposed she would be no different, she merely kept at it, thrusting her hips forward and get Huck&#39;s knot into her. She also happily smiled to herself as she saw Huck&#39;s fur grow out, dark brown around the head and going to his hair. A more blackish muzzle with grayish-brown neck and chest, black on his back and shoulders with tan brown arms and legs. He looked cute, and regardless of his wish to look strong and confident, she&#39;d always found his were form cute and loved it. And now she was gaining her own as she felt growing stubby claws dig into Huck&#39;s fur. &quot;Do you... see... my... adorable... husband... it&#39;s happening!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only you can call me adorable,&quot; Huck answered as he picked up his own pace, responding to Betty accelerating her own pace. He could se that her eyes had shifted to light brown shade that all weredogs had and that with a few cracking sounds, her face was starting to push forward into a canine muzzle and her nose a black triangle surrounded by the curly silver-gray fur. Huck also watched as her ears pushed out from the side of her head and hung down enough to look like the ears of most dogs that hung down from the top of their heads down toward the bottom of their heads. Though Betty&#39;s ears too were covered with longer curly fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I always will,&quot; Betty smiled as her pleasure levels increased, particularly as her breasts grew out a bit and blossomed into the generous E cups that all weredog females had. She&#39;d actually cum at least once since she&#39;d begun transforming and soon her moderately long narrow muzzle pushed out before her and toward Huck. With that she sat up and licked at Huck&#39;s shorter muzzle, earning a happy yip and with one last effort, Huck thrust forward and with a soft &quot;shcuck&quot; his knot penetrated her and his penis erupted again with a strong orgasm that left both weredogs happily howling together.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was wonderful, Huck,&quot; Betty said to him while feeling her tail laying flat against the sheets and wagging back and forth underneath her, &quot;and check me out... I&#39;m a Poodle!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And given these beautiful biceps... my guess would be the Standard Poodle... not a Miniature or a Toy,&quot; Huck said to her and licked at Betty&#39;s muzzle while stroking her right arm with a paw, &quot;because I wouldn&#39;t want to turn you into something you&#39;re not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something I&#39;m not?&quot; Betty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something to be put on a pedestal,&quot; Huck answered, &quot;you&#39;ve been my secretary since I took over from my dad... and with Jenkins Construction that&#39;s been more than taking down orders and numbers and scheduling meetings. Shoot, dad even agreed that the company have a company cell line so that you could come and help with some projects... particularly when we were short staffed or the project was big. You know... the type of woman who&#39;s only worried about her hair or make-up... and really only fit for being a runway model. But you&#39;re you. Real. Strong... just as good with a hammer and screwdriver as I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I owe more to my father,&quot; Betty answered, &quot;he was the one who got me interested in woodworking... but my family&#39;s been part of Moon Lake for quite awhile. I have some distant relatives that are weres, many of which are still alive and some still live in Moon Lake. They&#39;ve been busy with their lives, but they&#39;ve been friendly. And there is a line that goes back through my mom and dad that go back a few generations... a family moved in and either had Human children, or a teenager in the family joined were society and let the parents stay normals. They then had more children in Moon Lake and they never left... So, I&#39;ve grown up with a lot of the stuff that&#39;s gone around with weres and were-biology, even if it wasn&#39;t a part of me until now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Huck nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So if we&#39;re to go purely scientifically... by the &quot;were that bit you&quot; theory, I should be a Pomeranian, like you,&quot; Betty told him pointedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is proof that you aren&#39;t a toy... wrapped up to be worshiped or treated as though you were weak,&quot; Huck told her and held her close as he rolled onto his side, though with his knot still inside Betty they were tied for the moment, &quot;but you aren&#39;t. You&#39;re strong. You&#39;re smart... And while neither of us either saw or were brave enough to be open with each other... that doesn&#39;t change the wonderful things that have made you my best friend over the years. And I&#39;d hate to have made you feel I was unworthy of you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Huck looked away for a moment, his own feelings at failing to notice that Betty might have ever wanted more than friendship and some of his own insecurities at his fursona being based on a Pomeranian sitting there for all to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were never unworthy of me,&quot; Betty said to him, &quot;you&#39;ve been exciting, energetic, and generally friendly... I&#39;ve always loved that about you. Which aren&#39;t necessarily bad things, even if the match the Pomeranian&#39;s breed temperament... Particularly when you essentially &quot;bark&quot; when someone teases you on it. You know they&#39;re messing with you and you &quot;bark&quot; anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty then held up one paw-like hand to lift Huck&#39;s muzzle up so that he looked to her directly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wouldn&#39;t matter what your fursona was based on,&quot; Betty told him, &quot;You&#39;ll always be worthy of me. Never doubt that. And in the end... you are still just as strong as any other weredog. The fact that you&#39;re a Pomeranian Weredog doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t be as strong as a Saint Bernard Weredog,&quot; Huck pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but that difference isn&#39;t going to be by that much,&quot; Betty insisted, &quot;and I&#39;d think your fursona makes you better looking. You&#39;re not tripping over anything and you know what you&#39;re doing. Which again... is why your fursona isn&#39;t what makes you worthy. It&#39;s WHO you are as a person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Mrs. Jenkins,&quot; Huck managed a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Betty smiled, &quot;Let&#39;s just not make this a regular occasion okay? No moping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Huck answered, &quot;I guess... I&#39;ll just have to content my self with playing with these...&quot;<br />
<br />
He then reached forward to softly caress Betty&#39;s enlarged bosom, earning a short bark from her as the two of them prepared for round three...</p>
