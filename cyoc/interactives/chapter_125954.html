<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The one thing Wayne always said that got Matt going: that he was “hung like a horse.” His interests in animals and transformation, mixed with Wayne’s seemingly related compliments, were all he needed to begin a passionate session.<br />
<br />
Was he really <i>that</i> hung? Probably not, Matt thought. He was a modest 6 or 7 out of a possible 10. His experience dating other dudes wasn’t long enough to know how he fared. Regardless, he loved the compliment. Who wouldn’t?<br />
<br />
So, the moment came: Matt had a world of choices at his hands with this device, but upon seeing a horse-themed package, he was immediately reminded of the little saying. He selected the package, and squirmed with excitement when individual body parts could be selected for focused transformation. The list of parameters available were endless - and there were hundreds of other species to choose from, if he so wished. He could make the compliment a reality, and surprise his boyfriend with a great night of fun.<br />
<br />
Multiple parts could be chosen at once, so on the uploaded model of his body, he selected his cock and balls. He… he could select more, though… a man with a horse head, or a horse tail… now that would be a real “stallion” of a man. Uggh, that would be so hot! <br />
<br />
… for him. This was his first time using this thing, and this was for Wayne. He could do those later; he needed to confirm that everything worked!<br />
<br />
So let’s get this party started, he thought to himself. Once the body parts were selected, the package requested a Transformation Period time, a Morph Period time, and a Reality Modification rating. He could enter a period of time in minutes, hours, or days, with a limit of 365 days. As for Reality Modification… he remembered having read something about that phrase in those “online tales.” If he recalled correctly, it could cause a lot of trouble if you set it wrong. Matt could choose anywhere from 0 to 100, but he had no idea what the numbers meant. The particulars of the pre-installed packages were beyond the scope of what the Chronivac provided direction for. <br />
<br />
This could be dangerous. But if anything went wrong, he would not save, and within the hour, everything would revert back to normal. So he set Reality Modification for 50% - playing it safe, right in the middle.<br />
<br />
He was pleased enough with the settings, so he clicked Next. Expecting another screen to pop up, he was surprised when it launched right into the transformation! He immediately crawled off his chair and shed his pants. His cock, still hard at probably 7 or so inches, twitched on its own accord. Matt immediately noticed ebbs and flows; it was going in and out of control. The feelings were slightly different. As the seconds went by, a certain buzzy feeling overtook his groin, and the cock slowly began to grow… right in front of his eyes! Yes!! And not only that: the color. It was turning darker; the tip was flaring out, reshaping, molding and widening.<br />
<br />
The flows of energy increased. It wasn’t all focused on his lengthening dick, but also on his ballsack. Matt leaned against the corner of the desk and the wall, and cupped his hand around the base of the shaft, feeling the rougher and looser skin move around, weaken, stiffen, and react. Every view and thought was devotion, emotion, and pure ecstasy. His shaft was at least… at LEAST… a foot long. He winced his eyes and moaned inwardly as a familiar feeling began to rise.<br />
<br />
It was a fever dream. There’s no way he could hold back. He unloaded on the floor of his room, first in spurts, and then little dribbles. Yet the transformation continued, and by the feel of it, the challenge would be maintaining control. Some minutes later he woke up from his mind-dream... he was holding up his 17-inch tube of a horse cock from its own weight with one hand, and groping his very equine balls with the other. Now each ball took up the entire palm of his hand, was covered in light, fuzzy hairs, and hung low - about halfway down his thighs.<br />
<br />
Then, out of nowhere, there was a brilliant flash of light that came from his computer - it only lasted hardly even a second - and immediately he felt the flows of transformation subsiding. <br />
<br />
Was it over? He pushed himself up from the wall and took a few steps, letting go of his cock, understanding the feeling and weight of his massive genitals by letting them dangle down. <br />
<br />
Wow. This really <i>did</i> just happen. It’s so real… so amazing… so goddamned <i>big</i>!<br />
<br />
Like, yes, he knew he’d be large. But this was next-level. It didn’t make him feel stronger, but he kinda felt more like a “man”. They were just as sensitive and reactive, too, putting him in complete overdrive mode.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac let him know that the transformation had completed successfully, and a small window appeared on screen, allowing him to save the change with a reminder that he had one hour to click the button. <br />
<br />
But he couldn’t stay focused on the program, he really couldn’t. His “new” body parts were surging again; they called for attention; it wanted more action. It swung to and fro, rubbing against the inside of his thighs and waving around in the air freely. The pouch - er, the sheath he now had - it had been settling into it, but now was growing back out for Round 2 of infinity. <br />
<br />
And so he rubbed. He fell back into his bed and just let the good feeling take over. Thirty minutes went by, and many gleeful moments later, he sat up from his bed. Geez… the sheets were now soaked in his juices - and he really needed to take a shower. Yeah; he could get cleaned up, give Wayne a call, and invite him over for the night. Maybe he’d even want in on the fun!<br />
<br />
But first... he couldn’t forget. The Chronivac reminded him with a subtle blink; he needed to save the change. Well… this was amazing! He was so pleased, just like the program had promised, so he walked over and clicked the button. <br />
<br />
FLASH! ... This time, the light hurt his eyes, and he rubbed them furiously. Why was it doing that, and was that normal? <br />
<br />
Well, whatever. Matt looked down at his meaty equine cock. He was too happy to care! He had plenty of stuff he wanted to try, and a certain man in his life beckoned for his attention…</p>
