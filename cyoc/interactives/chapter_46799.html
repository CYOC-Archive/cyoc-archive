<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim ran until she was out of the park and then down the street for a block before the pain in her bare feet and the soreness from her bouncing breasts made her stop.<br />
<br />
Breathless, she leaned against a wall. The fear that drove her out of the park had started to subside but was quickly replaced by worry. What was she going to do now?<br />
<br />
She looked down at her voluptuous female body. Most of her front was obscured by her giant boobs, but she could feel her clothes stretched tightly around her curves. She tried her adjust her underwear to loosen the wedgie it was giving her, but only managed to draw stares from passersby.<br />
<br />
And, boy, did they stare. Every man or boy that passed her couldn't help but peek at her boobs, and the women all gave her slightly disapproving looks as they looked her ridiculously tight outfit over. All of it made her feel more uncomfortable than any wedgie could.<br />
<br />
Tim felt panicked now. She had to get out of there. She had to find some clothes to cover her up at least.<br />
<br />
She started walking and immediately felt her unsupported breasts bouncing out of control. She felt her hips sway with her new female gait. She even noticed her long hair blowing in the wind. It all felt so alien and wrong. And, of course, it was wrong. She wasn't supposed to be a smoking hot woman. She was supposed to be a boy.<br />
<br />
As she passed a storefront window, she finally caught a look at her whole body in the reflection. Her jaw dropped. She was gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous in every way. That she was dressed in a 13-year-old boy's clothes only helped to accentuate her assets. Her huge tits tented her jersey, her wide hips stretched her shorts tight around her ass, her beautiful face stared back, amazed... she was a dream... a wet dream.<br />
<br />
Maybe this was a dream, Tim hoped. But, she had never had a dream as real as this. And, anyway, this was more of a nightmare. As hot as she was, Tim would have much rather been with this woman she'd become than actually been her.<br />
<br />
She started walking again, if only to escape the reflection. But, where was she going? Would she try to go home? Would she hide out somewhere else?<br />
<br />
Lost in thought, she walked right into something solid and fell over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; she heard a man say as he caught her by the arm mid-fall. &quot;I'm so sorry. Are you alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim looked up at him. He was a strong looking man, probably in his mid-20s. And, Tim realized with a bit of unease, he had a very cute face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, I'm... fine,&quot; she said. Was she blushing?<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, good. I guess we both need to watch where we are going more, right?&quot; he laughed as he stood her upright and let her arm go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Tim and smiled at him weakly. What was this feeling inside of her? Was she... attracted to him?<br />
<br />
The man stood there a moment, apparently unsure about what to say next. Tim found herself anxiously anticipating his next words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I better get going,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm meeting my girlfriend for lunch... so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes... well...&quot; Now, she was definitely blushing. &quot;Good luck!&quot; she said and quickly turned and walked away. She made sure she didn't turn around to peek at his ass as he walked off the other way even though she felt a strong urge to do so.<br />
<br />
What was going on with her? She had never been attracted to men before as a boy. What was this feeling in her? Was it because she had become a woman? She shook her head, trying to clear out the thoughts about that man and his nice, muscled body.<br />
<br />
Focus! she thought to herself. I have to find a way to fix this situation.<br />
<br />
She walked and found herself unconsciously checking out the guys as they passed her, looking them over as they looked her over. She started to imagine them naked. She started to imagine them naked with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; she shouted aloud and covered her eyes. This was too much! She had to get out of public, now. Two options came to mind. One, she was a few blocks from home. She might be able to sneak in and hide. Two, her friend, Mark, lived only a block away. She could hide out with him... together... alone.<br />
<br />
Hmm... what to do?</p>
