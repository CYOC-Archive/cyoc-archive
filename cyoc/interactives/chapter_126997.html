<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The goddess of the city, Gabby, started running back to the school. “I need to find my danny!” Gabby yelled. Her monster tits and ass flailing with ever step. &#39;they must be at least L cup by now, well to me at least&#39; Gabby thought to herself. However, back at the school, Tod saw the red haired giantess sprinting to the school. “Oh fuck.” Tod said to nobody in particular. frantically getting his device he starts shrinking Gabby. She started shrinking, but her monster hips, ass and boobs weren&#39;t shrinking as much as the rest of her body was. By the time the not so large giantess reached the school she was about 20 ft tall and had breasts that looked like O cups on her with an butt and shapely hips to match. Before Tod could shrink her anymore, the tiny giantess tore into the school and out of Tods sight. &#39;what could she be possibly be doing back here?&#39; Tod questioned to himself. “Might as well watch.” Tod saying out loud this time. Gabby was less casual about the situation. She was running through all the corridors, leaving imprints on the floor where she stepped. Her “in larged parts” causing damage as well. Walls were cracked and had large holes in them. Doors, however, didn&#39;t have the same privilege. Any doors she could find were thrown off the door frame, before the same door frames were obliterated because they were to small for the powerful woman. There was only was one thought in her lust painted mind &#39;Must. Find. Him&#39;. Every door broken down that didnt have her special someone increased her sexual furry. She only ever dated her Danny casualy because he said he didn&#39;t want a serious relationship. They eventually stopped dating but she still loved him as a boyfriend. The whole non serious thing made her stop the dating. He probably was upset, but still hung out wuth her as a friend. Then she remembered someone. Megan. Megan met Dan at thier robotics class, and shortly became friends with him after being asigned his partner, which happened after the dating stopped. Then suddenly a new thought came in, &#39;what if she&#39;s fucking him now?&#39; Gabby and Megan were some what simular, which is probably why Dan likes them both alot. Both were always shy, but Gabby was less so. The both were kind, smart, loving and had a few common interests. Megan was always smarter though, being a top competitor in the robotics class along with Dan. Gabby liked drawing and art and was renowned in her art class for being able to draw in any style and still have it look nice, while Dan always needed what he was drawing in frond of him. Megan had always loved jokes, but was strangely didn&#39;t find stuff like slapstic funny at all. Gabby was not as interested in humor but still had a laugh. Megan never liked hurting things, when Gabby would always say she would fight anyone who tried to take anything important to her. Physicaly they were opposites. Gabby always had the larger hips and butt, with Megan having some nice c cup breasts. Gabby always had a pinker, more flushed tone on her skin when Megan had a pail look, which made her black hair and her deep blue eyes show more against Gabbys brunette color with her brown eyes. &quot;I CANNOT LOSE HIM!&quot; Gabby roared, and with new found strength doubled her speed, and then almost instantly found him in the robotics class. &quot;Yes. I found you my little Danny.&quot; Gabby said in a lust ridden voice, before pulling him into the very large corridors. &quot;G-g-Gabriel?&quot; Dan stuttered, obviously overwelmed with a hurricane of emotions. &quot;Yes Danny, its me. Do you like my resent new and improved bod? Its so sensitive and big, you always said sex before sex before marrige, so why not finish up our relationship, hmm?&quot; Gabby spoke back in a smooth and powerful voice. At the end of that hallway, Tod came walking over, out of breath. &#39;I hate how big this school is, I&#39;m so tired that my legs burn. At least the show looks like its about to begin.&#39; Tod thought to himself, and using the device to make him invisible so he wont be noticed. &quot;P-p-p-please Gabby, this isn&#39;t you, I know who you are, we can marry after some dating, please.&quot; Danny said in a soft voice, &#39;holy fuck, how did this happen? I saw her go to the library and this happens? Shes so hot though, maybe this will be fun. No! She&#39;ll crush me! Not unless if I tell her to be careful. No! Stop it! She&#39;s already lost in lust, she&#39;ll kill me!&#39; Dan started having an internal war with himself. &quot;Ooooh, I don&#39;t know... Your so cute and fuckable right now, stuck between my not so childish breasts. Lets start, here!&quot; Gabby Practically tore off Dans pants, and almost along with his torso. &quot;Oh my Danny! I always knew you were big, but now it looks a little to small for me.&quot; Gabby giggles at Dans 7.6 incher, making her megaton breasts and ass jiggle along. &#39;Not something I can&#39;t fix.&#39; Tod thought &#39;but come to think of it, what should I do?&quot;</p>
