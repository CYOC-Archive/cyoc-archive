-Outside-<br />
<br />
Seth had dialled the number about 5 times now…she couldn’t reach Erick, it was just a fact now. She sat in the quiet diner, spiralling her straw in her favourite milkshake. She was nervous, Erick wasn’t usually off his phone for this long, it was like he had some sort of addiction to it. <br />
<br />
She felt scared, but she wasn’t alone, her friend Maisy was sitting opposite to her, also trying to dial Erick and getting some response. <br />
“What is wrong with him!” Maisy said suddenly. Seth looked up and smiled “Maybe he thinks it’s funny”. Maisy smirked “If he was planning to prank us, he would try a lot harder than this…It just doesn’t seem right” Maisy’s fake smile seem to cease now there was a depressing mood filling the air.<br />
<br />
“Still…At least he’s got Ryan with him” Seth said jokingly. They both adored Ryan in this transfixed way. But this only made Maisy even more worried.<br />
<br />
“Look…I think we should just go to the mansion just to see if they are okay…” said Maisy with a weaker voice. Seth took the opportunity to hold her hand…” I’m sure they are okay” Maisy’s face seemed even paler from this remark.<br />
<br />
Seth sighed heavily “Fine…we’ll finish our drinks and then head out…I’m not wasting a good milkshake”. She sucked on her straw, and Seth heard Maisy laugh for the first time in a while. Seth smiled happily and they both enjoyed a nice night meal.<br />
<br />
-Mike-<br />
<br />
Mike walked towards Erick’s room, hoping to find an answer…He was furious…was this some joke which Erick decided not to share. This was now affecting Sei…and it was making Mike angrier as the minutes tanked by. It was dark…darker than usual, it seemed like the darkness had consumed all the light.<br />
<br />
Mike didn’t tell Ryan everything...when Ryan remarked about the sound being Sei’s scream, Mike knew he was lying. Because the scream Mike heard was not his girlfriends. It was deep and bellowing, like some tortured creature. It had sent Mike through a loop, remembering his time as a veteran, Mike thought he could help the creature. Mike was wrong. <br />
<br />
Mike thought he was going to Erick’s room, but then he realised, he wasn’t descending he was going up. He looked out the window, he was now on the 3rd story, even though Erick’s room was on the first. He decided to go down the staircase, Mike was confused.<br />
<br />
But he ended going up again, It was strange. Was Mike in some maze, why was he going up. Mike decided to accept this path and continued upwards. He was now in some sort of attic, there were dozens of cobwebs and broken machinery on shelfs. However, the most defining feature was some sort of nest…at the back of the room. It was large and covered in cobwebs. Mike walked slowly towards it more scared than ever now and looked down. He saw something glint in the attic light. He dropped down to examine it, it was some sort of gun, covered in the nest’s cobwebs. <br />
<br />
Mike reluctantly pulled it out of the nest, the nest ripped open and revealed hundreds of spiders. Mike screamed and crawled backwards. However, they didn’t crawl over him, they went backwards onto the wall, climbing it. Mike didn’t realise how tall the attic was and this was a fatal mistake. With the gun now in his hand, he looked up, There it was. It most of been the source of the noise.<br />
<br />
It was some sort of giant spider, with long hairy legs. The scales rupturing across it. The hundreds of beady eyes all staring death mark’d at Mike. <br />
<br />
Mike screamed…and ran for the exit, the spider jumped down on top of Mike, throwing him to the ground. He kicked the spider up off him, and it went spiralling into the nest, releasing more baby spiders. Mike stood up in absolute fear and aimed the gun at this creature. He hesitated for a moment but then suddenly fired at it. The creature screamed in anguish and Mike felt kind of bad for it. But with this distraction, Mike climbed out the attic, and away from the immediate danger.<br />
<br />
-Erick-<br />
<br />
Erick was horrified by what he saw…it was a heart. A beating heart, inside of the piano. It was pulsing hard. Erick had the strange theory that the piano was alive. But in the moment of fear, Erick sprinted for the front door. He grabbed the handle and tried to open the door, but it wouldn’t open, the door was locked tight.<br />
<br />
Erick scared, head a strange moaning behind him which seemed to increase to a whimpering. Erick turned around slowly facing the piano again, the Piano was gone. Now there was one thing there. Erick described it as some sort of monster, which it obviously was. It had long pointed legs, elongated arms and a thin chest. Its face was black, with piercing white eyes, it had white marks across it, like any piano would. <br />
<br />
Erick looked at it startled, but he was finally recognising something, the low breathing and the whimpering. The voice was identical to his friend…Sei.<br />
<br />
“S-s..sei is that you?” Erick accused slowly. The creature limbered closer to Erick, Erick walked slightly backwards. The creature was now completely in the light and Erick saw in horror, Sei’s now distorted face stretched across this Creatures one, it was bare naked and stared blankly at Erick.<br />
<br />
Erick, slowly paced to the left. He had to escape the fate Sei was given. Sei’s speed seemed to increase towards him. Erick with a dash of panic, ran towards the stairs, he didn’t look back to if Sei was following him, so he just kept running down the corridor and back to his room.<br />
<br />
By luck he ended up in the right place. He bashed upon the door and to his surprise saw Mike standing there.<br />
<br />
-Jonathan-<br />
<br />
He didn’t know how much time had gone by, He was dazed and hanging. He felt painful burns on his arms and legs. He was strapped to some sort of cell, and he couldn’t escape. He tried to pull the restraints off, but he had no prevail. He called out for help but that had no prevail. He was stuck…there was no way out.<br />
<br />
Jonathan looked around, he saw he was still in the lower basement, the shackle he had seen before was gone, and the blood had been cleaned up…in fact strangely enough…the room looked cleaner than it did before, the overturned shelf he saw before was now upright, with new jars similar to the ones which smashed.<br />
<br />
It confused Jonathan, but he wanted to escape the reality.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he heard voices from the stairs…Jonathan couldn’t make them out, but it sounded like two people arguing. The arguing silenced, and then Jonathan heard two pairs of feet walking down the stairs.<br />
<br />
The first person to appear was this man who wore a bleached lab coat, He had grey hair in shapes you would see in horror movies. However, his clothes were stripped with blood, speckles of it all over the place. Jonathan screamed…but his voice was muffled by the clog in his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Shush now…we haven’t started yet…” said the other person, the next person who walked down the stairs was a beautiful woman, she wasn’t wearing a lab coat, but a ragged shirt and tank jeans. Her hair was blonde and flowed in a elegant way. <br />
<br />
Jonathan felt some comfort, perhaps nothing bad was going to happen. “Don’t worry…now Jon-ee-than” The man said…he had a thick Russian accent which seemed weird for a man of his stature. “We aren’t going to hurt ya” he said. <br />
<br />
Jonathan was confused now…why was he tied up. “Then why am I tied up then?” Jonathan said. The man looked as confused as he was. “Don’t you know?” he said accusingly.<br />
<br />
Jonathan looked at him blankly “Know what?”. The woman spoke next which surprised Jonathan “You came here…to take part in the test program…”. Jonathan was now even more confused. “What test programme…what are you talking about?” <br />
The man stood in front of the woman, blocking Jonathans entire view of her “The Test programme you signed up for?” Jonathan struggled in his shackles “I…didn’t sign up for any test programme”.  The man startled walked backwards. He looked towards the woman and talked to her discretely.<br />
<br />
Jonathan could now make out a few words “He…doesn’t know?” “Of course, he does…” “I..m…not sure” “What…” “We should just release him” “Wait…n-no”.<br />
<br />
The man turned back around towards Jonathan and comfortably says “Sorry this has been a big misunderstanding…we thought you wanted this…well if you don’t…we’ll just let you go”. The man made his way towards Jonathans restraints to take them off, but then suddenly he screamed in pain. Jonathan saw in horror, two blunted knifes pierce through the doctor, they ruptured his skin and petruded large amounts of blood everywhere. He fell to the ground dead.<br />
<br />
Jonathan looked up and saw the murderer. The woman standing there so normal before…just murdered someone. “Well…I’m sorry doctor but we didn’t agree to let him go”. The woman walked towards the chemistry table in the back of the room.<br />
<br />
Jonathan now fearful for his life questioned the woman “W-why did you do that…” The woman seemed to ignore him, which made Jonathan even more scared…” What are you going to do to me?”.<br />
<br />
The woman now turning around from her table, looked up and smiled “I’m going to cure you”. In her hand a massive needle, she walked slowly towards Jonathan. “Wait…n-no don’t do this…I don’t need to be cured I’m fine. Please…I have a brother…I have a family don’t do this”.<br />
<br />
The woman was now ignoring him completely pacing towards him. Jonathan struggled screaming out help me. But there was no answer…no help. Jonathan was stuck…there was no way out.<br />
<br />
-Ryan-<br />
<br />
Ryan had grabbed the map of the building and was now exploring the vast corridors, trying to find Jonathan. He wasn’t going to look for Sei…His brother was more important right now. What seemed like a nice place before was now a hell hole. He had to get Jonathan and leave.<br />
<br />
That was when Ryan heard it. Jonathans voice…screaming “HELP ME”. Ryan now fuelled by his only purpose to find his brother. Ran down the stairs , The basement was completely black, there was no hopeful light reflected into the compounds of the room, It was just an intimate darkness. Ryan blindly looked for a light switch, he found something which resembled a light switch and knocked it down, light filled the room. <br />
<br />
Ryan saw in awe, a completely totalled basement. The shelves had been ripped from the nails on the wall, glasses once residing on there, shattered In a abundance of pieces. Strange chemicals which seemed to bleach the ground. Ryan knew some struggle took place here, and he hoped it wasn’t Jonathans. <br />
<br />
He searched the room but found nothing. No kidnapper, no Jonathan, nothing. It was completely empty. Ryan hit a shelf in frustration, it made a loud ringing noise which filled the room. Ryan sweared quietly to himself, that noise was louder than expected. And then he heard it, a low groaning from before coming from the top of the stairs. Ryan bolted to hide somewhere, he found a sensible place in the corner of the room, where two shelves made good camouflage for him, he crawled behind them and listened.<br />
<br />
There were loud noises on the stairs, something big was walking down them. Ryan then knew what the monster was. It was the monster from before. The one outside his room. The creature stopped at the bottom of the stairs, and Ryan could hear it breath heavily, drying to catch the scent of the hider. Ryan held his breath hoping to staunch his smell. His heart was beating hard…he lay there dormant.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Ryan heard a loud roar, but before Ryan could react he was picked up with powerful strength of the ground. Ryan struggled but he could escape. The monster had found him. Ryan now saw his pursuer in the face. It was a huge behemoth, covered with hair and a muscular figure. Ryan couldn’t get out, the beast roared again and scratched him with his claws. Ryan screamed in pain, feeling the wound filling with blood. <br />
<br />
However suddenly Ryan was thrown to the floor, and the creature left the room. Ryan was confused but in immense pain. He lay against the wall. Why did the monster let him go? What did he do to Ryan? Ryan looked at his wound, it was bleeding immensely. If he didn’t sort it out soon he would die from blood loss.</p>
