<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a cloudy day many months after she&#39;d met the other dragons. Frost was flying in the mountains, looking for a new village to terrorize. Her &quot;servants&quot; hadn&#39;t visited her for quite some time, but she didn&#39;t really mind. That just meant they were gathering an enormous tribute to her.<br />
<br />
Her search was unfruitful, and after a few hours she decided to turn back. She was soon planning to fly out to meet other dragons in the &quot;community&quot; her servants had told her about, and she needed to look her best for her queenly debut. She was already imagining their bewildered faces as she presented herself and they bowed down. She could hardly contain her glee.<br />
<br />
Her instincts flared up as she got back to her mountain, but she suppressed them. So what if a few fresh footprints were near the lair? So what if some carts were parked by the mountain? Some adventurers were here again, foolishly attempting to defeat her. Soon enough she would show them just how wrong they were.<br />
<br />
She landed at the mouth of her lair, prepared to eat the intruders alive.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when all hell broke loose, as dozens of humans burst out of their hiding place in the ruins, emerging from beneath the snow and lunged at her. She swung her tail and managed to knock a few off, but the others reached her and plunged blades to her hide. To her surprise, they actually penetrated, and she cried out as she felt pain for the first time in months.<br />
<br />
She scrambled back, her legs and hind bleeding as the humans regrouped, preparing for another assault. She retreated to her lair, intending to force them to fight on her own grounds. That proved to be a mistake, as her back was soon peppered with rocks, rubble and huge spears that tore through her scales. She turned her attention to the lair and saw that the humans, rats that they are, had snuck in and somehow managed to construct catapults and trebuchet inside! They were loading up for another volley, and she lunged to destroy the machines, but when her attention was divided the ground team struck again, tearing her legs with their apparently enchanted weapons. <br />
<br />
&quot;ROOAAARR!!!&quot; she cried out, trying to fight the two fronts at once, but it was hopeless. There were too many of them, and she was taking too many hits. She burst out through the ground team, managing to trample the few that hadn&#39;t dodged out of the way, and scampered to her ice caves. She could confuse them there, get them lost and pick the humans one at a time.<br />
<br />
FWOOOMM<br />
<br />
An enormous burst of flame engulfed her as she reached the mouth of the caves, the humans having rigged the entrance with firebombs. She cried out as the fire seemed to melt through her scales, scorching her flesh. She cried. Actually cried, big, fat dragon tears swelling down her cheecks as she knew she had to run. She&#39;d been played. Totally played. She took a running start and spear her wings, wincing as the wounds in them flared up.<br />
<br />
Miraculously, she managed to glide away, but not without taking another hit from a ballista to her wing. She sobbed as she heard the victorious cries of the human from behind her, celebrating their victory over an evil dragon.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t want to admit it, but she needed help. Her wounds were slowing her down, and reinforcements would be required to take back her lair. So she sought out her servants.<br />
<br />
There they were, resting at the top of the mountain she&#39;d first met them at. She sighed in relief at the sight of them.<br />
<br />
Her landing wasn&#39;t graceful, and her wings buckled as she crashed on the mountaintop. The other dragons looked on in worry as Frost scrambled to her feet, panting and wincing in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;My subjects! Filthy humans have wounded me and taken over my lair! I require your immediate assistance to take it back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Whitefang, Blizzard and Flurry looked at Frost, then each other... and went right back to relaxing.<br />
<br />
Frost was shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t you hear me? I need you to kill every last human! Right now!&quot; she cried out, her voice cracking a bit. Some of her silvery blood stained the white snow as she struggled to stand on her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you listen, runt.&quot; Whitefang growled. He stood up to his full height and walked over to Frost, who unconsciously took a few steps back as the older dragon dominated her vision. She suddenly felt much, MUCH smaller than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;We humored you. We felt pity for you, considering you&#39;re an orphan. But despite out gracious efforts to help, you&#39;ve done nothing but boss us around. So no. We are not your subjects. You are not a queen, and you never will be. If you want help, you ask for it, like everyone else. But don&#39;t you dare try to tell us what to do, shortie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frost was absolutely stunned as the dragons turned her down. She didn&#39;t know what to say.<br />
Her loyal subjects... were traitors.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I won&#39;t forget this! I&#39;ll come back once I&#39;ve retaken my lair, and I&#39;ll put you all in your place!&quot; she declared, holding back her tears. The other dragons looked like they were about to say something, but she didn&#39;t stick around to listen as she scrambled off the edge and leapt off, spreading her wings. She cried out in pain as her injuries flared when her wings took on her wight, but she powered through. She wouldn&#39;t let pain stop her vengeance. She was furious. And something had to be done.</p>
