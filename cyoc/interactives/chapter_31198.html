<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>You walk up to your room, now smiling and amused by the claw mark embedded into the wooden door. You remember how you were afraid of what that could have been from, how the thought of never being able to leave this land now that you were affected by the curse, but now that you look back on things, it seems to be the best thing that has happened to you in a while. You walk into the room, one hand clutching the book tightly to your chest, the other one free to move about. The book seemed to hold the key to your freedom as well as the spreading of the curse, even though you didn't get too far within it. You place the book down on the nightstand next to the bed as you walk toward your closet to get a robe. Undressing slowly, you marvel at how much better your body looked. There was no more fat on your body, except a slight amount making your pecs and biceps bigger and soft, unlike the rock hard muscles found on bodybuilders. Your muscles weren't huge by any meaning of the word, but they did look slightly bigger. Removing your pants, you see that even your package was slightly enhanced, just a bit longer and definitely wider than you had previously noticed. It was a shame that you would be covering it up so soon, but you knew that the robe probably wouldn't stay on for too much longer.</br>
<br>Just as you tied the two ropes around your body and in a loose knot, there was a knock on the door. Taking in a huge whiff of the air once more, ensuring that it was the masseuse. The smell was stronger this time, smelling of cologne, deodorant and a hint of musk. You smile wryly before you open the door and wipe it off your face as you revealed yourself to him and him to you. You wanted to smile widely, knowing that Mark had done well in his search. He was six feet three inches tall, wearing a white, three button polo with the massage parlor's insignia on the upper right corner of his chest. You could see that he either shaved his chest or he was naturally smooth as you could see the beginnings of his chest as the three buttons were not buttoned. His arms were nicely muscled, slightly dusted with hair, moving from elbow down to his wrist and slightly over his hands. He was also wearing a pair of black Adidas wind pants, and plain white sneakers. Moving back up to the northern regions of his body, you see that he had nice blue eyes, like a deep blue velvet, with nicely shaped eyebrows. Hair short, dark brown with the tips bleached and spiked, just like you liked on guys. His jaw line was hard and chiseled, clean shaven too, but looked as if it might have been a while since his last shave as stubble began poking through the pores of his face. His lips were nicely rounded, soft and supple, more than likely very sensuous to kiss.</br>
<br>"Hello there sir! It is my understanding that you wished to have a massage?"</br>
<br>You had to keep yourself composed as he spoke with his deep and sexy voice. "Yes, that is correct! Please, come on in."</br>
<br>As he walked into the room, he took a second to survey the interior, then walked over to the same nightstand where you placed your book. Curious in what he was going to do, you close the door behind you while you watch his movements. The masseuse touches the cover of the book, feeling the texture of it and you walk up to him silently. He stops, knowing it wasn't something that belonged to him and restrained himself from advancing along in his curiosity. As he turned around, he jumped slightly, startled to see you standing right behind him without making a sound. You both chuckle and you eye the book, then at his hand.</br>
<br>"I see you have an interest or a liking to my book there."</br>
<br>"Yes sir, I am very into antiques and older items. That book looks and felt very old. Do you know how old it is by chance?"</br>
<br>"No, I am sorry, but I don't. Quite honestly, I just acquired this property from a will my grandfather left for me, and me alone. This is actually going to be my very first night here. So, there are many things in this house I don't know about or the history of, quite yet anyway."</br>
<br>"Ok sir... I was just curious that is all. If you are ready for your massage, we can begin immediately."</br>
<br>"Yes I am ready... uh what was your name?"</br>
<br>"My name is Jim and yours?"</br>
<br>"My name is David and it is a pleasure to have met you!"</br>
<br>"The pleasure is all mine David. Now as I do your massage, would you mind if I flip through the pages of that book there?"</br>
<br>As you let the robe fall to the floor and lay belly down on your bed, you can't help but to smile. Curious as to what would happen, you decide mentally to allow him, but he would have to hear you give him the permission.</br>
<br>"Yea, sure you can go ahead Jim. I like your ability to show your curiosity. The only thing is, I would like you to read aloud so I can hear the words. I haven't had a chance myself to read the book yet... so if you would do that for me, you can do what you want with the book."</br>
<br>"Oh thank you David! I will definitely read it aloud for us."</br>
<br>Placing his attention on you, while having one hand on the book cover, he opens the book and then applies massage oils to your smooth and bare back. Glancing over at the book, wanting to read it, but also needing to do his job, he placed both his hands on your body and began his work. As he kneads your various back muscles, you can sense that he wasn't really into massaging you and more into the book.</br>
<br>"Do you want to read the book first, or do you want to complete the massage?"</br>
<br>"Honestly, I would rather read the book right now, if that is ok David?"</br>
<br>"Yeah, sure but remember you have to read it aloud." You say with a smile on your face.</br>
<br>Not paying any attention to you, he places his attention back on the book as you sit up, completely exposed and virtually hairless. You watch as he intently flips the front and blank page to the next which was labeled <i>Introduction</i> and as he looked over the words, not really reading them, he looked at you with curiosity.</br>
<br>"Darn it, these words are all in latin and I failed that class back when I was still in college."</br>
<br>"That's ok Jim, why don't you try to read it anyway. I don't think it matters much if you know what it means... do you?"</br>
<br>"Nah... I guess it's not. Ok... here is what it says on the first page: <i>Unum Pacte De Lupus, Unum Vide Por Lupus, Unum Annum Por Pacte De Lupus, Metamorpo De Et Linde, Metamorpo Por Del Lupus.</i>"</br>
<br>You gaze at him for a moment, knowing he just read the curse for the land we were on. You begin to feel your face pushing out, your teeth elongating slightly and your tongue flattening slightly. You look at your body and notice there was silvery gray hairs that popped out and lightly covered your body. It was just the tips which made it look black, but you knew it wasn't. You look at him intently as he is just staring down at the words, obviously pondering their meaning. As you look at his face, you see that he had grown a five o' clock shadow from reading. As you let your eyes wander further, you notice that the hair on his arms was thicker and traveled up to mid bicep. You look at his fingers and notice that his hands were now rough and hard, instead of them being soft as they were a few moments ago. He then read the words aloud again, this time quicker as if to somehow get a better grasp and understanding. You notice that his hair definitely grew a bit more, making him a bit furry with a dark brown, one inch beard. You look over your body and notice your fur had definitely grown a bit more, your hands and feet changed into paws, complete with sharp black claws and black paw pads. You feel at your slight muzzle, taking note that it grew out more and your nose grew moist, black and leathery. As he was about to read the words again, you interrupt him.</br>
<br>"Hey Jim, why don't you keep reading further and we'll figure out the words in Latin."</br>
<br>He just nodded, not paying too much attention to your now gruff voice. He continues to read aloud and you watch as both your bodies were affected. His muscles grew slightly, noticing only from the tightness added to his shirt and pants. You look down at your own body and note that your cock and balls grew slightly, being longer and thicker, with a bigger mushroom head. Placing a paw finger at the tip of your cock, you wipe the free flowing precum and bring your finger to your maw. The taste and the flavor was invigorating and you knew you had to have more, not yours though, but HIS! As he continues to read, now what was in English, you feel your body revert back to your human form, only leaving your fangs intact. You stand up and walk over to him, looking him directly in his eyes that were now slightly yellowed. You smile, showing off your fangs which did not alarm him.</br>
<br>"Do you feel that in the air Jim? Do you feel the energy that surrounds us right now?"</br>
<br>"Yes David.. I can!" He says in a gruffer and deeper voice, tainted with lust.</br>
<br>"Do you like how you feel right now, do you like having the hair on your body, like a real man?"</br>
<br>"Yes David... I do! I have always shaved it off, feeling like it was disgusting, but now I love it. I am a man and I am proud to show off my man fur!"</br>
<br>"Good, now the last thing is very important. I want you as my mate, my partner in life and my companion. I have a gift for you if you want it."</br>
<br>"Oh yes, I would like that very much! Bestow upon me your gift!"</br>
<br>You smile wryly again, and moving down to his neck, you expose your fangs and puncture his flesh. Jim winces in pain, but relaxes quickly and you taste his iron filled blood flow over your ivory white fangs and coat your human tongue. You saliva increases and thickens, flowing into his veins. You release and look at him deeply, licking your teeth clean. Watching closely, you see the holes heal up almost instantly. His skin begins to itch slightly, his body increasing in heat. He began moaning as it was intense pleasure instead of pain. Jim pulls the polo over his head, revealing his huge and manly, huge and hairy pecs that were increasing in fur. He then unties his pants and let them fall to the floor, revealing his muscular thighs and calves, that was now equally as hairy as the rest of him. You look as his cock was filling with blood and a wet spot forming where the tip of his cock was. After stepping out of his wind pants, he takes his wolven paws and clawed fingers and places them under the tight fabric encasing his pelvis and cock. Pulling them down, he moans in pleasure of the releasing, his cock growing from being seven inches with a nice mushroom head and almost as thick as a pop can, to eight inches long and as thick as a pop can and a half. You drop to your knees as your change completed, your tail popping from your tail bone and lick you maw, hungrily for the sweet fluid. You stick your tongue out, catching the torrent of pre flowing, letting it pool on your tongue and overflow down into your throat. Swallowing quickly, you take a quick lick at the tip, he twitches in sensitive pleasure. Smiling inside, you watch as his body finishes it's transformation and as his tail popped out, he shot several thick loads of his hot werewolf cum into your open and awaiting maw.</br>
<br>Happy with the turn of events, he howls loudly as you stand before his dark brown, wolven body of glory. Your cock throbbing and leaking an equally copious amount of the sweet fluid. Knowing that you want to be serviced, he kneels before your cock and licks the length of your sensitive shaft, up to the perineum under the base of the mushroom head and continues to the tip. Then, unexpectedly, he engulfs your member, burying his maw all the way down your shaft to the base of it. As he pulled off, he sucked a bit harder and you blast your hot, copious torrents of cum down his throat. You howl out loudly, expressing your full release and freedom.</br>
<br>As you both begin to recover, your bodies shift back to their human forms. As you look at him, he retains the hair covered chest, with little fat around the muscles, but left in them to be soft. His arms, hands, legs and feet also remained hairy as well. His cock shrunk slightly, but that was ok with you, as it was big before the change and just heightened by it. His face remained chiseled with a full thick, dark brown beard. He smiles at you, thankful for making him like you and making him yours. You smile back, glad to have a partner that looked like him, not to mention having a great cock like he had, regardless of his form!</br>
<br>"So... now that that is taken care of... for the moment, what is next?"</br>
<br>"I am glad you asked! We will read through this book together and find how we might spread the gift, no longer referenced to as the curse, to more land so our kind may live outside of this estate, not to mention giving this gift to more of our brothers out there."</br></p>
