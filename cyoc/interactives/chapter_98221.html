<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The shop Awareness was a rather quaint shop in Moon Lake&#39;s downtown. It had a stone front with a well painted sign with various eyes painted on it and looking in various directions. After parking the car in a nearby parking lot, Martha made her way to the store and looked at it closely. She could see two viewing windows. One set had a series of male mannequins in various outfits, and one looked like it had a felt fox tail sticking out the back. The other viewing window had a series of female mannequins with one looking like it had a felt cat tail sticking out the back. Martha figured they were probably there to advertise the shops specialty in working with were anatomy and abilities with a cos-play type theme as a cover.<br />
<br />
She quietly walked in. The inside of the shop was far more modern than the exterior. While there was a central counter, the shop was effectively divided into two halves. One half was filled with various business suits, jeans, athletic shorts, pants that were made out of the same material as a wind-breaker jacket, and even a few tee shirts. She also noticed shelves along the far wall, which she figured had to have clothing that wasn&#39;t to be hung up in them. Along the back wall, Martha noticed what she guessed where fitting rooms. On the other side of a plaster wall that ran down the middle were woman&#39;s cut jeans, shorts, skirts, tee shirts, and dresses. Further back she could even see what looked like bras hanging up on other racks near another set of shelves. There were more dressing rooms on that side as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Awareness, where our aim is to provide every were the attire and comfort that our unique bodies need,&quot; came a voice her side, which Martha&#39;s nose detected to belong to wererat.<br />
<br />
Martha looked over to see a female clerk who was a little smaller than her and wore a black blazer that was stretched over a bosom that was slightly smaller than Martha&#39;s was now as a werecat. It was easily in the D range, and from what Martha remembered from the handbook she had looked at, wererats were the smallest of the were-beast species in Moon Lake. She also wore a pair of black pants that hung loosely from her hips and went down to ankles. Her feat were in rather comfortable looking footwear, but Martha couldn&#39;t tell what type of shoe they were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Martha spoke as she noticed the wererat&#39;s name tag which read: &quot;Kathy&quot; on it, &quot;Kathy. This is my first time here... and I kind of need some things that will fit the new me a bit better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve recently become a werecat?&quot; Kathy answered, with some level of nervousness in her voice, which surprised Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Martha nodded, &quot;and while my outerwear isn&#39;t too bad... it feels tight when I change, not to mention that I need to pull any skirt, pants, shorts, and definitely my panties down a bit to grow my tail... and my underwear does fit tight on me. I&#39;m not so big that I&#39;m breaking the seams... but it isn&#39;t necessarily comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t have any problem with things you buy here,&quot; Kathy promised, &quot;our garments are measured and sewn to fit our bodies and many of them can stretch and shift with them... though this will only work with those of us in the smaller range of were-beasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only with smaller werebeasts?&quot; Martha wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Werewolves, wereleopards, werelions, weretigers, werebears, werecattle, and werehorses grow too large in their animal forms for our clothing to fit... and their human forms are too small for clothing made for their animal side. It&#39;s why they often go naked when in their animal forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that Martha remembered the battle against Yvette. When Nate and Ben came down, they were both in wolf form and both of them were completely naked. She, William, and Frances had only ended up naked after Yvette had bit and clawed at them and effectively pulled their clothes off. Martha bet that when her eldest son and Ben changed that their clothes were pulled apart at the seems by their bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucky for me I&#39;m a werecat then,&quot; Martha smiled, &quot;all the woman&#39;s clothes are on this side?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha pointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Kathy answered, &quot;there is a measuring tape hanging near the fitting rooms should you have any question on your new size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Martha answered and made her way along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you need any help?&quot; Kathy asked, &quot;the only other customer who&#39;s in right now has her fiancee with her... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I suppose I could get a bit of help... just to see my present hip, waist, chest, and bust measurements,&quot; Martha answered, sounding curious about herself. Earlier in the day, her voice might have been rather playful and borderline flirtatious, but Martha had found that her libido was actually starting to decrease since lunch, a sign that her body was burning through her double dose of werecat. She would still have a higher libido than most humans and certainly more than she had felt as a human, and she was finding herself loving that part of being  a were. And even with her initial drive lowering to normal werecat levels, she was curious about her body. She knew she was bigger in all the right places to attract both the Twists and William, but she didn&#39;t know just how much bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let me be of brief help to you,&quot; Kathy offered, still sounding nervous, &quot;I can take your measurements and make things easier for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathy then lead Martha back toward the fitting rooms. There hanging on an exterior nail, Kathy picked up a roll of measuring tape that was rolled up around the nail. She then moved and opened the wooden door to the fitting room.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may go on in,&quot; Kathy instructed, &quot;You will need to strip down to your underwear to make sure the measurement is more accurate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded and once in the fitting room she began to remove her outer clothes, and set them on a set of that had been screwed to the interior wall. As she did so, she heard Kathy click her tongue as if she was saying &quot;no that won&#39;t do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... your present bra is too small for you,&quot; Kathy answered, &quot;you&#39;ve managed to squeeze into it, but&#39;s its compressing you enough that it&#39;ll screw up the measurement. I mean... you do feel it, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right...&quot; Martha admitted, &quot;but I haven&#39;t had much choice for support in situations when I&#39;ve needed it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it&#39;s a good thing you&#39;re here,&quot; Kathy spoke, &quot;Off with that and I&#39;ll get you measured and you can buy bras that fit the new you properly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Martha admitted, shyly, and reached around to undo the clasps on her bra. She felt a good deal of relief as her breasts bounced free of the material of her bra. Once the bouncing stopped, they settled into place and sat firmly on her chest. She raised her arms and she soon felt Kathy begin to wrap the measuring tape around her chest. Kathy set the tape so that it ran over Martha&#39;s nipples and then wrapped around her back. She shivered a little at the cold metal tip on the end of the tape when it touched her back. She heard Kathy go &quot;uh-hm&quot; as she measured each of Martha&#39;s new measurements, even as the measuring tape was slid from her breasts to just below her breasts, to her waist and finally to her hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what do I measure at?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;With regards to your bust, waist, and hips?&quot; Kathy replied, &quot;You&#39;re thirty-six, twenty-six, thirty-six, E. Pretty typical for a werecat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha sort of suspected that. She had always had fairly wide hips, but in becoming a werecat, she had gained at least an inch on her hips and her waist had actually lost an inch. Her bust had gained at least two inches to give her a truly hourglass look, which she knew William, Frances, and Samantha would love.  As she slipped her outer clothes back on, minus the too small bra, she admitted to herself that she loved it too. Once she was dressed, Kathy opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll dispose of...&quot; Kathy spoke with a distasteful tone at Martha&#39;s old bra, &quot;this... along with the things that the other new were had. She and her fiancee are still here...&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that Martha noticed what sounded like giggling coming from one of the other fitting rooms. She guessed this was the other customer was. She nodded while Kathy walked off and then began to look through the shopping area in the women&#39;s section of the shop. Just as Frances had said, the prices were higher then expected, and since she knew that William would need to get clothing that would better fit the new him as well and that with the move and other issues, she couldn&#39;t afford a full wardrobe at the present time. She&#39;d get a few things that would work to teach again and focus for the moment on getting bras and panties that would fit her better, as they were really the things that had fit the tightest on the new her. <br />
<br />
She made her way to the shelves where she found collections of panties on each shelf and arranged by both their &quot;model&quot; and their size. And while they seemed to be made out of many of the same materials that most panties were made of. Some were simple cotton and some were silk. Some had rather simple patterns while others had rather exquisite lace and designs that left parts of them rather sheer and near see-through that Martha figured held the purpose that William had joked to her the other day... to hold her partner&#39;s attention while she took them off. The one thing that Martha noted all of the panties she checked had was a small hole in the back of pair that was purpose cut to be there. The top of the hole had a piece of elastic that was very stretchy and could stretch up. This likely allowed for the hole to be kept small enough that in human form, no one would be able to see her butt if someone caught her in just her underwear. The elastic at the top was what would allow for her tail to grow out when she transformed.<br />
<br />
As Martha picked out a few of the panties that were labeled to be at her size the door to the fitting room opened and two weres came out. To Martha&#39;s nose, they carried the scent of werefox and as Martha looked to them, she noted they were a male and female. The male had light brown/dark blond hair while the female had sandy blond hair, and both of them looked to be of about college students. The male was also carrying a rather impressive load of clothing, all feminine clothing of all times. They were folded over his arm, but it was clear that the female was replacing her entire wardrobe. For the moment, the two seemed too enamored with each other to notice Martha&#39;s presence.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you like it?&quot; the female asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They all fit you well, Jen,&quot; the male answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just glad the little mouse lady let me put on the first things before picking out the rest,&quot; &quot;Jen&quot; answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wererat, Jenny,&quot; the male answered.<br />
<br />
Jenny shrugged and turned and finally noted Martha standing there. She then stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having fun?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way,&quot; Jenny answered carefully, and to Martha almost nervously as she eyed Martha. &quot;I kinda need new clothes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see that,&quot; Martha commented as she noted the clothing that the male werefox carried, &quot;did your mate change you... or...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha watched as Jenny looked down and looked a little more insecure. It was that that made Martha realize that this was Yvette&#39;s second victim! The girl that gotten clawed and been incomplete for so long. And despite her status as a werevixen, she seemed to stir Martha&#39;s maternal instincts.<br />
<br />
&quot;... You&#39;re the other one that the rogue clawed!&quot; Martha gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; the male spoke up, &quot;I&#39;m Harold Jenkins... call me Harry. This is my fiancee Jennifer Harper. Yvette Smith did claw her and turned her into a female werefox. She&#39;s recently had her transformation completed and we&#39;re getting her some clothing so that she has stuff that her new body isn&#39;t too voluptuous for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirty-eight, twenty-six, thirty-eight, F! And I used to be a stick!&quot; Jenny chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were always beautiful, Jenny,&quot; Harry said to her with the same tone that Martha had noticed in William when he spoke of his bond to her. The two were bonded mates.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad that your transformation was completed,&quot; Martha said to Jenny and gave a slight chuckle, &quot;and I fully understand the need for new clothes. I only became a werecat this past Friday, so I&#39;m also very much in the need of getting things that will fit the new me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny gave a half nod to Martha, but shied away toward Harry, as if she thought Martha might attack her or something.<br />
<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t worry,&quot; Martha assured her, &quot;I&#39;m nothing like the rogue that clawed you and my husband. And friends of mine have assured me that she will pay for what she&#39;s done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Husband...&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mister Anderson is your husband?&quot; Harry asked, &quot;but... you&#39;re a werecat... when normals join were society... when they&#39;re married to each other, they join the same were-species.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While Yvette did claw my William,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;... and I love him dearly... I didn&#39;t want to be a werefox and... well... I&#39;m bisexual. I&#39;d been repressing that side for a long time, but in Moon Lake, with how some friends had explained that those who are gay/lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered and the knowledge that werecats were an entirely female were-species that were at least bisexual... I&#39;d begun to recognize just how bad I&#39;d been repressing myself and that I needed to be complete with regards to my preferences. To do that I became a werecat, and I got the best of both... I have two wonderful female lovers who love me for more than my body and apparently my voice and I still have William, who&#39;s bond is to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha carefully moved forward and carefully put a hand on Jenny&#39;s shoulder, and purring in a friendly and maternal way, &quot;and I hope things go well for you and your fiancee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jenny said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll let you two get on with your mission, as I have a bit more shopping of my own to do,&quot; Martha said to them with a smile and let them go about their business.<br />
<br />
Jenny had displayed some of the sort of quirks that Frances had said she might be experiencing because of how long she was incomplete, but she looked quite well physically to Martha. She also looked happy with Harry by her side, and that was more than enough to placate the mother in Martha. She honestly did want Jenny to be happy and to heal from all the stress that Yvette Smith had put her under. They went off and as Martha returned to her shopping, she heard them checking out. The bell for the door also opened announcing the arrival of more customers.<br />
<br />
Martha completed her selection with seven pairs of panties and bras, most were largely fairly plain and functional, but at least three pair were rather sexy. She also made a mental note over the models so that way once things were more secure financially after the move that she could return for more. She also noted that the smallest cup size on all the bra models there was a D, which gave her the clear indication on who the shop was selling to. She also collected two white long sleeved blouses, one short sleeved button down blouse, one black knee length skirt, and a pair of women&#39;s jeans. She noted in the skirt that there was a folded seam at the the top that concealed a hole in the back. In human form, that folded seam would stay down and hide the hole, and in werecat form, her tail would fit through the hole and the folded seam would &quot;fold&quot; to let her tail grow. The jeans had a sort of folded seam that functioned in a similar way. It would be enough to start with as she would have underwear that fit and some clothing that would easily shift with her if necessary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you find everything you wanted ma&#39;am?&quot; Kathy asked when Martha approached the checkout counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;I did. This really is a good little shop you have here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We do our best,&quot; Kathy answered, &quot;though a lot of what we do is to put together clothing that is specifically for us and our rather unique needs as were-beasts. As such... if you want anything that&#39;s more brand name... or supporting the Mariners or Seahawks, you&#39;ll need to go to the K-Mart on the east entrance to town.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded, remembering seeing the small discount department store when they had first drove into Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do have to ask... as I&#39;ve only become a were recently and this is my first time here... what are the store hours and do you do business on the weekend?&quot; Martha asked, &quot;My husband also recently became a were and is in much the same boat as me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... we&#39;re open from eight to noon and twelve-thirty to five on Monday through Friday,&quot; Kathy spoke as she continued ringing up Martha&#39;s items, &quot;and on Saturday we&#39;re open from eight to noon. We aren&#39;t open on Sundays... and we will put a sign out for holidays that we also close on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Martha answered, and made sure she would tell William about the shop as a good source for clothing that would fit him and work with his ability to grow a long fluffy fox tail behind him. As Kathy finished ringing up the last of the goods, Martha paid for her purchases and made her way out, feeling pleased with herself in getting her missions done. With that she walked calmly back to her car.</p>
