<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><hr />

Chris closed the door behind him and looked down at Tyler's tiny form.  The top of the small man's head didn't even come up to the anthropomorphic rabbit's waist and his expression was decidedly nervousness.  Chris' heart was still beating fast and he knew that only part of it was his now-lapine biology.  Looking back on the past 2 hours, it was hard to believe all that he'd gone through.<br /><br />

The game had given and the game had taken away.<br /><br />

Currently, as he looked down at his one time lover, he chuckled and slowly ran his palm over the smaller man's head, feeling the soft, much finer hair on his head against his own, short fur.  The paw pads on his fingertips seemed unusually sensitive -something he wouldn't have expected given how numb they were on actual rabbits- but it was just one more aspect of "anthropomorphized" that he figured the game had visited upon him.<br /><br />

"It's crazy..." he said, looking down at Tyler, "since dinner I've made and lost both billions of dollars and all my friends.  I've turned into a humanoid rabbit with blue eyes and may even be immortal if that result in round two is right."<br /><br />

A nod was his response as Tyler calmed himself a bit and tilted his head forward to let Chris' fingers caress the back of his neck.  "No shit," he finally said, sighing as he let the stress fade from him, "I mean, Sid's an inflatable lion with more muscle than God and I just keep shrinking every time someone I care about has an argument."<br /><br />

Chris looked down at Tyler, curiously.  "Care about?  What about in the bathroom?  You didn't exactly care about me then, and you must've lost a foot in that little exchange..."<br /><br />

Tyler shrugged.  "I dunno, then.  Maybe I just have a problem with arguments in general.  The thing is," he looked up at Chris soberly, "I'm sorry I was such a shit to you.  I ... I <i>do</i> like you, Chris ... you know that, right?"<br /><br />

Chris nodded and smiled.  "Of course," he said.  Inwardly, however, he added <i>Just not enough to be my boyfriend...</i>.<br /><br />

"So, uh, you were saying something about putting a little guy in his place?"<br /><br />

Chris grinned.  "Well, with your size-control powers, that might be hard, but I think I can manage it ... shrimp."<br /><br />

Tyler felt a shudder go through him at that last word.  Rabbit-like or not, Chris sounded so purposeful ... so cocky and in-charge; the small man knew that it was all part of their play but it still felt so <i>real</i>!<br /><br />

Slowly, Chris pulled his shirt off revealing his tight, toned physique.  It was partly his rabbit metabolism, he guessed, since the short fur he had over his chest, arms, legs and abdomen showed far more definition than he'd ever had as a human.<br /><br />

His tall ears twitched as the shirt came up over them and he heard the tiny intake of breath from Tyler at the sight.  "Mmmmmm...  Sounds like someone likes what they see..." he said with a sly smirk on his face.<br /><br />

Tyler could only nod as he stepped back to get a better view of the giant man.  Sharply, however, Chris' paw gripped Tyler's shoulder, holding him in place.  "Oh, I don't want you to get away," said the big rabbit slyly.  "A toy has to be played with before it can be put away..."<br /><br />

The little man felt his heart beat faster as he craned his neck up to look at the supreme confidence of that animalistic face looking down at him.  The white fur of Chris' face made him look strangely serene and, well, "soft".  It was like looking up at a drawing from a fantasy novel.  Cute, innocent but -with that expression and tone of voice- an aura of lustful dominance was draped over it all...<br /><br />

"Uh, Chris, you are -uh- awful big...  Maybe we should try waiting a bit..."<br /><br />

The words that came out of Tyler's mouth were like those he'd heard his submissive lovers say to him during various sexual romps in the past.  It startled him at how easy it was to slip into that mindset and assign a greater position to the larger man.<br /><br />

Indeed, the words seemed to have an effect on Chris, as well.<br /><br />

Not hearing or seeing any serious resistance on the part of his playmate, the big rabbit took a deep, slow breath and shook his head, his grip on Ty's shoulder tightening as his free hand went down to unfasten the button fly of his jeans.<br /><br />

Tyler's eyes followed the movement and then stayed fixed on the sizable bulge in the rabbit's pants.  Nervously, he swallowed.<br /><br />

Chris' fingers worked the button deftly as he looked down at his new "toy".  "'Waiting' is for guys who work in restaurants," he replied simply.  "Keep this in mind:  in this 'restaurant', <i>I'm</i> the customer.  You're here to serve me and -right now- I'm hungry..."<br /><br />

The small man swallowed hard, again, and divided his glances between the massive, unbuttoned bulge in front of him and the looming, cocky grin of the giant rabbit, overhead.<br /><br />

"Take off my pants, toy," said Chris, simply.  He felt the heady thrill of ordering Ty around and he started seeing exactly why some fellahs insisted on this game.  "Do it.  Now."<br /><br />

Tyler felt a shiver run through him at the command and, before he realized it, was nodding and putting his small hands up against the large zipper on Chris' pants.  It was thick and heavy, blunter in shape than it would have appeared if he were not so small, and cumbersome as well.  His small fingers fumbled with it for a moment before finally managing to get the teeth of the zipper to disengage and the fly to drop.<br /><br />

Licking his lips, nervously, he watched as the bulging briefs of the furry, anthro-rabbit came into full view and Chris' pants spread to the sides, falling down.  Tyler stepped back, allowing the heavy fabric to land around the larger man's huge, lapine feet.  Chris just kept his face straight and stared down at the small man, expectantly.<br /><br />

"Well?  Keep going...  If I don't feel cool air against my dick in less than thirty seconds, I'll fuck you so hard you'll think my dick was going to come out your mouth..."<br /><br />

No further encouragement was needed.<br /><br />

Still barely two-foot-six, the tiny man reached up and gripped the top of Chris' waistband with both hands.  The lapine's soft fur felt soothing against his skin and the gentle, white hue looked stark in contrast to Tyler's Mediterranean tan.<br /><br />

Slowly, Tyler pulled down and watched as the tightly-clinging fabric peeled away to reveal more and more of Chris' groin.<br /><br />

The shape-shift of Tyler's former lover was, indeed, body-wide.  But -to Tyler's eyes- nothing was quite as stunning as the sheer size of Chris' cock and balls.  The toned, trim boytoy that Chris was had always been rather large with at least four inches -even soft- hanging just over a pair of golf-ball-sized testicles.  To the shrunken man, however, the rabbit was enormous.<br /><br />

His soft cock, in a thicker and fully covering sheath, hung from the taller man's groin nearly ten of Tyler's inches.  As for the thickness, it was somewhere between two and three inches across!  The human swallowed, nervously, and shook his head.  Each of Chris' balls had grown with the change into lapine in addition to the size difference between the two.  He glanced up at Chris and saw the rabbit smile with satisfaction at his increased ball size ... somewhere around two and a half inches across.<br /><br />

Tyler, however, cupped them in his diminished hands and judged them to be closer to the size of honeydew melons about a half a foot across, each!<br /><br />

"Oh, Chris, I ... I don't know..."<br /><br />

"Can it, tiny," ordered the rabbit, getting into his role.  "You have exactly one minute to get me fully hard or I'll do it myself and <i>then</i> use your ass as a chamois."<br /><br />

The smaller man jumped at Chris' sharp words and nodded, moving his hands from the huge, furry orbs up to the base of the thick, dangling sheathed shaft.  The rabbit felt a rush go through him at the touch of those delicate, strong hands and grinned in self-satisfaction as Tyler wrapped both hands around his cock and began stroking it.<br /><br />

Thick, musky flesh now surrounded his penis completely and the small man's hands slid it back and forth over the organ, within.  It felt <i>so</i> good that Chris couldn't help slowly bucking his hips.  Gradually, his cock stiffened and began to push its way out of the surrounding sheath.<br /><br />

"Suck my tip, shrimp," rumbled the otherwise soft-voiced lapine to his toy.<br /><br />

Tyler couldn't refuse.  He felt so small ... so helpless.  The fact that the game, itself, had also given him the ability to control the sizes of other things didn't even dawn on him.  No, he was small, helpless and completely at Chris' mercy for as long as they were alone together...<br /><br />

"Yes, sir," he replied and slowly pulled the stiffening cock down towards his face.  He smiled as he caught a whiff of Chris' sensual body odor:  the scent of sex was cloying and so much stronger at this reduced size.  He tried not to grin like a dumb kid with a new toy, but he didn't succeed very well.  Instead, with his tongue, he began licking at the large, bulbous tip of the larger man's cock.<br /><br />

But not for long.<br /><br />

It kept getting bigger.  And bigger...  And Bigger...!<br /><br />

Tyler moaned as Chris forced the massive pole's tip past his lips and gripped the sides of his head, starting to force him to take more and more of the huge, stiffening penis.  More than a minute had passed, but it seemed that the rabbit was enjoying himself far too much to carry through with his earlier threat.  Rather, as his cock stretched and strained the capacities of Tyler's mouth, he just seemed to want more and more from the tiny man.<br /><br />

His jaw ached.  As Chris became fully hard, it was like sucking on a stiff cock of equine proportions!  Not only was the fleshy-pink shaft almost as long as the small man's arm but it was -to Tyler- about five inches thick!<br /><br />

He moaned and tried to let Chris know, but the big rabbit just sneered at the sounds of discomfort, reaching down to spank the still-clothed Ty.  "None of that, toy...  You take it like a man..."<br /><br />

Another roar of lion's lust echoed through the relatively thin wall that separated Dave's bedroom from Sid's.  Chris, however, was too engrossed in his fun to really notice.  Tyler, on the other hand, nearly jumped out of his skin as the long, tremulous sound rumbled through the rafters and floor boards.<br /><br />

Ty nearly gagged as a salty shot of precum splashed over his tongue and was forced down his throat by his huge lover.  He struggled a bit, trying to unwedge his head from the giant's hands enough to work his mouth loose, but Chris wouldn't allow it.  He just moaned, getting more desperate as he breathed through his nose and felt the rabbit cock thrusting against the back of his throat intensely.<br /><br />

<i>If Chris isn't careful, he'll choke me with that thing,</I> he thought, feeling his heart pounding faster and faster.<br /><br />

His own cock got hard in his small pants and he shivered at the incongruity of it all.  Here he was, a slave to the lusts of a giant man with an enormous cock and he was actually <i>enjoying</i> himself!  It almost scared him, being used like this, but -then again- it was what he'd asked for.<br /><br />

The taste of Chris' cock was fantastic and it made him feel so potent by just proximity to it.  He groaned, feeling the ache of his jaw become a part of the overall feeling of lust and erotic indulgence.  He closed his eyes, moaning as he tried to take more of Chris into him, but to no avail.  His mouth felt like it was on fire as he gulped down more and more of the huge man's precum and had no choice but to continue.<br /><br />

Tyler reached forward and began stroking the huge man's balls, feeling Chris lean over him as his breaths grew shorter and shallower.  Small moans of pleasure escaped the rabbit man's muzzle as his ears and tail both flicked with what Tyler could tell was his approaching orgasm.<br /><br />

More and more of the salty pre flooded Tyler's mouth.  His breaths became more and more strained through his nostrils as the shots of pre became more frequent.  He shivered and looked up, his eyes having to roll in their sockets as his head was still held firmly by the masterful giant.  Chris was nearly halfway to being doubled-over, his rocking hips thrusting the hot, thick cock into Tyler's mouth again and again, his sore jaw feeling as if it were on fire!<br /><br />

Then, suddenly, it ended.<br /><br />

Chris tensed up and his massive balls seemed to clench before Tyler's face and that cock -that enormous, thick cock- began to spew its thick, white contents deep into the little man's mouth and throat.  He gagged immediately, and -in desperation- nearly found the strength to force the massive pole from him.  Spurts of white goo oozed from around his lips.  But Chris was too strong for him.  Tyler felt the giant's cock tip press firmly against the back of his throat, forcing the little man to swallow shot after shot of the flood.  He couldn't breathe but -instead- hoped for a quick climax that would allow him to have some respite, soon!<br /><br />

On and on, Chris went, the seconds seeming like minutes.  In less time than it felt like to Tyler, the huge, fertile rabbit's cum abated and Chris' breathing slowly returned to normal.  Tyler swallowed the last bits of the cum, the massive cock still with its first fifth crammed into his mouth, and started to breathe again through his nostrils.<br /><br />

Slowly, without pulling his cock from Tyler's mouth, Chris bent over a bit more and managed to reach his paws underneath Tyler's rump.  Giving the smaller man support, he picked him up and slowly waddled over to Dave's unoccupied bed to lie down.  He grinned down at his "toy" and winked.<br /><br />

"There we go...  Just the right place for you, too ... with your lips wrapped around my cock."<br /><br />

The world stopped spinning for Tyler as he was set down between Chris' legs and continued to find the rabbit's hands on his head.  He grinned around his aching mouthful of cock and felt himself blush.  Without knowing it, this was an experience he'd never had before but now felt like a guilty pleasure...<br /><br />

Trembling like thunder, another leonine roar erupted from the bedroom next door, startling both Chris and the tiny Tyler.  Chris leaned up, his t-shirt still tightly wrapped across his boytoy, rabbit-like chest.  A grin spread across his muzzle as one of his ears bent in the direction of the wall.  "Man, he wasn't kidding when he said he had a lot of lust to work out, was he?"<br /><br />

Finally, the big cock was removed and Tyler could moan and respond.  He rubbed his jaw, slowly, and licked some of the remaining cum from his lips before answering.  "As ... as long as he controls it and doesn't let it control him, I think he'll be fine..."<br /><br />

Chris shot a stern look down at the small man between his legs.  Tyler gulped.  "I mean, 'I think he'll be fine', <i>Master</i>..."<br /><br />

Chris smiled and laid back on the pillow to close his eyes.  "That's better."</p>
