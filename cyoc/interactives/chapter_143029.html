<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick woke up naked but as a human the next morning. He stood up and immediately realized that his male parts had grown back as they were swinging between his legs again. He felt a little relief although he still felt awkward of being too endowed.<br />
<br />
When he came out from the bathroom, Riley was having breakfast and watching cartoon. Nick didn&#39;t want him to see him naked, so he sneaked to the closet and looked for something to wear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your clothes are on your bed.&quot; Riley told him without looking away from the television.<br />
<br />
Nick blushed a little and went to his bed. However, to his surprise, he just found there the white banana hammock he wore the day he was punished to be an adult. It didn&#39;t even look clean as he can noticed some pubes in it. He felt a little disgusted but then he remembered that those were his pubes cause he now was a furball.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t use this.&quot; Nick said. &quot;I need real clothes.&quot;<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have, remember? All your other clothes didn&#39;t fit you anymore.&quot; Riley said. &quot;Also, we accorded to go to that stripper club and asked them for turn you back to a kid. They could remember you better if you use the same clothing that you wore that day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick reluctantly put on the clothing and although it looked like a big thong at first sight, when he used it, it felt small and tight. He felt ashamed of being too endowed again. After that, he looked for something to eat and minutes later, he and Riley were ready to go to the stripper club.<br />
<br />
Like the last time they visited it, the place was full of men waiting to come in and new boys on the other line waiting to be part of the show. As Nick and Riley got closer, some men remembered Nick and were cheering him to join the show, however he ignored them and asked the security guard to come in and see the manager. Fortunately, he also recognized Nick and allowed them to go in.<br />
<br />
Inside the club there was too much people that Nick and Riley barely moved through there, on the stage they saw some almost naked men happily performing and Nick felt awkward to remember that they were in fact kids like him.<br />
<br />
They were looking for the manager for a while, until someone told them that he was out there, in the backyard. They managed to go there and quickly recognized the man who turned Nick into a horse and the manly specimen he was now. He wasn&#39;t alone, because he was discussing with other men, some of them wearing banana hammocks like Nick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn us back!&quot; A black guy who looked as old as Nick and was wearing a yellow banana hammock said. &quot;I can&#39;t go home looking like this!&quot;<br />
&quot;All of you agreed to the island policies so you have to pay your sentences.&quot; The manager replied.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not fair!&quot; A really hairy guy wearing a purple banana hammock yelled. &quot;My father will kill me if I&#39;m not in home in two days!&quot;<br />
&quot;There must be something we can do to convince you.&quot; A blonde twink guy in a pink banana hammock suggested with a lusty grin.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not interested in a disobedient group of kids who can&#39;t make their jobs on the bed.&quot; The manager said. &quot;However, I have an idea.&quot; The man wickedly grinned. &quot;Follow me.&quot; The guys looked each other in confusion but agreed to follow the man.<br />
<br />
The men, including Nick and Riley followed the manager to a football field not far from the stripper club.<br />
&quot;Ok, this is the deal.&quot; The man said as they arrived. &quot;You&#39;re going to split in two teams. The team who wins in a football match is going to turn back to normal aand the loser... well, they will receive a proper punishment, do you agree?&quot;<br />
The guys looked each other for a while, and when they realized that this was their only chance to go back to childhood again they agreed.<br />
The manager randomly created the teams and Nick ended up with the black guy, the hairy one and the twink. None of them had played football before and they thought that the other guys were on the same condition, so they considered to tie and all of them could go back to normal after that. However, the manager wasn&#39;t too stupid and he took out from his pocket two bags of candies.<br />
&quot;Take one.&quot; He commanded them. &quot;It&#39;s an order.&quot;<br />
Nick reluctantly took a bag while a guy from the other team take the other one. They knew that this candies are going to change them but the manager didn&#39;t tell them how. Each one of the guys took a candy and thought about eating it.<br />
Finally, Nick decided to eat it and swallowed his candy.<br />
<br />
At first nothing happened, he was the same young man. However, when he tried to talk he let out a loud belch instead. Almost immediately, his body began to pump everywhere filling him with muscles. His neck thickened until it fused with his head, his shoulders broadened abnormally huge and he felt his hands and feet growing bigger to match the rest of his body. Finally, his mind was fulled with football knowledge and competitiveness.<br />
&quot;I know how to play!&quot; He said in a voice way more deeper than before that made him sounds like a dumb football jock.<br />
After hearing that, the other guys followed him and swallowed their candies. The black guy grew more muscles than the others but the hairy one was the tallest. However, it was the twink guy who changed the most, as he increased everywhere in a few seconds. His hairless and smooth body was pumping with rock hard muscles, his arms and legs got three times thicker closely followed by his hands and feet which looked intimidating now. Finally, when his head fused with his torso, his pink banana hammock couldn&#39;t handle the growth and it tore and fell on the ground leaving him naked and exposing the new mammoth between his legs.<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; He said more surprised than embarrassed in his deeper dumb jock voice. &quot;It seems I&#39;m going to play naked!&quot;<br />
The other guys including Nick laughed at that in their booming voices. However, their laughs stopped when they saw the other team.<br />
Instead of turning into futball jocks, the other guys were growing huge and hairy, their faces were devolving until instead of four human men, there were four angry big gorillas.<br />
&quot;I forgot to say that one of my bags had a little advantage.&quot; The manager grinned as he looked at the jocks. &quot;Sorry guys, it seems that you weren&#39;t lucky.&quot;</p>
