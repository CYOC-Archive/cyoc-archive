<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next few weeks were happy times for both Jeff and Brianna. Knowing it would have to come to light sooner or later, they told their families about the relationship, though they were sure to leave out anything about the secretive sexual nature of it. Despite anticipated teasing from Jack and a few uncomfortable “talks” from his parents about proper condom use and consent, Jeff couldn’t have been happier.<br />
<br />
The two of them mostly spent their time at each other’s houses, watching movies or talking about trivial things. They texted one another frequently, keeping up to date on how school was going and how they other was feeling. The two had even come up with nicknames for the other, with Jeff being dubbed “Jeffy Pop” and Brianna receiving the title of “Bri-Bri”. Careful about place and timing, the two enjoyed an extraordinary and delightfully quirky sexual relationship thanks to Jeff’s breast - with his fingers and tongue doing the work that his newfound appendage wasn’t able to, of course.<br />
<br />
Roughly one month after Jeff had officially become Brianna’s boyfriend, life with the breast had become completely normal to him. It was true, he had yet to change back even weeks later, but he had no compelling reason outside of his own personal feelings. There was no reason to, and the enjoyment it brought Brianna consistently outweighed any doubts. He had figured out multiple ways of taping it down for gym class and remaining unseen in the showers, and after the way Brianna found out frequently locked the door behind him when he was using the toilet - something he could do with his eyes shut at this point. <br />
<br />
Jeff was happy, and didn’t think his life could get any better.<br />
<br />
One Friday afternoon, Jeff sat in his room reading a graphic novel when his phone buzzed. Checking it, he saw a text from Brianna.<br />
<br />
-Hi babe :3<br />
<br />
-Hi, Bri-Bri. What&#39;s up?<br />
<br />
-Greta!<br />
-*Great lol you want to get together this weekend? Go somewhere?<br />
<br />
-Sure, what did u have in mind?<br />
<br />
-Was wondering if you’d like to see a new movie, in theaters. That new one about the time-traveller seems fun<br />
<br />
-Okay! What time?<br />
<br />
-Saturday or Sunday at noon-ish?<br />
<br />
-I can do Saturday looking forward to seeing you! Love you!<br />
<br />
-Love u 2 :D<br />
<br />
Saturday arrived without incident, and both Jeff and Brianna arrived at their local movie theater, arms locked. After much playful arguing, they decided to pay for each other’s tickets, and went to the confections stand to get something small; they had decided they could grab lunch afterwards, so they didn’t want to spoil their appetites.<br />
<br />
Jeff bought a packet of Whoppers that, instinctively, reminded him of chocolate coated breasts, and Brianna purchased a small soda with ice. The theater the movie was playing in was relatively empty, and with only a few minutes left before the film actually began it didn’t look as though it would fill up anytime soon. The two grabbed a pair of seats in the back, distanced from the few other patrons who were already there.<br />
<br />
As the movie progressed, it proved to be nothing like the marketing hype. Aside from a few clever scenes, it was decidedly mediocre. They spent a considerable amount of time during the first act noticing and picking apart plot holes, through hushed whispers and laughter.<br />
<br />
Jeff finished his candy, which had the most interesting part of the moviegoing experience so far, and slumped in his seat as he hoped in vain that the film would improve or recapture his attention. Not much later, something did indeed gain his interest, though it wasn&#39;t anything to do with what was happening on the screen.<br />
<br />
It started out small, almost unnoticeable, but only for the briefest moment. After a second, Jeff felt a gentle squeeze on his breast, her finger gingerly pressing and caressing the hidden plaything from the outside of his pants. Jeff inhaled slowly, and glanced over at Brianna. Her arm was stretched out over to his lap, rubbing their shared secret with a loving care. Jeff smiled weakly, and spoke up. Or, at least he tried to.<br />
<br />
“B-B-Br-B-Br-Br-B-Bri-“<br />
<br />
Not even looking at him, Brianna smirked knowingly, putting a finger to her lips, and seductively ran her palm over his groin once more before gently and slowly undoing his zipper.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed as he started leaning back in his seat. He figured that it was too dark for anyone to notice what either of them were doing, and given that they were sitting far enough away from everyone else, nobody would be any the wiser.<br />
<br />
Brianna&#39;s touch was firm and now well practiced. She took her time, her approach gentle, rubbing her palm against it, and jiggling it with her finger tips. She slipped her hand underneath the bra cup, pinching the nipple, and tugged it softly before running a finger around the areola. Jeff smiled dreamily, the movie all but forgotten compared to his current experience. He could feel the nipple stiffening, the breast swelling ever so gently. It was a pleasurable sensation that he didn’t grow tired of, no matter how many times he felt it happen. Something about it just felt ... right.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of light playing, Brianna withdrew her hand, leaving him feeling oddly disappointed and unsatisfied, but simultaneously blue-balled  -- or was that blue mammaried? However, it was a necessary evil, as her hand returned with something else included. Jeff bit his lower lip and stifled a moan as she began to rub the cool, slippery wet ice cube around his breast, essentially oiling up his one-of-a-kind private part with glistening, chilled water.<br />
<br />
The situation would have been incredibly uncomfortable if it was anyone else. Yet, something about her gentle touch coupled with her understanding personality translated to an experience truly beyond anything he could have imagined. The movie&#39;s crawling end credits seemed to go by in an instant, time made completely irrelevant by his girlfriend’s talented hand satiating his most basic of male needs. Jeff felt an intense desire for ‘relief’, though he knew this wasn’t the time nor place for such a thing. Still, the building pressure running in tandem with Brianna’s merciless teasing was driving him up the wall. As the film finally ended and the lights began to brighten, she carefully extracted her fingers, zipped his pants back up, and took his hand. All he could do was to follow her out of the theatre in tow, trying his best to not look like he was in some kind of drunken stupor, one that was caused by the lingering forbidden sexual urges at the forefront of his mind.</p>
