<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The girls now had the rings in their possession. Jimmy was still shocked about the sudden attack, he couldn't reacted at all.<br />
<br />
The girls took no time as they slid the ring onto their tiny fingers, where it adjusted itself to fit perfectly. <br />
<br />
Continue the plan that Jennifer crafted, the girls quickly chanted together &quot;I wish Jimmy was 15 years younger, and that Jennifer/Ashley and I was 15 years older!&quot;<br />
<br />
The reason the girls did this was because neither one knew which ring was which, so they had to make sure that there wish would work either way.<br />
<br />
With the requirements for the wish completed, the girls quickly hoped off the couch, as they took off in opposite direction out of the living room.<br />
<br />
Jimmy realizing that he had been trick by his pesky little sister, couldn't have been more angry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get back here you little whores!&quot; Jimmy yelled, as he began to chase in the direction his sister took off in.<br />
<br />
But the magic was already in motion, as Jimmy felt himself becoming younger with every step. The girls though smiled as they felt themselves grow older with each of their own steps, making each other stride a little longer than the last.<br />
<br />
Jimmy turned onto the hallway, as he saw his little sister waiting for him in the kitchen with a smiled on her face. She had grown considerable for her clothes were tightly stretched across her body, showing a midriff as her t-shirt was becoming far too small.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer! Give me that ring back right now!&quot; Jimmy roared, but his demanding voice was more like a whine of a prepubescent boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you come here and get it?&quot; Giggled Jennifer, as her body continued to mature.<br />
<br />
With that, Jimmy took a dash towards his little sister, but it was becoming more troublesome to move for Bobby's clothes began to restricted his movement.<br />
<br />
The closer Jimmy got to his sister, the bigger she got. Jimmy watched as her clothes began to finally tore from her body. Her tight teenage figure began to blossom as her chest heaved and expanded out. Her hips also flared out, rounding out her wide ass cheeks.<br />
<br />
Jimmy finally reached Jennifer, but he found his height to be at her stomach. Looking up, he couldn't even see his little sister face from underneath her massive bosom, which continue to push out.<br />
<br />
Jennifer taking a small step backwards, and taking a look down, he looked at the angry face of her brother with a smile. &quot;Enjoy the view down there Short-stuff?<br />
<br />
Jimmy had to be about 6 year-old, and was continue to regress, even though looking up at his giant little sister, he held his tiny pudgy hands up as he barely mumbled out, &quot;give them back...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww...&quot; Jennifer just giggle as the magic was finally ending. Jennifer gave out one last moan as she felt her body push out for the last time, returning her back to the buxom form she once had. Jimmy on the other hand fully regressed back into a baby, his little bald head poke out from the top of the oversized t-shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;It feel so good having boobs again&quot; Jennifer groaned, squeezing her massive breast with both hands while gently rubbing her hard nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like your plan worked&quot; Ashley smiled as she walked in. She was also an adult now as well, but she seemed to have made her way into Jennifer's mother's room, for she was fully clothed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did I say? My brother's so dumb.&quot; Jennifer laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;In any case here catch.&quot; Ashley said while tossing Jennifer some clothes as well. &quot;What do you want to do about the baby on the floor?&quot; Ashley asked as Jennifer finished putting on her clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think it's time we teach my little brother who's really in charge.&quot; With that Jennifer looked at her ring and back at Jimmy. &quot;I wish that Jimmy was 5 years older&quot;<br />
<br />
With that being said Jimmy instantly started to rise off the floor.<br />
<br />
'Looks like I got the ring of aging&quot; Jennifer smiled to herself.<br />
<br />
It didn't take long before Jimmy was back to being a tiny 6-year-old toddler. The only thing that covered his little body was the oversized t-shirt which hung off his narrow shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer give me back those rings right now! I'm supposed to be the older one!&quot; Jimmy continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so, little bro&quot; Jennifer giggle leaning her buxom figure down. &quot;In fact I think you deserve a little punishment for being such a naughty little boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer then grabbed on the Jimmy's little hand and lead him to the living room. Jimmy tried desperately to escape, but he couldn't over power his former little sister.<br />
<br />
Jennifer sat on the couch, where she made Jimmy laid down on her lap. Jimmy then gasp in horror for he couldn't believe what was going to happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer... you can't...&quot; Jimmy gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you shouldn't had been such a bad boy, as you older sister I have to punish you.&quot; Grin Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Jennifer then grip the bottom of the t-shirt Jimmy was wearing, pulling it up to the point where his little butt was exposed. Lifting her hand up, she promptly whipped it down, letting it land on his butt cheeks as it echo across the room.<br />
<br />
Tears began to emerge from Jimmy eyes, both from a mixture of pain and embarrassment. Jennifer proceeded to give him another two slaps before letting him stumble to his feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now back to you room and think about what you done.&quot; Jennifer commanded with a demanding voice.<br />
<br />
Jimmy wiping the tears from his eyes, quickly dashed out of the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... what do we do about Bobby now?&quot; Ashley asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go check on our little man right now&quot; Jennifer suggested, as the girls soon did so.<br />
<br />
The girls entering Jennifer's mother's room, huddled around the baby Bobby.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Bobby was 5 years older&quot; Jennifer said as he began to grow.<br />
<br />
The girls watched as Bobby grew, but even as Bobby finally reached the age of 6, he still looked at the grown woman with blank eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think your brother made him mentally a baby as well?&quot; Suggested Ashley.<br />
<br />
With that said, Jennifer once again made another wish. &quot;I wish Bobby was mentally 15 years older.&quot;<br />
<br />
At once the little kid that was Bobby held his head, it took a while before he utter a word. Finally done with his mental growth he took another look around as he began to understand the situation.<br />
&quot;Jennifer! Ashley! Your bother took the rings and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know we know.&quot; Reassured Jennifer. &quot;We got them back&quot; The girls said showing Bobby the rings.<br />
<br />
Bobby was shock on how the girls manage to overpower Jimmy with those rings, but didn't thought it was too important to know the exact details. &quot;Cool... so an I have them back?&quot; Asked Bobby.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so Bobby&quot; Jennifer replied, shaking her head to the side, &quot;you already lost it once, we can't have that happening again, and plus I think it'll be a little fun to be in control this time.&quot; Jennifer smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... how about making me older now?&quot; Bobby asked looking down at his childish body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, this is your punishment for letting my little brother trick you like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My punishment...?&quot; Asked Bobby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, while we get to be hot, sexy, adult women, you have to be a tiny little boy who can do anything about it.&quot; Jennifer finished. &quot;Now go to my room and see if you can find something to wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby couldn't believe that the two little girls he used to babysit, now seemed like they were the ones babysitting him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now!&quot; Demanding Jennifer pointing to the door.<br />
<br />
Bobby felt so submissive in the present of this older woman, and found himself dashing out of the bedroom. The girls giggled at their tiny little babysitter.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want to do now Jen?&quot; Ashley asked her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm.. I think we should...</p>
