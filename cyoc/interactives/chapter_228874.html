<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rebecca began to walk, and Emily felt every movement. She felt her thick thighs squeeze against her body, the sweat drips onto her skin turned felt. She wanted to cry, mostly because she felt so stupid.<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t I just fix his awareness?&quot; She moaned. &quot;God, I might be panties forever... please Rick, please figure it out! Save me!&quot;<br />
<br />
And as if to answer Emily&#39;s plea, she could hear what sounded like the camera&#39;s switches and levers being played with. Sorrow and regret were replaced by hope as her spirit&#39;s soared.<br />
&quot;Yes! Yes please, PLEASE figure it out Rick!&quot; She thought in a frenzy. &quot;Hell, even just a selfie could fix all of this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THE HELL IS THIS?&quot; Rebecca asked in a loud, yet casual tone. of voice.<br />
<br />
It was then that there was another larger sounding switch, which Emily figured was the biggest switch she had seen, the awareness! She was overjoyed for a moment, hoping that any second now, her owner would get things right! Owner wouldn&#39;t leave her like this. No, owner took care of panties. Panties worn by owner. Help owner, hug owner privates. Panties good panties, like worn. Enjoy warm, wet, safe. Good panties. Good panties. Good...<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Rebecca was fiddling with this odd, old camera she had found. It had the weirdest phrases and words on it that had made no sense to her at all. Like the one she just switched off fully, awareness. What the hell did that mean anyway?! She huffed, seeing that it looked like it didn&#39;t do a thing, unaware herself that she had just reduced her former lover to a mindless pair of panties.<br />
<br />
Rebecca scoffed, thinking that it could be some dumb college project or some artsy fartsy thing, so she was going ot jsut set it down on the bench where she found it, but then gears started turning in her mind. Without an Emily, in this reality, or any kids to speak of,  Rebecca had grown callus and manipulative. She had many gal pals, all of which were more tools to get free things, drama mills to gossip with and about, or drinking buddies for trips or weekends.<br />
<br />
With this newfound outlook she gained once that college aged metabolism faded, she started to look at the world differently. This camera was unique. It was weird, sure, but well put together. If it was personally made, it should look shabbier, but instead it looked expensive. A smile krept across her overly makeup ridden face as the thought of monetary worth popped up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.&quot; She muttered to herself. &quot;Maybe this could be worth something?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jetting her head around at mallgoers, she checked around to see if anyone saw her taking this camera, just in case an owner was nearby, not knowing the original purchaser of the device was wrapped around her pussy, and wedged between her ass cheeks. Seeing no one giving her a side eye, she waddled to her favorite spot in the mall to test out how much it could be worth; the food court.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of walking, she finally made it to the court, and happily sat down with a large huff exhausted from the short trip. From her purse, she plucked the camera again, and eyed all those weird settings. Blend-in, Fusion, Role-Swap, it was all so odd sounding. Her guess was that it was some kind of filter feature built into it, like filters on an app or something. She needed to test it regardless.<br />
<br />
Turning off all the features, she left it on the basic mode and searched the court. The first table full of people she saw were the first subjects she decided on. <br />
<br />
There was a Black business man, having a sandwhich from chik-fil-a for lunch. Beside him was a white guy with shaggy blonde hair, also looking like a business man having a similar lunch with him. Talking to them was a young latina worker wearing a chik-fil-a uniform, holding an empty tray that she had obviously just taken from them, and was chatting with them casually. Behind them was some brunnette janitor cleaning the table beside them.<br />
<br />
Rebecca raised the camera and took a picture. FLASH<br />
<br />
She lowered the camera, surprised by the brightness of the flash. For a moment, she was worried that the family she had taken a picture of would notice, but strangely nobody around her seemed to notice or care about the flash. Releived, she looked down, and saw that the camera had already produced a picture, that was also fully ready to view!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, it&#39;s certainly faster than most polaroids.&quot; She muttered. &quot;Let&#39;s take a look&quot;<br />
<br />
The photo showed just what she had seem in clean detail. The pregnant, black mother, trying to make sure her chile was eating her chicken nugget&#39;s, as her gorgeous brown haired hunk of a husband happily watched beside her. She looked back up to see the dirty-blonde, mixed race girl eating away, while the two parents kissed, the husband gently rubbing her stomach as they did.<br />
<br />
Rebecca just rolled her eyes. She despised when couples did this in public. Whenever her friends asked she&#39;d say that they should keep it private, or that it was innapropriate, but really, she was always just jealous.<br />
&quot;Honestly, why&#39;d I even take a picture of them.&quot; She grumbled, distracting herself by first fixing a wedgie, then looking over the camera again.<br />
<br />
She then decided to try a blend-in switch. After hitting it, she almost expected something to change... but again, nothing did. Suddenly, an obnoxious barrage of laughter errupted from two tables over from her. Sat at the table were three younger men, laughing away as they gorged on burgers.<br />
<br />
They were dressed in football gear, with the colors of the local university, that in another reality, a younger male version of herself had once attended. In fact, these guys had been buddies of Rick, though now they were strangers which Rebecca was frustrated with. Normally, she&#39;d go over, tell them off for being so loud, and maybe even find a manager to complain. However, today she had other priorities.<br />
<br />
There was a tall, blonde guy, clearly the head honcho as the other two boys were facing towards him as he talked. Beside him to his right was a skinny latino boy with a buzz cut, and beside him was an asian boy with a mullet like flow of hair. All were in their purple football uniforms, sitting with their legs and arms laid out, taking up as much space as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now, the least I can do is take photographic evidence of their wrongdoings.&quot; She huffed, before aiming, and letting the camera go off with another bright FLASH.<br />
<br />
She lowered it, and saw the three boys were there still laughing away. The picture showed them well, but she was slightly annoyed that switching the mode didn&#39;t do anything. Before she put it down, however, she accidentally took a picture of herself. Unluckily for Emily, it was just of her face, and on this mode, it wouldn&#39;t change her either.<br />
<br />
After rubbing her eyes, she looked up and was surprised by what she saw.<br />
&quot;Oh shit, when did they get here?&quot; She thought to herself in a panic.<br />
<br />
Sitting in the chair was her friend, Jennifer, from work. Rebecca liked going out with her, but was also VERY jealous of her. She was an attractive blonde lady with a massive, natural rack. Every man in the office who wasn&#39;t taken, and some who were, were always fawning over her. Even just sitting there she exuded confidence. She was sitting with her legs close together, wearing a tight red pencil skirt.<br />
<br />
She was talking ot two girls Rebecca knew, though wasn&#39;t close with. Their was Keiko, who was a younger then them but a real go getter. Rebecca was pretty sure she was Japanese, though maybe Chinese? She had small breasts, but a great ass and general figure, with snow white skin and long black hair. Rebecca was always jealous of how skinny she was, showing it off in tight jeans and a tank top. Rebecca didn&#39;t even realize the contradiction in liking these two totally different body types. <br />
<br />
Last was the new girl, Rosita. Rebecca could tell though that she was gonna be trouble. Her hair was light brown, and curly, tied up in a nice ponytail. A pear shaped body with decent tits and an ass to die for made her the new &quot;eye candy&quot; that Rebecca had heard gossip about. She seemed like she was wealthy, judging by her designer jeans and big lulu lemon purse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, how could I not notice them.&quot; She thought with frustration, until that frustration warped to fusion.<br />
<br />
Sitting on her lap were two photos. One ugly close up of her face, and another of the three women having their lunch. So, she had taken a photo of them? When was that?<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; She thougth before shaking it off. &quot;Ugh, whatever, doesn&#39;t matter... I just can&#39;t let them see me all alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca got up, and began to walk away before suddenly her worst fears were realized.<br />
&quot;Oh my god, Rebecca girl is that you?&quot; Jennifer&#39;s unmistakible voice rose up. &quot;Come over here girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca quickly shoved the photos away, embaraced to have them, but turned with a completely fake smile to greet them.<br />
&quot;OMG, Jenna, hi!&quot; She greeted before walking over.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;re you doing here?&quot; Jennifer happily asked. The question was genuine, but Rebecca being the bitch she now was took it as an insult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, ha, nothing much.&quot; She fake laughed. &quot;Just trying out my new hobby.&quot; She lied, gesturing to the camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I haven&#39;t seen a camera like that before.&quot; Keiko perked up. &quot;I&#39;m Keiko by the way, sorry to interupt.&quot; She added before the two shook hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pleasure.&quot; Rebecca laughed. &quot;And you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Rosita.&quot; She smiled. &quot;So nice to meet you, care to join us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca wanted to tell her flat out no, as she didn&#39;t know her, but didn&#39;t want to look bad in front of this bitch Jenna. She sat down, keeping her smile up as she sat beside the two other girls. That&#39;s when Jennifer perked up and pointed at the camera.<br />
&quot;So, how long have you been doing photography?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so long.&quot; She said, technically correct.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh oh, let&#39;s take a picture!&quot; Rosita called out, causing Rebecca to cringe.<br />
<br />
Rebecca fiddled with the camera&#39;s switches and modes as she had scrambled to grab the camera and ready it. She replied with a meek sure, then turned camera to face them. Luckily, there was a timer, so she turned it on, then got up with the other three women. Jennifer stood up, and wrapped her arms around Keiko and Rebecca as she walked over.<br />
<br />
Rebecca put on a bigger fake smile, but internally cringed as she had to wrap her other arm around Rosita. She wiggled uncomfortably in place, feeling that her former lover unknowingly transformed into panties were giving her a wedgie. The four former college men turned older women gave big grins. <br />
&quot;Say cheese!&quot; Jennifer added, just before reality itself was about to be altered.<br />
<br />
