<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Ding Dong*<br />
<br />
The doorbell rang, signaling the arrival of their first note.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess there&#39;s nothing we can do for him now.&quot; Henry said glumly.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Kelly said trying to sound confident. Truth be told she was beginning to have second thoughts about this competition. Kelly had to keep reminding herself that there were no such things as werewolves, but the setting still freaked her out a lot.<br />
<br />
The gang headed downstairs to read the note. It was very cryptic but the contestants put together that they needed to get a hat from the bus they had all arrived in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that should be easy.&quot; Henry said boisterously. &quot;That Nate kid went further than that to get wood yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true but he&#39;s not here now is he?&quot; Jamie asserted. &quot;We need a plan or we&#39;re going to risk loosing that $3 mill.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, she&#39;s right.&quot; Aaron chipped in. &quot;They probably just want to give us an easy one first to try and truck us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Sara opened the front door quietly. She peered out into the darkness intently, trying to get the best view she could. She couldn&#39;t see much but she dropped her jaw and audibly gasped at what she did. Eyes, at least four pairs of deep yellow pools, each glowing luminously from the tree line. They all stared intently at the front door. &#702;That&#39;s a really good special effect.&#39; Sara thought as she shut the door and turned back to the conversation.<br />
<br />
Henry rolled his eyes but conceded to Jamie. &quot;Fine, fine. It&#39;s certainly not worth getting worked up over. What do you propose?&quot;<br />
<br />
After Sara told the others about what she had seen out the front door the group worked out a plan. Henry would cause a diversion from the back of the house and Jamie would sneak into the bus and grab the hat. Sara would cover Jamie, and Kelly and Aaron would cover Henry.<br />
<br />
Jamie nodded towards the back door to let Henry know she was ready. Henry opened the back door, walked onto the back porch, and started banging a couple of saucepans from the kitchen together.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is soo stupid.&quot; Henry muttered under his breath. &quot;Werewolves aren&#39;t even real.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie and Sara poked their heads out the front door to see if the glowing eyes were still watching them. They were gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;The coast is clear.&quot; Sara whispered to Jamie as the pair cautiously walked out the door. Sara stayed on the porch as a look-out, just incase something went wrong. Jamie took off towards the bus.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did I get roped into doing the running?&quot; Jamie asked herself as she reached the bus and opened the door. &quot;Ha! See, that wasn&#39;t so bad.&quot; Jamie smiled as she picked up an old brown, wide-brimmed, travelers hat. &quot;It looks like they stole this from Indiana Jones, or Van Helsing or something.&quot; Jamie continued to talk to herself. &quot;Well I&#39;d better head back before Henry gets himself into troub-&quot;<br />
<br />
A dark mass of fur and claws slammed into Jamie from the back of the bus. It&#39;s voice, was deep but still understandable, said: &quot;Ah, Jamie, I was hoping they&#39;d be stupid enough to send Kelly or Aaron, but now that your here, you&#39;ll have to do.&quot; Nate clamped one clawed hand over the blonde&#39;s mouth and bit deeply into her shoulder. Jamie tried to scream but Nate&#39;s large paw-like hand was too much for her and all that came out was a pitiful whimper. Nate&#39;s long teeth cut deeply into her soft flesh, and long strands of saliva flowed into the wound. Just like James had done for him, Nate licked the contusion until it healed over. Jamie stared at him wide eyed until Nate removed his hand from her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not going to kill me?&quot; Jamie shuttered in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No!&quot; Nate looked insulted. &quot;If I killed you how would you be able to enjoy the gift I just gave you? Not to mention I need you to help me turn the others.&quot; Nate finished with a wicked smile that showed off his long, impressive fangs.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wha...W-what should I do now?&quot; Jamie asked, still shaking in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go back to the house. Bring them their prize, and tomorrow night when you turn, come find me.&quot; Nate finished licking his lips. &quot;We&#39;ll have hunting to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie nodded slowly, trying to wrap her head around everything that was happening. She got up and fixed her top as best she could to hide the blood stains and rips. When she opened the door of the bus she saw relief visible on Sara&#39;s face. Standing guard at the front door of the house Sara yelled. &quot;Come on! Henry can&#39;t distract them forever!&quot; Jamie looked back at Nate and took in his changes; ones she too would be going through soon enough. He was big, with deep yellow eyes and an intimidating presence. Nate&#39;s thick black fur coated every inch of his body but did little to hide his large, powerful, muscles. A long furry tail completed his new look, and he gave off an air of confidence and raw power. Jamie felt for a moment that perhaps becoming a werewolf wouldn&#39;t be so bad.<br />
<br />
Slamming the bus door closed Jamie ran for the house as fast as she could. Sara held the house door open until Jamie was safely inside, then slammed it shut. &quot;I&#39;ve got it! I&#39;ve got it!&quot; Jamie shouted for the others to hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;WOOHOO!&quot; Sara pumped her fists to the sky. &quot;Suck it werewolves! We win!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly and Aaron were quick to pull Henry back inside once it was clear they didn&#39;t need him for a distraction anymore.<br />
<br />
The whole crew was ecstatic about completing the first challenge so easily. They cracked open beer and wine celebrating their victory.<br />
<br />
Jamie did her best to fit in with the rest, but deep down she knew her life was going to change forever. She had been cursed through Nate&#39;s bite, the bite of the werewolf. She knew she wouldn&#39;t change until tomorrow night, but she could already feel it, her own beast within.</p>
