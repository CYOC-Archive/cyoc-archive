<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You stood there, almost dumbly as your wife gave a predatory glare to Elizabeth and then approached you. You then felt yourself being pulled into a tight hug and with your upper body being bent over the swell of your wife&#39;s womb and you could feel the bottom of your breasts press against the top of her womb and compress against your wife&#39;s breasts. You mouth was was then quickly invaded by her tongue. You gave half of a blink at being kissed, but after a few moments, you began to kiss her back. It rapidly became rather passionate but didn&#39;t last very long.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry you got pulled into our politics,&quot; Selene said to you, &quot;I actually wish I could have told you sooner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never should have gone onto that beach,&quot; you commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably,&quot; Selene commented and then held your head in her hands, &quot;but we sirens have powerful pheromones and magical aura that attracts people to us. Unless you were fully aware of it, few can avoid it altogether. Even the boy who named us couldn&#39;t entirely... though he managed to avoid getting in the water.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you don&#39;t blame me?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not, sweetheart,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;I love you too much for that. And I know you love me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot; Elizabeth asked after a moment. You looked to her and noticed a half surprised, shocked, and almost hurt face as she seemed to been on the receiving end of your wife&#39;s temper, which you had never seen so agitated before.<br />
<br />
Selene released you from her hug and rubbed her head for a moment before giving a very heavy sigh. Eventually she looked to Elizabeth directly before addressing her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Liz, I don&#39;t blame you,&quot; Selene spoke, &quot;If I blame anyone it&#39;s Florencia. She acts motherly and caring and yes she has worked to keep us hidden from humanity... but it&#39;s all aimed at keeping herself the head-sister of the local sisterhood. The result is that while she can be a stickler for the rules, some of which aren&#39;t always necessary... and my relationship with Michelle as Michael proves that we can get around them... if it means her own advancement, she&#39;s not above breaking the rules. If she didn&#39;t tell you about my banishment from the sisterhood, then you all likely did think Mike was prey to the sisterhood and you had a right to change or eat him, which is a violation of our own rules, because by then I had become my own sisterhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Selene,&quot; Elizabeth&#39;s smile returned and she bounced into your wife&#39;s arms, &quot;can I join you? Be your sister again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Selene only hugged her back, &quot;Of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, thank you,&quot; Elizabeth spoke, &quot;I still can&#39;t believe she threw you out and never told us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She didn&#39;t like that I called her out on something and went above her head to do it,&quot; Selene sighed, &quot;but now... now we might be able to get Florencia to either step down or leave me be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me? Is there any way I can be a man again?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Both Elizabeth and your wife looked to you, though with fairly different faces. Elizabeth looked hurt and almost fearful. It was clear that she had bonded to you rather closely in your short time together, and a part of you felt hurt at the prospect of her hurting, but that still combated with the fact that you didn&#39;t want to be a creature that preyed on people for a living. Selene, however, looked determined.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;I can&#39;t, as I wasn&#39;t involved in your transformation, and while Elizabeth may have contributed, she didn&#39;t do so alone... and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it was Florencia who cast the spell and that anything the rest of you did was after the spell that transformed my husband had been cast...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only one who can turn you back is Florencia,&quot; Elizabeth told you, &quot;and since your wife is a head-sister of her own sisterhood, she can report Florencia to the local Council of Sisterhoods and they can then Florencia to change you back or punish her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Local council? You mean sirens don&#39;t have one singular government?&quot; you wonder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, there is no &quot;Atlantis&quot; or great underwater city,&quot; Selene told you, &quot;There are sirens all over the world, but because we&#39;ve traditionally depended on having lusty men around to feed on, we&#39;ve been a very coastline people. We don&#39;t go into the open ocean. The times when sirens have, it&#39;s because we were trailing sailing vessels. The result is that we govern ourselves in groups of sisterhoods in small areas  with special Councils of Sisterhoods to supervise each group of sisterhoods.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... you&#39;ve collected human clothing... couldn&#39;t you have figured out some communications device?&quot; you wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humanity has yet to perfect electrical devices that can function perfectly under water,&quot; Selene gave a laugh, &quot;and magic is out as among sirens, our magic is only there to help us feed or in your case to make new sisters. And it largely works out well enough and is shaped because mermaids... sirens... NEED to be close to our normal food supply...&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave a half sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though, with what I found with you, that could very well change... as we move out of the water only to go to it when we want to swim and find true love,&quot; Selene mused, &quot;we&#39;d still be dependent on humanity for food... but it&#39;d no longer be a case of us having to drain people... and our lovers would go on living with us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is why we&#39;ll be going to the our local Council first thing tomorrow,&quot; Selene sighed, &quot;by rule, they should force Florencia to turn you back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anyway she can weasel out of it?&quot; you ask nervously, &quot;or forces them to keep me as a siren?&quot;<br />
<br />
Selene gave a heavy sigh, &quot;The only thing she can really try is to argue that since I never reported myself as a new head-sister in this area because of my pregnancy that I would still qualify as an exile and thus can&#39;t formally make such a challenge. The only other possibility were things could go bad for you is if they rule that because your transformation occurred BEFORE I give birth that while they can punish Florencia, they can&#39;t allow your return to human form as you wouldn&#39;t be seen as a member of our community as a human male. That will ONLY happen after I give birth... which I haven&#39;t done yet, and even if I give birth tonight, your transformation still preceded it. Which would mean that a person outside our community learned of us. They will certainly agree that Michael is worthy of us, but because I hadn&#39;t given birth, transforming Michelle back to Michael would restore a human male not considered part of our community... and they&#39;d then decide to punish Florencia for transforming you but would mandate that you remain Michelle and part of my sisterhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched as Selene shed a tear at the prospect of that.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that can&#39;t happen... I love you too much,&quot; Selene spoke, on the verge of crying, apparently pregnancy had hormonal effects on mermaids just as easily as it had on human women.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be there for you both if that happens,&quot; Elizabeth offered, &quot;you found one way to avoid draining people, Selene, perhaps you&#39;ll find another.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There will never be another man like Michael,&quot; Selene answered and pulled you into a hug.<br />
<br />
You stroked her hair, hoping that would calm her down, as you didn&#39;t know what to do. In fact seeing Selene hurt by this seemed to hurt far more than your guilt at what you had done after leaving the beach. You had to comfort her... because she was your wife... and your sister. Your mind didn&#39;t even question yourself when that thought went through it. You kept your focus on trying to make Selene feel better.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can get through this, Selene,&quot; was all you can say, &quot;we can get through this.&quot;</p>
