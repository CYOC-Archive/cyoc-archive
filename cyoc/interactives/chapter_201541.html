<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;The contest is quite simple.&quot; Beldazarr said as their surroundings start to morph into an old roman arena. &quot;You will have to do a few tasks. The one who do it first or better wins each round. Win 3 rounds and triumph is yours!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do it.&quot; Mike cockily said as he flexed his arm muscles. &quot;I&#39;m in better shape than this moron, I&#39;m definitely going to win this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is not that easy, young man. Each challenge requires more wit than strength, so I advise you to don&#39;t be so overconfident.&quot; Beldazarr crossed his arms while he used a magic glance to change Mike and Drake&#39;s attires into roman soldier ones. &quot;Each of you will get a tiny bit of my power that you can use to change your opponent&#39;s body. You can use this power only once per round, so be wise when and how to use it. After the round is over, any transformation on you will fade away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike didn&#39;t seem to confident right now, a concerned look can be seen in his face and when he stared at Drake, he noticed that his opponent was as concerned as him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready? Your first tasks is to climb to the top of a giant sequoia tree.&quot; Beldazarr said before a huge tree emerged from the middle of the arena. &quot;The first one to reach its top wins.&quot;<br />
<br />
Almost immediately and while Drake was still thinking about a plan, Mike used his magic on that turn to change his opponent. He pointed at Drake with a wicked grin while a red beam came out his finger and hit Drake. &quot;Turn into a whale!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake didn&#39;t have time to react and was directly hit by Mike&#39;s magic. In a matter of second his body mass multiplied as crazy until his body almost covered half of the arena. Of course, his arms and legs turned into find, followed by the other necessary changes to turn him into a giant blue whale. He tried to yell at Mike, but his massive mouth can only make weird whale sounds.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Mike took his advantage to start climbing the tree, he didn&#39;t even care to watch how Drake turned into a giant aquatic mammal. However, after his initial freaking out, Drake took his time to make a better plan. He tried to move his massive body, but soon found out he was very limited. He can&#39;t stand up, much less climb a tree.<br />
<br />
Drake knew he needed to think outside of the box if he wants to get a chance to win. So, he focused on what he wanted to do to Mike and channeled his magic beam towards him. A blue magic beam came out from his huge whale eye and hit Mike, making him fall to the ground in the process. Unlike his rival, Drake didn&#39;t have intention to completely immobilize Mike, but he also didn&#39;t want to make it easy for him either.<br />
<br />
A small thud could be heard after Mike hit the ground, however Beldazarr immediately noticed that the young man was nowhere to be seen. There it was just a pile of Mike&#39;s clothes. After a few seconds, a small lump started to move and from it emerged a pretty tiny and naked Mike who was terrified of becoming a few inches tall.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems this challenge is going to take a while.&quot; Beldazarr said to himself while he watched a the giant blue whale swaying side to side and the tiny human desperately trying to climb a root. &quot;Maybe I should stablish a few extra rules.&quot; The genie though before he let out a loud snore. But what he didn&#39;t know is that Drake actually had a plan, he wasn&#39;t just swaying, he was trying to knock the tree down.<br />
<br />
Using his newly got weight, Drake managed to push the tree several times until it started to fall. Mike who had managed to climb a foot, was crying at the idea of getting crushed by the tree or the giant animal while the plant was falling to the ground.<br />
<br />
The apparently impossible task for Mike turned quite easier than he thought and after rolling for a moment, he finally managed to touch the tree&#39;s top. It was a victory for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done, boy. That was a clever way to use your transformation in your advantage.&quot; Beldazarr said as he clapped a few times. &quot;I can say it&#39;s my first time watching a whale moving like you did. I must admit I&#39;m impressed.&quot; Then he pointed at both guys and they returned to normal, except they were now naked. &quot;Oh, I forgot to say, you can&#39;t repeat magic you&#39;ve already used. So, you can&#39;t use animal transformation nor size changing again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WTF?!! dude what happened to your groin?!!&quot;  Mike shouted while he pointed at Drake&#39;s crotch, when he looked down he noticed that his genitals had disappeared and a weird slit had taken their place. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s another thing I forgot to say. Despite I can restore your bodies almost completely, your genitals won&#39;t return to normal. Something it was decided for our ancestors to spice up things for our viewers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Viewers? Is someone watching us?&quot; Drake asked as he tried to don&#39;t freak out about his new genitals. &quot;Not exactly, they aren&#39;t watching you but reading what is happening with you.&quot; Beldazarr said as he broke the fourth wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, they know I...&quot; Mike said before he looked down and noticed his own altered genitals. &quot;Aaaaahhh!!! My dick and balls!!! They&#39;re minuscule!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, they are. You were a few inches tall a moment ago. So, you&#39;re keeping that size for your genitals.&quot; Beldazarr said with a big smile on his face. &quot;Ok, enough of this. Let&#39;s begin the next round. Prepare yourselves!&quot;</p>
