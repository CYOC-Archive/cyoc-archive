<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#8301;If she had her way, Rachel probably would&#39;ve spent the entire rest of the day like this, immersed halfway into the lake as she utterly ravaged her girlfriend. The aroma, and oh god the taste, it was positively enthralling. Rachel wasn&#39;t sure how long she spent super-licking at Naomi&#39;s nethers before, in a sudden, violent jerking motion, the speedster was hurled off her shoulders and splashed into the water below, as if repulsed by some magnetic force. Shocking though it was, Rachel couldn&#39;t help but let out a hearty laugh. &quot;What&#39;s wrong, babe, couldn&#39;t handle it?&quot; Her smile remained up until Naomi floated back up with a worried expression and lifted her legs out of the water.<br />
<br />
They were fusing together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... what the...&quot; She started to take a step over towards Naomi, only to find herself stumbling as her own legs suddenly snapped up against each other. Panic and confusion now ramping up within her, the young heroine acted fast, shifting from walking to flying as she floated over to pick up Naomi. She tried to fly up, hoping to rip them out of the water, only to find some ethereal force yanking them right back under the surface, where they now both flailed in desperation. Letting out panicked breathes, Rachel lost track of Naomi, leaving her with little to focus on but her second bodily change for the day.<br />
<br />
All the super-strength in her muscles couldn&#39;t pull apart what used to be her legs, now one long, tapered limb that was rapidly losing definition. She retained her hourglass figure, at least, but below the waistline it was all starting to turn into almost an explanation mark sort of shape. The only difference was that, as her knees vanished and the single limb pulled out to a much greater length, her feet weren&#39;t forming a point. They were flattening out, becoming a wide wedge shape... almost like a tailfin.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t quite want to believe it, but a set of gills ripping open on her neck just confirmed what seemed to be happening. She had, after all, seen this shape before - Naomi and Rachel were both close friends with Stacy Kekoa, better known to the world as Undertow, the teenage mermaid superhero. Rachel had always thought that her friend&#39;s multicolored tail and magical abilities were awfully cool - it was just that she&#39;d never expected nor especially wanted to <i>be</i> a mermaid herself. Didn&#39;t seem like she had a choice now.<br />
<br />
As the tail truly took shape, she was at least briefly dazzled by the sight of iridescent spots of material forming up and down the powerful limb. The scales being magically formed actually matched her outfit: black for the most part, but with subtly red patterns running vertically from where the tail began out to its tip. A similiar red coloration was distinctly visible in the semi-transparent membrane of her tailfin, as well as the fins that sprouted from her hips and at the middle where her knees used to be. She had to admit, it was striking, dramatic, a beautiful tail if she had actually wanted a tail.<br />
<br />
There was one more change in store as her tail finished its creation: a little surge of energy up to her chest. This wasn&#39;t exactly an element she took umbrage with - on the contrary, she found herself rather excited as the magic propelled her bust up another three or four cup sizes. It was... borderline comical now, sure, but damn if it didn&#39;t feel wonderful giving those pillows a squeeze. The sheer deformation of the fatty tissue under her grip affirmed that she still had her strength and durability, at least - after a moment, she was at last able to fly up out of the water and back to the shore, confirming that the rest of her powers were intact.<br />
<br />
Just as intact seemed to be Naomi&#39;s powers - because she looked up to find that a vortex was being formed by something doing laps around the lake at an utterly insane speed. She finally got to see her girlfriend&#39;s new body when the other super-mer dashed out of the water and up onto the beach, breathing heavy as her tail flopped agianst the sand. Unlike the scales of Rachel&#39;s tail, Naomi&#39;s seemed to be covered in a sleek, shiny, almost spandex-like material, with frilly fins replaced by angular and extremely hydrodynamic protrusions. The white tail, with its black geometric patterns and their light blue highlights, was evocative of two things: a spaceship, and sheer goddamn <i>speed</i>.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, so...&quot; Rachel was about to launch into an apology, only to be cut off as Naomi pounced, throwing arms around her and dragging her into a kiss. Her hands couldn&#39;t help but trail down to what used to be her ass, where she realized that, while Naomi hadn&#39;t gained any mass on her chest, she now had the most shapely ass in the entire world integrated into her tail, begging to be squeezed and groped at. Their tails wrapped up before they managed to pull apart from each other, staring into one another&#39;s eyes with lust that had only been heightened by their transformation. Part of Rachel wanted to just accept it all and keep making love to her girlfriend... but they had to find a solution first.<br />
<br />
For good reason, as the heroine quietly pointed out. &quot;Our moms are gonna kill us if they find us like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi sighed. &quot;Yeah. Damnit.&quot; She rolled back over onto her back, flopping over to where she&#39;d left her phone at the lakeside. &quot;I&#39;ll text Stacy. She might know what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
That seemed like their best bet. The speedster quickly fired off a message to their friend - and then as they waited, she returned to embrace her girlfriend once again, tails getting entwined and arms wrapping around each other. They were only disturbed from this passionate display by the sound of water rushing; both girls lifted up their heads to find that the water next to them was warping, sparkling as a magical rift in spacetime opened and spat out a girl who they&#39;d both definitely had a crush on at some point. <br />
<br />
And who could blame them? Stacy was an absolute dream: the polynesian girl had an upper body that had been kissed by the sun, her dark olive skin always glistening almost as much as the rainbow of colors in her long, flowing tail. Said tail curled around as she studied the pair with compassion-filled dark eyes, her long black hair flowing down to just barely cover up a bust that rivaled even Rachel&#39;s. A smile crossed her plump lips, one hand adjusting the flowery crown upon her head as she spoke up in that sweet, adoring voice. &quot;Didn&#39;t you girls ever learn to stay away from enchanted lakes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We did now,&quot; Naomi groaned. &quot;Stacy, please... you can fix this, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
She mocked a look of offense. &quot;I don&#39;t think mertails are a thing that need fixing, speedbutt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I mean.&quot; Naomi sighed. &quot;If our moms find us turned into mermaids, they&#39;re gonna have a fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already sort of broke a bed earlier,&quot; Rachel chimed in.<br />
<br />
Stacy raised an eyebrow. &quot;Oh shit... you have powers now? AND you two are dating?&quot; She let out a long sigh. &quot;Fiiiiiiiiinally! Jesus, I thought I was going to have to date one of you myself just to get the other jealous!&quot; Rachel had to bite back the urge to ask if they could all just date regardless - this new form was kind of amping up the old libido. &quot;Anyway - getting you back to being human. So, here&#39;s the skinny on that...&quot;</p>
