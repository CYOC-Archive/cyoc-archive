<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After thinking about her options, Janet decided that she wanted to see what being a classic nerd was like.  She would be intelligent, shy, and yet still quite cute.  She thought hard about what she wanted her life to be like, picturing the image of her behind a nerd.  The amulet shined bright, and her transformation started.<br />
<br />
After the amulet shone bright...nothing happened?  Janet sighed; she knew her life wouldn&#39;t change this easily.  “Aw…  It didn’t work!” she said in complete defeat, “That old man really gypped me.  At least it was for free.”  As Janet was complaining, she didn&#39;t notice that she had become much thinner, or that her hair was beginning to darken.<br />
<br />
When she looked at the mirror again, Janet now noticed she was definitely changing and it was a little bit shocking.  She had become shorter, and her hair seemed to shrink down as well.  It was also much darker than before.  Her red sweater seemed to be shrinking, as well as rolling up her body.  It was strange seeing her smaller body in the mirror like this.<br />
<br />
Janet was now super embarrassed! Her sweater has now near her neck, exposing her conservative bra! She hated it when anyone saw her like this...was she always this shy?  Meanwhile, her hair had turned black. Trying out a new life might be fun, but transforming was scary!<br />
<br />
She immediately blinked her eyes, thinking that they were being a little itchy.  As Janet opened her eyes and looked in the mirror, she was mildly surprised.  Her eyes had become slanted, like someone of Asian descent.  Her sweater had formed an adorable red scarf, while half of a white dress shirt began to appear around her chest.  She started to get a minor headache as information began to flood into her brain, equations and science terms filling her old mind.  Even homework she had trouble remembering was now a breeze for her.  She felt so much... smarter?<br />
<br />
Suring the change, her vision was getting blurry and she couldn’t focus.  Janet was having trouble seeing until a pair large round glasses appeared she could see perfectly.  Her hair Style changed, becoming slightly longer and far straighter, giving her a very tidy appearance.  Her stockings grew up her legs, covering them fully now, while her white dress shirt was now complete, covering up her chest.  New memories continued to flow in, thoughts of working hard for class, and hiding away from the &quot;cool kids&quot;.  She was so easily embarrassed, she didn&#39;t like people looking at her...still, she had some very close friends who shared her interests.<br />
<br />
In a matter of seconds, Janet&#39;s transformation was now complete.  A cute beret and sweater vest appeared on her, giving her a cute but very conservative look.  She was now at the top of her class, but her shy nature gave her some trouble when it came to making friends.  She felt so embarrassed.  She&#39;d have to go to school now, and see all those people...still, as nervous as she was, she didn&#39;t feel unhappy.  In fact, she felt great.  She was smart, and knew nothing could keep her down... except maybe asking someone out.  Maybe Janet would be happiest like this?  Only time could tell...<br />
<br />
Just then the world around her started to blur like it’s in a painting as everything was rearranged.  When it was over, she noticed that she was in a room that she wasn’t familiar with, but her newly created memories made her think that it was her new room.  It looked like that of a Japanese bedroom for teens as she has books on her desk for her to study, a plain bed with a few stuffed animals, and a window showcasing what appears to be the city of Otaku, Japan.  Looking around, she spotted what appears to be a student ID on the desk and picked it up to investigate.  That’s when she saw her picture on it with a name on top.  Turns out, she was no longer Janet, but instead Mika Jinogo.<br />
<br />
More memories ran through her mind.  She remembered being born with a high IQ, that she studied at home to improve her intelligence till she was 14, that she go to school and reached highest in the educational board and would soon be graduating to go to a high class university.  Starring at this ID, she said, “Looks like I’m no longer Janet anymore.”  She then placed her hand to her throat and was caught by surprise.  Turns out that not only her voice had changed, but also she’s now speaking in Japanese.  She can’t even pronounce anything that was in English as she didn’t think that would happen.  “Whoa…  That’s new, really need to get use to that.”  As soon as Mika finished with what she was saying, she heard the voice of her new mother downstairs.  “Mika, it’s getting late.  Get downstairs and have your breakfast quickly.  You don’t want to be late for school.  Realizing that she was late, she turned to her new mother and said, “Coming!”<br />
<br />
She then took her amulet out of her scarf and was amazed that this little trinket can actually do all of that.  It would seem that this new life would be an interesting one.  But what to do with this new life?  Should she keep it and see how this life is like for a highly intellectual Asian teen or use the amulet to change back or alter something else about herself?</p>
