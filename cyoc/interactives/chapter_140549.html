<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The life guard was too preoccupied getting everyone out of the pool area to notice anything going on.<br />
 <br />
The moment Andy had breathed in the mist, All of the other mist in the surrounding area dissipated.  It was as if all the other mist took off in search of others far away. <br />
<br />
Andy&#39;s cock however had grown to a formidable size, threatening to destroy his swim drunks. Overcome, by pleasure Andy couldn&#39;t move. It was too late for him. He was already becoming something more.<br />
<br />
Matt took off towards Andy when mist invaded his body. He heard his friend scream out. He thought it was in pain, but he&#39;d soon learn that was wrong.<br />
<br />
John and Harvey tried to run to Andy as well, but they got caught up in the crowd heading in the other direction and were pushed out the gates.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Okay I got you&quot; Matt  said reaching down to get Andy off of the chair. He pulled his hand away quickly though because Andy&#39;s body was hot.<br />
<br />
Andy&#39;s dick had also grown and hefty nuts to support new sperm production. His enhanced balls were much more efficient than before. They were flooding his body with testosterone they had begun to produce thanks to the mist.<br />
  <br />
Andy&#39;s dick started growing again as his nuts went to work. It ripped open his shorts, causing Matt to fall back on his ass. <br />
<br />
Andy&#39;s body started expanding in the chair. His Pecs ballooned out and his abs formed into and 8 pack. Andy&#39;s ass added on muscle while his legs thicken. He face became more chiseled as a facial hair started to form.<br />
<br />
When it looked like the end Matt moved back over to Andy. The 19 year no longer looked like a 19 old boy however, but a studly late 20&#39;s man. His eyes were shut, but his breathing was heaving. Matt heard him whimpering as the last of the growth took effect.  Andy&#39;s nuts still seemed to be a work, producing  enriched testosterone, sounds could be heard when they shook lightly.<br />
<br />
Matt studied his friend hardly any bit of him seemed familiar. Matt traced a hand over Andy&#39;s pecs and found a scar that had been made when they were both 12. Matt breathed a sigh of relief , resting his hand over Andy&#39;s heart.<br />
<br />
Andy&#39;s eyes shot open. He grabbed Matt&#39;s hand .<br />
<br />
Then he started cumming.  Long ropes of cum shot directly up into the hair.  Matt looked gasping in horror as the cum rained down on him and Andy. The cum landed in their hair, coated their bodies. quite a lot of it found t way into Matt&#39;s open mouth. <br />
<br />
As Andy released Matt&#39;s hand. Matt started coughing .<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck dude !?!&quot; Matt shouted, trying to spit out the cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I don&#39;t know what came over me&quot; Andy said shocked by the manly voice that came out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
Matt was shocked too, but then he heard a grumble in his stomach. Both of the men looked at Matt&#39;s stomach both were surprised at the pot belly he was now sporting.<br />
<br />
Matt cautiously placed a hand on his stomach. He was scared that he hadn&#39;t even noticed the weight he was carrying.  What he though was a little bit of cum had actually been a generous amount, that found it too easy into his mouth. Matt felt the cum shift around in his stomach as he moved his hand over it. It made him feel a bit sick knowing it was all  from his transformed best friend.<br />
<br />
The cum in Matt&#39;s stomach moved around,  trying to get digested faster and get absorbed fully into Matt. The cum seemed to have as much of a mission as the Mist did.<br />
<br />
Andy and Matt both seemed scared when Matt&#39;s stomach responded to his touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Andy... plz tell me this is not a baby,&quot; Matt said pretending to be calm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it, man&quot; Andy said getting up from the chair. Matt was to preoccupied with his stomach, but Andy watched as his virile seed that had landed on Matt, seeped into his skin and hair. Matt kept muttering something at his stomach. He didn&#39;t notice how vibrant his hair got or the hair that started to grow on his arms and legs.<br />
<br />
Andy grabbed his long fat cock and started stroking, watching as his friend started growing.<br />
<br />
Matt looked over to Andy &quot;Are you masturbating to me ?&quot;  Matt still hadn&#39;t noticed his changes, he thought Andy was turned on due to the cum he put in Matt&#39;s stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I&#39;m just so horny now. My balls are aching to release, but I didn&#39;t want to do anything to you. So I grabbed my cock to take control of the situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt was about to say something, when a noticeable portion of his pot belly shrunk at once. He fell on his knees to the ground. &quot;Ahhh&quot; his dick jumped, expanding in his own swim trunks. Another portion disappeared from his stomach and his nuts ballooned out too. He realized he was soon going to be naked like Andy.<br />
<br />
Andy was so worried for Matt. He wanted to go to Matt side, as Matt had done for him, but he had to cum now! So he stood in front of Matt jerking off. <br />
<br />
The rest of the Andy cum in Matt&#39;s stomach was used to start making Matt&#39;s muscles grow. It was then aided by Matt&#39;s own testosterone he was producing. As Matt grew into a handsome well stacked man, His cock burst through his trunks, spilling his seed on the poolside concrete. <br />
<br />
When he was done cumming, Matt raised his head to tell Andy it was over. That&#39;s when Andy came all over him again.</p>
