<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Kim rubbed Mary Lou could feel the changes beginning to course through her body. Her belly dragged against the floor as her body slowly shrank and contracted.  She flexed her claw, and felt her digits changing, becoming longer, thinner, and more flexible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, that&#39;s odd, &quot; said Kim behind her, her voice deeper than Mary Lou remembered.  She sucked in few deep breaths.  &quot;My shirt is a little tight.  Actually, my shorts are, too.  I wonder if this shampoo is shrinking my clothes.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Mary Lou smiled.  She knew Kim was changing, too, and soon she would have a new sister. She closed her eyes, enjoying the changes occurring in her body.  Kim&#39;s arm resting on her back began to feel heavier.  She could feel Kim&#39;s hand expanding and stretching larger as it rested on her back.  Sharp claws poked her back, and she jumped a little.  Kim looked down and saw the changes on her hand.  Understandably, she was upset, and immediately jumped off of Mary Lou&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, what&#39;s happening to my hand! &quot; screamed Kim. <br />
<br />
But Mary Lou wasn&#39;t done with her yet.  She needed more contact.  With her new flexible back, she turned and grabbed Kim&#39;s bare calf.  She could already see green scales developing on her skin, and could feel them hardening and becoming tough under her grasp.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t do that, &quot; said Kim in shock, surprised by the flexibility of the large alligator.<br />
<br />
 She stared at her calf under Mary Lou&#39;s grip, wet and covered with soapy suds.  As she watched her calves and thighs began to get thicker and longer.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What......what are you doing?&quot; said Kim softly, and she weakly tried to shake free of Mary Lou&#39;s grip.<br />
<br />
With her free hand, Mary Lou slipped the muzzle off of her shrinking snout.  &quot;Shhh.  It will all be over soon.  Just relax, and enjoy it, &quot; said Mary Lou soothingly.<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s eyes went wide.  She had no idea that Mary Lou was capable of speech, much less intelligent conversation.  She was too shocked to fight Mary Lou&#39;s grip.<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s calf was soon too large for Mary Lou to grip, and she had to settle for just touching it.  They both heard a ripping sound, and watched as Kim&#39;s feet tore through her shoes, growing longer and thicker.  The long black claws extending from her toes had shredded her socks.  The change was enough to spur Kim into action.  She kicked away from Mary Lou, and began to back away from her, dragging her butt along the floor.    <br />
<br />
Mary Lou watched the girl with amusement.  Her bright red hair was falling out in clumps, revealing a bald green head.  Her mouth was filled with sharp jagged teeth, and she could see her nose flattening against her mouth as it stretched into a snout.  The girl was fighting it, but it was too late.<br />
<br />
Mary Lou stood up, now finally able to stand digitigrade again.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, now.  I am not going to hurt you, &quot; she said, as she advanced towards the girl, shrinking a little with each step.  <br />
<br />
The girl in turn was growing, stretching her clothes tightly against her massive body.  Several rips and tears had formed across the garments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those clothes are too tight.  It looks like it hurts.  Here, let me help you out of them, &quot; said Mary Lou.<br />
<br />
Kim continued to back away, scooting her butt across the floor.  But she suddenly stopped and turned on her side.  A large tail was sprouting from her back, and it made it impossible for her to move that way.  Mary Lou took advantage of Kim&#39;s awkwardness, and quickly reached her.  She grabbed Kim&#39;s shorts and pulled, ripping them off as they tore down the seams.  Kim tried to cover herself, but Mary Lou saw that it made no difference now.  Her entire pelvis and abdomen was covered in thick leathery skin. Her freckles had been replaced with white scales on her green skin.  Only her cloaca was visible.  The young girl had nothing to be ashamed of.<br />
<br />
Mary Lou grabbed the girl, and pulled her to her feet.  It wasn&#39;t easy - they were now both about the same height and weight.  It didn&#39;t help that the girl kept trying to stand on her heels, rather than the balls of her feet.  Eventually the girl got it, and began to steady herself.  Her shirt was barely hanging on, attached by a few threads that groaned as Kim&#39;s chest continued to grow wider.  Mary Lou ripped the remains of her shirt off, and they watched as her small breasts receded into her chest.  Thick scales grew over her nipples, leaving her with a smooth reptilian chest.  Finally, her transformation was over.<br />
<br />
Kim looked at Mary Lou, then at herself.  She examined her clawed hands, thick scaly abdomen, and muscular  thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What.....what am I?&quot; said Kim softly, as she continued to look over her strange new body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what you are, &quot; said Mary Lou, as she placed her hand on Kim&#39;s shoulder warmly.  &quot;You are beautiful, sister.&quot;</p>
