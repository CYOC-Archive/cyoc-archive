<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Gotcha now whatever ya are!&quot; Said one of the grounds keepers who happened to be a <br />
woman, gender did nothing to protect her when Marcy bite into her hand and took off <br />
running again, remembering her job of keeping the rest of the grounds keepers distracted <br />
until she was given the new signal to lead them inside. She liked this game. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Bart frowned slightly when he heard no less than four dares.  He  was standing behind the <br />
men next to the door he had opened for his little brother, much as Jenny was on he <br />
opposite end of the house for Marcy. <br />
<br />
While he was pleased that Adam's destiny was sealed, (and he was taking it with strange <br />
enthusiasm), he really hoped this wasn't a sign of things to come. If it was, they might <br />
have to throw in some intimidation tactics. Too many Dares could ruins Bart's now <br />
carefully laid out strategy.   Oh yes they needed some Dared humans for the time being if <br />
the estate was to continue to legally function, but they also needed some transform for <br />
the sake of the pack as well.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Master has instructed me to inform you that the position of grounds keeper at this estate <br />
no longer exists,&quot;   In spite of their maddening situation did indeed gasp in horror at the <br />
idea of losing their precious jobs.  <br />
<br />
While the number was bigger than expected, Martha did as she had been told and began <br />
the instructions she had been given. &quot;You four men are Dared to serve and obey the <br />
Master Jesen, Big Bad Wolf Alpha Male, loyally and totally and the pack. In fact you shall be <br />
more than that, or less than that depending on your point of view. Whenever in a business <br />
or economic or political situation related to the estate, you'll act the way Masters Bart and <br />
Jenny would regardless if you know what that is yourself. You shall be unto their shadow <br />
puppets outside the estate. You shall not think about doing differently, nor shall you think <br />
about thinking about acting differently.   Your individual thoughts and individual identities <br />
serve but one purpose and one purpose only, to keep up the pretense that you're still <br />
people and not merely extensions of Master Bart and Master Jenny's wills which is precisely <br />
all you are. Any name you have is only what people call you and what you respond to, it is <br />
not yours, you have no real names. You shall do nothing that'll endanger or expose the <br />
pack or the game, nor shall you engage in any personal activities sans for your physical <br />
health that aren't related to the status of the estate and it's holdings. You shall report to <br />
Master Bart and Master Jenny in all matters. You have no selves, your selves are but echoes <br />
of Master Bart and Master Jenny.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four men stiffened and stood at attention, assuming proper and formal business like <br />
posture. They then marched like robots out of the staff foyer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where are they going?&quot; Kevin asked. <br />
<br />
Bart answered, &quot;Upstairs to the office and to the filing room. To memorize every file and <br />
every record, then they'll wash and shave, go to the wardrobe, toss their old clothes in the <br />
garbage, and dress in some of my old business suits. Then half of them will begin <br />
organizing our surplus items for resale, while the rest begin applying for the proper <br />
business licenses they'll need.&quot; <br />
<br />
Adam turned around and finally noticed Bart behind him. Of course he had no idea this <br />
was his employer until yesterday. <br />
<br />
Kevin asked speaking across with Adam in the middle. &quot;How do ya know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because that's what I'd do in their situation.&quot; Bart answered smugly. &quot;Of course I'll have to <br />
look over their shoulders to make sure how effective the Dare's details were... &quot;<br />
<br />
Adam stood rather transfixed and to be frank, a little horrified, he had always loved the <br />
idea of werewolves. And he had loved the idea of furries just as much. He had honestly <br />
always enjoyed learning about wolves, the distant ancestor of the dogs.  'Heck, when I <br />
heard about the rumors of a transformation game I was half hoping I could use it!' Adam <br />
hadn't really thought about how it would look on his driver's license of he was turned into <br />
a wolf man, but who cared? It would have been really really REALLY cool!  But seeing four <br />
fellow employees effectively reduced to empty puppets had been just the glass of cold <br />
water he needed to wake up to reality. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'VE CHANGED MY MIND!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Too late.&quot; Martha said having been versed on the rules of the game at breakfast, (she still <br />
only had one stomach so she could speak and eat at the same time). &quot;Once you've given <br />
your answer you can't take it back. And don't worry, we aren't going to turn you into one <br />
of those business zombies.&quot; Martha said in a calm, Vulcan style voice.  &quot;The master has <br />
much greater plans for you Adam. We're all very happy you chose Transform. You're going <br />
to be our security and our eyes and ears. <br />
<br />
&quot;You shall transform into a seven and half year old big bad wolf female cub named Alice in <br />
heart and mind but keep your adult wits. You will love and obey the pack and the master <br />
Jensen the big bad wolf, your new father in all things and never shall your love for the pack <br />
and master/father fault nor shall your loyalty.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the real world your body will look like it's made of solid glass, but you shall be <br />
indestructible and want for nothing physically nor shall you mind in the least.  You shall <br />
be able to enter mirrors with all the surface tension of water. When inside world within <br />
mirrors you shall appear to those outside the mirrors as a ghostly transparent flesh and <br />
blood wolf girl. You shall be able to travel between mirrors within a fraction of the time it <br />
would take to move between them in the real world. You'll be able to peak over the mirror <br />
frames. You can pull others into the world of mirrors with you, those who aren't part of <br />
the Big Bad Wolf pack already will turn into creatures like you, unbreakable little girl living <br />
glass wolves in the real world, and ghostly appearing flesh and blood wolf girls to those <br />
looking inside the mirrors who shall also love and obey the master and pack and in turn <br />
listen to you. If a mirror is shattered with you in it or partially through, you shall not be <br />
harmed in any way and that doorway will simply be closed. Every mirror in the universe <br />
would have be gone for you to have no way back into the real world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam gasped, of all the transformation that they could throw at him, that hadn't been one <br />
he had been expecting in the least!<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-WHAT?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry Adam.&quot; Martha's heads said, &quot;I'll take care of you and look after you like I do <br />
all the pups now and anyone you wish to turn into a playmate. I'll do my best to make sure <br />
you're happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're killing me.&quot; Adam said slowly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Think of it as a rebirth.&quot;  Martha assured him to absolutely no effect. <br />
<br />
Adam gasped as he noticed the room was getting larger. No, more than that. So where his <br />
clothes! Wait! No! He was shrinking! <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah man! No! No! No! No!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at it this way Adam, you're being given a much higher purpose than you ever had <br />
before.&quot; Martha told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I liked my old purpose!&quot; Adam declared, noticing his voice was turning shrill.<br />
<br />
Blond fur began to cover his entire body as his bones shifted position. Adam looked at <br />
himself and in spite of himself said, &quot;Curiouser and curiouser.&quot; <br />
<br />
That was when Adam's transformation took a turn for the strange. In the blind of an eye, <br />
his entire body was made out of glass, more than that, so where his clothes! But as his <br />
body continued to grow smaller, his clothes shattered. The pubs yelped and got some <br />
distance between themselves and the shattering sharp glass. Martha noted dutifully that <br />
would need to be taken care of sooner than later. <br />
<br />
&quot;So Alice, would you kill time?&quot; Martha asked. She was surprised when she got an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Adam!&quot; Said a voice now that of a teenager and decreasing rapidly. The glass <br />
face and body moved. Adam looked around at the shattered remains of his clothes, his <br />
driver's license gone and now just glass. He looked at his arms and legs, no glass bones <br />
or glass internal organs, he was just solid glass. <br />
<br />
'How am I moving? How am I breathing? How am I thinking? Is this a dream of the Red <br />
King?'  Adam shook his head, wondering where that thought came from. But wouldn't it <br />
make sense for this to be the Red King's dream?<br />
<br />
&quot;So Adam... would you kill time?&quot; Martha repeated her question. <br />
<br />
Adam stood up straight and unconsciously straightened a non-existent dress, &quot;Most <br />
certainly not! I'd most prefer not to be put on trial for it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Martha nodded. &quot;That's very considerate of you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome Madam.&quot; Adam curtsied and wondered what he just did. He saw his glass <br />
manhood had melted away, and his figure was decidedly smoothing over to that of a little <br />
girl. <br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of day do you think it's going to turn out to be today?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a most mimsy morning making us play such a silly game without even asking proper <br />
if we'd like to play!  And no more gardeners? The moles will gimble the wabe' and the <br />
plants will be tulgey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin looked at Bart, then at Martha. <br />
<br />
&quot;Read the book.&quot; Martha and Bart told him. <br />
<br />
&quot;So do you think today will be beamish?&quot; Martha asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd dare so say that if those poor men were in their right mind they'd be frumious!&quot; <br />
Adam's voice was decidedly female now. And she pointed at Kevin, &quot;And him having us <br />
Gyre might have been fun, it would have been proper if he had asked us if wished to play <br />
first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin scratched his head, &quot;I did what now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you think of me? Alice?&quot; Martha asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's Adam. I'd say at first you're quite Manxome at first look. But you're quite curiouser <br />
the more I look at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think I'm slithy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most certainly not!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't seem quite as uffish as you were a moment ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart didn't know weather to laugh or cry at the butchering of Lewis Carol. It more faithful <br />
than the animated movie at least. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well now that you mention it Madam I am feeling somewhat more frabjous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha Chortled. Quite fitting for a wolfen.  <br />
<br />
Adam's body had continued to smooth away, washing away like water underneath. In fact <br />
the glass from his clothes dissolved into air. The human ears had washed away and the <br />
pointed triangular wolf ears had taken their place. Her dainty feet were now decidedly <br />
digigrated and her hands had tiny claws, more delicate than any of the other cubs. Then of <br />
course came the glass tail. <br />
<br />
&quot;Somebody speak english.&quot; Kevin whined. <br />
<br />
Martha looked at Kevin, &quot;Instead of playing Wii I expect you to be reading Alice In <br />
Wonderland by the time it's brillig.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kevin let out a pitiful whine, or perhaps it's better to say, burbled, or perhaps not.  Wolfens <br />
may murmur and maybe in right circumstances warble, but they do not bleat. <br />
<br />
The muzzle formed on Adam's cute face. His figured was based on that of a child. A living <br />
glass figure with the feature of a wolf. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now what is your name dear?&quot; Martha asked. <br />
<br />
Inside Adam's mind the vorpal game went snicker-snack. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Alice.&quot; She said calmly and plainly. <br />
<br />
&quot;And where are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was mome but now I'm home.&quot; <br />
<br />
Martha knelt down and hugged her with all her arms, she felt warm in spite of her <br />
material. &quot;Yes, yes you are dare Alice. Yes you are.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice hugged her back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now Alice.&quot; Martha whispered in one glass ear then another, &quot;We have people coming in <br />
on the other side of the house. We need you ask all five if they'd like Transform or Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're going to be making them play that game without asking again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's for the good of the pack dear. Now listen closely for this is what you need to tell <br />
them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha whispered, including the loophole about harmlessly giving the Dare back to <br />
someone while daring them to say 'Transform' next time they were asked the game. They <br />
needed their doe and buck to let lure in wild deer to become the pack's game herd after <br />
all, and couldn't do that if all the men chose Dare after all. Any extra who chose transform <br />
could be made into she-wolves for the master. Also. <br />
<br />
&quot;Living stone half-dragon wolfens?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To help protect the pack dear. They'll be just there to protect us. Just in case enough say <br />
'transform.' &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Nana.&quot; Alice curtsied again. And the glass seven and a half years wolf girl went <br />
galumphing into a full length mirror that was put side in the corner. She pass through it <br />
like it was water standing on it's side, or was it like her reflective glass body became one <br />
with it! Like a drop of water into a pond. <br />
<br />
Like frame of a slide show, on the other side, Bart, Kevin and Martha didn't see a glass <br />
wolf child. But instead a wolf girl with blond fur and blue eyes wearing a white and blue <br />
dress (minus shoes of course). She looked cute. She waved at them inside the reflection, <br />
then walked out of frame. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot; Kevin said.</p>
