<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dylan decided to go for what he thought Nate would want and clicked on werewolf. From there were several sliding knobs to set the degree of transformation and how long it would last. There was even a link  marked advanced settings. Dylan clicked on it and there were even more options. He grinned and took delight in tweaking every little thing. <br />
<br />
The first knob was for degree of transformation. He clicked on it and started sliding it to the left slowly, watching the rotating image of Nate become hairier, his ears became pointed and grew claws and fangs. The further right he went, the wolfier he became.  A bit after the halfway point he grew a snout and his feet became digitigrade. Further right, he grew a tail and at the furthest right became a quadruped hound of hell, with sharp claws, large fangs and a hulking, furry body. He pondered it but decided for the first change to slide it back to the left and then inched it forward until he had become a good and fierce looking wolf-man with a large and hulking body. Just the thought of Nate bursting out of his clothes was enough to get Dylan excited.<br />
<br />
He then clicked on the next one down that focused on the face and head. The image zoomed in and focused on the head and neck of Nate, now showing completely human again. Below the main dial, there were several others that opened up, each marked with a separate item. The first one marked his overall hairiness. Dylan slowly moved the knob to the right and smiled as he watched the image slowly change. He found the right level of hairiness and then stopped. The next one set how animalistic he should look. He slowly adjusted it, giving him a more pronounced brow and lupine nose, but keeping it from going to full on snout. The next one was to determine eye color. As he slid that knob to the right, he watched Nate&#39;s eyes shift from his usual blue to amber to red. He liked he look of the ruby red with the fierce looking face and decided to keep it. He moved to the ears, moving the knob to the right until they were quite pointy and furred. The last option was for fangs, which he also slid almost all the way to the right, watching as Nate&#39;s teeth quickly grow out into large, sharp fangs. He then clicked next and was taken back to the main screen. <br />
<br />
The next slide rule he selected was the one for hands and arms. This one only had three sub options. He slid the hairiness bar far to the right and watched as the fur grew in thick and dense. He then slid over the claws bar, watching as the fingernails grew out into thick, sharp inch long claws. The third dial was for paw pads. He slid that one over until Nate&#39;s inner hand had defined and rough paw pad like hands. He then clicked back to the main menu. He looked over the settings and liked what he saw. He quickly clicked on the feet and lower legs and made a few adjustments, pulling the knob for hairiness and claws to match the one for hands, but taking it further with the claws. And then for the feet themselves, he dragged it all the way to the right so they would become digitigrade paws. The last section was most important. It marked how long he would remain transformed and how long it would take to transform. He slid the dial over to twelve hours. There was a small box that asked if he wanted the transformation to repeat. He smiled as he clicked the box and a new drop down asked when he wanted it to repeat. He selected every full moon night with a chuckle. The second knob set how long it would take to transform from instant to the upwards of an hour. He knew Nate would want to enjoy his transformation but a full hour seemed cruel. He set it at fifteen minutes. The third knob was his mental state, the far left being completely human and the far right being completely feral. He knocked it a couple ticks to the right but largely wanted Nate to remain himself. He smiled as he clicked out of the section and then clicked on the big red button marked Transform. <br />
<br />
Nate looked over at his screen when he saw a pop-up message from the website: Your transformation is set and will now begin. <br />
<br />
Nate leaned forward, wondering what that was referring to, especially as the image on the site was not noticeably changing. He closed the pop up and resumed surfing, figuring the website to be a bust. He was shocked when a few moments later, he caught a glimpse of his hand and forearm and saw coarse hairs growing in on his previously largely hairless arm. He quickly glanced to his other arm and saw the same thing. He also noticed his fingernails seemed a bit longer. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; he whispered as he looked closely at the new found hair. He was shocked to see it was slowly growing longer. He quickly shot an IM to Dylan: What the hell is going on??<br />
<br />
Dylan IM&#39;d back a moment later: I see the transformation must have started already. Have fun buddy, awrooo! And beware the moon!<br />
<br />
Nate&#39;s heart started beating rapidly as panic, mixed with a little excitement, set in. He typed back to Dylan: What did you do to me?<br />
<br />
Dylan&#39;s response came back a moment later: Transformed you using the website. I think you&#39;ll like it. I don&#39;t want to ruin the surprise though. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not possible,&quot; whispered Nate. He stood up and stumbled to the bathroom. He flipped on the lights and braced himself up against the sink. Looking down, his arms were already hairier and his nails were much longer. He looked up into the mirror and was shocked at the sight. He looked like he hadn&#39;t shaved in a week. He felt a dull pain in his mouth and pulled back his lips, revealing teeth that had started reforming into fangs. He felt a tugging sensation with his ears and turned his head, shocked to see them growing into lupine points. He was terrified at what was happening. Yeah, sure, he had fantasized about it but that was just it. It was fantasy and this was really happening. <br />
<br />
Nate stumbled back to the computer and pulled the IM back up again. He typed a message to Dylan, struggling to type correctly with his growing claws: Am I turning into a werewolf?<br />
<br />
Dylan typed back: Bingo!<br />
<br />
Nate leaned back in the chair. He couldn&#39;t help but wonder how far it would go. He got back up and went back to the bathroom, having more difficulty as his feet were killing him. The hairiness around his face was thicker now and continued down his neck. He pulled off his shirt, revealing a previously hairless torso now quite furry. He looked over his hands, seeing the darkening and sharp claws that were once his fingernails and his hands looked like paw pads. He let out a low whimper as he heard a pop followed by another and another as his chest slowly barreled out and his back muscles grew and reformed. <br />
<br />
Nate cried out and gripped his head with his hands, clenching his eyes shut, leaning over the cold porcelain as he felt his face reform as he teeth ripped through his gums and jut out of his open mouth. He felt his feet and lower legs reform into digitigrade paws, sounds of fabric tearing as his jeans ripped apart in the transformation.  He slowly opened his eyes and looked down, seeing to his shock two large, canine paws with the fiercest claws he&#39;d ever seen with thick, brown fur with hints of grey where his previously human feet were, tattered jeans hanging around the sides. He looked up further, checking out his reflection in the mirror. He was shocked at his reflection and yet excited. He had large, fierce fangs. His lips had turned black and his entire complexion was darker as well. Beyond his more animalistic brow and lupine nose lied his ruby red eyes which Nate couldn&#39;t help but lean in to get a better look at. <br />
<br />
He slowly walked back to the computer, getting a feel for his new digitigrade feet, and typed a new message, using the tip of his index finger claw to type to Dylan: This is awesome.<br />
<br />
Dylan typed back: I&#39;m glad you liked it. Enjoy it buddy.<br />
<br />
Nate responded: You should come over and check it out.<br />
<br />
Dylan slowly considered his response before typing in: I will, in a bit. And I&#39;ll bring my camera. <br />
<br />
Nate replied: Sweet!<br />
<br />
Nate slid the keyboard back and walked away from the computer. He walked around the flat, trying to get used to his newly transformed self. His fear had given way to excitement. He knew that being a werewolf he would eventually transform back. He anxiously awaited the arrival of Dylan to explain everything.</p>
