<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At her computer, Sam had a powerful urge to look for pornography.  She didn&#39;t know exactly why, but she did know it was because whatever she found and liked was going to become additional dickgirls attached to her.<br />
<br />
Her searching was continually slowed and interrupted by Sayler doing what dickgirls do best - having sex with anything and everything.  Sam wasn&#39;t sure exactly where Sayler was, but she had heard the door open, so it was safe to bet that Sayler was out in the neighborhood having fun with the neighbors and passerbys.<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s searching turned up a lot of results that she found attractive, and even a few she considered to be permanently attached to her as her dickgirls, but she just wasn&#39;t completely sold on them yet.  Even though she was compelled by a force she couldn&#39;t explain, the time spent searching and dismissing attractive content was enough time for Sam to realize that she was actually glad to have a dickgirl of her own.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d been Jen&#39;s dickgirl for her entire life, constantly doing everything she could to make Jen as happy as possible.  She loved her sister with all of her heart, and even though she was starting to like the continued feelings of pleasure and orgasm from her own dickgirl, she still wanted to bring back that intimate feeling between herself and Jen.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a whim, she decided to type in Jen&#39;s full name and the high school where they went to.  The first few results were newspaper articles about the cheerleading team and how Jen was a proud cheerleader despite her disability.  <i>I&#39;m a disability?!?  That&#39;s just mean..  I&#39;m the best thing about Jen.</i> thought Sam.<br />
<br />
The second page of results were much more interesting.  It was full of naked pictures of Jen at football game, with the cheerleading squad behind her.  A few pictures included Sam fucking cheerleaders in the background.<br />
<br />
They brought back a rush of memories - how Jen had ordered Sam to stop having sex for a full week leading up to the game.  She had wanted to impress some guidance counselor with <i>her</i> self control.   Hah!  Jen had no idea how hard it was to stop constantly having sex when you were a dickgirl - It was everything you lived for.  Sam had done her absolute best to do what Jen had asked.<br />
<br />
But, the lust and arousal had built over the entire week, and Jen had lost her control at the game.  She&#39;d torn off her cheerleading uniform and started to masturbate, right in front of the game.  That was when Sam had rushed off to have sex with the more attractive cheerleaders on the squad.<br />
<br />
The incident was what had prompted all the articles - Articles praising Jen for managing to accomplish a week of no sex, despite the disability.  Jen hadn&#39;t been the one who had pressed her self control to the limit during that week.  It had been Sam.<br />
<br />
Sam moaned quietly to herself, &quot;I wish she could know how it feels.  Maybe then she&#39;ll stop trying to control me, and let me do what is best.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
On the third page of the search, Sam discovered that someone from the school had taken the pictures and even a video recording of the incident, and photoshopped a number of manipulations of Jen.  It seemed the mystery photoshopper hadn&#39;t taken much of a liking to Sam, as she was cut out of almost all of the images.<br />
<br />
Sam spent a few minutes determining which of the many images she found the most attractive.  Just as she did, Jen walked into the room.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Sam, have you finished looking at your porn yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so.  Hey, did you know that there are naked pictures of you online?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!?  No!  HOW?!?&quot;  Jen&#39;s response was truly one of panic as she rushed over to the computer and looked at the image on the computer.  It was the first image Sam had chosen.<br />
<br />
The image showed a closeup of Jen at the game.  Her breasts had been enlarged to a D cup and she had blonde highlights added to her hair.  A caption had been added saying &quot;All the best sluts go to this school&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Close it!  Stop looking at me naked!&quot; Jen reached for the mouse and keyboard, but couldn&#39;t seem to reach them.  An invisible force prevented her from making contact with the computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on?!?  What did you do Sam?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?  Nothing.  You told me to find some pictures online that I liked the most.  And well... I like this one.  You look hot with big boobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!  You... you can&#39;t!&quot;  Jen leapt backwards in terror.  Realization had just hit her what was about to happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean, big sis?  You told me I was going to get some new dickgirls, and that I should find the pictures I liked.  Was there a... connection?&quot;  Sam smiled innocently at Jen.  Jen&#39;s eyes darted back and forth, and she turned to run from the room.<br />
<br />
<br />
Before she could take a step, a second fleshy tube shot out of Sam&#39;s front, just above her pussy.  It darted forward at Jen, moments later making contact with Jen&#39;s tailbone.  Less than a second later, it had fused completely with Jen&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
Sam held her breath and waited expectantly to gain feeling in her sister&#39;s body, her new dickgirl.  But Sam felt nothing.<br />
Jen was feeling a lot though.  It felt like tube attached to her back and the tube attached to her front were pulling her apart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaah, it hurts!&quot;  Jen collapsed to the ground on her side and writhed as her back and her front pulled apart from each other. Tears ran down her cheeks.  Her entire torso seemed to expand forward.  Her legs, arms, and head stayed with her front as she was pulled backwards.<br />
<br />
Once Jen&#39;s torso had reached twice its normal depth, a crease appeared lengthwise.  The crease rapidly grew deeper, eventually severing the torso into 2 separate pieces.  The new fleshy tube was connected to the back piece, while the front piece seemed to be the entire original Jen.<br />
<br />
Jen stopped writhing and pushed herself a foot away from the fleshy mass attached to Sam&#39;s new tube.  &quot;What... what the hell is that?!?&quot;  She wiped the tears away from her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have... no idea.  That wasn&#39;t what I expected at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell did you expect?!?  That you&#39;d be my dick, and I would be your dick at the same time!?  Sam, what the fuck is wrong with you!&quot; Jen shouted at Sam.<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s yelling caused Sam to start sobbing. &quot;I... I wanted you to know how.. *sob* how.. amazing it is to be a dickgirl.  Maybe... *sniff* maybe then you could let me... *sob* act like a real dickgirl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam buried her hand in her arms.  Jen could feel every sob, every semen-filled tear as it rolled down Sam&#39;s face.  Even Jen couldn&#39;t stay mad at her sister like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, look, I&#39;m sorry.  Okay?  Sam?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Sam kept her head buried in her arms.  Her feelings had been seriously hurt, and even though she could tell that Jen really did feel sorry for yelling at her, she was afraid of how Jen might react to what was coming.  For Sam was starting to gain feeling in the fleshy mass that had come off of Jen... And she could feel that it was growing.<br />
<br />
Jen walked over to and knelt next to Sam.  &quot;Come on Sam.  Don&#39;t stay mad at me.  Please?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam turned away from Jen, almost getting caught on the fleshy tubes connecting her to her existing dickgirl, and partial new dickgirl.<br />
<br />
Jen sighed and stood up to leave.  &quot;Well, at least the curse didn&#39;t seem to do anything more fucked up this time.&quot;  She walked over to the door and kicked the fleshy mass on the floor.  That was a mistake: Both Jen and Sam instantly felt the kick to the mass - it felt like someone had just kicked them in the dick and the stomach.<br />
<br />
Which, in a way, was true.  The mass was developing a more formed appearance, and had developed a stomach and 2 large breasts like the ones from the picture.  When Jen kicked it, the mass went into overdrive and started to rapidly grow 5 new spurts.<br />
<br />
Both Jen and Sam stared at the mass as they both felt and saw the growths extend out and gain definition.  Sam in eagerness and anticipation.  Jen in terror.<br />
<br />
2 of the masses quickly turned into legs, and a pussy and butt formed at the appropriate places between them.  2 more masses quickly became arms.  The final mass though, formed into a head that looked exactly like Jen... Except with blonde streaks in the hair.<br />
<br />
<br />
A few seconds later the mass, now a fully formed dickgirl, opened her eyes.  The new dickgirl and Jen both looked at Sam, and screamed in unison, &quot;SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM!&quot;</p>
