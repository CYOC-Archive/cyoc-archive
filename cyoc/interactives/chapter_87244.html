<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I&#39;m pretty sure he then followed to insult me, but I choose to not answer and just ignore him.<br />
<br />
I already knew what was going to happen, and just how dangerously wonderful it would feel, and how everything would end as once it was over. And even then, I felt a jolt of expectation and another one of fear when the first tingles began to run through my spine, signaling the changes would take place any second now.<br />
<br />
A happy surprise went over me as the mind that had invaded my body seemed more aware and afraid of the changes than I was, as if fearful of everything at the same time and certain of the doom that would befall the both of us.<br />
<br />
Stop this at once! it demanded, poking my mind in search of the information.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not there.&quot; I laughed, my skin smoothing out with every passing second, hair being absorbed within as the pale white it used to be turned a light honey.<br />
<br />
Babel probed and poked a couple more times as I continued laughing out in joy, the flow of endorphin increasing by the second.<br />
<br />
&quot;It ain&#39;t there either.&quot; the voice was coming out croaky and irregular, my throat feeling sore as the memory of my first visit to the Flux crossed my mind. &quot;Try again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Images from my life began to flash before my very eyes and the changes continued; a distinctive prickling feeling attacked my chest and groin, ripples of an all new level of pleasure running through my very veins as my body began to heat up, a powerful flush reaching my cheeks while I slightly loosened my mind for it to swim in the sensations.<br />
<br />
Hair began to grow longer with every gasp that escaped my lips, mirroring the growth of my chest, which blossomed further and further, flesh pushing out the already erect nipples, forming mounds underneath that unleashed wonderful waves of new desires.<br />
<br />
Finding my hands all too unoccupied, I brushed against the bare flesh in my chest, jolts of pure bliss spaded through my brain accompanied with lust in its rawest form.<br />
<br />
The second mind demanded for release, to stop its torture and revert back to normal, to cease the mental siege my body was forcing upon the both of us. And I ignored him, the pinching and teasing with which my fingers fondled my nipples forced a moan out of me, a high pitched one, womanly, inviting; and, if anything, sensual and sultry.<br />
<br />
Seemingly encouraged by my teasing, the changes picked up their pace, spreading further and further as I didn&#39;t put any boundaries, gently letting myself enjoy every moment of it while the arousal continued enveloping everything.<br />
<br />
Waist thinned out as my stomach flattened, my hips snapped outwards and I felt that the ass said hips held swelled rapidly, becoming an excellent cushion as I sat down and leaned backwards, flattening my back against the cold floor, every hair that remained on my being raising and falling as chills went through me. My thin and dexterous fingers pulling out one moan after the next as if it were a thing possessed, feeling as the breasts that could barely fit within the palm continued inflating outwards in a slow yet noticeable speed.<br />
<br />
My brain didn&#39;t dwell much on the fact that, despite how strong the sweetness of arousal was, the one thing that should have reacted had remained limp and lifeless, my own body seemed to deny its existence, as if expecting something else out of it.<br />
<br />
Neither did it care as the changes eventually reached that place as well, tugging the piece of flesh into my broad hips, sucking it out of existence and making sure I noticed its new form as a strange hot sensation followed by wetness reached my crotch; the probing and poking of the alien mind now weak and faint, no longer able to withhold the sensations it had never felt before.<br />
<br />
One hand glided down my torso, teasing the soft skin with a silken touch until it came to an abrupt halt near the crevice of my womanhood; doubt making its way through the mind as a moment of clarity reached me. I bit my plump lower lip, fighting to hold back and think it through for a moment.<br />
<br />
This was the line… once crossed, I could never go back.<br />
<br />
A feint voice screamed inside me to go back and stop all this; in frustration, anger and fear it shouted something about seeing through the lust and realizing the doomed and lowly life I&#39;d live if I continued, and about the truth of how horrible that life would be.<br />
<br />
And then was the other voice, the one that had been guiding me from the beginning, it was soft, soothing and calm. It whispered into my ear words of a meaning in life, one more basic and instinctive, yet more fulfilling and important than anything else I could wish for; words of possibilities, of how much more I&#39;d be able to feel with just the slightest touch; words of lust, of sex and of mates, males and the greatest of pleasures I could ever achieve; words of need, of the unstoppable inferno that burned within me and the ways to quell the thirst for more than my own touch…<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t even need to answer, my hand moved on its own, and penetrated within my need without further hesitation. A gasp escaped me and my back arched, my eyes opened wide as a small tsunami of pure bliss ran through me and escaped my folds, making me quiver and tremble at the same time every muscle tensed up for just a second.<br />
<br />
Then, there was need; a need greater than any hunger, a need stronger than any will, a need deeper than any well. A need for more.<br />
<br />
It came with vengeful strength, forcing a whimper out of me. That one finger began searching about within me, and I bit my lips while I tried to hold back the scream, a powerful blush reaching my cheeks. Every move only compounded the lust, every instant gave out just a bit more pleasure, every gesture sent stronger ripples straight into my brain and down to my very core as the rhythm slowly increased on its own accord.<br />
<br />
Two fingers, and a white haze began to envelop everything around me, my left hand pushed the now large breast against my mouth, giving me an all new way to muffle my moans as I needfully nibbled at the erect piece of flesh and began sucking while the hand continued its ministrations as best it could.<br />
<br />
Legs slightly bent while I looked down at my own cleavage, the two mounds barely covering from view the smoothness bellow, skin gleaming with little meads of sweat as the heat that emanated from me seemed unbearable, every inch of my skin burned, every touch like an electric shock that sent me further into the sensations.<br />
<br />
One more finger, and the pace had become frantic, and one moan after the next escaped me, unable to stop even for an instant; that invisible wall that kept me from release didn&#39;t budge, it continued there even as the little puddle of lust I initially had became an infinite ocean of arousal.<br />
<br />
The fourth finger went inside and my head spun for a moment; I madly began to buck my hips upwards in thrusts, making sure every part of me was occupied in creating more pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;More!&quot; I screamed out in a moan to no one in particular, the need wasn&#39;t abating, it only grew more and more... there was something missing, something I needed, something I wanted.<br />
<br />
My breasts moved up and down with every heaving breath, my hips thrusting into nothing as only my fingers seemed to go deeper, feeling something was amiss, a place inside that hadn&#39;t been reached, a one spot that had not been satisfied, the one place that kept me from sweet release.<br />
<br />
More changes happened to my body, whatever force was creating the new me was trying to help me out, and the fog behind which my mind seemed only to thicken further and further as my attempts of release weren&#39;t close to fruition.<br />
<br />
I leaned on a side, and ignored the itching of my skin, all that mattered was to find release as soon as possible, and whatever it was that didn&#39;t feel right on my tail-bone was keeping me from it.<br />
<br />
Hands working furiously to keep me from completely going insane, I closed my eyes and I tried to concentrate on the sensations alone, hoping against hope that that&#39;d be enough to take me over the edge once and for all if I managed to boost focus only on the lust.<br />
<br />
That only made things worse.<br />
<br />
That point within me only throbbed with increasing strength, it demanded a kind of attention I couldn&#39;t quite manage to give it, pulsing with desire for something more than just my fingers.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, I felt a jolt of relief as whatever had been bothering me had been released, and said sensation came with a sudden realization.<br />
<br />
I had a tail.<br />
<br />
A long sinuous cat-like tail that was covered in silky black fur.<br />
<br />
And I, rather, that soft voice that was whispering in my ear, had complete control over it.<br />
<br />
The moment of clarity was short lived, the tail sprung with a mind of its own and the tip brushed against my clit, and I almost passed out as all the world became a white noise for a second. The sensual thoughts on what to use it for came on their own, and a lustfully satisfied grin came to my face ; I used my own hand to guide it to the spot that had been craving for it since what felt like a small eternity ago.<br />
<br />
With the first thrust, my body went numb for a second as it went deeper into me than what I could have ever hoped to achieve with my fingers alone. I completely laid on my back while holding myself up with my elbows, exposing my bare chest into the cool air, allowing the nipples to be played with by the chilly drift and my head hung backwards completely unable to even process a humble thought; all that really mattered was what lay between my legs.<br />
<br />
Seemingly with a mind of its own, the tail began to move, to coil and wriggle as it was slowly pulled out, making me quiver, making me moan, and making me want more.<br />
<br />
When only the very tip was left inside, the tail tensed for a second, and thrust back into me, reaching a bit deeper and farther than before; then it wriggled itself out before going back in at full force, each time getting a bit closer to my core, to my very need.<br />
<br />
I moaned, I screamed and I yowled as the only part of my body that moved was that wonderfully made tail, thickened by a fur that caressed every inch of the way, that made me more sensitive every passing second, and forced me to delight in the marvelous itch it created.<br />
<br />
Unable to resist, I completely lay flat as my hands went back to my breasts, madly squishing the life out of them causing the final changes begin, unnoticeably passing through me as I just wanted more.<br />
<br />
The soft black fur that sprouted through my skin made it easier for me to thrust my hips against my tail; the claws that formed out of my feet gave me the much needed grip to use all my strength on bucking my sloppy wet sex against the tubular assaulter; the claws in my hands and fangs on my mouth gave me the chance to nip and tease my breasts further; the rouged tongue made me reach higher levels of pleasure purely out of licking my breasts; the muzzle and whiskers gave me the chance to smell the thick intoxicating scent of my own arousal, which made it that much more maddening; the new triangular ears giving me in detail the sounds of everything that was happening throughout my body… and at the same time, it felt as if every inch of my body was meant for oozing raw sex, even the sensation of the floor against my shoulders felt like the most masterful of massages.<br />
<br />
Over and over again, the tail penetrated a bit deeper every time, I could feel it, even in the sex-crazed state I was, I could tell it was about to reach that spot, that place where all the lust and need and arousal and heat had hidden into in wait for the proper probe.<br />
<br />
And when it hit that place, I felt my whole body tense up, the fingers on my feet curling and every fiver of my being screaming in joy as I let out a mix of a roar and a yowl of sheer bliss, my mind swarmed by the thundering white noise; letting my juices gush out uncontrollably, my whole body going numb before I became limp and lay on the floor, catching my breath and letting the sensations to slowly wash away as I purred in the glow that followed.<br />
<br />
Had I stopped there, I&#39;d have been able to walk away with my mind mostly unchanged, maybe even get out of that place and return to my life with a changed body as the worst of consequences.<br />
<br />
But I didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
The tail that had been accidentally left within began to move again, and I felt the arousal pang back into action right away, my breathes came out in gasps as I tried to hold back, tried to pull it out and avoid from falling further, but I wanted more. That small brink of unsatisfied need that had been ignored suddenly grew into monstrous proportions before I could even stop myself.<br />
<br />
A second orgasm wiped my mind clean for an instant as the tail found that spot again; body becoming tense once more just before it retreated just a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;No…&quot; I almost whimpered out the words, tears forming in my golden cat-like eyes; the tail tensed up, making clear what was about to happen. &quot;NO!&quot;<br />
<br />
I screamed at the same time the tip of that devilish creature poked the spot before I could move, clenching my teeth in an attempt to stop the bliss from steamrolling my mind clean again; but the tail continued its torture, and began to ruthlessly ram itself against that spot over and over again, causing one orgasm after the next to course my whole being without allowing a moment of rest.<br />
<br />
It was like a trigger, whenever the spot was touched, my inner walls would clench around my own tail, and quiver in delight while it withdrew just a couple inches, then thrusting back into the same place; repeating the process at increasing speed.<br />
<br />
Something else was reaching its limits; I could almost hear the cracks on the walls around my mind, bits of it falling down by the sheer force of the shock-waves, like tiny and thin lines that signaled it would burst if it didn&#39;t stop.<br />
<br />
I wasn&#39;t even sure how long I had been left in that state, one orgasm after the next, I lost count while my eyelids shut close and I tried crossing my legs, but the wicked being that had been the source of my rise and fall would not stop even then, time being distorted as the haze in my mind would not abate, and neither would my attempts to stop.<br />
<br />
Then, the wall began to crumble, and I began to lose myself.<br />
<br />
&quot;More, more, more…!&quot; the scream revealed I no longer resisted the pleasure, I embraced it fully; my legs spread wide and my hands began caressing every inch of my body as my mouth and lips were too occupied shouting in short gasps and long moans to do anything useful, letting me spiral deeper and deeper as every single time that spot was touched, I&#39;d feel a greater joy as well. &quot;Oh my G…!&quot;<br />
<br />
My eyes rolled back, my claws racked the ground and my body became rock hard as time froze for a second before the floodgates exploded as I came like I had never came before, an earth shaking scream leaving me panting on the ground and with my body unable to move out of sheer exhaustion and the overflow of sensations that ran through every inch of me.<br />
<br />
Slowly, my mind drifted away as I purred through the afterglow, it felt like a one continuous never-ending orgasm, a sensation that stained every part of my being, dyeing it in a permanently aroused state.<br />
<br />
Somewhere, somehow after what felt like hours of blissful blankness of thought, I realized I wasn&#39;t inside the Babel tower anymore; that the screen in front of me showed the Flux had crashed and Babel disappeared; that I was back in my room, naked and covered in sweat all over, and with my sweet thick juices staining me from the waist down…<br />
<br />
But a moment after, my new self returned to, and more important things came to mind.<br />
<br />
Like the fact that I had to find a man before the mating season ended.</p>
