<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power- Ty and Peter’s Magical Halloween – by scriptboy (ty@powerfulboys.com)<br />
Ideas by drakkenfyre, peteroo6, and scriptboy<br />
<br />
“I only gathered five pounds of candy last year”, Ty began, “This year, I want it to be different!” Peter and Ryan looked at him with a smile on their faces. “Well, this year, you got us! The more, the merrier, Ty! More people can bring in more candy!” Peter responded.<br />
<br />
“And we can actually do stuff for our neighbors, especially since I got these big muscles!” Ryan said, while flexing both arms at the same time, revealing his huge biceps which were bigger than basketballs. “So what are you guys gonna dress up as?” he asked Peter and Ty.<br />
<br />
“Well, I want to go as someone who is scary! I’ll be Count Drrrrracula!” Ty said, rolling his “R’s” like it’s pronounced in Spanish. Ty grew taller and older, his blond hair turned gray, and he made his teeth look more pointy and sharper. Then he wished himself to wear a black robe and a red cape, which was black on the outside as well. He wore white gloves, black dress shoes, and long black slacks. “Now, I shall look for my first victim to bite in the neck!” he said out loud.<br />
<br />
“Well, I always wanted to be a super hero. I’ll be Superman!” Peter said. Peter stood up, and he became taller and more muscular. He was suddenly wearing blue tights, red pants, red boots and a red cape. He also had the big letter “S” logo on his shirt. “Ahhh…. Now let’s test the powers!” he said. He grabbed a candle and lit the tip of the candle with his heat vision, which consisted of two laser beams which came from his eyes. “Okay, I’m ready!” he said, leaping in the air and flying a circle around Ty and Ryan before landing on his feet in the living room.<br />
<br />
“What about Ryan?” Ty asked the big muscle boy. “I just want to go as myself! As a big, muscular boy!” Ryan said, flexing every muscle in his body! “I know! Let’s turn Ryan into the HULK!” Peter suggested. Ryan looked at him with a sad look on his face. “But, I’m bigger than the HULK! Don’t make me smaller!” Ryan complained. “Okay then, we’ll just turn you into the green giant. All I have to do is make your skin turn green!” Peter responded. Ryan liked that idea and smiled back. Peter stared at him for a few seconds, and the large dark colored boy suddenly turned bright lime green!<br />
<br />
Suddenly the doorbell rang, and Ty opened up. There were two kids standing in front of him. A little boy wore a costume which resembled a skeleton, and the little girl resembled a fairy. The boy was holding a plastic pumpkin in his hand. “Trick or treat!” they shouted at the same time. <br />
<br />
Ty turned around and looked at Dustin, who was in the kitchen. “Hey Dustin, where’s the candy at?” he asked his foster brother. “Candy? What candy? I didn’t buy any candy!” Dustin said. “What? It’s Halloween night, and you forgot to buy us some candy?” Ty said out loud, getting angry at Dustin. Ty concentrated and Dustin instantly turned into a lollipop. Ty picked it up and gave it to the little girl, who immediately to the wrapper off and brought the candy to her mouth.<br />
<br />
“Oh no! She’s about to chew on Dustin!” Peter said, immediately turning the lollipop back into Dustin, who stood outside the front door, completely naked! The wrapper turned back into his clothes, but the girl hadn’t noticed the change yet, and she sank her teeth into Dustin’s right hand… “CHOMP!”<br />
<br />
First Dustin gnashed his teeth. Then his face was pale. Then his face turned blue. And finally, his face turned red as a tomato. He opened his mouth and let out a loud scream of pain. “AAUUIIOOEEEUUWWWWUUUUAAAAUUU!!!!!!” he yelled, when both the boy and the girl noticed that there was a naked man standing outside in the cold, screaming out loud. Both kids began to cry as well!!<br />
<br />
Peter, dressed as Superman, intervened. “Hey kids, don’t worry. I’ll fly to the drugstore down the street and I’ll buy you some candy, so just give me a minute okay?” Peter said, as he leaped in the air, flying to the nearest drugstore. “I’m going too!” Count Dracula said, as he suddenly transformed into a bat, which immediately flew behind Superman. Dustin ran into the house to change, leaving Ryan with the kids. “Don’t worry, they’ll be right back!” the big, green muscular giant said to the little kids. <br />
<br />
Superman appeared in the sky about three minutes later, carrying a plastic bag in his hand. When he landed, a small bat landed next to him, which immediately transformed back into Count Dracula. Superman gave the kids some candy, and sent them off to the next house. Peter had just closed the door, waiting for Dustin to dress up in his clown costume, when the doorbell rang again.<br />
<br />
This time, Peter opened the door and saw Jace, Allen, Brian, and Prince standing in front of their front door. “Trick or Treat!” they all shouted at once! “Wow, you guys are all here! This is a surprise!” Peter said out loud. Jace was another friend, a teenager who had the same powers as Ty and Peter had. Allen was Peter’s friend from the swim team at school, Brian was Ty’s next door neighbor, and of course Prince, he was Peter’s mentor and instructor in the transformation arts! “We figured you guys were going out to scare some people, so we all decided to join in on the fun!” Prince said, dressed up as a cowboy! Jace was dressed up as a fireman, Brian was a mummy, and Allen was dressed as a magician.<br />
<br />
Since Ryan was the biggest and the strongest person in the group, he carried a large brown bag to hold all the candy. And Dustin was dressed as a clown, although Ty used the opportunity to change him at almost every door they knocked on. He turned Dustin into another bat, then a pumpkin, then a horse for Prince to sit on!<br />
<br />
That night, the group went out and scared everyone in the neighborhood, since their costumes were so real! And because their disguises were so genuine, they were richly rewarded at every house they visited. At the end of the night, they collected over sixty pounds of candy, making it truly a Happy, Magical Halloween night for everyone!</p>
