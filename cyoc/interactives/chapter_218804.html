<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr. Bashir knew he was dead and he knew he had to be blessed to have been here at this moment when Lucifer the Great Deceiver and Prince of Darkness had just walked into the room. He couldn’t let this chance past him by. He lunged toward Lucifer extending the Blessed cold Iron Knife to it’s fullest extent.<br />
<br />
“IN THE NAME OF GOD!” yelled DR. Bashir as he lunged toward Lucifer who was looking at him. Good he would be able to see the face of the great enemy as he plunged the knife in. Less than a second later he was going backwards as he felt a pain in his arm and a blow to his gut. <br />
<br />
He had just enough time before he feel to the floor to see his arm with the knife extended falling away from his body as he went backwards. Lucifer had closed the distance and had in one impossible fast movement sliced off his arm before elbowing him in the chest with such force he was sent backwards off his feet.<br />
<br />
He landed on the ground cracking the marble from the force of Lucifer’s elbow blow. Dr. Bashir, knew he had multiple ribs that had been broken and his back had been snapped. He had just enough time to reopen his eyes before his vision was filled with that golden angel with a flaming sword out and pointed at his neck. Other black armored demon guards appeared all pointing their weapons at him. Then his eyes closed forever as life left his eyes as he bleed out on the floor.<br />
<br />
“My Lord are you Ok?” inquired Baal as he had his own weapon out and at the ready, his eyes scanning the area.<br />
<br />
“I am fine, are you ok.” Inquired Lucifer looking at first his wife who nodded her head and then his daughter and the former humans who where looking on in pure shock. <br />
<br />
“Why would a demon attack his king in the name of God?” inquired a guard glaring at Michael believing he was somehow behind it.<br />
“He doesn’t smell like a demon, he smells like a human.” explained Penumune<br />
<br />
“A human?” inquired Lucifer as he stepped forward extending one hand while keeping the other on his Kanaan like sword. Black energy covered his hand before shooting out and striking the seemly demon.<br />
<br />
“He is human.” Stated Lucifer as he closed his hand into a fist as he broke the smell as the demon shifted into that as a man. <br />
<br />
“That is Dr. Bashir.” Stated Michael “One of the Iron Knights that was part of the group missing with Rev. Church.”<br />
<br />
“An Iron Knight attack within the Imperial palace on King Lucifer.” Grumbled the Captain of the guard. “I am sorry for such a shameful failure on our part my King. His ID was good.”<br />
<br />
“This wasn’t your fault.” Stated Lucifer as he looked at Micheal in the eyes. “He was protected by demonic magic, first his form and to hide his human scent.”<br />
<br />
“Demonic Magic?” inquired Lilith “That means?”<br />
<br />
“There is a traitor and judging by the strength of the magic it has to be high ranking demon and one who has access to the Palace itself.” Stated Lucifer as everyone looked around, to betray lucifer was almost unbelievable, no one had even considered it after the rebellion against god. All knew Lucifer was the most powerful demon and with the possible exception of Michael the best swordsmen in either heaven, hell or on Earth. “Lock down the Palace, search everyone I don’t care if their IDs are good or if they are high born or low, search everyone and everywhere.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, my King.” Confirmed the guard <br />
<br />
“Thank you, you may have just prevented something far more horrible.” Thanked Lucifer to Penumune who was still very visibly shaken by watching what had just happened.<br />
<br />
“Brother.” Said Michael as he looked at the Blessed Cold Iron Forged Steel which had been dropped when Lucifer had taken the would be assassin’s arm. <br />
<br />
“What is it?” inquired Lucifer <br />
<br />
“I know this blade.” Proclaimed Michael as he pointed to a maker mark. “This came from Heaven. You may not be the only one with a traitor in your mist. Someone in heaven has been arming the Iron Knights.”<br />
<br />
“So someone in heaven wanted to kill King Lucifer to start a war?” inquired Astaroth <br />
<br />
“No, not me.” countered Lucifer as Michael nodded his head in agreement. “There was no way he would have known I would be here, yet he was already in the room.”<br />
<br />
“Who was he?” inquired Michael<br />
<br />
“Some official from aid to Hubal, Hamsa I believe was his name.” stated Astaroth “He had come to invite us to some party at the embassy. So there was no way, he would have known you would be here Lucifer.”<br />
<br />
“I was a target of opportunity, the real target was likely Trenade.” stated Lucifer as he looked at his soon to be daughter-in-law.<br />
<br />
“We shall redouble our guards.” offered the Captain<br />
<br />
“Not good enough I am afraid.” Stated Lucifer “We are dealing with Iron Knights who have allied themselves with weapons from Heaven and some power demon lord or lady capable of hiding them from all our magic.”<br />
<br />
“But not ours.” Added Michael “My offer still stands, let me take them to Heaven.”<br />
<br />
“And Beelzebub point about sending her or anyone else near where Kushiel has any type of power is out of the question.” Stated Lucifer “Will someone get Beelzebub he needs to be made aware of this situation.”<br />
<br />
“My Lord, may I offer up a compromise?” inquired Baal<br />
<br />
“Of course, I always value your advice.” Stated Lucifer<br />
<br />
“It is traditional to give your child a castle and lands to hold onto when they wed, my lord.” Stated Baal “The Palace is full of people but a smaller castle with fewer people whom we all know to be true demons would increase her safety. We Isolate the Princess and her family.”<br />
<br />
“I would agree with you but if we are dealing with someone who is capable of hiding them fully from our magic then they could sneak in anyhow.” countered Astaroth<br />
<br />
“Father if I may.” Offered Maisy as all eyes turned to her. “What if we took, Josh, Penumune, Remeila and Michael with us, their angel noses can tell us if someone is human.”<br />
<br />
Lucifer placed his hand under his chin to consider. <br />
<br />
“I am afraid, I wouldn’t be able to go.” Stated Remeila “I have many duties in Purgatory to deal with.”<br />
<br />
“And I would be better suited here hunting the remaining knights.” Countered Michael “If Josh and Penumune where true warriors then maybe it would work. I would offer some of our guards but that would cause major trouble for you political.”<br />
<br />
“More then you can imagine.” Stated Lucifer as he considered. “However, a Princess of Heaven can not stay in hell without her own protector, is your wife still as skilled with a spear and the sword as she was when she was known as Joan as Ark?”<br />
<br />
“She is, I can contact her right away if God approves of this idea.” Confirmed Michael<br />
<br />
“Very well, Astaroth go with your mate, her children and Princess Penumune to Maisma’s castle, take only the guards in this room and await the arrival of Parthenope, then seal the castle from all portals and await our success in finding the Iron Knights and the traitors.” Ordered Lucifer. “No one, can know where you have gone, no contact with anyone.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Stated Astaroth as she gathered up every guard in the room and the former humans, plus Penumune before opening a portal to some other location in hell. Once that was done and Lucifer was left alone with only his brother, General Baal and his wife.<br />
<br />
“I want them all found within the day and I will make whoever betrayed the dark throne to die as slowly and as painfully as possible. I don&#39;t care who it is they will pay for this attempt.”  Proclaimed Lucifer with clear anger and hate in his voice.</p>
