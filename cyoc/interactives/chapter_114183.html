<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> Trevor and Melissa traveled silently from the Tyson ranch to the Jenkins home.  While the two were silent, all sorts of thoughts and emotions went both of their heads.  Tyson&#39;s expressions were hard to read as he had to keep his eyes on the road, but all sorts of thoughts were going through his mind, especially about the events of just a few minutes ago.  Melissa, on the other hand, had a small smile on her face.  Both of them were in the throes of passion not too long ago, and had Trevor kept going, Melissa would have been a werecow...and pregnant.  She was grateful to him, and it showed him to be a true gentleman.  No, more like a knight in shining armor, and she was his princess.  She&#39;d have to reward him, but the time wasn&#39;t now.  At least not yet.  But one thing for certain, after that incident, she grew to respect and love him even more than before.<br />
<br />
The truck soon arrived at the Jenkins home, and Melissa was in the process of getting out of the truck when she stopped and asked, &quot;Hey, Trevor, how about you meet my dad?  I&#39;m sure he&#39;d love to meet with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor thought for a moment and said, &quot;I don&#39;t why not.  You&#39;ve already met my mom, so it&#39;s only fair.&quot;  With that said, he turned off the truck and climbed out to follow Melissa.  Melissa opened the front door only to see Virginia and Harold sitting on the couch going through the family photo album.<br />
<br />
Melissa smirked as she said, &quot;Well, what do we have here?&quot;  Both Harold and Virginia jumped when they heard Melissa&#39;s voice.  &quot;And it&#39;s good to see you dating again.  It&#39;s about time if you ask me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Young lady,&quot; Harold started, his face clearly red, &quot;Do you know what time it is?  I was about to start dinner without you.  And who&#39;s this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor stepped forward with his hand out as he said, &quot;Trevor. Trevor Tyson.  I&#39;m a friend of your daughter&#39;s.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Harold shook Trevor&#39;s hand as he said, &quot;Good to meet you, young man.  So, what plans do you have for my daughter?&quot; His question came with a slow and cool tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pardon?&quot; Trevor asked as he looked at Harold rather confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!&quot; Melissa exclaimed, her face also as red as his.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to see you, Mr. Tyson,&quot; Virginia said from the couch.  &quot;Hope things are going well for your project.  I expect an excellent presentation from you and your group as usual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, ma&#39;am,&quot; Trevor replied with a nod of his head. He then looked around the place and noticed all the boxes, both packed and unpacked strewn around the house.  &quot;Sir,&quot; he said at Harold, &quot;it looks like you got quite a thing going here.  Do you need any help?  We got this saying down at the ranch, &#39;Many hands make light work&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it has been slow going, what with me all by myself and all the constant interruptions,&quot; Harold said as he wiped his brow.  &quot;If you&#39;re willing to work, then I don&#39;t see why not.  Just as a warning, though, most of what&#39;s in those boxes are big heavy books that&#39;ll be used to fill those empty bookshelves over there.&quot;  As Harold said this, he pointed to a bunch of empty bookcases.<br />
<br />
Trevor simply shrugged and said, &quot;Work&#39;s never bothered me none.&quot;  He then walked over to a box of books and lifted it up as if it was a box of pillows.  <br />
<br />
Harold blinked as he saw this and then said, &quot;Ok then, let&#39;s get to work.  Melissa, you know which box has which books by what&#39;s written on the boxes.  You direct Trevor which box goes where.  You know my system and how I like things.  Virginia, you and I will unpack the boxes and shelf the books.  Anybody have any questions?&quot;  Nobody said anything, which gave a cue to start working.  Melissa examined each box and told Trevor where they went.  Virginia and Harold unpacked each box, and shelved the books.  First by date period and then by author.  When Harold was on the ground getting the books out of the box and handing them to Virginia, he couldn&#39;t help but notice Virginia&#39;s figure through her clothes.  He tried looking away, or at least pretended not to notice, but both Melissa and Virginia saw that and gave a small giggle at his actions.  It wasn&#39;t long before all of the boxes were emptied and folded away, and all of the books were in their proper spot.  Nearly all of the walls were filled with books and bookshelves, except for one wall which had a television.<br />
<br />
Harold looked around and smiled saying, &quot;Now this feels like home. Trevor, I could use your help in the bedrooms.  The movers didn&#39;t put the furniture where I&#39;d like it.  Virginia, Mel, you girls can work in the kitchen and unpack all the dishes and cooking wares.&quot;  Trevor nodded as he followed Harold upstairs.  Virginia and Melissa went to the kitchen to unpack the boxes there.  Unlike in the living room, there was a bit less organization.  This gave the girls a chance to talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Melissa started as she brought out the plates.  &quot;I think my dad likes you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Virginia replied with a raised eyebrow as she put the plates away in a cupboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I&#39;ve seen the way he looks at you,&quot; Melissa grinned as she said this.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is kinda cute how he checks me out, and then pretends not to, even though I caught him doing so,&quot; Virginia replied with a bit of a giggle.  Melissa joined her in the giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Melissa said as she continued working, &quot;I&#39;ve been pushing dad to get out and start dating again.  Ever since mom died, he hasn&#39;t been the same.&quot;  Melissa&#39;s smile faded as she remembered the period before they left Michigan to leave for Moon Lake.  &quot;I mean, he used to be all cheerful and stuff.  He used to tell all sorts of bad &quot;dad&quot; jokes.  They&#39;d make me groan, but I laughed anyway because it was his way of showing how much he loved me.  But when mom died, he changed.  For the worst.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; Virginia asked as she put more dishes away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, on one hand, he&#39;s been a bit overprotective.  I have to check in with him all the time, and wants to know everything that goes on in the day with me.  On the other hand, he gets forgetful more often.  I mean, he was always the &#39;absent-minded professor&#39;, but without mom around, he&#39;s gotten so much worse.  He&#39;d forget basic things, like when to eat, or when to stop working.  There were a few times he&#39;d miss things...important things to me...because he was too busy working to even notice the time...or me.&quot;  Melissa sighed and then pursed her lips.  &quot;I miss the old dad.  The dad that would tell bad jokes.  The dad that remembered stuff.  The dad that loved and trusted me.  I know dad loves me and all, but he hasn&#39;t been well.  Not since mom died.&quot;  Virginia noticed the tears starting to form in Melissa&#39;s eyes and decided to change the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Virginia started as she brought a new topic, &quot;Trevor Tyson, huh?  What&#39;s going on between you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor?  And me?&quot; Melissa stiffened as her face went red.  &quot;What do you mean?  There&#39;s nothing going on between us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Virginia said with a bit of a grin.  She turned to face Melissa and said as she pointed to her nose, &quot;You can&#39;t exactly lie to me.  We weres have really sensitive noses, and I can tell that something&#39;s been going on between you two.  I can smell him on you, yet I can tell you&#39;re still a normal still.  That means that something went on between you two, but you didn&#39;t go all the way.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Melissa&#39;s face went even redder as she said, &quot;Okay, okay, we did make out before we came here.  Don&#39;t tell dad.  If he found out, I think we&#39;d be having steaks for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Virginia smiled gently as she said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, your secret&#39;s safe with me.&quot;  She then turned to continue putting the dishes away.  &quot;Trevor&#39;s a nice guy, at least as far as I can tell in class.  A steady guy at that.&quot;  Melissa nodded as that&#39;s how she remembers him in class as well.  <br />
<br />
The two continued to work as they chatted about not just boys, but work, classes, interests and stuff.  It wasn&#39;t long before the two men came back downstairs as the ladies were finishing unpacking the kitchen.  With just about everything unpacked, both Melissa and Harold offered their thanks to Virginia and Trevor for their help and offered dinner.  Virginia declined, saying that she had homework she had to grade.  Trevor also declined, saying that his parents were expecting him home.  The two of them left leaving Melissa and Harold home together.</p>
