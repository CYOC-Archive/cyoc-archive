<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;For this challenge, the three of you will be in a strip-off! Contestants will stand in front of their podiums and take turns stripping off their clothing. The computer will award bonus points for creativity. Whoever is the closest to being naked or has the most creativity points wins. So who&#39;s taking the challenge?&quot; Nicky asked.<br />
<br />
Eric hit his button without hesitation. An opportunity to take off his clothes? Of course he&#39;d take it, who wouldn&#39;t? The blonde confidently walked in front the podium, noticing out of the corner of his eye that Micheal rolled his eyes at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you are a queer then?&quot; Micheal retorted. &quot;Pfft, should&#39;ve known.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not gay, I&#39;m just here to win. Plus, who wouldn&#39;t want to show off a bit,&quot; Eric reasoned. The ladies would love it. Probably.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show off? You&#39;re stripping in front of millions of fags and you drool at the sight of dick, so fuck off with your defense,&quot; Micheal pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, at this rate, I&#39;m gonna win this challenge so I&#39;d suggest you be a little nicer to me,&quot; Eric teased. That shut the brunette up. Eric looked over at Brian and saw the bald man shy away, much to his pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, since Eric is the only challenger, all he&#39;s gotta do now is strip off a piece of clothing and he wins,&quot; Nicky announced, nodding to the blonde. &quot;Although, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m not disappointed. I kinda liked this competition.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric thought for a moment. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Nicky, I&#39;ll make up for them,&quot; he stated with a wink.<br />
<br />
The blonde then proceeded to sway his hips with the competition music that had begun playing. He was going to make this win count with a strip tease that was sure to get everyone going. He grabbed at his package, making sure to look at the camera as did so. He then proceeded to spin around and drop to the floor, so that he was squatting with his hands on his khakis. The blonde then unbuckled and unbuttoned those khakis so that as he slowly rose, his pants did not. Once he was standing again, he turned so that his ass was facing the audience and bent over, giving everyone a nice view as he removed his khakis and tossed them to Micheal, who reflexively threw them to the ground, clearly fuming as it happened.<br />
<br />
Then Eric did something he didn&#39;t even expect to do. Almost unconsciously, he stuck his ass out a bit and began showing the audience more and more, lowering his boxer briefs agonizingly slowly. As he did, he turned his upper half so he could stare directly at the camera with an innocent look, completing the seductive stance. Eventually, he would&#39;ve gotten the underwear completely down, had Brian not intervened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, um, do you have to do that? You already won,&quot; the bald man pleaded. Eric looked at the man. His begging eyes looked completely different than the cold, apathetic stare he had at the start of the show, all because he got really unlucky. At the very least, he could reduce the guy&#39;s pain. He could always take off his boxer briefs later.<br />
<br />
Shrugging, the blonde walked back behind his podium, his pants forgotten and his boxers briefs lowered a bit. &quot;Phew, that was so hot! Well, looks like you win, Eric. I&#39;m guessing you wanna reverse some changes?&quot; Nicky guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; Eric hummed. Not having that reaction to cock would be incredibly helpful, but the blonde wasn&#39;t sure it was the right move. After all, his changes were the thing that caused him to mess up. Changes that Micheal didn&#39;t have. If Eric wanted to win, he knew that Micheal would have to suffer the same problems as him. &quot;Nah, I can always reverse them in another challenge. I choose to raise Micheal&#39;s meter instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Faggot!&quot; Micheal viciously yelled. &quot;What the hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, an eye for an eye,&quot; Eric stated apathetically before turning to the crowd with a devious smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, what a sexy turn of events. Alrighty then, computer, time to twink!&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd cheered as Micheal was shrouded in pink light. This time, Eric didn&#39;t cover his eyes much as he wanted to see as much as possible of his nearing victory. He could almost hear a crying out through the studio&#39;s theme music that blared through the change. He wasn&#39;t sure what that meant but a part of him liked it.<br />
<br />
When the light dissipated, two things were clear. The first was that Micheal&#39;s meter grew a crazy amount. Eric knew that physical challenges had more drastic results and those results got even more drastic with time, but wow. Micheal fucked up. His meter had shot right past the third and fourth tick marks and just lightly past the fifth one. His meter had grown 2.5 ticks! Another mistake and he&#39;d be losing!<br />
<br />
The second thing that changed, however, was that Micheal probably wouldn&#39;t be able to go back to the office. Not with that color hair. His fade had gone from a soft brunette to a startling pink. Eric couldn&#39;t have been sure from where he was standing, but it even seemed natural, if that was possible. Plus, it seemed like that was the only place his body grew hair. The man had a distinct covering of body hair before, but now it was all gone; he was smooth as cream.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Micheal, how&#39;re you feeling? Still feeling energized and sanguine?&quot; Nicky asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha... What does sangu-- sang--u--ine mean? And what does ener--... energ--... that other word mean?&quot; Micheal asked, much to Eric&#39;s glee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo, looks like someone probably lost a couple IQ points. Well, probably more than a couple,&quot; Nicky noted.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn&#39;t! I&#39;m still smart!&quot; Micheal protested.<br />
<br />
Nicky looked at his screen and responded, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t say smart. Actually, I&#39;d say pretty dumb.&quot;<br />
<br />
Micheal blushed at Nicky&#39;s answer. He then looked down at himself with a horrified face, covering his jockstrap with his hands.<br />
<br />
Nicky simply smiled. &quot;Well then, let&#39;s get back to our questions shall we? We&#39;re in our final round now boys, so you know how this part works. The questions may get more difficult, but if you answer correctly, you&#39;ll receive the option to twink your opponent rather than take the money, if you&#39;d like. As always, I advise my contestants to bring their opponents down a notch before getting money, since you stand a better chance of winning and this gets so much more exciting. Anywho, shall we begin?&quot;</p>
