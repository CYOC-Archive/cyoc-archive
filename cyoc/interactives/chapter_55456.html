<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">.....*Brrrrring!*....<br />
<br />
The bell sounding the end of Gym rang and Dylan was glad as he hastily handed the ball back to Mr Bergstrum...who said, &quot;Need a bit of work there, sport,&quot;...and joined the rest of the fifth grade class, hoping that maybe by avoiding Kyla and Xuan, he could stop acting and thinking in what he was sure was a rather girly manner.<br />
<br />
Back to Ms Barker's class and sitting down in his seat, Dylan opened the top of his desk and withdrew a notebook and the math-book from within.<br />
<br />
Looking up, Dylan idly passed the hour, torn between paying attention to what Ms Barker wrote on the blackboard and looking at the girls in the class, wondering what they did in their free time and if they would ever play with him and silently telling himself as he thought this, &quot;They'll probably tell me to go away and that they don't play with babies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly time ticked away and math gave way to English, which gave way to another class and by this time Dylan was really having a hard time paying attention as well as comprehending what was being delivered.<br />
<br />
When the final bell rang for the day, Dylan was all too happy and dashing out of the classroom, he stopped as he suddenly realised that he had to use the bathroom and without giving it a second thought, made his way down the hall and into the girl's toilet, where he promptly ran into Xuan and Kyla.<br />
<br />
Horror passed between the three, and as Dylan stood there thinking, &quot;What have I done,&quot; the two girls looked at each other and grinning, exclaimed, &quot;We should tell teacher that you're a pervert.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, Dylan cried out, &quot;No, it was a mistake. An accident. I wasn't looking or paying attention and I really need to go to the bathroom really badly. Please don't tell. I won't do it again.&quot;<br />
<br />
The grin widened on Kyla and Xuan's face and before Dylan could stop them, they reached for and each grabbing one side of his pants, yanked.<br />
<br />
His pants, which were already hanging loose because of the transformation to his groin and abdomen area, came down easily and upon seeing the underwear that Dylan was wearing, Kyla and Xuan exclaimed, &quot;We really should tell the teacher. Not only is the pervert in the girl's toilet, but also wearing girl's underwear,&quot; and turning to Dylan, Kyla asked, &quot;Do you think you are a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wanting to cry, thinking that the way his privates looked, Dylan hastily pulled up his pants, saying, &quot;I'll do anything,&quot; over and over, sounding like a girl close to tears, forgetting completely the reason for coming into the bathroom in the first place.<br />
<br />
Grinning, Xuan asked, &quot;Anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, Dylan looked from Kyla to Xuan and so close to tears his nose was running, he whimpered out, &quot;Anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at Kyla, Xuan said, &quot;We really ought to tell a teacher,&quot; and catching the cue, Kyla replied back, &quot;But we shouldn't be late for Ballet. Maybe we could take this boy with us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything,&quot; Dylan exclaimed, shifting about.<br />
<br />
The two girls continued to grin at each other and after a moment, Kyla said, &quot;I think I have a change of clothes in my locker,&quot; and dashing out of the bathroom, she left Xuan with Dylan.<br />
<br />
Looking at the boy, watching him shift about and every now and again grab himself like a girl who really had to go, she eventually commented, &quot;You might as well go to the bathroom,&quot; and Dylan started to move toward one of the stalls, she called out, &quot;But the moment you get in there, send out all of your clothes, except the underwear you are wearing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morosely Dylan made his way toward the bathroom stall and wondering how he could get himself out of this situation, not really wanting to undress in the girl's toilet or even go to Ballet class, he looked back at the girl he was sure was supposed to be his friend and pushing open the door, he let himself into the stall.<br />
<br />
Inside, he slowly kicked off his shoes and after a moment’s hesitation, pulled off his socks. Stuffing them into his shoes, he pushed both articles under the door, where they were immediately snatched up by Xuan.<br />
<br />
As he pulled off his shirt, a door opened somewhere and silently he hoped that it wasn't another girl, while at the same time hoped that Kyla was unable to find any clothes in her locker.<br />
<br />
&quot;I found something really cute,&quot; the voice of Kyla echoed throughout the bathroom, and sighing, Dylan tossed his shirt under the door.<br />
<br />
It was only as he was pulling off his pants, and finally realising that it might not just be his mind that might have changed, that he came to terms with the transformation that had taken effect some hours ago.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;No, no, no. This isn't possible,&quot; he kicked his pants under the stall door and after a moment he hesitantly reached down and placed his hand inside the panties he had snitched from the lost and found during recess, telling himself, &quot;There is no way,&quot; over and over.<br />
<br />
Before he could fully come to terms with the transformation, Kyla called out, &quot;Put this on first,&quot; and then slide a denim skirt under the door.<br />
<br />
Picking up the article of clothing, Dylan looked at it and was about to ask how, when he found the hidden zipper on the side.<br />
<br />
A pressure on his bladder reminded him of why he had come in here and sitting down on the toilet, he slowly pushed his underwear down, finally seeing what had changed.<br />
<br />
As Dylan leaned forward, trying to see his new privates, and not having much luck in doing so, he received a nasty jolt as suddenly, and without much thought, he casually spread his legs and a stream of urine shot forth and into the toilet.<br />
<br />
Fetching a wad of toilet paper, he heard Xuan and Kyla laughing as he gently wiped and patted the area between his legs dry.<br />
<br />
As he wondered how it was possible for not only his mind to shift sex and gender, but his privates as well, he heard Kyla whispering, &quot;He even pees like a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pulling up the underwear, feeling embarrassed, but liking how comfortable the underwear felt pressed against his body, Dylan fetched the skirt from where he had dropped it and undoing the zipper, pulled it on.<br />
<br />
As he zipped up the side, the magick from the underwear reached out and touched the skirt. As Dylan stepped of the stall, hugging himself and torn between liking the feeling of the skirt and hating it, the magick renewed itself.<br />
<br />
As Kyla handed Dylan a set of tights and a pair of low-heel shoes, the magick that had transformed his privates surged through the skirt and then touching the boy's thighs, started to transform them as Dylan, in a clumsy manner, started to pull on the tights, to which Kyla and Xuan continued to laugh.<br />
<br />
As the tights touched the skirt and the underwear...and Kyla, between giggling with Xuan, handed Dylan a blouse and undershirt, both of which Dylan thought looked cute...the magick began to transform the rest of Dylan's legs and feet and when Dylan slipped his feet into the shoes, he was torn between surprise and horror to find they fit and made his feet look so cute.<br />
<br />
As he slipped on the undershirt, which touched the skirt, the tights and eventually the underwear, the magick spread. And as Dylan slipped on the blouse and began to button it, he was unaware that from the next down, he was slowly starting to look like a seven year old girl.<br />
<br />
Giggling more, thinking that it was the clothes that made the boy before them look so much like a girl, unaware that he had shrunk from four foot four down to three foot six, they looked at each other and exclaimed, &quot;We really should do something about his hair before Ballet class,&quot; at the same time.<br />
<br />
And before Dylan could stop them, both Kyla and Xuan grabbed his hands, which had shrunk to something more common for a seven year old female, and dragged him from the girl's lavatory.</p>
