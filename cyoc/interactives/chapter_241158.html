<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Her eyes strayed downward, and she spoke quietly. &quot;Here goes nothing . . . please, promise me you won&#39;t scream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell no.&quot; Jacob chuckled. &quot;I see a beautiful woman now, and I&#39;ll see a beautiful woman afterward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elle covered her eyes and shook her head, smiling.  She chuckled before licking her lips - and then her eyes took on a more seductive glint. <br />
 She began peeling off her trench coat and letting it slip from her shoulders.<br />
<br />
She met his gaze. “First up . . .”<br />
<br />
Jacob tilted his head, having already thrown off his shirt. “Yeah?”<br />
<br />
Elle took a slow breath, her fingers tracing the hem of her dress.  Its short sleeves fell off, and peeled the rest of its bodice with them until the dress&#39; upper half hung at her waist.  She crossed her legs nervously.  Her generous bosom, freed, jiggled as it heaved up and down.<br />
In the place of regular nipples lay slightly puffy, well-shaven, glisteningly pink, puckered anal sphincters.<br />
Elle flexed them, and biting her lip she strained slightly.  A stream of milk bubbled out of each, and coating her left hand in it, she then licked it seductively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not too bad, right?&quot;  She asked, bracing for a strong reaction.<br />
<br />
Jacob was frozen in the middle of taking off his pants, eyes wide.  &quot;Pardon my French, but that was the sexiest shit I&#39;ve seen in 20 years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emboldened, Elle stepped forward, allowing the dress to slip lower, revealing her flawless skin.  &quot;Well, now for the first big surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
From below, another voice spoke—softer, sultry, but distinct.  &quot;Well uh . . . H-Hiiiiiiiiiiii Jaaacob . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
As the dress fell to the floor, Jacob’s eyes wandered slowly down. The realization hit him in waves as she revealed more, his breath hitching as he took in the impossible, the strange, the undeniable truth of what the Fusion Wave had done to her.  His eyes locked on to her groin.  In the place of a vagina and and anus were two very large, sultry, kissable lips, twice as big as the Triple HuddleBurger Elle had eaten at the Huddle House.  It was so big that its corners rested an inch past their inguinal grooves.  Both were drooling, almost uncontrollably, and the &quot;vagina-mouth&quot; was biting its lip nervously.  Elle&#39;s groin was red somehow, and it would appear that it was flushed.  So was Elle, and she rubbed her hair, vexed.<br />
<br />
Both lips spoke in unison, echoing a voice with a naturally alluring, arousing articulation.  It was also incredibly flustered. &quot;H-Hello!  I&#39;m Ellie, uh, Elle&#39;s bodymate!  Ba-Basically, we&#39;re twin-t-twins, just had our minds split to, uh, different parts of our body!  I . . . control her legs, and I&#39;ve been hearing you all night.  Y-you sound like a great guy! . . . S-shit, I haven&#39;t spoken to anyone l-like this in months . . .&quot;<br />
&quot;Do we, uh, sc-scare you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob viewed Elle, Ellie and their entire shared body, Elle&#39;s beet red face, Ellie&#39;s quivering lips.  Ellie was there the entire evening and he had no idea.  She had been hidden away, terrified, by a still more terrified Elle for god-knows how long.  That was torture.<br />
<br />
Ellie took a step back as Elle whispered, about to cry.  Her eyes darted to Jacob and away. &quot;Th-this wasn&#39;t a good id-&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t even finish the sentence before Jacob, clad only in underwear, rushed forward and embraced her, burying his lips into hers, and gently rolling both of their bodies onto the bed.  Elle&#39;s eyes went from shock to bliss as she reciprocated, moaning deeply, and the two lovebirds French-kissed for a minute, arms and hands cradling each others&#39; backs, necks, and heads passionately.  Jacob abruptly disengaged to scoot downwards, and did the same with Ellie, his entire face buried into her frontal mouth.<br />
<br />
Giddy tittering and sensual grunting turned to outright laughter as the three cuddled and kissed in bed.  Jacob held the twins tight. &quot;Best damn idea of my life!&quot;<br />
<br />
After complimenting each other with racy whispers, Jacob began to gently kiss the ladies&#39; body - Elle&#39;s head and neck, to their supple breasts, and then to their hips, glorious buttocks, and Ellie&#39;s lips.  They lay, embracing tightly, breaths quickening.<br />
Time to get hotter.<br />
<br />
Jacob went to kiss Elle again, placing his hands gently on the back of her neck.  When their lips locked, Elle moaned louder than he expected, and to his surprise, something shot with moderate force from her mouth into his, and it sure wasn&#39;t spit.  It was lightly . . . salty.<br />
<br />
Elle pulled back abruptly.  Though there was a twinge of shock and embarrassment in her slightly nervous face and eyes, she was excited as she tried to speak.  &quot;Shit!  Forgaht to tell oou a-abouwt tuh lasht ting!&quot; Elle&#39;s mouth was full of a sort of thick, clear saliva that she swallowed to no avail, as it filled right back up and dripped out of the corners of her lips.  Her face was very rosy, and she was sweating profusely.  Veins stood out across her neck, which Jacob dared to guess . . . was longer?<br />
<br />
Elle tried to speak, but all that left her lips were dribbles of the strange liquid - and a deep moan, as she clenched her eyes shut in apparent pleasure.  Jacob was prepared to express his concern, but Ellie explained, her voice more confident and playful now:<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry silly!  Her head and neck . . .&quot; Ellie raised her foot and placed it on Jacob&#39;s member. &quot;. . . double as something sexy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elle brought her hands from Jacob&#39;s hips up to her neck, taking the chance to trace her fingers up her lovely figure (and breasts) while doing so.  She mouthed a &quot;Watch this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Placing both her hands gently but firmly around the base of her neck, Elle began to gently stroke it.  Up and down, up and down, again and again, slowly, with each sensual breath.<br />
<br />
Jacob lay on the bed, propped up against its bedrest, as Ellie maneuvered the twins&#39; shared body over to kneel on the head.  As the lower lips wore the most seductive smile he had ever seen, Jacob brought his attention to Ellie.  She was red and moaning in pleasure, her veined penis neck growing an inch with every other stroke, and her mouth barely containing the precum that would otherwise be dribbling down her neck&#39;s length and chest in spurts.<br />
<br />
But she gave Jacob a look with eyes squinting in glee.  A smile just like Ellie&#39;s.  It meant that both of them were in the mood, for sure, but to Jacob it also was one of . . . contentment?  Happiness?<br />
No . . . it was one of Love.<br />
<br />
By the time three minutes had passed, Elle could barely contain herself.  Her veined neck had lengthened to about a foot and a quarter, and it and her head were throbbing just like any normal male member.  While Jacob had been lost in her eyes and face, a pair of tennis-ball sized testicles had inflated at the base of her neck, dangling in front of her breasts.  They looked, somehow, feminine.<br />
<br />
As Elle put her arms in tune with Ellie&#39;s legs, they crawled slowly and sensually up the bed, and straddled Jacob.  With Elle&#39;s penis neck, the twins were much taller, or longer than Jacob, so some &quot;leaning back&quot; was necessary.<br />
<br />
Elle&#39;s face hovered in front of Jacob&#39;s, her reddened cheeks, warm smile, and glimmer in her eyes irresistible.  He took her head in his hands gently, and leaned in for a kiss.<br />
<br />
Ellie, not forgotten, put his legs between hers and squeezed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You lost the bet . . . time to pay up!&quot;</p>
