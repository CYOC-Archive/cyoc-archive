<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yes. You heard me right. My sister, Sarah, is a werewolf.  You may ask on how I found out, well it all started <br />
when Sarah and I left the library after she helped me with my history homework.<br />
<br />
As Sarah and I left the campus library “Thanks for letting us stay Ms. Chance,” She says,” We sure appreciate <br />
it.” The librarian replied “No problem, I wish there were more students like you two eager to learn.”  As we <br />
left the library, I said “Thanks for helping me with my homework Sarah, I do appreciate it.” She replies, <br />
“Your welcome Jeramy, I’m sure you’ll pass the history exam tomorrow.” As Sarah and I walked away from the <br />
library towards the campus quad, I heard “HEY DWEEB! GET AWAY FROM MY GIRLFRIEND!” as one of the campus <br />
seniors along with two of his friends approaches us. Sarah seems to know him as she says “Oh no, not him.”  I <br />
asked her “You know him?” The senior yells “DON’T EVEN TALK TO HER!” as he shoves me violently. Sarah says <br />
“There’s something you should know about him Richard, he’s….” Richard didn’t give a chance to let Sarah finish <br />
her sentence by saying “DEAD MEAT!” He then punched me in the eye so hard; I lost my balance and fell on the <br />
sidewalk hitting my head on the concrete walkway knocking me out.<br />
<br />
(switch to Sarah’s P.O.V.)<br />
I watched in horror as that meathead Richard knocked out my own brother “JERAMY!” I cried as he is knocked <br />
out. “Come Sarah, let’s grab a burger and plan our evening.” Richard said. I replied “No.”  as I slapped his <br />
hand away “Oh, come on.” Says Richard “What does that looser have that I don’t have?” I replied “A sister that <br />
care for him, you knocked out my own brother.” Rage filled me triggering my transformation. Brown fur began to <br />
sprout on my arms as I continue to tell Richard off. “As I was about to say before you interrupted me,” my <br />
voice began to deepen “He’s my brother Jeramy!” Black claws began to grow from my cubicles “I don’t want any <br />
part of you, because your short tempered and too egotisticle.” My muscles grew in mass as the pressure of it <br />
tore off my shirt. Richard gasps as he looks into my eyes and sees that they are amber instead of blue. My <br />
feet turns into digigrade paws causing me to stand taller, a tail formed at the base of my spine.<br />
“OH SHIT! SHE’S ONE OF THEM!” says one of his friends, “Come on Richard, lets get out of here before she <br />
decides to tear us apart.” Says the other. Ears grew pointed and moved to the top of my head as my mouth and <br />
nose grew out into a lupine muzzle completing my transformation, I let out a loud howl causing Richard and his <br />
two friends to run the opposite direction “THAT’S RIGHT!” I roared “GET AWAY FROM ME BEFORE I REGRET ONE WHAT <br />
I’M GOING TO DO TO YOU RICHARD!” I would have gone after Richard and make him pay for what he did, but right <br />
now Jeramy is more important.<br />
<br />
I went to Jeramy’s  side, picked up his hand with and touched his wrist trying to find a pulse, I barely felt <br />
it so I leaned down to his chest and used my heightened hearing to get a heartbeat and found it. Thank <br />
goodness he’s alive. I picked up both our backpacks, slung them on to my back,  picked Jeramy up  cradling him <br />
in my lupine hands and head towards my Sorority house lightly jumping from roof to roof. <br />
I entered the Lambda Beta Pi house, seeing that no one is around. I placed Jeramy on the couch and I thought <br />
twice, not wanting to make Jeramy more upset I decided to change back first I went to my room revert back to <br />
human quickly and put on a change of clothes. As I went back to Jeramy’s side I saw Amanda, the house mother <br />
and alpha “Sarah?” she says “Who is this and why is he here after visiting hours?” I explained to her on what <br />
happened until now, she then said “You brought your brother here and not the nurses office?” “Sorry Ma’am,” I <br />
said “I was worried about him.” Amanda just nodded as more of my packmates came in one(Brittany) still in <br />
werewolf form. “Who’s this?” says Jessie “I don’t know,” replied Brittany, but I hope he hasn’t got a <br />
girlfriend yet, he looks cute.” Amanda says “This is Sarah’s brother Jeramy, Richard knocked him out. Someone <br />
help me bring me to my room, at least we can do is to treat is head and eye. I got an ice pack in the mini-<br />
fridge. Brittany? Do me a favor and get one of the frozen steaks from the freezer downstairs.” Brittany growls <br />
“I thought we already ate dinner.” Amanda says “It’s not for me, it’s for Jeramy. We need to treat the <br />
swelling in his eye.”<br />
<br />
As Brittany went downstairs, I helped Amanda carry Jeramy into her room setting him onto her bed in a sitting <br />
position. Amanda put the ice pack on his head and we see him blinking his eyes &quot;Ah good,&quot; says Amanda, &quot;He's <br />
coming to.&quot;<br />
<br />
(back to Jeramy's P.O.V.)<br />
I woke up with a splitting headache and something cold touching me, I looked around and I'm in someone's <br />
bedroom, in front of me is Sarah and a woman. &quot;Are you okay Jeramy?&quot; says Sarah &quot;I'm fine, where am I?&quot; the <br />
woman replied &quot;Your in the Lambda Beta Pi house, I'm Amanda tne house mother for the Sarority.&quot; I asked &quot;Who <br />
was that guy claimed to be your boyfriend?&quot; Sarah responds &quot;That was Richard and he's not my boyfriend.&quot; I <br />
looked at a wall with movie posters and noticed they have a simular theme, werewolves. &quot;Sense when you were <br />
into werewolf movies Sarah?&quot; that's when I heard a knock and Amanda says &quot;Come in!&quot; the door opens and a <br />
werewolf comes in with a frozen porterhouse steak. &quot;Here's the steak you asked for.&quot; &quot;Whoa!&quot; was my reaction. <br />
Amanda says &quot;First of all, this is my bedroom and we're a pack of werewolves, including your sister Sarah.&quot; I <br />
put the steak over my eye and reacted &quot;Don't worry Jeramy, we're not going to harm you.&quot; The werewolf ran her <br />
claw down my shirt &quot;I hope your available, your too cute.&quot; it growled, I wenced in pain as it touched me. &quot;Oh <br />
come on,&quot; says the werewolf, &quot;I didn't touch you too hard.&quot;  I placed the steak and the icepack on the the <br />
plate. &quot;Sorry Sarah.&quot; I removed my tshirt revealing bruises on my chest, stomech, back and shoulders. &quot;I meant <br />
to show you this.&quot; Everyone stared at me in horror including the werewolf. &quot;My god,&quot; Sarah said &quot;Why didn't <br />
you show me this earlier?&quot; I replied &quot;I didn't want you to worry.&quot;  Amanda looked at me, &quot;You let all those <br />
bullies beat you up? Why didn't have that treated at the nurses office?&quot; I bowed my head &quot;Like I have any <br />
choice, and they treatened to kill me if I was treated.&quot; Sarah and Amanda nodded to each other  &quot;If Sarah <br />
doesn't mind, perhapse we'll make you a werewolf. Besides, Brittany has a liking to you.&quot;  &quot;Brittany?&quot; I asked <br />
&quot;Me, loverboy.&quot; replied the werewolf. I said &quot;That's all well in good, but there's one problem.&quot; Amanda asks <br />
&quot;What's the problem.&quot; I said &quot;I'm not sarority material.&quot;</p>
