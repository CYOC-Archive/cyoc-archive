<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While it was considered simple fare; for Peter Talbot, the oatmeal he was eating was like a fresh kill sliding down his gullet. Not having anything to eat since Friday; Peter’s only sustenance since being shot was an I.V drip comprised of a saline solution and simple broth. Ravaging the bowl and the few slices of toast that came with it; Leon looked at his son with a bemused look upon him.<br />
“The crunchy bits are your fingers,” Leon jokingly comments as he watches Peter devour his late breakfast; “or the spoon.”<br />
“Ha ha,” Peter looking at his father; “you try and resist the urge to hose down food after not eating for days.”<br />
“Fair point,” Leon getting up; “but you should know eating that fast will only give you belly issues the long run. Slow down the next time you eat.”<br />
“Think you could get mom to come by with some of her cooking;” Peter licking the bowl clean; “that or a greasy burger or two?”<br />
“I’ll let her know,” Leon chuckling; “now get some rest. With any luck will have you back home in time for supper tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
Peter watches his father finally leave the hospital room he was currently convalescing in. Despite the fact that the ward Peter was on, is a ward for weres; the were-lion was not allowed to wander about due to the fact he was in his fursona. Stuck inside his room and unable to shift back into his human form for fear of re-opening his wound in his abdomen held together with surgical staples. Peter looks at the wound; seeing the fur shaved off growing back, he runs his paw over it. Feeling the cold metal staples, wincing as the area is still sore and tender. Yet Peter knows the wound is healing fast; earlier in the morning a few of the staples popped as he relieved himself with the toilet for the first time.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Helen Tompkins stared at herself in the mirror; her cold shower clearly not helping in quelling her heat. She stared panting as the only thing on her mind was one thing.<br />
“For Christ sakes girl, admit it. You love him.”<br />
“Who’s there,” Helen turning around; “come out now!”<br />
“Turn around Helen.”<br />
<br />
Helen turns around to stare at herself in the mirror; Only she is staring at herself in her were-rabbit fursona. The light grey fur up and down her body with white covering her abdomen; her cute pink button nose capping off her short muzzle, with large white buck teeth visible. The large foot long ears that seem to have a mind of their own; grey fur with a small trim of white at the edges. The only part of Helen’s reflection staring back at her that was human was her brilliant blue eyes; unchanged when in her fursona.<br />
“You have to admit,” Helen’s reflection speaking; “Peter is something.”<br />
“Your just my imagination talking,” Helen gasping; “my animal desire demanding satisfaction.”<br />
“Well,” Helen’s reflection smirking; “you are partly right. Your heat is making you mad with lust; yet you know cold showers are not going to cut it this time.”<br />
“I wouldn’t be dealing with this insatiable desire,” Helen looking distraught; “if the warren gathering wasn’t cancelled due to the were-alert.”<br />
“Perhaps,” Helen’s were-rabbit reflection grinning; “yet you cannot deny those feeling for the were-lion.”<br />
“He is crude and oafish,” Helen snapping; “despite his… assets, I’d rather hump a cactus.”<br />
“Please don’t go that far,” The were-rabbit refection chuckling; “if I were you, and I am, I’d give Peter a chance.”<br />
<br />
Helen just stares as her reflection in the mirror as it shift back to her human form; standing on shaky legs; Helen stumbles to a nearby bench to get dressed; knowing her mind is clearly addled and impaired with lustful desires, Helen curses herself for what she knows is true.<br />
“God dam that were-lion is gorgeous.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
The guards outside of Peter’s hospital room idly chat as Peter’s doctor comes back to the ward. Watching her approach with her clipboard they let her through but not without getting the same tantalizing scent like earlier, only stronger.<br />
<br />
Just as Peter was getting settled in his recovery bed, he hears his door opening. Thinking it’s an uncle to come pay him a visit; Peter is surprised to see his doctor locking the door behind her.<br />
“Despite your injury and current condition,” Helen looking flushed; “you still need some exercise. Physiotherapy.”<br />
“And just what did you have in mind,” Peter smelling his doctor’s arousal coming through strong.<br />
“I think you know,” Helen Tompkins approaching the were-lion; “I know you can smell my heat. My desire; my need to be satisfied.”<br />
<br />
Peter roars seductively as he places his paws on Helen’s frame; gingerly helping her remove her clothes as he places his nose next to her skin and inhales greedily.<br />
“You smell wonderful,” Peter growls; “good enough to devour.”<br />
“Wait till you sample my juices,” Helen removing her pants and quickly dropping her panties.<br />
<br />
Peter purrs loudly as he takes in more of Helen’s intoxicating aroma. His leonine member throbbing and pulsing; Peter looks at Helen as she stares at him longingly, her body shifting into her were-rabbit fursona.<br />
“I need you now,” Helen exploring Peter’s furry body; placing her paws on his mane and ruffling it; “take me now.”<br />
“Gladly,” Peter growls; taking the were-rabbit to his bed and climbing on top of her.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Outside of the hospital room, members of Peter’s family ensuring he is kept safe can hear the moaning and growling; it didn’t take a genius to figure out what was going on in the room.<br />
“Is the doctor…”<br />
“Yep. Did you not smell her heat?”<br />
“Is that what I smelled?<br />
“OH god more Peter!”<br />
“Should we not tell the king?”<br />
“Let the Prince have his fun. King Leon will at least be relieved his son is doing a lot better. Plus from the sounds of things inside; the doctor seems to be eager for the prince, despite the fact that she is a were-rabbit.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Back inside Peter’s hospital room; Peter’s wild rut with his were-rabbit doctor went from the small bed to the cold linoleum floor. Helen on all fours; she moans and sighs as Peter mounts her and spears her with his barbed member. Helen crying in joy as the barbs flex and dig into her canal; the were-rabbit screams in joy as each thrust from Peter causes her to shudder in orgasmic joy.<br />
<br />
Peter was growling in joy as he eagerly pounded the were-rabbit under him; his paws holding onto the petite were-rabbit’s shoulders as he completely envelops her entire body with his. Her scent blinding his other senses as he continues to thrust inside of her like mad; his balls beginning to clench as he feels his orgasm building. Slowing his thrusting, but pushing in with such force; the were-lion lets out a mighty roar as he lets loose his seed with in Helen&#39;s hungry womb, his barbed feline penis pulse with each spurt of cum.<br />
<br />
In the midst of the frenzied rutting; Peter’s I.V was ripped from him and the furniture in his room broken as he and Helen ravaged each other’s bodies. Now lying on the floor, Peter holds Helen closely as she mumbles; her entire body lit up and on fire with the many orgasms she felt. Feeling Peter’s member flex and twitch as it spurted his seed in her, only made her sigh in pure delight.<br />
“Don’t let go,” Helen manages to mumble; “hold me like this for as long as possible.”<br />
“I’ll hold you to the end of time if need be,” Peter enjoying his afterglow; “the moment I laid eyes on you, I knew you were the one for me.”<br />
“Do you think anyone heard us,” Helen slowly drifting asleep.<br />
“I’m sure the whole building heard us,” Peter purring; “me most of all.”<br />
<br />
Helen doesn’t continue the conversation; she just continues to mumble and sigh in pure contentment. Feeling completely sated for the first time in a long while; she drifts off asleep within Peter’s embrace, not caring that she committed an ethical no-no. Peter for the most part, felt content; a sense of pride that he found his soulmate. Carefully laying the doctor down; Peter grabs a blanket and drapes it over them as best he can. Letting her use his arm as a pillow as he spoons her; the were-lion purrs happily as he watches Helen’s white furry chest move up and down as she sleeps next to him.</p>
