<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Riley gradually woke up the next morning, surprised that he did so on his own. He didn&#39;t hear his alarm clock, so he figured he must have woken up a bit early. He looked at his clock and sat up in shock. It was already 10:45! He had missed his entire reading class at 9AM. He groaned to himself. He must have turned off his alarm in his sleep when it went off. His anger quickly subsided; &quot;So what? You missed one class. Not a big deal at all&quot;. Normally he would have been mortified to have slept through a class, let alone on his third day, but he strangely didn&#39;t seem to mind. His second class was in a couple hours, so he didn&#39;t have to rush now.<br />
<br />
Riley noticed that he had a case of morning wood again. &quot;Uggh, what is with me?&quot;, he thought. He pulled the covers back and saw that he was tenting his tighty whiteys pretty far. Riley thought it looked bigger than usual, but played it off as a trick of the eyes. Unbeknowst to Riley, he was over a full inch longer than he was before. His old package was just under 3 and a half inches long, and now he was about 4 inches and 3/4. Riley also noticed a small wet spot the size of a penny on the front of his briefs. Riley had no idea what it was, and decided it must not be important. He noticed his balls sill ached from last night. He reached his hand in his briefs and cupped his balls. He noticed they felt a bit heavier or bigger, but not by much. He felt his hand get tickled by some hair in his briefs. He pulled the waistband up and saw that the normally wispy blond hairs had darkened and thickened up a bit in the middle of the night. It was still a very sparse covering, maybe only a couple dozen or so, but the hairs were now solid brown and a lot thicker. As he scratched the itchy hairs, he thought they might be a bit longer too. He began to panic a bit, but his mind became a bit foggy and his panic subsided. Part of his mind kept insisting that everything was normal and nothing was wrong. &quot;Huh. Must be going through a growth spurt or something. I woudn&#39;t be the first guy to have one in college!&quot;, he finally concluded. He took one last look at his crotch. It was certainly a little bigger and hairier, but still way below the average of what he had seen in gym class with his peers. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s it. Nothing to worry about. Just a growth spurt!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Riley walked to the bathroom, idly scratching one of his pits and his chest. He was surprised to see Kyle in the bathroom. &quot;Hey dude&quot;, Riley said to his roommate. Riley thoughts began to race again:<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Dude&#39;, I never say &#39;dude&#39;. Why did I say that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why wouldn&#39;t you? You say it all the time, don&#39;t you remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley thought for a moment; &quot;Huh, I guess I do say it a lot. Wonder why I thought the opposite&quot;.<br />
<br />
Kyle glanced over at Riley who had just walked in the bathroom. &quot;Hey, man&quot;, Kyle said, returning the greeting.&quot;How was your first class of the day, Kyle?&quot;, Riley asked. &quot;Oh I skipped it. I was tired. I probably didn&#39;t miss much anyways&quot;. Kyle miss a class? That sure didn&#39;t sound like him.<br />
<br />
Riley noticed that Kyle was just wearing boxers. &quot;Boxers? Kyle never wears boxers?&quot;, he thought. Riley&#39;s eyes trailed down and looked at the modest bulge in his friends boxers. He felt a small tingling in his groin. He realized what he was doing and quickly averted his eyes. Riley glanced up and saw that Kyle had a razor in his hand and a strip of white shaving cream over his upper lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, what are you doing? I THOUGHT YOU JUST shaved last week?&quot;, Riley inquired, his voice cracking quite loudly in the middle of his question. Riley cleared his throat, thinking that would help. Like Riley, Kyle only had to shave about twice a month; they just didn&#39;t grow that much facial hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Riley, I did. Don&#39;t know why but I had a few dark brown hairs growing out of my lip this morning. Not a big deal. Ill just shave them off quickly&quot;. Kyle looked at Riley&#39;s face and focused a bit harder. &quot;Plus, your one to talk Riley, you got a little bit of scruff, too&quot;, Kyle added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scruff?!&quot;, Riley exclaimed. &quot;Yeah dude, here&quot;, Kyle said as he reached his hand up to his friends face. He took two of his fingers and stroked the wispy hairs on Rileys chin. Normally, Riley would have been taken aback by Kyle touching his face, but he didn&#39;t even think twice about it this morning.<br />
<br />
Riley sidled over to the mirror and looked. It was true. He had about 6 or 7 long brown hairs on his chin. They were pretty thick and they were somewhat noticable. He felt them with his hands, and they felt pretty thick. &quot;It&#39;s only a few hairs, I wouldn&#39;t exactly call them scruff. Ill just shave them when im done WITH MY SHOWER&quot;, Riley said, his voice breaking again. &quot;Why is my voice cracking? I must be getting a cold&quot;, he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Im all done with my shower, so go ahead Riley. I&#39;ll just be in he living room playing some video games&quot;.<br />
<br />
Kyle quickly shaved and left the bathroom to Riley. Riley undressed and hopped in the shower. His mind was wandering as he soaped himself up. Suddenly, out of nowhere, an intrusive thought popped into his head; &quot;I wonder how big Kyle&#39;s cock is?&quot;. &quot;What, why would I think about that? That&#39;s gross! And I&#39;m not gay!&quot;, he shook his head and the thought quickly went away. He finished how shower and got out. He looked a his reflection in the mirror. Aside from the few hairs on his chin, he looked the same. Well, his arms did look a bit bigger and his chest a big broader, but that was probably just an illusion from the mirror. He grabbed the shaving cream and rid his chin of the new hair.<br />
<br />
Riley left the bathroom to get dressed. He picked up a fresh pair of whitey tighties, thought about it, and put them down. He had an old pair of his brother&#39;s boxers that he had accidentally packed, that he wanted to wear. His briefs were obviously shrunk too much for him to wear. He also picked up his button down shirt, and opted for a t shirt instead. He threw on his tight khaki pants, however. He didn&#39;t want to look like a total slob. He saw that his pants rode a couple inches up his ankle. &quot;Huh, guess that shrunk too!&quot;. He saw that his ankles had some wispy brown hairs on them. He pulled up the pant legs and saw his whole leg had that wispy brown peach fuzz up it. The hairs were still thin but he could have sworn he had almost no leg hair before. &quot;Sure you did&quot;, a thought popped into his head, &quot;Of course you had leg hair before, you&#39;ve had some hair there for a long time&quot;. Riley was confused; he suddenly did remember having leg hair before, but he also could have sworn he didn&#39;t have any yesterday. Hmm. Riley shrugged and continued on with his day.<br />
<br />
He saw that Kyle was in the living room wearing a tight T shirt and athletic shorts. Kyle was doing push up on the floor. Riley had never known Kyle to work out before. &quot;Hey dude, what ARE YOU DOING&quot;, Riley inquired, with his voice cracking for the third time today. Kyle stopped and turned to see his friend; &quot;Oh hey, just some push ups. I figured if I want to impress all these hot girls on campus, I should start somewhere&quot;. <br />
<br />
Riley thought about it. He was surprised that he felt like doing some push ups, too. However, Riley had to get to class. He said his goodbyes and quickly walked to class.</p>
