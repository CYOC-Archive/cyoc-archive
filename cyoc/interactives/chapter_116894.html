<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben Twist stood on the front porch of his girlfriend&#39;s home and rang the doorbell.<br />
Within seconds, Kenya Adaeze answered. Since it was after dark now, she was already in her werepanthress form.<br />
&quot;Hello my Benjamin,&quot; she said happily, giving her boyfriend a romantic kiss as she wrapped her furry arms around him. &quot;You haven&#39;t changed yet?&quot; she observed, noting that he was still in his human form and fully dressed.<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t sure how this night was going to go,&quot; he admitted, stepping inside the Adaeze residence. As Kenya closed the door behind him, Ben kicked off his shoes and started stripping to prevent ripping his clothes when he released his inner werewolf.<br />
They could hear her aunt and uncle in the kitchen, so Kenya playfully cupped his exposed penis in one paw and smiled at him as Ben dropped his pants and underwear.<br />
Soon Ben was relishing the feeling of fur spreading across his body as he gained height and muscle, bulking up as his tail sprouted from his rear and his facial features started rearranging themselves.<br />
Moments later, there was a tall werewolf standing happily before his lover.<br />
&quot;So my darling, what would you like to do tonight?&quot; wondered Kenya, staring at him.<br />
&quot;I still have my normal curfew,&quot; he answered, explaining about the visitors using the guest bedroom as a new weretiger was being ushered into the world*, &quot;but unless you had other plans, I&#39;d like to just stay here and hang out. You know, get to know my future in-laws better,&quot; Ben added, referring to the fact that as soon as he turned 18 and could legally do so, he fully intended to ask Kenya for her paw in marriage.<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love that,&quot; Kenya replied, taking his paw in hers. &quot;Maybe the four of us can nuke some popcorn and play board games together,&quot; she suggested, while leading him into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Peter Talbot and Karen Yuletide were at the Baptist church decorating it for the wedding of Jennifer Harper and Harry Jenkins that Saturday morning.<br />
The deacon that greeted them was surprised that the couple had so few boxes with them.<br />
&quot;The bride and groom to be prefer to keep things simple,&quot; explained Karen, as everything was brought inside during just one trip between herself and Peter.<br />
&quot;I see. Well, we&#39;ve already been informed as to the... unusual circumstances surrounding the nuptials,&quot; replied the deacon, referring to the possible trouble arriving from Alabama in the form of Dieter Wilhelm and Jennifer&#39;s family. &quot;A shame as to what happened to that poor girl,&quot; the deacon said, referring to Jennifer being turned into a werevixen against her will by the rogue Yvette Smith. &quot;As a fellow were myself, no one has that right, for gaining a fursona is not a matter to be taken lightly.&quot;<br />
&quot;I totally agree with that,&quot; replied Karen, referring to the fact she was still a normal human being.<br />
For now, as she looked lovingly at Peter.<br />
&quot;Anyway, we&#39;re prepared for both ceremonies,&quot; the deacon added, thinking about the fact that there would be 2 services. A formal one for the couple to officially be married before the one held just for the potential troublemakers to break up and make a scene. &quot;The police have been here a couple of times already, checking out the perimeter, as they say and making advance security arrangements. But we&#39;ve been assured by both them, the Skulk, and Tachibana Security that all will be well.&quot;<br />
&quot;It certainly will,&quot; Peter confirmed. &quot;There will also be members of my pride and the local werewolf pack here for added security.&quot;<br />
&quot;So God&#39;s House will be well secured,&quot; the deacon commented. &quot;I&#39;ll be sure to pass word along to the Reverend. Now, unless you two need some help, I still have some paperwork to attend to concerning this weekend&#39;s Sunday School agenda, so if you will excuse me...&quot;<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take Peter and Karen long to decorate for the wedding. Some bunting and white streamers along the main aisle from the first couple of pew rows to the altar. A little more bunting on either side of the main doors leading into the chapel itself and they were done.<br />
Deciding to wait for the deacon to return before leaving, Peter and Karen sat down next to each other in a pew near the middle of the assemblage.<br />
Peter was silent, respecting the sanctity of where they were and not wanting to intrude upon his girlfriend&#39;s thoughts uninvited. He knew their feelings for each other were strong, and in his case growing stronger every day.<br />
Yet despite how Karen felt about him, Peter also knew that she still had some reservations, all of which centered around the (were)lion practice of maintaining a harem of (were)lionesses while still being married to the mother of his cubs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peter,&quot; began Karen, finally breaking the silence.<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you feel about Valentine&#39;s Day?&quot;<br />
He assumed the suggested date was in regards to their own potential wedding, so replied, &quot;Actually, if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d prefer to wed sooner. That way we could start our new lives together sooner.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s sweet,&quot; she said, leaning against him. &quot;I do want to be with you, and I&#39;d have no problem becoming your lioness,&quot; added Karen, thinking about how her own induction into were society would go. &quot;But my main, actually, my only concern is still the thought of sharing you with others.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; replied Peter, gently putting an arm around Karen. &quot;No pressure. But while there are times when it would be absolutely necessary for me to have sex with another woman, like when a new member wants to become a lioness at the paws of the werelion prince or whenever my father retires and makes me king, you are the only one who will ever occupy my heart.&quot;<br />
&quot;I have been with a woman sexually before,&quot; confessed Karen, which was news to Peter. &quot;Not the highlight of my sex life, but under the right circumstances, not something I&#39;d say no to again if ever offered.&quot;<br />
Peter didn&#39;t know how to respond to that. Weres did have higher libidos than normal human beings, and once Karen became a lioness...<br />
<i>Would she really...?</i> he wondered silently. &quot;Karen, I—&quot;<br />
&quot;Peter Talbot, I love you,&quot; she said, turning to face him. &quot;I&#39;ll share you if I have to, but I don&#39;t want to lose you.&quot;<br />
&quot;You never have to worry about that beloved,&quot; he said, taking both of her hands in his. &quot;My heart already is and shall always be yours.&quot;<br />
Karen smiled, and Peter thought there might have been a small tear in the corner of her eye as she leaned against him again.<br />
&quot;I still want to wait until after both Jenny and Harry, and now Huck and Betty have had their weddings, before you propose,&quot; she reminded him, &quot;but when the time comes...&quot;<br />
&quot;I shall be the luckiest man in the world, and will do my best to make you happy for the rest of our lives,&quot; Peter promised Karen, before kissing the top of her head.<br />
&quot;Whether or not you ever do inherit your father&#39;s throne, you are my lion king,&quot; she told him, snuggling closer. &quot;The rest we&#39;ll just have to take one day at a time,&quot; Karen added, as a smile crossed Peter&#39;s face. <br />
