<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He got horny watching his girlfriend ride Sarah not once but twice. Now with Sarah as a flesh light he was going to use her. He aimed his penis to her hole and touched it lightly, causing it to tense for a moment. He pressed in seeing her lips slowly spread with a wet noise. Once his head was in, he went forward til he couldn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
Sarah felt the walls of her body spread and the outside of her rubber form flex as bit as he inserted himself completely into her. First her clit became huge so she barely fit in Brooke and now she was in the same position as he filled her. He began stroking her body over his member as he felt her pussy leak juices. She was getting wetter but now could let him enter quicker while still being tight.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes he finally came causing her to cum from the feeling of semen stuffing her. He pulled her off letting their juices drip into the trashcan next to him. He was going to leave her like this. He loved using her for pleasure but now he needed more things. He had an idea.<br />
<br />
With Brooke still resting again he went to the window and looked outside. He could clearly see a lot of people walking as well as a few groups at the park. He had targets. Now just to figure out what to do.<br />
<br />
He got fully dressed and went downstairs.  He got to the park and started filming.  He basically zoomed in and out and got most of the people there. Now to wait.<br />
<br />
Early on he saw a cute blonde girl with what seemed to be her best friend.  An Asian girl with a rack too big for her frame. Almost looked fake but they seemed to be college students so probably not through surgery. They were wearing tank tops and shorts showing off their legs as they sat down in the grass away from the other groups. He ran back to his home and started editing their picture before clicking enter. He then rushed back to where they were seeing noone there. He got closer and saw something shiny reflecting in the sun. It was two condoms with each girls face on em.<br />
<br />
He quickly picked them up before anyone could notice and walked back to his home. Inside he opened up the editor and started shifting things. Eventually he was satisfied and chose to also alter reality with these two. The changes already began as he saw the wrappers raise from the floor.<br />
<br />
Cathy was a freshman at a near by college.  She didn&#39;t really have a major and just wanted to go for the parties and boys. Jenna was her best friend who always stood up for her when some basic girls teased her for not maturing early like them. Eventually when she entered her senior year she got a growth spirt and now owned two D size breast with the ass of a fitness model. <br />
<br />
Cathy felt weird being a wrapper. She felt herself as the wrapping and as the condom inside. Being g moved inside she felt jolts of pleasure from time to time. The condom essentially became her vagina and it&#39;s lips were moving about her insides. <br />
<br />
Then she was placed still and felt herself growing. She was getting her body back as her legs appeared. It got to her hips where they grew into existence but felt bigger. Then her waist appeared and felt like she was sucking in her stomach but she was still and relaxed. Then it got to her chest and instead of her normal puppies, she had enormous g sized breast sticking out. Her nipples also were longer at 5inches and aimed upward as her posture was set. Finally her arms came into existence again sticking out to her sides and her head reappeared but she had no mouth.<br />
<br />
He looked around her seeing her eyes looking at him. She would have been scared and reacted but he altered reality so she only thought of herself as a coathanger. He looked at her and then grabbed her arms. She went bug eyed for a moment in surprise. She saw him grab her but could see he wasn&#39;t touching her arms. Yet it felt like he grabbed her arm. Then he was adjusting and she felt and elbow bend. She had another set of arms! Each time the original response is surprise before she remembers the new reality. She could hold multiple coats and other things with her 4 arms and 2 things such as caps with her giant breast. <br />
<br />
Now what to do with her friend..</p>
