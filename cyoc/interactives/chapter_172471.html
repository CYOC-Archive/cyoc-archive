<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Following his trail back was easy enough, in fact his new higher vantage point actually made some stand out even more.<br />
He breathed a sigh of relief as their camp came into view. Andrea was easy to spot, pinned to the ground behind two flesh colored boulders. He didn&#39;t see Vivian yet though.<br />
On his way there he decided that he&#39;d rather not accidentally get hit by a magic defense, so he waved at them. <br />
Andrea didn&#39;t wave back, but kept her eyes on him. <br />
<br />
Alec closed the distance while waving. &quot;Hey! It&#39;s me!&quot; <br />
&quot;Thought so.&quot; <br />
He didn&#39;t see Vivian. <br />
Alec walked into camp, looking down on Andrea pinned behind her own heavy breasts, he felt a new tug in the back of his mind. He couldn&#39;t place it, but the feeling was familiar. He had struggled with instincts before when he was in the Nekomata&#39;s body. <br />
The tug was not unlike the feeling of needing to check if you locked the door when you leave home. Something you just have to do.<br />
Yet, he couldn&#39;t quite place what this one wanted from him, it was still weak. But at least it didn&#39;t seem to urge him to kill Andrea, that feeling was wholly his own. Anyway, it was easy enough to ignore for now at least.<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; Vivian jumped from her hiding spot near the camp, holding a small knife. &quot;You&#39;wre a centauwr!&quot; She exclaimed happily.<br />
&quot;You took a centaurs body? Did he not want to help otherwise?&quot; <br />
&quot;No, he seemed to have very different ideas on what to do with helpless women. So I took his body to help us out.&quot;<br />
&quot;Damn Alec, you&#39;re ovewcompensating.&quot; Vivian&#39;s voice came from below him.<br />
&quot;Get away from there Vivian! I can&#39;t see you! I could step on you and I probably weigh a ton.&quot;<br />
&quot;Probably around 500KG&quot; Andrea added unhelpfully. &quot;Are you sure you can control that body Alec?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, why?&quot; <br />
&quot;Well, you mentioned that he had different ideas on what to do with helpless women and male centaurs are high up on list of creature with high libido.&quot;<br />
&quot;That does explain some things. Also, are you seriously saying there&#39;s a list of creatures with high libido? Who&#39;s at the top?&quot;<br />
&quot;I do not think that is&quot; &quot;Wrabites.&quot; Vivian interrupted.<br />
&quot;You mean rabbits?&quot;<br />
Andrea sighed. &quot;No, Rabites. They are like human rabbit hybrids.&quot;<br />
Bunny girls? Really? Alec&#39;s mind wandered to back in his home dimension. What would they look like here? He felt a familiar stir and quickly tried to think of other things again.<br />
&quot;But how about we talk xenobiology later and we figure out a way to load everything on your back instead?&quot;<br />
&quot;Right. Well his upper body is pretty strong. So I was thinking that if I lay down next to you we may be able to lift them up to my body. Maybe even with you on top of them and I can carry Vivian in my arms.&quot;<br />
&quot;That does not sound safe at all. I would propose trying to make some carrier bags to strap over you back instead.&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;wll need some rrope and bllankets!&quot;  <br />
She really needed to consider swapping from adventurer to fashion designer. &quot;And we really need to fasten my body on my back as well, I felt me nearly slip a few times. Damn, this is such a weird way of talking about myself.&quot;<br />
Vivian was decidedly more helpful in fashioning what could best be described as worlds largest bra saddle bag combination. At her directions even Alec was able to tie knots properly to the sides of the blankets.<br />
Together with Andrea they strapped the newly fashioned harness around his horseback.<br />
Now they just needed to slip the blankets below her breasts. He knelled next to a breast and slipped his muscular arms below the soft flesh. <br />
Her breasts were hard to lift. Besides the massive weight, the breast flesh moved and sloshed about like jello as he lifted the breasts up, allowing Vivian and Andrea to pull the fabric below them.<br />
Having done that, now came the next step. A step Alec was simultaneously looking forward to and dreading. He needed to park his horse part between her breasts so she could climb up and tie the straps to his harness.<br />
<br />
Alec parted the breasts gently first, before turning around and slowly pushing his horse body between the large soft flesh pillows. Their warmth and softness felt wonderful to his flanks and the thought of being stuck between two huge breasts was causing his nether regions to stir.<br />
&quot;Watch your tail please.&quot; <br />
&quot;Right! Sorry!&quot; Alec hadn&#39;t even noticed he had been flicking it, he tried to keep his tail from whipping Andrea in the face as he backed up further.<br />
Andrea climbed onto his back while Vivian handed the ropes to her.She pulled the ropes up and tied them to the harness.<br />
&quot;Okay, can you still get up?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; Andrea asked when nothing had happened for a few minutes. Vivian stood before them with a wide smirk.<br />
&quot;Give me a minute okay, you&#39;re quite heavy and this is a new body. I need to think and not think at the same time.&quot;<br />
To his own surprise, Alec managed to get up in a single go. He felt the large breasts sag to his sides and rest in their oversized bra. Carrying both his body and Andrea was quite heavy, but he could feel that he could stand it for quite some time.<br />
He took a few careful and uneasy steps. The breasts swung slowly with his movements, rubbing his sides. It felt far too good. He felt his massive horsecock slide out of it&#39;s sheath.<br />
Fortunately though, he felt that he could take it.  &quot;Right...Vivian, come over here and let&#39;s get going.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Vivian bounded towards him.<br />
Alec picked her up in his muscular arms. He found that tiny toddler Vivian&#39;s presence actually cooled him off somewhat.</p>
