<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This ended up way longer than I originally intended, but it felt too rushed and unnatural when I tried to keep it shorter or left out points I wanted to include for potential branch directions.  I also don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going to continue this branch or add other directions to the previous chapter first.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...Letting me borrow your dick for a little bit to see what it’s like?  It can only be for only like an hour or whatever you’re comfortable with and then we can transfer right back,” she said before biting her lip anxiously and waiting for you to speak.<br />
<br />
You’re stunned.  You’ve only just started talking to this girl a few minutes ago and she’s already talking about wanting your dick?  A bit more literally than normal, yes, but you’ve definitely <i>never</i> had things move this fast—especially with someone this attractive.  Is this a test?  Are you being pranked?<br />
<br />
You just stood there dumbfounded for several seconds as your brain tried to catch up.  Apparently, this gave off the wrong impression, as before you could formulate an answer, she broke the silence first.<br />
<br />
“Shit, I’m sorry, is that weird?  What am I saying, of course it’s weird!  We’ve only just met, I don’t even know your name, and you haven’t even done your first transfer yet.  I’ve just felt so forward after getting here and seeing everyone around me being so free and open, and I got caught up in the moment after it started off well and I-”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” you interrupted.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“I said sure.  It sounds like it could be fun, and what better way to break the ice with transfers than jumping in with both feet?  Also, I’m {Your Name},” you said, extending a hand.<br />
<br />
“Claire,” she replied, taking the hand and beaming.<br />
<br />
“There, now that we officially know each other, it’s perfectly normal to exchange genitals,” you said with a grin.<br />
<br />
“It’s practically first base these days,” she joked along, “though I guess it won’t quite be <i>exchanging</i> genitals.  We won’t be able to do that until I get my bits back from Ashley. I guess <i>lending</i>?”<br />
<br />
You shrugged and asked “So what now?  You know more about this than me.”<br />
<br />
Claire thought for a moment before suggesting reserving one of the personal rooms.<br />
<br />
“I mean, we could do the whole machine swap, but these are supposed to be more fun.  Besides, they’re free to use today, so we might as well take advantage of it.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good to me.  Lead on.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Before long, you and Claire were alone in what seemed like a strange mix between a small motel room and a doctor’s office.  The lights were mellow and there was a plain cushioned surface that seemed a mix between a couch and a bed, a few seats, and a couple of geometric lamps—all of which had a sleek, minimalist feel while still being inviting.  But the austere walls, overuse of chrome and stainless steel, as well as the general sterile feel to place gave it a somewhat medical feeling.  However, the one thing that stuck out over everything else in the room was the back wall covered in lit shelves of plastic tubes that held various transfer lotions.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I know it’s a bit overwhelming,” Claire said with a small laugh.  You must have been gaping at how many different ones there were to chose from.  “You should go check them out while I get the room reserved for us.  It should only take a minute, but this will make sure we don’t get interrupted.  Oh, but could I get your fingerprint here real quick first?”<br />
<br />
She pointed to a touchscreen on the wall next to the door where she was filling out info.  You obliged and saw your name and some of the info from the forms you filled out come up.<br />
<br />
“Thanks!” Claire said, “You can go look at the lotions while I finish this up.  Just don’t pick any of them up from their sensor stands.  We’re limited to how many free samples are included with the opening event and we don’t want them to start charging us.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks for the warning,” you said, before heading over to the shelves.<br />
<br />
You knew that the lady at the front counter had mentioned a lot of different things that they did here, but you were still surprised by how many different lotions there were.  The shelves on the bar were separated into rough categories—essence versus physical features and then erotic versus non-erotic, though it seemed that there were sub-categories and further groupings still within each.  Glancing at the essences, you saw some that you’d heard mentioned such as consciousness, or intelligence, as well as some others, like size, or even solidity.  There were others still whose labels just baffled you.<br />
<br />
You specifically went to the physical features section, turning a curious eye to the “erotic” lotions.  You bent down for a closer look.  On the whole, they seemed to have labels by what body parts they targeted, but the consistency of the liquid inside looked different than the non-erotic lotions.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, unfortunately we won’t be able to use those just yet,” Claire said, surprising you as she looked over your shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Oh!  Uh, what’s the difference?”<br />
<br />
“They’re basically just lube.  Typically, each of you picks what you’re trading and apply that kind of lube to yourself first, then whoever’s touching you while you orgasm gets that bit.  I’d be down for it, but I’m not sure I have the right equipment currently,” she explained.<br />
<br />
A thought occurred to you.  “What happens if multiple people are touching someone at the same time while using it?”<br />
<br />
“What indeed?” she said arching an eyebrow.  “Also, think about this: what happens if you can’t get your partner to orgasm?  Or if you orgasm too early and then <i>can’t keep going</i>.”<br />
<br />
“Oof.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.  Ashley told me that there’s some pretty creative games that they’ve used the erotic lotions for.  But for now, I think this one will work for us,” she said grabbing a bottle off one of the shelves and turning it over and double checked the instructions.<br />
<br />
“Uh… alright yeah, this one works.  Here, hold out your hand and I’ll squeeze some out.  Er, wait.  I guess we should probably take our shorts off first.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, right,” you agree.  Even though you’ve already shown yourself off to her, you still can’t help feeling a bit nervous undressing in front of this girl you’ve only just met.  However, you get the sense that she feels the same way as she looks away while dropping her boyshorts.<br />
<br />
Soon, the two of you are in the buff, and you’re thankful that the room is warm.  You can’t help but stare a little as you admire her body.  She’s full-figured in a flattering way, and with the clothes out of the way you can appreciate the freckles that trace up her thighs to her shapely hips.  As your gazes meet, you share an awkward laugh as you realize you were each gawking at each other.<br />
<br />
Claire’s the first to break the tension, moving up and giving you a peck on the lips and grinning.  You’re quick to return the gesture, wrapping your arms around her and pulling her back in for a proper kiss.  You both make out for a while until Claire pulls back, giggling.<br />
<br />
“What is it?” you ask,<br />
<br />
“You’re poking me,” she says with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
You look down and flush.  You were really enjoying the kissing.<br />
<br />
“Oh! I’m sorry!”<br />
<br />
“No, don’t be.  It’s flattering, really.  But it was also a not-so-subtle reminder that I only reserved the room for a half hour slot.  We might want to go ahead and start what we came here for, if you’re still down.”<br />
<br />
“Sure!  What do you need me to do?”<br />
<br />
“Great!  Here, hold out your hand,” she says, popping the cap off the lotion she selected earlier.  You do so and she squeezes out a hefty dollop into your palm and then squeezes some out for herself.<br />
<br />
“Now just apply the lotion to your genitals, but don’t rub it in too much yet.  Basically just make sure they’re decently covered,” she explains.<br />
<br />
“Balls too?” you ask, just to be sure as you start applying the cream to your penis.<br />
<br />
“I mean, I had assumed so, but if you don’t want to trade them, that’s fine too.  It would be kind of funny looking having the nose above them, but it might not be ideal.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, right, the nose…” you trail off.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong?  Is that not okay?” Claire says worriedly, “I thought, you know, since I was talking about how the trading works, and I had just assumed it would go in the normal spot that we were on the same page.  Is that a problem?”<br />
<br />
“No, sorry.  I guess I just wasn’t thinking,” you quickly explain.  “Of course it’s not a problem.  Besides, it’s just for an hour or so anyway, right?  Hell, I’ll probably have done weirder by the time I leave today.”<br />
<br />
Claire lets out a relieved sigh and grins.<br />
<br />
“Alright, good.  And trust me, it seems weird at first, but you get used to it surprisingly fast.”<br />
<br />
A few moments later, you’ve finished applying all of the lotion as evenly as you could and see that Claire has done likewise.<br />
<br />
“So what next?” you ask.<br />
<br />
“Okay, so if I’m reading the directions here right,” she says, picking the bottle back up, “we should just be able to touch the parts that we applied the lotion to together for ‘a few seconds or until it begins to warm,’ and then we just rub it in the rest of the way.”<br />
<br />
“That’s it?”  you say in surprise.  “That sounds a bit mundane, honestly.  How does the swap happen?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t really know.  When I swapped with Ashley, we used one of the machines, and it was really quick.  They say their products are supposed to be simple to use, and whatever technology they use to develop this stuff basically seems like magic to me.  I guess we’ll just follow the directions and find out.”<br />
<br />
“So, you want me to just, kind of put this here?” you say, moving closer and trying to line your crotches up.  It takes a touch of maneuvering and some awkward squatting on your part, and you’re both careful not to touch your lotion-covered hands together, but soon Claire’s lower nose is resting half-buried into your crotch.  You both look at each other for a moment before laughing again at how odd this whole process is.<br />
<br />
“Oh! That’s… Huh,” Claire trails off.<br />
<br />
“What’s up?” you ask.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, this is kind of weird, but you, uh… <i>smell...</i> really good?” she says, cheeks reddening.<br />
<br />
“Oh. <i>Oooh.</i>  Well I guess that’s flattering,” you laugh.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, sorry, I know it’s strange.  But it is nice.  I’m kind of sad I didn’t take advantage of the chance to try while we were kissing.”<br />
<br />
“Well, maybe I’ll get the chance to see for myself soon.  Speaking of, is the lotion feeling warmer to you?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Claire agrees,  “I guess that means it’s ready.”<br />
<br />
The two of you break apart and begin rubbing the lotion the rest of the way in.  The more you rub, the more warm and tingly your skin feels beneath the lotion.  It’s a little overstimulating, especially with where the lotion is applied, and you find yourself growing erect again.  But what’s especially weird feeling is that as you attempt to rub the lotion in, your goods feel somewhat pliable, even in spite of the returned stiffness.  With each pass of your grip, your hand sinks just a bit more into the flesh than you feel like it ought to, and unlike normal, the depressed skin and tissue doesn’t just spring back against he depression.  Slowly with each rub, your genitals deform under your grip, almost like clay being sculpted.  However, unlike clay, you aren’t really intentionally guiding the process.  Rather, the warm, tingly feeling from the lotion seems to concentrate in specific areas, where you try in turn to rub the lotion in, like scratching an itch.  It doesn’t feel like you’re actually making any progress rubbing the lotion itself into your skin, but you keep going as the sensations guide you. <br />
<br />
As strange as it feels, it’s even more unnerving to watch.  You’d more or less mentally prepared yourself for your dick being transferred to Claire, but the image you had originally was more of a <i>poof</i> and it’s done sort of situation, not watching your rod and tackle slowly deform into a shrinking, unrecognizable mass of flesh.  On the other hand, it does feel <i>really</i> good.  You find your breathing quickening.  But that’s nothing compared to Claire.<br />
<br />
You glance over at her after hearing a soft moan.  Her face is flushed, and she’s panting heavily with her eyes closed as she massages a steadily growing lump of flesh with both hands.  It’s already sectioned off into two distinct parts that she rubs independently, and the hand that’s holding the upper shaft-like piece is already working it in strokes that resemble masturbation more than simply rubbing in lotion.<br />
<br />
The sight of this turns you on more than you would have suspected, and you also intensify your rubbing.  However, though you feel like you should be nearing the brink of orgasm, it’s like there’s a wall that you can’t get past.  Sure, the rubbing on your crotch feels good, but that’s all, which just frustrates you enough to rub faster.<br />
<br />
Before long, you realize that the feeling of lotion on your skin is finally dissipating.  Though you still try to get yourself off, it doesn’t feel like it’s going anywhere.  You look down and realize that your hand is just moving up and down the bridge of a somewhat familiar-looking nose.  Logically, you knew to expect it, but it still kind of weirds you out and kills the mood you were in.<br />
<br />
Claire on the other hand was was now vigorously stroking her fully-formed cock.  With each thrust into her hand, she let out a whimper, and each vocalization slowly crescendoed until she was practically screaming.<br />
<br />
“Oh. My. God. This. Feels. So. Good.  I think I’m…. I’m gonna… Aaaah!” <br />
<br />
With a yell she thrust into her hand, sending ropes of white liquid spilling across the tiled floor.  She stood stiff on her tiptoes for a moment as she gave her dick a final couple passes before collapsing down to her knees in a fit of laughter.<br />
<br />
“Oh, man, I uh… I guess I got a bit carried away.  Sorry,” she said sheepishly between pants.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be, that was surprisingly hot,” you reassured her.<br />
<br />
You went to sit down next to her and you both took a moment to gather yourselves and catch your breath.  You took the chance to try breathing through your new nose as well and found that it seemed like it sped up the process of regaining your breath, which was nice, and you were relieved to find that you weren’t just smelling yourself.  Though you could smell the sweat on Claire’s skin through it even more so than normal, which only added to the vague sexual frustration you were still fighting down.<br />
<br />
“So, how was it for you?” Claire asked.<br />
<br />
“It was definitely interesting,” you said thoughtfully.  “I’m not sure there’s any way to really mentally ready yourself for exchanging body parts, but that was definitely different that what I was expecting.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.  I thought my first swap was intense, but that was a whole other level.  Did you also, you know…?”<br />
<br />
“Cum?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Claire said with a laugh.<br />
<br />
“Unfortunately not.  I felt like I was about to at one point, but I think I’d already changed enough that it was no longer possible.”<br />
<br />
“Oh shit, I’m sorry.  I’ll have to make that up to you later.  Also, sorry for going ahead and finishing by myself.  It was more than I was ready for and I couldn’t stop myself.  I wasn’t sure if you wanted to help or if that wouldn’t be quite be your thing.”<br />
<br />
“It’s fine, really.  I’m glad you enjoyed yourself.  As far as participating next time, I may be willing to try.  It’s my own junk after all, right?  And we’re definitely outside the realms of normalcy.  When in Rome, I guess.  How much time do we still have the room for?”<br />
<br />
Claire bites her lip and seems to think in consternation.<br />
<br />
“Okay, so that’s really hot and I definitely want to follow up on that line of thought.  However… I may also have had something else in mind first.  I only reserved the room for the half hour slot because I made a bet with my friend Sarah before we got here.”<br />
<br />
“A bet?  What kind of bet?” you asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, so we’re both typically really withdrawn and all of our friends expected us to be too shy to actually do any real swaps with strangers, much less something like this, so we jokingly made a bet that if either of us ended up with a dick, the other would agree to suck it.”<br />
<br />
“Wow…” you said with a whistle.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… Like I said, it was more a joke than anything; it was just a way to psyche ourselves up for the day.  I don’t intend to actually hold her to her word—not unless she wants to for some reason—but I at least want to gloat to her and the rest of the gals, and they wouldn’t believe me unless they saw it with their own eyes.  I just want the chance to prove them wrong and say, ‘Hey look: I can be kinky and bold and put myself out there, too!  So… suck it!’, you know?”<br />
<br />
“Literally.”<br />
<br />
“Hah!  Yeah I guess,” she says, laughing.<br />
<br />
“So then what do you want to do?  Should we go meet up with them now?”<br />
<br />
“Well… I know this is a huge ask, but would it be alright if I go meet back up with them by myself first?   I’m not sure if Sarah would honor the bet, but I’m kind of curious, and I know she’d be too shy to if you were there too.  We both have a bit of collateral, so I assume neither of us are just going to bail on the other one.  How about we meet back here in an hour?” she suggests.<br />
<br />
It’s not quite what you were expecting, and you’re a little hesitant to agree, but you’re really hitting it off with this girl and you don’t want to blow it by being too paranoid or controlling, so you say “Sure, that’s fine.  I’m sure I can keep myself entertained for an hour.  So what, meet back outside this room?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that sounds great!  Thanks so much for being cool about all of this.  I’ll have to find someway to repay you,” she says with a wink.  “I’ll be back as soon as I can, so I may be a bit early depending on how things go, but I’ll wait around until you show up.  Oh, also, you can have this.”<br />
<br />
She hands you the bottle of transfer lotion that the two of you used.<br />
<br />
“I think there’s still three or four doses of it left in there.  That stuff isn’t cheap, so it’s worth hanging on to.  Maybe we’ll use it up before we leave today.”<br />
<br />
With that, Claire gives you another kiss, and the two of you dress back into the simple garments you were given.  Claire works the control console to the room on the way out to sign out and queue it up for automated cleaning.  Once all that’s taken care of, the two of you stroll arm and arm back into the clinic’s open thoroughfare.<br />
<br />
“Alright, so see you back here within the hour?” Claire says.<br />
<br />
“Definitely.”<br />
<br />
She grins and says, “Alright, try not to have too much fun while I’m gone.  And take care of Ashley’s nose.  I can’t imaging what she’d do if I lost it somehow.  Thanks again for agreeing to all of this.  I’m so glad we ran into each other.”<br />
<br />
“Me too, and I will,” you say.<br />
<br />
The two of you idle looking at each other for a bit longer before Claire finally waves goodbye and heads off in the opposite direction.<br />
<br />
You sigh, sad to see her go so soon, but excited for what the day still has in store for the pair of you.  You have an hour to kill, so you suppose you might wander around a bit and see what all the clinic has to offer…</p>
