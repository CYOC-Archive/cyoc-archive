<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick&#39;s heart sank when Wes emerged from the dressing room with Clark on his arm. He&#39;d steeled himself for the sight of Clark&#39;s red eyes and puffy cheeks, but what he couldn&#39;t have prepared himself for was the look of utter despondence that darkened the two-year-old&#39;s adorable countenance. In an instant Nick knew that his friend had endured more than just a spanking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weth...&quot; Nick peeped. &quot;What did you do to him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The better question is, what did you do to that diaper of yours? You hiding a firehose in there, squirt?&quot; Nick&#39;s blush deepened to rival Clark&#39;s as a snickering Wes poked at the squishy front panel of toddler&#39;s sodden undies. &quot;Just kidding. I&#39;ve seen what you&#39;re packing and a firehose it is not. Widdle Nicky couldn&#39;t control that tiny dinky of his, huh? Bet you didn&#39;t even feel it coming - just sat there and pissed your Pampers like a <i>baby</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears sprung to Nick&#39;s eyes as he squirmed and whimpered beneath Wes&#39; teasing, stung by it in part because he was completely right. Nick had been so distracted by Clark&#39;s plight that he was only dimly aware of having wet himself - but Wes was determined to put him very much in mind of his inescapable incontinence, to drive home the horrifying and humiliating fact that he was physically incapable of preventing both this accident and those to come. <br />
<br />
&quot;Weth...weave him awone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick had been on the verge of bawling when Clark piped up in a small and shaky voice, his defense - timid as it might have been - a ray of sunshine to the little boy who feared he&#39;d made his best friend hate him forever. Wes rolled his eyes as he returned Clark&#39;s crinkly butt to his seat in the cart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say, slugger. Your little boyfriend can sit and soak while Daddy Wes finishes up his shopping.&quot; He smirked down at Clark, who met the man&#39;s gaze with big, bright, empty eyes. &quot;Do Daddy a favor and follow Nick&#39;s lead before we get to the bathroom, it&#39;ll be easier for me to change the two of you at once.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Wes returned to shopping as though his spree had never been interrupted. Both boys were silent as a final selection of infantile items were added to the cart, neither of them making so much as a crinkle until Nick saw Wes briefly turn away from them to reach for a sippy cup on a high shelf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clark?&quot; Nick whispered. &quot;Aw you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Clark stayed silent. Wes pressed forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sowwy, Clark. I&#39;m so sowwy.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was no response from Clark - not until he took Nick&#39;s tiny hand in his own and gave it a small squeeze. Nick may have sitting in a very wet and increasingly uncomfortable diaper, but the gesture nonetheless made his heart swell and made lips curl in the tiniest of smiles. Wes was thankfully so caught up in his shopping that he didn&#39;t take notice of the toddlers holding hands - right up until he parked the cart in front of the restrooms and looked down at his young captives.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t that sweet.&quot; Wes chuckled as he plucked his smartphone from his pocket and aimed it at the pair, taking a picture with neither boy able to do anything but pout in protest. Those pouts only became more pronounced when Wes gleefully showed them a snapshot of two fussy toddlers - one having recently bawled his eyes out, the other having clearly drenched his diaper - holding hands as they stared glumly at the camera, a stark reminder of how the former men now appeared to the world. &quot;Aww...think of all the cute pictures I can send you guys after this is all over. You know...just as a <i>little</i> reminder.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clark&#39;s eyes hardened at this while Nick, having not heard Wes&#39; earlier diatribe, merely deflated at the digital documentation and potentially endless reminders of their humiliation. Neither were given long to dwell, however, as in the next moment Wes scooped them out of the cart and into his arms, carrying them into the bathroom along with a small bag of supplies. Though the facilities were mercifully empty, the lock-free door meant anyone could walk in on their diaper change at any time...a prospect that turned especially mortifying to the boys when they realized the bathroom had no changing station, which meant...<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, shoot. I guess I&#39;ll have to do it on the floor.&quot; Wes shrugged, not sounding at all broken up about having to put the toddlers in such an exposed position. He balanced their crinkly and squishy bottoms on one arm as he unfurled a changing mat onto the tile and then sat both Nick and Clark upon it. If Wes seemed big before, he seemed positively gargantuan now as he loomed over the toddlers sitting huddled on the ground beneath him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the word, Clarky?&quot; Wes grinned. &quot;Can you be a good boy for Daddy and make a pee-pee in your Pampers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39; hafta go...&quot; Clark lamely retorted, unable to even meet Wes&#39; eyes. His voice was so small that it hardly seemed possible to belong to the same little boy that was a moment later squealing in laughter as Wes tickled his tummy and underarms and the soles of his bite-size feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop! Stop!&quot; Clark managed to get out between the endless stream of giggles. He tried to roll away but Wes&#39; fingers were everywhere - there was no escape. &quot;Pwease...I don&#39;...I don&#39; wanna...&quot;<br />
<br />
The tickled two-year-old&#39;s protests were cut short by a sudden gasp as Wes&#39; tickles brought about their intended effect. Wes pulled away and looked down in utter satisfaction as Clark, whimpering and sniffling, looked down at the growing wet patch in the front of his diaper. He trembled as the wet warmth spread across his groin and tickled its way up the seat of his absorbent undies - shuddered as his tiny tinker twitched a final few drops into his totally doused diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a good little baby boy!&quot; Wes teased as he knelt and poked Clark&#39;s plump tummy, drawing one last involuntarily laugh from the defeated toddler. He and Nick laid side by side as they were stripped of their wet diapers, the two of them so close that their pudgy arms touched as Wes purposefully slid fresh crinkly Pampers beneath their soft round tushies...as he wiped those tushies clean right alongside their chubby thighs and tiny boy parts...as he sprinkled those parts with a generous helping of dry sweet powder. Clark, having gone through this uniquely demeaning process before, swallowed the worst of his humiliation. Nick, meanwhile, was becoming inconsolable. He whimpered and bit his lower lip as he endured this unimaginable violation of his privacy, kept from tears only by the comfort of Clark&#39;s stubby fingers intertwined with his.  <br />
<br />
It was, of course, at that moment that the door to the bathroom swung open.<br />
<br />
Clark and Nick&#39;s humiliation found new depths to plumb when a young father and his preschool-aged son entered the facilities, the latter immediately taking notice of the two toddlers whining and squirming in shame at being caught in the middle of a diaper change. Wes, of course, took notice of this - and slowed his movements in response, gently and tenderly rubbing the powder into their most private and sensitive parts until the inevitable happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy! The babies have stiffies!&quot; The boy announced as he laughed his little head off, finding Clark and Nick&#39;s miniature erections the height of hilarity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t laugh, buddy, they can&#39;t help it.&quot; His father good-naturedly corrected him. Nick and Clark simultaneously shivered at the realization that, indeed, neither of them <i>could</i> help it - that there was something horribly, undeniably stimulating about Wes powdering their peepees with his thick, strong fingers. Both whimpered whenever his big warm hands passed over their privates, both all too aware that Wes was toying with them in full view of a giggling preschooler who was none the wiser.<br />
<br />
For Nick, it all became too much to bear. The tears that had been dammed behind his shimmering emerald eyes threatened to burst through, and the toddler began to wail - a wail that was immediately silenced when Wes popped a pacifier between his lips. Clark swallowed his indignant shout - partly because he knew he&#39;d be punished for showing up his &quot;Daddy&quot; like that, partly because he was stunned at how quickly Nick literally latched onto the comfort object that bobbed between his pursed lips. Though a few tears leaked out and trickled down his burning cheeks, Nick&#39;s oncoming tantrum was indeed abated - and the toddler, who continued to unthinkingly suckle upon its rubber nipple, had to come to terms with the fact that it was a pacifier that had, well, pacified him. Eventually Wes showed mercy and taped the toddlers into their diapers, bidding the father and son a pleasant day as they finished their business and exited the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well!&quot; Wes beamed as he bundled the boys back up in his arms, as Clark noticed, with considerable dismay, that Nick seemed to be in no hurry to spit out his pacifier. &quot;I don&#39;t know about you two, but I&#39;ve got way too much energy to go home. Where do my most favorite widdle guys in the world wanna go, huh? You wanna toddle around the park for a bit? Or maybe share the ball pit with all the other babies at the playplace? Anyplace, ahem, age appropriate you wanna go, kiddos.&quot;</p>
