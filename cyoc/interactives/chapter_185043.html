<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>In this specific line of events there are some discrepancies in some chapters that I first want to solve before going on with my own story. Since it is a lot to explain it doesn&#39;t all fit into the note box. So I will write it in the plot box but feel free to jump over it when it doesn&#39;t matter that much to you if everything makes sense in a logical way. (Natually it stays fiction but is less inconsistent ;) ) I also wrote a short and a long more explaining version, so feel free to pick.<br/>
<br/>
If this doesn&#39;t matter to you at all, you may want to jump past the &quot;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; line<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerly,<br/>
The_Real_Plot_Twist</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Long explanation short:<br />
(if you have time and are interested in why I made these adjustments and in being reminded to former events please read the longer version)<br />
<br />
There were inconsistencies in some chapters of this storyline, I want to clear them out (just the most important ones here):<br />
<br />
- Legs are not accurately changed back: Jennifer wouldn’t have got hers to switch them with Kyle -> we assume though that she has changed back with the bus driver and has her own legs when calling Kyle<br />
- while cursing Jennifer with ‘transform or dare’ Kyle said that he would be immune, later however he gets Jennifer legs anyway. The reason why that is possible gets added below, among others<br />
<br />
- Just one can have the curse at a time and gives it to someone else, so despite of former stories we assume: Kyle cursed Jennifer->Jennifer cursed Abby-> Abby cursed Elizabeth->Elizabeth calls Kyle, curses him and transforms him to have his legs changed as well when ones of the them lies to him and additionally change legs with those he lies to (just like them) -> Jennifer switches legs with Kyle by lying to him on the phone before hanging up -> Kyle curses Megan -> she says ‘dare’ -> he dares her to transform-or-dare him and dare him have the power to make his wishes come true by thinking of them -> so now Kyle has the wish power and the curse at his disposal<br />
<br />
Now you can read the story (or the long version ;) )<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Longer explanation, better insight: <br />
I really liked the pace of the story but for me there are some inconsistencies, so before starting with my story I want to mend fences:<br />
<br />
1. To be exact Jennifer never changed back legs with the bus driver, so Jennifer’s legs wouldn’t be around anymore. Also Jen’s mum would have had her dad’s legs and vice versa when Jen comes home.<br />
<br />
New truth: All that will in this story be changed to normal in regard that everyone will have her/his old legs back; despite of Jennifer and Kyle. So it isn’t that important to be correct who at the moment has who’s legs. We assume that at the moment Kyle has Jennifer’s legs and she has his ones; and that there is some chaos of changed legs around for now.<br />
<br />
2. Kyle while cursing Jennifer makes clear that she cannot affect him; this later is forgotten and he simply changes as well. I’ll fix that within the next point, too.<br />
<br />
3. It seems like some authors in this series of events assumed that everyone can at any time use the curse, like there is no: I gave it to you, now only you can transform-or-dare someone else. Otherwise Kyle in the chapter before couldn’t have cursed his sister since one of Jennifer’s friends would have the curse at the moment. The frist chapter states:<br />
<br />
“In any case, after the choice is made and the spell completed, it becomes the next person&#39;s turn. So, suddenly, the one who was cursed becomes the one who wields the magic, allowing the cycle to continue endlessly, with the power passing on from one person to the next, resting only occasionally when someone chooses not to take their turn.”<br />
<br />
As matter of honor to this person who laid the foundation to hundreds of amazing stories based on her/his start we will follow this rule. It also makes sense in regard that otherwise all the time everyone who knows of the curse would use it, hundreds of people at the same time. I think that would create a lot of chaos and would make it hard to keep up with the changes. So I will stick with:<br />
- one hot potato giving around; no multiplication possible. <br />
- When 1 minute after the question being asked passes you get both. <br />
- New (but often seen in other storylines): When the curser doesn’t make use of it for another minute (-> doesn’t says:” I dare/transform you to…”) after the person said nothing or answered dare/transform, the curse will go to the person that had been asked, no other consequences for her/him.<br />
<br />
So to turn everything into ‘ah, makes sense’:<br />
(new assumptions are pointed out with “new:…”)<br />
<br />
Kyle cursed Jennifer<br />
-> new: Jennifer cursed Abby (new, since in the story it seemed like she cursed Elizabeth and Abby at the same time; rule-break!)<br />
->  Abby cursed Elizabeth (all of them now have the change legs ability)<br />
-> new: Elizabeth called Kyle and said: “Transform or dare?”<br />
-> new: he picked ‘transform’ and also got the change legs ability, as well as now is possible to lose his legs to Jennifer/Elizabeth/Abby when they lie to him<br />
-> THEN, before hanging up, Jennifer lied to Kyle and got his legs, Kyle now has Jennifer’s<br />
-> Jennifer hangs up the phone<br />
-> Kyle lies and switches legs with his sister<br />
-> Kyle transform-or-dares his sister, she says ‘dare’(it was not stated in the chapter before, but was the story that followed after clicking on the ‘dare’-option) <br />
-> Kyle continues: &quot;...I dare you to Transform or Dare me and I will say dare. When I do, you will give me the power to grant my wishes with my thoughts.&quot; <br />
-> She does so, Kyle has now the power of wishes and the curse <br />
-> With his wishes he gives Megan (his sister) back her legs and gets Jennifer’s in return<br />
-> Kyle whishes Megan’s to have DD cups<br />
-> Kyle thinks of what to do next…<br />
 <br />
Every other event stays the same.<br />
<br />
Hope you kept up until now and wish you fun with the following story.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />

<br />
<br />
Megan cowed, observing her brother while his lips had changed into a smirk. He looked around the room slowly, making up ideas what to do with his unlimited powers.<br />
<br />
‘I have to do something about that’ Megan thought as she tried to remember the time when she and some of her friends made up ideas what to do with the curse if they would have it. And also (more importantly for now) what the weaknesses, intelligent turns and tricks could be to use it to its full potential.<br />
<br />
Then, not remembering from the past but making it up at the very moment, she had a brilliant idea. A plan so good that she found it hard to not begin smirking towards her power-mad brother. Contained but determined she then said: “Transform or dare?”<br />
<br />
“Transform or dare?” asked Kyle “How stupid are you numbnut? I dared you to use it on me to get my powers. So I have the curse again.” He shook his head laughing “I think one of the first things I should do is give you an ounce more intelligence. I mean this is ridiculous. Can’t believe your good marks in school; they shouldn’t be that good regarding your IQ of a noodle. Hmm, now that I think about it… maybe I should make you a bit dumber instead; that would be fun. My little dummy sister, always smiling like a cow, never understanding anything. But first things first…”<br />
<br />
Whilst his monologue Megan just listened halfheartedly. She was focusing on watching the clock at the wall every now and then but without being seen by her brother. Just at the moment as he was talking about her being dumb and making her dumber she felt insulted, but mostly afraid that he would do so and with that cross her plan, maybe forever. Fortunately he seemed to have other priorities.<br />
<br />
“… I know you can’t see but you still have something that belongs to me.” He points out to his sister.<br />
<br />
Within one blink Kyle had Jennifer’s legs back and gave Megan her own ones back. Megan noticed no difference, but her brother was smiling as if he just had made another wish. He looked down at himself as if he had firstly seen his own legs. For Megan they were the same as always: just very lightly tanned slinky legs today ending in white short socks. Sometimes Megan was a bit jealous of his legs, what didn’t meant that she was unhappy with her own but his really looked like the ones of a model. She wasn’t sure if he all the time since they stood there had worn some very short jeans hot pants; she thought he had worn a black skirt but she must have messed up that in her memory. Why was Kyle squeezing his hands around his clearly visible buttocks? He has this tight ass like ever since, so why is he so interested now?<br />
<br />
Megan again shook off these thoughts and took a look at the clock. She couldn’t prevent a little smile from running over her lips; fortunately unseen by Kyle. ‘One minute has passed… it seems to work.’ Megan thought secretly.<br />
<br />
“… Ah, I really love that ass and legs. Jennifer still probably has mine, wonder what she is doing with them and ‘it’.” He silenced shortly and got a bit concerned, but in a thoughtful way. “Well I guess she until now had messed up a lot of leg ownerships. Hmm, what if at anytime I go to a bar, meet a nice girl and when we want to leave I see that she has some hairy, fat, men’s legs? Irrgghhh. I got the picture of it right in my head. Think I will have to change some things about that. So for now everyone shall have their own legs back despite me and Jennifer, however only Jennifer still can change legs. But I think another way would be better. I think it’s not that much of a punishment as I thought to Jennifer.- HAH, now I’ve got it. This will be fun.”<br />
<br />
Megan wasn’t sure if that was a good idea but she felt like saying something to Kyle’s villain like monologue, so she risked it.<br />
“Kyle what’s about this Jennifer? I guess you don’t mean that girl from my tennis club but this senior girl from school, don’t you? Why do you hate her so much?”<br />
<br />
Megan had a picture of Jennifer in her mind. To her she was exceptionally beautiful, and popular. The thought that Kyle had anything to do with her struck her a lot.<br />
<br />
“Let’s just say that we have a little past. I asked her something way back and she was cruel. I returned some favors for that and when she found out it was me she humiliated me. Yesterday then I thought I punished her but turns out I have to step up a little bit to make it an appropriate punishment. But you don’t have to think about it. <em>Now</em> everything is dealt with.” Kyle said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Before he explained his history with Jennifer to Megan he in his thoughts changed Jennifer’s legs </i>‘ability’. For now she can’t switch anymore but has to stick with Kyle’s lower body. Further changed is that she will have an indescribable urge to jerk his cook several times spread over the day. But she won’t feel any pleasure. She will feel as if in these moments she is giving him a handjob and just feels her hands doing it, sensing nothing at the member itself. Just able to look at how she gives the member of her hated boy from school a generous handjob, unable to do something against it. Maybe when he gets bored of it he will let her switch legs again but change her ability in a way that she just copies other’s legs and overwrites her own. However it will only be possible with ugly legs, from fat men for example. Then she will have to stick with them for some hours before she gets back her own ones; but most certainly only for a brief moment until she lies or looks at some men’s or fat woman’s legs again.<br />
<br />
Deep buried in his delicious thoughts he suddenly was interrupted by his sister; her grinning at him with satisfaction and full of excitement. <br />
<br />
“…. Aaaaannnnnnddddd Two. – That’s it boy. Two minutes are over, now you are mine.” She laughed, but before he could express his confusion she complacently called: “Transform or dare, Kyle?”<br />
<br />
“What? I already said to you, <em>I am</em> in charge of the curse, I’d have to curse you first. Yet to say that I am not sure if I will make use of it anymore, since I got my new wonderful wishing powers.”<br />
<br />
“Hah, just go on thinking like that. I always knew you are such a moron. You don’t understand anything.” Megan teased.<br />
Still confused Kyle observed her false confidence. Whatever she made up in her little dumb brain, her ‘I-am-superior-to-you’ smile really pissed Kyle off. So he thought of something to do against it.<br />
<br />
… but nothing happened. So he tried speaking it out loud.<br />
<br />
“I wish that my sister would become a gum chewing bimbo, only playing with her hair and giggling; not able to speak or think until I say different.“<br />
<br />
Nothing happened, just Megan’s gaze was now really pissed off.<br />
<br />
“Oh how nice of you, sweet brother. You’re always such an asshole; fucking dork. But you still don’t get it, huh? Your powers don’t work for now; since everyone that is familiar with the curse knows that while you are transform-or-dared by someone there is nothing that can change this situation. You can’t walk away, plug your years or hang up the phone, and apparently can’t even use some gained magic powers to flee from the curse. Until everything is settled the cursed one has to stay and take it,” she made a little break, shortly gazing at the clock then back at him “- Aaaannnndddd that’s it for you.” His sister now laughed loudly and full of gratification.<br />
<br />
“You are simply too slow, my stupid brother. You wasted another minute and didn’t answer with ‘dare’ or ‘transform’. So now, you get both. And I am very pleased with that.”<br />
<br />
Kyle’s confident smile had flushed into a scared child’s expression, like being confronted by a scary huge clown with evil eyes, a pale, distorted visage and who is licking his sharp fangs-like teeth, coming nearer and nearer.<br />
Now Megan took her turn “Let’s start with this. I dare you to…”</p>
