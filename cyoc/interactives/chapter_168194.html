<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hell with it. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity - might as well go all out with things. Taking a deep breath, she stood up, marching over to sift through the Size section of the crate. She went straight for the end, to a vial marked &#39;OVERSIZED&#39; in all caps. It seemed to be the largest here, and if she was going to experience.. having a member, then she might as well have a big one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oughta have my head examined one of these days,&quot; she muttered before popping the cork off and throwing the tasteless fluid back, letting it rush down her throat like the blandest tap water she&#39;d ever had. Hm. She&#39;d been hoping for a more exotic taste, but... oh well. As soon as it was emptied, she put the cork back in and returned the vial to its container. <br />
<br />
A burning sensation was already spreading over her body - something about her was certainly changing, she felt certain of that. In a hurry she moved to drop her jeans, followed by her panties, then her shirt and bra for good measure - the bottoms for sure had to go, if this stuff did what she expected, and the top might as well avoid damage. With breath held she leaned against the kitchen counter, staring down to between her legs...<br />
<br />
And staring...<br />
<br />
And staring...<br />
<br />
And finally the burning sensation stopped, and it seemed as if nothing had happened. No magical shaft appearing in place of her womanhood, no sudden masculine features, no throbbing member dangling between her legs. Just an overall feeling of disappointment as she sighed and headed back to the couch. It shouldn&#39;t have surprised her that these things were a load of crap, but... she had been kinda hoping.<br />
<br />
Mindlessly turning the TV back on, she remained nude, lacking the energy at the moment to go and get dressed once more. All she could muster herself to doing was to start at the screen flashing in front of her, one hand idly rubbing her stomach up and down. She didn&#39;t give the mindless movement a hint of thought until she started to feel... odd. Not a bad sort of odd, but where she was rubbing... it felt kind of nice.<br />
<br />
Her brow furrowed, but she didn&#39;t stop, instead increasing the area over which her hand ran. A bizzarre tingle was running up her spine, but it was one that felt... wonderful... and pleasurable. Confusion crossed her face as she felt compelled to sit up straighter, the speed and length of her rubbing now increasing out of some alien instinct. At this point, it wasn&#39;t even rubbing anymore, but... stroking, really, over an increasingly large part of her body.<br />
<br />
The compulsion to sit up became a desperate need to stand up, straight as she&#39;d ever been, as the pleasurable feeling turned into outright arousal. She moaned in equal parts bafflement and excitement as a churning sensation touched her chest. It felt... fuller? Looking down was difficult, with how stiff her neck was becoming, but she managed to get her gaze low enough to see that her breasts were swelling. She could feel them growing out, their mass filling with some liquid.<br />
<br />
Moans of increasing ecstacy filled the air, her body now as stiff as a board. She couldn&#39;t even focus on balancing, falling backwards onto the couch in a rigid position. The only parts of her that still moved freely were her hands and arms, one having slipped inside her folds as the other squeezed at her impossibly firm breasts. Every part of her was was stiff as a board, even her throat having locked up too much for her to continue moaning.<br />
<br />
Finally, it seemed she could take no more. Suddenly she felt her whole body began to pulse, convulsing in the direction of her head. The swelling of her breasts began to rapidly reverse as she felt something build up in her throat, amassing in great quantities before she spewed it right out of her mouth. A flood of white, sticky fluid filled the air, its salty scent being instantly recognizable to her nostils as she unleashed it all over the floor.<br />
<br />
There were several waves of the stuff, bursts in between which it seemed to slow to a dribble before erupting again. The third was what finally seemed to be the last, and finally, her body began to relax, muscles suddenly softening as she struggled to catch her breath. For a few moments Mary lingered on her back, before rolling to her side and spitting repeatedly, trying to get the last of the fluid out of her mouth. Even in the daze that had followed her orgasmic release, she recognized the stuff now piled up on her floor in considerable volume.<br />
<br />
&quot;...I&#39;m a....&quot; She didn&#39;t want to say it. Groggily Mary turned towards the glass window, her reflection still showing a human face. She didn&#39;t look different at all. But the goop before her was evidence that something seriously strange had happened to her... and it wasn&#39;t hard to put two and two together. The vials were supposed to change her into what they were labeled with, and... well, they had. Her body, despite remaining human in apperance, had gained the qualities of the thing that had been on the label, her breasts even serving as the two critical accessories that thing needed to fulfill its function. As for size... well, a human-sized dick was a pretty big one.<br />
<br />
One hand came up to rub her head as she pondered the situation. Changing herself back, post-haste, seemed like the smart option - Mary wasn&#39;t entirely sure about being a walking, talking piece of male genatalia, nor did she want to be cleaning up this mess on a regular basis. Still... maybe she didn&#39;t have to rush. It had been freaky, but it had felt amazing... and it might feel even better if she had someone to share the experience with.</p>
