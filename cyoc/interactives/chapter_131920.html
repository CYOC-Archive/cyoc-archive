<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Driving back towards their apartment, Jade Cling was very worried about her wife. After all, today had been when her interview with <br />
that clod of a movie star, Jack Burton, was supposed to happen. She&#39;d started worrying right after Jess told about the &#39;conditions&#39; for the interview. It was dangerous, especially if the rumors about the man&#39;s true thoughts on their lifestyle were true.<br />
<br />
Still last night, Jess had assured everything would be fine, and Jade let herself trust in that assurance. She&#39;d gone off to work in the morning but found it odd that she didn&#39;t get the usual lunch time check-in call from her wife. The petite Asian woman fretted a bit, but put off calling the reporter until later. However, the person who answered the phone when she did finally call was the real shock. <br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
Jack had been in the shower freshening up when the cell phone rang. It took Jessica Bling a moment for the ring tone to register as being hers, and she had pick the smartphone from one of the piles of clothes that littered the bedroom now. With a slight yawn and a stretch, the model turned actress tapped the screen and answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Jessica. Who is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
There came a slight noise of frustration from the person on the other end of the call before they replied again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not funny, Jess. I was worried about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t even know who you are, so why should I care about your worries?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B..but I&#39;m your wife!&quot;<br />
<br />
Those words seemed to trigger something in Jessica, as a sudden surge of homophobia surged forth from the depths of her mind and towards this Jade woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gawd, you&#39;re another one of those lesbian stalkers! I don&#39;t know how a queer bitch like you got my number, but I suggest you lose if you know what&#39;s good for you! &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W..what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You heard me. I ain&#39;t interested in your kind. I like cocks, not cunts. Good-bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
She tapped the call closed with a manicure nail, and switched over her social media apps. That she was nearing a thirty-five million followers on Instagram made her wonder if a quick pic from Jack Burton&#39;s bedroom might help cross that line...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
Jade had stood there speechless and in a bit of daze. Certainly, she&#39;d dialed the right number, but the woman on the other end had not been Jess. Or at least, she&#39;d only sounded a little like her wife.  Her finger wavered over the call button, unsure if she dared to call back.  Instead, she decided to get into her car and drive home. She would have to call her boss to explain why she&#39;d left, but for now Jade needed to get out of here. <br />
<br />
Her battered but beloved Honda Accord pulled up to a stop at a traffic light. Jade looked over to see a giant billboard for the latest Jack Burton film being raised up onto the front of an office buildings. She&#39;d have just ignored it, but the image of his scantily clad co-star, Jessica Bling, caught her eye for some reason. A small rush of lust washed over her as she stared at the busty brunette woman, triggering the &#39;were-breeder&#39; curse she&#39;d been given by her former wife.<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
At that same moment, a new account under name of &#39;Jae Bang&#39; logged onto Instagram, and soon images began uploading. It didn&#39;t take long for the page to start gaining followers...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
 Still waiting for the light to turn green, Jade drummed her fingers on her steering wheel, failing to notice that they grown out considerably, with a dark green shade of nail polish tipped with gold. Also unseen was the shifting of her work shoes from comfortable brown leather flats into a pair of black and gold pumps with four inch heels that gripped a smaller pair of feet.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like an eternity, there was suddenly a green light and the Honda lurched forward. As it drove along, its driver continued to transform. Her jeans steadily grew thinner and clung more tightly to her legs. The seams disappeared, along with the pockets as the denim gave way to shiny black lycra that tightened to emphasize the length of her increasingly more toned legs. A trio of dark green lines suddenly started to run down the sides, while her once thin thighs thickened considerably. Jade had to adjusted her position in the driver&#39;s seat as her flat ass bloated up with fatty tissue, giving her perfectly formed peach for a bottom. Over the top of the newly formed jogging pants, the top of a black thong peeked out.<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
There was an influx of pictures that showed off the well-rounded ass of &#39;Jae Bang&#39; in a variety of sexy poses and outfits. Her followers online continued to tick upwards, breaking past the thousand mark and closing in on 10k...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
There was a sudden contraction of muscles as her waist narrowed, while her stomach flattened and toned itself. Jade pressed down on the gas in response to this, the car picking up speed. Her plain white blouse started to unbutton itself, revealing the ordinary bra that held her modest bust. The undergarment began to gain layers, with the innermost one remaining a bra, albeit for a large chest then it currently held. The outer layer pulled itself down over the toned stomach, stoppping to show a perfect mid-riff. Blackness spread over the new belly tee, as bright green letters pressed out it to spell out the words &#39;Big Bang&#39;. This writing was made even more prominent as her breasts swelled forward into a pair of fine d-cups<br />
<br />
Increasingly, Jade&#39;s open blouse thickened as it started to become a smart dark green leather jacket that creaked as she turned sharply down at a corner. This move at first confused her, as she now seemed to be driving away from her apartment. But a new memory popped into her head, reminding her that she actually was back on the right path. And it wasn&#39;t the only new thought in her mind, as she started to recall being on the way back from a photo shoot?<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
The shots from Jae&#39;s beach shoot were proving to be wildly popular, as her fans and followers couldn&#39;t get enough of her tremendous rack barely hidden under the smallest of bikini tops. Ten thousand was a distant memory, as was one hundred thousand as her account closed in on a million follows...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
As she sped along, numerous small changes to Jade became more obvious. Her skin smoothed out as it gained an almost golden lustre to it, which spread from her head downwards. The growth of the muscles in her arms tightened the sleeves her jacket, while a lick of her lips revealed they had plumped up under a lovely dark crimson lipstick. Dark black lashes rolled out over a pair of sparking jade green eyes set in almond-shaped sockets while her once too wide nose had narrowed. <br />
<br />
There came another turn of the car&#39;s wheel, which was no longer a battered Honda. Instead, she was driving a dark green BMW M6 Convertible, whose top she now lowered. As the wind blew through it, her short bobbed black hair grew out longer, fluttering in the <br />
wind as it gained volume and mass. It now reached to the small of her back, with perfectly even bangs that framed a beautiful face that Jade wouldn&#39;t have recognized only a short while ago. <br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
The million follower mark was blown past, with a smilling Jae holding up a thank you sign that concealed her obviously nude body. It was also about this time that she started to follow Jessica Bling on Instragram, who soon enough followed her back...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
Another tide of new memories swamped Jade&#39;s increasing muddied mind. Her attraction to women was fading fast, and a shallow lust for men was taking its place. A haughty and seductive voice reminded her that she had what they wanted. She tried to hold onto her feelings for her wife, but she was shocked as her mental image of Jess Cling morphed into Jessica Bling. The old Jade Cling might have lusted for the model-actress, but the newly formed model Jae Bang only saw her bestie and BFF! <br />
<br />
As Jae processed this new revelation, a pair of dark sunglasses slid over her eyes. A pair of earrings made of dangling jade and silver dropped down from her ears. They were a  match to the thick bracelets that wrapped themselves around her wrists. Her wedding band, the last remnant of her married life, began to twist itself into a new shape that flowed around her neck to become a braided silver necklace, which had been a birthday present from Jessica.<br />
<br />
Pulling into the garage of her apartment complex, the Instagram model pulled out her smartphone to check her latest follower count.  Her crimson lips parted in a smile at the sight of the eight digits she saw. Her thumb flicked over and clicked on the call button, as she just had to share the news...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Her phone rang again, but this time, Jessica checked to see who it was calling. She smiled widely as the face of her bestie, Jae Bang, was on the screen. Tapping the call button, she listened as the busty Asian model gushed about hitting thirty million followers on the &#39;Gram, her eyes looking at the sparkling diamond on her right ring finger.</p>
