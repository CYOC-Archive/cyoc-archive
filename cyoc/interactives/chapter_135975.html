<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Exactly 18 months old. Is that correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is&quot; Thomas replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like someone really wants to wear diapers again&quot; Dr. Issacs playfully teased causing the younger man to blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, you got me&quot; Thomas awkwardly chuckled.<br />
<br />
The truth of the matter was that Thomas was secretly an adult baby diaper lover, and had been since high school. While he somewhat indulged in the lifestyle he couldn&#39;t fully enjoy himself. And the reason for this was that he wished he was an actual baby rather than an adult, fantasizing about regressing back to toddler age and losing his potty training, playing with toys, drinking from a bottle…pooping his pants without a care in the world.<br />
<br />
That was the life for him.<br />
<br />
Then when he found out he won the lottery Thomas saw the cash as a ticket to making his lifelong dream come true, having already known about ReGenesis. After setting some affairs of his in order he made an appointment a week ago and here he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry I&#39;m not gonna pry about the reasons why you want to go back to babyhood, though I do have a pretty good idea. Gotta say it’s been quite a while since we&#39;ve had a client who wanted to regress to such a young age. I myself have considered taking off a decade or two but I doubt I&#39;d have the guts to go back to needing diapers again&quot; Dr. Issacs chuckled while Thomas tried hard not to blush.<br />
<br />
That was one of the main reasons he was going through with this, so he could wear and use the padding in public without shame. He also chose the age of one and a half so that he could stay young enough for them as long as possible while at the same time be able to walk and talk.<br />
<br />
Thomas just finished his thought when the doctor stopped beside a door that was marked &quot;Transfer Room 7&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here we are. This is where the magic happens so to speak&quot; Dr. Issacs chuckled at his own joke. &quot;But before we go in I first need your signature on this consent form&quot; he said handing the clipboard and a pen to his client.  Thomas quickly skimmed it over just to be on the safe side to ensure there was no foul play. Satisfied that everything was legit he signed his name right on the dotted line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good. Now when you go inside you&#39;ll see two tables, one of which is empty and has a gown for you to wear and put on. Th-&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas raised a hand to interrupt the doctor, &quot;Can I go naked instead. I really want to see my body grow younger before my eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine, anyway as I was saying the other table will be occupied by the person who will be taking your years so that you may regress. Do not attempt to speak to him as he is a very private person and doesn&#39;t want any contact with you&quot; Dr. Issacs explained to which Thomas nodded, thinking &quot;to each his own&quot; as the other continued, &quot;Once you remove your clothes and hop on the table then we can begin the transfer. The whole thing is quite simple and painless.&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded and then grabbing the door handle turned it and entered the room that would forever change his life. Stepping inside he saw that the inside appeared very similar to a hospital&#39;s operating room in terms of appearance. There were two metallic tables set up in the middle with one empty and the other taken by an older looking man wearing just a hospital style gown. Surrounding the set up was an assortment of large electronic medical looking devices. Thomas only took in everything for a few minutes before the excitement of what he was about to do hit him.<br />
<br />
Walking over to the empty table he quickly began to take off all his clothes until he was completely naked. His body was somewhat muscular with hair on his chest and a thick bush of it around his privates. Tossing the gown that was left for him onto the floor Thomas climbed onto it and laid down, folding his arms over his stomach and intertwining his fingers.<br />
<br />
After a minute he got bored and decided to glance over at the person who would ‘literally’ be taking his years. From what he could tell the man was Latino with short black hair that was visibly starting to grey. He had a lanky build with hairy chest and privates and if he was to guess his age was about 43 years old, give or take. He also appeared to be sitting very still and was currently staring up at the ceiling.<br />
<br />
It took Thomas a few seconds to realize that if this guy took his years from him then he would end up a whooping 70 years old. Shrugging off the shock he figured that they must have paid him extremely well and resumed staring at the door and patiently waiting for Dr. Issacs.<br />
<br />
What Thomas didn’t know was that the man lying a few feet from him with was actually a former drug cartel member named Luis Martinez. He committed many heinous crimes including murder which landed him on the death row list when he was sent to prison. However instead of being executed the warden had the man secretly transferred to ReGenesis in exchange for a hefty sum of money. The committee had recently got the brilliant idea to buy and use death row inmates as expendable participants in their youth treatments. They figured that just killing these people was a waste and that if they were going to die anyway they might as well take all the years they had left. And so for the past few months Regenesis had been regressing clients and transferring their years to inmates with no futures, doing so until the subject eventually died of old age, at which point they would cremate the body and delete their file to get rid of all evidence. <br />
<br />
This procedure would actually be Luis’s second in the past week, the man having just turned 30 when he received his death sentence and had already taken on 13 years from a woman who wanted to be 21 again. As for why he wasn’t struggling or trying to escape Luis was injected with a paralytic drug that would render him motionless for an hour while the transfer took place.<br />
<br />
Thirty seconds passed when a female nurse opened the door and entered the room, carrying two syringes in her hand.<br />
<br />
“Hello Mr. Walker, we’re almost ready. I just need to take some blood samples for a scan then we can begin” she said walking over to draw some blood from his arm, “Don’t worry we’ll have you sucking your thumb in no time baby boy” the nurse smiled as she finished.<br />
<br />
“Sounds good” Thomas replied.<br />
<br />
He watched her go over to the other man and do the same for him, pocketing the vials afterward. On her way to the door she paused to collect his clothes from the floor along with the gown, holding them in a bundle with her left arm. <br />
<br />
The nurse opened the door and was about to leave when she turned to face him, “The procedure will start in a couple of minutes, stay where you are and do not for any reason leave the table until the transfer is complete” she warned.<br />
<br />
“Wait, where is Dr. Issacs and Sarah?” he asked quickly.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry they will be watching from the room next door through a one-way window and will come see you the moment the regression is over.”<br />
<br />
A sense of relief flooded him hearing that and he nodded his head as the woman left closing the door behind her.<br />
<br />
Thomas ended up waiting another three minutes before something started to happen.</p>
