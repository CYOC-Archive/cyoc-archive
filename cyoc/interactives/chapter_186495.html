<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark would&#39;ve kept gawking at his former older sister, if it wasn&#39;t for his mom yelling for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark! Your dog just went in the garden, go pick it up before I end up stepping in it again.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he walked downstairs Mark kept seeing all the changes around him. The photos of the family now had his parents, his younger sister Heidi and himself. Some of the more recent ones however had him hugging Jennifer as she sat on the ground on all fours with her tongue sticking out, just like his dog Rainbow used to do. What caught Marks eye more were the clothes she was wearing, were all rather short and skimpy and didn&#39;t always do a great job of covering her. Mark was relieved she still wore some clothes at the very least though it seemed more like accessories than anything practical.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are Mark&quot; came his mothers voice from behind him &quot;Stop staring off into space and go pick up Jen&#39;s mess. If she gets poorly from eating her poo again I won&#39;t be the one cleaning it up this time. I&#39;m going to check on how Heidi now that dinner is almost ready.&quot; Mark was about to finally go outside before he heard his mother from upstairs, yell &quot;Don&#39;t forget to put out Jen&#39;s food either in her bowl!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark barely had a moment to process what he heard, before stepping into the garden and being knocked down. As he gathered himself and looked back up, Mark saw his former sister Jennifer looking back at him happily. Mark was about to move her off him, but before he could, she began to lick him all over his face. It was a strange sensation as he felt her still short tongue getting her drool on him as she kept moving up and down he couldn&#39;t help but notice her chest rubbing against his. Her warm breath against his ear and her nipples piercing through her thin shirt onto him almost completely distracted Mark, if it wasn&#39;t for the pungent smell coming from nearby. <br />
<br />
Finally Mark got up, moving Jen off as she just continued to stare at him, clearly enjoying the attention. Mark pulled out the slightly larger doggy-bad they had, bent down and picked up his &#39;new&#39; pets still warm mess, before putting it away in the bin.<br />
<br />
Collapsing into the sofa, at last he had a moment to really think, thought Mark. A time travelling woman had just given him a device to alter reality and only he was aware, and now he had just merged his distant sister with his affectionate dog and no one noticed anything wrong.<br />
<br />
A grin appeared across Marks face as all the increasingly perverted possibilities of the remote were starting to race through his head. Though after all why shouldn&#39;t he experiment and try different things? The time travelling woman had told him the whole of the world was at stake if he didn&#39;t do something to change earths course. Regardless, Mark was going to enjoy himself.<br />
<br />
Before he could push his next button, Mark heard some whining at his feet and looked down to see Jen restlessly moving from side to side.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it girl?&quot; Mark asked the dog while scratching her head, to which she leant into. &quot;Do you need to go outside again already?&quot;<br />
<br />
Opening the back door again Mark saw he was right as once more Jen squatted down on all fours, pulled down her panties, yet this time carefully lifted her leg.  Jen&#39;s scrunched up face began to relax as she released the pressure and began pissing, her body slightly shaking as a yellow stream arc&#39;d out of her. Eventually the flow eased off as just a few little drips remained, which were quickly removed as Jen vigorously shook her ass. Mark saw everything and even the now damp patch as Jen pulled up her panties, before proudly sniffing around her mess and looking at you. <br />
<br />
Mark left Jen playing outside chasing her butt in circles, to go see how crazy he could make things with the remote with his Mom and little sister. He found them inside, his mother was helping Heidi with some middle school homework. Mark decided to start small and work up as he pulled out the remote.<br />
<br />
He pointed the remote at his little sister and pressed the Age Transformation option and looked back to see his mother now helping his sister with her pre-school work. The now 4 year old Heidi wore a pink My Little Pony shirt, covered by overalls and a frilly skirt. Mark could swear he see something sticking out from her sides and remembered his little sister hadn&#39;t been potty trained till she was 6.<br />
<br />
The timer in the kitchen went off and his mother left Heidi to go turn it off and serve dinner. &quot;Mark could you check Heidi for me please? I think she might need another change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wondering if he could choose what traits were swapped if he focussed, Mark pointed the remote at his next target and pressed.</p>
