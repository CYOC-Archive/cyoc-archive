<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Author&#39;s note: I&#39;m not object to people adding on. I&#39;m trying to stay away from incest but I cannot help what happened in the chapter I started with (ie the tail n stuff) if you do go that route, or perceive their interactions as flirting, my only request is you make Jess not really John&#39;s cousin or smth. Feel free to branch off! I love seeing what others come up with) <br />
<br />
Jess marked another dropped inch on the mirrored column. You bit your lip with your cat fangs worried. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you see any other changes?&quot; You asked <br />
<br />
&quot;Your eyelashes might be longer. I think some make up is coming in.&quot; Your cousin answered.<br />
<br />
You turned around to look at your face, it looked like you were wearing falsies, someone had applied a bit of rouge and your lips seemed redder. <br />
&quot;Oh I see it...&quot; you mumbled, your own blush making your face redder. You groaned &quot;I never should have agreed to this dumb stay. I&#39;m old enough to stay home alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;d you even come here?&quot; Jess asked, fixing her own hair in the mirror, then going to adjust the bows around your cat ears. <br />
<br />
&quot;It sounded kind of fun. And the house was getting fumigated. Ugh I look like a little girl.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I mean not entirely. More like a lolita at a convention or something. You&#39;re still a little taller than me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but how long is that gonna last?&quot; You rolled your eyes. Thinking. Maybe you could find a solution. Especially to your problem below the belt. Your balls hadn&#39;t shrunk but you weren&#39;t even sure what was left of your dick. &quot;I&#39;m gonna explore...&quot;<br />
<br />
You were really looking for something to fix your problems, Jess may have known that but there was a suspension of disbelief that you were just interested in all the product, or were familiarizing yourself with what was sold here. <br />
As you looked around at the accessories, wondering if a fake mustache or something would help you at this point. <br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably just become a hairy femboy. <br />
<br />
Then you thought... if the problem was in your pants... your eyes slid to the beaded section of the store. <br />
The light was on in there even though you couldn&#39;t remember anyone turning it on. Maybe it was always on. You approached shyly, there was a sign like in the porn section of a video shop. <br />
<br />
&#39;Warning: clothes and accessories beyond this point aren&#39;t for anyone younger then 21. If you do not wish to continue, please turn back immediately.&#39;<br />
<br />
Yeah well, you were kind of in the market for a bigger penis so.  You brushed the beads aside and prepped your brain not to be a prude about things. <br />
<br />
Inside was a small room with display cases and mannequins. The mannequins wore primarily lingerie, but there did seem to be some leather and latex type stuff. Not your thing exactly. Gimp suit, what looked like the full skin of a fake looking bimbo, barely contained in a bikini. You could see the nipples poking through, so you assumed it wasn&#39;t like Karbie and Ben. No male version though. <br />
Something about seeing the big honkers was making your micropeen excited though. <br />
<br />
Collars and leashes adorned the walls. Whips and torture devices? In the displays there were uh... toys. Was the best way to put it. Fleshlights, onaholes, dildos, strap ons. You wondered if a strap on would work for your problem...<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I was only allowed in here last year or so.&quot; You heard your cousin&#39;s voice behind you as she moved the beads aside announcing her entrance. &quot;Nothing like some family bonding in the sex part of the store, &#39;ey cuz?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t you stick a buttplug in me?&quot; You retorted flatly, tail flicking in annoyance. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just the way the tail went in, excuse me! I&#39;m still family, I&#39;m not THAT kind of cousin. Besides. It was funny.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have you know I can&#39;t even feel it anymore&quot; you lied. <br />
<br />
&quot;So are you just familiarizing yourself with the merchandise or do you want to try something&quot; she giggled. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s a weird thing to ask family to be honest.&quot; You picked up some unlabeled spray bottles with murky looking liquid inside, well unlabelled wasn&#39;t quite true. They had odd symbols you couldn&#39;t quite decipher printed in white. &quot;What kind of pervert is Uncle Jack that he enchants all this stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh he didn&#39;t actually&quot; Jess picked up a leash that had fallen to the floor &quot;Like this one could be used innocently. Just takes control of whoever is wearing it, gives control to the leash holder. But all the sexy stuff, we inherited when we got the store. This building used to be a magic sex shop, the owner disappeared and Dad felt like it&#39;d make the most sense that the property went to another magic family. No idea who the previous perv was. That was before my time. Dad always told me not to mess with this stuff. I mean BESIDES the fact he thought I was too young. Even he doesn&#39;t know what a lot of this stuff does.&quot;<br />
<br />
You observed a strap on that had &#39;The Embiggenator&#39; printed on the side. <br />
Maybe you could try that later tonight? That sounded promising. <br />
Nothing really had labels though. And you weren&#39;t sure how it would interact with the costumes you were currently wearing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guess it would be an awkward fix if you did get cursed with some of this junk.&quot; You acted like you were no longer interested in this part of the store and walked out back to the normal sections. &quot;So you never tried it on anyone or yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess followed &quot;Hm. Weird thing to ask family. But like you said. Awkward fix if you get cursed with it. I&#39;m kind of scared to just touch some of those to be honest.&quot; <br />
<br />
Speaking of.. each step you walked you could still feel that plug inside, pushing around. You&#39;d have to find an excuse to go to the bathroom again. She said the accessories only lasted a certain amount of time, maybe the ears and tail would give up soon... As you passed a mirror you barely recognized yourself these days. <br />
But still you fixed your hair, straightened your stockings and picked out dirt from your manicured french tipped nails. <br />
You were reminded again of how you were perceived as a customer walked in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ma&#39;am do you have toddler Pumpkin Costumes?&quot; an exasperated mom with a baby on her hip asked. <br />
<br />
You sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah let me show you the baby section&quot;<br />
<br />
Your small heels clicked a little as you went to work. Petticoat bouncing with each step. <br />
You would find a way to get out of this. Even if you died trying. <br />
<br />
Well hopefully not if you actually died. But you were determined. <br />
For the moment though. Maybe it was better that customer&#39;s didn&#39;t know you were a man stuck in a woman&#39;s frilly prison. Might as well pass as a girl if that&#39;s what they wanted you to be.</p>
