<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    The real question was whether you should go back to inform Master Harauphar about your discovery or venture deeper into the mushroom forest. This... corruption was nothing you had every heard about before. (Though you had only been in this world for about two days now.)<br />
<br />
       You were about to go back when you realized something. A deep chill when down your spine, making your hair go straight as you realized the truth. Earlier you had breathed in some of the spores. While you managed to cough most of them out, you didn&#39;t like your chances.<br />
<br />
       You focus on your body, examining every part, nothing felt out of the ordinary, yet you couldn&#39;t help it wonder if this infection was already spreading through your veins, slowly corrupting your body and mind.<br />
<br />
        If you went back to Master Harauphar infected, you could possibly infect him too. You could possibly even unwittingly help this corruption spread like the disease it is.<br />
<br />
    You had to explore it on your own, not as a noble sacrifice or a brace deed, but as your duty as a familiar to not bring any harm to your Master. <br />
<br />
       You had already felt it before. This place wasn&#39;t just some corruption, this was a takeover. You once again activate your soul sight and take a look at your environment. The glowing souls of the infected trees, the souls of the diseased animals, they were all connected, they were all one living being. This place was a hive mind.  A hive mind trying to corrupt and spread its influence to more creatures. <br />
<br />
   If even one of them spots you, then all of them have spotted you.<br />
<br />
           <br />
     Regaining your normal senses, you start moving deeper into the corrupted forest. A few minutes in and already you can see how much the corruption changes. The trees were nothing but gigantic mushrooms, gigantic clouds of spores hovered around you, and slowly you saw the grass become replaced by purple toadstools. You stop for a moment, trying to think of a way to get through. Moving through the mushrooms could only spread the possible infection in your body even faster. You had to be more careful.<br />
<br />
    You think and like a flash an idea pops into your mind. You take a deep breath, channeling your innate kitsune abilities and pulling the flame out of your stomach and out through your mouth, you spit out a constant thin stream of green flame, burning the ground beneath you, leaving only charred mushrooms left behind with even the spores getting incinerated as well.<br />
<br />
      You give yourself a mental pat on the back as you continue your trek deeper into the forest, making sure to burn everywhere you plan to walk, then stomping down the flames after burning.<br />
<br />
    Slowly as you went deeper and deeper into the Corrupted forest, you saw that the nearby Corrupted animals which consisted of mainly birds, rabbits and squirrels watch you with an eerie silence. Their eyes were completely white and pupiless yet there was a foreign intelligence to them. <br />
<br />
      As you move, they followed from behind, making sure to keep their distance. You had an idea now that if you kept going they would quickly become hostile. You briefly considered eating their souls and be done with it but quickly shook that idea out of your head. You had no idea what this infection was and you certainly didn&#39;t want to eat a diseased soul.<br />
<br />
          Instead you slightly increase the power of your fire and continue and at faster pace, keeping a keen eye on the animals. The animals move faster to keep up with you and you notice that they were slowly becoming more closer as you walked. Enough of this you thought.<br />
<br />
        You quickly do a 180 spin and face the approaching animals, going into an aggressive stance, your tails flaring behind you.<br />
<br />
     The mushroom animals try to hiss but instead, a deep gargle comes out of their mouths instead and their mouths drool slightly with a purple ooze. <br />
<br />
      Your still conjuring your green flame and edge closer to them, giving a slight smirk as they hiss away from the green flames licking at them. <br />
<br />
          The animals slowly reced back, blocked from their objective of reaching you.<br />
<br />
        Curious to see what they would do, you extinguish your flames and the fear that was in their eyes fade slightly.<br />
<br />
          Then, one of the birds that had been watching overhead, with wings that were once beautiful and soft now covered in a layer of putrid fungal matter swoops down to you raising its legs to try and attack you.<br />
<br />
       At the last second, you nimbly dodge out of it&#39;s claws way and give a loud roar before blasting it with your fox fire. As the bird is consumed greedily by your flames, it gives out a gurgle mixed with pain and terror, spitting out volumes of ooze as it falls to the ground and dies.<br />
<br />
     The watching animals respond to the death of their fallen friend and leap at you, however you expected this and before any of them could get closer to you, you blast them as well. The animals shriek a chorus of agony as they too burn to the core, the green flame quickly consuming them and leaving only charred remains. <br />
<br />
        After making sure all of the animals you had burned were dead, you observe your surroundings. There were no more animals in sight. <br />
<br />
      Giving one last look back, you turn aroufb and continue on your way, using your green flames to clear the way like earlier.<br />
<br />
       <br />
     Due to your caution, progress is slow and steady, however you eventually find something that surprises you, an old cobblestone road barely visible through the growing fungus. Curious, you follow it and your eyes go wide as eventually you are led to what seems to be an old temple shrine.  Dank and covered in fungal matter like everything else, this temple you felt at one point was modest and aged with time. <br />
<br />
        The roughly the size of Master Harauphar&#39;s cottage, you couldn&#39;t see much of its details due to the thick mushrooms that not even your flames seemed to burn (Interesting, was it possibly becoming flame-retardant after you had burned some mushrooms earlier?) you saw that it was mostly made of a old stone material, brittle and weathered with time.<br />
<br />
         A doorless entryway led inside the temple, inside you saw movement within. Should you go in?</p>
