<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stephanie gently bites her bottom lip, smiling at the Macbook’s elegant trackpad controls as she scrolls down the Chronivac options. She selects an option to scan the nearest person, and it reads as follows:<br />
<br />
Stephanie Napolitano<br />
Age: 19<br />
Species: human<br />
Gender: female &#9792;<br />
Height: 5’5<br />
Weight: 144lbs<br />
Eye color: green<br />
Hair color: Dark brown<br />
Sexuality: homosexual<br />
<br />
Interesting… it even knows she’s gay. Even <i>she</i> still considers herself open and exploring, but the Chronivac appears fully decided on the matter. Well then, what could Stephanie choose to change about herself?<br />
<br />
She dragged her cursor over her listed attributes, and saw suggestions appear next to them. “Stephanie Napolitano” yielded suggestions like “Margaret Jones”, “Tian Yazhu”, ext. Hovering over “Age: 19” brought up suggestions like “45”, “70”, “10”, “2”... interesting. Looking at “Species” produced “Wolf”, “Cat”, “Goat”, and “Anthropomorphic options…”. Wow, so it could even turn you into a furry?<br />
<br />
But then, Stephanie dragged the cursor down to “Gender”, and she was struck the moment she saw “Suggestion: Male &#9794;” next to it. That little &#9794; symbol caught her eye. She was suddenly transfixed on the idea. Out of impulse, she clicked on it.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, several things in the bio changed.<br />
<br />
Steven Napolitano<br />
Gender: Male &#9794;<br />
Height: 5’8<br />
Weight: 160lbs<br />
<br />
Reading that little description, Stephanie’s heart fluttered. Her breathing slowed. She scrolled to the bottom of the bio and clicked “Read more…” And shamelessly, she went straight to the detailed size descriptions.<br />
<br />
Penis size: 4.5 inches flaccid, 5.5 inches erect<br />
<br />
Stephanie suddenly breathed in really fast, and put her hand on the front of her pants. The thought that, as a man, she would have a perfectly average sized penis… something about that amazed her. She thought the idea of a giant dick would be more appealing, but the notion that she could be such a perfectly normal guy, fitting right in with the crowd with nothing standing out about him… the fantasy was intoxicating.<br />
<br />
Stephanie kept reading the description. The specific measurements… the hairiness… she started to rub herself between the legs. She reached her finger over to the ‘Save’ button, her heart racing as the cursor neared it. Her rubbing accelerated as the cursor laid right above ‘Save’, and her finger placed on the button. She could have this body, right now, right here in the dorm…<br />
<br />
...in her dorm! The girl’s dorm! What would Stephanie do, suddenly in a different body? She would have to pretend she was out sick or something, but how would she move around campus in a dude’s body? Stephanie’s rubbing stopped. Now she was afraid. What could go wrong? How long will this transformation last for?<br />
<br />
She went back a bit, and saw the ‘Transformation duration’ option. She gasped and thrust her hand down the front of her pants the moment she read that. There is no risk. No worry. There’s nothing standing between her and a gender switch. She sets the time to “5 hours” and then immediately hits ‘Save’ without thinking about it.<br />
<br />
That’s it. If this device works, there’s nothing that will stop Stephanie’s transformation.<br />
<br />
Her shoes feel tight.<br />
“Ow. ACKGHH!” Stephanie yells, hastily taking her shoes and socks off before her feet start hurting any more. In that moment, she is stopped silent by what she sees. Her feet no longer look like her feet. They are bigger, bulkier, and have a little bit of hair on them.<br />
<br />
She watches as hair starts growing up her ankles. Thicker, darker and rougher than it gets no matter how long she’s ever put off shaving. Her heart races; everything goes pale. Her hand is still in her pants; the button has come loose and the zipper has gown down. She slides her hand further down inside her underwear, and starts rubbing her vulva with her palm. She hastily and awkwardly uses her other hand to yank off her jeans, and then watch as the hair continues to spread up her calves. Her muscles become different, her skin becomes a bit rougher. Seconds later, her thighs become leaner, and then also grow hair. Stephanie blushes and sweats, as she curls up her fingers and starts to massage her clit. She reaches under her pillow for where she keeps her dildo, but she has some difficulty in her coordination as she continues to be heavily distracted.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, a surge of sensations are concentrated into her pelvis. Stephanie yells and moans, almost forgetting the possibility of people out the door able to hear her. She is feeling something similar to the thrill of free-falling (roller coasters, skydiving, ext), but only in her pelvic area. Then a sensation like the world’s heaviest, most relaxing massage is felt on her hips. Like someone is pressing them so tight that they are being pressed in; the bone structure itself becoming smaller with every cubic centimeter of flesh on fire with pleasure. She breathes loudly and heavily as her G-spot begins to move backwards and becomes a prostate. At this time, Stephanie finally managed to grab her dildo out from her pillow, and without even thinking about it turned herself around and started pressing it against her ass instead of her vagina. At this point, Stephanie was drooling all over her chin and she didn’t even notice. She was panting and wheezing with every breath.<br />
<br />
She was laying there, on her chest, her ass pointing up with the tip of a dildo pressing itself through her underwear, about half an inch into her bottom, feeling a feeling she’s never felt before. A second later, the feeling in the front started to shift too. Stephanie bit her lip hard as she rubbed her clit, and then kept rubbing it, and kept rubbing. It started to swell, and she circled her index and middle fingers around it. It swelled up more, and Stephanie--almost as is following commands from her creator--pinched it between her index finger and her thumb; twisting it clockwise and counter-clockwise. Her clitoris swelled up even further to the size of a marble, and at this point Stephanie has become completely unaware of the world around her. Her eyes are shut tight and her face is covered in sweat, she doesn’t hear her own constant gasps and rowdy moans. She’s not even in her room or laying on her bed; she is focusing on nothing but her clitoris, which swells up even more to the point that she can put both her index and her middle fingers on it opposite her thumb. She gets caught up in it, drops the dildo and rolls over onto her back. Now her clit is big enough that she can put her entire hand on it, and it isn’t quite a clit anymore. She reaches her free hand over to her pussy… but there’s nothing there. She guides the hand up to her breast instead, and starts massaging and pinching her nipple to squeeze more pleasure out of the experience.<br />
<br />
Stephanie’s clit starts to become thicker, finally escaping from the clutches of her underwear as it shoves the panties off to the side to make room for itself. It can be regarded as a clit no longer. The skin separates into different textures and colors; her urethra snakes itself up inside and forms an opening at the top. It lines itself with a thick layer of corpus cavernosum, and within seconds Stephanie’s pounding heart sends blood up into it and begins to harden in her hand. Stephanie is struck with fear; an exhilarating fear of change. Stephanie no longer has possession of female genitalia. The part of her that she has been rubbing is no longer a clit; it is a dick. Stephanie’s body says goodbye to her vagina, and hello to her penis. She stops twisting it back and forth. Following the orders of her body’s urges, she tugs it up and down, in and out. Each tug sends another small wave of tingles into her pelvis, onto her prostate and all the way up to her heart. Her penis grows a little bit thicker and a little bit longer, but no more. As a man, Steven will have to live with a perfectly average sized dick, and be okay with that.<br />
<br />
The changes continue to rise up to her torso. The body fat that had been taken from her ass and her thighs were reallocated to her belly. Her hormones began to change so fast she felt like she was spinning in a tornado. Her body began pumping itself full of testosterone, replacing most of her estrogen. Stephanie felt her nipple slip out from underneath her fingers. She felt a burning in her chest as the fat in her breasts evaporated into nothing. She felt her flat chest up and down, and could feel hair growing out of it. Her nipple no longer felt sensitive, and her newly freed hand made its way back to the space between her legs, which now yielded a soft, warm scrotum. Two fine, healthy testicles had grown out of her and she didn’t even notice. If Stephanie wished to have and raise kids, the time required of her body shrunk from years to minutes. She held her palm on her new sack, sending a warm, tingly feeling to her penis.<br />
<br />
Her shoulders began to pulse and ache. It was as though someone were pressing on them from the inside; a therapeutic and satisfying stretch began to overtake her ribcage. Her clavicles pressed against her flesh as the vibrations of the mutations reverberated into her lungs and up to her vocal cords. Her vocal cords themselves then began to at first gently tingle, then undulate like a pot of boiling water. Her ability to breathe constrained, she let out faint, soft screams. The screams became lower, and lower, until they were several octaves lower in pitch than when they started.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm FUCK!” Stephanie exclaimed. She didn’t feel as though she had just said anything. It felt like some man had said it, like porn had been left on behind her. “No… NO!” She hisses, feeling powerless to speak, as everything she attempts to utter is stolen by someone else.<br />
“Fuuuuuck…” Stephanie moans, her Adam&#39;s apple fully formed. The tingles went up to her face. She felt her neck getting oily and coarse. She felt her chin rising up; her nose becoming bigger; the skin on her forehead stretching to fit. Suddenly she became physically unable to see or hear properly as the tingle sunk down to her brain. Her pumping motion froze up as her synapses began rewiring her motor skills and her hormonal connection with her body. If not for the fact that “Aware” is selected by default, this would be when the tingle sinks further into her brain and erases all her memories of her body, periods, most of her friends… and replace them with basketball with friends, renting a suit for the prom, and honestly way too much masturbation… but the transformation stopped here. It made only mild alterations to her personality, and then went up to her scalp, shrank her hair from 14 to 2 inches, left the starting seeds of balding in the middle, and then the tingling sensation finally fizzled away into nothingness.<br />
<br />
Steven Napolitano; a nineteen-year-old boy with scruffy brown hair, an above-average jawline width, a scrawny chest with curly hair and a bit of chub on his belly; lay collapsed into a sweating mess wearing a pair of girl&#39;s panties, laying in a girl’s bed, fast asleep. Gently holding his penis like a little boy as it slowly softens and lands silently on his scrotum.<br />
<br />
Time passes. The sun sets.<br />
<br />
Steven wakes up to a familiar sound.<br />
<br />
...the door is being unlocked.</p>
