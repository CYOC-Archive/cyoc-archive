<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After getting my balance from a second lady joining my harem, I started walking over to Alicia.<br />
<br />
Alicia laughs, &quot;I see I won&#39;t be the only one who will be resting in your belly anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still a bit shaken I responded with a laugh &quot;Y-yeah, I guess so.&quot;<br />
<br />
We started walking into the cafeteria and sat down at an empty table. Alicia took this opportunity to enter my womb and started talking to the punk girl. I pulled out my lunch as they started talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, whats up. My names Alicia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, names Sammy but you two can call me Sam.&quot;<br />
<br />
I noticed she was also talking to me, &quot;Nice to meet ya Sam.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lunch went on as Alicia and Sam made more small talk as I ate for the rest of my lunch. After eating my lunch I realized I was still hungry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, did you girls bring any lunch of your own?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I should have a lunchbox in my backpack,&quot; Alicia responded.<br />
<br />
After feeling some movement within my womb I saw Alicia&#39;s hand hold out a grey lunchbox. I grabbed it from her hand and put it on the table. By the time I finished eating Alicia&#39;s lunch, lunch time was over. Both Sam and Alicia exited my womb once we finished cleaning up. They had different classes than me so we said our goodbyes and headed off to our own classes.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day went on pretty much as normal, but I did notice my friend Jack was glancing over at me a lot during our last class together. <br />
<br />
After the final bell rang, I was getting excited thinking about walking back home with my new harem. I soon noticed Jack was approaching me.<br />
<br />
Jack is an average guy. Nothing too special. Average frame with an average face. He wore dark shirts and pants usually, with short brown hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you&#39;re John, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, that&#39;s me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you sure, uh, look different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at Jack, I could tell he was blushing up a storm. He was looking a bit different than I remembered. He was wearing a bright red shirt with some kahki shorts. His hair was also a bit longer, reaching his shoulders. <br />
<br />
He seemed a bit thinner too, but snapping me out of some trance Jack was saying &quot;So, I heard you now have what some people were calling the start of a harem.&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice sounded higher than usual, but I shrugged it off as maybe being a part of all the blushing or his cute face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah. I guess I kinda am making a harem.&quot; I laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could tell Jack was getting super embarrased as he was looking away and was blushing even harder. That could have been his make-up though. Jack was known to act and dress more androgynisly than most guys and was commonly reffered to as a femboy. His hair was now reaching his mid-back and he was wearing a pink shirt and shorts. Looking down his shoes were white-ish pink amd he had calf socks that were white and blue stripes.<br />
<br />
Once again snapping me out of a trance, Jack asked &quot;Who&#39;s in your harem?&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice was definetly higher now, but thats her normal voice as you remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now, I have the tall sporty girl Alicia and the shorter punk girl Sammy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, were you hoping for more Jacklyn?&quot; I asked smugly.<br />
<br />
Jacklyn jumped a bit at me saying her name. It was cute, her baby pink pigtails waving about as her pink skirt fluttered around in the wind. She raised her gloved hands to her (albeit flat) chest as she calmed down for a second. You just noticed her gloves, they were a light pink fingerless gloves that fit her really well. You noticed she also were rubbing her legs together with her knee length socks being shown off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeahh...&quot; said Jacklyn.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, would you like to join them?&quot; I responded flirtingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! I-I mean, yes please.&quot;<br />
<br />
In that moment I saw Jacklyn&#39;s eyes sparkle with determination and I could tell she was serious.<br />
<br />
At that moment I got a full look at her. Jacklyn had two bright pink pigtails that reached her shoulders, framing her perfectly cute face. Her big eyes, small nose, and putite mouth just screamed perfect girly cuteness to you. Going down you saw her A-cups were fit snugly in a shoulderless pink crop top with her lithe frame shaking in excitement. Her dainty hands were clenched tightly with her painted nails shinging in the light.<br />
Her belly button was completely exposed as you felt another umbrilical cord snaking out of your womb and over to Jacklyn. Going down once more her frilly baby blue skirt was waving about while her thigh-length pink and blue striped socks were framing her girly legs and petite white shoes.<br />
<br />
She was going to he a great addition to your harem.<br />
<br />
You reach down to your pussy and spread it for Jacklyn. &quot;Come on in then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacklyn slowly started moving over to me before bending down and slowly started pushing her head into my womb. This was almost on a whole &#39;nother level of pleasure compared to the other girls. The slow movements of Jacklyn nervously finding her way in and the way I felt everything conform to her body shape felt amazing. While in a moment of pleasure I thought of something. Why did I act so differently to Jacklyn? I dismissed it as my reaction to how cute she is when I heard somebody at the classroom door. At this point everyone had already left, so I looked over at the door to find Sam and Alicia staring at me with Jacklyn half way inside of me. Sam and Alicia just smiled at this scene before going to behind Jacklyn and picking her up by the legs to help her get in a bit quicker.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were wondering what was taking you so long.&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were getting a little worried about you, but you seem to be doing just fine.&quot; Alicia said while winking at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... sorry about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once Jacklyn made it inside, Alicia and Sam followed making sure we had all four of our stuff with us.<br />
<br />
&quot;You girls got everything?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
After hearing a trio of yesses, I started our walk home.</p>
