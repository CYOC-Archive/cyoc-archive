<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before he could run two guards grabbed his arms while one began stroking the dicks on his back which cause a sort of queef to escape his face as they dragged him to the break room which looked more like a sex dungeon, except with a couple of vending machines and microwaves. The cock-woman that was behind the front desk was in there, Heather hadn&#39;t paid attention to her before but now Heather couldn&#39;t look away. The woman had breasts that were larger than DD cups trapped in a tight button up suit, showing no cleavage at all and below a quite long dress hugged her cock tail.<br />
&quot;Well now that we&#39;re heading to orientation of the new recruits, I might as well get comfy.&quot; She said over to heather<br />
She then began to take the suit jacket off revealing a mostly white button up, it seemed that stains had appeared on it from working through the day where there were two dark patches under each pit and strangely some around her breasts. But then Heather noticed her hands were a bit hairy for a lady, but then she began to unbutton her shirt which not only revealed huge bushes of hair on her, but also that she didn&#39;t have breasts because on her chest was a massive nutsack held up by a bra. She unbuttoned more revealing something large and puffy on her crotch with another strap above it holding something up behind her. She took the shirt off revealing hard hairy arms as she unhooked the bra letting the sack hang free.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still uncomfortable, trust me.&quot; She said to heather as she took her skirt off revealing a massive donut asshole on her crotch as she undid the strap when suddenly what Heather thought was her ass was actually another nutsack attached right above her tail. She threw the clothes on the floor, picked the pile up and shoved them in her locker.<br />
&quot;That suit gets so hot during the day, orientation is the only time I get to take it off&quot; She explained to Heather, still being held and by the three guards<br />
&quot;Why pape ip oph?&quot; Heather tried to ask<br />
&quot;Why take it off? Body positivity, some of the new recruits have dreamed about this job but we&#39;re afraid to go through the change. I personally didn&#39;t like it when they asked me to go through such a... hairy change, but I soon grew to love it. The hair is great for the winter.&quot; She explained as she escorted him and the three guards to the orientation room filled with beasts like him all sitting in chairs with a buttplug or dildo attached to the center of each one. Heather looked at everyone in the room, each of them had something different about them but Heather was the one that probably stood out the most, all of them had the theme of being very masculine, having a massive dick, and having a vagina for a face. The three that took him in here sat him on a chair with a dildo on it, and a big one at that. They then clipped a name tag onto his chesthair reading &quot;Hello! My name is Heather.&quot; on it. A lot of the people were looking at how much Heather was different than them when suddenly the cock-woman slithered on stage in her hairy glory.<br />
&quot;Welcome to the guard orientation! My name is Claire. I&#39;m sure some of you are nervous for your new lives but we assure you that you&#39;ll learn to be more body positive and happy with where you work.&quot; Claire said before motioning to two guards doing a 69 position on the floor with each other&#39;s cock. Heather looked around the room, depending on how people sat he could tell where some sat very calmly with open legs despite having something shoved up their ass while others found it awkward to sit with the massive chunks of meat on their hairy crotches, Heather had this same problem... except with four and the ones lining his back. Heather looked up to Claire as two scientists brought a projector in where it then projected a very beautiful woman onto the wall.<br />
&quot;This was one of the first guards to go through the change, her name was Bethany but after a few years working here it was changed to Bart.&quot; She said as a door opened revealing a massive hairy man walking in.<br />
He was mostly like everyone else except for the increased muscle mass, hair and a massive cock instead of a clitoris on his face. He then walked up to where Claire stood and faced the recruits.<br />
&quot;Wecom po be owienpapiom&quot; He said as well as he could with the thing in his face<br />
&quot;How would you describe working here?&quot; She asked him<br />
&quot;Howmy&quot; He said<br />
&quot;I&#39;m assuming horny, which is a good thing?&quot; She asked him<br />
He gave a thumbs up before walking to a seat with an extremely large dildo on it and sat down.<br />
&quot;Yeah you guys can&#39;t really make speeches now can you.&quot; She said looking over to Bart<br />
&quot;Oh this is a waste of time...&quot; Claire whispered to herself while putting her hand over her eyes<br />
&quot;But today we have a VERY special new recruit, everyone meet Heather!&quot; She said with a smile motioning for Heather to come up.<br />
Heather slowly tried to get up but realized the chair was stuck in his ass, a new recruits helped him pull it out awkwardly, how he sat showed that he was formerly a she.<br />
&quot;Phanp ou... Phawa&quot; He said to the one named &quot;Sarah&quot; behind him<br />
Sarah was like everyone else, but strangely with very thick hot pink bodyhair and a thick mohawk on his head and going down his back. Heather walked up onto the stage with his cock feet flopping around, this reminded him of when he was a teenage girl working as an elf in a mall for Santa with the big elf shoes, except the shoes were actually his feet now. He heard a few snickers from the crowd as his feet flopped around, but he heard another group of flops from behind him, he remembered the hundreds of dicks flopping on his back. He approached Claire in the front of the room.<br />
&quot;Heather is one of the guards we decided to be more bold with since she was &#39;promoted&#39; from where she worked.&quot; Claire said sharply while looking at Heather<br />
&quot;We decided to up the sensitivity on his skin and add more cocks in more places.&quot; She said as she turned Heather around revealing the dicks on the back<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve already decided that Heather will be guarding the front door, nametag and all to show him off. Maybe a picture of what he used to look like.&quot; Claire said with a bit of a smirk<br />
Heather was afraid to say something in the case that he would get changed more into something more degrading.<br />
&quot;Maybe after a while we can get you upgrades like his.&quot; Claire said before getting closer to Heather <br />
&quot;And maybe after a while we&#39;ll decide to change you back.&quot; Claire whispered to Heather<br />
That statement alone gave Heather some hope. Claire motioned Heather to sit back down.<br />
&quot;As guards your job is to protect the building from anyone trying to get a free change or to stop people from stealing our technology.&quot; Claire said to the group<br />
&quot;But we also need people to star in our pornos so if we need someone, any of you can fill in. Plus when on break feel free to play amongst yourselves, all of you can converse amongst yourselves.&quot; Claire said as she slithered back to the breakroom.<br />
Sarah walked up to Heather and tapped him on the shoulder. <br />
(I&#39;m switching to a normal sounding conversation but keep in mind that they have the speech thing going on.)<br />
&quot;Hi, Heather. Your form is pretty... interesting.&quot; Sarah said in a pretty feminine voice<br />
&quot;Well I didn&#39;t really get to choose my form, I wasn&#39;t doing my last job right so they decided to &#39;promote&#39; me.&quot; Heather explained<br />
&quot;By the way, what&#39;s someone as girly as you doing in here like that?&quot; Heather said kind of rudely<br />
&quot;Well... I needed a job to pay for my mom&#39;s treatments. Any other job I tried to get booted me out so I decided I could work here.&quot; Sarah said glumly<br />
&quot;Treatments? What happened to her?&quot; Heather asked<br />
&quot;Well she has cancer, she&#39;s too frail to work. I would say that I had a dad that could help me but he died in a construction accident.&quot; Sarah explained<br />
&quot;Woah, I&#39;m so sorry to hear that. If there&#39;s anything I can do to help just let me know.&quot; Heather said<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Sarah said<br />
Even though they couldn&#39;t really use facial expressions, Heather could tell Sarah was pretty sad.<br />
&quot;But I love the hair! What made you choose such a hairy body?&quot; Heather asked<br />
&quot;Oh, well I wanted to stay a little feminine so I wouldn&#39;t forget my girly side. The amount of hair is because I honestly like hairy guys so why not try being one of the hairiest guys?&quot; He explained<br />
&quot;Well what about this then?&quot; Heather asked then flicking the punk style mane going down his back<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s just because it&#39;s fun.&quot; He said<br />
Suddenly an intercom came on into the room.<br />
&quot;Everyone come to the front desk for patrol routes through the building. Heather, come to the front desk.&quot; Claire said from the speaker<br />
As Heather went back to the front desk...</p>
