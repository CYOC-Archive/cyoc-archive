<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As if going to his lame sister’s lame wedding wasn’t enough, Lars was being told to dress up for it too.<br />
<br />
He hated getting dressed up nicely. Long dark pants, a restrictive suit jacket, a choking tie, and dumb heeled shoes that made his heels ache. Heels were for girls, so why did his dress shoes have to have even a slight one?<br />
<br />
He hated the idea of going, he hated that he’d have to sit through a long and boring ceremony, and he hated that he couldn’t find his stupid left sock.<br />
<br />
He had one pair of black dress socks but there was only one in his drawer, he’d looked high and low but failed to find one.it’s partner. It was just his luck. First his weekend is ruined by his sister deciding to lock herself into marriage with the only guy who’d ever boned her, then he’d somehow ruin her perfect day by having mismatched socks.<br />
<br />
“Stupid Francis,” Lars grumbled as he stood up with a sigh, his entire dorm room turned inside out. He clasped his hands together and started imitating her voice. “This is going to be the happiest day in my life. I can’t wait to spend the rest of it with Greg and his premature balding. Blegh, maybe someone lost a sock in the laundry room...”<br />
<br />
There was a pile of discarded clothes in there, an xxxl men’s shirt, a bunch of those girly short socks, and nestled in the dryer, a stray black dress sock.<br />
<br />
“Bingo!” He exclaimed as he pulled it out, an incredibly old black socks with a lot of frayed patches and awkward stretching. He pulled that ancient thing onto his foot and it fit snugly enough. No one would notice it so long as the colour was right. “Now, to waste my Saturday on my sister...”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The wedding was to take place in a stuffy church packed to the brim with distant cousins, aunts who would throw a fit if they weren’t invited, and quote unquote friends for whom this would be their first meeting with the bride in ten years and their last. It all made Lars roll his eyes as he was crammed in with his family in that overcrowded church next to his already crying mother and bored younger brother.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, look at them all,” Lars grumbled to his mother under all the buzz of chatter. Rows upon rows of unnecessary guests crowded the church and made it so hot and loud. “There are only about fifty people who need to be here.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t be so rude,” his tearful mother scolded. “Your sister can invite whomever she wants to her wedding.<br />
<br />
“Well when I get married it’s only going to be about fifty people,” Lars grumbled under his breath, crossing his arms and failing to notice his socks had shrunk into girly small ones and his shoes had changed. The slight men’s heel shrunk into a small point an elevated while the shoe itself shifted, showing off more of his foot and shrinking in size. His feet got smaller and daintier until he had feminine feet wrapped up in blue coloured high heels.<br />
<br />
Then it was time for his sister to come in, being led down the aisle by his father in a big wedding dress that she could hardly walk in. The sight of the thing made Lars wrinkle his nose in disgust. It was this over complicated mess of layers that looked heavy and awkward and had done nothing but stress his sister out and make her diet so she could fit the exact size it demanded from her. Her waist couldn’t move from restriction and it didn’t look like she could sit down or stand up on her own.<br />
<br />
“God that dress is awful,” Lars laughed while elbowing his little brother.<br />
<br />
“Dude, it’s her wedding, shut up,” his brother grumbled making Lars frown.<br />
<br />
“When I get married I’ll wear something nice and simple, something easy to wear,” Lars muttered to himself, unaware that his pant legs had just began to fuse. The crotch lowered down his legs until it hit his ankles where it fanned open, leaving him in a pitch black skirt that fell all the way down to his ankles. Underneath of his leg hair receded until he was left with smooth and hairless legs that quickly began to expand and contract until they were shapely and feminine, matching his feet well.<br />
<br />
The ceremony began with a long religious procession before a priest started yammering on about the importance of marriage and beginning some sort of ancient and yawn inducing ceremony. It was so boring Lars nearly fell asleep and they had to keep standing up and sitting down which was hard in his heels. No one was enjoying that ceremony except maybe his super pious relatives who were all a stone’s throw from death. Even then he had his suspicions.<br />
<br />
“You know, I feel like this could all go a lot quicker,” he grinned while leaning towards his dad.<br />
<br />
“It’s tradition Lars, shut up,” his dad growled making Lars slink back grumpily, arms crossed in annoyance.<br />
<br />
“Well I’m not putting myself or anyone else through this when I get married,” Lars muttered grumpily. His underwear retracted until he was wearing a nice pair of panties instead of the boxers he’d put on that morning. His plumbing also began to rearrange itself. His testicles both retracted into his body and began to burrow into his pelvis while his dick retracted slowly into his body, spreading out and turning into the womanly folds of a vagina. If she felt the change she didn’t do anything beyond scratch her butt when it started to itch, flesh expanding outwards until she had a round womanly rear and curvy hips.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, this is so stuffy,” Lara complained while tugging at her tie uncomfortably. Nothing like shoving a bunch of people in an unventilated church. She did not like it at all, she’d want an outdoor venue for her own wedding, out in a bunch of gardens even if it was raining. The fresh air, the smell of freshly mown grasses and cut hedges, that was what she was dreaming her own wedding would be like.<br />
<br />
“Stop playing with your tie,” her father ordered and she pouted at him, crossing her arms in annoyance. Her suit jacket began to merge with her shirt, her tie evaporating and her neck becoming free from strain. Her mess of a shirt merged with her skirt and the dress began to change. It rose up to her knees, coloured blue, the sleeves retreated up her arms and vanished entirely, and her neckline lowered further and further until you could see the slightest amount of cleavage. She gasped in relief the second her skin was on display, able to sweat for her.<br />
<br />
Her arms became less hairy and the hairs remaining turned nearly invisible and blondish. Then her limbs slimmed down and her shoulders pulled inwards at the same time as her waist pinching in. Then her chest welled forward and began to fill her dress in, a bra growing around her new boobs as they pushed outwards halting when she had a cute little bit of cleavage on display. Her dress was comfortable and fitting. She could actually breathe and there was enough skin of display to keep her relatively cool.<br />
<br />
The vow exchange was next and Lars watched it with a smile. It was so cute to see her sister all happy. Just seeing her sister’s wedding was making her dream about her own. Sure Francis had a pretty stuffy and old fashioned affair but it was still her wedding and Lars watched them exchange those vows with a sigh, wishing she could be doing that with someone already. What girl didn’t dream of her wedding day? In fact she could remember many late nights spent with her sister chattering about their future weddings when they’d been forced to share a room, spending a girl’s night together and envying their brother and his whole room to himself.<br />
<br />
Lara’s smile soon became surrounded by lipstick, her cleanly shaven face decorating with makeup while her jawline sucked in. Her neck got slimmer and her voice became feminine while her eyelashes got longer and painted black with dark mascara. Her eyebrows were plucked small and finally her hair grew out of her scalp, a heavenly blonde that matched her mom’s from old pictures of her. It styled itself expertly, in fact she’d had it done at a hair appointment earlier that day all so she’d look nice in pictures for her sister. It was nice but not as gorgeous as Francis’ hair. Lars was a little envious and stared longingly at her sister, all dressed up in white and glowing with beauty. She couldn’t wait to get married too, to stand up at an alter with someone and sweat her everlasting love to him or her.<br />
<br />
“All this excitement was worth it,” she sighed dreamily. She’d been looking forward to this day for ages now, ever since finding out Greg had proposed to her sister. He was such an amazing guy and she was lucky to have him. Earrings emerged on her ears as she smiled dreamily, her transformation into Lars complete. She watched her sister be proclaimed a Mrs. and smiled from ear to ear as the bride and groom exchanged a beautiful kiss. Weddings were wonderful and Lars couldn’t wait to have one of her own.</p>
