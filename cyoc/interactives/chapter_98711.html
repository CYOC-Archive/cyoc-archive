<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martha walked quietly and quickly from the Twist home and returned her own home. She found the front door unlocked and entered, though she figured that this was from Nate and Eric&#39;s earlier departure for school. She found her husband fully dressed and actually getting ready to head to the college for his day. With the hearings for Yvette over and with there not being any major legal issues to handle, all William had was his own school work, though he did look pleased to see her as Martha came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Martha said softly, &quot;Sorry I missed breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; William answered, &quot;I kinda figured you wouldn&#39;t be here for breakfast when you did didn&#39;t return last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha didn&#39;t actually get much time to answer, as she soon found herself in a firm hug and being dipped back before William gave her a very passionate welcome home kiss. She did return  it and gave a smile in response. All of it seemed to simply show how fast their marriage was healing. William&#39;s passion had never faded and with her new werecat libido, Martha had found herself far more willing to burn just as passionately as her husband, and so far, being a werefox was giving him a level of loyalty that hadn&#39;t really been there before.<br />
<br />
As the two of them came up for air from the kiss, William spoke, &quot;I did miss you though...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... if you play your cards right,&quot; Martha smiled, &quot;we&#39;ll have plenty of fun tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
William smiled in response and let Martha stand back up, &quot;So how was girls&#39; night? Did you have fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My night was ppuuurrrrrrrrfect,&quot; Martha responded with a smile as William let her go for the moment, &quot;lots of fun with the Twists in werecat on werecat action...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha then decided to tell William about Samantha&#39;s photograph.<br />
<br />
&quot;though you wouldn&#39;t believe how GOOD a night Eric had with Julie...&quot; she began.<br />
<br />
&quot;That they kissed at the local diner?&quot; William asked back with a raised eyebrow.<br />
<br />
Martha blinked and William quietly explained his explanation calmly. It wasn&#39;t that either William or Martha were the sort of people to engage in gossip, but they did have concerns regarding Eric and the things that had held him down in Minnesota. Neither of them wanted to see Eric hurt, and while a part of their minds wouldn&#39;t mind if Eric did decide to become a were at some point, they wouldn&#39;t force it on him and they would fight tooth and claw to defend Eric&#39;s right to remain normal if he so chose. Though, from his talk, William was fairly sure that Eric had already made his decision on whether or not to remain a normal human or become a were of some kind or variety. And while he had to get ready for work, he figured it best to let Martha know the basics on his talk with his younger son.<br />
<br />
&quot;He reported it to me when he came home,&quot; William said softly, &quot;along with how rapidly his relationship is progressing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha looked over to her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;He says he loves her and truly loves her,&quot; William continued, &quot;that he&#39;ll become a were FOR her...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha&#39;s eyes widened. That was fast. It wasn&#39;t too unlike the love she felt for the Twists, in addition to her love for William and her family, in terms of how fast it came about, but the speed with which it was happening also reminded Martha that Eric was only fourteen. Her decision to become a werecat, engage in a rather open marriage for her with one night being a night with William and another being a &quot;girls&#39; night&quot; was one thing. She was a fully grown woman and in pure theory of one decision or the other blew up in her face, she would know and take the consequences. But Eric was only fourteen and coming out of some very peer pressure related issues in Minnesota. If things went south between him and Julie, things could be worse for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fast...&quot; Martha said slowly, &quot;are you sure...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what he told me,&quot; William answered, &quot;that he will become a were to be with Julie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha sighed as she didn&#39;t really know what to do. She wanted to support Eric and wanted to see him happy, but neither did she want to push him into a mistake or let him rush into one on his own. He and Julie had plenty of time to finalize their respective decisions and be together, and with Yvette out of the way and three members of the Anderson family being weres, there was no need for Eric to rush to any decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;We may need to talk with both Martin and Melissa to see how to respond and work with all this,&quot; William told her, &quot;as we don&#39;t want either of them to rush anything and hurt the other accidentally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded, &quot;though that&#39;ll take time... hopefully you did tell Eric NOT to rush into any rash decision...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; William answered.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the Twists settled into cleaning up after breakfast. The night had been pleasureful and after Martha left, Samantha and Francis began discussing some of the dreams they had had.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... I got you pregnant,&quot; Samantha said slowly, &quot;You do remember that I am one hundred percent female, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;and I never said dreams always make sense. In fact... it&#39;s usually pretty rare that they do. They&#39;re part of our subconscious minds that respond to either things that we&#39;ve thought about or desire on some level.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you desire to have a baby?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind having a baby... when Ben grows up and moves out,&quot; Frances admitted, &quot;Do you remember when he was little? When he made play forts with the dinning room chairs and the couch cushions and pretended he was battling the Galactic Empire?&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha chuckled at the games Ben had played as a youngster pretending to be either Han Solo or Luke Skywalker, she could never remember which character Ben had pretended he was. There were also plenty of other good memories that she had raising Ben after she and Frances adopted him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Samantha smiled, &quot;and if you want... we could go to the hospital and you could get a sperm sample there... IF that&#39;s what you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s really what I want,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;how we&#39;ll respond to being empty-nesters is still very much a future issue... and even if I decide to do that... I don&#39;t want to do anything that make you think that I don&#39;t love you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Frances,&quot; Samantha began as she wrapped her harms around around Frances. She wanted to tell Frances that if she wanted to be a mother, Samantha would always love her, no matter what. However, she didn&#39;t get the chance as her phone began ringing earnestly. Samantha sighed and went to it and answered, &quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Twist... I know this is early but we could have a problem,&quot; it was her secretary on the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sherri... you&#39;re in early...&quot; Samantha spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... but it&#39;s a good thing I am, as we could have a problem,&quot; her secretary, Sherri, answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Samantha asked with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Late last night a normal came in to one of our hotels,&quot; Sherri answered, &quot;he doesn&#39;t intend to stay long, but he said he was looking for a Sasquatch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha sighed heavily. A cryptozoologist, the sort of person who could very well go looking for were-beasts. While the likelihood of were-beasts being exposed to the rest of humanity was possible and even likely given how good technology was getting, but until they were ready to show they weren&#39;t the movie monsters they were portrayed as, they had to protect their secrecy. Her secretary heard Samantha&#39;s sigh and continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;It gets worse,&quot; Sherri spoke, &quot;according to the clerk running the motel, the Sasquatch that he has a picture of is actually a weregorilla...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A weregorilla... is there any record of them in Moon Lake?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but the clerk was sure it was a weregorilla,&quot; Sherri answered, &quot;you may need to talk with him... make sure he doesn&#39;t or can&#39;t expose us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Samantha sighed, &quot;check our archives and I&#39;ll meet up with the police to meet with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Samantha sighed heavily and hung up.<br />
<br />
&quot;It never ends,&quot; Frances commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Samantha sighed, &quot;I wish we could get some moments of peace and quiet... but sometimes a lot of action happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances nodded, as she had her first therapy session with Jenny that morning and would probably begin Yvette&#39;s psych evaluation later in the day.</p>
