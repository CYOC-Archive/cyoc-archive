<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, that was good,&quot; my mother commented as we made our way out, &quot;fast... but good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fast?&quot; Molly quipped, &quot;it's felt like ages to get THIS far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it's nothing against you or George, dear,&quot; my mother answered, &quot;and I can understand it... it's just that when I had pictured you and George getting married it was something joyous... you would look beautiful in my old wedding dress... George would be wearing a tux that fit... it would be beautiful and bright...&quot;<br />
<br />
She then sighed as I opened my truck door to let Molly climb into the backseat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... Molly will overheat if we dress her up too much,&quot; my mother then sighed, &quot;we've spent too much to be able to afford a tux, though not that I'd trust the people here to be able to fit it properly... and we'll probably have a ton of people shouting slurs through the ceremony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think they'll know when the ceremony will be,&quot; Molly commented, &quot;Most of the guys that have joined R.A.M. seem to be more of the direct, insult you as you come in the door type of people. The kind of people that are extremists and piss off everyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's partially why I had preferred you two stay near Peoria,&quot; my mother sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would have been tougher, there, mom,&quot; I repeated what I seemed to have to say to my mother when she wanted me to stay close to &quot;home&quot;, &quot;Molly needs space to stretch her legs and not feel like she's going to have a hundred people watching her. Even if we had gotten rural property there, we would have had to get permission from half a dozen different people to get avoid prosecutions for trespassing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that permission would need to be received again after she leaves it once, and she would be at mercy of the owner,&quot; my father added, &quot;although a lot of that sounds like you're trying to make Molly live like a mundane animal...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's my choice,&quot; Molly came to my defense, &quot;the instincts are there. I can't get away from them. Out here I can control them and let them out without harming anyone. For the most part, it's a stress reliever and it allows me function without going nuts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And hopefully it works,&quot; my father commented, &quot;though I can't help but feel that that freak show has unleashed a horrible &quot;genie in the bottle&quot; sort of thing. And from a certain viewpoint, it won't be good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; I sighed, &quot;but Molly and I can't be the whole picture... and a lot of that is BIG. And what would be the solution to that? Kill Molly and I because we aren't the snapshot photo of what is &quot;good&quot;... a lot of those things sound needlessly cruel to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And to me as well, son,&quot; my father answered, &quot;and I'm probably being more philosophical then anything else with this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's leave the class in the car then,&quot; my mother spoke up, &quot;we're supposed to be preparing for a wedding in three days... counting today.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
We returned quietly to Bandhavgarh Cabin. There were still some things to prepare. I needed to call Dave to see if he and his family wanted to attend. As we all got out, I also heard my mother move on to what was her next order of business.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you intend to wear, dear? I can help you get it ready,&quot; my mother spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have much,&quot; Molly sighed, &quot;the only clothes that fit me right and doesn't irritate my fur are the silk dresses that were made to fit me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure one of them would be fine,&quot; my mother commented, &quot;do you need it cleaned? Pressed? Something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're good, mom, we're good,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;and to be honest, this doesn't have to be a very formal affair. And given the political climate... going formal would only attract trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
By that time we had made it inside. Molly and my mother went into the living room, still discussing something, but by that time, I had made my way upstairs and couldn't hear the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what are you up to, son?&quot; my father asked as I moved into the room I shared with Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured I'd call Dave and let him know about the wedding,&quot; I told him, &quot;he and his family have been the only people we've been fairly close with on something other then a professional level...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the only one that hasn't betrayed you and Molly from what I've heard,&quot; my father commented as I sat down and dialed Dave's number.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; was the answer on the phone, &quot;Dave, speaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Dave, it's me,&quot; I spoke, &quot;How were your holidays?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; Dave answered, &quot;Veronica loves her toys, and Tabby and I enjoyed the venison you and Molly gave us.&quot;<br />
<br />
I blinked a little at that, but I figured it was the time of year to be generous.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good to hear,&quot; I commented, &quot;I have a question for you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Molly and I will be getting married on the twenty-ninth,&quot; I told him, &quot;I was wondering if you wanted to come.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're inviting me?&quot; Dave asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tabby and Veronica are welcome to come, too,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just propose?&quot; Dave snickered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just yesterday,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I'll come!&quot; Dave said in an excited voice, &quot;you and Molly deserve to have some happiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's great,&quot; I answered, &quot;it isn't a formal affair so you probably won't need your Sunday best, but I'd assume tee shirts and jeans aren't allowed either...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Semi-formal, gotcha,&quot; Dave answered, &quot;where is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At the Catholic church,&quot; I said, &quot;at two PM on the twenty-ninth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay! See you there, buddy!&quot; Dave told me, &quot;and congratulations!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; I said as hung up the phone.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And then the twenty-ninth arrived. The ceremony lacked a lot of the pomp and pageantry seen in a lot of weddings, mostly because everything was so impromptu. But it did have the results that Molly and I wanted for the wedding. It was quiet with no R.A.M. members in the area. That alone made the day happy. The fact that the few family and friends that Molly and I had were also there made both Molly and I feel proud.<br />
<br />
&quot;My children, we are gathered here to join one George Wayne and Molly Rhoer in holy matrimony,&quot; Father Lopez spoke as Molly and I stood in front of him, &quot;marriage is a tremendously joyous moment and George and Molly truly deserve it for all they have endured to come this far.&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Lopez looked over to Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly Rhoer has suffered the loss of her humanity, which many refuse to let her forget,&quot; Father Lopez continued and then glanced to me, &quot;George Wayne has sacrificed much to try to provide for Molly everything she needs to be happy. And it displays a firm bond between these two, that God will smile on.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked over at Molly, who stood there holding a small bouquet of flowers that Veronica had gotten somewhere and handed her when the Choir family arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;If anyone has any reason why these two should not be joined in wedlock, please speak now, or forever hold your peace,&quot;  Father Lopez then spoke and we waited for a moment. When no one said anything, he turned to Molly, &quot;Molly Rhoer, will you take George Wayne, to have and hold, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, for as long as you both shall live?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Molly spoke.<br />
<br />
Father Lopez then turned to me, &quot;and do you, George Wayne take Molly Rhoer to have and to hold, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, for as long as you both shall live?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; I responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then by the powers invested in my by almighty God, I know pronounce you Man and Wife,&quot; Father Lopez spoke, &quot;You may now &quot;kiss&quot; the bride.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly nuzzled my cheek with her muzzle. I responded by kissing the tip of her nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, George.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too, Molly,&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Throw the bouquet!&quot; Veronica cheered from her seat, making Molly and I chuckle.<br />
<br />
While Father Lopez quietly returned to his own business, Molly and I slowly made our way to Dave's family and my parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you what,&quot; Molly said to Veronica, &quot;since George's mom and your mom are already married, how about I hand it to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The little girl took the floors slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By tradition, the person to catch the bouquet is the next person to get married,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
The flowers were tossed back to Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boys are icky!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure you'll change your mind eventually,&quot; Tabby chuckled down at her daughter, &quot;Congratulations, George, Molly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, congratulations,&quot; Dave added.</p>
