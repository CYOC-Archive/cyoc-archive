<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not knowing what to do with her detached body parts, Jennifer decided to just put them on her bed for now and go take shower in the hope it would help her loose some of her stress. Maybe once she was more calm she would think more clearly on what she needed to do.<br />
<br />
Unknown to her, while she ran her shower Kyle would enter her room.<br />
— – - – —<br />
Kyle had found a tree with a good enough view of Jen&#39;s bedroom, in her own backyard. The wood giant even had an old tree house in it, probably a remain of Jen&#39;s childhood. He had expected see a flat-chested Jennifer, wanting to take a compromising picture of the queen-bee for blackmail purpose. Instead, he saw her breasts, ass and pussy laying on her bed.<br />
<br />
Using a sturdy branch which, lucky him, was going all the way to Jen&#39;s window, he entered her bedroom. Pressed by time, and since he hadn&#39;t thought to take his backpack, he emptied Jennifer&#39;s one before putting her ‘lost bits’ in it and flew the scene.<br />
<br />
Jen felt someone was touching her detached pieces, of course, but by the time she was back in her room, Kyle was long gone.<br />
— – - – —<br />
Knowing that, by then, both of his parents would be at work, Kyle decided to return home and study his loot.<br />
<br />
Once in his room, he emptied his stolen bag and started by examining Jen&#39;s boobs. Wondering what it&#39;s like to have those, he put one in each hand and placed them on his chest. Then he felt them attach and felt two things slip from underneath his new boobs, namely his former manboobs, seeing them fall on his bed.<br />
<br />
In panic, he ran toward the bathroom. At first he didn&#39;t think to support his stolen boobs, but they moved so much it rapidly hurt, forcing him to grab them to diminish that. On the way he pass before an old photo, dating to the last time his mother had a full day she was able to pass with him, more than a year sooner.<br />
<br />
But something was strange on the photo. It was still the same shot of him and his mother, taken the same summer on the same beach, and wearing the same boardshorts. But on that photo he now sported breasts supported by a bikini top, although they only were B-cup on the shot instead of the C-cup currently attached to his chest, and nobody on the shot bated an eye at a boy with boobs, like it was perfectly normal. (Despite the fact that none of the other boys seen in the background had any boobs themselves.)<br />
<br />
Shocked, Kyle walked to the bathroom were he knew he could find a portable mirror. On the way back to his bedroom, he also took the photo.<br />
<br />
Once back he sat on his bed, not noticing he was putting his has on top of the one he stole from Jennifer. Like before with her breasts, the new ass took the place of his birth one, who detached itself from his body. But this time it took all his excess fat with it, making his body be just as sexily shaped than Jen&#39;s used to. The photo now displayed what could have been a sexy teenage girl, if it wasn&#39;t for the bulge in the bottom part of her bikini, ‘her’ adam&#39;s apple or the still masculine face of Kyle.<br />
<br />
Desperate, the technically still a boy tried to put back in place is manboobs and ass, but they refused.<br />
<br />
Dejected, and thinking turning 100% girl would still be better than to stay stuck this way, de decided to put Jen&#39;s slit where he still had his boyhood, and like expected it took the place of said boyhood, who detached itself from his body. That last change caused an interse wave of pleasure in the former boy&#39;s body, making her moan. It gave her an occasion to hear her voice become feminine.<br />
<br />
Looking at both the portable mirror and the shot, she noticed that her face to had changed, becoming a feminine version of his old one, minus the excess fat said old face had in it. And she was forced to admit, the result was far more sexy than she would have expected.<br />
<br />
The other thing she noticed was that, while she still remembered her old life as Kyle, she also remembered the life of the girl in the photo. And if she believed her new memories, Kylee Perkins had inherited Jen&#39;s former place in their school social scene. Just like Jennifer used to, Kylee was the cheer squad leader and the queen bee of Hampton High, if not of all East Hampton. To make thing simple, in this new reality if Kylee said something or someone was ‘in’, then everyone in Hampton High (and even some outside of it) would automatically accept it as fact and act accordingly, idem for what she claimed was totally ‘out’.<br />
<br />
But even in this new reality, Kylee Perkins wasn&#39;t Jennifer Smith. Jen had opted to act like the stereotypical queen bitch for fear of being rejected if she didn&#39;t act like was expected of her, hiding her true, nerdy self. Kylee for her part, never cared for the peoples that couldn&#39;t accept her for who she was, and if you couldn&#39;t accept her for who she was, then you weren&#39;t worth her time.<br />
<br />
So yeah, the leader of the cheer squad was good at school, loved comics and video games, had nerds among her friends, is bisexual and, when not in uniform (be it the school&#39;s or the squad&#39;s) dressed like the tomboy she is. (Although a damn sexy one.) And if anyone at a problem with it, they could jump from the top of a building for all she cared!<br />
<br />
All those changes in her school&#39;s social dynamic had let Jade G&#333;ng, one of her fellow cheerleader, to admit her homosexuality in the new timeline. Kylee and her were currently dating, even.<br />
<br />
But if you think everything was better with Kyle being Kylee, you would be terribly wrong. Somehow the change also transferred Jennifer&#39;s parents success in business to Kylee&#39;s. And if the Smiths had been good but very successful peoples with an insufferable bitch for daughter, the Perkins were wretched peoples with an inexplicably nice daughter, and were now holding the city in their iron grip. Kylee simply hadn&#39;t delved far enough in her new memories to realize it.<br />
… Not that she could do much about it, anyway.<br />
— – - – —<br />
Jen, who was already panicked by the loss of her detached parts, not knowing who had taken them or to were, became a crying, shuddering mess when she lost all sensations in her boobs. Then she lost all sensations in her ass and turned into an unresponsive, catatonic mess.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t say when she fell asleep, so she didn&#39;t notice that her parents got back home far later than what she was used too. As she woke up, still a tight ball on the floor of her room, she saw her backpack on her bed, a post-it on it which said &quot;You better accept those new part, that&#39;s the best you&#39;ll ever get.&quot; She didn&#39;t recognize the handwriting.<br />
<br />
Opening the bag, she saw an ugly ass, boobs she doubted ever belonged to a woman and, worst of all, boys parts. She slowly walked backwards, not daring to leave her eyes off those horrors, slowly saying &quot;No… no…&quot; but the offending bodyparts jumped on Jennifer attaching themselves, turning her into a geeky looking overweight teenage boy.<br />
<br />
Again, Jonathan ended up in a tight ball, crying for his now nonexistent social life.</p>
