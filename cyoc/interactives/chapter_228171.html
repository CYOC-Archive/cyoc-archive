<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay, Mark.  Who would you like to see transformed next?&quot;, Madame Illusia asked.  &quot;I&#39;d like to save the best for last and my house is a complete wreak.  I really could use that robot maid to do all that work.&quot;, Mark replied.  &quot;How about I do one better for you, Mark?  How about a computer that runs the entire house and controls devices that are either directly wired to it or wirelessly connected to it?&quot;, Madame Illusia countered.  &quot;Oh, that would be great!  I wouldn&#39;t have to a thing anymore and Marry Anne would be able to multitask.&quot;, Mark said excitedly.  &quot;That&#39;s true.  Watch and be amazed!&quot;, Madame Illusia said with a smile.  Marry Anne, still frozen, grew in size and weight as her entire body shifted into an aluminum box shape.  Her eyes shrank to become small webcams surrounded by a small plastic ring.  Her nose disappeared while her mouth turned widened changed from red flesh to a black fabric foam.  her voice box moved behind her fabric foam mouth and turned into an  electromagnet that buzzed and played audio when it struck the speaker cone.  Her brain flattened out and separated into different pieces such as blades of motherboards, multiple sticks of ram, multiple CPUs, a few of the latest and fastest GPU cards, and multiple NVME drives.  Her butt had become a power supply unit, a thick black tail snaking its way out of it to become a power cord.  After the power supply had been formed, what was left of Marry Anne&#39;s nerves became a jumble of wires going everywhere inside her.  Since she no longer needed her heart, her entire circulatory system simply converted itself over to become even more wires so that different parts of her could communicate with each other.  Both on her front and back, different ports made themselves known, USB 3, HDMI, and even legacy ports such as VGA and PS2 ports.  All around her several things were appearing, items such as tablets, Raspberry Pis, a couple of fridges, a fancy high end washing machine, monitors, a keyboard and mouse, a couple of wireless game controllers that could be used for more than just games, monitors, sensors for various things like break-in detection alarms, health care products and even a few robot vacuums.  In the front of the computer where Marry Anne&#39;s womb used to be, a windowed door appeared much like you&#39;d find on a modern clothes dryer and opened on its own.  &quot;Morgan!&quot;, said Madame Illusia, It&#39;s time for you to go to your new home.&quot;  Morgan visibly started shaking in fear afraid of what would happen next as her clothes disappeared off of her leaving her a bare as the day she was born.  All of her hair completely disappeared, even on her head as a new very fine hair called lanugo started to grow all over her body. &quot;Mommy....I&#39;m scared.&quot;, she said.  &quot;I know baby, but do as your told, it will be easier for you and mommy will help you when she can.&quot;, Margot comforted.  However, Margot knew t hat there would be no getting Morgan out of her predicament.  She was lucky that her daughter&#39;s life was spared in the first place.  However, a well placed white lie at the right time could comfort a small child during difficult times.  At first, Morgan felt sick as really bad cramps formed in her stomach.  But, very quickly squatted up on stage and helplessly messed her legs and the stage with her own diarrhea.  She kept it up again and again until only water flowed from her back side.  Madame, using her magic, cleaned the small child and the mess on the floor.  &quot;Sorry, child, we have to clean you out first for your own safety.&quot;  However, Madame Illuisa&#39;s words did nothing to calm the child, but only frightened her even more.  &quot;I promise you, baby, everything&#39;s going to be okay.  Please just do what the woman says for me.  Can you do that?  I promise it&#39;s all going to be over soon.  I love you, baby girl, and I&#39;ll be with you every step of the way.  I promise!&quot;, Margot said trying to calm Morgan&#39;s fears again.  Swiftly and quickly, a fleshy looking translucent balloon like thing formed above Morgan&#39;s head and forced itself down on her trapping her inside it and sealing itself up.  Being trapped inside, all Morgan could do was press against the balloon, but she could not escape.  Margot could hear the screams and crying of her poor girl, but being stuck frozen against her will, she couldn&#39;t help her in any way.  She was just happy to know that the balloon still held enough air for Morgan to breath.  Morgan watched as a clear tube with smaller tubes snaked its way out of the wall of the balloon somehow and slowly crept up to her belly button frightening the child causing her to wet herself.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, her urine is just part of what will make up her amniotic fluid.  It won&#39;t matter soon.&quot;, stated Madame.  The balloon floated into the door of the computer that used to be Marry Anne as the door closed shut and transformed into nothing more than a round window completely sealing the balloon and the girl inside it for life.  The balloon then started to attach itself to the top of the computer&#39;s womb by creating a strong bond using what appeared to be a huge quantity of fleshy looking silicone glue.  the computer&#39;s womb started to fill up with blood as a few beeping sounds came from the computer&#39;s speaker.  Once the computer&#39;s womb was filled with blood, the balloon started to fill up with amniotic fluid as air escaped.  The balloon shrank a bit causing Morgan to reposition herself into the fetal position.  Morgan had trouble breathing at first and thought she was going to die, but eventually, she just continued breathing as amniotic fluid filled her lungs and carbon dioxide departed.  Once all the air in her lungs was out, she was purely breathing in and out amniotic fluid.  She felt as a thick oily substance form over her skin sticking to her fine body hair, though she didn&#39;t know that she needed that to protect her skin from the amniotic fluid.  She continued to struggle to get free for a while before finally getting sleepy from her fighting her ordeal and fell asleep.  As she slept, a dim red light came on and would stay on for the rest of her life.  Madame then magically started to program the computer.<br />

The computer that was Mary Anne, spoke, &quot;I am Merry Onn.  Your personal household organizer.  How can I assist you today?&quot;  The Merry Onn had no idea that the ages of its former siblings had been entered wrong in any way.  It just accepted what was programmed into it.  All it knew was that it had a 5 month old fetus in its artificial womb, a six month old baby to shop for, a male named Mark of some age to serve and a female named It of some age to serve.  With a swoosh of her wrist, Madame Illusia sent the computer and its occupant, and all accompanying bells and whistles that came with it away to their new place of residence.  Upon making it to the new residence, the computer integrated its circuits with the house and and all of the devices it was compatible with and was ready to be used.  Madame Illusia turned back to Mark and asked, &quot;Are you ready to finish the job?&quot;  Mark replied, &quot;Yes!&quot;.  Okay, then, I&#39;ve decided that your wife&#39;s name should be It.  I think it&#39;s a better name for a slut whose personality you can change at will, right?&quot;  Mark agreed.  &quot;Can she have DD breasts, be age eighteen, and lactate to the point she has to wear nursing pads or leak breast milk all the time?&quot;, Mark asked.  &quot;If that&#39;s what you want, Mark&quot;, replied Madame Illusia.  I also want the strong body muscular body I had back when I was twenty one, is that possible?&quot;, Mark asked.  &quot;Yup!&quot;, was all Madame said after that.  She truly meant every word she said.  She was grateful to Mark to allow her to mess up his family the way she did.  In her eyes, he deserved the best she could give him.</p>
