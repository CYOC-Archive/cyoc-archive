<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The other girls ran away once they were told to go get the practice harness. Nicky grabbed Jen by the antler and yanked her down so that Jen was on her hands and knees, and then Nicky walked over to a desk and picked up a couple of measuring tools and a clip board. She told Jen that because she did not get her records in time she had to guess on her sizes. Jen started to tell her that her shirt size was a med, Nicky interrupted mid sentence and told her that he was not talking about her other sizes. As she walked past she poked one of Jens antlers. It took Jen a minute to realize that she was talking about her antler size. Then Jen reached up and grabbed her antlers they were now about four to five in long. Nicky told Jen that they may get a little longer but they were almost completely grown in for the year.<br />
Before Jen could ask Nicky another question the other girls returned with three boxes. They told Jen that these two boxes on bottom are Jens formal harness and to try it on when she gets home but keep it together then report back tomorrow if everything fits alright.<br />
Then the top one was her practice harness that she now had to wear for the rest of the month. She wondered what made the formal harness need two boxes when the practice harness got one box<br />
The girls started to take it out piece by piece then one of the girls said “I found the head piece” they walked up to Jen and quickly pulled the head piece around Jen. She heard a click behind her head and then a chain that they pulled from the back of the head piece and clamped it on her antlers.<br />
The girls backed away for a second to see if it fit right. It felt really weird to have something on jen's antlers and without even thinking her first reaction was to shack it off. They looked at it and noticed that bit was not in her mouth; one girl walked in front of jen and told her to open. Jen looked at her with sad eyes. The girl asked why she has to be such a diva about this. We should already be done but because she is being so stubborn it has taken a long time. Jen feeling really loathed she opened her mouth and the girl slid the bit in to her mouth. She stood up and the next girl told her to lift her arms up. Jen did and she slid what looked like red latex suspenders with shiny green sleeves. As it was slipped over her to other girls helped her get her arms through the sleeves they then took off her bra so that her breasts were free then one of the girls that finished with getting Jen’s arms through the sleeves started working on attaching a piece of latex that covered her breasts and seemed to mold around them like a tight shirt. Hearing a couple more clicks the three girls that were strapping her in backed away to see if it looked good. Jen started to inspect it herself other than her breast strap being more reviling then she would have liked she thought that it looked kind of good in a kinky kind of way. Then she looked at her arms and hands, the latex ran up to her shoulder’s and went all the way down to a hole for her thumbs. Then something caught her eye on her breast strap that she must have missed before. She looked at it and it said “Jen” right across the front of them. <br />
Then before she was ready the started to work on her lower half, they grabbed a red latex skirt and told her to step in to it. She did as she was told not wanting to what else they can do to her. They pulled it all the way up her legs and then she felt them grab her tail and painfully pull it down so that they could get the buckle clipped shut around her tale and she assumed because they really hate her. They then pulled out some high heels that looked like reindeer hoofs forcing her to sit down they strapped her feet in to the heels. They were weird because there was a spot for her big and the second toe then a barrier and the rest of her toes fit in the other side. Jen noticed that as she stood up they were really comfortable.<br />
Thinking that they were done she tried to walk over to Nicky who was looking at Jen then writing something on her clipboard. As Jen started to walk over to her to ask if she can go the girls grabbed her and told her that now they had to make sure that the outfit was up to what Mr. ssssaann she then cleared her throat and said Kyle ‘s specifications for his head reindeer.<br />
After a couple of rounds of pull straps and make sure they are tight enough and then adjusting them. Finally she was done. She walked over to Nicky who lowered her clipboard to her legs and asked what she needed, jenny tried to tell her if she could take her harness off now but the bit got in her way as she tried to talk and she couldn’t say a word. Nicky reached up and undid her bit. Jen adjusted her jaw because of the weird feeling of something missing in her mouth then spoke “Nicky now that you took the measurements can I take some of this off. <br />
Nicky looked at jen and told her that she could only take off the headgear everything else was stuck tell she has to put on her formal harness. After she took off Jen’s head gear Jen sighed in relief it felt so weird to have something around her antlers so she was happy for the nice reprieve of having it off.<br />
Nicky told her that she is not required to wear the headgear until sleigh practice. But she can decide when to wear it other than then. Then Nicky looked at her watch and told her that her last class was over and she could now go to lunch now.</p>
