<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I&#39;ve been writing this for half a week now with my porn window open and I reached the point of just wanting to finish it. I might add options and edit some rushed sentences at a later date, but this shouldn&#39;t be &quot;utterly unreadable&quot; by any means. Honorary Plush tag.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At 3 o&#39;clock in the morning, Lauren reached the climax of his wet dream and came inside of the condom he wore. The force, as always, awoke him and made got him panting hard before he could think. Lauren had grown accustomed to his unconscious gooning, and without so much as looking at his cock, he rolled the condom off, tied it up, dropped it into his bedside trash can, and rolled another one on. A part of him wanted to try and go asleep again - the timing is perfect for lucid dreaming - but his dick was still hard as a pole. He walked around his room to try and find anything he could do to fully sate his libido.<br />
<br />
The remote popped into his mind when he began looking at his bookshelf. Even though it didn&#39;t do anything, it put him in the mood earlier when he pressed the Enhance button, so maybe something similar could happen? It was a long shot, but he wasn&#39;t in the mood to suck himself off and his electronics would be too bright to use.<br />
He pressed the Enhance button, but wasn&#39;t feeling any different after the click. It was only then that he realized the remote was facing the wrong direction He looked around the room to gage any change, but nothing registered. One of the walls was made a richer shade of blue than the others, but that had been the case before he was even born. Maybe he can charge a little extra on comms to finally repaint it... he&#39;d need to make a note of it though.<br />
<br />
The sticky notes were in the kitchen, and if Lauren was going to leave his room, he might as well take his bedside trash to the bin. He set the remote down on his bed and tied up his condom-filled trash. When he got up, the mega twink could not find the remote he had just sat down. He pressed around his bed for it with his empty hand, before hearing the same click he had heard 4 times already. Some quick bed-sized blanket searching later, and the remote was back in his clutches. As he pulled it out, he heard another click.<br />
Nothing changed of course, but it still spooked him out a bit. He petted the soft polyester that was in his hand, and wrapped his giant teddy bear back around his underarm. It was a nice birthday gift from his best girl-friend Marcy, up until she mentioned &quot;It&#39;s 3 whole feet, from the top of its head to its butt,&quot; and spanked it, making it clear that it was a gag gift/sex toy. It would have been fine, great even, fucking hilarious, if his parents and other friends weren&#39;t there with him. Benjamin and Jane caught on quickly, but were more shocked at someone knowing about Lauren&#39;s dick than him getting a cock warmer for his birthday, and his other friends just thought Marcy was joking around.<br />
The joke&#39;s on Marcy though, because Lamar WAS a good cock warmer, and so much more. It&#39;s a good thing that neither of his parents work from home, otherwise he would have to sneak around his daily washer & dryer usage. Benjamin asked him about his stuffing purchases once or twice, but if they don&#39;t call him out on it, then he won&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s a great thing that they&#39;re out of town then, and he had nighttime washing machine access.<br />
<br />
As Lauren walked down the hall, he looked down at the remote in his hand. Even though he had only used the Random and Enhance buttons, there were so many buttons that he could try. A Merge button was underneath Random, and to the right was Dehance. There were some like Libido and Grab that just had the button, but others had an additional bit next to them like Species w/ a slider on the side, Physical & Mental w/ lights on above them, and Sex with 2 scales from 1-10. On the bottom was &quot;CYO&quot; with numbers and associated letters below, like what you&#39;d find on an old phone.<br />
<br />
Just as Lauren made it to the kitchen and was about the test CYO, he felt a breeze brush past him. The kitchen window was open for some reason. He was pretty sure it was closed when he went to jerk off in the bathroom, but it wasn&#39;t a big deal... probably. Hopefully. Lauren only realized that he pulled his arms close to him when he accidentally clicked on the Merge button towards Lamar. He was pretty sure that was the button he hit when he was looking for it in his room, both times. It had a distinct click, like Random and Enhance did. It was also where his hand naturally gravitated towards. He thought over all of the previous times he held it, and thought himself correct.<br />
No matter how much Lauren tried to distract himself, he couldn&#39;t ignore how cold the kitchen was getting. He slowly walked over to the window over the sink, trying to ignore the smell of mud while also stepping over it. Once he got to the window, he sat Lamar to the side and closed it. This window was always hard to close, that&#39;s why no one ever opened it. It slammed shut, loud enough to where if he was in his room, he would have heard it. Lamar&#39;s soft, brown fur calmed him down some, but it could only do so much against the sound of his heart beating in the silent air. Lauren was perfectly still, couldn&#39;t move.<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
A floorboard creaked. Lauren turned around and saw a pale man over 7 feet tall standing in his parents&#39; room. He looked transfixed on him, below him, before widening his eyes and gasping his mouth. Before he could say anything or shout, Lauren swung out his arm out and gripped down on the remote. The remote was too small to hit him, but as that distinct click rang out through the open space, the idea of hitting anything poured out of his mind.<br />
&quot;Oof! Owwie, my muzzle...&quot; said York, the 5-foot-tall Stuffed Polar Bear, having fell to the floor.<br />
&quot;Huh? Lark... Where do you think you&#39;re going?&quot; said Lauren with a playful smugness he didn&#39;t understand.<br />
&quot;I--I was just going to check the rest of the house! While you were closing the window and... probably... cleaning the... mud?&quot; York, also known as Lark and Lamar, was confused. So much information was bumping through his fuzz-filled mind, feeling stickier by the second.<br />
Lauren walked over and helped his Larky Bear up, standing slightly over him at 5&#39;4&quot;. &quot;There is no mud, Lamar, and that window never gets opened.&quot;<br />
&quot;Muh-My name&#39;s York! No one names ther Theddy Bear &#39;Lamar&#39;! You&#39;re... You&#39;re a... ugh...&quot;<br />
&quot;There there, Cumbrain. Let&#39;s clean you up before you try and think.&quot; said the twink on mental autopilot. He wrapped the Talking Plush in his arms as he carefully yet easily walked back to the washing machine. He have his possession a pat on the butt, eliciting a slow moan from... Lark.<br />
<br />
Originally, his name was York, but after the party Lauren immediately gave him the name Lamar. That pissed him off so much that he jumped up and told &quot;her&quot; off for having shit naming skills. Lauren&#39;s initial shock wore thin, and he began dissociatiating from how unreal the situation was. His dissociation turned to eroticism around the 1.5 minute mark, and York&#39;s yapping slowed to a stop once he saw his owner&#39;s manhood. Lauren immediately went from hot to cold once he noticed his cock pulling down his dress, but went back up to hot when noticed his cock transfixing his annoying bear toy.<br />
The moment York asked to suck it, the two unconventional men with an unconventional relationship became kinky lovers. Under the guise of a girl and her giant-ass teddy bear was a plushophile and his pet cocksucker. Lauren loved having someone who acted manlier than him, but in turn could be shutted up with his criminally underused manhood. Lark, a frequently broken compromise between the two, loved having an owner who he could boss around for hours, but knew to fill him up like a condom when he pushed for it.<br />
What exactly Lark was or where he came from was something even he didn&#39;t know, but observations and experiments did get them results. His tag repeatedly made it clear that he was manufactured in England - his accent was more New England than anything, but that&#39;s what the tag said. Whenever Lauren tried to take the tag off or stitch &quot;modifications&quot; onto him, he&#39;d scream in pain and had to have his muzzle grabbed shut. Even if his &quot;skin&quot; was sensitive, taking his stuffing out of him or getting his insides wet only made him dumber. Between Lauren having to remove some of it to make room for his dick and dumping loads into him, Lark was thoroughly mindfucked everytime they had sex, just as he was now.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s how they both remembered it, and what reality made fact through the remote&#39;s instructions. The soft blanket had merged with a filled condom to become a &quot;polyester bedroom object filled with semen&quot;, or a big teddy bear that Lauren both cuddled with to sleep and emptied his balls into every night. That teddy bear had then merged with a human thief who had decades of life under his belt. It was a tough job for reality; the first generation family of British immigrants was having decades of their life rewritten around the lack of a son and the addition of an animate teddy bear, but by tomorrow nothing would be &quot;weird&quot;.<br />
<br />
As Lark was pushed into his and Lauren&#39;s washing machine, the pressure on his sensitive bottom made him moan with a round O-face. Some of his cumstained cotton began to fall out, and felt himself become even more dopey.<br />
(Oh, what would Dad and...Girl Dad think of me right now? Getting my stuffing filled and stained with yummy salty man juice. Ooohh~~ I&#39;m so hard right now...but I don&#39;t have a dick. That&#39;s what Owner has. Myyy Owner~ such a big dick, all for me. I&#39;m such a Special Bear. Imma Beary Special Bear, a Specially Soft Bear. Being soft is the best, I loo--ove it. I&#39;d hate it if I got hard because of a big dick. It&#39;s a good thing I don&#39;t have one that could get hard while I get cleaned...)<br />
Lauren stared at his plush&#39;s butt with extreme thirst. He really wanted to find a way to stitch him a hole, not just so he can make use of those sewing lessons, but so they can make out when he&#39;s getting plowed. His hard rod was solid steel the more felt up his bear. After he shut the machine and set the time for an hour, he went to the bathroom to jerk off to his imagination, of all he wanted to add on for him.<br />
Lark lost more and more of his mind as he was washed. It was normal for him to lose so much stuffing here - being spun around and having his mouth open. It eventually ended and Lauren put back all of the watery stuffing he lost, and later after the dryer was done, his fluffy stuffing. With the kitchen clock landing at 5 sharp, Lauren went ahead and put back the stuffing they put aside for dick space. It was a good morning to stay up early, albeit one a little plain.</p>
