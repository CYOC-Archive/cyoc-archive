<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer found herself back at the similar looking house she had escaped from. Didn&#39;t she just... The shin sized imp taunted Jennifer with a fingers in a V-sign and passing a tongue between them. It was all just a daydream the little devil had showed her. Behind Jennifer Sylvia came to pat Jennifer&#39;s shoulder but soon was shocked by a black lightining that went inside Sylvia. The brutish and caveman speaking Sylvia looked more elegant and whisked her hair like a well educated woman. The imp had disappeared from Jennifer&#39;s sight and Sylvia was now displaying her long tongue at her tongue as to taunt her previous host for not accepting her help. On top of the tongue formed a pentagram tattoo that glimmered in orange, red and black lights. Sylvia coughed and sounded more elegant as she run her tongue all over her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I beg you pardon miss Jennifer. Sadly your mother&#39;s dimwit nature was easier to overthrow than you hard head noggin. I do wonder why you keep insisting on struggling... Give up already!&quot; Sylvia spoke to Jennifer like a different person. &quot;Give! Up! Despair! Give! Up! Be prepared!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly Sylvia switched back to her dumb expression and sounded more dull and dumb, &quot;Huh? Jen? Jen stare. Jen okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen okay... no worry.&quot; Jennifer replied back as she still sounded like a brute like her mother but had kept her intellect somehow still intact.<br />
<br />
The electric jolt that Jennfier felt was back at her head. The mischievous cock hungry pixie was messing up with Jennifer&#39;s brain. She was now perceiving things as they shouldn&#39;t be and all her naps were turning into fewer dreams. The steady ground was crumbling under her as she had to know exactly which was real and which was not.<br />
<br />
Mary walked outside her cum and piss den as she looked as bad as Sylvia. Darkened eyes telling more than they should have about the current state. Mary explained that she had the weirdest dream ever and couldn&#39;t tell if she just had a heavy hangover or did police really raid their home. Mary was getting paranoid as she knew that if someone knew about their situation it would mean end for her and her life.<br />
<br />
&quot;God dammit dad! Why did you have to mess me so...&quot; Mary weeped as held her head on the table.<br />
<br />
Was this another vision what the imp was showing her or was Mary truly saying these things. Sylvia acted like this was normal and didn&#39;t say or do anything. She went to pick-up Lukas from the bathroom and went to sit next to her mother still offering the tit to the four year old. Jennifer was amazed that her mother was somehow lactating and had kept Lukas fed all these years. Was that a new addition to their family. Jennifer didn&#39;t know anymore. Too many changes to keep track at this point. Her mind was a smoothie that had occasional chunky bits in it. No more memories what was right and was wrong. Mary and Jennifer shared the same headspace while Sylvia and Jennfier shared the actions. Mary opened a new can of beer to ease the hangover headache.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhmm.. Sylphie? Sylvi? or was it Sylvia...? Anyway.&quot; Mary asked while taking sips from the can. &quot;I know I&#39;ve neglected your daughter&#39;s homeschooling the day you had Lukas but how many months does Jenni had the belly? Show me with fingers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sylvia begun to show 1-2-3-4 and 5. Then slowing at ninth, then counting the tenth finger and putting two fingers more while only showing two fingers to her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddammit...&quot; Mary slammed her hand to the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenni, show me you belly.&quot; Mary asked as she put her ear on top of Jennifer&#39;s massive reddish gut. &quot;Well, it&#39;s still there and living... Usually these things should take nine months to come out crawling but that thing has been there for quite a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary went back to the kitchen table to continue sipping her beer as Jennifer was near at panic levels. She was twelve months in her pregnancy!? How!? She looked on the ground at the side and saw the shin height plastic toy sized fairy giggling and rolling on it&#39;s back on the floor while pointing her finger at Jennifer. Pantomiming with her hands the gymball sized belly and walking side to side as if it was struggling.<br />
<br />
Jennifer had enough and smacked the thing with her fist. It made an audible bang and the fairy was caressing Jennifer&#39;s fist as if it had dodged the attack like a ninja. Jennifer could only sit on the floor and while Mary looked at her grand daughters antics the four year old Lukas had already emptied Sylvia&#39;s both tits out of it&#39;s milk contents. Lukas was living like a king as her mother kept cuddling her. Mary in other hand told everyone that she had to go to back to bed as the headache was getting worse. Jennifer also felt tired from the constant shock therapy she was receiving. Hoping to catch better Z&#39;s the next time she went to the bed or in this case the bird&#39;s nest of piss and fem-cum stained smut mags she was still sitting at. Hallucinations, sharing dreams, massive preggo belly restricting her freedom and many more... It was like the end times were near.</p>
