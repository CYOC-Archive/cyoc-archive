<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Having lived right outside of your city’s “China Town”, you always passed through there, looking at all the odd and various wares for sale. 
You never stopped in any of the stores, being that you couldn’t read what any of them were simply because everything was written in Chinese 
symbols. There had been a few times you thought about going into the stores to see what they were or what they had for sale, but you could 
never bring yourself to do it. Now… you felt that there really wasn’t all that much choice. Normally, every weekend you would create a list of 
the things that you needed before you went into work so you could go shopping on your way home in a market that suited your tastes, where 
you knew what you were getting yourself into.  Unfortunately, this was not the case this weekend.</Br>
<Br>On this particular Friday, you woke up later than usual and only had enough time to get to work on time. During the work day, you jotted 
down everything that you knew you were out of, but knew that you were also forgetting something. You couldn’t place your finger on what it 
was exactly, but you knew it was something that was pretty important. After getting all your items from the store, you took the subway to the 
nearest station to your place, which was just outside of the “China Town” and once you got inside, you unpacked everything and put all of the 
items where they needed to be. That was when it hit you, you were in the bathroom putting away some of the toiletry items you remembered 
you were low on, when you saw what you thought was the next to empty stick of deodorant sitting on your bathroom counter you left there 
because of being in a hurry. Picking up the deodorant, you realize that you had used the rest of it this morning right before you got dressed for 
work. Annoyed that you were out and not wanting to be without, you begin cursing at yourself under your breath. You didn’t want to go all the 
way back to your regular market because it was getting late, you were tired from a long day at work and it would mean that you would have to 
waste a few extra bucks for your round trip ticket on the subway. Even though it wasn’t a lot, it was more money than you were willing to 
spend when you needed it for other things.</Br>
<Br>Frustrated with yourself, you moved into the living room and sat on the sofa to think for a moment. As you sat there, an idea popped into 
your head, but you knew that it was a gamble to act on what you were thinking. You knew that there were plenty of Asian markets around and 
there was more than likely some deodorant for sale at one of them. You knew it really was a long shot, but you also knew that something was a 
lot better than having nothing at all.</Br>
<Br>Having decided that you were going to see if you could get some deodorant, your grab your wallet you left on the bookcase by the main 
door on your way out. As you walked down the hallway, you thought to yourself <Em>Well… this does give me an excuse to check out some of 
the Asian stores like I have been curious to check out!</Em> and as your thought trails off, you smile slightly knowing that you were logic was 
pretty sound.</Br>
<Br>Once you were outside on the sidewalk, it didn’t take long for you to get to “China Town” since it was literally a couple minutes walk from 
the front door of your unit’s main entrance. Slowly you walked along the sidewalk, checking out the various stores along the way, peeping 
inside with just your eyes. As you check things out and scan everything with your eyes, some of the Asian people both on the street and in the 
stores looked at you funny, not sure of what exactly you were up to. After walking for a few more minutes, your eyes spot some items right in 
the main window that gave you hope that the store was a general market. </Br>
<Br>Immediately when you walked in the front door, the store’s owner watched your every move, thinking you were in there to cause 
problems. You felt uneasy about being in there, but you needed any deodorant, regardless of what kind it was and that was all you were there 
for. Walking though the long aisles, you saw that the majority of the items there were all in Chinese, which you were slightly deflated from, 
wondering how you were supposed to figure out what you were looking at. As you got toward the back of the store, you spotted something 
written in English at the end of the aisle. Making your way there quickly, you noticed that it was a long and somewhat wide rectangular box 
with the word “Phoenix” written on the front. Curious about what this product was, you flipped the box over and read the description, which 
read:</Br>
<Br><Em>Phoenix: A new brand of deodorant created for men who want to try something new; who want a product that keeps their manliness 
in check and not have them smelling like a girl. Phoenix has been formulated to last for the entire day with one application under each arm. 
This deodorant is guaranteed by the manufacturer to make you feel like a new man, while bringing everything out of yourself that you may or 
may not know that you can be. Everyone that has worn this product in the past has sent us letters thanking us for making this product, since 
everyone has been satisfied with the results. All you have to do is put the deodorant on under each arm and let Phoenix do the rest of the work 
for you!</Em></Br>
<Br>After reading the lengthy description on the box, you decide to give it a go, thinking that there was nothing that you could lose out of 
purchasing it. The worst thing that could happen, you thought, would be the product simply not living up to expectations. As you made your 
way to the front counter, the old Chinese man spotted you coming with your wallet in hand. Pleased that you didn’t live up to what he was 
assuming, he smiled at you, then looked down at what you placed on the counter.</Br>
<Br>“Oh…  you gonna like that very much! It’s a very good product… many customers very happy with results!” He says with a big grin.</Br>
<Br>“Really, what kind of results did they all have?” You ask with a perkiness to your voice now.</Br>
<Br>”Oh… they all come back different… but always happy.” He says plainly.</Br>
<Br>“Good to know then, thank you sir!” You say as he hands you the receipt and you walk out of the store, heading home.</Br>
<Br>Eager to get home and try out your purchase, you notice that there was a bit of pep in your step, getting you home quicker than when you 
left to find the very thing you had in your hand. Almost running up the three flights of stairs to the landing with your apartment door, you pull 
out your key ring and fumble through the various keys. As you started opening the door to your apartment, one of your neighbors that needed 
to get past you to get to their place noticed what you had in your hand. He was a giant of a man, packed with muscle that could have been 
mistaken for mountains. Curious why you purchased it, the man stands there and waits for you to notice him. As you fiddle and fumble with 
the keys, just about to get the right one into your padlock, you end up dropping the keys. As you bend down to reclaim it, you notice that your 
neighbor was standing there silently.</Br>
<Br>“Oh, hello there!” You say with enthusiasm, unsure of why he was standing there or for how long.</Br>
<Br>“Hello to you! I couldn’t help noticing that you picked up some Phoenix Deodorant from Mr. Yuan.” He says plainly.</Br>
<Br>“Yes, yes I did. Why do you ask… is there something wrong with the product or what?” You ask, wondering why the man brought it up in 
the first place. </Br>
<Br>“Oh… please don’t take offense… I bought the stuff a long time ago and it did wonders for me. In fact, it made me into the man you see 
before you.” He said posing while a huge smile was plastered on his face.</Br>
<Br>“Really… it turned you into the muscle Adonis that you are now? How is that even possible?” You say, unbelievingly.</Br>
<Br> “To be completely honest, I couldn’t even begin to explain it to you because I really don’t know myself. I just know that before I put it on, 
I was a skinny little twerp… then after I put it on, I grew into what you see before you. That is as much as I can tell you because that is as much 
as I know.” He says, even though he was withholding a little bit more information because he wasn’t sure if it was something that happened to 
everyone or if it was with him.</Br>
<Br>“Well, thank you for the information sir. I will have to try this stuff on and see what happens after.” You say as you open the door and start 
stepping into your unit as he still stands there.</Br>
<Br>Before you have a chance to shut the door all the way, the neighbor sticks his foot in between the door and the sill, still seemingly as if he 
still had something to say. “Sorry to keep you even longer, but I was wondering something. Would you mind if I stayed and watched you for a 
while after you put the deodorant on? I know it is an oddball request, but Mr. Yuan told me that this stuff changes people in different ways 
depending on their genetic makeup or something. So, I am really curious to see if something different happens to you.” He said, while trying 
not to seem like a total weirdo.</Br>
<Br> “Yeah… sure, I guess. Mr Yuan told me the same thing when I bought the stuff and I thought he was kidding. Although, tonight if I do 
change into someone or something else, that would be quite interesting.” You say nonchalantly as you let him into your apartment.</Br>
<Br>Not wanting to waste anytime, you take off both of your shirts and throw the deodorant on under your arms. Just like with any deodorant, 
you felt the deodorant go on smoothly, coating the skin and hair in your pits. You just look at your neighbor, feeling a little weird about sitting 
there with your shirt off while he waited to see results from putting on the deodorant. Not sure of what was supposed to happen next, you 
scratch your head and focus your attention on him.</Br>
<Br>“Um… so what exactly is supposed to happen after putting this stuff on?” You ask plainly.</Br>
<Br>“Well… you are supposed to undergo a change of some kind. There is no telling what it could be because it is supposed to be different 
with every person. In fact, you are the only other person that I know of who bought this deodorant. I don’t know and haven’t heard of anyone 
else getting this stuff or even trying it. I tried looking the brand up on the Internet, but nothing came up other than the website of the company 
that made the stuff. The thing is, all they did there was talk about the product and up sell it. There were no details or testimonials about the 
Phoenix Deodorant, so there is only what I know and what we will learn shortly.” He explained in a single breath, remembering to breath finally.
</Br>
<Br> “Ok… so how long did it take before you felt something?” You asked with a curious tone in your voice.</Br>
<Br> “Honestly, it wasn’t long after… probably about five minutes or so. With what happened to me, after five minutes my armpits itched. That 
itching spread all over my body, then I started feeling sore, then poof… I was how you see me now.” He explained, still keeping something 
from you, not sure about how you would react if he told you the full and honest story.</Br>
<Br>“Well then… I guess we have another three and a half minutes to go before we see what happens.” You say, knowing that whatever 
happened would be interesting to say the least. If nothing happens, then life goes on how I know it to go and I would still find out something 
interesting… that it doesn’t actually do a thing.</Br>
<Br>Slowly, as if you were watching and waiting for water to boil, the first five minutes were up and like clockwork, your armpits begin 
itching… the only question was… now what?</Br></p>
