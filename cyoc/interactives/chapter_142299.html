<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John had originally planned to take it slow, and only modify things that were getting in the way of their relationship. However, that&#39;s before he had 8 inches of pressure pushing against his zipper. Though the reality alteration &quot;modified&quot; his clothing to accommodate the changes, a boner stuck in pants was painful no matter how you slant it. He was sure it wouldn&#39;t take much convincing as it was to get Sharon to climb up on top of it, but he wanted to go mad with the power that the Chronivac had provided him. Just a little.<br />
<br />
Something that had annoyed him when Sharon had been talking was her hesitance to use anything but the clinical terms for body parts. He always wanted to know what a woman was like that had as colorful a vocabulary about sex as a man did. So with a few clicks, he started by delving into her vocabulary bank, then found the category for sexual terms. While she had a few kicking around that surprised him, they were low on the prioritization list. Under the row for &#39;Breast&#39; he added several new ones, all designated higher than the term &#39;breast.&#39; She would rarely refer to them as such now. He repeated the same process for her vagina. Before pulling out of this category, he decided to have a little fun with the penis category too. He snickered as he entered one relatively high on the list. He would have trouble keeping a straight face when she used that one. For these changes, reality would be altered. He discovered a + symbol next to the option, and found an area where he could define in more specific detail the changes to be made to the reality. &#39;%Subject% has not talked like this before, however any person who isn&#39;t %currentuser% will react no differently to her usage of the terminology than if she were speaking normally.&#39; This would be more interesting if they left the house. He didn&#39;t want to go through the trouble of reverting these changes later, but he didn&#39;t want her to have always talked that way. This way, nobody would think any differently of her shift in speech pattern.<br />
<br />
Next, he decided to place some parameters on her body. Hearing her wishes directly, he decided to make Sharon&#39;s tits balloon in size. However, he didn&#39;t want her to notice until the process was complete. So he decided to write a few rules governing the changes.<br />
<br />
While Sharon was watching anime with John, she would slowly start to rub her pussy without realizing. Under no circumstances would she realize what she was doing, or want to stop until her boobs reached their maximum at an F-cup. She also wouldn&#39;t notice John watching her activities. For every orgasm she achieved, her breasts would grow by one cup. Until then, she would act mostly normal, showing minimum signs of her activity while inexplicably feeling the effects. Once she achieved her maximum, she will try once to intentionally force herself to reach climax, but fail and become rabidly horny.<br />
<br />
Next, he decided to have some fun with her vaginal parameters. By just a *hair*, he increased her tightness. He didn&#39;t want to tear anything with his additional length, but he wanted to punish her for the comment she made (before her reality changed, that is). He increased the slider for moisture, and greatly increased it for &#39;Squirting amount&#39;. He removed the presence of all pubic hair. Finally, he made it much more likely for her to squirt from an intercourse-induced orgasm. That way she wasn&#39;t supersoaking the entire living room.<br />
<br />
As he was finalizing the changes, he had one last clever idea. He modified her posture settings so that when she sat on the couch, she would always casually spread her legs. The thought turned John on, because even when she was trying to be sexy and coy, she would cross her legs and taunt him with access. This way, he could have full viewing pleasure of her transformation. He set a delay on his changes by 2 minutes, and hit Apply. The progress bar on the screen took a little longer than last time, but it applied quick enough. He quickly rummaged through the fridge and returned to his girlfriend with drinks.<br />
<br />
For her part, she was enraptured by the anime. He could tell it was the next episode already, and her eyes hadn&#39;t left the screen. She subconsciously grabbed the drink without looking as he sat down near her on the couch. He wanted to be all up in her business while she began, but he likely couldn&#39;t control himself and would interrupt the process that was about to begin.<br />
<br />
As the episode ended, Sharon had a bit more attention to pay to John. He asked, &quot;So, what do you think? Still enjoy it after more than window shopping?&quot; She blushed, &quot;Y-yeah. Though it&#39;s silly to imagine cows with such huge tits would be capable of doing much more than fuck and suck meatus.&quot; THERE IT WAS. HE DIDN&#39;T EXPECT TO HEAR THE WORD SO SOON OR SO CASUALLY. John nearly died. Luckily the intro to the next episode started and Sharon was humming along. She loosened her posture, and spread her legs across the couch as if it was normal. The episode began to get into the plot, and so did Sharon. The fingers on her right hand slowly crept down to her pants and undid her button, slightly unzipping her fly and gaining access. John watched as they snuck underneath her panties, and began circling around her mound. The moisture was already beginning to soak the material of the panties, even though she had just started. With her left hand, she took a swig of the soda he brought back and let out a small burp. Were this an anime, his boner would have its own aura of intensity at this very moment. But he had to show restraint until the changes were complete.<br />
<br />
Around the midway point of the episode, he noticed the fingers on her left hand curl as the tempo underneath her panties suddenly decreased. Her chest swelled to a C-cup, exactly as planned. As it finished its expansion, her stroking session resumed its previous pace. The next orgasm was much quicker, and a small moan escaped Sharon&#39;s lips. Her tits swelled even further. Compared to earlier, they were massive now. It was harder than ever for John to resist fucking her then and there.<br />
<br />
The cycle continued, until she reached the promised land. And even then, it took her a few moments to realize anything was amiss. It took her crossing her arms to realize the additional width that her boobs had acquired. &quot;Wha...? But....how? And...when?&quot; She nearly tore off her shirt to get a better look, and her tits obliged by bouncing out merrily. Her skin was flustered and red, and he could tell she was more than ready to try out her new assets. But he was enjoying watching the emotion on her face while she discovered every inch of these new assets. She reacted very strongly to the changes, in ways that John hadn&#39;t anticipated. She began massaging her breasts, then attempting--and succeeding--to lick her own nipples. She played around with the tips with her tongue, and he could tell her pants were an aquarium at this point. So he did what any logical man would do, and decided to whip out his meatus.</p>
