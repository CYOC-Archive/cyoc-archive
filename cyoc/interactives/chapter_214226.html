<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lindsay closed her travel bag and stepped out of the stall, making sure to close the door behind her as she headed toward the pickup truck parked nearby.<br />
<br />
“So how is Sunspot doing?” asked one of the animal handlers as he led a horse by the reigns back toward the barn. <br />
<br />
“Overall good Mike, I think we are still a few weeks out from when she will give birth.” Said Lindsay as she placed her veterinary bag down on the tailgate. Before sitting down on the tailgate to switch from her knee-high boots to just a pair of regular work boots. “Any other mares I need to look at?”<br />
<br />
“None come to mind.” Answered Mike as the sound of a horn filled the air followed by cheers. <br />
<br />
“Another stupid race.” Stated Lindsay as she took off her baseball cap and whipped away the sweet from her forehead as she looked at the horse track and small stadium nearby. A group of horses with jockeys on their backs where already a quarter the way down the track heading into the 1st turn as the announcer was calling out who was in the lead. “I wonder how many people are going to lose money today.”<br />
<br />
“It’s Vegas, so a lot.” Answered Mike as he took the horse back toward its pen. For a moment Lindsay just sat there wondering why she was there. She had gone to school to help animals, mostly horses and she was but still when she graduated from Veterinary school, she didn’t expect to end up working on a horse breeding farm/racetrack in Vegas. Still the money was good, and she was getting a lot more experience and she had to admit being just shy of 30 single and in Vegas was a lot of fun on its own. <br />
<br />
She had just finished putting away her gear and was about to get into her truck to drive back to her office to fill out some paperwork when suddenly a wave of energy washed over her and everyone else.<br />
<br />
Lindsay stopped in her tracks and looked around, everyone seamed to be doing the same. Even the announcer calling out the horse race seamed to pause. The jockeys seamed to realize something was up as they seamed to stop racing and come to a stop. <br />
<br />
Then everything began to change, the stadium bleachers where those gambling began to change, turning from concrete to something made out stone and wood. The barn houses where the horses where kept stayed wood but almost seamed that the wood was still alive, with flowers growing from the planks. The dirt race track became a lush field of grass and right in the center of the track a massive tree taller then any of the buildings began to grow. It was a rainbow of colors with multi color leaves with what looked to be glowing crystals hanging from multiple branches with a single massive crystal floating above it.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” said Lindsay as suddenly she noticed her truck had become a horse drawn wagon only without a horse. <br />
<br />
Then she began to change.<br />
<br />
Her polo work shirt with the logo of the racetrack began to change. It traveled down her body leaving her sleeveless and her shoulders bare as it became a sort of brown leather corset. A corset made for a women who clearly had a larger chest. Then she noticed that she could feel the bare earth, she looked down to see not only had her shoes disappeared but so had her jeans and underwear. She screamed and she wasn’t alone as she went to cover herself. <br />
<br />
As she attempted that, to her horror two more limbs began to grow out of her hips, another set of legs. However these where not human legs but something she knew all too well. <br />
<br />
A pair of horse legs, she screamed in pain for a moment before her body became awash in pleasure as her new legs pushed forward while her ass pushed back. For a moment she had hairless horse legs in the front and a pair of human legs in the back. However, her back legs began to shift as well become horse legs as well, as her body mass increased so that her lower body was now the same as a fully adult mare horse. <br />
<br />
Then her upper body began to change, growing bigger so that it would better fit with her lower body. Her bust exploded outwards as her skin became smoother and if she had seen herself in a mirror, she would say she looked sexier than she ever had been. Her blonde hair which she normally kept tied back in a ponytail at work, fell over her shoulders in flowing locks before going down to the small of her back, the point where her human body meet her new horse body. A reddish auburn brown fur grew over her lower body aside from the black hooves which now touched the ground. Lastly a blonde tail the same color as her hair grew out of her ass and with that she was done.<br />
<br />
“My God…I am a Centaur.” said Lindsay as she looked around, she wasn’t alone all around her everyone had changed.</p>
