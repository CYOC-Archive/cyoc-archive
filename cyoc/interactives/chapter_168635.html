<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It didn&#39;t take long before Kylie had become horny enough for her pussy to start lubricating itself in preparation for sex. And while John&#39;s tongue felt nice and all, she was actually getting more aroused from playing with his cock while using her forked tongue. She just found it enjoyable, knowing that it was because of her efforts that John was able to get this hard. As she continued to pleasure him with her mouth, she was quickly building up a desire to get past the foreplay already. <br />
<br />
John was also getting eager to get to the actual sex. Not that he didn&#39;t like eating her out, and Kylie tasted great too. But her tongue skills were way too strong, and he didn&#39;t want to cum before she even let him get inside of her pussy. But John suddenly realized just how he could fix that. It was so simple. Just swap her mouth and pussy! That way he can continue getting worked on by her forked tongue, while also fucking her. And he could even kiss her at the same time. Already sold oj the idea, he made the change, making it so that she knew that it was a new chamge, but also not care enough about it to stop having sex.<br />
<br />
Kylie suddenly felt her mouth and pussy become tingly as she found that John&#39;s tongue was somehow inside of her mouth now. Slightly curious, she looked up at the mirror on her makeup desk only to see her face, along with her pussy where her mouth use to be, AND her tongue still wrapped tightly around John&#39;s cock staring back at her. It was a shock to be sure, but Kylie also became even more turned on at the idea of John face fucking her while she still was able to taste this incredibly delicious cock. Why was John&#39;s cock even allowed to taste this good? She wondered to herself, not that she was complaining though. <br />
<br />
Finally Kylie couldn&#39;t wait any longer and forced John to reposition himself. Now he was kneeling on the bed, with her on all fours, head hight equal to his cock as she slid it into her pussy, all while using her tongue to massage his balls. His sweat, smell, hell even his precum all were amazing to her every sense. She just couldn&#39;t get enough of him. It turned her on so much it apparently caused her tits to start drizzling her excessive breast milk, something definitely knew she had plenty of. <br />
<br />
As the bed was getting soaked with milk, yet another change was taking place, though this time it wouldn&#39;t be noticed until after they finished having sex and left the house. The world had changed greatly. All women were now either tools used for society&#39;s improvement, or a mate to a male of their choosing. Bondage was considered as casual as missionary now. And just about everyone was somewhat into it. Safe sex classes even taught students how to properly tie knotts, maintain leather equipment, etc. <br />
<br />
It also was not uncommon for women to have their body augmented somehow to fufil a purpose. Whether that was replacing their hands and feet with a set of wheels to be a bike for someone, or having an electrical wiring system installed into their body, with light sockets where their nipples once were so that they could be a lamp, or even be given the ability to lay delicious eggs and be milked like a cow, everyone felt that it was just them doing their part.<br />
<br />
Kylie was not unaffected by this either. Her tits were now officially augmented udders (though just in function not appearance), rapidly producing large quantities of milk, which she could either sell or keep for her family to use. The other augment she had was her extensive maid training. Along with permanently fixed ankles, fused with a special, genetically made bone. This new bone forces her foot to be shaped in such a way that it would be as if she permanently was wearing 5 inch high heels at all times. In addition, John had made her completely unaware of these changes until she left the house, even though they they already had been applied to her, noticing her heels now had a 5 inch, thin protrusion sticking out of it, and that all of her toes were now fused together on the bottom, where animal-like pads had also formed (but not on the heel bone so she still makes the clacking sound as she walks). This heel augmentation was required by all women too once the became 16 years old.</p>
