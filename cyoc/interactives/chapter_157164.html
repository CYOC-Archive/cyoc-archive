<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The creepy woman grinned as Dr Jenkins slumped to the floor, clearly in immense pain and discomfort as he gripped his stomach. She knelt down beside him as she examined him; eagerly anticipating the man’s impending transformation.<br />
<br />
“Please … nnngghhh … don’t do this!” Jenkins was struggling to think clearly as pain engulfed his entire body. “I’ve always… been… loyal…. aarrrghhhh!”<br />
<br />
“Oh dearie, I think we both know that’s not true. A little bird told me exactly what you did back in the Stables. Your old boss was one of the few people who really made me feel welcome at the Zoo. She shared the same passion for horses that I have for my beautiful birds…”<br />
<br />
The strange woman seemed to get emotional as she paused. Things didn’t bode well for the distressed doctor, judging by her fondness for the former Stablewoman.<br />
<br />
“But you put an end to that, didn’t you!” The rage in the woman’s eyes was clear to see despite maintaining her calm and sinister tone. “My best friend is now stuck as a dumb horse for the rest of her life! I’ve visited Prince several times now and she, er… he, doesn’t recognise me any more. Now all he cares about is transforming guests and mounting mares, leaving me with nobody to talk to. Well that was until you came along…”<br />
<br />
“Y-your crazy! I…I didn’t… GAHHHHH!” Jenkins yelled out in distress as the serum started to target his internal organs and skeleton. He grimaced as his bones creaked and cracked while the movements of his innards made him feel sick.<br />
<br />
“That’s right mister Jenkins,” the Aviary’s boss continued, “soon you will share my friend’s fate. You deserve to be an animal for what you’ve done. But don’t worry, I’m going to make sure that you and I enjoy this process together…”<br />
<br />
With that, the deranged woman suddenly lunged forward. The doctor was too gripped with pain to resist as she practically tore off his labcoat and shirt. She then moved on to his bottom half; pulling down his smart trousers and finally his boxers, thus revealing his manhood to the world.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm not very impressive downstairs are we Mister Jenkins?!” She smiled as she gripped the doctor’s flaccid cock. “Thankfully you won’t be needing this for much longer. But I am not a purely evil person; I think you should be able to enjoy your pride and joy one last time!” <br />
<br />
Wasting no more time, the sinister woman began gently stroking Jenkins’ penis, causing him to shudder in surprise. He couldn’t stop his member from hardening as the woman’s hands expertly worked him over.<br />
<br />
However, this surge of sexual satisfaction seemed to accelerate the changes. Tiny goose pimples sprung up all over the doctor’s exposed skin before the first light green feathers started to emerge on his chest. <br />
<br />
Other significant changes included the growth of a short tail that was also covered in the same bumpy texture as the rest of the man’s skin. His arms and legs had also shifted dramatically. His legs had mostly receded into his body, while his toes had shifted to form a pair of bony feet. Meanwhile his arms had gradually moved to the point that they now tucked into his sides. These too were starting to adopt a bright colourful plumage as they steadily morphed into a pair of wings.<br />
<br />
Witnessing this arduous process seemed to make the Birdwoman even more excited. Her handjob increased in intensity as she encouraged the changes to accelerate. The doctor’s cock was now rock-hard and leaking pre-cum as the woman continued to stroke up and down furiously.<br />
<br />
And as weird as this situation was, Jenkins couldn’t help enjoying the sensations coming from his crotch. He began jerking his hips in response as his orgasm started to build. However this temporary loss of control allowed the changes to advance. Green downy feathers erupted all over his underside, while longer flight feathers, in various black, blue and yellow hues, filled in over his developing wings and tail. <br />
<br />
To an onlooker, Jenkins now looked like a partially-feathered, man-sized bird with a still-human head and set of genitalia. However, Jenkins didn’t look like this for long as the next dramatic stage of the process got underway.<br />
<br />
Dr Jenkins moaned in a mix of discomfort and pleasure as he finally came. The woman angled his cock so that he ended up shooting his load all over his chest. His underside was covered in stickiness as his cum congealed in his fluffy green feathers.<br />
<br />
“Ahh there we are,” the Birdwoman teased, “I’m glad you got to enjoy your favourite toy one last time. Now I think it’s time for you to say goodbye; you won’t be needing it now that you’re one of my wonderful pets!”<br />
<br />
The implications of the woman’s words didn’t really start to sink in until the changes firmly struck between his legs. He shuddered as his cock and balls shrivelled up and retreated under his tail. The doctor grimaced as his plumbing reconfigured itself, leaving him with a dark ring nestled at the base of his tail. Jenkins cried out as the remains of his penis were sucked inside the new orifice, followed soon after by his shrunken testicles. His old human junk reshaped into his new reproductive system as the vent of his new avian cloaca sealed itself shut.<br />
<br />
With this crucial modification complete, the transformation seemed to enter its final stages. Dr Jenkins was alarmed as he felt the changes starting to attack his still mostly-human head. <br />
<br />
“Stop – bwark!” Jenkins pleaded desperately, “bwark… sorry… bwark bwark!” Sadly the doctor’s begging only made the cruel woman laugh; leaving Jenkins to await his final changes in a state of total despair. <br />
<br />
The doctor let the final changes wash over him as he accepted that he couldn’t fight the powerful serum that was coursing through his veins. His whole body shrank as his skull started to reshape. The man’s human nose and ears steadily withdrew, while his long hair was supplanted as more yellow feathers pushed through the pores of his skin. His mouth also felt peculiar as his lips hardened before stretching forward into a short beak, while his eyes were reduced to a pair of black dots that sat on either side of his head. <br />
<br />
After a bit more shrinking Jenkins was complete: he was now a common budgie!<br />
<br />
“Marvellous!” The woman practically sang with delight as Dr Jenkins adopted his final form. “You look so beautiful; much better than you were as a human. Now let’s get you settled in; you and I are going to have so much fun together!”<br />
<br />
With that the woman scooped up the stunned bird before locking him in a simple wire bird cage. Jenkins was still mourning the loss of his body, particularly his manhood, as he sulked at the bottom of the cage. He was too terrified and ashamed to look at the evil bitch as she loomed over him. <br />
<br />
Sensing Jenkins’ distress, the bird-obsessed woman thought about how she could cheer him up. Soon she decided to…</p>
