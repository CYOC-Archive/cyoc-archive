<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I have another wish in mind at least, is a more accurate sentance.&quot; She begins. &quot;Whether or not I make it depends entirely on you though. So, here is the gist of it. I am willing to return you the ring, since it is still ultimately yours in the first place, as long as you adhere to the few conditions I have.&quot; Joe quickly nodded his head, eagerly waiting for her to return his ring. &quot;Ok then. I wish that all of the conditions I set are mandatory, so the moment you break one of them, the ring will return to being in my posession. Now, as for the conditions, they are as follows:<br />
<br />
1) You must never use this power to kill or be inhumane to anyone unless your life is immediatly being threatened.<br />
<br />
2) I get to use the ring each week durring a weekly 1 hour session that you will have with me until further notice, or if we reschedule. Additionally, you cannot interfere with my ability to use directly it in any way.<br />
<br />
3) For until I say otherwise, you are going to be a girl. I will let you decide on most of the details, as well as how you look for the most part, however you must look feminine, so you cant become an extreme tomboy or use &quot;the butch lesbian&quot; look. And, you will continuously spray breast milk out of your nipples, with no negative effect to your health of course. Adding to that, it will be acceptable for you to have your boobs uncovered, and you will not be required to clean up or &quot;catch&quot; your milk, nor will anyone be mad at you for spraying your milk on things. For starters, lets set you up with a pair of milk filled F cup breasts. Fun fact, this is the same size as mine are now,  so maybe we could trade bra&#39;s sometimes, although your&#39;s will likely have holes where your nipples line up at. Next, spraying out breast milk will feel mildly pleasant, and doing things like masturbating or having sex will increase the pressure behind your nipples, causing your milk to spray out further, harder, and faster until you stop. However breast feeding anyone will make your boobs feel their best. And I am sure it goes without saying that you will become the center of attention for a whike, however after their initial reaction, everyone will quickly adapt to and accept your new form and functions as being normal. Lastly, you will be bisexual as well.<br />
<br />
4) You must help one person out at least once a week. It can be anything, small to large, a quick fix, or a day long task, etc... Just be helpful to at least 1 person each week, and try to make them different people if you can. Actually lets make helping your relatives not count, just to be safe.<br />
<br />
For now, those are my conditions. Abide by them, and the ring is yours to keep. Any complaints?&quot; Joe was a bit more hesitant after hearing the requirements, especially the third one, but decided that it ultimately didn&#39;t matter as much as retrieving his ring. If he had his ring back, he could deal with the rest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. I accept your terms&quot; answered Joe. The moment he had finished saying that, Joe&#39;s body began to rapidly turn female. His facial features softened, height shrunk down a whopping 8 inches to 5&#39;-4&quot; from his former 6 feet, and his weight was cut by over 50 pounds as his figure thinned out, becomming more and more delicate and feminine. Joe&#39;s hair on the top of his head lengthened down his back until it stopped just pasted the small of his back, and turned pitch black as the rest of his body and facial hair vanished completely, leaving just his thinner, now well trimmed eyebrows and much longer and fuller eye lashes behind. His eyes widened slightly and turned a vibrant shade of green, which popped against his black hair and pale white skin. <br />
<br />
Next his waist tightened inwards, giving him a very attractive figure, which was only increased by the sudden growing of his ass and hips. Now in possession of full child bearing hips and a sexy bubble butt, it only made sense that his thighs would widen too, making Joe&#39;s lower half look better proportioned as the changes finished up with his feet and hands becomming smaller and delicate. The only 3 area left unchanged was his crotch, chest, and voice. All of which happened practically at the same time.<br />
<br />
Joe felt his dick quickly pull up inside of him, bringing his balls with it as it became his pussy. Meanwhile, her adam&#39;s apple vanished and her voice just slightly raised in pitch and became unmistakably feminine. It wasn&#39;t high pitched per say, but carried a feeling of maturity with a hint of sexy mixed in. And lastly, huge F cup boobs pushed out behind her nipples, which lengthened to about 1.5 inches as her milk began to spray out of them in a few continuous streams, with 2 heavier streams, 1 per nipple, dominating a majority of her flow. She quickly tore off her clothing and was able to finally see her body in her full length mirror. <br />
<br />
She was stunningly beautiful, or at least she felt that she was. The natural paleness of her skin made features like her lips and eyes stand out more in an alluring way.  Especially her eyes, which she felt that she could get lost in if she were to stare at them long enough. Her lips had become much more full too, as she licked them with her tongue, trying to create a seductive gesture, which she was actually, and rather easily able to pull off quite well for a first attempt. Even Dr. Von Hauser felt a bit drawn in by the gesture to the point she had to look away for a moment to hide and fix her flustered expression. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Gretta, pull yourself together. She is your patient. You can&#39;t fantasize about your patients no matter how much you really, REALLY, want to.&quot; Dr. Von Hauser whispered to herself. She was by no means a lesbian. However, there was just something about how Joe&#39;s new body looked which just landed her right in the very center of her strike zone. She ultimately decided to promise herself 1 masturbation &quot;bonus&quot; session where she could get off to Joe&#39;s new form and that would be the end of it. Or at least she hoped it would be or else she may need to rethink her strickt adherence towards the whole &quot;don&#39;t date your patients&quot; rule that she was forced to comply with or lose her license. &quot;Although, maybe a well worded wish could fix that...&quot; she pondered to herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Dr. Von Hauser?&quot; Called out Joe for a 4th time, finally getting her therapist&#39;s attention. &quot;Oh, sorry. I simply got a bit lost in a thought&quot; Apologized Dr. Von Hauser who couldn&#39;t stop herself from blushing slightly. &quot;...right, as I was saying. I&#39;m am going to try my best to live as a girl now, and I promise to follow all of your rules too. Also, once again, I am so sorry for what I did to you in our last session.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hearing that, Dr. Von Hauser snorted in amusement. &quot;Yeah, I wonder why I find that so hard to believe?&quot; She said sarcastically. It wouldn&#39;t be the first, nor the last time Joe tried to apologize for something he personally didn&#39;t feel guilty for. &quot;You know, sometimes I wish you were just a bit more genuine with your words. Then I might have believed you just now. But I know you too well to know that you don&#39;t feel guilty in the slightest.&quot; <br />
The look Joe now was giving her, which was similar to the common look of utter shock, where the woman covers her mouth with her hands as she goes wide eyed with disbelief, confused Dr. Von Hauser. Did she say anything which warranted that kind of response? She began to repeat what she said in her head, and didn&#39;t get foo far before she realized her error. &quot;Oh shit, um. well, why don&#39;t I let you sit with that for a week and I will fix it after our next session.&quot; She says as she quickly wishes to be back in her home and for the ring to be left on Joe&#39;s ring finger. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I just accidentally made her forced to be genuine with everything and anything she says and then just bailed on her. Well, she could learn a thing or 2 I suppose from this, so it shouldn&#39;t be too hard for her to adapt into being a mkre well mannered young lady. Who knows, she might start to respect others more too.<br />
<br />
Joe on the other hand was in total disbelief. She no longer could lie. How was she supposed to hide her power if she couldn&#39;t lie? At least no one would be hounding her for answers if she just avoided the topic. Also, on a different note, she needed a new name as well, or more accurately, she wanted one that was more feminine than Joe or Josephine. Maybe she should take a german sounding name as a small jab at Dr. Von Hauser... something like Hilda. &quot;Ooh, how about Freyja? Wasn&#39;t that like a goddess or something. Seems like a fitting name for a girl with this ring&#39;s power at her disposal.&quot; Freyja thought to herself. Additionally, she wished for the ring to become disguised as a navel piercing since she discovered that her body somehow already had a hole for one, and she didn&#39;t have anything to try it out with.</p>
