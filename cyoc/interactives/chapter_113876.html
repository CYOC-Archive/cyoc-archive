<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">       You can&#39;t quite describe the pull. It&#39;s almost instinctually yet almost as if someone is calling you. Asking you to come closer.  You follow it, the pull growing stronger as you make your way into the forest. As you make your way through the leaves and branches you subtly realize that there was something different about the forest around you. Everything was darker, almost as if it was nightime. The shadows were thicker and almost seemed touchable. You can feel a presence in the forest. Something dark and strange, yet familiar as well.<br />
<br />
              The pull grows stronger and suddenly an intense gust of wind pushes you. You close your eyes bracing yourself as the wind picks up and your feel yourself lifting off the ground. Wind rushes past you as you can&#39;t see anything at all.<br />
<br />
        After what seemed like enternity you open your eyes and see the forest around you disappear to be replaced with what you could only describe as hell. The sky was black with wisps of red, the ground beneath your feet was a black coarse sand. You feel yourself sweating immensely as you realize the intense temperature change. It felt as if you were in a oven!<br />
<br />
     &quot;Go ahead. Take off your clothes my new Demonblood.&quot; A deep echoing voice says. You look around and see no one. Nothing but dark sand and a endless black sky.<br />
<br />
      Confused you decide that this must be your patron. Setting your backpack down, you begin to strip of all of your clothing, relishing in the freedom as you even take off your underwear. <br />
You stand there buck naked as slowly you feel yourself cooling down, the once high temperature becoming moderate and average. Your penis hangs as you look around. Holding for another side, not noticing as you see your clothes and travel bags slowly sink into the black sand, never to be seen again.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Very good. You will have no use of those mortal clothing now. Soon your true awakening shall begin and your training will commence.&quot; The voice says.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Who are you? Are you my Patron?&quot; You say aloud. Not sure where you are or who the voice even is.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Yes Umbren. I am your Patron. I am the Demon Lord Anubis, Eater of Souls and Master of Shadows. Sixteen years ago I made the pact with your mother, now you are here. Please be free to ask me any questions.&quot; The voice replied, a reassuring tone in it&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
    Anubis? The Demon Hidden Within The Sand? He was your patron? Wasn&#39;t his influence only stretched to the desert far south of Nusquam? You think to yourself.<br />
<br />
   &quot;What do you mean by awakening? Anubis what do you want from me?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Umbren your fate was decided before birth, decided before you could do anything. I am aware of the cruelty your family have put you through, but here now, we may be demons,  but we are kin. We share a connection far deeper than even Blood itself. We are related through out souls. Your awakening refers to your demonic lineage becoming fully materialized. Soon you will no longer be human, instead you will be created in my image and after intense training, you will eventually become one of my highest commanders.&quot; Anubis replies.<br />
<br />
   &quot;What do you mean by your image?&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;Ah, forgive me. I had not properly introduced myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
          In front of your very eyes red mist begins to swirl a couple of feet in front of you. The mist changes and contorts slowly forming a humanoid shape until finally, mist becomes fur and flesh and before you stands Anubis hold a golden staff and wearing a ritualistic white garmet with golden decorations that also revealed much of his chest and arms.<br />
<br />
     Your eyes widen as you look at Anubis and realize that he was no human looking at all. Jet black fur covered him completely and his head was that of a jackel, sharp white teeth glistening in the darkness. His hands were pawed and he had digitgrade legs.<br />
<br />
    The most interesting feature were his eyes, they had no pupils but instead were just completely yellow, you stared into them, enchanted by the golden pools he called his eyes.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I will look like you?&quot; You ask dumbstruck.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Yes Umbren, but that is not all. Soon my minions will give you a proper education, you will learn Blood Magic, you will learn swordplay, and you will be granted immortality so you can forever be by my side as a loyal Commander and general.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Blood magic? You want me to learn Blood Magic?&quot; <br />
<br />
   &quot;Yes, it will all make sense in time. You will learn Blood Magic and grow in power, your power willl grow to rival even that of Arch Angels and even Gods will eventually fear your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
           &quot;Incredible... but what do you want me to do? Are you going to make me murder and killed humans? Eat their souls and spread chaos?&quot; You ask, you weren&#39;t sure how you felt. It felt incredible but also worrisome and intense. You were talking with a actual Demonlord, for all you knew he was lying perhaps this is even a trap.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Do not worry Umbren, Not all Demons wish for human extinction. What I simply wish for is the balance of good and evil in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Balance of Good and Evil?&quot;<br />
<br />
          &quot;Yes you see, Demons and Gods despite their differences are the same. We all believe that this world must be different in their own perspective. Gods believe that mortal races should worship them and seek their guidance only, whilst demons believe that mortals should be free to make their own choices and have the freedom to make mistakes, no matter how grave. All Gods and Demon Lords believe this, though there are many differences between each other.  The Demon Lord Fenris for example wishes for a world of Nature, where only predators and prey exists, while Sanas wishes for a world where nothing is ever killed. <br />
However I believe that this world must have death. Death is a required cycle of life. Death weeds out the evils of humanity and gives the goodness eternal rest. This is what I believe Umbren, me and my minions kill those we believe are filled with evil and hatred and. By doing so making the balance complete. However Gods like Bellum the God of War constantly seek conflict and bloodshed. Not everything so is just black and white.&quot; Anubis answered. <br />
    As he spoke you noticed he spoke to you not unlike how a father would speak to a child, yet he also seemed to speak to you with respect. Was this how a father should act? You wonder silently to yourself. His words did make sense. Everyone wants the world to be perfect, but the problem is that everyone has a different meaning of perfect. <br />
<br />
   &quot;Now Umbren. Now you must make a choice, the first choice of your new life. Will you willingly join me and my army? Knowing that you will kill thousands of people, with you knowing that some of them may be innocent? Will you join me as my loyal commander and help me rid the world of evil and rid the world of the Gods who believe that they should be worshipped simply because they can?&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;I-I&#39;m not sure Anubis.&quot; You stammer out. You weren&#39;t sure if you were ready for this, but wasn&#39;t this what your entire life was about? This meeting with Anubis was destined to happen. So why not go along with it? But would you be willing to become a demon? No matter how much sense Anubis&#39; words seem to have, at his core he is a demon. You&#39;ve heard stories about Anubis. Far south from your village, deep within the desert lands you&#39;ve heard stories from traveling merchants about Anubis, how he was the downfall of several nations and the killer of both men and women alike. </p>
