<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Todd and Blake awoke to find that Jay was missing from the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, where's Jay?  You think he got up early?&quot; Blake asked.<br />
<br />
Todd shrugged, then yawned.<br />
<br />
Blake sat on his air mattress for a moment.  &quot;I don't know about you, but I had the weirdest dream last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You too?&quot; Todd asked.  &quot;It must have something to do with sleeping somewhere new.&quot;  Although, he wasn't quite sure what that would have to do with having a gay sex dream.  It was pretty fucked up too, since Todd was definitely not into that stuff.  None of his friends were, really.  Well, maybe except for Blake, who had told him that he was unsure about his sexuality, but he never said anything about acting on his feelings, certainly nothing like what happened in the dream.  Maybe it was the creepiness exuded from his uncle that caused him to dream like that.  Sure, the guy was family, but that didn't mean that Todd couldn't feel uncomfortable around the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess,&quot; Blake said.<br />
<br />
The two boys then left the room and headed downstairs.  It was quiet.  Too quiet.  Where was Jay?<br />
<br />
&quot;Jay?&quot; Blake said.  &quot;Dude, where are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
They checked all of the rooms, but there was no sign of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's everywhere,&quot; Blake said.<br />
<br />
Todd shook his head.  &quot;We didn't check Uncle Marc's bedroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would Jay be in there?  It's clear that that guy creeped him out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd shrugged.  &quot;Well, if Jay left, maybe my uncle knows where he went.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, they headed back upstairs and straight to the door to the master bedroom.  Todd knocked.  &quot;Uncle Marc?  Are you up?&quot;  There was no answer.<br />
<br />
Todd turned and looked at Blake, then turned back and opened the door.<br />
<br />
Both boys entered the room, then stopped and stared.<br />
<br />
Well, they found Jay, but it was in one of the last places they ever thought: in Uncle Marc's bed, cuddling with the older man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jay?  What the fuck?&quot; Todd nearly yelled.<br />
<br />
It was enough to wake Jay and Marc.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey, boyth,&quot; Jay said, with a smile, as his hand caressed Marc's bare chest.  Then they watched as Jay's hand moved underneath the covers and began caressing something else, which could only have been Marc's cock.  They couldn't believe what they were seeing.  Jay was gay?  What was with all that gay-hater stuff then?<br />
<br />
Marc opened his eyes and smiled at Todd and Blake.  &quot;Hey, you're awake.  Hungry for some breakfast?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on here?&quot; Todd asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Marc asked back, feigning ignorance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is Jay in bed with you?&quot; Todd asked.<br />
<br />
Marc smiled.  &quot;Because we had sex last night, then fell asleep afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
That wasn't an answer.  Or not the one Todd wanted.  He wanted to know what got Jay to do something completely out of character for him.  Suddenly, Todd paused and took a good look at his friend.  He didn't really notice before, but Jay looked different.  More slender, and was his hairstyle different?  He had a very boyish look about him, like those gay guys ... what were they called?  Twinks?  Jay didn't look like that last night.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you boys need is something to eat,&quot; Marc said, getting out of bed.  He was completely naked.  Todd looked away, but Blake's gaze lingered for a moment.  Sure, the guy was older and balding, but he had an impressive manhood.  Blake was still unsure about his sexuality, but this was probably an indication that it was leaning more towards gay than straight.<br />
<br />
Then Jay got out of bed, giving Todd the unobstructive view of his new bubble butt.  That settled it.  Something happened to Jay overnight.  Both mentally and physically.  Todd just stood there, still in shock, as he watched his formerly completely straight friend swish towards the bedroom door, his hands hanging limply from his wrists.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait up, thweetie,&quot; Jay said, quickening his pace to meet up with Marc.  Then both of them left the room, looking like a longtime gay couple.  Todd felt sick.  What had happened to his friend?  Was there any way to get him back to normal?  Or was he stuck this way forever?  But there was a more important question on Todd's mind.  Would what happened to Jay also happen to him?  He shuddered.<br />
<br />
After Jay and Marc left the room, Blake turned to Todd.  &quot;Jay makes a pretty good twink.  I wonder how it happened?&quot;  Unlike Todd, there was no fear in his voice.  It almost sounded like Blake was interested in knowing how Jay changed so he could do the same to himself or someone else.  Todd even thought that Blake liked the idea of Jay being gay.  If there was a chance that they could change Jay back, would Blake allow it?  Todd feared that he may not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's get after them,&quot; Todd said, breaking himself out of his daze.  &quot;Jay is different.  And I think Uncle Marc knows something about it.&quot;  And with that, both boys left the bedroom and headed downstairs to the kitchen.  Marc was making breakfast, using some of his &quot;special&quot; ingredients.</p>
