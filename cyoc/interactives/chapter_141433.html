<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>All dream references are from our previous Charlestons episode &quot;Dreams of the Future&quot;, written by A Moon Lake Fan.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(As far as the sexual rating for this episode is concerned, there wasn&#39;t an option for &quot;Almost, but not quite.&quot;—tmw.)<br />
<br />
After a hearty breakfast that morning, something none of them had an appetite for in months (since the whole mess with the Gambonis first started), the Charlestons went together as a family to inspect the new Moon Lake site for Moe&#39;s Pizza.<br />
Karen&#39;s first thought as they entered was <i>So, this it it.</i><br />
Her family&#39;s pizzeria had been a fixture of her life for as long as she could remember, that is until one man thought she should belong to him and no one else.<br />
What was the proudest moment in her father&#39;s professional life was just a historical footnote now, since there had been no opportunity to successfully reestablish the pizza place once they started running.<br />
But now the running had stopped.<br />
Or at least, that was everyone&#39;s hope.<br />
With old friends rallying the town behind them, the Charlestons were going to get on with their lives, even if that meant Karen would soon have her own fursona as the newest member of Moon Lake&#39;s were community.<br />
She turned to look at her reflection in the glass wall tiles near the entrance to the restrooms.<br />
<i>Only a lioness left to talk to, then I&#39;ll be making the decision that affects the rest of my life. I know what I&#39;m leaning towards, but with this being so monumental, I have to be thorough. Yet, even with all my research, there is no way to know for sure exactly how much this will impact my life until after it happens. I&#39;ll still be me, right? Not going for werecat, I won&#39;t have to worry about either becoming bi or full lesbian, but I&#39;ll still be Karen Charleston.<br />
Just a different Karen Charleston. Was that Peter I dreamed of last night, or some other weredog? Do the two species even get along here? I still have so many questions...</i><br />
Yet Karen would be surprised to know that her parents also needed answers to were questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was this place before?&quot; Nichole asked her husband.<br />
&quot;Some kind of sandwich shop,&quot; responded Moe. &quot;I was told it went under because the served portions didn&#39;t meet customer demands.&quot;<br />
&quot;Probably because of the true nature of most of its citizens,&quot; suspected his wife, looking things over.<br />
Yet, even as she weighed the logistics of equipment, refurbishing and remodeling, let alone the initial stocking and getting everything ready to open, other thoughts crossed her mind.<br />
<i>Moe and I have talked before of having another child, and I&#39;m certainly not too old to do so, yet. But those damn Gambonis have certainly gone out of their way to screw up our lives. Yet why did I dream of Moe and I both being weres, let alone our future daughter being one too? Sure, some of the males pictured in that town book Karen has looked hot, if you&#39;re into fur, but I fell in love with a man, not an animal. Moe is my man. Not my... whatever he might have been. Yet, I can&#39;t deny some of those women were very beautiful. Hell, most of the people in this town look like they just came off a fashion runway. Once Karen changes, will Moe want to? He&#39;ll still want me, right? But will I still want him? At least, will I still want him the way he is now, or the way he would be after he...</i><br />
<br />
A clang interrupted Nichole&#39;s thoughts.<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; said Moe. &quot;I just opened this cupboard ant that skillet fell out,&quot; he apologized, while bending down to pick it up.<br />
But as he was bowed, Moe couldn&#39;t help getting a good look at his wife&#39;s legs.<br />
<i>Nichole is still as beautiful today as the moment I first met her. But why am I suddenly getting aroused at the thought of those gorgeous gams being covered in fur?</i> he asked himself while straightening up, but making sure his wife and daughter didn&#39;t see the sudden erection he was having. <i>I&#39;ve always considered her a fox, but do I really want Nichole to become a fox, or some other were? Do I want to change? Let alone alter our marriage?</i><br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll definitely need to rework this corner to install a pizza oven,&quot; realized Nichole, thankful for the distraction.<br />
&quot;Maybe two,&quot; suggested Moe, coming over to examine the wall. &quot;But I don&#39;t see any natural gas connections. The sandwich shop was probably all electric.&quot;<br />
&quot;They may not be online right now, but the refrigerators still look in good shape,&quot; said Nichole, inspecting both the full size and under the counter units.<br />
As his wife was bent over, Moe couldn&#39;t help picturing her with different animal tails sticking out of the waist line of her pants suit.<br />
<i>I still love Nichole. Want her. NEED her. By my side. Today, tomorrow, and always,</i> he realized. <i>But how?</i> Moe asked himself, even as he started caressing one of her butt cheeks.<br />
Nichole was startled to the point of almost hitting her head as she tried to stand up again.<br />
&quot;Moe,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Not in front of Karen.&quot;<br />
But their daughter was lost in her own thoughts...<br />
<br />
<i>The huntress silently stalked her prey through the forest. She never hunted for food. It was the thrill of the chase that got her heart racing. That made her blood boil well past the point of arousal. Especially when she caught him and—</i><br />
&quot;Karen!&quot; both parents said in unison.<br />
&quot;What? Sorry. Just lost in thought,&quot; replied their daughter.<br />
&quot;Can you go to the car and start getting the cleaning supplies and other stuff out of the trunk?&quot; Moe asked, holding up the keys to their vehicle.<br />
&quot;Sure dad,&quot; she replied.<br />
But as Karen started to rise from the booth she occupied, she happened to look down at her scribbles in the dust on the table surface.<br />
There, next to the crude drawing of a feline female figure, were two words.<br />
KAREN BROOKS?<br />
Erasing only the writing, she got up, grabbed the keys out of her father&#39;s hand, and ran outside the future pizzeria to complete her errand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once Karen comes back in with my laptop and our tape measure, we can start planning Moe&#39;s Pizza: Moon Lake in earnest,&quot; Nichole told her husband.<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; he said, while moving a step closer to her. &quot;Have I told you yet today how much I love you?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, but I already know,&quot; she replied with a smile, before the couple embraced and started kissing.<br />
One led to another, and soon Moe&#39;s tongue was dancing with Karen&#39;s between her mouth and his own as they held each other tighter.<br />
Her eyes widened in happiness as she felt something hard press against her legs.<br />
Moe&#39;s heart seemed to skip a beat as Karen spread her legs a little, inviting his manhood to go to the place they both wanted it to enter, despite the fact the Charlestons were still fully dressed.<br />
Hands started to move to address that situation when they heard a loud &quot;I&#39;m back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Charlestons turned their heads to see their daughter reenter the future pizza parlor, carrying the large moving box from the car trunk.<br />
Moe and Nichole both blushed a bit at being &quot;caught&quot;, but not realizing that Karen had watched them for far longer than they suspected.<br />
It was only when they were about to move forward with their current expression of love that she announced her presence.<br />
Moe and Nichole smiled sheepishly at each other, before sharing one last kiss.<br />
&quot;Later,&quot; Nichole whispered in her husband&#39;s ear.<br />
Yet there was now one question on each adult&#39;s mind that they had no answer for.</p>
