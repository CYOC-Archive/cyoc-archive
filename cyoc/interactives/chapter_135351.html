<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a bit of talking, you started thinking about what it would be like to be in Rose&#39;s side... Not remembering your life as it is, knowing from the fact she&#39;d use the light on you that things were different but not remembering it, and there were a few things from her stories of her new life that sounded interesting... Would you have been turned on your whole life by your own body like she was.<br />
<br />
You pull out the flashlight and hand it to her. &quot;Might as well finish the job, besides... It might lead to something interesting to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes light up as you hand her the flashlight. &quot;This is going to be fun! You&#39;re going to remember a hilarious life!&quot;<br />
<br />
You almost feel a twinge of fear, wondering if she might go overboard, but she&#39;s already lying you on the floor spread out and telling you to close your eyes so you&#39;re not constantly aware of what&#39;s changed.<br />
<br />
It takes a bit longer than you expected, she seems to focus a lot on specific parts of your body. You try not to think about it too much, but curiosity keeps getting the better of you. At some point you feel like reminding her that closing your eyes isn&#39;t really going to stop you knowing what she&#39;s doing, but realize that speaking probably would ruin that a lot more than opening your eyes would. Could she even understand you?<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, you can look now,&quot; she says, lifting you up.<br />
<br />
You look down at your body, not entirely sure what she&#39;s changed until you remember what you&#39;ve been doing all day. Your eyes practically bulge as you realize you weren&#39;t always like this.<br />
<br />
You remember how hard school was with bat wings instead of arms, at first you&#39;d been jealous until you hit puberty and how helpless it made you feel turned you on. How you couldn&#39;t stop all the girls ganging up on you to grope your four rows of palm able tits, how you felt pampered whenever you were scratched behind the ears. How you saw your white furred fox face and thought it was the most adorable thing ever. How you first went into heat and couldn&#39;t even hold yourself up with your wings as you were forced to by held up by your squished breasts. How a lot of people treated you as mute because your voice was too high for them to hear. How late at night when it rained you felt like your sonar made you see everything for miles. How your first girlfriend ploughed into you pussy with a strap on. How comforting your tail is on lonely nights.<br />
<br />
… How expensive it is to shop for bras when you have 8 breasts never-mind that they&#39;re B-cups, or how you adored your first pair of bright blue boyshorts as you thought they made you look sporty while still hugging your pussy.<br />
<br />
You blink the memories away to focus on the hear and now... You&#39;re not sure if you were a boy before, but Rose&#39;s restrained laughter makes you think you were... And giving yourself a look you don&#39;t remember ever having to give yourself, you guess she&#39;s mostly used fox for all of you except your wings... Erm… Arms? Though if your hearing and voice are anything to go by, she probably brought the light real close to your ears and throat to make sure you had the internal workings needed for the sonar, though your ears and throat don&#39;t really look like they belong on a bat... They look more like fennec ears, which is weird when you seem more modelled after an arctic fox.<br />
<br />
After a while, you start just checking yourself out, which just as Rose said was for her, seems like its happened a lot for you... You would hold yourself up to a mirror even as you lowered yourself onto a standing dildo, one you remember using since wings were useless for digging into your own pussy, or even just holding a dildo.<br />
<br />
You look over at Rose unsure if she would even be able to hear you if you spoke. &quot;Can you... Hear me?&quot; You squeak.<br />
<br />
She giggles. &quot;Yes, I can hear you. Your voice is so adorable!&quot;<br />
<br />
You start blushing, hiding your face with your wings which only makes her laugh harder.<br />
<br />
She pushes you onto your back again, and slowly lowers the front part of your more lacy than usual panties, the pair you were wearing so you could tease your friends with your hot fluffy ass. You feel her press her tongue inside you and swirl around, only to retreat and leave you with a needy whine.<br />
<br />
She suddenly snaps the band back making you moan, as she pulls herself onto you.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re not sure you noticed when you were changing her, but as she presses her bust to yours, you feel a number of smaller buds poking your other breasts, all of your breasts feel sensitive as each of her nipples rubs against yours, the feel of this many bouncy tits rubbing together is hard to focus on, you&#39;ve always felt like there were never enough hands to handle them all at once, but her boobs match in time with yours, and you&#39;re in bliss before you&#39;re even able to picture them all at once. <br />
<br />
She intertwines her tail with yours, and you wrap you wings around her as she presses the front part of her vagina sticking through the swimsuit into your own vagina through your panties. You don&#39;t remember being much of a kisser, your muzzle was always a bit awkward for humans, but Rose guides you, locking your mouths together rather than just locking lips, and you almost giggled at the thought that it might look like the two of you are trying to eat each other&#39;s faces. The rocking of your crotches together makes your boobs begin to bob back and forth, and you never realized before how great it would be to intertwine tails. You can&#39;t remember what a penis feels like, but it can&#39;t be as sensitive as this, with a feel like silk on silk.<br />
<br />
Its not long before your toes are curling in the first climax, your pussy is leaking like a pipe, and you&#39;re panting too hard to keep going; even as your sex begs you to go on, to keep fishing for the true orgasm that lies at the end of multiple climaxes.<br />
<br />
Rose laughs at this. &quot;Aww, little kitty not got enough stamina?&quot;<br />
<br />
You look into her eyes and lick her nose. &quot;We should go out more often.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose raises both her eyebrows and smiles. &quot;Its a date.&quot; She takes the flashlight you gave her and slips it into your bra between your breasts. &quot;I don&#39;t think you brought a bag, and panties don&#39;t exactly have pockets, so it should be good there until you can dig it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look between your breasts and know your wings are going to have a nightmare trying to do just that. &quot;Not fair, what if I wanted to use that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Wanting to change back?&quot; Rose said smirking.<br />
<br />
You shake your head. &quot;Why would I? Its like you said, why would I want to go back to a form I don&#39;t remember that just... Normal?&quot; You do tilt you head to emphasis the next part. &quot;But I could stumble across someone I want to change on the way home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose giggles. &quot;Maybe you should come home with me then, I can show you all the things you never knew about your body in a world with only humans for company, AND dig it out if you need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You find you tail raising behind you, and your sex getting aroused again, but you do think you should check on a few things... You changed a lot of people besides yourself, maybe you should see if the world around you has changed... Heck, for all you know, even your memories of this body are incomplete given how many ways having others like you around would affect your life, even if you don&#39;t remember anyone like you existing before today, even though reality has changed so they always existed.<br />
<br />
… That&#39;s... Confusing.</p>
