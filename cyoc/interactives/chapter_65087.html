<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the chaos died down around the inflatable demoness with life-like attached dildo, two guys and a girl <br />
having claimed a spot in the coveted 'not to be changed' pool of onlookers. A few horny teens, likely ones who <br />
weren't likely to get any action on their own, were still having fun with the toy as Kylie scanned the crowd <br />
for her next 'volunteers.'<br />
<br />
&quot;You there, the one in the ghost costume. Let's see your face.&quot; The witch snapped her fingers and a sudden <br />
gust of wind caught the edge of a plain white sheet and whipped it up over the boy's head who was hiding under <br />
it. <br />
<br />
Bryan Dumple was a nerd, a big one, and he conformed to what a lot of people imagined when they thought of the <br />
stereotype. He had thick, curly brown hair that was dangerously close to being a greasy mullet. His black-<br />
rimmed glasses were foggy from his heavy breathing underneath the sheet and the smudges from his oily cheeks <br />
rubbing against the bottom. Bryan had a mild case of acne, was uncomfortably overweight with a large tummy <br />
straining against his button up shirt and suspenders, and buck teeth that he was trying to straighten with <br />
orthodontic braces. When he got nervous, as he was while the witch scrutinized him, he tended to sweat <br />
profusely and end up with an odor not unlike smelly feet and wet dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect,&quot; Kylie said. She beckoned him up on stage while continuing her search. An idea was forming in her <br />
mind. She quickly spotted a few other participants and had them reluctantly climb the stage steps and stand in <br />
front of everyone along with Bryan.<br />
<br />
Stacy Matthews was, like Bryan, an outcast. She wore frumpy, over-sized sweaters in faded colors to try and <br />
hide her own spare tire around the middle. Her short, stringy hair was a drab brown and stuck to her forehead <br />
or her red, pudgy cheeks. Her nose was fat and slightly upturned, giving her a piggish appearance and a <br />
tendency to snort when she needed to catch her breath and snore loudly when she slept. She had blotchy skin, <br />
acne down her back, and a wide rear end that required specially tailored pants to fit right. She was dressed <br />
in an ill-fitting store-bought princess costume and was regretting her attendance to the party as she stared <br />
nervously out at the watching faces.<br />
<br />
Next to her, but not too close, was Kevin Willow, the center and captain of the school's soccer team. He was <br />
tall and lean with wavy blond hair and sparkling blue eyes. He had a nice tan from being outside all the time <br />
and was in excellent shape. He was dressed as an Egyptian prince, his muscular chest bare for all to see, <br />
including his washboard abs. A white wrap hugged his slim hips and accented his toned ass, his lean, athletic <br />
legs also being showed off below. His attention wasn't on the two losers next to him, but on the final <br />
participant to his right.<br />
<br />
Gwen Jones was on the cheer squad with Jen and also head of the school's volunteer club. She prided herself on <br />
her image of a kind, caring girl when really all she wanted was to leverage her image into a good school and <br />
leave the town behind her. Her long, straight black hair fell to the middle of her back and shimmered in the <br />
light, thanks to a glitter spray she had used earlier. She had smooth, olive skin from her Italian father and <br />
perfect pink lips and bright green eyes thanks to her mother. From cheer she had a lithe, athletic body with a <br />
firm stomach, tight booty, and long, lean legs for miles. Her breasts were a large C cup, nearing a D, and she <br />
enjoyed wearing a push-up bra to accentuate them. Her costume was that of a sexy pirate wench, with a short, <br />
tattered skirt, leather boots, and a deep, cleavage-revealing top that was closer to a bikini top than a real <br />
shirt.<br />
<br />
With her new batch of students before her, Kylie began to explain what would happen. &quot;I've been having a lot <br />
of fun with my games,&quot; she said, &quot;that I'm going to keep them coming. This time it's a team competition. Each <br />
popular student will be paired with a loser. The popular one will need to change his or her teammate into <br />
someone similar to themselves. That is, popular.&quot; The witch paused to smile as Kevin and Gwen looked at Bryan <br />
and Stacy with barely concealed contempt and disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can only make small changes, one at a time, but if you make them clever then several things might change <br />
from just one nudge. The first team to reach the goal wins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't seem so bad,&quot; said Gwen, brightening slightly. She could give one of them a makeover, that was <br />
easy enough.<br />
<br />
Kylie held up a finger. &quot;There's a catch. For every change you make to your partner, one will happen to you. <br />
It will be a surprise, I'm sure. You might even find some new thoughts in your pretty heads, some new urges <br />
and wants, so you'll have to fight against them to reach your goal. If you end up changing your partner too <br />
far from popular, you'll lose. So losers? Help your partners out by keeping them focused on what they need to <br />
do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Gwen and I have to just turn our loser into a popular version of themselves without getting sidetracked <br />
with whatever is happening to us?&quot; Kevin asked. &quot;How will we know when the goal has been met?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your partner will tell you. They'll be completely honest about what they want you to give them, how's that?&quot; <br />
Kylie snapped her fingers and both Bryan and Stacy lost their inhibitions and felt some of their shyness melt <br />
away. &quot;Is that everything? Excellent.&quot; The witch clapped her hands. &quot;Now, if you have any other questions feel <br />
free to blurt them out but for now how shall I divide you? Should it be boys verses girls or one of each?&quot;</p>
