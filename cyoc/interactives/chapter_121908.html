<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The fat officer’s unimpressive boner started leaking inside his loins. Holy shit, Jack Stunning was there on the screen, completely buttnaked. His hands were covering his crotch and this only served to make his hairy pectorals stand out even more because his 9-inch cock was impossible to conceal.<br />
<br />
It was the first time Carl had seen Jack Stunning this vulnerable. The tiny little man stood in the center of the screen. He seemed to be protesting but he barely could be heard. His cries sounded like those of a squeaky little mouse.<br />
<br />
“Is the size reduction a side-effect of the Virtualizer?” Asked Carl to the nerd operating the laptop.<br />
<br />
The scrawny guy started talking with his mouth full of chewing gum. This nerd was gross. “Uh? Nah, he’s not small. The camera’s just too far away.” The nerd rolled up the mouse wheel and suddenly a crystal clear rendition of Jack Stunning’s hairy chest filled the screen. It was impressive how every single body hair had been perfectly recreated. “But it kinda grosses me out to zoom in so much on a guy.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, of course...! It’d gross me out as well to see a muscular man like him all up and personal!” Carl lied. “...Although we should rotate the camera 180 degrees. You know, to make sure he’s being faithfully rendered...”<br />
<br />
The nerd pressed the mouse wheel to rotate the camera. “Yes, he’s been virtualized with 100% fidelity. He also missed a spot when he wiped his butt this morning. You can see some tiny specks of shit right between these two butthairs, right below the anus. See? Seriously, you old geezers and your fear of technology...”<br />
<br />
Jack Stunning turned around in surprise inside the empty virtual world. He was covering his penis with one hand and his butt with the other, embarrassed at the fact that the nerd and Carl were able to see him in 360º with every single detail faithfully recreated.<br />
<br />
“So, have you decided yet? What do we turn him into?”<br />
<br />
Carl thought for a good while. Maybe a penguin? They were cute but Jack as an online enforcer needed to look more authoritative.<br />
<br />
“Mmm... I know!” Announced Carl. “Let’s turn him into a snowman. It’d fit the theme. But make sure he looks as *stunning* as he looks right now... You know... Like a badass police officer.”<br />
<br />
“I think I know what you mean...Let’s give it a try. Hopefully my modeling skills didn’t get rusty.” The nerd pressed the “Edit Mesh” button and Jack was forced to adopt a T-Pose with his arms. He blushed when he looked down at his dangling cock, but he couldn’t move anything other than his eyes while he was being edited.<br />
<br />
Jack tried to protest when a bird-sized mouse cursor appeared and started hovering all over his body as it pondered what part of the naked man to sculpt first, but his screams were muffled. He realized there was an output sound volume button on the nerd’s desktop and it was currently set at the bare minimum.<br />
<br />
“First off, this has to go.” Said the nerd as the cursor pointed at the 9-inch piece of meat. The nerd right-clicked it, then hovered over various woeful-sounding options like “Resize”, “Delete”, “Flatten” until he decided to press “Cut”.<br />
<br />
The moment he pressed it, Jack’s cock was gone.<br />
<br />
“Mmmppphhh!” or “You bastard, you cut off my cock!” as Jack wanted to scream.<br />
<br />
Then the cursor created a new yellow folder which it named “Unnecessary” and pasted Jack’s cock inside it.<br />
<br />
“Why’s he so mad? His cock will be fine in my folder. My Solid Storage Drive still has one year of warranty left.” The nerd commented as he saw Jack Stunning’s thick eyebrows move into a no-bullshit frown.<br />
<br />
“Maybe he feels uncomfortable with another person keeping his cock away while he’s undercover...” Carl said. He’d surely be freaked out as heck in Jack’s situation. “I’m sure he’d rather keep it close.”<br />
<br />
“Oh...” The nerd chewed in thought. “Ah, I know!”<br />
<br />
The nerd opened the folder and right-clicked Jack’s penis, then selected “Edit”. First he changed the cock’s color to orange and applied a carrot-like texture. Then he squished his balls and the tip of the shaft so it’d look more like a carrot.<br />
<br />
“MMMMMF!” Cried Jack, feeling all the changes applied to his cock in real time.<br />
<br />
The nerd then attached Jack’s cock...er...carrot to his nose. Jack could feel his cock and nose fusing and sharing each other’s functions as a single appendage.<br />
<br />
The cursor applied a snow texture to Jack’s body, overriding all of his body hair in the process.  He now looked like a very muscular sculpture made of pure white snow. The cursor turned Jack’s eyeballs into expressionless, solid black marbles and his lips into smaller pebbles which were positioned in a cocky grin.<br />
<br />
His nipples were turned into rocky buttons along his belly button, which became the third button on its torso.<br />
<br />
The cursor applied a wooden texture to Jack’s muscular arms. A regular snowman would have feeble sticks, but this snowhunk had strong tree trunks instead. These wooden limbs still looked like they could break at any second, though.<br />
<br />
The next thing to model was his clothing. Well, just a sheriff’s hat, badge and a police tool belt with handcuffs were the only garments the nerd actually bothered to model.<br />
<br />
“Just a few final touches...” Said the nerd as the cursor applied a reflective shader all over Jack’s muscles slowly and with care. This is what a statue must feel when it’s polished, thought Jack. It felt kinda nice.<br />
<br />
The white six pack on his torso now had a faint rough surface as if it was made of actual snow. Jack’s body was white and shaved completely clean. This, unfortunately, included his giant glutes, his buttocks now looking like two white bowling balls.<br />
<br />
When the cursor clicked “Save changes” Jack could move once again. He reached down under his toolbelt, a shiny bulge was all that remained of this snowhunk’s manhood. Jack rubbed his blank groin and he didn’t feel anything, but then he pinched his button-nipples and got very surprised when he found out he got a runny nose...er...carrot, from the slightest touch on his sensitive buttons.<br />
<br />
“That should do it... Oh, I didn’t notice Jack was muted.” The nerd increased Jack’s voice volume.<br />
<br />
“He seems ready for action.” Said Carl looking at Jack’s expression.<br />
<br />
“I’m not, it’s just that my mouth’s default idle position is a grin.” Jack admitted, his 9-inch carrot pointing down all flaccid. “Err... I’m actually having second thoughts about this idea...”<br />
<br />
“As long as our connection to Frosted Lands’ servers is stable there should be no problem.” Said the nerdy guy. “We can retrieve your virtual avatar’s body and restore it to full health with an app I have here on my laptop.”<br />
<br />
Jack didn’t like how the nerd had said “virtual avatar’s *body*”, as if he could end up a corpse. It’s a game designed for all ages, right? What could go wrong?<br />
<br />
“Ok, beam me down into the servers, nerd guy.” Said Jack, keeping his cool. As cool as a snowhunk could be.<br />
<br />
“Will you guys please stop calling me ‘nerd’? My name’s Steven...”<br />
<br />
Carl was excited. “I can’t wait to see Jack Stunning in action! Jack him up to Frosted Lands, nerd guy!”<br />
<br />
The nerd guy sighed and opened the app portal to Frosted Lands. The snowhunk walked towards it and the moment he touched the portal Jack Stunning’s data left the safety of the nerd guy’s computer and traversed the wild, strange world that is the internet until he arrived at his destination...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
“...Why has the screen gone black?” Asked Carl.<br />
<br />
“We lost our connection to Jack!” Cried out the nerd in a panic. “Damn! That hacker! He must’ve have disabled our firewalls, or...! Oh, wait. It’s just that the movie I was downloading ate up my data cap... Uh... What’s your WiFi password?”<br />
<br />
While Carl and the nerd tried their best to reconnect the laptop to the world wide web, Jack had found himself tangled up in a very inconvenient situation...</p>
