<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Doris not sure what else to do decided to follow the teenagers orders and toddled off into the large room to look for some playmates. At first glance the daycare at the moment seemed to contained half a dozen children who were between the ages of 1 and 3. Four of the babies were dressed just like her and two of them weren&#39;t. Assuming the ones dressed like her were also adults who were regressed Doris made a beeline for the nearest ones, which happened to be a pair of 3 year olds, a boy with short black hair and a girl with long brown hair. As Doris drew closer she saw they were building a tower out of Duplo blocks, basically the larger more child friendly version of Legos.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi...I&#39;m Doris. Can I play with you guys?&quot; she asked hesitantly, blushing at how much of a baby she sounded like with her shy timidness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Doris. And sure you can play with us. Have a seat&quot; the boy cheerfully greeted while patting the empty spot on the floor between them. Sitting down Doris noticed her hidden padding cushioning her rear, realizing for the first time how soft and comfy her diaper felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what age were you before you regressed?&quot; he asked curiously.<br />
<br />
Distracted as she was by her new underwear Doris nearly missed the question, &quot;Uh I was 39 but I spent too long on the treadmill and ended up 2. But I swear I did know it was making me younger!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too lost in the zone to notice the physical change huh?&quot; the boy chuckled, &quot;Don&#39;t sweat it as that happens a lot here with first timers. Just as ask Karen here, the exact same thing happened to her this morning. Also my names Zack by the way, formerly 20 in case you were wondering&quot; Zack added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I also decided to use the treadmill first. I thought I was doing 30 thirty minutes, didn&#39;t realize it was showing my age until it was too late. Good thing I petered out at 3 otherwise I could have ended up a 1 year old&quot; Karen explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since this her first time being a toddler again I&#39;ve been showing her the ropes so to speak&quot; Zack replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you work here or something?&quot; Doris asked think the little boy was a regressed gym employee.<br />
<br />
Zack quickly shook her head, &quot;Nah I&#39;m a customer just like you. Couple years ago I got a free four year membership to this place and thought I&#39;d give it a try. Best decision of my life, for you see I secretly have an adult baby diaper lover fetish. As soon as I found out what this place could really do I regressed myself back to diapers and never looked back&quot; Zack admitted while smiling at the distant memory.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you actually like being this young?&quot; Doris questioned in disbelief, surprised that someone would go back as far as to not be potty trained. Turning to look at Karen, &quot;Are you an adult baby as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...well not at first, but I have to say after spent some time with Zack I&#39;m really warming up to the idea&quot; Karen confessed, her cheeks reddening slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess I could give being a toddler a try&quot; Doris finally said after seeing how okay the two former adult&#39;s were with their new age.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit&quot; Zack cheered, &quot;Trust me Doris you won&#39;t regret this. Now let me quickly tell you about the others here at the daycare.&quot; Pointing at the two babies not dressed like them but wearing regular clothes. &quot;The 1 year old boy who is crawling around is Toby and the 2 year old girl who is coloring is Sarah. Both are real toddlers whose parents regularly visit the gym. However you should know that David, Toby&#39;s father is more than a little jealous of his son. More often than not he cuts his workouts short and regresses into a baby so he can be taken back here and be care for. Though he can be a bit bratty, what with the way he tries to one up his son, it is entertaining to watch&quot; he explained to Doris who was bewildered a grown man could be so insecure.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about those other two?&quot; she asked gesturing to the remaining babies, a 1 year old boy who was lying on his back and playing with his feet, and a 2 year old who was sitting in front of a tv watching cartoons. &quot; Oh that&#39;s Mark and Tyler, both ab&#39;s like me.&quot; When Zack pointed at each of them in turn Doris learned the 1 year old was Mark and the 2 year old Tyler. &quot;They like to mentally regress so it can be hard to tell them apart from Toby and Sarah sometimes, but regardless they are mature in mind. Watch out for Tyler though, he can be pretty vocal when he needs his diaper changed&quot; Zack informed her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great now that Doris is all caught up can we get back to playing?&quot; Karen pouted a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing Karen. Help us build our tower Doris&quot; Zack said before grabbing some Duplo blocks and sticking them together, Karen following suit. The fun being infectious Doris eagerly joined in. As they played they ended up talking about their personal lives which revealed that Zack was currently attending college and came to the gym during his free time to baby out. Meanwhile Karen was single with a steady job who was single and lived alone. When it was her turn to share Doris  revealed she was divorced and had two children, both being sympathetic when they heard about her ex-husband.<br />
<br />
Working together the trio of toddlers built up and knocked down the Duplo tower multiple times, losing themselves in the repetitive activity.  Eventually as time passed the babies wound up using their diapers and it was...</p>
