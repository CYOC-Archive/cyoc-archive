<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jane smiled to herself as she busied herself with getting the campsite set up. The family had been looking forward to this camping trip for some time now and boy had they timed things perfectly. Beautiful weather and excellent timing for everyone to get a much needed break from school and work. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I think the kids have disappeared. Up for some playing around?&quot; David whispered as he passed his wife, earning a playful smile and swat.<br />
<br />
They continued about their duties for some time until Jane heard a disturbance from behind the tent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well aren&#39;t you something!&quot; David could be heard exclaiming.<br />
<br />
Rounding the tent, Jane found a massive deer. &quot;Oh my, look how big she is!&quot; Jane exclaimed. And certainly, the deer was big, being at least several times the size of any others they had seen. &quot;Here let me get a photo quickly!&quot; Jane pulled her phone out, lined up the shot perfectly and FLASH.<br />
<br />
The deer reared up on its hind legs presenting a massive cock and balls. David and Jane could only blink in disbelief before the animal shot a load of cum over them. Having satisfied its lust, the deer raced off into the woods. As it raced away, the husband and wife could swear they heard odd cracking and stretching noises from the animal&#39;s body. Whatever, that wasn&#39;t important. They needed to get cleaned up.<br />
<br />
David and Jane promptly turned their attention towards washing off the disgusting substance coating them and got changed into some new clothes. Both had just finished getting cleaned up when Mary and Jen returned to camp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey mom and dad, how&#39;s the setup coming along? Almost done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Err, it&#39;s coming along girls.&quot; Jane responded, blushing slightly as she did so. She didn&#39;t want to tell the girls what had happened to her and her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, when are we having dinner? I&#39;m starving!&quot; Mary exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, let me get going on dinner and your father can finish with the campsite. Can you help him Jen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen gave a disgruntled sigh before getting up and following her father. Jane was left to start getting dinner ready. As she was left to her own devices, her thoughts turned back to the animal from earlier. She couldn&#39;t help but feeling a bit turned on at the thoughts. So lewd, Jane thought to herself, trying to push the images from her head. She turned her attention instead to her loving husband and daughter, smiling as she watched them playfully argue in getting one of the tents arranged. She was so lucky to have the two of them. Wait, what was that!<br />
<br />
As David turned towards her, Jane caught sight of a large tent in David&#39;s pants. As Jane continued to watch, the bulge seemed to grow in size. David, for his part, seemed to be ignoring the situation without too much difficulty. Eventually, however, David began getting sloppy. His previously precise movements in setting up the tent became sloppy and disorganized. While little work was progressing with the campsite tent, the same could not be said for that in David&#39;s pants. He was soon sporting a massive erection. A slight grunt emitted from David followed by a dark streak of pre-cum staining the crotch of his jeans. In some distress at this point, David hurriedly excused himself and made a beeline for the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Wanting to make sure her husband was alright, Jane followed David&#39;s lead and tailed him towards the bathroom facilities. Upon entering the small bathroom building, Jane could hear an excited grunting noise from one of the stalls. Seeing the door was slightly ajar, Jane was shocked to see David inside jacking himself off. As he pleasured himself, David&#39;s grunts became more guttural, quickly sounding like those of a wild animal. More shocking was the cock he had wrapped in his hands. Jane had never seen her husband so physically excited or stimulated before. Bracing herself, she entered the stall. &quot;D-David?&quot; Jane asked.<br />
<br />
David spun to face his wife. A wild expression adorned his face, causing Jane to back away. As he gazed upon his wife, however, clarity appeared to return. Looking down at the large. still hard cock, David quickly turned to apologize. &quot;Dear, I&#39;m so sorry. I don&#39;t know what came over me. I -&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jane put a finger to her husband&#39;s lips. &quot;No explanation necessary honey. It&#39;s been a wild afternoon. C&#39;mon let&#39;s get back to the girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she turned to go, Jane&#39;s gaze lingered on her husband&#39;s cock as he pulled up his pants. In no time the flash of heat from earlier was on her. &quot;Oh my god!&quot; jane exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jane?&quot; David asked.<br />
<br />
Jane&#39;s only response was to stiffen up as if she&#39;d been shocked. Hunching over, hands on her knees, Jane tried to recollect herself like earlier. Feeling the heat fade, she moved to follow her husband. &quot;I&#39;m okay honey&quot; she reassured David.<br />
<br />
Before they could leave the stall though, Jane was forced back into her uncomfortable position. With a strained groan, Jane squirted through her jeans onto the floor of the bathroom. David came to his wife&#39;s side, obviously worried about what could be causing her distress. <br />
<br />
&quot;Argh!&quot; The feel of David&#39;s hand on her shoulder felt like electricity, causing another stream of liquid to quickly follow the first. As he focused on his wife, David could see a strange throbbing motion emanating from her crotch. Now soaked through, it appeared as though a small bump was forming in Jane&#39;s jeans. After pushing out, the bulge retreated back into David&#39;s wife&#39;s crotch again. After the bump retreated in and out several times, Jane eventually squatted down as low as she could go, threw her head back and unleashed a torrent of liquid all over the bathroom floor. Catching her breath, Jane turned to her husband. &quot;Oh honey, I don&#39;t know what came over me! I&#39;m so sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
David&#39;s only response was to point at the bump nestled squarely in his wife&#39;s jeans. Following her husband&#39;s direction, Jane looked down and gaped at the foreign object. Reaching down to undo her belt and fly, Jane pulled the pants down to present her new predicament. Hanging from her crotch was a small flaccid cock and balls.</p>
<hr/><h3>
Jane and David looked at each other in horror. What was happening to them?</h3>
