<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">[5 years later]<br />
<br />
You heard a sudden clapping coming from nearby as you did a slow bow in time with your rider. You had just been practicing for an upcoming dressage competition, when it seemed that an old friend had come to spectate.<br />
<br />
“Bravo Princess,” Vicky called out from the stands of the large arena you were training in, “I always knew that you’d become a fine mount with enough training.” You looked at the woman and gave a happy neigh of greeting. This was the woman that was responsible for cursing you, but instead of wanting revenge you instead sought her affection. After all, Princess was a good horse, and good horses always listened to humans. You were built to work and to make your owner’s business profitable, and in your new state-of-mind these things all seemed perfectly reasonable and fair.<br />
<br />
Indeed, during your time at the riding school you had quickly learned how satisfying it was to do things for others. Seeing the happiness on a customer’s face when you took them for long rides or went jumping around the arena always made you feel warm inside. And these moments were made even more special when you were rewarded for your efforts. An extra apple here or a friendly rub on the nose there made you feel appreciated and compelled you to keep working hard to please your masters.<br />
<br />
You naturally saw Vicky as one of your betters as she got up and slowly sauntered towards you. You neighed happily and licked at her hand as she started to stroke under your chin. “That’s my girl,” she said as she continued to gently touch you, “now I wouldn’t mind seeing how much progress you have made since leaving the Stables. Oh and I’ve also had a word with your owner and… let’s just say we’ll be heading for a very special destination; if you behave yourself of course.” You whinnied bluntly as you assured her that you would obey her commands to the letter.<br />
<br />
Vicky simply chuckled before she swapped places with your previous rider. Then, the two of you headed out of the arena and started trotting along down a long track that circled the premises. During that time, Vicky made sure to test your ability to gallop and to jump, whilst also making a note of just how obedient you really were.<br />
<br />
By the end of the hour-long ride you were feeling quite tired and out of breath as you slowly returned to the main yard of the riding school. Vicky seemed to be incredibly impressed with your performance as she patted your neck and fed you numerous tasty horse treats.<br />
<br />
“Well Princess,” Vicky said as she dismounted you, “I was blown away by your efforts. From what I can see, both your training and your attitude are spotless. You have become a true equine role model, and as such you definitely deserve a suitable reward.”<br />
<br />
Hearing the word ‘reward’ brought quick flashbacks of Vicky’s training to mind as you calmly followed her over to a small barn standing in the corner of the yard. As you got closer you were able to guess what your ‘reward’ would involve; having now caught the distinctive scent of a stallion wafting out of the building!<br />
<br />
Vicky halted you outside the entrance where she addressed you again. “As I was saying earlier Princess, you have become something of a prized asset of this riding school. Of course, it is natural for others to show an interest in such a valuable animal, which is why your owner has agreed to implement a new breeding schedule for you!”<br />
<br />
Upon hearing this you whinnied out in excitement. This was yet another opportunity for you to prove your worth and to make your owners happy.<br />
<br />
“Now,” Vicky continued, “I understand that you avoided pregnancy when Toby covered you all those years ago, and that you sadly haven’t been with a stallion since then. Well that is being remedied right now as the first of your suitors is currently waiting for you inside this barn. You will bear this stud’s foal and make your owner a great deal of money, doesn’t that sound great!?”<br />
<br />
You neighed happily as you nodded your head.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Vicky said bluntly, “because after this you already have a ten year-long waiting list of stallions lining up to put their foals in you. This will become another key part of your life as a mare and I trust you will embrace this wonderful gift with open arms. I know mares that would kill to get at a stud like this one, so you should feel privileged that your owner values you so highly.”<br />
<br />
Again you whinnied out in a mix of excitement and pride as you eagerly wanted to get at the nearby stallion and make your masters proud. This burning need to satisfy others manifested physically as your tail moved to the side to reveal your dark equine pussy which hadn’t seen any attention for so long.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Vicky was on hand to remedy this as she moved behind you and gently started to rub your pussy with her thumb, just to get your juices flowing and to put you in the mood.<br />
<br />
This tactic quickly had the desired result as you were soon left dripping and tugging at your lead rope in an effort to reach the male that awaited you. <br />
<br />
Vicky chuckled when she noticed your reaction and decided that it was finally time. She therefore proceeded to remove her thumb before she brought you inside the small breeding barn. Inside, you saw your owner watching you with a broad smile as Vicky led you over to the excited stallion who was tied up nearby.<br />
<br />
The next few minutes were a blur as you faintly remembered intimately getting to know your intended mate. You quickly surrendered to the lust coursing through you after being starved of this emotion ever since leaving the Stables. But now that it was required of you, you put your heart and soul into your courtship display as the desire to please your masters translated into a need to service this handsome stallion.<br />
<br />
As a result, you were soon busy passionately rutting beneath the large stallion as he pounded away at your neglected vagina. Your body now swam with both pleasure and pride as you thought about what a good mare you had become. You looked up whilst still rocking with your mate to see Vicky and your owner chatting and laughing with each other. Both seemed pleased with your performance so far as you worked ever closer towards receiving your first foal.<br />
<br />
With this in mind you shut your eyes as you felt your mate’s penis flare inside you. You knew what was coming as his dick rammed right up against your cervix and started to tremble in anticipation. You could barely contain your excitement as your pussy clenched down over his length and you willed him to give you what you and your owner both wanted.<br />
<br />
Then, you let out a wild cry of glee as you felt a warm splatter of semen suddenly erupt inside you. The tension of the moment instantly dissipated as you came passionately around the stud’s enormous member. Soon, the excess fluid was spilling down your hind legs as the stallion quickly pumped his sticky load inside you.<br />
<br />
And as you felt your mate’s creamy ejaculate pouring into you, you looked back at the two humans nearby. Seeing Vicky and your owner with broad smiles on their faces made you shiver in delight. You could feel your mate’s cum flowing into your womb and in such a large quantity that this time you were certain to get pregnant.<br />
<br />
This thought alone made you give a long lustful sigh of delight. You had made your owner proud once again, and you hoped that you would continue to do so for the rest of your days. You were a good horse after all. You were Princess.</p>
