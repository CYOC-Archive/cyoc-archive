<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brady had found work as a bouncer at the local bar. The job suited him perfectly with his newfound strength. Though his voice was now deep and bovine, he had a knack for handling rowdy patrons with his new hooves. The pay was good, and it helped him feel a bit more normal. If he could just get his singing voice back, life would be perfect. Or so he thought until he saw a poster for an upcoming concert at the bar. The headliner was none other than his ex-girlfriend Hal.<br />
<br />
Hal had been busy forming a new band with Valerie. The two had hit it off and had started dating shortly after Hal arrived on the island. Valerie&#39;s previous life as a bouncer had left her with a tough exterior, but her inner wolf had a gentle heart. Together, they had turned the local bar into a hotspot for anthros looking to let loose and enjoy live music. As they practiced together, Katie couldn&#39;t help but feel a twinge of jealousy. She missed the closeness she had shared with Hal when they were both human, but she knew she had to move on.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Katie&#39;s transformation had slowed down since she had stopped indulging in her new anatomy. She had found a job as a horseback riding instructor at the local stable, which was a surprisingly good fit given her new body. The children loved her, and she found a sense of peace in teaching them. However, she couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something was missing, and the sight of Betsy flaunting her milk-producing assets didn&#39;t help. The cow anthro had become a seductive force on the island, and even the most stoic of anthros couldn&#39;t resist her siren call.<br />
<br />
One evening, after a particularly long day at work, Katie was surprised to find Luke sitting outside their shared barn, his beak buried in a book. He looked up at her, and for a moment, she thought she saw a flicker of the old Luke in his eyes. &quot;Hey, K-&quot; he started to say before she shushed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just K-K-Kate now,&quot; she reminded him, her voice hoarse from the increasingly frequent transformations.<br />
<br />
Luke nodded, his feathers ruffling slightly. &quot;Sorry, Kate. I...I remembered something.&quot; His voice was a mix of excitement and fear.<br />
<br />
Her ears perked up. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remembered my name. It&#39;s Luke,&quot; he said, his eyes welling with tears.<br />
<br />
Kate&#39;s heart swelled. It was the first time she&#39;d heard his voice in weeks that didn&#39;t end with a &quot;ba-cawk.&quot; She knelt beside him, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. &quot;You remembered, Luke?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. &quot;Yeah, I remembered a lot of things, Kate.&quot; His hand trembled as he held up a crumpled piece of paper with the cursed text on it. &quot;But I don&#39;t know if I want to be like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;none of us do, but the damage is done,&quot; Katie said solemnly, taking the paper from him. &quot;We&#39;re all stuck like this, but that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t make the best of it.&quot; She offered a small smile, hoping to encourage him.<br />
<br />
Betsy, ever the seductress, sauntered over, her massive cow teats swaying with each step. &quot;Looks like someone&#39;s feeling a little down,&quot; she purred, her eyes lingering on Kate&#39;s crotch. &quot;Why don&#39;t you come over here and let me help you feel a little better?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate rolled her eyes, but she couldn&#39;t deny the temptation. With a sigh, she approached Betsy, who wasted no time in getting down on her knees, her mouth watering at the sight of Kate&#39;s ever-growing horse cock. Betsy began to tease the tip with her tongue, whispering sweet nothings that Kate had never heard from her before. The sensation was overwhelming, and Kate&#39;s body responded instinctively, her horse cock swelling even more. Betsy&#39;s eyes gleamed with victory as Kate&#39;s transformation sped up, his body becoming more masculine before their very eyes.<br />
<br />
Brady, on the other hand, had been spending his time at the bar, trying to drown his sorrows in work and the occasional pint. One night, a new face caught his eye—a beautiful anthro doe named Flora. Her delicate antlers and soft brown fur were a stark contrast to his bulky bull frame, but her gentle demeanor and sweet laughter had him smitten from the first moment. He approached her, his moos now replaced with a deep, gruff bellow, and they hit it off immediately. Flora saw beyond his bovine exterior and into the kind, caring soul that was still Brady.<br />
<br />
Their first kiss was like a lightning bolt, jolting Brady back to reality. He realized that maybe he could love again, even if it wasn&#39;t with Hal. They started to date in secret, exploring the abandoned parts of the island and sharing stories of their old lives. Flora had been a college student, studying environmental science, before she had stumbled upon the cursed text. Her transformation had left her with a set of antlers she could never hide, but she had learned to accept them as a part of who she was now.<br />
<br />
The four of them, now closer than ever despite their new forms, decided to visit the island&#39;s college. It had once been a bustling hub of learning, but now it was a shadow of its former self, filled with anthros who had been transformed by the text and had nowhere else to go. They hoped to find answers or at least some semblance of normalcy. As they walked through the empty halls, Kate couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of loss. This was the kind of place she had dreamed of attending, studying and growing as a musician.<br />
<br />
after returning to the barm katie entered her room. as she aporched her bed the door slammed shut. She turned to see Betsy leaning against it. &quot;you know, I know you miss it&quot; Betsy smirked as she saunters closer to Kate. &quot;Miss what?&quot; Kate replied, her heart racing.<br />
<br />
&quot;That cock of yours,&quot; Betsy said, her eyes gleaming with mischief. &quot;I can see it growing every time I talk to you. It&#39;s like you want to become more... equine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate swallowed hard, trying to fight the urge that was building inside her. &quot;I-I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be shy,&quot; Betsy purred, her hands moving to her own chest and giving it a squeeze. Her fingers played with the piercings on her nipples, drawing Kate&#39;s eyes to the pool of milk gathering between her cow-like breasts. &quot;We all have our needs, Kate. And you&#39;re just one good ride away from being all stallion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate&#39;s breath hitched as Betsy approached, the smell of milk and musk filling the room. She couldn&#39;t help the way her body responded, her cock growing harder and longer as Betsy&#39;s eyes remained locked on it. &quot;Betsy, please,&quot; she begged, but the cow mutant was relentless.<br />
<br />
With a wicked smile, Betsy reached out and grabbed Kate&#39;s cock, her hand sliding up and down the shaft. &quot;Come on,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Just let go. Give in to the change.&quot; Kate&#39;s legs began to buckle as the pleasure grew, the fur began to spread from her wasit up. the muscles underneath growing to match her equine legs.<br />
<br />
As Kate felt her body begin to change again, she couldn&#39;t help but moan. Betsy took this as an invitation to go further. She began to stroke Kate&#39;s cock faster and faster, her other hand cupping Kate&#39;s tightening balls. The sensation was too much for Kate to handle, and she came with a roar, her semen spurting out in a thick, hot stream. Each spurt seemed to accelerate the transformation, her body convulsing as it took on the form of a powerful stallion. Her human torso grew broader and more muscular, her shoulders bulging with newfound strength. Her skin turned to a sleek, dark coat, and her chest grew hairier, matching the fur that now covered her entire lower half.<br />
<br />
The sound of her orgasm echoed through the room, and Kate felt a wave of pleasure and dread wash over her as she looked down at her new body. Her breasts had flattened into a firm, broad chest, her waist narrowed, and her arms and legs had become more defined, with the muscles of a well-trained horse. The fur grew denser, enveloping her fully as her human features continued to shift. Her nose and mouth elongated into a snout, and her teeth grew sharp and pointed. Her ears grew tall and pointed, and her eyes, now a deep brown, were filled with a fiery lust she had never felt before.<br />
<br />
Betsy&#39;s eyes sparkled with triumph as she watched Kate&#39;s transformation. She had never seen such a beautiful stallion before, and she couldn&#39;t wait to feel Kate&#39;s new cock inside her. &quot;You&#39;re so perfect,&quot; she murmured, her own arousal growing with every passing second. Kate, or rather, the anthro horse that was once Katie, panted heavily, his new body feeling alien and yet incredibly powerful. He looked down at his human hands, now replaced by strong hooves, and felt a sense of panic rising within him.<br />
<br />
he rushed to the mirror on his wall, staring in disbelief at his new reflection. His eyes were wide with shock as he saw his human hands were now thick and each one had a mini hoof at the end of his fingers. His skin was still his own, but a soft fur had started to cover his chest, and his abs had morphed into a defined, almost equine form. his long hair had merged with his neck to become a mane. his head was almost identical to that of a real horse, except for his piercing human eyes and his expressive features.<br />
<br />
he was hoping he&#39;d have a long time before he was stuck like this. But with Betsy&#39;s relentless teasing and the curse of the text, he was now fully a stallion. His mind was still his own, but the urges were overwhelming. He felt like a beast, trapped in a cage of his own making. &quot;Betsy, what have you done?&quot; he whispered hoarsely, his new voice a mix of fear and anger.<br />
<br />
betsy too this as an invite for round two, &quot;You look so handsome, Kate,&quot; she said, her voice dripping with desire. She stepped closer, her own hands reaching out to caress the new muscles of Kate&#39;s anthro horse body. &quot;Don&#39;t be scared. It&#39;s just us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate&#39;s mind was a whirlwind of confusion and arousal. He had never felt so alive, so primal. His horse cock was still hard and pulsing with need. He knew what Betsy wanted, and part of him, the part that was still Katie, was repulsed by the idea. But the new part of him, the stallion, craved it. He stepped back, trying to regain control, but his legs trembled and his cock grew even harder.<br />
<br />
He took a deep breath, trying to calm the storm raging within him. His thoughts grew clearer as he looked at Betsy, her eyes filled with a mix of desire and challenge. &quot;I... I need to think,&quot; he managed to say, his voice a gruff whisper. Betsy just smirked, her hands moving to her own breasts, playing with the piercings that Kate had once found so alluring.<br />
<br />
With a snort, Kate realized that he could no longer think of himself as Katie. The stallion side of him had taken over, and he had to accept it. He looked down at his new form, the powerful muscles and the proud stance of a creature made for one thing: to fuck and procreate. &quot;From now on,&quot; he said, his voice deep and resonant, &quot;call me... Kai.&quot; The name felt right, a mix of his old self and his new identity.<br />
<br />
Betsy&#39;s smirk grew wider as she took a step back. &quot;Very well, Kai,&quot; she purred, her voice thick with lust. &quot;I see the stallion in you is awake now.&quot; She reached for the zipper on her own pants, her hand slipping it down to reveal her wet, swollen pussy. &quot;Let&#39;s see what you&#39;ve got.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kai felt a surge of primal instinct wash over him as he watched Betsy expose herself. He knew what she wanted, what she needed. And despite the fear and confusion, there was a part of him that was eager to give it to her. He took a step closer, his massive cock bobbing with each movement. He could feel the power in his new body, the need to claim what was his. The human part of him screamed for him to stop, but the stallion was in control now.<br />
<br />
With a snarl, Kai grabbed Betsy by the waist and hoisted her onto the bed. She giggled with excitement as he positioned himself between her legs, his cock pressing against her entrance. The room was filled with the scent of their arousal, and the tension was palpable. He looked into her eyes, searching for any hint of regret, but all he saw was desire. &quot;Ready?&quot; he asked, his voice barely human.<br />
<br />
Betsy nodded eagerly, her eyes glazed over with lust. &quot;Do it,&quot; she begged. &quot;Make me feel alive again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kai didn&#39;t need any more encouragement. With a powerful thrust, he entered her, his cock filling her to the brim. She screamed out in pleasure as he began to pump into her, his hips moving with the grace of a seasoned stallion. Each stroke brought him closer to the brink of his own climax, and he knew that with it, he would become more and more like the creature he was turning into. But in that moment, he didn&#39;t care. All he knew was that he was alive, and he was going to fuck like he had never fucked before.</p>
