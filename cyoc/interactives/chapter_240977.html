<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You walk back to the living room and see Chandler still sitting on the couch. He’s scrolling through his phone looking unbothered or worried about anything. Did he really not care that he was now at your mercy?<br />
<br />
“Oh, hey. Finished reading the instructions?” he asks you calmly after spotting you standing in front of him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. You know you could’ve warned me that the things I bought were defective,” you angrily respond while crossing your arms and glaring at him.<br />
<br />
Chandler shrugs and folds his arms behind his head before leaning back against the couch. “Well, considering I was the one using the ring, I didn’t see a reason to tell you. Besides, I took precaution for all of the warnings.”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure?”<br />
<br />
“Positive.”<br />
<br />
You give him a smirk. “I guess you forgot about the part where using the ring multiple times in a row would cause excess magical energy to affect the ring-bearer.”<br />
<br />
Chandler looked at a loss as he looks at you with a dazed expression. He DEFINITELY forgot about this flaw.<br />
<br />
Eventually Chandler pulls himself together and returns to giving you a neutral look. “Well, I guess nothing really happened to me because I still look and feel the same.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe, but not for long,” you say as you try to decide on what to do with Chandler. Perhaps it was time to take inspiration from the man himself. “Chandler, you can only tell the truth from now on.”<br />
<br />
Chandler continues to look at you with the same neutral expression. His lack of response was starting to get on your nerves. Part of it was from the fact that nothing you were doing was getting to him. The other part stemmed from jealousy of his calm composure compared to the outbursts you had when Chandler was in control of the ring.<br />
<br />
“Ok, take off all of your clothing and then sit back on the couch in front of me. Don’t attempt to hide or conceal your body while doing this,” you say. <br />
<br />
Chandler gets up and begins taking off his clothes, not looking very bothered by the command. He throws his clothing all over the ground and then sits back on the couch in the same position, exposing himself quite clearly to you.<br />
<br />
“Aren’t you bothered by this?” you ask him.<br />
<br />
“Not really,” he replies.<br />
<br />
You examine Chandler. You never noticed it before, but your roommate has a good body. He works out a lot so he has two nice pecs and a defined set of abs. Chandler’s kinda lanky so he’s not too muscular. However, his limbs are still full of muscle definition. He’s also pretty tall, around 6’ 6” if you remembered correctly, making him 6 inches taller than you. His dick isn’t as big as your own, but it’s still a decent 5 inches. And it’s pretty thick too. Chandler’s also good looking. He has short blonde hair in a side-part hairstyle that suits him and a pair of hazel eyes that make him look more alluring. His face is also clear of any blemishes and he also has a defined jawline. Chandler is not a very hairy guy, only with a light amount of hair over his arms and legs; his chest, stomach, and crotch are completely smooth. In spite of lacking a lot of body hair, he still has a nice shadow over his face that helps accentuate his masculinity.<br />
<br />
Now that you think about it, you wonder why Chandler always struggled to get a date for Valentine’s. He was a nice guy, and he was pretty decent in the looks department, so you were sure he could have any girl he wanted. Yet, for some reason, he always told you that he struggled to find a date. You wonder why.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Chandler. Is it true you could never find a date?”<br />
<br />
Chandler looks at you with the first hint of concern he’s shown all morning before answering. “No. It isn’t true. Plenty of girls have always asked me out.”<br />
<br />
“Then how come you never dated any of them?”<br />
<br />
“I mean, I’m bi, so I don’t find them unattractive. It’s just… I always had someone else in mind.”<br />
<br />
Chandler was bisexual? You had always thought he was straight before everything that had occurred this weekend with the collar and the ring. After what happened, you just straight-up assumed he was gay. Looks like you were half-right each time. “Who is it?”<br />
<br />
Chandler looks away from you, a blush now apparent on his face, before speaking. “You, dude. I’ve always had a crush on you ever since we first met.”<br />
<br />
“Me!?” you exclaim in surprise.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’ve liked you for a long time. All that stuff I said in bed last night was true. I’ve always found you attractive and I really like your personality and stuff.” Chandler’s face has gone bright red as he admits this.<br />
<br />
You can’t help but find yourself going red too, your face blushing furiously from his confession. It was true that he had admitted he liked you last night, but that felt shallow and more as an effect from being in the moment of having sex. Now that you had a clear mind, it was definitely hitting you that your roommate had always had a crush on you.<br />
<br />
“You l-like me?” you awkwardly ask him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I do.” Chandler looks back at you, face still burning brightly, but a defiant look to him as he boldly expresses his feelings.<br />
<br />
“Oh… I, uh…” You don’t know what to say. You’re straight. At least you thought you were straight, but all this stuff you did the last two days was beginning to make you question yourself. And your roommate admitting his long-held enamoration for you certainly didn’t help.<br />
<br />
“Umm…” You continue to make eye contact with Chandler and feel your heart start to beat a little faster. This whole situation was starting to make you feel weird. Ironically, none of it was being caused from using the ring and collar or from the fact that you were both completely nude.<br />
<br />
You had to change the topic… and fast! <br />
<br />
“Chandler, what would you say is your biggest kink?” you ask him.</p>
