<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zach slipped out of his tent unnoticed as he was alone.  With new fur that matched the pitch-black sky to perfection, no human eye could have possibly detected the presence of the panther-man.  With the nearly supernatural grace and stealth of a feline, he stalked through the camp to Dan's tent and went inside without making a sound.<br />
<br />
Even through the darkness, Zach could clearly his beautiful, ruggedly handsome Dan slumbering under his covers.  A half-smile came to his new muzzle, and he caught himself emitting a low, quiet purr.  He tip-toed toward Dan and kneeled down low.  Very cautiously he took off the medallion and slipped it around Dan's neck, taking great care to avoid disturbing the man's sleep.  He found himself growing excited, and his heart pounded, knowing all too well what was about to happen to the man.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Dan's dreams were extremely pleasant that night.  He dreamed of the savannah in Africa; of the blazing red sun at sunset, the dance of the antelope, and the intense primal beauty in the lion.  In his dream, he was the predator; he was the lion.  He stalked his prey across the fields, away from the haven of the watering hole.  The intense smell of his prey made him hunger; within seconds, he was atop his prey, sinking his claws and teeth into the flesh of the antelope who was to become his dinner.  A successful hunt.<br />
<br />
Images and scenery blurred together.  The lion was sharing his meal with a panther.  There was no rivalry between them; he ate with the panther as a mate.  The black panther indeed was male, something which was not unusual to Dan; this he kept well-hidden from his archaeological team.  He and the panther satisfied their appetites on the meat of the antelope.  They began to lie together, nuzzling gently.  Dan closed his lion eyes ...<br />
<br />
... and opened them again.  This time the panther was much larger; much more human-like.  Dan was human again now.  He gazed into the loving eyes of the panther who was stroking Dan's bare chest sending shivers of pleasure down his spine.  Each stroke began to feel more pleasant; he watched trails of fur begin to grow on his chest.  So he was becoming the lion again in the dream, he thought.  He allowed himself to relax, spreading himself out for the panther to do as he will.  The panther's hands moved across Dan's body, lightly massaging as the golden tawny fur grew back in to the proper short length.<br />
<br />
Dan offered a smile to the dream panther; he leaned forward to touch his nose to the black feline's.  For a moment, the touch felt like magic, like a romance that was destined for the movies and beyond.  He felt his own nose starting to grow a bit longer and flat at the tip as a soft, moist nose pad appeared among his facial features.  Dan's heart thumped in his chest, and he decided to make his move.  With a sudden burst of bold daring, he closed his eyes and locked lips with the panther-man, just as he felt the tingle of his fur spreading to cover every inch of his body.  Together he and the feline breathed as one, intimately sharing kisses and tongue.  Dan really did not mind that his jaw and nose were expanding to give him a feline-shaped muzzle.  It was a dream, after all.  With his eyes closed, he couldn't see his hair becoming shaggy and longer, starting to cover his neck and shoulders, down to his chin.  A full lion's mane, nearly brown in color, distinguished him as a relative to a true lion.  The image was improved by a pair of feline ears poking out through his new mane.<br />
<br />
With the panther-man enraptured by the intimacy of a kiss, Dan began to feel stronger and more dominant.  He withdrew his muzzle, planting a few more quick kisses on the lips of his panther lover.  With a great, toothy smile, he crawled around behind the panther and gently coaxed him to lie belly-down on the mattress.  He sat up a little straighter, and reached a more well-muscled arm over to begin stroking the back of the dark feline.  Mere stroking turned into a scratching sort of rub.  A quick, temporary numbness in his fingertips made him aware that they too were changing; within moments, a set of retractible claws had replaced the human fingertips of his hands.  With these claws, he started to lightly tease his panther, very carefully scratching them along the back of the panther's tough hide.  When his fingers reached the small of the panther's back, he hesitated momentarily, considering the twitching, swaying tail attached to his lover.  Without Dan even realizing it, a tail of his own had begun to grow behind him; long, slender, and tawny, it ended with a dark brown tuft typical of a member of his species.<br />
<br />
Dan sheathed his claws, digging his fingers into his panther's fur, down to his rump and the base of his tail, causing the panther to let out a surprised gasp and a moan of pleasure.  The panther arched his rear into the air, tail held up erect.  Sensing an opportunity, Dan moved back on his knees.  The sudden need to stretch his legs hit him like a Florida rain storm at that very moment; pressing his hands against the mattress, he stretched out each leg, one at a time, feeling his feet lengthen and calves shorten.  Each foot grew more broad near the end by the toes; they were recognizeable only as lion hind paws attached to legs from that moment onward.<br />
<br />
With his mind no longer distracted by his own body, he slid his chest up along the panther-man's backside, minding the medallion around his own neck.  As he felt himself grow aroused, Dan's cock took on a much more feline shape, minus the barbs typical of a lion's equipment.  A sheath seemed to have formed around it, but as the penis was already fully erect, he paid no attention.  Taking careful aim, Dan moved his lion member to the crack of the panther man's rump.  Grasping the panther's shoulders, he thrusted his pelvis against his panther, causing the black feline to let out a quiet hissing gasp.  The panther seemed to be letting off his scent a bit more with his own arousal; to Dan's surprise, he recognized the panther as Zach.  This fact only made the experience better for him.<br />
<br />
Picking up pace, Dan pushed his cock fully into Zach's rear.  His panther mate seemed not to let out any cries of protest; even if he had, the scent of his arousal would have given away his true feelings for Dan.  Mindful of his lover's thin, black tail, the lion man thrust himself repeatedly deep inside Zach.  The panther cried out a loud moan as Dan's cock pressed against his prostate; barely able to contain himself, Zach found himself rapidly stroking his own cock.  Soon Dan felt a rush of pleasure and warmth fill his groin; letting out one roar of a moan, he shot his lion cum into Zach; as he did, he leaned his body forward, biting down lightly on his panther's neck.  Zach himself couldn't bear it any longer once his neck was nipped, and his semen shot all over his silky black fur, leaving him in an exhausted, slightly weakened state.<br />
<br />
The larger lion man withdrew his cock from Zach a minute later.  Letting out a soft, non-verbal grunt, he leaned himself forward over Zach's chest and began to groom, licking the cum from the otherwise black coat of fur.  This gave Zach a chance to lie back and relax, silently telling himself that this was the best decision he ever made in his life.  This period of calm didn't last long, however, for Dan seemed ready for action once more.  However, this time he removed the medallion from his neck, setting it beside the mattress.  Once again, Dan began to stimulate Zach to prepare them both for another round of mating.<br />
<br />
For a few hours, this cycle continued on into the night.  Eventually the lion and the panther were sleeping in a spoon position; Dan kept his strong leonine arms around his panther Zach, keeping him close and warm throughout the night.<br />
<br />
Waking up in the morning with his arms around a panther man that he recognized as Zach, and a coat of fur covering himself, he realized for the first time that he had been awake ever since seeing the humanoid panther over him for the first time.</p>
