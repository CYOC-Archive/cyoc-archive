<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Uhh, while I am no expert on the subject of child birth, so I can&#39;t say for certain, but I doubt that that is true, plus with your size, I think you may just end up breaking it. Can&#39;t you just make it come out easily or something? Like make my pussy able to stretch open wide enough for it, or have it just teleport out of my womb.&quot; Suggested Dan while mentally still repeating his mantra about the egg not being his child. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was the point, I would break it with my cock as I fuck you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dan subtly moved a hand down towards his pussy to block its enterance and began moving to leave the room. His sister seemed off and to have no intention of letting his egg be laid intact and painlessly. Now being driven by motherly instincts, Dan&#39;s body was planning on protecting the egg to the death. &quot;Actually, never mind sis. I so sorry to have bothered you.&quot; And with that Dan slipped out of the room, closing the door behind him, and made his way over to his bathroom.<br />
<br />
Kat was stuck. She was angry that Dan didn&#39;t let her fuck him, but couldn&#39;t blame him for his actions because she herself had made him act so much like a protective mother. She basically had just blue balled herself, and was not enjoying the experience, nearly breaking out in tears. Everything was her fault. If she was somewhat nicer, maybe he wouldn&#39;t have gotten scared for the egg&#39;s safety and ran. Maybe he wouldn&#39;t have minded letting her fuck him. If she didn&#39;t just torment him, she could have been fucking him by now. In her onslaught of self degradation, she had overlooked that her current infatuation with her brother was entirely due to a backfired spell, and not her genuine feelings. Why didn&#39;t she just get his egg out of him like he suggested? She could have easily done it too. But noooo, her dumb pride got in the way and wanted to destroy the egg which he wanted to protect even if it kills him in the process. &quot;Ahhhhh why am I such an idiot!!!!&quot; She screemed in a fit of tears.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Dan was doing his best to ignore his sister&#39;s random wailing. He couldn&#39;t make out what she was saying, but there was no way in hell that was he going to check up on her. Dan had looked up home deliveries for babys and a few articles had said to do it in the bath with warm water. Having already drawn the bath, he undressed himself, tossing his soaking wet clothes down the laundry shoot. Milk was still steadily pouring out of his nipples. The rate wasn&#39;t fast enough to spray it out, but the 2 white streams running down his body said enough about his production rate.<br />
<br />
Carefully Dan slid into the tub, which sadly began turning foggy from all the milk pouring in. The water felt nice against his pussy too. For the first time today, he could finally relax and recollect himself. For 1, was he still considered even a male anymore? Sure he had a nice package, but he also was pregnant, had a pussy, and was lactating. Plus he sorta found certain dicks extremely attractive now, specifically his sisters for some reason. <br />
<br />
Just imagining it started to turn him on. And with nothing else to do, he began stroking his cock. But no matter how much he stroked it, he couldnt get close to how it had felt to be fucked. To have his pussy filled with a cock had felt so good, everything else now feels meh, at best. Sure he could get hard stroking his cock, but that was about it. The pleasure hadn&#39;t decreased at all, but his frame of reference had, quite drastically too.<br />
<br />
Desperately, he teased a finger into his pussy. The moment he touched it, the feeling had already dwarfed all of his efforts over the last several minutes. Was this the future for his sex life? Being fucked like a bitch in heat, just to lay a massive egg afterwards? Dan slumped down further into the water, which by now had turned completly opaque from the milk. Even though he was feeling miserable, his finger continued to play with his slit, slowly building up his orgasm. The pleasure was a mixture of  satisfaction, humiliation, comfort, relief, and frustration. He had never hated feeling so good before, and yet he still proceeded to slipped another 2 fingers inside his pussy.<br />
<br />
This however triggered another one of Kat&#39;s spells to activate. This perticular spell made Dan begin speaking like a bimbo slut, even though mentally he remained unchanged. It also made his voice match his new speach patters, becomming very feminine. The last thing it did was make Dan extremely prone to speaking his own thoughts out loud, and in the third person. &quot;Haghhh.. hahhh... ahhhhhh. Ha.. ha.. ha.. Dani feels like, so good! Ah..... Dani&#39;s voice! Like, what is up with Dani&#39;s voice. Dani totally sounds like a slutty bimbo, and can Dani like, NOT speak in the third person? It like makes Dani sound like totally stupid. Dani. Dani. Dani!!! Dani can&#39;t like, say Dani? A, B, C, D, E, F, G ,H, Dani, J..... Did Kat like seriously replace the letter Dani, with like Dani&#39;s own name? Dani&#39;s name is Dani. It is spelled D, A, N , Dani... Dany guesses she like,  seriously did! Can like, Dani&#39;s day get like any worse, hummmp.&quot; Dani sank down even lower, now having the water sit just under her nose. Bubbles from her constant moaning regularly surfaced too.</p>
