<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff wasn&#39;t sure about this decision. Who would be his perfect girlfriend? How would she be? Maybe she could be british, african. Some of his girl friends are french, and he likes their way of being, so maybe his ideal girl had to be french. But what about other aspects?. With all the power of change reality he was overwhelmed.<br />
<br />
He was so lost in this thoughts that he didn&#39;t notice an empty can of soda on the floor and stumbled with it. <br />
<br />
What was that soda can doing there? His father and him had a schedule of cleaning and it was his father&#39;s turn, or maybe his, anyway, it wasn&#39;t supposed to be there. <br />
<br />
He started brushing away the dirt from the living room and saw a lot of trash that had to be removed, even the printed calendar of cleaning was in the floor.  Both him and his father needed a lot of discipline, and creating his girlfriend had to wait.<br />
<br />
In that moment he had an amazing idea:<br />
<br />
He could create the perfect girlfriend AND someone that could put order in the house, all in the same person.<br />
<br />
<br />
He created a new project on the Chronivac and started the job.<br />
<br />
Selected target: John Kendrick<br />
<br />
The Chronivac showed a lot of details that could be edited.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Jeff had to set up the parameters of the change before rewriting the details. So he did.<br />
<br />

Transforming back duration: 1 hour<br />
<br />
Start time of transformation: 6 PM<br />

<br />
Then he erased all of his father details and started to fill the blanks<br />
<br />

<br />
Mental Change …<br />
<br />
Jeff saw that he could set up different levels of mental change. From leaving the memory completely intact up to erase everything and put something completely new.<br />
<br />
Doubt got him again to decide, and when he was about to choose an option, something interrupted.<br />
<br />
—Hey Pal, I&#39;m home. —Said his father opening the house door.<br />
<br />
Jeff went back to the programming just to see that on the Chronivac screen it was a &quot;Starting process at 6pm&quot; message.<br />
<br />
I know this doesn’t happen often —Said his father lying on the couch—. But I’m really tired, today was too busy, so I’m gonna take a snap on the couch, I bought pizza if you want.<br />
<br />
Jeff wasn&#39;t paying attention, he was trying to find out what did he put at the final blank, and if possible, cancel it. But the Chronivac just sent the same message on the screen: “Selected options cannot be seen or changed until the transformation ends”<br />
<br />
It was 5:58, so the only thing that he could do was wait and see what did he do.<br />
<br />
Nothing seemed to happen until he saw his father&#39;s wardrobe glowing some kind of light.<br />
<br />
Where there were shirts and formal suits, now only remained black dresses.<br />
<br />
The clean and polished shoes were now black high heels. Next to them, stocking that used to be socks.<br />
<br />
Even the underwear turned into pieces of lingerie.<br />
<br />
Anyone who saw that wardrobe would think it&#39;s owned by a woman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jeff went downstairs to see how his father was changing, his body was covered by a similar light.<br />
<br />
Apparently the clothes that he was wearing didn&#39;t change, but they seem to be bigger due to John&#39;s body that was slowly shrinking.<br />
<br />
His chest was the first that changed, they didn&#39;t shrink, but grow in an specific way, just to form two round boobs.<br />
<br />
Then John&#39;s abdomen and stomach started to get in shape, followed by his hips that added the final touch to be the hourglass body.<br />
<br />
Arms and legs were next, first losing hair, getting smaller and completing the neck down girl body.<br />
<br />
Only the head was missing to transform. John started losing his beard and his hair started growing at the same time it was getting colored and curly. His facial features got more girly, his eyelashes grew a bit and some red lipstick appeared over his lips.<br />
<br />
Everything was done. There was a french girl wearing a businessman suit sleeping on the sofa.<br />
<br />
Time passes really fast when you see your father being turned into a girl. When Jeff saw his cellphone it was 6:59 pm, so apparently all changes have ceased.<br />
<br />
<br />
At 7pm the cute girl lying on the sofa woke up suddenly<br />
<br />
—OMGosh don’t tell be I fell asleep again, there is a lot of work to do. —Said the girl looking at Jeff.<br />
He didn’t know what to answer, but it didn’t matter, before he could make a sound the girl started to speak again.<br />
<br />
—I don’t know why I’m wearing this, I need to change before I start. —She said going upstairs and being followed by Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn’t know was was he doing, spying on how his DAD was changing clothes, but he was still there, seeing out of the corner of his eye behind his father&#39;s bedroom.<br />
<br />
Even he couldn&#39;t see her putting the lingerie, he saw how this girl was putting her stocking, a clean dress and a pair of heels. Then she started cleaning that room.<br />
<br />
She was quite fast, in 20 minutes that bedroom was done, apparently one of the portfolios turned into a vacuum cleaner, and that was very useful for her. She came out of the room and ignoring that Jeff was standing outside she went to his room, just to finish it just as fast.<br />
<br />
Next she went to the living room and started with the dust and then picked up everything that was thrown. That was when she saw the calendar that Jeff and his father created and kept staring at it.<br />
<br />
Jeff approached her, thinking of what could be the best first words to exchange with this new girl. Definitely a good maid, maybe his girlfriend, formerly his father.<br />
<br />
—Clara?. —Was the was the only word that went through his mind. The name that he decided for his perfect girlfriend.<br />
<br />
<br />
—Who is Clara? son. The girl answered with her sweet french accent.</p>
