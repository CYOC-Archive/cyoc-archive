<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the past hour Kellie had been nervously gazing across the street, waiting for Katie to come home. She had come up with a simple, yet clever plan. When Katie got home home she would go outside and act like she was moving in. Hopefully she could catch her attention and strike up a conversation. That part of the plan was simple, as far as what she would say though she had no idea.<br />
<br />
“You should really stop pacing,” Merlin said. Kellie turned nervously seeing her old friend lazily lounging in an easy chair drinking tea. “Easy for you to say,” she grumbled. “What am I going to say to her, hi remember me I’m your old mom slash girlfriend, sorry I was an emotional teenage bitch and erased you from existence.”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t lead with that,” Merlin smirked. “Just say hi and relax you’ll do fine, you always have since I’ve known you.”<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed looking out the window once more. Merlin had a point, as angry as she was with herself for her actions ten years ago she just needed to be herself. She had done this so many times over the years in her adventures with Merlin that it was second nature at this point. Merlin had told her now she was a natural when it came to reality hopping. She was quick to think and trusted her instincts, those instincts always seemed to point her in the right direction. After all the realities her and Merlin had jumped through this should be easy enough. As Kellie thought about it though she realized it wouldn’t be that easy.<br />
<br />
“Your tense Kellie,” Merlin sighed. “I know that this is a situation you never expected to be in. I know you still beat yourself up over erasing Katie and Lisa and well......screwing up reality. Here’s the thing though, no one is perfect. You made a mistake. Everyone does and you’ve learned from it. I know that you are truly sorry, which is the reason your here. Just be yourself. No matter what happens I’m proud of you.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled as she looked at the ancient wizard. “Look at you getting all mushy in your old age,” she smirked. “But thank you. Coming from you...that...that makes me feel great. It’s weird but...your the closest thing I have to family now.”<br />
<br />
Merlin smiled as he looked warmly at his apprentice. “Your welcome Kellie,” he smiled. “So does that mean I have to pay for your wedding? If I’m family I’m guessing that would be something I would have to do.”<br />
<br />
Kellie laughed at his joke, shaking her head. “Still 16 Merlin we’re not worrying about that for a LONG time.”<br />
<br />
The sound of a car racing down the street grabbed Kellies attention. Turning, she saw the a Toyota screech to a stop in front of Katie’s house. Curiously she watched as a red teen jumped from the passengers seat followed closely by an Asian girl with a red stripe in her hair. Kellie gasped sharply as she looked at the red head girl. “Lisa,” she whispered. “Oh my god it’s her! She...she looked exactly like she did when she was 16 the last time.” Kellie watched as the teen laughed and joked with her friend causing Kellie to smirk. “Acts exactly like she did at 16 too,” she grinned. “But what is she doing with Mika? And why does Mika have a stripe in her hair?”<br />
<br />
“That’s not Mika,” Merlin smiled. “That’s Kumiko. Mika’s twin.”<br />
<br />
“Wait Kumiko is Mika’s twin now!!!!”<br />
<br />
“Told you you messed reality up pretty good,”<br />
<br />
Kellie stared dumbfounded as the two wild teens raced into the house. She couldn’t believe how things had changed so drastically. As she continued to watch she gasped as a pale blond girl exited the back of the car. “Katie,” she whispered. “Oh god Merlin it’s her.” Merlin smiled as he watched Kellie nervously began to fidget in place. “Well,” he said. “Maybe you should go introduce yourself. And remember just be yourself.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled nervously as she exited her home. Exhaling deeply she now walked towards the moving van, keeping an eye on Katie. The honey haired teen could feel herself breaking into a cold sweat as she looked at Katie. She was still unable to even think of something to say if by chance Katie noticed her. As she grabbed a box out of the truck she could hear someone calling. “Did you just move in,” the voice said. Turning Kellie could see Katie giving her an inquisitive loook.<br />
<br />
“Ummm Yeah,” Kellie said shyly. “Me and my Uh grandfather just bought it. I’m Kellie.”<br />
<br />
“I’m Katie,”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled meekly as Katie now approached curiously looking at the moving van. “Uh I didn’t even know the old woman had put the house up for sale,” she mused. “It was Uh a short sale,” Kellie responded quickly. “My Uh grandpa grew up in the area and wanted to retire here so we bought it on short notice.”<br />
<br />
The two teens now looked at each other in silence searching for words. “So is that your house,” Kellie asked, feeling somewhat foolish for asking. Katie nodded as she gestured towards her home. “Yeah that’s where I live,” she said. “It’s me, my sister Lisa, and my aunt Ann.”<br />
<br />
“Neat,” Kellie answered feeling her cheeks burn slightly. <br />
<br />
“So how old are you anyway Kellie,” Katie asked.<br />
<br />
 “Sixteen,” Kellie answered. “I start tomorrow. How is it over there anyway?”<br />
<br />
“It’s okay,” Katie shrugged. “Nothing special I guess.”<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded looking Katie over. She wanted to gush to the girl about how much she had missed her but realized she would have no memory of anything they had previously done together. As she looked at Katie she realized she was wearing the Ring of Age. “Wow that’s a really nice ring,” Kellie exclaimed. “Where did you get it?”<br />
<br />
“I Uh found it,” Katie said shyly drawing her hand behind her back. “It’s uh kinda a secret though I Uh haven’t shown anyone it.”<br />
<br />
Kellie paused and blushed realizing Katie was still learning about its power and was apprehensive about even showing anyone. “Oh okay,” Kellie said, somewhat defeated. “I um didn’t mean to um...” she trailed off unable to find the words to finish.<br />
<br />
“No it’s okay,” Katie said, feeling bad for acting rude. “I’m sorry I didn’t mean to be rude I Uh I well...it’s complicated and hard to explain.”<br />
<br />
“No worries,” Kellie said, smiling. “I understand.”<br />
<br />
The two girls smiled at each other once again at a loss for words. Kellie could see Katie looking her over. The girl seems confused as if she recognized Kellie but couldn’t put her finger on it. From Kellies perspective she could see that Katie’s was now trying to size her up and make a decision on if she wanted to get to know this girl. “Hey listen,” Katie said. “Don’t know if you’d be interested but would you like to come over for a bit and hangout? It would be nice to have someone to talk with while my sister and her friend are over.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled and nodded eagerly, feeling a tremendous amount of butterflies in her stomach. “Sure sound s like fun,” she said clearing her throat. Katie smiled as she now began to cross the street with Kellie in pursuit. As Kellie turned towards her new home she’s could see Merlin smile and nod letting Kellie know he wished her the best a smile she reintroduced herself to her friends.</p>
