<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(AN: The joke is that I meant them to be the Perkins house cause that's the last place the <br />
big bad wolf pack would EVER go back to IMHO.) <br />
<br />
The word did not matter, her choice of words did not matter, just as they did not matter <br />
with Madam Serenity or Trevor. All that mattered, was that Alice's gift for understanding <br />
language now hers by the curse itself had served her flawlessly: a Transform from the <br />
game could no longer alter them, a bite from a vampire (if such things did indeed exist) <br />
could not make them living dead (though having all the blood drained from them would <br />
still result in a corpse), a swarm of nano-machines from the technological singularity <br />
couldn't make them into collective intelligence robot zombies: reality now recognized <br />
their current forms as their true forms, and their wolfhood was now impossible to be <br />
stolen from them now, nothing could steal the pack members from each other now. They <br />
were Big Bad Wolves, period, now and forever from this point onward. <br />
<br />
As the pack tore into dinner Kaylee was however worried about Master, 'A good and <br />
happy family? We're a Big and Bad Pack of Wolves!  I can't wait to give birth to Master's <br />
children and raise them, but ... ' &quot;Master has anyone used  a Dare on you? Are you feeling <br />
okay Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Kaylee no one has, and yes I'm feeling fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am worried Master. That you are not acting like yourself.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen look at Kaylee and cupped a breast with one paw, stroking it with his thumb, <br />
&quot;What is self Kaylee? You know you're not Kyle. To say I am still Jennifer feels rather <br />
absurd now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee didn't answer right away as she felt her mate's stroking, &quot;M-Master, I'm just <br />
worried you might be going a little, soft.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, I plan to show you and the triplets just how hard I am still tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master I mean, ... can you... really.... ... &quot; Kaylee fell silent for a bit as Jensen began <br />
stroking her other breast. &quot;We are Big and Bad Wolves, we are the embodiment of <br />
everything humans found fearful about wolves. We are the parable of the children's <br />
lesson 'Don't Talk to Strangers.' Should be really be turning this... benign...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen laughed, &quot;Don't worry dear, I'm still Big, and I'm still Bad, I'm simply thinking about <br />
our pups and our pack. We'd be nothing without them dear. We -need- them. And...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are a pack after all... it's our responsibility to look out for one another.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee stared alarmed, Jensen, who as Jennifer in Kyle's opinion loathed that one r-word <br />
more than anything? They were top of the world inside the estate! They could do anything <br />
they wanted! Why should they be tied down by -anything?- <br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy look at me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee turned to see... Marcy... doing a hand stand on Mr P. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marcy!! Be careful!&quot; Kaylee said Jensen's gentle touch and everything she had just been <br />
thinking completely forgotten. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay mother.&quot; Said Jenny to the side of the beast, the only one of her pups to bare <br />
her mate's fur color, &quot;I showed her the proper way to do a head stand.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee came right to Marcy and the cub still upside down Kaylee took the girl and held <br />
her closer, &quot;Don't you do that unless you've got something soft to hand on.&quot;<br />
<br />
The upside down Marcy said, &quot;Momma, it's okay, I'm not fragile like humans are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee ignored Marcy and looked at, &quot;Martha! Bad Omega! How could you let her do that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha's two heads bowed, &quot;I am sorry Mistress Alpha Female, she was in no immediate <br />
danger, and she was having fun, so I thought-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't tell me you thought when you obviously weren't! Bad Omega!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mistress Alpha Female.&quot; The heads somehow bowed lower. <br />
<br />
&quot;I trust you, you were made into part of the pack to look after our cubs! You can easily be <br />
replaced never forget that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mistress Alpha Female.&quot; Martha said now her legs bent as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;No mommy!&quot; Marcy protested, &quot;I'm fine really I am! Don't be mad at Martha!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you young lady,&quot; Kaylee glared at Jenny, &quot;You should know better! Letting your little <br />
sister do something like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry mother, we can jump off a two story building and not be hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not contradict your mother Jen'!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mother.&quot; Jenny bowed her head at her mother. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I doubt you walk of roof tops and land on your heads! And Mr. P!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I apologize... if I had known it would have upset you I wouldn't have allowed-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weather I'm upset or not is NOT the point! The point is letting Marcy play a game that <br />
you haven't taken precautions for!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I apologize Alpha Female.&quot; Mr. P bowed, &quot;I'd never ever put any of the pups in the <br />
least amount of danger, ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah he took care of that witch's cat too!&quot; Marcy inject looking 'up' to see the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;... Until you go to bed dear you're staying with mommy...&quot; Kaylee said going back to <br />
Jensen still holding Marcy relieved that no damage had been done. <br />
<br />
Pearl was also relieved, her secret was now safe for now and forever unless Beatrice <br />
squealed on her. Pearl had not been the one call used her turn to start the cycle to make <br />
their wolfhood last a lifetime.  The strange thing was, Pearl didn't -feel- like Beatrice <br />
would report her. Or Beatrice would have done so by now. Pearl wasn't sure she <br />
understood why Beatrice hadn't reported her yet, but Pearl was grateful all the same. <br />
<br />
the use of the game had of course require them to completely restructure who had a turn <br />
and who did not. And then recycling back to those who had not taking part of the first <br />
round. <br />
<br />
They had started with Zackery giving  Alice's precise 'Transform or Dare.'  They had used <br />
the males as place holders for each group, (one male and four females). Including The <br />
Master and Master Bart and Master Kevin.  This lasted until all that was left was Master <br />
Abbey and Master Samantha and Zackery where it began and then their destinies were <br />
sealed forever with the pack's. <br />
<br />
The end result was the ones without turns were Roger, Lawrence, Ulysses, the Master, <br />
Nick, Bart, and Kevin.  <br />
<br />
Zack had been selected to begin to the cycle so it would come back to him so he might <br />
be the one to transform his parents.  And of course make way for his entire family legal <br />
oblivion to slip into never to be seen again. Zack already had a perfect idea on what to <br />
make them. <br />
<br />
Though of course there remained the loop hope of them purposely contacting any of their <br />
friends or relatives who'd instantly remember them in that case as it had been with all the <br />
other she-wolves and males. <br />
<br />
Chester felt his fur stand on end as he watched all of this from the corner. The sheer <br />
power flowing through these blessed by Fenrir was fantastic. While the Alpha Male had <br />
turned down the idea of changing the world... Chester honestly wondered if they <br />
underestimated it... <br />
<br />
And Alice's choice of wording had been perfect, because the curse was silently swearing <br />
oaths at the part of itself that had let this glass wolf child be born who could use <br />
language with more precision than samurai could swing their sword. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alice.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Father?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're going to sit in now on all the meetings between myself, your mother and her <br />
sisters, your step mother, and your eldest siblings... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish of me father, but why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to ask Alice? You know language better than any of us, you'll be our advisor to <br />
every action we take regarding the game.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Father.&quot; Alice curtsied. <br />
<br />
Jensen was already thinking Caroline's proposal for a second guard on their retreat island <br />
was a practical one, but he'd save his decision in the morning, it would at least get their <br />
numbers up to enough for short term survival. The much larger number needed for long <br />
term survival as Mr. P had put it, could come -after- Serenity was dealt with. <br />
<br />
As soon as the rounds were done he had Julie give Sandi and Terri Serenity's precise <br />
home address. With orders to bring the old woman and anyone with her back, in pieces of <br />
need be, no one could endanger the future of the pack, no one.  <br />
<br />
This was why the pups shed no tears over the death of the familiar of the witch who had <br />
tried to keep their family from becoming whole. <br />
<br />
The two super human she wolves stopped at the edge of the gate, or rather, on the walls, <br />
in the dead of the night, their night visions taking care of things, making the world seem <br />
nearly black and white. Anyone who saw them barely thinking 'rich people are weird' <br />
before shrugging it off. <br />
<br />
&quot;This.... this is our first time outside the estate since becoming part of the pack...&quot; The <br />
teal Sandi commented. <br />
<br />
&quot;Know what you mean.&quot; The blue green Terri responded. While she felt some of the <br />
masters reason for turning down Lawrence's idea were rather odd, she wasn't about to <br />
complain about them being shot down, or at least the one about them being given super <br />
natural power they'd have no real world experience using...   <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, we better get this over with.&quot; Sandi said. <br />
<br />
&quot;At least we know she isn't a witch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless that's what she wanted Julie to think.&quot; It didn't feel odd in the least speaking in <br />
such a personal tone of someone they just met that evening, they were all part of the <br />
pack after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let's not get into contrived plot territory: next you'll be saying the game contains the <br />
awareness of the original witches and is waiting for enough turns to be used to resurrent <br />
them to destroy Glendale...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;.... please don't joke like that...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Terri apologized to the she wolf who had started out as his girlfriend when she <br />
had been Terry but now felt like a sister instead. &quot;Let's go!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two Big Bad Wolves moved like lightning. <br />
<br />
Back inside the triplets said, &quot;You should have sent us.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We were the more logical choice Master.&quot; Fran said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I could have tried to reason with her.&quot; Julie explained. <br />
<br />
&quot;And we would have been better at leaving no trace.&quot; Darla added.<br />
<br />
Jensen replied, &quot;This is your first night fully reunited as a family... enjoy it, let me worried <br />
about the old woman tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; The triplet answered and scattered to their daughters, the only time they <br />
didn't feel uncomfortable apart. <br />
<br />
Sandi and Terri came to a locked house that they broke into easily enough. They had <br />
found an empty house and store front with several things clearly quickly packed. &quot;We <br />
missed her.&quot; Commented Terri. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks that way.&quot; Sandi replied. <br />
<br />
Searching for anything of value or use and finding nothing, the she wolves retreated back <br />
to the estate, closing the door behind them, it wasn't like their paws could be used for <br />
finger prints now anyway...  Jensen was disappointed when the two gave their report it <br />
looked like Serenity was going to be a problem that wasn't about to vanish. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
Nearly overwhelm, the tired old woman shook at the exactly same time the turns were <br />
being done cascade style. <br />
<br />
Paul put a comforting gentle black hand on Serenity's shoulders, the old woman shook <br />
with a look of shock on her face, <br />
<br />
&quot;Euuu oh-kei?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So... so so many... it was like a shock wave... or maybe a backwash... something about it <br />
felt familiar... I was sure I felt Julie, Abbey and Samantha being effected by the game <br />
again but... so many...even larger than that shock wave from before... it felt like almost <br />
everyone the game's changed in the last week was touched by the game's power again... &quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Some things never change,&quot; Trevor muttered to himself alone, &quot;Cable television and <br />
nothing on.&quot; <br />
<br />
It was harder to change channel on his own using the pencil to poke at the buttons, but it <br />
was possible. He changed the channel and saw a football game, that made him feel sick <br />
inside and he changed the channel again, now it was the title for some horror show, <br />
Trevor tried to change the channel again but the batteries chose then to die out. <br />
&quot;Knowing my luck it'll be a werewolf movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor.&quot; <br />
<br />
The tabby started, the voice had come from the TV. He saw the title image, a black <br />
hooded skeleton turn it's head towards him, the two points of light within it's skull <br />
looking right at him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha?&quot; Trevor tilted his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's time Trevor.&quot; The hooded skull came out of the television scream, skeletal hands, a <br />
black robe and scythe all following behind. It rose before him, staring down at him. <br />
Trevor couldn't move. <br />
<br />
&quot;No... no you can't be... it's can be...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Time's up Trevor ... it's time...&quot; Death said, for that was what this was. The thing in it's <br />
other bony claw revealed a chained silver pocket watch, open, before Trevor's eyes the <br />
hands stopped moving. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please... no this isn't right! It's just the game! I'm not supposed to die now! PLEASE!&quot; <br />
<br />
Trevor felt his chest tighten. <br />
<br />
&quot;When is anyone 'supposed' to die?&quot; Death grinned at him and reached for him. <br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Trevor screamed and nearly falling off the couch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Special clearance sale extended!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor looked at the TV... it was just a commercial. Trevor looked around... no grim <br />
reaper... no stopped life clock... <br />
<br />
&quot;... just a nightmare... just a nightmare...&quot; Trevor breathed to himself, &quot;Just a nightmare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor! Are you okay?!&quot; Serenity came into the room with Paul close behind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? No. Yes. ... It was just a nightmare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Want to talk about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No....It's not like we're friends.&quot;  'If we were all you'd hear or read were 'meows.' Just like <br />
my family.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave me alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity and Paul left the room. <br />
<br />
As soon as they were gone Trevor felt the tears in his eyes, old inner demons rising their <br />
heads. Trevor curled up as best he could with his bandaged body and cried in whispers, &quot;I <br />
don't wanna die... I don't wanna die... I wanna go home, I wanna hear dad's lectures, I <br />
wanna drive grandma to her doctor's appointment, I wanna play football, I wanna go <br />
home, I don't wanna die... I don't wanna die...&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Paul led Serenity back into the study/bedroom with the computer and helped back into <br />
the chair, he didn't need to, but he wanted to be a gentleman. <br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor... that boy's going to die on the inside long before his death sentence kicks in, I <br />
was hoping that if he mated with Queen he'd find something be happy and proud of <br />
again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul wrote frantic on the printer paper, &quot;U HAD HIM HAVE SEX WITH A ANIMAL?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I only suggested he stop trying to resist when Queen wouldn't stop pursuing him. <br />
It's not bestiality when you're the same species... &quot;<br />
<br />
Paul wrote nearly breaking the pen he was using in two. &quot;AND IT NOT LOVE IF DONE BY <br />
INSTINCT AND NOT CHOICE!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know... &quot; Serenity sighed, &quot;Trevor's situation is horrid, but he seems to almost <br />
subconsciously try to make himself worse. ... When I finally forged some relationship back <br />
in the day at last after my change, I finally started DOING something with myself rather <br />
than just sitting around feeling sorry for myself. Due to his curse, Trevor's options are <br />
limited.  Maybe he would have even been able to turn Queen around and cram into her <br />
peach size brain what 'love' is. Not that it matters anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul was 'silent' and wrote down some more, &quot;Speaking of cats, the idea from before. I <br />
was thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Paul if we start building a lion person army we'd be as much monsters as the wolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul responded in his writing and wrote for a bite before handed it to Serenity. <br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt any of the people who are now part of the wolf harem were actually given a <br />
choice over weather the play the game or not or really given a realistic chance to say no <br />
or not.  As long as hold onto a turn of the game before destroying it we can use another <br />
Transform or Dare to revert them. And it's really a matter of free will. If they willing want <br />
to help save dozens of innocent people, and know precisely what he the 'transform' will <br />
be before hand, then it's not the same as the wolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity rubbed her eyebrows, &quot;We'd still need a turn of the game anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul wrote down, &quot;We'll need one to restore the wolves' victims anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AND... there's still the matter of a bloody brawl between wolves and lions -who have the <br />
social brain structure to work together-, that could cost lives, which would defeat the <br />
purpose, and bring more innocent people into the mix if the wolves decide to raise an <br />
army in self defense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul was obvious shot down by this glaring flaw in the idea, &quot;Not if.&quot; Paul stopped writing <br />
and started again, &quot;they are people before hand, or are given skills by the game, to,&quot; Paul <br />
grunted at the term, &quot;use guerilla warfare or the delicate tactics needs for facing a cult.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity pinched her nose, &quot;And where precisely could we find people like that and <br />
volunteers anyway?  'Hello, I'd like to temporally mutate you into a humanoid lion, with <br />
the majority of you becoming lionesses', to engage in a conflict with a large pack of <br />
humanoid wolves who are nearly all brainwashed and thus innocent people, who will fight <br />
to the death, who you are expected to subdue for the sake of them being de-mutate and <br />
de-brainwash, yes you will be risking your life for complete strangers who will be trying <br />
to kill you in the mean time... '&quot;<br />
<br />
The orangoutang sat down on the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm very sorry Paul, but it's just not doable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrote down again for a bit before handing it off. She read it and looked at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;No Paul, we both know the police are worthless and the national guard would never <br />
listen to us. They'd think I was a stage magician no matter what you or Trevor did.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Paul wrote down again. <br />
<br />
'What happens if part of the game escapes, or it able to manifest in someone new all on <br />
it's own? And when.... and when we're gone?  The police can't keep cowering before the <br />
game forever... and ignorance have proven no solution for it either.'  <br />
<br />
&quot;Paul, you know that, I know that, Trevor knows that I'm sure, but the police just want to <br />
pretend that as long as they stay away from the game it'll go away on it's own. They lost <br />
two of their own. And they directed Julie towards me. They know the game exists, but <br />
they don't want to know it exists.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul looking very sunk like his idea and the orange naked ape wrote down meekly, <br />
&quot;Couldn't hurt to ask. Maybe they still had friends who want to help save them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Frank had his family, and look what happened to them... this 'pack' just thinks so <br />
different from the other harems I've taken apart...  and this is all meaningless unless we <br />
could find another person with a turn... Which we WILL need to save anyone anyway...&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul wrote down solemnly, &quot;I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
A grandfather clock rung. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's so late.... see you in the morning Paul.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Guuuuuud-kni-et.&quot;  the orangoutang replied verbally. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Jensen stood in the Master bedroom. In front of him stood Kaylee. &quot;To The sun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Behind him was Julie. &quot;To The sky.&quot;<br />
<br />
To his right Fran, &quot;To The heavens.&quot;<br />
<br />
And his left Darla, &quot;To And the earth.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Zackery held both Pearl and June in his arms. <br />
<br />
The vast majority of she wolves having form a effect bright colors shell over Lawrence and <br />
Roger in the female's den.  <br />
<br />
Nicole in the co-ed den fell asleep with Nick still in her, the red ribbon remaining on her <br />
ear in spite of everything. <br />
<br />
Megan, Sarah, and Ulysses giving them plenty of good distance playing a board game <br />
which Terri and Sandi ended up joining. <br />
<br />
The shadows undressed and slept  in perfect orderly fashion having no dreams in their <br />
sleep other than what Bart and Jenny had. <br />
<br />
The stone gargoyles held their pose and stood guard as they would for a thousand years <br />
if need be to protect the pack from all that would harm it. <br />
<br />
Jack and Marcine's deer herd continued to grow as their scent continued to attract new <br />
deer, each new doe implanted with Jack's superior seed with all the emotional <br />
endearment of a gardener planting a seed in soil. And each one, given a name. <br />
<br />
Martha tucked in the pubs, including the glass wolves being let in and out with their help. <br />
The mirror girls' clothes this time being night gowns. Martha, while not blood related to <br />
Alice, did end up in a modified french maid outfit similar to the one she had worn when <br />
still human but with accommodations for her extra arms, tails, breasts and head and <br />
looking to be in a more classical almost 'once upon a time' style. Abbey figured this was <br />
because she was their nanny. <br />
<br />
Mr. P slept in the room with them. <br />
<br />
Abbey asked in the reflection of the bed, &quot;Do you think we can go to Narnia?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Abbey,&quot; Alice said, &quot;Narnia is fiction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So is the Big Bad Wolf, but he's our papa.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice had to concede on that one, &quot;And I haven't used the three steps to try and cross -<br />
realities- yet and I'd rather not try to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides.&quot; Samantha reminded her once sister, now half-sister/cousin, &quot;Narnia got frozen <br />
over at the end remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn't that the first book?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happened at the end of the last one too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;</p>
