<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning’s local newscast prominently featured the car explosion and death of the Officer Adams and his partner. <br />
<br />
“And now for our top story this morning” Brian, the daytime news anchor read from the teleprompter. “Two area police officers were killed after a bomb was thrown into their police vehicle. For more on this developing story, we turn now to Julia Chango with the latest developments.”<br />
<br />
Julia Chango looked solemnly into the camera, as she stood outside of the police precinct. <br />
<br />
“Yes Brian” she said to the camera “I’m standing outside the police precinct where just a few minutes ago, Commander Mann spoke to reporters about the confirmed murders of two area police officers, Officers William Adams and Daniel Lambert. No suspects have been identified at this time, but their deaths have already provoked sadness and anger throughout the entire law enforcement community.”<br />
<br />
A video clip of the Commander Mann speaking was played over Julia’s voiceover. <br />
<br />
“Commander Mann made an announcement that no police official ever wants to make” she said. <br />
<br />
“Two of our finest officers” Commander Mann read from a prepared statement, faking somberness in his voice “William Adams and Daniel Lambert were murdered in the line of duty last night.”<br />
<br />
A photo was shown of the burnt police car, damaged with broken windows and charred upholstery. <br />
<br />
“It happened just after midnight this morning” Julia continued in a voiceover. “Just three blocks away from the precinct, an explosion was heard.”<br />
<br />
“I got up from my bed” a neighbor said on camera “and ran down there as fast as I could.”<br />
<br />
“When the woman got to the scene of the explosion, she found the police car engulfed in flames.”<br />
<br />
“I was like oh my god! I have to dial the EMT.”<br />
<br />
“When firefighters and paramedics arrived at the scene a short time later, they discovered two bodies in the car. When taken in for forensic analysis, they were identified as the two area police officers.”<br />
<br />
“It is a tragedy to lose any of our finest men in the line of duty” Commander Mann said, faking crocodile tears as he did so. “It’s worse to see our officers targeted by those who hate law enforcement and those that sacrifice their lives to protect our rights and keep us safe.”<br />
<br />
“The mayor, a long time critic of the department, was equally mournful.”<br />
<br />
Faking crocodiles tears as well, the mayor read from a prepared statement in the clip.<br />
<br />
“I mourn the deaths of any of our fine police officers” he said, showing little eye contact to the assembled reporters. “I’m especially troubled by those out there who would incite the kind of rhetoric that led these two men to lose their lives performing their duties this morning.”<br />
<br />
“The mayor was, of course, referring to his political rival, Freddy Benson, the public defender whose quixotic campaign is now within the margin of error of an upset victory next month. When asked for comment on this morning murders, Freddy Benson made a statement via a remote conference call.&quot;<br />
<br />
“I condemn any act of violence towards the police department” Freddy’s voice could be heard saying in the clip. “Having said that, we do not yet know who is responsible for this, nor does it any way, shape or form take away or detract from the criticisms I have made throughout this campaign.”<br />
<br />
“Though the mayor sought to shift the blame to Benson, without naming names, the police union leader, Peter McDonough, says both candidates are to blame. He is even suggesting that the mayor and Benson both be removed from the ballot.”<br />
<br />
Peter McDonough’s smarmy, baboon like face made an appearance on camera. He yelled and ranted in a wide jaw fashion, inciting the crowd in a fascist fervor.<br />
<br />
“The mayor may think that Freddy Benson is the only problem in our town!” he yelled, to a gathered assembly of police officers. “But he is not the only menace to our community! The mayor is as equally responsible for rolling over to communists and social rabble rousers who want to undermine our police department and give criminals the upper hand in society!”<br />
<br />
A video clip of Evan’s brutal arrest appeared in the news report.<br />
<br />
“McDonough&quot; Jessica continued in a voiceover &quot;the powerful union leader, may have been referring to the anger around the arrest of candidate Benson’s son, Evan, for the supposed ‘crime’ of jaywalking. Police officials had stressed that the minor had been resisting arrest, but eye witnesses at the time disputed this account. The mayor of the town gave his own criticisms in an interview with Channel 8 news.”<br />
<br />
“I am troubled and concerned by the developments in which my opponent’s son was taken into police custody” the mayor said in an interview that took place in his office. “However, as I have to stress time and time again, citizens of this town do not have the right to resist an arrest under any circumstances, period.”<br />
<br />
“Those words enflamed the police union leader and led to his call for political leaders to remove the mayor from next month’s ballot.”<br />
<br />
“He has lost his mind!” Peter said to his assembled group of officers. “If we are to defeat the communist on the ballot next month, then we need a candidate that will represent law enforcement and the law abiding citizens of this community!”<br />
<br />
“The chances of the mayor dropping out before the deadline to replace him on next month’s ballot are slim” Julia continued speaking on camera. “Police union leaders previous attempts to remove Freddy Benson earlier in the campaign season were also unsuccessful. Still, the anger from police officers for both candidates is going to make this race an interesting one to watch from here on out. For Channel 8 news, I’m Julia Chango. Back to you in the studio, Brian.”<br />
<br />
In the mayor’s office, the clip was turned off, as the mayor engaged in a not stop barrage of swearing and yelling. After a certain point, an advisor spoke up.<br />
<br />
“You may be one of the luckiest men in the world” he said. “The fact that none of the news channels brought up Freddy’s accusations about the assassin and the police taking him into custody is a sheer stroke of luck.”<br />
<br />
“I’m ruined!!!!!” the mayor yelled, ignoring his advisor’s comment. <br />
<br />
“Not necessarily” another advisor spoke up. “So far, the pictures that Freddy’s campaign posted online have not gone viral.”<br />
<br />
“Yet!!!!!! It’s only a matter of time before it does!!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
“Doug is doing the best he can to repress the photos from appearing in his news sites and web casts. It’s harder to try to tamp down on it spreading on iThink, especially with Diya still at the helm.”<br />
<br />
“Argh!!!!!!! How she is still on the board?!?!?!?!”<br />
<br />
“I couldn’t even begin to tell you, sir, but in the future, please don’t order any more assassination attempts. You&#39;ve gotten yourself out of being blamed for two of them now. You may not be so lucky the next time. Just trust our judgement and let this race play out to the end.”<br />
<br />
“How?!?!?!?! Everyone is going to turn on me now!!!!!!! You heard what Peter said!!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
“Not necessarily” a different advisor spoke up.<br />
<br />
Despite the efforts of the press to suppress the story, Freddy’s campaign had managed to circulate the pictures Michael took online that morning. While most of the photos proved nothing, the mysterious photo, described as the last one taken of Officers Adams and Lambert while they were alive, showed them dragging the unknown man down the stairs of Freddy and Michael’s home. It raised alarm bells and led to uncomfortable questions.<br />
<br />
By the end of the day, the press was forced to report on the development. Though the language was drenched in terms like ‘conspiracy’ or ‘speculative,” many in the news media had to admit that the photos raised important questions. It drove up conspiracy talk online and had many pointing the finger of blame at the mayor or even the Illuminati. Still, when the news cycle was over, the dueling narratives ended up leading to a tie for Freddy and the mayor in the court of public opinion. Instant polling by days end showed that there was no movement one way or the other in the race. Residents were locked in their respective corners. The deaths of Officers Adams and Lambert did not move the needle. <br />
<br />
At Freddy and Michael’s home that evening, Michael began making dinner in the kitchen. Evan sat on the couch in the living room, playing a video game. A short time later, Freddy and Chris made their way into the house. Freddy looked exhausted and had a hard time moving.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God” Freddy said, as he hung up his things. “This day has been so exhausting. Countless interviews, tons of meetings and a police visit to the campaign headquarters. Unbelievable.”<br />
<br />
“Hi papa” Evan said, as he got up to give Freddy a hug.<br />
<br />
Freddy reluctantly pat him on the head and motioned him back to the couch.<br />
<br />
“Papa is really tired right now, Evan” Freddy responded. “I need to go lie down to recuperate.”<br />
<br />
“Ok papa.”<br />
<br />
“Chris?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Freddy?” he answered. <br />
<br />
“Mind sitting with Evan for a while? I need some alone time to recharge.”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing, boss.”<br />
<br />
Freddy let out a weak smile, as he made his way up to his bedroom. Motioning Evan to the couch, Chris sat down and pulled up something on his communication device. <br />
<br />
“So” Chris said “remember that history stuff you were struggling with yesterday?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah…” Evan replied inquisitively. <br />
<br />
“Well, while your papa was busy working at the office today, I did some research on your course material. I found this great documentary on the subject that you’ll really like.”<br />
<br />
“Is it going to be approved by the school district, though?&quot; Michael asked from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“I did some research on that and I believe that it will be. Do you want to watch it after dinner?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll take a look at it. If it’s approved by the district, then Evan will get to watch it. Speaking of which.”<br />
<br />
Michael made his way from the kitchen and looked at Evan sitting on the couch.<br />
<br />
“Evan” he said.<br />
<br />
Evan looked up at his dad and nodded. <br />
<br />
“I know you’re going to hate me for doing this, but I asked your grandma to watch you at her place for a while.”<br />
<br />
“What?!” Evan shrieked. “No! You can’t do that! What about—“<br />
<br />
“Shh!” Chris hushed, as he pat Evan on the knee. “You’ll wake up your papa.”<br />
<br />
“But dad” Evan said, ignoring Chris. “I don’t want to have to live with grandma. I want to stay at home with you and papa and Chris.”<br />
<br />
“It’s too dangerous now” Michael replied. “After last night, I can’t allow you to be put in such a dangerous situation like that again. What if the guy had killed us? He could have gone for you next.”<br />
<br />
“But Chris is here to protect us.”<br />
<br />
Chris blushed, as he felt embarrassed in that moment.<br />
<br />
“Barely” Michael replied with a scornful tone. “Only in the nick of time did he save us.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah” Chris replied nervously “speaking of which, when Freddy’s done resting, you and your husband have to have a chat.”<br />
<br />
“What for?”<br />
<br />
Michael stared at Chris silently, before what he was suggesting became clear. <br />
<br />
“No…” Michael let out in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“Mr. Scavolini” Chris replied calmly. “You know we have no other choice now. I have to.”<br />
<br />
Michael groaned loudly, as he made his way back to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“What do you have to do now?” Evan asked.<br />
<br />
“Not for you to worry about” Chris replied, as he ruffled Evan’s hair.<br />
<br />
“Chris, if dad sends me to be with grandma, then I’m never going to see you again.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not necessarily true, kid. If your papa wins the race for mayor, then I’m sure he’s going to hire me to be his full time body guard. That way, I’ll be around a lot.”<br />
<br />
“But you’ll probably move back to your place after the race is over.”<br />
<br />
“So? I’ll still come over and hang out with you guys when I can. And maybe, if your papa allows it, I can host you for a sleep over at my place.”<br />
<br />
“Really? You mean it?”<br />
<br />
“Yup. I promise.”<br />
<br />
“But what about is papa loses. He’s not leading in the polls now, so the odds are that he’s not going to win on election day. What if, after all this effort, he ends up falling short in the end?”<br />
<br />
Chris paused for a moment, as Evan stared at him nervously. Putting on a confident face, he let out a little chuckle.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about now. Let’s focus on helping your papa win next month. And besides….”<br />
<br />
Chris paused again, before he continued. <br />
<br />
“In the chance that he loses, I’m going to be out of a job and you’re all going to have to move out of this town. Maybe we can find some way to work things out and stay together.”<br />
<br />
“You mean that?” Evan asked. <br />
<br />
“I do.”<br />
<br />
Chris ruffled Evan’s hair, which Michael noticed from the kitchen. He was going to say something in that moment, but decided against it. He knew this might be the last time Evan would hang out with Chris for a while, possibly forever. He didn’t want to ruin the moment between them. Sighing, Michael continued cooking, as Chris did his best to put Evan at ease. <br />
<br />
“You’re a good kid, Evan” he said. “No matter what happens next, I want you to know that I believe in you. You’re going to get through this ok. I promise.”<br />
<br />
Evan nodded, as Chris tickled him. Evan laughed loudly, as Chris moved his fingers all over the boy’s body. After a while, Michael called them in for dinner. <br />
<br />
“Can you let Freddy know dinner is ready?” Michael asked Chris.<br />
<br />
“Sure, Mr. Scavolini” Chris replied, as he ran up to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
When he was outside the door, Chris knocked a few times. <br />
<br />
“Boss” he said. “Michael sent me up to tell you that dinner is ready.”<br />
<br />
A short moment passed, before the bedroom door opened. <br />
<br />
“I’m not that hungry tonight, Chris” Freddy replied. <br />
<br />
“Just come down anyway. You shouldn’t go without eating.”<br />
<br />
Freddy moaned, as Chris gently grabbed his hand and walked him down the stairs. When they were in the kitchen, Michael was serving the meal in bowls, with Evan eagerly awaiting his dinner. <br />
<br />
“What’s for dinner, tonight?” Freddy asked, as he sat down at the table. <br />
<br />
“Stew” Michael replied, as he finished serving it out. <br />
<br />
Not waiting for Chris to sit down, Evan dug in and finished his stew quickly. Letting out a happy sigh, Evan sat back in his chair. <br />
<br />
“You must have been pretty hungry, kid” Chris chuckled, as he sat down at the table. <br />
<br />
“It’s one of the best things dad makes” Evan replied. “You’re really going to like it, Chris.”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad to hear that” Michael said, as he brought over the pot to the table. “Want some more?”<br />
<br />
Evan nodded, as Michael poured him more stew into his bowl. After he had put it away, he joined the boys in his life at the table. The four of them dug into the meal, with Evan eating slower than he did with his first serving.<br />
<br />
“This is really good stew, Mr. Scavolini” Chris said. <br />
<br />
“Thanks Chris” Michael replied happily. “I’m glad you appreciate it. It means a lot coming from you.”<br />
<br />
“This really hit the spot” Freddy said, as he ate up from his bowl. “Thank you Michael for making it and thank you Chris for insisting I come down to eat it.”<br />
<br />
Michael and Chris blushed at Freddy’s compliments. <br />
<br />
“So I was thinking” Chris spoke up soon after. “Since this might be the last time I see Evan for a while, I was thinking you two should go up to your bedroom and have a little chat about what the game plan is for this evening. Mr. Scavolini, you and your husband should talk things over and come to a mutual agreement. While you do that, I’ll spend some time with Evan and keep him out of your hair.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds great” Evan replied, as he finished his stew. <br />
<br />
Evan got up and put his bowl in the sink.<br />
<br />
“Come on, Chris” he said, as he left the kitchen. “Let’s hang out in the living room.”<br />
<br />
“In a second” Chris called back, before turning to look at Freddy and Michael. “If your son asks about what might happen tonight, how should I go about addressing it with him?”<br />
<br />
“That’s presuming ‘what might happen tonight’ actually ends up happening” Michael responded with a snark in his tone. “I still haven’t actually agreed to it yet.”<br />
<br />
“Well, Mr. Scavolini, that’s what you and Freddy have to talk about while you’re up there. Talk it over as a couple, work out any issues and then let me know about a decision when you’re done. I know what I would do in your shoes, but you have to feel comfortable with whatever you decide. Still, if you let out your feelings about this, I’m sure you’ll come to the right decision.”<br />
<br />
Michael nodded, as Chris slurped down the rest of his stew and got up to place it into the sink.<br />
<br />
“I’m coming, Evan!” Chris yelled out to him. “Ready or not, here I come.”<br />
<br />
Chris ran to playfully grab Evan and lift him up into the air. Freddy and Michael sat in silence, as they finished eating their stew. When they were done, they made their way upstairs, passing by Evan having fun with Chris in the living room as they did so. When they settled into bed, Freddy spoke up.<br />
<br />
“So” he began “I guess we need to talk.”<br />
<br />
Michael sighed, before he responded. <br />
<br />
“I mean, we do, but I’m so torn about this.”<br />
<br />
“Well, let’s talk it out as a couple. Let’s start with the obvious. The idea of another man sleeping in our bed.”<br />
<br />
“That’s something I am having a hard time working through. I know the logical reasons why Chris has to be in the bed with us. We can’t really fit another bed in here and it’s not appropriate to expect he’s going to sleep on the floor or on an air mattress. He needs to be able to get to you if someone comes after us again. He just barely subdued the would be assassin last night. I don’t want him to miss you by a split second and lose my husband forever.”<br />
<br />
Michael began to tear up, as Freddy comforted him with a hug.<br />
<br />
“But on the other hand” he continued “I’m worried about what’s going to happen with Chris in the bed with us.”<br />
<br />
“Michael” Freddy said, trying to be reassuring “I promise you that nothing is going to happen between us if he sleeps in our bed. I will keep my hands to myself…or, actually, on you only. He’ll sleep on one side of the bed and we’ll sleep on the other. We have enough room for the three of us so we’re not on top of each other.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not a matter of space, Freddy. It’s a matter of the fact that you are clearly turned on by Chris and I don’t want you getting handsy with him while I’m asleep. Presuming he doesn’t smack you if you try something, or just up and quit on us, I couldn’t deal with you cheating on me with the man who is supposed to protect you. Protect us.”<br />
<br />
“Michael, look at me.”<br />
<br />
Freddy put his hands on Michael’s face and directed it so he could make eye contact. <br />
<br />
“I swear on my life that I will—“<br />
<br />
“Don’t swear on your life” Michael replied angrily.<br />
<br />
“Ok, I swear on this house that I won’t do anything inappropriate with Chris that could jeopardize our marriage in any way.”<br />
<br />
“How can I trust you to do that?”<br />
<br />
“You have my word, Michael.”<br />
<br />
“You’ve done it before, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
“That was a long time ago and your father initiated it.”<br />
<br />
“He most certainly did not.”<br />
<br />
“He did too. He invited us into his bed and what happened that day happened.”<br />
<br />
“It was a mistake for us to have ever done that with him.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t see it that way.”<br />
<br />
“Of course you don’t, because he wasn’t your father and you were thinking with your dick and not your head.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t remember it being so bad, Michael.”<br />
<br />
“I have a different recollection about that, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
In the year 2020….</p>
