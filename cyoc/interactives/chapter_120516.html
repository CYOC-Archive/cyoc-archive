<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{OKAY FOLKS. Seems like Franknfurter69 and I posted at about the same time, so the correct reading order for the recent episodes are: &quot;<i>Lance</i>ing a Boil&quot;, &quot;Meanwhile...&quot;, &quot;As the Knights Begin To Settle Down For The Evening&quot;, and &quot;Manhunt&quot;. Sorry for the confusion everybody.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve already contacted your parents on the matter and they understand. So, under the circumstances, I&#39;m sure you two have no problems staying here tonight,&quot; said Benton Knight, concluding the briefing in his daughter&#39;s bedroom.<br />
Despite being in his own fursona, when he first entered the room, Benton was surprised to find his daughter Frieda, along with her romantic partners Eric Anderson and Spencer Lawson, all in their human forms and fully dressed finishing up their respective homework assignments from the first day of the new school year.<br />
At first, Spencer and Eric were worried not only about their families, but the town as well when Benton told them that the notorious mobster Fredrick Parker had been shot in an assassination attempt and Moon Lake was now in an even higher state of alert status as the Sheriff&#39;s department and the FBI started searching for the attempted murderer who had successfully killed a deputy while trying to kill Parker.*<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find something to... occupy ourselves before bedtime once our homework is done dad,&quot; began Frieda, while giving her lovers a sly smile, &quot;but what are we going to do for fresh clothing? I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve got something that will probably fit Spencer, but Eric?&quot;<br />
&quot;Good point,&quot; agreed Benton. &quot;Come with me Eric and we&#39;ll go check out my closet,&quot; he offered.<br />
As Benton Knight turned to leave, Eric blew his girlfriends a quick kiss behind the furry back of Frieda&#39;s father before following him.<br />
<br />
As the girls were alone, Spencer smiled as Frieda moved in for a quick kiss.<br />
&quot;I know you don&#39;t have any problems spending the night here,&quot; began Frieda, while playfully pressing herself against the other girl, &quot;but you do have your were birth control pills with you, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; said Spencer, breaking away from her co-lover long enough to move over to her backpack and show Frieda the prescription bottle hidden inside. &quot;Don&#39;t leave home without them, especially considering how hot and horny you and Eric are, let alone how you two make me feel so sexy,&quot; said Spencer, while embracing the girl again.<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; said Frieda, before sharing another kiss with Spencer. &quot;We&#39;ll have to at least try to be quiet once the fun starts, but for now, we really should finish our homework,&quot; she added, before reluctantly breaking away to return to her books.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;I appreciate the offer Mister Knight, but don&#39;t you have anything less formal?&quot; asked Eric, while looking over all the suits, pants, and ties hanging neatly in his closet. The youngest member of the Anderson family didn&#39;t think it the least bit odd to discuss human clothing with the tall werepanther before him, especially since that being was also one of his girlfriend&#39;s fathers.<br />
&quot;Hmm...&quot; said Benton, while walking further into the storage area. &quot;This might be up to the task,&quot; he said, coming out with a pair of unworn blue jeans that still had the original tags on them and a souvenir t-shirt from a trip to New York City.<br />
&quot;<i>I took a bite out of the Big Apple</i>,&quot; said Eric, reading the shirt. &quot;Where did you get these?&quot;<br />
&quot;Frieda bought me the shirt when she was 8 during a summer vacation there. The pants were a Christmas gift from Lance a few years ago,&quot; explained Benton, referring to his younger brother.<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Eric, while looking at the tags. Between becoming a were and still a growing boy, he realized, &quot;The pants will fit, but are there any other options on the shirt?&quot; He wasn&#39;t about to mention that Frieda had Eric secretly keep a couple of extra pair of boxer underwear in her room in case of... <i>sexual emergencies</i>, and had no problem wearing the same pair of socks for a second day.<br />
&quot;Let me look,&quot; offered Benton, while walking back into the closet. Then, thinking about it for a moment, he said, &quot;Listen, Eric. About earlier...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
&quot;Our conversation during dinner. I want Frieda to be happy, and I know you and Spencer complete her in a way I and my wife may never fully understand, but when you told me earlier that you wanted to figure out what makes the scent coming from the three of you such a powerful aphrodisiac**...&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe I wasn&#39;t quite clear on that,&quot; realized Eric. &quot;It&#39;s the mystery that gets me. The three of us together, as you saw us when you first entered Frieda&#39;s bedroom, nothing was happening. Any combination of two of us, calm or aroused, whether normal or furry, nothing happens then either. It takes all three of us, aroused and furry, to make whatever happens happen. Why?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; admitted Benton, while still searching his closet for a shirt Eric could wear to school. &quot;But my concern is that while I would like whoever Frieda does eventually settle down with to not only love her, but be able to support her and whatever family they might have as well, I would prefer my daughter not to marry one of the idle rich. I mean, look at me. I may be wealthy, but I keep busy, and not just with business matters nowadays either,&quot; he added proudly.<br />
&quot;I understand. Solving the mystery of our combined scent isn&#39;t the only thing I want to do with my life, it&#39;s just the first thing,&quot; said Eric. &quot;As far back as I can remember, long before my family moved to Moon Lake, I&#39;ve loved science. There are so many things I hope to accomplish in the scientific world, especially now that I have more time to work as a werepanther...&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all well and good, but two things. First, I found out the hard way all work and no play isn&#39;t good, so don&#39;t make the same mistake I made.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; agreed Eric.<br />
&quot;Second, you have to be careful not to reveal your longevity, even if you don&#39;t expose your were-ness. Couple of decades from now, I&#39;m going to have to start pretending to either be my heir or successor if I want to continue running Knight Industries myself. Yet, hiding the existence of weres in plain sight while still being a positive force in the world is something companies like mine and Tachibana&#39;s have gotten quite good at over the years.&quot;<br />
&quot;Something to think about and keep in mind for the future,&quot; agreed Eric, as Benton came back out carrying a paper shopping bag with string handles.<br />
&quot;These shirts belonged to my father, but I&#39;ve never worn any of them. My mother gave them to me when he retired and they left for that private were retirement community in the Tropics. If any of them fit, feel free to keep them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks Mister Knight,&quot; said Eric, while looking inside the bag.<br />
&quot;Benton, remember?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry. It&#39;s just that with your wife around...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. Amanda still prefers things more formal than I do now. Guess I&#39;m lightening up somewhat,&quot; realized Benton, thinking over everything he&#39;s been through.<br />
&quot;Okay. Just one question before I go,&quot; said Eric, while rummaging in the bag.<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
&quot;Who are <i>The Archies?</i>&quot; asked Eric, while pulling out a shirt with an image of the historic bubblegum group on it.***<br />
Benton was about to answer when his cellphone started ringing. Being currently in his werepanther fursona, he just carried it around with him, and the device was sitting on his nightstand at the moment. &quot;Remind me to tell you later. But please make sure everyone finishes their homework before you kids have any... pre-bedtime fun,&quot; he said, while getting his phone.<br />
&quot;Okay Benton. Night,&quot; said Eric with a smile, before leaving the room. Despite the unfortunate circumstances that caused the situation, Eric couldn&#39;t wait to get back to his ladies as he felt his boyhood start to tense within his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Benton Knight here,&quot; he said, answering the phone.<br />
&quot;Mister Knight? Brock Stone, the private detective you contacted this morning,&quot; said the voice on the other end.<br />
&quot;Oh yes. Any results on that assignment I gave you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Plenty. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t deliver the information in person at the moment. It isn&#39;t wise for anyone to be on the streets who doesn&#39;t have to be right now, but I did find out plenty about that teacher, Jeff Wilson, you asked me to look into. Mighty interesting information I dug up.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; said a surprised Benton.<br />
&quot;I can e-mail it to you right now,&quot; offered Stone.<br />
&quot;Just let me get to a computer,&quot; replied Benton, thinking his werepanthress wife Amanda could wait until this was concluded, especially if it meant giving Eric and other students an easier time at school.<br />
