<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lesily looked at the father and wondered what to do with him. With Joshua in a hypnotic state, she had the do something the can change his life. Thinking through, she came up with a really good idea. Looking towards the audience she smiled and said, &quot;As you can see ladies and gentlemen, Daniel is now a full grown man with huge opportunities. But what to do with the father? There has to be some way in changing him right? So I was thinking that now the Daniel is an adult, he needs a woman in his life. I think we can fix that up.&quot;<br />
<br />
She approached Josh and whispered into his ear. &quot;Joshua, can you hear me?&quot; she asked. Josh answered in a sleepless state, &quot;Yes...&quot; She then continued with her show and said, &quot;Good. Now I know that you love your son and take good care of him since his mother&#39;s passing. You want to everything for him is that correct?&quot; &quot;Yes Lesily,&quot; Josh answered, &quot;I would do anything for him.&quot; &quot;Anything?&quot; &quot;Anything...&quot; Lesily had a coy smile on her face and begins her next act. &quot;Good, very good indeed... Now listen Josh, I want you to take on a different path in life. A path where you and your son will meet. I want you to turn into another person of the opposite sex. A woman if you will. I want you to regress to your son&#39;s current age and have looks of a woman with beauty and intelligence. I also want you to cut off your bond between you and your son so that you are no longer family. Instead, I want to think of you as both boyfriend and girlfriend, and are on a date in this resort. Now when I snap my fingers, you will turn into the very woman I said. Ready? And...&quot;<br />
<br />
-snap-<br />
<br />
The moment she snapped her fingers, Joshua started to change. The audience watch in awe as he started to grow younger. His arms and legs starting to regain its muscles and toneness. The gray streaks on his hair vanished completely, leaving nothing but shiny black hair. His face even looked less rugged as the stubble disappeared completely. His clothes still looked the same, but they shifted to match his new age. Soon enough, Joshua was pretty much the same age as his son, only a little shorter. But as soon as the regression stopped, another change took place. A totally different change.<br />
<br />
Firstly, the muscles he gained started to decrease in stature, but remain toned and shapely like a woman. Then all the hair on his arms and legs thinned and sank back to his skin, leaving it smooth and soft. His hands and feet grew small as well and went dainty with his fingers thinning and nails extending. The beer belly he used to have thinned as he went younger, but here&#39;s the weird part. All that fat transferred from his stomach and all the way up to his chest, as it expanded and grew from small bumps, to cones, A-cups, B-cups, and then straight to well rounded and bouncy D-cups. As for his stomach, his hips started to expand and the sides, creating a curvy hourglass figure. His read joined in on the change as it expanded and rounded into a bubble butt in a shape of an upside down heart. His face did a change as well as it went from rugged and beautiful. His structure went oval like, his nose grew long and thin, his eyes brightened and thinned, and his mouth puffed up and looked kissable. His black hair then grew long and went down to his mid back, rearranging itself into a ponytail that was bouncy. Now Joshua&#39;s last change was that of his nether regions as it tingled and shrank in. His penis shriveled as his mushroom head compressed, looking like a small colitis while his balls migrated inward and morphed into ovaries. As his already small shaft disappeared and a split took its place, his privates went from being a male to female equipment.<br />
<br />
With Joshua a full-grown woman, he (or she) entered the next stage of her change. Her clothes. Being that they were now male, they then morphed and shifted around to match her body. Her Hawaiian shirt started to open up by itself and reveal a plain white T-shirt, but then changed into something more fitting. The buttons vanished as a zipper replaced them, while the Hawaiian designed darkened to just plain black. The texture of the shirt went from cloth to leather as pockets appeared in between. It was then that her Hawaiian shirt now looks like a leather jacket. Of course with her jacket opened up, her white T-shirt was showing and that too changed. The bottom hem of her shirt had risen up and reveal her thin waist and belly button until it stopped midway. The color turned bright pink and shifted to fit nicely around her chest while a bra materialized underneath. This made her shirt into a pink belly shirt. Her shorts were next to go as her bottom leggings grew and merged together and the rest turned skin tight, it too changed color from brown to black and went completely shiny, creating a skin tight skirt that goes to the middle of her thighs. Her sandals changed too as the back end grew heels that go up to three inches and enclosed her feet all around. The color then went black and shiny too and became a pair of sexy like high heels. Finally, light brown pantyhose grew out of the shoes and raised up to her skit, making her legs look sleek and firm. Finally, jewelry begins to appear around her as earnings appeared on her ears, a necklace wrapped around her neck, and a ring on her finger. Eyeliner and lipstick applied it self to her face.<br />
<br />
Lesily looked at the changed woman and was impressed by what she done. But she wondered if everything had changed. So she approached her and said, &quot;If you hear me, then tell me who are you?&quot; The woman was still in a trance and said, &quot;My name is Joy, Joy Sanders.&quot; Lesily smiled and knew that Joasua is now Joy and there was no relation between her and her once son. So she continued, &quot;Now Joy, who is the man next to you?&quot; &quot;That man is my boyfriend, Daniel Rodriguez.&quot; she stated, &quot;I met him a few years ago when he helped my dad in a case. I was there for help and it sort of clicked between us. We&#39;ve been dating since then and this resorts is a special gift for me.&quot; Lesily smiled and could tell that she altered reality. &quot;Isn&#39;t that sweet...&quot; she said as she turned to the audience and said, &quot;And so ladies and gentlemen, this father and son has now become boyfriend and girlfriend. Now for my next trick...&quot;</p>
