<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey Johnny, how long has it been since you had to go to the bathroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... uhh... don&#39;t recall...&quot; said Johnny a little nervously. And that&#39;s where Doug saw where Nancy was going with this. After all his change on Johnny&#39;s bladder only took effect moving forward--it didn&#39;t erase all the past history of it being as small as a walnut. And so Johnny&#39;s nervousness over always &quot;having to go&quot; still remained, even if it didn&#39;t have the bladder to match anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, why don&#39;t just go and make sure. We wouldn&#39;t want any accidents&quot; hinted Nancy rather heavily, and Johnny got up and hurried off and out of the cafeteria as though he had to go. Nancy smiled, proud at her cleverness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m starting to remember that whenever I didn&#39;t want him hanging around, I&#39;d convince him that he had to go,&quot; said Nancy with an odd tint to her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he&#39;ll only go if a kid his age would have to now, keep that in mind,&quot; said Doug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most kids have to go after lunch, so we should be safe. Any ideas on how to fix him remembering?&quot; asked Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only other thing I can think of... is if we make another change that interacts with the one he remembers so it confuses what he thinks he remembers happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t know about you, but I rather like the changes you gave to Marija,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... I don&#39;t want to change her again either, but you know what we could her that wouldn&#39;t change her, per se.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;A boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment the janitor who would be responsible for sweeping the cafeteria after lunch came in and rolled his cleaning cart into the cafeteria and set it on the edge of the room. He&#39;d begin work in 5 - 10 minutes when the students would start filing out for lunch. Mr. Khalid Najjar was a medium to short height man in his early 60s if Doug recalled correctly. He had escaped Syria about a decade ago and despite having an advanced degree back in Syria, he had settled for doing the work of a janitor here because many saw his age and race and didn&#39;t want to hire him for a mixture of the two. He was a bit portly, gray hair with a mustache, a tan Arabic complexion that had faded and now appeared slightly sallow in color. Despite being portly about his gut, Khalid Najjar had a bit of a pitted face that looked tired and worn out from everything he&#39;d seen and experienced.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that Khalid Najjar was a sixteen year old junior about to turn seventeen in a month, and that he would be dating Marija&quot; said Doug, and both Nancy and Doug turned to see what effect the wish would have on the janitor.<br />
<br />
As Khalid walked over towards where the lunch ladies and Marija were, he started to look as though he were shedding pounds off his frame. His janitorial jump suit was looking far less round about his gut and the muscles of a younger man started to appear through the rolled up sleeves. Alabaster black color was quickly returning to Khalid&#39;s hair and mustache, along with his tan appearing as though he went outside more often than not. His face seemed to freshen up as his fifties gave way to his forties, and though he still looked a little tired and worn from everything he&#39;d seen in life, he also looked far more capable of taking the punches life had thrown his way. <br />
<br />
By the time Khalid had re-entered his thirties, all sign of gray hair was completely gone, and his navy blue jump suit was now being pushed out by muscles--especially from his upper body--and no longer the gut he&#39;d had as an older man. He looked like a man in his prime, a prime which kept getting younger and stronger as he re-entered his twenties. It was about this time that Doug noticed that Khalid&#39;s haircut and sneakers suddenly shifted to styles a little more fashionable than the older Khalid had worn. His hair now cut into a stylish fade that teenagers and young adults were seen sporting, and his sneakers were a set of pure white sneakers--something completely at odd with his job as a janitor, which now given his age, was something that Khalid was making do with while he was putting himself through college. A sort of can-do cocky assertiveness now pervaded Khalid&#39;s entire behavior and attitude. Gone was the man worn out and tired from life, and quickly replacing him was the young over-eager, grinning and confident young man he was becoming.<br />
<br />
College quickly gave way to high school age and Khalid&#39;s biggest transformation here was how his mustache thinned before shrinking to just a few set of scraggly hairs on his upper lip, his jawline and facial features softened and rounded a bit, giving him the air of a boyish handsome teenager, his muscles shrank to those more proportional for a lean teen&#39;s physique, and Doug could swear that Khalid now lost a few inches in height, not a whole lot, but enough that the jump suit that had fitted him just fine as an adult, seemed just a few inches too big on him now. The last thing to change about him was his jump suit, separating into two--a t-shirt with a faded design printed on it, and a pair of rather tight skinny jeans. His bleach white sneakers were still on his feet, and a small silver necklace with a crescent moon on it dangled from around his neck. And it was at this point that Khalid Najjar stopped de-aging as a sixteen year old junior about to turn seventeen next month.<br />
<br />
Doug now remembered Khalid differently, he had moved here about a decade ago as a refugee from Syria with his parents and grandma. He&#39;d had trouble fitting in with the rest of the school at first until one day the quiet kid started cracking jokes and exuding charisma like no one had ever seen from him before. Doug&#39;s older mind recognized the young Khalid&#39;s behavior as overcompensation in an attempt to better adapt to his surroundings, but by god did it work and make Khalid rather popular from that moment on as he cemented himself first as the class clown, and then the class clown with a heart of gold that had earned him a date with at least most of the girls in Doug and Nancy&#39;s grades. Though it wasn&#39;t until Marija had shown up that Khalid had gone from Arabic playboy clown to someone with a bit more seriousness to his demeanor. Khalid had been the first person in the school to welcome Marija with not a bit of reticence. Perhaps it was due to the fact that they both had known what it was like to be refugees in a strange land, perhaps it was because they both were outsiders in their own ways, perhaps it was just because he made her laugh, but soon Marija and Khalid were dating... seriously dating if the rumors among Doug&#39;s classmates were to be believed, and the show that Khalid and Marija were now giving the cafeteria as Khalid&#39;s walk across the cafeteria ended with him sliding his arm about her waist, pulling her close and then kissing her right there and then in front of the entire cafeteria--which apparently was used to such displays from the two of them, though the lunch monitors were on top of it and en route to suggest the two take their kissing elsewhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... they&#39;re really going to town,&quot; commented Nancy.<br />
<br />
Part of Doug wanted to suggest that they join the two, but the other part saw Johnny returning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kissing? Eww, gross,&quot; said Johnny as he returned to his seat, apparently none the wiser for the change to the janitor and apparently no longer concerned with the vanishing lunch lady.<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t so opposed to the idea yourself earlier this morning with that girl you kept staring at,&quot; suggested Doug slyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Johnny taking an interest in girls? Which one, I need to know so I can... ruin it for him,&quot; teased Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t interested!&quot; protested Johnny with a blush that told the truth.<br />
<br />
&quot;The brunette who&#39;s pretending to be the picky eater for FCS,&quot; said Doug to Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erica? You like Erica?&quot; asked Nancy to Johnny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it!&quot; protested Johnny as he avoided both Nancy and Doug&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I will have to have a talk with her... later,&quot; said Nancy, clearly having fun teasing Johnny, who responded with a punch to Nancy&#39;s side and a sullen look as if to say &quot;you better not&quot;.</p>
