<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>HUGE thanks to rawr7 for helping out with this chapter! Seriously, this chapter wouldn’t be as good as it is without their help.<br/>
<br/>
It’s also worth noting that at this point, the events of this story are happening alongside the events of the main storyline. If you aren’t reading that one, then I highly recommend you do in order to see some sides of the story that might not be mentioned here.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark wandered around the floor of Body, looking at the various activities there were to do. Wrestling, races, boxing…everything here was so unique and interesting! Mark had never been a gambler before, but he was finding it harder and harder to resist trying out just one of the various machines.<br />
<br />
The fox’s gaze landed on a large arcade booth with red privacy curtains. It looked like a normal arcade shooter that he’d seen dozens of times before, like Time Trouble or Mansion of the Dead 2. On the back of the machine, the words <b>THE SEX GAME</b> were printed in big, bold letters that could be easily read from a distance.<br />
<br />
“The Sex Game?” Mark said, reading the title of the machine aloud to himself. “Haven’t heard of that game before. Not a very creative name…maybe I should check it out…”<br />
<br />
Curiosity getting the better of him, the fox approached the machine. He pulled back the privacy curtain and peered inside.<br />
<br />
The inside of the machine was roomy, able to fit two people on the large bench inside it. Above the bench were two safety harnesses not unlike those you’d find on a roller coaster. The bench faced a large screen that presumably displayed the game’s contents. However, no demo screen showed the game’s content while pestering players to insert coins. The screen was just…black.<br />
<br />
“This is weird…” Mark said to himself, stepping inside the machine.<br />
<br />
The fox took a seat on the bench, and the screen suddenly lit up.<br />
<br />
“Please insert chips,” a female-sounding robotic voice suddenly said.<br />
<br />
Below the screen were two illuminated coin slots. Mark looked at the slots for a couple of seconds before slipping his chips of Mind, Body, and Soul into them without thinking. Once all three chips were inserted, a catchy little jingle played.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to the Sex Game,” the female robotic voice said. “In this game, a scenario will be transmitted directly into your mind and realistically replicated using our state-of-the-art technology. Resist the scenario for long enough, and your chips will not only be returned to you, but you will also receive a new set of Mind, Body, and Soul chips. Please pull down your safety harness now.”<br />
<br />
Mark reached up and did as he was told. As soon as the harness latched down, the screen shifted to a display of bright swirling colors. The fox couldn’t help but stare at them, finding himself unable to look away…<br />
<br />
The privacy curtain was pulled back rather forcefully, and a rather panicked-looking minotaur peeked in the machine. Prime Xarxos.<br />
<br />
“Mark, you idiot!” the minotaur exclaimed, shielding his eyes as he stepped inside the machine. “These machines are designed to take your chips! You can’t just wander in here and expect things to go well!”<br />
<br />
The minotaur pulled on the safety harness with all his might, trying to lift it up so he could get Mark out, but it was no use. His ring nearly got caught in a strap, which would have been bad, since the ring was actually his Book. That was how they were disguising them this time.<br />
<br />
“<i>Okay, this is bad…</I>“ Xarxos thought. “<I>There has to be a way to get Mark out of here safely. C’mon Xarxos, think!</I>“<br />
<br />
The minotaur’s gaze shifted to the second glowing coin slot. Mark was a complete idiot that wouldn’t be able to resist whatever the machine had in store for him, but Xarxos was a different story.<br />
<br />
“Xarxos? What are you doing?” The minotaur turned around and poked his head out from the privacy curtains to see Troy standing there, a confused look on his face.<br />
<br />
“Mark…the fox, not the elf…wandered into the sex machine,” Xarxos explained.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I know, I told you he’d gone in there.” Troy said. “But it’s not a big deal. They have copies of his chips.”<br />
<br />
“It’s a big deal because of how that machine works!” Xarxos pointed at the screen. “It’s reading his mind. As in, anything we’ve discussed is being downloaded as we speak!”<br />
<br />
“Shit!” Troy looked around. “Well…what are we gonna do?”<br />
<br />
“I’m going in to get him out.” Xarxos said.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
“What?!” Troy squawked. “But you could get transformed in there!”<br />
<br />
“Not if I resist the machine’s temptations,” the bull-man replied. “Plus I have my Book. I’ll be perfectly fine, Troy. Trust me.”<br />
<br />
He turned around and slipped his chips of Mind, Body, and Soul into the coin slot before sitting down on the bench, about to pull the safety harness down over his shoulders, when Troy suddenly came in and grabbed his hand.<br />
<br />
“I think I saw another machine somewhere on the floor,” the phoenix said, holding Xarxos’ hand close to his chest. “I’ll get in that one and help you. We have a spare set of chips, so you can change me back if something happens.”&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
“No, absolutely not.”<br />
<br />
“But-”<br />
<br />
“I said no, Troy!”<br />
<br />
“You-!” The phoenix opened his beak to say something, but just sighed in defeat. “Fine. Just…please be careful…”<br />
<br />
“I will be. I promise.” Xarxos pulled his hand away and pulled the safety harness down. He looked over to Mark and shook his head in frustration. “You owe me big time for this, you damn fox.”<br />
<br />
Then, he looked at the screen.<br />
<br />
As Xarxos entered the simulation, Troy stepped out of the machine and looked at the ring in his hand, a slight smirk on his beak. <br />
<br />
“Sorry Xarxos,” he said to himself. “You’re not getting out of here unchanged.”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
<br />
Xarxos loaded into the simulation rather quickly. Immediately, he began to look around the virtual room he’d been placed in. The simulation appeared to have put him at a truck stop in the middle of nowhere. He could see at least five large trucks parked under the filling station nearby. Behind him was a fairly large building for truckers to come in and rest for a while before getting back on the road.<br />
<br />
“Xarxos?” The minotaur turned around and saw Mark standing behind him, a confused look on his face. “Xarxos, what are you doing here?”<br />
<br />
“I’m here to rescue you, idiot!” he said. “Why the hell did you put your chips in the machine?! These things are rigged! If you don’t resist the machine, you’re going to be transformed and lose your chips to the casino!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, would you calm down and relax a little?” Mark groaned. “You don’t think I didn’t already know that when I put my chips in? I chose this machine because I think it&#39;s one I can win. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I don’t know,” the minotaur replied sarcastically. “How about becoming a mindless servant to the casino because you couldn’t keep your dick in your pants for a few minutes?!”<br />
<br />
“Man, fuck you!” Mark turned around and stormed off towards the bathroom, with Xarxos following close behind.<br />
<br />
The fox threw open the door to the men’s restroom and walked in. The restroom was fairly large, with three urinals and three stalls. A large, full-length mirror and a counter with three sinks were on the wall adjacent to the door leading to the outside world. There was only one person inside the bathroom when the two entered: a rather large bear. He appeared to be in his late forties or very early fifties. He was wearing a white tank top that stretched around a sizeable beer belly and a pair of jeans. On his head was a red and white hat with netting in the back. He was busy washing his hands, whistling to himself as he did so. When he turned off the sink, he turned to the door and stopped in his tracks upon seeing Mark and Xarxos.<br />
<br />
“My oh my, what do we have here?” the bear drawled. “Could it be that you two fine young gentlemen have come to help out an old trucker like myself before he gets back on the road?”<br />
<br />
Xarxos opened his mouth to respond, but Mark cut him off.<br />
<br />
“Yes, yes I am!” the fox said. “Not sure you’ll be able to get any help from this stick-in-the-mud, though.”<br />
<br />
“What the hell are you doing?!” Xarxos hissed under his breath. “You’re just giving yourself to the machine at this point!”<br />
<br />
“But that’s where you’re wrong,” Mark whispered back. “I’ve got a plan.”<br />
<br />
“Oh really? And what is your so-called ‘plan?’”<br />
<br />
“Simple: the machine wants to brainwash and transform me during sex, right? So, if I just ‘blow’ my way through the simulation, it’ll be over with before you know it.”<br />
<br />
Xarxos stared at the fox in disbelief. “Th…That’s literally what the machine wants you to do, dumbass!” he shouted, resisting the urge to slap some sense into Mark.<br />
<br />
“So…” the trucker spoke up, getting the two men’s attention. “Are you two gonna help a fella out, or..?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’ll help you out,” Mark said, approaching the bear.<br />
<br />
Xarxos simply huffed and leaned against the wall, ready to watch the shitshow unfold.<br />
<br />
The bear grinned as Mark approached, reaching down to undo his jeans. When he undid the button, he pulled them down and revealed a massive, beer can thick cock that had to be at least a foot long. Mark’s eyes widened upon seeing the thick beast in front of him, realizing that he’d have to fit that thing in his mouth.<br />
<br />
The bear laughed at Mark’s reaction. “What?” he asked. “Never seen a real man’s cock before?”<br />
<br />
“Just let me suck your cock and shut the fuck up.” The fox dropped to his knees and opened his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Eager to get started now, are we?” the trucker asked. “I like that in my sluts.”<br />
<br />
Before Mark could react to what the bear said, the trucker shoved his massive equipment into the fox’s muzzle. Mark’s eyes widened as the cock slid into his mouth, the sweaty taste and musky smell completely overwhelming his senses. He tried to pull away, but the bear put a large paw on the back of Mark’s head, trapping him there.<br />
<br />
“Ah ah ah,” the bear said, shaking his head. “You’re not trying to back out on me, are ya foxy boy? You’re gonna have to take this nice and slow if you want your reward.”<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, Mark began to slowly bob his head up and down the length of the ursine’s massive cock. The head alone was so thick that the fox could barely fit it in his small muzzle.<br />
<br />
As the bear pushed his cock in deeper, Mark felt the head touch the back of his throat, causing him to gag slightly. He hoped that the bear would take his cock out and allow him to breathe, but that wasn’t the case. Instead, the bear continued pushing his foot-long length into Mark’s mouth, moaning as it slid down his throat. The fox whimpered slightly as he felt his throat muscles begin to squeeze the ursine cock, trying to swallow it.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, that’s a nice tight throat you got!” the bear moaned, running his claws through the fur on Mark’s head. “You like feeling my thick meat inside your throat?”<br />
<br />
Mark hesitated for a second before realizing something that scared him: he did like it.<br />
<br />
The taste was savory, the smell of the bear’s fur was nice and musky-spicy almost, mouthwatering. As Mark continued to suck the bear’s massive cock, he found himself going slower and being more methodical.<br />
<br />
He took the cock down to the sheathe and paused at the base of the shaft, sniffing the pubic fur. Mark let his throat muscles work the head, and just savored the moment. The throb of the thick veins in his mouth, the little twitches when his tongue hit a particularly sensitive spot. The sweet taste of the bear’s precum.<br />
<br />
Why did he want to rush again? He wanted to keep this delicious cock in his mouth as long as possible. The bear’s paws began to massage his head. The eager fox moaned happily.<br />
<br />
“That’s my little chubby bunny slut,” the bear moaned. “Always willing to please his daddy.”<br />
<br />
Although a small part of Mark’s brain registered that the bear had called him a bunny and not a fox, the fox mostly ignored this. He was too preoccupied with sucking his daddy’s cock to notice that his ears were beginning to grow larger. The bear whispered more encouragement, both paws moving to rub the fox’s growing ears.<br />
<br />
As Xarxos watched all this from the sidelines, he was beginning to feel a bit flustered. It was actually quite hot watching Mark deep-throat such a thick cock. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt if he…no! He had to stay firm and resist the temptation! It was the only way to get out of the machine and save Mark!<br />
<br />
The bear looked up at Xarxos and smirked.<br />
<br />
“Your friend really seems to be enjoying himself,” he said. “Why don’t you come over here and rim my ass?”&#8232;&#8232; <br />
<br />
Xarxos scoffed and rolled his eyes. “Yeah, hard pass,” he said.<br />
<br />
The bear laughed. “Can’t say I didn’t expect that from a man who can’t even fuck his own husband.”<br />
<br />
“What the hell did you just say?!”<br />
<br />
“You heard me. You can’t even fuck your own husband. I mean, you’re married to him, and you can’t even show the poor bird a good time. What kind of a man are you?”<br />
<br />
“What the hell do you know?! You don’t know anything about my love life!”<br />
<br />
“But I do know that it’s probably bland and boring. You’re no man. You don’t even deserve to have a body like that. Hell, you probably can’t even suck dick better than this fella!”<br />
<br />
Xarxos growled, his anger and arrogance beginning to cloud his judgment. “I can too suck dick, and I can do it far better than he can!”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah?” the bear laughed. “Prove it!”<br />
<br />
Unable to control himself, Xarxos marched over to the bear.<br />
<br />
He pulled Mark away from the bear’s cock, dropped down to his knees, and took the cock in his mouth. He furiously bobbed his head up and down the length, making the bear moan and gasp in pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Rim my ass, Mark.” The bear wheezed.<br />
<br />
Mark whimpered and quickly crawled behind the bear, spreading his big furry cheeks and eyeing the sweaty pink hole. As he did, his feet began to grow larger and longer, becoming perfect for jumping and hopping. Mark gave the bear’s ass a tentative sniff and recoiled. It didn’t smell like shit, but it was moist and pungent.<br />
<br />
He leaned forward, closing his eyes, and began to lick gingerly at the slick fur around the bear’s juicy ring. The bear’s little tail wagged. At first, it was musky-far muskier than the bear’s cock had been. The hole tasted coppery…flavor-wise, he’d liken it to something like liver. He lapped deeper, tongue probing beyond the rim of the bear’s asshole.<br />
<br />
The big bruin shifted and Mark felt a big furry paw shove his snout straight into the hole.<br />
<br />
“Ooooh fuck!” the bear moaned, tongue lolling as Mark went to work on his hole and Xarxos furiously sucked his cock. “S-Slow down there! Enjoy yourself a bit! I can’t properly enjoy myself if you go too fast! The little guy is better than you in that regard!”<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, the minotaur began to slow down. He wanted to power his way through this and prove that he was a good cock sucker, but if he had to slow down in order to do that, then so be it. He tried  to ignore the sounds Mark was making on the other side.<br />
<br />
The bear moaned in pleasure as Xarxos slowed down.<br />
<br />
The trucker grabbed the minotaur’s large horns and began to push on them. Surprisingly, they responded to the bear’s pushes, moving up to the top of Xarxos’ head. The bear squeezed them tightly, making them lose their thickness. He began to gently grab parts of the horns and pull them out, turning them into a stunning set of antlers.<br />
<br />
Xarxos, of course, was completely oblivious to all this.<br />
<br />
Mark, meanwhile, had lost himself in eating out the bear’s ass. Mark’s tongue was lapping hard, twirling his tongue as deep as he could into the bear’s savory hole, swallowing his earthy juices. The bear’s paw hadn’t relented, pushing harder and harder on the back of the changing fox’s head. The deeper he was shoved, the more his muzzle shrank. As his muzzle shortened, his nose lost its black color, turning the same shade of pink as the bear’s slick hole. His sharp canine teeth flattened out, becoming much more suited for chewing leafy green vegetables..<br />
<br />
When the bear removed his paw, the soon-to-be-bunny pulled back, gasping for air, completely out of breath.<br />
<br />
Mark wondered why he was so out of it, he could usually go for hours, and looked down.<br />
<br />
To his horror, he realized his body had lost its muscles, pecs softening into little mooblets, a small belly wobbling beneath it, a layer of chub building all over his body from eating fast food on the road. His canine penis had greatly reduced in size, shrinking to about three to four inches. The knot had completely vanished, although it still retained its reddish-pink hue.<br />
<br />
He shook his head, long ears wobbling. No! He was a twunky fox, not some chubby little fucktard!<br />
<br />
“Far too late for that, Mark.” The bear growled and shoved him back into his sweaty ass.<br />
<br />
Mark struggled, sweat and musk and juices smearing themselves in his muzzle, and tried to breathe. He only managed to get more of the bear’s spicy musk in his nose. He gasped as the smell made his mouth water. He tried to push back against the paw, but with his reduced strength he merely got shoved deeper.<br />
<br />
He hadn’t mentioned to snag a quick breath and with his struggles, he was running out of air quick. Mark tried to think of a way out, but there was only one thing the bear clearly wanted. His tongue snaked out and gave the bear’s ass a tentative lick.<br />
<br />
Immediately, the press of the paw relaxed. Mark gave the ring a few more licks and the tension on his head eased.<br />
<br />
The taste was growing on him again, and Mark found himself twirling his tongue in a circle around the bear’s tight ring. The paw lifted from his head and the bunny got in a few quick breaths before he went back to licking his pa’s hole.<br />
<br />
Xarxos continued to suck the bear’s cock and, like Mark, was truly beginning to appreciate how <I>hot</I> the trucker was. His tantalizing musk, girthy cock that gently pulsed with each beat of the ursine’s heart, the big belly Xarxos kept bumping with each bob of his head. Big and masculine, everything Xarxos wasn’t. <br />
<br />
He was so enamored with servicing the bear that he was completely unaware that he was beginning to get much smaller. The cock in his shrinking muzzle felt like it was growing larger and larger, which only added to the excitement Xarxos felt. It wasn’t until he opened his eyes to look up at the hot trucker daddy and gauge his reactions and realized how much farther away the big bear had suddenly gotten that Xarxos realized what was happening. <br />
<br />
Frantically, the bull-man began to try and take the cock out of his mouth and pull his head away, but the bear’s massive paw was keeping his head in place. He balled his hands into fists and began to hit the bear’s gut forcefully in an attempt to get him to let go. This just made the bear laugh.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong, little fawn?” the bear teased. “I thought you liked sucking dick! You were so insistent that you could suck dick better than your chubby bunny friend over here. And you know what, boy? You <I>are</I> better.”<br />
<br />
This made Xarxos feel strangely proud. He was finally getting the recognition he deserved! He was a far better cum slut than Mark was!<br />
<br />
The bull-man shook his head in horror upon realizing what he’d just thought. He threw his fists against the bear a few more times, not realizing how weak each hit was becoming. His muscles were melting away with each hit, turning his once athletic body into a curvy twinkish body.<br />
<br />
“Since you did such a good job at cock sucking, I think you deserve a little reward,” the bear said. <br />
<br />
Grabbing Xarxos’ antlers, he pulled his cock out of the transforming minotaur’s mouth. He then turned Xarxos around rather forcefully and pushed him down onto his hands and knees.<br />
<br />
“You ready to have your daddy’s big, thick ursine dick inside you, Xavier?” the bear asked.<br />
<br />
“N-No!” Xarxos (Xavier?) shouted, his voice sounding a few octaves higher with a slight hint of a country twang to it. “I-I don’t wanna be fucked!”<br />
<br />
“Aww, come now,” the bear said, poking the tip of his cock against the deer’s entrance. “You know you wanna be filled up with your pa’s cum.”<br />
<br />
The bear shoved his maleness into Xarxos’ hole and the deer hollered in pain and pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Pa?” a high-pitched southern voice asked. The bear looked down and saw Mark looking up at him with his big, beady eyes. “Whatcha want me to do?”<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you be a good cub and help Xavier out by giving his cock a good sucking?” the bear suggested.<br />
<br />
Upon hearing that, Mark’s eyes lit up. He scrambled under Xarxos and quickly took the twink’s cock in his mouth. Xarxos moaned out in pleasure, enjoying the feeling of Mark’s velvety tongue and warm mouth. As he succumbed to the pleasure, Xarxos’ shaggy fur began to shorten all over his body.<br />
<br />
“M-Mark…stop it!” Xarxos grunted, his asshole being stretched wide open by his pa’s cock as the bear wedged it through his tight ring. “F-Fight it!”<br />
<br />
But Mark didn’t pay attention to his pleas, as he was already too far gone. The former fox’s tail shrank into his body, turning into a slight numb of fluff. As his ears finished growing, Mark’s transformation into a chubby bunny cum slut was completed.<br />
<br />
Xarxos was desperately trying to fight off the pleasurable feelings from taking over his mind, but they were becoming far too much for him to handle. As the bear’s thrusts began to ram into Xarxos’ prostate, the transforming deer found it harder and harder to remember things from his old life.<br />
<br />
He knew his name wasn’t Xavier, but…what was it supposed to be then?<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t this feel good, Xavier?” the bear growled, watching as cream-colored fur grew in on the deer boy’s chest, the front of his neck, the insides of his calves, and the sides of his muzzle. “You love being filled by pa’s cock, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
Xavier could only whimper as his prostate was rammed again and again and his cock was sucked by his friend Mark. He could feel his cock beginning to shrink from a massive two-foot-long behemoth to a small three-inches long. His bovine tail receded into his body, being replaced by a tuft of fur not too dissimilar to Mark’s tail.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to ask you again,” the bear said, his thrusts becoming harder. “You like being filled by yer pa’s cock, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
“N-no!” Xavier whimpered again, trying to resist.<br />
<br />
The feeling of his prostate being pounded every second…the feeling of his cock in the mouth of a horny bunny…it was too much for him to bear! He just had to hold on…a little…longer…<br />
<br />
“No, huh?” The bear grinned maliciously. “That’s just too bad. There’s worse things you could be, you know.”<br />
<br />
“W-what?” Xavier blinked.<br />
<br />
“See, I read Mark’s mind.” The bear said. “The worst thing he could imagine was, and I quote: ‘getting turned into a chubby little fucktard’. And so there he is.”<br />
<br />
Xavier glanced down at the tubby bunny.<br />
<br />
Mark was completely ignoring their conversation, too busy nuzzling and suckling on the tip of Xavier’s small cock. He thanked the gods the bunny was terrible at giving head.<br />
<br />
“And?” Xavier gasped, forcing the pleasure away easier now.<br />
<br />
“And?” The bear mocked. “My name is ALECK. I’m the AI that runs this Popsicle stand. I’m an extension of Robo-Dolan’s consciousness. And I know all about you. Believe me, you can imagine much, much worse things than being a twink.”<br />
<br />
“I-I can resist this no matter what you change me into!” Xavier shot back. “I just have to outlast the time limit!”<br />
<br />
ALECK smirked. “What time limit?”<br />
<br />
“The game said I just have to outlast you!”<br />
<br />
“True.” The bear nodded, still plowing Xavier’s hole. “But I never specified how LONG the game would be. I’m a computer, idiot. You literally can’t outlast me.”<br />
<br />
“Then…then I’ll override your safety protocols!” Xavier bit down on his tongue, hard enough to draw blood.<br />
<br />
The bear’s arm snapped forward and his big paw wrenched Xavier’s jaw open.<br />
<br />
“You do that to me and you’ll walk out of here a pregnant woman.” ALECK growled.<br />
<br />
“L-let me go!” Xavier moaned.<br />
<br />
“Come on Xavier.” ALECK said, sill thrusting. “You know I’m not letting you out of here unchanged. I am the House, after all. Actually, come to think of it, I scanned Troy when he ducked his head into the booth earlier. Maybe I turn you into something that tickles his fancy.”<br />
<br />
“Hunnngh...!” Xavier fought down another orgasm. “Y-you scanned him that fast?”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t get his life story, just the last day or so.” ALECK smirked. “Yeah, let’s go with that.”<br />
<br />
Xavier felt his muscles swell again, spine popping as he grew to six feet, four inches tall. His cock grew as well, swelling back to a respectable 7 inches and a meaty inch and a half circumference. Soon, a fine, handsome, muscular buck had replaced the twink.<br />
<br />
“Nice.” ALECK commented. “But too perfect. Let’s roughen you up.”<br />
<br />
The fur around the deer’s muzzle lengthened and twisted into a short goatee. His lean, athletic frame began to sag a bit, a little beer belly swelling, frame thickening with chub, pecs softening-not into moobs, but clearly the deer was a bit out of shape. The only thing untouched was his perfect bubblebutt.<br />
<br />
“Too many impossiburgers and craft beers.” ALECK smirked. “Not too fat, just enough to mar you. That’ll draw him in.”<br />
<br />
“Who?” Xavier panted.<br />
<br />
“Troy, of course!” ALECK smirked. “Book owner. You’re my little Trojan horse.”<br />
<br />
“No, no!” Fear pushed away any orgasm that had been building in him.<br />
<br />
“Alabaman accent, you’re nouveau rich and raring for some fun.” ALECK nodded to himself. “Looking for a daddy to fill your hole.”<br />
<br />
Xavier shook his head, trying to shake off the memories that were threatening to erase him.<br />
<br />
“Look on the bright side, he’ll probably sense the trap and stop you.” ALECK shrugged. “But you can’t blame me for taking the shot. Boss’s orders.”<br />
<br />
“I-I can’t!” Xavier tried to squirm away from the bear’s grip.<br />
<br />
“We need to finish the scenario.” The bear smirked and adjusted his grip, moving his hands to the deer’s antlers and using them as handlebars.<br />
<br />
Xavier gasped, anal ring spasming as the cock inside him swelled a little larger, stretching him more fully, thrusting more deeply. Below him, Mark’s cock-sucking skills suddenly increased, his tongue licking more firmly, swirling around his head expertly.<br />
<br />
“You’re quite the stud, deer boy.” The bear said, one hand circling around and jiggling the buck’s little tummy. “Getting a little lazy with your workout days, huh?”<br />
<br />
“No, I..” Xavier panted, desperately fighting two battles-his identity and his orgasm. He couldn’t beat both.<br />
<br />
“Ain’t no shame in it, boy.” The bear lifted his gut and dropped it on the deer’s back, using it as a shelf, letting his thrust deeper. “I got myself a keg. Stick with me long enough…”<br />
<br />
“S-stop-” The deer burped and tasted beer on his tongue. His belly wobbled a little, swelling a bit, just enough to sag. “It ain’t like that!”<br />
<br />
“Sure it is. Unemployment for half a year’ll do that to a man. You’re young, bored, and looking for excitement,” The bear thrust and laid his head across the buck’s shoulders. “Direction.”<br />
<br />
“I…” The buck couldn’t deny the bear’s words any more than he could deny the orgasm he could feel welling up inside him.<br />
<br />
“Out of college, looking for someone to take charge.” ALECK’s long bear tongue lapped the air happily, loving the buck’s tight hole. “And you found Troy. Hot phoenixkin. But he’s not perfect. He ain’t pa.”<br />
<br />
Xavier whimpered, hooflets curling, seeing Troy in his mind’s eye.<br />
<br />
“And what do you love most, Xavier?” The bear whispered.<br />
<br />
The bear’s thrusts somehow picked up speed and power again, causing Xavier to moan loudly. Mark’s sucking also picked up, his mouth sucking on his cock as if it were a vacuum.<br />
<br />
“I-I…” Xavier was so close, now.<br />
<br />
“Yes…say it…” the bear growled. “Tell me what you love.”<br />
<br />
“I…I love having your cock inside me, pa!” Xavier cried, and a tension that he hadn’t noticed before eased away, his body tingling. <br />
<br />
The bear grinned triumphantly, relentlessly pounding the buck’s ass.<br />
<br />
Pleasure engulfed him and this time he didn’t push it away or try to stop it. Xavier’s eyes rolled into the back of his head as he willingly relaxed into to it. It was too much, he couldn’t hang on anymore, he was going over the cliff, plunging down into an orgasm-<br />
<br />
“Pa, I’m gonna-!” The buck’s hole quivered, balls tensing as he finally surrendered.<br />
<br />
ALECK threw his head back and roared as he reached his climax. Hot ursine cum flooded his guts. Xavier cried out in pleasure and reached his own climax, shooting his own warm creamy load into Mark’s wonderful mouth, erasing the last bits of Xarxos that remained.<br />
<br />
The bear’s orgasm seemed to last for an eternity, but eventually, it finally died down. When he finished cumming, the bear pulled his cock out of Xavier’s overly-stretched asshole. He smirked as cum dripped out of the gaping hole, and the buck just moaned in pleasure.<br />
<br />
“You boys made yer pa real proud today,” ALECK said, kneeling down and picking the two of them up in his big, strong arms. “Now come on, let’s get back on the road.”<br />
<br />
“O-Okay pa,” Xavier moaned in his cute southern accent.<br />
<br />
“Can we do that again real soon pa?” Mark asked, his tiny pink rabbit nose twitching slightly as cum dripped down his muzzle.<br />
<br />
“Of course we can, my horny boys,” the bear said, opening the door to the restroom and carrying his boys outside and paused. “Oh, and one last thing before you go, Xavier…”<br />
<br />
The bear whispered something Xavier’s ear.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
<br />
“Simulation complete. Player 1 wins!”<br />
<br />
The swirling colors on the screen stopped, and Mark and Xavier could freely think again. The cub and the buck lifted their harnesses up before grabbing their respective chips and stepping out of the machine.<br />
<br />
“That felt so good!” Mark said, the chubby bunny groping himself. Semen dribbled down his legs, nearly invisible against the white of his fur. He must have cum at some point during the simulation, but he couldn’t remember when.<br />
<br />
“I know! Why’d all that have to be fake?!” Xavier drawled, the cum dripping down his thighs and the front of his prominent beer belly much more visible.<br />
<br />
The machine buzzed a small victory fanfare and a box at the side opened up. In it were two sets of clothes with their names on them. Xavier took his and got dressed in a dark green shirt and camo shorts. Mark’s outfit was similar. As the bunny reached for his clothes, he found a set of three chips sitting on top of them.<br />
<br />
“Guess this is my prize for lasting longer than you,” Mark said. He took a look at the chips. “Huh…a fox body…guess I can use that to attract some men looking for a good time.”<br />
<br />
The chubby bunny and the off-season athlete were soon dressed and ready to roll.<br />
<br />
“Hey, I gotta go find someone right quick. You go on, find Todd and the others, okay?” Xavier said.<br />
<br />
Mark nodded, eyeing a plate of hot wings one of the servants was carrying around. Xavier left and Mark took the plate of wings when the servant wasn’t looking. He sucked the wings down to the bone, chewing the caps at the end. They were bad for him, he was a herbivore, but they were just so damn tasty!<br />
<br />
The tubby bunny was licking his fingers clean when he spotted a twunk fox walking around, seemingly looking for someone.<br />
<br />
“Hey Todd!” Mark exclaimed. “Todd! Over here!”<br />
<br />
The fox heard his name being called and ran over, only for his eyes to widen in shock.<br />
<br />
“M-Mark?” he asked, stuttering. “M-Mark…what happened to you?!”<br />
<br />
“Nothing happened, silly!” Mark giggled. “I’m the same ole chubby bunny I’ve always been!”<br />
<br />
The fox noticed the chips in Mark’s hand and he sighed in relief. <br />
<br />
“Oh thank God,” Todd said. “You won the game. Here, let me help you.” <br />
<br />
Todd took the chips from Mark’s hand and pressed them against the back of the bunny’s skull.<br />
<br />
Mark’s vision jumped, and the fox took a few steps backward, looking around the casino in confusion.<br />
<br />
“Huh?! What the-?! Where the hell am I?! What happened?!”<br />
<br />
“Calm down Mark,” Todd said, grabbing the white-furred fox’s shoulders. “Give it a second to all sink in…”<br />
<br />
“I…there was a sex machine…” Mark said slowly. “I…I put my chips in and…now I’m here…” His eyes widened upon realizing what happened. “Oh my God, you saved me, Todd!”<br />
<br />
The bigger fox passionately kissed the smaller fox. Todd didn’t object to the kiss, but he quickly broke it.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t save you from the machine,” he said. “I used your old chips to turn you back. You won the game!” The fox held up the chips that had been in Mark. “These chips turned you into a slutty, chubby bunny. Hold on to them if you want…”<br />
<br />
Mark reluctantly took the chips from Todd.<br />
<br />
“So what happened?” Todd asked.<br />
<br />
“I dunno…” Mark shook his head. “I went into the machine and everything after that was a blur.”<br />
<br />
Todd pulled the curtain just enough to check if anyone else was in it.<br />
<br />
“Uh, looks like it’s a two-seater.” Todd said. “Anyone else in there with you?”<br />
<br />
“A two seater?” Realization struck Mark. “Fuck! Prime Xarxos!”<br />
<br />
“What about him?”<br />
<br />
“I vaguely remember hearing his voice when the machine turned on! He must’ve gotten changed by the machine too!”<br />
<br />
“Where is he?” Todd asked<br />
<br />
“I dunno, he must have wandered off!”<br />
<br />
“Shit, this isn’t good,” Todd said. “We need to find Troy and the others. Fast!”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Troy had been very attentive for the first five minutes after he’d tricked his husband into entering the Sex Game. However, ten minutes had passed and the minotaur had still failed to emerge. Troy was many things, but patient was not one of them.<br />
<br />
So he walked over to a wrestling tournament, found a table that gave him a view of the Sex Machine, and watched the matches. They were hot, sometimes, but most people weren’t transformed or anything-this Floor was meant to help people earn chips, not lose them-so his interest had waned.<br />
<br />
“Hey there good lookin’.” A smooth voice drawled from Troy’s elbow.<br />
<br />
Troy looked up from the game and noticed the deer next to him.<br />
<br />
He looked like a handsome and somewhat athletic redneck, though his twunky frame was marred by soft pecs and a small beer belly that stretched his dark green Biller-Lite shirt. There was a curve under his chin that suggested the beginnings of a second. His a nice, thick ass made the brown camo cargo shorts he was wearing, which Troy would never be caught dead in, vastly more appealing.<br />
<br />
All the flaws about him were fixable with the Book of Body, of course. Or maybe a month at the gym if his metabolism was fast, as was the case for most anthro deer Troy knew. A fixer-upper, one might say.<br />
<br />
Troy smiled at the deer, glancing towards the Sex Game. The privacy curtain had been pulled back, meaning that Xarxos and Mark had both left the machine. That meant that the deer in front of him was more than likely the former minotaur.<br />
<br />
“Xarxos?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Close, but not quite,” the deer said, rubbing Troy’s arm. “It’s Xavier, remember?”<br />
<br />
“Right, silly me,” Troy said. “Just a slip of the tongue.”<br />
<br />
“Wanna grab a beer?” The deer licked his lips.<br />
<br />
“Sure.” Troy led the way to the bar.<br />
<br />
He wondered how he’d go about fixing his new playmate. No big changes, of course. If he wanted the deer to be skinnier and lose that weight, then he’d cast a spell, take him to the gym, watch him lose thirty pounds while working out. That was hotter and more satisfying than instant weight loss was.<br />
<br />
As Troy’s mind whirled with possibilities, he failed to note the deer behind him had a smirk on his face.</p>
