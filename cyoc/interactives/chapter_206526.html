<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Alright, your turn JLTF</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd was angry. <br />
<br />
That stupid jock tiger man had thrown him completely off balance at the American Restaurant he worked at tonight. He spent the rest of his shift-all one hour of it, as it turned out-fumbling with his orders and generally screwing up until the manager got fed up and sent him home. <br />
<br />
How the hell did he even know about reality distorting dynamics, anyways?<br />
<br />
Todd had managed to land an AP class at the local college and his work on theoretical physics and computational algorithms that calculated quantum theory (the Observer Affect) had quickly attracted the attentions of a certain company. Transdem Labs had offered him a full ride and funding plus a guaranteed job placement within their company.<br />
<br />
What they did was very hush-hush, though he knew that it involved particle physics. Something that involved a super computer and a constant observation and rearrangement of particles. It meant that reality distorting dynamics-the ability to literally alter the observable reality-was possible, at least in a very localized area. And by that, he thought they meant ‘an atom’, but apparently it could theoretically be done on a grander scale, causing a quantum alteration.<br />
<br />
And now stupid fucking Jeff said he’d somehow done so. Which was impossible. You’d need at least a way to freeze the local area to absolute zero, so cold no particle could even move. Then you’d need to rearrange said particles. Then, in order for things to change, you’d need to convert it into a wave, creating a ‘ripple’ of reality as the entire universe realigned to that specific alteration.<br />
<br />
You simply couldn’t do that at home or with an app or…you’d need a superconductor. And anti-matter. And a cryochamber. And power for all of that…<br />
<br />
Todd guessed that technically you could do it at a very small scale, which meant hyper-miniaturization of all those system, because, theoretically, if you figured out how to perform a ‘ripple’, then you’d only need to tweak a few particles to set off a chain reaction that would do all of that for you. And if you just had a program, you could-again, theoretically-activate a device via the internet to do it. A central location like a well-funded lab… <br />
<br />
Shit.<br />
<br />
That stupid fucking jock might actually be telling the truth. But how did he even know about all that? Transdem couldn’t have been so stupid as to field test it with random volunteers…right? That kind of reality alteration could literally kill the universe. Or not. It was all very theoretical.<br />
<br />
He pulled his beat-up clunker out of the American Restaurant’s parking lot and drove home. Todd wanted to pick a few things up. Plus, Charlie had messaged him and told him he was already at his house.<br />
<br />
Poor guy. <br />
<br />
Todd’s parents basically let him live with them. He was from a very poor family and they were too busy with drugs to feed him. Charlie wasn’t as smart as he was, but he was still a dorky nerd. He was probably in Todd’s room watching Viewtube videos or something.<br />
<br />
He pulled into his driveway just as his car stalled out. Todd sighed. Not like his parents could afford to feed someone else. Their own house was well-kept but he didn’t have a good computer or a current game system. They barely had anything.<br />
<br />
If reality could be altered, he’d like to get a windfall of cash.<br />
<br />
He dropped off his things. His parents weren’t home yet. Dad worked night shift and mom was second shift. Todd considered making dinner so she wouldn’t have to. He started a pot boiling. Maybe they could make some spaghetti or something.<br />
<br />
Todd walked into his room. Charlie was there, playing Smash. The dorky black kid was overweight and had thick glasses. He got picked on at school by other kids. They called him Fat Urkel. Todd felt bad, because he only had those glasses because his parents couldn’t afford two hundred dollars for a proper prescription.<br />
<br />
“Sup Todd.” Charlie said, not looking away from the game. <br />
<br />
“I might be going out. Work.” Todd said. “Can you make spaghetti before my mom comes home?”<br />
<br />
“Sure.” Charlie replied.<br />
<br />
Todd stared at him. Would he actually do it? For some reason, he wasn’t so sure. He grabbed some clean clothes-baggy jeans and an equally baggy t-shirt-and went to the bathroom to change and shower.<br />
<br />
His phone rang when he’d shucked off his dirty clothes. Todd answered it, staring at his portly figure in the mirror. Little dick, acne and a gut. No wonder he never got any tips.<br />
<br />
It was Jeff. He considered letting it ring. But…he never gave that stupid jock his number. So how did he know it? Todd answered it.<br />
<br />
“What?” Todd asked.<br />
<br />
“Uh, you coming over, bro?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Taking a shower and coming right over. This better be worth it.”<br />
<br />
“It is, it is!” Jeff paused. “Hey, uh…is this thing harmful?”<br />
<br />
Todd rolled his eyes. “You mean besides changing the fabric of reality?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. It won’t, like, give me cancer or something, right?”<br />
<br />
“Who knows.” Todd said shortly. Then he frowned. “No. You probably wouldn’t even feel it either. Maybe a tingle or a warmness in your body. It freezes particles back at whatever lab it came from and the resulting ‘ripple’ hits you a second later.”<br />
<br />
“So it isn’t hitting me with this emitter?”<br />
<br />
“Emitter….” Todd thought hard. “It probably bounces particles off the target so the machine knows the location of the particles it needs to alter. Then it sets off a chain reaction targeting those particles.”<br />
<br />
“Can it…”<br />
<br />
“Look, man, I’ll be there in twenty minutes. Just let me shower.” Todd snapped.<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Jeff sounded oddly sad. “Did I do anything to you?”<br />
<br />
“No. You ignored me like everyone else.” Todd said. “Bye.”<br />
<br />
“...Bye, Todd. See you in a bit.”<br />
<br />
Jeff hung up.<br />
<br />
Todd tossed the phone on top of his fresh clothes and stepped into the shower.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--<br />
<br />
Finn sat at the computer while he waited for Jeff to finish showering. <br />
<br />
The READ-ME file hadn’t contained anything except installation instructions. He decided to find out Todd’s profile. He punched in the nerd’s first and last name. <b>[SEARCHING…]</b> appeared on the screen. Four matches came up. Finn pulled the most likely one.<br />
<br />
Perfect match. Nerdy, worked at American Restaurant. High IQ. It was definitely him.<br />
<br />
Finn remembered the warning Jeff had given him. Any reality alteration he made could affect everyone around them in unexpected ways. If he did decided to do something-and he hadn’t, yet-he wouldn’t do anything terrible to the guy. Like turn him into a brand-new Hummer to replace Finn’s crappy beat-up old truck.<br />
<br />
He drummed his hooflets on the desk. The shower turned on in the bathroom. He had about five minutes to do whatever he wanted and then go back to the main window so Jeff wouldn’t know what Finn had changed. Honestly, he wasn’t 100% sure that he even believed something like this could exist.<br />
<br />
Finn actually felt kinda bad for Todd after looking over his profile. <br />
<br />
3 inch dick? Sweet Lamb Jesus, that wouldn’t do at all!<br />
<br />
No wonder he was so defensive! Todd was super short and pudgy and ended up looking a bit like a hobbit. So, Finn mused, let’s give him some height, trim that fat, maybe add, say a hundred pounds of muscles…was that a lot? No, just to be safe, a hundred fifty. Interests…he was nerdy and liked animu or whatever. Finn kept that and added football and weight lifting, deleting video games.<br />
<br />
Finn did some fiddling with the stats. Then he looked over his background. Impoverished. Not good, let’s change his parent’s jobs and income. He tapped a few buttons. Then he saw his ride. Ancient junker. How lame was that car? Nope, gotta change that.<br />
<br />
And now for the grand finale. What to turn him into? His dad said something about bears. But, if he made him a grizzly or something, that would make Jeff interested in him. Burly guys really got that kitty off. Maybe some eye candy for his dad? Yeah, and make sure Todd would be attracted to him and <i>not</i> his boyfriend. Now he was left with the choice of bear.<br />
<br />
The drop down button landed on Panda.<br />
<br />
Finn smiled. <I>Perfection.</I> They were Asian, just like those…cartoon thingies he liked. Animu was from Japan…were pandas from Japan? Eh, close enough.<br />
<br />
He played around a bit more with the vehicle and the house. Finn heard the shower shut off. Time to finish things up. He hit <b>[Activate]</B>, forgetting that he’d left reality alteration set to on. A loading bar appeared. Finn quickly went back to the screen that Jeff had left it on. <br />
<br />
Finn sat back and cracked his knuckles, satisfied he’d done a good deed. <br />
<br />
<B>[Finalizing changes]</B> blinked on the screen.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Todd stood under the shower, muscles feeling sore.<br />
<br />
He soaped up and rubbed himself down. Every muscle group felt oddly swollen to the touch. The nerd ran his hands over his belly and found less of it than normal. Was all the stress finally helping him lose weight? He massaged his pendulous moobs, not noticing them tighten and retract into his chest before plumping up into a pair of pillowy pecs.<br />
<br />
Todd finished washing and stepped out of the shower, calves and thighs swelling. The floppy remnants of his belly and his loose skin retracted and tightened into his hardening torso. His abdominals flexed and a set of cobblestone abs rose from the now-skinny nerd’s stomach. Todd moaned, feeling much lighter now.<br />
<br />
He toweled off, feeling itchy. Unbeknownst to him, black and white hairs were growing in all over his body. Muscles swelled and thickened across his form, even muscle groups he&#39;d never even known the names of. Todd felt tense and stretched, spine popping as he grew taller, shoulder crunching and giving their own little pops as they widened, his chest heaving forward and deepening, shoulders rounding. Soon, he stood a decent 6’2”, muscles incredibly well-defined, giving him a perfect, triangular upper body shape. <br />
<br />
Todd put on his clothes, starting with his underwear, which shifted and transformed into a pink jockstrap. It hung loosely around his waist for a brief moment. Then Todd gave a deep grunt as his package began to swell, filling the jockstrap almost to overflowing, his thick ebony shaft and enormous balls in clear view.<br />
<br />
Fur continued to spread across his form. Pubic fur tickled across his thick nut-sack and down into his taint. The soon-to-be panda squirmed, the fur spreading down his legs. His ass clenched and swelled into a tight, perfectly rounded ass.<br />
<br />
“Damn, I think I have jock itch.” Todd grunted, voice deepening with each word that left his mouth until he was a basso baritone. He adjusted his pink jock strap as his crotch plumped a bit more.<br />
<br />
He pulled on his shirt, which was no longer baggy. It shifted into an expensive pink Polo. His jeans came on next, dyed white and definitely designer. The entire house was shifting, the bathroom becoming his private bathroom, as it grew larger and much more expensive. Soon, he was looking at himself in a long mirror. There were two separate sinks set into a marble countertop. Charlie&#39;s things were arrayed around the other sink.<br />
<br />
Todd looked up at himself just in time for the fur to spread across his head. His hair thickened and receded into the fur. Black patches of fur circled his eyes and his lips turned black. There was a crunch and his face pressed out painlessly into a short, blunt muzzle. His jaw and gums grew sore, so he ran his tongue around hi mouth, feeling his teeth grow longer and sharper. There was something off about that, but he couldn&#39;t place what. As his tongue lapped around his mouth, his nose blackened and grew animalistic, picking up scents he&#39;d never noticed before.<br />
<br />
He stared at the handsome panda in the mirror, hand running over his sculpted abs, flexing his arms, muscles in his shoulders bulging, then bounced his thick, meaty pecs. His cock twitched in his jock as he turned and slapped his thickly muscled bubble-butt, watching it wobble. As though it were an after thought, his spine popped one more time and a nubby tail extended from the base of his spine, wiggling cutely. <br />
<br />
Todd grinned. Yeah, he was one hot piece of meat. Maybe after he met with his fellow football players, he’d find an older guy to fuck him right.<br />
<br />
The panda paused, wondering where that thought had come from. He wasn&#39;t into older guys. He liked twinks..right? The Yaoi posters in his room shifted to bara as he contemplated his sexual interests. Who&#39;d want to fuck a twink? If he wanted to fuck a girl, he&#39;d fuck a girl. No, he wanted a real man to take his ass and-<br />
<br />
Todd shook his head. The sexy tiger quarterback, Jeff, had called and wanted to speak with him and he needed to look his best. He sprayed some expensive, personally-formulated cologne on his wrists and neck, pulled on his Rolex, tossed his phone in its holster and left the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Charlie glanced over at him as he exited the bathroom. How he&#39;s managed to pull his attention away from that silly videogame of his, Todd would never know. There was a brief look of confusion on Charlie&#39;s face, and then he smiled. <br />
<br />
“Lookin’ good, Todd. You goin’ out?” The young black nerd called.<br />
<br />
Todd paused. “Wanna come?”<br />
<br />
“Nah, man. I’m cool.” Charlie waved him away and went back to playing his nerdy video game.<br />
<br />
It was his loss. Jeff was a major social connection and Charlie was just throwing his chances at becoming popular away. The panda shrugged and swaggered to his white BMW M3 and turned it on. It started remotely, the undercarriage lighting up. Todd set the color shift to blue lighting tonight and got in. He set the GPS of Jeff’s house in and was surprised to find he already had it preset. The panda was perplexed, because he was pretty sure he’d never been there before.<br />
<br />
15 minutes later, he pulled up to Jeff’s house and parked. Todd parked and got out, walking up to the door through the little stone path and up the short stairs. He knocked.<br />
<br />
A couple seconds later, he heard heavy steps and the door opened. A huge, muscular, middle-aged tiger stood in the doorway. He was handsome and there was no doubt in Todd&#39;s mind that he was Jeff&#39;s father.<br />
<br />
“Can I help you?” The older tiger leaned into the door and flexed, fur bunching up around his tremendous bicep. <br />
<br />
“I’m Todd.” The muscular panda growled. “Jeff home?”<br />
<br />
“Todd…” Jeff’s dad said slowly, eyeing up the muscular panda, gaze lingering on the obscene bulge in his jeans. “…the nerdy…prude…”<br />
<br />
“Excuse me?” Todd demanded.<br />
<br />
“Is he cute?” A handsome, older, overweight but stoutly built ram asked from behind Jeff’s dad.<br />
<br />
For some reason, Todd thought the ram was much more handsome than the tiger. Burly and thick in all the right places...The ram noticed Todd checking him out and winked at him.<br />
<br />
“Apparently, he’s a…non-traditional Bears fan.” The older tiger smirked and held out his hand. “Sorry for being rude, Todd. I’m Mike and that’s my….friend, Dave.”<br />
<br />
Todd shook it. Mark’s grip was firm and he met the man’s gaze straight on. Once upon a time, he might not have been able to do that. He stood awkwardly in the doorway, waiting for the tiger to move.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Mike held open the door and stepped aside. “Please, come in. He’s upstairs in the shower.”<br />
<br />
Todd stepped into Jeff&#39;s home, a feeling of deja vu washing over him, like he&#39;d been there before. The house smelled fresh, though Todd’s strangely sensitive nose picked up the smell of heavy barnyard and feline musk that lingered just beneath the surface. Mark went back into the kitchen. <br />
<br />
The heavy-set ram eagerly stepped forward and practically dragged Todd into the house.<br />
<br />
“My name’s Dave.” The older ram held out a meaty hand.<br />
<br />
Todd shook his hand and the ram reached around and pinched him on his muscular ass. The panda jumped, blushing. He eyed the handsome ram, cock hardening in spite of himself. He had to be Finn&#39;s dad, because the ram did the same thing for him that Finn did.<br />
<br />
&quot;You on the football team?&quot; Dave asked, pulling the panda closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, uh, tight end.&quot; The panda stammered, wondering why he was being so affected by the older man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s real tight.&quot; Dave smirked and ran his hand over the panda’s toned bubble-butt, watching Todd’s dick jump in his tight jeans.<br />
<br />
Todd&#39;s heart pounded in his chest and he found himself licking his lips. Why was this dude turning him on so much? Aside from the fact that he was mature and virile and <i>big</i>. The thicker, older man was basically his bara wet dream.<br />
<br />
&quot;You visiting with Jeff?&quot; The ram asked, squeezing Todd&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Todd panted, cock achingly hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;You smell good.&quot; The ram said, nostrils flaring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks. I, uh, think you smell good too.&quot; Todd nuzzled into the older ram&#39;s neck, scenting his musk. It made his cock hard as steel. A wet spot formed on the front of his jeans.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you got the hots for me bad, boy.&quot; Dave eyed the forming precum stain and lustfully licked his lips. &quot;Why hang out with them when you can hang out with me?” Dave rubbed Todd&#39;s toned ass and gave it another firm squeeze.<br />
<br />
Todd stood there, considering letting the big ram plow him. As he did, memories of playing tight end and spotting Dave in the crowd entered his mind. The ram had his shirt off, big belly shaking as he cheered, his fur painted in the team&#39;s colors. That image of the big ram cheering for him had filled up more than a few tissues. It was the first time he&#39;d ever lusted after an older man. The more he thought about it, the better the idea of staying here and finally fulfilling his fantasies sounded…<br />
<br />
Taking his silence as consent, Dave’s hooflets expertly unzipped Todd’s pants. Todd&#39;s thick ursine length sprang out. Dave began rubbing Todd&#39;s foot-long ebony shaft with his surprisingly dexterous hands, drawing a moan from Todd. <i>God, it was finally happening!</i> <br />
<br />
The muscular panda found himself leaning down to kiss the older ram-<br />
<br />
“Dave!” Mike yelled, walking back into the living room. “Behave!”<br />
<br />
“He’s perfect!” Dave pulled away from Todd and hissed. “How can I not?”<br />
<br />
<i>He thinks I&#39;m perfect!</i> Todd thought, a thrill shooting through him.<br />
<br />
“No seducing Jeff’s friends!”<br />
<br />
“I’m fine with it, sir.” Todd said, though he quickly stuffed his engorged cock back in his pants. <br />
<br />
&quot;See? He likes me!&quot; Dave bleated happily.<br />
<br />
“Lucky you.” Mike rolled his eyes. “Get upstairs, Todd, or he’ll end up taking you home with him.”<br />
<br />
Todd didn’t think that would be such a bad thing at all, but he had a job to do. When the quarterback asks for a meeting, you met with the quarterback. So Todd swallowed back his lust and nodded. As he turned to leave, he paused. There was no way he was leaving this encounter empty-handed. Todd turned and held out his phone to Dave.<br />
<br />
“C-can I get your number?” Todd stammered.<br />
<br />
“Hell yeah!” Dave’s muzzle broke into a goofy grin and he punched in his number. “Here!”<br />
<br />
Todd shyly smiled at the burly ram and clipped his phone back on his belt. He hurried away from the horny older ram before he got too horny, going up the stairs. Todd heard Dave wolf whistle and blushed deeper, knowing his jeans were so tight he could probably see his ass flexing with each step. It made him feel...proud.<br />
<br />
The panda found his way to Jeff’s room, not quite knowing how he knew where it was. Todd hadn’t been over to his house before, after all. But he had the strangest feeling that he <I>had</I> been here…a lot. His feet found their way to Jeff’s door on autopilot. Todd knocked on the door.<br />
<br />
“Come in!” Came a voice from within.<br />
<br />
Todd opened the door and walked in.</p>
