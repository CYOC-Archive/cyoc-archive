<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Craig decided to follow the boy. It was clear that he was headed towards the most isolated place in the school. &quot;He's probably going to get stoned, I bet&quot; Craig figured.<br />
<br />
He made sure to keep some distance between them to make sure Samuel didn't notice that someone was following him. <br />
<br />
It turned out Craig was right, Samuel just went to the the old buildings near the back gate, that no one used for years. Those buildings were still school property, although they were much too damaged to have anyone have classes there. They were scheduled to be repaired but no one saw the need to waste money on some useless buildings. So they just remained there, giving some privacy to those who sought it, even if it was strongly discouraged by the headmaster.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I going to say to him? I barely know the guy! And why would he know anything about some other guy? I mean I've never really seen him hanging around with others here in school.&quot; Still he continued walking towards Samuel, though a little less confident than before. <br />
<br />
He couldn't quite put his finger on it but somehow he felt that he needed to talk to the boy. A part of him was anxious and curious. As a result his heart was beating faster and his respiratory rate increased.<br />
<br />
Craig was now some feet away from Samuel. He just stared at the other boy as he searched for something in his bag, sitting against an old wall and completely oblivious to Craig's presence. Craig himself couldn't say or do anything at all as he just remained there, looking at the other boy but then he noticed the ginger teen had finally found what he was searching for and closed his bag.<br />
<br />
He had a joint on his hand. Craig just looked in awe. He knew what he was searching for, he knew that just by staying there with that other boy he could get into trouble but somehow, despite himself, he didn't care. He had only eyes for what his classmate was holding.<br />
<br />
Samuel still hadn't noticed him and just took a lighter from his pocket. As he was about to light his joint he suddenly looked at Craig and instantly panicked, dropping the joint on the floor and clumsily getting up, taking some steps away from Craig, ready to run away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I'm not gonna tell anyone!&quot; Craig said. He too was shocked and for a second he didn't know what the heck was he doing there and why he was so fixated on what the other boy was about to do.<br />
<br />
Samuel stopped, taking a second to regain his composure. Craig looked at him. He was probably the only person at school who was paler than Craig. Indeed he was taller than him as well and had some freckles under his eyes. His hair needed a cut and the few red hairs above his lips and on his chin certainly needed a shave, being the only facial hair he could grow. &quot;Fuck man, you scared the shit outta me.&quot; He said, sounding actually relieved. &quot;You're that guy from class, Craig, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it's me. I just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Geez, man. Don't ever scare me like that again! Almost gave me a heart attack.&quot; He interrupted and sighed. Then he walked back and crouched down to pick up his joint, which now had a brown stain from the wet soil. &quot;Fuck, and you even managed to wreck my shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Samuel, I didn't mean..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, seriously? Nobody ever calls me Samuel, it's just Sam, dude.&quot; Sam had cut Craig off, again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're too damn apologetic for your own good, dude, just chill out a bit.&quot; Sam just had that outgoing attitude that made Craig feel more at ease with all this. Sam did sound like a cool guy. Craig regretted not having talked to him sooner. He couldn't be that bad, right? Of course, despite having such an inconvenient habit. &quot;So, let me guess: you wanna buy some weed, right? I don't know who told you to see me but I don't sell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No, it.. it's nothing like that!&quot; Craig stuttered. Sam noticed that the newcomer had his eyes on his now dirty joint but then the dark haired teenager shook his head and looked into his hazel eyes and continued. &quot;I'm looking for someone, his name is Cody Rayne.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cody Rayne?&quot; Sam looked up and put a hand on his chin scratching the short hairs there. &quot;Nope, doesn't ring a bell. Why, you were looking for him here to make out?&quot;~<br />
<br />
Craig was left speechless for a second but then he answered with his nervous stutter. &quot;N...no. It's nothing like that at all!&quot; He sounded a bit more whiny than he intended.<br />
<br />
Sam could only laugh at Craig. &quot;Shit man, you really need to relax a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta go.&quot; Answered Craig, unsure what to make of all of this and he turned around about to go back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait man, geez sorry if I offended you!&quot; Came a voice behind Craig. He quickly tapped Craig on the shoulder as he put himself right beside him. &quot;I don't know any Cody Rayne, believe me dude but why are you asking me about him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I...&quot; Craig wasn't really sure how to begin explaining all this mess to Sam. Still he noticed the smell coming from Sam. &quot;It smells kinda good, come to think of it.&quot; He found himself thinking. &quot;I wonder how it's like smoking that.&quot; He shook his head again. &quot;It's a long story, dude&quot; &quot;Wait, did I just say dude?&quot; He thought. It was like his own words were getting a mind of their own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, suit yourself but you're gonna have to tell me eventually!&quot; Sam said with a smile, not noticing his classmate's confused face, still wondering about what had just happened.<br />
<br />
Ignoring Sam's words, Craig just went on, ignoring the ginger boy who just stood there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Craig! Wait up! Where are you going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To class. We'll arrive late.&quot; Craig said, still not quite himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're shitting me! We still have like ten minutes! You really wanna go now?&quot;</p>
