<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan's thin frame was pumped full of both David's cum and the Contagion.  Ryan was face down on the ground, <br />
breathing heavily, attempting to recover from his recent rape experience.  After a long while, Ryan's limbs <br />
began to move.  He slowly pushed himself up, struggling as his limbs shook and shivered.  Ryan was so <br />
dramatized that he didn't realize that he was still naked.  He wandered around the gym locker room, stumbling <br />
up against walls and lockers.  He moved extremely slowly and clumsily.  His mind was clouded as the Contagion <br />
began to change him.  However, for Ryan, it wouldn't be a physical change, but a mental one.  Ryan's mind <br />
altered as the Contagion began to fill it.  The large doses of cum in Ryan's body caused his mind to develop <br />
an insatiable need to cleanse itself of the foreign fluids.  His mind began to move beyond desire and need <br />
into paramount requirement.  It was such a strong motivation that his mind began to develop strange new <br />
powers.<br />
<br />
At the nearest door, Ryan heard a door open and close.  He could hear shoes moving across the gym quickly.  A <br />
locker opened.  His mind raced and drove him to move toward the new individual in the room.  Ryan peered <br />
around the corner, pressing his naked body against the cold lockers.  He saw another young, lean boy.  The <br />
tall Asian boy was shoving his belongings in the locker hurriedly.  The likelihood was that he was already <br />
late for his P.E. class.  Ryan turned the corner and approached the boy, his mind tingling with excitement.  <br />
The tall, skinny Asian boy turned and saw Ryan's naked body.  His hand quickly flew up, covering his view of <br />
Ryan's private parts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude!  Cover your junk!&quot;  Ryan then realized he knew the boy.  Quinton.  That was his name.  He was a popular <br />
kid in school and greatly liked by everyone.  In fact, he was the object of desire for a number of girls all <br />
over campus.  Ryan's mind compelled him to move forward.  In a swift movement, Ryan cornered Quinton against <br />
the lockers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, Ryan!  What's wrong with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know...I just need... to...&quot;  Ryan was too confused as the Contagion continued to change his mind.  <br />
Ryan's mind activated its latent abilities.  Ryan gently placed his hand on Quinton's chest.  Immediately, <br />
Ryan's mind utilize the contact to disintegrate Quinton's clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck!&quot;  Quinton was trapped up against the lockers.  The longer Ryan's hands were on Quinton, the <br />
more of his clothes disintegrated.  His shirt vanished as his shorts began to evaporate.  Quinton attempted to <br />
stop the loss of his clothes.  He grabbed Ryan's arm, pulling it away from his own body.  However, the extra <br />
contact caused his clothes to burn even faster.  In a matter of seconds, Quinton's boxers had turned to smoke <br />
and vanished.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I need to... release... it...&quot;  Quinton's eyes were filled with fear as his friend continued to keep him <br />
pinned.  Quinton attempted to escape but Ryan had cornered him too tightly.  Ryan reached down and placed his <br />
hand on Quinton's balls.  A strange tingle shot through Quinton's body.  He kept repeating to himself, &quot;I'm <br />
straight... I'm straight... I'm straight...&quot; Quinton closed his eyes and tried to focus on the one line.  Ryan <br />
continued to massage Quinton's balls, which had quite a noticeable effect on his dick.  Quinton's dick began <br />
to harden, rising to a boner of 5 and a half inches.  Ryan's on dick grew larger and pressed against Quinton's <br />
own cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like this, don't you?&quot;  Ryan couldn't help but smile.  His mind released chemicals and completely took <br />
over his body.  Ryan quickly shoved his body up against Quinton's body, sandwiching him up against the <br />
lockers.  Ryan's maneuvered his dick under Quinton's balls and up into his ass.  Quinton let out a slight gasp <br />
as he was penetrated by Ryan's cock.  At first Ryan slowly entered Quinton, but as soon as his head was <br />
cleared, he began to violently thrust.  Quinton's eyes flew wide open with pain and fear, but his mind began <br />
to accept it... and even enjoy it.  Quinton grabbed onto Ryan's back, moaning and screaming.  His dick began <br />
to throb and scream for attention.  Ryan quickly and easily unloaded a dose of the Contagion into Quinton's <br />
body.  Quinton let out a yelp as he felt the hot cum fill his insides.  His own member continued to cry for <br />
attention.<br />
<br />
Ryan slowly pulled out of Quinton and lowered him onto a bench.  Ryan's chest heaved as his gasps filled his <br />
lungs with air.  The need to continue to release cum from his body was still present and still demanding more.    <br />
However, there was a short respite, allowing him to talk to Quinton.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's too much cum in me... I..I..I need to get it out.  Can you help me?&quot;  Quinton stared up at him, his <br />
own member screaming for attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.  I'm all spent, but I'm sure we can find some other guys.&quot;  Quinton smiled at his friend and began <br />
to finally accept his love of other boys.  It was then that the Contagion began to affect him...</p>
