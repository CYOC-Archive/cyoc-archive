<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hillary ran to her room; she knew Andrew wasn’t home today, he had two classes. She reached under her bed and found the hidden pink dildo - it was bigger than it had been, around 10 inches and girthier than before. Next to it was something Hillary hadn’t seen before. As she touched it, an electric shock went through her - instructions filled her brain. Now, suddenly, she knew what a vibrating buttplug was and exactly how to use it.<br />
<br />
Despite never having used one before, her asshole was aching for it. It was a very small one, so it easily fit. She shoved the buttplug deep inside her and turned the setting to “max,” moaning and shouting as she had her first orgasm of the day simply from anal play. Her mind was filled with the hot bimbo she’d seen today; something deep inside her told her that the porn wasn’t necessary today, that she could cum just from that bimbo.<br />
<br />
Hillary licked her now larger dildo up and down, just as she’d done yesterday, and prepared her sopping wet pussy for it. It slid in easily, and unlike yesterday, Hillary was able to take the whole thing, her mind filled with the idea that it was a strap on and another lesbian was fucking her. <br />
<br />
Quickly she orgasmed for a second time, but it wasn’t nearly enough. Hillary kept going, pumping the dildo in and out, cumming again, but still no relief. She repeated this process over and over again to no avail; however, the more she orgasmed, the more of a trance she felt herself in.<br />
<br />
Hillary’s mine was filled with porn and that hot blonde she’d seen today. On top of that, she couldn’t stop imagining the cute girl she’d seen with big fake tits, ass implants, lip fillers - and worshipping Hillary’s pussy. The more she came, the more vivid the images became.<br />
<br />
“But… but what if they reject me? What if they’re not lesbians?” The last conscious vestiges of Hillary’s  were arguing with her new libido, but the libido was quickly winning. That voice, those comforting thoughts, suddenly came back.<br />
<br />
*You can make them. You can change them like you’ve been changed. Sex will feel like a thousand masturbations. They’ll all love you. Just give them a kiss.*<br />
<br />
As this thought went into her brain, Hillary had a body shaking orgasm, stronger than the others. However, she still couldn’t stop pumping the dildo into herself, thinking of that hot bimbo slut riding her face.<br />
<br />
Hillary finally orgasmed for the 11th time, beating her own record once again. Her vision turned white, and she passed out, leaving the vibrating buttplug inside of her. As she slept with a smile on her face, more changes happened.<br />
<br />
Her buttplug and dildo grew, the dildo gaining another two inches and the buttplug becoming more snug inside of her asshole. Her ass implants grew, making her ass look larger and rounder - and much more clearly fake. Now, there was no doubt she’d had cosmetic surgery to her rear.<br />
<br />
Next, while her natural breast tissue stayed the same, her implants grew again, this time giving her the equivalent of 2 more cup sizes. Her tits stood proudly on her chest, obviously fake but still symmetrical, her nipples still sitting in their natural direction. <br />
<br />
Her hair became thicker and became lighter once again. Not quite the platinum blonde as the bimbo in the store, but a nice honey blonde as opposed to the dirty blonde she had before. It grew a bit more, reaching her enhanced ass.<br />
<br />
That last bit of pudge finally disappeared from her stomach, leaving her a nice, slim stomach. She didn’t have visible abs but she definitely looked like she took care of herself more.<br />
<br />
Most of her remaining body hair receded, leaving just a bit of blonde pubic hair. Her lips puffed up a bit more, looking like she’d had another set of fresh lip injections. Only a few wrinkles remained, the porn addict now looking a bit younger but a lot more artificial. She had quite a bit more makeup on. And then, another, stranger change happened. She no longer needed to use the bathroom or eat, she simply had to orgasm and recharge with water (or her now beloved iced coffee.) Her natural scent changed, becoming pheromones that worked only on women, a wonderful rose scented smell that was stronger than she could know.<br />
<br />
As her changes finished and she slept, Hillary’s mind was filled with sex, and she restlessly tossed the sheets around, her buttplug pleasuring her even more. Her dreams were filled with that sexy blonde woman and a far more plastic version of the other girl in the clothing store. The blonde had even bigger tits, even bigger lips, even thicker hair, and when Hillary was fucking both of them, she suddenly saw herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
She was very different. Extremely different. At first, she didn’t register it as her. It was… a goddess. A perfect blonde porn star. Shining, platinum blonde hair. A muscular torso. Fit arms and legs. A huge, fake ass, with a matching rack to go with it. A pair of lips so thick that you couldn’t even pretend that they were natural. Some of the heaviest makeup she’d ever seen. “The real me.” Hillary thought.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, her eyes shot open. She couldn’t remember her dream at all, but she knew she felt good. She was a bit groggy, trying to figure out what was going on. She pulled out her buttplug and was a bit surprised she didn’t have to use the bathroom as she usually did in the morning. She wasn’t hungry, either, just thirsty. She licked her lips, finding them puffy and not dry at all.<br />
<br />
She got up and walked into her bathroom. To her surprise, it lacked a toilet, replaced with a huge soaking tub. However, Hillary wasn’t stressed about it. Why should she worry? Her life was getting better by the second!<br />
<br />
She looked around the rest of the bathroom. It was a bit gaudier, a bit more grandiose. Marble on the floors. A huge shower. A vanity with gold fixtures and expensive looking lights. She flicked one of the lights on and looked at herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Wow, I look. Hot.” She said, licking her lips. She was done being afraid or trying to reject these changes. Why not embrace them?<br />
<br />
She walked back to her room and found something to put on; her sweatsuit from yesterday was slightly different, now a rose pink color instead of gray. However, she found that it was clean, as if someone had done all her laundry over night. She threw on some new, perfectly fitting lingerie, something the old Hillary never would’ve worn, and put the sweatsuit on. Unlike before, she didn’t zip the top up all the way, letting her “girls” breathe a little bit. She formulated a plan in her head; she go to her coffee shop and then right back to the clothing store.</p>
