<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff had nearly no idea what to expect or how to get someone to have sex with him. Ideas of courtship were shown in rom-cons and Disney movies, but he wasn&#39;t even allowed to see rated R movies yet, back in his former life... &#39;Well, this&#39;ll show the old man, I&#39;ll do what I have to and become 16 again, then he&#39;ll see what I really want is to go home and live my life.&#39; he thought.<br />
<br />
Jeff shut the car door approaching the bar apprehensively, yet another new experience previously denied to him. Unlike with the tobacco store Jeff didn&#39;t have any compulsion or memory driving him. He pulled open the door, entering and looked around , immediately feeling stares as people turned to see who entered the small bar/pizzaria at 2 in the afternoon. Jeff saw a small hallway in the tiny one room establishment and bolted for the restroom.<br />
<br />
Giving himself a quick examination he saw that he looked like a slightly taller and older version of himself. Still lanky, he was never in sports, a mop of brown hair on his head. Same eyes, nose, ears he was used to, his facial hair had started to come in between 16 and whatever he was now... he was... himself, just older.<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled out his wallet finding several hundred dollars in cash and an ID confirming he was 21 and of legal drinking age. A strong twinge of excitement ran through him. He could... no, no, no... he&#39;s eager to get back to 16 and will show the man he should be released by beating him at his perverted game... <br />
<br />
Jeff folded his wallet up, and his final examination was in his pants, his normal, average sized cock stared back at him, any hopes it would become porn star quality in the last years of puberty were now gone.. &#39;Eh&#39; it wasn&#39;t the end of the world, certainly not bad.<br />
<br />
Jeff returned to the bar area feeling stares from 3-4 guys ranging from their late 30&#39;s to retired. The bartender, a woman closer to 50 or 60, greeted him warmly, &quot;what&#39;ll you have?&quot; &quot;A menu please.&quot; and one was handed to him almost immediately, &quot;sit where ever you would like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sat down at one of the 6 small tables jammed in the tiny space, eventually ordering a chicken parmesan sandwich with fries and although he fought himself over it, he ordered his first beer reasoning that once this is done it will be another 5 years till he can do it again. He was asked for, and excitedly showed his ID, and then he waited.<br />
<br />
Waiting for his food, Jeff&#39;s eyes wandered over the crowd, as he did he somehow knew the obese white haired man had some kind of shit fetish but was strictly into women, the short and small old man really liked young girls and anime hitting it big really improved his alone time, the 35-40 year old was into having multiple girlfriends at once, and the middle aged guy with growing patches of gray/white hair really just needed a hole, that last guy stood up and dropped money on the counter saying bye to everyone.<br />
<br />
Before Jeff realized what was happening, he had followed the guy outside and was offering him a blowjob. &quot;I&#39;m not gay.&quot; the man dismissed. &quot;Neither am I, and I didn&#39;t say you were. But you want to facefuck me and I&#39;m willing to let that happen for my own reasons, which have nothing to do with you. 5 minutes, tops.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man paused, Jeff started walking behind the building and the man followed. Jeff fell to his knees unable to stop himself. This was Jeff&#39;s first sexual encounter, but he knew exactly what to do to finish the guy off quickly, Soon the man was really into it and was violently using Jeff&#39;s skull like it was an object. Jeff felt degraded, emasculated, used.<br />
<br />
The pair worked together silently, barely making any noise until the man came letting out a low growl, Jeff immediately swallowed knowing that was what the man wanted him to do. Jeff stood and the man zipped up his pants, &quot;Return the favor?&quot; Jeff asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Fuck you faggot.&quot; the man grunted as he turned and walk away. <br />
<br />
Jeff was immediately enraged, jealous and bitter. &quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m asking, Asshole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to hell,&quot; he called without turning around.<br />
<br />
Jeff was left feeling grossed out, he wasn&#39;t expecting the old bear of a man to cause this to happen, since he was straight and had assumed the old man to be as well. Though, it could just be an honest mistake of the bear not specifying gender but facilitating action being taken...<br />
<br />
Still, Jeff was sure that the guy he just sucked off would have returned the favor if Jeff was tougher and didn&#39;t look less than half his age. The man got into an oversized white truck and as he backed up Jeff noticed his truck nuts.<br />
<br />
Jeff imagined that he felt the man&#39;s semen in his stomach and was momentarily nauseated as he headed back into the bar, Jeff was nervous people would somehow know what he did, wishing he fit in a bit better not realizing he was rapidly aging to 23 and gaining 30 lbs of muscle as he grew two inches taller.<br />
<br />
Jeff drank his beer and ordered another, not realizing he would have hated the taste only moments ago. A few people got up to have a smoke outside and Jeff averted his gaze, not wanting another &quot;situation&quot; and simultaneously was pleased to be free of the old man&#39;s nicotine addiction, though he was torn because in a way it did make him feel good. Jeff noticed a motorcycle pull up and thought it looked really cool. The guy had a matching helmet and motorcycle gear, being in a small town with a fair bit of distance between places, it would make sense that the guy could easily get up to 60+ mph and being geared up is necessary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gear up&quot; the words echoed in Jeff&#39;s brain. How&#39;s he going to get out of this? Well he should be younger now, right? He had that unpleasant one sided experience with that guy and should be, what, 20, 19? He decided he wanted to get back to 16 but maybe 18 is as far as he can risk going cause kids are fucking jailbait. <br />
<br />
Jeff blinked, that thought seemed unlike him. He pulled out his wallet and looked at his ID. The image seemed a tiny bit different but Jeff couldn&#39;t quite place how. It did still have the sideways printing indicating he was 21 which jeff didn&#39;t expect. Jeff headed back to the bathroom to find that rather than looking younger he looked bigger, and quite a bit tougher. His shirt was now a t-shirt of a local well and septic business, he looked like a young laborer taking the day off, spending his paycheck in the bar. He was average but looked athletic because he was so lean his muscles had no choice but to show. He fit in here, at least a whole lot better than before. Looking at his ID again he slowly did the math several times in his head realizing he was 23 instead of younger. &quot;Shit shit shit shit shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Collecting himself he went back to his meal. &quot;Will that be all Jeff?&quot; Susan asked.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked up, there was nothing in her face but kindly politeness but he knew, she&#39;d let him fuck her. Now that he has a job, is apparently a regular, is strong and a little older... &quot;Yeah, but Susan, I wanted to offer.&quot; &quot;Yes?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m wanting to get down and dirty, if you&#39;re willing, we can make it happen after your shift change.&quot; &quot;But...&quot; &quot;The offer stands, yes or no?&quot;<br />
<br />
She was flustered. But willing. She glanced at the clock, &quot;I&#39;m off in 30.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ill follow you home.&quot; Jeff dropped $50 on the table and pressed it forward to cover his meal and tip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? You are such a doll!&quot; she said loudly. &quot;Hey guys, Jeff is going to troubleshoot why my pipes sometimes make my house smell awful.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff smiled, &quot;I&#39;ll just be waiting for you to get off work.&quot; realizing that as a septic specialist he had a legitimate reason to go into people&#39;s houses and she just used it as a cover story to not make it weird that he was waiting for her.<br />
<br />
A couple in their late 20&#39;s early 30&#39;s was sitting on the patio furniture smoking. Jeff glanced them both over, she would fuck but is loyal to this guy, the guy would let Jeff in his ass but is in front of his girlfriend right now. &quot;Hey Jimmy, hey Rachel.&quot; he called not realizing he now knew their names.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh heya Jeff, whachu upto?&quot; Jimmy asked <br />
<br />
&quot;Just headed to Sue&#39;s to check on her septic. Says its backing up in the pipes and making the house smell or something. Waiting for her to get of so she can take me over.&quot; Jeff tried not to, but he stared at the cigarettes recalling how this whole fiasco starting with becoming a tobacco pipe, somehow landing him here, and earlier this morning he was himself puffing on a pipe and then ripping through his own pack of cigarettes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, that&#39;s nice of you man.&quot; Jimmy noticed Jeff&#39;s distant stare, &quot;Were you looking to bum one?&quot; <br />
<br />
No? Yes? He wanted it, not because he was addicted like earlier today, but to prove that he wasn&#39;t. If he didn&#39;t like the taste, didn&#39;t like holding it, and didn&#39;t feel comfortable with it like second nature, it would prove he is truly free, truly choosing for yourself... &quot;Uh, Yeah, if you don&#39;t mind. I would like one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff lit up and returned his lighter, the taste was unfamiliar, bad even. Jeff took a heavy drag or two, ashing on the pavement and breathing a heavy sigh of relief. Jeff thanked him and walked over to the motorcycle, remembering the guy with the suit and feeling  a twinge of jealousy. Jeff thought back to when he was 16 and just about to get a license, he hoped to own a motorcycle, have a tattoo, make an entrance as he drove up to bars and clubs, have a girl gripping him tight as he whipped around corners. Just be bad ass. Wait, that was a week ago. Why did it feel so long ago?<br />
<br />
It dawned on Jeff that the reality change wasn&#39;t just for his ID card, and his memories of these people weren&#39;t the only ones altered. He remembered graduating high school, taking a year of college courses and failing out before switching to a trade school where he became a licensed and certified septic tank installer, outclassing half the fuckers he works with... Jeff smiled taking another puff of his cigarette.<br />
<br />
Right, he use to smoke, up until he was 22, somewhere between sucking that guy off and now, something turned him into an ex-err- only smokes when drinking- kinda guy. Jeff finished his cigarette thanking Jimmy again and walking back into the bar, going back to the tiny, one person restroom he looked himself over. No new changes, no tattoos, no motorcycle gear. &quot;I change after completing a sexual act,&quot; Jeff reasoned. Which fit with the &#39;Sow your wild oats&#39; thing the old guy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, just gotta focus on wanting to be 16 right after fucking Sue&#39;s brains out...&quot; Jeff looked in the mirror, being 16 sucked. He smelled bad, was scrawny, couldn&#39;t drink, couldn&#39;t smoke, couldn&#39;t earn money and spend it how he wanted, and when he could earn money it was saved up for school and he was barely able to scrape by till he got this job... This version of himself didn&#39;t want to go back. &quot;Fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff exited the bar with Susan calling after him, &quot;Just about 10 more minutes,&quot; Jeff smiled and waved warmly compelled to follow through on making this happen. New memories of girlfriends cropping up in the recesses of his memory... &quot;Couldn&#39;t fuck... No.&quot; Jeff needed to find a way to make this right, and judging by the small town he was in, he had about 15 to 20 minutes till he was plowing the old barmaid and liable to change with stray thoughts... &quot;Gotta plan, what&#39;s good about being 16? Need to have an arsenal ready for when I come.&quot;</p>
