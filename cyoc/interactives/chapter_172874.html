<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the car drove down the highway, the house miles behind them now, Jeff sat in his seat staring out the window. It had been around twenty minutes since they had left for the national park. And in that time, Jeff’s body was beginning to react to the trilogy of drinks he had consumed at breakfast. It was slight and it was tolerable, but a pressure was definitely starting to build in his bladder. Trying not to focus on it, Jeff instead tried to occupy his mind by counting cars or memorizing license plates.<br />
<br />
After another fifteen minutes, Jeff’s need to answer the call had increased slightly, but noticeably. Biting his lower lip and tapping his foot, he watched as a sign for a rest stop came and went on the side of the road. Sensing a repeat of the incident at the party, he spoke up.<br />
<br />
“Hey, mom? Can we stop at a rest area?”<br />
<br />
“Jeffrey, it’s been less than an hour. I told you to go back at the house, and you had ages to go. If you didn’t get it all out, well, then that’s your own fault. We can’t stop now or we’ll never make it on time. Just hold it.”<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed, cursing mentally. It wasn’t his fault that he had to manufacture a new holster for the crotch-breast. Or was it? Maybe if he hadn’t left the old one back at the pool shed… no, now wasn’t the time to think like that. He needed to just breathe and remain calm. They would be at the park in no time, and they were sure to have restrooms there.<br />
<br />
Another twelve minutes passed, and the breast was beginning to feel physically heavier. Jeff grit his teeth, lamenting the fact that the car’s Josh’s baby music playlist was now singing The Itsy Bitsy Spider, talking about how “down came the rain”. He glanced at the dashboard and caught a glimpse of the GPS: “57.4 miles left to go, 52 minutes to arrival.” Jeff whimpered softly, and sunk back into his seat.<br />
<br />
Fifteen minutes more. Jeff was all but bouncing in his seat, on the verge of whining. Passing trucks advertising beverages and billboards promoting water parks taunted him as the car sped along down the highway. Jeff, now wanting the relief, spoke up again.<br />
<br />
“Mom, please. I really need to go. Please, stop.”<br />
<br />
With an annoyed sigh and some hushed whispering between her and her husband, Jeff’s mother turned her head around to reply to his request. “Okay. Fine. We’ll pull over here. But only because we’re making such good time. You have two minutes; we aren’t doing this again.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded profusely, thanking his mother over and over. After turning on the indicator, Jeff’s father slowed the car to a stop on the side of the road, near a moderate grassy ravine. Jeff undid his seatbelt, throwing open the door and running out like a pet dog being brought to a fire hydrant. However, it was all too soon that he realized an issue.<br />
<br />
Cars, multiple cars, sped by the time and time again on the highway. Jeff’s parents sat in the car, shifting their attention between looking at him and glancing at the clock. What’s more, in his urine-riddled haste, Jeff had overlooked his present situation. If he wanted to pee, here, he’d need to dig the breast out of his pants, and milk it forcibly onto the green grass under his feet. Even if everyone in the world stopped looking at him for a full thirty seconds, that wouldn’t have been enough time for him to complete the act. If he just had his penis, this would be over by now, either with the business getting taken care of back at home or right here.<br />
<br />
Jeff groaned, the feeling of eyes peering him. If only he had his dick, if only he had his dick. This thought kept pounding in his mind, unable to be shut out no matter how hard Jeff tried. Just as he was ready to soil himself just to get it over with, he heard the car honk. There was no way that had been three minutes! Why-?<br />
<br />
Jeff’s father’s voice rung in his ears, signaling his one-sided ultimatum of the hour. “Jeff! For the love of God, either go or don’t. Finish it up or get in the car.”<br />
<br />
Knowing there was no use prolonging the issue, and reminding himself there would be restrooms at the national park, Jeff tucked his tail between his legs (along with the other foreign body part situated betwixt them) and reentered the car.<br />
<br />
Fourteen more minutes passed, and Jeff was now bouncing in his seat, like Josh if he was cranky. He looked ridiculous, was getting annoyed looks from his parents, and Jack kept snickering under his breath. Jeff would have screamed if he wasn’t in so much need of draining.<br />
<br />
“Jeff. Stop. You’re acting like a child. You had your chances, and you blew them. Now you have to face the consequences and wait.”<br />
<br />
Those words stung Jeff, piercing through him and making the increasing unpleasantness exponentially worse. “You had your chances, and you blew them. Now you have to face the consequences and wait.” He couldn’t even feel mad at his parents, there was too much truth to their words. He most certainly had had opportunities to remedy the blight that was his halfway-full bladder, and now because of his inability to act on them, he was stuck in a car with twenty-four minutes to go until sweet porcelain salvation came to his aid.<br />
<br />
Five more minutes later, Jeff had ceased bouncing in his seat, and was instead rocking his waist from side to side. It drew less attention and his parents didn’t seem nearly as annoyed by it, but that wasn’t the only reason. With the urine pooling inside his body, the breast a perfect carrying vessel for liquids, it had begun to swell, no different than what he had experienced at the party. It was gradual and not yet that bad, but the soft and spongey flesh was starting to press more against the sides of the bra cup, causing it to tighten. With the volume&#39;s bit-by-bit expansion, the cup was digging annoyingly into the skin and forcing the yellow hell inside further towards the nipple, creating a progressive and prolonged feeling of ‘gotta go’.<br />
<br />
Finally, after ten more minutes, Jeff could take it no longer. He didn’t care that the park was nine minutes away or that he had made it this far. The discomfort was too much. The way he figured, he had to do this for the sake of his own sanity. Even if it meant that his parents would be furious. Even if it meant Jack would never let him hear the end of it. Even if strangers saw his pants and laughed at him. It would all be worth it just to experience the nirvana that was sweet, delicious urination. With a soft inhale, Jeff relaxed himself, uncrossed his legs, thought of warm running water, and……<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
Jeff opened his eyes, staring down at the semi-noticeable bulge that he was carrying. He had relaxed his muscles, he had thought about the water, why wasn’t he peeing?!<br />
<br />
Then, a thought occurred to him. No. No, it couldn’t be. The same way, say, a cow could go for days without being milked, relying solely on an outside force to push the dairy out… did this mean Jeff HAD to milk the urine through the nipple? He couldn’t just unclench and let it flow like when he had a penis?<br />
<br />
As Jeff screamed internally once again, digging his fingers into his palms, the same words kept repeating in his head, taunting him.<br />
<br />
“This wouldn’t be happening if you just had your dick… This wouldn’t be happening if you just had your dick…”</p>
