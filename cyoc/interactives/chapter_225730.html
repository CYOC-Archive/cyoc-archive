<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So where shall we go to have our bit of fun,” Lucas Soulfang speaking shortly after his daughter left with her mate Jake, along with Jimmy and Allison. The dinner party was pleasant; the veal cannelloni and lava cake with a caramel mousse divine. The revelation that Brittany is choosing to hyphenate her last name was a novel ideal; but it did stir up a longing desire to have a son to carry on the new family name. Placing a hand paw on his mate Rachael, who was an anthro lioness furry; he smiled, knowing if she went into heat, he would be there to help quench the fire in her loins.<br />
<br />
“Our place,” Edward answering; “It’s fairly spacious and the basement rec room should accommodate us all.”<br />
“Just as long as that Karen who lives next to you doesn’t get nosy and starts spying on our fun,” Rachael stifling a growl; “the biddy you call a neighbor needs to mind her own business.”<br />
“Oh she moved last month,” Edward smiling as he sipped the coffee in front of him; “rumor was the bank repossessed the home or mental breakdown. Either way the house currently sits vacant,” Edward adding.<br />
“Is it wrong to not be happy about that,” Rachael asking as she is unable to suppress a smile. Remembering the fourth of July Barbeque and the woman’s repeated attempts to cut the party short by pretending to be an HOA rep, despite there not being a home owner’s associate in that part of town. When that failed she called the police only for her to be charged for misuse of emergency services after repeated calls.<br />
“The whole neighborhood was happy she left,” Julian sighing; “always butting in on issues she had no business being in. She once tried to demand the plums I was growing one year. Claiming they were a controlled substance,” Julian shaking her head; &quot;I&#39;m glad she is gone. Maybe now I’ll be able to some gardening without her interference.”<br />
“Then it’s settled,” Michael getting up along with Denise; an anthro stag-deer furry and an anthro tigress fury; “you lead and we’ll follow behind.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
At the Heartpaw residence, Edward grabbed a top hat he wore from the same 4th of July party. Looking at the garment, the anthro red fox furry blanched at the thought of wearing the object; infact he felt a wave of revulsion at wearing any form of clothing.<br />
“You’ll get one final use,” Edward gritting his vulpine canines as he enters the spacious basement rec room. “We’ll each place our names in the top hat,” Edward stating as Jullian passes strips of paper around with a pencil to write with.<br />
“And then what,” Rachael putting her name in the hat; followed by her mate Lucas, the Michael and Denise.<br />
“I mix up the strips,” Edward explaining as he and Jullian put their names into the hat; “then three of us draw names. If you pull yours, put it back and try again.”<br />
“I get it,” Lucas grinning; “this is a sex lottery. The name we pick is who we rut with first.”<br />
“Bingo,” Edward smiling; “so who will pull first?”<br />
<br />
“Me,” Denise stepping up; placing her furry hand paw into the hat she pulls out a paper. “Lucas Soulfang,” She shows while staring at the anthro wolf furry.<br />
“I’m good with that,” Lucas smiling; the anthro gray wolf furry eager to tug a tiger by the tail.<br />
“I’ll go next,” Michael pulling a name from the hat; he gives off a quizzical look as everyone stares at him “Looks like I’m crossing swords with you Edward,” the anthro stag-deer furry placing the paper to the side. “You want anal or oral,” Michael asking the anthro fox fury.<br />
“Surprise me,” Edward already feeling randy; his vulpine shaft already making an entrance from his sheath.<br />
“Guess that leaves me and Rachael,” Jullian smiling at the thought of giving Cunnilingus to the anthro lioness furry.<br />
<br />
***********<br />
<br />
The room soon began to stink of musk and feminine arousal as the adult furies were cavorting in bestial carnal acts of lust. The sounds of tongues lapping and probing vaginas, the grunting of Michael as he plows Edward’s anus, all the while Edward somehow manages to stroke himself along. Only Lucas and Denise looked like a normal couple as the wolf furry was behind the tigress fury and already balls deep into her feline snatch. Permission was granted earlier for the males to fill their respective partners, regardless of gender. With his lupine knot already locking the two together, it wasn’t long before he grunted with relief and filled the tigress up with his seed.<br />
“One down,” Denise smiling as she enjoyed how different Lucas’s shaft was to Michael’s cervine phallus; “I can’t wait for the next round.”<br />
“Me too,” Lucas enjoying his post orgasmic bliss; “but we’ll have to wait until my knot deflates.”<br />
“Let’s just watch the rest finish then,” Denise smiling; turning her head to see her mate’s large deer testicles swinging mad as he grinds Edward’s back entrance. It was clear to her that this was a new experience for the former widow in morning. The furry virus did more than break him out of his doldrums; it awakened a bisexual side of him that he was finding very enjoyable.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck,” Michael grunts as he feels his balls clench; shooting his load into the fox furry he has currently mounted.<br />
“Ooooh,” Edward feeling his rectum getting filled; “it’s like a colonoscopy but only more pleasurable.” He soon shudders as his shaft spasms and he blows his first load. Falling on his hand paws as Michael pulls out; he feels his anus leaking copious amounts of cum as he looks at his mate getting and giving oral with Rachael. Smiling as the cougar and lioness furies each moan and growl as they cum; spraying their fluids in each other’s muzzles as they pause their ministrations to enjoy the moment.<br />
“Do you have any juice or pop,” Michael sitting on the carpet; not minding the puddle of cum pooling from his still hard shaft pumping seed.<br />
“There should be some in the small fridge by the bar,” Edward enjoying the new sensation he just experienced. “There is also water and a few beers if you are inclined.”<br />
<br />
************<br />
<br />
Once everyone was down from their first orgasmic moment and sufficiently re-hydrated, they began a second round of their sex lottery. Julian picking first and smiling as she pulls Michael Proudhoof’s name.<br />
“Looks like this cougar is getting some venison,” The horny furry smacking her lips in a lustful fashion; making Michael’s ears twitch in mild nervousness while his rod quickly reached full mast.<br />
“Yippee,” Rachael beaming; “I get to play with a jungle cat.” The anthro lioness furry grinning as she shows Denise Proudhoof’s name to the rest of the group.<br />
“That leaves you and me,” Lucas looking at Edward; “since you gave me a blow job that turned me into this buff wolf furry you see before you, I want it up the ass this time. Make me feel you foxy knot.”<br />
“Not a problem,” Edward grinning as he approaches his next nightly conquest, his vulpine phallic already at the ready and leaking pre-cum.</p>
