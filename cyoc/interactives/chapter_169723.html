<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hours later, Peter was still revolted at his new life and furious at his failure to forget his old one. Being Dan&#39;s cock was ridiculous! Dan scratched him a few times through his pants while no one was looking, which was some of the only excitement Peter got except when Dan went to the bathroom. Peter was just a body part now, so he went wherever the football jock&#39;s faraway brain chose to go, which turned out to be mostly to classes and football practice since tonight wasn&#39;t a party night. Being inside the jockstrap was a weird experience: he could feel every jolt as Dan would tackle somebody, but Peter himself was held safely in place by a firm plastic dome.<br />
<br />
Peter&#39;s first erection as a penis had really caught him off guard. It really wasn&#39;t until the second time that he really figured it out. It just felt like he was suddenly able to stand up again and somehow couldn&#39;t resist. He could feel Dan&#39;s heartbeat pulsing inside him as he got a burst of vigor and pushed himself up tight against the fabric of his brother&#39;s undies. Peter couldn&#39;t tell if Dan was aroused or just having one of the many random boners a guy gets that just go unnoticed. Peter knew what it was like to have those. He didn&#39;t know if he was ever going to get used to being one though. Peter was going to be fully aware of his brother&#39;s every erection from now on, from start to finish, because Peter was going to be responsible for every single one of them, whether Dan noticed or not.<br />
<br />
Dan urinated three times that afternoon after Peter&#39;s initial experience as a cock. Two times were small quantities just between classes, but the third time was the long hearty piss Dan so desperately needed after the extensive physical activity of football practice. Dan spent the last twenty minutes of practice feeling like he was going to burst, and poor old Peter was down there feeling it too. He felt the pressure back there waiting to burst forth at any moment, strenuously trying to hold it back until Dan mentally gave him the signal to let loose. The strong, fast flood surging through the urethra was a relief for both of them.<br />
<br />
Peter realized he was going to be there every time his brother went to the bathroom from now on, because that was his new purpose since his foolish misuse of the Chronivac. He would never eat or drink again or even take another piss of his own. His role was to release Dan&#39;s urine whenever Dan couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t hold it in. When Dan was 60 years old, Peter was still going to be there, spewing Dan&#39;s byproducts into some future toilet. Peter had gone from being his brother to being his means of expelling liquid waste, and only Peter would ever know that this wasn&#39;t the original state of affairs. It was sickening.<br />
<br />
Peter was down there feeling totally dejected when Dan suddenly took of his pants and released Peter into the free air. They were in the shower room back at the dorm! Peter actually cheered up a little bit at the thought that his new owner might be going to wash him off. He&#39;d been starting to feel sweaty down there under all those clothes. Oddly, though, the water wasn&#39;t running yet. Dan seemed to be waiting for something.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Peter felt it again: the throbbing heartbeat that made him stiffen, and stiffen, and stiffen. He stood up straighter and straighter and pointed straight out in front, feeling strong. Familiar hormones were coursing through the blood in Peter&#39;s veins that filled him with excitement and expectation. He thought maybe he had an idea what was about to happen. Dan was staring at Peter with a focus Peter had directed to his own male organ many times before the change. Peter would have gulped if he could still swallow. Instead, he swallowed in reverse, spitting up Dan&#39;s precum, wondering if he were truly ready for this.<br />
<br />
The horny college student put a firm hand around his dripping member and raised it up to the top and all the way back down. Peter shuddered, feeling Dan&#39;s meaty hand work him up and down like that. It happened again, and Peter un-swallowed another mouthful of fluid. He wished he had some way to tell his former brother to keep going, but there was no need to. The hand kept pumping, making Peter stronger and more elated. It must have felt good to Dan, too, because the familiar voice moaned and said, &quot;Oh, yeah, almost ... there ...&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter felt a tension building up in his nether regions that he recognized as a pending orgasm. As a human, it would have been quickly followed by pulses of semen shooting out of his erect penis. As a penis, Peter braced himself and felt the first burst of fluid bloat up his torso and launch out of his mouth. He relaxed and braced himself again, felt himself fill up again and felt himself empty out. Every burst sent a wave of unspeakable bliss rippling down through Peter&#39;s cock body, and every wave of pleasure through Peter rattled up along Dan&#39;s spinal cord and into the macho man&#39;s brain. Dan had been stressed and needing to blow off steam every since Dr. Emiliano assigned that stupid presentation. A good old fashioned hand job had been just what he needed! Little did he know that the nine inch rod he was pleasuring had been his own brother only a few hours before.</p>
