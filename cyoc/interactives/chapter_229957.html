<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Dehlia&#39;s milk flowed from her endless supply, Chris felt as it pleasantly burned within him. His body was attempting to resist the nectar as it began working, but mere mortality could never stand against the divinity that was now reshaping him. As the milk was digested and the energies within released, his whole being was supercharged as the essence of the goddess birthed him anew. His muscles spasmed, his blood boiled, his whole being shook within the tender embrace of his mother as humanity left him, replaced with the loving touch of godhood. No, not quite. Rather, the two were entwining, the best of both worlds combining as he truly became the child of his mother, the power and perfection of divinity intermingling with the creativity, drive and endless potential of mortality. And for such a combination his body was inadequate.<br />
<br />
Chris sighed as his manhood pulled in, a new chasm digging itself where it had once stood. Yes, it made sense. Such an overpowering and feminine goddess as his mother could never produce male offspring. They needed to be girls, made in her image, to spread her perfection and grace throughout the world. With hardly a thought he gave up on his masculinity, his former life. He became a She, Him changed to Her, Male lengthened into a Female and Chris evolved into Christina. A superior name for a superior being. Her new pussy was already drooling as her sexual organs were reconfiguring, a large and fertile womb blooming within her abdomen. Her former balls had been moulded into a new form, Fallopian Tubes connecting them as ovaries. All the sperm within was squirming and shifting as the divine power permeating their new home commanded them to change, to grow and enlarge as they became eggs. Huge, deliciously fertile demigoddess eggs that would eradicate the Y chromosome of any sperm lucky enough to combine with them, ensuring that Dehlia&#39;s lineage would remain female forever.<br />
<br />
While this most sacred change was happening, the rest of Christina&#39;s body wasn&#39;t left behind. She groaned as her body cracked, every single one of her bones creaking as they began to grow, her height climbing with her lengthening spine and legs. Soon her clothes began to tear, helpless against the onslaught of the new body. Her skin grew alongside them to contain the larger body as all her pores spat out unnecessary body hair, leaving her hands, legs, chest and vagina clean shaven and smooth as silk. The rest was washed away by her new skin secreting sweet, delicious-smelling sweat. As her growth finished at 6&#39;5 feet, her bones now many times stronger than titanium, she began to tan. Closer to the deep, impenetrable black of her mother but still retaining a more human brown hue to it. Her clothes were mere tatters now, but it didn&#39;t matter as her bare body needed no covering. Faint golden lines drew themselves into the new skin, clear indication of her godly lineage.<br />
<br />
Still drinking in the milk, Christina began panting as her muscles worked themselves into overdrive. Her flesh was undulating, swelling, growing. Deep within her muscle fibers were being stimulated by endless energy, engorging themselves on power as they worked until they broke, then healed and worked again, each time becoming stronger and stronger. This process was repeated billions upon billions of times across her whole body as her muscles swelled into pleasing female fitness. Not bulging and huge like her mother, but visibly strong. Their appearance hiding the fact that within a few minutes she could punch through concrete or lift cars with ease. Even her organs were improving, optimizing and evolving in accordance to the will of divinity. Her heart was beating at double, then triple speed, pumping brand new blood throughout her body that was thicker and flaked with gold. Her lungs filled up as their capacity increased and they evolved to filter out toxins and other harmful gases, even allowing  her to survive a vacuum for hours. Her stomach acid increased in potency and her digestive tract improved to compensate, allowing her to eat and digest anything with her new, sparkling, perfectly straight and indestructible teeth. Even her liver swelled and toughened, making her immune to poison.<br />
<br />
But a body of a demigoddess wasn&#39;t complete without its feminine attributes. As the changes were nearing their climax, Dehlia placed her palm on Christina&#39;s abdomen and softly caressed it. Christina moaned, having fallen into a trancelike state but still drinking the milk as her mother caressed her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my daughter,&quot; she spoke. &quot;Take the last step. Claim your heritage. Become my apostle.<br />
<br />
Her hand glowed golden as she channeled power directly into Christina. Combined with the milk it was building, building and building until...<br />
<br />
POP POP<br />
<br />
With dual pops her womb sprouted two extra ovaries, already brimming with godly estrogen and eggs. The dam broke and Christina&#39;s change cascaded.<br />
<br />
CRACK CRACK<br />
<br />
Her hips, almost indestructible as they were, broke under the direct command of the goddess, her pelvis spreading wider and wider before they healed, bringing forth Christina&#39;s extremely wide birthing hips, ideal for popping out dozens of babies. The newly formed thigh gap was nearly filled in as her hips and thighs gushed with fat, combining with the muscles to create legs that many men would even wish to be crushed by. Her hair cascaded down her back as it grew new follicles at breakneck speed, becoming an untearable but silken waterfall of perfectly straight onyx black and gold strands that framed her new body like a cape all the way down to her calves. Her face crackled as her cheekbones rose, chin sharpened, nose shrunk and lips puffed up into perfectly kissable pillows, complete with natural golden lipstick, to create a face of absolute regality. A face that would signal authority and inspire obedience. Her closed eyes snapped open, the pupils now deep blue and glowing faintly gold as the final change was upon her.<br />
<br />
Mass flowed into her chest as her dark nipples throbbed, more than ready for their apotheosis. Ever since masculinity was expunged from her body, they had known that it was their destiny to ascend, to become the crowning jewels of her female majesty. And now, it was finally time. There was no slow and gradual change as Christina&#39;s chest exploded, copious amounts of fat and mammary glands generating within the newborn breasts. They grew and grew and grew, Dehlia encouraging their development with her glowing hand as the nipples drank in her touch, growing to meet the goddess&#39; fingers as they rose up, her areolas gaining surface area as the new tits grew to defy all expectations. They were soft, softer than the silkiest of pillows. They were firm, standing as perfectly formed teardrops on her chest. They were large, busting through cup sizes at astounding speeds. C, D and E were soon left behind as the prestigious mammaries were reaching higher and higher, not satisfied until they reached F and finally G. They were done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no. Not yet,&quot; Dehlia declared. With a divine finger she poked both nipples.<br />
<br />
BOOM! They lurched forward, claiming more space as they became massive, heaving, backbreaking, undeniable, immense and perfect H-cup tits. Christina finally let go of her mother&#39;s nipple as she gasped out loud, her voice now an angelic tune of absolute femininity. At the same time her nipples wordlessly squealed from the final touch of the goddess as her boobs warmed up and begun churning. With a gush, they expelled a stream of Christina&#39;s very own milk, white as snow and filled with nutrients. Dehlia perfectly scooped up a drop midair and brought it to her lips, savoring the taste of her daughter&#39;s produce. She immediately knew that it wasn&#39;t nearly as potent as her own, natural considering her daughter&#39;s status as a demigoddess, but it had other properties Christina was sure to discover and enjoy in due time.<br />
<br />
With that, it was over. Panting and sweating within the embrace of her mother was a newly born demigoddess, ready to serve her every whim. Dehlia smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the world, Christina,&quot; She whispered. &quot;We are going to do great things together.</p>
