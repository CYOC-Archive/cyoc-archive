<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know what?&quot; Her mother asked while tapping away at her accursed phone. &quot;Maybe I do want to parade you around like a cow.&quot; With a final jab of her finger, the changes were confirmed.<br />
<br />
Joanna was startled by the sudden appearance of a collar around her neck. She reached up and felt a wide band of leather wrapped snuggly around her throat. Her fingers brush against something hard and there was a brief metallic clang. That&#39;s when Joanna realized she was wearing a cowbell. Panic began to creep in when she failed to find any kind of latch or buckle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any idea how many people have a cow fetish? Look up &#39;cowgirl&#39; and it won&#39;t be just jeans and denim you find,&quot; her mother chastised.<br />
<br />
BLORP<br />
<br />
Joanna cries out in shock as her body surges outward in an explosion of fat. In an instant her weight had doubled.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, please. I don&#39;t want to be fat!&quot; Joanna begs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please, you think everyone wants a skinny little waif in their bed? Those magazines are feeding you a string of bullshit,&quot; her mother lectured her swollen daughter. &quot;People care about one thing in a woman: the three B&#39;s. Boobs, butts and bellies!&quot;<br />
<br />
And it was clear to see that was exactly what Jaonna had just been burdened with. Her face, back and limbs remained slim as all the fat had been funneled into her curves. She wrapped her arms around tits engorged to the size of medicine balls, feeling her arms sink into the warm flesh. Reaching down further, the fattened girl found the newest addition to her frame. A big, round blob of dough nestled under her breasts. A person might have thought she was pregnant if her belly wasn&#39;t so soft and squishy. Below this were hips and thighs that had easily caught up with her butt. Fat saddle bags that reached the span of her arms and thunder thighs that were impossible to separate, no matter how far she spread her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;The world doesn&#39;t care how fat you get,&quot; her mother went on. &quot;People want one thing from woman. And that&#39;s for them get BIGGER!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no!&quot; Joanna cries in despair. <br />
<br />
BLORP<br />
<br />
Joanna was swallowed up by the explosion of flesh. What remained was a human shaped parade float, filled to the brim with fat. She was as wide as she was tall, improbably broad hips that were now five feet across at their widest. Buttcheeks the size of beanbags chairs jutted out behind her with a belly to match hanging out at the front. Thighs so thick that a person could comfortably wrap their arms around one of them and give it a warm hug. The rest of her body had not been spared this time around. Joanna could feel the folds of fat draped across her back and her puffy arms made the bloated woman look the Michelin man. Her fat limbs tapered into hands that had remained rather slim. So that was a small blessing. And despite the sheer volume of adipose pumped under her skin there was not a hint of cellulite. Every inch of her flesh was delightfully soft and round. It gave the impression that she was wearing a fat suit, but it was all too real for Joanna.<br />
<br />
But by far the biggest addition were the two gigantic milk tanks in front of her. Round and enticingly full teardrops that sloped to either side of her protruding belly, thanks to the lack of support. Her breasts were significant larger than either her newly grown butt or belly. Joanna was running out of things to compare them to. Each of those fluffy sex pillows could fit a grown man inside. They easily dominated Joanna&#39;s frame and anyone standing in front of her would barley see the bloated sow standing behind them. Obscene noises emanated from her monstrous dairy factories. Her ultra fat udders audibly churned and roiled from the shear volume of milk being produced inside them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wuh,&quot; Joanna panted. &quot;What did you do? Ohhhh, I can barely move.&quot; She attempted to feel around the rolling hills of flesh, but her dimension had completely exceeded her reach. she couldn&#39;t believe all this was her. It felt more like she was buried under a fleshy avalanche. The exertion was too much for the newly minted fatty and she soon gave up. But between her monumental hips, truck tire love handles and the huge hams that were her arms she couldn&#39;t actually lower her  arms. Stuck at a T pose with her built in arm rests. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the thing about the feminine form. You don&#39;t do ANYTHING. You&#39;re something to be displayed, to be put on a pedesta … well, maybe a couch for you,&quot; said he mother.<br />
<br />
Joanna&#39;s memories shifted to fit this twisted ideal. Highschool became a fever dream as her classmates obsessed over her overgrown curves. Having the biggest ass and tits in the entire school wasn&#39;t enough for them. Her history became a long line of friends exploiting her for their own carnal pleasure. Boyfriends who only cared about stuffing her with food and their cocks. The cheerleader squad that gave her diet pills, only to learn too late that they had been slipping her lactation pills and  bovine growth hormones. Even her mother got in on it, keeping her daughter on a strict regimen of oils and creams to keep everything smooth and supple. Joanna felt old memories slipping away as her debilitating curves grew ever bigger. She couldn&#39;t remember not obliterating chairs since puberty hit her like a train. Cheer squad, social events and hanging out with friends turned into eating, fucking and milking.<br />
<br />
It all became too much after waking up after a party with that cowbell around her neck and she gave up on finishing highschool. Although, truthfully, one has to able to fit though normal doors to attend school. Gone were the good grades and piles of letters from universities that would love to have her mother&#39;s money. Now she was a highschool dropout with an OnlyFans account. Too fat for school, too fat for a social events, too fat for a normal life. Joanna now lived the sexual fantasy of a BBW.<br />
Even her clothes changed with her new lifestyle.</p>
