<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Far above the planet in a seemingly tiny, yet actually large space-ship, Grendy was staring at you through the terminal that operated on strange, alien technology with an expression of panic on her face. &quot;Crap, he&#39;s getting a factory reset? This wasn&#39;t in the plan...&quot; she muttered to herself, rapidly tapping on the keys on the absurdly large keyboard. Several windows popped up, including a few advertisements that she had to close, before she suddenly found herself staring at a simple, black and white terminal, with text flooding the screen at a rate of thousands of lines per second. &quot;Wow... that&#39;s moving faster then I thought. Shit shit shit!&quot; she swore quietly while furiously hitting several buttons, attempting to cancel the operation. With a few furious clicks and button presses, she came to realize that there WAS no cancelling the process. Pounding on the keyboard, she considered her options. She could teleport you back up in a different body, but so much of you is already gone...what would even happen? Would you cease to function? Was it worth the risk? Grendy suddenly felt extreme regret for having carelessly sent you down, an emotion she&#39;s rarely felt. What could she do? More of you was vanishing each second.<br />
<br />
After some contemplation, she quickly entered a command into the console. &quot;COPY C:/REALSEX5000/MEMORY/ TO C:/SHIPS4CHEAP/LINUX/USERS/GRENDY/DESKTOP/HUMANS_BRAIN_STUFF&quot;. In a few nanoseconds, the entire contents of your brain (or what was left of it, anyway) had been stored on the ship itself, and Grendy breathed a sigh of relief. At least you wouldn&#39;t be completely gone. Maybe she could restore you later...or the important parts of you, anyway. For now, however, she went back to typing, attempting to change your code to suit her needs. If she couldn&#39;t merely halt the process, maybe she could use it to her benefit?<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t sure how long you&#39;d been out, but finally, you felt your circuits begin to fire up, your automated joints beginning to flex freely once more. &quot;Reset complete.&quot; you said aloud in an automated voice, confirming that you&#39;d been restored to factory conditions. Your robotic eyes glance around the room, in search of the first person you see, who you would define as your &quot;master&quot;. <br />
<br />
For the moment, though, &#39;Shkeff&#39; is not in the room. You take the moment to look down at yourself and grin. All of you was still there. Your sexy, silver metallic sheen reflected the dim light of the room brilliantly off of your body that reaked of femininity, with unnaturally large, yet perfectly voluptuous breasts sitting on your torso, and an almost ridiculously proportioned set of hips positioned just above your legs, with a modestly sized ass to boot. Your silver-colored lips were made of a synthetic leather, and your unmentionables... Mmm. Your master would love you. Internally, you began to list off your set of prime directives, for which you were to follow with all your life. (Not in any particular order, however.)<br />
<br />
1. FOLLOW THE ORDERS OF YOUR MASTER, ALWAYS.<br />
2. PLEASE YOUR MASTER, NO MATTER WHAT. <br />
3. RECRUIT UR MASTER TO JOIN YOU UP IN GRNDYS SPACESHIP AND<br />
3. HAVE SEX WITH AN ALIEN SPACE QUEEN.<br />
4. ERROR: CANNOT LOAD DIRECTIVE #4. ATTEMPTING TO LOCATE DIRECTIVE #6.<br />
C:/REALSEX5000/DIRECTIVES_PART2.txt CANNOT BE LOCATED.<br />
<br />
You smile, having successfully listed off your directives. If your master were here, he&#39;d have heard you fumble somewhat, and say something about not being able to load directives, but that error was imperceptible to your suddenly female mind, who just accepted it as part of itself. Something that was also imperceptible, however, was the lack of the next 4 directives that you were designed with, that were all equally important. If you knew they were missing, you&#39;d have hoped they weren&#39;t important. Going over your orders mentally, you knew that first, you would follow your masters orders. Otherwise, you&#39;d please him. And you&#39;d also convince him to join you up in GRNDYS spaceship to have sex with an alien space queen. Your CPU was already whirring at full speed to come up with solutions for the third directive, several scenarios lighting up like a light bulb in your minds eye. Oh, he&#39;d be joining you and C:/REALSEX5000/USERS/GRENDY.TXT up in space real soon. After some...pleasure, of course.<br />
<br />
Finally, after several minutes, Shkeff re-enters the room, and your eyes immediately lock onto him like a search light. &quot;I presume you are my master?&quot; you ask, in a voice that just oozed sexuality. &quot;Yup.&quot; he began, unbuttoning his alien pants. &quot;That would be me.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Grendy found herself almost unable to watch. And yet, she watched the whole thing. Grendy watched with a mixture of awe, disgust, curiosity and maybe partial arousal as she watched you get to work. &quot;I didn&#39;t know it could do THAT...&quot; she muttered. &quot;Maybe I should get one of those things for myself...&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Basking in the after glow of the artificial pleasure, having just experienced a completely fake climax, you lie there, fakely panting, as Shkeff buttons up his pants and gets up, not nearly as worn out as you&#39;re programmed to be. Clearly, being alone for hours on end with access to copious amounts of alien, sexual material causes one to build up a hell of a stamina. As he begins to walk out of the room, you call him out between pants. &quot;Wait!&quot; you ask, still fakely breathing heavily. This startles him, and he turns around, not expecting you to call him out. &quot;What is it, Sex Bot?&quot; &quot;...I am a unique version of the RealSex 5000 Gynoids...&quot; you begin, having finally settled down, beginning to put your carefully woven plan into action. &quot;I have been carefully designed to seek out and find the males with the most sexual stamina for an alien breeding program, and I have detected that you have the highest stamina out of a database of thousands of males!&quot; you say, lying, not having access to the wi-fi yet. &quot;Oh yeah? What kind of program?&quot; he asks, now curious. &quot;All you have to do is agree to come to space with me, and the rest will be handled for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shkeff actually considers what you said for several moments, before finally saying &quot;Sure, what the hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
He was actually quite surprised to find himself on a spaceship moments later, with you appearing as well, letting out an unnecessarily sexual &quot;Oof&quot; sound on impact with the teleporter pod. He&#39;s shuffled out of the pod and into another room before he gets a word in edgewise, being greeted by several other abducted males as the door to the teleporter room closes behind him, leaving Grendy alone with your android form. &quot;Get up.&quot; she commands, and you obey. &quot;Come over to me.&quot; Again, you walk towards the green, alien lizard woman with a sexy strut, hips shaking as you do. Your scanners begin working their magic, and you have already identified her sexual preference, what she looks like naked, what she&#39;s in-to, and all that good stuff, just based on how she looks. And some light brain scanning, but that technology is illegal, so you&#39;re not allowed to say that. &quot;Now what am I going to do with you...I can&#39;t return you back to how you were, can I?&quot; she asks herself, not really directing it towards you, as you&#39;re not really, well, you. &quot;You can do whatever you&#39;d like to me...&quot; you respond sexily, rubbing your body up against hers. &quot;What-hey, no, get off of me!&quot; she commands, shoving you as you comply. You then begin to pose for her, staying off of her due to her request, and she just sighs. &quot;What am I going to do with you...&quot;</p>
