<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lina could feel nothing but extreme bliss as the blue mist attempted to pierce her cervix over and over, like a battering ram, but something at the back of Linas mind told her to look out the window, as she did she saw that the clouds were moving, but that could not be, due to time being temporarily frozen.<br />
<br />
Lina watched in fascination as the clouds began to spiral around the train, creating an eye of a storm, then a giant blue eye appeared in the clouds, glowing like fire, and it seemed to peer straight into Linas soul, a shiver ran down her back as the eye disappeared and the clouds began to gather infront of the train, they began to morph and stretch, sparks of lightning shooting from within, Lina attempted to reach for the controlls of the train, but tendrals of the blue mist had emerged from her birth canal, wrapping tightly around her arms and legs, holding her in place.<br />
<br />
Then the clouds began to move, then what Lina guessed to be wings grew white mist feathers, and began to flap, first two wings, then four and finally six!, Lina had never seen anything so large or so bizarre in her life, as its head emerged from the clouds, white as snow and resembling that of a Eagle, its piercing blue eyes as cold as ice-cold directly into the cabin, straight at Lina<br />
<br />
Then Lina saw at the heart of the monstrous bird was a woman, where there should have been arms were two white wings, resembling that of a snowy owl, with black spots dotted around on their feathers, her eyes appeared to be made of fire, the flames rising out of her sockets, but the flames were oce blue, she wore what looked to be a type of breast cover top, covered in black feathers and a skirt that was longer on the left side than the right, with black feathers along the belt, the fabric itself was sky blue with golden cloud designs on it, and Lina was in awe of the woman&#39;s skin, it was a ritch tan colour, not one imperfection could be seen apart from the massive scar across her midsection<br />
<br />
The mist bird let out a powerful, ear piercing screech, the blue mist within Lina began to pulsate, then it began to thrash within her almost desperate to get in her womb, before it gave up and seeped out of  Lina&#39;s womanhood and through the wooden floor, Lina was left in the command chair, gasping and panting, before her hands flew to her belly, checking all over its surface to see if Luna was OK, getting a solid kick in response.<br />
<br />
A loud screeching tore Linas attention back outside, the blue mist had latched on to the side of the birds neck, its blue tendrils seeping into its mist, spreading like veins, then the bird reached its talons up and clawed at the blue mist, but to no avail, then the bird closed its eyes and struck its neck with its talons, sending a Misty chunk with the ball of blue mist still attached  tumbling down and through the cloud line.<br />
<br />
White mist was now falling like a waterfall out of the birds gaping wond, the woman inside had a large wound on the side of her neck, her left side of her feathered top now covered in blood, she now looked hurt, and angry as time started up again, Lina saw half a dozen red dots approaching at super sonic speed,  Lina then grabbed the intercom as fast as she could &quot;EVERYONE BRACE FOR IMPACT, WERE UND-&quot; she Shouted before an impact on the side of the train knocked the intercom out of her hand &quot;what just happened&quot; said Viki as she ran on to the comand deck &quot;and what the hell is that!&quot; She screamed as she saw the bird, now wrestling around with the enemy.<br />
<br />
They looked humanoid, with large mist made insect wings sprouting from their backs and ant like armor covering their bodies, Lightning flashed within the bird as it let out a burst of energy, the lightning jumping from one soldier to another, causing each to burst into flames<br />
<br />
&quot;They are what&#39;s been hunting us this past week, as for the bird I&#39;m unsure about the whole friend or foe situation&quot; said Lina as she tried to interface with the train, but then a white mist tendral shot out of the console and spread across the desk, in a web of white mist, it then began operating the train, tendrals pressing buttons, flipping leavers and turning dials and wheels, and the train obeyed each comand, the train began circling the bird over and over, gaining speed, but somehow everyone and everything in the train were unaffected by the speed or the continuous turning.<br />
<br />
Clouds began to spiral around the giant bird, creating a massive tornado, the birds lightning turning ice blue as it followed the air current, spiraling higher and higher, before it all gathered into the center and shot down at the birds open mouth, and it came out an a massive EMP like birst, causing every soldier to loose their armour and wings, all of them sent tumbling towards the ground.<br />
<br />
The train once again stood still, suspended in mid air, everyone too shocked to speak, what the hell just happened, first the blue mist tries to get to Linas baby and then a giant cloud bird with yet ANOTHER of Echos kind controlling it inside, Just how many of them were out there now?<br />
<br />
Then the train shuddered as the giant bird landed atop it, its talons locked tightly around the train for support, pulling up a camera Violet saw it was breathing heavily and laboured, it&#39;s wound looking to have small tendrals of blue still in it, causing the bird and the woman to groan and grimis in pain, Lina then stood up and waddled towards the door to the lounge car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you think your pregnant ass is going?&quot; Said Viki with a serious look on her face, Lina just smiled &quot;to let on the person who just saved our skins&quot; she said as she walked into the train car, Viki and Lucy close behind,<br />
<br />
As they entered they saw her, laying on her side on the sofa, a small trickle of blood dripping down the sofa from her neck, her wings were covering her body as she sniffed, she was crying, upon hearing the door to the comand car shut she sat bolt upright, her wings spread out in what Lina guessed to be a threat display, her neck, left arm and the left side of her white hair were drenched in blood, and her now Ice blue eyes had clear nags beneath them, like she hadn&#39;t slept in days<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you&quot; said Lina as she cautiously stepped towards the girl, the girl glared at Lina, before her eyes widened and she ran at Lina wrapping her wings around her &quot;mother of Echo, I&#39;m I&#39;m need of your help&quot;<br />
<br />
Lina was in shock about this girls reaction, but if she wanted answers she knew she had to play along, &quot;What can I do ymto help you miss?&quot; The woman then looked up as she began to turn into white mist,<br />
<br />
&quot;I need you to rebirth me, my master is dead, she gave me this body, and without her I grow weaker&quot; she said as she seeped into Linas pussy, much like the ball of blue mist, but she was more gentle, just as eager, but not trying to force her way in, Lina lay on the floor massaging her swelling womb as Viki and Lucy held her hands in support as her midsection finished expanding, looking down into her womb Lina saw th woman was now a young 7 month baby, her wings were now fluffy instead of white grand feathers the woman&#39;s voice spoke in Linas head &quot;thank you mother, now I need a name&quot;<br />
<br />
Lina thought about it as she came down from her pleasurable experience before thinking of the perfect name for her new baby girl &quot;hello Storm&quot; she said as she petted her belly were she could feel Sorm moving<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least that&#39;s over&quot; said Lina closing her eyes and giving a sigh before she herd a familiar little voice in her head &quot;Mama?&quot; Came Echos little voice &quot;my little sister are in your tummy........so can I be as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lina gave a sigh &quot;well.....oh alright&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as she said those words, a cloud of green mist appeared between her legs, and began to eagerly shoot up towards her cervix &quot;I can never deny my baby girl&quot; she said causing Viki to do a double take of what was said &quot;umm so this is Echo going into me?&quot; She asked, but that couldn&#39;t be right, Echo was going inside Lina &quot;No she&#39;s currently shooting up into me, moaned Lucy as she rubbed her rapidly growing swell &quot;Echo your in big trouble young lady, Mama Viki is not happy&quot; moaned Viki as she smiled &quot;oh what the hell, make yourself comfortable sweetie&quot; she said as he cupped one had above and below her growing belly, cradling it lovingly<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I&#39;m a triplet mommy, now I can be with my two new sisters and all my mommies at the same time&quot; said Echos voice faintly to Lina who rolled her eyes &quot;you can be such a silly girl sweetheart, but that&#39;s why we love you&quot;</p>
