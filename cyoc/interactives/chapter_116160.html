<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You saw red two headed dragon costume in the bag, one of the heads seemed to be fake, but it was stuffed to fit the wearer. The head that was to be yours was a mask, and the mask seemed to fit you. You then noticed a &quot;on size fits all&quot; sticker on the costume, and you figured that the costume was unique in it&#39;s own sense so you made your purchase, and left for home. <br />
<br />
When you got home, and into your bedroom you decided to try on the costume for yourself, and see exactly why it was on clearance like it was. So you dawned the costume like it was and zipped it up, but didn&#39;t notice anything off or damaged like you expected. You then inspected the mask seeing that it was in the same condition, and pulled it over your face just to see how it felt on your face. However shortly after you slipped on the mask you suddenly felt a splash of liquid cover your body, and you immediately turned around but saw nothing, and remembering that you were the only person in your house.<br />
<br />
You then looked around to see if you had spilled a glass of water, or a drink you forgot about earlier, but there was nothing around you. You were extremely confused now, and decided to take the costume off, but when you reached for the zipper it was covered, and was slowly dissolving in a red gooey latex substance. Immediately after that you felt an unknown surge that wasn&#39;t painful, but you were knocked out by it falling on your stomach in your bedroom.<br />
<br />
The next thing you knew was that your body felt numb momentarily, well the right side of your body was, and your left side remained numb. You then basically drifted off into a deep sleep, unaware of what was happening to you. You then felt like your head was being nudged, and prodded over and over again. You eventually heard a voice mumbling something, but couldn&#39;t understand it. You eventually began falling asleep again, but then felt something big punch your face.<br />
<br />
You woke up yelling, but it sounded more like a high pitched roar. &quot;Owww, what&#39;s with the loud noises! Not even 10 seconds after you wake up nonetheless.&quot; You heard a voice like a teenage girl come from your left. You looked over to see a dragon&#39;s head looking right at you, and you screamed again, and it sounded like another roar. &quot;Damnit! Why are you so loud sister!&quot; The dragon head roared back, and you looked at it puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister?&quot; You questioned realizing your voice was high pitched, and sounded exactly like the dragon&#39;s head next to you. You looked down frantically looking all around your body, and were shocked to find that your body was that of a dragoness. Red scales, huge claws instead of hands and feet, wings, tail, and vagina between your legs. &quot;What! What the hell?! Why am I a dragon!?&quot; You said shocked, and then looked to the other dragon on the room snarling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey don&#39;t look at me sis, I&#39;m just as puzzled as you are about this. I literally woke up, and freaked out when I saw another head on my shoulders, or I guess our shoulders now.&quot; The dragon head said <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what do you mean by &quot;our&quot; shoulders?&quot; You asked and looked back seeing that your neck was incredibly long, and attached to the same body as the other dragons head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god we&#39;re a two headed dragon, and I&#39;m female!&quot; You said in disgust <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I wasn&#39;t the one who allegedly put on the apparel, or whatever I was turned into eons ago. That and the technical term is dragoness, not dragons, those are male, and we&#39;re female as you said we were. Although you were male, which I inferredbased off of your reaction, I&#39;d say we have priorities, besides dragons aren&#39;t really that smart when comparing to a dragoness.&quot; The dragoness head said giving you a nervous smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh okay then I guess, who are you? Oh god who am I? I can&#39;t go by my old name.&quot; You said clutching your head with your claw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well since we&#39;re technically body sisters, or twins as you call it we technically share the same name. However, we have to split the name because we have to refer to each other as separate entities. My original name was Scarinder, which is a combination between Scarlet and Cinderwith a nice gender name twist. Now I guess I&#39;m Scarlet, and your Cinder because names go from left to right like us heads.&quot; The dragoness head, Scarlet said <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait we&#39;re siblings too? Damn, I am never going to get used to this.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheer up Cinder I&#39;m always here for you, c&#39;mon pick your half up off the ground at least. The one thing we&#39;re going to have to adapt to together is moving, because uh we only have half body control.&quot; Scarlet said and you saw your left half of your body stand up. You immediately mimicked it, and you saw that you weren&#39;t that large for a dragon, and you were about as big as a golden retriever. &quot;See Cindy there you are, now we need to walk.&quot; Scarlet said <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay before we do anything I actually have some things I want to know. How old are we exactly? Because last time I checked I wasn&#39;t a kid. Two what body parts do we control if they are in the center of our body? And three, Cindy?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Cindy is just a cuter version of Cinder don&#39;t you think sis? Also I&#39;m about 28 millenniums old, or in human numbers about 15 years of physical age, or I guess now we&#39;re that age. Finally about the middle body parts, us dragons have two stomachs, two digestive systems, and tho only thing split in that way are bladder, and bowels. From what I feel you have bladder, and I have bowels, which is why we&#39;re currently standing on a wet floor. So we just did sleep on a floor of piss, nothing that unordinary for us, besides you aren&#39;t used to our clit yet so it&#39;s natural.&quot; Scarlet said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god we what?&quot; You said realizing the wet feeling beneath your paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Correction YOU wet the floor Cinder why do you care exactly it&#39;s not like we&#39;re in a cave right now?&quot; Scarlet asked<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my house.&quot; You said, but you felt Scarlet moving forward, so you moved along with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I guess that&#39;s a human thing, oh well, let&#39;s just go outside and see how the dragons, and us dragonesses are treating humans. Also, yes we&#39;re walking as one! I wonder if any elves or orcs are around outside too.&quot; Scarlet said<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa whoa there sis, before we just go outside like this, which we shouldn&#39;t for multiple reason, listen to me explain how the world is like now.&quot; You said stopping before reaching the door<br />
<br />
&quot;Oookay then, what&#39;s the matter Cindy?&quot; Scarlet asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well as far as we are concerned about actually staying alive! You should know that humans are the only form of intelligent, and/or sentient life. Elves, Orcs, and all forms of our species are considered nonexistent to humans, and we as a dragoness aren&#39;t the best depicted in mythology, and will most likely either be captured of killed on sight. So we won&#39;t be finding anything but humans anywhere I know of.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...was there an extinction event recently or what?&quot; Scarlet asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh several that I know in planetary existence, but one happened roughly 66 million years ago.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;How long have I been a garment?&quot; Scarlet began getting tears in her eyes<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything...everyone is dead from my past everything i....&quot; Scarlet began sobbing, but paused <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait I know how to fix everything, I know of a place where we can just replace every human body, and soul with older members. It can&#39;t be far from here, and I bet our mom and dad are part of the soul collection. We can change the whole world into dragons, and dragonesses thanks to the elders emergency method.&quot; Scarlet said cheerfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait all humans? Won&#39;t we be basically wiping out the race?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...yes, but you said it yourself Cinder if we are sighted we&#39;re going to be either killed or captured, or both. So it&#39;s either this a world with our species, and no humans, or the other way around and we die. Besides I know a lot of people in our community, and they can help us...I think. We can&#39;t just stay here for our whole life anyways, and I don&#39;t know how to hunt animals, and our condition now will only further hinder my...or our ability to do so.&quot; Scarlet said <br />
<br />
&quot;Damnit...she&#39;s right, and survival in the forest isn&#39;t an option considering we&#39;re...this.&quot; You thought<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you agree, I can hear your thoughts by the way, because we&#39;re connected, and we can secretly communicate now.&quot; Scarlet chimed in<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay okay, let&#39;s get a map to find a route first, and wait till nighttime at least.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re really smart sis, I guess you&#39;ll lead now considering you probably know where to look.&quot; Scarlet said</p>
