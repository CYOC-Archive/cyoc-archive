<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>"The first thing I don't think you'll mind," Derek began. "I want you to come down to my level. Shrink to match my height."
<P>In a matter of seconds, Derek watched in awe as his girlfriend did exactly that. Sonya shivered once she stopped getting smaller, going from 6'3" to match Derek's 5'10". They stared into each other's eyes like never before, prompting Derek to move closer to her.
<P>"Don't stop it there," Sonya said softly. She was clearly amazed that the transformation actually occurred. "This is your chance to be taller for a change."
<P>"Okay, then. Shrink two more inches."
<P>Sonya complied.
<P>"Wow, this is incredible," Derek said. "How does it feel?"
<P>"A little disorienting," Sonya said. "But the change didn't feel like much of anything."
<P>"Maybe you can feel this," Derek said. "White fur will grow to cover your entire body."
<P>Sonya gasped and rubbed her bare thighs as the tiny white hairs began to grow in. "Oh wow," she shivered. "I can feel it all over!" Soon she was covered from head to toe in white fur. Derek took another step closer and hugged his new furry girlfriend. She stroked her shoulders up and down.
<P>Sonya shivered some more. "Jeez does that feel weird. Rub me the wrong way again." Derek obliged and felt her shake once more. "Derek, this is incredible! Wait till you get your turn! It's more than we could have imagined."
<P>"And we're nowhere close to being finished," Derek mused. He let her go and backed away again, examining her. Sonya seemed to be idly scratching her bra strap. "Are those itchy?"
<P>"Yeah, a little," Sonya said. They exchanged a daring look and Sonya shrugged. She undid her bra and slid off her panties, revealing privates covered in thick white fur. Her breasts had a light coating of fur, almost totally covering her nipples.
<P>"That fur really sets off your red hair," Derek said. "How would you feel if we grew that out?"
<P>"Be my guest," Sonya said.
<P>"Your hair will start growing longer at a visibly noticeable rate," Derek ordered. "It will be naturally colored to match its current dye and grow thicker and much wavier. Also, your ears will grow a little larger and a little longer."
<P>Sonya's shoulder-blade-length hair began to slowly creep down her backside. Meanwhile, her ears started to poke out from her growing locks. They already appeared to be forming points.
<P>"It's like they're trying to escape my head," Sonya said, feeling their fur. "What kind are they?"
<P>"I'm not sure yet," Derek said. "Right now they could be a bunch of different farm animals. Horses, cows, goats, something like that."
<P>"You haven't decided yet?" she asked, disappointed.
<P>"I'm just waiting for the inspiration to hit me," Derek winked. "Don't worry, you'll get plenty more modifications. Now let's see...," he pondered the next change as Sonya's hair approached her waist. "Your tail will be three feet long, with long fine white hairs. Your feet will change to hooves and your legs will adjust to balance on them like a hoofed animal would."
<P>Sonya almost lost her balance as her feet elongated. Her toes melted together painlessly into black hooves and her legs shifted to resemble the hind legs of a horse, or something similar. Meanwhile she could feel a weird pulling from her back that she knew was the growth of her tailbone. In no time at all she had a three-food tail covered in very long, very soft white hair that hung off it like Spanish moss. She giggled as she flexed the appendage.
<P>"It's incredible!" Sonya clumsily walked toward Derek and clutched him. "I've always dreamed of a tail, but to really have one...!" She hugged him tightly. Derek could see her tail still wagging behind her, and her hair still growing longer. It was now obscuring her butt, and the area just above it where the tail was growing out from. The waves were very pronounced now, almost like large zig-zags.
<P>Derek took her hands in his. He positioned her fingers so that he clutched her middle and index fingers on both her hands with both of his. "These fingers will fuse together." Before he could even let go, they had begun to melt together. He grasped her ring and pinky fingers. "So will these." After her hands had reshaped themselves, Sonya was left with two new thick fingers and her old thumbs. She flexed them testily.
<P>"The fur on your forearms will grow an extra six inches, and so will the fur between your knees and your ankles."
<P>"Some kind of horse feathering?" Sonya asked as her fur grew to cover a great deal of her hooves and hands.
<P>"I always thought it'd look great," Derek said, smiling at her new form.
<P>"Well I hope I live up to your expectations."
<P>"You're totally exceeding them," Derek smiled wider. He noticed her hair was down to her knees and gasped. "Oh! Your hair can stop growing now."
<P>Sonya glanced behind her and waves of bright red hair followed the motion of her head. She giggled and spun around several times. The thick waves twirled around her like a storm, and she made a beautiful tornado.
<P>"Is that all?" Sonya asked, a little disappointed but still very much amazed at her transformation. "Do you want your turn now?"</p>
