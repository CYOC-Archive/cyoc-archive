<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Liam said as he sat back down.<br />
<br />
Charlie smiled. He was eyeing Liam with even more intent. His hands were placed under his chin. &quot;It&#39;s not a problem. Did you think about what you wanted?&quot;<br />
<br />
Liam quickly grabbed the menu. The mood Charlie was putting off was even more evident. Maybe it was just that he was still changing. His body was still shrinking in on itself. The hard muscles he&#39;d always worked for were barely above the normal man. But stranger still was just how lean he was. No longer were two meaty pecs pushing out in front of him. Nor were his biceps bulging or the strong horseshoe of his tricep easily seen. And with his shoulders looking so slender, the straps of the sleeveless shirt had nothing to hold onto. But Charlie&#39;s attention was so focused on Liam, he didn&#39;t notice that one of them was drifting down his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm...&quot; Liam took a drink of his water to try to stall.<br />
<br />
Charlie&#39;s smile broadened. &quot;Anything. Anything you could possibly want. I&#39;m paying.&quot; <br />
<br />
Liam&#39;s stomach grumbled. &quot;Steak,&quot; he said with a surprising amount of authority. Even if someone else was paying, Liam would have normally been a bit courteous and ordered something a bit cheaper. But his mouth started watering at the thought of a big juicy steak. Even if it was over $150, it just made it sound all the better. After all, Charlie was paying. <br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; Charlie waved his hand toward one of the waiters, and he instantly came over. He ordered himself a bit of fish and then Liam ordered his steak rare. The thought of all the juices and blood still in the steak seemed to only make him hungrier. He felt his stomach rumble again but quickly took a drink of water to try to suppress it. &quot;So what&#39;s it like being a big, strong police man, Mr. Officer?&quot; Charlie&#39;s smile turned more coy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not too bad,&quot; Liam answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Charlie squirmed in his seat. &quot;Someone as big and strong as you probably take down all kinds of guys.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You could say that,&quot; Liam tried to ignore the saucy nature of compliment. But at the same time he kind of liked it. It wasn&#39;t often that other men complimented him that way. Nor someone like Charlie. Even if he was nearly half his normal size, he didn&#39;t seem to notice in the slightest. Meaning, that he must have respected Liam&#39;s strength at least on some level. &quot;Not many people want to mess with me.&quot; He threw up his bicep and gave it a big slap. It echoed in the nearly silent restaurant. &quot;I--&quot; Liam&#39;s eyes shifted around as a few people looked over at him. The husbands glared while a few wives seemed to be a bit more interested in the officer than they should have been. It only filled his pride up even more. But that&#39;s not why he was here. He needed to talk to Charlie about the drugs. &quot;So about the gang...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww... Boo... Hiss...&quot; Charlie rolled his eyes. &quot;Just when we were talking about something interesting...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie&#39;s smile came back. &quot;Yeah silly.&quot; He giggled and paused for a second to emphasize the next word, &quot;You.&quot; He leaned over the table, hand out and used his finger to rub underneath Liam&#39;s chin. His nails were noticeably darker, and a bit sharper. <br />
<br />
Liam felt lost in the moment. His eyes locked onto the other man. What were these feelings? Why couldn&#39;t he think about anything other than Charlie? What was going on? Lucky for him the waiter brought the food and set it down. He was a perfect gentleman, but the staff were clearly a bit uncomfortable with the two. <br />
<br />
&quot;Should we take it to go?&quot; Liam asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any reason to get you in bed faster, sounds good to me,&quot; Charlie answered. His eyes flashed light. They were turning golden. The deep black pupil turning more into a slit than the the usual circle. <br />
<br />
The corner of Liam&#39;s lip, rose ever so slightly. He tried to fight it off. His body didn&#39;t want to. Was he really this horny? He was straight. But now the thought of being in Charlie&#39;s bed didn&#39;t sound so terrible. If anything it sounded good. &quot;Alright,&quot; he answered.<br />
<br />
Charlie called over the waiter and asked for two boxes. The waiter sighed in relief and grabbed them, then boxed the plates up. Charlie gave him his card and then they were off. They rushed to the muscle car. Charlie had to adjust his seat again, but that didn&#39;t seem to bother him. <br />
<br />
And Liam didn&#39;t seem to notice. One inside, the smell of his steak was suddenly far stronger than it had been. Every bit of it was trapped in the tiny space. Salvia was working overtime in his mouth as he tried to contain himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go on,&quot; Charlie could tell what Liam was after. His legs were shifting uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t think this is the proper way to enjoy a $150 steak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You enjoy it any way you want it,&quot; Charlie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Course I will,&quot; Liam gripped the steak with both hands and bit into it. His teeth sharpened, searing through the meat as though it were nothing. Fangs grew where teeth had been. The meat didn&#39;t stand a chance as he took another big bite. &quot;So good,&quot; he nearly moaned as he continued to eat. The juices rolled out of his mouth. It ran through the rapidly growing hair on his chin. A mane was quickly growing in where nothing had been before. Dark brown fur covered his his face. <br />
<br />
Liam was losing a bit of his faculties. It was getting harder to think about anything other than his base desires. Safety. Food. Sex. He looked over at Charlie. The other man&#39;s ears had shifted to the top of his head. Each ear came up to a point. Orange and soft brown fur was taking over his skin. His nose pushed out further on his face. &quot;So... Sexy...&quot; Liam moaned. He leaned over and kissed the other man on the nape of his neck. His tongue licked at the fur growing there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same to you, Mr. Officer,&quot; Charlie giggled. He was even smaller now. He had to unbuckle his seatbelt to properly hit the gas and breaks. Luckily he was also pulling into his driveway. <br />
<br />
But at that comment, Liam pulled away. &quot;Huh?&quot; he looked down at the other man. Now more cat than he&#39;d been before. Charlie looked like a perfect little cat boy. So small that he barely even took up the seat of his car any more. He must have only weighed 90 pounds. And barely stood above 5 feet. Yet, Charlie seemed more than happy that he was in the officer&#39;s presence. But that brief moment made Liam also realize how strange he felt. How horny he felt. &quot;What&#39;s going on?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Liam looked down at his hands. Black claws jutted out the ends of his fingers. Golden fur covered the backs of his hands and it was running up his arms. It was the first time he realized just how tight his shirt was. But that was quickly followed by a loud rip. The fabric barely stood a chance as his lean muscular frame started to bulk up. Thick burly muscles stated filling out his body. Strength rapidly building inside him. &quot;What the fuck&#39;s going on!?&quot; Liam roared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; One of Charlie&#39;s claws was gently running along Liam&#39;s chest. More and more muscles was adding onto his frame, along with the golden fur. &quot;You were so curious about that drug, I figured you might want to try some of your own. How does it feel? It looks like you like it.&quot; Charlie reached down and gripped Liam&#39;s dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAGHHHHH!&quot; Liam roared. He couldn&#39;t control himself. His dick released in his shorts. He could feel the mess starting to run down his leg. &quot;Shit... No... I have to fight it... I have to get to a hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on Mr. Officer. Don&#39;t be a spoiler sport,&quot; Charlie cooed. &quot;Let&#39;s have a little bit of fun first...&quot; His fingers gently ran around Liam&#39;s body. Then he hopped out of his car and rushed around to open the door for Liam. &quot;Pleeeeeeease...&quot;<br />
<br />
Liam felt his dick harden again. &quot;Augh...&quot; he groaned. His body craved the attention. &quot;No... I need to fight it... I need to be strong...&quot; He stepped out of the car and tried to pull out his phone. One of his nails scratched the screen. &quot;Damn it!&quot; he gripped it in anger, completely crushing it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like someone needs a place to stay the night...&quot; Charlie was all over him again. He&#39;d climbed up on Liam&#39;s shoulders before the officer had even noticed. But at the same time Charlie&#39;s 90 pound body felt like nothing. That was simply because Liam kept getting bigger. His shoulders grew wider. Arms thicker. Muscle packed on top of muscle. Bodybuilders dreamed of his size. Powerlifters dreamed of his strength. <br />
<br />
&quot;No... Phone. Need phone...&quot; Liam tried to fight his animalistic urges. The calls of his strength were getting to be too much. He wanted to give in. Give into the power he had. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh poo... You really do have a one track mind Mr. Officer,&quot; Charlie grumbled. He hopped down off Liam&#39;s shoulders and strutted towards his front door, making sure to sway his booty and tail for Liam to see. &quot;There&#39;s a phone inside,&quot; Charlie opened his front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Phone... Need.... Phone...&quot; Liam tried to focus. But his attention had been clearly on the bright orange catboy strutting his stuff as he tried to focus on anything but. However, he went to the door. With each step, his animal side was coming further out. His teeth grew sharper. A snout pushed out from his nose, allowing those bigger teeth a place to go. Thick black claws tore through his shoes. The growing feet were finally given their room to breath as paw pads grew underneath them. <br />
<br />
Liam ducked under the door. His body twisted sideways to get inside. &quot;Such a big boy!&quot; Charlie marveled. &quot;Right this way.&quot; The catboy continued showing off his naked body with each step he took. His small lean frame still looked incredibly agile and flexible. He went down and opened the room on the left. &quot;Right this way,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
With a nod, Liam followed. He bumped into a few things and the wall, not realizing his new size. Everything was so small. So breakable. But he barely even noticed. He turned into the room. &quot;Ph--?&quot; Confusion overtook him. There was Charlie, asshole pointed to the air, tail swishing back and forth. <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon... Give in,&quot; Charlie swooned. A finger had already been messing with himself as he said it.<br />
<br />
Liam felt his nature take over. His hulking body leapt across the large room in a single bound. He placed one of his massive paws on the back of Charlie&#39;s neck and then used the other to position his dick. Pre was already leaking all over the soft pink hole. Charlie let out a squeal. &quot;Do it!&quot; he cried out. &quot;Please! I can&#39;t wait any longer!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Liam plunged in.</p>
