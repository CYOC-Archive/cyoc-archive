<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cassie&#39;s mom--Grace--was disappointed in her daughter&#39;s dwindling history grades. All Cassie ever did was study relentlessly for math and science and English; acing all of them. But she would never take history seriously. She always said it was &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;easy&quot;, and the more her mother insisted that she needs to start taking history more seriously, Cassie would double down on putting even less effort into it.<br />
<br />
This morning, Cassie&#39;s grade on a history test came up C-, the lowest grade she&#39;s ever gotten in anything. When confronted about this by her mom, she snapped at her, and said that history was &quot;a useless subject for old people&quot;, yelled at her to leave her room, and slammed the door.<br />
<br />
Having been a history major, Grace was more than a little offended. She had already talked with her husband about this; it&#39;s very possible that Cassie has some sort of aversion to the subject <i>because</i> her mom is so proficient in it. Nevertheless, she was very disappointed in her. But on top of that, she was angry with her, for so disrespectfully yelling at her like that.<br />
<br />
Little did Cassie know, however, the people of Grace&#39;s generation had a supernatural power at their disposal, called Just Desserts. If you have someone who has wronged you, or someone you are responsible for who hasn&#39;t been doing what you tell them, all you have to do is feed them a meal that contains only a dessert. If they eat it all, then you can announce any sort of punishment you desire on them, and they will be forced to comply with it.<br />
<br />
Knowing Cassie, it wasn&#39;t difficult to get her to eat a handful of chocolate-chip cookies for &quot;lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you don&#39;t think the past matters, hm?&quot; Grace said smirking as Cassie finished off the last cookie. &quot;Well how about you re-live a little piece of <i>your own past</i>, when you were still my little baby girl who never got mad at mommy.&quot; She said, grabbing a package of youth-sized diapers.<br />
<br />
Cassie only looked at her with stunned confusion, asking her where she got the diapers.<br />
<br />
&quot;At CVS sweetie, and you&#39;re going to be wearing them for a while.&quot; She took her daughter&#39;s hand, and guided her up to her bedroom.<br />
<br />
In character, Cassie would swipe her hand out of her mom&#39;s grip and resist absolutely everything that is happening, but the invisible influence of Just Desserts compelled her to go along with it, even though she didn&#39;t know why. She also didn&#39;t know why she complied with being lain down on her bed, having all of her clothes removed by her mother, having an adult diaper stretched out and laid beneath her bottom, having baby powder sprinkled onto her privates by her mother, having said powder <i>thoroughly rubbed into her privates</i> by her mother, having her mother tape the diaper closed, having her mother place a warm kiss on her cheek, and just sitting there, dumbfounded, as her mother left the room and gently closed the door.<br />
<br />
Cassie didn&#39;t even try to take off the diaper. She felt like she had become helpless to her mom somehow. All she knew was, she needed to phone up Rachel.<br />
<br />
When Rachel knocked on the door and was intercepted by Cassie&#39;s mother, Grace thought that it would be a great opportunity for Cassie to have a constructive conversation with a friend, about her troublesome history grades. She hurriedly let Rachel up to Cassie&#39;s room, and just stood there, waiting for what would happen.<br />
<br />
No discussion of history arose, however. Instead, some transformations happened, and now both of them found themselves smaller, prepubescent, and in soiled diapers.<br />
<br />
Before either of them could acclimate to this situation, Grace couldn&#39;t hold her curiosity back any longer, so she flew up the stairs to see what her daughter and her daughter&#39;s best friend were talking about. Instead, she saw two little girls. One of whom she didn&#39;t recognize, and the other one looked like Cassie when she was younger.<br />
<br />
Before she could get a word out, Rachel quickly spoke up,<br />
&quot;Hey mommy! Transform or dare??&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel cringed a little at her own sentence. She wanted to say &#39;Cassie&#39;s mom&#39;, but obviously, her own dare dictated that she act like a member of the family.<br />
<br />
&quot;...mommy? What?&quot; Grace asks, confused out of her mind. She kneels down and puts a hand on Rachel&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Sweetie what are you talking about? T-transform?&quot; She asked, not even grasping what the concept of &#39;transform&#39; entails.<br />
<br />
Little did she know, however, that by uttering the word--even in question form--she had made her selection, which was exactly the selection Rachel was hoping she&#39;d make.<br />
<br />
With a sigh of relief, Rachel put a hand over Grace&#39;s.<br />
&quot;Mom, I want you and dad to get seven-years-younger. Also dad will be making a bunch more money at his job. Like twice as much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace tried to interject, but was cut off.<br />
&quot;Also, you and dad and Nick will have different memories. I&#39;m Rachel, Cassie&#39;s friend, but now I&#39;m your daughter. Also, me and Cassie got shrank into little kids, AND we both wear diapers, because we didn&#39;t get potty-trained, and we won&#39;t ever. I want you to think of all of these changes as normal, okay? Also, the house will change to, like, fit this new reality and stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace was just staring into the girl&#39;s eyes, utterly dumbfounded.<br />
&quot;...OH and one more thing, I don&#39;t have to always act like Cassie&#39;s little sister if I don&#39;t want to.&quot; She said, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sweetie, you...&quot; Grace didn&#39;t know what to say, &quot;you... you need to g--&quot; the mother was cut off mid-sentence. She had been plunged into a light trance; the transformation had begun, and there were a lot of changes to make.<br />
<br />
She still had her hand on Rachel&#39;s shoulder, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha haaa!&quot; Rachel exclaimed, looking over at Cassie. &quot;Doesn&#39;t it kick-ass that older people don&#39;t know about Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie, taking a minute to absorb everything that just happened, took a second to reply.<br />
&quot;...uh, well, it&#39;s weird at least.&quot; She said, sitting down on her bed; immediately regretting doing so, however; she forgot that she had messed herself. &quot;Ack! Uh, but um, I dunno, why would only young people know about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One time, I heard that Transform or Dare didn&#39;t even exist until not too long ago!&quot; Rachel said, struggling to maintain her pose--as Grace continued to hold her hand on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa really?&quot; Cassie said, wincing as she forces herself to stand up, shuddering as she feels the mess she made falling a few centimeters down in her diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man! It wasn&#39;t invented until 2002!&quot; She insisted. &quot;I don&#39;t even think old people can use it at all. So even though I did it on your mom, or wait, I did it on OUR mom... she won&#39;t be able to do it back to us!&quot; She said excitedly.<br />
<br />
Neither of them aware that, given what mischief they&#39;ve been up to, Grace could very well pull Just Desserts on them were she to find out what they&#39;ve been doing. By all accounts, Just Desserts is an older manifestation of supernatural ability, known only by the previous generation. It doesn&#39;t have as much raw power as Transform or Dare (something like a full-body transformation is virtually unheard of by that group, which is why Grace didn&#39;t know how to react to the word), but it&#39;s purportedly much more balanced and stable. Whereas incidents of Transform or Dare are infamous for getting out-of-hand very quickly. <br />
<br />
&quot;you...&quot; Grace said, snapping out of her trance--and seven years younger, to boot. &quot;R-rachel!&quot; She exclaims, tightening her grip on the girl&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agh!&quot; Rachel yelps, surprised by the grip. &quot;Y-yes mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need a change, right now!&quot; She reaches her hand over and presses it up against Rachel&#39;s diapered crotch. &quot;Let&#39;s get you cleaned up, sweetie.&quot; She pats her new daughter on the shoulders, stands up and takes her hand and guides her to the newly-fabricated big-girl changing table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey mom!&quot; Cassie says, coming up behind them and tugging on her shirt--Cassie having to get used to being much shorter than her mother again. &quot;I need a change too! Reeeally badly!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda got my hands full, sweetie!&quot; Grace says while hoisting Rachel onto the table and assembling the supplies.<br />
&quot;Nathaniel just came over. You can have him change you.&quot; She explains as she opens up Rachel&#39;s diaper and makes quick work of wiping her.<br />
<br />
&quot;.......Nathaniel??&quot; Cassie asked, a lump in her throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhm. I&#39;ve got errands to run in a bit, so I called him over to babysit.&quot; Grace answers, her eyes dead-locked on Rachel&#39;s diaper area as she cleans it up with frighteningly efficiency. She had, after all, had six years to get fully acquainted with every square centimeter of Rachel&#39;s diaper area.<br />
<br />
Rachel, stunned by this speedy work, and having a hard time dealing with the very, very strange feelings she&#39;s feeling, was still able to tilt her head to the left to see Cassie, and giggle at her.<br />
<i>&quot;Haha.&quot;</i> She thought to herself. <i>&quot;Cassie&#39;s boyfriend turned into our babysitter? Oh man is she in for a world of humiliation. Heheh. Good thing I was single.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Head on down, sweetie.&quot; Their mom said as she took one last &#39;general&#39; wipe to Rachel&#39;s privates. &quot;We don&#39;t want you getting a rash.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie swallowed a gulp.<br />
&quot;Okay mom.&quot; She sighed, and headed for the door.<br />
<br />
Before she left, however, she remembered that she isn&#39;t wearing a top. So she went over to her dresser--now conveniently smaller--and looked around for a shirt--all of which were smaller as well. She picked out a normal looking T-shirt that had a pretty cute shade of green, slipped it on, and then headed out the door and down the stairs.<br />
<br />
Down in the living room, predictably, was Cassie&#39;s eight-year-old brother, Nicholas. Cassie had the good fortune of still being the older sister, but now, not by a lot.<br />
<br />
Nicholas stands up from the couch and walks up to her.<br />
&quot;Hey Cass.&quot; He holds his thumb in his belt-loop.<br />
<br />
Immediately, Cassie noticed something was different about him. First of all, the fact that he didn&#39;t react to her wearing a diaper without pants, and smelling of dirty diaper, <b>let alone</b> for her suddenly being ten years old. Clearly, the transformation had had its way with his memories as well.<br />
<br />
But even beyond that, his demeanor felt different. He seemed more confident; more astute. He&#39;d always been a wannabe-cool-kid type, who would, for example, hold his thumb in his belt-loop to look badass. And he still acted like that, but he was doing it with so much more confidence this time.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;I guess it&#39;s just because Nick now has a little sister, and his older sister isn&#39;t like an adult compared to him, so he doesn&#39;t feel as small as he did before we transformed everything.</i> Cassie thought to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;...hey Nick.&quot; Cassie answered, waving her hand. &quot;I made a dump in my diaper, and then I forgot and sat in it.&quot; She rolls her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; He says, taking his hand out of his belt-loop and onto his big sister&#39;s palm. He guides her through the living room. &quot;Nathaniel just got here, so I&#39;ll take you to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie blushes as she is carted around by her brother like this, but she doesn&#39;t have much choice but to go along with his gesture. She&#39;s a bit nervous as to what&#39;s going to happen when she sees her boyfriend in this state.<br />
<br />
They enter the kitchen, where Nathaniel is sitting on a stool, eating a hot dog.<br />
&quot;Mm!&quot; He mumbles, frantically swallowing his bite and putting the dog down, and standing up. &quot;Hey!!&quot; He exclaims, and says...</p>
