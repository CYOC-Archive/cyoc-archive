<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Danielle sat and wondered about what to do with the Pen, she recalled what she and Ashlee had spoken about earlier, and an idea came to mind.  It had worked once before, so it should work again.  Getting a blank sheet ready, she wrote on it:  <br />
<br />
‘Do you, the Pen, have a desire to be used?’  <br />
<br />
‘Yes.’  The answer showed up beneath her written question.  Now she had an idea of what was going on with her increasing desires to use it when she held it.  <br />
<br />
‘Are you trying to compel whoever holds you into using you?’  She wrote down beneath the answer, though she was certain as to what the answer would be.  <br />
<br />
‘Yes.’  She was right.  <br />
<br />
‘Why?’  <br />
<br />
‘If I have a fear, it’s to not be used.’  <br />
<br />
‘So you’re trying to compel whoever holds you into using you, so you can escape this fear then.’  <br />
<br />
‘I am.’  <br />
<br />
This was something to take in.  This Pen, had a mind of sorts of its own, and was wanting to be used, to fulfil purpose?  So it stood to reason that the longer it went without usage, the more it would try to be used.  <br />
<br />
Even now she was feeling a want, a need, to use it and do something with it.  Thinking her options over, she began to wonder how to do it, something small, safe, yet able to aid in holding back on overuse of the Pen.  Acting on a hunch, she wrote down:  <br />
<br />
‘If I used the Pen, but set a delay on the activation of what is written down, then what would happen?  And how would it affect your desire to be used?’  <br />
<br />
Some moments later, she got her answer:  <br />
<br />
‘In such an event, the event to occur would do so at the determined time.  My own desire for use would be affected by the magnitude of the event desired.’  <br />
<br />
With this information at hand, Danielle leaned back and debated the matter in her head.  So if she wanted to suppress the Pen’s desire for usage, if only for a time, she needed to do something substantial with it, but what?  Knowing that less than half the office workers had been transformed by the Pen gave her an obvious answer, but really, she had other ideas.  And as she thought about it, she started to feel uncomfortable, perhaps, her being nude for a while meant she needed to get used to clothes again?  Whatever the reason, she felt better once she pulled her sweater over her shoulders and tossed it to the side, her free breasts bouncing slightly as she did so.  <br />
<br />
More minutes passed, and Danielle, following her small act which helped, made up her mind, on a fresh sheet, she began the lengthy process of writing down a major event for the coming Monday:  <br />
<br />
‘Tomorrow, all who have been transformed into human-animal hybrids by the Pen who work in this office will arrive fully dressed.  Over the course of the day, they will all slowly strip themselves down so that by the beginning of the lunch break half their clothes will have been taken off, with full nudity attained in the fifteen minutes before the end of the working day.  <br />
<br />
The exceptions to this will be Jenny and Joe, who will begin wearing nothing from the waist down, and become fully naked by the middle of the lunch break.  <br />
<br />
The next exception is Amanda, who will be dressed as follows:  <br />
<br />
Full body stocking<br />
The heels she currently wears<br />
Business jacket and trousers<br />
V-neck sweater<br />
The wrist bangles she currently wears<br />
<br />
She will remove her sweater first, followed by her jacket, then her trousers by the start of the lunch break, after which she’ll tears holes in her body stocking to open up her crotch area and breasts, tearing more off so that at the end of the workday, what she has left on will be the heels, bangles and the remains of the body stocking that end above the knees.  <br />
<br />
I am also exempt from the need to remove my clothes, able to do so entirely by choice.  While the use of underwear and bras by those not placed on the exemption clauses is entirely optional.’  <br />
<br />
Satisfied that what she had planned would be enough to keep the need for further use at bay, if only for a little while.  True, there was a good deal she’d know about in advance of the events, but enough kept off so that there could still be a surprise or two waiting for her.  <br />
<br />
In fact, thinking about it, there would be a meeting on that day she’d be required to attend, but she couldn’t remember if it was in the morning or afternoon.  <br />
<br />
“I’ll find out tomorrow.”  She told herself as she folded up the two sheets she’d written on, placing them securely in her handbag where they’d stay.  <br />
<br />
Getting back to her work, she wondered about what she’d do tomorrow, when she fully expected Ashlee to hold the Pen for that day.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
“So how was work today?”  Ashlee asked once she was home.  <br />
<br />
“Went well enough.  It’s all done until tomorrow.”  Danielle replied cheerfully, her sweater back on for the drive home.  <br />
<br />
“So?  Did you use it?  The Pen?”  <br />
<br />
“Right here.  Got some answers too.”  Danielle handed her the first sheet.  <br />
<br />
Ashlee read it over, twice, realisation setting in.  “So it really is forcing use to use it?”  <br />
<br />
“Yeah.  I ended up doing that, took a while to think up one that was tame enough to avoid problems, but still able to keep the need for using it in check.  If only for a time.”  Danielle admitted as she handed over the other one.  <br />
<br />
“Seriously?  This is your idea of restraint?”  Ashlee accused her.  <br />
<br />
“Like I said, it had to be something that could keep the Pen’s desire to be used in check, but also small enough in scale as to sidestep any serious issues that might arise from it.”  Danielle shot back.  “And in any case, weren’t you being pretty eager to use it only yesterday?”  <br />
<br />
It hurt, but it had to be done.  To remind Ashlee that just holding it was enough for the desire to use the Pen to grow within both her and herself.  <br />
<br />
“Besides.  There is one other reason.”  Danielle added to console her.  “If my hunch is right, this one might be enough so that you won’t feel a need to use the Pen.”  <br />
<br />
“And if you’re wrong?”  <br />
<br />
“Then you will.  And in any case, remember when I said we could rotate days?”  <br />
<br />
“Yes?  The Pen?”  <br />
<br />
“Exactly, so tomorrow, you’ll be holding it, then me on the Tuesday, you on the Wednesday, and so on.”  Danielle explained as Ashlee thought about it.  <br />
<br />
“Actually, that might be a good idea.”  She agreed.  “So I expect it tomorrow.”  <br />
<br />
“You get it then.  For now, there’s the rest of the day.”  Danielle said as she got her jeans off.</p>
