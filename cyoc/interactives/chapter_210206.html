<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark started quickly. “Okay, let´s start, then. Aidan, your hands will become hooves. After that, you will grow out a long, bushy cat´s tail, followed by a set of wings fitting an angel.”<br />
Aidan looked not happy, but he felt a tingle in his hands before he could say anything. His fingers curled inwards, making it seem as if he had made fists out of his hands. Slowly, the individual fingers connected to each other, and finally merged into a single blob of flesh at the end of his arms. Next, the end flattened inwards, building a surface that looked like you had cut of its end. Said flat surface started to harden out, which to Aidan felt like they were drying out, adding a light burning feeling. Both watched Aidan´s now hooved hands, useless to do anything with but walk on.<br />
“Was that necessary? Robbing me of my fingers?” Aidan asked annoyed. It would just be his luck if he soon would feel an itch he couldn´t scratch with his now hooves.<br />
Before Mark said anything, the second change started, and with that Aidan´s loss of hands would be rather bad. It was a sudden pressure building above his ass, pushing hard against Aidan´s underwear and jeans, but he had no way to remove them now. Mark only realized his error when Aidan started howling in a sudden pain. He jumped up and quickly opened Aidan´s belt before helping to pull both the jeans and the underwear downwards, freeing the mass of flesh that grew behind Aidan.<br />
Aidan had stopped howling, but turned beet red as he remembered his earlier change, now in clear view for Mark. Meanwhile, the tail grew longer behind Aidan, until the tip could easily hit Aidan´s nose while going over the top of his head. A light tingle went through the whole new limb, and, starting from the base, grew bushy, ginger-colored fur. Soon, the tail swished behind Aidan, as he had unknowingly gained an understanding how to move this new limb.<br />
“Sorry, Aidan. I haven´t thought this through. I should have let you strip before I changed your hands, or at least helped you before I let you grew a tail. At least you aren´t wearing anything blocking your wings, now.” Mark said, not even laughing about Aidan´s earlier misfortune. He could ask later about that. “I should have changed your feet instead of your hands.”<br />
Aidan rolled his eyes at Mark´s insight, but didn´t comment for now. Like with the tail before, the wings just pushed out of his back, only they weren´t met by resistance. A small pain, like the tail, when his flesh was pushed, but then it was just a growing weight on his back. It was enough to push him forward, being not really expected, and Aidan´s new hooves clacked on the ground as he brought them forward to stop his sudden fall. At least, it didn´t hurt. <br />
The growing behind him expanded further, building up a set of muscular, but naked wings, reaching from around the middle of his head down to his knees. This time, instead of a tingle, it was a bit more of a pricking feeling, as feathers pushed through his skin, quickly covering up everything on his new wings. Aidan tested beating them, as he had gained an understanding for them like he had for his tail, and felt the power behind them. If he would repeat that motion a few times, he was sure to lift off the ground.<br />
With his intended changes finished, Aidan slowly pushed his hooves down, attempting to get back up. It took a few tries, but he got up, and staggered backwards a few steps until he got a grip on his wings. “That is so odd. I knew how to work with the wings and the tail, but can´t really grip the weight of them with my mind.” Aidan mentioned.<br />
Mark smiled a bit. “It´s not like you will have to get used to them, except you want them back later after you change back, right? Now, how did that all feel, beside your tail getting limited by your jeans?”<br />
Aidan took a few seconds more to answer: “Well, both the hooves and the fur on the tail tingled, while the feathers pricked. There was little pain, mostly when it had to push outwards from my back. The hooves were a bit more painful, as it felt like they burned and dried out, but not too much. And when I fell on them, I felt no pain from catching myself, so there was no damage to them. But I still can feel the ground beneath them.”<br />
Mark grinned now. “Good. While I have no problem with someone being in pain, I didn´t want you to be feeling it now. I don´t want you screaming yourself hoarse or being sore all over after we have finished, after all.” Then, with another look at Aidan´s body, he asked: “Have you always been this small down there? Or was that a mistake?”<br />
Aidan again turned bright red, but answered anyway: “A mistake. I wanted to use the program to enhance my cock, but had the wrong measurements chosen. And the program warned me about changing something to quickly again, so I didn´t correct that before you came here.”<br />
Mark had much resistance to not just laugh loudly at that, but a few chuckles escaped him anyway. “Is that why you wanted to try the text input next? To be sure to not make another mistake?” Aidan just nodded.<br />
After another minute or two, Mark spoke up again: “Okay, that would be growing body parts, as well as fur and feathers, and reforming an existing part into that of an animal. Let´s see. Aidan, your cat-tail will drop off your body first. Second, your feet will merge together and change into a tire, while from your ankles will grow something resembling a stand, so you will still be able to stand upwards. And third, your chest will get covered in scales.”<br />
Aidan again looked not happy about these changes. While he, too, wanted to test a few things, he hadn´t wanted to do so on himself. “Really, a tire? And why scales?”<br />
But he got no answer, as the changes had already started. He hadn´t felt it, but the tail had just dropped off, as if never being a part of him. It hit the ground, slightly wriggling, but Aidan had no connection to it anymore. Even the little knowledge he had gained of how to control it, had slipped his mind again, unnoticed.<br />
Aidan only took notice of it laying on the ground when he looked down at his feet, as they disrupted his standing still. His soles bend inwards, and touched each other. With the same tingling feeling as his hands had changed, his feet merged together along the soles, from heel up to his toes. He nearly toppled forward when his now merged feet ballooned outwards while rounding, turning into a car´s tire between his ankles. While the inside hardened out, feeling like lightly burning like his hooves had, the outside turned more flexible and bouncier, becoming the rubber that would “feel” the ground.<br />
Aidan would have fallen by the time his tire had completely formed, as standing on the tire alone would have been too hard for him, but from his ankles had already formed to thick stick like extensions, leaving him with a way to stand with the tire minimally raised above the ground. They felt like his feet had before, only hard like the hooves, giving him extra stability. <br />
The growing scales along Aidan´s chest went nearly unnoticed again, as all he felt was his skin turn dry and, well, scaly. Maybe light itch, but nothing painful.<br />
Aidan used a minute or so to play with his tire, as he had control over its rotation speed, and just for a second raised his stands up, letting him nearly run over Mark, saved only by the “keep distance” comment before, and into the wall next to his bedroom door, if he hadn´t thought about to stop it, what activated a brake in his tire and pulling his stands back out. “Wow, that was extreme.” Aidan said shocked.<br />
Mark, himself, had smiled at Aidan playing with his tire, but had nearly jumped to the side when Aidan suddenly drove forward towards him before going of course. “You nearly gave me a heart attack with that move, Aidan. Maybe you shouldn´t have rotated your tire that fast, huh? How do you feel?”<br />
“I´m surprisingly okay with the tire, maybe I could later try being a human motor bike or something like that” Aidan explained grinning, before he explained his feelings through the changes. “I felt nothing when the tail dropped off, and the scales was just drying and maybe a light itch. As for my feet, they tingled while merging, and I felt bloated in them as they extended outwards, while the light burning was a part of the center hardening. The rubber itself can feel the ground like the hooves can, only with less grip of it, as it is too fast. And the stands feel like they´re a second set of hooves, hard and feeling like them.”<br />
Mark nodded to all of that, collecting Aidan´s dropped of tail from where he had stood before. It still wriggled for itself, but Aidan said nothing as Mark touched it, or even as he pinched it, returning back to the laptop with it. “Okay, that would be “dropping” an extra body part, growing scales and having an inanimate object as a body part. Let´s see what else we can try out, then.” Mark said, checking his mental list of things he wanted to try out.</p>
