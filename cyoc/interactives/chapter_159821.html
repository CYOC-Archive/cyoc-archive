<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ah Spirit or Spirits, would you answer a question,&quot; Ted as Teddy the then male goat wanted to ask a question.<br />
<br />
The spirit replied only to Ted, as it sounded harsh when it rather quickly agreed to offer answers. The spirit was an it my nature, neither male or female, as devils in their original forms remain as spirits. Ted asked if the spirits working for Dave were doing his bidding often, changing  various people into animal embodiments. <br />
<br />
At the first the spirit reacted as if it thought Ted was being funny. &quot;I or as on occasion we, do the dealing with Dave when he chides a person or friend in a dare to touch one of those previously transformed. He has brought to us several people since a lucky charm arrived into this country. I mostly contrived the plan for Dave to sell his soul, or trade it for the erotic desire he asked for in return. Before this farm became as his to own, your friend raised me from the pit. <br />
<br />
Dave made me laugh when he tried to explain his erotic desire as done to him and his body. A three year contract is the way he had me agree to do his bidding, as I did agree. Your friend is bold about what he wanted, as his great wish was to become animalistic of form. He disliked having to shave or wash each morning. Dave wanted his three years of fun and frolic of being alone, or at the need merged with a host animal mindset. He, Dave requested his entire body as merged, but desired his mentality to remain alert, he knowing his past and of the present. He wanted to see, retaining his vision while able to taste and know extreme sensuality.<br />
<br />
Your damning friend did to you an easy transformation. As of what Dave wanted to become was of a human as merged into the male member, the scrotum, sheath, and cock of a donkey.<br />
<br />
A donkey cock, Dave wanted to live three years of his life being the male penis of a domesticated Jack donkey. He had a photo from the internet, showing a long, as black cock with a trumpet-bell shaped head. He directed where to place his eyes at the groin level to the sheath. As much he wished to see where his cock body would be going, he requested the pissing hole to have in it a long tongue. Dave would taste then the daily urine expulsions, and masturbated ejaculation of precum or semen. His tongue he requested would own the ability of protruding outside the cock face the reached distance of seven inches. The tongue as controlled by Dave being a donkey cock could then delve inside a jennet donkey vagina and accentuate the sex act by him licking the vaginal walls, tickling the female, and tasting her juices to help better arouse and keep his male donkey host as sexually enthused. <br />
<br />
Dave lived a very erotic lifestyle for the three years he was a donkey&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
I personally approached Dave after his three year term ended, and expected that he after such a sensual period would have lost all his mentality, making it easy for me to let him stay then as a donkey cock. <br />
<br />
To my surprise, Dave was still himself, as his donkey host gained a wealth of knowledge from the merged-joining. As Dave requested his becoming human again, after living in an erotic lifestyle, his leaving caused the donkey host to bray as if he were sad Dave was leaving.<br />
<br />
Since that fated day, your friend Dave has enjoyed great good luck through a shrewd deal, he given to meet Matthew Janson, the previous owner of this farm. Matt liked to gamble and play cards, Dave had insite through me and he won the farm from Matt. It was from my suggestion that Dave make Matt an offer of managing the farm, residing in the farmhouse, and both Matt and Dave split the profits.<br />
<br />
Dave coaxed Matt to learn how to play Matador tag with his herd bull. A curse was supplied and after the third time that Matt wearied the bull, he, Matt commented that his bull lived a charmed life. A day later and Boris the bull had a merged entity residing with him inside his lusty bull body. Matt accepted my transfer of him into Boris, as the man had many erotic desires about bulls, and the two lived together well; Dave sold Boris to a local farm for being their herd sire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted was amazed from hearing how Dave got to owning the farm and of his direct dealing with a devil from Hell.<br />
<br />
The devil conveyed to Ted that the original curse could do far more to a person, as had changed for Dave a young woman to be a stallion horse, a manly salesman fellow to become a jennet-mule, and five Gas company workers to being as well all Mules. The spirit reiterated it&#39;s of pride in transforming of a couple of girlfriends acting as overly interested in Dave, as he suggested they could best serve his needs if by some magic, they became as female Greek satyrs. <br />
<br />
His sex slaving satyr women fought for their right to be first with Dave, and he became weary of them, as requested I finish changing them into being human-minded, still intelligent, Kiko breed goats; they then would remain being such animals for the rest of their human length of lives.<br />
<br />
Then too there was another man who met the two women satyrs, was molested by them, the evil spirit endowed the man with becoming as well a Kiko breed herd-sire buck goat to keep his girlfriends as satisfied.<br />
<br />
Ted having heard of the history about Dave and the curse, asked then if because he was reverent to the powerful spirit, would it grant him some physical as different attributes, but not change him from being a hearty big buck?<br />
<br />
The devil seemed taken and did not respond so quickly, as though it were searching how to answer Ted. As after what to a buck goat seemed near to eternity, the spirit replied in the affirmative, it asking nicely of Ted to expound his idea.<br />
<br />
Ted then took a moment to consider how best to wording his request, and then asked with a considerate manner told of his thought. Ted asked of the spirit if for the reason of he had to remain as being, living as would a buck goat, could he please be given the ability to speak on occasions, like verbally? <br />
<br />
As before the spirit offered its answer, Ted added a supplement thought, that of if he were able to talk, he could coax others doomed as well like him to be as goats, as how best to accept what was their permanent future. Then too, of those who came to the farm and might pet the goats, he would listen to what they said, and if someone were to wish to become a goat, he then could talk, as coax them to ask Dave to fulfill their wild desire.<br />
<br />
The Spirit said nothing as if it were considering Ted&#39;s offer.</p>
