<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The receptionist led him into the room, which except for the pool and waterfall seemed empty. A small alcove to the right was likely where the masseuse was taking a moment to herself he figured between giving Sharon and him their requested treatments. John had been lucky to meet Sharon after the death of his first wife, the mother of his daughter. She was almost the same age as his daughter, only a few years older, but the spark had been undeniable. As their whirlwind romance, marriage, and now new son awaiting to be born were all proof of. All of these thoughts and memories were of course just writing themselves as part of the magic of the spa in an attempt to make sense of Derrick&#39;s return to the womb and Sharon&#39;s regression to accept him. They however wouldn&#39;t remain for long.<br />
<br />
Hebe entered from her alcove and stopped to take a look over John. Very clearly he was the father of the young man she&#39;d just returned to his mother. Good thing, because otherwise she&#39;d have had to have had the hotel offer him a free treatment in order to entice him down here so she could fix the situation Derrick&#39;s regression to the womb had caused. She&#39;d still have to do that to Derrick&#39;s sister, but the fact that John was here, ready and eager to be regressed and resume his role as father to that young man, made things much easier for Hebe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please take off your robe, sir, my treatment only works if you&#39;re <i>au natural</i>,&quot; she said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
John, a bit ashamed and uncomfortable showing his aging middle-aged body, disrobed somewhat hesitantly. He&#39;d acquired a bit more pudge than he&#39;d wanted around his belly, and his hair was a bit thinner on the top than he liked. Truth be told he&#39;d love to return to his prime.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax and lay down in the pool, and we&#39;ll begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
John did as he was told, finding the water warm, not cool like he&#39;d feared. Warm enough to lie down in and close his eyes and begin to think of his life. His middle management position at a corporation--overworked and underpaid, but tempered with a young, enthusiastic wife who he often felt too tired and old to keep up with.<br />
<br />
Hebe began her work, starting with his semi-erect penis, rubbing years away into the mud and revitalizing it until it was a firm rod ready for his young wife. She would give Sharon an ideal young lover.<br />
<br />
As she did, John&#39;s memories of often having to recover between rounds of sex with Sharon began to fade. He still felt like he could keep up with Sharon, it was part of the headiness of their union.<br />
<br />
Next Hebe worked up onto John&#39;s slightly pudgy belly. She began to push and kneed his lower abdomen like a sculptor with clay, pushing his bulk inward and reforming the fat into young healthy muscles, leaving John with not a six pack but as close as a man could come without having one. She then worked her way around his hips and cupping his butt, shrinking it in size until it too was firm and taught with the years of age and bulk dissipating into mud that fell away with the rush of the water. She next thinned his thighs and legs, swelling his calves to a youthful prime of any young athlete. She broadened his feet a tad as she youthened him, to make ready for supporting his new musculature. <br />
<br />
At this point John looked almost ridiculous with a young lower body and middle-aged older body, and his mind was quickly trying to justify how a rigid dedication to time spent at the gym had helped him to preserve his powerful lower body.<br />
<br />
Hebe moved up and over his chest, rearranging his slightly flabby chest into two powerful pectoral muscles, and stretched his shoulders an inch each apart. Then she worked down John&#39;s arms, refreshing flab into muscle, and smoothing away veins and skin down to his fingertips, the mud flushed away from his body. All that was left was his neck and head. For that Hebe lowered herself into the water and cupped his head in her lap. She massaged his neck, strengthening its sinews and altering John&#39;s voice slightly from a brassy baritone to a tender tenor. Then came his face as wrinkles and worry lines were smoothed over, his jaw rounded slightly and the grey around his ears turned dark once again as his head of hair was made full and then fuller than it had been the first time he&#39;d been young.<br />
<br />
As she finished the initial transformation, John&#39;s thoughts began to consider how he&#39;d just graduated college a year or two ago, and married his college sweetheart, Sharon. He&#39;d found a job with a company and was looking good for a potential promotion soon, which was good since Sharon and he were expecting their first child, and his younger sister was now staying with them while she finished High School and prepared to go to college.<br />
<br />
Hebe admired her work, but still felt something was missing, and then she began to rub again, this time only taking off a few years with her rubbing instead of years and reforming his body.<br />
<br />
As she massaged him for the final time, John&#39;s thoughts of being a college graduate faded as his muscles diminished ever so slightly as he youthened instead to a young man just beginning college. He lacked the bulk of a full grown man, and still had much the lean figure of a boy. Sharon had been his baby sitter when he&#39;d been younger and when he&#39;d gotten old enough had introduced him to the pleasures of an older woman. Not that she&#39;d been too much older than him, but he&#39;d found her maturity something attractive that had made him awkward and reluctant to interact with girls more his own age. When he&#39;d graduated high school, they&#39;d married and now as he was just starting college they were expecting their first child. He was always ready and eager to please Sharon.<br />
<br />
Hebe looked down at the lean but athletic young man of eighteen on the cusp of young adulthood before her and thought...</p>
