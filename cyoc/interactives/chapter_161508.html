<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He heard a knock on the door, followed by its quick swing open - and Jeff’s 21-year old brother, Julian, entered the room.<br />
<br />
“Hey, homo. What’s shakin’? Oh… wow, smelling good in here.”<br />
<br />
Like Jeff, Julian had been doubly blessed at birth. His father, too. It was a rather deep-seeded genetic defect that went back several generations in the family. But, in his eyes, calling it a ‘defect’ was a misnomer. It was relatively harmless, after all. Julian had a handful of years on him, and his dicks were at least one or two inches longer than his, so he always saw Julian as something to aspire to - aside from his macho personality. He was rather well-built for his age, too; he could’ve easily been a model. It left some opportunity for future growth, but Jeff was slightly jealous that his brother was multiple steps ahead in the race.<br />
<br />
And because the testosterone was so regularly flowing between them, they never sat back from discussing their equipment, or sex, or really anything that involved the matter. Julian could be seen as a horned-up college kid with serious bravado. Sometimes Jeff got hardons just from Julian being nearby, which was a residual downside to having twice the cock hanging around. In fact, it was happening now, and Jeff had to improvise with some clever seat-shifting. People interpreted a lot of their behavior together as homosexual, but it was all in good jest. <br />
<br />
“Yeah yeah yeah,” Jeff remarked, “I’ve smelt your room too. It’s not exactly flowers in there.”<br />
<br />
Julian giggled. “Daily exercise. What can I say? Anyway, are you busy?”<br />
<br />
“A bit. I’m messing with a computer program.” Meanwhile, the Chronivac had been scanning Julian into the system, as he was now in range.<br />
<br />
“‘Kay. We could use an extra set of hands outside. Finish up soon or I’ll tell Dad you’re too busy jacking off up here.”<br />
<br />
Jeff rolled his eyes. “Gotcha.”<br />
<br />
“Get it? ‘Cuz you’d have no arms left!”<br />
<br />
Julian left the room, leaving the door open. He maximized the 3D model on the screen. It was still the model of Jeff, but now Julian’s name appeared next to it as another ‘tab’ on the top of the interface. He clicked it, and although there was no preview, the immaculate detail about Julian with the same options as before were there. He could add or change any feature on his profile that he wanted. What would he do with a model of his brother?<br />
<br />
The humor between them was unhinged. And he was feeling mischievous… an extra set of hands… take a bite of Julian’s cake and eat it, too? What would his model look like if he added another set of arms to it? <br />
<br />
Targets Name: Julian<br />
Feature: +2 arms<br />
Morphing duration: ((0:05))<br />
Pleasurable: ((Y))/N<br />
Alter Reality: Y/N<br />
Aware: Y/((N))<br />
<br />
The process of adding two new arms allowed him to define some settings, including increasing the muscle weight and hairiness of the arms. He also left on the custom option to add a second pair of pectoral muscles - he wanted to know what that would look like. The other options in parentheses were highlighted as the default choices. Jeff increased the time a bit, to 30 seconds, so he could push the testing of framing the animation. <br />
<br />
With no set default, the program was forcing him to set this ‘Alter Reality’ setting. He clicked N, assuming that the model should exist in its own space and to not distract from the image itself.<br />
<br />
He clicked the Next button. The screen asked him to confirm the settings, and with no reasonable need to hesitate, he clicked Submit.<br />
<br />
**Process Initiated...<br />
<br />
<br />
As Jeff sat there, waiting for the render to complete, his mind began to wander around the room. His closet, especially, was rather messy... <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Julian had been rummaging through the fridge, putting back a carton of orange juice, when he felt compelled to rotate his shoulders a bit. Mmm, yeah, that felt good, he thought - maybe he was a bit sore from last night’s workout. He didn’t notice his white t-shirt tearing open, however, with two horizontal columns of limb pushing out beneath his armpits.<br />
<br />
The fleshy columns grew in size, becoming more visible with each passing second, but still Julian noticed nothing. He finished off the glass of juice and walked back down the hall toward the sliding doors to the backyard. Their sister was wandering around when she turned and saw Julian’s silhouette. She did a double-take: was she seeing things? It looked like Julian had four arms!<br />
<br />
He pulled the door open and stepped out into the southern sun. The added warmth gave him instant goosebumps. He stretched out a bit, which helped loosen up whatever tightness he was feeling in his lower triceps. It was maybe a lack of equal use; he could only do two arms at a time, and he preferred the upper ones for work like this.<br />
<br />
Their father was squatted at the western edge of the yard, taking some kind of measurement with the measuring tape. Julian had run out of paint, which was why he had taken off to grab Jeff. He walked over to his father to fetch another pail.<br />
<br />
It had been nearly 30 seconds. His lower hands snapped into place, and he absentmindedly stretched each finger out as he approached his father. He heard him coming, so he looked up...<br />
<br />
“Jeff’ll be down in a bit. Can I use this can over there?” Julian thumbed.<br />
<br />
His father’s eyes were wide.<br />
<br />
~~~~~<br />
<br />
**Process Complete.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jeff briefly saw an image, which was undeniably Julian. He looked certainly like some Athenian god. It was… it was hot...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Save Progress? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
He clicked Y, and this time, the message &quot;Aware not set to progression by default. Set Alter Reality to progression? Y/N” appeared.<br />
<br />
Clearly, the reality of the model was as perfect as it could be. In fact, it was making Jeff’s twin dicks hard for the third time in five minutes. He knew it was wrong, and it was affecting his concentration. At least Julian wasn’t still here...<br />
<br />
~~~~~<br />
<br />
“What the hell, Jules. Take that suit off, you look stupid,” his father grunted.<br />
<br />
“...Suit?”<br />
<br />
<br />
“The arms!” he said, pointing at Julian’s limbs.<br />
<br />
“What about them, Dad…”<br />
<br />
“... They look... real?”<br />
<br />
“...”<br />
<br />
The men stared at each other, dumbfounded. What was each other’s problem?<br />
<br />
~~~~~<br />
<br />
The truth of the matter was that Jeff didn’t care about setting an Alter Reality setting. What the hell did that mean? The model render was complete and saved to file; he had seen it for a moment before these windows popped up. He had work to do outside. Anddddd he was horny! Why was it asking so many questions? Just go away! <br />
<br />
Instead of clicking Y or N, he clicked the X button on the window.<br />
<br />
Doing this flashed the message: “Are you sure you want to Cancel Process? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
“What??” Jeff whined. He clicked No right away.<br />
<br />
“ERROR 262834; reality progression cannot be set to < null > . Repair?”<br />
<br />
He was losing interest in the whole operation. For being such a cool program, it sure was laden with software bugs and stupid workflows. He contemplated searching the web for answers to this error, but he only had one option: repair. Did he wait till later to come back to this, or just go ahead and let it try to fix itself? <br />
<br />
He might as well; he didn’t have the time today to mess with this for much longer. He clicked OK.<br />
<br />
“Repair initiated...  Reprocessing changes...“<br />
<br />
And for a brief period of time, nothing more than maybe five seconds, Jeff could’ve sworn he had felt a great rush of energy; an invigorating energy wash over his entire body. The pleasure was completely beyond human comprehension. He only remembered looking around the room with intense fervor, before looking down and--<br />
<br />
--FLASH--<br />
<br />
“Repair complete.” The windows closed.<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked. <br />
<br />
The room darkened a bit as the sun ducked behind the midday clouds. Jeff’s computer screen was left as the brightest thing in his room, and in the center of the monitor? Wow… that 3D model certainly was Julian! <br />
<br />
It was all of Julian. <br />
<br />
He struggled to remember how or what had been done to create it. Again he recalled lots of text and windows and menus, and now this 3D image. It certainly was cool to... stare at… and think about...<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his mind from it; he had to will his dicks down and go help outside. The middle one was always the worst because of its location; the left and right ones needed to cooperate before he could move forward. Nevertheless, he was adequately aware of the visible bulges his three packages caused. Despite what others may have thought, he had immense pride in being &quot;different&quot;. <br />
<br />
He closed the Chronivac. Turning to his messy closet, he stumbled on over and found a hoodie, got his two left arms tangled in the process of finding the sleeves (as per usual), and walked out of the room when he felt fully calmed and ready.<br />
<br />
~~~~~<br />
<br />
“Julian?”<br />
<br />
He looked back down to his father, who was staring at his son blankly, having shaken off a bit of unexplained jitters.<br />
<br />
“*ahem* Uh, go ahead and take it along with the paintbrushes. ‘Got my own. Give one of those to Jeff. Do you need something to open the can?”<br />
<br />
“Oh... Yeah,” he said, as he tossed him a screwdriver. Julian caught it with one of his left hands. “Thanks.”<br />
<br />
He gripped the pail handle with his lowest left hand and grabbed a couple paintbrushes with his middle left, and took that moment to stretch his right hands. <br />
<br />
‘What a bizarre few seconds that was… but man, what a beautiful day! Why couldn’t he be out tanning on the beach instead?’ he thought. Maybe he should take off his shirt…</p>
