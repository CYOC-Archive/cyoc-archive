<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She knew that she should have paid more heed to the man in the coffee shop.<br />
<br />
Sure, it had been a hard and long day at work for her - construction work even as a mutant with beneficial special abilities was hard - but she knew that wasn&#39;t much of an excuse.  Her mind wasn&#39;t sharp because she couldn&#39;t take it off her coworker&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
She had forgotten to take her pills for her stupid libido boost earlier in the day.<br />
<br />
All Allen could do was think to herself - she was blind, deaf, near-immobile, and irritatingly hopeless, having none of the other 5 senses but touch.  She couldn&#39;t even breathe now, but was still alive because she had NBM abilities.<br />
<br />
And such abilities were the reason why she was targeted in the first place.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t allowed to use Natural Body Magic very much during her work due to safety issues (imagine a random limb lying around or being dropped, falling, and breaking something) but always used it to help herself, friends, or family out at things, (pulling off her arm and holding it with her other arm could extend her reach by about 2 feet) and sometimes to show off and have fun (often with herself . . .).<br />
<br />
Some of Allen&#39;s favorite tricks were switching her hands with her feet, her legs and her arms, her eyes for her nipples, her mouth for any one of her genitals, and placing her head on her ass.<br />
And like most mutants with NBM abilities - it was easy to do.  A firm tug would detach any body part that could then be pasted seamlessly onto any part of her body.  It would take an extremely hard impact to entirely disassemble her.<br />
<br />
Considering the feel of rubber or latex gloves on her face and the familiar feel of the sort of blanket commonly used in hospitals, Allen hoped that these were signs that she was in a hospital.<br />
<br />
Or at least, most of her, or her body.<br />
<br />
She had stopped trying to squirm with her jaw muscles (not that she had her mouth anymore) and what was left of her neck muscles a while ago and had accepted that her head was, hopefully, in good hands.<br />
<br />
Mentally groaning, Allen knew that she would probably wouldn&#39;t been targeted if she was still male.  Transformed, she was still of the same height as she was male, but a whole lot prettier than she had been before.<br />
<br />
She, originally a humble construction worker, had her body transformed into an equally muscular, almost entirely feminine form, save for the now two penises that resided in her crotch (the likely reason for her sustained increased libido).  Though her butt, (which she now missed) was as tight and hard as it was when she was male, and though her new (firm and hard things she didn&#39;t miss) breasts were hardly larger than A-Cups, her not-very-attractive face had morphed into something of a bombshell.  All her coworkers thought it was hot, and were only able to see it during lunch breaks, where the protective goggles, helmets, and masks came off, exposing her new beauty to the world.<br />
With a new face like that, Allen, after a 2-week identity crisis, knew that he could no longer go on being fully male (despite having twice the equipment and an equal height and strength as before the Transformation Wave) and settled on becoming a very tomboyish female.  Allen grew out her hair to a short, girlish length and forming some sort or a messy-Stacked-Bob-ish haircut over the lockdown during the rest of the 4 weeks of unrest, and got acquainted with her new genitals.  She was still attracted to Feminine Qualities, after all, and had many fapping sessions with her two dicks while posing to herself, and flexing her muscles, in a mirror - quite often thanks to her increased libido.  <br />
Allen was on a 3-time a week masturbation schedule before she had gotten mugged of her own body.<br />
<br />
She had come into the coffee shop at around 7:45 P.M. that night to grab a quick drink and dessert before she continued construction for another three hours - she had already eaten dinner, and thinking back, she probably shouldn&#39;t have given into her temptations - again.<br />
<br />
Not that she would anytime soon considering the current state of her body.<br />
<br />
The baristas were a gem - a conjoined male and female duo, stuck back to back, that somehow were synchronized to the point that they could complete orders in a third of the time they had each individually done before the Wave.  They were cute too.<br />
<br />
But Allen&#39;s mind wasn&#39;t really on the baristas, and more so on her sexy coworker, Trina.<br />
<br />
She had joined the construction force after the Wave to make money after she had been laid off, along with millions of transformed individuals worldwide during the weeks of unrest and after.  Her body likely motivated her to join:<br />
<br />
In short: 3 heads with-looks-to-die-for faces, often smeared with a mixture of sweat and dust, ash, sawdust, or concrete powder, that shouldn&#39;t belong in the business, each with a distinct personality are perched atop a muscular body that still maintains distinctly feminine curves, one in the normal position, and the other two where her breasts should be, which often forced her to wear showy tops - not like there was really anything to hide.  6, large  muscular arms radiated around her star-like body, two extra just above her hips on each side of her body and two others replacing much of her legs.  All three of her heads, considering themselves to be one being, were all fun and cheery most of the time, but thanks to her imposing body and the unnerving way in which she crawled like a spider up and down places at construction sites and walked on her rear four arms, she didn&#39;t get talked to much by many people during the job.  Allen and her friends, after a great deal of deliberation, invited her into their group, and often hang out together when they aren&#39;t working.  Though strictly on &quot;friend&quot; terms as of now, Allen often dreams of becoming something more to the absolute goddess.<br />
<br />
Allen&#39;s dicks were stirring thinking about it as she walked along the street and back to the site when she got her head pulled off by an unseen assailant and pushed into an alley by another.  Her body on the ground and not yet disassembled, Allen, panicked, fought with everything she could.  She bit the hand holding her head and winced as it was dropped while she blindly swung her arms around, kicking, and punching, desperately trying to make contact with the body of one of her assailants.  She was hollering all the while.<br />
<br />
And she did hold them off for a few seconds until one of her assailants, after receiving a lucky punch to the face, tackled her as another, the man who had followed her from the coffee shop, grabbed her head and pulled off her lips as she was yelling and cursing.  He threw it into a bag, muffling her voice before he peeled off the rest of her face, like a mask, as her eyes went wide with panic.  He stuffed it in a separate bag before helping the other assailants pull apart her body.<br />
<br />
She was gasping for air and on the verge of tears as she felt her hands and arms and feet and legs ripped off her body and individually bagged as she flailed them in desperation before she felt her clothes become carefully removed, to her shock as her skin and muscle met the cold concrete.  Her torso was then bisected.  Her assailants groped her breasts before throwing her upper torso into a bag, and removed her boxers and groped her buttocks as she squirmed to no avail.  Her already agape mouth gasped further when the assailants groped her penises before pulling them off and placing them into bags of their own.<br />
<br />
Infuriated and at the point of tears, Allen shrieked with a broken voice, cursing out the harvesters who were likely going to sell her body parts illegally as she felt her body parts stacked on top of each other in their bags.<br />
<br />
She was suddenly silenced after she felt a sharp electric shock run through the entirety of her stolen body parts, and lost all control and feeling of them.<br />
<br />
A Desister is a small electric device that severed the control and feeling an individual with NBM abilities had over their detatched body parts with a high-voltage electric shock.  An affected individual would have no control or sensations of and from their detatched body parts until they came in physical contact with them again.<br />
<br />
Her world darkened and quieted as she had lost the ability to talk, hear, see, breathe, swallow, and move.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing the harvesters had not taken was her blank, earless head and its still-attached hair, which was found by children playing in the area the following day.<br />
<br />
Though she didn&#39;t know it, all of her coworkers and friends showed up to the hospital and took turns cupping Allen&#39;s head with their hardened hands that she&#39;d recognize anywhere.  Trina&#39;s still mostly-soft hands cupped Allen&#39;s head last, and convinced they were hers, Allen remained in a state of blushed bliss for the following day.<br />
<br />
The story of Allen&#39;s &quot;mugging&quot; became a national sensation and outrage thanks to his very vocal construction company, prompting a response by the WTEA.  Despite all of their efforts, Allen&#39;s body parts have yet to be found.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harvesting&quot; or the act of stealing the body parts or entire bodies of individuals with NBM abilities, for the purposes of demanding ransom or trafficking the parts, had become popular worldwide in the wake of the Fusion Wave, and was brought to greater light on an international stage with the unfortunate &quot;mugging&quot; of Allen Whittaker, just a few months after the Fusion Wave.  It is one of the major illegal global activities that the WTEA is doing its best to crack down on now.<br />
An often easy-to-commit crime in which body parts, if taken for trafficking purposes, are rarely found, transformees with NBM abilities are often afraid to publicly use their abilities in fear of becoming targeted.<br />
<br />
The greatest fear among mutants with NBM abilities is if their control over their stolen body parts is incorrectly or not severed - as is the case in some horrifying cases.<br />
<br />
Allen Whitaker has successfully been granted a new body identical to his transformed form (as was his wish) after vocal petitioning from his friends, family, and construction company officials led to the granting of the services of a Fleshweaver by the WTEA, a common courtesy to most irreparably damaged victims of Harvesting.</p>
