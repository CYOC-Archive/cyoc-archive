<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Duncan’s Mistake <br />
<br />
Duncan was a big kid.  At 6’6” and well over 250lb he was a typical football lineman, he packed a lot of mass but a lot of it was blubber.  And like the stereotype, Duncan was neither “quick” nor “good humored” on or off the field.  He took pride in how much damage he did to players on the opposing team and he would intentionally try to injury them.  His girl friends didn’t fair much better; although he always had one, they seldom stayed with him long.  A few had started to press charges against Duncan, but his family was well connected politically and they had always gotten the charges dropped or the cases thrown out.  Duncan was a womanizer and considered any guy that didn’t make it with a girl at least 3-4 times a week a queer. Of course, that was most of the guys at the school.  In Duncan’s mind the only reason for a gay guy to exist was to be abused.  And Duncan liked to abuse people.  Duncan was aware of Peter, Ty, Dustin and the others that hung around with them.  He had heard rumors of weird things happening around them, but believed then to be the excuses of guys that confront the little fairies and then chickened out.<br />
<br />
Peter, Rob, Dustin and Ty in-group walk in to the main entrance of the high school as they quietly chat.  Dustin and Ty head for their homeroom classes and Peter and Rob head for the administrative office to get Rob enrolled and get his class assignments.  Duncan saw Peter and the rest come in and in particular he note the shorter almost painfully lean guy, dressed in a baggie sweatshirt and baggie cargo pants, whom Peter had in tow.  “A wussy if there every was one,” thought Duncan, “It’s time those little fags learned their place.”<br />
<br />
  Peter had already used his power to cause the staff to be expecting Rob this morning and to have Rob’s class schedule setup to match his, while Rob adjusted to being a high school student again.  Rob had expected the process to take most of the morning but even to Peter’s surprise all the paperwork was in order.  They quickly make Rob his student ID, issued him his books and sold him a PE uniform.  Rob and Peter made it to their homeroom before the second bell.  They teacher took roll and the principal called on the PA system with the typical announcements of a bake sale for the glee club, a car wash for the band, kudos to the wrestling team for their excellent showing in the state championships, and the drug sniffing dogs would be checking lockers on Wednesday.  Rob looked at Peter with somewhat surprised expression, Peter responded with a “You heard right,” expression, Rob shakes his head in disbelief.  <br />
<br />
The bell ending homeroom sounded and everyone filed out to head for their first period classes.  Peter and Rob work their way through the packed hallways.  “Well,” Rob said to Peter, “There are two things I had forgotten that I hated about high school.” “What’s that?” replied Peter.  “Stupid bells and crowded halls,” Rob said and they both laugh.  In the meantime Duncan is heading in the opposite direction when he happens upon Peter and Rob sharing the laugh as they headed for their class.  As he passes Rob and Peter, Duncan grabs a smaller student that had the misfortune of passing by at that moment by the scuff of the neck and ‘throws’ him at Rob and quickly bulldozers off through the crowd.  Propelled by Duncan’s push the smaller teen slams into Rob and both of their books and papers go flying Rob is almost knocked off his feet but recovers his balance.  The smaller teen is sprawled at Rob’s feet. Peter and Rob help the kid up and they collect up the books and papers and after a round of, “What was his problem,” the three teens continue to their classes.  Which for Rob and Peter was English Lit. The rest of the morning was uneventful, Rob wanted to maintain a low profile and stayed quiet despite the history teacher totally distorting the events of Watergate and Nixon’s resignation, Rob had voted for Nixon and remembered the events first hand and the teacher had been barely out of diapers, and only knew what the history books said.  Rob was (or had been) old enough and was wise enough to know that George Orwell was right; history was constructed to meet the needs and goals of the present.  <br />
<br />
Eventually lunch period came and Peter and Rob met up with Dustin, Ty, Chuck, Allen and John in the cafeteria.  Rob and Dustin were still in “training” and they had brought their lunch as had Chuck.  The rest of the guys got in line to buy their food.  Dustin, Chuck and Rob headed for a nearly empty table to stake out space for the others.  The three proceed to break out their meals; Rob and Dustin had protein shakes, water and Rob’s “healthy tuna salad” on whole-wheat sandwiches, Chuck had PB&amp;J, a bag of chips, a banana and Peter was going to pick up a carton of milk for him.  Chuck had seen Dustin eat this before and knew that Rob had gotten Dustin on this ‘health kick.’ This was the first time Chuck had met Rob and he was surprised that Rob looked so much smaller then Peter and Dustin but both of his pals said Rob was their fitness and nutrition guru.  “So what exactly is in that stuff?” Chuck asked Rob.  “Well the tuna is just canned tuna with whipped cottage cheese, mustard, dill pickle relish, some celery seeds, flax oil and just a little fat free honey mustard salad dressing to hold it together like regular tuna salad.  The shakes are just low fat, low carb, whey protein shakes, nothing special,” Rob replied.  And Dustin adds with his mouth half full of sandwich, “It’s really pretty good, and I gotten to like it better than standard tuna now.”  “But why do you do it,” asked Chuck, “eat like that and workout all the time.  Peter or Ty could just zap you up any sort of body you could want.”  “Well that is the point Chuck,” said Rob, “They could, and Peter did give me a “jump start” on the way to this body but working for the gains make me feel better about myself.  And I need all the self confidence and self esteem I can get.”  “Think fast, Chuck!” says Peter as he tosses a milk container at Chuck.  Chuck starts to duck but it is too late and the container comes within inches of his face but stops and hovers in space.  As Peter sits down Ty gives him a playful pop to the back of the head and says, “Aren’t you the one that’s always telling me to maintain a low profile when it comes to that stuff?”  Peter introduces Rob to the guys that hadn’t met him be for and let them in on Rob’s situation.  Allen piped up, “Wow you are or were older than my dad.  Why would you want to be a kid again, grown up get to have all the fun?”  Rob smiled and said, “Well having been a kid and an adult and now a kid again I can tell you with complete certainty that the other side of the fence is always greener.  Be happy with the age you are and make the most of it, most people don’t get a second chance.  I wasted being a teen the first time and I consider myself very lucky to have bumped into Peter and to have him give me a second shot at it.”  <br />
<br />
Duncan sat with his current girlfriend draped over him, as she stroked his ego and muscles, and tickling his ear with her tongue.  Duncan caught sight of Peter and Company on the other side of the cafeteria and fumed.  The little fags were in ‘his’ cafeteria and Dustin, his teammate from football, was being friendly with that new little wussy and actually eating lunch with him.  That little fag would regret having ever come to Duncan’s school, if he had any say in the matter.  <br />
<br />
The gang finishes lunch and Peter and Rob head for their next class.  Physics, without calculus, what a joke.  If the teacher had any idea about what he was talking about he kept it a secret from the class in Rob’s opinion.  Rob decided that to keep from sleeping through all of the science and math classes he would have to get Peter to get him into the Advanced Placement session for most of his classes.  The bell rings and Peter and Rob head to the gym their next class.  For Rob it would be his first PE class in the body of an athlete.  This was one class Rob was looking forward to.  What would PE be like when his physical abilities were in the top few percent of the class rather than the bottom?  And he loved the feel of moving in this body.  But Rob and Peter shared this class with Duncan.  And although Rob didn’t know it yet Duncan has a problem with Rob.  <br />
<br />
As Rob had remembered new school PE uniforms were grossly over sized because they would shrink a 20-40% in the first washing.  As with his sweatshirt and cargo pants any hint of Rob’s compact muscular and totally shredded body was lost in the folds of baggie fabric.  Peter offer to improve the fit but Rob wanted to stay low profile for now and baggie t-shirt and shorts worked to that end.  Class today would be playing half court basketball Peter was delighted.  Rob was less enthusiastic but was all right with it. <br />
<br />
Several weeks ago, not long after Rob had joined the group. Peter, Dustin, and some other guys were putting together a pickup game of basketball at the park.  They needed an extra body so Peter drafted Rob’s.  In the first minute of play Peter realizes that Rob was right, he totally sucked as a basketball player.  His body could do just about anything he asked of it but Rob had no concept of how the play and was thoroughly not enjoying the game.  Not wanting Rob to get mad at him again for poking around in his head without Rob’s okay first, Peter stopped the game and afford to give Rob an understanding of the game and a basic skill set.  Knowing that Peter had a passion for the game, Rob agrees to let Peter put the information in his head.  When they started to play again Rob knew what to do now, but had become incredibly clumsy tripping over his own feet, worse than right after Peter had morphed Rob.  Peter had passed Rob information on how to make Peter’s body play ball and it would take Rob some time to adjust Peter’s skills to work for Rob’s body.  By the end of the game Rob was starting to rival Peter’s abilities at the game and Rob had to admit it was enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Peter had used his power to cause Rob, John and he to be on the same team.  And the fates saw to it that Duncan was on the opposing team, a situation that suited Duncan intentions perfectly.  Duncan would put this new wuss friend of Peter in his place. “With some luck that might just be the hospital,” Duncan smiled to himself.  <br />
<br />
The game started and quickly Peter and Rob dominated play on their team.  Not that they intended to do that, it just happened.  They were both always where the other needed for them to be for a pass, an assist, or whatever was required.  Not that surprising when you consider that Peter was a good player and Rob’s play was an almost exact copy of Peter’s style.  Peter had just passed Rob the ball and as he started to go up for the shot, what felt like a freight train slammed into Rob from behind and sent him flying.  A bit stunned and shaken Rob starts to pull himself together, as he got to his feet.  It was easy to guess who had nailed him.  The biggest kid on the court was attempting to look innocent and the other guys all looked a bit confused by what had just occurred.  “What brought that on?” Rob thought to himself, but decided to ignore the hit.  Play starts up again but before long Duncan planted his left elbow squarely and with force into Rob’s sternum and abs sending Rob on another brief flight.  This was not an accident and Rob knew it.  This time as Rob picks himself up shouts to Duncan, “Say, knock off the rough stuff, friend.”  Duncan ignores Rob’s warning.  And the game continues.  Duncan is still a bit overly physical with Rob but not like the first to hits.  They play without major incident until about five minute before it was time to hit the showers.  <br />
<br />
When the much larger Duncan smashes in to Rob for a third time with what would have been bone-crushing force.  And if it weren’t for Rob’s dense muscularity the blow would have crushed bones.  Rob is immediately on his feet.  “Look man,” Rob is seriously pissed and says, “I don’t know what your problem is…  I just came here this morning and from the first time you saw me you’ve been on my back…  Why?  What could I have possibly done?  You must have a reason.”  Duncan is in Rob’s face in a heartbeat yelling, “You faggots are trying to take over everything!”  Duncan rambled on with anti-gay rhetoric as Rob took a step back to re-establish his personal space, Rob shakes his head and says, “Not that it’s any of your business but I’m not gay… Where did you get the idea that I was? I just came to this school this morning… I can’t have a rep and I never did anything to make you think that, did I?”  Duncan was back in Rob’s face and snapped, “You’re real chummy those other fags…” and Duncan motioned to Peter and John.  Rob again re-established his personal space to be non-threatening to Duncan (although this time he realized that Duncan might be interpreting the action as a sign of weakness) and said, “Why do you think they’re gay? Did they make a pass at you or did you see them doing something?  I came to live with Peter, Dustin and Ty when my parents were killed in a car crash,” Rob said, echoing the cover story that explained is recent appearance as part of Peter, Ty and Dustin’s ‘family.’  He continued, “I have never seen any of them do anything that would make me think that they were gay…” Duncan is back in Rob’s face but this time Rob stands his ground and says, “Even if they were what did any of us do to you to justify your actions?”  This infuriated Duncan and he goes to shove Rob.  Rob was expecting Duncan to react with some kind of an attack and is able to sidestep Duncan, who stumbles forward off balance when he failed to dissipate the energy of his attack on its intended target.  This prompted a round of laughter for the other boys watching the confrontation, which only served to further enrage the big teen.  Duncan made another lunge at Rob who again sidestepped the big teen’s attack, resulting in more laughter and this time a couple of cheers.  Duncan lunges and again Rob sidesteps, this time Rob saying, “I don’t want to fight you, man… back off dude…” And the spectators respond with laughter and more cheers.  Duncan is now livid and the activity has caught the attention of the PE instructors who’ve seen Rob twice dodge the much larger teen.  Duncan charges Rob for a forth time and again Rob sidesteps but this time as Duncan passes by him Rob knocks Duncan off balance, laying the big teen face down on the gym floor.  Rob then holds Duncan down by pinning the larger teen’s arm to the floor, to the cheers of on lookers.  The instructors separated Duncan and Rob, sending every one, but Duncan, to shower for their next class.  <br />
<br />
The rest of the day passed uneventfully and the school day came to an end.  The gang meets up at almost the same place they had separated that morning and started to head for the car.  Approaching the parking lot Peter and Rob caught sight of Duncan and it was obvious he was not happy.  As Rob approached where Duncan was standing people started to clear the area around the point where Rob’s path would come closest to Duncan’s location.  As Rob with Peter, Dustin and Ty came to the point of closest approach Duncan yell to Rob, “You got me suspended from the football team, you little faggot…” Duncan continued his tirade and started to walk toward Rob.  Rob stops and calmly says, “Look man I didn’t do anything to you!  You beat on me plenty good and then tried to take my head off!  If you got suspended from football it’s your own doing not mine!”  Duncan has stopped about 5 feet from where Rob was standing and says, “No!!! You did this to me and you’re going the pay for it.”  Rob shakes his head and replies, “I’m not going to fight you.”  “Well I’m going to smash you so don’t worry about it,” yelled Duncan and he charged at Rob, again Rob dodged the hulking teen and as Duncan passed Rob gently knocked Duncan off balance and Duncan threw himself sprawling on to the grass.  Duncan was back on his feet quickly as the grass had cushioned his fall.  Rob repeated, “I’m not going to fight you,” turned and started to walk away from the confrontation.  But Duncan wasn’t finished with Rob.  Duncan pulled a switchblade from his pocket and again charged toward Rob.  He got within two steps of Rob’s back and froze solid, as did the rest of the bystanders.  <br />
<br />
Peter walk to Rob who had now turn back to Duncan and Peter, “You shouldn’t have turned your back to him.” “I knew you were watching my back and giving him that clear a target kept this short,” Rob said to Peter.  Peter nodded and said, “You’re right about not poking about in people’s head.  I went in Duncan’s and I never want to go anywhere like that again.  I feel unclean now.”  Rob replied, “Well what are you going to do with him?”  Peter shook his head and said, “This is one seriously messed up dude, aren’t you Duncan.”  Peter takes the knife from Duncan and showed it to Rob and continues, “Your attitude toward gays is interesting, you won’t admit it to yourself but you are gay, aren’t you Duncan.  And your womanizing and overt hatred for gays is to hide your fear of being gay from yourself.  You raped all those girls just to prove to yourself you weren’t gay, because you couldn’t or wouldn’t accept the truth about yourself.  Well your going to be out of the closet from now on.  And you like hurting people don’t you Duncan, part of that is your problem with your sexuality but at its core you’re a sadist aren’t you.  You’re not going to be able to hurt people anymore Duncan and you are going to be happy to be who you are.”  As Peter said this, Duncan started to change.  He quickly loss his bulk and his bone structure became lighter and more delicate.  And the formerly hulking teen lost height quickly dropping to less than 5’6”.  As Duncan’s body approached its final form Peter relaxed his hold on Duncan allowing him to stand and try to keep his now grossly oversized clothes from falling off.  When the morph finished, Duncan was still 18 years old but only 5’2” and 98lbs, almost a foot and a half shorter and a bit more than a third of the weight he had been minutes ago.  “I can’t let you go around like that,” said Peter, “I said you would like the new you Duncan, so lets get you dressed right for your new life.”  Duncan’s clothes reformed into a very tight shiny silver-blue shirt and black pants.  “There you go Duncan you’re the perfect submissive gay club boy now.  You accept your sexuality and are going to have fun in your new life.  But you are going to understand all the pain that you caused others and regret that for the rest of your life.  Peter then wished that everyone would remember that Duncan had always been as he was now, that nothing had just happened, and released his hold on everyone.  The new Duncan stood a bit dazed and confused looking back and forth between Peter and Rob.  Finally Peter says, “Boo!” and Duncan bolts and runs off.<br />
<br />
Peter says to the group of their friend that had been walking with them before the confrontation between Duncan and Rob, “Well it’s a lot safer to be a girl around here now then it had been.”  And the group continued their walk to the car,  “Duncan always bragged about his conquests but the way he told it the girls would throw themselves at him, I had no idea Duncan was like that.  I knew he was an ass but…” said Dustin.   Peter replied, “You’re luck you were on the same team as him, he sent several guys to the hospital and one was still in a wheel chair because of hits Duncan gave them on the field, he just had remarkable recovery as did several of the girls that he had beat up and raped.  I want to get home and take a shower.  That was one sick twisted dude,” said Peter.  “And I want to get my homework done before we hit the gym tonight,” said Rob, “Are either of you joining Dustin and me tonight.”  And the group dropped into their normal chitchat and headed back home.<br />
