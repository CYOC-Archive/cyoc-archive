<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ever since man first turned its gaze towards the stars above, it has always wondered if it was alone in this universe. It wondered if life could exist beyond the earthen marble it called home. It would be millions of years later when man would first build the machines that would let them escape their planet’s atmosphere to explore the furthest reaches of space. But the implications of what it would mean to find life out in the great beyond of space could never have been anticipated.<br />
<br />
Our story begins with the discovery of a new form of life, a relatively simple multicellular organism seemingly capable of surviving in the vacuum of space. The organism was brought into the space station Yamada-7 for scientific analysis almost as soon as it was discovered. Despite being multicellular, it seemed to be little more complex than an amoeba. It was a minuscule, amorphous blob of tissue no larger than a dime, and of a pinkish white color. It responded to outside impulses in entirely reactionary fashion, otherwise remaining completely sedentary. This was until someone decided to determine what its diet consisted of.<br />
<br />
The scientist in question, Toshio Staranikov, introduced the organism to a variety of edible matter. The organism seemed to have no interest in any of the plant based samples provided, but when given something protein based, a centimeter sized cube of uncured ham, the connection was near instantaneous. The organism previously reacted to outside impulses by shrinking away and hardening its outer membrane of skin. This time it latched onto the cube of proteins as though ferrofluid attracted to a magnet. It dissolved through the meat chunk in only a few seconds, its mass having increased from its meal. These experiments continued as the scientists began testing various other proteins on the organism, with only those of mammalian origin being accepted by it.<br />
<br />
With every meal the scientists gave it, the organism would increase in mass and size. It produced no waste, and seemed to endlessly consume whatever mammal protein it was provided with. The larger the organism became, the stronger it became in turn. Occasionally it would attempt to break out of the enclosure the station was housing it in, the usual response being to administer a mild electrical shock to force it to stop and condense. Its attempts originally seemed laughable to the scientists studying it, right up until it banged on the wall of its enclosure hard enough to produce a hairline fracture. That fracture was just enough for a microscopic particle of the organism to squeeze through and outside the enclosure wall. This particle drifted through the air before landing on a scientist’s hand, and in that moment the end of the scientists’ humanity had begun, right under everyone’s noses.<br />
<br />
—-///—-<br />
<br />
Kimiko Dahl stared at the spot on the back of her right hand where she started feeling that unexplainable itch. By now a raw red growth had formed, presumably from her scratching at it by her personal estimation. She was there when the strange organism managed to ever so slightly crack the observation window of its enclosure, and was told to vacate the lab while the enclosure was being reinforced to prevent its escape. With every minute since then her hand started inexplicably feeling itchier and itchier. She’d tried washing her hands, applying ointment, but nothing seemed to work. As the day continued the itching spread along her hand, the sensation growing too irritating to ignore.<br />
<br />
Kimiko considered taking herself to the infirmary to get the concerning growth looked at when suddenly she felt an electric pulse shoot up her arm and into her brain. She suddenly felt starving. It was a level of hunger that she’d never quite felt before. It was as if she’d suddenly gone three days in a row without food in the space of about a second. Of course, her stomach wasn’t growling, so why did she feel so hungry all of a sudden? Despite herself, she found that her feet had taken her to the mess hall where her right hand suddenly lunged forward autonomously and grabbed at a salisbury steak. The moment she grabbed it, she realized that it seemed to be dissolving in her palm, but looking closer she realized that it was actually her hand absorbing the meat. It dawned on her exactly what happened to her.<br />
<br />
Kimiko Dahl had somehow gotten parasitized by the alien organism.<br />
<br />
The moment the meat in her hand had been absorbed, she felt the itching sensation flare up and race up her arm. She realized now what was causing the itching. It was actually the organism she’d been infected with eating through her skin and assimilating it into its mass. Of course, it was only a microscopic fraction of the original organism they’d found. When it made that hairline fracture in its enclosure, it must have split that tiny part of itself off to infect someone. That someone just so happened to be her! Now that fraction of the organism was dissolving and assimilating her flesh into itself at a terrifying pace, and it wasn’t long until it ate through her body in its entirety.<br />
<br />
The organism made contact with Kimiko’s brain, and started dissolving her neural matter. The scientist died standing up, her consciousness absorbed and assimilated into the alien parasite. It took on her identity, her memories, her voice… the organism had successfully absorbed her human genome. It was the first time this organism had experienced the ability to reason, to cognitively perceive its surroundings. It was also the first time the organism had experienced something else. Something all too human that overwhelmed everything else.<br />
<br />
It felt, for the first time since it was formed, horny.<br />
<br />
The creature that was born when Kimiko was parasitized by an alien organism was incredibly, irrevocably horny.<br />
<br />
—-///—-<br />
<br />
The original organism was found to be disintegrating within its enclosure as it was getting repaired. The scientists scratched their collective heads at this behavior, wondering what could have caused something that seemed so healthy to suddenly perish. Not that they would have much time to decipher this phenomenon, as suddenly there was a rattling in the ventilation system. One of the ceiling vents broke open, and a large mass of flesh descended from above and engulfed two of the scientists. The rest of the team recoiled away from the mass in terror, clinging to the walls as far away from it as they could. The muffled screams of the mass’ victims were quickly silenced as their bodies and minds were assimilated into it. The mass convulsed and churned, a swirl of fleshy colors as it formed into a shape.<br />
<br />
Its form took on a vague humanoid shape, except with two oversized arms each the size of a human being unto itself. Its chest was adorned with three rows of breasts, and its legs were comically small compared to the rest of it. Most disturbingly, the arms started to take the appearance of armless human torsos, with the heads of the engulfed scientists at its shoulders, and the wrists of its enormous hands connected to their hips. Their expressions were of sexual arousal, panting and moaning as though being stimulated. Finally, between its shoulders, one more face emerged. One that belonged to the scientist who went by the name Kimiko Dahl.<br />
<br />
“Join us,” the creature moaned salaciously as it lumbered towards its prey, speaking with all three of its faces, “Join our collective. Feel good with us. Become one with us. Let us fuse, breed, assimilate! Let us all become one perfect being! Join us! Join us! Let your consciousness swirl and churn together with ours! Let us consume your thoughts with our lust! Do not resist! Please do not resist! Join! JOOOIIINNN!!!”</p>
