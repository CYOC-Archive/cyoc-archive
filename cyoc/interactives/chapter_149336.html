<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sherry wasn&#39;t sure if she&#39;ll be staying in Dinosaur City after the summer. She was here for a few reasons. One thing is to look around a city where she wouldn&#39;t have to stoop to get through most of the doorways. Another was that she was participating in the IAC games here. She was doing a rather unique competition called the &#39;ram run&#39;. The competition featured a heavy sandbag that was connected to a track that went down the length of the field. The goal was for the competitors to charge at the sandbag from a measured distance and hit the sandbag like a linebacker. The sandbag would be pushed down the track and the competitors would have a limited amount of time to keep shoving the sandbag until they had to stop. It was a sport that focused both on strength and speed. It was a competition mainly meant for larger Animalians who were built for charging, like rhinos, elephants, and bulls. Sherry was going to see how far a triceratops would fare in this sport.<br />
<br />
It was slightly lonely coming to this city since Wanda didn&#39;t go with her. While she and her partner had gotten to be close friends, Wanda made it clear that a woolly rhino couldn&#39;t really spend much time in a very hot climate, especially in the heart of Texas. Sherry wondered if she could work for the police department here. Considering that Animalia was such a crime-free area, there wasn&#39;t a lot for her to do than act like security for events were the crowds could get too rowdy. She kinda doubted anyone would try to make trouble in a city of dinosaurs, but then it was Texas.<br />
<br />
But Sherry had people waiting for her here, Dinotopians she knew back in Nevada who moved here. And one other person who was particularly waiting for her. Stepping into the Horizon Labs building was an immediate relief from the heat outside. She quickly spotted who she was looking for. Trenton was obviously suffering from the heat, his shirt soaked with sweat. &quot;Trenton, glad you make it here,&quot; said Sherry.<br />
<br />
Trenton wiped his forehead and said, &quot;I&#39;m not sure how you can stand this heat, unless dinosaurs really are cold-blooded.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re closer to warm-blooded,&quot; said Sherry, &quot;But it&#39;s not too bad for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I guess that it&#39;ll make my upcoming transformation easier,&quot; said Trenton. It hadn&#39;t taken selling his entire collection to be able to afford conversion, mostly because Sherry had gotten him sponsorship. Though obviously there would be a few sacrifices for moving here and becoming a Dinotopian.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;ll find adjusting here easier than you think,&quot; said Sherry.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Trenton was actually Jeremy&#39;s first patient since he moved to Dinosaur City. He was glad the tools here were easy for his large, four-fingered hands to use. Jeremy explained the process to Trenton once they were in the changing room. &quot;Now, usually, it takes two separate doses to make sure someone is double-dosed,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;But we&#39;ve found that a large enough exposure to infectious substances will count for two doses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s as much as I&#39;ll have to take?&quot; asked Trenton. He was eying the huge syringe in Jeremy&#39;s hand nervously. While he wasn&#39;t extra afraid of needles, anyone would be worried about having a needle that big jabbed into them.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the minimum dosage to ensure double-dosing,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...couldn&#39;t Sherry, er, infect me twice?&quot; asked Sherry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like you, but I don&#39;t quite like you <i>that</i> much,&quot; said Sherry. She was well aware it would take two drinks from her breasts to double-dose him. In fact, it was mainly her milk that was in Jeremy&#39;s syringe. But Sherry wasn&#39;t yet comfortable with anyone but herself touching her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suggest that you remove your clothes, as they&#39;re going to get torn apart,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
Trenton took off her shirt, shoes, and socks, but left his pants on. &quot;These are extra-stretchy pants,&quot; said Trenton, &quot;I think they may survive the transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not so sure about that,&quot; said Jeremy before he injected the syringe into Trenton&#39;s arm. &quot;Sherry, let&#39;s give him some privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I was thinking of staying,&quot; said Sherry, &quot;He may need a little help adjusting after his change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy just shrugged and said, &quot;Fine with me. I&#39;ll leave you two be.&quot; He walked over the door and said, &quot;Welcome to Dinotopia,&quot; before walking out.<br />
<br />
Trenton was thinking he was feeling queasy with the large amount of liquid that was just pumped into his veins. But now he was feeling different. His arm was itching like crazy and he scratched at it. It didn&#39;t take him long to notice his skin was becoming tough and scaly. &quot;How long does this transformation take?&quot; asked Trenton as the scales were spreading.<br />
<br />
&quot;Usually a few minutes,&quot; said Sherry, who was watching Trenton&#39;s change with interest. Trenton was already starting to grow taller. His shoulders were starting to get broader. A large gurgling sound was heard as Trenton clutched his stomach, which was rather expansive because of his slow metabolism and sedentary lifestyle. But then his stomach actually shrank under his hands. It was only a little bit at first, but then the inches started coming off. His flabby arms were also becoming more defined as muscle grew.<br />
<br />
More saurian features were becoming more obvious. The back of his pants were bulging as his new tail was growing out. His legs were also putting pressure on the pants as they grew longer and thicker. His feet were growing bigger as his little toes got swallowed up and the remaining toes became more saurian. Likewise, his pinky fingers were fused into his ring fingers as his fingernails became blunt claws. Hair was falling out all over his body, particularly his head. Trenton grunted as his face started pushing out into a snout, his lips becoming more like a beak. Sherry noticed his horns were growing bigger than hers, even his head frill. Apparently that was a part of sexual dimorphism for Triceratops, at least for their Animalian counterparts.<br />
<br />
But then Sherry&#39;s attention was grabbed by Trenton&#39;s torso. His fat burning away, leaving very large and thick muscles in their place. Sherry was starting to feeling a little warm inside as those muscles became more defined. Her eyes drifted down to his crotch and widened. His pants were bursting at the seams not just because of his new tail or his larger legs and hips. His crotch was bulging obscenely, looking ready to burst. That warm feeling in Sherry quickly built up to a flame, particularly one between her loins.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Trenton grunted and panted as his transformation slowed to a stop. Blinking, he saw the room was blurry at first. But then he reached up and gently took his glasses off. His vision became much better, even if it was being partially obscured by his horn. Standing up, he staggered a bit, causing his pants to rip more. But he walked over to the mirror to look at himself. He had imagined himself to become pretty ripped as a Triceratops and he wasn&#39;t disappointed. He looked like the heavyweight superheroes in many of his comics, the colossal, heavily-muscled kind. His scales were similar to Sherry&#39;s in coloration, but darker, a little more brown than orange.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trenton, how do you feel?&quot; asked Sherry, who was eating up Trenton&#39;s huge body with her eyes.<br />
<br />
Trenton turned to face Sherry, noticing she was about 4 inches shorter than he was. &quot;I feel...&quot; he said, his voice deeper than before. His eyes briefly drifted to Sherry&#39;s large breasts. That was evidently the breaking point as his pants crotch finally gave way with a loud rip. Trenton stared down at his new cock, which was rather elephantine. It was thick and had to be 20 inches long. Useless as it was to hide it, Trenton put his hands over his cock. &quot;I am so sorry,&quot; said Trenton, very embarrassed, &quot;I did not mean for that to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sherry had seen plenty enough and it pushed her over the edge. She hadn&#39;t been with a man since she converted and she couldn&#39;t wait any longer. &quot;Trenton, you remember me saying I didn&#39;t like you in <i>that</i> way?&quot; she asked as she started removing her shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, yes?&quot; said Trenton sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I changed my mind,&quot; said Sherry as she unfastened her bra, &quot;There&#39;s a 65 million year itch that I really need you to scratch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, actually the age of dinosaurs ended 66-&quot; started Trenton before Sherry removed her bra, exposing her breasts, &quot;But I&#39;d be happy to help you with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Sherry removed her pants and panties, she said, &quot;I&#39;m not quite sure if this is going to be more than a quick fuck. This might just be a &#39;friends with benefits&#39; situation. But I&#39;m just...too horny to really think that far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not thinking much further than the next few minutes myself,&quot; admitted Trenton. As his pants were beyond salvaging, he just tore the rest of them off.<br />
<br />
Sherry got on the bed, spreading her legs. &quot;Have you much experience with this?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, of course I&#39;ve been with-&quot; started Trenton. Sherry gave him a flat look. &quot;Only one other girl,&quot; admitted Trenton.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least you aren&#39;t a complete virgin,&quot; said Sherry, &quot;Now show me how you use your lower horn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trenton rubbed his new nose horn and said, &quot;I&#39;m not sure how... Oh, that horn.&quot; He walked over to the bed and positioned himself over Sherry. &quot;I hope I can make this last long,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;ll find adjusting here easier than you think,&quot; said Sherry. With that encouragement, Trenton plunged into Sherry. The two Triceratops groaned as they gave in to primal instinct.</p>
