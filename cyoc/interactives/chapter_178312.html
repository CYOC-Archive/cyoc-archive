<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brandon KNEW he was male. Mentally at least.<br />
<br />
Knew he wanted to penetrate, and fuck, and do what he was meant to at least in his mind. And while he disliked the changes to his genitals, he did admit he liked being more cut, more shredded. He was looking at least muscle wise like someone who took care of their body. He contemplated trying to go workout. Where to even go for the locker room though? He also knew himself well enough to know in his present state he would probably try for some guy there. He didn&#39;t want to.<br />
<br />
But he knew himself enough to know he wouldn&#39;t be able to help himself.<br />
<br />
Sure he was his own person, but the urges that came with this transformation just fucked with him. Made him want things and think things he had never contemplated before. And even made him wonder if this was something he&#39;d fantasized idly about before. Something that he had just never known he wanted---<br />
<br />
Brandon&#39;s contemplation was stopped by several angry knocks at the door to his little chamber, his abode. He wondered who it was now. Was it some relative angry he had cut all contact and wanting some money to tide them over? Was it some acquaintance of the doctor come to unleash more bad news?<br />
<br />
When Brandon went to the door to get answers, he was rather surprised by the person on the other side. Initially he thought it might be some random person, but the clothes matched up enough to make Brandon realize who it was...just not the appearance the guy currently wore. Brandon stepped back even as another angry knock was delivered.<br />
<br />
It was Jake, his gay hook up from earlier. And Jake looked very different. It seemed whatever gender irregularity had affected Brandon had also spread in a certain way to Jake. His features were somewhat softer, no facial hair on his face any longer, and his hair was slightly bushier, wavier, longer. His musculature was somewhat more toned, visible through the short sleeves...but his chest. His chest was more prominent, approaching the look of female breasts even as his face was at most rather androgynous.<br />
<br />
His ass was more prominent by a bit, and his legs seemed a bit stronger looking. Brandon dreaded the confrontation, but he knew well enough that Jake had good reason to be angry with him. He decided at once to let him in. The pizza boy deserved to know what happened.<br />
<br />
As soon as the door was open, Brandon was almost pushed back by the angry Jake shouting, &quot;You! You did this to me! I don&#39;t even know how you did it, but it---it&#39;s some kind of---of sex disease or something!&quot; Jake outright took his shirt off, showing his well toned and muscular form now having feminine breast tissue as well. He looked like he was female in the chest - androgynous in the face, and with the muscular look he had prior.<br />
<br />
&quot;It---It&#39;s...I don&#39;t even know, man! It affected me too! I don&#39;t know how much more I&#39;m gonna change, but I had no idea---&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake glowered and looked around, &quot;Great, great, so you had this, you didn&#39;t even know, and now we&#39;re BOTH stuck changing!&quot; Jake grumbled some more, &quot;Can&#39;t stop myself from jacking off, boobs on my chest, and I keep on thinking about how good it was fooling around with you...&quot; He admitted, though with some degree of bitterness.<br />
<br />
Brandon breathed and tried to calm things down, &quot;Jake, listen, we&#39;re both changing unpredictably, so...maybe if we can figure something out, we can both get back to some degree of normalcy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s the shitty thing,&quot; Jake bit his lip, &quot;The sensitivity on this is off the scales. I can barely stop myself from beating off like I&#39;m some fucking teen who just discovered how good it felt.&quot; Brandon could tell, looking at Jake, that was probably what was happening right now. Just being around Brandon for whatever reason was making Jake feel like doing something.<br />
<br />
Something they&#39;d both probably regret - as doing so would likely further both of their transformations.<br />
<br />
And Brandon didn&#39;t want anything further to happen to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna try my hardest to help you get back to normal. If I can get you back to normal...mmph...I should be able to as well.&quot; It seemed Brandon was responding to the look of Jake, now nursing a noticeable if about an inch smaller erection. His thoughts immediately about taking Jake&#39;s dick again. Though he knew if they made that mistake most likely Jake would lose it in the process of the next change. They were more or less stable.<br />
<br />
For now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just uhh, leave you the room here to use to get yourself under control.&quot; Brandon started toward the upstairs room.<br />
<br />
Jake remarked, &quot;Yeah, just...just don&#39;t come down. I don&#39;t wanna change any more...but ooh, I can barely stop myself any more. Fuck but it feels so sensitive now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon locked the door behind him once he was up just in case. His own sex organs now feeling ready to go for a round. His not quite cock pulsing in his shorts. He thought about Jake downstairs, and looked at his own reflection. He needed to give the guy space. Otherwise, both of them would end up changing more...</p>
