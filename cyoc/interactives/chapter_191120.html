<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dillon Wallace didn&#39;t expect much out of the whole &quot;Muscle Tech-X&quot; thing. A number of the bodybuilders in here, like those two guys at the desk, claimed that it did wonders for them, and yet, Dillon suspected the real culprit was probably much less legal steroids. Dillon was what someone might call a hard gainer, that was, if he could gain any muscle at all. He stood about six foot three, and looked skinny as a rail. He had disheveled, bushy light brown hair, hazel colored eyes, and a pale countenance. He dressed in a loose tank top that hanged off of his shoulders and a pair of yoga pants that were passed down to him by his older brother.<br />
<br />
Dillon was used to being treated like he either didn&#39;t exist or was a simple pushover. Sure he did the homework for the jocks in his senior class, but were they ever grateful enough to welcome him to a senior party, or get him a date for the prom? Nope. De nada. Never. They were just like everyone else. They ignored him, or made demands of him. Honestly, Dillon was of a mind to try out the Muscle Tech-X stuff. Just to see if it might be able to help him get into better shape. Anything would be better than...well, this.<br />
<br />
He had been trying to do some bench press, but he could barely do even ten lbs on each side. He knew that even though people weren&#39;t explicitly laughing at him, they were probably doing so as soon as he wasn&#39;t around. This was baby weight and he knew it. And the sad fact was Dillon had been stuck here for months with utterly no progress to see. <br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t so delusional as to expect a woman to be entirely willing to overlook his body and focus on his mind. That just wasn&#39;t how the world worked. And besides...he wanted muscle. He wanted to for once in his life be the big guy at the front of the room. Casually flexing his biceps and straining his sleeves.<br />
<br />
Fuck it.<br />
<br />
Dillon got up, tired of being frustrated with his 65 lbs bench press and tired of people thinking they were helping him by offering pithy little advice about shifting his form. He needed something to really buff him up. He wanted to look like Hans or Tyson. He wanted a babe like Kelly Crauss to notice him for his body. He worked up his courage and started to approach the desk. He knew they&#39;d probably make fun of him. Probably find it so hilarious that Dillon was going for it---<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you down for some Muscle Tech-X? Put some heavy muscle on that body?&quot; Hans was grinning at him, holding one of the small dosage bottles. Dillon looked at the huge bodybuilder, kind of surprised he was being treated seriously. There were some unisex clothes on there too, compliments to the dosage.<br />
<br />
Kelly spoke in a surprisingly flirty and interested tone, &quot;Now, I know what you&#39;re thinking. I&#39;ve tried just, so many other supplements and muscle gainer shakes, but none have worked. I&#39;ve seen you around a lot, Dillon. You work hard. But you don&#39;t get anywhere. Muscle Tech-X however can overwrite the genetics that have left you in the dust compared to the jocks and bodybuilders around here. How about it? Finally fill in that tall body?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dillon gulped, hoping that Kelly wouldn&#39;t notice. It took very little for the attention starved Dillon to end up hopelessly aroused. His manhood was a mere five inches hard, and it stuck out in his pants quite noticeably. Yet even as he gulped and thought about it, none of the three at the table were rude to him. If anything, Hans enticed him further, &quot;You wanna get like this...?&quot; He flexed a 20 inch bicep, &quot;Take the Muscle Tech-X. It&#39;ll help. Promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dillon could not help it. He eagerly accepted the test dosage, and ran off to drink it, taking the Unisex Clothes with him. He didn&#39;t notice the wry look that the trio gave as he ran off. As soon as Dillon was in the locker room, he outright drank down the dosage of Muscle Tech-X, making sure to drink every single drop possible. He didn&#39;t want to miss a single thing - out of fear of somehow not getting the maximum results.<br />
<br />
As soon as he put down the small bottle, Dillon felt a stirring inside of himself like he&#39;d never felt before. He gasped, his muscles feeling tight, hot, a strange tingling rushing through him that wasn&#39;t exactly bad, but completely alien in just how good it felt. Hence, he hoped whatever it was faded quick. But as he lingered there, he shook, feeling like a kid overdosing on sugar. He---He needed to do something now. His body was thrumming with power and energy...!<br />
<br />
Dillon moved fast back over to the bench press, not even checking the mirror. He found himself lifting the 65 lbs easier than he ever had before, the strange tingling progressing into a shockingly pleasant burning sensation. If he had thought his erection might go down, it did not. In fact if anything it became more insurgent. More demanding. Dillon had never felt so horny, so turned on in his entire life. Even after he&#39;d just discovered porn, and watched two Lesbians finger each other the first time...!<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t even realize it by the time he got to 20 reps that he had flown through them so easily. &quot;Gotta do more...!&quot; He didn&#39;t recognize his voice initially. It seemed to crack and drop deeper in tone as he got up and basically threw the 10 lbs on the ground, loading 25 lbs weights on there. Dillon...Dillon didn&#39;t know if he could DO this one just so soon...?<br />
<br />
He could.<br />
<br />
Dillon found himself storming through the 95 lbs bench press in short order as well. &quot;Ahh...Ahh!&quot; He felt a tightness in his chest he&#39;d never known before, muscles pressing against his shirt like they never had before. Popping...his muscles were popping outward! Dillon told himself he&#39;d &quot;superset&quot;, even though he&#39;d never taken it that seriously before. Grabbing up a pair of 30 lbs dumbbells from the rack at the end of the gym, he stared down intently at his chest - his biceps - his chest!!<br />
<br />
Dillon never saw his pecs jut quite like that. And even as he curled the 30s, at first struggling, he felt his arms give that same rewarding burning feel as he pushed through the discomfort. He dropped the 30s after 7 reps, and picked up the 40s. He found himself grunting like any bodybuilder as he powered through another 10 reps. His arms feeling tight, his shoulders - burning from the bench press - responding well as he grabbed the 30s again for some shoulder press.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh fuck yes,&quot; Dillon gasped, almost knocked off his feet from the sensation of his shoulders bulking up right then and there. It was almost sickly sweet, could&#39;ve well made him either vomit or cum in his pants thunderously.<br />
<br />
Before long, Dillon returned to the bench press, and found himself the subject of some gym hottie&#39;s affection. She walked by in a pair of tight shorts and a crop top that clung to her impressive bust, the blond giving him a look that said &quot;grow even bigger, and we could have some fun&quot;. Dillon did not need to be told twice.<br />
<br />
The growing lad leaped on to the bench press and increased the weight to 135, dropping the 25s in the process. He let out his loudest and deepest grunt yet as he hit bench press with a plate on each side, unaware of how deep and impressive his voice was sounding except in rare moments of reflection. He found himself cruising through it easier than he had any right to - so he upped the weight again to 155, grabbing the 10&#39;s off of the floor.<br />
<br />
He pumped his hips in the air as he felt the rewarding sensation of his pecs growing bigger and stronger.<br />
<br />
Such was Dillon&#39;s experience on the sheer rush of Muscle Tech-X. His dedication and urges powering him through the most intensive full body workout of his life. Every single workout seeming to make Dillon pop and grow a little bit more. Muscles he never even knew he had growing to prominence. He saw when he got up from the bench after doing 225 lbs - not even considering how odd it was to leap all the way to that weight! - that his jawline was stronger, he looked...he looked...!<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I...!&quot; Dillon didn&#39;t want to stop, on the off chance that doing so would end the effect of Muscle Tech-X. He felt a deep sense of satisfaction in how it had worked on him so far, &quot;I am HANDSOME!!&quot; He gave himself that cocky sneer he sometimes saw the jocks from school give themselves in the gym after they&#39;d completed a set. Dillon had never found himself hot before, but as he did he found his cock, waggling between his increasingly strong thighs and quads, leaking a bit of pre-cum and demanding some satisfaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Later...heheh, later.&quot; He tucked it up against his leg, grunting at the sensation, and then went about to racking 275 lbs for deadlifts. The pure sensation of lifting all that was enough to almost make him cum then and there, the testosterone releasing from his growing thighs and quads pumping his cock up to an even more dangerously aroused condition. He didn&#39;t even realize how many reps he was going for at that weight, just that he needed more weight.<br />
<br />
Clang, clang, 355 lbs deadlift being done for reps and Dillon felt like the biggest stud ever. Pushing the weight along with a strong erection in his pants, he was dimly aware of how tight the formerly loose pants were on his ass, his quads and thighs, even his calves feeling altogether too tight. He needed some bigger clothes. &quot;Fuck,&quot; Dillon murmured as the effect started to fade. He dropped the weight, having completed 10 reps.<br />
<br />
Ten reps. At 355 lbs. On deadlifts. After he could not even deadlift the bar before the Muscle Tech-X.<br />
<br />
Dillon almost pumped his hips into his hand when he saw his reflection. He looked like he had gone from the 120 lbs weakling he started as to almost a hundred pounds or more in just a workout. He almost felt sorry he&#39;d ever doubted the power this stuff had. His neck was thicker, his jaw stronger, his features almost too handsome and angular. He preened unapologetically, flexing his biceps and watching the proud eighteen inchers swell in front of his eyes. He&#39;d never seen his arms like this before...<br />
<br />
His chest made him gasp - how prominent it was, how toned the whole thing was, every facet - upper, lower, mid-chest - all were exquisitely toned and sized up. His abs were like a washboard, six etched and toned blocks on his stomach that he&#39;d never seen so impressive before. He realized when he tried to scratch his back he couldn&#39;t fully reach back any more. &quot;Heh...my back got too wide!&quot; He chuckled. <br />
<br />
Even his tan looked a bit better than usual, and Dillon wondered as he looked around...was she...? Yes, the blond who had so caught his attention was here. Still here. Still walking around in that daring number. Dillon realized he was really, truly horny. He couldn&#39;t exactly go back to his workout if he was this horned up. &quot;Heh, big jock, big libido...&quot; He whispered to himself, &quot;...Except I&#39;m still not exactly a jock. I&#39;m---I&#39;m the brightest fucker in my class, and now I&#39;ve got the best BODY in my class!&quot; He couldn&#39;t help but gloat a bit - after all, he finally felt good about himself.<br />
<br />
He thought about how he could go about this. Fuck, but he needed to get off. Dillon remembered how flirty Ms. Crauss had been with him. Looking over at the woman, the grown nerd saw her wave at him. He considered - maybe another dose could do him just as good, too...? Push him right over to the Tyson and Hans level of fitness. He needed 20 inch arms...!<br />
<br />
Dillon wiped off his forehead and thought about his options...</p>
