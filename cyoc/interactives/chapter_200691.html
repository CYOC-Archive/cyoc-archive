<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His new delicate fingers ran on keyboard as he was searching some informations about the hourglass, but found basically nothing. Only one note for somebody who bought it in something called Magic shop and who wrote that it complete changed her life. It was some woman who used the hourglass to turn herself into man and she was much happier with her new muscular body. And that she was finally successfull in her carreer - from secretary with low salary to rich director of the same company she worked before. It also said that all changes were reversible just by touching the hourglass after the sand inside changed it&#39;s colour completely. It ended with note that she returned the hourglass to the shop so other people could use it for improving their own lives. Stanley sighed. Poor luck, he didn&#39;t have any information about the hourglass before. Otherwise he wouldn&#39;t touch it with bare skin. Fred had his gloves so he wasn&#39;t affected. And Stanley trusted him that he&#39;ll change him back. And now he is stuck in this curvy body. He was suddenly disturbed by somebody opening door. Mellodic female voice shouted from door: &quot;Morning Stanley, I&#39;m here to shift you. Sorry for delay. My car had some problem with engine or what. How are...&quot; Young petite blonde froze as she noticed, that the person in chair definitely isn&#39;t her black muscular male colleague, but some booty black policewoman who looked a bit nervous. &quot;Ehm. Who are you?&quot; she asked circumspectly. Stanley was indeed very nervous. He thought that he will have some time before he meets his colleagues in this new form so he will prepare himself. But he forgot to watch a clock so his colleague - Sandra - stands here right now. He had to react somehow so he answered still unfamiliar with his new high pitched voice: &quot;Ummm. I&#39;m... Victoria Clifford, but friends  call me Viki. I&#39;m.. I&#39;m sister of Stanley... from police dept. in Iowa. Stanley had to leave because of...some family stuff. So he asked my head officer for help... and report it as... work stint for my CV. I will take his workshifts until he returns. And I should collect some...  experience.&quot; Sandra still frowned incredulously. &quot;Aaand...your badge? And ID?&quot; Stanley was prepared for this so he proved himself with new ID and his old police badge. Sandra examined it carefully and then her face changed to heartwarming expression. &quot;Oooh. Nice to meet you! I&#39;m glad that there will be another woman! Finally! I almost forgot how is it to have some female colleague as Roxy is such a tomboy and acts so unwomanly. I&#39;m Sandra. For friends Sandy.&quot; She giggled, hugged Stanley and cheekkissed him. It felt weird for him how their boobs pressed together and he immediately felt also tingling between legs. &quot;Umm, yeah... I hope I will fit in your team.&quot; he answered sheepishly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I swear that you will. We are good collective. Every Friday we go to local bowling bar to... release the pressure by throwing balls and having some drinks. It is tonight in fact! You should definitely come with us! So we can get to know you.&quot;<br />
Stanley was hesitant. &quot;Eeehm... I dunno. I... travelled light as it was in a hurry so... I don&#39;t have anything appropriate for any... companionship.&quot; Sandy just winked: &quot;Ohoho. Don&#39;t worry gal, my shift ends 8 PM, so we still have two hours to go for some quick shopping.&quot; Stanley thought about the situation.  In fact, he would need some clothes for new body as he is stuck in this form for a while so shopping would be necessary. And maybe shopping with another woman is better - he can use some advices from her. &quot;Okay. I&#39;d be glad to... go shopping with you.&quot; He smiled. &quot;Yeeeeeeeeeeeiii&quot; Sandra screamed excitedly. &quot;I am so glad that you are here Viki! I have a feeling that we will be good friends! I have to go to change myself so you are free to go home to have some rest after nightshift.&quot; &quot;Yeeah... it would be great...&quot; <br />
After Sandy left to the locker room, Stanley rushed to file cabinet for Fred&#39;s file and put it into his backpack. He wanted to make some investigation about Fred. Maybe he can lay a trap for him and get the hourglass earlier. Suddenly he heard Sandy&#39;s voice from locker room: &quot;Viki? Please can you gimme a hand here?&quot;  Stanley hanged back. He always had crush on Sandy so he was somewhat lured to see her half-naked. But on the other hand he would feel as an intruder. &quot;Heey, Viktoria! Pleeease.&quot; Stanley slowly approached the locker room still off-balanced by his new swaying hips only to see Sandra in her blue underwear - bra and thongs. Her perfect bubble butt and seductively poked -out hips made Stanley&#39;s body react immediately. His new womanhood became moist and warm and he suddenly felt unsteady on his legs. Sandra noticed him as she tried to reach hooks on her bra. &quot;Can you please help me with unhooking the bra. It got somehow stuck.&quot; &quot;S... sure thing. I&#39;ll try.&quot; He approached his crush. He felt his pussy reacting strongly. He stood right behind her. He unhooked her bra and Sandy put the bra to opened locker. As she turned around, Stanley could see her boobs and dark areolas on full display. He quickly turned his eyes away so she couldn&#39;t catch him staring. His pussy was practically dripping with juices. He was glad that he has dark trousers as his panties were soaking wet. <br />
&quot;Thank you!&quot;<br />
Sandra changed her bra for a black sports one and then took off her thongs. Stanley couldn&#39;t help himself and glanced at her trim bush. His nipples were erect like diamonds and his vagina was aching for touch. Stanley gasped and had to sit down. He crossed his legs as a woman. He was horny as hell. Policeman tried to say something smart but just mumbled something like: &quot;And you... know Stanley... well?&quot; Sandy put on black panties and stretched tight uniform trousers over her bubble butt. &quot;Yes. We are actually good friends. I am a bit surprised, that he didn&#39;t tell me about his &quot;family business&quot; face to face...&quot; &quot;Yeeah... it was... all sudden...&quot; Stanley mumbled. Sandy giggled. &quot;I know that you are his sister, but can you keep a secret?&quot; &quot;I guess...&quot; Stanley nodded.</p>
