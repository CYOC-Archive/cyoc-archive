<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Don gently lifted Chris' legs into the air and spread them wide, giving himself as much access as possible.  He was so turned on, and wanted some release of his own, but he was determined to give Chris the most soul-wrenching orgasm of his life.  He wasn't sure how much his friend could actually do for him in return given their size differences, but he didn't doubt Chris would do his best.  He certainly seemed eager to learn and Don was happy to teach him.  He rubbed his enlarged cock against the foot of the bed as he continued tonguing Chris and wondered just how much of a load he'd blow at his giant size.  Maybe he'd treat Chris to a cum shower before the night was out.<br />
<br />
Chris had returned to moaning the moment he felt Don’s wet mouth on him again.  He was getting desperate for release.   He wrapped a hand around his cock and stroked, on fire with such strong sensations coming from two sources now.  His moans picked up in intensity and he heard himself uttering “Oh god…oh god” with every breath.  The next thing that came from his mouth startled he and Don both.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me, Don.  Please fuck me!”  He stopped stroking his cock at the same time that Don lifted his head up to look at Chris.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure?” Don said.  “I just don’t think…” he looked down at his cock, hard as ever.  Under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t have hesitated.  But his erection was huge now, comparatively, and he doubted Chris could take him, especially given his virginal state.  He doubted many experienced guys could take him, either.  But he hated to disappoint Chris now.<br />
<br />
“Come on, Don, please, just be careful, take it slow.  You can do it.”  Chris had propped himself on his elbows now to better look at his giant lover.  He knew what he was asking was over the top, but he just had to take things another step.  His lust had taken over his common sense.  On some level, he was aware of that.  On every other level, he didn’t care.<br />
<br />
“Wait a second,” Don replied.  “Maybe there’s another way”.  He realized that he’d still been thinking like his 5’10” self instead of thinking like his 14-foot self.  He looked at his fingers.  Everything about him was bigger, which meant he had 10 ways of giving Chris what he wanted.  He figured the proportions of his middle finger would be about the proportions of what his endowment used to be, or it was close enough.  And it had a kind of flexibility that his dick could never have.  He grinned.  Chris was in for one helluva ride.<br />
<br />
Seeing his friend grin, Chris asked “What are you thinking?”<br />
<br />
“Just lie back and relax Chris,” Don replied.  “You’re gonna love this.”  With that, Don extended his middle finger to his mouth and engulfed it, coating it with generous saliva.  He teasingly drew it out around his lips while looking Chris in the eyes and smiling.  Chris looked wide-eyed at Don’s display, comprehension dawning and his excitement growing.  This was actually going to happen!<br />
<br />
Don moved his hand near Chris’ puckered opening, finger extended, and prodded gently.  Chris gasped at the sensation and tensed, then made an effort to relax.  He pulled his legs back towards his chest, freeing up Don’s other hand to stroke the smaller man’s abdomen and run his fingertips along Chris’ nipples.  He pushed his lubed finger further, still encountering some resistance, and massaged the area for the moment, giving Chris time to prepare.  Gradually, gently, he applied more pressure, moving his finger in slight circular motions as he slowly pushed it forward.  Chris’ eyes were clenched shut and his breathing came sharply.  Don bent forward, knee propped on the foot of the mattress that sagged under his weight, and kissed him gently, brushing the tip of Chris’ tongue with his own.  Chris opened his eyes to look up into Don’s beautiful face.  Don pulled away and smiled, getting a smile in return from Chris who relaxed under the gentle gaze.  Don took that moment to push further and felt his success.  Chris’ eyes widened as he felt Don’s finger finally penetrate him.  He moaned as the finger slid in further, just an inch or so, though it felt like more.<br />
<br />
Don stopped where he was, once again giving Chris a moment to adjust.  He touched his lips to Chris’ again and then kissed his way along his friend’s jawline to his neck and then up to his ear, whispering, “It’s ok, baby, it’s ok…” over and over.  He pushed further, encountering less resistance now.<br />
<br />
Chris’ initial discomfort was fading quickly.  The further Don went, the more he was able to relax into it.  He still couldn’t believe this was all happening, but was very glad it was.  Don was such a good lover.  He couldn’t imagine a better first-time with any man.  Then all his thoughts scattered in a small white explosion as Don’s fingertip brushed against his prostate.  A ragged gasp escaped his lips and he involuntary thrust his hips upward, plunging Don’s finger even deeper and intensifying the stimulation.  As it did, his gasp turned into a delighted cry.<br />
<br />
Don had moved his face back in front of Chris’ to watch his friend’s pleasure.  He slowly pumped his finger, gradually increasing his penetration and grinning as Chris’ moans increased.  He knew he was giving Chris an amazing experience and that turned him on almost as much as receiving similar attention would have.  He was just past his second knuckle now, maybe 6 inches or so from Chris’ perspective.  He pulled out most of the way and slowly slid back in, seeing in his peripheral vision that Chris’ toes were clenched tight.  Then another thought occurred to him.  As he withdrew his finger again, he curled it upward slightly, rubbing Chris’ channel even more directly.  His friend’s lustful yell told him when he’d hit the right spot and he massaged the area back and forth with his enlarged fingertip.<br />
<br />
All Chris could do was whimper in pleasure.  Words were beyond him.  The sensations he was experiencing made coherent thoughts impossible.  Don had brought about a rising, irresistible, delicious pressure in his gut that hovered just on the edge of bursting.  His groin was wet with precum, enough that it looked like he’d already climaxed.  He reached up to Don and pulled his head down, burying his tongue into his friend’s mouth.  Don took his free hand and wrapped what he could of it around Chris’ throbbing shaft.  He stroked once, twice along the slick erection, all the while continuing his internal massage.  He felt the erection swell slightly and knew Chris’ moment had finally come.<br />
<br />
Chris screamed his ecstasy into Don’s mouth, finally getting the release he so desperately needed.  Don’s finger continued plunging into him as his other hand continued stroking him, more urgently now, wringing moan after moan from Chris’ throat.  Hot liquid splashed along Chris’ chest as more eruptions burst from him. Don, who was moaning now, too, in sympathy to Chris’ orgasm, felt a splash against his lower jaw and saw tell-tale white beads in Chris’ hair.  Don never let up, extracting everything Chris had to give.<br />
<br />
Don lost track of time, but he knew the orgasm had been going on for a while.  Chris’ cock had stopped erupting, and was softening just slightly.  Chris’ breathing was still ragged and he was uttering soft moans, but he had crested the hill and was on his slow, delicious way back down.  Don let go of his cock, letting it slap wetly down on Chris’ stomach.  Don slowly, slowly pulled out of his friend.  When he’d fully extracted himself, he lay next to the bed, propped on one elbow, one leg bent for support.  He lightly rubbed his hand down Chris’ chest, feeling the slickness of sweat and cum.  Chris’s breathing had almost returned to normal and his eyes were closed.  Don thought for a moment that he might be unconscious.  He leaned his face in, concern starting to nag at him, when Chris slowly turned to face him and parted his eyelids.  He looked Don in the eyes, a lazy satisfied smile coming to his face.<br />
<br />
“Holy fuck,” he said to his giant friend, “I am so glad I’m gay.”</p>
