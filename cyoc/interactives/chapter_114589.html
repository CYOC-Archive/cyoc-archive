<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You can feel the warmth starting in your balls; and an urge; lust starting up inside your mind; but you resist. You focus your thoughts; magic was real; and you were going to learn how to use it. You were also a little curious about the fact that you were apparently going to learn some kind of sexual magic which got you started on a whole ton of different little ideas. Of course it also meant your whole life was about to change; probably drastically. I mean this place was bigger on the inside then it was on the outside. As someone intrigued by science and theology and other things of that kin; and was intelligent enough to realize the implications of all of this; your mind was a swarm with thoughts and ideas; using that to drive your resistance you easily pushed back the lust and desire that the enchantment could&#39;ve caused. <br />
<br />
You smiled as you realized you successfully resisted the magic and looked at the book. The young man seems impressed; &quot;all right so you really might be worthy of teaching after all.&quot; Waving for you to follow as he takes the veils from the wall and corks them once more and returns them to his pockets; he makes his way back to the steel steps leading up to the balcony that acted as the first floor. &quot;So welcome to the clockworks this will be our home from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our home? I already have a home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you don&#39;t the moment you stepped in here you left your world behind; believe me; you could go out there and seek out your family if you liked; they wouldn&#39;t remember you; neither would your friends or teachers; it would be like you never existed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mouth drops open; you had never expected your idea that your life would change forever was so accurate. You were sad too; you didn&#39;t necessarily have a great relationship with your family; you were naturally unusual and your intelligence was something they had often found intimidating; but still... they were your family. &quot;Will... will I never see them again?&quot; You ask feeling a little mournful.<br />
<br />
The young man turns to you and fixes you with a look; &quot;perhaps... perhaps you&#39;ll see them again soon; perhaps we&#39;ll even let them remember you again... perhaps... but you can never return; you&#39;ll be magic and eldritch and that world isn&#39;t a place for people who are magical and eldritch; it&#39;s nice to visit; but you certainly wouldn&#39;t want to live there.&quot; <br />
<br />
You nod; you could make sense of that; you had read plenty on witch hunts and knew enough to know that people who could have magical powers might perhaps end up dissected in a government lab somewhere... it wasn&#39;t like you lived in a world that was very accepting of what was different and unusual. Suddenly you are hit by the fact that you were thinking about worlds and he was speaking about worlds; as if there were more than one. &quot;Wait ... are there other worlds?&quot; You ask excited despite yourself. <br />
<br />
The Storyteller grins and nods, &quot;yeah you like that don&#39;t cha?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well ... it&#39;s fascinating! I mean I&#39;ve always wondered; with theories on multiple or parallel dimensions that sort of thing; wouldn&#39;t it be grand I thought... but I never considered that I might... might I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Travel to other worlds? Certainly; I do it all the time; I&#39;m a traveler; part of the gig.&quot; The Storyteller smiles; you&#39;ve followed him up the stairs by now and you both have arrived at a shaft by the front desk; as a lift lowers from the floor above; you wonder how many floors this place actually has; if it&#39;s bigger on the inside then the outside; you wonder if perhaps there are dozens or even countless floors. You also wonder if the clockworks isn&#39;t a world of it&#39;s own in a sense. <br />
<br />
&quot;I would love to see another world.&quot; You whisper as you both enter the lift and the Storyteller moves the lever inside to the appropriate floor; from what you can see on the lever you would guess the place doesn&#39;t have countless floors; but it certainly had quite a few. As the lift goes up you turn to the Storyteller; &quot;so if this is my home now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have your own apartment; I&#39;m taking you there now.&quot; The Storyteller grins, turning to look towards the door of the lift. &quot;You can study that little book I gave you; and you&#39;ll find that it describes the art of incantation, ritual, and gesture. Being a novice a lot of the magic of the 100 Magical Bondage Arts is ritual work; as you gain skill and ability you can move onto just incantation and gesture; eventually just gesture and if you get really good you learn the instant magic tricks; like that pinky thing I did earlier; but that&#39;s a lot of skill and training and time to get to that point.&quot; You nod listening reverently as the lift reaches the chosen floor. The door lifts instead of opening and past it you can see into what appears a finely decorated suite of apartments. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t just a one bedroom place with enough of the furnishings and appliances to live comfortably in; it was from what you could see a full-blown house; even with stairs and you were certain plenty of bedrooms. As you walk into it and see more of it; the more you feel like you&#39;ve been given an entire mansion. You are astounded by the windows that each open up to different scenes; some are from what you would say is the second floor of the clockworks; showing the street below; but others open to beaches; some to great woods; others appear to be hanging high in the sky over mountain landscapes. As you come to these windows and crack them open you can actually smell ocean breezes and the cool mountain air; you are only a little nervous thinking for a moment that if you fell out of any of them who knows where you might end up?<br />
<br />
The Storyteller leads you to a room that appears to be full of books; and there are tables with beakers and veils and many different tools for working with chemistry and some of the tools suggested to your mind alchemy as well. &quot;You should start with the book,&quot; the storyteller suggested as he gives you a pat on the shoulder and turns; you can hear him leave the place as you take another look around. The apartments you had been granted were incredible; but what to do?</p>
