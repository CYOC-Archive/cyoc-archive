<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Doctor Stein sat quietly at his desk reviewing over the paperwork that was coming in as Animalia and Horizon enjoyed &quot;Pride Month.&quot; It was something that played to a fair amount of sentiment that both had tried to help and be comforting for. It wasn&#39;t easy, and technically they didn&#39;t get a lot of business, often because how some politicians then deliberately marketed Animalia as a cure for things like homosexuality and transgender issues. The image of Animalia being used to force heterosexuality was one that made it difficult to reach out to that community. Some did join, but ultimately for other reasons. Some had been injured and wanted to regain their mobility and some were part of the &quot;furry&quot; community that just wanted to be, at least, part animal.<br />
<br />
However, as he was reviewing his paperwork, he came across one of the reports and slides that had shown some of the successes in the program and bargains that were offered as part of &quot;Pride Month.&quot; It was a request that had come in with Project Hermaphroditus and one of Horizon&#39;s other projects, which they had felt would help them reach out to those that did feel to be transgender but were worried over the cost of surgery and other issues. From the request paperwork, Doctor Stein had guessed that some of that was part of the reasoning, though the biggest surprise was that they wanted to have the conversion done in MRI machines. That wasn&#39;t a bad request, but it was unexpected, which Doctor Stein had told them during a consultation at Horizon.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;What you&#39;re asking for is rather unique... most people coming to convert have never asked to go through an MRI machine during conversion,&quot; Doctor Stein said to the couple that sat before him.<br />
<br />
Both people looked relatively pleasant and polite, but the way both were dressed was rather dull and lacking color or anything else. The male wore a dull gray polo shirt and gray-tan slacks while the woman wore a grayish white shirt that was matched by a grey skirt. There was little in how either dressed that would stand out or attract attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of it is just to see on what all happens,&quot; Bix answered calmly, &quot;maybe see on what might trigger something... more... exciting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m sure Horizon would learn something from this as well, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot; Inex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes,&quot; Doctor Stein admitted, &quot;as it would help us note the changes in internal organs through the conversion... and with Project Hermaphroditus would help us explain how that all ultimately works. I&#39;m just saying that it&#39;s not something we&#39;ve had requested before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most have probably had lots of adventure in their lives and never felt empty at missing out on things,&quot; Inex commented, &quot;as a lot of the Animalia Ambassadoria videos indicate that Animalians enjoy fun and sport and lots of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein nodded and guessed that this couple had some other reasons for converting and converting in this way, though he wasn&#39;t good enough on psychology to really know on how well it could work. The Animalia Virus could heal physical injuries and the breeding instinct had created an impact that homosexuals who had become Animalians became bisexual as Animalians. But he wasn&#39;t sure if there was anything in the Animalia Virus that made people more &quot;exciting&quot; in the way it&#39;d been described here. Largely he felt that it had reinforced things that were already there, and the way the request was being made, it seemed like Bix and Inex were looking to change something in themselves that went beyond just their physical form.<br />
<br />
&quot;They do... but I must warn you that I can&#39;t say with complete certainty as to whether or not the Animalia Virus would have the desired mental effects that you want,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke, &quot;it can do a lot with regard to physical changes... the effects on the mind and personality are often different and not every new Animalian responds in the same way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d be willing to give it a shot,&quot; Bix said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If only to get a shot at a more... romantic life and see what it&#39;s like than just being platonic friends with everyone,&quot; Inex added, &quot;can you do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In theory,&quot; Doctor Stein nodded, &quot;we&#39;d have to do the conversion at Horizon Light, as they&#39;d actually have the MRI machines to do it... but we can arrange that.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It took some time, but Doctor Stein remembered being able to arrange the appointment with Horizon Light as part of the conversion. He would come with Bix and Inex to provide for the shots and then join the main doctors who would run the MRI machines. That was then the next thing that Doctor Stein thought over as looked over the paperwork, and the printed screens that were available to Horizon.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Things seem to be progressing quickly,&quot; one of the medical doctors reported and pointed to the images that came across the screens for each MRI machine&#39;s activity.<br />
<br />
&quot;All conversions progress quickly once they start,&quot; Doctor Stein explained as he looked to one screen as it showed a Human skull begin to push forward into a more equine shape and was complete with changing teeth to fit an herbivorous diet. &quot;That&#39;s part of what makes the Animalia Virus as &quot;effective&quot; as it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
They watched across the two sets of screens as the MRI machines ran and covered through the changes. There were many of the sorts of changes that were often expected from a conversion from Human to Animalian. With Bix and Inex both becoming Horse Animalians, this included the lengthening of the feet and the merging of the toes and nails to leave one hoof at the end of a one toed foot, like all horses. The fingers thickened and the nails became more hoof-like but didn&#39;t merge. It was something that had been observed with all hooved Animalians in that the hands often didn&#39;t match the feet with regards to the number of digits and retain the Human number of five. Though the finger bones were also thick enough and strong enough to support more weight and thus function like what the mundane animal would have in a quadrupedal stance. This, however, was all part of what was to be expected and was normal in these conversions. The main part of the test was seeing in how new secondary sex characteristics developed.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is an interesting way of observing things,&quot; one of the other doctors spoke, as he watched another screen then showing more vertebra forming in the neck and the existing bones there growing larger, &quot;and it&#39;s not painful?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Animalian has ever complained of pain,&quot; Doctor Stein answered, &quot;in fact there are some that even report being turned on by the end of the transformation... and the same goes for uplifted Animalians as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
They then watched the two screens and then followed Bix and Inex&#39;s transformations. Then they were able to see various aspects of this process change that was the key part, and that was in the anatomical changes that related to Project Hermaphroditus. With one two areas in the abdomen were seen to glow with a brighter color than was normal and with the other that was between the legs. They then watched as those areas began to divide and split into two more. With one they then descended toward the legs and the other moved up through the scrotum and into the abdomen area.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s how the hermaphroditic change works,&quot; Doctor Stein mused as he watched things further develop, &quot;in one the testes then spawn the new ovaries and they move up into the body and in the other the ovaries spawn the new testicles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That then helps for development of other things?&quot; the first medical doctor asked as they continue to look into things.<br />
<br />
&quot;From what we figure, for a woman, the clitoris would enlarge to become the penis,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke, &quot;while the vaginal opening would then be entirely new for a man becoming a hermaphrodite and would only have the reproductive opening. It&#39;d mean that the former male would still need to stand to pee while the former female would have to sit down and that would be about the only way we could tell the gender of origin for the new hermaphroditic Animalian... but from what we can see here, it doesn&#39;t look like we can confirm that here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid that a lot of this is the best we can do with the equipment,&quot; the second medical doctor spoke, &quot;and the level of technology. If you&#39;re wanting something more detailed... you might have to consult Dr. McCoy as his medicine was far more advanced than anything we have in this century.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein nodded, &quot;true... though we did get a lot of helpful information with what we could see and test. I&#39;m not sure what Bix and Inex would get from the images... but it is what they requested.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others then nodded as Doctor Stein then turned to pick up the clothes that would be needed as the medical doctors began turning off the equipment. He then entered the room as Bix and Inex were brought out from the devices that did the MRIs at Horizon Light for Animalians, and particularly large ones. For the moment they were fairly typical American Quarter Horse Animalians, with the obvious exception of the hermaphrodite genes. To a degree a lot of they were covered in brown fur, though Bix&#39;s lower legs and forearms actually darkened into black while Inex lacked that shading. Both had reasonably wide hips, which would be more than enough bear children, though narrower than female Horse Animalians and the same also applied for their shoulders. They were wider than female Horse Animalians but a bit narrower than male Horse Animalians. The places where they likely matched mono gendered Animalians would be in the rest of their equipment with generous breasts and sheathed penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that will conclude the tests,&quot; Doctor Stein announced, &quot;the Horizon Light staff are working on allowing for the copies to be made for our records and yours...&quot;<br />
<br />
The two new Horse Animalians nodded as they sat up and looked to each other. As they did so, they both got off the beds and looked to each other with widening eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look amazing!&quot; Bix said to Inex and feeling hir penis rise up to full attention rather quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do you!&quot; Inex added as hir own penis also rapidly became erect from its sheath.<br />
<br />
They were about to step toward each other when Doctor Stein cut them off, &quot;while I&#39;m sure you may wish to explore... but Horizon Light doesn&#39;t allow for sex in the hospital. I do have your clothes for you, though. They should fit your new sizes.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Of course, the sudden rush of sexual attraction had caught both Bix and Inex by surprise and let them make up for years of a lack of action, but Doctor Stein hoped that things would be fine for them. There was nothing that would indicate Regressive Hypersexuality in them and that was good. Doctor Stein merely kept his focus on the documents and images as they would help Horizon explain how the transformation progressed and worked. In the meantime, he Bix and Inex were happy together.</p>
