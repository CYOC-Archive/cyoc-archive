<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Terry, we can&#39;t leave him like this.&quot; She continued.<br />
<br />
Terry pulled out the camera and stared at it. Marco was Mr. Hudson in this version of reality, just before he was a bombshell of a teacher, now he was a veritable muscle man that he dreamed of on the movie screen. But just before all this Marco was... Marco, a guy he loved hanging with and... Well... <br />
<br />
Terry looked at Kelly, at Marco, and then back at the camera. He could feel himself sweat and grow uncomfortable as he remembered Marco&#39;s brawny form in front of him, the rippling muscles that forced the clothing to twist and wrap around them. He clenched the camera as hard as he could, afraid of dropping it as he thought about how Marco was just a regular student, to a veritable sex icon teacher, to an even more handsome teacher.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let&#39;s-&quot; The school bell rung, bringing everyone&#39;s attention to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit..!&quot; Marco growled, looking around as they could hear the school become active again.<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t have enough time, those brats are gonna be out here soon and we can&#39;t flash me or else they might get caught up.&quot; He grumbled.<br />
<br />
Terry gulped, breath haggard as he heard Marco&#39;s deep voice speak frustrated. He clutched the camera as his palms began to sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- uh, I think...&quot; Terry breathed, closing his eyes and holding the camera close to himself, worried about the delicateness of the situation.<br />
<br />
Kelly placed her hand on his, and Terry looked to see his friend smiling gently as she easily took the camera out of his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s not cause more panic, shall we? Look, if we stay here, things are gonna get weirder. Mr. Hudson,&quot; Kelly paused, as Marco shot her a glare. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marco, I mean, it&#39;s gonna have to be either me or you holding onto this thing till we get out of class so we can change you back, hopefully. Terry, I trust you, but, we gotta be careful with this thing, I mean, who <I>knows</I> what could have happened if you dropped it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marco thought, placing his hand over his chin, but nodded sagely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess that makes sense. Won&#39;t it be strange if one of us is carrying the camera though? I mean, they&#39;re likely gonna ask us to take photos of them since we are... <I>were</I> the school year book team.&quot; He explained, flexing a meaty bicep for emphasis.<br />
<br />
&quot;That, I think, sums it up right....&quot; Kelly nodded.<br />
&quot;Which is exactly why you should hold onto it, Marco.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both men looked at her quizzically, before she sighed and pushed her brown hair strands back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think about it, if you have it, you can just say no to people like the big strong teacher you are,&quot; She noted sarcastically.<br />
&quot;And once the coast is clear you can meet back up with us, we&#39;ll do some flashes, and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get you back to normal.&quot; She finished, waving a hand off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but what if- What if he can&#39;t? What if he&#39;s like this forever, or like, he accidentally snaps someone?&quot; Terry piped up, rubbing the back of his raven head.<br />
<br />
Kelly shook her head in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better him than us, at least we&#39;re the normal ones, Marco&#39;s going to have to deal with this till things are okay. I mean, this thing is... A lot. It turned him into a girl teacher, now this, and Mrs. Hudson thinks he&#39;s her husband when, fyi, he was our friend like a second ago.&quot; She looked up at the bulky man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like it either, buddy, but we need to do what we can. Think you can handle being a big guy for a little while longer?&quot; Marco gazed below him to see Kelly&#39;s face. He looked to the ground, folded his arms and huffed, kicking the dirt absentmindedly. He could hear the screams of kids getting ready to change periods. Wouldn&#39;t be long now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, fine, yeah I think I can do it.&quot; He growled. Kelly smiled, passing him the camera, and patting his hirsute hands as they gripped it tightly.<br />
&quot;But only till we get me back into me... I like this change but... I don&#39;t think I like really being <I>like</I> this forever with Liv- Ah, Mrs. Hudson.&quot; He shivered at repeating her name.<br />
<br />
As the doors began to open for teenagers to switch periods, Marco put his free hand on his hips as Kelly pulled Terry closer to their huddle.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s already halfway through the day, I got about 3 more periods before I&#39;m free to head home. What about you Terry?&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang, I got the last 4, and practice...&quot; Terry replied.<br />
&quot;Wait, practice... That&#39;s with...&quot; Kelly noted, Marco&#39;s eyes gleamed:<br />
<br />
&quot;Me!&quot; He nearly shouted, before realizing his volume and clearing his throat to lower his volume. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I think, but didn&#39;t we have Coach Paula...?&quot; Terry said.<br />
&quot;Probably, before Marco became... Marco?&quot; Kelly shrugged, pushing her hair back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then its settled, Marco, you&#39;re gonna have to deal with the day, and when practice comes up, you and Terry can just change yourself back.&quot; Kelly responded.<br />
<br />
Marco furrowed his brows, before once again placing a hand on his waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, one question, genius. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s gonna look a little weird for the school history teacher slash gym coach to be with a student all alone during practice?&quot; He posed.<br />
<br />
Kelly shrugged, as she checked her nails. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a jock, you two can figure it out, after all can&#39;t you like, I dunno, hit the gym or something like your wife said?&quot; She smugly smiled, as Marco&#39;s face blushed red and Terry coughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I get it, but obviously if we try to do anything crazy, we&#39;re going to get some crazy results. You wanna end up being a baby or something?&quot; She spoke up, this time with further attitude. Marco shook his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;No ma&#39;am.&quot;<br />
&quot;Better, now let&#39;s move out team. Hike or whatever it is you guys say.&quot; She ended, patting Terry twice on the shoulder as the student body traversed outside to their location. <br />
<br />
Kelly looked over her shoulder as Marco was still confused looking at the camera, before he looked at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, be cool.&quot; She mouthed, just as Terry turned to see Marco, still blushing, and quickly turned back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be cool, yeah, okay.&quot; Marco huffed, waiting for the two to become specks on his vision before marching into the school building once again. Unlike his previous changes, his gait was straight and filled with confidence as he strode into the halls. Students looked at him and parted like it was the Red Sea, allowing him a wide berth the likes of which he never enjoyed as a student.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mr. Hudson...!&quot; Jeered a female student who waved at him, her friend cheerfully whispered in her ear as he made time to wave back at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Allison!&quot; Marco spoke, voice professional and clear. He could have sworn he heard one of the girls squeal as he continued to march through the hall and turn the corner past the main office. He could hear a wolf whistle as he stopped and proceeded inside to where the noise was coming from, only to be met with the Secretary who was filing papers on her desk. She was a modest lady, a bit older with purple framed glasses and a conservative orange cardigan over her blouse. Her skin was slightly tanned, but her graying orange streaks belied her youthful glow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well someone&#39;s going to get suspended for publicly indecency again,&quot; She noted, casually greeting him.<br />
&quot;And a good day to you, my beautiful flower Doris.&quot; Marco replied smoothly.<br />
Doris laughed, passing him a paper. &quot;Ya got jokes, Hudson. There&#39;s the schedule for the week like you asked me, be seeing you for the staff luncheon on Tuesday?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marco placed the Camera down on the counter as he winked and upped the charm. <br />
&quot;If we got those sandwiches I like, I just might marry you, Doris.&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t look at him as she went back to filing, but made a distinct chuckle as she did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the Missus would kill me with just a look. I got your special order, same as always you health junkie.&quot;<br />
Marco laughed earnestly and pretended to blow a kiss. &quot;Another time, my love!&quot; He said loudly, in a Shakespearean accent as he turned on his heels and began to walk away. Doris looked over her shoulder and watched intently as Marco did so, shaking her head at the loss of such a catch.<br />
<br />
Marco continued his march out and, as if on autopilot, turned back towards the main path and jogged up the stairs as students poured like water. He folded the paper and placed it into his chest pocket as the students called out amidst the smaller chaos.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yooo, Mr. H!&quot;<br />
&quot;Mr. Hudson, whazzup!&quot;<br />
<br />
Students greeted him almost endlessly, and the inner Marco was lapping it up as he handed out hi-fives and handshakes. His chest was jostling, the pecs giving him a hefty bounce with each step as he felt a slight burn the more he climbed up the steps before reaching the second floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess I <I>can</I> get used to this...&quot; Marco said, thriving on the attention. &quot;Marcus has it all...&quot;<br />
<br />
He stopped by an office door, only to peer at the plated name and realize it was his own office: Sanctuary at last. Feeling in his pocket, Marco fished out a gold key and unlocked the door as he cleared his throat. He opened the door and stepped in, blasted with the crisp smell of papers in the room and the scent of a protein shake that had long since been drunken out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaaalright...&quot; He said, placing the camera down and unloosening his tie. He fished out the paper Doris had given him and looked at the contents.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Gym class is next... at 1.&quot; He looked towards the digital clock that read 12:45. Fifteen minutes.<br />
<br />
He looked down at the desk and saw the camera peering back at him, mentally flinching as he remembered the artifact had changed him from a student, to a busty teacher, to the man he was now. And he could change once again if he wanted to. He had fifteen minutes to do as he pleased... Or he could continue like Kelly told him to and hopefully have someone else help him out. There was also the temptation of toying with the camera, if it could make him like this, it could take him to even greater heights, to an even bigger, better, <I>stronger</I> body. That is, of course, if he was willing to deal with the gamble itself.<br />
<br />
Marco weighed his options, and licked his lips...</p>
