<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake was a mess during gym class, and he did not stay there for very long.  He was very klutzy, and kept tripping and falling.  His arms and legs ached, and felt different. They seemed too long and gangly, and his efforts to control his unfamiliar limbs was an uncoordinated disaster.  His feet ached, pinched by his tight shoes.  He tripped and fell several times, trying to run without stepping on his curled toes.  It didn&#39;t help that his hair was too long, and kept getting in his eyes.  He didn&#39;t remember his hair being that long, but he decided that he would need to get a hair cut after school.  His groin felt odd, too.  His testicles felt constricted, like someone was pulling on his scrotum, pressing the testicles against his body.  He guessed he must have injured them somehow when he fell, and he really wished that he had worn a cup today.  After his last spectacular flop on the ground, the gym teacher had enough of his behavior.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake, what is wrong with you today? &quot; asked the gym instructor.  He looked at Jake strangely, carefully looking over his body.  &quot;You don&#39;t look so good.  Are you sick or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, &quot; said Jake.  His voice sounded different.  A little squeaky, with a higher pitch, like when we began to go through puberty.  He wondered if he was beginning to have another growth spurt.<br />
<br />
The gym teacher continued to stare at him. &quot;What is that on your neck?  You know how I feel about jewelry in my gym.  Go back to the locker room, and take that off right now! &quot; said the gym teacher angrily.<br />
<br />
Jake reached up and touched the medallion around his neck.  He had almost forgotten that it was there.  He thought that it was well hidden in his shirt.  But reaching down, it felt like more of the chain was exposed, like his neck had grown longer or his shirt had gotten smaller.  Jake sighed, and limped to the locker room to remove his necklace.<br />
<br />
When he entered the room, the first thing he did was sit down on a bench and take off his shoes.  His feet were really hurting now, and he could barely fit his feet in the shoes even with his toes curled.  His feet pressed tightly against the sides of his shoes, and it required quite a bit of effort to pull them off his feet.  He was surprised at how large his feet were.  They looked longer and wider, possibly swollen.  Freeing his feet seemed to enhance their size.  It almost looked like they were growing before his eyes.  <br />
<br />
He watched as the lip of his socks were slowly pulled down below his ankle.  He reached down to pull the tight socks off his feet, and when he looked at the socks in his hands he saw that they, too, had changed. They were larger, but with longer, thinner, and more slender fingers.  And they were getting larger before his eyes, too.  He suddenly realized that all of his clothes felt too small.  He stood up and ran to a mirror behind the next aisle of lockers, careful to walk on the balls of his feet as they continued to grow.<br />
<br />
He was surprised by what he saw in the mirror.  He was definitely taller.  His previously loose white shirt was now pulled up over his midriff, revealing a tight flat stomach.  His shorts were pulled tightly against groin, stretched by his wide hips.  He couldn&#39;t see his testicles, but the outline of his dick was prominent.  It seemed small in comparison to the rest of his body.  <br />
<br />
His thighs were longer and thicker.  Their wide diameter caused them to be pinched tightly by the cuff of his shorts.  He reached down to touch them, and felt that they were smooth, completely devoid of body hair.   He could feel them getting bigger beneath his hands.<br />
<br />
His shirt pulled tightly against his chest, and he saw his pectoral muscles bulge.  He pulled off his tight shirt, getting it tangled in his long hair.  When he finally freed it off of his head, he saw two small puffy mounds slowly expanding on his chest.  His nipple and areola still looked normal - short in length with a small diameter - but the tissue beneath them slowly swelled until he developed  nice B-cup size breasts.<br />
<br />
His face now ached, and he closed his eyes and winced in pain as the changes increased in  intensity there.  When he opened his eyes we was shocked to see that his face had become a duplicate of Gina&#39;s,  right down to her shoulder length blonde hair and green eyes.  Looking in the mirror, he saw that actually his whole body now looked like a duplicate of Gina.  He dropped his shorts down, and confirmed his worst fear - his dick was gone and he now had a tight shaved vagina.  He was still staring at his nude naked body, when he heard someone speak.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake, are you in here?&quot; said a familiar male voice.<br />
<br />
Jake tried his best to cover his nudity, but his clothes were way too small and he couldn&#39;t find a towel.<br />
<br />
The figure turned around the corner and stepped forward, revealing someone who looked remarkably like  him.  Well, like his old body.  The boy was wearing a baggy female basketball player&#39;s uniform, holding the shorts up in his hands to keep them from falling off.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, it happened to you too, huh?  Just what I thought, &quot; said Gina, now in his body.</p>
