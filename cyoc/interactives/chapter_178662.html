<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Mary opened the door she and her parents found ten cardboard boxes piled just outside with a shipping label addressed to their house taped to each of them. The three of them informed the other two about the arrival of the packages and got Mark to bring them inside, her large body making it a simple task. Once the boxes were brought inside Mary cut the packing tape with one of her claws and checked on their contents. The box had ten tubs, identical to the one that had arrived earlier, filled with the dragon shaped candies.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, now that we have a large supply of candies, I have something to propose&quot; Robert&#39;s voice took on a serious tone as she addressed the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we ought to find somewhere else to live, this house is way too small for even just the five of us so if we want to keep growing this family of ours we&#39;ll need to find, or maybe even build, a place that can contain more dragons.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got a point dad, I can barely move around this place without breaking stuff and we&#39;re not even sure if I&#39;m as big as the candies can make people.&quot; Said the feral dragoness.<br />
<br />
The others also saw the logic behind Robert&#39;s suggestion and they all agreed to wait until nightfall before leaving, to minimize the chances of being seen. That gave them time to pack up any supplies from the house they might need, as well as time to tie up the two loose ends that remained, Melissa and Robert&#39;s youngest child, Jenny, and Gabriel&#39;s wife.<br />
<br />
Mary, Melissa and Robert went upstairs to Jenny&#39;S room, curious as to how she had remained oblivious to all the noise that they had been making. Through the door they could hear muffled sounds, and when knocking failed to get her attention Mary opened the door to find that Jenny was watching videos on her computer with her headphones on. Since her computer desk faced the opposite wall from the door, Jenny didn&#39;t notice as her sister and parents entered her room, her volume so high she couldn&#39;t hear their heavy footsteps as they approached her.<br />
<br />
 Despite their new form, Melissa and Robert were still the same people deep down and didn&#39;t want their youngest daughter, who was still a minor, to be part of their sexual escapades, but still wanted her to experience the joys the candies brought. With those thoughts in mind they had gotten Mary to cut a small piece off one of the red candies, hoping that if she ate it she would still transform but not be overwhelmed by lust like they were.<br />
<br />
When they were standing right behind Jenny, Mary pulled down her headphones and said<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sis, we&#39;ve got something important to show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t give a sh- WHAT THE HELL!?&quot; Jenny screamed when she swivelled her chair around and saw the creature behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep calm honey, it&#39;s just your sister and your parents.&quot; Melissa said with one of her heads, attempting to calm her daughter down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom? What&#39;s going on?&quot; Jenny cried.<br />
<br />
The three dragonesses explained what had happened, skimming over the more raunchy details, before bringing her downstairs to see Mark and Gabriel. During the entire ordeal, Jenny was wide-eyed, barely able to comprehend what she was hearing and seeing. After her family finished, she took a minute to take it all in before she spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;So my parents and sister fused together and now share a body, my brother is now my sister and a giant dragon, our neighbour is a dragon as well and we&#39;re going to go find a place to house all the people you&#39;re planning on turning into more dragons. This is so much to take in, I feel like I&#39;m going insane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is one last thing, we have a candy for you, if you don&#39;t want to take it that&#39;s fine, but it might help you adjust to all of this easier. &quot; As Melissa said this Mary held out the candy piece to her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck it, I&#39;m still not entirely convinced that this isn&#39;t some bizarre dream.&quot; Jenny grabbed the candy and tossed it into her mouth.<br />
<br />
Her arms and hands turned into red scaled dragon claws, the changes spreading up to her elbow before stopping. Similar changes happened to her legs, her socks tearing apart as her feet became talons. A thin dragon tail grew in, sliding down one of her pant legs. Her pupils became slitted and small patches of red scales appeared on her cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that felt really cool. I can see why you want more people to feel like that now. Why am I not completely a dragon like you though?&quot; The newly transformed dragon-girl asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We gave you a smaller piece of candy to see what happened, if you want we can give you more, but not until you turn eighteen.&quot; Melissa explained <br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, I&#39;m not sure if i would want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus you&#39;re the only one of us who can still pass as human if you wear the right clothes, so if we need to buy stuff in person we can have you get it.&quot; Robert added.<br />
<br />
As Jenny got used to her new body and began helping Mark and with packing, Gabreil explained the plan for how to explain to her wife why she was going to be gone until dark, when she could sneak over there and try to convert her.<br />
<br />
With Mary&#39;s help Melissa managed to call Gabriel&#39;s wife and tell her that after her husband had checked on the noise, which was just a loud movie, he got an emergency call from work and had to head in. The woman was a little confused about why her husband wasn&#39;t the one telling her, but bought the story, meaning that Gabriel didn&#39;t have to worry about her calling the police.<br />
<br />
The six dragons spent the next several hours packing, at one point the adults let Jenny go back up to her room to watch videos while they had sex. Eventually it got dark enough that Gabriel felt that she could sneak over to her house and talk to her wife. Grabbing the original tub of candies, she threw on a large black jacket and slipped one house over, unlocking the door and stepping inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gabe? Is that you dear?&quot; The voice of her wife, Tatiana, came from the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah honey, it&#39;s me though there&#39;s something I have to talk to you about.&quot; The dragoness responded, trying to make her voice sound like it did before her transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your voice sounds weird, is something wrong?&quot; Tatiana gets up from the couch and heads for the entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really &#39;wrong&#39; but I want you to promise me you won&#39;t freak out right away and let me explain.&quot; As Gabriel says this her wife turns the corner and the dragoness takes off the jacket, revealing her naked body to the woman.<br />
<br />
Several emotions cross Tatiana&#39;s face as she beholds the quad-breasted dragoness before her, before it settles on a neutral expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright dear, explain&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, I mean, I know I asked you not to freak out, but I was kinda expecting you to still freak out a little. I mean, I don&#39;t even look like I used to, how do you even know it&#39;s me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Despite your appearance, I can still recognize you from your mannerisms. I have no doubt you&#39;re the person I married.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabriel then went on to explain what happened when she went to check on the noises coming from next door, and their plan to find a spot with enough space and privacy for more dragons. She then handed the tub of candies over to Tatiana the question clear.</p>
