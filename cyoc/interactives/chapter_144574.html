<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie watched as her daughter and Jack returned, followed closely by Lilith, Claudia, Mika and Baba Yaga. Frowning she watched as Katie gave her father a shy smile before hugging the teen. “Okay Jack,” she growled. “What kind of bullshit lines have you been feeding her.”<br />
<br />
“Damn Kellie,” he he groaned. “We just talked that’s it. You have to relax.”<br />
<br />
Kellie snorted in disgust as her daughter and her fiancé came to join her. “Mom we just talked,” she said quietly. “That was it, me and dad just talked.” Kellie just frowned as she looked between her daughter and her former lover. “That’s probably what he wants you to think,” she grumbled. “He’s always the smooth talker, but in the end he always wants something. Probably why your demon mom over there took her as her own.”<br />
<br />
“Watch your tongue child,” Lilith warned. “It was your actions that necessitated this. You are to show me the proper respect.”<br />
<br />
Katie and her friends watched as Kellie turned away from Lilith as she once again began to argue with Jack. “Geez Kat,” Mika whispered. “How bad did your parents relationship turn out for them to argue like that.”<br />
<br />
“Wish I knew,” Katie shrugged. “Right now their acting like petulant kids. Talking with them separately their fine but you put them together and yeesh. By the way how did things go with Lilith?”<br />
<br />
“Well she’s evil,” Claudia stated. “But this is different from Morgan. I don’t think she wants to destroy us so much as she wants the darkness and light to kind of balance eachother out.”<br />
<br />
“Kinda got the same vibe,” Claudia added. “She’s not like Morgan. I don’t think she wants to destroy the light, she just wants to make the darkness stronger, not that that’s a good thing but hopefully it means she won’t be trying to kill us, unless we do something to her son.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded as she continued to look at her teenage parents argue. “I guess that’s better than before,” she sighed. “Now if only these two would stop acting like kids on the playground.”<br />
<br />
“Or like Mika and Claudia back in the day,” Kellie giggled as she looked at her fiancé. “I mean seriously these two obviously liked eachother at one point. Why else would they be fighting like this?”<br />
<br />
As Katie and her friends watched they were unaware of the infant Morgan paying close attention to the situation. While the child could not understand nor remember her old life, she could see how Jack and Kellie were acting. The two teens were acting like petulant children and the tiny infant now thought that maybe that was how they needed to be until they could come to an understanding. Morgan’s magic now reached out for the two, causing them to begin to glow.<br />
<br />
Katie and Lilith were the first to notice something was amiss with Jack and Kellie as a soft white light began to emanate from the two. As they watched closely they gasped in shock as they could see both teens faces begin to soften.<br />
<br />
“What is the meaning of this,” Lilith yelled as she watched her son go from 16 to 15. “Which one of you is casting a spell on my son?”<br />
<br />
Katie and the others looked confused as they held up their hands defensively. “Whoa it s not us,” teen Katie stated. “Us neither,” Claudia added as they looked at eachother. Lilith scanned the group carefully, one of them was transforming Jack useing some very powerful magic. Focusing her will she tried to pin down who it was, narrowing her eyes as she glared angrily at the tiny infant cradled in Marilyn O’Tooles arms. “Morgan,” she growled.<br />
<br />
Jack and Kellie had been arguing furociously as they began to grow younger. At first neither one had noticed anything until they both paused, realizing the other looked different. “Hey what’s happening,” Jack exclaimed as he became 13. “Kellie what are you doing?”<br />
<br />
“Me,” the honey haired 13 exclaimed. “I’m not doing anything. I thought it was you.”<br />
<br />
The two young teens carefully looked over themselves as they grew younger. Their clothing had begun to become baggy on the two of them as they gradually became shorter. As they now fidgeted in their oversized clothing, Lilith stepped forward, a scowl on her face. “Change them back,” he hissed. “I will not have that child harming my son.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie fearfully stepped in front of their daughter as Lilith held out her outstretched arm. “Wait don’t do this,” Katie shrieked. “Don’t hurt our daughter.”<br />
<br />
A tense stand-off now took place as Katie, her friends, and her mother’s teenage friends now stood in front of Morgan as Lilith prepared a powerful spell to destroy them. “Stop,” Kellie screamed, her voice cracking as she became 12.<br />
<br />
The group paused as they turned once more to the rapidly regressing couple. Jack and Kellie couldn’t be older than 12 now as they fiddled with their now oversized clothing. The two former teenagers glanced at their preteen bodies, noticing that not only were they shorter but most of the gifts of puberty had been wiped away. Jack was now just a young boy, his face soft and round while his muscles had been reduced tonchildish proportions. Kellie fared no better as her curves had been mostly wiped away while her breasts had been reduced to a pair of softball sized mounds.<br />
<br />
“Look,” The 12 year old girl groaned. “All Of you blowing eachother up isn’t going to help the situation.”<br />
<br />
“Then what should we do,” Jack exclaimed, his voice cracking. Groaning in disgust Kellie took hold of Jacks hand, pulling the boy off balance and out of his shoes. “Hey what’s the big idea,” he exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Kellie stepped out of her own oversized shoes as she and Jack now marched away from the group, “You and I are going to talk,” she stated. “We better come up with something and fast or I’m pretty sure our granddaughter over there is going to put us back in preschool.”<br />
<br />
Kellie and Jack glanced back one more time at the group as they headed for a quieter spot. Kellie realized she would need to talk with Jack and stop acting so immature. If she couldn’t get her emotions under control she had a bad feeling both her and Jack would keep getting younger</p>
