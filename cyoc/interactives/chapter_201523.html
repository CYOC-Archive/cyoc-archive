<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You finally arrived at the summer camp where you were going to work.  The site area was larger than you&#39;d expect, with a large lake in the middle visible from the entrance when you walk in, but the place felt strangely empty. You searched for someone and saw a man who was all covered in bandages and looked like a mummy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, I came to work as a monitor here.  Where can I find the director for her to instruct me about my role.&quot; You said to the man, who looked at you<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so you&#39;re the newbie, the headmistress informed us that you would arrive.  She is resting at the moment, you can go to her dorm to take her things and after she wakes up she will meet you there.  Here is a map of the location, your accommodation is here.&quot;  the bandaged man said, taking a map out of the bands and pointing out where you would be staying. You thanked him, took the map from him and headed in the direction indicated, however looking at the man one last time you realized that you had not been able to see his eyes and instead he saw the inside of the bandages. Just thinking you hadn&#39;t paid attention to this detail, you thought it best to ignore it and went to the accommodation where you were supposed to live during your stay.<br />
<br />
On the way you saw that there were 5 sets of huts for monitors and the young people who would go to the camp, which were differentiated by colors (Yellow, Red, Blue, Green and White) and you would be in the red. <br />
<br />
You arrived at Red Lodge and found the monitors&#39; hut, opened the door and entered. As you did so you heard voices, on which focusing your attention you realized that they were female and that they were moaning. You followed the sound to the dorm and found a naked woman sitting on the bottom of a bunk, as if it wasn&#39;t enough that she was naked, the woman had two heads and was stroking a foot-long hard cock between her legs.<br />
<br />
The two-headed woman saw you and her right head, which had an oriental look and long black hair tied in a ponytail, said &quot;You&#39;re the rookie that was supposed to arrive today aren&#39;t you?  Pack your things and we&#39;ll show you around and introduce our other colleagues.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless you&#39;re horny too and want to join us, you&#39;d be very welcome.&quot; the left head of the weird dickgirl, who had wavy brown hair down to her shoulders, a snub nose and slightly full lips, said<br />
<br />
You just stood there in disbelief while the two-headed woman jerked off, the doubt passed in your head if you ran out, walked in ignoring her or did something else, you even pinched yourself to make sure you weren&#39;t dreaming. The pain proved it was all real, even when she came without any concern that you were watching her cum fly up and land on her chest.<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t just leave work out of the blue, so you left your suitcase beside the bunk and were walking out of the room when the woman&#39;s left head said &quot;Where are you going?  We&#39;re not ready yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I.... I....&quot; you tried to say something, but the words wouldn&#39;t come out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh Lara, the guy was delighted to see our sexy body, but apparently he&#39;s shy and embarrassed.&quot; the right head said<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not it.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to be ashamed, we don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad that you want us, we even like it.&quot; the right head said<br />
<br />
The two-headed dickgirl hugged you from behind and you felt her cock pressed against your back, and the head on the left, Lara, said &quot;No need to hold back, Molly and I don&#39;t blame you for being attracted to us.  Which part of us did you like best?  Our breasts?  Our faces?  Our belly?  Our hip?  Our legs?  Or did you like our dick more?  You can make us come if you want, we still haven&#39;t completely emptied our balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
You found yourself cornered because you didn&#39;t want to say something that was obvious to you, but it might offend them to say it, which you didn&#39;t want to. You then got rid of her, or them, as they showed themselves to be two separate people despite sharing a single body, and said &quot; I&#39;m sorry but that&#39;s not the problem.  I&#39;m sorry if I offend you but anyone would be embarrassed to come across someone masturbating and you guys are weird.<br />
<br />
The two laughed and Molly said &quot; Are you embarrassed because of our unconventional body?  Fool, we are mutants just like you, there&#39;s no reason for you to be surprised by that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m no mutant.  I&#39;m a regular guy and I&#39;ve never seen a mutant before, well at least not until now.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you not a mutant?  It&#39;s really rare for a normal person to come to this camp, let alone work here.  And you said you&#39;ve never seen mutants before but it can&#39;t be true, otherwise you would never have come to work at this summer camp.&quot; Lara said<br />
<br />
&quot;I already said that I have never seen any mutants in my entire life, you are the first.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;And we said that this is impossible.  If you haven&#39;t read the back of the brochure we made offering the spot, you might not even know that everyone in this camp, employees and guests without exception, are mutants, but I wouldn&#39;t have gotten the spot without having gone through an interview with Ondine.  If you&#39;ve seen her then you&#39;ve seen a mutant before you got here.&quot;  Molly said<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Ondine a mutant too?  But she seemed like a normal person to me during the video call. And I didn&#39;t see any flyers, just a poster.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;The leaflet was pasted like a poster and you couldn&#39;t see Ondine&#39;s mutation?  This must be Sarah, her personal assistant.  That kind of mistake is very well her type.&quot; Lara said<br />
<br />
&quot;Is confusing a flyer with a poster normal for her?  If so, she should be fired, she&#39;s not fit for the job.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;You may be right on this point, but the fact is, she can&#39;t be fired.&quot; Lara said<br />
<br />
&quot;Ondine can&#39;t handle everything without Sarah and it has to be her, otherwise the director can&#39;t even come to work.&quot; Molly said<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, she can.  Let me show you that Ondine can live without this Sarah.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s with me?&quot; Someone said and entering the cabin, you looked in the direction of the voice and soon a blonde woman was coming towards the dorm.  She had huge breasts, which you couldn&#39;t tell the cup size of, but I was pretty sure each breast was the size of a watermelon. She also had a bulge in her jeans that made it clear that she also had a dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;No big deal Sarah, the newbie wants to talk to Ondine.&quot; Molly said as Sarah walked past you, which allowed you to see that she had a second pair of huge breasts on her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, she wants to talk to him too, which is why I came.&quot; Sarah said<br />
<br />
&quot;If Ondine wanted to talk to me, wouldn&#39;t it have been faster for her to have come in person?&quot; you asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m already here.&quot; you heard Ondine&#39;s voice coming from the direction where Sarah was and looked at the assistant, thus seeing the zipper of her jeans opening by itself and through there came the woman who interviewed you. Considering her size and position she was attached to Sarah&#39;s body and, it was hard to believe, but she must have been her assistant&#39;s dick. &quot;I forgot to get the details about your weirdness and I need it to complete your registration.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won&#39;t be necessary Ondine, you hired a normal guy. We were explaining to him that there are only mutants here.&quot; Lara said<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re a normal guy?  Well, being weird isn&#39;t a requirement to work here, it&#39;s just that a lot of people feel uncomfortable around weird people like us. I&#39;ll understand if you want to give up the job, but I ask that you don&#39;t tell anyone about this camp detail.&quot; Onine said<br />
<br />
&quot;I will not give up work.  I was just taken by surprise.&quot; you said</p>
