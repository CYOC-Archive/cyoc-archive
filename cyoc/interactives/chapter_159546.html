<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked at his massive cock dumbfounded. He guessed it to be at least 2-feet long...but something wasn’t right, why couldn’t he remember his new massive cock?<br />
<br />
Jeff did his best to sit up, causing the bed and floor to groan under his weight. The chronivac had a message flashing.<br />
<br />
>>> MEMORY UPDATE AT 20%<br />
<br />
“Hmm,” Jeff grumbled, he’d have to explore this new reality and see if his tweaks to the family tree were as well received by his two dads.<br />
<br />
Tapping around the Chronivac, Jeff reviewed the changes to his family tree.<br />
<br />
While his Dad Elias’ lineage was filled with massively muscled Polynesians and their hyper submissive wives, the Chronivac had taken a more creative approach with his Dad Derek.<br />
<br />
One branch of Derek’s family was composed of giant European men that looked like they belonged on World’s Strongest Man, the other was full of naturally Dominant Vikings. Great northern men that looked like the legendary God Thor, an ancient relative of his past a Viking ship captain who kept dozens of wives aboard his vessels. Jeff felt a stir in his crotch.<br />
<br />
“...well, when you’re that hung.” Jeff looked at his ancestors’ oversized genitals, then down to his own.<br />
<br />
His Italian and European features had been mostly overtaken by the dominant Scandinavian genes.  His skin turned to a pristine pale silk—almost like a moonbeam—while his already masculine features had overdeveloped into hyper masculine: a lantern jaw wider than his head, broad but sharp nose that bridged to a powerful brow, and intense blue eyes. His European genetics showed through in a few select traits; still being quite early along in puberty, Jeff could only begin to see the appearance of blonde chest hairs, and a few whiskers had begun to grow on his chin. Furthermore, his pits had recently begun to emit a particular odor, along with similarly blonde wisps of pit hair giving way to signs of what great bushes would adorn his underarms. Even in these early stages, Jeff had no doubt that he would grow up to be one hairy son of a bitch. Jeff stood up from the Chronivac to inspect his reflection…<br />
<br />
“OW!” Jeff clutched his thick forehead, wincing as he crouched back down from the 8-foot ceiling on his attic-converted bedroom. “Wait...the ceilings in here are…” Jeff tried to stand up straight, but even at the highest point in the room, he was too tall. He must’ve been 8-foot-6-inches, possibly more.<br />
<br />
“Which means…” Jeff trailed off, feeling his heavy cock swing against his knees. If he was 8-feet-tall, that made his cock closer to 3-feet-long. Soft. <br />
<br />
Jeff gulped, feeling his oversized balls churn...he needed to see his dads, pronto. But, just as Jeff reached for the door, he saw the knob turn.<br />
<br />
“JEFF! Time to wake up, big guy.” Jeff’s cock throbbed at the deep, powerful voice. “You slept all day again. Us Viking men need more sleep, but you’re going to miss your football training if you keep this up.” A thick head of blonde hair peeked out from the top of the doorframe, followed by a familiar furry face...it was his dad Derek, but super sized! His sharp European features softened and broadened by his hyper masculine northern blood, while his skin shimmered in its fairness. A handsome beard grew down from his chin, which while being clearly well maintained made obvious the potential for a truly magnificent facial mane. <br />
<br />
Derek squeezed through the doorway, standing to his full height, which was about chest-high for Jeff. He was massive, but Jeff was even bigger thanks to the giant-sized genetics of his XXXL-powerlifter-Samoan-giant Dad Elias.<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head, suddenly realizing his Dad had walked in on him naked. “D-Dad!!!” He sat back on his bed, attempting to cover the first half of his massive Viking cock with a pillow. “You can’t just come in here like that, I could be—“<br />
<br />
“—Could be what? Jerking off?” Derek chuckled, attempting to cross his massive 25-inch arms over his furry pillow-sized pecs. “I’m disappointed in you, Son. Men like us don’t jerk off, we get serviced.” Jeff watched his Dad punctuate the sentence by flexing his cock through his tight sweats.<br />
<br />
To the left of the doorway where his burly, Dominant, swaggering Scandi Dad stood a floor-to-ceiling mirror. Jeff could see himself reflected beside his Dad...he was Derek’s son alright...  pallid skin, heavyset with muscle that made him look like a fireplug, intensely masculine features... sharp nose, thick lips, massively thick jaw. The only differences were that Jeff was supersized from his Polynesian Father Elias’ giant genetics, while his father Derek had long since matured through his pubescence, and had a gorgeous beard and expansive furry blonde forest of body hair. It also appeared that Derek was covered in ancient runic tattoos, where Jeff’s skin was naked.<br />
<br />
Derek caught Jeff eyeing his tattoos, “I know you will earn your ancestral brandings, son.” Derek gestured at the tattoo covering more than half his body. “This is your birthright as the Dominant man of our house.” The tattoo started at his dad’s knees, and ended at his lats. Jeff’s incomplete memories informed him it covered everything, from his dad’s taint to his cock. This was the rite of passage into manhood. Only the strongest, most dominant men could handle such a painful ritual of ink being hammered into the flesh.<br />
<br />
“Hold on, Dad.” Jeff was getting distracted, he had to know if his changing the lineage to make Derek a dominant Scandinavian warrior Demi-god and Elias a giant-yet-submissive Polynesian slave man had the intended effect. “You and Dad...Elias...everything is going okay, right?” He turned up his boyhood charm as best as an 8’6” mountain of Viking beef could.<br />
<br />
Derek stepped forward to accentuate the difference in their height while Jeff was still seated. “Son...did you hear your dad yelling in pain last night?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, his big blue eyes looking up innocently at Derek.<br />
<br />
“Sigh...I guess its time for ‘the talk.’ Your Dad, Elias, is my slave.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s jaw fell open.<br />
<br />
“As you know, we hail from a long line of hyper dominant Viking warriors. Our ancestors populated the North Atlantic, discovering and conquering many a remote coastal village, and taking many slaves as our partners. Why, your great-great-grandfather had at least a dozen sex sla—“<br />
<br />
“DAD!” Jeff tried to interject but was quickly silenced by a stern look from his swarthy dad.<br />
<br />
“—listen, Jeff. You haven’t finished puberty yet. Thanks to the excellent genes from your other Dad, you’re already one of the biggest men in the world. Not to mention that libido of yours...when I was your age all I could think about was jerking off. But soon that constantly horny feeling will start to have a direction.” Derek locked eyes with his son, assuming a more dominant stance. “You’re going to feel the need to own someone. To control and shape them. To dominate them.”<br />
<br />
Jeff was speechless.<br />
<br />
“What you heard last night was Elias servicing his Master. Which, as you know, is not something a normal man can do. I’ve got a two-foot cock and thankfully your Dad comes from a long line of aggressively sexual and accommodating—“<br />
<br />
“DAAAAD!!!” Jeff cried out again, trying to push his hardening cock down.<br />
<br />
Derek barked at Jeff, silencing him. The two dominant men rarely butted heads, but his Father always won out. Even though he was smaller in size, he made up for it in experienced power.<br />
<br />
“Son, its time to learn the craft.”</p>
