<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michelle laid back in her bed and sighed a bit. She honestly was having a hard time getting back to sleep, her mind had been going back to Hank and the other Werehorses. It was a weird thing to think about, but it seemed almost appealing to her to become a werehorse. In fact the idea was kind of exciting to her, she had snuck a look at the book about weres earlier and read up about werehorses. After her mother had told her and Jasmine that it was up to them if they wanted to become weres, she was honestly still thinking about whether or not she would even consider it.<br />
<br />
Werehorses were strong, athletic, and competitive even within herds. It wasn&#39;t out of any real rivalry, more out of natural competition. The book had suggested that it had started as a way to impress and attract mares, but had evolved over the years to being a way to let off steam as weres had to keep their nature secret. It was interesting enough to think about, she had to admit she was considering it.<br />
<br />
She sighed and rolled over onto her side, adjusting her blanket over her bare skin. It was something she&#39;d have to think about, but she drifted off to sleep with the image of herself as a tall attractive Werehorse mare.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Michelle&#39;s eyes snapped open as she looked up at a starry night sky. She looked around and realized she was laying in a field. She pushed herself up and looked around, realizing that she was still naked. She subconsciously covered herself as best she could as she looked around, there wasn&#39;t any sign of anyone else around her at least, so there was that. This whole thing was odd to her, but it slowly dawned on her that she wasn&#39;t alone.<br />
<br />
A magnificent brown stallion with a black mane trotted up next to her. He threw his head back, walking around her as if gesturing. He then turned and started to run. She looked at herself, and then after the stallion, feeling almost as if he was challenging her. She smield a bit and ran after him.<br />
<br />
Michelle&#39;s body weird as she ran. She could see the stallion ahead of her, and despite the fact that he was much faster than her, she felt herself keeping pace with him. Her muscles were growing stronger as she ran, each pump of her legs. She was running faster and harder than she had ever had before. For a moment she felt like she was tripping as she fell forward onto her hands, but that didn&#39;t interrupt her, she could feel her body changing now as her hands and feet rew into hooves.<br />
<br />
Finally she pulled herself to a stop as she neared a small lake. She and the stallion leaned down and drank from the water, she could see staring back at her was the face of a black mare with a white flare on her nose. She admired herself for a moment as her body changed once more, now forming into the humanoid shape of a werehorse mare. She stared at herself, still coated black with some white on her nose and hands and feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You make a beautiful mare, Michelle,&quot; a familiar voice said from next to her and she looked to see the stallion had likewise turned into a werehorse. &quot;I&#39;m glad you joined the Herd.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Michelle said, any embarrassment she would&#39;ve felt melting away. &quot;I&#39;m still worried about my sisters though. Rachel doesn&#39;t know about what she&#39;s goign to do, and Jasmine... well, she&#39;s Jasmine. I&#39;m still worried that she&#39;s going to do something stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should give your sister more credit, I think she&#39;s going to be just fine,&quot; Hank chuckled. &quot;She&#39;s not completely stupid. If she becomes a were, it will be because she wants to be one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I suppose you&#39;re right,&quot; Michelle said as she laid back in the grass. &quot;I&#39;m glad I became a Werehorse though, I&#39;ve never felt so free to just run as far and as fast as I want. I just wanted to thank you for sharing this with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, anything for a beautiful mare like you,&quot; Hank said as he leaned in and kissed her. &quot;I knew when I first saw you that you were meant to be a werehorse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle smiled as she looked out at the lake. Her life had felt like it had changed ever since she had moved to Moon Lake with her family. So, how much more would it change now? What did the future have in store for her now?<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, the Herd is waiting for you,&quot; Hank said as he got up and helped her to her hooves. The two of them ran off together, racing towards the other werehorses that were waiting for them.<br />
<br />
Michelle hadn&#39;t ever felt happier.</p>
