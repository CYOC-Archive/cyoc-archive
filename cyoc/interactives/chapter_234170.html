<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You waited at the Company&#39;s headquarters for your first call while chatting a little with the veteran Helen, who was currently in her favorite form.  Helen only used her normal form to go out, but when she was alone or with friends she changed into a headless form with her face between her legs.<br />
<br />
When the message arrived that you had your first client, you received the address where you should go and information about the service: You was supposed to go to the contractor&#39;s house, but you was surprised because there were two people at once and they were husband and wife, who had hired your services for two hours.  Helen saw this and commented that sometimes couples wanted to see their partners having a relationship with someone else.<br />
<br />
To go to the indicated address, you went to the garage and took off your clothes, then transformed into a Lamburguini car (you saw this as one of the advantages of your power) and Helen placed your bag on your passenger seat for you.<br />
<br />
Arriving at the customers&#39; house, you honked your horn.  The husband, who you only knew was called Ryan, came out and saw you, but didn&#39;t realize you as you were in your car form, so you turned back to your human form and introduced yourself to him.  You went into the house and he thanked you for being there, then said that it was great to have found F.T.L.A.S.C, because Camille, his wife, was not like other women and needed help that only a shapesifter could provide.<br />
<br />
Arriving in the dining room, you met Camille, who was sitting at the table, only the top of her visible to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for coming, I was really looking forward to this moment.&quot;  Camille said greeting you<br />
<br />
&quot;Your husband said that you are different from other women and only someone like me can help. May I know what it is?&quot;  you asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I happen to be a hermaphrodite, so I have the genitals of both genders, but I also have macrophaly and, because of this, my dick is extremely large, being too big to fuck any normal person&#39;s orifice. With you being a shapeshifter I believe you can adapt your body so I can fuck you, don&#39;t you?&quot;  Camille said<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem at all, this is actually quite easy to do.&quot;  you said<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, I can&#39;t wait for us to get started. Let&#39;s go to our room fast.&quot;  Camille said and stood up, revealing that she was already without pants and her dick was already hard.  You were still surprised because her dick was bigger than you imagined when she told you about it, as it was approximately two and a half feet long and as thick as a fire extinguisher.  Her balls were also huge, resembling two watermelons.<br />
<br />
In their room, Camille took off the clothes she was still wearing and Ryan also undressed.<br />
<br />
At their request, the beginning would be just you and Camille, who asked you to become an almost exact copy of her, with the only difference being you being able to take all of her cock inside you.  With that you became an exact copy of Camille, including becoming a hermaphrodite and having a dick the same size as hers between your legs.  You and Camille did a 69 while Ryan just watched, and the only way he could know which one was you and which one was his wife was that you had her entire cock in your mouth and down your throat, while Camille couldn&#39;t even put the tip of the copy of her own dick inside her mouth, she only stimulated it as best she could with her hands and mouth.  Both of their orgasms left you with a big belly from so much cum inside you, but Camille and part of the room were left dirty with your cum.<br />
<br />
The couple wanted another round and, this time, the request was that you remain a clone of Camille, but that you make your dick much smaller, enough to be able to fuck Ryan&#39;s ass.  This was because he wanted to be fucked by his wife but her size prevented it, and so he could feel the closest thing to what it would be like to be penetrated by her.  While you fucked him, Camille fucked your pussy, enlarged to handle her member.<br />
<br />
Finally, after cumming again, they asked you to become a clonr of Ryan and let Camille fuck your ass, which she did while the real Ryan fucked his wife&#39;s pussy.<br />
<br />
After this last round, they were satisfied, thanking you for the job well done, saying that they enjoyed the experience so much that they intended to become regular customers.  The final moment of the contracted time had arrived, so you said goodbye to them, turned back into a Lamburguini and left to wait for your next client.</p>
