<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“But… if I throw the letter in the fireplace, it’ll burn! Santa will never get it!” The little boy tugged against his brother’s leg, almost brought to tears at the prospect of his letter to Santa Claus that he worked so hard on would be turned to ash.<br />
<br />
“Hey, calm down, Rory.” Jason pat his little brother’s back reassuringly, “It’s magic. Throwing your letter in the fire sends it to Santa instantly! Besides, you were the one who waited until Christmas Eve to send it. There’s no chance it will get there in time if you send it by post!”<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah.” The Rory sighed, reluctantly agreeing as he held the envelope just above the flames. “And he’ll be able to read it, right? I wrote to him about something I want more than anything… Do you think it’s possible he can give me it tomorrow? I asked for-”<br />
<br />
“Woah. Woah. Woah.” Jason stopped him , “The letter will get there just fine, but don’t tell me what you asked for! If you do your wish will never come true.”<br />
<br />
Rory’s mouth instantly sealed shut, looking back up to Jason like he was really struggling not to the spill the beans on his wish. His hand let the letter lose, letting it flutter into the embers as it ignited, the paper sizzling as orange flamed lapped away at its sides, blackening it until is shrunk to white and black ashes.<br />
<br />
To Jason, it was all so bittersweet. He was eleven years old – old enough to know he was lying to his little brother. Santa Claus didn’t exist and never answered anyone’s wishes. Tomorrow could be difficult; if Rory had asked for anything extravagant, there wasn’t going to be disappointed.<br />
<br />
Jason held his little brother’s hand as they trudged up to their bedroom. They shared a room with six other boys, the orphanage they lived in was a large manor already over-crowded by an abundance of children and not enough parents around to adopt them. It wasn’t a terrible place, mind you. They ate bland but consistent meals, they were able to attend a nearby catholic school, and the staff were kind, but too overworked to spend much time with the kids. They would have a meagre Christmas just like they did every year – each child receiving two gifts. One would be something practical, like a pair of warm socks or mittens. The other gift would be something sweet, like chocolate or licorice - or maybe even a bottle of maple syrup, Rory’s favorite treat. Jason hoped to God his little brother would get his syrup this year, maybe it would make up for his wish that would surely go unanswered.<br />
<br />
“Big brother…” Rory squeaked as Jason perched him up on the side of their bunkbed, helping the smaller boy change into his pajama bottoms. The younger brother looked like he was about to burst, an important question sitting on the top of his mind. “I… really need to know if Santa can even bring it… I wished for…!”<br />
<br />
Before Jason could shoosh him quiet, the little boy’s secret wish slipped from his lips. “I asked Santa that I would get adopted tomorrow!”<br />
<br />
Jason stopped as the room grew awkwardly silent. The expression on the older boy’s face was mortified and sullen as Rory looked down at Jason, begging for a response.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry I told you, but I just had to know!” The boy lunged forward and hugged his brother, shaking against him. “Do you think the wish can still come true?! Do you think Santa can even bring a family I could join in his sack of presents?!”<br />
<br />
Rory’s eyes were pleading for answers, but Jason just couldn’t give a response. He didn’t want to break the news that to his brother that wishes and Santa didn’t exist. Not now, not on the night of Christmas Eve of all nights! He screwed his eyes shut, thinking for a moment of some sort of excuse that wouldn’t kill off the mythos of Saint Nick, but he could only draw a blank. The only response he could muster was to his little brother was, “It’s gonna be okay, Rory. Just get some sleep, alright?”<br />
<br />
Rory looked scared as he laid down in the bottom bunk, curling up into a ball as he pulled the covers over himself. It killed Jason to leave him like that – he always was so protective of his little brother ever since their parents were – well… he didn’t like to talk about it.<br />
<br />
Jason climbed up the creaky wooden ladder and threw himself on the top bunk, silently whispering his Christmas wish to God or Santa or whoever could listen before he drifted to sleep. “Please let things be okay.”<br />
______________________________________________<br />
<br />
“Jason, hey! Wakeup!” Rory whispered with a glint of elation in his voice, rustling Jason’s pajama leg causing the older boy to stir. All the other boys they shared a room with were fast asleep and the snowy skies outside were still dark, barely illuminated by the moon. A nearby clock read 12:30am.<br />
<br />
“Rory, what is it? It’s way too early.” Jason yawned.<br />
<br />
“Well… I know I shouldn’t have. But Santa left us something big!” the little boy wiggled on the ladder with excitement.<br />
<br />
“Hey! You’re not supposed to go downstairs to look! If you do, Santa’s gonna…” Jason let out a relenting sigh. Who was he kidding? At least it sounded like Rory was happy.<br />
<br />
“Comon!” Rory smiled, grabbing Jason’s hand, pulling his older brother down the bunkbed’s ladder along with him. “You’ve gotta see it! Before all the other kids do!”<br />
<br />
The pair tiptoed down the long upstairs hallway quietly to avoid waking another soul. The dim glow of nightlights illuminated their bare feet as they carefully made their way down the rickety stairs, towards the Christmas tree that stood right by the roaring fireplace.<br />
<br />
Jason froze in place as he saw it. Laying down right in front of the shimmer Fir Tree wrapped in red ribbons was an animal. Not just any animal – a huge reindeer with a soft, welcoming expression decking its feminine muzzle. It lightly shook its antlers in their direction, almost as if it were beckoning the two to step towards it.<br />
<br />
Jason was paralyzed with apprehension – wondering how an animal this big even fit through the front door, wondering if it was dangerous and whether he should tell the staff about it. But as he stood frozen in place, Rory ran towards the reindeer, his arms outstretched as he leapt against its side, embracing its neck the best he could.<br />
<br />
“Wait! Rory!” Jason yelled out, fearing that his little brother was about to get gored only to see the creature gingerly dip it’s head down towards the little boy, nuzzling against his back as it pushed him closer against her soft, fuzzy neck.<br />
<br />
Somehow it seemed safe. Jason gulped, walking towards the reindeer’s head, reaching out a hand to stroke against its creamy chestnut hide. It didn’t seem to mind at all, letting a relaxed puff of air snort from its nose, accepting the old boy’s hand running through her silky soft fur. The older boy couldn’t believe it. The reindeer was so kind and gentle with his little brother, as if it knew how to handle children. As if to answer his question, he spotted a gift tag hanging from those short, velvety antlers. Jason grabbed it, eyes growing wide as he read out the message.<br />
______________________________________________<br />
“For the brothers Rory and Jason,<br />
<br />
 That’s a tough wish! I don’t know if I can handle it myself, but maybe Vixen can help!<br />
<br />
--Santa”<br />
______________________________________________<br />
<br />
Santa? This had to be some kind of joke… but the proof was right there. Vixen. One of Santa’s reindeer? It almost seemed plausible – it certainly looked like a sleigh-pulling reindeer. The animal was as big as a horse and built like one too. Its body was muscular, but her thick polar hide consisting of brown fur with a snow-white belly made it feel plush and soft to the touch. Vixen was female, right? Her powerful stature made that difficult to believe, but her face did bare tell-tale hints of femininity. A pair of plump pink udders resting on the floor between her thick muscular flanks clearly giving her gender away, as she tenderly embraced Jason’s little brother’s back with her huge snout.<br />
<br />
Jason kneeled down in front of the doe, gently stroking the muscular contours of her neck still in disbelief that a creature so wonderful was real. Vixen bleated softly as she gently nipped on Rory’s pajama top, lifting the younger brother up and setting him down on the floor behind her. She shifted her attention over to Jason as her head turned towards his. Huffing a cinnamon-scented puff of breath against his face, her muzzle pressed against his lips, letting a steaming-hot cervid tongue slurp out. That gooey warmth cradled Jason’s chin in an aloey kiss before flicking her tongue out against his mouth, slipping it in between his lips.<br />
<br />
The boy jolted back a little before feeling that warm herbivore muscle sink inside. He would have never thought his first kiss would be with an animal, but here he was, letting his lips clamp down on Vixen’s tongue, gently suckling against that thick muscle, tasing her sweet and savory cervine drool as his eyes fluttered shut.<br />
<br />
Behind Vixen, the younger brother caught sight of something completely alien to him. Below Vixen’s tail was a thick pair of big flesh-pink lips. Each one was hot and swollen, glazed with a thin sheen of sugary-smelling honey. Rory couldn’t help but gravitate towards Vixen’s reindeer pussy, sticking a finger out to poke at the warm, pliant flesh only to feel it slip inside. The little boy gasped at the heat, instantly tugging it out to find it was covered in that same sweet liquid that her pussy lips were. Lifting his sugar-glazed finger up to his mouth, he started to taste it, lapping up that deer-scented saccharine goo.<br />
<br />
Maple syrup! Rory’s eyes lit up. It tasted exactly like Maple syrup! He knelt down, pressing his face up against those hot vaginal folds, to lick up more of Vixen’s sweetness straight from the source. Those doughy pussy lips easily relented, letting the tip of his nose slide right in as he lapped from her bestial femininity.<br />
<br />
Vixen snorted in pleasure against Jason’s lips as she felt Rory play with her pussy. The reindeer shoved her rear backwards against the little boy’s face as those thick fleshy folds pulled him inside, beginning to stroke around the orphan boy’s cheeks. Rory hadn’t even perceived that those pussy lips were drawing him in deeper, too focused on lapping up more and more of her honey along those pink cervine innards as his entire head suddenly slipped inside with a loud “SLOP!”<br />
<br />
Rory was dazed but not concerned. The slow steady cadence of Vixen’s heartbeat beckoned the boy further inside the reindeer’s slick birth canal as it dilated wider, sloppily tucking the boy deeper and deeper inside her body loving body as he slowly began slipping into her womb.<br />
<br />
Jason pulled back from suckling on Vixen’s tongue as the deer began to spasm and bleat, her eyes half-lidded as Rory sank inside her. “What’s wrong, girl?” Jason asked, petting along Vixen’s neck as the huge doe suddenly seized up, her whole body tensing as a loud slurp sounded out from behind. As Jason got up to look behind her to see what was wrong, he only caught a brief glimpse of a pair of small feet slipping inside her engorged pussy, those vaginal lips sealing tight around them, leaving no trace of them ever being.<br />
<br />
Jason’s eyes widened with fear. He didn’t just see that, right?! That wasn’t… it couldn’t have been…<br />
<br />
Vixen’s head turned towards Jason with a proud look in her eyes, the doe’s head dipping downwards to rub her muzzle along her newly swollen belly as the reindeer started to undergo her own changes. Her form seemed to suddenly plump up, her athletic rear thickening with a cozy layer of motherly fat as the rest of her features started to round off ever so slightly. Between Vixen’s legs, those udders enlarged, squishing between her ample hindlegs. That velvety flesh grew pillowy-soft and plump as milk for her new young one made them expand like water balloons, her nipples growing fatter and longer as tiny trickles of white cream drooled from their tips.<br />
<br />
“N-no, he can’t be…” Jason was stupefied, shaking his head in disbelief as he fell to his knees, placing a hand on that fat pregnant reindeer stomach. He squeezed that soft, white belly fuzz only to feel it kick back. “That’s not… Rory… is it?”<br />
<br />
Vixen flashed a cervine smirk in his direction as if she understood the question, nodding at him as she proudly lapped against the child trapped inside her belly. It seemed too fantastical to be real, but Jason seemed to intrinsically know what was going to happen - Rory wanted a home so bad, and the deer was going to grant his wish. Vixen was going to be his mother. Vixen was going to turn Rory, his precious little brother, into her faun.<br />
<br />
As Jason struggled with the thought of his brother turning into an animal, Vixen’s head teetered to the side to grasp a present under the tree in her mouth. She set it in front of Jason, a gift tag stating it was for him. Realizing that she might be trying to help him, the boy ripped it open, only to find a kid’s toy inside, a “Junior Letter Writing Kit”. The package boasted pens, papers, and envelopes inside, Vixen giving Jason one last hint on what she wanted as she pointed her muzzle towards the flames roaring inside the fireplace.<br />
<br />
“You want me to… write a wish to Santa?” The boy asked as the reindeer nodded in response. Jason knew that Santa must have already visited their house, so he wouldn’t be able to return to give him any help, bet Vixen was here. Vixen wanted to grant Jason’s wish in Santa’s stead.<br />
<br />
Jason tore open the writing kit, letting all the stationary inside drop to the floor. He picked up one of the included pens, quickly scribbled a letter to Santa before throwing it in an envelope and tossing it into the fire.</p>
