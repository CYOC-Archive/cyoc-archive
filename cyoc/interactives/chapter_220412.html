<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenkins pulled out the documents that was probably the request of Christina&#39;s first client and continued as if he wasn&#39;t currently holding her hostage. &quot;Today is very important for both our client and ourselves. I assume you&#39;ve never heard of the Westmorpher dog show.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deciding to humor the man who she was locked in left, Christina responded. &quot;Do you mean Westminster?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins shook his head. &quot;No, that&#39;s the mainstream dog show that is televised. This dog show is more private, and exclusive. The public does not know of its existence and can only be viewed by people who frequent shops like my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina nervously returned to her seat. &quot;There are other places like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I don&#39;t have a monopoly over this industry and some shops also cater to other changes. Elderly couples wanting to relive a date as high-school sweet hearts, people who want to walk in another person&#39;s shoes to better understand other races or the opposite sex, even art galleries who features patrons as part of their temporary exhibits. There are all kinds in our field. You might get to see some of them since they tend to advise at these types of events.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins cleared his throat. &quot;Anyways, this dog show is a competition between dogs who are transformed humans. As you can imagine, many of our staff have already been scheduled for this event, which is why I had to seek out aid from the  temp agency. Usually our employees are more aware of what they were getting themselves into but most people who are interested in this field are currently having their fur groomed for the big event.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you want to turn me into a dog, and parade me in front of a gawking crowd.&quot; Christina clarified. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not me personally.&quot; Jenkins told her. &quot;Mrs. Hollingsworth who is a highly valued client does. She is listing me as her shop of choice and the &#39;artisan&#39; of your change as they call it, so I would benefit greatly if you or Gemma were to win.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I know I signed a contract,&quot; Christina tried to say calmly. &quot;But I&#39;m not interested in turning into a dog. Wouldn&#39;t it hurt your business to transform someone unwillingly?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins smirked. &quot;Welcome to the forgotten world of old. Everyone in my world abides by a simple rule. Wizards, alchemist, genies, and fae all know once you agreed to a deal...&quot; he held up a contract with Christina&#39;s signature. The ink on it seemed to glow. &quot;Even if you forget to read the fine print you cannot back out. Let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins stood up, and Christina was compelled to follow him without argument. He opened the previously locked door without ever unlocking it. They went down a hallway and Jenkins led her to a changing room. &quot;I&#39;ll wait outside.&quot; He placed a box on a bench in the room and pulled put a medical gown. &quot;Please remove all clothes and place them in this box. They will be returned to you after your return to humanity.&quot; Jenkins handed her the medical gown and paused. &quot;You&#39;re supposed to exit wearing that....to protect your modesty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina nodded. &quot;I figured.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins just shrugged. &quot;Gemma was our most recent hire and she just exited in the nude. Nearly gave this old man a heart attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still oddly compelled, Christina followed his directions after he had left her alone. She placed all of her belongings, including her wallet, keys, identification, and phone. She tied the medical gown as tight as she could, hoping no one would see her bare ass in the back of the drafty gown.<br />
<br />
Once she exited, Jenkins walked in front leading her to what appeared to be a surgical room. He gestured to a table. Without any order, she climbed up and laid on it. Jenkins pulled out various items which appeared to be a mixtures of surgical implements and what seemed like props from some wizard films. <br />
<br />
Knives, scalpels, wands, various mysterious liquids and a jar of glitter labeled fairy dust all organized together. Jenkins places a breathing mask over her mouth and nose. He turned the nozel of the tank it was attached to. Christina could hear the gas start to flow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now breath deeply, and count backwards from 10. I will begin once you are dreaming about chasing rabbits.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina still found herself following his directions. &quot;10...9...8...<br />
<br />
***********************************************<br />
<br />
Christina did in fact dream of chasing rabbits. She wasn&#39;t sure if it was because Jenkins had suggested it, or if he had the ability to actually control dreams. However, she awoke curled up on the floor of Jenkins&#39; office. From what she could see, she was covered in fur and the experience hadn&#39;t been a bad dream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, she&#39;s awake. We were just talking about you.&quot; Jenkins called to her. Looking at him, she noticed he was speaking to a woman who appeared to be in her earlier 40s. The woman in question had managed to keep in remarkable shape and was still beautiful is a mature, dignified manner. <br />
<br />
Almost instinctively she knew, this woman was her current owner. With those thought, the strange sensation of having her tail wag began. Christina wasn&#39;t sure what startled her more, the novelty of having a tail, or that the tail seemed to delight at having a master. <br />
<br />
The woman smiled at her. &quot;Thank you Christina. This means a lot to me and I look forward to competing with you. Mr. Jenkins explained that it was your first day and this would be your first competition. I&#39;m an old pro, so don&#39;t be nervous and follow my lead. You turned out lovely by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Jenkins agreed. &quot;I think it was one of my finest works yet, but then again it tends to be easy when you work with high grade material.&quot; He gestured to a full body mirror. &quot;Please, take a look at yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
This time it wasn&#39;t the bizarre sway Jenkins had over her that compelled Christina to the mirror. It was her own curiosity and the burning need to know what had been done to her. She stood up on all fours, and walked to the mirror, to see a chocolate lab staring back at her. The one odd thing of the lab was the bright blue eyes like she had back when she was human.<br />
<br />
Her owner walked up next to her and started to pet her head. &quot;I remember my first competition. I was 12 and my father entered me as a malamute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you were a lovely malamute Mrs. Hollingsworth.&quot; Jenkins commented. &quot;In fact, if you ever wanted to compete again, I could offer you the change at a discount.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled at him. &quot;That is a tempting offer, but I&#39;m afraid that Westmorphers is a young person&#39;s competition. I couldn&#39;t possibly compete in the agility portion now, and I refuse to stoop so low as to lower my age to give me an edge like Loretta.&quot; She frowned at the name. Then smiled at Christina. &quot;How do you we feel showing miss high and mighty up today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina had no idea who she was referring to, but she found something about how she spoke charming. Christina gave a bark and wagged her tail. If she was going to be in the dog show, she might as well win.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit Christina! Good girl.&quot; Mrs. Hollingsworth told her.<br />
<br />
Jenkins grimaced. &quot;I must insist that you speak with a bit more respect. I would prefer we don&#39;t dehumanize the poor girl by talking down to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come now Jenkins. Good girl isn&#39;t all that degrading. I was praised many times as such as a malamute by both my father and husband while competing. I usually praise my own son when he competes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins nodded. &quot;Well, times do change, please be mindful that Chrustina may not enjoy it as much as your son. On that note, you did mention that young Jared wishes to be a trainer this year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Hollingsworth rolled her eyes. &quot;Yes. I feel it&#39;s a bit soon but they did open up that junior division so he&#39;s was too excited for me to say no. He even insisted on finding his own dog for the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins nodded. &quot;Yes you did mention that but I fail to see your trepidation over the issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jared has been dating a girl named Lily. A lovely young lady, even if she occasionally tries to pretend to be otherwise. I&#39;m afraid she thinks this is all some prank but she wants to see how far he&#39;s willing to go to pull it off. I swear, if she doesn&#39;t dump him over this I should ask her to be my cat for a day with how curious she gets.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins smiled. &quot;Well, let&#39;s go see my next client and see if I can&#39;t talk her out of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Hollingsworth clipped a leash on the collar she had just realized she was wearing and they walked together to the waiting room. Christina saw two teenagers of about 16. <br />
<br />
Jared was a tall, muscular boy, with a dashing smile and cute dimples. Christina was sure all the girls swooned over him. Lily was a looker herself, but wore much more noticeable clothing. Her boots had thick soles that should have added several inches to her height, and she still barely met Jared&#39;s shoulders. The boots ended close to her knees and gave way to fishnet stalkings. She wore a plaid miniskirt that barely reached mid-thigh. This was likely what Mrs. Hollingsworth meant about Lily pretending not to be a &#39;lovely young lady&#39;. Lily wore a tight black shirt that gave a generous view of her ample cleavage. She wore a dog collar with small studs on it. The tag read &quot;Bad B*!ch&quot;. Her short raven hair came down slightly below her chin, and she had strands of blueish-green dyed into it. <br />
<br />
Lily wore bright red lipstick and had bright green eyes. She crouched down and scratched Christina behind the ears. &quot;So who is this supposed to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Hollingsworth answered. &quot;This is Christina, who is one of the employees here. She is competing as my partner since Jared insists on competing with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lily smirked. &quot;Right, because I am totally about to be turned into a dog right now.&quot; She spoke with as much sarcasm as she could fit into her words. &quot;Tell me Christina, were you human this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina barked. <br />
<br />
Lily seemed surprised. &quot;Wow, you even paid to get a well trained dog.&quot; Lily stood up and walked to her boyfriend with her hands on her hips. &quot;I know your family is loaded but aren&#39;t you spending a bit too much on this prank?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared shrugged. &quot;This probably would cost less if it wasn&#39;t a prank.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was Jenkins who spoke next. &quot;I&#39;ll have you know my prices are the most competitive in the business, and my work is top notch. Now, Miss Lily, before we begin I have to bring up your age. I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t change anyone under 18 without parental or guardian consent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lily reached into her skirt, which amazing had a pocket, and pulled out a folded piece of paper. &quot;Yeah, Jared gave me this release form for my mom to sign. I&#39;m guessing he didn&#39;t expect her to sign, but she said &quot;you act like a bitch you might as well be one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Hollingsworth seemed dismayed by this. &quot;OH Lily...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Mrs. H. My mom has a nasty bark but no bite. What she says doesn&#39;t hurt.&quot; Lily handed the paper to Jenkins who read it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Parental consent has been given. However this is just consent to allow you to be changed. To change you I still need a signature on this temporary employee form.&quot; He pulled out another document. &quot;The contract lasts for the entirety of Westmorphers. While the dog show is today, there several other events and you wouldn&#39;t not be returned to normal till the end. That&#39;s out of the norm, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m far too busy during Westmorphers to restore an unofficial employee.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilly took a pen to sign when Jenkins held his hand up. &quot;I warn you,&quot; he told her. &quot;This isn&#39;t a trick. If you sign this you will be taken to the back and transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lily nodded knowingly. &quot;Because accompanying a strange man alone for a bizarre procedure is the part that any sensible person would stop.&quot; She looked over her shoulder. &quot;Well played Jared. If I stop now you can use whatever camera here to show everyone I chicken out and get to claim it is because I thought you could actually turn me into a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins gave a look to Mrs. Hollingsworth who sighed. &quot;Those two like pranks. Things have escalated and they have embarrassed each other in front of their friends multiple times until it reached this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH, he&#39;s gotten me a few times.&quot; Lily admitted. &quot;But I&#39;m the current Queen of Pranks.&quot; She turned to Jared. &quot;I admit getting your mom in on it, and renting this office with an actor and his trained dog was all well done. Praise worthy really how you never broke character. But your buddy here overplayed his hand.&quot; Turning back to Jenkins she spoke quickly. &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, you&#39;re fantastic and I love the whole vibe you threw together for this. But, trying to scare me by saying I&#39;d have to accompany you in the backrooms? Jared might try to scare me with his pranks but I know I&#39;m not in actual danger from them. I&#39;m gonna when this game and say hi to whoever he has waiting back there. I&#39;m guessing Bruce and Oliver? They usually get involved. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you be be losing if Young Jared&#39;s friends are waiting in the back? Perhaps to laugh at you for going along with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lily looked at her boyfriend. &quot;&#39;Young Jared,&#39; I love this guy. You should give him a bonus.&quot; Turning back to Jenkins she answered. &quot;That&#39;s not how Jared operates. I win by calling his bluff.&quot; Lily signed the contract triumphantly, completely ignorant that she had just signed away her humanity. <br />
<br />
Jenkins glanced at Chritina who had been quite forgotten during the exchange. &quot;Well, I guess I dumped this business on one unsuspecting lady, what&#39;s one more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit Jenkins.&quot; Lily told him. &quot;Never break character, even in defeat.&quot; Jenkins gave the enthusiastic young girl an exasperated smile while Christina just whined knowing what was about to happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know dear.&quot; Mrs. Hollingsworth told her. &quot;But apart of being young is learning from your mistakes. Don&#39;t worry, we will take care of her and I&#39;ll make sure Jared treats her with respect.&quot; Her eyes cut to her son in warning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Jenkins took the contract. &quot;Out of curiosity, what do you plan to do when I prove you wrong and turn you into a dog?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lily was undeterred, not that it mattered now that she signed the contract. &quot;Well in that case, might as well go for first place, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins gave a more genuine smile. &quot;Well, you have spirit. Westmorphers always loves that. Apart of our policy is that our customers are to be referred to by their real names. I&#39;m afraid I did not prepare a tag for you. Please allow me a moment to make one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all right. I&#39;ll waive that.&quot; She pointed at her Bad B*!ch tag. &quot;Besides I brought my own. If I&#39;m competing,&quot; she said mockingly,  &quot;I might as well compete as Bad Bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins sighed and began mumbling to himself. &quot;The customer is always right, the customer is always right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lily reached up and patted him. &quot;Its okay Jenkins. Nice try but I&#39;m not letting you stall me and try to get me to loose my nerve. Let&#39;s get started.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One last matter to attend to. What breed of dog will Young Jared be competing with. He left that off of his request form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH right.&quot; Jared said. &quot;I couldn&#39;t decide between a terrier because they are small like her, or a mastiff because it be funny if she got bigger as a dog.&quot; Jared thought about it and then wrote it down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not gonna tell me?&quot; Lily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just say, I wanted an extra surprise once you realize you actually got turned into a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lily reached up and gave him a kiss on the lips. &quot;Sure. You better tell me what you wrote after the pranks over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins at this point had finished checking over his paper work, and Lily&#39;s eyes suddenly glazed over. &quot;Come along.&quot; Jenkins went to the back room and Lily followed him a trance that Christina knew all to well.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Hollingsworth and Jard sat down to wait for Lily&#39;s return. Christina wasn&#39;t sure how long it took for her to change so she didn&#39;t know how long they would be waiting. She kept an eye on the clock. It only took 15 minutes for Jenkins to return with a dog with raven black fur and bright green eyes.</p>
