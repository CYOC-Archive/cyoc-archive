<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anna frowns as she knows the nanny has brushed her question aside.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Settle down child, it's time for bed! I'll leave you a book to read and then turn the light out and dream, night, night.&quot;  Miss Celeste walked out of the room and closed the door.
<br />

<br />
Anna sat pouting as Circe's thoughts danced in her head. Picking up the book she saw it was a book of short stories of Greek and Roman myths.  Anna page thru the story index and spotted the stories of Circe, Midus, and rural creatures.
<br />

<br />
Circe giggled as Anna read the story of her changing men into swine, bears, wolves, and lions. &quot;Why Circe do you change only men to animals back then, ask Anna&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Men think of women as things of their sexual please! I for one was not going to lower myself before a man and submit as a mare does to her stallion.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Anna was puzzled, &quot;Then your still a virgin even after three thousand years?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;No not quite, I've had men take me and we enjoyed the touch and feeling of our mutual love. Then when the time was right I would set their fate and have them be an animal equal to the way they made love. Some were vile and they became swine! Some were very strong and hugged a lot, they became bears. A few were as if a royal king were there with me so gracious I looked at them as a lion among men. Others were brash became goats, as I think of Lucifer who was so low of whit and manner he ended up slithering on his belly as the snake he truly was. Then I would walk in their midst and they would gambol upon me in hope I would pity them and return their lost manhoed.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Did you ever change any back to their human self, asked Anna?
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yes my dear I did, but found instead of a friend an enemy as they might try to kill me! They all think I was dull of sense and came after me with sword and lance. Burk was a wonderful lover, kind, and regal in his care for me. A massive lion he was for seven beautiful years, and I softened and let him return to his manly self. I remember his eyes the fire and hate for living as a naked beast guarding my house. His hate was still in his face as he threw a lance a narrowly missed my back, said Circe slowly and with deep rememberance.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Burk got away then, suggested Anna?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;No Anna, Burk fled when he saw I was not dead. Fear took his soul as my magic consummed his manhoed. He ran scared, as fast as he could run blind to everthing in his path. It reminded me of scared sheep how they run to and fro never knowing which way to turn. As his feet touched the open field they became hooves. As he looked back to see my anger he sprouted horns. Then as he cried for mercy he bleated as the sheepish ram he was to his death.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Anna paged the small book, a giggle slipped her lips as Circe said that's perfect!
<br />

<br />
A print in the book showed satyr's making love both male and female as of olden days. &quot;Your Nanny a satyr should be, the title alone suggests her new figure, urged Circe as Anna giggled more.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh I think it would be good fun, she's hot on my brother Ken, they often run off together, said Anna.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Anna snuck out of bed and with Circe's guiding way peeked into Miss Celeste's private room. There she stood in her stylish form, neat as a pin to the very last hair on her head. As she made ready for bed a bottle of wine appeared on the nightstand with a note on the neck of the bottle.
<br />

<br />
Seeing it Miss Celeste picked up the bottle and opened the note. &quot;My that sweet child, she said aloud!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;You sent it from me, asked Anna?&quot;
<br />

<br />
The cork gave a pop and the clear yellow liquid poured into a glass. The Nanny picked it up gave a sniff of it's bouquet and took a hardy drink.
<br />

<br />
Undressing before her mirror she inspected her body as a doctor checks for trouble. The glass of wine touched her mouth three more times till she became unsteady. Hands gripped the mirrored dresser as she peered at the reflection.
<br />

<br />
Her long hair now sported shorted bangs which sprouted quickly from her forehead and face. Hair dark and brown covered her face, down her smooth neck, over shoulders, arms, hands, back, chest, stomac, thighs, buttocks, legs, and feet. In seconds her body was a total confusion as pointed ears poked out from her hairdo. White perky horns grew out of her head and curved around her long ears. Hands pursed her flanks as the sensual feelings ran wild in her imagination. Peering into her own eyes the pupils changed from brown to bright yellow. Hands held her face as the magic took her feet to another world. Her stance stretched back as feet grew longer and cloven hooves replace cute toes. Her attention turned to the stranger feeling as she watched with a smile her tail come into view.
<br />

<br />
Miss Celeste walked around the room enjoying her form with notes of sexual delight. Anna giggled as she watched the Nanny spread her legs wide and lower her rump as she used the bedpost on the foot of her bed as a dildo to bring a new thrill.
<br />

<br />
&quot;See Anna the mind of a satyress is consummed with sexual pleasure. The need to be in sexual thralls is paramount! See her lust as the bedpost now brings raw feelings she never thought of when a woman.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The bottle tipped and more wine was swallowed. The Nanny looked at hooflets growing on the end of each fnger. Her hairy palms gave her
<br />
a smile as she said aloud, &quot;I must thank Anna in a proper way for showing me my inner self!&quot;</p>
