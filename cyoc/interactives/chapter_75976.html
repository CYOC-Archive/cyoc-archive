<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Something was lightly slapping me in the face when I woke up.  “Hey, come on, get up,” I heard Colette’s voice <br />
demand.  “We’ve got things to do.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh…like what?” my groggy voice responded.<br />
<br />
“A lot,” she said.  “One step at a time, though.  That first step is breakfast.”<br />
<br />
I sat up and wiped away the sleep.  “You want blood now?” I asked.<br />
<br />
She laughed.  “Of course not,” she said.  “I want real food.  Which I have found we lack.”  Before I could ask <br />
for an explanation, she gave it to me.  “I woke up before you did and I went exploring.  I found the kitchen.  <br />
It’s pretty incredible.  But there is absolutely no food in it.  So I kinda need you to get your ass out of <br />
bed and wish us some food.”<br />
<br />
“Or you could always go buy some,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Uh huh, right,” she nodded.  “Go walk through the woods, go to the store, buy some stuff, and lug it all back <br />
through the woods.  Oh, while wearing a high-heeled, heavy cleavage, leather catsuit, too.  Good plan?”<br />
<br />
“OK, you have me there,” I admitted defeat.<br />
<br />
“Also,” she continued, “This castle is not the best place to walk around naked when there’s no lighting and no <br />
heat.”<br />
<br />
“No heat?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“That’s how it felt,” she answered.  “So how ‘bout some clothes?”<br />
<br />
“What would you like?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“My own clothes would be just fine,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Sure,” I said.  “I wish that an exact copy of your complete wardrobe would be in the castle, and that they’d <br />
be stored in a closet space over there.”  I pointed at one of the walls to indicate where I wanted this closet <br />
to go.  <br />
<br />
A small space was quickly enclosed by walls and a couple of access doors.  Surprisingly the walls were not <br />
stone.  Colette ran over to it and opened the doors.  “There’s no light in here either,” she said.<br />
<br />
I was sick of having to will lights off and on.  “I wish that all lights, torches, whatever in this castle <br />
automatically turn on and off as they are needed,” I said with frustration.  <br />
<br />
“That’s better,” she said.  “It looks like everything is here.  Why did you say ‘an exact copy?’”<br />
<br />
“So that it won’t look like your clothes are missing from your house,” I said.<br />
<br />
“We might want to change the whole ‘no one notices we’re missing’ thing,” she said as she put on a red silk <br />
robe.  “For simplicity.”<br />
<br />
“I can’t think like that yet,” I said.  I wished for a copy of my clothing to appear in its own closet on the <br />
opposite side of the room.  Not surprisingly, my closet was smaller than was Colette’s.  I grabbed a t-shirt <br />
and pair of shorts, which were my normal pajamas.  I also pulled on a pair of socks.  Colette had a pair of <br />
slippers that matched her robe in color.  “I wish we were in the kitchen,” I said.<br />
<br />
Colette was right about the kitchen.  It was huge.  It looked like something that belonged in an old English <br />
estate.  Since this was a castle, I guessed that made sense.  But the kitchen was extremely modern.  It had <br />
top of line appliances, a ton of counter space and a huge island in the middle.  It looked like a chef’s <br />
dream.  Thanks to my wish, the lights came on as soon as we appeared.  Rather than torches, however, this room <br />
had electric lights.  At this point I didn’t really care why there were so many inconsistencies in my castle.  <br />
I chalked it up to knowing nothing about architecture.  <br />
<br />
“What do you want to eat?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I’d love some eggs and toast,” she said.  “Just start with that.”  I wished for the necessary food.  When the <br />
food appeared I just looked at her.  I fully expected her to make the next move.  That was a mistake.  “What, <br />
because I’m the woman I’m automatically doing the cooking?” she asked with scorn in her voice.<br />
<br />
“I…uh…yea, bad idea,” was all I could stammer.  “I’m not great cooking eggs,” I said.  That was true, they <br />
never tasted quite right to me when compared with eggs that I knew were cooked well.  <br />
<br />
“I don’t care,” she said.  “This is about proving you can do it.”<br />
<br />
Making the toast wouldn’t be a problem, I thought.  Then I realized that this was a toaster I’d never used <br />
before so I would have to guess on the settings to make sure it didn’t burn.  I realized I could have wished <br />
to be an expert cook, but for some reason I felt like that would be cheating.  At least I didn’t have to wish <br />
for the necessary utensils, as they were already present.<br />
<br />
So I proceeded to attempt to cook eggs.  The first problem I always have is cracking open the eggs.  They just <br />
never seem to crack properly and I end up getting some on my hands.  “Not very graceful there,” teased <br />
Colette.  I just gave her a look.  She responded by laughing.<br />
<br />
Somehow I was able to get my way through the rest of the process and was able to time everything decently.  I <br />
finished cooking the eggs just as the toast popped.  I got them on a plate and buttered the toast.  As I <br />
placed the plate in front of her, I said, “Be honest.”<br />
<br />
She took a few bites.  “These are good,” she said.  “Not the best I’ve had, but they’re just fine.”<br />
<br />
“You’re not just saying that?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m not just saying that,” she reassured me between bites.  I sat down and ate some of my eggs.  They did <br />
taste better than the last time I’d made them.  I guess I just got lucky.  “It’s funny,” she said.  “I thought <br />
you’d just wish yourself to be a great cook.”  I was in the middle of swallowing a bite of eggs when she said <br />
this.  I nearly choked on them after hearing her say that.  “Are you OK?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Peachy,” I replied in between coughs.  <br />
<br />
“What did I say?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“You know what you said,” I answered.  <br />
<br />
Colette said, “Oh, you mean wishing to be a good cook?”<br />
<br />
“Yea, that,” I said.  “I gathered you wanted me to make an effort, so I thought that would be cheating.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, you’re too cute,” she said.  “Doing all this for me.”<br />
<br />
“Well, of course,” I said.  “Why wouldn’t I?”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, babe,” she said.<br />
<br />
“So since you’re calling the shots right now, what’s on your mind after this?” I asked.</p>
