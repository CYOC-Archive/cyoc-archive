<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yo! Brad, Danny over here!&quot; Zeke called out to his friends. He could see Nate pause for a second in the lull in the story. But Becky Lin was currently checking out in the lunch line. His eyes traced her fine curves. The way she walked with her hips had his complete attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate!&quot; Brad shouted right next to his ear. <br />
<br />
Nate jumped at the sudden sound, somehow completely forgetting he was in public. &quot;What?!&quot; he tried to ease himself, but his eyes were following Becky Lin as she sat with a couple of her friends. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re staring,&quot; Brad shook his head. &quot;And the looks of it a bit too much.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-oh....&quot; Nate tried to defend himself but the outline in his shorts was rather clear. &quot;It&#39;s not like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Brad rolled his eyes and went back to Zeke. &quot;You guys been feeling weird?&quot; He rolled his shoulders again and pulled at his shirt. Every bit of it clinged to his body, showing off his thick muscular chest and strong arms. It was even starting to ride up a bit, showing off a bit of skin between his shorts and shirt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; Danny lied. It was obvious as he was struggling the same way Brad was. His shirt clung to his massive body, which had only been growing since he&#39;d gotten to school. It&#39;d been about 5 hours so now there was a good five years added onto him. His frame was absolutely massive. Boulder shoulders that pushed far out on his sides, making it impossible for his arms to possibly rest next to his waist. The thickness of his arms only seemed to have grown even more, making his biceps swell with powerful muscle. Thick forearms laid right below that, with even bigger hands. His legs had grown just at much. Their size was well adjusted to his massive frame. Each of the four muscles in his quad were fully visible, even if they were hidden behind a thin layer of fabric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t know,&quot; Zeke shrugged. A bit of a smile still tipped out of the side of his mouth. &quot;But,&quot; he returned to his story, &quot;You guys are just in time for me to tell you about last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Brad leaned in. &quot;You&#39;ve been so smiley all day. It&#39;s gotta be good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; Zeke said. &quot;I was with Becky Lin last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Brad tilted his head a bit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Zeke ignored him. He obviously knew something but wasn&#39;t going to say anything. &quot;I was with Becky Lin last night. And it was fucking awesome. Sweet little thing, loves to act all innocent until you get her clothes off. She&#39;s a fucking animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Brad was looking even more skeptical. His eyes rolled over to Nate, knowing full well what Zeke was doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Really,&quot; Zeke continued. His smile only broadened as he saw the dedicated little Christian boy completely forget where he was and was staring intently at the beautiful woman across the way. A hand was padding down his erection while imagining whatever dirty thoughts were going through his mind. All Zeke had to do was mention her perky breasts. Her tight vagina. Or the way she ran her red painted nails over his muscular body as he lay there.<br />
<br />
It was obviously playing in the other man&#39;s head. He&#39;d been crushing on her for years. And now that someone so close to him was describing it in intermate detail was just too real. His hormones were raging, taking over his mind and body. It was impossible to contain himself. He let out a powerful grunt as his hips bucked in the lunchroom chair. Several times. Then his eyes went wide. &quot;Shit...&quot; He muttered. A hand was still obviously on his crotch with three other guys right next to him. <br />
<br />
Nate sprinted out of the lunch room. In his hurry, he tripped over a few people as he rushed to the bathroom. The first thing he did was strip his underwear, making sure the stain wouldn&#39;t travel to his shorts. &quot;Shit...&quot; he looked at the massive load. Twice in one day and it was still like he hadn&#39;t done it in months. Or maybe he was more surprised at the thought of Becky Lin. His cock started to harden again. &quot;Shit! Shit!&quot; he flexed his arms trying to make the blood go elsewhere.<br />
<br />
What he didn&#39;t notice was the changes happening to him. Another 10 pounds was adding onto his body. It was still pretty subtle but to anyone who was able to know, they would have definitely thought he was bigger. Thicker biceps clung to his sleeves. A vein bulged out of it as the blood flowed faster. His shoulders filled them as well giving him a wider frame. Yet with his thin waist he still looked incredibly fit. His toes curled in his shoes as he fought off the erection. <br />
<br />
&quot;Think about anything else. You have to think about something else,&quot; he commanded himself. Though the discomfort in his body maintained. He tried his best to do it, but only softening his cock to a semi hard status. Looking down at his underwear there was no way that they could stay on. Even with wiping out the cum, the wet stain and smell would still permeate his person. He finally gave up his sulking in the bathroom and tossed the pair of underwear in the trash.<br />
<br />
Though as he washed his hands he couldn&#39;t help but look over his body. One of his hands gripped his larger pec. He tilted his head, &quot;is that bigger?&quot; he wondered. But the bell rang. &quot;Shit. Class is starting.&quot; He rushed out of the bathroom to his next class.<br />
-----------<br />
&quot;Dude? Why you lying to Nate?&quot; Brad asked. &quot;You know how much he&#39;s been crushing on her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zeke gave him a devilish smirk. &quot;Just trying to get him an idea of possible things to come...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re being fucking weird today man,&quot; Brad said.</p>
