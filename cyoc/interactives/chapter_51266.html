<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Serenity came out to find that Trevor had woken up again, but was still resting against Lance, Mary's stuffed animal. Paul sat in the chair next to him, still breathing hard from his cracked ribs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on?&quot; Trevor asked, &quot;I woke up to hear a lot of yelling. Sounds like something made the Hardys mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've likely had the best that can happen,&quot; Serenity sighed, &quot;one of my earlier cases came back... apparently because of some problems with her foster family...&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor thought about some of Serenity's cases, as she usually kept him updated on many things. Some things she didn't tell him, but most of them were so old that they had no current relevancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Casii?&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity nodded, &quot;Brian and Felicity thought she was one of Jensen's Pack and attacked her shortly after arrival... although I'd wonder why. Ashley even said that Jensen's glass pups were indestructible...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably just a cat versus dog rivalry,&quot; Trevor dismissed it, not knowing that the lion and wolf did not interact in nature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Serenity continued, &quot;Cassii volunteered to bring Jensen here, to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jensen was here?&quot; Trevor asked, &quot;was he really Jennifer Smith?&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity looked down at the severely injured tabby, who she guessed survived only because of Mary's help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does that matter?&quot; Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Old dreams,&quot; Trevor sighed, &quot;Jennifer Smith is... was... was the queen of Glendale High. Pretty, popular, and had a list of potential boyfriends...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you were on this list,&quot; Serenity sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'd made it to the top of that list when I was transformed,&quot; Trevor nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think you have much choice,&quot; Serenity told him, &quot;he is now permanently male... and seemed to be rather protective of Kaylee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His Alpha Female,&quot; Serenity sighed, &quot;Cassii brought them both here to talk. Brian and Felicity didn't take to kindly to not being able to kill him, but they did manage to free his mind from whatever negative aspects the game had put on it originally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Brian used his turn on them?&quot; Trevor inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually it appears that people can hold more then one turn,&quot; Serenity sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;More then one!?&quot; Trevor gasped, &quot;I thought you'd said that people only hold ONE turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently I was wrong,&quot; Serenity told Trevor, &quot;this curse is so complicated that causes these things. Felicity used her second turn on Jensen, Kaylee, and Alice... it didn't appear to affect Alice at all, but it did free Jensen and Kaylee...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I suppose we're to consider them to be Big Good Wolves now?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; Serenity sighed, &quot;Given that their forms are locked I don't think we can do any more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Jensen's criminal activities?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He seems willing to face justice for it... though apparently, like Ashley, &quot;face&quot; may be the wrong word,&quot; Serenity answered, &quot;he seems willing to &quot;take it&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he'll come back here?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once he's freed his Pack from their brainwashing,&quot; Serenity spoke and then paused for a moment clutching her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The use of turns... Jensen might be freeing his pack as we speak,&quot; Serenity told the tabby.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Julie finished wrapping the bandage around Megan's arm from where the man who had crashed onto their island. Thankfully, his aim was so horribly once Mr. P attacked him that the wounds he dealt weren't serious. The shots had mostly nicked arms or shoulders, and Julie didn't have to worry about removing bullets.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go, dear,&quot; Julie said kindly, &quot;I'd suggest that you rest a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan nodded. Her pastel green fur was bloodstained around the site of the wound, but she found she could still use the arm fairly well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Julie,&quot; Megan told the blond she-wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for staying with the Pack,&quot; Julie told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of us worked for Bart when he was the Smith family patriarch,&quot; Megan explained, &quot;and not all of us were young when we were changed. I wish we could have been given a choice other then merely vague hints... but it isn't like we have any other place to go... and to be honest... I don't think I would feel entirely comfortable among humans. Here, I'm with my own kind. Why did you stay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because my sisters stayed,&quot; Julie spoke, &quot;I contacted Serenity to get Frank back. My joining was &quot;willing&quot; one could guess, but it was mostly because I found that I couldn't harm Alice for taking Abbey and Samantha from me, nothing I did could convince Fran to want to be Frank again... and now, with our forms sealed, our old lives are dead. Fran and Darla may go back to the police while remaining part of the pack, which may be good news to Gill, but they wish to remain with the Pack, with Jensen. And I can't leave my sisters... and Jensen is wonderful...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Megan nodded, &quot;And you'll share him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee is the alpha female, and I can't not share anything with my sisters,&quot; Julie spoke, &quot;Besides, you've mated with Nick... wouldn't you want to stay with him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan slowly nodded. She had a boyfriend before joining the pack, though he likely didn't remember her, and even if he did, unless he willing joined the pack, she didn't think she'd feel entirely comfortable around him anymore. But she couldn't sort that out until she'd sorted things out with her brother.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Will we all fit on that?&quot; Cassii asked as she looked at the bed in the pup's room.<br />
<br />
It looked large enough to hold one teenager sized human, but they were presently smaller then that.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is where we sleep,&quot; Marcy spoke, &quot;Kevin, Jenny, Bart, Amy, and Zelipe all fit on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Although it is starting to get cramped,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;we might need to ask Jensen about investing in another bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So where do we sleep?&quot; Cassii asked, still in her glass wolf form, with only Rachael being visible on her for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;We sleep in the reflection of this room,&quot; Alice explained, &quot;In the mirrorverse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is the only place where we need to sleep, eat, or do things that the rest of the Pack does,&quot; Samantha added.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah ha,&quot; Cassii commented, &quot;but I do not spend ALL of my time as a glass wolf. Wouldn't I therefore require a separate bed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can talk to Jensen about that,&quot; Bart spoke, &quot;if he expects to be a good father, he'll have to at least consider it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassii nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime, I must ask that Abbey and Samantha come with me and gather Ulysses,&quot; Cassii spoke, &quot;Father wishes to speak with him about Mary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our old babysitter!&quot; Abbey and Samantha cheered, &quot;She could help Martha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's one of the Pride now,&quot; Cassii spoke, &quot;and she's currently about my and Alice's age. I think Father wants to talk about her as she might be the only way things between Father and her parents can be settled peacefully.&quot;</p>
