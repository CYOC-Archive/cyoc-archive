<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sir Hammer found a stout loyal mascot steed and rod towards Fairy Tale Forest... but not before being stopped right outside the wizard tower by a little orange squirrel kit mascot wearing a green cape and sneakers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sir Knight! The wizard Azure tells me you&#39;re on a quest from Princess Dawn herself! Please let me aid you!&quot; <br />
<br />
Sir Hammer saw the kit had a guest ID badge strung around his neck, to identify him as a guest who had visited the wizard&#39;s tower to be &#39;magically&#39; transformed into a mascot for one afternoon to live as a part of this fantasy world.<br />
<br />
&quot;What tis thy name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Squire Carl sir knight!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then hope on young squire! There is no time to waste!&quot; The temporary mascot eagerly hopped onto the mascot horse, and the three of them raced into fairy tale forest. The lights and colors were truly enchanting, the faint music filtering through even more so. Phantom lights danced about. <br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take them long to find the goblin causing the trouble. He held up Mr Stuffins, shouted some black magic words that he&#39;d invented himself on the spot, and a pair of kissing deer forest friends turned to stone. Next a group of friendly pixies began shouting and arguing with each other. And he struck a unicorn, enslaving them to be his mount. <br />
<br />
The goblin spotted them and leapt onto the unicorn. &quot;Hahah! You are too late Sir Hammer-head! I! Blububg The Goblin! Now wield the power of the teddy bear! Take it back if you dare!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We do dare goblin!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But do you dare fight your friends!&quot; Blububg mushed as the red-eyed animal friends slowly turned towards the knight and squire. <br />
<br />
&quot;Squire Carl!&quot; Said Sir Hammer as he took out a flute. &quot;Do ye know how to play? The music from this flute from Princess Dawn should free them from the misuse of Mr. Stuffins&#39; magic!&quot; <br />
<br />
Carl was about to say that he had no idea how to play the flute. <br />
But as the now dramatic music of the forest played in Carl&#39;s head, his eyes filled with focus, of course he knew how! And he would help sir knight retrieve the princess&#39; enchanted teddy!<br />
<br />
Carl took the flute, and played it like a pro with his muzzle, the squirrel making the creeping up animal friends hesitate, and the red from their eyes faded as they were freed. <br />
<br />
And the unicorn knocked the goblin off. <br />
<br />
&quot;BAH! Stupid teddy! I command you! Fight for me!&quot; And Mr. Stuffins grew in size, looking ready to be forced to fight the heroes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Squire Carl! I will distract Mr. Stuffins, please smite the goblin so the bear might be free of him!&quot; <br />
<br />
The orange squirrel bravely nodded, taking a short sword and getting off the mascot horse as Sir Hammer fought the giant teddy bear. The young squire &#39;stealthy&#39; (or what a child would consider it such), snuck up behind Blububg, and with one swing cut off the goblin&#39;s head! <br />
<br />
The bear immediately shrank back down to normal and Sir Hammer picked it up. And grabbing his head, Blububg ran away, the unicorn chasing after him. The animals friends all cheered. <br />
<br />
For the handful of goblins who had actual brains in their heads, putting themselves back together itself had become something of a game to see who got what, and seeing what crazy combos they could get away with. The empty shell goblins would just pick whatever limb was nearby that was appropriate, and playing games on them was even more fun... they were goblins, they weren&#39;t supposed to be nice. Only a couple were expected to just wander about Fantasy Kingdom to have their picture taken, the fan favorites, the rest when there wasn&#39;t an event to raid on the rest of Fantasy Land, were allowed to just sit on their rears, belch without saying excuse me, pick their toes, ears and teeth, go to bed without flossing, and in general be a buncha naughty brats. Oh, they were also easy pickings for anyone who wanted to go on adventure to deal with the troublesome goblins. <br />
<br />
Blububg arrived with the unicorn done pursuing him and went over to a table to play a game of cards where cheating was practically part of the game. <br />
<br />
Sir Hammer and Squire Carl then went to an enchanted lake to get a vial of water to restore the two deer friends turned to stone, and where Melody the Mermaid happened to be visiting, and Squire Carl aided Sir Hammer in figuring out a few riddles in exchange for taking the enchanted water from the lake to restore the deer to normal (their colors restored to normal from the slate gray they&#39;d been before). Squire Carl told Melody, &quot;You&#39;re pretty!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks! You can visit one of my concerts later if you like!&quot; <br />
<br />
And the pair rode back to Princess Dawn to return her teddy bear. <br />
<br />
--<br />
Burningstein lounge in his lair. He wasn&#39;t expected to aimlessly wander around the park, for photo shoots (though he didn&#39;t mind having his picture taken of course), except of course when he was expected to raid the castle treasure room after things had been &#39;too quiet&#39;.(His wings weren&#39;t just for show, letting everyone in fantasy kingdom know when a Burningstein event was on!).<br />
<br />
Unlike similar events with the goblins which were intentionally made in the guests and knights&#39; favor, being the top villain of the setting Burningstein was in a unique position. First was Burningstein was actually capable of WINNING the his battles in his lair to protect his stolen treasures or to rob the castle. <br />
<br />
Guests were actually warned this for any who signed up, which just made some even more excited! Also, Burningstein being the big scary dragon, the kids being scared of him and some running away was expected... which might have been why the battle with him was restricted to older kids. <br />
<br />
Being the &#39;top villain&#39; of the setting, he was of course, used sparingly in events, except for those who sought to challenge him in his own lair were free to at any time, where he was EXPECTED to give a even greater challenge. Burningstein took pride in the low percentage of &#39;heroes&#39; who were actually able to defeat him in his own lair, that just made challenging him even more popular, for those who didn&#39;t give up and go back to knocking the heads off goblins.  And then there were guests who just liked throwing themselves at him over and over even if it meant experiencing pretend BBQ over and over.<br />
<br />
And if he lost? Meh, that just mean he got to laze about in his lair more until he had &#39;recovered from his defeat.&#39; <br />
<br />
Then a much much much smaller red dragon flew into the cave entrance, landed, and waved. &quot;Hi dad!&quot; <br />
<br />
Burningstein&#39;s eyes widened, then narrowed at the guest ID badge around the dragon whelp&#39;s neck. <br />
<br />
Burningstein could guess this was quiet the rich kid if he was able to pay in Whimsy Points (which could be earned by winning events) or good old real life money for such a role for an afternoon! Still! For the afternoon, this was his son! And he&#39;d show him by example how a proper dragon did things! <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to see you son!&quot; Burningstein said. &quot;Looking forward to an afternoon of burning and plundering with your old man?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; The little dragon whelped nodded greedily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wrong!&quot; Burningstein boomed. &quot;We plunder, THEN burn! Get it straight!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dad!&quot; Burningstein Jr nodded eagerly at his father&#39;s wisdom. The eerie music subconsciously helped the temporary mascot&#39;s mind get into character for his afternoon of escapism. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a few teenagers who thought that this was all &#39;kid&#39;s stuff&#39; entered the cave, eager to earn some Whimsy Points and exclusive merchandise they could sell on-line. <br />
<br />
&quot;And here come some foolish heroes now! Make me proud son!&quot; <br />
<br />
Smoke and flame came out of the whelp&#39;s mouth.</p>
