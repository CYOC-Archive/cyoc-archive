<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your mom got off the phone and told you, &quot;Well Lilly, you&#39;ll be joining Stella at her obedience school first thing in the morning. And I hope you get something out of it as well. Now off to bed.&quot; You obeyed your mom and made left the room. Tomorrow was going to be dumb and a waste of time, but you figured it wasn&#39;t going to be any real punishment. All you had to do was sit and play dead for a few minutes and you were home free. Sure being a dog meant you couldn&#39;t do your normal activities, but you were sure you could come up with something fun to do. &#39;Hell this entire thing wasn&#39;t going to be a punishment at all, more like a vacation from myself.&#39; You thought as your tiny legs finally got you to your room where you planned to hop into your bed for a nice sleep.<br />
<br />
However it looks like Belle had gotten there first and shut the door right before you got there. &quot;Dogs don&#39;t get to sleep in human beds, especially when they haven&#39;t even been trained yet.&quot; Belle said with a smile. You growled, you weren&#39;t sure how you&#39;d do it, but you&#39;d figure out how to wipe the smile of her face, she was enjoying all this a little too much.<br />
<br />
So reluctantly you made your way to the living room where Stella had an old pillow all to herself, you scooched her over a little bit. Once your nose hit the pillow you instantly remembered that you were supposed to wash the pillow like a week ago and now it seems you were paying for not doing that. You cursed your luck as you drifted off to sleep. You dreamed of crawling through a narrow tunnel on your hands and knees. It might be a sewage pipe it was wet and smelly enough. Finally you emerge into the light and there was a you sized Stella licking your face.<br />
<br />
Light hits your eyes as Stella starts waking up her new &#39;sister&#39;. You got up and shook off the dream only to feel that there was something on your neck. You scratch at it with your rear legs and realize that someone had put a collar and tags on you as you slept. This minor violation of personal space escaped your head when the smell of sausage entered your nose. Breakfast time. You sprinted along with Stella to the kitchen in a race for the sausage, and triumphantly you made it and stood at your mom&#39;s feet in front of the stove panting. Your mom glanced down, and held out a piece of sausage. You tried to snap at it, but your mom pulled away and said, &quot;No, this is for good dogs. This is for Stella. Your breakfast is over there.&quot; Your mom pointed at a bowl of dry dog food and a bowl of water. &quot;I&#39;ll save a piece for you if you do well at obedience school.&quot; Your mom gave Stella a piece of hot sausage as she put the rest into the refrigerator. Cursing to yourself, you wonder to the bowl where you reluctantly had a few mouthfuls of the disgusting smelling sorry excuse for food.<br />
<br />
Finally your sister came in with two leashes which she quickly attached to you and Stella. The three of you made it to the school and you were quickly remembered that Stella was a smaller breed of dog. You had been around your mom and Belle for the last few hours and them being so much large than you didn&#39;t bother you that much, but being dwarfed next to your current peers was a bit intimidating. The class started off well, the teacher gave some sort of speech to the owners, you didn&#39;t pay much attention. Then some basic commands started and you were the instant star of the class hitting every command on the spot. You did it all, sitting, shaking hands, rolling over. The owners were all complimenting your sister for your good work, including some hotshot college freshman who was spending a little too much time talking to. You made your way over to them to break up the conversation, but the college boy&#39;s dog, a muscular greyhound stood between you. The two of you looked at each other for a beat, but the greyhound made the first move breaking his gaze and going around to your hind end and putting his cold nose right up on you. In a panic you barked, well, more like yipped at the greyhound who countered your yip with what felt like an earth rattling bark that was more like a roar to you.<br />
<br />
You started shaking uncontrollably. When the dog barked you felt like you could see all the way into his stomach where it felt like you could end up if you challenged him. Still shaking you felt yourself loosing control, but you didn&#39;t realize how baddly until Belle shrieked, &quot;Lilly!&quot; You turned to face her and stepped in a wet spot. You looked down and were ashamed to see that you had just pissed all over the floor. The teacher walked up and gave Belle a newspaper to discipline you with. Belle gave you a quick smack and rubbed your nose in the urine. You&#39;d never been so embarrassed in your life and were just thankful only Belle knew you were human, but that was still bad enough. Belle said sternly, &quot;You just wait until your mom hears about this!&quot;<br />
<br />
The teacher looked down at you and then at Belle, &quot;If you wish miss, you can sign little Lilly here up for a little weekend getaway at my ranch, think of it as a doggie boot camp for some of the more undisciplined dogs.&quot; You looked up to Belle shaking your head, this did not sound like any weekend getaway you wanted to be involved with.</p>
