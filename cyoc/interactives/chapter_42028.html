<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh no!&quot; Dawn exclaimed as the book glowed.<br />
<br />
Tony threw the book away from him but the blue glow had already attached itself to him. He of course panicked and tried brushing the light away regardless of what Dawn had told him. Soon the glow had completely engulfed his body and he couldn't move. He could feel that his clothes had disappeared and then his body began to tingle.<br />
<br />
The tingling in Tony's body intensified in his scalp. He felt his hair growing longer down to his waist. next the tingling intensified in his face as it rearranged. It moved down to his chest and he felt a strange pressure building on his chest as his shoulders became narrower. The tingling intensified in his legs and he felt his legs split and his butt stretched back moving the two halves of his legs apart. While this was happening he felt an uncomfortable feeling groin which was moving back with half of his legs. He also noticed that he couldn't feel his toes anymore. In fact he couldn't feel his feet. It was like his legs just ended. The tingling shot up in intensity all over his body and he blacked out.<br />
<br />
Dawn knew that Tony was going to be transformed but she didn't expect what happened as the glow surrounded him. She hadn't touched the book but the blue glow shot out of it and engulfed her too. As soon as she got over her shock she figured that she would be transformed into whatever Tony was being turned into. 'Hopefully it's something male' she thought to herself. It was then that the tingling she had felt increased in intensity all over her body and she blacked out.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Dawn had no idea how long she was out but as she came to she realized that she was on her back. She opened her eyes and looked around. She was in the nurse's office with a hospital gown on. She groaned and then she noticed a girl laying on an oversized table. The girl had light sandy brown hair down to her waist. She looked pretty normal up to that point. From the waist down however she had a tan body, four slender legs, and a small tail. Dawn had been hunting when she was Daryn so she recognized it as the body of a deer. She was like a centaur except her lower body was a deer instead of a horse. Dawn wondered what this mythic was called and who it was.<br />
<br />
Tony slowly came to and the first thing that he noticed was that he was laying on his side. The strange thing was that there was more of him than before. He opened his eyes and tried to push himself into a sitting position. Unfortunately that was difficult due to his unfamiliar body. In the end he settled for propping himself up on his elbow. He looked around and saw that he was in the nurse's office and he was wearing a hospital gown. Glancing down he saw the two mounds that were his breasts. This gave him a shock but the biggest shock was what his lower body looked like. He hadn't been hunting in his life but he had seen plenty of pictures of deer and that was what his lower body was. &quot;What am I?&quot; he whispered too shocked to do anything else.<br />
<br />
Just then the same teacher that Dawn had slithered into yesterday came in and said &quot;Miss Thomas, Miss Plunkett, I'm glad to see that you two are awake. Do you have any idea who pushed the bookshelf over onto you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony was stunned. Miss Mackey had just called him Miss Plunkett. She had also said that someone had pushed the bookshelf over on them. He knew that he had accidentally pulled the bookshelf down on top of himself and Dawn hadn't been with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm waiting&quot; Miss Mackey said. &quot;Do you know who pushed the bookshelf over on top of you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give them a break Marla&quot; Mrs. Morgan, the school nurse, said coming in. &quot;They've both suffered a pretty good bump on the head. They're probably a little confused right now. Besides, they probably didn't even see who pushed the bookcase onto them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Mackey sighed and said &quot;This is starting to get ridiculous. Yesterday Miss Thomas falls asleep in the library and someone steals her clothes. Today someone pushes a bookshelf onto Miss Thomas and Miss Plunkett and takes their clothes while they're unconscious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's strange that whoever it is is taking their clothes but leaving their satchels alone&quot; Mrs. Morgan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you two feel up to it you should see if everything is in your satchels&quot; Miss Mackey said.<br />
<br />
Miss Mackey handed Tony a satchel like Dawn's. He looked though it and discovered that all his books were there and his wallet though it was different. Taking it out he looked though it and found all his money was still there. He looked at his student ID. It said that his name was Tanya and showed a picture of a cute girl. Under the species label though it said that he was a &quot;Hind&quot; instead of a &quot;Human&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything's here&quot; Dawn said after looking through her own satchel.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you Miss Plunkett?&quot; Miss Mackey asked. &quot;Is everything in your satchel?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony knew that everything was there and nodded his head still too stunned by all of this to really say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lay back down&quot; Mrs. Morgan said. &quot;I want you girls to remain here for awhile. It wouldn't do to have you getting dizzy in class or the halls. You might hurt yourself if that happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony, or should say Tanya, laid back down. This was all too strange for her. She had been a human boy just this morning and now was a hind girl. She felt like she was going to be sick.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Rick Morgan was in the library putting the books back on the shelf. He had volunteered to do this since he had a couple of free periods before lunch. He was almost finished when he picked up a book and accidentally touched the picture in an open book underneath it. He just had time to notice that the picture was of a female before the book began to emit a blue glow obscuring the picture.</p>
