<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wish that I was a cowgirl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yukiko blinked some at her request, but she complied and waved her wand and the wish was granted. Naomi's attire changed from what she was wearing to that of a typical cowgirl; a cowboy hat, a button up shirt, and a pair of hip-hugging jeans. Naomi looked herself over, laughing at what had just happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I mean...I wish I was a combination of a cow and a girl...&quot; She almost couldn't believe what she was asking for, but it was already out there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't understand,&quot; Yukiko said, a silly grin on her face. &quot;I'll get it right this time.&quot; Again, the busty fairy waved her wand, and there was a bright glow. When it died down, Naomi blinked and looked down at herself, feeling a bit...off. It wasn't a bad feeling, but it was different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did it work?&quot; she asked, looking over at Yukiko, who nodded in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember what I told you? It'll take about five minutes for the changes to be complete. You should already be feeling them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do feel something, but...&quot; At that time, Naomi noticed her shirt getting tighter and looked down at herself, gasping at what she saw. Her chest was getting bigger. &quot;Gah!&quot; she cried as she fell back onto her bed, staring her herself. She was so mesmerized by what she was seeing that she barely noticed when a button burst off of the shirt and smacked into the wall near her mirror. That shock was enough to bring her back to reality. Naomi quickly unbuttoned the shirt and watched as her chest continued growing out, but now there was a new feeling, like something was filling them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yukiko...&quot; she moaned quietly. &quot;What's happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yukiko giggled quietly and fluttered in front of the transforming girl, watching intently. &quot;Cows have milk, don't they?&quot; she asked, grinning at Naomi.<br />
<br />
Of course, she was right. Naomi could feel her chest becoming warm with milk. She cupped her breasts in her hands and jiggled them up and down slowly, giggling at the sensations that ran through her body. Her breasts finally quit growing at around a D, and in spite of being full of milk, they were amazingly perky. But she wasn't finished changing just yet.<br />
<br />
Her hips felt strange now, and Naomi moved her hands down to them, feeling them pressing out against her already tight jeans. They were growing as well. Naomi winced some as her butt began to fill out the jeans, causing them to rip at the seams. &quot;Ow...&quot; she said as her pants continued to shred from her growing legs. Within a few seconds her figure had gone from below average to beyond awesome. She began picking the ripped denim from her legs and putting it aside so that she could continue watching herself change. She estimated that it had been about two minutes at this point.<br />
<br />
A strange warmth suddenly appeared on her stomach, and as she placed her hands on her belly, she felt fur growing near her navel. The hair quickly covered her torso and began working it's way up her chest, causing her to moan at the strange yet pleasant feeling that it generated. At that time, she felt something begin to push at the base of her spine. She stood up slowly, doing her best to keep her balance now that she had her new chest. It was surprising easy, actually. Her body had adapted itself to her new figure already. The girl turned around so that she could see her backside in the mirror and laughed quietly at the tail that was wagging just above her butt. &quot;How cute,&quot; she said, causing Yukiko to laugh at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look like you're enjoying yourself,&quot; the fairy said, looking Naomi's new figure over. &quot;How does it feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing!&quot; Naomi replied as she fell back on her bed, rubbing her chest gently. &quot;I wonder how my milk tastes...&quot; Her body was mostly covered in the black and white fur that many cows had, only her hands, feet, and face weren't fully changed yet. That was rectified quickly. Her hands and feet didn't undergo many changes, they were merely covered in fur. Her face, however, pushed out ever so slightly, stopping somewhere in between human and bovine. It was still cute, nonetheless. The final change was her ears, which became somewhat floppy. The change was finally complete.<br />
<br />
Naomi smiled as the feeling in her body disappeared. She sat up slowly and looked up at Yukiko, who was grinning down at her. &quot;How do I look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cute,&quot; Yukiko said as she examined her handiwork. &quot;Yeah, I did a pretty good job, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; Naomi said as she lifted one of her breasts to her mouth, suckling on her nipple gently, resulting in a stream of milk that flowed into her mouth. &quot;Mmm...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, is there anything else you need right now, Naomi?&quot;</p>
