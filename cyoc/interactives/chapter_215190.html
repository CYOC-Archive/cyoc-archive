<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Veles wasn’t sure how to deal with Oswin.<br />
<br />
The buff stag was super-hot with his bulging muscles and delightful musk, but his sense of morality was damaged. And now the ranger was crying over it. Not the sexiest look, but at least he was sensitive. <br />
<br />
Veles narrowed his eyes.  Oswin seemed to have too detailed of a backstory for a simple NPC. Plus, he seemed introspective and self-aware of his own failings. The new cougar couldn’t help but wonder if Oswin had once been another player.  <br />
<br />
Then again, Veles wasn’t sure who else could even show up at this point – most everyone was accounted for.  Plus, it was apparent that Oswin had been in this world a long time.  Unless Finn had wiped his memories, the stag was simply an NPC. <br />
<br />
And if Oswin was just an NPC, then maybe Veles could steer him a bit more. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry…” Oswin’s eyes were watering. He wiped the tears away. “It just upsets me when I remember these things. It’s easy to say you’d be a good person when you are on the outside.”<br />
<br />
“I think I get it.” Veles said, “But there’s magic here, you know?”<br />
<br />
“I know. Ein used to say we needed faith. He was a druid. Well, he read a few of their surviving books and claimed to be a druid, anyways.” Oswin shrugged, “But it didn’t save him. Didn’t save the druids either, so what good were their ideals and morals?”<br />
<br />
“It gave them hope.” Veles pushed.<br />
<br />
“False hope!” Oswin sniffled but managed to calm himself down, “I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“You say that a lot.” Veles pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Ein, I just.”  Oswin paused as he stared as the table, “I just want you to like me.”<br />
<br />
Oh. Hell, no.<br />
<br />
“Veles.” Veles corrected.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“It’s Veles. I’m not Ein.” Veles said firmly. <br />
<br />
“Right, right. You know, the name is open.” Oswin said hopefully.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to be very blunt with your Oswin.” Veles replied. “That’s creepy. Look, I’ve been ‘in love’ with, like, two other guys now. I like you, I do, but I think you might need to slow down a bit. I’m not Ein, and I’m never going to be.”  <br />
<br />
”But… you do like me, then?” Oswin asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
Veles lay a paw in Oswin’s lap, but where he had expected to find a pair of soft thighs, he instead found himself pressing down on Oswin’s very aroused cock.<br />
. <br />
“Ah-!” Veles’s eyes widened, “T-that, thats-!”<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, I know it was just an accident,” Oswin winked and intentionally twitched his cock.<br />
<br />
Veles made to snatch his paw back, but the buck’s hoofs held his paw in place. Holding the handsome puma’s gaze, Oswin used the paw to stroke his junk, spreading his legs to let the puma have easier access to his package. This wasn’t good! He was accidentally falling into this guy’s fantasies, and in a world where the concept of erotic roleplay meant quite literally changing into your lover’s fantasy, Veles knew that this wouldn’t have a happy ending for him.<br />
<br />
Or, rather, it would.  Veles was sure that Oswin and a gay, lusted up version of whoever Ein was would be quite happy together.  But Veles wanted to remain Veles, rather than lose his mind to Ein.<br />
<br />
He tried to push away from the stag just as the deer tugged him forward. Veles found himself in another kiss, muzzle locked in with the handsome herbivore. It was so easy to just give in to that insistent kiss, but Veles summoned his willpower and shoved the stag away.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I forgot you liked it rough,” Oswin licked his lips and began doffing his clothes.<br />
<br />
Around them, the rest of the lodge had gone from playful cavorting to a fully on orgy. Jacques was plowing a raccoon behind the counter of his bar while another coon was behind the big bear, eating out his ass. Ami’s daddy was balls deep in the twink, fucking him right on the table, huffing and puffing, belly stroking the boy off.<br />
<br />
“Oswin, come on,” Veles rolled his eyes, “We just met-”<br />
<br />
The stag leaned over and ripped off the puma’s shirt and vest, tossing them to the floor. <br />
<br />
“No, you’re Ein. We’ve known each other since we were kids,” The stag panted, shoving his leather pants to the floor and kicking them away. His cock and balls were exposed, a wash of musk wafting off them into Veles sensitive nostrils.<br />
<br />
“Oswin…” Veles’ own cock hardened as he took in the stag’s masculine odor. “I’m not Ein.”<br />
<br />
“No? You’re so big and strong and smart. Look, even that old bear Jacques thought you were Ein. He couldn’t be wrong.” Oswin said, sliding the puma’s pants off and kissing him tenderly.<br />
<br />
“Y-you’re playing with my mind,” Veles mumbled into the stag’s mouth. <br />
<br />
“Veles is a fox. You’re a puma named Ein,” Oswin whispered, kissing him more deeply.<br />
<br />
Whatever the kiss was, it wasn’t magic. Deep down inside, Veles could feel that the axe had implanted something in him, almost like a seed. All that Oswin was doing was making Veles comfortable in Ein’s body – and comfortable with Oswin’s body pressed up against that. The Ein identity was there, in the back of his mind, and Oswin just wanted him to accept it. <br />
<br />
The stag’s hooves played over Veles’ new body, massaging the new, bulgier muscles. It wasn’t his body, but at the same time, he recalled having it his whole life. <br />
<br />
“Oswin,” Veles hissed as a hard hoof dipped into his pants and played with his tailhole. “Stop…”<br />
<br />
“Just be my Ein for me,” Oswin murmured, knuckling the puma’s prostate, listening to him yowl while his tubular tail twitched lustfully.<br />
<br />
“Please…” Veles whimpered.<br />
<br />
“Fine,” Oswin said as he lifted his kitty and carried him in his muscular arms to the main bed chamber at the head of the temple. “I’ll convince you.”<br />
<br />
Veles found himself rubbing against the stag, enjoying his musky scent.  They moved, the stag skirting around the various lovemaking going on in the former temple. If it hadn’t been desecrated before, it certainly was now. The stag opened a door and Veles found himself being carried into a room with stained glass windows. <br />
<br />
This must have been the atrium of the temple, where the sacred altar was. But where was-<br />
<br />
With a thump, Veles found himself dumped unceremoniously on top of a marble platform. Someone had rolled out several bedrolls, turning the former altar into a proper bed. Oswin climbed up onto the altar on top of the puma.<br />
<br />
“You didn’t just bring your puma friend back for his ass, did you? You can get plenty of that,” Veles growled, groping his crotch and revealing his long pink panther dink, “This… this is one of a kind, isn’t it?”<br />
<br />
“You’re right,” Oswin smirked, “I never got to taste that cock, but I always wanted to.” <br />
<br />
Oswin rocked forward, grinding his cock into the puma’s face. Veles choked as the source of the stag’s virile musk slapped his muzzle. “But a cougar like you has all sorts of assets for me to enjoy.”<br />
.<br />
Veles once again shoved Oswin back, before growling, “You did not set up a romantic evening and start it off by shoving your junk in my mouth.” <br />
<br />
“H-heeh,” Oswin made a weird face and let out a dorky giggle.<br />
<br />
Veles wanted to slap him, but the buck shifted and Veles’ nose was now at the spot where the shaft met sack.  It was warm and soft and humid with scent gathered over the day. <br />
<br />
The puma breathed in deep, savoring the dry and high, rich yet subtle aroma. He pursed his lips and tilted his head up a bit, lifting his nose beneath the heavy, meaty weight of the buck’s shaft while coming to meet those fat balls in a soft kiss.<br />
<br />
Above him, the stag sighed and shifted again, this time pressing himself more fully against Veles’ face.<br />
<br />
The puma smiled against the deer’s fat sack and nuzzled himself deeper, letting the soft fur and softer skin press and spread against his lips and chin, huffing that delightful musk some more. He swallowed thickly and let out a shuddering sigh, his own breath caught and reflected back at him, heavy and tainted with the buck’s heavy musk.<br />
<br />
Oswin spread his legs further, his shaft giving a twitch, and jumped atop Veles’ muzzle. <br />
<br />
Veles responded by flicking out his tongue, pressing it against the deer’s sack, lapping at it, then turning his head and lapping at the space between the deer’s legs and groin, washing the crevice with saliva. <br />
<br />
He drowned in the flavor, salty and spicy with musk, his raspy tongue cleaning and sucking out all the grunge of the day from the buck’s soft white groin fur. Cleaning was what big cats like him did best, though he’d never cleaned someone else like this before. He realized that he’d also never cleaned himself, since he’d only been a cat for about two hours at most…<br />
<br />
Oswin groaned and shifted, and Veles found himself reaching up and lifting those fat orbs before curling out his long tongue and pulling them between his lips. They were firm yet with a distinct give to them, so hot, churning with seed. They almost felt like they were floating with the skin of the buck’s sack, moving freely and pulsing to the touches of Veles’ tongue and his soft, careful suckling.<br />
<br />
The buck’s cock was leaking, dribbling precum that trailed down his balls into Veles’ suckling mouth. Oswin’s sweet precum mixed with the salty, pungent musk in a delicious sweaty mix. Both balls rolled over his tongue. He curled and suckled one, then another, pressing them against each other and then the roof of his mouth.<br />
<br />
Soon, both balls were soaked in Veles saliva and he let them out with a gentle pop, then nibbled on the foreskin between the two. Oswin groaned, throwing his head back and closing his eyes as Veles lapped at the base of his sweaty cock. Veles slathered the buck’s spire with more saliva, and soon the big doebreaker was slick with pre and spit.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, Ein. Want me to fuck that tight ass of yours?” Oswin gasped.<br />
<br />
Veles could only moan, voice too muffled by the stag’s juicy crotch to reply.<br />
<br />
Oswin backed up and lifted the puma legs over his shoulders. Veles’ perfect pink pucker trembled as the buck stroked himself and spat on his paws. One nimble hooflet reached out and rubbed the cougar’s entrance, making the muscle twitch and spasm and Veles to moan.<br />
<br />
The stag’s sizeable cock circled that perfect hole, the deer gripping it and rubbing it up and down against the cougar’s tailhole. More moans dripped from the cat’s mouth. Oswin grinned, leaning forward to kiss the kitty before the tip of his big dick slipped into the cat’s tailhole.<br />
<br />
Veles whined as he felt his insides stretching and arranging to fit that fist-thick rod being shoved inside of him.<br />
<br />
Oswin grunted, pushing his fat cockhead further into the cat’s tight little anus. He used the cat’s hips as handles to pull him down around his turgid length at the same time. Veles’ arched his back as the stag bottomed out, banging his balls against the puma’s own sack. The puma’s cock twitched and spat precum as the doebreaker nudged his prostate.<br />
<br />
“O-Oswin!” Veles gasped.<br />
<br />
“You like that, Ein?”<br />
<br />
The stupid deer wouldn’t stop calling him that name!<br />
<br />
However, when he opened his mouth to protest, all that came out was a mewl as the buck started hammering away vigorously at the cat’s tight hole. Veles rump quivered and shook each time the stag’s doebreaker cannoned into it, never slowing. The loud sound of slapping fur and flesh filled the room along with the grunts and whines of both males desperately fucking. Veles clutched about, finally settling for the buck’s powerful torso as waves of overwhelming pleasure assaulted his tailhole.<br />
<br />
Veles wanted to scream, nuzzling deep into his new lover’s thickly furred chest as his prostate was relentlessly pummeled by Oswin’s fat cock. <br />
<br />
And while his body was being assaulted by Oswin’s cock, his sensitive feline ears were filled with the sounds of the full-on orgy proceeding outside. The puma couldn’t concentrate, his senses were being overwhelmed and all he could think of was the thick dick in his backdoor. Veles mewled and whined, muscles tensing and claws popping from his toes as they curled. It was so good, all he could feel was warmth radiating from his pucker as it was stretched.<br />
<br />
“Ein!” Oswin gasped, calling the puma’s name.<br />
<br />
Veles could feel it then. There was an air of anticipation hanging in the temple. A light began to glow from below the two lovers as they writhed on the marble altar. Something was happening!<br />
<br />
“Ah! Oswin, s-stop!” Veles cried as the light grew brighter and brighter. The stag’s cock slammed against his prostate, making the puma choke, “Ngh!”<br />
<br />
The light engulfed the two lovers. Veles could see some of it curl and bend around his muzzle before it slipped into his mouth. His eyes widened as he felt the warmth invade him and wrap around the seed that had been implanted earlier. Veles had anticipated that Ein would try to bloom inside of him, but whatever this was spread from Ein’s seed and into Veles’ own magic.<br />
<br />
He could feel it shaping his abilities into some other form of magic, a more primal one. No! Veles tried tugging back. That was his power! He was a mage who could use soul magic.<br />
<br />
Above him, light had entered the stag’s mouth. Oswin was too engrossed in sex to care, his musclegut bouncing as he thrust vigorously into Veles’ ass. An ass that was growing plumper and a pucker more pliable as the light caressed it.  It began to wobble every time Oswin’s dick spread his hole wide.<br />
<br />
Veles yowled, his concentration slipping. He clutched his handsome buck close, feeling his heavy muscles strain and flex under his paws. The primal energy surging through him took it as an opportunity adjust his power, transforming it into more of itself. As the magic altered his own, he felt his fur grow rougher, muscles slightly thicker. <br />
<br />
“Ein, Ein, Ein,” Oswin groaned, relentlessly thrusting into his pretty kitty as Veles mewled and yowled around the deer’s fat cock.<br />
<br />
The stag’s antlers were glowing, golden runes dancing across his body. Ein realized the spirits of this place were inhabiting them, filling them with nature’s power. It felt good to become one with the forest. But it wasn’t HIS power – whatever it was belonged to the new presence taking root in his mind! <br />
<br />
Veles pressed Ein’s spirit out of his head, the dead puma wrestling with him for control. Oswin thrust again and the dead soul forced itself back in, shoving Veles out. He felt oddly disconnected, like he was floating away…<br />
<br />
“P-please, Oz, stop!” Veles moaned as his mind snapped back to his own body, only to find himself once again distracted by his hole spasming around the meat stuffing it.<br />
<br />
Ein wrenched control back. He could feel the natural energies of nature as they flowed through him. Flecks of white appeared on his muzzle. He was a few years older than the buck, after all, almost entering his middle years. But that wasn’t right, either. Dead people didn’t age.<br />
<br />
Wait, dead?!<br />
<br />
Ein’s mind filled itself in as he recalled being held down while a bear poured a foul tasting liquid into the funnel that had been jammed into his mouth.  He remembered his arms and legs growing stubbier, his tail growing thicker, his body growing larger.  And then the cold. His new body was so slow and so cold.  He’d tried to run but…<br />
<br />
The mayor had killed him, slowly, by letting his new body’s inability to survive the cold deal with the rebel who had almost burnt down his mill. Any caught helping him were reduced to slimes, forced into the outhouses to eat the excrement that piled up there.<br />
<br />
That was what had been done to some of his immediate family members when they’d tried to save him, Ein recalled.<br />
<br />
The rest of his family? Disgraced, forced to work in the streets, a permanent reminder of what happened to those who crossed Rodrigo. It was all so horrible. Was still horrible.<br />
<br />
Why was he here?<br />
<br />
Ein glanced around, realizing they were on the ancient temple altar and managed to put the pieces of the puzzle together quickly. Oswin had brought someone back here to fuck, and for some reason, the temple had chosen to attempt to reincarnate himself into this stranger’s body.<br />
<br />
The ghost probed his new mind. <br />
<br />
There were other lives here. A ram named Hagerd. A fox named Veles. A troubled young human named Chuck. All of them were here, tucked away. Ein had no idea who the real original soul was, but it was mighty crowded in this body. He moaned as his beloved Oz stretched his hole nicely.<br />
<br />
Hold on, beloved Oz?<br />
<br />
As far as Ein knew, he wasn’t gay. Or hadn’t been, not until he woke up with a cock up his ass. Just his luck. With the blissed-out expression on Oz’s face, it was clear this was the buck’s greatest fantasy. Ein couldn’t help but feel his heart flutter when he looked at him and it wasn’t solely because of the cock pounding his pucker.<br />
<br />
Another mind intruded on his.<br />
<br />
“S-stop, Ein!” Veles cried. “You’re taking away my soul magic! You can’t win without me!”<br />
<br />
Ein was struggling to get back into his body when he heard Veles. The ghost paused. That’s right, without a soul magic user to Trim away the curse, Rodrigo couldn’t be deposed. The magic eating away at Veles’ slowed to a stop.<br />
<br />
“T-that’s right! Let me live!” Veles pleaded.<br />
<br />
Ein considered this stranger’s body. He wanted to come back. Being alive was far better than the strange dislocating existence of a spirit. But Veles had a point. Their magic was incompatible, and if he wanted his revenge on Rodrigo, he NEEDED Veles.<br />
<br />
The light receded and Veles found himself gasping in his boyfriend’s… in Oswin’s arms. The buck snarled and came, cock spewing loads of cum into Veles’ hole. The puma yowled, his own cock firing off. The glow faded away completely, though Veles could still see the spirit hovering nearby.<br />
<br />
“I love you, Ein,” Oswin whispered.<br />
<br />
“I love you too, Oz,” Veles whispered back.<br />
<br />
It would be better if the stag thought he was Ein. That was the only reason Veles wasn’t protesting right now. The two lovers panted and wheezed on the altar before falling asleep under the watchful gaze of a ghostly puma, hovering just slightly above him.</p>
