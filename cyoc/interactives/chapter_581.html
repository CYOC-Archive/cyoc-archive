<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle couldn't believe Jennifer had switched the situation and asked him transform or dare.Kyle was going to reply fast hoping that Jennifer wouldn't come up with
<br>
 anything in the time period. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I choose transform you bitch!&quot;Kyle yelled at her hoping to rattle her into not choosing a transformation. 
<br>

<br>
 Kyle couldn't see the smile Jennifer had on her face on the other end of the phone.Jennifer was going to have her revenge for being dared to have an orgasm every
<br>
 time her name was said.She had never been so embarrased so it was Kyle's turn to be embarassed. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Funny that you referred to me as a bitch Kyle.&quot;Jennifer replied smugly over the phone. 
<br>

<br>
 Kyle became pale and swallowed nervously on the other end. &quot;Because that's the only thing you will have sex with as a DOG!&quot;Jennifer laughed pleased with her
<br>
 choice and quickly hung up before Kyle could reply. 
<br>

<br>
 Kyle held the phone in a sweaty grip as Jennifers words rang in his ears.&quot;A DOG!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Kyle felt itchy all over as he hung up the phone.It was already starting he had to find someone to ask the transform or dare before he was on all fours barking
<br>
 unable to talk.If that happened he would be a butt sniffing dog forever.Kyle was suddenly assaulted with all kinds of smells filtering through his cold damp
<br>
 nose.&quot;Wait a minute my nose wasn't cold and damp before!&quot;Kyle thought.He quickly ran to the bathroom to see what was happening to himself.In the mirror Kyle
<br>
 could see that his nose was black at the tip,and his ears were pointy with hair at the tips.His hearing was incredible now.He could hear the bus as it drove off.&quot;He
<br>
 had missed his bus!How was he going to find someone to ask the transform or dare now!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 It was the morning and his parents along with others in the neighborhood were at work.Now all the kids were on their way to school,like he was suppose to
<br>
 be.Kyle held his head in his hands in distress.That's when he noticed his finger nails were thick black and pointy.He had to find someone before he was a full
<br>
 dog!Kyle ran outside a bulge peaking out on his tail bone. 
<br>

<br>
 Mean while Jennifer laughed to herself thinking about Kyle running around on all fours sniffing dog's butts.She found her other sock but couldn't find her
<br>
 panties.She decided she was already late so her panties would have to wait.Her green and yellow cheerleading outfit would hide her bare rear.Jennifer started to
<br>
 walk to school already missing her ride. 
<br>

<br>
 As Kyle ran towards the school his clothes felt itchy and restricting.He went to a nearby lawn and began to rip and tear off his clothes with his sharp claws and
<br>
 now even sharper teeth.He felt a uncomfortable lump on his tail bone as he sat on the grass.Looking at his rear he noticed a hairy 12 inch tail.Panic began to set in
<br>
 as Kyle began to run again.His black once toe nails now claws clicked on the side walk as he ran.Kyle felt his thighs cramp as he ran,soon he could no longer run
<br>
 up right.He went to all fours as his legs shortened to match his arms.Kyle then smelled an incredible scent up ahead.It was definately a woman.He had to get to her
<br>
 before he lost his voice,so he could ask the transform or dare.Kyle could feel a full grown tail between his hairy rear legs as he ran toward the woman.The scent
<br>
 coming from her was very pleasant to his long dog snout.When he reached the girl he realized it was Jennifer in her green and yellow cheerleading outfit walking to
<br>
 school. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;How appropriate!&quot;Kyle thought.To turn the table on the same girl that tried to change him into a dog.Kyle swallowed then yelled truth or dare,but all that came out
<br>
 was.&quot;Rufff!Ruffff!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Jennifer was startled by a dog barking behind her.She turned around and saw the fading features of Kyle as his ass narrowed and his torso elongated into a more
<br>
 canine shape. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well!How do you enjoy your new form?&quot;Jennifer laughed as she patted Kyle's shrinking,elongating head. 
<br>

<br>
 Kyle was devastated he was going to be a dog forever.Kyle couldn't resist sniffing under Jennifer's skirt.Kyle's wet nose on Jennifer's bare rear made her giggle. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;How do you like sniffing girls rears,because I'm afraid that's as close to sex you will get from a woman from now on!&quot;Jennifer laughed as she pushed Kyle's snout
<br>
 away. 
<br>

<br>
 Kyle noticed a female dog and was unable to resist running to the bitch.Jennifer laughed at the sight.</p>
