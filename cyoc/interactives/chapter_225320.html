<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I hope he won&#39;t mind 3 clowns... or the fact he&#39;s temporarily married to a man.&quot; She sighed with a happy giggle before hitting enter.<br />
<br />
While Pipi (Miranda) and Bozo (Alex) were practicing in the room over, Laura (mom) was planning something more fun and spectacular. While the others had to practice being clowns, she decided to treat herself and join then for a bit... maybe more as she set her change for a few weeks rather than a week like she did for them. In the privacy of her room, she began to undress because after all, she couldn&#39;t let her new body ruin her clothes. Ever since she was in college, she wanted to be a clown after dating one for a while. He taught her a few party tricks but it sadly didn&#39;t last. Though she could admittedly never get him out of her head. A little part of him living in there.<br />
<br />
She had designed what she thought was the perfect clown... though also wanting more. She knew all the tips and tricks a clown could know and then some. She giggled madly as the changes began with her breasts making whoopee cushion noises as the nipples looked familiar to those of a whoopee cushion&#39;s nozzle. She giggled as her new moobs flopped around and jiggled, playfully taking a nipple to her mouth and shuddering a bit before blowing in. The pancake began to puff up somewhat before she let go, it held its shape but let out a long toot from her nipple as she pressed down, stifling a moan.<br />
<br />
The next part of the change came as her hands began to swell and merge, becoming 3 bulbous fingers attached to a grubby chubby mitt. Her arms slowly swelling with fat as she couldn&#39;t help but giggle at the jiggly feeling washing over her. Her arms disproportionate to her body but not for long as her torso began to gurgle, her bellybutton sinking in as her belly surged out with skin and fat, sloshing around as she shook from side to side. Occasionally she peeked out the window to make sure he&#39;s not inside yet. Her legs swelling larger as her ass was flat for a brief moment before bursting out with her hips and tush. A large pear shape to her body now.<br />
<br />
She giggled and shook her giant belly with her large hands before seeing something peeking from beneath it. 2 feet slowly growing much MUCH larger, becoming a men&#39;s 17! The 3 bulbous fat toes tipping the massive feet. She could hardly wait for the next parts. After all, she wanted to be a MALE clown. She began to grunt and groan as she leaned on a table, her pussy starting to feel off... but pleasurable. Her large hand holding her unchanged head as she noticed her skin turning white amongst the intense feeling in her crotch. She tried to cover her mouth to quiet the moans a bit but it was too much and one managed to escape her mouth as a giant sack plopped out with one ball in it before being followed by a second, her clit being the only thing left about her pussy... though a closer look would reveal that her... or rather his clit looked differently from a normal one. Sticking his thumb into his mouth and blowing... revealed his dick to start growing bigger, still soft as a marshmallow but much bigger, still small compared to his... basketball sized nuts.<br />
<br />
An itching feeling began to spread across his body as the next change began. Her head definitely being saved for last. As his cock shrank back to the microscopic size, some soft stubble began to form around it before blooming into a massive rainbow bush. Though this wasn&#39;t bodyhair... it was fur. He was never a fan of how rough curly bodyhair was so he decided to simply used fur since it was soft and put it in a bodyhair pattern. His dick rapidly being hidden as the giant fluff mound grew, coating his balls completely as it spread up over his belly in a thick and soft treasure trail. His fingers diving into the long and thick trail up his belly as it went between his mounds and coated his chest in soft and silky fur. Though the fur began to grow in more areas, on his back then growing down to coat his ass, on his arms on the top, his legs, covering them completely and finally coating the tops of his feet. The best came last though.<br />
<br />
His head began to feel weird as his neck fattened up some, his voice becoming low yet goofy as he coughed. His hair beginning to fall out on the top except for a little curly rainbow tuft in the middle. The hair around his head began to shorten and turn into a bright rainbow curly ring around his head. He giggled then chuckled when seeing his beautiful head with such male baldness. His nose began to hiss before popping into a giant red ball, playfully honking it. His lips beginning to turn permanently red and into a grin before laughing with a loud &quot;hyuk&quot;. His face slowly growing more chubby and masculine as his eyebrows became painted on arches. His teeth becoming comically large, cartoon-like. He was completely unrecognizable to the hot milf he once was. He grunted and gave a loud fart which shook the floor. The clothes on the floor began to rise up suddenly and spin around him, forming a colorful clown jumpsuit with frills and pom poms, though underneath he could feel something cushioning, not to mention this thing hiding his massive crotch which he was thankful for. As clown shoes formed around his feet, he sighed in relief and decided what to do...</p>
