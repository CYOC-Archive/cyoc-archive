<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sid shut the door to his postage-stamp bedroom which connected to the small common room of the dorm he shared with Dave.  Outside, the remaining three could hear the raucous sounds of Sunday night partying still going on as their fellow students tried desperately the cram the last few vestiges of freedom into their lives before returning to the daily routine of class.  The remaining guys looked at each other, silently, unsure of what to do during their "break".<br /><br />

"Well, I suppose..."<br /><br />

The Incubus tried not to look at Chris and -instead- stood up and walked towards the door to the hallway.  "Shut up, Chris," he muttered in a pained tone.<br /><br />

The humanoid rabbit looked startled and one ear drooped at the sharp tone of the demon's words.<br /><br />

"Dave...  What's...?"<br /><br />

"That's not my name anymore, remember?" he responded, with a rumble of ferocity in his voice.  He didn't look back but paused with his hand on the doorknob.  "Look, guys, I don't belong here.  I ... I need to go..."<br /><br />

The miniature Tyler jumped off his chair and jogged across the floor.  Luckily, he now-altered clothing fitted his two-foot-six height perfectly.  "Wait a sec; please...!" he shouted, in his high voice.<br /><br />

The demon stopped and turned around, but didn't look down.  He focussed on the far wall, not wanting to look at either of the desiccated corpses that were his friends.  It didn't help.  Even the wall looked faded, peeled and broken.  No matter where he looked, he only saw endings.  "What...?" he asked, coldly.<br /><br />

"Look, we've got to finish playing; I know that you're feeling the stress of these ...changes... but, well, if we don't finish the game we'll never know if we could've beat them..."<br /><br />

"Tyler," said the demon without looking down, "I'm cursed.  I'm a demon.  I have few emotions, no Name, can only see things in their final moments and -now- can only get off if I truly love the person I'm with:  something, I need not remind you, that I had trouble doing even <i>before</i> I became a seven-foot-six sex-god..."<br /><br />

"Yeah, but..."<br /><br />

The demon waved off Tyler's interruption.  "Look, I'll be back, Ok?  I'll keep playing with you guys; I already agreed to, right?"  He sighed heavily and looked down for a second; the mutilated corpse of the tiny man looking back at him, still scribed with the demon's former name over his face in deep cuts.<br /><br />

<i>This doesn't bother me ... this doesn't bother me ... this doesn't bother me...</i><br /><br />

"I'll be Ok," he said, aloud, looking back at the far wall, again.  "I'll avoid people; I just want to go for a walk by the lake, Ok?"<br /><br />

Chris stood and went to stand next to the miniature man and looked up at his sometime boyfriend.  "You want me to go with you?"<br /><br />

The demon sighed again.  "Look, Chris, I ... I guess I don't hate you; it was just resentment from all that fame and fortune you got.  But ...well... even though it's passed, I just don't feel right being with you right now...  Not as boyfriends at any rate..."<br /><br />

The rabbit's face fell, his eyes growing wide and his lower lip quivering just a bit.  "What are you saying?"<br /><br />

"I'm saying," came the cold reply, "that we should see other people..."<br /><br />

Chris looked shocked and stunned.  He shook his head, his rabbit ears flopping to and fro as he tried to deny the weight of the words just spoken to him.  "Look, Dave, it's just the game making you say that...  You see?  Just the game!"<br /><br />

The demon turned away, still without looking at the rabbit, and opened the door to the hallway.  "The game?  Maybe, hon..."  He stepped through and continued to speak over his shoulder.  "But in the end, even before we sat down to play, I just wasn't all that happy..."<br /><br />

The door closed and Chris stumbled backwards, catching himself against Sid's chair as he started to cry.

<hr />

Sid had ripped off the remains of his clothes and immediately gone to his bed to lie down and start jerking off.  Still towering in his height thanks to Tyler's modification of him, the lion's feet stuck out over the bottom of his bunk by a foot or so.  The cool air against his paw pads felt good as he unleashed his lusts by gripping his erection in his hands and starting to jerk off fast and furiously.<br /><br />

Groaning heavily, the lion slid his soft, fur-covered paws up and down along his stiff cock, feeling just how great it was to have such a texture against himself.<br /><br />

He flexed and groaned, his giant muscles and increased mass making his bed creak and shudder under him as his hips rose and fell rhythmically.  His tail, sticking out to one side, lashed to and fro with a wicked beat, keeping in time with his grunts and -now- snarls.<br /><br />

It felt so good ... better than the best sex he'd had in all the years he'd been sexually active!  Baring his fangs, Sid totally lost himself in the sensation, feeling his leonine balls slap-slap-slapping against his inner thighs as he curled his oversized toes and feet to the pulse of his lusts and desires.<br /><br />

Closing his eyes, he could feel his body humming with lust and power:  his muscles were just one source of it.  Deeper down, he felt as if he were expanding ...growing... bigger and bigger with each thrust of his hips, savagely into the soft space in his palm.<br /><br />

Indeed, had anyone been able to watch him, they would have seen the massive, 7'6", impossibly muscled monstrous lion start to inflate, again.  As he snarled and growled, his breaths pulled in more and more air; his belly puffing outwards full, taut and round.<br /><br />

His free paw found the new shape of his body, and its steadily increasing diameter, to be strangely erotic; his fingers splayed over the surface as he jerked off and expanded with his deep, feral breaths.<br /><br />

A big, snarling smile spread over the lion's face.  He could feel himself near climax ... near to the biggest climax of his life!<br /><br />

His sex, buried in his massive paw, was normally sized for a man his age but it felt so much more <i>potent</i> in his current state of mind!  Sid groaned, louder and louder, his climax approaching as his chest and -now- arms and legs too, began to look thicker and rounder...<br /><br />

His whole body was expanding as if some sort of parade balloon!<br /><br />

Stroking both his six-inch cock an bulging, three-foot-plus belly, he could feel his balls churning and tingling...  His gritted teeth strained; his jaw tightening as he drew short breath after short breath through his nostrils in a rising crescendo of pure, animal lust!<br /><br />

The lion roared.<br /><br />

The pent-up air, lust and frustration from all those years of denial suddenly erupted in a sound that startled the young lion.  He could feel the thick, gooey wetness on his hands and belly as he roared with all his might in the throes of ecstasy...<br /><br />

Around the building, people stopped in their tracks, listening to the sound with startled expressions and wondering looks to each other.  Even beyond the bounds of the dorm, passers by paused, listening in the night air to the sound of a lion in heat.<br /><br />

Soon, the feelings faded.  Sid lay, spent, panting on his bed and feeling his throbbing erection still sticky in his palm.  His belly had deflated, along with the rest of him, until he was back to his normal, massively muscled, tall form.  The lion's muzzle spread into a smile as he groaned, basking in the afterglow...<br /><br />

But...<br /><br />

Groaning at his massive outburst, the lion looked puzzled, then, and stared down at himself.<br /><br />

His erection hadn't gone down.<br /><br />

In fact, even though his fur was matted with the most cum he'd ever produced in a masturbation session, his lusts hadn't died down.  In fact, as his sticky paw pulled away from his cock, he felt like it was time to start again...<br /><br />

Sid gulped nervously and looked towards the door of his room, knowing that the others had probably heard him just now.  Still, he couldn't deny his desires...<br /><br />

Perhaps, this next time, he'd be more quiet.<br /><br />

With that, the huge lion licked his paw clean and -then- grabbed his rock-hard erection and began stroking it, again...

<hr />

Tyler walked up to Chris and put a hand on the rabbit's hip, just above his head's height.  He looked up at the towering rabbit and sighed, shaking his head.  "I ... I guess I didn't know that you two..."<br /><br />

"Only...only for a couple months, now..." sobbed Chris, looked down at the tiny man, shyly.  "Just after ... after you and I..."<br /><br />

Tyler nodded.  He, like a lot of gay guys in college, liked playing the field.  Chris and he had hooked up a few times and -honestly- he'd really enjoyed it.  Chris was athletic, slender and -quite frankly- well-hung.  But...<br /><br />

Well, it just hadn't worked for him, long-term, and Chris...  Well, Chris wanted something more permanent.  Sure, he liked one-night stands as much as the next guy, but there was just something in his personality more similar to Sid:  he wanted a relationship, not a casual fuck.<br /><br />

"Look, hon, you ...uh... you realize that I ... I don't really love you..."<br /><br />

Chris, regaining his composure, nodded through his fading tears.  "I kinda figured it was something the game did to you.  That you love the one you hate.  And you don't hate me any ... anymore..."<br /><br />

Tyler shrugged and nodded.  "I guess not..."<br /><br />

Chris sighed.  "That...that's Ok..." he said, his voice still strained.  Turning Sid's chair around, he sat and felt his short, tuft of rabbit-tail brush against the rungs of the chair.  He adjusted the waistband of his pants by pulling them down and giving his tail more breathing room.<br /><br />

"It's just that ... I'd hoped there was something between Dave an' me..."<br /><br />

Tyler nodded and leaned up against one of the table's legs, looking up at the huge man, concerned.  Something about being this small was somehow ...comforting.  It was almost as if, with his loss of physical power, he was enjoying a more intimate role in his relations with his friends.  Maybe with a small size came a more philosophical outlook...<br /><br />

<i>Or maybe,</i> he mused darkly, <i>I'm just so easily breakable at this size, I don't dare piss anyone off...</i><br /><br />

"I think part of it is that he's a demon, now," said Tyler, patting Chris' leg.  "I mean, that's got to be part of it; I wouldn't worry if I were you...  Not too much, at any rate."<br /><br />

Chris looked down at Tyler and stifled a chuckle.  The small man looked up, confused.<br /><br />

"Pardon me?"<br /><br />

Chris wiped the last tears from his face and smiled down at Tyler.  "Sorry; it's just that -well- your voice sounds kinda funny like this...  Like an old cartoon where ... where the character shrinks but his voice gets higher?"<br /><br />

Tyler grimaced and rolled his eyes.  "Yeah, I noticed.  I think it's because my vocal chords are shorter and the diameter of my larynx is smaller..."<br /><br />

"Who knew that Warner Brothers would've gotten it right about shrinking?"<br /><br />

Tyler snorted while the rabbit stood up and looked down at the tiny man.  "So, what now?"<br /><br />

Tyler sighed.  "Now?  God, I don't know..."<br /><br />

"You think Dave'll come back?"<br /><br />

Both men looked at the door, listening to the sounds of their classmates partying, outside.<br /><br />

"The demon?  Hard to say, but I'd guess, yeah...  He'll be back.  Depressed and cursed aside, we're his friends.  He'll need to turn to us sooner or later."<br /><br />

Chris looked down at Tyler again and a slow smile spread over his face.  "So," he said slowly, "I seem to remember that you had a pretty good submissive streak for such a straight-acting, big buff man, before...  What say we take advantage of that, little fellah?"<br /><br />

Tyler blinked and looked up at Chris, startled.  "Hunh?"<br /><br />

The rabbit nodded towards the other bedroom.  "Well, with Dave out for a walk by the lake and Sid jerking off in the next room, well, why don't we have a little fun ourselves?"<br /><br />

Tyler looked stunned.<br /><br />

Chris was fit and generally his type, true, but -well- he was a rabbit, now...<br /><br />

"Uh, I dunno..." he said, slowly, looking up at the towering man, nervously.  "I mean, there's no guarantee that ...uh... that you'll even <i>fit</i>..."<br /><br />

"I thought you liked your men on the big-side," he said, kneeling forward and balancing on the huge toes of his lapine feet.  Reaching out, the rabbit tousled Tyler's hair as if the smaller man were a child.  "Come on, I can promise you I'm still my normal eight inches under all this fur..."  He chuckled.  "And to you, even bigger..."<br /><br />

A sudden, catastrophic roar filled the air, trembling outwards from Sid's bedroom.  Both men jumped and stared towards the closed door with wide eyes.  The loud, lustful sound gradually faded and both Chris and Tyler stared at each other for several moments in silence.<br /><br />

Tyler looked up at the rabbit and shyly grinned.  "Why not?" he said, at last.  "I've never really been under someone's thumb before; not like this, at any rate..."<br /><br />

Chris reached down and -gently- picked up his small friend.<br /><br />

"Hey!"<br /><br />

"Oh, shush, little man," admonished the rabbit, walking towards Dave's unused bedroom.  "Let me enjoy the moment and treat you like the toy you are..."<br /><br />

Tyler had to hide a grin as he felt a thrill rush through his body at the larger man's words.

<hr />

People had stared.<br /><br />

Throughout the dorm, people had stared at him.  Dead people.  Desiccated corpses laughing, talking, carousing, partying and studying ... all of them had stopped and stared at the Incubus as he walked amongst them and out into the nighttime air of downtown Milwaukee.<br /><br />

There were a few people walking on the streets at this hour, nearly 10pm, but -luckily- most of them were too involved with each other and not paying attention to the towering man with the glossy black horns.<br /><br />

Making his way along the more darkly lit streets towards Lake Michigan, the Incubus pondered his fate.<br /><br />

All around him, trees, houses, cars and -yes- even animals, all appeared as they would in their moments of death.  It was like walking through an open grave.<br /><br />

"It's not bad enough I don't have a Name," he muttered darkly, "but why does everything around me have to die?"<br /><br />

Slowly, over about a quarter of an hour, the massive demon made his way down to the waterfront and the park that lay strung out along the shoreline.  There were very few trees here and the area was well-lit with walkway lamps and lights from the nearby avenues.  Keeping to himself was getting to be a problem.<br /><br />

A few couples went past him and he could feel their eyes upon him...  Just about every female wanted him, he could tell, and about ten percent of the guys.  Too bad he just didn't feel anything in return.  It didn't stop his want, either.<br /><br />

The most startling thing, he realized, was that he was starting to desire the women, too.  Perhaps the experience of being a sex demon was influencing his sexuality, after all, his biology had clearly changed ... perhaps he was now bisexual as well as a Nameless Devourer of Souls.<br /><br />

Walking up to the shore, the demon looked out at the choppy waters and watched as they boiled and steamed in their last moments.  <i>Some awesome catastrophe, no doubt,</i> he thought looking at the steaming waves.  <i>I wonder what'll cause it?</i>  Dead fish bobbed and washed about in the choppy surf and the demon looked away.<br /><br />

There, however, on the horizon, rose the full moon, lighting the area even more.  Deciding to get away from the prying eyes of those on the bike and walking paths, the Incubus extended his wings slightly around his shoulders, partially covering his features, and made his way onto to pier that led out into the lake.<br /><br />

It looked cracked and broken to his eyes, but his feet found easy purchase and it didn't collapse.  A single couple was out necking at the far end of the dock and he felt a twang of jealousy for these Named mortals.  Even though -to his eyes- they looked like writhing corpses, having risen from their graves to try in vain to copulate with their spent bodies, he envied them.  They had names ... emotions ... real depths.<br /><br />

Not really paying too much attention to the new visitor, the couple nodded absently in his direction and -desiring more time alone- slowly made their way back to shore.  The Incubus was alone on the end of the pier.<br /><br />

Looking out over the doomed and dying lake, he fixed his glowing, Lavender eyes on the moon.  For a moment, he just stared at it, pondering his own fate and how easy it would just be to jump into those choppy, fetid waters and let them close over his head, taking away breath, life and the curse.<br /><br />

<i>To sleep ... perchance to dream...</i><br /><br />

Slowly, it dawned on him.  The moon.  It was still there.  It wasn't cracked or destroyed.  It wasn't withered, blasted or mangled like everything else he saw.  Instead, when he squinted enough, he could see nothing unusual about its surface or features.<br /><br />

In fact, as he looked closer, he thought he could see something.  There, across the blasted waste of Lake Michigan, he thought he could see ... a face.  A woman's face...<br /><br />

Somber, sober and beautiful, it was unlike anything he'd ever seen before.  There, just barely visible in the contours and features on the moon.<br /><br />

"God, I'm hallucinating, now..." he muttered, rubbing his eyes.<br /><br />

He looked again, but it was still there.  Not obviously, no; but faintly...  There wasn't a man in the moon ... it was a woman.  And -for whatever reason- neither she nor the moon itself were decaying.<br /><br />

"So, what, you're eternal?" he asked aloud, in a half-whisper.<br /><br />

There was no answer, of course, nor did he really expect one.  As he gazed upon her, staring out over the water, he felt a form of calm come over him.  It was strange, but that fixed gaze, barely outlined in the features of the moon, was comforting ... almost as if it was making up for the fact that he had lost so much and gained such atrocious powers.<br /><br />

Gradually, the tenseness in his shoulders began to ease and his wings folded softly against his back.  A heavy sigh escaped his mouth and he hung his head, feeling relieved.<br /><br />

It was a mistake.<br /><br />

His eyes locked on his own reflection in the water and opened, wide, in stunned shock.<br /><br />

He wasn't decayed, destroyed or maimed, either.  No, he saw himself as he would be in the end ...at the very end... and he was still a demon.  He was an Incubus but still young, perfect and very much alive.  There, in that reflection, was suddenly the horrible realization that this might go on, forever...<br /><br />

...Like the moon...<br /><br />

Throwing his head back, the demon howled in inhuman fury and passer's by looked out at the end of the pier and shuddered at the sound of that cry...</p>
