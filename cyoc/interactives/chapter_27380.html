<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Haunted House, the roller-coaster, and even the fountain had all seemed fairly normal. They had left the trio changed as never before, but the actual experience of the rides had been no different than those of any theme park. &quot;We Smack You with a Bottle&quot;, however, was like nothing any of them had ever experienced.<br />
<br />
   The thing was, the ride's name explained it's experience in full. &quot;We Smack You with a Bottle&quot; was dedicated, all pitch-black six minutes of it, to random strenuous physical abuse delivered with bottle-smacks. The moment the formerly young and multi-gendered trio entered the blackness of the ride interior, Jean was smacked in the kidney, Tanya in the forehead, and Ashley in the breasts. The older pair were the more vulnerable, and almost collapsed despite the fact that so far the bottle were only hard plastic. Ashley was much stronger, but the sting of the bottle spiked deep into her new (or old, depending on your viewpoint) breasts. None of them had time to reflect on any of this, however, because less than a second after the first bottle-strike came a second, in a different place.<br />
<br />
   And a third. And fourth. And so on, and as the yelps of surprise rose into screams of pain, the bottles gradually increased in hardness. Around halfway through they were made of glass (which never broke). As the high-pitched shrieks of agony crumbed into moans of despair, the glass became stone, then steel. None of them was dead, but they all - even Ashley - came close as the steel bottle-strikes suddenly shifted into a higher gear, smacking faster and harder than ever before. Just as their minds were about to snap, they emerged (without any sense of motion; they had felt throughout as if they had been standing still) from the darkness into the blinding sunlight of the park once more. Tanya and Jean, blinked, then looked around them - and realized that they weren't old anymore. They looked like their original 12. What was more, they were boys again!<br />
<br />
   &quot;We're young!&quot; shouted Tom.<br />
<br />
   &quot;We're BOYS!&quot; shouted Josh.<br />
<br />
   &quot;ALL RIGHT!!&quot; they shouted in unison, then hugged each-other and jumped up and down just like little girls. They were boys, however, no doubt about that; after a few moments they realized what they were doing, and let go with awkward haste.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Yeah, it's cool.&quot; said Tom. He was failing to sound nonchalant.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Cool.&quot; said Josh. &quot;Hey, Ashley, check-&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;I know.&quot; said Ashley, staring at her two friends (what else could she call them now? Supernatural torture tends to form bonds), 12-year-old boys dressed in tattered, wet clothes and not seeming to care. She thought that if all boys could look as happy and innocent as they, the world would be . . . well, it would be a lot more fun. It was an unusually mature thought for her, but then again, she was older now. Except, if Tom and Josh had been made younger, then -<br />
<br />
   Ashley looked down at herself and stopped in mid-thought.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Hey, what's everybody - &quot; said Josh, and then saw for himself.<br />
<br />
   What they were all looking at (Ashley with her head tilted down) was Ashley's body. It had not become younger, like Tanya/Tom's and Jean/Josh's. But nor had it become older. She had been, she guessed, thirty years old; now she might be around 27 - though the other features certainly complicated things. Her clothes were also still the same - which really only accentuated things. For now, the shirt and bra which had just barely contained her bust had finally failed in their task, spilling her boobs into the open sunshine - and what boobs they were! Firm, smooth, with nipples like rosebuds! They seemed to defy gravity, and they were the size of BASKETBALLS!!!<br />
<br />
   Nor was that it. Her hips had widened out too (what her grandma would have undoubtedly called 'child-bearing hips), and her pants had shredded at the seams. They had fallen off completely in the rear, and were held on in front only because they were wet. Even so, they revealed everything beneath, and had the two boys cared to look in that direction (they did not; did not even stand a chance of doing so) they would have had quite a show.<br />
<br />
   Her skin, now flawless, had deepened to that bronze-olive color of women whose very glow makes men salivate. Her hair had grown a good seven feet, and fell from her head like a silky, weightless black waterfall to pool around her feet. Here eyes tilted up very slightly at the corners, and had her two male companions drowning in their shining green depths.<br />
<br />
   &quot;oh my god . . . &quot; Tom croaked out. The two boys could do nothing but stare. Meanwhile, Ashley was doing much the same.</p>
