<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Myles, the six-foot womanizer and pretty-boy, looked radically different. The grey sweatpants he&#39;d worn throughout the night left nothing at all to the imagination any longer, as the seams were visibly stretched by his legs and ass. &quot;God damn,&quot; one of the twins said. &quot;Myles, I don&#39;t remember you packing that much in your front?&quot; Myles looked curiously downwards, at what Gavin had looked at throughout the session - the thick thighs were pushing out a package of prodigious size, with an obvious outline of a very soft, very thick manhood snaking its way down his thigh. Myles, however, didn&#39;t seem too fixated on that area.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not seeing this?! I&#39;m fucking huge!&quot; He lifted his newly brawny arms as if to illustrate a point. &quot;Jesus Christ, bro,&quot; Phil muttered and got up close, reaching out with his hand towards the heavy pecs and looking at Myles, who allowed it with a nod. Phil cupped both of them, or rather, he tried to. He also looked slightly up at Myles now. &quot;You taller?&quot; Myles blinked and realized it himself &quot;Yeah, maybe. You were like an inch taller than me, and now I&#39;m like half a head taller than you. Nice,&quot; he added with a smile. &quot;That&#39;s not all that&#39;s nice,&quot; Gavin thought to himself and observed Myles&#39; dumptruck ass stretch the sweatpants to their limit.<br />
<br />
<br />
As Myles had gotten over the shock, he&#39;d calmed down enough to fall pensive. While the others argued whether they should try all of the pills themselves (which no one wanted, apparently, Myles thought it was weird that they didn&#39;t want this level of brawn), he went to the bathroom and locked the door. At first he&#39;d been uncomfortable in this new body of his. Looking in the full-scale mirror, he saw how he was a lot different than others, but he also saw himself in his bulky glory. <br />
<br />
Before, he&#39;d been slender, an athetic boy of 170lbs, mostly muscle. He&#39;d enjoyed fucking the two girlfriends he currently were keeping secret at his leisure, and he&#39;d thought it was funny to queer-bait those of his friends which were obviously gay - like Gavin. The poor guy had to know, surely. Myles had taken advantage of his soccer career and his natural good genes to sculpt an aesthetically pleasing body, with a six-pack to die for, and an ass that made the girls turn when he walked past them. It wasn&#39;t just his abs that got the ladies, though - although Phil had a big-ass schlong, he&#39;d told Myles years ago that he was an extreme shower - his eight inches got to eight and a half, and an eight and a half slender ones, too. In addition, Phil was embarrassed by his balls, feeling they were too small compared to his dick. Myles knew that was because of those times they&#39;d gone skinny-dipping, and Phil had caught his fair share of glimpses of Myles&#39; junk. <br />
<br />
Myles already had quite the equipment, with almost eight, thick inches and two balls the size of chicken&#39;s eggs. Now that he pulled down his pants and underwear, he inspected the smooth shaven junk anew. &quot;Holy fuck,&quot; he murmured under his breath. Lifting his cock, he could tell this had to be at least twice its former size, and just the thought of it made him chub up slightly. He reached under, cupping his balls, the pouch overflowing his hand. Each of his testes had to be comparable to a small apple. Looking in the mirror, he noticed that he hadn&#39;t gotten any hairier. Just as good, he thought, wouldn&#39;t want his girls to think that he was some older guy. Instead of that characteristic bear look, he was smooth and bulging - yeah, he had a solid layer of padding, and a generous spare tyre around his waist, but in a sense, it suited him - his pecs were so big that they still protruded over his belly, and the round, powerful shoulders allowed him to carry the fat more maturely. His hair was as lush as ever, and his quads and calves, already his strongest parts from his years of soccer playing, had swollen enough that he didn&#39;t look just fat - he looked bulky. He looked powerful. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Lord,&quot; he whispered gleefully - flexing and admiring himself in the mirror, he&#39;d upset the beast. Curving lightly upwards, throbbing harder, longer and fatter, his cock couldn&#39;t be ignored. &quot;God, I&#39;m huge,&quot; he moaned, imagining mounting his FWB Lexie with this monster. He could probably lift up and use her as a fucktoy, couldn&#39;t he? Yeah, he probably could. Groaning and panting, he had to use both his hands to work his way around the shaft. Noticing a tape measure in Gavin&#39;s mom&#39;s knitting stuff, he pulled it out and placed it on top of his pulsating cock. &quot;Eleven and a halv long,&quot; he grunted, &quot;nine around, God, I&#39;m the biggest fucking-&quot; he interrupted himself with guttural moans, as he imagined the threesomes he&#39;d have with this much mass and this much testosterone, and came powerfully, onto the wall, into Gavin&#39;s mom&#39;s knitting basket, in the bathtub and on the mirror. He continued rubbing out until only a trickle came out, his cock still standing at attention. He&#39;d always had the sexual stamina of a horse, now he had a donkey&#39;s cock and a bull&#39;s balls, too.<br />
<br />
Turning around, he saw that he hadn&#39;t locked the door after all. Standing in the doorway were the twins, their bodies growing taller by the second, jerking off their cocks, stretching longer by the second, Phil, swelling up like Myles had done, Samuel, his body losing fat and adding muscle and cock, and Gavin, only jerking off naked, looking at Myles with a worshiping look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, guys, I&#39;m not gonna. I&#39;m-&quot; Myles was interrupted by Gavin, who held out his free hand towards him. &quot;-what if you get this?&quot; In his hand was a similar dose to what Myles had swallowed earlier. Myles felt that he still wasn&#39;t all done growing from the first dosage - he saw his cock stretching its way out past the foot-long mark, for instance - but without a moments&#39; hesitation, he grabbed the pills and chucked them into his mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, pussyboys. Who wants the first ride?&quot;</p>
