<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex walked into his science classroom where his science teacher, Ms. Areth, was sitting, her desk was twice the size of the pupils’ and she needed it for her expanded assets. Alex and his class were in their 4th year at Hutriurm High School, it had been nearly two months since a student in the year above ‘expanded’ it apparently happened to a guy who was in a History lesson. There were around 30 to 40 students in each class, in the highest year was 1 away from where Alex was. Enhanced Puberty usually spiked in students around this that year and in Alex’s school, 19 pupils out of the 37 that there were had experienced it. But it still wasn’t unheard of in lower years. The lowest recorded was two years below Alex when a 13 year old girl suddenly ‘bloomed’ unexpectedly. Students are (in most schools) only taught about Enhanced Puberty when they’re 14. The 13 year old was in Japan around 8 years ago.<br />
<br />
They all sat down, Alex sat with Suzy as he usually did and listened to his teacher while also admiring her large assets, two seats in front of him was Bob. Bob was the nicest person but Alex seemed to get along well with him but usually didn’t hang out with him. On the left of Alex (Suzy was on his right) was Indigo, he’d spoken to her maybe 6 or seven times but never had a full on conversation with her.<br />
<br />
Nearly half an hour into the lesson. Alex was talking to Suzy about a task that had been set and they had only half completed it in the 5 minutes they had had for it. New to Alex, Indigo tapped his shoulder, Alex turned to her. Indigo was a 5 foot 4 girl who had a small frame, an A cup chest, small butt, and pretty much small in all areas apart from her hair, her hair went all the way down to her butt and was a black-ish colour, more of a very dark brown. Indigo looked at him weakly and said, “Excuse me, I feel kinda ill, what should I do??”<br />
“Uhm, why are you asking me, I have no clue what to-“<br />
“Sorry about him,” said Suzy interrupting me, “What’s the problem??”<br />
“I feel kinda out of it, and tired even though I felt absolutely fine about 2 minutes ago,”<br />
“Oh so you suddenly feel ill, well we can tell Ms. Are..” Suzy stopped and looked somewhat surprised at something.<br />
Alex looked to where her eyes were going and they were pointed at Indigo’s chest. Alex only glanced at them for a brief moment to try and not be rude but noticed that they looked somewhat bigger, he looked again and he defiantly noticed it. “What’s wrong??” Asked Indigo,<br />
“Uhm.. look down a bit..” said Suzy,<br />
“Oh my god!!” Said Indigo somewhat quiet, only a few heard, “I’m getting bigger!!”<br />
<br />
Still on her stool, Indigo looked down and saw two unfamiliar lumps expand on her chest. They grew to a D cup before anyone else noticed, they pushed tightly against her top, which was meant for an A cup chest. She looked back at Suzy in horror and saw a bunch of black branches grow from behind her into her vision. She turned back to look but they didn’t move. She realised these were her eyelashes growing longer. She tried to breathe in but had trouble because her lips blocked it unnaturally, they grew bigger and bigger until being as big as her thumb nearly doubled. She looked and saw her chest had nearly doubled since she last looked being H cups now and still growing, to an I cup. Her butt pushed against the stool she was on, it grew bigger and bigger as seeped over the sides of the stool. Her hips grew wider and as wide as her shoulders and a bit more, her thighs even grew bigger too. By this point the entire class was looking, she really couldn’t hide any of it. Her hair grew longer until it touched the floor. Her chest grew to the size of her head and then the size of Alex’s head (which was quite a lot larger than hers). Her butt grew to match her chest and slid off both the sides and the back of her stool, her hips had grown nearly twice the size of her shoulders and her thighs were twice the size they were before. The last thing that changed was her waist, her waist pulled in and became as thin as her neck was doubled. She was nearly off her chair, breathing heavily when Ms. Areth ran over.<br />
<br />
She lifted Indigo up and said to her, “Well, congratulations on being the first to ‘Enhance’ out of your class, you’re around the right age and time but granted you are early. I know this can and has been awkward but, and I’m talking to the whole class now. You’ll all experience this, so making fun of her would only really show signs of jealousy.” She looked at Indigo and smiled, “I’ll go get you a seat and that will be the end of it,”<br />
“Bwut I’ve aweady got a seawt,” Indigo tried to say with her new, bigger lips,<br />
“You’ll get used to that part,” referencing her lips, as she grabbed a larger stool from the cupboard for Indigo to sit on. She placed it in her seating place and then removed her previous stool. Indigo sat down and was more comfortable but still hated that nearly everyones eyes were on her.<br />
<br />
At the end of the lesson, Indigo was told to stay behind. She was given some new fitting clothes and was sent home early.<br />
<br />
“Wow, that was interesting,” said Suzy,<br />
“Yeah, Jesus Christ that was weird, especially for her,” said Alex,<br />
“I bet you can’t wait for me to be ‘Enhanced’.. “ said Suzy, jokingly seductively,<br />
“Yeah, well I bet you can’t wait for me to either,” said Alex, trying to hide that he actually couldn’t wait for that,<br />
“Yeah you’re right,” this surprised Alex as he didn’t expect a direct response, “I’m probably quite a bit more exited than you are for me to do it,”<br />
“Hah, well I’m going to walk home, wanna come??”<br />
“Yeah sure, my Mom might not be home yet so you come round mine for a bit,”<br />
“I’ll think about it on the way.”</p>
