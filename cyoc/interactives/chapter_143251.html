<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Candace bit her lip as she now looked at the path she was on. The fork that would change her path was just ahead, after all it had been the summer before her freshaman year. That decision though was a big one. Yes she had many regrets in her life. She hung out with the wrong crowd, she regretted not following her best friend at the time Amanda to Girl Scouts when they were seven and grew apart, this though was the biggest.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” she whispered. “Think Candace think. You could end this now, start high school all over again. Who would know you lost your virginity?” Candace stared down the path knowing the answer. She would know, it would haunt her. Candace wished she could just reclaim her virginity without walking any further, she was young enough as is. Did she really want to become younger?<br />
<br />
“Screw it it’s only a couple of months,” she sighed. Taking a deep breath Candace took the few steps towards the fork, realizing she was now younger once more, now a couple months shy of attending high school. As she reached the fork she could see the path branch off once more. On the left she could see the towel her and Danny had layers on that fateful night. To the right she saw a book, a romance book. Picking the book up she gave a small laugh. Before she had started dating Danny she had been obsessed with some trashy Romance novel. She distinctly remembered that the night she lost her virginity she was preparing to dive back into the book. That is before Danny called. After losing her virginity and living with that decision she always wondered what things would have been like if she had ignored the call and kept reading.<br />
<br />
“Easy enough choice,” the 14 year old smirked as she picked up the book. Turning away from the blanket Candace took a few steps forward, knowing she was inching back towards that fateful moment. “How far do I have to go,” Candace wondered out loud. After only taking a few steps she got her answer as a sharp pain now ran through her body.<br />
<br />
Candace doubled over as the pain of losing her virginity returned. The girls eyes went wide as she realized what was happening. She could feel her hymen reform as her virginity was restored once more. Bracing herself against the wall the young teens eyes went wide as she realized what happened. She was truely just a girl once again. The last remnant of her adulthood had vanished into the ether. The world was her oyster, her future was looking bright. The plain ordinary life she so despised was now just a bad memory. Candace had spiced her life up significantly and changed things for the better. Knowing this knowledge Candace now stood catching her breath and smiling. “I did it,” she said, a small grin spreading across her face. “I got rid of my biggest regret.”<br />
<br />
Happily she now laughed, the sound was girlish and happy as she twirled around. Thinking about all she wanted to do was tell her friends. It was at this moment she realized something,. Did she really want to see them? <br />
<br />
Candace now thought of the kids she had grown up with. She had been a bit of a tomboy as a kid, mostly running with guys and tough girls who would get in trouble all the time in and out of school. The trouble they got into was nothing serious, stupid kid stuff that would cause no lasting damage but gave them a reputation as bad kids. Candace recalled she was the girl growing up that didn’t go to sleepovers or birthday parties. She had been a tough rebellious kid that never really had any close girlfriends. The only one she could even consider a friend was a girl she had been close with from preschool to age seven Amanda.<br />
<br />
When she and Amanda were in first grade Candace recalled how Amanda had wanted to join the Girl Scouts. Candace at the time thought the idea was stupid and said as much to Amanda. This resulted in the two girls getting into a fight. The fight had been stupid, mostly the girls yelling at one another. The result though was that the girls went their separate ways. Amanda joined the Girl Scouts, Candace didn’t. Years later Candace would see thanAmanda would go on to a successful career and what appeared to be a fulfilling life. At the ten year reunion Candace learned that Amanda (who had gone to the private school she was now attending) had kept in touch with some of the people she had gone to high school with. She hadn’t married but it sounded as if she was happy. Candace felt regrets, wondering what it would of been like if the two had remained friends.<br />
<br />
“Ugh,” the 14 year old sighed. “Cmon do you really want to do that Candi. Look at yourself. Your freaking 14 again. Your talking about going back to first grade, becoming a 7 year old kid again and hoping that maybe, just maybe you can get back together with your childhood best friend?” That sounds crazy.”<br />
<br />
Candace now glanced around the hall of mirrors as she thought over her decision. Did she really want to eliminate this last regret?</p>
