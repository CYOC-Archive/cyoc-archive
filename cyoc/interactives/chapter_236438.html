<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake went to his first hour class, Biology. Everyone had to take it so it was kept pretty easy.  The teacher, Ms. Burke usually just put a movie on.  <br />
<br />
Jake sat to the back. Everyone filed in and on que a documentary on cells was started.  Jake used the time to check out what his male classmates had between their legs.  <br />
<br />
First he checked out:<br />
<br />
Name: Kenny James<br />
Length: 2.5” soft and 5” erect<br />
girth: marker <br />
Testicles: egg size <br />
<br />
Kenny was a nice guy if not dumb.  He was a skateboarder and he was fond of pot.  Jake added 4 inches to his soft and erect length.  <br />
<br />
Kenny felt his penis tingle, it felt good.  He reached into his pocket and felt it, it felt like it was longer, much longer.  He was going to have to go to the bathroom and look. He asked for a pass and left.  <br />
<br />
Next there was:<br />
<br />
Name: Niall Tusk<br />
Length: 6” soft and 9” erect<br />
girth: soup can<br />
Testicles: orange sized<br />
<br />
Wow Niall is packing.  Jake thought about it and decided to take some away.  It’s not that Niall is a bad person but he doesn’t deserve it.  He was so confident and even arrogant.  This would knock him down a bit.  Jake reduced the penis by half.  Niall felt the jolt and he knew something was off.  He didn’t know what yet. Then there was:<br />
<br />
Name: Dante Coleman<br />
Length: 7” soft and 11” erect<br />
girth: soda can<br />
Testicles: eggs <br />
<br />
And<br />
<br />
Name: Jeff Studd<br />
Length: 7” soft and 12” erect<br />
girth: soda can<br />
Testicles: eggs <br />
<br />
Dante was on the football team and like the other jocks thought he was the most important person in the school.  Jeff was his best friend who was star player on the baseball team.  They had both been mean to him in the past.  He was vicious:<br />
<br />
Name: Dante Coleman<br />
Length: 2” soft and 2” erect<br />
girth: soda can<br />
Testicles: eggs <br />
<br />
Name: Jeff Studd<br />
Length: 1” soft and 2” erect<br />
girth: pencil<br />
Testicles: eggs <br />
<br />
Dante would look ridiculous with a short girthy penis on his large athletic body.  The change happened at the push of the button. Over to the left was:<br />
<br />
Name: Henry Janks <br />
Length: 6” soft and 8.75” erect<br />
girth: soda can<br />
Testicles: eggs <br />
<br />
Henry was new to the school having moved from New York.  As a welcome present Jake added some inches:<br />
<br />
Name: Henry Janks <br />
Length: 8” soft and 12.75” erect<br />
girth: soda can<br />
Testicles: eggs<br />
<br />
That would make him a real stud.  Two left:  <br />
<br />
Name: Eric Wert<br />
Length: 4” soft and 6” erect<br />
girth: sharpie marker<br />
Testicles: eggs<br />
<br />
And <br />
<br />
Name: Wilson Banks<br />
Length: 2” soft and 3.5” erect<br />
girth: pencil <br />
Testicles: eggs<br />
<br />
Eric and Wilson were friends. They mostly stuck to themselves and with their other friends.  Jake decided to make Eric the same size as Wilson and shrunk his penis down.  <br />
<br />
Kenny returned with a huge smile and an obvious boner.  Dante saw it and reflexively rested his hand on his own crotch only he didn’t feel anything.  Dante began to feel around his pants trying to locate his big penis.  He panicked and stood up and pulled down his pants and boxers revealing his lower half.  Everyone was shocked.  “Where’s my dick?” Yelled Dante.  <br />
<br />
Ms Burke was not prepared for this “Dante! Put your pants on” she commanded.  Dante ignored her “what about yours?” He asked Jeff. They had seen each other naked lots of times.  Jeff got up and peaked in his pants but Dante grabbed them and took them down.  Jeff’s even smaller penis was out on display.  Jeff was in shock and speechless.  Dante was moving to other boys.  <br />
<br />
Dante grabbed Niall and Jeff went to help expose the boys genitals.  They were small but bigger than the jocks.  Niall was alarmed though, he had lost half of his cock.  He explained to them that he shrunk to and all three were on to grab Henry as Ms Burke was yelling at them and the girls in the room were laughing and filming.  <br />
<br />
They grabbed Henry and pulled off his clothes.  His new improved cock was now out for the world to see.  Dante grabbed it and pulled to see if it was fake.  Henry was not sure what happened but he was playing it cool “it’s all me little boy” he said.  “Why is yours still normal” Jeff asked not really to anyone.  <br />
<br />
Kenny saw them look at him and he pulled his own shorts down “you can see it if you want” he said.  Ms Burke had left the room to get help.  <br />
<br />
Jake pulled up his profile to see if 24 hours had passed. It had and be made changes:<br />
<br />
Length: 8” soft and 12” erect<br />
girth: soda can<br />
Testicles: eggs <br />
<br />
He felt the change as the boys got to him and pulled him out of his chair to take his pants off and expose him.  Jakes massive cock was out. Dante again grabbed it and tried to pull it off.  “Oww” Jake said “that’s mine”.  Several girls were taking pictures of the entire scene.  <br />
<br />
They moved to Wilson and Eric who were also very small. Though only one had lost inches.  <br />
<br />
Just then the football coach stormed in with Ms Burke and began to yell “what the hell is going on here and what is wrong with you? Put your damn clothes back on.”  The boys all put their pants on and the show was over.  However the pictures were being sent around the school.</p>
