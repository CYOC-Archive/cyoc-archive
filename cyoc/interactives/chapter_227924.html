<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chloe found that she wasn&#39;t finished with Imogen. <br />
<br />
She exposed a bloated breast and popped the nipple into her mouth before Imogen could say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; she moaned, arching her head back.<br />
<br />
Chloe started biting and sucking at the nipple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chloe - ah god - stop please - someone might - Jesus - see us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chloe felt past the girdle, past the wet panties and slipped her longest finger in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh! Christ!&quot; Imogen wailed.<br />
<br />
Her hips were grinding against Chloe&#39;s finger as if were Charlie&#39;s cock. Imogen was lost, the rapid pregnancy, the futa who had fucked her and now this. Her orgasm scrambled her brain, she couldn&#39;t tell you what 2 + 2 equaled, her breathing was rapid and shallow. Her face was a classic O face, mouth wide open, eyes unfocused and her head tilted back. Only when the nail of Chloe&#39;s finger caused her pain did a flicker of something come across Imogen&#39;s face. <br />
<br />
Chloe drank and soon her body was awash with nano-bots. That were hijacking her brain and her body. Her tits swelled, her sports bra was being pushed forward with each gulp of milk as her own glands expanded. A button flew off of her uniform shirt, then a second and then more until her shirt split open showing her breasts pushing her bra to straining point. She now had tits that were at least D cups on her chest. She felt other parts of her body expand as she took on a fuller figure. Her legs grew longer and she gained about a foot and a half in height. Her skirt rode up showing her panties. <br />
<br />
Her ass had swollen so much that her panties barley covered her ass, it looked like an oversized thong. Each of her ass cheeks had swollen past it, making the fabric ride up into the crack of her ass. It might be acceptable at the beach but at a Christian school. No. Fucking. Way. Having drained Imogen dry she slowly stood up, like a new born deer. She stumbled as her new boobies and legs took her off balance. But soon she gained control of her body. She looked like she should be working at Hooters. Her hair only needed to be dyed blonde and she would be the perfect busty, air headed bimbo.<br />
<br />
Across town Imogen&#39;s pregnancy and Chloe&#39;s bimboication took place, the other nano-bot&#39;s picked up on the changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help! Girls, I need your help!&quot; Marfa shouted as she barged through the front door and into the flat. She had moved out of the house with Moon and her transsexual benefactor. Viola heard her stumbling around and bumping into things as she hurried into the building. Wandering out of the kitchen, she saw Marfa looking flustered. She was breathing heavily, like she had just been for a run, and she was cradling something under her large coat. “What’s wrong?” asked Viola, frowning and tucking her long brown hair behind her ears as she tried to understand what she was seeing.  “Well... I was at the hospital today, as you know, when a heavily pregnant woman came in. She had already gone into labor and was screaming and shouting about not being ready. This is something I’ve heard a lot, from first time mothers, but this seemed different. The woman looked especially pregnant too, as if she were carrying triplets...” Marfa trailed off and grimaced, grabbing the item under her coat tightly. Then, she continued.<br />
<br />
“Anyway, as I went to help this woman, her boobs started to lactate heavily. By the time we got her to a room, she was spraying a whole lot of milk. I had it all over my arms. Her belly seemed bigger too, which was weird. She started shouting about how she shouldn’t be this big, or how she wasn’t even pregnant this morning. As I left, the sounds coming from the room didn’t sound good...”Marfa said. She leaned on the banister and tried to catch her breath. Then, she looked up the stairs as their other flatmate, Uma, came out of her room to see what was going on. She was older than them both by a few years. They had put an add online for another flatmate and she had answered the add with cash.. They usually kept relatively quiet for students, so Marfa’s sudden and loud outburst was quite the exception to their normal Thursday afternoon. “Tell me, let me help!” Viola said, stepping out of the kitchen and slowly approaching her friend. She felt her heart starting to bear faster and faster. This wasn’t like Marfa; she was usually so calm and quiet. Marfa, looking between both of her flatmates, quickly started explaining her situation as she saw the concern on their faces. “Well... the pregnancy something is happening, making the baby come faster” Marfa trailed off and grimaced, grabbing the item under her coat tightly. “Oh my god,” said Uma, still at the top of the stairs. The frame of her short, skinny body was visible even from where Viola was standing. “That sounds crazy, are you alright?” asked Viola. She leaned on the wall opposite Marfa and watched her cautiously. The girl was sweating, and trembled ever so slightly. “I- I don’t think so. That’s when things got really weird,” Marfa said, looking at Viola. “The whole way home, things started to happen to me. It was barely noticeable at first but there was no mistaking what is happening after a while. Umm... maybe it’s best I just show you.” With that, Marfa opened her coat up wide. Viola and Uma gasped in unison when they saw that she wasn’t hiding anything other than herself under her coat. “I’m fucking pregnant!” Marfa said, putting her hands on her baby bump. She was huge; looking deep into her 8th month of pregnancy despite being completely in her 6th month a few hours before. Her shirt was tight across the swell of her stomach, and had risen up to show off most of its curve. Her tits had grown too, and were actively straining against her bra and her shirt. Marfa panted as she rubbed her pregnant bump in order to soothe herself. “Holy shit!” was all Viola could say. Uma walked down the stairs for a better look. “That can’t be real. You’re playing a joke on us, right?” she said. “I wish I was,” Marfa said. She groaned as she gripped her stomach even tighter and tensed up. Viola could see movement inside her friend as her belly bulged to one side. There was definitely a baby in there. “I- I just keep on growing too,” she said, her voice cracking with worry. All three girls watched as Marfa’s pregnancy quickly progressed. Her belly surged forwards evenly in every direction. It tightened and became firmer as she grew. Her shirt did the same, becoming skin tight as it rose up and over her expanding stomach. Her baby was quite active as it grew rapidly, and it constantly kicked and squirmed, making her belly bulge. Marfa’s breasts slowly grew too. They pushed over the top of her bra and ballooned through the neckline of her top. Her tits were already heavily lactating in preparation for her baby. Massive wet patches covered the front of her shirt, and constantly grew larger as her full breasts kept on pumping out milk. Above, her cleavage deepened and deepened, making her tits look even bigger. Viola guessed they were around EE cups in size, but she knew Marfa was usually only an B cup. Her bra tightened and tightened until Marfa looked like she couldn’t take any more. Between the tightening of her bra and her ballooning, pregnant belly, she began to groan incessantly. Viola was about to step forward but immediately stopped when she heard a splashing sound. She saw Marfa&#39;s pants become soaked, followed by a trickle of water running down her legs to pool on the floor. Viola gulped and looked at Uma, who looked just as worried as she was feeling. “Girls, I’m going to need your help – ahhhhhh,” Marfa said, before squeezing her eyes shut and moaning. She bent forwards and groaned, her belly pressing against her thighs as she clearly started having contractions. Her stomach tensed up, and she gripped her knees as she breathed through the pain. “I-I can’t... I can’t fucking give birth! Ohhhhhh,” she said, struggling with the sudden contractions. “Viola,” said Uma as she hurried down the rest of the stairs. Viola was already moving too, and arrived by Marfa’s side quickly. She took her arm in one hand, and held her hand with the other. Marfa squeezed tight and groaned as her body was immediately stuck by another contraction. They seemed far too frequent to be natural. Soon, Uma was supporting Marfa from the other side too. “Come on, let’s get her to my room,” said Viola. The two of them helped Marfa shuffle to Viola’s room, just a little further down the hallway. Viola could feel her tensing up and struggling to walk as her body constantly spasmed. Milk droplets were forming at the front of her shirt, having completely saturated the fabric now. Each contraction made her lactate more, and each one also seemed to cause her more pain. Her grunts and groans were growing louder. They moved through the doorway and helped Marfa onto the bed. She breathed heavily and shuffled back until her head was on the pillow. She lay flat, with her big, full belly rising above her. It looked even more huge now she was lying down. It rose and fell with her breaths, and tensed up every few moments as she went through labor. “It hurts! It hurts so baddddd,” Marfa moaned, grabbing the bedsheets tightly. “I know, hun,” said Uma. “But we’re gonna help you.” Viola looked her laboring friend up and down, seeing her struggle. She needed to do something. “We need to get these clothes off her,” Viola said. “You take the shirt and I’ll get the pants.” Uma nodded and did as she was instructed, grabbing Marfa’s shirt and slowly starting to prise it upwards. Viola climbed onto the bed and went to work on the trousers after she took Marfa’s shoes off. She undid the button and gasped as Marfa’s belly pushed the zip down for her with its weight. Then, she grabbed the top of the pants and wiggled them over her friend’s hips and thighs. She raised Marfa’s legs up and pulled them down past her feet. Meanwhile, Uma pulled Marfa’s shirt over her head, leaving the pregnant girl in just her bra and panties. Viola could see just how tight and full Marfa looked now. Her belly was straining and bulging as it went deeper into labor. Each time she breathed in, it looked impossibly bigger, too. There was a bulge under her wet knickers as her pussy throbbed and waited for birth. Marfa spread her legs wide and grunted as she was hit by another painful wave. Viola grabbed the panties and began to work them downwards. Marfa’s writhing didn’t help, but she kept on trying to get her knickers off. They slipped down her thighs, and then her knees. After that, it was easy. She threw the underwear aside just as Marfa propped herself up on her elbows and looked down over her pregnant body. Her eyes went wide all of a sudden. “Oh fuck! My belly! It’s still growing!” she shouted, just as she grunted through more pain. Viola paid more attention and stared at Marfa’s belly. She did look larger now, like she was overdue with triplets. Not only that, but her stomach was gradually pressing outwards. She could see it rising slowly up, getting larger and tighter. Stretch marks were beginning to show along its side as it just kept on growing, despite her being in labor. “Oh wow... it really is still growing,” Uma said. She leaned forwards and looked closely, watching it rise up and up. “That’s not right... you’re supposed to stop when you hit labor,” Viola said. “You think I don’t know that?!” said Marfa. “This is fucked up!” Her whole body suddenly tensed up and she trembled. Viola saw Marfa’s pussy bulge and spread as the baby moved downwards. Marfa screamed loudly and grabbed the bedframe behind her. It must have been her worst contraction yet. It made her shake wildly, and her bra began to tear. One of the straps slowly ripped across its width, and then her bra burst off her swollen tits. Milk erupted from Marfa’s nipples as her breasts jiggled free. It sprayed up high and fell back down over the bed and across the pregnant girl’s body. Uma, however, was leaning right over Marfa as she forcefully lactated. A lot of milk hit her face before Viola also got sprinkled with it. It went over her arms, and she rubbed it off herself as Uma pushed away and coughed and spluttered. She wiped her face down and spat out some milk too. “Are you okay?” Viola asked, having to speak up to be heard over Marfa’s moaning. Uma nodded and gave her chin one last wipe down. She still had milk in her hair as she looked over to Viola. “Yeah, I just wasn’t expecting it, is all,” she said. “S-sorry,” Marfa said, going even redder. Her tits were still spraying milk, albeit less forcefully. Her belly was still growing too. She looked larger than any pregnancy Viola had ever seen, and she was still growing. She added inch after inch to her belly as she grew, and her growth didn’t seem to show any signs of stopping. She gritted her teeth as her belly tightened once more. “It’s okay,” replied Uma. “You’ve got more to be concerned w-“ she stopped her sentence short and looked down. Her hands went to her belly. She ran her fingers over her blouse, feeling for something. Viola looked over and frowned, trying to work out what was wrong. As she watched, she could see that Uma’s middle looked a little pudgier than usual. Her digits sank into her soft stomach and, each time they did, they found more belly. “No, no, no, this can’t be real,” Uma said, shaking her head. “It’s happening to me too!” Her belly was definitely growing. It expanded forward into her hands as it took on a curvier shape. The swell of her stomach became more and more pronounced as it pressed up against her blouse. Soon, her belly had become noticeably rounded, where it had been completely flat before. Viola felt her heart pounding as the implication became clear. “The milk...” she whispered, looking down at herself. She wiped the last of it off her arms and then stared at her own belly. She watched and waited, hoping that she wouldn’t start growing like Uma did. Her stomach was slightly chubby anyway, but it didn’t seem to be any larger than usual. Thankfully, it remained still as she stared, but she still felt uneasy. “It must be because Uma swallowed it,” Viola thought. “Oh my goddddd, it’s coming!” Marfa suddenly yelled. She screamed as she started to push. Viola saw the girl’s pussy stretching as her baby moved down between her hips. Her lips spread wide and the baby started to crown. Marfa grimaced and clutched her ballooning belly as she bore down hard. Her stomach looked tight and taut now, obviously straining to grow with her pregnancy. It was about 2 and a half feet across and gaining, with more stretch marks appearing by the moment. Marfa pushed again, and the top of the baby’s head emerged a little more. Viola became distracted by a strange feeling in her stomach. It felt like she was full, and it was slowly becoming more noticeable. The feeling pressed outwards slowly but surely, and Viola swallowed as she felt her fear coming true. She looked down and squealed when she saw her belly slowly expanding larger. She could see it pushing ahead underneath her green dress. It made the fabric flow over its modest curve, which was getting larger and larger as she watched in horror. “I-I’m pregnant too,” Viola said, feeling numb as her belly pushed into the first trimester. The other two girls were too preoccupied to notice. Uma was stood by the bedside, pressing on her bulging baby bump. “Stop... stop growing,” she was saying, but her pregnancy just kept on progressing. She looked about 4 months pregnant already, and her blouse was getting really tight around her bloated middle. The material was pulled taut across her firm belly, and the buttons were starting to strain. They began to pull apart, revealing her growing bump through the gaps slowly but surely. Her stomach inched ahead visibly, and her expansion was definitely quicker than Viola’s or Marfa’s. Marfa writhed on the bed as her laboring body made her scream. Her belly had become worryingly large, and looked like an overinflated beach ball. It was gradually growing larger and larger, hiding the girl behind it over time. It was almost perfectly round and bulged as her baby kicked inside her, eager to be born. Marfa tried to oblige, and clearly pushed with all her might. The baby’s head pushed forwards a fraction, spreading Marfa even wider as she groaned deeply. The effort it took her to push didn’t yield great results. Still, she pushed again, and her baby shifted again, but even less this time. “Ohhhhh, this is so hardddd! The baby is so fucking big!” Marfa complained. “Come on Marfa, you’re doing really good. Just keep pushing,” Viola said. She shuffled forward on the bed, feeling her own belly pulling her forwards a little. She placed her hand on Marfa’s knee, letting her know she was there. Meanwhile, Viola could feel her own pregnancy moving on. Her belly rubbed against her dress constantly now, reminding her of her fate. As she looked down, she saw she looked about 3 months along. Her belly continued to expand as she watched it. It looked like she had stuffed a balloon up her dress and was slowly inflating it. Only it wasn’t air inside her, and she certainly felt heavier with each passing second. Viola felt Marfa’s leg tense up as she pushed again. The baby barely moved at all. She pushed again, and then again, screaming as she did so. Viola saw the baby didn’t budge this time. Marfa’s belly was nearly 3 feet tall now, and it trembled as it tried to make her push with another contraction. Even that didn’t work. Marfa let out a cry of desperation. “It’s stuck! My baby is stuck inside me!” she yelled. “No, no it’s not,” Viola reassured, but she wasn’t sure she believed it herself. She looked at Marfa’s belly with apprehension. It rose steadily higher and higher as her unnatural pregnancy still kept on progressing. The longer she took to give birth, the larger her baby was becoming... and the harder the birth would be. “You’ve just got to take a few deep breaths and then try again. Isn’t that right, Uma?” Viola continued. “What? Oh, yeah, just keep trying, Marfa,” Uma said. She barely even looked up from her own body. She had grown huge in the moments since Viola had last looked at her. She was 7 months pregnant, and her blouse was barely holding her back. The hem of her shirt had risen up to her navel, showing off the steep curve of her lower belly. Her tits had expanded too, and were already lactating. Wet patches spread out from her nipples as her breasts piled on another cup size, reaching the size of melons. The buttons of her blouse were strained to their maximum and, as she grew a little more, one of them burst off. It revealed a large swathe of her belly, including her belly button as it popped to an outie. Another button popped, and then another. Finally, her belly burst out of the blouse, and her breasts followed suit. The vast curve of her baby bump was on show now, and her bra could be seen heroically holding back her milky breasts. Uma stumbled and grunted, unable to control her swelling body. “Urgh it’s too much... the baby is too big! It hurts!” Marfa whined. She pushed again, but nothing happened. The baby was truly stuck in place... and it was still growing. It forced her belly to stretch and swell. It inched out and ballooned up more and more. Her skin looked tight and painfully stretched as stretch marks spread across the surface of her belly. Her body let out a small creaking sound as her baby’s head became lodged between her hips. Viola grumbled as she felt her dress starting to tighten around her own growing bump. Her belly felt so big and round to her, and it protruded ahead of her much more than she would have liked it to. She saw it gradually pushing ahead as the life bloomed inside of her rapidly. It made her dress rise upwards and slowly expose more and more of her thick thighs. Even as it moved upwards, she could see the fabric stretching around her pregnancy. As she swelled to be 5 months along, she still couldn’t believe what she was seeing. She was undeniably pregnant now, but she desperately didn’t want it to be true. “Ahhhh! It’s stretching meeee! It’s stretching me too much!” Marfa yelled. She grabbed her belly and screamed as her body struggled to contain her growing baby. Her belly, now over 3 feet wide, started to take on a red hue. It strained and stretched, and the stretch marks began to look angry. Her tummy tensed up and forced her to push again. She let out a yell, and Viola could see the outline of her massive baby as her stomach squeezed around it. Marfa’s pussy bulged as she tried to give birth, but it couldn’t stretch any wider. Marfa pushed with all her might, then fell back on the bed, panting. Viola glanced at Uma, who was cradling her big belly in her hands. She looked nearly full term now, and she was still expanding. Her breasts were as big as her head, and looked full and engorged. They were surging over her bra and, as she watched, she saw her nipples swell over the top of the cups. They sprayed milk into the air as Uma moaned, putting her hands over them to stop the flow of milk. But it was too late. Her milk had sprayed over the bed, and splashed onto Marfa’s massive belly. The effect was immediate. “Oh god, the pressure!” Marfa shouted, throwing her head back and screaming. She grabbed at her belly as it expanded much quicker. It rose up and out, adding inches by the second. Her stretch marks turned a deep shade of purple, and her belly became totally rigid. Her fingers left trails of white through the red as they clutched at her heavily taxed blimp of a belly. She stretched until she couldn’t stretch anymore. “I’m- I’m gonna burst!” Marfa yelled. She let out a long, terrible scream as her belly gave in. Her stretch marks ripped open first and, for a few agonising moments, her belly still held together. Viola and Uma quickly took cover behind the bed, both of them screaming too. Then, Marfa’s overgrown baby tore right through her. She burst explosively, splattering all over the bed. Then, her yelping fell silent and the sound of a crying baby replaced it. Slowly, unsteadily, Viola and Uma stood up. They looked at what had happened to Marfa and screamed yet again. Next to her burst body, there was a baby. It looked several months too old, and it had clearly grown very far past the gestation period, which explained why Marfa had grown so big. “Holy shit! Is- is that going to happen to us too?! Are we gonna pop?!” Uma said, looking worriedly over at Viola. Viola gulped. She looked down at her bloating belly and took a few deep breaths. Her pregnancy was now 7 months along, and her breasts were starting to expand. They filled into her bra, and she felt them squishing up against the cups. They grew slowly and steadily, pushing their way over her bra and rubbing against her dress. She could feel a deep throbbing begin from deep inside them, and knew she was starting to produce milk. Viola’s belly felt large and heavy. It dragged at her centre of gravity, and she had to put a hand on the small of her back in order to counterbalance it. Her dress was pulled completely taut across her bump now, and had risen up so high that almost all of her meaty thighs were on show. She gasped as she felt and saw movement inside her swollen stomach. The baby... her baby, was kicking. She watched with horror as her pregnancy continued to progress, her belly inevitably moving ahead and getting worryingly larger. “Um... Viola?” Uma said. There was a pause for a second before her water broke. It soaked her pants and Uma closed her eyes, as if she could shut it all out. “The baby is coming,” she said with a shaky voice. Her belly visibly tensed up and her face twisted into a silent scream. She leaned over the bed and put her hands on the mattress. Her belly hung below her and her bra strained to keep her breasts in check from all the movement. A second later, it snapped, and her massive, watermelon sized boobs swayed free. They dribbled milk all over the bedsheets below her. Viola started moving around the bed to help her friend. She had to waddle since her pregnant belly felt so heavy and pressed awkwardly down on her hips. She could feel her breasts jiggling and wobbling with every step, and groaned as they pulsed with a full-feeling discomfort. They had grown about a cup size now, to around a C cup. They continued to grow against her bra, and forced it to tighten around her back and shoulders. She arrived next to Uma and rubbed her hand across her back as she laboured. She could even feel her back muscles contracting as her whole body tried to expel the baby from inside her. Uma groaned and grumbled, gripping the bed tightly as she was struck by contractions. Her belly expanded below her all the while. Thanks to swallowing a mouthful of milk, her baby was growing even faster than Marfa’s had. Viola watched with concern how quickly her stomach was growing. Not only that, but Uma was considerably skinnier than Marfa, and her body already looked massively disproportioned thanks to her overdue pregnancy. “I need to get this damn thing out of me,” Uma said through gritted teeth. She moaned as she pushed hard, and Viola could see her pants bulge as she tried to give birth. Viola moved behind and reached around Uma, feeling her own belly pressing up against Uma’s back. She reached around her and undid her trousers, even as her own belly expanded against her friend. Then, she took a step back and pulled Uma’s pants down all the way to her ankles. She did the same for her knickers, leaving her completely naked save for her tattered blouse and tight bra. Uma pushed really hard once more, and Viola could see her vagina bulging. She panted and breathed as best as she could, but the panicked pace of her pushing was clear. Her belly moved as she pushed the baby further, but the going was slow. Her narrow hips and slender body were already causing problems as she started to look overdue with triplets. Viola moaned as her own baby kicked hard again. It made her belly move uncomfortably before the baby settled down again. Her stomach was really getting big and round as she entered her final month of pregnancy. It kept on swelling up, rising further and further with each of her breaths. It protruded far ahead of her and made her back ache with its weight. She felt so incredibly full, and the pressure on her hips was constantly getting more intense. Viola’s dress clung to her belly and rose so far up that her ass showed from underneath it. She grew larger, exposing her black panties as her dress hung from the front of her bump. Her boobs were pushing up and out through the dress’ neckline too. They swelled and squished against one another as the fabric tried to hold them back. She groaned as her bra dug deep into her soft titties, which were now about DD cups in size. Her dress became wet as her clothes squeezed milk out of her, and the relief of lactation was palpable. She was still throbbing with fullness, but she could see the wet circles enlarging as she just kept on lactating and lactating. “I can’t get this baby moving, Viola,” said Uma just before she grunted again. “I don’t- I don’t want it to be stuck...” She took a deep breath and bore down as hard as she could. Viola watched and waited for signs of crowning, but there were none. Instead, her belly just filled out larger and larger. It was beginning to look like Marfa’s did; stretch marks were appearing and spreading wider, and her belly became as large as a beach ball. She screamed in exasperation. “Please! I feel so full! It’s stretching me but I can’t push it out!” she shouted, leaning further forwards as she began to tire. “Come on Uma, you can do this,” said Viola. She rubbed her hand on Uma’s lower back again, trying to encourage her. “You just need to push har- ohhhh no,” Viola said, just as she felt a shift of pressure inside her body. A weight moved down between her hips, and then erupted out of her. Her water broke, drenching her panties and splashing down onto the floor below her. A moment later, her womb contracted powerfully. Viola yelped as the pain caught her off guard. Her body trembled and her legs went weak. She stumbled forwards, leaning on Uma for a moment before she slipped. She fell to her knees, and moved forwards so she was on all fours. Her body was wracked by pain as her baby made her go into labor. She groaned and shook while her belly squeezed agonisingly. She closed her eyes and rode out the pain until it slowly faded away. “Oh my god, that is intense,” breathed Viola, already dreading the next contraction. Uma was barely listening. Instead, she was pushing and pushing without barely taking a breath. Her face turned red as she squeezed and squeezed, but to no avail. Her baby squirmed inside her causing bumps to appear all over her pregnant tummy, which was now nearly 3 feet wide. It nestled against the bed in front of her, but mostly still hung over the side heavily. “It’s too much... the baby’s really pushing me too far,” cried Uma. “Get out! Get outtttt!” Her face scrunched up tight as she strained. Her belly tightened more than Viola had seen before. A moment later, she heard a horrible squelching noise. Uma screamed. “Oh god... oh god, that was my birth canal. My baby just burst my birth canal!” Uma shouted. Her body didn’t give her a moment to rest, though, and nor did Viola’s. Both girls were simultaneously hit by another contraction. Viola felt her baby move between her hips and into birthing position. It stretched her wide and she grimaced in discomfort. She didn’t bare to think of having her own canal burst, so she focused on beginning to push her baby out instead. Uma, on the other hand, took in a deep breath of air. “Its moving!” she said. Her baby shifted inside of her, now that it could fit through her ruined birth canal. Taking that as a cue, Uma began pushing again. The baby began to bulge against her vagina for the first time. With another push, however, it became stuck in her narrow hips. She pushed and pushed despite this and... Viola jumped in shock as Uma’s hips both popped loudly. Her baby had clearly become too large for her to handle. She collapsed forward into the bed, resting at an awkward angle on her belly. Her stomach was strained and red, just as Marfa’s had been. Uma moaned incessantly atop her belly, which forced her upwards as it grew and grew even still. Viola saw the stretch marks beginning to bleed as her pregnancy became too large for her body to support. “Oh no, no, no, noooooo,” Uma cried. Then, suddenly, her belly popped. Uma was flung upwards a little before she fell down onto the bed in the space where her belly had been, and landed with a splat. Her baby fell beside her, and cried loudly. It was massive, and Viola could barely believe it had ever fit inside her friend&#39;s tummy. “Holy shit, this is so fucked,” Viola said, her mind going into a state of utter panic. Her belly now looked about a month overdue, and felt every bit as tight. It pushed up against her lactating tits as it grew on and on. Still on all fours, she could see it spreading towards the ground below her, and knew she needed to give birth as soon as possible. She reached down and tugged at her panties. She teased them down her legs until they were around her thighs, then shifted into a seated position on her bum, leaning up against the bed behind her. She brought her knees up for a better birthing position. “I’ve got to get my kid out before it bursts me,” she said, mentally preparing herself. Her belly began to tighten once again and she used it to help her push. She screamed and yelled as her baby squeezed between her hips. She felt her pussy engorge as her child shifted closer and closer to birth. Her belly spread agony through her, but she could feel the contraction moving the baby further and further. Soon, it was right between her legs, and was spreading her wide. “Urghhhh this is so harddddd,” Viola said. She yelled as her vagina burned and stretched. Her baby crowned, pushing from its unwilling mother slowly but surely. She strained and strained, making her child emerge more and more. The pain was nearly unbearable, but she found that moaning and screaming helped a little. She could feel her child growing inside her. It pushed against her womb and against her hips. A deeply uncomfortable pressure pressed out from inside her. It made her belly swell even larger. Her dress failed to hold it back as it became large enough to hold twins. The fabric jumped up and over her bump, nestling up to her inflated breasts. Her massive belly was revealed, and Viola gasped as she saw how large she had become. It was round and full, and hid the view below her. She could see the outie belly button topping its curve, as well as a few stretch marks along the sides of her stomach. She could also see it steadily inching upwards, which reminded her to keep pushing. “Push, Viola, push,” she said as she squeezed. She felt her pussy stretch wider and wider until it became agonising. Her baby crowned and forced her open as she tried to push it out. She screamed and pushed, screamed and pushed, and each time she did, she felt her child inch out a little more. She also felt the effect of each push diminish too, as her child gradually became larger. It was rapidly sapping her energy, and she could feel exhaustion setting in as she continued with her efforts. Soon, the head was halfway out, yet she could feel the baby getting incredibly hard to shift. Viola took a moment to catch her breath. She leaned back on the bed, resting her head and panting. Her F cup tits sprayed milk through her soaked dress, and it dribbled down onto her bloated baby bump. They had grown so large that they were now overflowing her bra. They swelled further and further ahead until the bra cups slipped underneath them and her newly exposed nipples rubbed against her dress. Below, her belly rose up and down, and each time it sank back down, it was larger. It neared 2 and a half feet across, and the skin really started to feel stretched. She could see it straining and swelling larger and larger. Her baby wasn’t going to stop growing anytime soon. “Keep going... this giant baby needs to come out,” Viola said. She was so tired, but she knew she needed to push, or she was going to burst. She gritted her teeth and bore down again, despite not having the energy for it. She felt her child move ever so slightly, stretching her again and making her cry out in pain. The fiery feeling spread through her pussy but she fought through it and pushed again. The birth progressed a fraction more. She pushed again, and again, over and over, making her baby inch out of her swelling body. The work was intense agony, but the alternative was unthinkable. Viola gave another squeeze, and felt her baby’s head emerge entirely. The shoulders wedged against her hips and made her pussy bulge even more. She pushed, and felt the shoulders move a worryingly small amount. Another push yielded the same result. Each time she tried to shift the baby, it drained her until, finally, she didn’t have the strength to push at all. She slumped against the bed again and groaned in defeat. She felt the child pushing outwards, making her belly balloon up. Her stomach had become so taut that a tight pain began to spread across its surface. It continued to expand, moving outwards gradually. The stretch marks became redder as she watched her pregnancy become several months overdue. She could also feel her hips being pressed outwards by the pressure. The painful sensations made her whimper, and she knew they were only going to get worse. “I don’t want to burst,” Viola cried, placing her hands on her ballooning belly. It pushed her grasp outwards as it filled up with more and more baby. It flared up in pain, each time drawing a moan from her lips. She glanced across it and took a deep breath. Her baby was nearly born... she just needed one last attempt. She couldn’t just sit there and let herself burst. Viola gathered the last remnants of her strength and leaned forwards. She groaned and bore down intensely, gripping her painful tummy. Her child’s shoulders squeezed against her vagina and she let out a scream. She didn’t stop pushing. The shoulders moved centimetre by painful centimetre. She felt her baby shift forwards, and didn’t dare let up. Her belly was really straining now, and she knew this was her last chance. “Just get out of meeeee!” Viola yelled, giving this last push her all. She trembled as a stretch mark on her belly started to bleed slightly, but she could also feel the baby moving out of her. Her vision started to fade from the sheer effort she was exerting. She fought to hold on to consciousness as she tried to birth her gigantic child. With another scream, the shoulders emerged from her pussy. She took another breath, then squeezed once again. This time, the baby slipped out of her and landed between her legs. Viola let out a long exhale and collapsed, hearing her baby’s cries fill her ears. “Oh, thank god,” she said, breathing heavily. It took her a few minutes to be able to move again. When she did, she leaned forwards and picked her baby up. It was heavy and large, and she struggled to bring it up to her chest. It looked about 5 months old, meaning she was 14 months pregnant when she had given birth. Still breathing deeply, she finally allowed herself to take in what had just happened. She had woken up that morning expecting it to be just like any other day... and now she was a mother. It had happened in a matter of minutes, and she had nearly burst in the process. Not only that, but her breast milk now had the chance of making anyone it touched burst with babies too. It was a lot to process but, in the middle of it all, she decided to look after her friends’ babies as well. Right now, though, she needed to get some help. Viola shakily stood up, carrying her new-born 5 month old with her. She went to her phone on the bedside table and called the hospital. When they picked up, it sounded chaotic. “I’m really sorry but we have quite a situation here, you’re going to have to call back another time,” came the voice on the other side. “Wait! What do you mean?! I need your help!” Viola said. “Sorry but we can’t help. There’s been an outbreak here and... oh god, my belly... its happening to me too. Sorry, I’ve gotta go,” the woman on the other end said before she hung up...</p>
