<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carl thought for a moment about his options and then looked at the smiling otters. He never really did anything spontaneous before. This could be fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
“All right lets go play” said Carl with a smile.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Yay” said Flip.<br />
<br />
<br />
“This way” said Slide as the two otters bound off. <br />
<br />
<br />
Carl chuckled and followed them. It was nice to meet people who were so free with themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
They soon came upon a large lake. Under the moonlight it positively radiated serenity and a natural beauty and quiet. That was of course until Slide cannon balled into it and Flip with a whoop dived in. They both splashed around in it for a moment and then looked at Carl.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Come on in!” said Slide with a smile.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Yeah, water is wonderful” said Flip.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Um, I don’t have any swim trunks” said Carl uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
<br />
“What are those?” asked Flip.<br />
<br />
<br />
“It’s a type of clothing humans wear when they swim.” said Carl.<br />
<br />
<br />
“That’s silly,” said Slide, “why not just swim without any of that?”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it’s a lot more fun and less bulky and stuff. I mean look at what you have on now. You could never get good speed in those.” said Flip.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Well these aren’t meant for swimming.” said Carl.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Well we don't have any swim trunks. So your not wearing them will mean nothing to us. In fact you would be the weird one for wearing them in this case.” said Flip with a smile.<br />
<br />
<br />
“I guess your right.” said Carl a little unsure. <br />
<br />
<br />
He wasn’t sure he wanted to be skinny dipping. But then these two otters were naked for all the fur they wore and he had seen them naked. It would be at least fair in a weird way if they saw him naked too.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Just… um… okay right give me a second.” said Carl as he took off his shoes and cloths and then neatly folded them out of the way. Then he jumped in.<br />
<br />
<br />
“You’re silly!” said Slide.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Come on there is a lot of neat stuff to see you have to see this neat rock at the bottom of the lake and just about everything else too.” said Flip.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Okay.” said Carl as he began to swim with them. <br />
<br />
<br />
What followed was essentially and hour of splashing swimming and running around, Carl had never been so active in his life with pointless frantic energy. Even when he was a kid he had been sedate. These two otters’ personalities and energies were infectious. He soon was laughing and splashing right along with them and while no where as quick as they were in swimming they didn’t hold it against him. Well unless you counted the tag game they had played at one point. <br />
<br />
<br />
Carl was having one of the best times of his life. It was great and it felt so freeing. Within an hour he had seen shells stones and weird rocks. He had played numerous games of tag, had cannon-balled into the water and generally had had wonderful time. He was absolutely beaming and had a smile almost as wide as the otters’ smiles. Of course they just seemed to smile naturally at everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why are you guys so happy all the time?” asked Carl after they had played for an hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why shouldn’t; we be?” asked Flip.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Yeah” said Slide “I mean we can swim, we have plenty of food and we have fun and stuff. Why not be happy?”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Well I don’t know. Um I mean you guys are some sort of new species and you are maybe the only ones of your kind and who knows what will happen to you?” said Carl, losing his levity as he thought about all this. He was worried for his new friends.<br />
<br />
<br />
“COOL! An ADVENTURE!” said Slid happily.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Yeah and we get to run around even more so then before!” said Flip.<br />
<br />
<br />
Carl laughed and smiled again they just couldn’t get depressed. You had to admire that kind of optimism and lack of worry and stress. He was kind of jealous of it really. Then Slide came up to him and snuggled closely in a hug. Carl was surprised, but eh returned the hug.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about stuff be happy!” said Slide.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” said Flip as he hugged Carl from behind.<br />
<br />
<br />
“I guess so” said Carl, “but, it’s sort of in my nature to worry.”<br />
<br />
<br />
That was when Slide kissed him on his nose.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Um… what was that for?” asked Carl Surprised<br />
<br />
<br />
“You’re silly!” said Slide “Wanna play another game?”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Ooo, you mean that game?” asked Flip.<br />
<br />
<br />
“What game?” Carl asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
“We discovered we can play this game today. We got all active without any females around so we helped each other out and it was fun and stuff!” said Flip. <br />
<br />
<br />
Carl was about to ask what he meant, but then felt something against his leg and then it occurred to him what they were talking about; Sex.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Um… uh” Carl said eloquently. <br />
<br />
<br />
He was straight this was all new territory for him he had never even thought of doing it with a guy.<br />
<br />
<br />
“What is the mater?” asked Slide genuine concern on his face.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Um… well your guys… and um… well…” Carl tried to find the words.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Never done it before?” asked Flip.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Yes. Wait uh, that wasn’t… well… Yeah, I’m a virgin.” said Carl uncomfortably. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now would come the verbal assaults everyone made fun of him for waiting.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Well what is the matter with that?” asked Slide giving him a tight hug.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Is that the name for it?” Asked Flip nonchalantly hugging Carl from the back “Why so uncomfortable Carl?”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Uh well it’s just a lot of people think I’m stupid for not having sex.” said Carl.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Big sillies!” said Slide kissing him on his nose again.<br />
<br />
<br />
“I uh, never have been with a girl before; none ever seemed interested in me. I think they find me boring.” said Carl.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Even bigger sillies, you’re a lot of fun!” said Flip. “I didn’t have a mate during mating season, once; I know how it feels.”<br />
<br />
“Well if you want you can play with us.” said Slide with a smile. “But you don’t have to, we can play other games, but I would like too and so would Flip and I think you would too.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Carl then noticed he was hard. That was weird. He had never been attracted to a male before let alone two males with fur coats and muzzles and tails. Little did Carl realize that the virus that had turned Flip and Slide into anthropomorphic animals had turned their pheromone scents into something that would make anyone who was exposed to it turned on either otter or human. He had been around them enough to get a huge dose of their pheromones by now and so was very open to sex with them, but did he want sex? What about their friendship and wasn’t it kind weird to have sex with animals even animal people… wouldn’t it be better to just play and forget about this? <br />
<br />
<br />
Carl decided to…</p>
