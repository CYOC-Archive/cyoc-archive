<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Alecia was keeping watch over her family, a mysterious aura suddenly came into existence right besides her. Its appearance was so sudden that Alecia, who never had a great sence for these kind of things anyways, didn&#39;t even realize she was no longer sitting alone anymore. She only found out when a pair of arm suddenly wrapped themselves around her body and the head of whomever it is was now resting on her left shoulder as she was pulled into a loving embrace feom behind. Before she could even react, the stranger began to speak. &quot;My my, to think that you would become such a beautiful and caring woman, my dear Alec, or should I stick to calling you Alecia now?&quot; <br />
<br />
The voice was clearly that of a womans, as well as the shape of the thin arms and the feeling of breasts pushing into Alecia&#39;s back all pointed to the fact that this stranger was woman. What bothered Alecia though was that she should be scared, or at the very least on guard against this sudden intruder, but for some reason she felt relieved and much calmer now ever since she appeared. There was also something familiar about her, but since she was still hugging Alecia from behind, Alecia still couldn&#39;t identify who exactly it was.<br />
<br />
The other thing which bothered her, was in what the woman had said. Who was this Alec? Alecia felt she knew of who the woman was referring to, but just couldn&#39;t place a face to the name. Maybe it was just a now long forgotten acquaintance they shared? Either way, she was asked a question, so she shouldn&#39;t be rude and just remain silent. &quot;Please Dear, just call me Alecia like usual.&quot; Dear? Usual? She didn&#39;t mean to say those. But it just came out with the sentance, like it was a habit something.<br />
<br />
Finally the woman released her and took a seat right beside her, but only after draping a blanket over Alecia&#39;s back and wrapping herself in it too. Now sharing a blanket with this mysterious woman, Alecia could finally identify who her &quot;Dear&quot; was. When she finally was able to see the woman&#39;s face, she knew instantly who she was. The realization shocked her deeply, but even Alecia didn&#39;t, or rather couldn&#39;t bring herself to feel any sort of hostile intentions towards her, eventhough just a while ago, they had been bitter enemies. <br />
<br />
The Witch was now just staring back at Alecia, this time in a way more loving and caring manner than what Alecia was expecting. Didn&#39;t she just die? Thought Alecia. Somehow, she was deeply saddened by the thought if the Witch&#39;s death. It felt wrong, but she now felt that she could never bring herself to wish for the Witch&#39;s demise. Nor could she bring herself to hate this lovely woman. The Witch spoke again, which only made Alecia lower her guard even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry if I startled you honey. Your back was just so huggable that I just couldn&#39;t resist! I am still amazed by the fact that such a beautiful woman agreed to be my wife. I feel like the happiest woman in the world when you asked me out you know. It is still one of my happiest memories. And the fact that me being a futanari not only didn&#39;t push you away, but allowed you to bring our family 3 amazing children makes me wonder if I am dreaming.&quot; These words brought with them a slew of new memories and emotions for Alecia. She had asked out this gorgous woman that she had happened upon while walking through the swamp while on a quest. How that while she was surprised at first, she had fallen in love with her body, including her dick, which she somehow knew was the biggest dick she had ever seen. It was about the size of her forearm, but when they had sex for the first time after a couple months of dating, she had managed to fit its full length inside of her. She remembered their marriage, which happened 2 years ago. Her first pregnancy, with which she delivered fraternal twin girls. Then her second pregnancy, which gave her her first and only son, Andrew. How The Witch had comforted her when she grew her massive breasts, which didn&#39;t fit proportionately on her slender and athletic frame, in order to feed her babies with more than enough milk.<br />
<br />
All of these and more flooded into her head, as well as some minor changes to other things around her. Things like how she and the Witch were now wearing a pair of matching wedding band. Her engagement ring with its pink diamond gemstone. Her equipment was now in much better conditions. <br />
<br />
A carriage was now parked nearby, with a pair of half horse/half human girls, which were basically normal girls except with horse legs and hooves instead of human arms, hands, feet, and legs. They also had a horse tail and walkwd on all fours only. Thdy were both sleeping cutely curlled up together next to each other. Training them had been difficult, but now they were both so very well behaved. They even had become good friends with Alecia since she would often give the both of them sugar cubes, stroke their manes, pet them, brush them, and even on occasion, would hand feed them some apples.<br />
<br />
Alecia remembered when she first met the sisters, and how she had been attacked by them out of the blue, only to be saved by the Witch at the last second. Then, while they were being trained by the Witch, Alecia had made an extreme effort to bond with them. She had felt bad for them since they seemed like nice girls, who unfortunately had been abandoned by their parents and were only doing whatever they could to survive. She had taken pity on them, and offered them a chance to redeem themselves. They both had accepted on the spot, and even allowed the witch to turn them into horsegirls willingly to prove their sincerity. They have made such lovely additions to her family. <br />
<br />
The final change happened with the Witch herself. She was now wearing an outfit which was better suited for moving around in, and had pants, not a short skirt like Alecia did. However because of that, Alecia could clearly see her erection buldge half way up her torso too, and she liked what she could see. &quot;Hey Irie, I could fix that HUGE issue for you, if you would like&quot; Alecia said as she pointed toward Irie&#39;s erect cock buldge. &quot;Oh? Do you think you can handle such a large thing quietly?&quot; Joked Irie. &quot;I can&#39;t make that much noise while I have a 14&quot; long horsecock shoved that deep into my throat.&quot; Alecia answered while giving Irie a naughty look of both lust and excitement, as she unbuttoned Irie&#39;s pants and began to slide her tongue all over her lover&#39;s massive cock.</p>
