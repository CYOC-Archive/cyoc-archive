<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After teleporting to each one of my friends and telling them where we should meet I teleported to the libary which was where we were going to meet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool world or dream you got here&quot; said Sara<br />
&quot;What a weird dream, I gotta wake up&quot; said chris<br />
&quot;Amazing Joey, I never knew you had such a good imagination&quot; said Amanda<br />
&quot;Oh everything's real, except for pain and all like that&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; said Sara<br />
&quot;I made it so, if you get hurt or die here you will only wake up in your bed in the real world like you had a nightmare, so it's pritty much safe + I have the ring to make it safe&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Ah okay&quot; said Amanda<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo Joey what should we do know?&quot; asked Sara<br />
&quot;Well, I have a really big world here and It's going to be hard to control it all by myself so I was wondering if you wanted to help&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Cool, what do you want us to do?&quot; asked chris<br />
&quot;I want to ask you if you would like to become staff? I can give you a small power over the overs to help for good, and if you abuse your power I remove it&quot; I said<br />
&quot;I won't abuse my power&quot; said Sara<br />
&quot;Me neither&quot; said Amanda<br />
&quot;Me three&quot; said Chris<br />
<br />
&quot;What is our power going to be?&quot; Sara asked<br />
&quot;To be able to help people who get stuck, trapped or whatever&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Do you mean help fix glitches? not helping people make stuff?&quot; said Chris<br />
&quot;No I don't want you to make stuff for people, thats what I don't want and I'll consider that as a abuse&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Sorry, I won't do that Joey&quot; said Chris<br />
&quot;I trust you, so I'll still give you the power but I will be watching to see if anybody abuses their power&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;What sort of things can we do with our power?&quot; asked Sara<br />
&quot;Well I will let you have ablity to make stuff and move people, shapeshrift but not transgender due to that causes problems&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Why not transgender&quot; asked Chris and then the girls crossed their arms at him.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; said Chris<br />
&quot;Because you could become a girl/Woman and the girls could become boys and it wouldn't be right&quot; I said<br />
&quot;I have want it so that you can not shapeshift into over staff members or people&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Amanda<br />
&quot;Because you could cause trouble by changing into somebody and lieing to their friends, and thats the last thing I want&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Ah okay, I see what you mean&quot; said Amanda<br />
<br />
&quot;I have created a area called the staff room which you can go to relax, but it's your responsibility to help people who are in trouble and that won't happen that often&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Okay, but when do we get our powers?&quot; asked Chris<br />
&quot;I will do it now&quot; I said and then I started to think of the wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that my friends infront of me could become staff of this world by helping me help people who get stuck or have problems; they will have the ability to teleport, go invisible but not to me, create items and buildings, be able to shapeshift but not transgender and will not have these powers anywhere else besides my world here&quot; I said<br />
<br />
When I had finished saying the wish my ring started to glow, it grew brighter and brighter till suddenly there was a shockwave of light which came from it.<br />
The shockwave of light went out but only seemed to head towards my friends.<br />
When the shockwave of light touched my friends, it just sucked its self to the nearest person which was my friends.<br />
When the wish was complete I wished to see if anyone else had any powers and I then knew that it was only my friends and me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, do you want to try out your wishes?&quot; I said<br />
&quot;How do we?&quot; asked Amanda<br />
&quot;Wish for it, like how I wish for stuff&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Okay here goes nothing, I wish a flash light will appear in my hand&quot; Amanda said and then a flash light appeared in her hand!<br />
&quot;You don't have to say it out loud, you can say it in your head&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Can't we make mistakes?&quot; said Chris and with chris saying that I wished that their wishes would only come true if they really wanted to wish it on purpose, not dreaming or thinking about it and then I told my friends:<br />
&quot;No, I've wished that you can't make mistakes, you can only make the wishes work if you do it on purpose meaning you wanted to make the wish and you now what you are doing&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Ah okay, I wish I had a green robe on&quot; said Chris and suddenly a green robe appeared on Chris.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to be able to know who needs help and where they are so, I wish that when we wish for a world helplist to appear, we will get a piece of paper saying what the person's name is and their problem + location&quot; I said<br />
&quot;But how do the people send the messages?&quot; asked Sara<br />
&quot;Oh, I wish that people who are in my world would know how to send messages to our helplist by saying Helpas ( message here )&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay so, we have a staff system done but what do we do when people arn't here&quot; asked Chris<br />
&quot;Then you can have time to relax and enjoy your self, but don't use your power on other people except for when you need to use it to help somebody&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Okay, but when is anybody coming on?&quot; Amanda asked<br />
&quot;Oh we have to find people, but don't choose people who pick on you or bullies so you can teach them a lesson because thats abusing your power&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Okay&quot; said Amanda<br />
<br />
&quot;What should we do now that we got that sorted?&quot; Amanda said<br />
&quot;Oh I got to make it so you can get to somewhere easily, I wish that when my friends infront of me or I put my hand over me chest, It will act like a panel and we only can use it&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Cool, can we do wishes like that?&quot; asked Sara<br />
&quot;Sorry no, you have a rank&quot; I said<br />
&quot;And what rank is that?&quot; asked Chris<br />
&quot;Rank 2 or you could call it Councilor&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Ah okay&quot; Chris replied<br />
&quot;But what rank does that make you?&quot; asked Amanda<br />
&quot;Rank 1, Administrator&quot; I said<br />
&quot;but why are you rank 1? why can't we&quot; said Chris<br />
&quot;Because I was the 1 who made this world and it was my idea&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Ah ok, I'm sorry&quot; said Chris<br />
<br />
&quot;What should we do now?&quot; asked Amanda<br />
&quot;We need a staff room don't we?&quot; said Sara<br />
&quot;Yea we do, but where?&quot; I said<br />
&quot;How about where are school is?&quot; said Chris<br />
&quot;Yeah great idea&quot; we all replied one by one.<br />
&quot;Okay so lets do it, I wish we were all outside our school&quot; I said and then we all appeared next to our school.<br />
&quot;excuse me&quot; said a small boy as he rushed past us.<br />
&quot;Do we know him? I've never met him?&quot; said Amanda<br />
&quot;He's a NPC or a made up person, I wished that my world was populated you see and I populated with people who don't exist so you need to get to know them&quot; I said<br />
&quot;But they are humans?&quot; Chris said<br />
&quot;Yeah but they can't come to our world because they only live in their world and they don't notice our wishes&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Cool&quot; said Sara<br />
&quot;yeah, now lets do our staff room&quot; I said<br />
&quot;But where shall we do it?&quot; asked Amanda<br />
&quot;How about our form room?&quot; I surgested<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; my friends replied<br />
&quot;I wish we were in our form room, in this world&quot; I said and then we appeared in our form room.<br />
&quot;It's a bit small though to be our place?&quot; said Chris<br />
&quot;Yeah maybe your right, but I have a idea&quot; I said as I walked out of the classroom.<br />
I walked down the corridor just a bit till we came to a row of lockers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to make 1 of the lockers a doorway&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Cool&quot; said Chris<br />
&quot;I wish the locker infront of me would turn into a doorway to our new staff room area and that it would not turn into a doorway unless you said Alshalvoc&quot; I said<br />
<br />
The wish came into effect, I knew this because I could see what looked like glitter go through the air and then land on the locker.<br />
&quot;Alshalvoc&quot; I said and then the locker changed colour, it looked like a projector image where it was.<br />
<br />
I then walked thorugh the Image of the locker and I came out into a large openning which looked like a field of grass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here is our staff room&quot; I said to my friends who had just came through.<br />
&quot;Won't the NPC's come through?&quot; asked Chris<br />
&quot;Oh they won't because I wished them not to even notice it&quot; I said<br />
&quot;okay&quot; replied Chris<br />
&quot;It's just a field though&quot; said Sara<br />
&quot;Yes I know, we can use the land to build on&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Ohhh&quot; replied Sara<br />
&quot;I wish that a building would appear infront of us and a path to the locker entrance will appear&quot; said Amanda<br />
A building appeared right after Amanda made her wish along with a path which lead to the locker entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the locker?&quot; asked Sara<br />
&quot;Oh it will turn back into a locker after a minute and NPC's won't even notice it or even use it&quot; I said<br />
&quot;Ah okay&quot; said Sara<br />
&quot;Lets do the inside&quot; said Amanda<br />
&quot;Ladies first&quot; replied Chris<br />
Sara just giggles to Chris's joke and then walks down the path towards the building.<br />
<br />
When we got inside the building, it was very basic.<br />
White walls and floor so we made some wishes to decorate it.<br />
When we had finished we all had our own orfices and a small jail cell which I wished that my friends could jail people who stop other people from enjoying them selfs.<br />
<br />
When I walked outside to look at the building It looked fantastic!<br />
It was more than a staff room, It was a staff center!<br />
To end the excitment I wished my friends would have their own private area like mine as well and then I told them about it and how to keep it secret from other people.<br />
<br />
Once my friends private area's were complete, we started to explore the new world of ChavAra and we started talking to the new people.<br />
And in the morning we could wake up nice and refreshed and tell somebody about our my new world!</p>
