<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John rolled down the car window as the jogger approached his car.  <br />
&quot;Did you need something?&quot; John asked.<br />
<br />
The man got a sheepish look on his face and scratched the back of his <br />
head.  &quot;Uh, I hadn’t seen you in the neighborhood before, and wanted <br />
to introduce myself.  God!  This must sound really strange, especially <br />
this early in the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
John replied with a cheerful grin, &quot;Not so strange.  We have never <br />
crossed paths before, because I don’t usually get up this early.&quot;  He <br />
stuck his hand out the window, &quot;I’m John by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
The jogger accepted the handshake, and with a toothy smile introduces <br />
himself, &quot;Nice to meet you, John.  My name is Lionel, but friends call <br />
me Leo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leo was still winded, and his face was shadowed by the hooded <br />
sweatshirt.  These two factors were giving John a hard time in reading <br />
Leo’s body language to determine if Leo was being affected by the <br />
Alpha scent or was just one of those rare ‘I met him in line at the <br />
grocery store and we’ve been dating ever since’ encounters.  Either <br />
way John would be happy, but he really preferred Leo would turn out to <br />
be one of the former.  &quot;So, Leo, do you run every morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
Totally ignoring John’s question, Leo blurted out, &quot;Would you like to <br />
hang out some time?&quot;  Feeling really embarrassed about his outburst, <br />
Leo rambled on, &quot;I, uh, don’t mean to be bold and … you seem like a <br />
really nice good looking guy …wait … I don’t think you’re gay … no <br />
what I meant to say is that I’m not gay,  but…&quot;<br />
<br />
Bemused, John stopped Leo’s muttering, &quot;Leo, I’m in apartment 2701.  <br />
Come by for breakfast in a little bit after I have done my shopping <br />
and you have finished your run.&quot;  John then started his car and drove <br />
away, leaving a befuddled but excited Leo waving on the sidewalk.  <br />
&quot;The former, definitely the former,&quot; John thought merrily.<br />
<br />
A short time later Leo found himself sitting on the steps in front of <br />
apartment 2701.  He had tried to go finish his run, but every time Leo <br />
approached the corner he got really anxious and turned back.  He was <br />
afraid that he would be late and miss valuable time he could spend <br />
with John, or even worse yet, he would miss John in passing and the <br />
whole opportunity would be gone.  Leo was a little perplexed as to why <br />
John suddenly mattered so much; he had only just met John and talk to <br />
him for literally two minutes.  However, John had admirably been so <br />
confident and commanding, and John was expecting Leo.  Leo didn’t want <br />
to let John down.  Leo’s train of thought was interrupted when he <br />
spied John coming up the path with three large brown paper bags of <br />
groceries.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, John!&quot; Leo exclaimed. &quot;Here, let me help you with those.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Leo. Give me a second to put my cats in the bedroom and I <br />
will be right back. Wait right here,&quot; said John as he ducked inside.<br />
<br />
Pacing anxiously on the front porch with the groceries, Leo muttered <br />
to himself, &quot;Just relax man. God, why am I acting so goofy? I am way <br />
too eager. Just relax. Play it cool man.&quot; Startled by a loud thud from <br />
inside, he peaked his head in careful not to open the door too wide <br />
lest he let the cats out. &quot;You okay in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
From down the hall, John called, &quot;Yeah, everything is okay. Can you <br />
put the groceries in the kitchen and have a seat on the couch? I’ll be <br />
just one more minute.&quot; Having settled Hugo and Alex in the bedroom, <br />
John emerged into the living room with a backpack to find Leo <br />
nervously sitting on the couch as instructed.<br />
<br />
Taking a seat next to Leo, John unzipped his backpack allowing easy <br />
access to the sub vials and set it to the side.  Obviously made tense <br />
by John’s close proximity, Leo confessed in a hushed tone, &quot;John, I <br />
haven’t ever done anything with a guy before.  Not that I have a <br />
problem with it.  I have been a curious about what it would be like.  <br />
I just can’t believe that I am here with you.  No offense, but I never <br />
expected my…&quot; Leo glanced down trying to find the right word, <br />
&quot;experience with another man to be with a stranger. I kind of expected <br />
to do this with one of my frat college buddies when drunk. Oh my God. <br />
Why did I just tell you that? I’m sorry. I don’t even know why you <br />
invited me in, and here I am soliciting you for sex. I guess what I am <br />
trying to say is how your confidence, commanding presence, and musky <br />
scent is so fucking attractive without admitting that I really am <br />
attracted to another guy while sober.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leo looked like he was going to continue on, but John placed his hand <br />
on Leo’s inner thigh interjecting, &quot;Shh …just follow my lead.&quot;  <br />
Finally getting to have some fun with one of his recruits before their <br />
transformation, John started stroking Leo’s thigh with the one hand, <br />
while reaching up and brushing back the hood on Leo’s sweatshirt <br />
revealing close cropped curly hair. Leo’s gaze, now unobstructed, <br />
became transfixed upon John’s countenance.  John leaned forward and <br />
began passionately French kissing Leo, who in turn longingly followed <br />
John’s lead. It felt so good for Leo to submit to John’s desires.  <br />
Besides it brought Leo closer to the source of John’s intoxicating <br />
Alpha scent.<br />
<br />
After several minutes time, John pulled away gently to catch his <br />
breath and stared into Leo’s green eyes. &quot;How was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leo sheepishly averted his eyes, responding softly, &quot;Wonderful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to experience more?&quot; John asked coyly.<br />
<br />
Almost inaudibly Leo begged, &quot;Yes…please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly and deliberately John stripped Leo of his garments, marveling <br />
the reveal of every bulging curve and rippling striation of muscle. <br />
Moving to the floor, John put the ebony athlete on his back, calling <br />
attention to Leo’s erect enthusiasm. John rubbed his across the <br />
backside of the prone man. With a gasp from Leo, John assertively <br />
pushed his way inside, and repeatedly thrust in with deep meaningful <br />
strokes. <br />
<br />
After a short while a disconcerted John realized the sex wasn’t <br />
completely satisfying. For the old John getting in bed with a man like <br />
Leo would have been amazing, but now something felt incomplete. Leo <br />
was most certainly attractive and the sex was good, but John wanted <br />
more from his partner. He wanted a beast of a man to ravage. It got <br />
him thinking that perhaps the Alpha spray wasn’t simply a pheromone to <br />
keep his betas in check, and that it was starting to have an effect on <br />
him as well.<br />
<br />
John’s attention focused back on the undulating muscle jock when Leo’s <br />
volcano erupted white hot lava across his rocky abdomen, reminding <br />
John how urgent his needs were becoming as he reached for one of the <br />
sub vials in the nearby backpack. &quot;Close your eyes and keep your mouth <br />
open. Papa’s going to feed you your breakfast.&quot; Repositioning himself <br />
near Leo’s face, John released himself into the compliant visage, <br />
quickly following his seed with the contents of the vial. Leo eagerly <br />
consumed.</p>
