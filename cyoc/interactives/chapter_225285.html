<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the last minute Miles chickened out of checking out a dating site on his phone. It was one thing to have sex with himself in James body but another to have sex with a completely different man. Besides he could hardly see himself topping anyone in this body… but then again why would he?<br />
<br />
Miles shook his head. He had to control himself. Although this body was the perfect bottom he couldn’t just go and hook up with anyone. Besides he had to focus on finding the mole leaking his company’s information.<br />
<br />
After work ended, Miles took the bus back to James apartment. Miles missed having his nice car to drive him anywhere he wanted but at least James apartment was close to the office. Riding the elevator to James apartment, Miles was met with the disappointing apartment he had become accustomed to. It was quite small and dirty. It also paled in comparison to his own mansion but it was adequate enough to stay in for the time being.<br />
<br />
Dropping his stuff on in James bedroom, Miles ordered takeout again since he had close to zero experience with cooking. While eating dinner, Miles thoughts kept creeping back to dating sites. He pushed the thoughts away but there were still in the back of his mind. As he was preparing to take a shower, he noticed a message arrive on his phone from Grindr.<br />
<br />
It was from Vince. Miles imagined himself meeting up with Vince and having him fuck his brains out in this body before becoming a bit disgusted at the thought. Dismissing the message, he realized that if he received the message on his own phone he must’ve have also received it on his work phone. After all, Miles considered sex important enough to have Grindr on both phones as to never miss a message.<br />
<br />
He assumed James probably also received it but didn’t care. After all, it’s not like James would meet up with Vince and fuck him silly. Already on the Grindr app, Miles felt a bit more tempted than normal and logged himself out of his account. Then he decided to make a new one.<br />
<br />
Quickly filling out the details and making up information when needed, Miles soon had a new Grindr account. Chuckling at his username: Shamrock, Miles tried to decide what photo he should use for the profile picture. Since he was currently only wrapped in a towel, Miles thought it was the perfect time to take a few salacious photos for his new account.<br />
<br />
Using the bedroom mirror, Miles made sure to take a few good photos of James best attributes: his bubble butt and toned twink body. Miles also took a few dick pics but he hardly found them necessary. Just as Miles was about to post the pictures, reason got the better of him. “What am I doing?” He asked aloud. He closed the app and shuddered. “I need to shower.”<br />
<br />
Showering as James was a lot easier than his old body. The lack of a beard and most body hair meant that his showers were a lot faster than he was used to. Finishing up, Miles felt grateful for how easy it was to maintain this twink body and dried off.<br />
<br />
Rummaging through James’ dresser, Miles found the usual briefs and put a pair on before putting on a pair of pajamas. As he laid in the poor excuse of a bed, Miles realized he should probably check up on James. Tomorrow was his first day back at the office… as him.<br />
<br />
Calling James phone, Miles was surprised to get no response. Assuming he probably had a work related matter, Miles gave him an hour before calling again. When he didn’t receive a response again, Miles began to grow worried. “Maybe he’s just taking a shower?” Miles thought as he waited another hour before calling once more. After James still hadn’t answered, Miles felt a bit panicked.<br />
<br />
“What could he possibly be doing right now?” Miles thought as he continuously kept calling James. It was by the eighth call that James finally picked up.<br />
<br />
“H-hello… Sir? I mean… James.” A frazzled deep voice responded. Miles breathed a sigh of relief before becoming slightly suspicious.<br />
<br />
“James what were you doing? I’ve been trying to contact you for over an hour.” Miles said annoyed.<br />
<br />
“Sorry. I got a work call and then had to deal with… someone before taking a shower.” James explained. Miles thought it was a bit strange how James acted but decided he would let it slide since he couldn’t imagine James capable of doing anything bad. After all, Miles highly trusted James otherwise he wouldn’t had agreed to swap with him.<br />
<br />
“Listen I just wanted to check up on you before you head back to the office tomorrow. Since it’s your first day there as me, call me immediately to my office in the morning. We can meet and talk a bit before work starts.” Miles said.<br />
<br />
James felt a bit relieved knowing Miles would meet up with him before starting his big day tomorrow. “Really? That sound great! I would really appreciate it.”<br />
<br />
After they both agreed to meet up, Miles ended the call. He hoped that James wouldn’t mess this up. Settling into his bed, Miles fell asleep, ready for the day that lied ahead.</p>
