<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You felt yourself blush heavily as you looked to Luna, as it was something that was going to be a bit embarrassing, or at least you thought it would be embarrassing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... since we are MILF-wolves... would we... do we still go into heat?&quot; you asked, &quot;like a mundane female werewolf would?&quot;<br />
<br />
That was something that related what was known with female werewolves. It was something that was largely determined after more was known about werewolves scientifically and the were virus that spread it and as medical science also began to better understand things like hormones and everything else. Female werewolves had a sort of reproductive cycle that seemed to cross between humans and wolves. Like wolves, a female werewolf would have a heat cycle that would require sexual stimulation to ovulate. However, like humans, this cycle was once a month and was found to often linked to the full moon. You&#39;d seen some of the articles that discussed this while trying to find more information on MILF-wolves over the years, often because you were looking for ways to become female and those articles on how female werewolves reproduced was simply something that came up as a link but didn&#39;t necessarily discuss MILF-wolves. <br />
<br />
Over time, you guessed that some of this was due to MILF-wolves being rather new and thus all the data wasn&#39;t found yet. However, certain things had changed since then. You&#39;d found that Luna had been born a MILF-wolf and she gave you the chance to be female and be in your right gender and that further changed things. As a MILF-wolf now, you also had some more immediate concerns on some of these issues. After all, as a woman, would you now have to worry about all the sorts of things that often counted as women&#39;s health issues. That was part of the thing that made you a bit nervous and embarrassed in that you had long felt you were a woman and now as one knew you weren&#39;t fully aware on what it was really like to be female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I suppose it&#39;s time we had the talk,&quot; Luna gave a chuckle and ran one hand along your check, and by your sense of smell you could tell it wasn&#39;t the same hand she&#39;d been stimulating you with earlier, &quot;particularly since the version I&#39;m sure your dad gave you was more what was to be expected from a young man...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... you&#39;ll grow more body hair and women won&#39;t be &quot;icky&quot; anymore,&quot; you replied, &quot;also with the rule of treating women right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that first part is still true when taking all werewolves, we will have more &quot;body hair&quot; when transformed,&quot; Luna laughed, &quot;and treating women right is probably more a moral lesson than a growing up lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yeah,&quot; you managed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I can help with that,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;as I suppose it&#39;d be better coming from me than my folks. But... yes, we can and will go into heat, just like a mundane female werewolf will. Or at least with regard to you and me, specifically. It&#39;s like where I pointed out to you on how I could get pregnant when we first had sex... to turn you from Nick to Nicki and so that I could have YOUR child... OUR daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d thought you meant that your &quot;cycle&quot; just happened to be on that night,&quot; you said weekly, the redness in your checks remaining and essentially hiding your private relief that your breasts weren&#39;t feeling as milk heavy as they were a few moments before, &quot;thus... it was sort of the last thing before you became a MILF-wolf...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, my transformation triggered my first heat cycle,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;the MILF-wolf transformation merely gave me the form of a woman in her thirties or forties. It didn&#39;t actually change many of the hormonal patterns that related to being eighteen. Thus, I look much older than I am chronologically and hormonally. And to a degree... the same goes for you. In becoming a MILF-wolf, you gained the body and look of a woman in her thirties or forties... though, I&#39;m thinking mid-thirties... but hormonally speaking, you are like me. Eighteen. It&#39;s where in part... the MILF-wolf&#39;s instinct to become and be a mother will probably be stronger for us, and in a way may be why my dad may be a bit more desperate to find a male werewolf to become a mother as well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Desperate?&quot; you wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s something that relates to some of the oddities that go with the MILF-wolf transformation and something the doctors found with both my mom and dad when it was found my mom didn&#39;t become a normal werewolf,&quot; Luna said slowly, &quot;and it&#39;s an odd thing, given that those that are younger will be aged forward in appearance and those older will be aged back in appearance. It&#39;s actually something they tested with blood samples and then when one of the scientists, and older woman tested things further and became a MILF-wolf as well. Mom told me what they found was that our age on the outside is merely that. How we look. It does not affect all that much on who we are on the inside. Do you remember the news report on Yvonne Andrews from a few years ago?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vaguely,&quot; you answered, thinking there were some reports that she was a MILF-wolf that had died of what was reported to be &quot;old age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was the female scientist who turned herself into a MILF-wolf to see on those sorts of aging effects and it was her tests that confirmed a lot of this,&quot; Luna explained, &quot;on the outside she looked like she was in her forties again and did gain great strength... BUT her tests found that hormonally she was still about eighty-nine. Had gone through menopause and everything. And ultimately meant that some bad habits from before she became a MILF-wolf then contributed to her dying of old age and remained reproductively barren...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But your mom and us are different?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;At the time, my mom and my dad were different as they were still young enough that technically they could still conceive if they wanted to,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;and their hormonal patterns reflected that. But they agreed not to get pregnant again while they were raising me and figuring out just how things related to being MILF-wolves. It was all figuring out what they were, and they didn&#39;t want to add to the stresses they had at the time. My mom, I think is ultimately still fine with that as she did give birth to me and will be forever happy to be my mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Roxie?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She likes being my dad,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;but as a MILF-wolf, she does want to be a mom, too... but now... now that I&#39;m eighteen, Roxie is also getting to the point where most women would actually begin to hit menopause. In theory she&#39;s still young enough to conceive... but that window is closing for her. Meanwhile, WE are hormonally still eighteen, even if we look older. And in that... just like any mundane female werewolf, we will be in &quot;season&quot; every full moon. Though... with my pregnancy, I won&#39;t be feeling those effects until after our daughter is born.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;d mean... that if we have sex...&quot; you began.<br />
<br />
&quot;That you&#39;ll have a period later?&quot; Luna chuckled, &quot;Yes. Sex between you and me could trigger you to ovulate, which could then lead to you having a period sometime after this month&#39;s full moon cycle, for as a female, I cannot get you pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joy,&quot; you said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you wanted to be a woman,&quot; Luna reminded you, &quot;this comes with all of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as you&#39;re there with me... I won&#39;t mind,&quot; you managed and then rubbed the back of your head for a moment, &quot;I&#39;m turning into such a sap...&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna leaned forward and gave you a soft kiss on the check, &quot;no, you&#39;re in love and happy. And that makes me happy. Because I feel the same way...&quot;<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t help but smile back to Luna.</p>
