<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Colin scanned the street, wondering which random person around him the genie&#39;s wish would fulfil. There was a young mother with two children across the street, and an elderly man on a bench, waiting for the bus. &quot;I wonder what kind of fantasy he might have,&quot; Colin wondered. As his gaze lingered, he was suddenly bumped from the side. He heard the slick scattering noise of magazine-like books falling to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Sorry. I wasn&#39;t... watching...&quot; came the meek voice to his left. He turned to see a rail-thin young man, maybe 25, maybe five and half feet tall, with mousy brown hair, crouching down to collect his dropped items. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s okay... I wasn&#39;t really paying much attention either. I was just...&quot; Colin thought better about mentioning the genie he&#39;d been talking to; besides, she seemed to have disappeared. &quot;Let me give you a hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin dropped to one knee and began gathering the scattered magazines. Not magazines at all, Colin quickly realized. Comic books.<br />
<br />
He recognized some of the titles from when he was a kid. There was SuperSoldier, Transforma, and Inferno: all classic characters... But as Colin gathered the pile he saw that one character was much more heavily-represented than the others. Clad in a golden yellow full-body suit with red gloves, boots and trunks, power-posing on cover after cover against backdrops of lightning and exploding debris was Epic, the undisputed flagship hero of POW! Comics.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s all of them,&quot; Colin said, offering the stack to the young man. He smiled. &quot;I loved Epic when I was a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. He&#39;s.... incredible...&quot; The young man stood. “I’m Dan.” For the first time he made eye contact with Colin. He reached for the stack of comics, and as he took them his eyes widened just a little bit. He stopped completely, and Colin thought he saw something spark in his gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... you look…” he said.<br />
<br />
Colin was suddenly robbed off all air, like he’d gotten a smack to his solar plexus. He found himself winded and unable to move. He wanted to say &quot;I look like what?&quot; but he was rooted to the ground. A sense of panic began to build inside him as he realized he was unable to speak. The paralysis was deep, and a voice in the back of his head began to echo ‘breathe you need to breathe Colin breathe you need to breathe Colin you need...’<br />
<br />
“…you could be…” Dan murmured.<br />
<br />
Like a spent swimmer fighting to stay above water, Colin felt his impulse to breathe grow even stronger. ‘You need to breathe gotta breathe can’t breathe’, pleaded the voice in his head. What the hell was happening? Every signal his brain was sending to his body was ignored, leaving Colin frozen and statue-like in front of Dan. The looping voice in his head was slowly being drowned out by the bass-drum thunder of his own heartbeat, reverberating off his locked joints and echoing through impossibly-stiffened tissue. Colin’s field of vision began to narrow as the lack of oxygen began to affect his other senses. As if in response the panicked keening of his internal voice redoubled: ‘breatheColinyougottabreatheColinbreatheYOUGOTTABREATHE—‘<br />
<br />
“…Epic!” Dan exhaled.<br />
<br />
The utterance of the golden superhero’s name triggered an eery silence in Colin’s head. For just a moment, the cacophony of his heartbeat and inner voice dropped away. In this moment, his focus drifted once more to his narrowing field of vision. It continued to dim until darkness joined the silence that had already engulfed him. He still wasn’t breathing, but the panic had left him completely. It was as if he were floating in a void, ignorant of where he ended and the deep blackness began.<br />
<br />
Sound and light came back with a massive intake of breath. The genie’s voice echoed in his head: “...everyone’s sexual fantasy...” Immense relief ran through Colin&#39;s body like water as air poured past his lips and down into his chest. His whole body expanded with the intake, reveling in the sensation of energy it brought.<br />
<br />
Colin suddenly realized he could move again, but still felt constrained somehow. It was not unpleasant: more like a full-body hug than the painful, breathless paralysis he had already endured. He looked down at his arms and instantly realized why. His casual clothes were gone. On his hands were close-fitting, red leather gauntlets, terminating at a thin forearm wrapped in skin-tight, golden yellow fabric. The cloth covered his arms, wrapped his shoulders, and spread across his chest and torso. A slight shimmer in the material highlighted his skinny-fat belly before plunging into a pair of crimson trunks that highlighted Colin&#39;s modest package. The bright yellow spandex extended down his wire-thin legs to a pair of red boots that matched the gauntlets.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to my clothes....? And why do I look like....?&quot; Colin&#39;s sense of awareness expanded once more to the street around him, and he realized he was out in the open. He was in public, wearing tights and trunks like some kind of wannabe comic-con superhero... without the body to pull off the look.  He flushed, suddenly self-conscious, and reached up to shield his face.  His hands come into contact with something there; he probed it with his gloves and realized he was wearing a domino-style mask that covered his eyes, just like &quot;....Epic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin should have felt embarrassed for being caught out in public, sheathed head to toe in golden spandex… but the mask somehow made him feel anonymous. A voice came from in front of him again, commanding his attention.<br />
<br />
“I knew it,” Dan said. “I knew you were him.”<br />
<br />
“No, I’m not….” Colin started. “It’s just…”.  Then he remembered the genie. “…unless… you have a thing for... superheroes….?”<br />
<br />
Dan broke eye contact with Colin.  It was all Colin needed for confirmation. He looked at the Epic comics clutched in Dan’s hands. He had to admit that the hero had appeal, especially as drawn on paper: muscles and raw power undulating under a slick second skin; immeasurable strength and abilities beyond the reach of any mere mortal. And here he stood, clad in a perfect Epic costume. Even though he looked nothing like the inhuman figure from the comic books, Colin was aroused by the idea of being seen that way. Maybe the genie’s wish/curse wasn’t so bad? He could be a superhero for Dan, couldn’t he?<br />
<br />
Colin’s cock suddenly throbbed in agreement, testing the stretch of the tights and trunks serving as its prison. The feeling of the fabric excited Colin a little bit more, and his cock throbbed again. And again. And again. Each pulse was more pleasant than the last. Colin looked down and noticed that his package was bulging bigger than he’d ever remembered. It throbbed again, and Colin saw why: his cock and testicles were getting bigger with every pulse. With the realization, the intensity of the throbbing redoubled. Colin watched, slack-jawed, as his member grew thicker and longer.  It emerged from the bottom of the scarlet trunks and began inching down Colin’s right thigh, gliding beneath the shimmering fabric that hugged it to his body. Beneath the obscene bulge of the shaft, Colin’s balls had expanded to four or five times their normal size, stretching the trunks to comical proportions.<br />
<br />
No, thought Colin.  _Comic_ proportions. _Superhero_ proportions.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God…!” Dan exclaimed, dropping to his knees. He was staring slack-jawed at Colin’s now-Epic genitalia, his face awash in awe and lust.<br />
<br />
Colin couldn’t believe this was happening, but he was loving every second of it. If living out everyone’s sexual fantasy was going to be like this, he was the luckiest man alive. Since he was in the costume, he might as well play the role, right? What would a powerful superhero with an Epic cock do in a situation like this, a fervent fan on his knees before him?<br />
<br />
Colin smiled. “Why don’t you have a taste?” he said. His voice rang out with a weight and richness he didn’t recognize.<br />
<br />
As if mesmerized, Dan slowly nodded and leaned forward, once again dropping the comic books he had earlier been so worried about. He craned down toward the head of Colin’s Epic cock, which was valiantly lengthening toward his knee. As he got closer, Colin could feel Dan’s breath through the fabric of his tights, and the sensation ran like electricity over the surface of his body. The anticipation was exquisite, and Colin throbbed again, pulsing just a bit larger. Then Dan’s mouth connected with the lycra-wrapped shaft and everything changed again.<br />
<br />
The next throb extended far beyond the root of Colin’s cock, filling his entire body with pleasure. He gasped involuntarily, caught up in the pleasurable feeling of Dan’s mouth straining unsuccessfully to envelop the inhuman girth before him. He throbbed again, and the sensation crashed over him like a wave; a full-body pulse that cascaded from his core out to the futhermost reaches of his hands and feet. As if in response to the prompt, Dan’s tongue reached out and stroked the spandex that guarded his prize. Colin gasped, tensed, and throbbed again. He stood a little taller, he thought; a little more proudly. Another pulse washed through him and Colin pulled his shoulders back, displaying his chest.<br />
<br />
‘Wait a sec… chest….? I don’t have a…..’<br />
<br />
Colin gazed down in time for another wave to wash over him, and saw his chest pulse a little bigger. A mere second later he throbbed again. Beneath the confines of his yellow body suit his chest was inching bigger, wider and thicker. The next pulse made it clear, though, that this growth wasn’t localized — in his peripheral vision he caught sight of his shoulders becoming more full and round as the wave of energy passed over them. It washed down into his arms and he saw his biceps and triceps assert themselves, followed by his forearms. He couldn’t see his legs over his expanding chest, but he knew the wave was being felt there too: quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings and calves picked up the rhythm, eager to join in the celebration of pleasure that was echoing through every inch of Colin’s body. Dan had ceased trying to fit Epic’s shaft into his mouth and had begun slurping and licking its length with increased intensity. The waves of ecstasy washing over Colin increased to match. He throbbed and felt himself grow a little taller. He throbbed again and felt cobblestones in his midsection press against spandex. Throb. The spandex clung ever-tighter to a narrowing waist, pouring over the curve of an Adonis belt that plunged into the red trunks. Throb. Deep recesses appeared between his biceps and triceps as they swelled bigger beneath lean skin and unforgiving Lycra. Throb. Mounds of ass muscle pulled the back of his trunks taut as quadriceps separated and fought for purchase in the golden tights. Throb. Colin adjusted his stance and flexed slightly so he could feel the detail of every pulse as it echoed through him. The pulses were coming faster but his body was also larger, extended the wash of pleasure each pulse brought.  He felt his traps rise to frame a thick column of neck muscle. He felt his shoulders separate into high-relief striations of power, veins snaking from his pectorals down into his biceps and forearms. He felt himself grow taller, stretching the bodysuit from top to bottom even as granite hamstrings and and the ham-like heads of separated calf muscles stretched the suit from side to side, front to back.<br />
<br />
Colin glanced at the cover of the comic on the ground, and then at his own throbbing body. If he didn’t know any better, he was getting even bigger than his comic-book counterpart. As wave after wave crashed over him, his sense of strength, of power, of absolute alpha-ness increased geometrically. At his midsection, Dan stopped worshipping Epic’s cock through his golden tights, and reached up to the sides of his crimson trunks. He worked them down over the muscular shelf of his favourite hero’s ass, and coaxed them over the still-expanding expanses of corded quadriceps. Locating an opening in the otherwise seamless bodysuit, Dan stretched it wide, downwards, and nudged his prize from its spandex prison.  Colin embraced his newfound power. As Epic, he slowly raised his arms, marvelling as striated pectoral and shoulder muscles danced in support, and flexed. HIs biceps leapt into relief against massive triceps and bulging shoulder muscles as beast-like lats asserted themselves, forging Epic’s upper body into a perfect inverted triangle of power. His cock surged hungrily forward, as if prompting Dan.<br />
<br />
“Worship your hero,” Epic breathed. He widened his stance, feeling his glutes tense. Every head of Epic’s quadriceps muscles floated into relief, veins and tendons snaking languidly beneath his tights. His lower body was a pillar of power, serving as a trophy-mount for his massive cock. As if under Epic’s direct command, Dan slackened his jaw as much as he could, and took the tip of of the shaft into his mouth.<br />
<br />
Epic threw his head back as another round of pleasurable waves ran through him. His skin tingled, and he became aware of the inhuman fullness of his new body as the genie’s alchemy made one final push. His golden uniform shrink-wrapped every massive muscular fibre. He could feel his skin becoming impenetrable. Sounds from hundreds of meters away began to impinge on his unconscious. The power to crumple steel and tear concrete like paper felt infused into his tissue. He became aware of his own incredible heft, and knew he could control it; with a mere thought he became weightless and began to lift off the ground, causing Dan to rise from his knees in order to keep worshipping Epic’s engorged member.<br />
<br />
Epic raised his head and surveyed his body, placing his fists on his hips as he took in his own magnificent presence. His body was massive, beyond perfect, and his golden spandex suit seemed to glow with its own internal light. He smiled at Dan, whose merely-human physiology was simply incapable of swallowing more than a third of his cock.<br />
<br />
“There’s a good boy,” Epic said. “You definitely know how to make a hero feel good.”<br />
<br />
Dan pulled back and stared, adoringly, at his fantasy-made-flesh. “Thank you, Epic.” He stood, leaned forward, and placed both hands on Epic’s chest. The flesh was unmovable, like warm titanium sheathed in silk. “Come back down to Earth, please…. sir….”<br />
<br />
Epic relaxed, felt his own mammoth weight return, and settled back on the ground. On the same level, Dan’s head barely came to the top of Epic’s chest.  The hero had to be at least six and a half feet tall, probably weighing in the low 400s.<br />
<br />
Epic’s smile broadened as he continued to look at Dan. “This may be your fantasy, Dan, but it’s a dream come true for me, too. I feel like a fucking god.”<br />
<br />
Dan’s gaze locked with Epic’s as his hands roamed Epic’s chest, tracing the lower reaches of his pectoral muscles and exploring the thunderheads of abdominals beneath. “Yeah? It must be incredible to have… so much power. And that body…”<br />
<br />
“All yours to enjoy,” Epic added. He knew he was standing out in the open, trunks down, with his erect cock throbbing for everyone to see… but it didn’t matter. What could anybody do about it, anyway? Epic was unstoppable, and who knew what the limits of his power were?<br />
<br />
“I think we should take this body for a spin, don’t you? Why don’t I wrap you in these arms, fly you home, and then… see what we can get up to in private? We can make this fantasy last as long as you’d like.” He smirked, flashing perfect teeth.<br />
<br />
“My fantasy….” Dan trailed off.  He paused for just a moment. “Yeah. About that.”<br />
<br />
Dan pulled his hands away from Epic’s body, and reached around to his back pocket. He retrieved something and held it out.<br />
<br />
Epic doubled over, suddenly weak. It was like all the warmth and power he’d been filled with was suddenly snuffed out. Surprised, he looked at Dan’s outstretched hand and saw a glowing rock. His expression shifted from surprise to puzzlement as he dropped to one knee, drained of the strength he needed to support his own weight.<br />
<br />
“This,” continued Dan, “is Miniskite. The only mineral on Earth that can sap your power.”<br />
<br />
Epic collapsed to the ground, betrayed by his gargantuan muscle and size. He was the most muscular, magnificent being ever to walk the Earth, surely, and he now felt like he couldn’t even lift a finger.<br />
<br />
“What…. Why did you….?” Epic’s pleading eyes locked with Dan’s once more.<br />
<br />
“Because, Epic,” Dan kneeled in front his hero, holding the Miniskite rock close to Epic’s useless, hulking body. “My fantasy isn’t to have sex with a superhero. It’s to dominate him completely.”</p>
