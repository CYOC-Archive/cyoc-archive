<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul hung his head as Rachael raced away in her little hatchback. Why did the hot ones always have to be crazy?<br />
<br />
As Paul headed back to the farmhouse he felt very confused. Had he really turned into a horse-person, or was Rachael just a lunatic? He kept thinking about it over and over as he drove back to the farm house. It couldn&#39;t have been real, could it? The odds of two people having the same hallucination were pretty low. Maybe he did become part horse?<br />
<br />
Paul concentrated for a second to see if anything felt out of place. &quot;hmm, nope... just regular old human me. I just need a beer.&quot; Paul said, out loud to himself. &quot;I&#39;m probably just exhausted and dehydrated from last night. I should go out tonight and try to relax.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul arrived at the farmhouse and walked inside. Unfortunately, before he could start planning his evening, Paul had a laundry list of chores he had to get done on the farm. There were cows to milk, horses to feed, goats to check on, kennels to clean, gardens to weed, fields to water, fences to mend, and the donkey needed to be stabled. He also had chores in the woods too. He had to cut logs and bring in fire wood, as well as collect honey from the farm&#39;s bee hive. At least he had the barnyard cats to keep him company. It was going to be a long day.<br />
<br />
Paul sighed as he started making his rounds across the farm. He couldn&#39;t wait for the day when he had enough money to buy a farm of his own, but for now this is what paid the bills. Paul was a friend of the family that owned this farm and he acted as a hired hand. Normally, he would only be responsible for a small portion of the daily tasks, but the farmer was on vacation and Paul had agreed to fill in. The farmer had promised to compensate Paul generously for the favor, but it really was a lot to do.<br />
<br />
As Paul worked around the farm, he eventually reached the barnyard. The horses seemed to be even more relaxed than normal, and Paul noticed that he could smell each horses individual scent. Paul lead them out to pasture before cleaning out each of their stalls. The pungent coarse air that lingered in the stalls seemed to be more intense than normal, and Paul began to feel warm. He felt strange, almost like his pants were getting smaller, or maybe just tighter. The firm strong hands of the farmhand felt cramped too. Paul quickly finished his work in the stuffy stalls and stumbled out of the barn on numb feet.<br />
<br />
Paul looked down and saw his pants straining to contain a truly massive bulge. That couldn&#39;t be his dick, could it? All his other cares temporarily forgotten, Paul ran around the barn to the cow pasture trying to ensure he was hidden from the road. Once there he kicked off his pants.<br />
<br />
His dick was huge, easily comparable to his forearm. It stood partially erect, throbbing with need as Paul&#39;s body continued to react to the musk from the stables. He began to stroke his girthy length and sensations hit him like a ton of bricks. The pleasure was so immediate and intense, Paul didn&#39;t even notice the other changes his body was going through. His shirt ripped apart as his shoulders broadened; thick cords of muscle and sinew expanded over his lengthening bones; and short, thick, fur began growing all over his body. The light cream colored hair spread over his body as he pumped his cock with abandon. Paul&#39;s feet formed into hooves just as his legs reshaped into the hind legs of a stallion. Now noticing, but not giving a damn, his transformation pressed on. Paul squeezed his eyes tight. A majestic mane filled out from from the back of his head to between his shoulder blades. It tossed around in a small gust of wind and Paul grimaced as his face pushed out. His new tail extended from just above his backside and long coarse hairs tickled the backs of his knees. Sensing he was about to cum, Paul let out a full throated neigh as he shot out torrent after torrent of cum.<br />
<br />
Paul leaned against a fence post in euphoric exhaustion. He looked down at his body. Maybe Rachael isn&#39;t so crazy after all?<br />
<br />
While he stood there recovering, Paul noticed the cows returning from the far pasture. They made their way across the field in short order and soon began to notice the giant horse-man standing in their pasture. Thinking that Paul was a threat, one of the bovines charged him. Before he had time to react, the cow bit Paul and threw him to the ground. Even with his enhanced strength and stature, he wasn&#39;t quick enough to avoid the cow&#39;s oncoming assault. Paul yelped in pain as the cow thrust it&#39;s sharp horns into Paul&#39;s flank. Paul&#39;s blood sprayed across a nearby feed bale and onto the grass. He quickly put space between him and the angry cows. Paul did his best to show the cows he wasn&#39;t a threat and eventually they seemed to back down. Paul watched as one by one they returned to relaxed states. Before long, they were calm again, but what Paul didn&#39;t notice was that they were all eating from the hay that had been splattered in his blood.<br />
<br />
Paul looked down at his arm and assessed the damage. To his great surprise, despite being mauled by a 1,600 pound cow, he wasn&#39;t doing to bad. He was a little bruised from where he had been tossed to the ground but as he inspected himself he saw that his bite and stab wound was quickly closing up. He watched as slowly but surely the bloody injuries pulled themselves closed and disappeared. Soon, the only evidence was a light scar and even that was mostly hidden by fur.<br />
<br />
Now fully aware of his changes Paul held his hands in front of his face and inspected his muscular body. He was in disbelief. That girl, Rachael, had somehow turned him into a freak! He was part horse now, or at least some kind of shapeshifter. This did explain his &quot;hallucinatory&quot; sex the night before, and why the horses had been so relaxed earlier. &quot;Oh fuck.&quot; Paul said to himself. &quot;I&#39;m a horse! ...or at least part horse.&quot; Paul just stood stunned, trying to figure out what he could do.<br />
<br />
He could go see his doctor, but then he&#39;d risk people seeing him, certainly his doctor. He could just run away, live in the wild and fend for himself, but what about his family and friends, his life? That&#39;s not what he wanted to do either. After contemplating dozens of options, Paul decided to test his new body so he had a better idea of what plans might be feasible in his new form.<br />
<br />
Paul tested his enhanced strength as he finished his work on the farm. He was very careful to avoid sight from the road lest a motorist saw him in this beastly form. The work went by twice as quickly as normal due to Paul&#39;s bulging muscles and enhanced physique. He marveled at how easily he could toss hay bales now, and the bags of chicken feed were like nothing to him. Even still, Paul managed to work up a sweat and keep his adrenaline pumping. Soon the work around the farm was done except for the horses. Just standing in the stale air of the stalls was enough to not only trigger his transformation earlier, but also arouse him enough to jack off. Paul did not want to press his luck by going back in there, even if it did smell safe and inviting to him now.<br />
<br />
As Paul sat down for dinner, he felt a little funny. Sensation began to return to his toes, and his fingers split back from three into five. Paul shivered as his creamy coat of short coarse fur receded back into his skin. Paul was still confused about his new condition, but he was grateful to be heading back to his familiar human self. The rest of his horse bits slowly vanished, but his muscles remained noticeably larger than before.</p>
