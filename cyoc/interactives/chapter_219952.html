<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You had seen it on the beach a few times at about dawn over the last 3 years. It would sit on a long large smooth rock that nearly the same color of the surrounding sand. And then it eventually would get up & head into the sea & disappear. It was some kind of anthropomorphic aquatic creature. It had a reptilian looking head with fins for ears. It had 4 webbed toes that ended in points. 4 webbed digits on its hands that also ended in points. A fish tail. A long fish fin running down it&#39;s back. It&#39;s skin was a light blue, smooth & featureless having an almost sheen to it. It also has no visible gender. You decided today was the day to approach it. You walked up to it & said &quot;Hi.&quot; The creature turned it&#39;s head to look at you. It didn&#39;t growl or jump up to run from you. Figuring that was a good sign you sat down next to it on the rock. You looked at the creature having never been this close to it. It&#39;s skin was truly featureless. No nipples or even a bellybutton. Not even any signs of what gender it was; amusing it even had one. &quot;So...do you speak? Do you understand me?&quot; You asked curious. The creature looked away from you looking back at the sea. It made a few noises like clearing it&#39;s throat & then said &quot;It&#39;s me.&quot; You were shocked when you heard the voice. It was your lost brother Dan&#39;s voice. You yelled shocked &quot;You&#39;re Dan?!&quot; The creature revealed to be Dan nodded with a &quot;Yes it&#39;s me.&quot; A million questions began running through your head at this reveal. The first question you had was &quot;How&#39;d you turn into this?&quot; Dan answered &quot;I don&#39;t know why I turned into this but I did.&quot; Your next question was &quot;Were you scared when you transformed into what you are now?&quot; Dan shook his head no answering &quot;Not at all. I just knew I was becoming what I was always meant to be.&quot; Dan then added &quot;And after I became this I immediately left & headed here & into the sea. I knew the sea is where I belong. I knew I was a creature of the sea.&quot; You questioned upset &quot;Why didn&#39;t you say goodbye to me before you left? Even leave me a note? Why did you never try to contact me?&quot; He didn&#39;t answer. Getting angry you asked &quot;Why?&quot; Dan still didn&#39;t answer. &quot;I never thought about it. I never thought about doing any of that.&quot; Really angry & confused now you asked &quot;You never thought about it? Why not Dan?&quot; Dan got & walked a bit to the water. &quot;Tell me Dan!&quot; You yelled demanding. He shook a bit & yelled &quot;Don&#39;t call me that! I&#39;m not Dan! I haven&#39;t been Dan since I became this animal!&quot; Confused you asked &quot;What?&quot; He replied &quot;I ceased being the human known as Dan that day. I just became a nameless animal. A sea creature. So don&#39;t call me Dan. That isn&#39;t me anymore.&quot; You weren&#39;t sure what to say to that. He went on to say &quot;And I didn&#39;t say anything to you about leaving or ever tried to see you wasn&#39;t out of fear of how&#39;d you react to seeing what I am now. I just didn&#39;t ever think of it because I didn&#39;t care about you or the human life I left behind. I still don&#39;t.&quot; You felt hurt by that but you understood. You got up & walked over to him. And put a hand on his shoulder (you were taller than him). His skin felt cool to the touch; and almost rubbery &quot;So...you been doing alright I see.&quot; You said trying to lighten the mood. He looked at you answering &quot;I been doing fine. I got plenty of stuff to eat in the sea since I&#39;m a predator.&quot; You chuckled saying &quot;I kinda figured with those sharp teeth in your maw.&quot; &quot;They are great right?&quot; He said showing them off. That would of scared most; but not you. You rubbed him on the head saying with a smile &quot;You are a funny cool sea creature.&quot; He smiled (which looked creepy with the sharp teeth) &quot;I sure am.&quot; He pulled away from you seeming to pant a little. &quot;You ok?&quot; You asked worried. &quot;I need to return to the water soon.&quot; He informed you. That did make sense sense he is a sea creature. &quot;Wait here in the water. I&#39;ll try & find some clothes for you to wear.&quot; You told him & you turned to leave. He grabbed your arm stopping you. He pulled you back to him & told you &quot;I&#39;m an animal. We animals have no need for clothes.&quot; You looked him over & realized truly what he was now. A Sea Creature. An Animal. A Wild Animal. &quot;And I&#39;m not Dan anymore. I ceased being that human years ago. I&#39;m just a creature of the sea now. I have never missed you & don&#39;t have the ability to love or care about anyone anymore.&quot; He told you letting go of you. &quot;You&#39;re right. You aren&#39;t the human named Dan anymore. But you are still my brother regardless of what you are now.&quot; You told him touching the side of his snout. He slapped your hand away few a seconds growling &quot;And I&#39;m not your brother anymore. I&#39;m just a wild animal now.&quot; You thought for a minute & said with a smile &quot;Fine then. Promise me to come back to see me at least every few months.&quot; He said confused &quot;I told you I&#39;m not your brother Dan anymore. I&#39;m not that human anymore.&quot; You chuckled saying &quot;I know. I&#39;m requesting you a wild sea creature to come back & visit me every so often.&quot; He seemed to think about it & said &quot;The next time I swim through here I&#39;ll visit you human.&quot; And he stepped into the sea. Soon he got a ways out & he went under. You saw his fin speeding away intill it disappeared from your sight. [I&#39;ll see you next time you visit my son.] You thought happy. You were actually were happy he was doing fine. You so wishes you would become a sea creature just like your brother. He was a marvelous creature now. And you knew regardless of what he said he does care about you & does still love you. He wouldn&#39;t of kept returning to this very beach if he didn&#39;t.</p>
