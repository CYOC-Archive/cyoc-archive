<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rox had largely enjoyed life as an Animalian. It restored her youth and allowed her to take the one who had been the closest to her before being uplifted, Fred Dankly, as her mate. The two of them had formed a loving relationship relatively quickly, and mostly because of the emotional bond that had been there even before Rox had been uplifted. It was something that both Rox and Fred had agreed was surprising was so strong over the years. It was like both loved each other in their own way and it blossomed into more when Rox was uplifted. It then made for a magical night when she was able to convert Fred and see the muscular male Great Dane Animalian he became, and they stayed together with smiles and wagging tails, particularly as they heard stories on how other uplifted Animalians fell in love with their owners and things moved from there. It made for some interesting comparisons.<br />
<br />
But the rejuvenation of youth that came with the uplifting and converting process, and particularly with the double dosing side of things also brought about added responsibilities. Rox learned that not all things in life were free and that between them, they had to pay for the food they ate, though Rox also had to privately say she enjoyed getting more than just canned or bagged dog food. This required work to pay for those things, and Rox learned on this quick. Though, she found she could transition over through a lot of things fairly well and had been able to take on some work as a dog show judge, some in Nevada, and occasionally getting some roles that went beyond it. Much of this likely came from her own past as a show dog and picking up on things that she observed and didn&#39;t realize she was before her uplifting. Fred came along when she had to travel, and Rox found that as a former show dog and as an Animalian, she&#39;d brought some things to the dog shows she judged that actually won far more attention than they normally did. Though, some of that included Fred grumbling that people were hoping to see her have a wardrobe malfunction, which Rox often made sure he knew her eyes were only for him.<br />
<br />
Of course, as a married couple, that soon brought about different challenges and changes, which Rox was reminded off as she felt a kick within her, sending a and to her swollen middle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re very active today,&quot; Rox said softly as she rubbed at the spot where one of her present pups was kicking.  This alerted Fred, who was seated in a chair nearby while reading.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Fred asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of our pups is very active today,&quot; Rox said with a smile, &quot;kicking frequently and distracting from application I&#39;m trying to fill out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still looking into that position at the school of modelling?&quot; Fred wondered as he got up and walked over to the office desk and the computer that Rox was using to fill out the application.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Rox answered, &quot;I mean... the things that go into Human modelling isn&#39;t too different from performing at a dog show. There&#39;s a lot of posing and testing to make sure the pose is wanted. And knowing your response... I can tell what poses you like me in, and can assume that would apply for most people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fred gave a low grunt at that. Whit Rox&#39;s pregnancy now getting into its later stages, it was advised that she not travel as much, which in turn cut into the work that she&#39;d done as a judge at dog shows since her uplifting. This made staying in Lyre more important. Rox would be closer to Horizon Light for her doctor&#39;s appointments and would get more flexibility by staying in the area. That then set about a new search for work, and eventually Rox came across the head of the school, Maggie, and the two got to talking. It ultimately turned into a sort of informal interview where Maggie revealed that her &quot;school of modelling&quot; was actually doing quite well and could afford to expand, at least to improve the development process. This of course raised chuckles on how &quot;popular&quot; Animalians seemed to be with many modeling agencies and advertisers.<br />
<br />
From there, Maggie then gave Rox directions on filling out the formal application that would be needed for the job and gave what information could be shared on the nature of what would be expected. Rox thanked her and was now working on that application. As she looked over to Fred at hearing him grunt, she ended up wagging her tail and feeling it thump against the back of the chair she was seated in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you still jealous that someone might take interest in me?&quot; Rox asked to Fred.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re darn right!&quot; Fred answered with his Bronx accent really coming out, &quot;you&#39;re the most beautiful person to ever come into my life... and there were guys out there that wanted to buy you from me before you were uplifted. And now... there are just too many out there that will only want you for your assets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure... but my middle would show that my heart as always been yours,&quot; Rox answered and leaned back to lick at Fred&#39;s muzzle, with its color mirroring her own color pattern and the only real indication that he had once been Human was his hair, which she liked brushing, &quot;and besides this job won&#39;t be the actual modelling but helping new students learn to model.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but I just feel that on an adventure where I can&#39;t follow... someone may just whisk you away and leave me lonely,&quot; Fred said again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you big worry wart,&quot; Rox laughed, &quot;we both know that will never happen. And besides, I need work that won&#39;t have me moving around all that much... particularly while our children are within me and while they&#39;ll be infants in the near future.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Rox turned her attention to the screen, but felt Fred rub her back with his pads and the dull claws at the tips of her fingers rubbing gently through the material of the shirt she was wearing at present. It felt good and relaxed some of her muscles as Fred did so. In a way, it reminded of all the times that Fred had given her kindness and what was then platonic love before her uplifting. She gave a contented smile and managed her focus and filled in the last few spots that related to the application. As she filled in the last spot, she reviewed the application and then hit the enter button. She would have to wait for a formal reply, but it was something that Rox could wait for. She gave a smile and just enjoyed the backrub that her former owner and loving husband was giving her.</p>
