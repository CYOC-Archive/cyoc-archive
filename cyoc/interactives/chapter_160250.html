<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Connor decided to head back home, seeing that he was still changing at least a bit in terms of his dick. He was of course very much still conscious about that, even with his body changed as it was, and that he was wearing womens&#39; clothes right now. In his heart of hearts, Connor was a man&#39;s man...who just so happened to have a...currently kind of average dick. Connor waved goodbye to Stuart and said, &quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ve got to go now. Errand!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-Buh...but wait!&quot; Stuart got up and watched Connor hurry out the door, and then sat back down. He seemed to wonder, and then murmured, &quot;I have to meet her again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor didn&#39;t look back, instead just looking forward. He had to get home before Kendall got there, get these fucking girl clothes off of him so she didn&#39;t think he was...somehow getting used to and liking these transformations or something. Because the last thing that could be happening to Connor right now was that he was somehow mentally changing to like this. He was a man who liked having a dick. And he was going to make every effort to keep his manhood.<br />
<br />
If he couldn&#39;t keep his muscles, he would damn well keep his dick.<br />
<br />
Before long, Connor got home and surveyed the place, relieved that Kendall was not yet here. He took off the clothes in a flurry, tossing them into the dirty clothes area in his parents&#39; room... and then he got a look at himself in the mirror in his parents&#39; room. His B-Cup breasts, his manhood, his distinctly feminine...female form. And he moaned, because fucking DAMN Connor wished he could&#39;ve fucked this stunning woman he kinda looked like.<br />
<br />
Connor cut it out before getting himself into another, heh, pitstop, and then got dressed in some old clothes that even then barely fit him right. Damn, forced to dress in what amounted to kid&#39;s clothes, and still these things didn&#39;t do him right. He had to get things in order before this got any worse.<br />
<br />
Interrupting his morose mental processes was the sound of the door opening downstairs, closing and then locking. Ah, Kendall. Heading downstairs, Connor was not surprised when Kendall seemed to look at him with an expression of horror at first, &quot;C-Connor---? Is that still you? Are you still---?&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor smirked and cupped his groin, &quot;I&#39;ve still got it babe, no worries. Our sex life can go on. Sure its a bit smaller, but I think it&#39;s---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How we use it...yes,&quot; Kendall stated in an uneasy tone. Damn but this was going far. She needed to find out who was responsible for this, and then find some way to revert Connor back to normal. &quot;Before we get right to business tonight, I&#39;d like to see how far the damages go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure this isn&#39;t an excuse to see me naked before the act?&quot; Connor teased, but a testy look from her made him strip naked promptly. He stood there, ramrod straight, feeling suddenly rather nervous. He noted she was examining his organs, and then looking at his breasts...<br />
<br />
Kendall nodded, &quot;Yeah, it seems so far the change has mostly resulted in your body going almost entirely female...almost.&quot; She said with a certain direction at his cock. &quot;Maybe that&#39;s going to be the last thing that changes. Meaning we have some quality time to ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendall then followed her boyfriend into stripping, bringing out an all too familiar masculine scowl of arousal from Connor. Now this was getting to be more like his speed. Kendall went up to him and cupped his breast, drawing a moan out of Connor and his cock erected almost instantaneously from the stimulation. She seemed to smile at that, &quot;Now do you see how sensitive these things can get?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh yeah babe...suck my fucking titties.&quot; Was the only response she got out of Connor. She did admit it was almost too predictable that the big jock hadn&#39;t really gone away - he was just basically objectifying his own newly feminine form. And she did find a certain thrill in that, even as she moved in and started licking and lightly sucking at Connor&#39;s breasts, all the while her hand massaged his dick.<br />
<br />
This sufficed to remove from Connor the capacity to intelligently communicate - all he was able to do from there was moan, groan and pump his hips. Which Kendall noted were looking distinctly feminine. Kendall kept rubbing his dick, and Connor was on cloud nine. He could not even speak, and nothing could stop him from just charging headlong into how arousing this was. His body felt so incredible like this...having his cock but the body of a woman...<br />
<br />
Ohh yes! Connor moaned, and managed to say, &quot;B-Babe...cmon...I-I uh...I wanna stick it in...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go right ahead, baby.&quot; Said in that breathy babydoll voice she did when she wanted to drive him nuts. And drive him up the wall she did. Connor started pistoning his hips as he fucked her pussy, almost slamming his hips up and down, compensating for his diminished strength with renewed effort. Muscles he didn&#39;t have any more being replaced by sheer physical exertion.<br />
<br />
Connor breathed and grunted, desperately whispering into her ear, &quot;I&#39;m...gonna...cum!&quot; And with her assistance he pulled out just in time for his seed to rain on to her stomach. Yes, it seemed for all that the rest of him was feminine, he retained his loads.<br />
<br />
Before long, the changing jock fell into a bit of a drowsy state, and after relocating briefly, fell asleep right on the couch for a light post-sex nap. He didn&#39;t even notice that his activities and actions that day were being observed and noted.<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this makes things interesting.&quot; Jenna commented as she watched what happened with Connor. The Chronivac in her hand and readied. Whatever she was doing with it, it couldn&#39;t be what either of those in that house anticipated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenna...is---isn&#39;t this enough?&quot; Josie asked, looking a little bit concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just changing his gender isn&#39;t enough. I&#39;ve thought up another way to get at Connor. I&#39;ll make that jock BEG me to give him a pussy.&quot; Jenna said with a slightly perverted smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you---?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Observe.&quot; Jenna stated, and then powered up the Chronivac. She started adjusting Connor&#39;s data again. He might at first, Jenna thought, think what I&#39;m going to do is a gift. But ohh boy, it&#39;s not. She paused most of the changes except a few - Connor would be a C Cup by tomorrow...but his manhood would not only stay, it would be increased back up to 7 inches long. As Jenna made those changes, she considered her work so far;<br />
<br />
Connor would be confronted with an increasingly female body, and with a sexual organ that did not match with what he was becoming at all. And going by what he did today, he would be increasingly falling into more and more female perceptions. It was just a matter of time on that. And after everything he did to her, him having to ask her to complete the changes on him would be delicious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know Jenna...&quot; Josie commented, &quot;Seems kind of mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Justice isn&#39;t always nice, Josie.&quot; Jenna said as the two of them left the area.</p>
