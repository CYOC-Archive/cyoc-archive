<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave felt good as he drove to work. Better than he had in years. Sure he kept himself in good shape and everything, but 50 years was 50 years and it pulled on him sometimes. He turned up the radio and rolled down his windows, just letting the wind blow through his hair as he drove to the gym. He&#39;d worked at the gym since before Aaron was born, his friend from his amateur bodybuilding days, Owen Sinclair opened it with money he had won from those competitions, and tapped Dave to be his second. Sometimes he thought of striking it out on his own, but he was comfortable with the job, and he got free access to all the equipment.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t a long drive, and soon he was striding in through the doors of the gym. It was actually the third gym. Owen had started with a small and grungy place, but as he made money he&#39;d move to newer and bigger locations. His current gym was something of a modern wonder. Clean and bright, with the latest equipment and even a juice bar and indoor pool. He was looking to opening a second location now, making a real chain. Cindy sat behind the counter, she was one of the trainers but took some shifts at the front desk as well. She greeted him with a smile and a bob of the head that set her ponytail swaying. &quot;Looking good, Dave.&quot; She said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flattery will get you no where.&quot; He stopped in front of her though. &quot;Can you print off Marcus&#39; schedule for the day and direct any of his clients to me. I&#39;m filling in for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Sinclair told me.&quot; Cindy said with a mild smile. &quot;First one is already here. Ms. Sanderson, though her appointment is in fifteen. Don&#39;t let her get her claws in you. She&#39;s a cougar and she won&#39;t let go.&quot; Dave just shook his head. A cougar huh? She was probably a decade younger than him at least. If Marcus could handle her, so could he. But he smiled and took the list of clients. Two before lunch and two after, not terrible. He headed to the locker rooms a bounce in his step.<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Aaron watched his dad leave with a curious scrunching of his brows. His dad had given him an odd look in passing, and Aaron had to suppress doing the same. Even if his dad would notice the changes eventually, he didn&#39;t want him thinking he was behind them. There was something different about his father, but he just couldn&#39;t put his finger on it.<br />
<br />
Dropping his breakfast bowl in the sink he headed towards the bathroom for his morning shower. He turned on the water to let it start heating up then caught sight of himself in the mirror from the corner of his eye and froze. He looked down and ran his finger over his chest. How had he not noticed that?! His chest, once flat and almost boney now stuck out a scant inch or so from the rest of his torso.  It wasn&#39;t much and was hardly impressive, but it was far more than he had sported before. No wonder his father had given him an odd look.<br />
<br />
He turned to face himself a little more completely in the mirror. His shoulders and arms looked a little fuller, too, and when he placed his hands on the counter his elbows didn&#39;t bend as much, it took him a moment to figure out it was due to a few more inches in height. Well, the program promised to improve their relationship and he knew his father always wanted a son more like him. Maybe this was the start.<br />
<br />
He rubbed his chin and leaned in close, faint stubbly hairs were visible on his upper lip and chin, he had never been able to grow facial hair of any sort. Steam from the shower has beginning to fog the mirror so he stripped off his pajama bottoms and gasped. His cock had chubbed a little during his self examination but he could tell at a glance it was slightly bigger. He didn&#39;t know what bearing that had on his relationship with his father, that was the one thing he knew he did take after his father in. Neither of them were really that impressive between the legs. His father made up for it in his build, Aaron had made up for it by just being a twinkish bottom to the point it didn&#39;t matter. He had always wanted to be bigger though, maybe this was something of that &quot;wants and desires&quot; part.<br />
<br />
He stepped into the shower and let the hot water wash over him as he grabbed at his cock. He was still only what most would consider average, but it was still a good inch and a half improvement on where he was. He moaned softly as he stroked himself off, imagining the young muscle bears he preferred. It was why he could never go to his dad&#39;s gym. Too many men there he&#39;d want to bend over for and he couldn&#39;t let his dad find out about that.<br />
<br />
Hell, it didn&#39;t help that his dad had once been the very type of guy he&#39;d go for. Well, except for the fact he liked his guys hung, and the thicker the better. But even older and with the gut he was attractive. If he was twenty years younger, little would have.. Aaron shook that line of thought out of his head. That was his father. But his cock still responded to the thoughts, hard and throbbing in his hand. He tossed his head back with a deep groan as his cum splattered the shower tile.<br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
Ms. Sanderson, or Emma as she insisted on being called, &quot;Ms. Sanderson makes me sound like an old widow,&quot; set the free weights back down. Dave was glad their appointment was almost over. She seemed to keep &#39;accidentally&#39; pumping into him, her hands squeezing this muscle or that as she did, and she kept needing him to correct her posture or form, forcing him into touching her. Always with a coy smile on her lips.<br />
<br />
Dave had to admit she was attractive. Raven haired, fit. He had her age right, early forties, about a decade younger than him, but she was flirting with him hard. Another day he might have been flattered, but today it just didn&#39;t seem to strike home.  She turned quickly and bumped into him again, her hand going to his chest, manicured nails pressing into his shirt just hard enough he could feel them. She gave his pectoral a light squeeze and a stoke of her fingers before she backed away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I got more out of that session than I do with Marcus. Any chance you&#39;re taking on new clients, it just hasn&#39;t been the same with him since he got married and had the baby.&quot; She flicked her eyes down to his hand, no doubt noting the lack of a ring. &quot;All business.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry. My client list is full, but I&#39;ll let you know if I get an opening.&quot; Fat chance, he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about drinks?&quot; She went for the more direct tactic. &quot;There&#39;s no.. Mrs. Meyers is there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not anymore.&quot; Dave answered honestly, but continued the honesty streak. &quot;But, I think I&#39;m a little old to jump back into the dating pool.&quot; <br />
<br />
That seemed to strike her as funny, since she laughed and shook her head, just giving him an amused look. &quot;If you are, then so am I. Just.. think on it. You have my number already.&quot; She sauntered off with a sway that was just inviting him to look, instead he sighed heavily.<br />
<br />
He felt a weight on his shoulder and turned to see Chris leaning an arm on him, watching Ms. Sanderson walk off with an appreciative look on his face. Chris was one of the younger trainers, only 22, but he had a knack for it, and a damn impressive physique to go with it. As good as himself and Owen back in the day. &quot;Too old.&quot; Chris said with a laugh, lowering his arm and smacking Dave in the stomach with the back of his hand. &quot;I&#39;m surprised she didn&#39;t slap you for that one. She&#39;s got a couple years on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris was always friendly, especially with the other younger staff, but he had never been like this with Dave before. The attitude was enough to strike him mute until Chris wandered off to go handle something else. A couple years on him? What the hell was he talking about? He turned his head to the side, to the wall of mirrors and stared. He had been so fixed on his client he hadn&#39;t really seen himself.<br />
<br />
It was him, but a version of himself he hadn&#39;t seen in a long time. His hair was pitch black as was the stubble on his jaw, any sign of graying was gone. Even his face seemed a little smoother. The gut that had been growing for the last ten years was practically gone. He lifted his tee just a bit. His stomach wasn&#39;t completely flat, nor back to the ripped six pack he had up till his mid-thirties, but it was far flatter than it had been this morning, just a slight layering of padding over his abs, covered with a trimmed layer of dark black hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woof.&quot; Dave let his shirt drop at the word and turned to look over from where the sound had come from. A tall blond man in his late twenties, a little scruffy with a leanly muscled swimmer&#39;s build, was looking right at him an appreciative smile on his face. And where Ms. Sanderson&#39;s looks and flirts had hardly got a rise out of him, this man.. He was glad his jock strap kept things in place. &quot;Sorry.&quot; The man said with a smile that said he wasn&#39;t sorry at all. &quot;Are you Dave? I&#39;m Jon.&quot; Dave nodded, that was the name of his second client for the day.<br />
<br />
&quot;No worries.&quot; Dave said with a grin. &quot;I would be lying if I said I didn&#39;t mind people appreciating my hard work.&quot; He shook hands with Jon and they got to work. As he guided Jon through the various exercises he found it much the same as with his first client, but he didn&#39;t mind as much when they bumped into each other, and he even found himself finding reasons to put a hand on Jon to correct this or that.<br />
<br />
An hour later he found himself in an infrequently visited supply closet with Jon kneeling eagerly in front of him. Dave gulped as Jon pulled down his shorts and jock strap. He gasped as his cock flopped free, already mostly hard. It wasn&#39;t his cock. At least not the one he expected. It was obviously his as it was attached to him, but it wasn&#39;t the one he had had. A few inches longer than it had been, it was quite a bit thicker and heavily veined. Jon grinned at his prize.<br />
<br />
His back up against the wall, Dave had one hand on a shelf and another tangled in Jon&#39;s shaggy blond hair, looking down at the man as he wrapped his mouth around Dave&#39;s cock. He had done this plenty of times before, Dave could tell. Jon knew exactly what he was doing and exactly how to use his tongue. Seeing Jon on his cock, that shaggy blond hair, those big blue eyes. An image of Aaron on his cock instead flashed into his head. He quickly banished that.<br />
<br />
It had been so long since he&#39;d had even a blow job from another person that it didn&#39;t take long for Dave to shoot his load down Jon&#39;s throat. If the other man was bothered by the shortness of it he didn&#39;t seem bothered, swallowing every drop with a smile.<br />
<br />
Jon stood up and leaned in close, his hand fondling Dave&#39;s heavier balls. &quot;Thanks, today was a good.. workout. Maybe you can give me a call if you want something more.&quot; The man gave Dave&#39;s balls one last teasing tug and slipped out of the closet. Dave quickly pulled his shorts back up. What the hell had gotten into him? Not only letting some random guy blow him off, he had never done anything with a guy before, but then that thought of Aaron.<br />
<br />
He shook his head and slipped out of the closet, only to see a smirking Chris looking in his direction. The younger trainer gave him a double thumbs up, obviously approving of his closet antics. Dave tried to return his sternest boss glare, which usually set most people sweating, but only caused Chris to smile more. He headed towards the office, usually Owen&#39;s domain but the man wasn&#39;t here today, to eat his lunch in peace.</p>
