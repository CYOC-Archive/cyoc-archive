<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You slept that night thinking Kyle would never be the same after today. In all honesty, it feels kind of guilty doing this. The mascot assured them that they aren&#39;t killing these kids&#39; identities, merely transposing our identities to their existing ones. But still... You didn&#39;t dwell much on the thought because there&#39;s no sense in doing that. You lay on your bed scrounging up Nathan&#39;s memories about Kyle.<br />
<br />
In your limited experience with him, he acts like the leader of their circle of friends. He&#39;s the one who initiates their topic of conversation, and he decides to end one. If he has an interesting topic, the rest of the group follows. Be it the newest games, food stalls, etc. None complained because everyone liked his interests. He was also the oldest and tallest, which added to his leadership factor. <br />
<br />
The next morning went normally in the Addams household. His mother mentioned that your soccer coach called, and you were absent at the latest practice. You made an excuse about doing your algebra assignment and lost your sense of time. Before she could add more nags, you mentioned being sorry for the mistake and you promised to do better next time. That seemed to shut her trap. You supped the rest of your egg soup and prepared to go to class. <br />
<br />
You were ecstatic for the rest of your walk toward the school. You could scarcely imagine how Kyle would act the next time you saw him. Would he remain the charismatic leader or become like his jaded co-worker? You won&#39;t find out until the first period. Or so you thought... While on your walk to school, you felt someone&#39;s arms wrap around your shoulder. It&#39;s Kyle, and he has the widest smile on his face. His auburn-colored hair is all messed up and some of his buttons are open. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Kyle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... yeah... you&#39;re welcome. So, how was it? Masturbated this morning?&quot; You replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what you did too, huh? Yeah. Blew off more loads in a single hour than what I&#39;d done a month back in my old body. This body ain&#39;t just running out of steam.&quot; Come to think of it, this is the first time you&#39;ve seen Finn this happy. His only reason for smiling back then was when a co-worker of theirs experienced a misfortune. Schadenfreude, he calls it. But now? He&#39;s breaming with overflowing joy. <br />
<br />
The rest of the day went as normally as they came. You&#39;re getting somewhat pissed because you&#39;re not getting any chances to show off your academic prowess. Your teachers don&#39;t seem to give out recitations, unlike what you experienced in elementary school. Although, you found minor recompense in today&#39;s Algebra quiz. While the others are desperately cramming their heads for answers, you and Kyle are answering the quiz questions like your usual Sunday sudoku. The two of you even passed at the same time. <br />
<br />
Right after class, Kyle asked you to come with him to his house. You don&#39;t have soccer practice today but you still made an effort to message your mother about your plans. She agreed immediately, and bid you to have fun with your friend. Of course, you&#39;ll have fun.<br />
<br />
Kyle pushed you to the wall, and your lips locked into one sloppy kiss. Kyle is the bigger one between him and you, so he took leadership of both of your tempos. He raised one of your legs and rubbed both of your crotches together. He&#39;s older so his package is far larger than yours. And he&#39;s already got a bushel of hair down there. Kyle&#39;s already well-informed about this sort of stuff even before Finn took over his body, so it didn&#39;t take long for both of you to find lube on his bedroom&#39;s vent. His lubed-up dick somehow slipped inside your hole and pushed deep inside. Of course, you winced in pain. Other than curious fingers, no other thing went up inside that hole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!!! Fuck that hurts,&quot; despite the complaints, you continued to kiss Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;So- sorry. I got a little excited,&quot; Kyle apologized. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll loosen you first.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s dick retreated out of your hole. He fingered you instead. One finger became two. He spread it apart and searched the fleshy cavernous walls of your anus. Finding your prostate is an easy task considering how tiny your anus is. He rubbed your prostate which milked an even lewder moan out of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh..ngghhh... Ah! Ah!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucky for both of you, both of Kyle&#39;s parents both have jobs. The poor kid feels alone most of the time, and that&#39;s why he does his best to be cordial to a variety of people. Not like both of you care for that childish drama anymore. You&#39;re both happy to have the house all for yourselves. <br />
<br />
You already feel loosened up by Kyle&#39;s fingers. You&#39;ve made one look at him and he understood. His big throbbing member, no larger for adults but still considered a giant at this miniature perspective, pierced inside your whole like a hot knife on a cold was of butter. It filled you with searing pain that rang out as one frightful scream out of your throat. Kyle seemed like he wanted to pull back but you stopped him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Put that thing inside me,&quot; You gasp for breath. &quot;I – I can take it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle still got this worried look despite the pleasure wreaking havoc on his body, but he obliged your request. He pushed you roughly to the floor where your twig-thin arms and legs could barely support the rest of your body. He drew his body on top of you, as he railed you with his hips. His hands found their way to your dick, and he jerked you off. Fuck! This is paradise. You&#39;re attacked on multiple fronts. They brought pain and they brought pleasure. Both of your youthful voices moaned inside the room, uncaring of how loud both of you are. Your mind is lost to pleasure and it seems so was Kyle. He doesn&#39;t even care anymore that you&#39;re hurting. All he cares about now is his self-centered pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhhhh!!!&quot; Both of your voices sang in the chorus as hot lobules of cum hosed out of your dicks. You feel your insides churn as every inch of its walls begins to be covered with his semen. Despite the release, Kyle continued to fuck you senseless. The mere thought of continuing after the climax is commendable. You thought it was a futile attempt. No adults can cum twice in a row. But then you realized, you&#39;re not adults. You&#39;re prepubescent boys teeming with endless hormones and untapped libido. Within moments, your once flaccid dick grew harder. You felt pressure from your anus, and you realized that it was Kyle&#39;s hardening dick. <br />
<br />
Kyle crouched closer to your ear, &quot;Fuck. This is the best thing that&#39;s happened in my entire life. Thank you,&quot; <br />
<br />
With that, Kyle came about four or five more times that night. Although, it must be a lot more than that. You&#39;re covered in cum by the end of it. When you went to wash it off, he proceeded to fuck you in the shower as well. You get the feeling that this won&#39;t end here. <br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
For the next few days, others have begun to notice the changes surrounding Nathan and Kyle. Once friends, their relationship blossomed into something more intimate and deeper. They made the excuse of reviewing their studies together. At least, it&#39;s a good reason for their rapidly increasing marks at school. Even their professors commended them for their improving grades. <br />
<br />
But in reality, their study sessions were more like an endless cumfest. There&#39;s no end to Kyle&#39;s and your libido. Both of you would fuck in the school restrooms, the school roof, and even at the library. You were hungry for Kyle&#39;s manly cock, and he was always welcome to receive your mouth. Although this is already the just break you two rightly deserved from your prior life, things can always change. What happened next?</p>
