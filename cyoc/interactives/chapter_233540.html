<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nina Stephens was sound asleep in her bedroom, having been tucked in to bed a moment earlier by her Daddy. Daddy was 28 year old Jacob Stephens who was dressed in dark blue plaid pajama pants with a grey t-shirt. He was a younger father having had sex one drunken night with a girl named Alexis Rhoads who had visited his fraternity for a party one Thirsty Thursday while they were in college. Rather than deny the consequences of his actions, Jacob had supported Alexis through the pregnancy and had congenial relations with Alexis even though they&#39;d both moved on in their lives in separate directions. He&#39;d even been asked to be part of the wedding party at Alexis&#39; wedding to her husband, Rick. Jacob took his co-parenting duties seriously and provided for Nina the best he could, and Alexis and Rick always made sure to include Jacob in all of the big events of their family&#39;s lives. <br />
<br />
That is, until recently when Alexis had decided to serve him papers that asked for sole custody of Nina. The papers were filled with what Jacob thought were outright lies--that he was bringing home strange women almost every night--that he had yet to have engaged in a serious relationship yet, and that he was behind in his support for Nina. Sure, he wasn&#39;t perfect, but then again no one was. Sometimes maybe he did bring home a girl or two from the bar--but he made sure it was never on a week he had Nina. And he might have missed a month or two here or there on child support payments, but he always made it up. Always. But as Jacob ran his hand through his dark brown hair and stared at the court documents on his lap, he wished he didn&#39;t have to deal with any of this.<br />
<br />
&quot;God... if only I could be without a care in the world...&quot; he mumbled to himself as he put the papers on his nightstand and then turned out the light and settled in for the night. Unfortunately the magic swirling about the neighborhood had heard it, and it was that which sealed what would come next.<br />
<br />
Like with Mitch, the magic couldn&#39;t just make Nina older--it needed to transfer age and time from some being or beings to another. And given the family situation of Nina and Jacob Stephens, it would make the most sense to use them as they would cause the least amount of holes that needed filling in the neighborhood, not to mention that Nina already had a strong relationship with the original Mitch. Sure that relationship with eight-year-old Mitch had been one based on disgust and hate, but strong emotions were far easier to convert to other strong emotions as far as the magic was concerned, than to grow them from disinterest or from scratch.<br />
<br />
And so the magic began to make its work as Jacob and Nina began to swap roles, time, and age. In order to come close to matching Mitch&#39;s age, it would have to take all of Jacob&#39;s in order to get Nina to be somewhat equivalent, which would leave Jacob extremely young, far younger than either of his soon to be big brothers Eric and Adrian. The transformation first started with Nina, like with Mitch, with the feet. Her small feet growing out until they reached their full adult proportions of a size nine shoe with painted toenails that looked well pedicured looked comically out of place on her childish body.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in Jacob&#39;s room, his large size 12 hairy feet lost their hair and then began to shrink growing smaller and pudgier until the baby-sized feet looked positively ridiculous attached to his adult legs. That however didn&#39;t last long as first his ankles, and then his leg began losing body hair and then muscle mass, and then began shrinking through a gawky long phase and then through shrink spurts until baby fat began to grow upon the shrinking legs once more and they matched the equally rather small and baby-looking feet he had.<br />
<br />
Nina&#39;s legs stretched out across her bed in length, first, hair growing and then shaved away on them as muscle and fat distributed itself to rather womanly proportions. This change then came to her butt as it swelled and her hips grew wider and capable of having given birth. Her pubic mound grew hair, and her vagina stretched to its adult proportions. At this she had outgrown the little nightgown she wore, with her adult lower body sticking out from what used to be covered by the small nightgown.<br />
<br />
Jacob&#39;s own butt grew smaller and less defined as it shrank to match his legs and feet. It was then his plaid pajama pants lost the fight and fell off his shrinking lower body as it shrunk out of them. This was then followed by his torso with first the dark brown treasure trail leading to his pubic hair and groin fading away along with the hair on his pubes. Soon he was hairless from his belly button down as his dick and balls began to shrink--his balls retracting up into the sockets they are kept in before puberty, and his dick shrinking from the respectable 8 incher it was to a teeny tiny pecker worthy of any baby boy. His abs, pecs, and delts all began to shrink as his chest hair faded back into the follicles they&#39;d grown out of, soon leaving his entire torso as undeveloped as a teenage boy on the verge of puberty, only for any sign of puberty like hair under his armpits, or the stretched out proportions of his chest or the wide shoulders he had had, shrinking and condensing until baby fat was covering up any signs of older development and Jacob&#39;s torso was that of a little baby&#39;s with adult arms and head attached to it, swimming in an adult shirt far too big for the increasingly tiny infant Jacob was becoming.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Nina&#39;s torso stretched and grew. Stretch marks appearing on her belly, hair growing under her armpits, only to be shaved to a shorter and trim length. Her breast buds stretched out her nipples until they started growing at a rapid rate into full-sized B cups, and then the mammary glands in them began to produce and fill her breasts to a full C cup with milk, readying to nurse her baby. With their growth, her tiny child-sized night gown stretched and then ripped entirely to allow for the growth. Next her arms and hands grew and stretched, the nails gaining a manicure and then a paint job to match that of her toenails.<br />
<br />
Jacob&#39;s arms began to lose their muscle as his biceps and triceps atrophied into skinny gangly arms with hands too big for them, which was soon solved as they shrank, growing smaller and pudgier with baby fat until nothing but two tiny baby arms with hands too small to grab anything let along crayons were what he was left with. With an adult head on a baby&#39;s body, Jacob certainly now looked ridiculous, but first the stubble on his face retreated, followed by what few lines on his face were there smoothing over. His face grew younger and fresher looking, with his angular features beginning to round out after a short while, this was followed by his neck growing smaller as his Adam&#39;s apple shrinking away. Soon the face of a young child was atop the infant body, and still it grew younger and younger, his dark brown hair growing whispy atop his head as the last part of Jacob grew very young, only a few weeks old, completing the first part of the transformation.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Nina&#39;s head grew larger as her dark brown hair grew longer until it grew past her shoulders. Soon a thirty-five year old woman was laying atop of a destroyed child&#39;s nightgown on a little girl&#39;s bed, in a little girl&#39;s bedroom. And then the magic took root yet again as the nightgown grew and reformed itself until it had grown to Nina&#39;s new adult size. and shifted from a frilly cheap cloth, to a reliably cool satin nightgown that Nina wore in the summer. The bed grew around her to that of a twin-sized bed, its bedspread going from Turning Red sheets to red cotton sheets. Her bedroom shifted from being a second bedroom to that of the Master bedroom of the house. Dolls, toys, and posters were vanishing only to be replaced with a tastefully decorated bedroom any single adult woman would live in.<br />
<br />
Back in Jacob&#39;s room, full-sized bed he had been sleeping in began to suddenly shrink, along with his pajamas until he was only wearing a diaper and nothing else in his crib as his master bedroom shifted into that of a nursery.<br />
<br />
Nina woke up, her brain not completely finished changing as the magic needed Jacob and Nina to be together for the next stage of the transformation. Nina was at first confused as to where she was as the bedroom looked completely unfamiliar, but soon she began to recognize certain bits and pieces, like her nightstand and her lamp that she turned on. She got up, curious as to why she was getting up at two-thirty in the morning when suddenly she heard a baby cry, and Nina immediately leapt into action, heading next door to the nursery where her baby boy was supposed to be asleep--no this was why she was up... Jake needed his nightly feeding. The boy was tiring her out ever since she&#39;d brought him home from the hospital--oh if only she had the support of his father who... she couldn&#39;t quite picture at the moment. Nina brought the wailing Jake up as she fussed with her nightgown and exposed a breast for Jake to begin suckling. As Jake latched on to suckle to his new Mommy, the next phase of the transformation began as Nina sat down in the rocking chair to nurse him. The rocking soothed not Jake, but Nina back in her drowsy sense, to sleep. As Jake suckled, Nina&#39;s belly and hips began to expand, with luckily her nightgown expanding with it into a maternity night gown. Once having grown to a full nine months proportions the magic made the final push and Jake disappeared from Nina&#39;s breast and into her womb where an awaiting umbilical cord connected to his belly button, and a placenta encased him and amniotic fluid. With that push now there were only a few months left to push Nina up to the thirty-six age mark she was destined to become, and this transformation needed a change of venue. And so with a snap the nursery transferred from the house down the street, to become part of Mitch&#39;s house and floor plan, adding yet another room between Mitch and the boys&#39; room. <br />
<br />
It was then that Mitch, who had had trouble getting back to sleep could now remember his wife&#39;s name--it was Nina. And she wasn&#39;t away visiting friends out of state, she was over in the nursery they&#39;d just finished transforming from their shared home office. Mitch got up and lumbered his way over to the nursery to see his gloriously nine-month pregnant wife looking stunning, even having fallen asleep a mess in the rocking chair. She sometimes fell asleep in chairs, finding them to be a bit more comfortable than laying on her back in a bed. But if she stayed there all night, she&#39;d regret it in the morning, so Mitch walked over and gently shook his wife&#39;s shoulder. The magic beginning the next stage of transformation at that instant as a tingling went through both Mitch and Nina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why if it isn&#39;t the grossest boy I&#39;ve ever seen,&quot; teased Nina through her drowsiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not like you weren&#39;t as equally icky at eight as I was,&quot; teased Mitch back as he leaned over and kissed the eight month pregnant Nina tenderly.<br />
<br />
&quot;If there&#39;d been inkwells in those school desks you would have dunked my pigtails in them,&quot; said Nina<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this trip down memory lane all about? That was elementary school... everything changed after puberty,&quot; said Mitch as he helped his seven month pregnant wife to her feet and out of the nursery.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just because I didn&#39;t call you gross, didn&#39;t mean I started liking you in Middle School. You were infuriating at times with how you always found an excuse to hang about me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We lived on the same block, and hung out with most of the same friends--hard to avoid each other then, but I will admit, I did find you a bit cute when you got flustered back then,&quot; said Mitch as he brought his five month pregnant wife to their bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then we got to high school... and all that frustration led to that kiss... that horribly wonderful kiss... and I knew then that there wasn&#39;t any other man for me,&quot; said Nina.<br />
<br />
&quot;You knew then? Then why didn&#39;t you say anything?&quot; asked Mitch<br />
<br />
&quot;It never seemed like the right time... unlike now,&quot; said Nina with a gleam appearing in her eye as she met his with a certain lustful gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now? But what about the baby?&quot; asked Mitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m only three months pregnant--we had sex when I was four months with Eric and Adrian, this won&#39;t hurt the baby one bit,&quot; assured Nina.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the boys?&quot; asked Mitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as we&#39;re quiet, they&#39;ll sleep through it. Heck, they&#39;d sleep through the storming of For Knox without waking up,&quot; said Nina before kissing Mitch and playfully biting his tongue. Mitch needed no other invitation. Quickly their sleepwear was on the floor and the two thirty-six year olds were passionately fucking each other, Nina riding Mitch as months of pregnancy turned to weeks, then to days, then to hours, and finally to minutes until she hit her climax as Jake&#39;s sperm and egg separated and a rush of semen instead of ejaculating out of Mitch was sucked back into his testicles, all containing the DNA information to recreate Jake as they continued on until Mitch climaxed and ejaculated back into Nina&#39;s awaiting fertile womb and Jake&#39;s sperm half reunited with his egg half once more. The magic transformation ended as the roles of mother and son had been fully swapped and accepted by Nina and Jacob, and Nina had become the appropriately aged wife for Mitch&#39;s 36 years, matching him and now pregnant with their soon to be third baby boy, Jacob Pendergast.</p>
