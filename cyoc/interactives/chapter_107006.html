<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Benton pulled into the parking lot of the Moon Lake Elementary school to see the throngs of reporters milling about. Seeing the school’s principal making small talk with Benton’s architect who also showed up, made him smile. Despite him and his daughter visiting Amanda recovering from her accident and parasitic infection; Benton was quite unhinged when Doctor Tora showed him a secure wing containing feral weres. Weres put there for both their own safety and that of the towns; as well as the towns secret. Deciding to beat both his wife and daughter to the bush, he surprises all of them by agreeing to be tested for Bi-polar. After dropping his Daughter off to his Brother’s gazette he drives off not knowing that Frieda started heading towards Spencer’s house. He was surprised with Frieda’s forward thinking in trying to get the staff to come back. He would have to look into and deal with the issues the various staff brought forward before any would even consider coming back. <br />
<br />
 Despite the fact the architect was a normal; he was one of the few normal’s that Benton actually liked; sharing the same vision Benton had when he remodeled his parents’ home to suit his taste; both managed to forge a friendship of sorts. As Benton gets out of his flashy Lamborghini Veneno he is soon mobbed by the throng of reporters hoping to get a scoop. He ignores them as he approaches the Principal and his Architect. Asking everyone to take a seat Benton heads to the podium and stares at the crowd gathered in front of him. He sees in the back several members of the Elder council; Andrew Curry standing next to Benton’s Brother Lance as well as Leon Talbot. Benton thinks, ‘If I just dropped Frieda off at Lance’s business, then why is Lance here?’ He was about to send his daughter a text when he get one from her.<br />
‘Sorry for not telling you. But I want to spend the day with my friends. Don’t worry; I have my were-birth control pills with me. I’ll call you later.’<br />
Deciding to table that for the time being, Benton takes the speech he prepared Friday afternoon and confidently begins.<br />
“Thursday evening our town was hit with a massive storm. While we all managed to weather through it; the building behind sadly suffered. When the custodial staff entered to begin their day they were dismayed to see the basement flooded. With the power outage, the sump pumps could not stop the water from pooling and damaging the necessary equipment that the school needs to function properly and safely.”<br />
<br />
Benton pauses to view the crowd before him.<br />
<br />
“Yet this was not the extent of the schools issues. The roof for the original portion; built around the turn of the twentieth century; is well past its life span and leak extensively into the faculty lounge. Coupled with the fact that a tree fell down severing the power line meant that the children that attend this school could not safely attend. It saddens me that the school board while diligent with their accounting cannot come up with the funds needed to fix theses important issues.”<br />
“Do you intend to provide the funds to fix the school,” a reporter shouts.<br />
<br />
Benton smiles; “I intend to do something better. Before the start of the next school year, there will be a new Elementary school built. No reusing old structure because of heritage status. This building will be one hundred percent new and its construction will be paid for out of my own pocket!” <br />
<br />
The crowd erupts with questions as Benton turns to shake the principal’s hand who is completely floored at the news he just heard. Even the representatives of school board were dumbfounded with what they heard. Benton just raises hands for silence so he can speak again.<br />
“While this will not solve the current dilemma faced with the now old elementary school, I will provide funds to ensure there are self-contained portables for the faculty to use during the interim of emergency repairs being made to the school’s current roof. Funding will also be made available to provide a backup generator to ensure if the power does go out in the school; there will be power to keep the sump pumps running and the basement free of any future flooding.”<br />
“Where will this new school be built?” The same reporter from before shouting.<br />
<br />
Benton goes on to explain as representatives of the elder council look on.<br />
“Benton has them eating from the palm of his hand,” Andrew states.<br />
“I wouldn’t be surprised if he announces his entry to run for mayor,” the weredog representative quips.<br />
“That would surprise me,” Andrew answers; “If he thinks he can force an early election after Martin Stovall’s budget passing unanimously; then Benton is in for a rude shock.”<br />
<br />
Lance who was also recently inducted into the council looks on in silence; the words Tachibana said last night echoing in his head.<br />
‘Did either of you notice Benton’s rapid change in mood?’<br />
‘I’m wondering if you brother has bi-polar disorder, Lance.’<br />
Lance wonders if that would explain Benton’s past actions; his sudden and violent tempers, preceding bouts of joy.  Lance Knight looks on with a worried look as Benton introduces the architect that will design the new school.<br />
“I heard that person redesigned the Knight estate,” Andrew quietly states.<br />
“He did,” Lance responds; “Met him once; Benton was pissed that I talked to him. He nearly ripped the contractor’s throat out after; just for being there and privy to Benton’s ire.”<br />
“How come no one knew about this?” Leon Talbot questions.<br />
“Benton paid the man off and made clear of confidentiality clause in the contract he signed;” Lance answers; “In fact every single contract Benton has written up has a confidentiality clause in it; just for such purposes.”<br />
“Well he won’t be able to hide his acts from us any longer,” Andrew answers solemnly.<br />
Lances doesn’t answers as he watches Benton finish his speech by shaking a few hands, smiling like a politician. Both stare at each other for a few intense seconds and then Benton heads back to his flashy car.<br />
“Guess the shows over,” the weredog representative muses.<br />
“Indeed it is,” Andrew responds; “are you coming Lance?”<br />
“No,” I need to head back to the gazette and get this story to print.” Lance referring to the press conference all witnessed. He is about to walk to his car when he gets a text on his phone. Lance looking at the message is quite surprised as to the author. It’s his brother Benton.<br />
‘We need to talk; tonight at the hospital with Amanda. Also, Frieda is supposed to be waiting for you at your gazette but she texted me that she is with her friends. Please check in on her.’<br />
“Now what could this be about,” Lance wonders. Looking up he sees his brother’s car just pulling out and driving away. Lance debates whether or not to respond but then decides to wait. There is a story that needs to be put out; but first a lunch date with an attractive weretigress.</p>
