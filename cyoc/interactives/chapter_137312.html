<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Josh walked she realized she might not be as comfortable being naked in public as she had expected when she&#39;d created this world. Whether because she was still getting used to her new body, or if she had just never really considered what it would mean to bare all she had to all wandering eyes, she couldn&#39;t say. But soon she was fighting the urge to cover herself as she walked down the empty street. Doing her best to remain calm and choke down the embarrassment she felt from exposing her tits and her pussy to the world, only enhanced because she knew no one else would ever suspect, or believe, that she&#39;d only had those tits and that pussy for about an hour. And fighting to keep her concentration because of how aroused she was getting by it.<br />
<br />
With every step, she was reminded of her new body. Every time she moved her legs, the empty space between them was conspicuous. She still expected to feel flesh press against her thighs as they moved, to feel a bounce in her crotch as she stepped. Instead with each step her thighs brushed together with no resistance, and every time her bare feet hit the sidewalk other parts of her body bounced and jiggled. And with the cool air against her hot, soaked snatch she could feel every contour of her new anatomy. It was the most she had really felt what it was to have a pussy since she had accidentally remade herself. Even without looking or using her hands, she knew where both lower lips were exactly, the way their position changed as she moved. the exact positioning of her new love button. She could feel the way she opened up as her legs separated, and then she could feel her walls from the cool air inside her. It was certainly strange, flashing a pussy she was still getting used to, to the whole world.<br />
<br />
It was all she could do to keep her composure as she rounded the corner onto the street where the bus stop would be. It was one thing to walk through a suburb that was almost certainly empty in the middle of the day and deal with the possibility that someone might see her naked body. It was another thing entirely to walk down a busy street and know for certain that all the people in the cars passing by her wouldn&#39;t have to imagine the naked body of the hot girl they saw. She felt her stomach jump and her pussy clench at the thought, and as she continued towards the bus stop, reminding herself that this was normal now, she was sure her juices were dripping onto the sidewalk. <br />
<br />
There was no one else at the bus stop. She hadn&#39;t expected anyone to be there though, It was barely past 11 AM on a weekday. Josh took out her phone as she sat on the bus stop&#39;s bench, her legs just barely long enough for her feet to dangle an inch above the ground as she sat. She felt the cool metal of the bench against her ass cheeks, and was surprised that it wasn&#39;t colder. She couldn&#39;t see the temperature on her phone anymore, but she had expected a metal bench in the beginning of October to be uncomfortable to sit on. They used to be back when she wore pants. Side effect of a world where humans weren&#39;t bothered by temperature, she figured. Of course sitting as she was, was providing another issue. Along with her bare ass, she could also feel the bench against her bare opening. She was already as, or more, turned on than she ever remembered being, and the coolness and pressure of the metal against her lips was all she could focus on as she sat. So she turned, and laid down on the bench. It wouldn&#39;t have worked in the old world, the benches were just barely 5 feet long, intentionally made to be hard to sleep on. But in this world, everything around her felt like it was made for giants, something they meant to be small was just the right size for Josh, and she just barely fit on the bench. <br />
<br />
She started looking through her phone while she waited, checking out apps she didn&#39;t recognize, looking at her browsing history, and reading old texts with people who&#39;d never have given the old Josh their number. Of particular interest to Josh was that apparently the new Stacy thought of her as a good friend, and a good lay. &quot;Heyy sexy! That new girl Jackie? She tastes fucking A-mazing! You&#39;ve totally gotta try her! Doubt her tongue&#39;s as good as mine though. I think even you&#39;re a better pussy eater than she is. ;)&quot; &quot;I&#39;m so horny right now. Mind if I come over and ride your face for awhile? Promise I&#39;ll return the favor.&quot; &quot;Inviting Bryce to my house for some fun. You should come over too and take him up your ass while you eat me out. I know how much you love doing that, and how much you love his dick. :)&quot; <br />
<br />
Josh paused at that one. She was all ready to get some cock in her, but in her ass? She hadn&#39;t considered that an option until now, but it had been one of the ways she&#39;d imagined having sex with her cock when she made the world this way, and something about it did sound hot. And if Stacy said she enjoyed it? Josh turned on the bench and craned her neck to look down at her plump cheeks. Her butt looked like it would be good for anal, at least. Nice round cheeks with plenty of cushion, and this world&#39;s Josh had already done it. She grabbed a handful of ass and started creeping her finger down towards her backdoor before she saw the bus on its way to the stop.<br />
<br />
The bus driver was a large man (as far as Josh&#39;s tiny self could tell) with broad shoulders, a hard jawline with a close shaved, dark beard, dark hair, and not an ounce of fat visible on him. Josh bit her lip as she looked at him, and couldn&#39;t help but be disappointed that his toned legs were hiding his cock from this angle. She stepped toward the bus and looked down at the ground, partly to hide her embarrassment at her first time being seen naked by a stranger, but mostly so she would be sure where she needed to put her feet. The bus looked nearly the size of a building to Josh and from the sidewalk she had to reach her foot up to almost the height of her knee so she could get up the step into it. She felt her pussy open as she did and looked up just in time to catch the bus driver staring right into her opening, and to see just a hint of the tip of his dick peek up as he did. His eyes trailed slowly up her body to meet hers, but her eyes never left the bit of cockhead she could see. Suddenly, she had to see more of it. Her shame temporarily forgotten, Josh pushed her hips forward and spread her legs apart so he could have an unobstructed view. Then leaned back, grabbed her boobs and, in a voice she couldn&#39;t tell if she should try to make more cute or more sultry, moaned out &quot;Mm, you like what you see?&quot; <br />
<br />
In response his dick raised up higher, now enough that she could see the entire head and a bit of the shaft. And he respodned, &quot;Like what I see? Shit, if I didn&#39;t have a route to run I&#39;d bend you right over and fuck you &#39;til you couldn&#39;t think straight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh saw it perfectly in her mind. Her small body scrunched up over the steering wheel or one of the seats, somewhere other girls wouldn&#39;t fit. With this great big stud holding her in place, her ass red and numb from his hips smacking into it and her pussy sore from overuse, and her unable to focus on anything except the big cock pounding her stupid. Every minute she kept being this girl she was getting more and more desperate for dick. She walked up to the bus driver for a better look at the thing she was fantasizing over. Somehow it felt like the first time she&#39;d ever seen one. <br />
<br />
She&#39;d had one only an hour or so ago, but something about the one in front of her. About how she could feel that she didn&#39;t have one anymore. About that she just didn&#39;t have one. She could feel her pulse in her cunt as she looked down at the half-hard stick of man meat in front of her. Looking at it with fresh eyes, something about it seemed just perfect, she could see how it was made specifically for the sake of pumping her holes. It was even getting hard for her. She couldn&#39;t help but take that as a compliment. And she could feel how she couldn&#39;t get one on her own. How it wasn&#39;t really something that belonged to her, even though it was for her. It seemed like it made it special, somehow. She licked her lips and reached a hand down around his shaft, feeling it harden as soon as she touched it. She was so unused to not knowing what a dick felt as it was touched. She pumped him up and down and looked him straight in the eyes. &quot;That&#39;s a shame, because I bet it would have been soo much fun to ride you.&quot;</p>
