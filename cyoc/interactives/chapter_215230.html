<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now snug inside herself and starting to warm up, Erin decided to see what the app had to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erin is appreciative her sheath is warmer on the inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
This sentence was quite true, but maybe she could do something interesting. She smirked at the implications of her upcoming edit, inspired by a television show she watched.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erin is appreciative her sheath is bigger on the inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, she was no longer held in the tight embrace of her own flesh. Turning on the phone&#39;s flashlight, she surveyed her sheath self.<br />
<br />
Her sheath walls were shaped like a cylinder about 10 feet across and 20 feet tall that she was stuck to at the bottom. At the top was a pinching of flesh for her entrance.<br />
<br />
Despite being so much bigger inside, she didn&#39;t feel anything differently in her sheath&#39;s outer skin. The app had made her sheath interior a dimensional anomaly.<br />
<br />
Distracted, she wasn&#39;t paying attention and dropped her phone. Thanks to her downward angle, the phone flew away from her and up, bouncing off the wall and coming to a rest at the top of her interior.<br />
<br />
Erin panicked a bit seeing her phone lying there on her walls with no way to reach it. She couldn&#39;t help but think of Trish&#39;s warning from last night to not lose her phone. With no phone, what would she do?<br />
<br />
She felt like crying. With no phone, she was stuck as one of her enemies&#39; dick and balls. She would never walk on her own two legs again or eat. She had a weird piercing that didn&#39;t let her talk right. She was cursed to vomit up piss and cum every day. The kinky life she created was a permanent nightmare if she had no way out.<br />
<br />
With no path forward, Erin&#39;s eyes watered. She could feel tears landing on her walls and flowing downhill to encircle her phone far out of reach.<br />
<br />
Her phone&#39;s screen shut off, leaving her in complete darkness. If Erin had a stomach, it would have sunk even further. Did her tears somehow get in and destroy the phone? Erin could feel the tugs on her balls and in her length. Trish was walking them who knows where and she has no say in the matter. That was her lot in life now. Who would ever take her seriously any more?<br />
<br />
Trish was talking to someone, and Erin tuned her out. She didn&#39;t want to deal with anything right now.<br />
<br />
After an unknown amount of time just hanging in the darkness Erin calmed down. Her sheath wasn&#39;t that large. Eventually she and the phone would get close enough she could grab it and all would be fine. She wouldn&#39;t be stuck as the partial dog dick of a rainbow centaur for the rest of her life.<br />
<br />
Erin&#39;s world suddenly shifted as Trish sat down. She could feel her tears flowing down the wall and pooling at the bottom, and the phone slid down about halfway. Now gravity was in her favor! Bending forward, she had enough reach she could press on the walls slightly. The phone didn&#39;t budge. She pushed several times trying to disturb the phone enough to come down. She felt like she had almost gotten it to work when Trish laid down. Gravity was no longer going to help.<br />
<br />
Stimulation would help though, as she discovered. Her massaging of her sheath walls made her penis muscle tense and she was now hand-walking up the sheath being pushed from behind.<br />
<br />
As luck would have it her hand landed on the phone and she grabbed it greedily. She was back in business and generated a sentence in celebration.<br />
<br />
&quot;The partial dog dick is happy to have her phone back after she dropped it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Careful to not drop it, she replaced &quot;back&quot; with &quot;tethered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin didn&#39;t notice what changed until she made it to the entrance of her sheath. She had stimulated herself enough she was going to visit the outside world. When her head poked out she went to look around but a tugging on her piercing stopped her. Her arms, still inside the sheath, identified the cause: her phone was now chained to her giant ring. Of all the ways the app could make it happen! She was too emotionally drained to be anything other than happy that she couldn&#39;t be separated from her phone now.<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you doing in there?&quot; Asked Trish. It was pretty weird for your own dick to be exploring itself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;d worry aboud id.&quot; Erin deflected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Erin! Cindy exclaimed and waved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Cindy,&quot; Erin greeted back, &quot;so where are we now?&quot; She addressed to Trish.<br />
<br />
&quot;We just left Cindy&#39;s house, it&#39;s gonna be two hours to the beach.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin wasn&#39;t in control as she kept being pushed out. Trish was lying down on the floor of the limo and Erin was forced to bend to the side just to get enough room. She ended up facing Cindy and decided to make small talk with her to see if there was any recollection of their activities yesterday.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s id going Cindy?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing well, I&#39;m excited to go to the beach, but I&#39;m a bit sore from that saddle yesterday. It still needs breaking in,&quot; Cindy explained. Apparently what happened with the saddle and milk yesterday still happened. Erin decided to probe further.<br />
<br />
&quot;Found any men or stallions to pop your cherry yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Erin!&quot; Trish exclaimed. Cindy shook her head, &quot;I guess I can&#39;t get mad at you for dick questions. It&#39;s the same answer as last time.&quot; Erin took this to mean no.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;f worry, maybe you&#39;ll find one at the beach,&quot; Erin replied with some spur-of-the-moment optimism and patted one of Cindy&#39;s knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Cindy deadpanned.<br />
<br />
With this lull in the conversation, Erin brought her phone up, causing the chain connecting it to her mouth to jingle. The app gave her a sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;The trio are on a relaxing limo ride to the beach.&quot;</p>
