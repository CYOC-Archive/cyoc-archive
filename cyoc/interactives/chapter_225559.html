<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I would like to propose a toast,” Michael Proudhoof getting up with a wine glass in his hoof-hand, as his mate Denise Proudhoof, an Anthro Tigress Fury seductively pawed his fury thigh, managing a makeshift purr in delight at getting an eye view level of his massive balls and impressive sheath his penis calls home. The Anthro Stag-Deer fury smiles as he sees his twin son’s Jimmy and Jake with their mates Allison and Brittany. The two boy also Antro Stag-Deer Furies, while Allison was an Antro Cougar furry and Brittany was an Anthro Gray Wolf Furry. Their parents Edwards Heartpaw; an Anthro Red Fox Furry with his Wife Jullian Heartpaw, an Anthro Cougar Furry; sitting next to them was  Lucas and Rachael Soulfang. Lucas was an Anthro Gray Wolf Furry, while his wife was an Anthro Lioness Fury. Michael watched as the Heartpaws and Soulfangs entered the restaurant and was soon escorted to the private dining room he set aside for this evenings gathering.<br />
<br />
“To families getting together,” Michael smiling as her looks at those before him; “to the bonding of Jimmy with Allison and Jake with Brittany!”<br />
There was a happy applause between the ten furies seated at the table. “May their time together bear many healthy cubs.”<br />
“Dad,” Jimmy blushing; “it’s a bit too soon for us to be planning a family.”<br />
“At least until we enter our heat cycles,” Brittany smiling as she gives her friend Allison a wink.<br />
“I agree with Jimmy,” Jake also blushing; “plus we are only a few furies in a world dominated by humans.”<br />
<br />
“That won’t last,” Denise smiling as she sips her wine glass. She then goes through what her day entailed. Describing how she was able to make the virus airborne. Testing its efficacy with a couple of small scale deployments; she laments that the virus will kill those who are already in poor health, facing a terminal illness or are considered elderly. She theorized this when she infected a Hospice center by using its HVAC ductwork to spread the virus. Her test at the rec center gave her data on how humid air can help accelerate the virus’s spread. Her final test at the hospital helped to confirm her theory on the virus incompatible to those who are not healthy.<br />
“On that front,” Denise pausing; “it will reduce the population of this planet. We are currently sitting at eight billion and change,” Denise speaking to the room who has gone silent; “at least twenty percent of the population fits in to the parameters of old age and poor health.”<br />
“But this is a gift,” Julian feeling sorrow for the first time since she became a furry; “it should be given to all.”<br />
“My virus will do that,” Denise answering; “but I can’t decide who it will uplift or who it will deny.”<br />
“How does it work,” Lucas finding this conversation interesting; “How do you intend to deploy it?”<br />
“Airborne,” Denis responding; “means the virus can infect a person if they breath it in. Once the virus enters a person’s body, their conversion to a furry is inevitable. As for deployment,” Denise smiling; “weather balloons that can enter the jet stream will release the virus into the atmosphere.”<br />
“And it will cover the entire planet soon after,” Edward finding this bombshell shocking; “just how did you come up with this plan?”<br />
“As a member of the CDC and an expert in virology,” Denise looking serious; “I research the most effective ways of a disease’s transmission and I work to create a cure or vaccine that can stop it. Plus after the fall of the Twin Towers,” Denise thinking of the terrorist attack that took place in New York; “the CDC was consulted by the FBI and CIA as well as the Pentagon about possible terrorist attacks that could involve biological material. Material such as Anthrax, Ebola, Black Death and Small Pox,” Denise sipping her wine as she let that nugget of information sink in.<br />
<br />
“This world certainly has become more paranoid,” Michael interrupting the silence, before it makes its ugly return as everyone looks sad.<br />
“Look,” Michael getting up again; “lets not let a hypothetical ruin this fine evening. Plus I managed to prepare a special family recipe for tonight,” Michael leaving the private dining room and heading to the kitchen.<br />
“I wonder what it is,” Allison speaking up; “I haven’t had anything to eat since breakfast. Except for cum and pussy juice,” Allison adding.<br />
“Not at the dinner table daughter,” Julian shaking her head; “we may be horny furies who can cast magic, but we do have a modicum of decency and manners.”<br />
“Sorry,” Allison nibbling on a bread stick; “but didn’t you and dad teach me to be honest?”<br />
“We also taught you to use common sense,” Edward adding; “so there is that to consider.”<br />
<br />
Allison wasn’t able to respond as Michael and several of the wait staff came into the room. Placing plates of pasta in front of each furry. The table salivated at what was in front of them.<br />
“Veal Cannelloni,” Michael speaking; “it is a tube of pasta stuffed with ground veal and ricotta cheese. The sauce is a garlic and tomato based sauce with parmesan cheese cooked into it. There are also diced peppers, mushrooms and sundried tomatoes for added zest.“<br />
“It looks delicious,” Brittany staring at the plate in front of her; grabbing her fork and knife and diving in.<br />
“It tastes divine,” Rachael Soulfang rumbling in approval; the anthro lioness unable to purr, just like her mundane wild counterpart.<br />
“Wait until you taste the dessert,” Jake responding; he knew what his father was cooking all day on top of managing the kitchen. “You’ll swear its better than sex.”<br />
“Now that’s a bold statement,” his mate Brittany chimes in; “don’t be writing cheques your ass will be unable to cash.”<br />
“What does that mean,” Jimmy whispering to Allison as she took a bite of her stuffed pasta.<br />
“Brittany has sex toys,” Allison smiling; “lots of sex toys. Anal beads, strap-ons, vibrators and more.”<br />
Both Brittany and Jake heard that. While Jake was confused by that statement, Brittany flashed a wicked grin as she understood what her BFF just said, and it caused an ideal to pop in her head for later.<br />
<br />
The meal was a pleasant affair followed by more wine and another spirited discussion over Denise’s plan to deploy her airborne virus. The fact that she had a host of doctors and nurses at the now furry controlled hospital to help speed up the manufacturing of the furry gift.<br />
“Two metric tons,” Denise adding; “that is how much is needed to ensure full atmospheric saturation. But with the help of these runes,” Denise raising her wrist to show her runes glowing; “we should be able to reduce the amount by half, while still maintaining target percentages.”<br />
“How long until you make enough,” Jimmy speaking as a waiter collects the empty plates and use cutlery.<br />
“About a week,” Denise answering with a wicked grin; “and another week afterwards before we start seeing spontaneous outbreaks in every city, every country.”<br />
“That will cause mass panic,” Edward Heartpaw responding; “won’t people get violent?”<br />
“If they do,” Michael answering; “then I won’t blame the furry using their claw, hoofs or talons to defend themselves.”<br />
“Mass panic is to be expected,” Denise nodding; “People will get desperate and start getting violent. Thinking that the end times are upon them. Governments will collapse,” Denise adding; “but society will persevere. It will just be us furrys picking up the pieces.”<br />
<br />
Before more could be debated on the subject, the wait staff came back in to present dessert.<br />
“Chocolate lava cake with a caramel rum mousse,” Michael speaking as the plates of dessert where passed around; “I only ever had this dessert on the menu once. I’m thinking of bringing it back but on a regular basis.”<br />
“Oooooooooo,” Jullian drooling as she took her dessert spoon and took the first bite; she swoons as the combination of rum, caramel and chocolate dance on her tongue. Eliciting a harmonious blend of sweet with the subtle tartness that the rum has provided. “Ed darling, I want you to ride me so hard I want to wake up tomorrow still knotted to you,” Jullian uttering as she paces a hand paw on his package; a clear indication that she wants him in her.<br />
“Well it’s not hard to see that you are in the mood,” Edward smiling as he nibbles on the dessert. While not a huge fan of sweet sugary desserts, the fox furry did find this concoction pleasing on the palette.<br />
<br />
“We’ll that is something I’d like to discuss,” Michael smiling. “While I will only breed with my mate Denise here,” Michael sparing a glance at the tigress furry; “that shouldn’t mean we be exclusively monogamous. If everyone is willing, barring my sons and their mates,” Michael winking at the two couples; “I propose we have a partner swap sex fest. But only during special events like tonight,” Michael adding; “and with advance notice.”<br />
“I’m down with that,” Lucas looking at his mate; “what about you Rachael?”<br />
“So long as we all sample each other’s partner,” Rachael licking her lips at the thought of shoving her muzzle up the anthro Tigress’s cunt; “both genders, no regrets.”<br />
“I think Jimmy and I shall have a stroll as you six have your orgy,” Allison feeling embarrassed at the thought of her parents bumping uglies with her mate’s and BBF’s parents.<br />
“Can Jake and I join you,” Brittany asking; “I want to walk in the forest and possibly spend the night having an intimate moment with my mate.”<br />
“Go on you four,” Julian smiling; “mate under the stars. Tonight you Allison and you Brittany are a Heartpaw and Soulfang respectively. Tomorrow, you’ll be Proudhoofs.”<br />
“Oh I forgot to mention,” Allison smiling; “Brittany and I are hyphenating. “I’ll be Heartpaw-Proudhoof.”<br />
“And I’ll be Soulfang-Proudhoof,” Brittany smiling as well; “but our future cubs will have the Proudhoof name.”</p>
