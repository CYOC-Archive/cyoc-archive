<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emile finally spotted some potential targets when he heard a baby wailing. He turned to see a baby sitting in a stroller crying next to two late 20 something parents who looked pissed. The two were yelling at one another fiercely, likely involving the baby, but neither were comforting the poor child.<br />
<br />
The father was a blond haired thin stick of a man while the woman was a brunette beauty on the chubbier side. Emile decided to listen in and heard a bit of their argument. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean you FORGOT his diapers?! How could you possibly forget them?!&quot; The wife screamed to her flustered husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not just my fault! You were supposed to remind me remember?!&quot; He defended.<br />
<br />
This continued as it slowly spiraled out of hand all the while the baby continued to cry. Emile gave &quot;his wife&quot; a knowing glance and Ricki just nodded. Emile turned back, lifted the camera, and took a picture of the couple and the child. Emile watched the changes and was still amazed by how quickly they happened. If he blinked he likely would&#39;ve missed most of it.<br />
<br />
The husband shot down to a relatively short heigh almost under 5 feet. His blond hair grew past his shoulders and then immediately tied itself up into a ponytail. His chest practically exploded as his shorts became skinny jeans. Meanwhile The wife&#39;s hair sprouted a ton as it covers her entire body. Her figure was temporarily obscured by the hair until it could be seen again from the new fur as a brunette english sheep dog on a leash. The baby&#39;s change was the most drastic as he popped out of the stroller as it disappeared and his height skyrocketed close to his former father&#39;s old height. He aged up from 2 to 10 to 20 in a few seconds as his muscles grew as well.<br />
<br />
Glancing down, the picture that came out showed the couple walking their dog. Emile was initially satisfied with the changes until he noticed that the new couple still didn&#39;t look happy. They were quieter than before without the baby but they were clearly still having a more restrained argument. <br />
<br />
&quot;I just don&#39;t see why we need one right now.&quot; The former infant sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean &quot;we don&#39;t need one?&quot; It&#39;s a baby Charlie. It&#39;s not needed it&#39;s a little blessing and we need to experience that.&quot; The former man sighed, simultaneously scratching her former wife&#39;s ear. <br />
<br />
The argument continued as Emile watched in annoyance. Emile turned back to the former Rick and he, or rather she, looked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong, uh, Ricki?&quot; Emile said, almost saying Rick instead of Ricki.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were gonna change that couple having an argument over there?&quot; She answered concerned. <br />
<br />
&quot;I did actually. That dog used to be the wife, to that woman who was a man, and that guy was their kid. They were originally having an argument about the guy forgetting diapers or something.&quot; Emile replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s hilarious!&quot; Ricki chuckled. &quot;The guy doesn&#39;t want a baby and yet he was the baby. And that lady is all baby hungry and yet when she was a dad she, or he was awful. I don&#39;t think that woman deserves to be a dog though.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
Emile agreed that this scenario was not ideal, and although he wanted to fix it he didn&#39;t know how. He can revert them back to normal at anytime but their old lives seemed worse. &quot;Maybe I should try mixing someone else into the mix to try and change things for the better.&quot; He thought as he spotted a janitor walking by the couple. Emile reacted quickly and took another shot of the family, this time with another person mixed in.<br />
<br />
The changes happened almost faster now as each changed again. The man, former baby, de-aged. At first Emile thought he&#39;d be a baby again, but instead he stopped at around 5. His light brown hair grew out and then became styled in pigtails as his clothes became a little pink dress. The woman, former man, shrunk immediately down smaller than the new little girl. Her clothes changed to a pink onesie as she de-aged into infancy and a stroller appeared around her. The dog&#39;s, former woman&#39;s, hair retracted as her body morphed back into a human form. A t-shirt and shorts formed as her breasts vanished. Her hair on her head shortened as he clearly became a 30 something he judging by the crotch. The janitor&#39;s uniform vanished, replaced by a spring dress while his black hair curled past his shoulders. His chest grew decent breasts as his ass expanded, and instead of pushing a janitor cart, she was now pushing the stroller.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy?&quot; The little girl asked. &quot;Can I have some juice?&quot; <br />
<br />
The former janitor smiled and knelt down to give her a kiss. &quot;Of course you can Charolette. As soon as we get back to the van.&quot; <br />
<br />
The happy family strolled off as Emile smiled. The family looked much happier now. The baby will still get to grow up and the janitor gets a better job, while the wife gets a nicer spouse and that guy can try again, hopefully growing up to be a better woman than she was a father. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you change that family?&quot; Ricki asked confused. Emile chuckled as he handed the camera back to Ricki. He felt good, and figured after Ricki&#39;s next choice in the mall he&#39;d change Ricki back to Rick. Ricki just shrugged it off as she eyed the mall for potential people.</p>
