<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny pushed open Jake’s bedroom door, her stomach churning as she stepped inside. She knew this wasn’t going to be easy, but seeing Jake now—a smaller, younger version of herself—made her hesitate. He was perched on the edge of the bed, his legs dangling, staring blankly at his reflection in the mirror. His long, dark curls spilled over his shoulders, and his small hands fidgeted with the hem of the pink nightgown their mom had left him in.<br />
<br />
“Jake,” Jenny said softly, stepping closer.<br />
<br />
His head snapped up, his eyes wide and glassy. “Jenny?” His voice was small, almost shrill, and full of panic. “What… what the hell is going on? Why do I look like you?” His hands gestured wildly at his face and body. “I… I feel weird. Wrong.”<br />
<br />
Jenny sighed and sat down beside him. “Okay, listen. Mom… Mom did this. She used that medallion she found to swap us—change our bodies and ages. You’re me. Well, 9-year-old me. And I’m you—your younger self.”<br />
<br />
Jake’s mouth hung open as he shook his head. “No. No way. That’s insane! Why would she do this?!” His voice cracked as he clutched the fabric of the nightgown. “Why am I you? And why do I feel so… so weird?”<br />
<br />
Jenny could relate. She still hadn’t gotten used to the unfamiliar weight between her legs or the way her smaller, leaner body moved differently. “Yeah, I know,” she said, her voice quieter. “It feels all wrong, like you’re not in your own skin. But you’ll adjust. You kind of have to.”<br />
<br />
Jake’s hands balled into fists, his face flushing. “Adjust? Jenny, I have your… your body! I don’t know how to… I don’t even know how to be a girl!” He looked at her, panicked. “And… and I have to pee, but I don’t even know how to do that!”<br />
<br />
Jenny winced, feeling a fresh wave of awkwardness. “Okay, okay, don’t freak out. I’ll help you, alright? Come on.” She stood up and motioned for him to follow her.<br />
<br />
Jake hesitated, looking down at himself again. “This isn’t happening,” he muttered under his breath.<br />
<br />
“It is happening,” Jenny said, tugging at his arm. “And sitting here isn’t gonna help.”<br />
<br />
She led him to the bathroom, and after an awkward series of explanations and demonstrations, Jake managed to figure it out. He was red-faced and humiliated the entire time, muttering under his breath about how unfair it was. Jenny, meanwhile, couldn’t ignore how strange it felt to help her brother navigate her body.<br />
<br />
When they switched places, Jake stepped aside explaining how to pee as a boy as Jenny started to pull down her boy shorts. She hated it. The act itself was simple, but touching the dick, a part of her body that shouldn’t exist was disconcerting. Yet, by the time she was done, she couldn’t deny a small, guilty thought: This is actually a lot easier.<br />
<br />
Jake stood in the corner, glaring at her. “Enjoying yourself?” he muttered.<br />
<br />
Jenny flushed, pulling up her shorts. “Shut up. I’m just saying it’s… efficient.” She turned to him, folding her arms. “You’re gonna have to deal with it for now. We’ve got bigger problems.”<br />
<br />
Jake looked like he was about to argue, but then he caught sight of the dress their mom had left for him. His eyes widened in horror. “No. No way. I’m not wearing that.”<br />
<br />
Jenny raised an eyebrow. “You want to walk around in a nightgown all day?”<br />
<br />
Jake scowled. “I’d rather wear nothing.”<br />
<br />
Jenny snorted. “Yeah, good luck explaining that to Mom. Or Dad…” Her voice trailed off, and she suddenly remembered something important.<br />
<br />
Jake’s expression shifted. “What do you mean ‘Dad’? What are you talking about?”<br />
<br />
Jenny took a deep breath, bracing herself. “So… Mom didn’t just change us. She… she turned herself into Dad.”<br />
<br />
Jake froze, his eyes narrowing. “What? That doesn’t make sense. Dad’s… Dad’s gone. How could she…?”<br />
<br />
“She used the medallion,” Jenny explained, her voice steady but laced with unease. “She found one of Dad’s old shirts and turned herself into him. I guess she thought it’d be… nice. Like having him back, even if it’s just her in his body.”<br />
<br />
Jake’s face contorted with a mix of anger and confusion. “Why would she do that? That’s so—so screwed up! And now she’s walking around looking like him?!”<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded. “Yeah, and it’s weird. Like, really weird. She even acts like him. It’s freaky how much she’s leaning into it.”<br />
<br />
Jake stared at her, his breathing quick and shallow. “I… I don’t know if I can deal with this.”<br />
<br />
Jenny softened, putting a hand on his shoulder. “Look, I know it’s a lot. I freaked out too, okay? But she’s still Mom. She’s just… wearing Dad’s body.”<br />
<br />
Jake shuddered. “That doesn’t make it any better.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe not,” Jenny admitted. “But we’ve got to get through this somehow. Now, come on. Let’s get you dressed.”<br />
<br />
Jake glared at the dress again but finally relented. Jenny helped him into it, smoothing out the fabric and tying the sash in the back. “There,” she said, stepping back. “Not so bad, right?” with Jenny archly surprised how cute he looks.<br />
<br />
Jake grumbled. “It’s humiliating.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well, unless you’ve got a stash of 9-year-old boy clothes somewhere, this is it,” Jenny said.<br />
<br />
She grabbed a brush and Jakes arm and started working on Jake’s hair, despite his protests and attempts to bat her hands away. “Stop squirming,” she snapped. “You’re acting like a little kid.”<br />
<br />
Jake sighed, slumping in defeat. “Fine. Just get it over with.”<br />
<br />
When she was finished, Jake looked at her, his expression grudgingly neutral. “You’re acting like some bossy older brother,” he muttered.<br />
<br />
Jenny smirked. “Guess I kind of am now, huh?”<br />
<br />
Jake rolled his eyes but didn’t argue.<br />
<br />
When they finally went downstairs, Jake froze at the sight of their dad—well, their mom in their dad’s body—standing at the sink, washing dishes. The man’s broad shoulders, easy movements, and familiar hum sent a shock of emotions coursing through Jake’s small frame.<br />
<br />
“Dad?” he whispered, his voice cracking.<br />
<br />
The man turned, smiling warmly. “Hey there, kiddo,” he said. “Looking good, Jake. Or should I say Jenny?”<br />
<br />
Jake’s lip trembled, and tears spilled down his cheeks as he broke into a sob.<br />
<br />
Their dad—Mom—crossed the room in a few quick strides and scooped Jake up into his arms, holding him tightly. “Hey, hey, it’s okay,” he said gently, his deep voice resonating in Jake’s ears. “I’ve got you. It’s gonna be alright.”<br />
<br />
Jake buried his face in the man’s chest, hating how much he wanted to stay there. The warmth, the strength, the smell—it was all Dad. But it wasn’t, and that made it worse.<br />
<br />
“I miss him,” Jake choked out.<br />
<br />
“I know, buddy,” their mom said softly, stroking his curls. “I miss him too. That’s why I thought this might help. I know I’m not really him, but I can be him for a while. Just for you two.”<br />
<br />
Jake nodded weakly, clinging tighter. Jenny stood in the doorway, watching with a strange mix of emotions she couldn’t quite name.</p>
