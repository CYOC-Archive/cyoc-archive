<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Credit goes to the The_Doctor over at thechangingmirror for writing this</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When all the students filed out of the class, the remaining girls sat in their seats until it was the teacher and the girls. They all sat in the room in awkward silence. They didn&#39;t know whether or not say something to break the ice or not. The room was so quiet that the faint sounds of the buzz from the florescent lights from above could be heard. The silence was almost deafening! It wasn&#39;t until Ms. Sunderland finally broke the painful silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well, well, the girl from Alpha Delta Chi. Seven sleepy girls in my class.&quot; She said before walking over to locking the door. She walked back over, breasts jiggling in her top as she sat down on the edge of her desk with a seductive leg cross. It was easy for her considering that she had legs that could stop a train! <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry Ms. Sunderland, I&#39;m not sure what came over us.&quot; Harmony said with a genuinely sympathetic tone. &quot;I don&#39;t usually fall sleep in classes!&quot; She said from her desk. The rest of the girls probably would have given different excuses. Whether it be, they didn&#39;t get enough sleep the night before, too much to drink, or just pure laziness. Harmony was the only one who actually would be sincere about her excuse. <br />
<br />
Ms. Sunderland only nodded. &quot;Now, I understand that Sex Education isn&#39;t the most thrilling subject to learn, seeing as you are all grown and developed women...&quot; She slightly paused looking Shelby oozing out of her tube top. &quot;...but you all have to take this seriously. I will not tolerate sleeping in my classroom. Under any excuse...&quot; She said beaming at Harmony. <br />
<br />
The girls were mostly silent. Subtly rolling their eyes or trying not to fall asleep again. &quot;What do you all have to say for yourself?&quot; She added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck lady, we were just asleep. What is the big deal?&quot; Aimee said leaning back in her chair. The girls in front of her looked back at her. <br />
<br />
Aimee almost expected backlash and Ms. Sunderland to loose it, but found out she was wrong! Ms. Sunderland only smiled. This is turn made Aimee have a chill run up her spine. &quot;Aimee, correct? The deal is, I&#39;m here to educate you all. Maybe it isn&#39;t the most thrilling subject. Maybe it isn&#39;t the subject you want to particularly learn, given your ages. But this is simply something you are going to have to deal with. No ifs, ands, or buts.” <br />
<br />
Some of the girls let out grumbles as Ms. Sunderland only shook her head. “I truly do not understand. Where as you fine girls fall asleep in my class, the rest of my students were awake and alert. They were paying attention!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it&#39;s because the rest of the students were horny boys looking at your massive tits!” Aimee found the courage to say. The rest of the girls were thinking it, but were shocked to hear Aimee have the guts to say it out loud. After all, it was true. <br />
<br />
Ms. Sunderland sighed. “You know girls. I was going to let you off easy...” The room almost got cold there was such an intensity. Ms. Sunderland only sat on the edge of her seat. “I was going to give you all a stern talking to, but I think something a little more drastic is in order.”<br />
<br />
Harmony looked at Aimee. “Way to go Aimee! Now you got us all in trouble.”<br />
<br />
Ms. Sunderland chuckled. “It only takes one bad apple to spoil the barrel.” She smiled coldly. There was certainly something about her and the smiles that she gave that made the girls feel uneasy. Though it was safe to say that “uneasy” was putting it lightly. <br />
<br />
“From what it sounds like, a stern talking to just won&#39;t cut it. I think something needs to change around here. Primarily in Alpha Delta Chi itself.” Ms. Sunderland said.<br />
<br />
“W-what does that mean?” Harmony said almost not wanting to hear what she had to say. <br />
<br />
“Harmony.” Ms. Sunderland started. “You seem like such a sweet girl with a great head on her shoulders. From what I understand, you&#39;re more of the leader of this little group of girls? Am I correct?” Harmony looked at her with a little confusion, but eventually nodded her head.<br />
<br />
Ms. Sunderland nodded back. “And from what I hear, you&#39;re an amazing cook?”<br />
<br />
“I am...but...how did you know that?” She asked now officially confused. <br />
<br />
“I have my ways.” Ms. Sunderland stated. “Now when I mean change, I mean, actual change. You girls need a makeover. Now I&#39;m not saying that this will be necessarily a bad thing, just a...necessary thing.” She smiled.<br />
<br />
Eva finally pipped up. “The fuck you on about &#39;changing us&#39;. You don&#39;t expect to actually change us?” She asked. The girls were pretty sure she was just trying to scare them all. But in the back of their minds, they couldn&#39;t help but feel she was 100 percent serious. <br />
<br />
“Oh, I mean, literal change. Both mentally and physically. I can do that.” She smiled almost evilly. “Now before I was rudely interrupted, I was speaking with Harmony.” After this was said, there was a hush that fell over the room. Almost as if the girls couldn&#39;t talk back.<br />
<br />
“Harmony. Always the goody goody, always the head of the house hold. Nothing wrong with being a great cook, so I think we&#39;ll be keeping that. But I think you should be more, oh how should I put it, stepfordish.” She smiled. “Good cook, keeps the house clean, very stay at home. Who needs school when you&#39;re the mom of the house!” She smiled as Harmony even slowly nodded her head almost as if in a trance. <br />
<br />
Her attention when to Aimee, the girl who had the balls to speak up to her. “Aimee. Not much can be said about you other than the fact you wish to be an actress. But with an attitude like yours, there is only one type of acting gig you need.”<br />
<br />
“Lynn. I almost feel bad because you have been awfully quiet. But that&#39;s just your nature isn&#39;t it? Just sort of sit in the corner and let everyone else do the talking. I say we give that a change, don&#39;t you agree?” <br />
<br />
“Kaia and Lily. Two sisters that should always get along, but you all just can&#39;t get along. Always bickering and arguing. And over very silly things. Sisters should love one another, especially if they are twins.”<br />
<br />
“Evangeline, or excuse me, Eva.” She smiled and chuckled. “You stand out among these girls. Sure you house is diverse, but you stand out in other ways as well. You often feel so much confidence in yourself, but you never want to express it.”<br />
<br />
And the finally, Shelby was the last one to get a one on one with Ms. Sunderland. “Shelby. Poor girl starting out in Alpha Delta Chi in such a skimpy little top. Clearly your boobs are the biggest in the house. I say you should be even bigger! In more ways than one.” She winked.<br />
<br />
After she was done talking, there was almost like a wave of energy, almost like a jolt went through all the girls. They snapped out of their odd dream like trance.<br />
<br />
“Girls? Girls?!” All of them seemed to shake their heads in confusion. They looked around and saw that the class was empty, except for the teacher. “Are we awake now?” She said sounding a little more stern.<br />
<br />
“Wait what?” Harmony asked. “Were we asleep?” She asked speaking for the girls. <br />
<br />
“Yes, you were, all seven of you! I have to say that I&#39;m a little disappointed in you all. I have a right mind to keep you after class!” Ms. Sunderland said crossing her arms making that valley of cleavage that much deeper. <br />
<br />
“Wait...didn&#39;t you want to see us after class?” Eva spoke up.<br />
<br />
Ms. Sunderland only shook her head. “Class just ended. All the students just left.” She paused as the girls slowly got up and gathered their things. <br />
<br />
“I&#39;m so sorry we fell asleep in your class. It won&#39;t happen again.” Harmony said as they all filed out of the class. <br />
<br />
Once the girls had all left the room, Ms. Sunderland smiled. “Oh it won&#39;t happen again. Next time I see you all, you&#39;ll be completely different people.”</p>
