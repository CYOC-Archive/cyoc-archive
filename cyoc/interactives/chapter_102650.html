<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I dare you to lick a different pussy everyday and you will get horny from looking at girls and especially vagina&#39;s although you are still hetero sexual your pussy is a lesbian. I dare you to listen to the needs of your pussy and I dare you to never orgasm again without lesbian interaction. You will hang up the phone and will not remember this conversation.<br />
<br />
Hmm now what was I doing again? I said to myself as I hung up the phone. Never mind, I just need my panties and socks and I&#39;m off. <br />
As I was looking for my panties, I saw my naked vagina in the mirror, suddenly I found myself examining my own vagina in the mirror. My small outer lips looked like a mouth to kiss. Slightly parted between the gap of my thighs. I have seen it al million times, but looking at it , not her, now, made me blush and a little aroused even. I wanted to touch my bare lips but I saw my thong and brushed the feeling off and slid on my thong. <br />
<br />
I quickly finished dressing myself and went to the bus. Once in the bus I looked for my friend Amy so we could discuss the day. As I sat next to Amy I couldn&#39;t help but glance at the small amount of cleavage. Her breasts weren&#39;t that big, but because of her movement and the ill fitting dress I could spot a bit of her nipple. Again I felt myself becoming aroused and I squirmed a bit in my seat as I felt my vagina warming up and becoming a little moist. Amy kept rambling about the boys in class and how stupid they were. As I was struggling with myself why I felt what I felt. <br />
<br />
When we were at school we discovered that mister Toms was ill and we had to study by ourselves. So we went to the courtyard to sit outside. Amy was sitting on the opposite bench of me with her legs crossed because of her small dress. She didn&#39;t want any boys to look at her panties. But when she moved her legs I was sure to look straight between her legs. I could see her thong! This got me really excited and I again felt my juices warming up my vagina. She closed her legs again and looked at me quizzical. &quot;What&#39;s wrong Jenny? You look a little flushed.&quot; Amy said to me. I replied that there was &quot;nothing wrong, maybe a little hot. I&#39;ll freshen up in the toilets.&quot; To my dismay, Amy replied that she was going to join me to have a whizz. Damnit! I wanted to be alone, i thought to myself.<br />
<br />
We entered the toilet and closed the door. As we were the only two in here Amy opened a stall door and left it open as she hiked up her dress and pulled down her small pink thong. I looked directly at her small vaginalips as she quickly sat down. I heard her peeing, &quot;fssssshhh&quot; as I kept staring at her. Thinking about those small lips did not look appealing to me, but my pussy was eager. I have never been so moist looking at another girl. What the hell is wrong with me! She is my friend! And I don&#39;t like pussies! I like men! Not women!<br />
<br />
Jen! Why are you looking at me like that? Are you sure you are allright? Amy said as she was still peeing. I could only concentrate on what was hidden between her legs. I wanted to see it, I needed to see it. I was wondering why, but already my mind was making excuses to Amy to let me see her vagina. I felt a need to look at it, maybe even touch it a little. Still my mind was shouting back at me that vagina&#39;s are disgusting, you don&#39;t even like your own vagina! But still, I have to see it!<br />
<br />
Uuhhm Amy? I don&#39;t know how to ask you this, but... I have been having problems with my, uuhmm my, you know what. (as I pointed at my vagina). I turned beet red! As did Amy. She was dribbling her last bit of pee and went on wiping herself. Again I had a brief moment to look at her small lips, before she pulled up her thong again. She looked at me and asked what was wrong with my vagina?  <br />
<br />
I think it doesn&#39;t smell nice. I lied. I am afraid I will scare boys away. I said, turning even a darker shade of red. But I felt my pussy juice almost dribbling out of my vagina onto my thong. <br />
<br />
Amy replied as I hoped she would: &quot;well I&#39;m sure its nothing. If you want, I could look at it? If you give me your panties, I could see if there is anything wrong.&quot; <br />
<br />
As soon as she said it, I slipped out op my thong and presented the dull white thong to Amy. There was a little moist spot in the middel of the cloth and Amy looked at me. She asked me if I lost a little fluid. Yes I answered. Slowly she brought her hands with my thong to her nose as she carefully took a little whif... She looked at me and said that there was &quot;nothing wrong, smells just like mine I guess&quot;. &quot;Smell yourself&quot;. As I took my thong back I looked at it and sniffed it as well. It smelled a little like pee and a bit salty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I smell yours? I know it&#39;s weird but I am really uncomfortable not knowing&quot;. I asked. Amy looked a bit holden back but then she hied up her skirt again and stepped out of her thong and handed it to me. I sniffed it and again I smelled the dirty salty smell like my own vagina.  But my pussy was driving on all cilinders. I could feel my arousal speeding up. Knowing that in front of me Amy was wearing no panties and I was holding her dirty thong. My juices had reached my lips and slowly a little escaped my pussy. She was wanting more. <br />
<br />
So, can I have my panties back? Or do we have to go through some more experiments? Amy asked me. I didn&#39;t know what to say! My pussy wanted more, I could feel it. I heard myself saying: &quot;your thong is still pretty fresh, maybe I could take a little peek to your vagina? You can see mine if you want too?&quot; I asked carefully. Amy looked at me in shock. But then she said: &quot;why not, nothing new since we shower together, right?&quot; <br />
<br />
She hiked her skirt up and stood in front of me while I sat down on one knee. I looked at her small slit and my juices started running down my leg. I looked up at Amy&#39;s face and asked if I may touch it before I took a sniff. She said it was ok. As I carefully placed my index finger on her lips I could feel my pussy quirming as another drop of my juices flowed down my thighs. <br />
<br />
As I touched her lips, I could feel a little moisture between her outer lips. I looked up again and Amy was beet red. &quot;Don&#39;t worry I said, it&#39;s just hot in here, can I take a small sniff now?&quot; As she agreed I slowly found my nose closing up ons her pussy. As my nose touched her vagina I took a little sniff. As I smelled again the smell I first smelled when I had my nose on her thong. Suddenly I felt the need to lick her organ. I didn&#39;t want to! But I needed to! As my mouth was allready close to her lips, I found my tong escaping my mouth and gave her vagina a small lick. I felt my arousal almost peaking as my pussy started throbbing. I could almost feel it opening up. As at the same time I felt disgusted as I tasted her pussy! I have just licked another girls vagina! Why am I doïng this! The taste was nothing I ever tasted but the same as the smell. I was conflicted as my mouth and brain did not want to go anywhere near that thing again. But the pleasure that was emanating from my own vagina was hard to ignore. I had to continue! Or else I could not even breathe!<br />
<br />
Amy let out a little yelp. So I looked up. I looked at her shocked face but then her expression changed to a little confused look as she said: &quot;I did not know you were into this Jenny, I have never done this before. But seeing you on your knees with your face glued to my pussy makes me want to let you continue&quot;. <br />
<br />
I looked at her vagina again, I didn&#39;t want to but I found myself...</p>
