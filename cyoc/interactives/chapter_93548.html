<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David ran downstairs to pay the manager, Vickie and he had decided to go back to the portal to try to sort things out. If all went well, they&#39;d be on their flight tonight and Vickie would be back as a girl before they touched down back home. At least that was the plan. She hoped it was going to be that simple.<br />
<br />
As Vickie paced around the room, she couldn&#39;t help but look at herself in the mirror. It was so weird to look and see a person she didn&#39;t recognize. Even though she was &quot;technically&quot; male now, she still felt like her old self. <br />
<br />
She sighed and sat back down on the bed, she&#39;d ended up having to wear her dad&#39;s boxers along with a pair of his shorts, with a belt pulled VERY tightly to make it work. Even though she was a guy now, she was still only 13. She wasn&#39;t nearly as big as her dad and his stuff didn&#39;t fit great. The t-shirt he&#39;d gotten her had worked out well. It was long enough to cover her torso, it just looked a bit silly since she was fairly thin and lanky.<br />
<br />
Suddenly her head started to twinge again. &quot;Oh for the love of...what else can you do?&quot; she muttered angrily. She&#39;d had her fill of this feeling and she would be glad to do without it for the rest of her life.<br />
<br />
The sensation stayed centered in her head, and she wondered if a part of her face was still feminine. That was the only thing she could think of that would stay foc...<br />
<br />
And suddenly the pain was their again, focused in her head. But this time it felt more like her...mind was hurting. It was a deeper pain than before, and she immediately realized what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No! No!! Not my thoughts! Not my mind! Pleeeease!!&quot; she was weeping.<br />
<br />
The pain ignored her requests and protests, and she started to feel herself slip away, the pain not quite removing her, but molding her and shaping her into more of a HIM.<br />
<br />
She faded away for a second, and felt herself floating for a minute. It was a most peculiar experience that she couldn&#39;t remember having before.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Sup?&quot; she heard in a strangely familiar voice.<br />
<br />
She turned and saw...herself. Or at least the new her. In this new world she couldn&#39;t quite focus, the pain was too intense, but she could at least make that out.<br />
<br />
There were subtle differences though, whereas she could really only define herself at the moment as kind of thin and wimpy looking, this guy looked much more like the guys in school she had a crush on. He was a little bit taller, with a slight tan going on and he&#39;d been hitting the gym or puberty had done well for him. He had nicely toned muscles and his features were just a little bit more masculine than her&#39;s currently were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm...hi? Who are y...Uggghhhh...&quot; she started to ask,<br />
<br />
&quot;Serious pain? Yeah that sounds rough, sorry I&#39;m doing that to ya.&quot; he said with a small shrug and sad look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait....this is all you?&quot; Vickie exclaimed, breaking through the pain in a quick spurt of anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, all me.&quot; the newcomer said. &quot;The name&#39;s Vince, and I think you&#39;re about gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vickie paused for a second, &quot;What do you...mean? Gone?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vince sighed, &quot;Look, I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on really. All I know is that I woke up a few days ago and I&#39;ve been kind of here for this whole process. As far as I can tell, I&#39;m your new personality. Essentially, the new you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m rather fond of the CURRENT me!&quot; Vickie yelled. &quot;You can&#39;t just replace my personality!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vince looked down sheepishly, &quot;It&#39;s already happening, I&#39;m not DOING it...I can&#39;t control it. Why do you think it hurts so much? I&#39;m being forced, physically and mentally into your body!&quot;<br />
<br />
As he said that, Vickie&#39;s head exploded into pain, and she collapsed with her head in her hands floating in the air. &quot;Please!! Don&#39;t...stop it!&quot;<br />
<br />
But it was all in vain, as Vince had mentioned he seemed to be just as unable to control himself as she was unable to control her pain. Some force was pushing him into her and the pain was unbearable. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!&quot; Vince yelled out before he seemed to vanish.<br />
<br />
Vickie couldn&#39;t explain the next part if she&#39;d had to, everything just seemed to merge and fuse in the screeching pain of Vince&#39;s essence merging with her&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Immediately she felt her mind resist, memories took different tones and contexts as Vince&#39;s personality tried washed over her. The more she fought it, the more than pain seemed to come from within her. As the pain washed over her, a single thought rose to her mind. &quot;What if I just let it wash over me?&quot; she thought. Tentatively, she let part of her mind be washed away instead of resisting...and the most amazing feeling of pleasant &quot;nothingness&quot; swept over her. After the pain, the nothingness was bliss...she tried to do smaller bits at a time until  all at once the mental dam she had been fortifying was swept away. <br />
<br />
Vince started to feel himself awaken as well, the pleasure of existence, of meaning was washing over Vickie&#39;s resistance. Memories of Vickie&#39;s crushes became memories that Vince&#39;s personality ignored, the flame of passion ignored but a potential for male friendship awoken. Inversely, Vickie&#39;s best friends awoken a desire in Vince that Vickie felt as well, sensations that were alien to her before and were now being awoken in new ways. Most of Vickie&#39;s interests were swept away, Vince&#39;s interests taking over and rising to the forefront. Vince wasn&#39;t exactly a new person, it was still &quot;Vickie&quot; but a Vickie that enjoyed her new form, enjoyed being male. New thoughts and feelings were awakening in Vickie, replacing her old ones and bringing the new &quot;Vince&quot; thoughts in instead. <br />
<br />
While this was all going on, David had returned to the hotel room finding Vickie unable to wake up. &quot;Vickie!! Vickie!!&quot; he was exclaiming to try and wake her up. Shaking his daughter/son he noticed as the eyes slowly began to open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank goodness, Vickie are you alright?&quot; David was sighing in relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, that was intense. God...my head still hurts.&quot; Vickie stated, holding her head in her hands and breathing deeply.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened this time? You were already fully male I thought!&quot; David was looking out of his depth at this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;This one was more...internal I guess. I&#39;m kinda digging the new looks now actually! Just look at me! I&#39;ve got muscles and I&#39;m not as short anymore! Heck I look better than most of the guys at school while I was only average as a girl!&quot; Vickie had jumped up and run over to the mirror by this point. &quot;It&#39;s totally awesome! I can&#39;t wait to see my friends!&quot; he said with a slight grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...I&#39;m sorry what? What are you talking about Vickie?&quot; David was saying. He looked a bit confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s make it Vince ok? Vickie&#39;s not gonna work now that I&#39;m a guy Dad...c&#39;mon get with the program. And seriously, haven&#39;t you seen Brenda? She&#39;s going to be totally into me. I&#39;m totally her type, she digs actual blondes.&quot; Vince was looking carefree as he laid back down on the bed and crossed his legs. &quot;Can we grab something to eat? I&#39;m starving after all that crap...&quot;<br />
<br />
David just stared opening, mouth slightly agape as the reality hit him. Apparently his &quot;son&quot; was completely fine with this new change now. He realized he felt a little bit ashamed, there was a part of him that was interested in raising a son. He&#39;d been blessed with three daughters, but never a son. The other two girls were too young to have come with him, but maybe this was how it was supposed to be? Vickie...er...Vince sure seemed happy, would it be wrong to not try and fix this?<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me a few minutes...I need to lie down myself now.&quot; David muttered to his new son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good Dad, also...can we grab some new clothes? These are kinda big...&quot;</p>
