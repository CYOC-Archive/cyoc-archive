<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Because,” Franklin said, smirking at you with an almost defiant quality, “We&#39;re going to outnumber them soon.”<br />
<br />
“We are?” you ask, confused.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes,” he said with a nod. “Within our dorm, we have twenty werewolves. Twenty virile males, including yourself. On the other side of campus, there&#39;s an equivalent hall for female werewolves, with similar numbers.”<br />
<br />
“How many hunters are there in the world, though?” you asked.<br />
<br />
“It doesn&#39;t really matter,” Franklin replied. “Because you see, Ian, lycanthropy is a gift, and we&#39;re going to show everyone how wonderful that gift is.”<br />
<br />
“Uh..what?” you asked.<br />
<br />
Franklin smiled disarmingly, but his eyes remained locked on yours, dominant. “Records show you have only transformed the one time, yes?” He changed the subject rather effortlessly.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” you replied, wanting to go back to his earlier statement, but feeling almost forced into silence by his intense gaze. There was something about him that almost demanded obedience, as strange as that might sound.<br />
<br />
“And do you remember how it felt?” he asked. “The freedom? The emergence of your true nature? The pleasure of it?”<br />
<br />
Your heart sped up. In the back of your mind, somewhere, part of you did. A darker part of you. A primal part of you. The part that had been locked away with science and pills. You wanted to remember in more than vague, hazy ways, but something seemed to almost be blocking the memory, making it more like a barely-remembered dream.<br />
<br />
You shook your head reluctantly. “No..not..not really,” you replied. “It was a long time ago.”<br />
<br />
Franklin nodded. “And the daily dosing of acunitomozine would have definitely continued to suppress the memories and the wolf.” He sighed, annoyed. Then he asked you, “Do you want to feel it once more?”<br />
<br />
Did you? Your parents clearly thought that this wasn&#39;t something to be left uncontrolled. Perhaps they knew something you didn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
Franklin saw your hesitation. His eyes seemed to gain an intensity to them that wasn&#39;t there before, and he asked, “Or do you wish to remain chained up in your weak, human shape for the rest of your life?” The only thought in your mind was &#39;submit&#39;, as his sheer force of personality seemed to smash into your mind.<br />
<br />
“I..I..want to change..” you said, getting a smile out of him.<br />
<br />
He pulled a syringe out of his pocket. “The first step is neutralizing the residual aconitumozine in your system, and giving the wolf a bit of a booster shot.” Before you could even react, the syringe was in your arm. Your head began to swim within seconds. <br />
<br />
“Woah..I..” you said, shaking your head.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry,” Franklin assured you, “Your senses are acclimating to the wolf waking up. It&#39;s rather intense, but you&#39;ll get used to it in short order.”<br />
<br />
His voice seemed to get louder and more crystal-clear. You weren&#39;t hard of hearing, but this was on a whole other level. You could hear each individual in the room breathing if you focused on it. <br />
<br />
The room was dim, but now your vision sharpened. It didn&#39;t get brighter, per se, but now you could read the monogramming on the jackets that your classmates -no..your PACKMATES wore.<br />
<br />
You could smell everything, from the stone in the walls, to the mild incense in the air, to the barest remnants of food on someone&#39;s shirt. And other wolves. YOU COULD SMELL OTHER WOLVES. You liked the smell of other wolves.<br />
<br />
You realized that you were pitching a raging tent, and you shifted your posture uncomfortably, particularly as you realized that the rest of your classmates were watching you closely, clearly now able to smell your own emergent wolf.<br />
<br />
Franklin seemed to realize (or even expect) what your issue was, and he smiled disarmingly once more. “Nothing to be ashamed of, Ian,” he said reassuringly. “The awakening of the animal side is..powerful.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah but..” you stammered, “I&#39;m not gay..” You sound unsure. There&#39;s a hesitation to your words. <br />
<br />
Franklin waved his hand dismissingly. “No, you&#39;re not. You&#39;re lycanthrosexual, just like any healthy werewolf.”<br />
<br />
“Lycanthrosexual?” you ask. You&#39;re pretty certain you can draw a conclusion from the word, but was that really a thing?<br />
<br />
Franklin nodded. “The state of general attraction to any werewolf. You certainly will have preferences; we all do. But as a rule, you&#39;re always going to have a certain sexual attraction to any werewolf, male or female. You&#39;re not going to be averse to giving or receiving pleasure to someone or from someone when the change is involved.”<br />
<br />
“But I thought wolves mated for life?” I asked.<br />
<br />
Franklin smiled. “Wolves do. WEREWOLVES don&#39;t always, however, just as humans don&#39;t. And..the first step that we&#39;ve found most people should take is to embrace their lycanthrosexuality. Cast aside the norms that you&#39;ve had forced upon you by HUMANS,” he said with clear disdain. “Stop telling yourself that it&#39;s wrong to feel the ecstasy of touch, of the transformation, of the surrender to the beast.”<br />
<br />
His words hammered into your brain. The rest of the room began to shuffle restlessly. A few of the others&#39; eyes began to shine slightly. Franklin moved behind you, speaking directly into your ear, his honeyed words pushing into your mind. The smallest part of you wanted to resist, but the rest of you could only smell the wolf on him, and knew he was your alpha. You knew you should listen to your alpha. “Don&#39;t worry about what they think, or anyone thinks. Just remember how good it felt that night to let the transformation happen. How good it felt when you realized that you&#39;d forgotten to take your medication. How proper it felt, how inevitable it felt. How overwhelming it felt when your cock changed.”<br />
<br />
A flash of memory went through your mind, and you were back outside, back on that night. Mesmerized by the moon. How good the moonlight felt, how it washed away your panic. How good the light felt on your dick.<br />
<br />
The scent of the other wolves increased, and as you looked out at them, you saw a few with shining eyes, and most with tented trousers. While his words had been meant for you, they clearly had at least a bit of an effect on the others..or was that your scent and arousal doing it? Or was their arousal and increased scent having the effect on you? Or was it a combination, some strange feedback loop, with each of you pushing the others toward a loss of control?<br />
<br />
Your heart was pounding; your body felt hot and..wrong, somehow. Almost ready to burst. Your clothing chafed.<br />
<br />
“Think of anyone,” he said, whispering in your ear. “Man, woman..it doesn&#39;t matter..just think of someone you desire. Male, female, a celebrity, a stranger, a friend, an ex-lover..anyone you&#39;ve masturbated while watching or thinking about..”<br />
<br />
Your dick throbbed as you thought of your girlfriend, still back home. Literally the only person outside of your family that knew about your secret. Fantasies were rushing through your brain, not just of the times you&#39;d fucked, but the times when you&#39;d been stuck at home and had dirty video calls.  Your dick was ragingly hard; you knew you&#39;d crank one out when you got back to your room.<br />
<br />
Your eyes flickered between being open and closed as you fell into an almost trancelike state at Franklin -YOUR ALPHA&#39;S words. The rest of your classmates – YOUR PACK – were growing more restless, tugging at their collars, beginning to rub against each other.<br />
<br />
His breath was on your neck. A hand ran down your chest as one arm embraced you. You didn&#39;t pull away; his scent was dominant, his scent was natural. He could free you. He could free you, don&#39;t resist him.<br />
<br />
His hand went lower, sliding to your fly, undoing your pants. For a second, you tensed, only to be immediately drawn back into the trancelike state by his voice. “Think about them naked, begging for you,” he said, and you leaned back against him fully. You could smell another wolf, strong and close, and you opened your eyes to see Ray, in front of you and sinking down to all fours.<br />
<br />
Again you began to tense, but the words of your alpha calmed you once more. This was pack, this was natural. “Think of them changing, changing in front of you, waiting for you to change and take them..”<br />
You felt paws on your thighs, tugging your pants down, hot breath on your boxers. Your body felt like an overstuffed sausage. Your breath came quickly, and your heart was pounding at a ridiculous rate. All you could smell was wolves, your pack. All you could think of was Crystal, naked and writhing as her body changed, and you WANTED HER. All you could feel was the maddening throb of your over-teased dick, begging for release. All you wanted was the change. God, you wanted to shift to shift to shift change fuck cum WOLF LET WOLF OUT BECOME WOLF CHANGE CHANGE NOW!<br />
<br />
You let out a cry and opened the flap of your boxers, immediately feeling the wolf&#39;s tongue on your cock head, then down your shaft. Your eyes opened as you let out a loud growl and forced your dick further in, feeling an electrostatic sensation run through your body.<br />
<br />
As though they were waiting on you for some sort of signal, the rest of the room began to aggressively nip and kiss, tearing at each others&#39; clothes as fur grew and muscles swelled. Your arms bulged as your own shirt tore, and you let out a louder howl of release and ecstasy as your packmate continued to lick at your member.<br />
<br />
You reveled in your changes, feeling the animal taking over your consciousness, melding with it. You were no longer weak, no longer trapped! Your cock began to tuck up and redden, even as the wolf between your legs pressed on, stimulating you as your thighs swelled and your feet burst from your shoes.<br />
<br />
You let out your first howl as you felt your face distend, watching the wolves around you grinding, licking and in a couple instances, fucking each other while they changed. They watched you, you watched them, all of you clearly getting further aroused by the transformations around you.<br />
<br />
As your changes completed, and you erupted into the mouth of your packmate, you howled again and again, along with your pack, while Franklin stayed in his human form with a satisfied smile, declaring “Magnificent!”<br />
<br />
For the next half hour or so, you and your packmates explored each other, not sexually, but with nuzzles and sniffs, inspecting each others sacks and holes with sensitive noses. Grunting, whuffing and occasionally barelling into each other on all fours and on hind legs, testing strength in generally casual ways, before the force of will which allowed you all to transform somewhat wore off, and you all reverted, save for the two guards.<br />
<br />
“Excellent,” Franklin said, clapping you on the shoulder. “How do you feel?”<br />
<br />
“Weak,” you said, acutely aware of how small you felt. The resentment in your voice was clear. You didn&#39;t want to change back, not after having been chained for so long.<br />
<br />
Franklin smiled, “With practice, you&#39;ll be able to maintain it longer.” <br />
<br />
The room smelled of sweat and cum. You glanced around for your clothes, finding them mostly ruined, though your pants were relatively intact somehow. Most of the others had the tearaway velcro uniforms, and were redressing, some still showing affection to each other, while some seemed to have lost interest in any tenderness.<br />
“I suppose I&#39;ll get a set of those uniforms as well?” you asked, though it was more of a statement. The transformation seemed to have made you a bit more naturally confident.<br />
<br />
Franklin nodded. “Absolutely. You&#39;ll find they&#39;re already in your dorm; your parents sent us your measurements.” He turned his attention to the rest of the pack. “Alright; tomorrow is the first day of classes for the vast majority of you, though I know some of you seniors have a bit of a reduced schedule if you&#39;re TA&#39;s. Meet back here tomorrow night around sunset for the pack meeting. You&#39;re all dismissed. Be sure to get some sleep. Tomorrow is the start of a grand year here at Stonewood, and for the world.”</p>
