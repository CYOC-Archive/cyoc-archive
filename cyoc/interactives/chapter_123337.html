<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jen was drying off, she heard one of two Cassies knocking on the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you open the door for a bit? I heard the shower go off, so I thought I could go on with my bathroom visit, you know, the one before you interfered.<br />
<br />
Jen threw a towel around herself, two hands were holding it, while she had her other two free to open the door.<br />
<br />
Opening the door, she found her younger sister with a wide grin on her face. Before she could take a few steps back, realizing too late that Cassie was planning to do something with her. What she didn&#39;t expect was her sister to give her a wet slap in the face.<br />
<br />
Jen fell on her back in surprise, but also bliss. Her muscles had suddenly tensed up and were twitching madly. Her towel laid on the ground, leaving her bare. She felt like she was throwing up, but all that she got awarded with was pleasure. Her two vaginas were contracting, and after what felt like ages, her senses started getting back to her. Cassie was standing above her, surprised, but amazed at what had happened to her sister because of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy hell, I&#39;m so sorry! I really didn&#39;t mean to...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen interrupted Cassie&#39;s apology as she cried out in frustration. She rushed over to the sink to get that foul taste out of her mouth from after Cassie slapped her. After spitting out most of the slime that had been in the back of her throat, she glanced at her little sister, still with her head bent over the sink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- What did you do?&quot; She sputtered, feeling a rush of warmth go through her as she spoke. Small particles of her own saliva flying out of her mouth. Quickly she got an answer, from a flabbergasted Cassie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... slapped my vagina into your face...&quot;, she bluntly said.<br />
<br />
At first, Jen just looked at her funny, but the dizzying warmth, almost heat that radiated from her breath. The pleasure she just got from crying out and asking that question. That salty smell that hung inside her nostrils Above the sink hung a mirror, and she looked up.<br />
<br />
Right underneath Jen&#39;s nose, a pussy had appeared on her face. Her mouth&#39;s physical features seemed to have completely disappeared. &quot;Whoa-ah.&quot; Her breathing stocked halfway. The vibrations erupting from her voice almost were too much. She looked at Cassie, not exactly knowing what to do. She wasn&#39;t in a mood of thinking about it either.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the bathroom, heading to her own room, Jen heard the door lock behind her again. It was Cassie&#39;s turn to use the bathroom, although it was for a second time this morning.<br />
<br />
Jen was then stood still in the middle of her room, her mind paying attention to the heated breathing. Every breath seemed to bring her pleasure if it came from her mouth. Her mind was completely flooded with the pleasure she&#39;d just had. And the pleasure that seemed to be coming.<br />
<br />
Jennifer tried to concentrate on breathing normally, but the stimulation caused by only this daily doing, had her slowly moaning.<br />
<br />
She really wanted to deny a second orgasm, she&#39;d already had too much. Besides, she&#39;d just come out of the shower, but it had almost been for nothing.<br />
<br />
The vibrations from her moans stimulated her sense of pleasure, as Jen subconsciously brought the towel she&#39;d been holding to her crotch area, hoping that would keep her from making a mess in her own room. She had to lie down.<br />
<br />
Whether she wanted to or not, her breathing now went faster, as she was nearing another orgasm. As she had 3 pussies, the pleasure had tripled, and her mind couldn&#39;t control it. With that, one of them was so damn near her brain that it sent direct jolts of pleasurable energy to it, causing her to get dizzy. All things combined caused her to let out a loud, then again muffled scream, as in her climax, the muscles of her former mouth also contracted. The cry was naturally barely audible, something Jen was very thankful of as she came to her senses.<br />
<br />
When all pleasure finally subsided, Jen started to think, quickly, before ecstatic feelings took over again. She quickly learned that, if she breathed normally through her nose, no similar pleasure was found, so that meant only her mouth was the location in which the scene took place. Her mouth seemed to infinitely stay wide agape, with nothing to help against it. It was only when breathing out, letting out hotter air than usual, that she would feel the now unwanted pleasure. Breathing in would barely matter.<br />
<br />
It was time to confront Cassie about the matter. Putting on some decent clothes, and throwing her smelly towel to the corner of the room, she ran downstairs. &quot;Cassie!&quot; She cried, her breathing stocking again afterwards. Mental note: not too loud, and short sentences.<br />
<br />
The Cassie that just had breakfast was the one she saw, laying lazily on the couch, reading a book of some sort. &quot;What is it?&quot; She asked, as sluggishly as she lied there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn me back.&quot; Jen commanded, followed by a contraction of her newly found vaginal muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Was the answer she got, &quot;come here then.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen walked over, and as she leaned over her little sister, Cassie brought two fingers to her face and ripped off the piece of skin that had obstructed her from doing her usual morning routine. Jen didn&#39;t care though, she was relieved that this story was now in the past. Her relief was only short-lived though, as she took a look at the clock, realizing how late it was already. She was screaming internally, she hadn&#39;t had breakfast yet!<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; Said Cassie, who looked like she was fumbling with the training vest she had on. Once she took her hand from underneath it, she brought a whole stomach with it. That made Jen jump back in surprise, staying there, shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said don&#39;t worry! I&#39;m only trying to apologize for what just happened.&quot; She grabbed Jen&#39;s back, bringing the slimy organ to her belly. &quot;You still needed to eat right? Better not go to school on an empty stomach.&quot; Cassie put a bit of pressure onto Jen&#39;s belly, pushing the stomach against it, no wait, inside her. All of a sudden Jen felt bloated again, and was left speechless. Cassie pulled her empty stomach out, and brought it into her own body.<br />
<br />
Cassie walked then into the kitchen. &quot;I&#39;ll make some more for myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie number two now entered the living room, having changed to get ready for school. &quot;Ready for another day at school?&quot;<br />
<br />
After a few seconds of silence, Jennifer responded with a smile. &quot;Yes, now let&#39;s hurry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now already she couldn&#39;t wait on what to do. Bold thoughts popped up in her head, and she also still needed to take revenge on Kyle.</p>
