<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony counseled his little brother on what it would mean to suddenly be strikingly good looking, the way people would suddenly make all sorts of allowances for you, the way even boys and men would suddenly prefer your company to that of your more homely brethren.  He also warned him that some guys would seem to react to finding him strikingly handsome and even attractive by hating him.  Most of all, he warned him that girls would suddenly fall all over themselves to be with him and that he should stay away from girls who just wanted to fuck a pretty face and a tight round ass.  Tony recounted his disappointment with Jennifer and Kristin.  Mark took his brother's words seriously and really did try not to revel too much in his new beauty.  <br />
<br />
Tony, as well as Jeff, Jack and Eric, soon realized that what interested Mark most of all was the chronivac itself.  Mark couldn't understand his older brothers reluctance to use the chronivac.  Tony joined with his three pals on occasion, but mostly seemed to want to go on with his life in his beautiful new body.  Maybe it was because Mark had first experienced the chronivac while in the process of his own natural metamorphosis, as a 13 year old, but he had an unquenchable thirst for the feeling of the changes.<br />
<br />
First, he felt compelled to know everything that his older brother did.  The first weekend after becoming his new striking self, Mark insisted on becoming a jackass.  Tony advised against it, saying he had hated it, but Mark insisted.  He had his brother and friends drive him to an abandoned farm in the next town and change him.  Mark had to agree with Tony that the huge mass of a jackass and his terrible feeling of awkwardness wasn't fun.  But the feeling of his hands turning into hooves, a tail sprouting atop his ass and his body covering with hair and hide had been electric.  Mark easily rode out two equine days before finding himself his naked 13 year old self in the middle of a field with cud still in his mouth as his brother and his brother's friends pulled up to take him home.<br />
<br />
Gay was more troublesome, but Mark was completely committed to the chronivac, now.  He didn't have a true best friend like Tony did in Jack.  What's more, Mark's friends weren't in as good shape or as good looking as Jack.  Mark worried that he'd turn gay for a weekend and find that he had no interest in his friends.  Eventually, Mark settled on going gay as a playboy instead of with a deep romantic attachment as Tony had.  The next weekend after being a jackass, Mark had Jeff advance his age to 18, change his orientation to completely gay and increase his level of desire to the maximum, making Mark an insatiable gay sexual hound.  <br />
<br />
Jeff hit the emitter, in his room and with Tony and friends watching, Mark grew to his full 18 year old size.  He was now an inch or so taller than Tony and five or ten pounds of muscle heavier.  Not that there was anything wrong with Tony, not in Mark's eyes.  Tony turned awa from him for a moment and he scanned his older brother's rock hard ass and immediately considered rubbing Tony's G spot, at his prostate, for him.   He saw Jack watching him skeptically and stepped forward toward his brother's slim friend, taking a surprised Jack in his arms and kissing him on the mouth.  Jack let out a gasp and Mark aggressively groped Jack's modest but tight ass.  &quot;You'd do!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anybody would do for you the way you are now&quot; laughed Jack and it was true.  But Mark wanted to get the best he could.  He looked in his wallet and saw that, as intended, he now had an 18 year old's driver's licence and a membership to the ultra expensive health club in the city.  Tony drove Mark into the city and dropped him off at the address Mark had given him in one of the city's most posh neighborhoods.  With just some workout clothes and a speedo to his name, Mark walked through the door and turned every head in the place.  An hour later, he was bent over a railing in a private locker room reserved for the richest client and a tall blond private trainer was thrusting in and out of him.  Unfortunately, the button nosed blond guy had such an unimpressive penis that he didn't even come near Mark's G spot.  But Mark hung around the club, trying the pool and met an extremely handsome dark haired boy, a match for Mark in looks, but more slight of physique.  His name was Lucas.  Lucas was 21, a model and he and Mark immediately hit it off.  Luke invited Mark to a party that night and when Mark told him he had nowhere to go, took him to his apartment nearby.  They immediately had sex, though the process with Lucas was somewhat curious.  He kissed and fondled Mark as soon as they got through the door but then almost wrestled Mark to try to prevent things going any further but then seemed delighted with Mark forcefully threw him on the bed and slammed his large cock into him over and over.  Not wanting to seem too dominating, Mark let Lucas plow him next and it was much better than with the blond trainer.  Lucas has a much longer penis and the firm, persistent rub against his prostate sent a tingle through Mark's entire 18 year old's body.  Mark spent the rest of the afternoon having sex with Lucas, doing anything Lucas wanted, sucking Lucas's cock and happily swallowing his product.  The evening and next two days were a whirl.  There were expensive restaurants and a museum and the health club as occasional settings.  And Mark found that Lucas's friends did quite a bit of drugs, although Lucas, himself, didn't and Mark's initiation into their circle was to be taken and used by each of them.  Some were models or that good looking like Lucas and Mark, a few were sugar daddies who paid for the whole thing to keep going as it did.  Mark lost track of who he'd fucked when and who had had him which way though his encounters.  He remembered being repelled by the spotted leathery skin of the old man who fucked him so weakly.  And he remembered the huge penis of the model with the very close cropped hair.  Mark couldn't help but squeal each time the guy had jammed it into him and putting his mouth around it later on had required spreading his jaws farther than he thought he could.  It was a hell of a ride though for a boy completely in tune with that lifestyle, and Mark was.  Best of all, for Mark, was that his transformation was programmed to end with no physical effects lingering.  So, Mark readily sucked and was fucked without a care about aids or other std's.  <br />
<br />
Sunday night arrived and Mark called Jeff's house and gave Lucas's address.  He got off Lucas's bed where Lucas lay bottom up, dozing and gave Lucas's prime skinny ass a friendly rub.  To think, that in 60 minutes, Lucas would be just a very handsome guy and absolutely *having* to be in that ass would seem totally foreign to him.  With 60 minutes to go, Mark roused his drousy friend by rolling him over and sucking on him.  Lucas became quickly alert and shot a thick wad of his seed into Mark's hungry mouth.  Lucas returned the fellatio favor and Mark offered his rear to Lucas who greedily took it.  Mark couldn't help but laugh to himself that Lucas's fairly impressive organ was no problem after the stretching he'd gotten from the penis of the guy with the close cropped hair.  At the deadline, Mark had Lucas spreadeagled across the bed and was taking his turn.  Lucas felt his slender, athletic new friend thrusting away with a particular urgency when all of a sudden, Mark's teeth let go of the back of his neck.  He felt Mark's teeth on his shoulders, still slightly gnawing, deliciously, then he noticed that something seemed odd.  It wasn't just that Mark wasn't chewing on him, but Mark wasn't in him at all and seemed to barely even rest on him, he was so light.<br />
<br />
Lucas looked over his shoulder and saw a suddenly miniature Mark getting up from the bed and looking at him with disgust.<br />
&quot;Who-who are you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm Mark&quot;<br />
&quot;No you're not!  And how . . ?  Where's Mark?&quot;<br />
A few seconds later, as Mark was grabbing some shorts and a t-shirt of Lucas's to have something to wear, the chronivac meemory scrub kicked in and Lucas looked at Mark in shock.<br />
&quot;What are you doing in my apartment?!&quot; he demanded.  Mark said nothing and ran out the door to the car waiting outside.<br />
<br />
He recounted his experiences to the others and concurred with what Jack and Tony had told him.  When programmed for that orientation, he really had no choice but to be interested in doing those things.  He vowed to never give a gay man or boy any flack ever.<br />
<br />
That left only being a statue on his checklist of Tony's experiences.  Mark took some time to choose an appropriate location for being a nude marble version of himself and settled on the fountain outside city offices.  On the Friday of a holiday weekend, with parades and a carnival planned for the area, they drove Mark into the city.  He walked over to the fountain and Jeff started typing on the computer.  Mark looked around.  There were only a few people in the area.  They weren't paying any attention to him.  He pulled off his shirt and shoes and glanced around again.  There was a cop in the distance but 50 yards away.  Mark nodded at Jeff and stripped.  He stepped atop the granite ringing the fountain and posed as he wished.  The electric wave passed through him and Mark felt simultaneously incredibly heavy and immobile.  As planned, Tony and Jeff walked up to him with mirrors and showed him how he looked front and back.  Mark was fascinated that he still had all his senses, but after his friends left, the experience seemed rather dull.  Few people paid much attention to him.  A gaggle of girls his age gathered around him as the parade went by the next day, but the whole thing seemed rather tame compared to how it had been for Tony.<br />
<br />
Leaving the area after being returned to flesh and blood, Mark vowed to try something much better next time.</p>
