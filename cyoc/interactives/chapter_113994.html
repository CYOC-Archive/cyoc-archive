<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Luke lay on his bed a distinct aroma began to drift into his room he scowled at the smell of weed began to smother his room. Ever since he’d moved in every night like clockwork the aroma drifted into his room but this… this was on another level though, normally he’d be to anxiety filled to even consider going upstairs and complaining but Luke’s normally overthinking mind seemed calmer, his confidence mildly boosted, he NEEDED to go up there.<br />
<br />
He followed the scent up the staircase and found the door it seemed to be coming from, his anxiety had came back but he’d made it this far so he might as well knock on the door. He heard a shuffling and the door opened slightly, a crystal blue eye peering out, “Shit guys its only Luke”, the door opened further and Luke came face to face with a guy he’d never met, standing about 6’2”, wearing an unbuttoned shirt revealing his flat, hairy torso, tiny waist and broad shoulders, leading up to a clean shaven model-like face, the man’s cheekbones high, his entrancing (and very bloodshot) eyes, a wide and welcoming smile from his perfect teeth but Luke didn’t notice any of that, he was too entranced by the mass of blonde dreadlocks which stretched down the man’s back. Normally he’d avoid this guy like the plague, such an obvious stoner was not the sort of person Luke would try to start a conversation with but there was something about him that was just captivating. He had no idea if he’d been taking in the man for 10 seconds or 10 minutes when his thoughts were interrupted “So you coming in then man?”. The man clearly thought he knew Luke although judging from the hotboxed room behind him he probably wasn’t in the right frame of mind to recognise anyone but then how did he know his name was Luke and why was he so welcoming and why was Luke even here? He seemed pretty cool and Luke was just ruining his fun and…. Luke took a deep breath ready to spurt out something, anything to break the awkward silence he’d created, as the smoke from the room descended into him his rambling quickfire thoughts slowed, calmed, his rigid body loosened. “Yeah Cain sorry zoned out a bit there” “Shit man if you’re zoning out already this might not be the night for you” Cain chuckled as he stepped back, letting Luke into the foggy room.<br />
<br />
As Luke crossed the threshold his legs compacted and he turned to look Cain straight in the eyes “So uhhh…. What is it we’re doing tonight again?” Luke just couldn’t work out why his mind was so fuzzy “We’re getting you lit for the first time man! Gotta stop you being so uptight.” Luke could vaguely remember this, him and Luke had been forced next to each other in a lecture and surprisingly hit it off and he had always been interested in trying weed. He glanced around the room “Oh yeah haven’t introduced you to anyone, this here’s Neil” He motioned towards a tall, lean man sitting on the floor in the corner wearing a very tight t-shirt over muscular biceps, Luke recognised him from around campus, he was some sort of swimmer or something, no matter who he was Neil wasn’t with it at this point in time, barely managing to mutter a “’sup” and a mild nod of his head “and this is Mike” Mike was a wiry black man with a small afro probably about 6’7” if Luke were to guess and he was just finishing rolling a very large blunt, he looked up smiling, not saying a word and simply stretched his hand holding the blunt out towards Luke who smiled at him, the hotboxed room calming him still as unbeknownst to everyone in the room he continued to shrink until he was under 6’.<br />
<br />
“So uh will this stuff be alright for me to smoke if I’ve never done it before?” Luke asked, a twinge of worry re-entering him, Cain let out a breezy laugh “course bro, here have my lighter” Cain passed him a zippo with a cannabis leaf emblazoned on it. Luke sat on the bed next to Mike and put the blunt in his mouth, lighting it he inhaled and suddenly his whole life seemed so… serene, calm, he’d been missing this shit his whole life. With each puff of the blunt he took his short brown hair snaked out of his head, lightening as it went along into a very dirty blonde until it hit his shoulders. He passed the blunt onto Mike “Shit Mike you’re rolling good these days” he heard himself say, he was too blazed from those few puffs to even question why he’d say something like that and no-one else in the group seemed to notice. His chubby frame began to lessen as he looked down on the bed and saw his beanie lying next to him, he grabbed it and placed it on the mop of hair atop his head as his height settled in at 5’9”.<br />
<br />
Luke scratched his baby smooth cheeks, they were itching really badly, as his nails passed over the skin straggly hairs just a bit too long to be called stubble and too thin to be a beard poked out of his jawline and around his mouth, thicker on his lip. His plain brown eyes became a similar washed out Blue to Cain’s.<br />
<br />
Mike passed the blunt on past Neil to Cain who was staring at Luke intently “Hair’s coming along nice man, I’ll dread it up for you next week right?” Luke simply nodded his head, too high to speak at the moment, he’d like that, he had known the second he walked into that class that Cain was his sort of guy and made a beeline for him. I mean it helped that he knew a good client when he saw one. The blunt came back around to him again and he took a long toke, blowing out smoke rings as his lips thickened, his own cheekbones pushing out as his face grew more gaunt, he was probably 10-15 pounds underweight but he was a good looking dude and at 18 being a good looking guy with access to weed will get you many places he thought to himself as his 5” cock grew in to 7”, losing some girth along the way.<br />
<br />
His jeans seemed to loosen and not just because his legs were thinner, the material in them shifting to sweatpants as the Doc Martens he slipped on when coming out were surrounded by smoke, shifting, the leather lightening to a dirty white, shrinking to wrap around his size 7s, half the size he was previously. He liked his tattered Nikes, sure they weren’t the best looking but they did their job and they were comfy. His stomach pulled in, his abs faintly visible, his t-shirt’s sleeves grew longer, the neck billowing out at the back as the material got thicker until he was wearing a baggy hoody with nothing else on underneath. <br />
<br />
He passed the blunt onto Mike and reached into the hoody’s pockets, pulling out 3 thin but packed joints “This is that Afghan Kush shit I got in last night, you want some free samples?” His voice was pretty much the same but the tone of it completely changed its sound, from uptight, panicky and so, so fast to laid back, calm, collected, Luke was no longer a guy who rushed anywhere, in fact he hated those sorts, he was much more likely to be found chilling with his buds than sitting studying. That’s why he gave the guys who helped him out with his essays free shit, it’s not that he was dumb it’s just that ever since he was introduced to his beloved ganja at 14 he just didn’t really give a fuck anymore. His parents had forced him to go cold turkey during the last year of high school and he had to admit he surprised himself with just how well he did, hell its how he got to college but still, that life just wasn’t for him, Christ he’d been such a bore during that period. Hairs began to poke out his smooth legs, quite a thick coating for an 18 year old, travelling further and further up, his pubes thickening as the wirey hair coated his stomach and chest, his normally trimmed pits becoming bushy.<br />
<br />
The blunt was finished, just as they were about to spark the first of Luke’s 3 joints his phone buzzed… well one of his 3 phones, he pulled it out “Ah fuck, gotta go down to that frat boy party, Basketball team’s chipping in for an ounce. They’re asking for you too Mike… well the cheerleaders are asking, don’t know how you do it man, you’ve gotta hook me up with them” Luke chuckled as himself, Cain and Mike all got up and headed out, Neil passed out in the corner, a joint in each of their mouths, their night had only just begun.</p>
