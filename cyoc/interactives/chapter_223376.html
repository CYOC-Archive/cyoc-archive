<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What the fuck!?&quot; Officer Boyd saw Adrian standing in the middle of the park without any clothes on. He instantly started running. &quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing!?&quot; He demanded. Even though there was over a half of foot difference in their height and easily 150 pounds between them, Officer Boyd had to still try to act tough.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; Adrian cried out.<br />
<br />
The fear and panic in Adrian&#39;s voice sent Officer Boyd for a loop. However, he also didn&#39;t need the giant to freak out. Even with a whole squad, Officer Boyd didn&#39;t know if they&#39;d be able to handle him. &quot;O-okay. Try to calm down. Let&#39;s try to figure out the situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian took a breath. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what happened. I just took some powder and then started growing.&quot; He pointed down at the remnants of the clothes around his feet. Everything had been completely torn asunder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... This all happened just now?&quot; Officer Boyd asked. Adrian nodded at the question. &quot;This is insane...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you think I feel?&quot; Adrian blushed. He was at least still trying to cover himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Let me see some ID and then maybe we can go from there,&quot; Officer Boyd said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Sure?&quot; Adrian said. However, he didn&#39;t exactly move. &quot;It&#39;s in my pocket...&quot; He pointed downwards at his pants on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Right.&quot; Officer Boyd realized why Adrian hadn&#39;t bent over. Instead, he reached into the remains of Adrian&#39;s pants and pulled out a wallet. He opened it up. &#39;5&#39;8&quot; 150 pounds.&#39; &quot;No way...&quot; Officer Boyd stared in disbelief. If this was true, then Adrian should have been far smaller than him. At 6&#39;1&quot; and 200 pounds of lean athletic muscle, Officer Boyd never felt as though he were small.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?&quot; Adrian asked.<br />
<br />
Officer Boyd cleared his throat. &quot;This isn&#39;t possible...&quot; he muttered. Adrian had to be at least a foot taller than he was and only God knew how much the man weighed. His muscles were beyond big, not to mention sculpted. Deep cuts and striations were in each one showing off their intense definition. Officer Boyd pulled at his collar. A bit of nervousness was overcoming him as he didn&#39;t even come up to the chest of the other man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just give me one moment,&quot; Officer Boyd said as he stepped away from the situation. Once he was on the other side of the side walk, he pulled out his radio. &quot;Hey dispatch, I think I&#39;m going to need a couple more officers at Salazar Park. I have a suspect with a very confusing situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is the suspect violent?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Just confusing. No rush, but send a couple of the guys over if you can,&quot; Officer Boyd radioed back.<br />
<br />
&quot;On it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Boyd pulled at the collar of his uniform. &quot;Jeez... Is it really that hot...&quot; he muttered to himself. Even though he&#39;d stepped into the shade, his body was sweating bullets. &quot;Wait...&quot; he realized that he hadn&#39;t just moments before. Nor had his uniform felt so tight on him. He looked over to see Adrian still standing there in the nude. &quot;Oh shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
His fingers instantly went to the buttons of his shirt. It didn&#39;t help that his hands were rapidly growing. Each time he&#39;d thought he&#39;d have the button, it would slip out of his grasp. He could see his big hands growing bigger. &quot;Fuck...&quot; he groaned as the clothes he was wearing rapidly became more constricting. What had been a fairly loose and breathable fabric began to pull to his body, then hug it tightly.<br />
<br />
The officer felt himself fighting against the binding. The more confined he felt, the more he flexed his growing muscles. Each one gaining the mass he so jealously wanted, but not over the course of mere seconds. His body flexed. The little radio in his hand shattered into pieces. &quot;Oh shit,&quot; he cursed at the little bits of radio that were left over.<br />
<br />
Officer Boyd couldn&#39;t focus too much on the radio as he heard a loud ripping sound come from his clothing.  His pants couldn&#39;t hold the powerful quads or calves on his growing body. They had already risen halfway up his shins and the powerful diamond shaped muscle. Every movement in the legs tore the pants more at the seams, showing off his powerful lower body. He barely even had time to register as his feet burst out of the leather confines of his shoes. Each toe wiggled with excitement as the socks were soon to be next.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it...&quot; he continued to curse as the sleeves tore at his growing biceps. He naturally tried to shrink in on himself as much as possible. Maybe squeezing down into a little ball would help. It didn&#39;t as the back of his uniform ripped asunder from the massively muscled back. Deep canyons formed between each of the muscles in his back showing off the power he was now capable of. He stretched to the sky feeling all his limbs lengthen with him. Everything around him felt so small all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
With a surprising amount of confidence, Officer Boyd walked back over to Adrian. &quot;Well... I guess you weren&#39;t lying...&quot; he quipped. However, there wasn&#39;t any shame in his massively muscled body at all. Every part of him bulged. Especially when he looked at the larger Adrian. &quot;Did you get bigger?&quot; he asked. His eyes roamed the other man, not realizing just how much he liked how Adrian looked. The powerful muscles were undeniably tone.<br />
<br />
Adrian shrugged, unsure at the answer. He hadn&#39;t been paying too much attention. At least not enough to notice that two more inches had been added onto his height. Officer Boyd stood at 6&#39;8&quot; while he was now 6&#39;10&quot;. The two hulking men stood in the park.</p>
