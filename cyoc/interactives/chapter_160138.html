<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dragging the older girl along behind in her wake, Hurricane Missy reached her suite and opened the door.  Joey reached the door just as it closed, to hear laughter inside.<br />
<br />
Big! Elly watched with bemusement as Little! Elly was introduced to Marcy, a very pretty girl of perhaps 7.  Marcy seemed very confused, but she smiled happily.  Even though they shared a personality and their minds were linked, there was a difference in perspective based on their current age.  At 18, Elly was mostly like her fully adult self, but more playful and fun-loving.  At 6, things were simpler, and she had no adult concerns.<br />
<br />
She was going to have to experiment with different ages, if Joey and Melissa didn&#39;t mind.<br />
<br />
Little! Elly seemed surprised at how much smaller Missy was now, and commented.  &quot;Missy, you shrank again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Missy laughed.  &quot;I was telling Marcy about my powers.  I wish I was 6 years old!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey shook his head, granting the request, as he moved to stand near Big! Elly.  &quot;Missy was saying I should have different names to call you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?  We&#39;re all Elly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It could get confusing, especially if there&#39;s four of you.  Or more, I guess.&quot;  He frowned, still not sure why Elly&#39;s new power could do more than he intended.<br />
<br />
&quot;How...how many times can I split myself, Sir?  How small can I get?&quot;  Elly was curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, you were intended to be limited to 6 years old.  I guess you could turn yourself into a pack of newborns if you wanted to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elly got a strange look in her eyes.  &quot;Could I become even younger?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey blinked.  &quot;But...you&#39;d be a preemie, or worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y...yes.  That&#39;s true.  But...&quot;  She trailed off for a minute, looking at the younger girls playing.  &quot;Could you...well of course you could.  Would you...maybe sometime...&quot;  She blushed a little.  &quot;Oh God, I feel like such a freak even thinking of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey took her hands in his.  When he&#39;d created her, he hadn&#39;t intended it, but the life history Eliora had would naturally make her feel conflicted about her sexuality...and what others thought.  As an adult, she wouldn&#39;t let that bother her, but her 18 year-old self must be more vulnerable.  &quot;Elly.  You&#39;re not a freak.  I&#39;ve been called that before, and I bet Melissa has too.  You&#39;ve seen us together, we&#39;re into some strange stuff, but do you think we&#39;re freaks?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elly stiffened.  &quot;Of course not!  You&#39;re both in love with each other, it&#39;s wonderful.  Sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then neither are you.  You don&#39;t have to tell me what&#39;s on your mind, but I won&#39;t judge you, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe you, Sir.  You make me wish that...well that I could be with a man.  I&#39;d like to have someone like you in my life.  Then again...it&#39;s for the best.  You&#39;re my boss, and married to someone I...care for.  It wouldn&#39;t do for me to kiss you.&quot;  She blushed more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not without Melissa&#39;s permission, that is.  You have a crush on her?&quot;  Joey wasn&#39;t shocked, I mean, when he created Elly, he was well aware that Melissa had certain...intentions.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I do.  That&#39;s weird, but I&#39;ll be professional, you can count on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey considered the fact that Elly thought he and Melissa were married.  They weren&#39;t, but he had registered them both under his last name.  They might as well be, but he&#39;d have to ask Melissa about making it official.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, Sir, I thought about...what it would be like to be unborn.  To be inside another woman&#39;s womb.&quot;  She had a hard time looking at him.<br />
<br />
Joey blinked.  The ultimate regression, really.  It wasn&#39;t really something that turned him on, but he supposed there was an intimacy to it.  &quot;We&#39;d need a mother for you.  I mean, we could make you pregnant with yourself, I guess, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
Elly blinked.  &quot;Oh.  I hadn&#39;t thought about that.  It would be weird but...kind of cool, with the link.  I&#39;d be willing to try that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what you really want is to be inside Melissa.&quot;  Joey put an arm around Elly&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would.  She doesn&#39;t strike me as being motherly, but...I think that would be nice.&quot;  Elly looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can ask her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d do that...for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey nodded.  &quot;In a lot of ways, I see you as family, Elly.  I&#39;d be happy to use my...abilities...to make you happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Sir.  May I split myself?&quot;<br />
<br />
He blinked.  &quot;Why...um, sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a brief flash, twin 9 year olds stood before him.  One wore the upper half of Elly&#39;s uniform, with a chauffer&#39;s cap perched precariously on her head, while the other struggled to hold up pants far too large for her.  Idly, he wondered why her ability seemed inconsistent with how it handled her clothing- he&#39;d already seen her end up naked, with her clothing either vanishing outright, or falling to the floor.  Something strange was going on.<br />
<br />
Before he could think on it more, he found the twins hugging him.  &quot;It&#39;s easier&quot; said one.  &quot;To hug you when we&#39;re like this.&quot;  Finished the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not professional, but we&#39;re just innocent little girls.&quot;  They spoke in unison.<br />
<br />
Joey shook his head, and hugged them both back, giving each one a kiss on their forehead.  Then he wished age-appropriate dresses on them.  &quot;Go play, you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sat back, watching Elly, Elly, Little! Elly, Marcy, and Missy, having a great time playing tag in the suite.  He ordered room service for them all.  He&#39;d neglected to actually give Elly a room of her own, but the suite had extra bedrooms.  Elly...Ellys&#39;?  He wasn&#39;t sure how to really refer to them...they could share a room.  Marcy would get one to herself, though he figured she&#39;d latch onto Missy for a bit, while she figured out a few things.<br />
<br />
Of course that left him without a girlfriend, which wouldn&#39;t do.  Oh well, a problem for later.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the girls wound down, and he used cushions and blankets to make them comfortable on the floor.  The girls snuggled together for warmth, and he went to bed.<br />
<br />
Much later, he was awoken by a familiar, and very welcome sensation.  Pulling away the covers, he found Missy between his legs, sucking on his cock.  There was a lot wrong with the situation, but it felt too damn good for him to care.  He reached down to place his hand on her head as he lay back and enjoyed what she was doing to him with her tiny mouth and tongue.<br />
<br />
He came, gasping, and he heard Missy cough a bit.  Then she crawled up to cuddle with him.  He put an arm around her naked body, and pulled the covers over them both (idly wishing for her mouth to be clean).<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm...minty fresh.&quot;  She nuzzled against him.  &quot;It felt very naughty...almost incestuous, but I love you so much, &#39;Daddy&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, don&#39;t do that, please.  This is all weird enough.&quot;  <br />
<br />
She giggled.  &quot;It is!  I feel so wrong.  But you know me, that just turns me on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything turns you on.  How long before you start fooling around with Marcy?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Um.  I&#39;d rather not.  I mean, it doesn&#39;t matter to me that she used to be a boy, and you made her damn pretty.  Even as a kid, she really tempts me.  But...she&#39;s fragile right now.  She needs to be a kid.  And to be innocent again.  I know, we wanted a friend for Elly, but...I feel really protective of Marcy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Goddess...do you think so?  I never thought of myself as, you know, a mom.  I&#39;d suck at it, I&#39;m sure.  But...maybe?&quot;  Missy sounded a little awestruck.<br />
<br />
&quot;It surprises me too, but I like that you&#39;re a complex woman.  I&#39;m finding out new things about you all the time.  Speaking of new things, do you want to know what Elly admitted to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, what?&quot;  Missy turned to face him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, one, she&#39;s got a huge crush on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Already?!  I mean, that&#39;s great, but I didn&#39;t really intend for that to happen so soon.  All we&#39;ve done is play so far.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Joey nodded.  &quot;But there&#39;s more.  She asked how young she could make herself.  If she could become less than a newborn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Less than...ew.  Yeah, she needs to be careful with that, I guess.  I mean, she&#39;d die, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If she was outside of a womb, probably.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.  That&#39;s crazy.  Well you could make that impossible, right?  For her to do that, even accidentally?&quot;  <br />
<br />
He nodded.  &quot;I could...but what if she wanted to do it on purpose?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What.  Why?!&quot;  At this point, she sat up to stare at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;To know what it feels like to be an unborn.  Inside a womb.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  Fuck.  That&#39;s...that&#39;s something.  She wants that?&quot;  Her eyes seemed to widen.<br />
<br />
&quot;She does.  Not a kink I gave her, she said something about the ultimate intimacy.  I mentioned it was possible for her to occupy her own womb, given how her power works, and she thought that was really weird, but seemed ok with the idea...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What.  The.  Actual.  What would that feel like, being pregnant with yourself?  They&#39;re all linked, so she&#39;d feel...well...fuck.  Hell, what would sex with her other selves be like...masturbation?&quot;  Missy started to grin slightly, her mind going to some dirty places.<br />
<br />
&quot;More intense, I&#39;d think.  But I realized she had someone else in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?  Who, I mean, we don&#39;t know many...&quot;  Missy trailed off, then got pale.  &quot;Me?!  She wants to be...inside me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, sounds dirty when you say it out loud, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joseph.  Don&#39;t you even.  It&#39;s the opposite of dirty.  Oh wow.  That&#39;s...&quot;  She put a hand on her tummy.  &quot;A life inside there?  I mean, I was always afraid of getting pregnant, but...this would be different, wouldn&#39;t it?  She was never really born, never had a real mother.  Oh Joe...what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it puts the fact that you want to fuck her straight into weirdsville.  Hell, you could seduce her while you&#39;re pregnant with her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joey!!&quot;  Melissa rarely called him that.  &quot;Don&#39;t...oh man, that&#39;s so kinky...&quot;  She shook her head.  &quot;Damn you.  Damn me.  I want to be all kinds of offended, but the idea of it just turns me on.  I&#39;m so twisted...what&#39;s wrong with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
He pulled her into his arms and kissed her hair and forehead.  &quot;Nothing.  You have impossible desires.  Desires and urges and thoughts that can&#39;t ever be real.  Most people who found out about them, would be repulsed.  But I&#39;m the same as you.  Just because the rest of the world thinks it&#39;s perverted doesn&#39;t mean it is.  It doesn&#39;t mean that it couldn&#39;t be a wonderful thing, if Elly wanted it.  If you wanted it.  And guess what?&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed, happily.  &quot;I have a boyfriend who can make it real.  Oh Joseph...before I met you, I was stumbling around in the dark, I hated the world, I hated myself.  But you, you perverted godlike asshole...you&#39;re changing me.  Changed me.  I can see light now.  It&#39;s more than love, you&#39;ve saved me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Missy...power or no power, wherever it came from, why it was given to me...it didn&#39;t save me.  You did.  Without you, I&#39;d have hurt people, done horrible things, just to satisfy my lust.  I mean, more than I have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joseph...I&#39;m not your conscience.  I&#39;ve egged you on, too.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but at the end of the day, you remind me that I&#39;m human.  Hey Missy...I was thinking.  Would you...&quot;<br />
<br />
She placed a small finger on his lips.  &quot;I&#39;m way too emotional right this moment.  Being so young doesn&#39;t help.  So please don&#39;t say it.  I&#39;d cry, and I&#39;m not ready to hear it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, don&#39;t be sorry.  You make me really happy, Wish boy.  You do.  More than anything.  I just want to fool around more, and I can&#39;t do that if I&#39;m a weepy mess.&quot;  She looked at him with undisguised lust.  &quot;So let&#39;s fuck like animals for a bit, ok?  Just some mindless sex and cuddling, any kind of transformation you want.  No limit.  Earlier you gave me the best orgasm of my life.  I want better.  I want to be reduced to a quivering mess, and I want you to hold me tight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be happy to.&quot;  He smiled at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also...just so you know.  Yes.  The answer is yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Joey couldn&#39;t hold back anymore, and unleashed unholy acts of pleasure and depravity in the bedroom.  Should we speak of such things here?</p>
