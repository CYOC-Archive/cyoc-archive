<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">     After researching to your heart&#39;s content on the Corrupted Soul, you decided to take a break from that mystery and go explore the castle for a while until the meeting with Lord Hugenstore himself would commence. For now, you thought in your head, taking a nice walk seems appealing you think as you exit the hallway and begin exploring Castle Bettsword, forming a rough outline of its structure and hallways eventually familiarizing yourself with the stone walls and grand halls and the such.<br />
<br />
      Servants and staff members walk past you without a second thought carrying the morning meals for the castle&#39;s residents along with other items such as documents or books as well.<br />
<br />
     Using your soulsight your second form of vision that whilst making you completely blind on the physical plane allowed you to peer into the ethereal world instead. Everything was gray and fuzzy except for the luminescent humanoid blobs who walked past you and the more faint souls further away from your location. Your knowledge told you that these were souls and that depending on their color told you a lot more about them at person. Most of them were a pure white whilst others had more variety in their souls. Occasionally the spirit inhabiting a passing servant would have a tinge of blue or yellow infinently swirling with the white forming a almost hypnotic pattern.<br />
<br />
           Interesting, even the common folk here have a spark of magic within them. You think to yourself, wondering what else you don&#39;t know. <br />
<br />
       You were about to deactivate your soul sight when out of the corner of your soul vision you saw particular two souls in the distance that intrigued you. <br />
(Your Soul Sight Allows You To See Souls Through Obstacles Like Walls As Long As They Aren&#39;t Magically Warded) one was adult sized whilst another was around the size of a small child with both of them being about fifty feet to your right .Curiously unlike the other servants these two almost had pure green color to their spirit with only minor swirls of white within them.<br />
<br />
    You sensed that their magical signature was similar to Master Harauphar but not exactly like his. Curiosity sparked you turn off your soul vision and make your way through the corridor making a sharp turn and eventually tracking the two souls down to a small lounge tucked into the corner of a hall. You listen closely, leaning your head against the door. <br />
<br />
   You hear talking and a familiar voice that you weren&#39;t quite able to remember underneath through the door and a soft whine belonging to that of a child made it&#39;s way to your ears.<br />
<br />
   A kid? Wait a second..... You think remembering who those two souls are.<br />
<br />
                 You claw at the door with your paw loudly, not stopping until you hear the sound of someone getting up from a chair and soft footprints making their way to the door. <br />
<br />
         The door opens infront of you and like you expected was the mistress of Mastter Harauphar! Wearing a red fine dress and carrying her young daughter Sara in her arms she looks at you with a polite but obviously disdainful look.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Ah.... Wraith, my it&#39;s been some time since I&#39;ve seen you. I should&#39;ve known you would<br />
accompany my husband with him to the monthly council meeting here at the city.&quot; She says looking down at you like a dog she saw on the street. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Hello to you Lady Lyaa and Lady Sara, I am pleased to see you both once more. If you did not know my Master is taking care of personal matters and has left me in a period of free time until the meeting begins.&quot; You say professionally nodding to both of them, ignoring Lyaa&#39;s body language.<br />
<br />
    Sara looks down at you as if suddenly realizing you were there before giving you a small giggle and smile, fidgeting in her mother&#39;s arms, trying to reach out her arm to pet you. <br />
<br />
      &quot;Big fox! Papa&#39;s dog!&quot; She says with a innocent enthusiasm. <br />
  <br />
     You move closer to her going on two paws for a second, letting her pet your head gently before Lady Lyaa suddenly moves Sara away from your head.<br />
<br />
       She takes a step back before resuming.<br />
  &quot;Anyway, I do not believe you have properly been introduced to my daughter yet. She is Lady Sara of Bettsworth and eightyninth in line for the royal throne. She is royalty as am I and because of that I ask that you refrain yourself befitting touching my daughter without permission.&quot; Lady Lyaa says, putting notable emphasis on the last part.<br />
<br />
        You nod politely &quot;I apologize, Lady Lyaa, but with your permission may we go inside the room? I doubt you would be conformatable standing in a doorway after all.&quot; <br />
<br />
   &quot;Apology accepted, now that is an great idea as well, please come in Wraith.&quot; Lady Lyaa says, making her back into the lounge, sitting down on a furnished sofa, putting her knees together neatly. She sets Sara down, making sure her blonde hair is set straight before looking at you. You make your way onto a couch facing her and sit down, enjoying the plush sensation of the velvet fabric, curling your four tails around you.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Now Wraith, if I may ask, how did you know we both were in here?&quot; Lays asks.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Ah well it was merely by curiosity, whilst I was in my soul sight which allows me to see spirits, I saw both of your souls which unlike others I&#39;ve seen before in this castle are both almost completely green. I simply wished to know who  the people who owned those souls were .&quot; You explain.<br />
<br />
<br />
    Lyaa nods understandingly <br />
&quot;Ah yes, I can see how that would happen, but <br />
I would hardly be a Warlock&#39;s wife if I myself didn&#39;t not contain magical energy. Same goes for my daughter. Both our souls are virtually ripe with fellish energy though we both rarely ever use magic ourselves or even try and produce fel energy. Because of this our souls are often targetted by monsters and the such so for the sake of our safety we both tend to stay here within the confines of the castle.&quot; Lyaa says.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Ah I see, are there any other figures here in Bettsworth that use magic that I should be aware of?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Since Bettsworth is known as the City of Magic there is a large majority of magic users within the city though these tend to be artificers and the such.  They also tend to be within the upper classes of the city with the laborers and servants making up the lower class. Of course there are also the Nine Royal Mages that work under Lord Hugenstore himself, with my husband Harauphar being one of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;I see, if I myself may ask, what is Lord Hugenstore like?&quot; <br />
<br />
   &quot;Ahh.... well despite me being distantly related to him, he has a bit of a lazy streak to him and he isn&#39;t the perfect image of human physice,&quot; she says with a wink &quot; he is certainly no fool and has run this city quite well. But enough about this city, I would like to know more about you.&quot; Lyaa says, a faked smile on her face. <br />
<br />
   &quot;Of course, what would you like to know?&quot;  You say a hint of suspicion in your voice.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Well... from what I understand of magic, my husband said you were originally a human from another world of existence, is this true Wraith?&quot; She asks, with curiosity that seemed truly genuine.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Most certainly true, back in my world I was actually a teenager studying for an exam! Magic didn&#39;t even exist there other than in the storybooks!&quot; You say.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Really? No magic? How did your people even survive?&quot; She asks.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Well instead of magic we advanced ourselves in technology and the such. We created so many things that it would be impossible to tell you all of it.&quot; <br />
<br />
   &quot;And... how did you feel being taken away from everything you knew and know? Surely you couldn&#39;t have been that accepting?&quot; <br />
<br />
  &quot;Well I do miss my human parents and all of my friends from that world, but this world is practically a fantasy world to me. There&#39;s magic, gods, monsters, kingdoms and who knows what more? Not to mention that in several decades once Harauphar dies of natural causes I&#39;ll become immortal! It may not be a willing deal but it definitely isn&#39;t a bad one.&quot; You say.<br />
<br />
   Lyaa looks at you with a blank expression on her face, as if she herself was thinking about something. Sara was sat at her side playing with her mothers hair as she stood there looking at you. <br />
<br />
             You both proceed to talk with Lady Lyaa learning more about Harauphar who apparently had a soft spot for birds and about Lady Lyaa herself. During the conversation she asks about the projects you&#39;ve been doing with Harauphar Ruby you sternly tell her to her disappointment that those are secrets that belong to Master Harauphar only. <br />
<br />
   Eventually hours past and Sara was now sitting behind you, brushing your fur with a ornate comb making you slightly purr with pleasure.<br />
<br />
<br />
      Soon it was time for the meeting and make your way to Harauphar, Lady Lyaa and Sara accompaning you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
