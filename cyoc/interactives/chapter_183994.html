<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave leaned on the sink in the locker room bathroom. His eyes were no longer even slightly brown, green eyes stared right back at him from the mirror, bright and emerald, the exact shade of Owen&#39;s. And the face, there wasn&#39;t much recognizable as him, other than that too scruffy beard. He was hairier than his new father by a good deal, not as hairy as he had been, but that might be chalked up to being younger.<br />
<br />
The face he wore had to be no older than twenty-five, and he knew he was going to lose more years. His memories told him he had been friends with Chris since his earliest school years, same grade, and Chris was only twenty-two.<br />
<br />
&#39;Only four years older than Aaron.&#39; He thought to himself. &#39;Not weird at all. It&#39;s only weird because he used to be your son.&#39; Dave scrubbed at his face with a hand. He knew what he wanted, and what he wanted was his roommate. But the two sets of memories made it so awkward. Maybe if he just gave in and stopped worrying about it the old ones would fade.<br />
<br />
Being gay was another thing he had to get used to. He hadn&#39;t really thought about it, he just kind of went with it. Strangely it didn&#39;t feel odd at all. It was just part of who he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to stare at yourself in the mirror all night?&quot; Chris slapped Dave on the shoulder as he walked past. Chris was a good looking guy, too. Though more boy next door wholesome than Dave&#39;s scruffy ruggedness. He could even remember having a crush on him back in high school, but giving up on that once he realized it wouldn&#39;t work. They had fooled around a couple of times though, Chris willing to try for his friend. The first person he told he was gay, to boot. Chris never judged or faltered, he was just there.<br />
<br />
Dave had never had a friend that close. The closest had been Owen, and while they had gotten along great, this was something else. &quot;Just lost in thought.&quot; Dave said as he headed to his locker to get dressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got any plans?&quot; Chris said, stripping down out of his uniform to change into his street clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was going to try to talk to Aaron tonight. Figure things out. See where we stand.&quot; Chris may be straight, and his friend, but Dave enjoyed admiring the other bodybuilder&#39;s physique, and Chris never minded an audience, male or female. So he watched a little more openly than he might with another guy as he dressed himself. Chris really did have a fantastic ass. Such a waste on a straight guy. <br />
<br />
The two said their farewells and Dave hopped in his car to head home, all the time thinking of one man, the one waiting for him at home. Christ might be good looking, but it&#39;s like Aaron was made for him. Almost close to his perfect taste, and if he was still changing like Dave was, maybe he would be the perfect guy for him.<br />
<br />
Parking, he got out of his car and walked up to his apartment. He paused in the doorway for a moment at the room. Different furniture, a little messy, it wasn&#39;t the apartment he left, but he knew walking in it was home. His eyes went right to the couch in front of the TV.  Aaron lay sprawled out in nothing but a pair of black boxers, playing a video game.<br />
<br />
He had continued to change. His muscles were still lean but more defined, and he had a bit of a scruffiness to him as well. A touch of blond hair on his chest and up the middle of his abs. His hair had gotten longer as well, wavy and blond, long enough to brush his shoulders. Dave had always like long hair on women, and it seems that kept even though his attention had turned to men.<br />
<br />
Aaron looked over at him and smiled, not the least bit ashamed at being caught laying around barely dressed.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Aaron looked up as he heard the front door open. He didn&#39;t know what to really expect, other than this should be the time Dave got home. The man that walked in made his breath catch for just a moment. He was a giant wall of black-furred muscle still, and without the age and extra weight he looked even more muscular if that was possible. But he was almost too good looking for his own good now. Not that he had been unattractive before, but this was something else. He had to shift a little as his cock began to respond almost instantly to his presence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we talk?&quot; Dave asked as he walked over to the couch. Aaron shifted to make room for him. &quot;About last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about it?&quot; Aaron asked curiously, trying not to smile too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that..&quot; Dave trailed off. &quot;I mean was that a one time thing or..&quot; For answer Aaron leaned in and pressed his lips against Dave&#39;s, feeling the thick scruff rub against his own faint stubble. Dave eagerly returned the kiss, but as Aaron started to work at the fly of his jeans he felt Dave&#39;s hand press on his chest and gently push him back a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. First, I need to ask you something. Does this feel right?&quot; Dave looked Aaron square in the eyes. &quot;Like, does it feel like the entire world&#39;s been scrambled these last couple of days. That, you were someone else before?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron tried to put on his most serious face. He knew he was about to lie, and he felt guilty for it. Still, he promised himself this would be the one he kept to himself. He shook his head. &quot;Only that I finally worked up the courage to see if we could work. You pretty well scrambled my brains last night though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave seemed to ease at that, tension leaving those massive shoulders of his, powerful arms wrapping around him. God, he could spend hours just looking at those arms. Suddenly he was hoisted up into the air and thrown over Dave&#39;s shoulder. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Aaron said, trying to sound indignant, but laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I should have your first night here.&quot; Aaron felt his boxers being pulled off, leaving him naked on Dave&#39;s shoulder, one arm wrapped about his waist to keep him up there. Dave wandered through the apartment until he reached his room and threw Aaron down on the bed.<br />
<br />
Dave began to undress as Aaron grabbed the lube off the night stand. It had just seemed to appear last night when they needed it, the changes providing what they needed when they needed it, it seemed.<br />
<br />
Soon, Aaron&#39;s legs were up on Dave&#39;s shoulders, his ankles gripped in large, calloused hands as he felt that amazingly thick cock splitting him apart. If anything, Dave was even longer and thicker than he had been last night. Aaron knew his own cock had continued to grow. It was an impressive nine inches now, a little longer than Dave&#39;s but not nearly as girthy.<br />
<br />
Aaron knew it should be painful. He had never taken anything that big before, as much as he liked his guys to be like donkeys down there, Dave was another level. It did hurt, but it felt so good, too. Like no one would ever be able to fill him like this man did, like they were made for each other, and Aaron guessed they were. That&#39;s exactly what the Chronivac had done.<br />
<br />
He gripped the sheets in his hands and groaned, deep and loud. Dave slowed his thrusting a little. &quot;Too much?&quot; Aaron just shook his head, rocking his hips to invite the other man to continue, and continue he did.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Dave let his thoughts float as he thrust in and out of Aaron. Seeing the man on the bed before him, the only real traces that remained of the old Aaron where in his features. More sharp than delicate now, and the blond hair and blue eyes. But otherwise he looked like a different person, much as he did. It helped him to let go of those old memories and just enjoy being with someone. The old Dave was gone.<br />
<br />
With a deep moan he thrust into Aaron one more time, spurt after spurt of his cum filling the younger man as he stayed almost hilted inside of him. Pulling free once he began to soften, he dropped down onto the bed next to Aaron, tucking some of those long blond strange back out of his face and behind his ear. &quot;So. Are we a couple now?&quot; Dave asked mildly, a grin spreading on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe if you take me on an actual date one night instead of just tossing me in your bed.&quot; Aaron&#39;s tone was stern but there was no real heat in it. &quot;And stop waffling on the facial hair and grow that damn beard. I like a man with a beard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal.&quot; Dave said before he leaned in for another long kiss, his mouth tracing a path down Aaron&#39;s body then taking the first few inches of that long cock of his into his mouth. Aaron gasped but didn&#39;t protest. It was going to be another long night.</p>
