<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">CYOC was ready for some new changes in Springvalley.<br />
<br />
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-<br />
<br />
James Trueman was the only student in detention. He was a stoner and a major jerk at the age of 19. He had long, shoulder length <br />
blond hair and was clean shaven. He was in Grade 12, for the second time. James was in detention for being full of attitude in math <br />
class.<br />
<br />
The staff supervisor, a math teacher. was hungry, so he left James unattended to go downstairs to the staff room and get some lunch. <br />
&quot;Fuckin' sweet.&quot; said James after the supervisor left, putting his feet up on the desk in front of him and putting his earbuds in, turning on <br />
his music.<br />
<br />
James looked at the board, seeing a couple of unsolved math equations. As he looked at them, his brain started to hurt. James <br />
dismissed it, thinking he just needed a joint or something. James got up and stood by the board, looking at the equations.<br />
<br />
James scratched his scalp, trying to make sense of the things on the board. They felt strangely famaliar to him. Unknown to him, as he <br />
scratched his scalp, his hair began to shorten in length, until it was three quarters inch in length. His hairline also started to recede a bit.<br />
<br />
James' jeans started to feel strange on him, but James didn't care, he was too focused on the board. The denim was starting to shift to <br />
a polyester blend, and the color was turning blacker. James' socks started to change as well, the cotton becoming a more expensive <br />
fabric. James' shoes started to change shape, becoming fancy, formal leather shoes.<br />
<br />
James grabbed the whiteboard marker and started to write things down for the first problem. He was starting to remember the methods, <br />
though they were fuzzy. He got stuck midway through the problem, and put his hand on his chin to think. He started stroking it with his <br />
thumb and index finger, and as he did, black stubble started to grow all on his face, where stubble usually grows. As it grew out, forming <br />
a decent beard, the hairs on James' head turned the same black color as his beard.<br />
<br />
James resumed solving the problem, not noticing his music die down and stop. The earbuds started crawling out of his ears, and they <br />
wrapped around his neck. The thin material covering the wire started to thicken and become polyester, as did the far end. James <br />
subconciously grabbed the MP3 player as it began to fall from the far end thickening. The earbuds were starting to give off the <br />
appearance of a tie.<br />
<br />
James was almost finished the first equation. He just needed to calculate some numbers. He looked at what he was holding, his MP3 <br />
Player, as it started to grow in size, with familiar numbers and commands appearing on it. He recognized the new buttons appearing, <br />
log, sin, drg, all of them. James inputted his numbers in the calculator, and solved the first question.<br />
<br />
James' t-shirt was the last article of clothing that had to be changed. The sleeves stretched out to his wrists. A collar formed around <br />
where the tie was, and buttons started forming down the center of the shirt. The logo in the front of the white t-shirt simply disappeared, <br />
as blue vertical stripes appeared going down the shirt. James was now wearing a dress shirt.<br />
<br />
James moved on to the second equation, as he felt a sudden pain. He clutched his head and bent over a bit. He was growing. Not too <br />
much, but he was certainly growing. He grew a little taller, and gained some muscle and fat. His skin lost that youthful sheen, and his <br />
hair started greying, ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
Mr. Trueman regained his posture, and started to solve the math equations on the whiteboard. Being a math teacher was a lot of fun, <br />
he got to do what he loved for a living, and he loved it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Melissa Mann was not a popular girl. She was super smart, and not bad looking with her hair down to her back and her natural figure, <br />
even if she was a bit short. But she wasn't very social. She got annoyed easily, and didn't like most people.<br />
<br />
She was sitting in the library. She had a major project due the next day in AP Biology that she had to put the finishing touches on. The <br />
TV in the corner was distracting her though, there was a football game on and some annoying jocks were watching it and being loud. <br />
The librarian was known for being &quot;chill&quot;, so she allowed it.<br />
<br />
Melissa sighed, getting back to her paper. &quot;The plant cells choloroplasts are...&quot; she started, before being interrupted by cheers of <br />
&quot;TOUCHDOWN!&quot; by the TV. Melissa sighed and looked over, watching the replay. She observed the play, and saw that it was done <br />
rather well.<br />
<br />
Melissa scratched her chest, not noticing that her cleavage was hard and firm instead of round and sensitive. She scratched slightly <br />
lower, down her six-pack abs with a treasure trail.<br />
<br />
Melissa turned back to her work, removing her ponytail from her shoulder length hair before resuming. She looked at her paper, and <br />
saw that everything was blurry. She reached for her head and took off her glasses, and she could see fine. She set her glasses on the <br />
desk, and started to resume her paper. &quot;Cloroplasts are....&quot;<br />
<br />
Crap. Melissa couldn't remember. She knew that she knew this, but it seemed so far away. She looked back at the TV. Maybe she'd <br />
been working too hard and needed a break. She scratched her buzzcut hair, and rubbed her neck, feeling her prominent Adam's Apple.<br />
<br />
Melissa was intrigued by the football game. The teams were hard at play. This was much more interesting than dumb old Biology. What <br />
good was that science shit for, anyway? Melissa shook her head. Despite hating Bio, she knew it had to be done.<br />
<br />
The paper was messy, and full of spelling and grammar mistakes. Michael didn't care, as long as he could read his writing. He'd run it <br />
through Microsoft Word or something later. Michael was glad he didn't take AP Biology, he'd never be able to keep up.<br />
<br />
Michael scratched his chest again. The t-shirt he was wearing started to shift, changing to a jersey. The yellow color changed to blue, as <br />
the school's logo appeared on the front, 72 and MANN appearing on the back. The size also increased to an extra large.<br />
<br />
Michael felt a sudden itching in his groin, followed by an urge to go to the bathroom. He got up, leaving his shit in the library, and went <br />
to the Men's Room. He sat on the toilet, pulled down his pants and boxers, and grabbed his thick, long dick, taking&nbsp;a piss.<br />
<br />
Michael slid his boxers and his pants back up, not noticing them change as he did. They changed into a material suitable for a football <br />
game. They too, grew to an extra large size. His shoes also changed, becoming football cleats, and growing to a size 15. Michael then <br />
felt a strange feeling throughout his body as he gained muscle mass, growing into his extra large clothes.<br />
<br />
Michael swaggered back to the library to meet his friends. He grabbed his crap from the desk and put on his sunglasses, and walked <br />
over to his friends to watch the game. &quot;Sup fuckers.&quot; he said as he approached them.<br />
&quot;Well if it ain't the Mann. Nice of you to join us, bro!&quot; exclaimed one of his friends.<br />
&quot;Dude, don't you got that paper to do for Bio Minor?&quot; asked another.<br />
&quot;Fuck, man&quot;, replied Michael, &quot;I don't have to do that shit. I'm passing, that's at that matters, besides, the teacher will take it late <br />
anyway.&quot;<br />
Michael grinned. He loved his bros, amd he was glad the teachers would put up with his crap. School wasn't important anyway, football <br />
was the Mann's life.<br />
<br />

CYOC was happy at his transformations working, but he felt the need for more.</p>
