<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sex didn&#39;t help much. It basically paused the level of arousal Ethan was feeling for a bit as he was too tired to continue after spending all of first period in the women&#39;s bathroom getting fucked by Haylee. This temporary relief only lasted about an hour. What was worse, was now Ethan was almost twice as aroused knowing that people knew that he and Haylee were missing for a full period. In his mind, rumors were already spreading. They really were not, but Ethan was not able to break himself out of his own fantasy at the moment.<br />
<br />
This was quickly becoming an issue too, as his pussy was almost permanently wet, making him not only quick to dehydrate, but also, if he was not careful and missed heading to the bathroom to reset after every class, he would soak a wet spot into his pants. Ethan was stuck on full blown horny mode. And worrying about being found out only turned him on more. It was an infinitly building cycle.<br />
<br />
Haylee noticed this and decided that before risking being exposed, she had to do something. So she made up an excuse to pull Ethan out of class for being sick, and since she drove him in, she amd Ethan were allowed to leave together early after a quick lie about his condition at the nurses office. Luckily the nurse was not really paying close attention amd mistook Ethan&#39;s sevear arousal as him just being ill.<br />
<br />
Haylee didn&#39;t bring Ethan home though. After informing Eric about what was happening and that she would pick him up later, she drove Ethan to a store she was very familiar with, a sex toy shop her older friend worked in. Her friend graduated last year and had gotten a job at this sex toy shop while she went to college. She knew a lot about all kinds of kinks and gave fairly good advice whenever Haylee had asked about them before, so Haylee figured she may know a way to deal with Ethan&#39;s humiliation issue too.<br />
<br />
The two of them entered the store and Haylee pulled Ethan into the back room and sat him down on a chair while she looked for her friend. The shop was empty of customers as usual durring the early morning hours. But she spotted her friend stocking a shelf quick enough. &quot;Hey Ashley, got a sec, I need some help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashely looked up after hearing her name called. &quot;Oh Hey! The hell are you doing here? Don&#39;t you have classes today, like right now even?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Skipped class for something that was more important. She&#39;s sitting in the back room already and needs some serious advice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She? Since when are you into girls?&quot; Asked Ashley with a rather surprised, but also very intrigued expression. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, well, there is a bit of a story around it. You might understand better if you saw her for yourself first, then hear the story behind it.&quot; Suggested Haylee, partly because she didn&#39;t know how to best explain their swapped sexes. Ashley stood up and accompanied Haylee to the back room. When she saw Ethan sitting there she became very confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you? No, how did you get back here in the first place?&quot; Started Ashley before Haylee stopped her. &quot;Hold on, this is the girl I am talking about. I brought her in.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Haylee... have you finally lost it? This is a guy. He has the body of someone who plays a physically demanding sport even.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True, she is very masculine looking. But not according to what&#39;s inbetween her thighs.&quot; Haylee informed. She then turned towards Ethan. &quot;Ephelia, this is my friend Ashley. She maybe has an idea on how to handle your issue. Ashley, this is my girlfriend, Ephelia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hello&quot; greeted Ephelia. Ashley just rolled her eyes at Haylee. &quot;Ephelia? He is clearly a guy. Even sounds like one too. Is this some kind of prank Haylee?&quot;<br />
<br />
Haylee sighed and looked again over at her girlfriend.  &quot;Ephelia, do you mind showing it to her? Trust me, she is not against seeing them and she is definitely trustworthy. She has seen mine before a few times already anyways so this should be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ephelia wasn&#39;t sure whether she was ok with doing it, but since she wasn&#39;t really against doing it either, she complied and pulled down her shorts, then panties. Ashley watched, fully expecting to be shown some kind of super small dick or something. But she was not expecting to see a genuine pussy. And not such a familiar looking one at that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah. Alright, I was wrong. Hey wait a second. What the fuck? Haylee, this is identical to your pussy. It even has the same group of 3 small moles in the same spot and everything. Ok, can you please tell me what is going on here, Haylee?&quot;<br />
<br />
Haylee and Ephelia spend the next few minutes explaining the details to Ashley, as well as the current issue Ephelia is having. They had to give a brief demonstration just to prove it, so now Ephelia once again had boobs. <br />
<br />
&quot;That ring is seriously fucking cool you two. And I now see why you like her Haylee. That cock is a monster, and she fits it perfectly you say? Lucky you. So, about your humiliation fetish issue. The best thing is going to be just with time, but you can do some trainings if you are into D/S play. As for her leaking durring classes. Just pick up a few adult sized diapers. They are very absorbent, and some can even be washed and reused. As for her horniness though. That will be difficult. A chastity belt won&#39;t exactly help either, since she doesn&#39;t need external stimulation to get herself all soaking wet. And I do not want to recommend medication unless absolutely necessary. Honestly I can think of just 2 options on the spot like this. Either just get it over with and spread the news, or just wait it out until it no longer is that exciting anymore. Normalcy is one of the least sexually stimulating things in the world. So aiming to make this your new normal,  would naturally take away the excitement factor as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Haylee and Ephelia looked at each other and shrugged. It did make sense. But how long would that take? And there is no way they could handle the general public knowing about it. The diapers were a good idea though. And Ephelia had to agree, no matter how much she disliked the idea of wearing them. So Haylee asked Ashley about buying some of them here, and Ashley smiled, knowing that Haylee didn&#39;t just want the diapers if she was asking her to get some for them. <br />
<br />
Ashely disappears into her store for a moment, then returns with a handful of items. First being a package of adult diapers, however, she brought back 2 different kinds of dildo inserts, and a remote vibrator for each of them. Haylee smiled excitedly at the display, and Ephelia was both turned on and embarrassed by the fact that she was turned on by the sight. The dampness in her shorts though gave away her real thoughts on the matter. <br />
<br />
So after Ashley set the first diaper up, she and Haylee slid it onto Ephelia, carefully pushing one of the dildo&#39;s into each of her holes, causing Ephelia to whimper and moan for the full process. Ashely handed Haylee a remote, as well as a QR code for each vibrator to use with a special phone app that Haylee quickly downloaded. So now as long as there was wifi, Haylee could activate the vibrators from anywhere in the world. <br />
<br />
They thanked Ashley for her help, especially Ephelia, as this was going to help her out a ton, even if only by a little bit. However as they are about to leave, Haylee was stopped by Ashley for a second and spoken to privately. &quot;Hey, are you truely serious about her? As in like, you want to eventually marry her serious?&quot; Asked Ashley. Haylee paused for a second to think it over before nodding yes. &quot;Alright, then just a bit of advice. That diaper dildo combo can potentially lead to her losing control over her bladder entirely. Some people love this idea, but it is a life altering change. She would essentially be diaper bound for the rest of her life if it got severe enough. So just keep that in mind. Maybe keep the use of the dildo inserts for only special days?&quot; cautions Ashley, really emphasizing how serious this could be if it went wrong. &quot;And always remember, just make sure that she is always ok with it. This girl seems like a natural Sub, so that means that you will need to make extra sure she isn&#39;t just complying with your ideas in order to just make you happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
After receiving the advice and warnings, Haylee and Ephelia finally left the shop. Haylee of course felt it would be fun to not give Ephelia back her pants, and instead bought a loose fitting dress at the shop that showed off her cleavage, and barely covered her big diapered booty, but only when standing completely still. As a gift, Haylee also let her keep her boobs for the next few hours too, with her back enjoying the temporary respite.</p>
