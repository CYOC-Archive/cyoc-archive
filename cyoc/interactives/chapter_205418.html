<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Note: Everyone will be speaking Japanese, however unlike the prior authors I will not be writing the r&#333;maji.<br />
<br />
It was simply labeled Suto Isao. Holding the phone to his ear he began to hear Japanese and understood it perfectly as if it was his native tounge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it is,&quot; he said laughing before slowly remembering who he used to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; the voice said. A man, and he sounded a bit displeased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Senpai I was talking to someone,&quot; Matt lied as he realized that he just addressed the random stranger as a Senpai instinctively.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need you to hurry and come to the gym. Everyone is going to be expecting you here within the next hour so you better make sure you get here on time.&quot; The man commanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-y-yes! Senpai! I&#39;ll be there in a half hour.&quot; Matt responded, feeling slightly nervous. He wasn&#39;t able to explain it, but he felt some sort of submissive nature overcome him as if he had to defer to this mysterious man. Bewildered enough at his new identity and recent actions, he hung up quickly hoping to resolve everything soon enough.<br />
<br />
After Matt got off the plan, he boarded a nearby Subway naturally as if he knew his destination. Matt felt at loss. He had no idea about anything that was happening or why but he did know that as long as he tried to remain slightly unconscious, his body would naturally make all the right choices. However, if he became too detached from himself, he felt that his new identity would completely overwhelm him. So Matt tried to focus on his name repeatedly inside his head, preventing any type of lost knowledge of his past self- NO! His real self.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok after this I&#39;m buying a ticket back to my home. Maybe that&#39;ll fix things.&quot; Matt thought as he boarded off the Subway. &quot;Then again I am stuck in 2009 ... but he should still exist right? Or maybe finding the man who gave him the ticket was a better idea?&quot; As Matt thought his legs walked him naturally toward the direction of a school gymanisum. It was only after he passed other school buildings that he realized that he was at his Middle School. &quot;No more like Kohei&#39;s&quot; Matt thought trying to remember he wasn&#39;t Kohei. As he felt conflicted, he didn&#39;t notice the person approaching him from the gym doors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uchimura-Kun! I expected you to be in a hurry not to be distracted and running everywhere but the gym.&quot; the familiar male voice said.<br />
<br />
Matt looked up to see a tall Japanese teenager staring at him. He was about 16 and well built, having defined muscles all over his body, but he wasn&#39;t too beefy, he just had good muscles. He was currently wearing a a sleeveless compression shirt and some shorts made of some sort of tight elastic material that showed off his muscles. Matt was so over taken looking at the teenager, he didn&#39;t even notice the glare on the handsome young man&#39;s face. He had short straight black hair cut into a neat trim, dark eyes, and tanned skin a bit darker than Matt&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uchimura-kun!&quot; the teen repeated himself alerting Matt to his lecherous behavior.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Isao!&quot; He said trying to regain composure of losing himself at the attractive teen. Since when was he attracted to guys? Heck who said he was? After all it&#39;s quite normal to appreciate the attractiveness of your male peers. However, the twitch Matt felt coming from his dick told otherwise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isao!?&quot; the teen exclaimed, wearing an expression of rage and confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I- meant Suto-Senpai,&quot; Matt said feeling flustered. Heck now he was messing up his own words. Whether due to the fact he was actually not Japanese or that he was distracted by his Senpai he wasn&#39;t sure. He hoped it was the first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets go inside and practice. The rest of the team will be here soon.&quot; Isao said as he walked back to the gym. Matt followed as he entered a gymnastic training room. Looking at Isao he felt some weird memories coming to him, he remembered how Isao was the best gymnast at the school, winning multiple meets and championships before he graduated to high school last year. However, since Kohei showed massive potential last year, the coach persuaded Isao to be an assistant coach at their school to help guide Kohei on to improving to be a gymanst like Isao.So every once in a while he would have solo training sessions with Isao, who was always pretty strict with him making Kohei feel as if he was being treated harshly intentionally.  The sessions did work since Kohei was getting better to the point where he was entering championships, it just was the fact that he had to endure his Senpai&#39;s cold dismeanor and bad attitude all the time. <br />
<br />
&quot;If he wasn&#39;t so hot I would never listen to him&quot; Kohei ... Matt thought shaking his head profusely bringing another strange look on to Isao&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;So the rest of your team will be arriving soon. They want to know about your experience at the Championship. However, I think Coach will be running late today from his other practice so I think you&#39;ll have to tell him separately.&quot; Isao said as he stretched near the mats laid on the ground. He turned back to face Matt and let out a hmph before speaking. &quot;So aren&#39;t you going to get changed!? We still need to fit in a bit of practice!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Senpai!&quot; Matt yelped feeling a bit red in the face as he walked to the lockerroom.<br />
<br />
Matt walked inside and set his duffel bag down before Matt decided to...</p>
