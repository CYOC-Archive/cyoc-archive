<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Bruce stirred the next morning, I woke up. I noticed he tried to be very careful to leave the tent without waking me, but I noticed nevertheless. No suprise, as I remembered, since I had had basically fallen asleep in his arms. It took me a few moments to wake up fully. My rock solid cock reminded me that I wanted to take care of something, and now was probably a good opportunity. As I stuck my hand into my sweatpants, I wondered what Bruce was up to. Probably taking a leak, like every normal guy did in the morning. I pictured him, just pissing away, but since I could only guess what he looked like down there, that didn&#39;t do much for me. I wondered, I mean, I could, probably, have a quick look at the real thing. <br />
I was sure that this was a really bad idea, but I was horny enough, so I silently crawled out of the tent and sneaked towards the bushes, careful neither to be seen nor be heard. I was right before: Bruce had a slightly different spot for his business than I did and was just arriving there, when I got nearer. I quickly looked around. There was only one place that I had a good view from and at the same time was well hidden. Unfortunately, that place was more or less exactly my peeing spot. Well, the things horny men do; I cowered in the damp foliage just at the time, Bruce unpacked his tool. Okay, that was even bigger than I expected. Fat like a salami and at least one and a half times as long as my own cock. When he let loose with a small sigh, the yellow liquid splattered all over the bush he was standing in front of. <br />
I could not help myself. I pawed at my rock hard cock furiously, only keeping enough self control to keep it quiet. I don&#39;t think Bruce could hear a lot over the sound of his piss hitting the leaves, but I really, really did not want to get caught masturbating to my buddy doing his morning business. It felt like ages, blissful ages, until the stream of his urine subsided and Bruce stuffed his salami back into his underwear. At the same time, I came, hard. White cum splattered against my hiding place and I was panting quietly. It must have been years since I had an orgasm that intense. I had not much time to muse, though, as Bruce returned to the campsite and I had to get back as well in order not to arise any questions.<br />
Thankfully, Bruce hadn&#39;t noticed anything and we proceeded as usual.<br />
Cowering in what was essentially my toilet had not improved my smell at all. As the morning sun dried up my clothes, I started to smell like a public men&#39;s room urinal. I was actually considering to take a bath in the stream and change my clothes, but, on the other hand, Bruce didn&#39;t seem to mind, so why should I?<br />
Not far into the morning, I noticed that Bruce was rubbing his temples and, finally, put away his book.<br />
&quot;I got a bad headache, so I think I&#39;m gonna go for a run&quot;, he said. That was, of course, entirely unlike the old Bruce, but then again, so was that bull of a man&#39;s body he had. I just nodded and watched him take off.<br />
As he was gone, I remembered that I actually had not taken my morning piss this morning, since I had been a little busy jacking off to my buddy.<br />
I was just about to go to the bushes to get that done, when I had a better idea. I actually enjoyed the taste of my urine the day before and there was an empty water bottle nearby. Without much of a second thought, I put my dick into the bottle and started filling it up. Since I felt rather thirsty, I took some big gulps out of the bottle directly after that.<br />
Sure, the clear water here was great, but the flavor of my piss was just as good, if not better. I briefly wandered if all piss tastes the same, but put that thought away quickly.<br />
A bit later, Bruce returned, sweaty all over his glistening torso, but apparently refreshed. I was probably a bit lost in the sight of his muscular chest, so I only noticed a significant change after a few moments. On both of his temples, there was a tiny nub, a small white horn to be seen.<br />
That should have freaked me out a lot. I mean, who had heard of a man with horns before?<br />
But, strangely enough, it didn&#39;t. As with Bruce&#39;s other changes, I just... accepted it. The horns looked rather well on his head, too. They gave him a bit of a wild touch.<br />
&quot;Phew, that&#39;s better&quot;, said Bruce. He slumped back into his camping chair, which creaked ominously, and picked up his book again. he didn&#39;t really come far, though. I watched as he read the same page twice and squinted his eyes as if he had difficulties reading. Probably, the headache had not went away entirely, I figured.<br />
With a sigh, he put down the book again. &quot;So. How are you holding up, by the way?&quot;<br />
I blinked. &quot;Holding up? With what?&quot;<br />
&quot;Your breakup? You know, the reason you decided to come here&quot;, Bruce said in a mocking tone.<br />
I was genuinely confused. The breakup, my ex. How could I have forgotten that? I really did not waste a single thought to that since we arrived for good. The place was really good at distracting you. <br />
&quot;Actually, pretty well&quot;, I said truthfully. It was true: I could think of my ex without much of a heartache, a state of mind, I usually took months to aqcuire after a breakup. &quot;Suprisingly well&quot;, I added.<br />
&quot;Hey, that&#39;s cool&quot;, Bruce replied. &quot;You know, I was always wondering how you two fit together. I didn&#39;t think she was your type, to be honest.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I heard that a lot. Actually, I don&#39;t really know. Perhaps I need to redefine &#39;my type&#39; when I go dating again. The &#39;busty blonde&#39; doesn&#39;t really work anymore. Perhaps someone dark haired, or flat-chested&quot;, I mused, without thinking. Flat-Chested? How did that slip out? <br />
&quot;That sounds more like a guy than a girl&quot;, Bruce replied amused. &quot;Are you going gay now?&quot;<br />
I boxed his arm. &quot;You know I&#39;m straight like an arrow&quot;, I laughed.<br />
Bruce did me the favor of holding his arm, although I was sure he didn&#39;t even feel it. &quot;Yeah, yeah, it was just a joke. You and me both, straight as they come.&quot;, he reassured me.<br />
&quot;Although I have to admit&quot;, I continued, &quot;sometimes I do feel a little... curious. Not gay, you know, just... curious.&quot; <br />
Bruce didn&#39;t answer to that, just nodded, apparently knowingly. I guess he felt the same way sometimes. That nod made my heart skip a beat for a reason, a small and volatile butterfly feeling arising and subsiding in my chest.<br />
Before there could any weird silence take hold between the two of us, I spoke again:<br />
&quot;Uh, you know, there&#39;s something I need to get off my chest. You know, this morning, I...&quot;, wait, what was I doing? Ryan, stop, you&#39;re making things weirder. But it was too late, my mouth was already blabbering, seemingly disconnected from my brain, &quot;I kind of sneaked after you when you left the tent and... watched you&quot;.<br />
&quot;You watched me?&quot;, Bruce sounded more confused than anything else, especially, not a sign of anger was in his voice.<br />
That encouraged me to explain. &quot;Y-yes, I watched you, you know, pee.&quot;. There, I said it. Of course I didn&#39;t mention I furiously masturbated to that, but the main thing was out in the open now. I awaited his reaction and was mentally packing to go home in shame. Why did I have to mention that?<br />
&quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Bruce said. <br />
&quot;Okay?&quot;, I asked, incredulously. How could that be okay? He sounded like it was the most normal thing in the world.<br />
&quot;Why not, if you like. We&#39;re both guys, so what?&quot;, he still sounded calm and sincere, not a trace of any ill thought in his voice.<br />
I admit, the following silence was a bit weird, but apparently, only for me. Like the good accountant Bruce was, he had just filed away that topic and it was done for him.<br />
Back to my woodcarving. The wingless bird started to look less like a snake and more like a penis, but that was probably just my imagination from the prior topics. Bruce hadn&#39;t picked up his book again, but was just enjoying the sun with his eyes closed. That gave me the opportunity to catch a glimpse here and there, and admire how well the sunshine accented his little horn-nubs and shone on his bare torso. The air was filled with bird songs and a mix of the smell of summer flowers and two very unwashed guys. It was peaceful and relaxing.<br />
It was afternoon, when Bruce got up. He stretched and looked at me.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna go take a piss now. You wanna come?&quot;<br />
That hit me as a surprise. Not only did he not care much about me following him this morning, but he invited me to tag along now? I was about to politely decline, but thought for a moment. Apparently, he was really cool with it, and, I must admit, picturing him handling his tool again got me pretty excited again. So I put down my work and followed him, as he went to the bushes again.<br />
&quot;You know, I noticed I&#39;m peeing a lot more than before lately&quot;, Bruce made conversation. &quot;And more often, too. But that&#39;s probably because I am finally drinking enough here.&quot;<br />
The latter was definitly true for me as well. The bottle full of piss had been gone pretty fast and the water here was fantastic, so I found myself drinking a lot more than usually.<br />
&quot;Here we go&quot;, Bruce said, and fished his thick dick out of his sweatpants and underwear, aiming at the leaves and letting go.<br />
I had grown almost painfully hard on the way here and was briefly considering trying to readjust myself to hide it. I really didn&#39;t feel like hiding anymore today, so with a mental &quot;why the hell not&quot;, I fished out my rod as well and started pumping in earnest. <br />
God, that was so weird. Here my friend Bruce was pissing into the wild, and I was masturbating directly next to him, my eyes glued to his tool.<br />
My actions did provoke a raised eyebrow on his side, but no comment or hostile gesture. Instead, as the situation went on (and Bruce had certainly not lied about how much more urine he was packing), I could see his dick stiffen while he was pissing. Apparently, Bruce was getting turned on by this as well. When his stream slowly subsided, I rolled my eyes back and, came, for the second time today, in a wide arc into the bushes. I was still catching my breath, as Bruce tried to tuck his member away into his underwear again. However, he did not seem to be overly successful with that; his slip was already filled to its brim with his package when he was soft, but there was just no way to contain him hard. <br />
After a short while, Bruce grew annoyed by the situation, and just grabbed his slip with both hands, shredding the tortured piece of fabric. &quot;Guess I&#39;m just going commando&quot;, he grinned, and tucked his dick into his sweatpants, creating a most obvious outline for the world to see. If I hadn&#39;t just bust my nut, I would probably have grown hard immediately again.<br />
We made our way back to the campsite without much of a word about what just happened. Again, I had the impression that Bruce took all of this a little too well, as if he didn&#39;t even think about how strange we were both behaving.<br />
Bruce proceeded to work out until dinner, push-ups to be more exact. I&#39;d really like to say I did something else, but in reality, I was just busy watching him.<br />
When it was time for bed, it had grown cold again. However, I really had no inhibitions tonight and immediately snuggled up to Bruce, when he laid down. He put his arm around me and his body odor covered me like a heavy blanket. I could clearly feel his loose dick through his sweatpants and, while I dozed off again, could even feel him stiffen up a bit against my butt.</p>
