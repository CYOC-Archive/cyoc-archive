<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy sat quietly on the bus as him and Lancer rode to the address the stranger had given to him. The night was starting to take over and the overhead lights of the streets were turning on. Lancer tried to make small talk asking what things were, but Troy ended up only giving him simple answers. A strained awkwardness seemed to have developed between Troy and Lancer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Lancer asked as they got off the bus.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No,&quot; Troy lied. He&#39;d already started walking towards the address listed and didn&#39;t even look back at Lancer when the big lion asked. &quot;Everything&#39;s fine. Let&#39;s just get this done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite the height difference, Lancer almost felt like he needed to keep at a jogging pace to keep up with Troy. The small human was so dead set on the destination that he wasn&#39;t slowing down in the slightest. &quot;Are you sure? Was it the battle? That control thing sure was weird...&quot; Lancer continued talking. &quot;I couldn&#39;t do anything. It&#39;s like I was telling my body to stop but all I could do was protect that Drew human. It was a good idea turning us into mice. Then we couldn&#39;t really do much to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it also meant there were hundreds of you. Not to mention how I almost stepped on a few of them, almost killing them,&quot; Troy dismissed.<br />
<br />
Lancer went quiet. He hadn&#39;t meant to upset Troy, only try to cheer the victory. There were other things he would have wanted to say, but anything that would have come out would have probably only upset the human even more. Instead, Lancer tried to keep his mind occupied with the strange little subdivision they were walking through. It was strange to him how so many houses were lined up in rows that looked almost identical. Each one had their very own yard that was cut to perfection. Several even had lights next to their front doors.<br />
<br />
Troy stopped in front of one of the houses. It was completely dark. No lights were on in any part of the house and it looked as though several newspapers laid on his front porch. Troy look at the numbers on the paper, back up to the house and then the paper again confirming that it&#39;s the right place. He walked up to the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait!&quot; Lancer rushed out in front of him. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we come up with some kind of plan first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Troy dismissed again. The cold harshness in his voice wasn&#39;t something that Lancer had heard from him before. Even though they&#39;d only known each other for a few days, this didn&#39;t feel like Troy&#39;s normal personality. &quot;We won&#39;t even know what he can do. Any amount of surprise will still be surprising. If he has book of the body I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll make us tiny. Book of time, he&#39;ll just rewind it and we&#39;ll still know nothing. Book of magic, he&#39;s got some kind of spell to fuck us over. Book of Transmutation, he&#39;ll just turn us into a desk lamp. So we might as well get this over with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancer stood a bit shocked. &quot;But... But...&quot; he sputtered out. This was far to defeatist. It didn&#39;t make sense. He tried to think of a rebuttal, but Troy had already pushed past him for the door. Even worse, he knocked! &quot;What are you doing!&quot; Lancer hissed pulling Troy to the side. Luckily none of the lights had turned on in the house. Best case scenario, the book owner wasn&#39;t home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting this over with,&quot; Troy glared. He pulled out of Lancer&#39;s grasp and knocked again. <br />
<br />
However, Troy was only able to get one knock off before the large lion man pulled him back again. &quot;Are you serious! Are you trying to get yourself killed!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy shrugged.<br />
<br />
A cold chill shot through Lancer&#39;s spine. The distant nonplussed look from Troy only made him feel more upset. His face formed into a snarl. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; he demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Troy replied. He held up the book. &quot;Hold this and then lift this little flap up.&quot; His finger went to the mail slot built inside of the door.<br />
<br />
Lancer refused. &quot;Not until you tell me what&#39;s wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
For a moment, Troy showed some kind of emotion. Rage. It only flashed for a second before he grabbed the book. &quot;Command, Lancer, hold the book next to the mail slot and lift the flap up. Shape.&quot; As he added the word shape, Troy body began to shrink. Bright orange colors started to appear around his fingers while the rest of his skin looked slimy and green. Smaller and smaller he got until he was just a little tiny tree frog sticking to the book. <br />
<br />
Lancer then followed the command and watched as Troy reverted back to his human form on the other side of the door with just his finger touching the book. He then unlocked the door and opened it. He took the book back from Lancer. &quot;Come on...&quot; he ordered.<br />
<br />
The order sent Lancer for a loop. His whiskers bristled as the command spell wore off of him. He felt the minor headache in the back of his head start to form and throb. &quot;Troy, what&#39;s going on?&quot; he demanded this time. It took a lot to keep his anger down, but hearing the absolute defeated way Troy was talking, Lancer didn&#39;t want to make things worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Troy lied. He turned around the the two story house to find that it was completely and totally normal. The living room was immaculately clean. It looked more like a scene out of a catalogue instead of a place someone were living in. The couch had two end tables on either side with matching lamps. Magazines and a Louvre photo book were placed on the coffee table between the TV and couch. A single recliner that looked like it had never been used pointed there as well.<br />
<br />
Then there was the huge purple dildo stuck to the ground directly in front of the wooden stairs.<br />
<br />
Troy and Lancer paused as they looked at it. Both cleared their throats and tried to look away, though Troy was the first to speak. &quot;Well, let&#39;s start looking for the book.&quot; He held up his own and continued into the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait!&quot; Lancer jumped in front of Troy. His eyes looked back at the dildo for a second before focusing on the human. &quot;I think we need to talk. Alright? What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot; Troy&#39;s brow furrowed. The frown on his face only accentuated his anger even more.<br />
<br />
Lancer wasn&#39;t sure if he liked this emotion more or less than the nonplussed one he&#39;d been displaying. &quot;That&#39;s clearly not true. What&#39;s going on?&quot; he pressured.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Troy echoed the question back. The anger in his voice made it raise a bit louder than he would normally speak. &quot;Fine. Since you won&#39;t shut the fuck up about it...&quot; He took a moment to breathe before raising his voice. &quot;You&#39;re not real! I&#39;m going to go to bed and then wake up and you&#39;re going to be in your own world again while I&#39;m in mine! Okay! I&#39;m sorry that I don&#39;t want to pacify the feelings of something from the figment of someone else&#39;s imagination! Alright! I just want to find this stupid fucking book and get this whole thing over and then move on with my fucking life! Okay! Jesus...&quot; he stormed around Lancer and began looking through a bookshelf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait? What do you mean I&#39;m not real?&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy let out an angry sigh, but didn&#39;t turn around. &quot;Mark made you in his DnD campaign so he could make fun of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about? I don&#39;t really know Mark, but that doesn&#39;t sound like him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it does. Why else would you exist? He knew that I liked antrho lions, made you so we could &#39;have a relationship&#39; and then make fun of me with his friends. That&#39;s all,&quot; Troy stopped looking through the bookshelf.<br />
<br />
Lancer hugged Troy from behind. His big arms wrapped tightly around the little human. He nuzzled his hairy mane against Troy&#39;s bare face. &quot;Is that really what you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What else is there to think?!&quot; Troy shouted. He tried to pull out of the hug. He wasn&#39;t near strong enough. &quot;You knew his world even though you&#39;d never been there. And you heard his friend. I&#39;m just some kind of degenerate!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancer&#39;s hug tightened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you stop! You&#39;re not real! None of this is real!&quot; Troy struggled harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s not real then why can&#39;t you get out of my grasp? Hmm?&quot; Lancer taunted. His deep whisper rumbled through Troy&#39;s ear. A tingle ran through the small human&#39;s body as he felt the overwhelming powerful presence of the lion holding him so tightly, yet comforting. The soft sway only asserting his power even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I&#39;m not real, then why do I want to kiss you?&quot; Lancer gently kissed the side of Troy&#39;s neck. His hands started to fidget with the bottom of Troy&#39;s shirt and lifted it over the human&#39;s head. &quot;Hmmm?&quot; He continued to taunt as his kisses lowered down Troy&#39;s body. The coarse tawny fur tickled his bare flesh.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-b-because...&quot; Troy moaned. His body was giving in. He didn&#39;t want Lancer to stop. His brain had stopped as Lancer pulled down his shorts and underwear. The gentle way his claws ran against Troy&#39;s skin made the small human shudder. However, Lancer&#39;s touch disappeared. Troy looked around. His naked body craving the attention of the other man. A bit of a whine escaped him as he saw Lancer by the staircase picking up the dildo.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I&#39;m not real, then why do you miss me?&quot; Lancer smirked. The confidence in Lancer&#39;s voice cut through all of the doubt that Troy had. Troy&#39;s face burned bright red. Each stride Lancer made back to him made him feel so delicate and small. But then Lancer lowered himself to his knees. <br />
<br />
Troy&#39;s dick throbbed with anticipation. Watching Lancer open his mouth wide and run his tongue along his cock sent a flurry of emotions through him. Troy naturally reached out and grabbed the top of Lancer&#39;s head. His fingers gripped onto the powerful mane that the lion had. He heard a confident laugh come from the lionman.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I&#39;m not real, then how can I do this?&quot; he bragged as he swallowed Troy&#39;s dick. It slid all the way to the back of Lancer&#39;s throat and that tongue expertly licked and lapped at the rod. Troy&#39;s mind was working in overdrive as he tried to hold onto himself. His mind had gone through so many emotions over the last few hours that he can&#39;t think. It doesn&#39;t help that Lancer was also starting to push that purple dildo against his hole.<br />
<br />
&quot;L-L-L--&quot; Troy couldn&#39;t make out Lancer&#39;s name as more of the dildo was shoved deep inside him. His hole spread wide as the thing slipped inside of him. It almost seemed to be self-lubricating. With barely any pressure it easily slid inside of Troy, sending the man to the moon. His other hand went to Lancer&#39;s head and both griped the lion&#39;s skull with all their might.<br />
<br />
It brought out a bit of a chuckle from Lancer as he continued to toy with the human. Each little lick and push and pull of the dildo sent another shocking pulse of pleasure through Troy&#39;s body. Watching Troy fall to his natural reactions and not be able to control himself was far more fun than he could have ever imagined. The little human squirmed in his pleasure, doing everything that he could to not finish.<br />
<br />
Though, that was impossible.<br />
<br />
Lancer felt Troy&#39;s body jerk and then his mouth fill with cum. The series of shots hit the back of his throat as he pulled out. Troy&#39;s body went limp over Lancer&#39;s body. &quot;Doing okay?&quot; Lancer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh...&quot; Troy muttered in his sexual haze. Slowly he was lowered down onto the ground. However, he felt a strange book underneath his left hand.<br />
<br />
&#39;With all of human&#39;s ingenuity to invent, use the book of transmutation to build the world you would like to see. Revert.&#39;<br />
<br />
With that, a bright light surrounded Troy and he found himself floating in that nearly empty white void again. Nearly empty because there was one other person sitting right next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re disgusting, you know that?&quot; the man said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? What?&quot; Troy looked around and saw him. &quot;What the hell!?&quot; he tried to cover himself up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting a blowy from a lion. That&#39;s disgusting,&quot; the man repeated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! What?!&quot; Troy didn&#39;t know who this was. &quot;Where&#39;d you come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re ass...&quot; he scowled. &quot;Just get it over with... Not like I can do anything anyways...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Okay?&quot; Troy looked through the spells. He wasn&#39;t really into inanimate transformations all that much. &quot;What were you going to do with your book?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; the man looked up. &quot;Oh that. Turn everyone who pissed me off into sex objects and then sell them off. Real personalized experiences for each one. It would have been so much fucking fun.&quot; The smile on his face only made a chill run down Troy&#39;s spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Troy nodded. &#39;Maybe being a dildo wasn&#39;t the worst thing for him...&#39; he thought to himself as he chanted, &#39;inanimate,&#39; again thinking about that self lubricating dildo. Though, this time thinking of it more as a cyan blue instead of the deep purple it had been. <br />
<br />
Troy felt it pull out of his ass. &quot;EEP!&quot; he squirmed in Lancer&#39;s grasp as the lion gently removed the toy. However, the scream came more from seeing the man in the bowler hat sitting across from them watching. Troy grabbed the book and pointed at him. &quot;What are you doing here?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that...&quot; the man smiled. &quot;Didn&#39;t work out too well for the last guy...&quot; his eyes looked over at the dildo. &quot;I prefer purple... But I guess he&#39;s not mine to play with anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you did this?&quot; Troy asked, glancing back at the dildo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; the man shrugged. &quot;He tried to transform me, so I just used the spell against him. Though, I think I was a bit nicer than he was... Or maybe I&#39;m just not nearly as creative.&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy wondered just how lucky he&#39;d gotten off. The concept that some guy would be going around changing people willy nilly into inanimant objects could have been really scary. &quot;Maybe that&#39;s a good thing...&quot; he added. Though, maybe it was just that he didn&#39;t really feel all that creative either. <br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; the man with a bowler cap responded. He stood up and headed for the door. &quot;It&#39;s been so long since we&#39;ve seen each other, however I&#39;m afraid I must leave...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Troy shouted. &quot;What about the next clue!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh,&quot; the man shrugged again tossing his cane into his hand. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re work it out.&quot; He smiled and left.</p>
