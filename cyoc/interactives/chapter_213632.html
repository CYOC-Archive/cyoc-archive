<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy had apparently stashed all of her pants and non-sexy underwear outside of her apartment. Apparently she liked the idea of you having no choice but to wear the incredibly sexy and feminine options in her very goth wardrobe. She hadn&#39;t told Heather where the cloths were, or at least that was what Heather said. She seemed to enjoy watching you in that body. Personally, you wanted to wear something a bit more casual to such an important meeting. Instead, the thong sliding up your ass only added to the discomfort of no longer being able to remove yourself from Amy&#39;s body. Accompanied by the push up bra, black leather mini-skirt, and a shirt that might as well have been a corset you felt like you were more prepared for a club then a meeting that would decide the course of the rest of your life. A life where you would hopefully be reunited with your lost dick.<br />
<br />
You and Heather entered the Magic Shop to see the old shopkeeper. When he looked up, he gave a look of shock. &quot;No! Not you!&quot; You briefly remembered how Amy had said the shopkeeper knew her. You now realize that you should have asked more about that.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t understand! &quot; you start but were cut off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand that last time I needed a mop after you were done browsing! You didn&#39;t even buy anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
While the mop comment left you with questions, you decided to focus on the problems at hand. &quot;I&#39;m not who you think I am!&quot; That gave him a pause. &quot;I bought a zipper the other day.&quot;<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper eyes narrowed. &quot;You&#39;re that boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember me?&quot;<br />
<br />
He shrugged. &quot;I only sold one zipper this week.&quot; His eyes trailed up and down Amy&#39;s body. &quot;She&#39;s a nuisance, but good choice in body.&quot; You squirmed a little at the observation. &quot;Knowing her, I&#39;m guessing she wasn&#39;t taken unwillingly. Who&#39;s idea was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her&#39;s.&quot; You inform him.<br />
<br />
He nodded. &quot;That tracks. So what are you here for.&quot; His eyes drifted towards Heather. &quot;Looking for some extra toys for you and your friend here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather&#39;s eyes lit up. &quot;We can get stuff like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper nodded. &quot;Focus!&quot; You told her. &quot;The zipper was stolen.&quot;<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper paled. &quot;You should not have taken it off!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t. Heather did.&quot;<br />
<br />
When the both of you turned to Heather she held her hands up. &quot;Amy said it was completely safe. She kind if got off on the idea of you only being released with my permission. She&#39;s a bit into bondage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s into a lot of things, bondage is the first normal one I&#39;ve heard of.&quot; The shopkeeper said exasperated. &quot;There is a reason why the directions don&#39;t say you can remove the zipper. It leads to the potentialof this exact situation. I hope you like that body, because you won&#39;t see your&#39;s again without your zipper. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t you sell me another one?&quot; You tried.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could, but it won&#39;t free you. Only the exact zipper you used can free you. Any other zipper will reduce you to a suit, exactly like the one you saw your friend turned into when you used it on her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, there is nothing you can do for us?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
He though about it for a moment. &quot;You? No. For her, yes. Its not perfect, but I can keep her from living the rest of her life in a coma. A special tea. If you drink it, she will awaken. You will still have control of the body but she will be able to experience everything with you. Unfortunately she will only be a voice in your head. Her emotions and desires will bleed over but besides that you will have complete control. Its not more than a half life, but it is better than sleeping forever. &quot;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s not even a question for you. Her desires bleeding over would be awkward but Amy was a friend. You would do what you could for her.&quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded. &quot;Look around and I&#39;ll prepare the tea.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Heather went immediately behind a curtain that said 18+. You shift your weight, your legs rubbing reminding you of the absence of your old friend. At least the other friend could be brought back.<br />
<br />
While the shopkeeper prepared the tea he heard Heather call out. &quot;What does this do?&quot;<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper leaned over the counter to better see what she was holding out from beyond the curtain. &quot;Its a strap-on that turns into a real dick and balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this is going in the basket.&quot; Heather returned to her shopping. <br />
<br />
The shopkeeper finished the tea and gave it to you. After drinking it, you suddenly hear Amy&#39;s voice in your head.<br />
<br />
(The shopkeeper? How&#39;d I get back in the store?)<br />
<br />
&quot;It worked!&quot; You said.<br />
<br />
(Why did I say that? I can&#39;t move my body.) She sounded more curious than concerned. <br />
<br />
&quot;We lost the zipper.&quot; You say out loud. &quot;I can&#39;t get out of you.&quot; <br />
<br />
(Really?) She sounded intrigued as you began to feel damp between your legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you not concerned?&quot; You were annoyed by her response. <br />
<br />
(Well, I always liked the idea of possessions. You even got me conscious so I can enjoy it. Besides, neither of us being able to decide when we get out of this makes it hotter. It&#39;s like the ultimate bondage experience. ) Your arousal heightens as you feel your nipples begin to erect.<br />
<br />
Heather returned with an anal plug that had a cat tail attached. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you stick it in it turns into a real working tail. There is a cat ear headband that sinks into the head and becomes real ears when the tail is inserted if you want the full set.&quot; The shopkeeper said blandly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes please!&quot; Heather announced. <br />
<br />
(OH please tell me she is getting that for us!) Amy cheered.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH my God. &quot; you say. &quot;No matter what we say she just gets hornier.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Amy always had kind of a leaky faucet if you know what I mean.&quot; Heather answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your not much better. Buying sex toys while I&#39;m trapped like this. Do either of you even care if Amy gets her body back?&quot;<br />
<br />
(Honesty, I&#39;ve always felt like my purpose was to be a skinsuit. A suit should be worn. I felt empty before you put me on. Now, my life is full.)<br />
<br />
&quot;And the fact that I&#39;m a guy doesn&#39;t bother you?&quot; You asked. <br />
<br />
(It actually makes this hotter.) Amy said. (I&#39;m looking forward to you learning about a woman&#39;s body and experiencing things with you. Sex, your first period, giving birth...)<br />
<br />
&quot;Giving birth!&quot; You cried.<br />
<br />
Heather took a step closer and put one arm around your shoulds, while her other hand rested on your stomach. &quot;I always wanted to be a mother, and I would love for you to be the surrogate who carries my egg.&quot;<br />
<br />
(I&#39;m into guys but if you want us to be a lesbian from now on, I&#39;ll follow your lead.) Amy&#39;s excitement was beginning to slide down your legs. <br />
<br />
You swat her Heather&#39;s hand away. &quot;Down girl, I&#39;m not ready to give up on being the father yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is nothing else I can do for you. Shouting at yourself tells me she is awake. If you can find your thief maybe you can return to yourself. Otherwise I suggest you prepare yourself for life as &#39;Amy.&#39; Now begone. With her awake, it is only a matter of time before I need to clean up one if her messes. I will leave you this last piece of advice. You do not have to speak allowed for her to hear you. It will make you seem less crazy to think at her then speak to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Heather bought her large bag of supplies. Once outside you asked, &quot;what all did you get?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather smiled. &quot;So much. What to you want to do?&quot; She shook the bag. &quot;Play a little, or do you have any idea where else we can go to do detective work?</p>
