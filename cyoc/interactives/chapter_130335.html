<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt watched as the security guard went around asking people what had happened. No one seemed to remember what he would have been called about. Each person just made him that much angrier as he made his way around from student to student then stopping on Matt. &quot;Did you see what happened? I was told it was urgent but I don&#39;t know what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... You see those two guys over there?&quot; Matt pointed at Austin and Ryan. They looked like they were having a pretty good conversation. &quot;They had sex on the counter over there. Right in front of the cashier.&quot;<br />
<br />
The security guard just stared. The blank expression on his face was enough for Matt to know that the Chronivac still worked. &quot;The things they call me for,&quot; the security guard complained. &quot;Oh, Carlos go be a security guard. They don&#39;t do much. Bah... If you see anything that I might care about make sure you give me a call.&quot;  He kept muttering as he walked out of the cafeteria too distracted to notice that Matt had pulled out a small device and started typing away.<br />
<br />
Carlos still had his shift to worry about. Being on the college campus not too much happened but he still had to make his presence known. The campus had long decided that campus security wasn&#39;t allowed to be holed up in their offices. They had to go around and at the very least seem friendly with the students on campus. However today the students kept giving him odd looks. Normally he didn&#39;t draw this much attention. His 5&#39;5&quot; 160 pound frame made it hard for a lot of the students to even notice him. But today it was like they wouldn&#39;t stop looking at him.<br />
<br />
&#39;What&#39;s going on today?&#39; he questioned himself. He pulled at his collar. It was starting to feel tight around his neck. Because of his shorter height he had built a pretty muscular build. Underneath the uniform his pecs pushed out the front of his shirt while his tight ass could be easily seen in his pants. But for some reason everything still felt a little tighter on his frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carlos,&quot; his walky talkie buzzed. &quot;Come in Carlos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Carlos,&quot; he buzzes back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a reason we&#39;re getting reports that you&#39;re not in uniform today?&quot; the radio asked. &#39;Huh?&#39; Carlos looked down at his uniform he&#39;d worn everyday since he&#39;d gotten the job. The dark blue shirt and pants is what he wore everyday. Even if it felt a little tighter than usual today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t know,&quot; he responded. &quot;Probably just some kids being assholes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Probably...&quot; the radio responded. <br />
<br />
Carlos rolled his eyes. These students always liked to cause some kind of trouble. But his thought turned back to his straining clothes. They were often a little uncomfortable but today was getting unbearable. Even his shoes were feeling tight around his feet. It didn&#39;t make any sense. He&#39;d worn a size seven and a half since he&#39;d graduated and now they were too small. He went back to trying to ignore the feeling. But with each step it felt like it was getting worse. Like his clothes were straining more and more against his body. Even his belt felt like it was pulling against his hips. He had to see what was going on.<br />
<br />
Stepping into the bathroom he had a moment of privacy. He looked in the mirror. &quot;What the Hell?&quot; his mouth dropped as he looked over himself. Everything he was wearing looked several sizes too small on him. Not because the clothes had shrunk but because he&#39;d grown. His blue shirt untucked from his waistband and was starting to rise up to his belly button, his pants rose well above his black socks and his shoes looked like they were ready to burst from the size of his feet. Huge muscles were crammed into his small clothing. What had been a perfect fit was now ready to rip from his body. <br />
<br />
He started with his belt. It was digging waist. The leather refused to stretch at all. Proportionally his waist stayed the same. But he could see the bottom of his six pack looking more defined. The thick blocky ab muscles show between the growing rift between his pants and shirt. Carlos winces in pain as his feet tear free from their confine. His toes push through the front of his shoe. Big feet crush the rest of his shoe. He steps back and hears a rip in his pants. Huge tears roll down the seams of his pants. He bends over tearing a hole behind his huge muscular ass. &quot;Ahhh!&quot; he grunts. His upper body flexes as it falls in on itself tearing his shirt into shreds. The tatters of his clothes fall to the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the Hell?&quot; he mutters again looking at the mirror. He could swear he was still growing. Looking down he sees he&#39;s only wearing a pair of dark blue posers. It&#39;s the same color that his uniform always was. There&#39;s a badge attached to it with his radio and two nightsticks. He does a double take. &#39;That&#39;s not a nightstick,&quot; his hand touches the sensitive flesh. For a second his knees buckle from the pleasure. He grips the sink for support. The was a small crack developing on the back of the wall as he pushed himself back up.<br />
<br />
Carlos stands back up at his 6&#39;8&quot; height. He guesses he weighs somewhere around 280 pounds. That&#39;s a bit of an understatement. He&#39;s well past 300 hundred pounds of pure muscle. His broad shoulders couldn&#39;t even fit in the bathroom mirror. He cups the huge pec in his hand as he looks down at the rest of his body. &quot;So I guess this is my uniform?&quot; he looks himself over again flexing his giant muscles. Even though he&#39;s nearly naked in public Carlos feels completely comfortable. But another part of him wondered if he&#39;d even be able to fit into another uniform.</p>
