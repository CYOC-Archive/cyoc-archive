<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Closing his eyes again, Jeff tell himself a couple of times &quot;This isn't happening, this isn't happening, this isn't happening!&quot; when someone walks over to his prone jackass body.<br />
<br />
Hearing and feeling the presence of someone coming closer, he realizes now, that he knew this same person was close by the whole time, watching him. But Jeff did not notice this before the person's approach.<br />
<br />
Kneeling down to pet the donkey's face, the man tries feeding him a carrot stick. From Jeff's perspective, he thought &quot;wtf? This person is petting me!&quot; and &quot;what is he trying to hand to me?&quot; His lack of colored eyesight prevented Jeff from knowing it was a carrot. He could smell the thing with more clarity than he ever smelled a carrot in his life. But he had no idea that it was a carrot he smelled, since carrots don't really have too much of a smell to humans.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, and trying to ask &quot;who are you?&quot; Jeff could, once again, only bray like the jackass he made himself out to me.<br />
<br />
Almost as if reading his mind, the man spoke up and said, &quot;I am the inventor of the chronivac. My name is Dr. Marcoh. Using my device, you have turned yourself into a donkey.&quot;<br />
<br />
With spirits rising, Jeff was hoping he would say &quot;I am here to help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead, continuing his monologue of an explanation, Dr. Marcoh said to Jeff: &quot;Your father came home and found a big, overgrown jackass in the prime of his life in his twin boys' bathroom. In your bathroom, Jeff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I know this?&quot; continues Marcoh. &quot;I know this because all chronivac machines transmits wirelessly the exact specification of a person's transformation directly to my computer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While I understand that most people desire to live out a simpler life by transforming themselves into some animal or another, I think it's rather strange that you didn't want your transformation to be complete by transforming your mind completely into that of a jackass. You busted your chronivac with 5 seconds to spare, preserving your intelligence as a 14 year old human boy. A 14 year old boy stuck in the body of a young adult male jackass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not only did you turn yourself completely into a donkey, preserved your intelligence, but you also allowed just enough time to take your speech away. So now I cannot even pick your brain to find out why you wanted this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trying to respond, all Jeff could do was lay there and bray out the response that formed in his head, but was unable to cross his lips. Jeff wanted to ask Marcoh if he could turn him back into a boy again. But alas, Marcoh obviously couldn't understand a word Jeff was trying to say.<br />
<br />
Marcoh just simply stood up, and said &quot;if you are trying to talk, I am afraid there is no way for me to understand what you are trying to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All I know, is that you are just going to be spending some amount of time just standing around on all fours in the big grassy field behind my barn, until I find someone to sell you to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT!?&quot; You're going to SELL me!?&quot; Is what Jeff wanted to say. All that came out, was an abrupt, high-pitched, horrible &quot;HEE-HAWW, HEE-HAWW&quot; out of his ridiculous donkey's mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll love who I have in mind of selling you to. She'll make sure you are taken care of, and well-fed. Her current jackass stud is getting a bit on the old side, and she needs a replacement. You'll enjoy yourself at her farm. I promise! It'll be better than you probably originally thought when you wanted to become a donkey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! A stud! Which reminds me! You need to rise up on your feet, so I can force-ejaculate you. Your semen that you have begun to produce as a human going through puberty, still resides within your ball-sack. We need to ejaculate your human semen completely so you can become 100% effective right from the get-go of the sale.&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting scared, and panic starting to rise in him realizing there was no way to communicate with Marcoh about how he didn't expect the chronivac to turn him into an ACTUAL donkey, and how it's all a mistake, all he could do was just lay there on his right-hand side, bucking his legs out and braying uncontrollably, just trying to say at least ONE word!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey hey! I know you are excited, but I need you to calm down!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excited? Excited!? you actually THINK I REALLY wanted this!?&quot; &quot;Heee-haaww, hee-haww, hheeeee....heeee....heeeee.....HAAAWWWW!!! He-haw!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit! It's useless! It's getting hard to breath like this. Not only that, but maybe I can write something out with my hoof on he dirt floor,&quot; Jeff thought.<br />
<br />
So, he decided to finally calm down, and stand up for the first time since waking up to the continuation of this horrible night mare. But, apparently that was easier said than done. Still completely unused to such a strange body, and having no idea how to get up on all fours (all fours! Ugh!) Jeff could only just lay there, struggling and squirming about. <br />
<br />
As these thoughts and ideas were going through Jeff's mind, Marcoh had a completely different perspective. All he saw was this strange boy who wanted to become an animal either panicking, or being in complete jubilation. Marcoh couldn't tell the difference between Jeff's panicking, and his struggles to regain his feet after a few moments of rational thought.<br />
<br />
In any case, Dr. Marcoh decided (and quite correctly) that perhaps the boy (the donkey) would need a little help. After all, the kid wanted to keep his human mind. Maybe his human mind has no idea on how to control his new body. So, he grabbed a bit and bridle, a lever, a strap, and a pulley. Approaching Jeff (who was still struggling,) Marcoh asked Jeff to calm down so he can tie the strap about his middle, and using the bit, to help pull his font hooves in front so he can use the leverage to get him upright once and for all.<br />
<br />
Once the strap was secured around his middle, Marcoh brought the bridle over to Jeff, and began placing the head piece on him. As Marcoh proceeded to place the bit in jeff's equine mouth, Jeff realized what it was, and smelled the bit that was placed in the mouths of other donkeys. Of REAL donkeys, not ones transformed into one! <br />
<br />
This of course brought back memories of standing in the bathroom at the very beginning of this nightmare, and thinking of his gross disgusting dirty donkey's mouth that he is now in possession of, instead of his nice small clean mouth, with human teeth.<br />
<br />
He then proceeded to become totally grossed out. Not with just his own mouth (and his disgusting slimy animal nose he could touch his his tongue!) but even more so with the thought of having a bit that was already used by other animals, placed in his own gross mouth.<br />
<br />
So he immediately clenched his jaw shut, and steered his mouth away from Marcoh.<br />
<br />
Getting the message (that Jeff probably still had some human pride and dignity....which was the message he received, rather than the one about how nasty it would be to place a used bit from another animal in your mouth!) Marcoh decided the bit and bridle was probably not terribly necessary anyway.<br />
<br />
So he said &quot;Fine. I think we can get you up with just the strap and pulley. But you need to work with me on this!&quot;<br />
<br />
So, Marcoh began pulling on the rope, raising Jeff's middle a bit off the ground. He raised it enough for Jeff to be able to get his arms (legs!! Stiff, useless front donkey legs!!) in front, and underneath his body. All the sudden, he was able to rise, and FINALLY! got up on all fours!<br />
<br />
Which made him feel queasy. Not used to having a huge body sticking out behind him still sporting a massive erection unclothed for all the world to see, a strange wall-eyed mono-colored vision, and the thought of his nasty mouth made him feel sick. Sick, and totally and completely ashamed. So, he started gagging. His gags coming out, of course, in a strange form of a braying episode. <br />
<br />
&quot;What's the matter? Perhaps that tranquilizer dart is making you sick,&quot; said Marcoh.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I want my body back!&quot; &quot;Hee-haww, hee-haww!&quot; once again, forgetting he cannot speak.<br />
<br />
Calming himself, he decided to try to write out a message in the dirt. Squinting his eyes, and trying to figure out the best way to look directly below him, he tried to form the letter &quot;H&quot; with his right front hoof. But the damned thing was clumsy as hell, and his eyesight poor. It just looked to Marcoh like he was pawing the ground. Catching site of Jeff's massive erection from under his belly, Marcoh remembered he had to ejaculate the donkey's human seed, so he can begin replacing it with the seed of a complete jackass.<br />
<br />
Marcoh told him, &quot;hang on right here a second! I gotta go get some other equiment for ya, to take care of your....uumm....little problem. heh heh heh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Realizing his predicament with only one person in the entire world knowing who he ACTUALLY is, and who thinks he WANTED this, but unable to tell that person.....unable to even so much as write even something as simple as a capital H in the dirt, Jeff began to cry. Or would have, if donkeys COULD cry. All he could do, is just stand there and moan out &quot;haww....haww....haww...HEEE.....haaww....hawww....haww....&quot;</p>
