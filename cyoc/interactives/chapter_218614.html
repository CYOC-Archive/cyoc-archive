<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Krentol wrote this and I am editing and publishing it.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charles felt his hands grip around Shadowblur, the dagger he’d found earlier in the dungeon that had promised to be the key to defeating the boss.  While the dagger had certainly been magical, Charles wasn’t sure that he bought into the whole boss laying superpower thing.  Doubly so since it hadn’t seemed to be particularly magical the last time he’d used it.<br />
<br />
Then Charles’ fingers ran over Shadowblur’s handle, and the world around him seemed to vibrate and shimmer.  Charles pulled the dagger out of its holster and held it up in front of him, only to see the strangest sight – a thin, black string coming out of the top of his hand and extending upwards about a foot, before dissipating into nothingness.  If he didn’t know any better, he would think that it was supposed to be attached to a marionette…<br />
<br />
With the polar bear ramping up speed in his direction, Charles focused his attention on the string, feeling time slow down as he blocked out the rest of the world.  Tossing the dagger into his other hand, Charles raised it to the string and gave a quick slash, causing it to explode into a puff of black smoke as he sliced through it.<br />
<br />
Charlie looked down at his body.  Or rather, Charlie looked down at the body that he now found himself in.<br />
<br />
He was taller, stronger, and much fatter than before.  And from the feeling of his cock slapping up against his thighs, much longer too.  Charlie might still be an anthro wolf, but this wasn’t his body.  That’s when he noticed the black string rising out of his other hand and, with another slice, he felt his gut suck in, his limbs thin out, and his dick shrink back to a more reasonable size.  Charlie was Charlie once again.<br />
<br />
And just in time too – Geoffrey the feral polar bear came to a halt in front of him, reared up on his hind legs, and raised a paw up over his head, ready to strike.<br />
<br />
Charlie sprung into action, deftly dodging down and to the side as the polar bear swung, its claw swooshing just over Charlie’s head.  Then he grabbed onto the bear’s elbow, pulled himself up onto the bear’s stomach, and kicked off, propelling him straight over the bear’s head and right past the two black strings that emanated from its paws.<br />
<br />
Two slashes and, just like before, the strings exploded into clouds of black smoke, while a now anthro polar bear collapsed onto the ground, like a puppet whose strings had been cut.<br />
<br />
Next came Palseks, who was slowly trodding towards Charlie in a zombielike fashion.  <br />
<br />
Slash, slash.<br />
<br />
Palseks blinked and began rubbing a claw over the top of her head.<br />
<br />
“Hssss,” she softly hissed, “what happen to Palseks?”<br />
<br />
Charlie didn’t have time to answer as he leaped towards Veles, slashing his strings and causing him to fall to his butt with an indignant, “what!?”<br />
<br />
Charlie scanned the room for more threats, but the gaggle of wacked out fembois on other side of the room were clearly no threat.  Which just left Charlon.<br />
<br />
The large wolfdog had backed up to the hole leading out of the room.  It was clear that he had tried to retreat, only to realize that Charlie would be able to get him long before he was able to fit his massive body through the tiny hole.<br />
<br />
“How did you do that?” the wolfdog snarled, “you didn’t even touch them with that dagger!”<br />
<br />
Charlie looked at the  threads coming out of Charlon’s hand.<br />
<br />
“You can’t see them?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“See what?” Charlon growled as he began to circle around the outside of the room.<br />
<br />
Charlie realized that, whatever those thread were, he was the only person that could see them.  From the effect that cutting them had, it was obvious that they were how the boss of this dungeon was transforming people.  And since he had a way to cut them, he also had a way to beat both Charlon and his master.  <br />
<br />
“You said you didn’t want to do this?” Charlie said as he looked at the wolfdog, “I’ve already won.  Let me free you from that curse, just like I freed them.”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t say I wanted to be free either,” Charon retorted, “and you haven’t won.”<br />
<br />
Charlon stopped pacing sideways and focused his gaze on Charlie.<br />
<br />
“I told you Charlie, I can invade the minds of the weak, and I can sense just how weak you are.”<br />
<br />
Charlie felt the wolfdogs gaze pierce through him, but strangely, it didn’t seem like Charlon was focused on him.  Rather, it was like the wolfdog was looking through him, at someone else.<br />
<br />
“I can see your mind original Charlie.  I can see how small you.  How weak and helpless.  You said that you’d won?  I can see just how full of shit you are original Charlie, I can see that you know you’ve lost.”<br />
<br />
Charlie felt something in his asshole, almost like it had gone limp and was hanging slightly agape.  And the closer the wolfdog came, the more intense the effect seemed to be.  <br />
<br />
Charlon closed his eyes and advanced until he was just inches away from Charlie.<br />
<br />
“Yes, that’s it, go limp.  Become helpless.  Soon you’ll be mine to change as I please.  What would you like to be hmm?  A chamber pot? Or perhaps-“<br />
<br />
Charlie felt his asshole go numb, and with Charlon so close that Charlie could feel his breath, the wolf assassin decided that it was time to act.  Just like he did with the polar bear, he dodge left, ducked down, and prepared-<br />
<br />
Charlon didn’t react.  Or, rather, he did, but only to slowly turn towards Charlie, eyes still closed, all while he continued to ramble on about the various bathroom objects that he seemed to think were filling Charlie’s thoughts.<br />
<br />
With a deft grace, Charlie took the opportunity to slice through the strings coming out of Charlon’s hands, and with a puff of black smoke, where once stood a tall, muscular half wolf, half pitbull, there was now an athletic black anthro wolf, identical to Charlie in every way, who immediately collapsed to the floor, eyes half opened, gazing mindlessly at the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Charlie looked at… himself for a brief moment, and once it was obvious that his clone wasn’t getting up, he turned his attention to the rest of the room and the black strings that ran into the transformed rangers all around it.  <br />
<br />
And then there was the matter of Gregory.<br />
<br />
Currently wrapped around one of the German Shepherd’s diminutive cocks, the small weasel fur rag was already soaked with cum.  It had only taken Charlie a few minutes to defeat the wolfdog, but apparently his slaves didn’t have much staying power, and Gregory had already been passed around to a few different people.<br />
<br />
Charlie could only sigh.  Hopefully that cum wouldn’t stick around after Gregory was transformed back.</p>
