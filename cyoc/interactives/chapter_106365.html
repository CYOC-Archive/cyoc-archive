<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zebulon could tell that Justin was in no mood to sit in the dorm room all night when he could be finding out what his new life would be like in this studly body. &quot;Tell you what,&quot; Zebulon said, &quot;I&#39;ll sneak down to the laundry room and steal some clothes from the dryers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; Justin said. It certainly was better than going out in the green tights Zebulon had conjured up for him. &quot;But make it quick. I&#39;ve never felt so horny in my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zebulon made his way to the laundry room. A few other students were there, including a big jock whose clothes would be the right size for Justin. He was clumsily flirting with a pretty blonde who was trying her best to ignore him, pretending to be engrossed in a textbook which Zebulon noticed she was holding upside down. Zebulon cased the joint and was pretty sure he knew which load of clothes tumbling in a dryer belonged to the jock, based on the football jersey and white socks being tossed around. But even though the jock&#39;s attention was distracted, Zebulon knew he couldn&#39;t risk pilfering the guy&#39;s clothes with him also in the room. Zebulon took a seat and silently prayed for the big oaf to leave the room for a bit.<br />
<br />
As he waited, Zebulon thought about what he had done to his roommate. That spell book actually worked. The possibilities were endless...and dangerous. He now had the power to carry out his plan to switch places with Xavier in order to become Leland&#39;s boyfriend. But now that he&#39;d seen how handsome and strong Justin had become, it had dimmed Leland&#39;s perfection in Zebulon&#39;s mind. Zebulon&#39;s mind drifted as he contemplated what it would be like if Justin were his boyfriend. Of course, as far as Zebulon could tell, Justin had been straight before the transformation and was still straight now, so that was a problem. Zebulon wondered if there was a spell in the book that would make Justin gay, but that seemed unethical, even to someone who had just radically changed nearly everything else about his roommate without asking permission. <br />
<br />
Zebulon sighed when he realized that, even if he could make Justin gay, that didn&#39;t guarantee that Justin would find Zebulon attractive. Justin could probably have his pick of anyone on the campus now, male or female. Surely he&#39;d want to be with someone just as hot as he was now, not his shy bookworm roommate. Unless... A sly grin crossed Zebulon&#39;s lips.<br />
<br />
Justin was getting antsy for Zebulon to return with some clothes for him. After half an hour, his cock was still rock-hard and it was taking every bit of his will power not to start spanking it. He kept fantasizing about how much better his life was going to be from now on. He had never admitted to anyone that he was still a virgin, although he doubted anyone would be terribly surprised by that fact. He figured he would be irresistible now with his stunning good looks and amazing body, but he didn&#39;t have the first clue about how to proceed. The best case scenario was that someone incredibly hot would run up to him, wrap their arms around his neck and beg to fuck Justin. Anything that required more effort on Justin&#39;s part than that particular Penthouse Forum scenario seemed less certain to pay off.<br />
<br />
Zebulon flung open the door, rushed inside and kicked the door shut with his foot. His arms were filled with clothes from the jock&#39;s dryer. He dumped them in a pile on Justin&#39;s bed and said, &quot;I didn&#39;t get a chance to look through them all, but I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ll find something that fits.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin began to sort through the still-damp clothes, holding them up in front of him to gauge the size. Zebulon had done a good job, as it looked like Justin could fit in pretty much anything here. Unfortunately, whoever&#39;s clothes these were wasn&#39;t very fashionable. Justin wanted to look great tonight, but there wasn&#39;t much in the pile that was suitable for clubbing. Mostly it was casual clothes and workout wear. Justin slipped a navy polo shirt over his head and was pleased with the way it conformed to and highlighted his torso muscles. He couldn&#39;t imagine wedging his massive boner into a pair of underwear, so he decided to go commando for the night and slipped a pair of off-white cargos up his legs. His thick thighs were almost too big for the cargos to handle, but he liked the way the tight fabric showed off the size of the bulge in his crotch. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think, Z?&quot;, Justin asked, turning from the mirror toward Zebulon. He noticed Zebulon hovering over the old book and muttering something breathlessly. A concerned look grew in Justin&#39;s eyes. &quot;Hey, dude, what&#39;re you doing now?&quot; Zebulon didn&#39;t respond, so Justin rushed over to him, his big bare feet thudding across the floor.<br />
<br />
Zebulon raced through the final passage of the spell just as Justin yanked it away from him. &quot;Were you putting another curse on me?&quot;, Justin demanded to know.<br />
<br />
Zebulon looked up at Justin with a delighted smile. &quot;Nope. This one&#39;s all for me.&quot; He hurriedly stripped off his clothes and ran over to the mirror to look at himself. Justin had been totally oblivious to his own change, but Zebulon wanted to witness exactly what was happening to him. He stared at his reflection with anticipation, and Justin took a seat on his bed to watch what happened.<br />
<br />
Aside from feeling unusually warm, Zebulon didn&#39;t detect anything remarkable at first. His attention was riveted on the mirror for any hint of a change. They started subtly with a slight shift in the hue and intensity of his green eyes and a darkening of his red hair to a more auburn shade. He already felt sexier as the more major alterations kicked in. He gasped as his heart started racing, pumping blood furiously to his various muscle groups as they expanded before his eyes. His arms and legs puffed out, getting plump and solid, pushing previously unseen veins to the surface of the skin. His muscles became engorged, as if they were all cocks growing turgid simultaneously, and his actual cock seemed to be growing even more than the rest of him, thickening and bending slowly upward toward his slowly forming six-pack. Zebulon grinned wickedly as he watched the bones of his face reshaping themselves into a more perfectly symmetrical arrangement, and his scalp tickled as his tidy fade grew out into long strands which stretched nearly to his shoulders.<br />
<br />
Zebulon felt his pulse slowing and the adrenaline rush subsiding as the final alterations settled into place. He had altered the wording of the spell so he wouldn&#39;t become quite as huge as Justin, but he had still gained thirty pounds of muscle and could easily pass as a male gymnast. His pale skin had gained an even tan, and he sprouted a treasure trail and a small patch of hair at the center of his chest. When he sensed that the changes were complete, Zebulon exhaled for the first time since the process began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man!&quot; Justin gasped, exhausted. Zebulon turned around to see Justin flung back on his bed, his long flaccid cock still clutched in his hand, and a lake of jizz slicking his entire torso. <br />
<br />
Zebulon was amazed by this sight. &quot;Justin,&quot; he asked delicately, &quot;are you gay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin closed his eyes dreamily and lowered his head onto his pillow. &quot;I don&#39;t know, dude, but that was the hottest fucking thing I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;</p>
