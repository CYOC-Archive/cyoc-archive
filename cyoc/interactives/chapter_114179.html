<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think you are all amazing looking, but I don&#39;t want to get stuck as one specific creature all vacation, at least until I have had a chance to see what is available.  I&#39;d really like to have some fun with you guys, but if it means I have to become a satyr or a goat first, then...&quot;<br />
<br />
The older faun grinned and shook his head.  &quot;Don&#39;t be silly!  Of course you can join us just for pleasure!  And leave here just as human as you are now.  Don&#39;t worry.  You can be whatever you want here.  We just happen to think being a faun is best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s have fun!&quot;  The red-haired faun jumped up on Derrick, and the boy was immediately mobbed by the half-goat creatures.   Hands rubbed his crotch, his chest, his butt, his face.  They were fumbling with Derrick&#39;s jeans and shoelaces, so he did his best to strip.  It took only seconds with the extra help, and he laughed as he was drawn down into the thick grass for what turned into an amazing orgy.<br />
<br />
The next few hours were a blur of faun cocks, butts, balls, faces, and tongues.  He must have been mounted at least twice by every faun there, and was surprised both that he was not sore and bleeding and that he was able to mount every one of them as well.  Some kind of magic had enhanced his sexual ability, and as he continued, his size.  By the time they all lay spent and sweating in a pile of happy bodies, Derrick&#39;s penis had swelled from a very average 5 inches to a massive thick organ 10 inches soft and covered by a foreskin that drooped loosely over the end.  It was all human, though, including the ping-pong-ball sized testicles that hung heavily from his crotch.<br />
<br />
Derrick stared at his new endowment as he pulled the foreskin back and forth.  &quot;Can I keep this after I leave the island?&quot;  <br />
<br />
The oldest faun chuckled.  &quot;Just say you accept all our gifts and it becomes permanent.  Well, until you get changed by something else.  But as long as you do not accept any other changes as permanent, this will always be your normal self.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I definitely, completely, accept all your gifts!&quot;  Derrick grinned and kept playing with himself.<br />
<br />
The faun  grinned as well, knowing that the human had accepted more than he thought.  Derrick&#39;s skin was tanned and tough, his feet dirty and thickly calloused, his hair a tangled mat with leaves and grass in it.  He looked like a wild man, or a wild boy at least, one who had never worn clothing or bathed normally.  His teeth were scummy, and he stank of sweat and urine and sex.  This had all happened slowly while Derrick pleasured himself with the fauns - and Derrick&#39;s acceptance had made it all normal to him.<br />
<br />
Realizing it must be very late in the afternoon, Derrick reluctantly roused himself and got up to leave.  &quot;Thanks a lot.  This was great!  Can I come back?&quot;<br />
<br />
The red haired faun hugged him.  &quot;Sure!  You can just play again, or join us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see.  I gotta go find my family.&quot;  Derrick pulled free of the young faun and made his way back up the trail.  It was a lot easier this time, his feet finding better grip.  The branches and leaves brushed against his skin but did no damage.  He should be exhausted after all the wild sex, but Derrick felt full of energy, and even ready for more sex.  He reached down to masturbate himself as he walked.  There was no sign of his parents on the main trail, so he headed back to the resort.<br />
<br />
There were other guests wandering closer to the buildings, and a lot of them stared at him as he walked by, and especially when he stopped a few times to ejaculate.  Derrick just grinned and waved at them - they were obviously admiring his amazing package.  A couple of the fauns and satyrs angled over to pat his butt or stroke his testicles in passing, and one of the minotaurs rubbed its own massive equipment and nodded to him.<br />
<br />
One thing for sure - Derrick was starving!  he decided to go to the buffet and grab something to eat.  The nymph at the door stopped him, though.  &quot;Sorry, you&#39;ll have to use the employee dining hall.  The buffet has a dress code.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dress code?  What was wrong with how he was...?  Derrick had to think hard before he realized that pretty much all of the other guests were clothed - not by much in some cases, but other than a few really small children, he was the only one totally naked.  Something about that seemed wrong, but he couldn&#39;t quite figure out what it was.  The other guests were all clean, too.  Well, if they wall wanted to be stuck-up instead of letting loose and really enjoying themselves, that was their loss.  Derrick just shrugged.  &quot;Sure thing.  I&#39;d rather be with the minotaurs and centaurs anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
She directed him to a side door, which opened to a corridor.  All the people here were minotaurs, satyrs, centaurs, nymphs, dryads - the employees of the resort.  Although he got a lot of looks and smiles, and even some pats and groping, he felt really comfortable with them.  The employee dining area was big and plain, but had all sorts of good food and drink.  A group of centaurs and satyrs invited him to join them, and shared some sweet red wine.  They ate with their hands and made a mess, and Derrick fit right in.  By the time he was full, he was also a little drunk.  One of the satyrs helped him back to his room, where he passed out across the bed.</p>
