<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miguel just stood there and grinned, as the big, 6 foot, nearly 300 pound Chad approached him with a burning anger in his eyes. <br />
<br />
“Bueno, Chad” Miguel said with a smile, “You want to fight me, huh? With what strength?”<br />
<br />
Suddenly Chad felt a tingling feeling in all his muscles. His body seemed to shrink for a moment, but he wasn’t shrinking in height. Instead, he was rapidly losing all his muscle! His arms and legs became thin like toothpicks. His big chest seemed to deflate within seconds, and he ended up having a skinny, flat torso. Within seconds, his large 300-pound frame was now reduced to a 90 pound skinny guy, with no muscle at all!<br />
<br />
When Chad punched Miguel in the stomach, it seemed like nothing more but a light shove in the abdominal section. Miguel just stood there and laughed at him.<br />
<br />
“Mama Mia! Que pasa, Chad? Where did your big muscles go?” the Mexican boy teased. “Oh wait, I found them!”<br />
<br />
Chad just stood there and gasped as he looked down at his own body when he realized that he had become skinny as a board! Then he looked back at Miguel when his mouth dropped wide open.<br />
<br />
Miguel’s muscles suddenly inflated rapidly! His chest practically doubled in size, with big, round pectorals sticking out almost five inches in front of him. His flat torso suddenly sported a six pack of abdominals, and his legs started to swell until they were as thick and as hard as tree trunks. He now had massive, round calf muscles, and veins were now running over his quadriceps, and his arms. He now had big, round biceps on his arms. The Mexican kid had suddenly turned into a big, tanned bodybuilder with brown skin!<br />
<br />
“Okay, gringo! I guess you’re not that big anymore, huh?” Miguel said with a smile, as the skinny, little Chad continue to look at him in complete shock.<br />
<br />
“What did you do to me? You took away all my muscles! How did you do that? Give them back!” Chad began to shout at him.<br />
<br />
“Espera un momento, gringo! You don’t have the right to make any demands anymore! How does it feel to be bullied, for a change?” Miguel said, giving Chad a light shove against his chest. But Miguel was now much stronger than before, and Chad stumbled back and fell on the floor with his butt. He then slowly stood up again, and tears started coming out of his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Now, you’re going to answer my questions first” Miguel ordered in a serious tone of voice. Chad realized who was in charge, and he realized it was now just better to obey him rather than try to fight back.<br />
<br />
“What’s your problem with Mexicans anyway? Why are you always picking on me?” Miguel asked the smaller, skinnier teenager.<br />
<br />
For a moment Chad remained quiet. He just stared before him, not wanting to answer right away.<br />
<br />
“You’re not going to answer? If you’re going to act like a little kid, then I guess you might as well be one too!” Miguel warned him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Chad felt another tingling sensation go through his entire body, but this time he was shrinking for real! The hallway, the school, and all the students who stood there and were looking at him were apparently growing bigger and bigger as the high school senior started to regress back in age. Chad was now looking like a thirteen year-old boy who was still in middle school! He was shorter, smaller, he looked younger and he had lost all his hair on his chest, his arms, and his legs.<br />
<br />
Chad could only look down and gasp as he realized that he was growing younger and younger with each passing second!<br />
<br />
“Miguel… NO. Please make it stop! I’ll do anything…” Chad pleaded with him, clasping his hands together, like he was begging for mercy.<br />
<br />
“Very well, muchacho. I’ll make the shrinking stop. Now, start talking!” Miguel ordered, as he was now almost two feet taller than Chad.<br />
<br />
“My father got laid off from his construction job because the company that he worked for didn’t have any employees who were minorities. He would come home and complain about these Mexican guys, who were hired because they could be paid much less, and because they were minorities. Ever since that happened, I’ve had this thing against Mexicans. I’m sorry…” Chad replied, in a high, squeaky voice.<br />
<br />
“Well, I’m sorry to hear that, Chad…” Miguel replied. “But that gives you no right to harass me over it! I didn’t do anything to harm you or to hurt you! Now, I want you to get over it! I can’t change what happened to your dad, but I can help you to change and to treat everyone with equal respect. I’m willing to forgive you and to change you back to the way you were, if you stop bullying me and my friends…”<br />
<br />
Chad then looked up to him with a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Miguel started changing back to the skinny, short Mexican boy that he was before. As he lost his muscles, Chad started growing back to six feet in height, and he slowly grew his muscles back. Within about ten seconds, Miguel and Chad looked like before, as if nothing had ever happened.<br />
<br />
Then Miguel extended his hand to Chad, who was now bigger and taller than him.<br />
<br />
“Can we be friends now?” Miguel asked him.<br />
<br />
Chad extended his hand and the two shook hands.<br />
<br />
When Miguel turned around, he saw Luis and Ty, who were just standing there, in complete amazement of what they had just witnessed. <br />
<br />
“That was incredible!” Ty said to Miguel. “You two actually made up?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah” Miguel said, as he walked into the restroom, curling his fingers and motioning Ty to follow him.<br />
<br />
Inside the restroom, Miguel placed his hands on Ty’s shoulders. “Close your eyes for a second, so we can swap back our bodies…”<br />
<br />
Miguel and Ty closed their bodies, and the swap was reversed in an instant. When they opened their eyes again, thing were back to normal once again. Ty was back in his body, and so was Miguel.<br />
<br />
When they walked out of the restroom, they were joined by Luis and Chad. And the four boys enjoyed each other’s company at school and they were no longer afraid to speak to each other, for they had now become life long friends.</p>
