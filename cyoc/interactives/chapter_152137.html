<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Our episode title is also a line from &quot;Zor and Zam&quot; by The Monkees.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was supposed to be his weekend off.<br />
He had planned to spend all of it with his wife and family.<br />
Instead he stood before the assembled night watch in full uniform, addressing his fellow officers.<br />
&quot;As you all know by now, the Town Council voted last night to form a plan to reveal were existence to the world,&quot; began Moon Lake Police Chief O&#39;Hara. &quot;Now they&#39;re not scheduled to meet again until Tuesday to work on that, and whenever this plan is activated it will NOT include revealing Moon Lake being a were sanctuary, but you can imagine how upset even the <i>thought</i> of possible exposure has made some people,&quot; he said, addressing the officers before him.<br />
&quot;I have been in talks with Mayor Stovall and he has authorized, at least for tonight, overtime to help keep the streets of our fair town safe. I&#39;ve been calling in volunteers as needed, but it doesn&#39;t matter whether you&#39;re normal or were, let alone what side of the issue you might be on. Our job is to keep <b>everyone</b> and Moon Lake itself safe,&quot; he added. &quot;There&#39;s been a constant rise in reports since last night of public disturbances. Thankfully none have escalated to more than to the occasional fist fight, so far, but Moon Lake has always been a peaceful town, and I aim to keep it that way. Now let&#39;s get out on patrol and do our jobs!&quot;<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Choose,&quot; said Eric Anderson, holding out his closed hands.<br />
Julie Stovall thought it over for a moment, then picked his left.<br />
Eric opened it to reveal a black pawn.<br />
With that, he spun the chess board around so the white pieces were facing him before returning the white pawn in his right hand to its empty square on the board.<br />
The two engaged were-mers were sitting in the Stovall family living room, with Martin Stovall&#39;s chess set on the coffee table between them.<br />
Martin and his wife Melissa were snuggled together on the sofa watching the game as the other couple sat on the floor, more interested in being near each other than their personal comfort.<br />
Eric began by moving the pawn in front of his King forward two squares, which was an option available for pawns, but only upon their starting move.<br />
Julie responded in kind with the pawn in front of her King, which left the two pieces facing each other.<br />
Since she was just starting out learning the game, Julie kept a record of the moves on a notepad near her.<br />
Dividing the board into lettered columns (A-H) and numbered rows (1-8) with A-1 being the lower left hand corner square on Eric&#39;s side of the board, it was easy for Julie to keep track of what was going on.<br />
On her second move, Julie moved her Bishop to put Eric into check, threatening the early capture of his King.<br />
&quot;Hmm... I have taught you well,&quot; he observed. &quot;When done properly, that move does catch an opponent off guard, but I&#39;m afraid that you did it a little too soon this time, my Jewel,&quot; Eric added, using his pet name for her as he moved his Bishop to get out of check.<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m still learning honey,&quot; Julie replied, lamenting still not having an appropriate pet name for Eric as she moved her next piece.<br />
<i>&quot;Love at first sight&quot; and &quot;Happily forever after&quot; are proven scientific facts, at least for us were-mers,</i> thought Julie, staring at the love of her life. <i>I always knew I&#39;d find mine someday, but never as soon as I did, let alone in such a wonderful guy like Eric. We share a lot of interests as it is, and are willing to learn what the other does too, like chess. I can&#39;t wait to actually be married to him and spend the rest of my life swimming by his side.</i><br />
<br />
Eric castled earlier than she did to help protect his King sooner, not that Julie was worried, for chess was a game of both strategy and time, for her research showed that only a true Grand Master could complete a match in under 30 moves.<br />
Eric was surprised the next time Julie put him into check though.<br />
&quot;Wow. Didn&#39;t see that coming,&quot; he admitted.<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; asked Julie, raising one blonde eyebrow at him.<br />
&quot;Guess I was distracted by the beautiful opponent I&#39;m facing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Flattery will get you everywhere Mister Anderson,&quot; said Julie, responding to his chess move.<br />
&quot;Anything you say, my future Mrs. Anderson,&quot; replied Eric, as he moved his next piece.<br />
<br />
<i>They&#39;re so lucky to have found each other so soon in their lives,</i> Melissa Stovall thought, staring at her daughter and fiance. The one regret she would have until her dying day is not realizing the love Martin had for her and vice versa sooner, for it took Melissa almost an entire decade before she finally started dating him, let alone accepted Martin Stovall&#39;s marriage proposal and became his were-mermaid on their wedding night.<br />
Snuggled up against her husband, just trying to relax, Melissa whispered in Martin&#39;s ear, &quot;Do those two remind you of anybody we know?&quot;<br />
&quot;I can think of one couple,&quot; he replied coyly, before kissing her.<br />
Martin had a very long day dealing with feedback from the town council meeting last night. To just sit back and relax and do nothing, except be with those he loved, was soothing to him.<br />
<i>Eric&#39;s come a long way from the shy young kid I first met,</i> observed Martin. <i>Being a naturally born mermaid, Julie knew the moment she first saw him that Eric was THE one. But being a normal human at the time, it took him a while to realize what her heart knew was true and know it in his own as well, but Eric is not only becoming a fine young were-merman, but will make my daughter a great husband too,</i> thought Martin happily. <i>I wonder how things will be for our next child?</i> he wondered, knowing his wife was barely into the first month of what would eventually be the second child for the older Stovalls.<br />
<br />
Eric and Julie exchanged Knights, then Julie sat and studied the board for a bit.<br />
Eric took the time to study her, lost in thoughts of his fiance.<br />
<i>I am one LUCKY guy!</i> he thought. <i>Considering how my life was when we first moved to Moon Lake, I have no idea what I did to deserve Julie, let alone her love, but I hope I&#39;m always worthy of both.</i><br />
Then Eric was abruptly brought back to reality when Julie said, &quot;Check!&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; he replied, looking at the board.<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; said Eric, realizing the situation he was in. &quot;I&#39;ve got to save my King, but I&#39;ll lose my Queen in the process.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is that a bad thing honey?&quot; asked Julie, worried that she might have done something wrong.<br />
&quot;No dearest,&quot; he said, reaching out to take her webbed hand in his, for the two liked staying in their Stage 1 forms (displaying the webbing between their fingers and toes) as a sign of the love between them whenever they were in private. &quot;You did the right thing, and something I wasn&#39;t expecting either. Good job.&quot;<br />
Martin and Melissa were happy with Eric&#39;s reaction and response.<br />
Julie just smiled at her boyfriend/future husband as the game continued.<br />
_______________________________________________________________________________<br />
AUTHOR&#39;S AFTERWORD<br />
The game Julie and Eric were playing to this point is listed below for chess fans. When originally played in the &quot;real&quot; world I was Black, but when I made Move #17 White wanted a &quot;do over&quot;, which resulted in getting my Knight back but not capturing the Queen. If you decide to (re)play their game, I hope you have better luck than I did. Being on friendly terms with my opponent I did eventually win that game, but it took me almost an additional 80 moves to do so!—tmw.<br />
