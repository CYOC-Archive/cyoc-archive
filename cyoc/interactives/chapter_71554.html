<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sound of the doorbell knocked Jen out of her thoughts. He looked up and then bit his lip as he looked about. He couldn't answer it like this! Or well....he'd have to show his face at some point. The door bell run again and he called out in the light, feminine tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;One sec!&quot; Least his voice wasn't so different. Just a bit deeper. He moved to quickly look in his dresser for some clothes. And...it looked like those had changed along with his body. He blinked and stared at the tight-fitting tanks, skirts, and booty pants that seemed to have appeared in his collection. Now, Jen did have some of these types of clothes before but...not all like this!<br />
<br />
He sighed and grabbed a baby blue halter and slipped it over his head. Even this small, the piece of clothing clung to him and left his mid-section bare. A pair of panties went up and a short skirt that fell down to the mid of his slender thighs went on last.<br />
<br />
The doorbell rung again and he groaned before moving to slip down and over to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, who is it?&quot; He asked, biting his lip and trying to buy himself some time.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Carly!&quot; A voice answered back. It sounded...like...her but something was different. It was a bit deeper. <br />
<br />
&quot;Carly?&quot; He asked as he cant his head at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, don't be alarmed when you see this Jen but...something happened! That prick Kyle and his friends got me with that stupid curse!&quot; She huffed on the other side. Jen blinked and then pushed himself up a bit closer to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; He asked with a bit of confusion. &quot;I thought it passed on when you used it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I hesitated and got both.&quot; Carly confessed with a low groan. &quot;He transformed me into...this and then dared me to ask it to him back. He made sure to add in 'Dare me to make a sandwich.' So...yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now come on! Let me in! This is...awkward!&quot; Carly yelled before an odd clopping sound was heard. Jen drew in a breath and went to open the door.<br />
<br />
There standing before her was certainly a sight. And Jen thought she had it bad.<br />
<br />
Carly stood in the doorway, tall and rather impossing. She was big, probably about six feet in height and muscles bulged underneath a coat of brown fur. As Jen had gotten a cat, it looked like Carly got horse. The anthro horse girl placed a large hand on a full wide hip and just...stared back.<br />
<br />
God, Carly was big! Jen couldn't take his eyes off her equine friend. Horse-like face, tail, even hooves clopped in the doorway. It seemed Carly tried to get some modesty before she went out and a large sweeter that was usually baggy on her frame was stretched over a massive set of breasts and a broad chest. Her boobs had to be...E-range maybe? More? And the sweater was already giving way, tears along the front revealing the lucious valley between her two large tits. <br />
<br />
His gaze lingered there, just staring in shook and...something else?<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen? Jen!&quot; THe horse-girl snapped her fingers and the catboi blinked and shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? What?&quot; He asked as a hand rose to rub his forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle got you too huh? Ugh, that little bastard!&quot; She crossed her arms over that chest, unwittingly causing them to squish up and lift up higher, stretching out a few tears in that sweater. Jen's gaze went right back to her chest then.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh..huh...yeah...&quot; He whispered as that blank expression returned to his face. Oh they were big...and plump...and looked nice...<br />
<br />
&quot;JEN!&quot; Another yell brought him back and he blushed brightly up at his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Carly! It's this body...I'm like some crazy boy with crazy hormones...&quot; Thanks to fucking Kyle. He thought. A bit of a half-chuckle, half-snort came from the horse-girl and she motoined downward with her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I noticed that...&quot; Jen followed her gaze and gasped as he realized he had a small tent as his cock decided to spring up against his skirt and panties. A blush and he tried to cover it with his hands before his gaze was drawn away by something.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's all right Jen. I know how it feels...and believe me you got lucky...&quot; Carly added as she spied what she was talking about.<br />
<br />
Jen didn't see it because his sex-crazed body was too focused on tits but Carly also tried to wear one of her baggiest sets of sweatpants which clung tightly to her muscled legs and...something else.<br />
<br />
Jen gulped as she the giant bulge that ran down along one muscular thigh, sweats practically plastered against it as it fell down to about knee level where a thick head could clearly be seen outlined through the clothing. The two round orbs stuffed in those sweats were not hidden very well either. <br />
<br />
&quot;you...you...got a...&quot; Jen stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I got a...cock...&quot; Carly finished before she leaned forward. &quot;Can I, uh, come inside now?&quot; She added as the catboi just stared and then began to shake.<br />
<br />
That wasn't sexy. Not sexy at all. The catboi thought. Not a big, muscular, sexy herm girl with huge tits and a giant cock. He bit his lip, trying to fight back that building pressure. He stepped back a moment and seemed to get it under control before he motioned for her to come inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, just...c-come...come in...&quot; He gasped as he worked to hold back the other half of his curse. The large equine herm strode in and closed the door behind her, hooves thudding against the floor before she turned to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks but...are you ok Jen?&quot; Carly asked before her nose flaired. &quot;Oh, hey, I think I recognize that smell!&quot; And it was her time to stir.<br />
<br />
The monster between her legs began to awaken and surged up as the horse girl looked over her tits at that bulge. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, no! Come on! Not again!&quot; Carly cried out as her shaft surged out in size, growing hard and long as it stretched out her sweats. Jen wasn't very gifted...but Carly got the opposite. Her massive, ebon black member began to stretch and tear those pants before a hard surge of blood sent it rocketing up, freeing itself and the large and heavy set of balls that fell out between her thighs. &quot;Son of a bitch...&quot; Carly muttered.<br />
<br />
Jean was lost as he watched that member grow. It had to be at least a foot and a half long and those balls were set to match it! That pressure returned at the base of his throbbing cock and the catboi quickly lowered his hands down. He didn't want to mess up this set of panties and skirt and, with one hand, whipped up the skirt while the other yanked down his panties, revealing his hardened five inch length of pure need.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gunna...gunnagunnagunnagunna...gah!&quot; He stuck out his rear and his head jerked back as that cock spasmed, a surprisingly large blast of seed erupting from his small balls, up through that shaft, and outward to the floor. He jerked and spasmed till it slowed and he wobbled before his legs gave out and he fell to the floor.<br />
<br />
Carly just stared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...did you just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Jen narrowed her gaze, face red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Part of the curse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, great...&quot; She huffed and crossed her arms over her chest, blushing a bit as she bumped her solid hard member and caused a spurt of pre to jump from it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what do we do?&quot; Carly asked.</p>
