<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eva didn't bother to correct the male voice.  It sounded like her grandfather (although he'd <br />
been dead for four years now).  She stood up, the floor cold under her feet, her sheer <br />
white stockings no protection at all.  She felt a bit dizzy as she stood up...everything <br />
seemed larger to her, and the cot was too high off the floor.<br />
<br />
As she reached the door, she could tell it was taller than it should be.  She felt like Alice, <br />
shrunken to the size of a doll.<br />
<br />
She paused, feeling a wave of vertigo.  &quot;What...did you drug me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Even her voice sounded wrong.  Higher in pitch....younger...no, that's impossible!<br />
<br />
The door opened wide, and there stood a tall man in a bathrobe.  He had a long beard, <br />
and his hair was iron-grey.  He had bushy black eyebrows, and blue eyes that even older <br />
than the rest of him.  <br />
<br />
He was also a giant, unless...<br />
<br />
She looked at her hands, and was struck by how small and delicate they seemed.  And her <br />
chest...she pressed her hands against it.<br />
<br />
She'd never had a large chest, but....she was now as flat as a boy!<br />
<br />
She felt her knees go weak as she started to collapse, but the old man caught her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy does it, Michelle.  I know, it's a shock, but this is real, it's not a dream.  You can trust <br />
me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as he said it, she felt that it was so, and she clung to him.  &quot;What..what's happened to <br />
me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Picking her up, he carried her into the next room, and set her down on the couch.  Her feet <br />
dangled far off the ground, and she shivered.  Without a word, he put a comforter over her <br />
body, and handed her a mug of warm tea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drink it, it will calm your nerves.  A light sedative, nothing serious...you won't feel sleepy, <br />
just relaxed.&quot;<br />
<br />
She held the mug in her small hands carefully, and took a drink.  It was good, and flavored <br />
with honey.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name..and please don't laugh...is Merlin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite her situation, Eva couldn't help but smile.  &quot;Do you know how many wizards I've <br />
met who call themselves that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Harumph!  I'll have you know that I'm the real deal, Miss Valentine.  I don't really need to <br />
prove it, one look in the mirror should do that.&quot;  He uttered an incantation.  She'd become <br />
familiar with the various dead languages used to cast spells...and her eyes widened.  She'd <br />
only heard words like this once before.<br />
<br />
Just then, the air before her shimmered and became glassy...until it was just like a mirror, <br />
in front of her.  At the sight of herself, she almost dropped the mug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God...no...how?&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl-child in the mirror looked like a doll, her features delicate and elfin.  Her pale <br />
blonde hair was very long, and done up in a French braid.  The black dress completed the <br />
look perfectly...she still remembered joking with Scylla about how it made her look Lolita-<br />
ish.  The girl's eyes were a very dark blue, and she looked very mature for her age.<br />
<br />
It was both like and unlike her normal self in the mirror.  She vaguely remembered herself <br />
as a child, and knew she'd been different than this.  If it wasn't for her complete lack of a <br />
figure, she'd have thought she'd merely shrunk, instead of gotten younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;God had little to do with it, well, at least, the God you're probably thinking of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did..Alecto do this somehow?  She'd called me a little girl...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Wizard cocked his head to one side.  &quot;Alecto?  Hm...well that, I'm not sure of.&quot;<br />
<br />
He paused.  &quot;Allow me to explain.  I'm a lot older than I look.  I run a shop, which you're in, <br />
I might add, where I sell magical objects of all kinds.  Chaos magic, mostly.  They <br />
transform the lives of whoever they come in contact with..not usually in a malicious way.  I <br />
sell them to people who need a touch of magic in their lives...or just need to learn a <br />
lesson or three.  If things get out of hand, I step in and fix the problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighed.  &quot;Well usually I do.  I sold a ring to a boy.  Somehow after he left, it was stolen, <br />
and swapped for another magic ring.  When he saw you in the park, he used the ring's <br />
magic on you.  He shouldn't have, and believe me, he understands now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...wait...you sold someone a magic ring that....did THIS to me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eva felt her emotions flying out of control.  The pain she'd gone through, losing Scylla to <br />
that BITCH...and now...she couldn't take it.  She managed to leap to her feet and she <br />
hurled the mug of tea at the old man.<br />
<br />
Thunk.  It struck him in the chest, soaking his robe with tea.  Standing up to his full height <br />
(and he was a lot taller than you'd think!), Merlin looked about ready to turn Eva into a <br />
frog...or worse.<br />
<br />
Her rage vanished at once and she crumpled to the floor, sobbing.  &quot;I'm sorry...I'm so <br />
sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
Just like that, she felt gentle arms pick her up and set her back on the couch.  She noticed <br />
his robe was clean again, and dry (well, clean-er, at least).<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I should be apologizing.  I had that coming, I suppose.  Normally, I don't let people <br />
strike me, you have good reflexes.  Ever consider training to be an Assassin?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eva blinked.  &quot;Wha..?&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man laughed.  &quot;Just kidding.  I can tell you're a gentle girl, even if you have the <br />
talent for Mage-Slaying.  Tell me, what magic do you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...nothing really.  I mean, I've read books, and I helped the Coven and Scy...&quot;<br />
<br />
At the thought of her former lover, the tears came back.  She wasn't normally this weepy, <br />
but it was like her body was too small to contain her emotions.<br />
<br />
He patted her on the shoulder.  &quot;There, there.  Let it all out.  You're very right, you know.  <br />
You have a grown woman's feelings, and your body is currently too young to deal with <br />
them.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked up at him, shocked, though the tears still flowed.  &quot;You read my mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, only the surface thoughts.  Any more than that would be rude.  Has anyone told you <br />
that you're a natural sorceress?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...a few of the girls in the Coven said so, but...I don't really believe in....oh what am I <br />
saying?  Look at me!  This has to be magic!&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded sagely.  &quot;It is, in fact.  Very dark magic.  You've been affected by a cursed ring.  <br />
While I'm not to blame..fully...the fact is, you would have been transformed by Bobby <br />
either way.  It's just I would have been able to do more for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transformed...into what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I sold him the Ring of Age.  He mistook you for a much younger girl, and was going to <br />
add a few years to you, to see if you got any sexier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well he's only 15, what do you expect?  I doubt it would have made much of a difference, <br />
he'd have likely only made you 24 or so...you'd have larger breasts and a fuller figure, but <br />
that's about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?  I didn't think I had much to look forward to.  Well that's nice to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not...really.  See...um...the ring he used...like I said, it's cursed....so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't reverse it.  So you mean, I have to grow up all over again?&quot;  Eva felt very cold, <br />
and her hands shook.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, worse than that.  This is as grown-up as you'll ever be.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Eva fainted.</p>
