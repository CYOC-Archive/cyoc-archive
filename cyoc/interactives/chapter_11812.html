<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a sunny day at the park and the four newly minted canines had a rollicking good time of it.  They stayed together the mile or so to the park, except for speed demon Tony who couldn't get enough of his greyhound ability to sprint at amazing speeds.  He negotiated the trip in a series of fantastic runs back and forth past his dog brethren who sort of smiled at his giddy enthusiasm.

Once at the park, though it was every dog for himself, but Jeff kept a watchful eye on the others in between the occasional squirrel chase or frisbee or play fighting with one of the others.  Border collie Jack was playing fetch with a man and his two sons.  It amazed him that such a simple game was satisfying to him, but no matter how many times he'd already retrieved the stick he felt a burning desire to serve his master and get it when it was tossed again, even when it went into the small lake that the park surrounded.

Imposing mastiff Eric didn't play much but stood watch at a corner of the park, almost never sitting but trotting back and forth or standing in place.  An old woman with a white lap dog sat on a bench there.  A couple large mutts eyed the lap dog with nothing but mayhem from across the street.  When the old woman put it down and it wandered away, they started to cross the road toward it.  Eric let out a thunderous WOOOOOOOF! and looked right at them with equal mayhem in his eyes.  Their tails dropped and they returned to the other side of street but didn't go away for quite a while.  The lap dog dropped scat and scurried back to the old woman, glancing fearfully over her shoulder at 200 pound Eric.  Eventually, Eric ended up serving as surrogate pony for a pair of twin 4 year old boys hoisted atop him by their father.

Enjoying the day most of all, was Tony.  He raced and beat every dog at the park, including Jeff and Jack.  He put the humans to shame.  Even a boy taking a shortcut across a hundred yards of grass on his bike was shamed by Tony.  He caught up to the boy, barked at him  once alongside and then left him in the dust.  He played fetch/frisbee with a 10 year old boy whom he recognized as one of his little brother's friends.  The boy would throw the frisbee high and far as he could and greyhound Tony would leave the boy's side, run under it and catch it in acrobatic fashion before trotting back to shouts and claps from people watching.  He swelled with pride at the exclamations of both children and adults at his speed.  "Wow!  Would you look at him go!"  "Daddy!  Daddy!  Look at the speedy dog!" 

When not sprinting at eye-popping speeds, Tony would casually trot up to children and allow them to pet him and feed him.  All of them wanted to touch him and rub his fine tan fur and he felt warm establishing even such temporary bonds.  As for the food, he got a hotdog, half a ham sandwich, a tiny handful of potato salad and a pickle from kids who were delighted by him.  He made sure to bite no fingers.  But the cherry on top was the pair of beautiful girls who waved the amazing greyhound over to their blanket.  They let him rub against their bikini clad bodies and rubbed him all over, from his long, pointed muzzle to the tip of his tail, skipping only the delicate parts underneath and behind.  Greyhound Tony moaned with pleasure.  It was almost a full dog massage and gradually Tony eased into a nap lying stretched out, snuggled between two sun bathing beauties.  An hour later, he woke.  The girls didn't know what to make of the startled yip he let out at finding he was a dog and remembering his metamorphosis but gave him another fine rubdown.  Tony was considered one of the most intellectual boys in the whole school and the pleasure he got from this sensual dog life took him by surprise.

"Damn" thought Jeff watching him from atop a small hill.  Somebody might not want to go back to being a guy after Monday.  He proceeded on to scanning for Jack and Eric.

But he wasn't the only one searching for Jack and Eric.  Late that afternnon, back at Jeff's house, three girls approached the front door and rang the doorbell.  Suzy Phillips was dating Eric.  Eric didn't think so and had gone out with another girl the night before, not out of malice but callousness.  Heather Watson was dating Jack and was exasperated at his indifference to her extreme romantic conception of their relationship.  Both had been roiled up all last night by Emma Chase.  Emma did causes.  Whales.  Rain forests.  Racism.  Causes.  She was one of the top students in the class and wrote for the school paper.  Next year, she'd edit it.  Feminism was her cause now and those boys were stupid brutes.  They weren't worthy of Suzy or Heather who had gone over to give them a piece of their minds, and perhaps a good bit of Emma's.  

Jack, Eric and Tony had all called and told their families they'd be at Jeff's house before receiving the chronivac treatment.  The girls learned where to find them from their mothers.  After two rings, the door was opened.  By Jeff's sister.  She smirked.
"I hope you're not looking for Jeff"
"No, we're not, but is he with Eric Kuhnen and Jack Powers?" demanded Emma.
"Maybe" the girl giggled.  
"Is he or isn't he?  Or don't you know?"
The 10 year old girl couldn't suppress her extreme delight in having a secret so incredibly juicy but didn't know how to start.
"You wouldn't believe me if I told you" she finally responded.
"What the heck are you talking about?"
"Well . . " Jeff's little sister scanned the neighborhood from side to side then waved the three girls in to follow her into the living room.  She giggled and motioned for them to sit on the couch.  From underneath a chair, she produced a digital camera and laid it before them.
"They're not here right now and after you see this, you'll know why I can't say just where they are"
She pressed play and two minutes of soundless footage followed.  A skinny naked guy could be seen in profile from outside the room in which he stood.  The focus left something to be desired but the boy looked toward the camera for a moment.  They replayed that moment.
"Tony St. Martin!" gasped Emma before Suzy and Heather exploded in laughter.  
"Tony St. Greyhound" giggled Jeff's sister and she hit play.  As the girls watched in amazement, Tony covered with fur, grew a long tail and had his face push out into a long pointed muzzle.  There was a jump in the filming.
"Someone looked out into the hallway" explained Jeff's sister.  I had to stop filming.  I was hidden in the closet at the top of the stairs.  Jeff thinks I'm at Brenda's house which I was until I came back to get my bathing suit and found my brother turning himself into a dog!" she finished in a triumphant giggle.
"What!?"  The room exploded in more laughter and they watched the rest of the footage which showed Tony completing his metamorphosis and becoming completely a greyhound and snippets of Eric becoming a mastiff and Jack a border collie.  All four girls laughed and laughed at the ridiculousness of it.  Emma stopped laughing before the others.  She demanded that Jeff's sister explain how they did it.  But Jeff's sister didn't know.  She said she'd caught a glimpse of Jeff's laptop computer and a few other things but nothing more.  Emma made her take them up to the room where it'd happened.  She quizzed the little girl to make sure that no device had gone with the dogs out of the house.  They scoured the room for 20 minutes before Emma found the laptop computer atop the bookcase.  A touch of the mousepad brought the computer out of sleep mode and lit up a screen split into four squares.  Emma laughed and laughed reading the status of the four boys.  Suzy and Heather talked of turning them to bugs and squashing them.  They speculated on what they should do and made all sorts of wild suggestions, but calculating Emma realized that with Jeff's sister there they couldn't just propose to off them.  She read the instruction manual while Suzy and Heather blew off steam she'd helped them build up.  She mulled it over very carefully while figuring out the laptop on the desk in front of her.  Simple humiliation was good enough for Jack and Eric.  But Tony St. Martin!  Tony St. Martin!  He was a particular bete noir of hers.  He argued with her in classes.  He challenged her information.  He gave comfort to the idiot brute boys who didn't want to change their ways of thinking.  He was also second in the whole class, just a tiny fraction of a point behind Louis Anctil and a similar sliver ahead of her.  No, Tony St. Martin deserved special humiliation that a smart boy like him would appreciate and he would get it.</p>
