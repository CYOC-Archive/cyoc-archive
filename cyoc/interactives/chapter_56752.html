<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Somewhere between Big Bad Island and New Zealand the yacht had ran out of fuel. <br />
The captain was furious with himself for having miscalculated how much fuel was left. <br />
Now they were adrift and there had been no response to the distress calls he had <br />
been sending out. They had enough food and water for a few days and that could be <br />
stretched out if need be. The captain just hoped that someone would either receive his <br />
distress call or happen one them and hopefully that someone wouldn't be pirates. At <br />
least they had solar panels and the batteries were fully charged so they would have <br />
electricity for awhile. It would probably be best to limit the electrical use to necessary <br />
items.<br />
<br />
Rick looked in the mirror and sighed. He wanted to be a little girl so bad he could taste <br />
it. He knew that he should forget about it and concentrate on his marriage to Maylene <br />
but the more he tried to forget about it the more he thought about it. Sighing again he <br />
left the bathroom and sat back down next to Maylene. She had wanted to talk to him <br />
alone so she had sent Dennis to play with the other kids. &quot;What did you want to talk <br />
about?&quot; he asked trying to be a good fianc&eacute;e.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don't know how to say this to you,&quot; Maylene said looking down and looking a <br />
little bit guilty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just tell me,&quot; Rick said taking Maylene's hand.<br />
<br />
Maylene took a deep breath and said, &quot;I'm pregnant and I don't know who the father is <br />
but I know it's not you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick nodded and said, &quot;Well since we haven't had sex it would be a safe bet to say <br />
that I'm not the father. Have you told Dennis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; Maylene said. She then broke down and sobbing said, &quot;I wouldn't blame you <br />
if you broke up with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick put his arm around Maylene and said, &quot;I wouldn't break up with you over this. <br />
After all you got pregnant on the island under the influence of Kurse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we can't get married,&quot; Maylene said and then sobbed uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you say that?&quot; Rick asked thinking that she may be right about not getting <br />
married.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Maylene said still sobbing. &quot;I just have this feeling that we won't be <br />
married.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You may be right about that but it's not for the reason you think,&quot; Rick said deciding <br />
that it was time to tell her what he had been feeling since the island.<br />
<br />
&quot;What other reason could there be?&quot; Maylene asked shocked so much that her <br />
sobbing quieted down.<br />
<br />
Rick took a deep breath and said, &quot;Well since the island I've had this desire to be a <br />
little girl. It was barely there at first but it's been growing and now it's almost all I think <br />
about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you feel like that?&quot; Maylene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it has something to do with what the witches did,&quot; Rick said. &quot;I saw some of <br />
their memories while we were under Kurse's power. The witches wanted a world of <br />
children and the figured girls were more innocent than boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you think Kurse wanted you to be a little girl?&quot; Maylene asked with a surprised <br />
look on her face. &quot;That doesn't make sense though. If she wanted you to be a little girl <br />
she would have made you one of the chimeras. And why make the bears <br />
hermaphrodites.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kurse wasn't controlling the transformations,&quot; Rick said looking down. &quot;She just let the <br />
Infinite Chaos have some free reign. As to why the bears were hermaphrodites I think <br />
one of us is a hermaphrodite and they were used as a kind of template.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But shouldn't that desire have been removed when Kurse died?&quot; Maylene asked <br />
getting a far away look. &quot;We did become ourselves again after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Physically we did since our transformations where fueled mostly by the Infinite Chaos,&quot; <br />
Rick said. &quot;The desires we have however are deeply rooted in our souls now. Some of <br />
those desires won't make their presence known or will only make themselves known <br />
once in awhile and weakly. Other desires, such as mine, will grow stronger with time. <br />
These are the most dangerous ones since those desires could drive one to insanity.&quot; <br />
He looked at Maylene with a crooked smile and said, &quot;The witches had the desire to <br />
free the world from rules so no one would be hurt again. That's what drove them <br />
insane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're going to go insane?&quot; Maylene asked with a look of horror on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a possibility if my desire isn't realized,&quot; Rick said nodding. &quot;That's why we <br />
probably won't be married now. It wouldn't be a happy marriage if we do get married <br />
before I go insane. Of course to realize my desire I would have to become a little girl <br />
and we wouldn't be able to get married.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to ask Marie to transform you into a little girl?&quot; Maylene asked drawing <br />
Rick close and stroking his hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I will,&quot; Rick said laying his head against Maylene's chest. &quot;I'm sorry about this I <br />
really am. I wanted to marry you but with this desire growing within me I'm afraid it <br />
wouldn't be fair to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll need a mother when you're a girl so I'll be your mother,&quot; Maylene said with a <br />
smile. &quot;I think that I can overcome the awkwardness that would entail.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like that,&quot; Rick said starting to fall asleep. &quot;Maybe our home will be on the island or <br />
in Glendale. I'd like to be friends with the pups and cubs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Maylene said quietly watching Rick go to sleep. She wanted him to be happy <br />
and she knew he wanted her to be happy. He was right about one thing, if they were <br />
married they wouldn't be happy. She continued to stroke his hair already starting to <br />
think of him as her daughter. She loved him and wanted to be a part of his life. If that <br />
was as a mother-daughter relationship then so be it. She heard the announcement <br />
that they were adrift and they would need to conserve all they could. Fortunately the <br />
announcement didn't wake Rick from his slumber which was good because she didn't <br />
think he was getting enough sleep.</p>
