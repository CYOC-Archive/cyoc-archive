<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as Alison entered the restaurant, she made an immediate beeline to the buffet line. Five months pregnant, the anthro cougar fury’s sense of smell was almost razor keen; able to tell the difference between rare and medium rare steak by smell alone. She grabbed a plate and started to grab up some tiny puff pastries before heading to a potato salad and spooning a large glob on her plate.<br />
“You don’t wait around,” Brittany chuckling as she caught up to Allison; the two meeting up outside as Denise and Alison came together.<br />
“Eating for two,” Alison responds as she looks at these curiously shaped fried wontons; taking a few she finishes off her plate with a bread roll before heading to a table.<br />
“From the amount on your plate,” Brittany chuckles as she joins her friend; “more like eating for three.”<br />
“My last sonogram proves I’m not carrying twins,” Allison sighing; ever since the fourth of July party pregnancy confirmation, both Brittany and Jake have teased Alison that she is knocked up with two. Alison knows it was playful ribbing; she knew Brittany was having a hard time with her twins when she wished it upon her. Dusk and Dawn were being difficult before school let out for summer; Brittany needed to vent because of it.<br />
<br />
“So how is Jimmy J.R handling the news that he will soon have a brother or sister,” Brittany begrudgingly accepting defeat and changing the topic.<br />
“Oddly chill to it,” Allison looking thoughtful; “but he is concerned that we might get rid of Dickens. He thinks the baby might not like the cat.”<br />
“Fifty percent chance the cub you go growing will be a kitty,” Brittany smiling ruefully; like human’s, the male’s sperm determine gender. However, when it comes to the cub taking more like the father or the mother in regards to fury form; science is still mystified over it.<br />
“If you are under the impression that deer and cat don’t get along,” Alison looking nonplussed; “then you better inform Michael and Denise and their cub Roxy.”<br />
“Not where I’m going,” Brittany shaking her lupine head; the anthro grey furred wolf fury pausing to put her fork down. “J.R could be under the impression that if his baby brother or sister is like him or you, a cougar fury; he might think that Dickens might be unwanted.”<br />
“That won’t happen,” Alison biting into the fried wonton; she perks up as the filling was genuine crab meat with lemon; “this is good. What is it?”<br />
“Jake’s Crab Rangoon,” Brittany popping the fried wonton in her muzzle; “only he use real crab meat. Not that mock crap made with Alaskan Pollock.”<br />
“Tasty,” Alison licking her lips as she popped the second one she got from the buffet into her muzzle; “we are not getting rid of Dickens. The cat is a lovable nuisance that likes to snuggle. Now where are our mates,” Alison looking about the dining area; seeing all the other cooks and waiters as well as their mates milling and talking, Alison could not see her mate Jimmy Proudhoof nor his twin brother Jake Proudoof. <br />
<br />
“Oooooooooooooh, almost there.”<br />
Denise entered the restaurant through the back door; a space reserved for deliveries and employee egress. She wasn’t exactly surprised at the sight before her. The anthro tigress fury observing her mate Michael Proudhoof officiating over a round of dueling dicks. A game where two male furies get a blow job; the first fury to cum is the loser. Denise has played this game several time with Michael and other members of the staff; however this is the first time that she has witnessed both Jimmy and Jake engaged as the two stiffen and tense as they hold back their orgasm. Both anthro stag-deer fury’s like their father; the twins were each getting sucked off. Jimmy S.R was getting orally pleased by one of the waitresses; the Anthro Cheetah Fury who was studying for a law degree. While Jake was hyperventilating as he was getting sucked on by a Burmese python fury; Denise was unfamiliar with her, but she could see that Jake was soon fit to burst.<br />
<br />
Watching the python fury envelop the large cervine phallus in her reptililan maw; Denise smirked as she could sense the python’s forked tongue deep in Jake’s urethra, giving him a taste of what it is like to be penetrated. Laughing as he was the first to gasp and grunt; the python fury gagging as she nearly choke on the large amount of seed filling her mouth.<br />
“Fuck,” Jimmy moaning as he grabs the cheetah fury’s head and forces her to deep throat him as he shudders with his own release.<br />
“Well Jake,” Michael raising Jimmy’s hoof hand; “looks like you couldn’t outlast your brother.”<br />
“No fair,” Jake panting as he watches his shaft still spurt out his seed; using a prep table to support himself as his tries to remain standing on shakey legs. “Jimmy didn’t have a forked tongue going up in his rod.”<br />
“And you think I haven’t had him before,” the Burmese fury standing up; “you’re not the only Proudhoof to walk funny after I’ve had my way. Denise listens as she gets a good look and noting how well stacked she looks. The python’s breasts are clearly a gravity defying pair of double D’s, her waist tapering before flaring out to some impressive child bearing hips; the fury keeping her legs spread apart, unconcerned if others see her scaly entrance or not. “But I will miss these fun times with you Heather,” the female python flicking her tongue out; “not many here with a tongue as rough as yours that can keep up with my forked tickler.”<br />
“Well there is always Denise here,” Heather turning to see the tigress fury who watched the show; “but you would have to convince Michael here first.”<br />
<br />
“So you had to start dueling dicks without me,” Denise shaking her feline head as she embraces her mate; “and without Alison and Brittany?”<br />
“She heard but has never participated,” Jimmy sighing as Heather finishes licking him clean; “Jake was off that night and Carlos challenged me after having one too many tequilas.”<br />
 <br />
“And what is this I hear about Heather leaving,” Denise looking at the Cheetah Fury waitress; “are you moving?”<br />
“Only to Seattle,” Heather smiling; “I passed the bar and I got a job at a law firm. Not more late night cramming as I wear down my paws running tables during the day.”<br />
“Now it’s staying up late night researching past cases and preparing briefs,” the Burmese Python fury chuckles; “as you wear down your paws running from court room to court room.”<br />
“Alright,” Michael interjecting; “Heather we will miss you. Good luck with your law career.”<br />
“In the meantime,” Jimmy helping the cheetah fury up; “have fun, stuff yourself with food tonight.”<br />
“And don’t get caught under the mistletoe,” Jake giving a sly wink; “more so if Brittany is carrying it.”<br />
“Come one,” Michael looking at his sons; “let’s get these trays out to replace the empties on the buffet.<br />
<br />
Alison and Brittany’s scanning of the room ended when they spotted both anthro stag-deer furys coming from the kitchen, holding food trays and heading to the buffet tables. Seeing Michael behind them with both Heather and her replacement; Alison knew the group had a round of dueling dicks. Getting up to head to the table as Heather and the python fury start mingling in with party.<br />
“So who won,” Alison grabbing more of the crab Rangoons; staring at the two furys as they tried to play dumb; “come on, I saw Heather and Rose follow you two out of the kitchen, so who won.”<br />
“Your mate,” Jake putting down the tray of lamb chops; turning to see a smug looking Jimmy as wipes down a tray. “It’s not over,” Jake looking at his twin brother; letting him know that there will be a rematch down the road.<br />
<br />
Alison stares at her mate as he uncomfortably looks embarrassed; like he got caught with a muzzle full of cake frosting from a midnight snack attack.<br />
“Was it Heather,” Alison giving her mate a sniggering stare; the anthro cougar more jealous that she didn’t get to watch the spectacle, then her mate getting gratification off of some other fury.<br />
“Yeah,” Jimmy unable to hold back his satisfying grin; “dad insisted I have her service me. He thought that I would be use to her feline tongue,” Jimmy chuckling as he shakes his head in embarrassment; “on an account that you…<br />
“That I give you blow jobs and hers is as rough as mine,” Alison interrupting with a laugh; “I do forget that you need relief now and then. Me being pregnant must be giving you some fury blue balls most days,” Alison bending her body towards the buffet table; letting her milk swollen breasts lean over the lamb chops Jake put down earlier. “I bet you want to suckle on these melons,” Alison picking up a few lamb chops and putting them on her plate all the while she shakes her chest, her breasts swinging and making subtle sloshing sounds. “I have plenty to give at the moment. At least until the baby comes,” Alison turning around to head back to her table; swishing her tail as she sashays away from Jimmy. Pulling her chair out after she put her plate down; Alison bent over slightly and provocatively displayed her entrance towards her mate. Turning around slightly to see him, Alison smiles as her mate starts to show his arousal as his just recently serviced cervine rod starts peeking out of its sheath; pleased that he still has cream to spear for her later on tonight.</p>
