<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul was from a fairly wealthy family that managed to give him everything he had ever dreamed about. However his most important hobby was to frequently check for any sign of change around the age of 14.<br />
His parents had the ability to change into lions at will and any sort of anthro inbetween.so genetically speaking he had a fairly large chance of inheriting the same powers.<br />
He was aware of his predisposition of gaining the same powers as his parents however he secretly wished not to inherit them. His biggest passion was horse riding unbeknownst to his parents who only saw it as a noble hobby. However in this passion his mind often wondered what if his first sign of change reveals reveals equine features. Due to the abnormalities of the change, the extend to which he could change could vary greatly. From having a tail and horse ears to spending the rest of his life on full fledged hooves.<br />
Christmas came and as always everyone made a new year&#39;s resolution and a wish. He primarely wished for more focus at school and so did his siblings, however since his change was nearing he also wished for the most noble thing he could. To turn into the animal he desired most.<br />
Days went by and his siblings one after another started gaining more and more feline features. And through training they were able to vary their level of change.<br />
Paul up until this point wasn&#39;t transformed at all, however his time came when he was working with his grandpa in the countryside.<br />
After a long day of scouring for berries in the forrest Paul came back with a sack full of them and when grandpa saw him he was shocked. Isn&#39;t this what you asked for?<br />
No, it&#39;s not that. Your ears!<br />
Your first change has begun.<br />
All though those don&#39;t look like lion ears, they are far to pointy.<br />
Paul&#39;s heart sank,could his wish have really affected his blood line&#39;s animal.<br />
Later that day he received his tail. It was farely long and consisted of matching black hair. It was also shaggy which prompted his grandpa who worked as a medic for teenagers who were going through their first change to say.<br />
Paul I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be continuing your family&#39;s heritage and turn into a lion. You&#39;re more akeen to an ungulate of some sort. If I had to guess, probably a horse. There isn&#39;t a single person In your family that turned in to a horse so your equine genetic flare shouldn&#39;t advance that much.<br />
Two days passed since that encounter and his transformation made his grandpa eat his words.<br />
In those 2 days his legs started bulking up with muscles and the soul of his feet started elongating quite a considerable amount. His knuckles formed his hookes and eventually keratin engulfed his previous fingers creating 2 broad hooves.<br />
Paul at this point was extatic due to his changes into such a noble animal by his standard,however he was also scared due to his changes not slowing down, he knew that they were erratic and that he had a small chance of turning into a full blown animal, however such cases were extremely rare. Even a first change going as far as his had gone was very rare from what his grandpa had told him during his change.<br />
His change wasn&#39;t slowing down as if trying to defy the normality of first changes and in the following days his torso became a bit more rounder and his shoulders moved under him to support his weight. His hands became much thicker due to the muscles building up and the new more sturdy tendons replacing those in his previous arms. The addition of thicker muscles and tendons in his arms showed his grandpa that the change was intending to repurpose his arms as another pair of legs. And his fears came true the next day as his hands continued to lengthen, most noticeably his palms as they lengthened into his front cannons. His nuckles turned into his front hookes and his fingers fused together as his grandpa was watching and turned into 2 broad Grey hooves. A matching set to his back ones.<br />
His neck did lengthen a bit and formed a black mane and his face was a bit pushed out. However his change stopped beyond that point leaving Paul in a state of disbelief as he now was in control and could feel every inch of his hide.<br />
He stood up on his 4 legs and felt the pressure his body exercited on his hooves.<br />
His once hands now were 2 thick pillars of  muscles that ended in 2 keratin hooves.<br />
He tried to flex one of them however he could only manage to fold his fore leg under him with no lateral motion, as foe his hooves they only had a small range of motion backward.<br />
He couldn&#39;t believe that he was now a horse from his head down.<br />
Come on boy, you&#39;re certainly a first in this family.<br />
I don&#39;t know what aspect of your life influenced your change in such a way however take it as you may, not many people get to turn into stallions.<br />
If I tell you, will you keep it to your self?<br />
Sure!<br />
I wished to not follow in my family&#39;s footsteps and be a lion, I wished to be a horse and what just happened if fairly close to what I wanted. If I can vary my level ofchange like them then that&#39;s even better.<br />
You did wish not to follow in your family&#39;s footsteps. Who knows if you can even vary your change you might be stuck like this down on all four. I&#39;ve never seen someone change so much on their first change it might even be permanent.<br />
So be it, if horses can do it then so can I, at the end of the day now I resemble them more then I resemble you guys. he said while stomping one hoof on the ground.<br />
Your family will be here shortly to see you, I&#39;ve only told them that you are not a lion, how you deal with this encounter is up to you.</p>
