<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as Mandy is about to head downstairs to meet up with Mason, she stops, a evil grin appearing on her face as an idea pops into her mind. The five year-old turns around and walks back into Jeff’s room, where the “baby-girl” is sleeping soundly in her crib.<br />
<br />
Mandy opens the “game” and selects her “sister”, she reads through her stats until she finds what she is looking for: Jeff’s memories! The little girl’s evil grin widens when she selects “copy memories” then selects herself and hits the confirmation button, Mandy giggles when she feels her mind tingle as the new memories fill her brain. After every single one of Jeff’s memories are copied over to her, Mandy then deletes one memory, but keeps the others intact, making sure Jeff remembers who he really is. But in order to pull off her sick idea, she needed to delete that one memory, a memory that only Mason and Jeff know, which is an embarrassing secret Mason had told Jeff and made Jeff promise to never tell anyone about it. That secret is of Mason’s desire to be an animal, a Dragon to be more precise, which might not sound to bad, but Mason feels embarrassed about it and fears that, if anyone would find out, he’d be bullied and stamped off as a “fag”, since majority of people think it is gay for humans to fantasize about being an animal.<br />
<br />
After deleting that memory, Mandy then scrolls up to Jeff’s age, which is still set to a two-year-old, and changes it to five months. Mandy watches, grinning to herself, as her former big brother slowly regresses down to a little five month old baby, which causes him to lose the ability to talk.<br />
<br />
With that taken care of, Mandy heads out the room and down the stairs, she finds Mason, who still is his four year-old self, sitting on the couch, “hey, Mason,” Mandy says, smiling.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Mandy,” Mason says, “so… what do you wanna play?”<br />
<br />
‘Time to put my plan into action,’ Mandy thinks to herself, before replying, “I’m not Mandy, it’s me: Jeff!”<br />
<br />
Mason’s eyes widen, “Jeff,” he asks, sounding surprised and confused, “bu-but I thought the game had deleted itself! H-how is it possible th-that you are back… well… not as your real self... y-you know what I mean!”<br />
<br />
Mandy giggles, “I’ll explain,” she says, sitting down next to Mason, holding up her iPad, “my sister has the “game” on her iPad. SHE used it to transform me into a two-year-old!”<br />
<br />
“Why would she do that,” Mason asks.<br />
<br />
“Because she has a crush on you,” Mandy says, “she wanted to make you her boyfriend, she was jealous that you always hang out with me instead with her, so she decided to turn me into a baby, so that you lose interest in me! I was simply in the way of her “boyfriend”!”<br />
<br />
Mason’s eyes widen in horror, “she WHAT,” he shouts.<br />
<br />
“Shhh,” Mandy shushes him, “not so loud, you’ll wake her up!”<br />
<br />
“S-sorry,” Mason says, “but seriously! What is wrong with that girl?”<br />
<br />
“You ask me,” Mandy says, sticking to her act, “she has always been a creep.”<br />
<br />
“S-so, what happened,” Mason asked, “h-how did you manage to become older?”<br />
<br />
“She is not only a creep,” Mandy says, “she is also dumb as hell. After I told her who I really was, that I am not really a girl, that I am her big brother Jeff, and after she told me about her feelings for you, she wanted to regress me into a 5 month old baby, so that I wouldn’t have a way to warn you. Instead she somehow managed to switch bodies with me by mistake, once I realized what has happened, I acted quickly and transformed her, in my old body, into 5 month old baby and made her fall asleep!”<br />
<br />
“Damn,” Mason says, “that really was close!”<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to tell me, dude,” Mandy says, “I might not be in my original body, but this is better than being a 5 month old baby. Besides, since we have the game back and under our control, I can become my true self any time.”<br />
<br />
“Then let’s transform back to normal, I really don’t want to be a four year-old anymore,” Mason says.<br />
<br />
Mandy nods, “yeah, I don’t want to be this young anymore myself,” she says, she then starts to type and soon Mason is his 15 year-old self again. Mandy, who is now a 16 year-old, is amazed at how sexy she looks as a teenager: long black smooth hair, that reach just below her shoulder blades, wide hips, a nice big, firm and round butt, giving her a amazing hourglass figure and a nice set of big C-cup breasts. The former 5 year-old feels herself become excited, being a 16 year-old teenager feels really amazing, but she manages to simply smile, “it feels so great to be a teenager again,” she says happily.<br />
<br />
Mason nods, “yeah,” he then tilts his head, “but why are you still a girl? I thought you hated it.”<br />
<br />
Keeping her act up, Mandy replies, “I do, I miss my cock. But after being a girl for a few hours, I got used to it, so I figured it wouldn’t hurt to stay a girl until Sunday evening. I’ll transform back into a boy before my parents return from their trip.”<br />
<br />
Mason shrugs, “if that is how you decide, then I’m okay with it, mate,” he says, “no offense, but you really look amazing! Really hot!”<br />
<br />
Mandy looks down at herself, “I must admit,” she says, “I do have the body of a goddess, every other girl would kill for a body like this.”<br />
<br />
Mason nods, “I bet they would,” he says, “don’t worry though, mate,” he continues, “I’ll keep my hands away from you.”<br />
<br />
Mandy is about to say that she wouldn’t mind, but quickly remembers that Jeff wouldn’t say such a thing, being a straight boy and all, instead she says, “I suggest you do that, because: if you should try anything while I’m like this, you can kiss our friendship good-bye,” giving Mason a stern look.<br />
<br />
“Our friendship more important to me than wanting to have sex with the hottest girl in the Universe,” he says, smiling.<br />
<br />
Mandy smiles back, ‘man… I should get an Oscar for my performance,’ she thinks to herself, smirking inwardly, ‘you don’t know it yet, Mason, but we WILL have sex, you will just not remember anything!’<br />
<br />
“What are we going to do about Mandy in your old body,” Mason asks.<br />
<br />
Mandy grins, “oh, don’t worry about her,” she says, “thanks to the reality alteration, our parents will think that Mandy, or rather &quot;Jess&quot;, since she is now inhabiting my old bods, has just been born five months ago. So, she’ll be staying a brabbling baby for a while, and until she is able to talk again, she probably will have forgotten everything that has happened,” she continue, ‘and I will make sure “Mandy” WILL forget who she really is, but for now, I will enjoy seeing my stupid brother tortured, hehe,’ she thinks to herself.<br />
<br />
“Fine by me,” Mason says, “I hope she won’t turn into a creep again, but we have the game, so in case she does start to become creepy, a little personality tweak should solve that problem,” he adds, grinning and winking.<br />
<br />
Mandy grins back, “correct,” she says.<br />
<br />
“So, I assume, that if Mandy is now &quot;Jess&quot;... that would make you &quot;Andy&quot; when you return to being a boy?” Mason asks.<br />
<br />
Mandy nods, &quot;I guess so,&quot; she says, keeping up the act, &quot;and while I am in this form, you&#39;d better call me &quot;Mandy&quot;, especially in front of my parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mason nods, &quot;very well, Andy,&quot; he says, grinning, &quot;so, what would you like to do for the rest of the evening?&quot;</p>
