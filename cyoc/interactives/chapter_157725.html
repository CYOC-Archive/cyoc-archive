<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex knew it was a dream even as it was happening. It was probably one of the most vivid dreams he had ever had but it was obviously a dream. He remembered going to sleep in Eli&#39;s bed, the other man&#39;s warm bulk right beside him, but here he was laying in a field of soft grass and wildflowers, stark naked. That wasn&#39;t even the part that tipped him off, it was the two men with him. Eli was behind him, furry chest pressed up against his back, mouth exploring his neck with thick, calloused hands rand over his chest and stomach. The other man was a crush from back home, Chase, Alex&#39;s jock of a neighbor. Built like a brick wall, muscular, even more so than Eli, but shaved smooth. Alex used to watch Chase mow the lawn shirtless, and was probably his first crush, definitely one of the major tip offs that he was gay anyway, and here he was in the dream, sucking off Alex&#39;s dick.<br />
<br />
Alex was riding the edge of orgasm, not quite peaking but sitting there right on the cusp. It was agony and heaven all at once. And then a voice spoke up, it was neither Eli&#39;s or Chase&#39;s and neither stopped in their pleasuring of Alex when he voice broke in. &quot;Gods, you are pent up, but nice dream. Though you got Eli a bit wrong.. he&#39;d have his dick up your ass if he could. In fact he&#39;s dreaming of that right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex looked around as best he could and saw another nude man sitting on a fallen tree, watching the trio. He didn&#39;t recognize this man, nor did he even look human. The man had a slight greenish tone to his skin, and his hair was the color of fiery autumn foliage. In fact, it was foliage. Everywhere he would normally have hair, on his head, chest, and around his cock, it was instead leaves. &quot;Who..?&quot; It was all Alex could manage to get out, his mind distracted by the two other men.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Chel, a dryad. You&#39;re asleep under one of my trees and that means I get to spy on your dreams.&quot; The man smiles brightly. &quot;Thank gods, I needed a little variety. Eli&#39;s a friend but his dreams are a bit repetitive.&quot; At Alex&#39;s startled look Chel just smiled. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I have a deal with him, I won&#39;t hurt you. In fact..&quot; He stood up and walked over to where Alex sat trapped between Eli and Chase, placing a hand on his head, rigid green cock hovering just inches from his face. But it wasn&#39;t completely green, towards the head it turned a rosy color, and the scent coming off of it was earthy but sweet. There was a glistening bit of fluid right on the tip and Alex flicked out his tongue without thinking to lick it free. Sweetness exploded on his tongue, like fruit nectar mixed with a touch of honey. It made his tongue tingle.<br />
<br />
Chel smiled down at Alex. &quot;Did Eli tell you how things work in this world? No..&quot; He shakes his head. &quot;Eli is a good sort, but he likes keeping secrets.&quot; Chel stepped closer to Alex, and almost as if his body was moving on its own, he wrapped his lips around the head of Chel&#39;s cock, wanting more of that sweet nectar.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you take in the seed of another being, you start to become more like them. Get fucked by an orc, get more muscular. But do it too many times.. fuck an orc repeatedly, and you become an orc. Understand?&quot; Alex bobbed his head up and down, Chel&#39;s hand ruffling his hair as if petting him. &quot;Potions, magic, there&#39;s so many ways to change yourself here.. especially for you humans. So you&#39;re probably wondering what will happen once I cum in your mouth.&quot; The dryad grinned. &quot;Maybe it won&#39;t count in a dream?&quot; He shook his head. &quot;I&#39;m a fae creature, dreams are as good as reality. But here I can control the gift I give you a little.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex continued to feast on Chel&#39;s cock, savoring every drop of nectar on his tongue. He started to writhe under the touch of the dream-Eli and dream-Chase. His whole body felt on fire, suffused by a warmth coming from his stomach. &quot;You see, Eli is a good friend of mine, and he really wants to stuff you with that cock of his. Your ass can&#39;t quite take it, yet. Fae are beings of passion, and so, I can make sure with a little dose of my cum, you&#39;ll be able to spread those cheeks for him, take him right down to his balls. Even make certain spots on your body just a bit more.. sensitive.&quot; As if planned, dream-Eli ran his hands over Alex&#39;s nipples and they sent a tingle of pleasure through him like he&#39;d never felt before.<br />
<br />
Alex looked up at Chel, wanting to ask him why, but with his mouth full of that delicious cock all he could do was murmur. The question seemed to get across anyway. &quot;I promised not to tell anyone his secret. Just.. consider staying with him. Think about it.&quot; Chel started thrusting his cock into Alex&#39;s mouth, until a flood of warm, sweet syrup flooded over his tongue and down his throat. Like the finest, richest maple syrup Alex had ever tasted, he felt his own cock suddenly explode inside of dream-Chase&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
Alex woke with a start, his cock rock hard but thankfully not spilling his seed out into the bed furs, even though he still felt like he just experienced one of the best orgasms of his life. But the feeling of Eli behind him from the dream was still there, a warm furry chest pressed up against his back, one muscular arm draped over his side almost protectively, an a hard warmth pressed against his ass cheeks and lower back that must be Eli&#39;s erect cock. It felt right, and perfect, and Alex was just about to doze off back to sleep when he noticed someone else was in the room.<br />
<br />
Chel sat in one of the chairs, stark naked just as he was in the dream. He winked at Alex, put a finger over his lips in the universal sign for quiet, and disappeared. Curiously, Alex ran his fingers over one of his nipples, it felt a bit larger, and was definitely a whole lot more sensitive. Tingling under that touch like it never had before, so some change from the dream stuck, and now he was curious if he could take that monster he felt pressed between himself and Eli.</p>
