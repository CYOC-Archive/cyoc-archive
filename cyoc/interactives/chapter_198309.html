<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After leaving the doctor&#39;s office Luna decided to go straight home as she had nothing else to do. The subway on the way back was more crowded than usual for the time and she was forced to stand during the journey. At one stop the car she was filling up even more as some high school students entered and a girl stood in front of her with her back to her.<br />
<br />
Luna couldn&#39;t help but overhear the girl in front of her talking to her friend and thus knew that they had been dismissed early due to a gas leak at school. She looked at the girl a little and started to pay attention to her hair and what she could see of her body, but soon she realized that she was getting hatd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, why am I getting an erection right now? Am I feeling attracted to this girl? But I&#39;ve never had any attraction to other females before. Is having a dick changing my preferences or is it just a new instinctual trait in me?&quot; Luna thought, hoping that no one would notice and that her erection would pass.<br />
<br />
The subway made one more stop, the last stop before which she was going to get off, and during the entry and exit of passengers she couldn&#39;t help, when one of them pushed her, from touching the girl and feeling her hard cock being pressed against the girl&#39;s buttocks.<br />
<br />
As expected the girl noticed the hard thing that was pressed against her and looked back, by the look in her eyes she knew what it was and had identified that it belonged to Luna. A mischievous smile appeared on her face, which whispered something in her friend&#39;s ear, who also smiled mischievously and looked at Luna.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about your perverted tranny? What are you thinking getting this hard behind me?&quot; the girl said<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry, it was unintentional.&quot; Luna said, not knowing how to get out of this situation. She was about to be accused of harassment and there was nothing she could do about it because no one would believe her if she said she was a normal woman just over a day earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want you to apologize. If you don&#39;t want me to report you for harassment you must accompany us when we get off at the next station.&quot; the girl said<br />
<br />
Luna was forced to obey the girl and, after leaving the station where they got off the subway, follow her in the opposite direction to her house. The girl&#39;s friend also went along and on the way she learned that the girl&#39;s name was Tyla and her friend&#39;s Melody. They stopped in front of a house, which was the house where Melody lived. The student said her parents would take a while to get back from work, then took them to a room that belonged to her older sister who moved out after getting married.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now take off your clothes, we want to see you in full.&quot; Tyla said<br />
<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t you dare disobey or we&#39;ll call the police saying you broke into the house and tried to rape us.&quot; Melody said<br />
<br />
Luna couldn&#39;t believe what situation she had gotten herself into, and she even realized that deep down she was enjoying it and her hard cock pulsed with excitement as she undressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re enjoying this aren&#39;t you? Look how hard you are, you really are a pervert.&quot; Melody said<br />
<br />
&quot;Although we are too.&quot; Tyla said and she and her friend undressed slowly, dancing in a striptease as they circled Luna, seducing and arousing her even more.<br />
<br />
Luna felt her dick getting even harder, this was more than she thought possible because at this moment her dick was so hard it felt like it was made of metal. She couldn&#39;t take it anymore and something needed to be done, and to her relief she didn&#39;t have to wait long.<br />
<br />
The girls made Luna lie on the bed, then bent down holding their breasts tight together, placing and pressing one pair against the other while Luna&#39;s cock was in the space between their four breasts. Tyla and Melody titfucked Luna, taking turns sucking the tip of her dick until the visitor announced she was going to come, so they stopped and held back watching the cum shoot out of her dick.<br />
<br />
Luna was taken by surprise because this orgasm was the most intense she&#39;s had since her dick grew and she didn&#39;t expect it. Even after she had come like that, her cock remained hard, which she found strange because she felt that more blood was going to her member as if it were going to make it even harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;This perverted aijda is full of energy to keep playing.&quot; Tyla said<br />
<br />
&quot;And we have what she needs.&quot; Melody said<br />
<br />
The friends then played a game of rock-paper-scissors. Melody won and climbed on top of Luna, lowering herself until the tip of his cock began to open the entrance to her pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop, please. I can&#39;t explain what, I haven&#39;t had a dick for a long time and I don&#39;t know if this is normal, but I feel like something is wrong with it.&quot; Luna said<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t escape us, I want to feel you come inside me.&quot; Melody said and bent down even more, making Luna&#39;s cock enter her pussy completely.<br />
<br />
Luna couldn&#39;t do anything and soon she felt that inside Melody it started to get tighter, and her balls also felt different, as if they were getting heavier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... Who would have thought... that you... would have saved more. I...can...feel...your dick...getting bigger...inside me.&quot; Melody said while she was being fucked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, check out her balls.&quot; Tyla, who was masturbating while watching, said<br />
<br />
Luna somehow managed to get one of her hands into her ballsack and noticed that her balls were getting bigger. She was worried trying to imagine how big she was going to get, but it felt so good that she started to think that the change she was going through wasn&#39;t a problem. It didn&#39;t take long for her to come, feeling like she had more cum in this orgasm than before, and even after the second orgasm in a row she was still hard and willing to go for more.<br />
<br />
Melody, who Luna didn&#39;t even realize she was coming while she was lost in her own orgasm, got up and sat in the chair next to the desk with the excess cum dripping from her pussy and dripping onto the floor.<br />
<br />
Now I guess Luna&#39;s new dick size was clearly visible. Her new member was now 10 inches long and her balls had reached the size of golf balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my turn now, fill me with your milk.&quot; Tyla said getting on all fours for Luna.<br />
<br />
This time Luna had no doubts and simply impaled the girl&#39;s pussy that offered to her without holding back. Even as she fucked this girl more Melody wasn&#39;t satisfied, she put on a strap-on and with that fucked Luna&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
They continued their threesome for a while longer, but not only did Luna there know about the mutation she had suffered, but no one knew yet that she had been shut down by a virus and that it was contagious, even more so through sex.</p>
