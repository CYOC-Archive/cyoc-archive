<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, since this is my life from now on, I better think of a way to make the most of it. But first of all &quot;I wish that people who see me will treat me as if I always have been like this. And all of them will think that I have always been a woman too if we have had any previous contact before.&quot; There, that took care of the immediate concern.<br />
<br />
With the issue of public opinion/approval now out of the way, it is time to start helping myself out. To start, &quot;I wish my body was shaped better to support not only a quadropeddle form, but a form that still allow for me to live independently if I want to, and is still very sexy.&quot; I know it is a vague wish, but it seems like the magic behind the wish understands the intentions I have.<br />
<br />
My body now starts tingling and reshaping slightly. The first change is that my legs and arms shift to equal eachother in length, allowing for my back to be parallel to the ground. This immediately takes a load off of my shoulders as the weight of my breasts becomes a bit more equally distributed. I am no longer quite as &quot;top&quot; heavy, though I guess now that is considered &quot;front&quot; heavy. <br />
<br />
My arms then thicken a bit, enough to match my thighs and calves as my hand slightly reshapes to allow for a sturdier base. My wrists bend back 90°, now making this their default position, as my palms and the bottoms of my feet grow in heavy, dark colored calluses, padding my hands so that practically nothing bothers me if walked on, even loose stones likely would not bother me now. <br />
<br />
I look at my left hand and notice how my palm is now much longer too, and how my fingers seemed to shrink to compensate. It looks more similar to a foot with a thumb than a human hand. The next part to change on me is completely unexpected though. My shoulders shift, so that now they are aligning in line with my hips, which honestly is pretty restrictive of my arm movements to just those similar to what my legs can make. <br />
<br />
Next, my shoulder bones break. The pain is intense but lasts only a few seconds as the broken bones are reshaped. Then to my surprise, a second pair of arms grow out of my shoulders, in front of my first pair. Wait, no, they are not arms, but tentacles. Tentacles long enough to not only reach both of my nipples with ease, but also then continue to both slip inside of my pussy. It seems that they do not have a fixed length either, which is very convenient. It is kind of freaky, but also quite interesting.<br />
<br />
The last noticable changes are that my nipples lengthen into proper udder-like teats, my breasts become slightly pinkish, my neck lengthens by just a few inches to where it is just long enough to reach the grass if I bend forward with my front lowered down as much as I can, my pussy and asshole are realign to now point backwards, and I grow a very cow-like tail. <br />
<br />
Since my teeth are the same, I likely am still an omnivore, but grass now looks a lot more appealing to me, so maybe my sense of what is food has also been altered? I don&#39;t know for sure, but that sounds probable. I also am able to turn my head almost 360° around thanks to my longer neck. My tongue is much longer too, as apparently it was lengthened at some point. It now is able to lick my teats which are pretty far from the reach of my mouth. Well, to put it in a different perspective, after a quick test, I now know that I can lick my cervix with still more than enough length to spare. <br />
<br />
My tentacles also are quite interesting. They are rather sensitive bastards though. But that could be just due to the fact that they are new and unused. They are both incredibly strong and obviously flexible. One of them can lift me off of the ground completely with little effort. So if I ever needed to use my hand-feet for something, I can hold myself up using one or both of them as substitute fore legs. They also have a semi-mind of their own too. They can move by themselves, but will do what I need at a moment&#39;s notice. So it would seem that only once they are idel, will they start doing things on their own. I bet they have a defensive reflex too, or at least I hope they do. <br />
<br />
Anyways, now that I am in a much more convenient and honestly, extremely comfortable body, I want to look into a mirror, just to be sure that I haven&#39;t missed any changes. I do love the fact that I naturally know how to walk and do not need to learn how to do that. I quickly get to my room and look into the mirror. I quickly notice 3 changes that went unnoticed. My ears are cow ears, I have cow horns, and my septum has been pierced for some reason. Though now that I think about it, I did wish to still be sexy, so maybe that did it. It could also be from the fact that I am now like, at least 20% dairy cow too. That said, the golden ring is kinda cute and does not bother me one bit, so I am fine leaving it in until if it starts to bother me. <br />
<br />
Turning around, I look behind me with my neck turned 180° and examine my new ass. And damn, what as ass. It is nearly perfection if I do say so myself. The only flaw is how blatantly visible my asshole and pussy are now. But my tail helps fix that to an extent. Yeah, its not like I can just wear clothing either. I mean, I maybe could wish something up, but I am liking this new nude look. It feels so much more natural and comfortable. <br />
<br />
Checking my closet, I discover it to be practically empty, save for a few doubles up pairs of high heels, stockings, and some kind of covering or something. It drapes over my body and has both a neck and a tail hole, but that is all. It bairly covers my pussy too. So when I move, I bet that it wont do shit to preserve my modesty one bit. Then again, my pair of 5 inch long teats are hanging just a few inches off the floor anyways, so maybe any chance of me preserving my modesty has completely been thrown out the window already. Fuck it, it is really cute, so I decide that I will still wear it when I go out on special occasions. <br />
<br />
It is then that I hear the door bell ring. Which is odd since I am not expecting anyone. &quot;Who in the hell...?&quot; I say as I look out the upstairs window and notice that this extremely hot lady is ringing my doorbell. Well, I guess I should at least go find out what she is here for. When I open the door the woman just walks inside like she owns the place. I am extremely confused, so I quietly wish to know what is going on, and to know who she is, and what is the nature of our relationship. It turns out that...</p>
