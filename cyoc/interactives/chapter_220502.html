<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick clanked out of the room, his footfalls becoming clops as he ran through the frat house.<br />
<br />
Just in time. <br />
<br />
Behind him, he could hear the pantry door swing open so hard it hit the wall, and then the sound of goat-men bleating and chewing and crunching on lettuce filled his nonexistent ears. Nick ran safely around the corner and took a moment to find his bearings.<br />
<br />
The frat house had changed even in the few minutes he’d stayed in the pantry.<br />
<br />
Nick was struck by the grandeur of the foyer. <br />
<br />
It was a vast, open space, with marble floors and walls lined with ancient murals depicting scenes from Greek mythology. All of the walls were adorned with colorful murals depicting scenes of wild parties and revelry, adding to the energetic atmosphere of the space. He looked up and saw that the building was now a towering three-story edifice, and the ceiling was a domed masterpiece, painted with images of the gods in all their glory.<br />
<br />
In the center of the room was a circular bar area center around a grand hearth, its flickering flames casting dancing shadows across the walls. The smell of rich, fruity wine mingled with the scent of stone and wood, along with the heady odor of randy satyr musk. Plush cushions were strewn everywhere, as were empty goblets.<br />
<br />
All of the other furniture was sturdy and rustic, made from natural materials like wood and stone to accommodate the half-goat form of the Satyrs. <br />
<br />
Off to the sides of the Great Hall, Nick could see bedrooms. Most didn’t even have doors, just beaded curtains or shimmery veil-like drapes. Inside, the  bedrooms were small and cozy, with animal skins and furs used for bedding and decoration. The walls were adorned with posters of famous Satyr musicians and performers, none of whom Nick knew or had even heard of.<br />
<br />
There came another crash from the pantry behind him and bleating laughter. <br />
<br />
He clip-clopped up the stairs, the armor feeling slightly different as he did. It was like he had a spring in his step, and maybe he did, Nick had no idea how armor was made. As Nick ascended the wide, sweeping stairs of the Satyr Fraternity, he couldn&#39;t help but admire the intricate carvings of goats that adorned the banisters. <br />
<br />
The details were exquisite, each curve and line perfectly capturing the wild and untamed nature of these mythical creatures. The walls were made of rough-hewn stone, with columns carved in intricate patterns that rose high into the sky. Each column was topped with a capital in the shape of a goat&#39;s head, lending the building an air of wildness and raw energy. It was like someone had imported an ancient Greek temple and then filled it with modernity.<br />
<br />
As he reached the second floor, he noticed that the common area extended upward, with balconies overlooking the space below. The walls were adorned with even more colorful murals, each one seemingly more vibrant and alive than the last. The scenes depicted were from Greek mythology, with gods and heroes in various states of triumph and struggle.<br />
<br />
He continued upward, drawn by a pull that seemed almost otherworldly.<br />
<br />
When he reached the third floor, he found himself in a space unlike any he had seen before. The ceiling was vaulted and domed, with intricate patterns of stars and moons etched into the stone. The furniture here was sparse but elegant, with pieces crafted from polished wood and gleaming metal. <br />
<br />
As he made his way down the hallway, Nick couldn&#39;t help but notice the doors to the various bedrooms. Unlike the rooms on the bottom floor, which were more open affairs, likely for one night stands, these room were Private. Each door was decorated in its own unique style, ranging from ornate carvings to intricate murals. Finally, he reached Zach&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
Zach&#39;s door stood out from the others in the fraternity. <br />
<br />
It was covered in colorful stickers and posters, featuring illustrations of fantastical creatures and characters from various role-playing games. A large wooden plaque hanging from the door bore the words &quot;Zach&#39;s Lair&quot; in bold letters, and was adorned with miniature dragon figurines.<br />
<br />
As Nick approached the door, he could hear the faint sound of classical music playing from within. He raised his hand to knock, but paused when he noticed a small handwritten sign tacked to the door. In bold, black letters, it read: &quot;Warning: Entering the Lair of Zach may result in spontaneous outbursts of nerdy banter and the desire to roll dice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick couldn&#39;t help but chuckle to himself as he knocked on the door. At least some things never changed. He&#39;d have to make Zach get rid of the corny sign. It was too cringey, even for him. <br />
<br />
“Yes, who is it?” Zach&#39;s voice was muffled by the door, but sounded softer than normal.<br />
<br />
“It’s Nick.” Nick voice was growing more hollow by the second. He heard hooves coming up the stairs. “And uh, could you hurry?”<br />
<br />
The door swung open, and Nick hurried into Zach’s room.<br />
<br />
He was immediately struck by the array of Dungeons & Dragons paraphernalia that adorned the walls and shelves. The room was a veritable shrine to the game, with stacks of rulebooks and character sheets piled high on every surface.<br />
<br />
But it wasn&#39;t just the books and games that caught his eye. Zach was also an avid painter of miniatures, spending countless hours meticulously crafting each figure until it was a true work of art. <br />
<br />
As he looked around the room, he saw dozens of intricately painted miniatures, each one a work of art in its own right. From fierce dragons to nimble thieves, each figure was painted with an almost obsessive attention to detail, every brushstroke imbuing the miniature with a lifelike quality that was truly breathtaking. Nick couldn&#39;t help but be impressed by the skill and attention to detail that went into each piece.<br />
<br />
And then there was the lewdness.<br />
<br />
It threw Nick off guard, because while he knew Zach was a nerd he hadn’t expected to see a sprawling collection of erotic literature, adult toys, and other naughty delights. Books of erotic fiction and hentai lined a shelf that was topped with dildos. Perhaps the changes had finally affected him after all?<br />
<br />
“Can I help you?” Zach asked in a voice had a smooth and velvety quality to it, with a low, sultry timbre that sent shivers down Nick’s spine.<br />
<br />
Nick turned and saw a satyr sitting in a nook by the lone window, a ring lamp on a nearby desk illuminating a miniature in his hands. He was painstakingly painting fleshtones on a very horny satyr model.<br />
<br />
Unlike many of his athletic and muscular counterparts, Zach had a more traditionally nerdy body type.<br />
<br />
He was shorter and slightly pudgy, with a round belly and soft curves that begged to be touched. His fur was a deep, rich brown, with streaks of gold and bronze woven throughout. And his eyes, bright and mischievous, seemed to twinkle with a barely contained excitement which, combined with his stubby horns, gave him an adorable, almost innocent look.<br />
<br />
“It’s me, Nick,” Nick said.<br />
<br />
Zach eyed the knight critically, his purt lips drawn into a frown.<br />
<br />
“Is that your costume?” Zach asked, carefully setting down his miniature and paintbrush before walking over to inspect Nick.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Nick’s voice was hollow. He carefully removed the helmet, revealing a human face underneath. “There’s a trick to it. If I remove the helmet, I’m human. Go ahead and remove it yourself.”<br />
<br />
Nick placed the helmet back on.<br />
<br />
Zach cocked his head. “Is something supposed to happen? The LEDs are a nice touch, by the way. Looks just like glowing eyes.”<br />
<br />
“Pull off the helmet and find out.” Nick’s voice went hollow again.<br />
<br />
“Voice changer too?” Zach muttered, then carefully removed the straps on the helmet and lifted it.<br />
<br />
There was nothing there. No head, no face. Zach peered down into the chestpiece. No one was inside.<br />
<br />
“Magic.” Zach nodded to himself.<br />
<br />
“Can you put the helmet back?” Nick’s voice came from the empty helmet.<br />
<br />
Zach jumped, staring at the helmet accusingly before he calmed down and smiled. “Fine.”<br />
<br />
He placed it securely onto Nick’s chestpiece and strapped it into place.<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Nick said.<br />
<br />
“Baah~” Zach laughed, a deep, throaty chuckle that made Nick’s heart skip a beat. “Don’t mention it. Can I improve it?”<br />
<br />
“Improve it?” Nick blushed. “Uh, sure, go ahead...&quot;</p>
