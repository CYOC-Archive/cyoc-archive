<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The school day flew by for Jennifer. All day she talked to people about the Halloween party she was throwing that night. Hundreds from the school were going to show up. Her parents were out of town and she was eager to show off her enormous house with its indoor pool and the basketball court which she had her maid and others she had hired turn into a dance floor. She had even rented a stage and spot lights for the band and ordered food by the truckload. <br />
	When the bell that signaled the end school she quickly said goodbye to her friends and rushed home to finish over seeing the setup and to get dressed in her costume. Everyone was instructed to wear a costume and if you were coming with a date you were supposed to dress in a costume that had some connection with that of your date. Jennifer was going to wear one of her cheerleader uniforms and her boyfriend Tom would be in his football jersey. Jen got dressed quickly and found that most of the food and decorations were already in place and the band was to arrive any minute to setup. <br />
	Soon everything was in place and Tom had arrived. All Jen could do was wait eagerly for the rest of her guests. They started coming in slowly at first, a few at a time, yet by the time the sun had set dozens had poured into the house and dozens more were showing up. By ten Jen guessed more than half the school and much more than half the seniors had arrived. By eleven the dance floor was a mass of costumed teenagers bouncing to the beat of the band, and the pool was spilling water over the edges from the displacement of all the wet bodies it held. <br />
	At midnight the band took a break, leaving the stage clear. Jen did not recognize the dark haired girl that took the stage in the lull. She's beautiful, was Jen's first thought. She was dressed in a form fitting black dress that hugged her breasts, hips, and thighs, showed off her spectacular body. A tall witches hat with a the tip slightly crooked sat on her satin smooth hair. Jen did not stop her from taking up the microphone under the main spotlight. <br />
	&quot;Hello everyone.&quot; She started, her voice smooth and soft, her lips a deep red like an autumn apple. &quot;I have a little bit of an announcement.&quot; The crowd quieted at the sound, even those in other rooms stilled as the sound was amplified through the speakers wired throughout the mansion. <br />
	&quot;For the last four years I have attended school with most of you. And I have been treated like shit. A day ago most of you wouldn't have given me a second glance, and the rest of you would have gone our of your way to torment me.&quot; Jen listened, shocked like the rest into inaction. She didn't think she had ever seen this girl before tonight, she certainly never tormented her.<br />
	&quot;Now I think it is time for revenge.&quot; The pale women continued. &quot;This morning I was a nobody, a nothing. Tonight I have the power to change you all forever, literally, and that's exactly what I plan on doing. I will use you all, play with you, make you grant my every wish and whim.&quot;<br />
It was at this someone from the crowd broke the spell.<br />
	&quot;Get off the stage you crazy bitch!&quot; A boys voice called. The glare that the woman shot his direction silenced the crowd once more.<br />
	&quot;Excellent, I suppose I do need a volunteer to make my point.&quot; Her voice rubbed the air like ice on stone. She pointed a long slender finger and the boy who had shouted and grinned and said one word.<br />
	&quot;Bitch.&quot; At the sound the boy stiffened and then gasped. Grabbing his chest as if in pain. Most of the onlookers could not make out what was happening, but those who were closer saw. Beneath the boys clenched fists the front of the superman costume he was wearing was expanding. It bulged outward further and further, leaving impressions of large round nipples in the cloth. Next, his hair began to grow, falling in golden curls to his shoulders. No one noticed the slight bulge in his spandex pants shrink and fade. <br />
	The witch woman raised her hand again, this time in a wave, palm forward, before clenching her fist and pulling violently downward in the air as if she were trying to pull wallpaper from an invisible wall. The boys costume shredded, exposing a now very obvious set of breasts and four more smaller breasts beginning to bud below them. His ears were next to change, growing and flopping into his soft yellow hair, growing their own yellow fur along the backs. A long red tongue lolled from the boys now womanly lips, showing of his slightly pointed teeth. Those behind the boy saw the tail rip free of the blue spandex, fully furred and wagging above a round feminine ass. <br />
	The changes happened very rapidly and were complete before even those close enough to see could understand what had happened. Yet once they did a girl screamed and panic set in. The crowd heaved away from the bitch boy and some pushed for the doors. Those farther away joined in, not knowing what had happened but joining in the panic of the crowd. When those that ran reached the doors they found them impossibly bricked shut almost as if the doors themselves had been turned to brick and began to panic even more wildly. The windows were the same, no room they could reach held any means of escape. <br />
	As the crowd heaved the woman on stage raised another hand and waved it over her head in a slow circle. As she did the crowd calmed once again, slowly coming to a stand still, seeming confused and dazed. The witch girl grinned. <br />
	&quot;Much better. I guess I should have guessed what would happen when I began, but no matter. Its all settled now. I have changed all your minds to be far better able to cope with the stress I am planing for you all. No more panic, a lot more fun.&quot; The dog boy sat in the middle of the dance floor, tail trailing behind him. Others stood all around gaping, still shocked even if they were not terrified. His six breasts hung from his chest heavily as he breathed, large dark nipples pointing out stiffly.<br />
	&quot;What did you do to me?&quot; He asked, quivering. <br />
	&quot;I made you a 'bitch' in every sense of the word dear, you should really watch what you call a witch. Don't worry though, its only what I plan on doing to all of you.&quot; The smile that slid across the dark haired woman's face was poison, her green eyes were fire as they glittered in the spot light.<br />
	 &quot;I am going to change you all. One, two, maybe a dozen at a time, into whatever I desire. I may even change you more than once. I may change your bodies, minds, or even your very souls if I desire. Oh and I do, I do so very much.&quot; She paced the stage now as she spoke, getting more and more excited. &quot;I'll call you up on stage for your turn. Into the spotlight for all to see. Oh and you better come or it will be worse for you, I swear it. The costumes might be a good starting point, maybe I'll make you into what you dressed as, or even better maybe I'll make you into whatever your date is dressed as!&quot; She laughed at the thought. &quot;Maybe I&quot;ll make you a child in mind or an animal. I could make your only desire to dance or even turn you into a tree. I could give you the soul of the person you hate most or take yours away completely.&quot; She paused a moment as if thinking and then continued. <br />
        &quot;I could even make you play games against your friends with the loser getting the worse transformation. I am not going to limit myself. Anything goes dearies, anything I can think of.&quot; She stopped speaking, the velvet flow of her voice fading slowly from the ears of her dread filled listeners. Jen was finally able to break out of her shock and spoke.<br />
	&quot;Who the hell are you?&quot; She was proud that she managed to keep her voice steady... mostly. She faltered when the witch girls deep green eyes met her own.<br />
	&quot;For now you can call me Kylie... Kylie the Sorceress.&quot; She froze Jen in place a moment with her piercing eyes before turning her venomous gaze back to the crowd in general. &quot;Now!&quot; She shouted raising her arms. &quot;Who is first?!&quot;</p>
