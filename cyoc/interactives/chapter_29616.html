<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>"Hank, can you come out please, we would like to see you. However, we would like you to come out in clothes, but wear something that still shows off your manly features please."</br>
<br>"As you wish Master Dean."</br>
<br>Hank appeared before the two, pretty much the same as he had when he first appeared. However, he followed Dean's wishes. Hank was wearing a pair of jean shorts, which were a bit small for his crotch, but that was fine because it showed off his bulge. He was also wearing a plaid button down shirt, having it completely unbuttoned, showing off his manly and hairy pecs.</br>
<br>"Is this better?"</br>
<br>Both Dean and Sam nodded their heads. Both men tried not to stare, but it was very hard not to. After a couple minutes of silence and the two ogling Hank, Hank broke the silence.</br>
<br>"So... was there a reason you called me back out, or are you two just going to continue to stare?"</br>
<br>Sam and Dean shook their heads, snapping out of their rude behavior. "Yes, we are sorry Hank. We would like to have some drinks here, but we were also wondering what you could make us."</br>
<br>"I can make you any kind of drink that you would like, but it either has to be in my database or you have to specify what it is called, what liquor is involved as well the amounts."</br>
<br>"Ok... what do you have in your database for drinks?"</br>
<br>"I have pretty much everything that is common to the special drinks that were created by other men who used a room like this one. From what the networked Hanks tell me, the most common one is called a Mans Man. According to what the ingredients are, it would sound very tasty, but it is also quite strong, hence how it received it's name."</br>
<br>"Ok Hank, we will have that. One for each of us of course, unless you would like to join us."</br>
<br>"I would love to Dean, but it would make no difference as I have no taste buds, I cannot become inebriated/drunk, and I can assume any process of thought or physical state of being. All you have to do is ask."</br>
<br>"That sounds really cool... Does that mean you could become an anthro-bear if I asked you?"</br>
<br>"Yes... like I said, I can become anything you want, as long as you ask for it. Why do you think I came out dressed. If I had a will of my own, I would come out naked as that is natural. Wearing these clothes are not normal, uncomfortable looking and they never were intended for us."</br>
<br>"That is cool! Ok, we will have those drinks, but why don't you put them on a bar, which will be situated along the far wall to the right of the bed. I'd also like for you to be the bartender and you can take off your shirt, especially since it is almost off anyway."</br>
<br>"Sure thing Master Dean!"</br>
<br>Suddenly, there was a large, dark brown oak bar sitting along the requested wall. It was big enough to serve six guys, having six barstools that were covered with black and shiny leather, along with silver studs that fastened down the seat covers. Hank walked behind the bar while taking off his shirt, throwing it to his left and under the bar. As Dean and Sam walked over to the bar, Hank smiled and they both blushed. Dean and Sam were very attracted to the man that was their personal assistant for as long as they lived. It would be a shame though, as they had to eventually die, Hank would be killed, in a way. He was very nice and handsome, but they thought all good things must come to an end.</br>
<br>Hank grabbed two medium sized glasses, did some tricks while pouring all the liquor and when he was finished, Hank set the glasses right in front of Dean and Sam.</br>
<br>"There you go boys! I hope you both can hold your liquor as I made it a bit stronger than I am supposed to, I think. If you can handle em', they will make men outta ya both!"</br>
<br>Dean and Sam shrugged, clang their glasses together and threw back their drinks. As the liquor went down, both guys cringed and swore as it burned, made their eyes and nose water. Hank stood there and chuckled.</br>
<br>"How was that for ya? Strong enough or do you want it harder?"</br>
<br>"No... that is good enough, I don't think Dean and I could take anything harder! I do think we are ready for another though."</br>
<br>Hank poured another two, set them down, and almost right after the glasses hit the wood, they took the drinks and downed them again. However this time it was a bit easier as they were feeling the affects of the first round, slightly buzzed. Dean and Sam smacked their lips, enjoying the flavor of the drink this time, as it was slightly less hard to swallow. Trying to figure out what was in it, they took time to analyze it a bit.</br>
<br>"Hey Hank..."</br>
<br>"Yes Sam, how can I help you?"</br>
<br>"I was wondering if you could tell me what is in this? I can make out most of what is in here, but there is something I cannot figure out."</br>
<br>"Sure thing. I am sure you can taste the Jack Daniels Whiskey, the Yeagermeister, the Colt forty-five and the 99 Root-beer. The other things are household sauces, not to mention a specialty liquor, apparently concocted by three men who still stay in the hotel. They were the first who chose the BEAR ROOM and they founded the Bear Bar. The specially liquor they made just for this drink is called Essence Of Man."</br>
<br>"Does that mean there is sperm in the liquor"</br>
<br>"No, there is no sperm in the liquor. According to the info I have on it, the men asked for something that would make them more manly. So their Hank made the liquor mainly pure testosterone. The liquor was ninety percent testosterone and ten percent Everclear, which is a very strong liquor that will get absorbed by the blood very quickly."</br>
<br>"So, how many drinks did they have and what happened to them afterward?"</br>
<br>"According to the records, there were four men who occupy the room. They had five drinks each and became extremely drunk, but when the liquor completely saturated all of their tissues, their bodies changed. Before the drinks, all four were average size, with no muscle definition, barely any body hair, couldn't grow beards and very disappointed with their cock sizes. After their transformations, they all were six feet-five inches tall, extremely muscular, as hairy as a bear, full grown beards, and when they check out their equipment, they were very happy with the results. A side note though, they were extremely horny due to all of the testosterone, all the time. Another thing noted, was the fact that their balls were a comparable size to match their humongous cocks, able to produce enough cum to fill each of their empty drink glasses, each and every time they came, no matter how close together their climaxes were."</br>
<br>Sam looked at Dean and Dean looked at Sam, smiling and considering trying it out for themselves.</br>
<br>"Hank, we want you to make three more for each of us, since we are already partially there anyway. Neither of us are happy with the way we look now."</br>
<br>Hank didn't say anything, but he poured the drinks like they told him. Three were placed in front of the two. Dean and Sam slammed the drinks pretty quick, one right after another. When all five were consumed, Dean and Sam tried to get up and walk, but they stumbled all over the Man Cave, reaching the bed and passed out.</br>
<br>After a few hours of drunken rest, the two wake up and find...</br></p>
