<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hi there! Welcome to Funko&#39;s!&quot;<br />
<br />
A sales associate was waiting for us the moment we came in and immediately looked at me expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have all sorts of new shoes in stock for young men if you...&quot; he was getting into his sales pitch so I decided to cut him off quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually sir! We&#39;re here for my friend, her flip-flop has...well failed.&quot; as I gestured down to Allison&#39;s duck taped footwear. I could have sworn I saw the sales associate looked confused for a second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I suppose we might have something. But this really more of a men&#39;s footwear store young lady. Are you ok with that? I&#39;d hate for you to be unsatisfied with your purchase.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, as long as I don&#39;t have to go home with a duck taped shoe I think I&#39;m happy.&quot; Allison was saying. <br />
<br />
The man shrugged and muttered, &quot;Suit yourself, come right this way to our summer section! We might be able to find the perfect thing for you anyway. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll grow to enjoy them after all!&quot; he said this with a twinkle in his eye.<br />
<br />
I was getting a bit nervous, after coming into the store I hadn&#39;t seen anything out of the ordinary. It was a nice store...heck it was a REALLY nice store. As he took us over to the summer section the walls became a clear blue like you would see at the beach and the floor took on a sandy color. The carpet was interesting as well, you&#39;d almost swear you had just walked onto the beach in the middle of a nice sunny day. The ambiance was helped by the gentle sounds of waves coming along the speakers in this section of the store along with some classic beach music (the Beach Boys...really?) playing along side of it. All and all it was pretty slick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, well I&#39;m afraid most of these will just be a bit big on you...Allison you said right?&quot; the store clerk was back into sales mode as Allison started to browse the racks looking for something she found interesting. Girl or not, she was a paying customer and it looked like he didn&#39;t care what gender shoes she wore as long as she paid. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and don&#39;t worry I kind of expected that. Are these the only sizes you have though? They&#39;re really big...&quot; the smallest she had found were a size 10 in men&#39;s. Way more than her usual 6-7 in women&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately yes, but why don&#39;t you try them on. You might surprise yourself!&quot; the sales clerk was saying enthusiastically. &quot;Now of course you could always look around for some other shoes, we have some great athletic choices as well as a nice sale on boots!&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison sighed and flung her flip flops off her feet as she gave the new flip flops a try. Unsurprisingly, they looked entirely too big on her feet. Her small toes not even going all the way to the end of the shoe. <br />
<br />
Allison gave a little sigh, &quot;Well that&#39;s a shame, they are very comfortable though.&quot;<br />
<br />
The store clerk smirked a bit. &quot;Well I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll grow into them. In fact I think you should head over to the changing station. Your friend can join you too. Maybe that&#39;ll help him decide on a pair for himself. Let&#39;s get you over there before things get too difficult shall we?&quot; <br />
<br />
Allison and I gave each other a confused look. I decided to ask the obvious question, &quot;Exactly why does she need to go to the changing station? She just tried them on. And heck why does a shoe store need a changing room?&quot;<br />
<br />
And just as I&#39;d finished my questions Allison gave a small gasp and I looked over to see what had grabbed her attention. Looking down it was fairly obvious, her feet were growing...and rapidly to fit the shoes she had on. My jaw dropped in amazement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Questions later, this can be a bit awkward for first timers. And most younger boys have issues dealing with the...new feelings. We&#39;ve only had a few girls before and usually they&#39;re a bit rowdier than the kids. It&#39;s a totally new experience for them.&quot; the clerk was saying all this as he helped Allison to her feet (not that they really looked it anymore) and walked her over to a deep blue room with the words &quot;Changing Room&quot; on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright get on in there you two! I hope you enjoy the shoes Allison and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy the show young man. It&#39;s always thrilling!&quot; the clerk was definitely enjoying himself at our discomfort. <br />
<br />
He shoved the two of us into the room and suddenly I heard a click and saw the word &quot;Occupied&quot; appear on the door. I assume the same was being shown outside. The odd thing about this changing room was that I saw no way of leaving now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh...this is starting to feel weird!&quot; Allison was sitting in the only chair in the fairly decently sized room and I could see what she was talking about. Her feet had swollen up to fill the shoe&#39;s completely and the funny part was that the toenail paint she had been wearing had faded away. Allison was scratching her feet as well now and that&#39;s when I noticed the hair growing on her feet. Quite a lot of it too, it was surprising, To top it all off the hair was blonde, not at all like the brown hair she had on her head currently. <br />
<br />
As she scratched, her calves started to twinge. Hair started to spread up from her ankles and as that blonde hair made its way up her legs, I was able to watch as her previously average muscles suddenly started to inflate. The muscles were firm and hard and extremely hairy by this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! What the hell is wrong with my legs! What are these shoes doing to me?!&quot; Allison was in panic mode at this point and it was hard for me to blame her.<br />
<br />
I did the only thing I could think of and bent down quickly to try and pull the shoes off her feet. As I got closer to her feet I noticed something new. There was some kind of smell near the flip flops. It made me think of the beach. I don&#39;t know why I couldn&#39;t think straight at this point. I put my hand on the shoes and her new feet and as I felt the curly blonde hairs under my hands I couldn&#39;t even think about taking the shoes off. It was like I wasn&#39;t even in the room anymore....and not only that but my momentary contact had suddenly made me very aware of how male her new lower portion was and for some reason that was turning me on. I had never been gay...in fact I was quite attracted to women but this smell seemed to awaken something new in me and it left me panting on the ground in front of Allison as I watched the rest of the show that the sales associate had promised me.</p>
