<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erma, Trevor, and Melissa were talking at the Tyson ranch gate when Erma said, &quot;Now, I take it ya got some more questions?  Why don&#39;t we take a walk into our house?  You could ask all you want there.&quot;  Melissa nodded as she walked through the front gate of the ranch and followed Erma and Trevor into their home. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your house is huge...&quot; Melissa commented as she looked at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, shucks,&quot; Erma said with her usual rye smile.  &quot;It&#39;s just what we needed to raise our four kids.  Don&#39;t tell anyone this, but Jacob and I made a killing raising all sorts of animals here.  Cows, pigs. chickens, even deer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deer?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup.  Turns out the town pays us a pretty penny to raise herds of deer here to keep them from dying out.  The local werewolves and werecats love to hunt them as prey, and we have to make sure that there&#39;s prey for them to hunt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa raised an eyebrow as she heard this.  &quot;But aren&#39;t deer hard to raise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you wouldn&#39;t believe it,&quot; Erma answered while laughing.  &quot;Fortunately, we got these werecow instincts helping us out with how they behave.  Let us know when to send the bucks out, when to get the does ready, and stuff like that.  We keep the deer fed, and let them loose when the time&#39;s right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...I see,&quot; Melissa responded.  The three of them made their way to the living room.  Trevor and Melissa sat on the soft next to each other while Erma sat in a chair across from them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, I get that you got some question for me.  Ask me anything.&quot; Erma said as she sat looking at Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, ok,&quot; Melissa responded as she thought for a moment.  &quot;So, how old were you when you became a werecow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Erma started as she took the time to think a bit, &quot;I was just barely in high school when we moved here.  I was just a bit past 14 and not quite 15 yet.&quot;  A smirk formed on her face as she continued to remember.  &quot;When we were in North Dakota, I remember being quite large for a girl my age and rather proud of it too.  Then my family moved here to Moon Lake as I said earlier, and boy was I wrong.  Compared to all of the other girls, I was as flat chested as a boy.  Anyway, when the town let us know about the whole mandatory were business, my pa was just spittin&#39; angry.  He was gonna have none of it, and ma too.   Although, just between you and me, ma would have done whatever pa did.  Tammy and Samuel were both too young at the time, so I had to step up to be a were for the family.  Otherwise, the town would have forced all of us to become weres.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa&#39;s eyes widened as she heard this, as this wasn&#39;t too far off from what she and her father had to deal with not too recently.  It reminded her that she better get a move on her decision before it&#39;s too late.  &quot;So, you decided to become a werecow.  How long did it take you to make that decision?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erma smiled and said, &quot;Not long really.  I grew up on a ranch, and I just loved raising cows.  I figured if I loved them so much, why shouldn&#39;t I join them?  I met Jacob at school, hearing that he was a werebull.  I asked him to change me, and after some arranging, the rest is history.  It wasn&#39;t long before we became a couple, graduated high school, started a house, and have calves of our own.&quot;  She leaned towards to Melissa as she spoke softly, &quot;And let me tell ya, there are two good reasons for joining a group.  First is that you love the animal, and have no problems taking on that animal.  Second is that you love the person who&#39;s changing you.&quot;  Melissa&#39;s ears burned when she heard that.<br />
<br />
Melissa thought for a moment and then asked, &quot;What happened with your brother and sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erma&#39;s smile disappeared from her face as she remembered the days of her youth.  &quot;Tammy...well Tammy, we don&#39;t know what happened to her.  Soon after she turned 14, she and pa had a huge argument.  I don&#39;t remember what it was about exactly, but the next morning, we discovered Tammy gone with a note saying that she ran away.  We called the police, and despite their best efforts, found neither hair nor hide of her.  To this day, we&#39;ve no idea what happened to her.  Samuel decided to become a weredog and join the police force.  He&#39;s a detective now, and he&#39;s been trying to figure out what happened to Tammy ever since.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I see.  I&#39;m sorry for asking that,&quot; Melissa said after looking at the expression on Erma&#39;s face.  A smile returned to her face as she waved on.  &quot;So, um,&quot; Melissa started to ask, &quot;did it hurt when you changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ho boy,&quot; Erma said with a bit of breath.  &quot;Where to begin with that one.  Let me put it to you this way.  When you become a were, there&#39;ll be two sides of you.  You have your human side, the stuff that makes you you, and the beast side which makes your animal side.  Now, when you become a were, your animal side becomes a part of who you are, and with that comes certain gifts.  Gifts that your body will have to adjust when you change.  I remember the night Jacob changed.  Jacob was a real gentleman, and after a bout of passionate love making...&quot; Erma paused as she noticed both Melissa and Trevor looking away, their faces as red as beets.  Erma laughed and said, &quot;Now, don&#39;t ya&#39;ll be bashful now.  It&#39;s a natural thing for us weres. Anyway, after a bout of passionate love making, I reckon it wasn&#39;t long before I started to change.  I&#39;ll admit was rather...discomforting to get all of those changes.  But once it was done, I felt better than before.  I had more energy, more strength, and I felt, well, alive.  Some of the changes stayed with me even after I changed back to a human.  And the second time that I changed, it didn&#39;t feel painful at all, but rather...let&#39;s just say that it felt so good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, okay,&quot; Melissa responded, her face still a bright shade of red.  &quot;So, another question.  If I were to become a werecow, what advice would you give me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that&#39;s a good question,&quot; Erma replied, &quot;Let me see...&quot; she paused as she thought for a moment.  She then continued with, &quot;Well, first things first is to get a good sports bra.  No doubt that after your first change, your breasts are gonna be much bigger than they are now.  Now, while we don&#39;t have a problem with sagging or anything like that, these girls,&quot; Erma said as she pointed to her own breasts, &quot;tend to fly around, especially when running or lifting or anything like that.  They can be quite distracting, both to you and to any boy out there who&#39;s interested in girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Melissa responded as she made a mental note of things she&#39;ll need after she speaks to dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Second, get a robe.  Now, this isn&#39;t a problem for smaller weres such as werefoxes, werecats, or wererabbits, but as you&#39;ve already seen, we werecattle can get quite large transforming.  If you changed with your clothes on, you&#39;ll probably end up destroying them.  Having a robe handy will help in preserving your modesty.&quot;  Melissa nodded as she understood that.  &quot;Finally, learn to live in harmony with your beast side.  Whichever were you choose, this is probably the most important thing you can remember.  If you try too hard to control your beast side, it can backfire badly.  I remember this one girl who became a wererabbit, and she tried to stay away from sex for too long.  After a couple of months, she started going into heat, and became willing to be with any man, and any man wanting to be with her at the same time.  Needless to say, she ended up being pregnant, and it took fourteen years to figure out who the father was.  On the other hoof, you can&#39;t let your beast side control you either.&quot;  She paused as she pursed her lips before continuing.  &quot;We weres are a tough bunch.  We heal fast, rarely get sick, and we can live for a long time.  But that doesn&#39;t make us immune to some cancers, accidents, and being shot.  The biggest reason, though, that weres don&#39;t last too long is that they go feral.  They start listening to their beast side a little too much, and the beast starts to take over.  Not too long after that, the beast starts taking more and more control, before the human side disappears and the beast is in complete control.  At that point, it&#39;s too late for them.  At best, we can lock them up before they hurt anyone.  At worst, we&#39;ll have to take them down because they pose a danger to everyone, weres and normals alike.  I can&#39;t tell you the number of weres I had to kill because they were attacking our animals and our farm.&quot;  Erma noticed the sad and scared looks on both Trevor&#39;s and Melissa&#39;s face.  &quot;Okay, now that I&#39;ve scared you lot, I&#39;ll just finish with this.  The best defence against turning feral is to have strong ties with the people you love.  As long as you maintain harmony and strong ties, you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, I just have one more question,&quot; Melissa asked.  &quot;Um...could you...um...show me what you look like...as a were....as a were cow?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erma laughed and said, &quot;Boy almighty, you&#39;re more timid than a mouse in a room full of cats.  I don&#39;t see why not, seeing as you might be joining us, it might not be a bad idea to show you what you&#39;re getting into.&quot;  With that said, she left the room to go to her bedroom.  Both Trevor and Melissa looked at each other, before Melissa turned and exhaled.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is way too much to take in.  But at least she isn&#39;t leaving anything out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, mom tends to talk people&#39;s ears off,&quot; Trevor replied with a chuckle. &quot;But is it helping?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa thought for a moment before saying, &quot;Yeah, I think it is.&quot; <br />
<br />
At that point, the bedroom door opened, and Erma walked back into the room, wearing only a robe.  She took a moment to close the curtains and made certain that no one could look in.  Once everything was secure, she turned towards both Trevor and Melissa before untying her robe, lifting it off of her shoulders, and letting it fall to the ground.  Both of them looked at Erma naked before them.  All Melissa could do is stare while Trevor looked a bit away.  It was something he&#39;s seen before, and it really didn&#39;t interest him to see his mother naked.  Melissa, on the other hand, marveled at the woman before her.  The first thing she noticed that her breasts were indeed as big as they said they were.  The breasts could have easily been an F-cup or even a G-cup.  Yet, despite their size, they didn&#39;t sag or droop, and they didn&#39;t look out of place on Irma&#39;s body.  Melissa also noticed just how muscular Erma was.  While Erma wouldn&#39;t be confused as a body-builder, she had well-defined muscles all throughout her body, from her arms and legs to her stomach and even her chest, supporting her rather large breasts.  Yet, despite all these muscles, she still retained a feminine shape, with a narrow waist and wide hips, similar to what Melissa&#39;s seen in other girls.<br />
<br />
Melissa didn&#39;t have to wait long for Irma to start to change as orange and white fur started to appear all around her body.  Her normally brown hair on her head and between her legs was replaced with orange and white fur.  Her fingernails were replaced with something similar to black hooves, although she still retained her normal fingers.  Her feet balled up and were replaced with hooves, though.  Erma&#39;s entire body grew larger overall, with even more muscle.  Her breasts grew even larger, and her nipples jutted out a few inches.  Her face started to change as her nose and mouth pushed out to form a muzzle.  Her ears flared out of the side of her head, and two horns grew out.  Her horns went out about the span of her arms, and were almost scraping the ceiling.  A cow&#39;s tail formed at the top of her butt, and grew out towards her knees.  Once Erma was finished changing, she spun around, showing herself to Melissa.  &quot;Well, what do you think?&quot; Erma asked with a slightly deeper voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...&quot; she hesitated before she asked, &quot;May I?&quot;  Erma nodded her head and invited Melissa to approach and feel.  Melissa got up from the couch and started to put her hands on Erma&#39;s body.  Melissa started with the hands and arms.  She noted that although Erma&#39;s fingernails were hoove-like, her fingers still functioned normally.  Melissa then felt up Erma&#39;s arm and shoulder.  She noted how muscular Erma was for a woman.  She then felt Erma&#39;s breasts and lifted to feel them.  She also felt her nipples, and accidently pulled on them a little, causing Erma to moo.  &quot;Sorry,&quot; Melissa said quietly with a bit of an eep and then Erma smiled and nodded, allowing Melissa to continue.  Melissa then felt down to Erma&#39;s stomach.  She could feel Erma&#39;s abs and muscles underneath her fur, but no sign of any udder which made Melissa a bit relieved.  Melissa also noticed the cleft between Erma&#39;s legs.  Of all the things on Erma&#39;s body, that had to be one of the most human-like features on her.  Satisfied with that, Melissa when up on Erma&#39;s body, examing Erma&#39;s face.  Melissa noticed that the mouth and jaw pushed out of Erma&#39;s face, with Erma&#39;s nose flared out to match.  She also noticed that Erma&#39;s ears were flared out, and they twitched when Melissa touched them.  Finally, Melissa rubbed Erma&#39;s horns, which were very similar to bone as far as she could tell.  Melissa wondered how they grew out and how they came back in.  Once Melissa was satisfied looking at Erma, she took a step back.<br />
<br />
Erma smiled at Melissa and asked, &quot;Satisfied?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa smiled and nodded, adding, &quot;Yes, this answers most of my concerns.  This has been very helpful for me.&quot;  It was at that point that the clock in the room starting to ring, indicating that it was five o&#39;clock.  &quot;Ah, my dad&#39;s probably waiting for me.  I need to get back home.&quot;  She turned towards Trevor and said, &quot;Could you take me home, please?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor got up from the couch and said, &quot;No problem, Mel.  Just grab your stuff and we can get out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa smiled at Trevor and said, &quot;Thanks.&quot;  She turned towards Erma and said, &quot;And thank you for talking with me.  It&#39;s been really helpful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erma, who was starting to change back to her normal human form, smiled and said, &quot;No problem, dear.  If there&#39;s anything else that I could answer, don&#39;t hesitate to ask.&quot;  The two shared a brief hug before Melissa followed Trevor out through the door.  Erma picked the robe up off of the ground before sighing to herself and saying, &quot;I hope she and Trevor will be happy together.&quot;</p>
