<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She had to get up early, the kids had to get to school. Before the sun even peaked over the horizon, Lauren Mitchell got her ass up before her alarm and got to work. She was by no means fat, but having to keep a strict diet with three kids was not happening for her, especially with her youngest having so many food allergies. She teetered close to 200 lbs, but most of her fat was distributed evenly across her body. She wasn’t weak by any means, but a layer of fat covered her strong, working-mother muscles. Her long, red hair reached down to her back and was tied in a ponytail. Grabbing packs of bacon out of the fridge, she began laying it on a pan as she got put ingredients for pancakes. She had long since abandoned the idea of waking the kids up by knocking on their door and touching them, preferring the “smell of breakfast breaking their slumber” method. Almost immediately as she finished mixing the dough, she turned on the stove and let the pan get hot, she already heard some stirring in the bedrooms. She poured some batter on the hot pan and let it sit for a minute as she grabbed the bacon out of the oven. The smell of meat seemed to stir almost everyone awake as her youngest baby showed up first, saying, “Time for breakfast!” He was a softie, a sweet little angel, and starting his first day of third grade today. Lauren giggled at her baby boy, he was just too cute sometimes. “I figured I would make yours first bud, no eggs, no gluten, and syrup with low sugar.” She passed him the special syrup as she handed him a plate with pancakes and bacon on it. In comes the middle child, with a whole lot of angst and hair dyed black and acne. “You done with Rudy’s pancakes yet? I’m starving.” Lauren shook her head, grabbing the other batter bowl and pouring it in the hot pan. “I don’t know why you’re so grumpy, the day just started Kurt. Please tell me you’re going to shower before you go to school today. I do not want to hear it from your teachers again that someone looks like their mother doesn’t take care of them.” Kurt just huffed, trying to ignore his mother. “And I told you to call me Kaos, my darkness needs to be eternal.” Lauren shut him down immediately, “I’m going to call you by your baby name in front of all your friends if you don’t shower before school, do you understand me?” Rudy giggled at his brother, no one taking him seriously this early in the morning. With that he sighed, grabbed a plate, and sat in the corner, pouting and eating. Finally, the last child walked into the kitchen, greeting her brothers and walking over to her mother. “Morning mom, smells great!” Lauren hugged her daughter as she made her plate, “Well, 2 out of 3 ain’t bad. I need you to help me with a few things when you get home today, ok Allison?” She kissed her mother before sitting beside Rudy and eating her breakfast. Allison had gotten most of her father’s genes, having reddish brown hair, clear skin, green eyes, and a great ass. Lauren was surprised that her daughter had her father’s ass, but it was one of the things that attracted her to him before they divorced. Allison was a very fit girl, having a good amount of tone to her body, and although not very defined muscles, there wasn’t a lot of fat on her body. Lauren loved her kids, and was glad they came to respect and love her more than their deadbeat dad that left after he had fallen in trouble gambling. They all finished eating as they got up from the table, putting their dishes in the sink. “Alright everyone, don’t miss the bus! I’ll wash the dishes.” Her kids went off as she filled the sink and started washing the dishes. She had some work to do before they got home and wanted to make sure they got there and back safe, she did care about her kids. Lauren checked Kurt to make sure he bathed, and after passing the sniff check, she waved goodbye as she watched her kids walk to the bus stop. <br />
<br />
With the kids gone, she decided to start her day by grabbing the mail. When she opened the door to her mailbox, she was struck with a bolt of green lightning, causing her to lose consciousness and drop the mail on the ground. While she was unconscious, her body started changing. Her skin changed to fur as her stomach started to swell. Her face turned into a maw as her nose and mouth were pushed out, her teeth getting sharper, and her feet turning into paw pads. Her body also became more voluptuous as her boobs and butt grew, making her burst out of her clothes. A tail shot out from her spine as her hands developed claws (although stayed mostly human). Her neck then developed lumps as two extra heads appeared on either side, anchored by her expanded shoulders. <br />
<br />
When Lauren woke up, she found herself laying on the ground in front of her mailbox, covered in fur and completely naked. She was also massive compared to previously, as she ran back to her house, abandoning the mail on the ground. She was now taller than her doorway, and much wider than it too. She felt like she was near 500lbs, if not over. She felt heavy, she thought she turned into some kind of beast, as she heard, “Mmmm… a damn sexy beast too.” She turned and saw another head that looked just like hers but a dog and had a light panic attack. She had all these new feeling and the extra heads didn’t help her calm down.</p>
