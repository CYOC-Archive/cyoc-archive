<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sally and Max were roommates living in the same apartment, they didn&#39;t get along as the only reason they lived together was because their college assigned it to them, Sally was the intelligent and organized student that was the example to follow for a lot of people, Max in the other side barely passed his subjects and spent all his day playing videogames and jerking off locked in his room while Sally hears him sometimes. Sally was also an unbirther but has never used her powers because she didn&#39;t find it very necessary, Max knew that and fantasized with that being the biggest of his fetishes, there were a couple of times that he asked to Sally to unbirth him and always received a big no. <br />
<br />
One day Sally after being a few days in her friend&#39;s house she came to the apartment and saw a complete mess, that was the moment when she couldn&#39;t stand Max anymore and screamed his name, &quot;Wassup Sal?&quot; he appeared leaving his room in only his underwear and a shirt, &quot;You know that a while ago I would get you out of here but the University doesn&#39;t let me, don&#39;t you&quot; she angrily said, &quot;C&#39;mon Sal, we can clean this very quickly&quot;, &quot;We? Don&#39;t expect me to clean the shit that you did here&quot;, &quot;Aw Sally please, you know that I can&#39;t do this alone&quot;, that moment Sally realised that she needed to play dumb to make Max pay attention to her, &quot;Let&#39;s make a bet, we&#39;re gonna play that racing game you have, if I win you&#39;ll clean all the apartment for 1 month, if you win choose whatever you want&quot;, &quot;Ooooh, I like how it sounds, as I will definitely win, I&#39;ll... Oh, you&#39;re going to unbirth me for some hours&quot;, Sally rolled her eyes and accepted, she was very confident since she was an expert in racing games in school, so they selected the game and started to play. They were just starting and Sally already had the 1st place overcoming Max by far, &quot;wow, you&#39;re such a pro, but it won&#39;t be for too long&quot; as Max talked Sally didn&#39;t pay attention to him, she felt that was playing with a little kid trying to make her lose just by talking, they were in the last lap and somehow just by pure luck Max was behind Sally, then he started to talk again to try to piss her off &quot;Oh man, it will be so awesome being inside a girl&#39;s womb, at least I&#39;m not a baby so it would be so boring to start my life again&quot;, Sally had a great idea, if she let Max win she could regress him, but taking care of a baby wasn&#39;t in her plans, so she thought something even better losing on purpose acting like she was surprised. &quot;HA! I told you, now spread that legs girl&quot;, &quot;Fine, you won&quot; she boringly took of her pants and panties exposing her vagina to Max, &quot;Man I can&#39;t believe that this is real, here we go&quot; he said taking off all of his clothes until being naked in front of Sally, then he slowly started to introduce his hands inside of her pussy, eventually he entered all the way inside Sally&#39;s reproductive track and reached her womb, Max couldn&#39;t move or talk, but he felt extremely warm and comfortable there, then Sally began her secret plan. A umbilical cord appeared inside her and attached to Max&#39;s bellybutton, as it was the reversed process of birth the umbilical cord started to extract all the nutrients from him, he couldn&#39;t scream or do anything against that since Sally was in control of everything happening inside her, the time passed and Max was only a kid, the nutrients Sally absorbed from him made her body mature and sexier, making her breasts and ass bigger, at some point she thought in leaving him as a baby, but as she didn&#39;t want any children she planned to regress him into a little egg inside her, she wouldn&#39;t only get rid of him, but also she could lie to the university about he leaving to an unknown place since the unbirth was only a myth, Max told his online friends about Sally being an unbirther but no one trusted him as she never unbirthed someone.<br />
<br />
The process finished and Max turned into a small cell that went to Sally&#39;s ovaries, she passed by the mirror and looked her appearance, she looked like a young version of a milf, her breasts grew at the point her shirt was thightening her chest, she took off her shirt and admired her new naked body, she thought about Max for a second and realized that he wouldn&#39;t bother her more, she massaged her belly and talked to it &quot;Oh Max, you should be happy of being carried inside of one of the most intelligents students in our college, but know you don&#39;t need to worry about anything, your thoughts are gone, and your life will be at risk since I lost several eggs monthly with my period haha, it must suck to be you right know, I know that you can&#39;t understand anything I&#39;m saying since you&#39;re just a mindless cell, but enjoy being there until I had sex without condom, probably you&#39;re not going to be there when that happens&quot; she grinned and dressed with Max&#39;s clothes as he was bigger than her and now his clothes fitted her, after being completely dressed she happily started to clean the mess in her apartment.</p>

What should do Sally after that?</h3>
