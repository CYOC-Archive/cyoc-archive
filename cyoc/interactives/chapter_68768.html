<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen thought about it her body was was not solid enough to climb the grates she knew that her only options were to wait for them to come down or transform and go get them herself. Thinking about it she thought it would be to risky to turn into someone and get them, they could run away and she might not get them. she decided she was going to just wait for them to finish up and pick them off as they were leaving.<br />
<br />
She sat under the bottom grate and waited the only thing she heard was the two of them moaning in pleasure inside the tube. Finally after what seemed like hours they stopped humping each other the moaning stopped, excitedly Jen got ready to catch them. But found they weren’t moving they were just siting in the tube giggling and whispering. It was so frustrating to Jen she was ready for them but they were still just out of her reach.<br />
<br />
Then it hit her she needed to lure them down, but how?<br />
<br />
As she looked around she noticed the swings close by. She slowly formed a tentacle out of her slime and slid it towards one of the swings. She noticed that the further away the tentacle moved from her body the more resistance she felt, it was like her slime was elastic. With much more effort then she would have thought she made it to the swing. Lifting the tentacle off the ground like a snake she pushed the swing causing it to shake and the chain to jingle. Than immediately let the tentacle relax quickly pulling itself back to her like a rubber band.<br />
<br />
Soon she herd movement above her and saw both the teens emerge slowly from the tube to see who was there.<br />
<br />
The girl looked at the swing genitally swaying and said “Bobby, do you see anyone?”<br />
<br />
“No katie, I don't see anyone it's probably just some little shit playing a joke on us or something.” the boy responded.<br />
<br />
They slowly made around the play structure looking for someone or something to move. To tease them some more Jen formed a tentacle again and slide it over to the slide they were standing above and tapped it as hard as she could. She could see both the teens jump at that.<br />
<br />
The girl grabbed on to the boys arm and said “bobby lets get out of here this place is starting to scare me.”<br />
<br />
bobby looked down into her scared eyes and then yelled to no one “show yourself you cowards. You are scaring my girl and I wont allow that. Come out and fight me like a man.”<br />
<br />
Jen could see they were both shaken up the boy was just acting strong they couldn't do anything. There was a fireman pole right next to the two she slowly slide across the ground to get closer just incase they tried running.<br />
<br />
This time she tried to form two tentacles it was a little harder but manageable. With some getting used to she was able to move them clumsy in different directions, the one she focused the most on was one she slithered up the pole careful not to make a sound. The other she moved to the other side where she was planning on banging on the metal support pipe. She found as she was about &frac34; the way up the pole she was at her limit she couldn't stretch anymore.<br />
<br />
Worried her pray would begin moving she pulled the second tentacle in fast and then focused on climbing the pole as fast as she could.<br />
<br />
Finally she was within reach of there legs quickly she rapped her tentacle around the girls leg without touching it just yet. It was kind of like a lasso. When suddenly they saw something, it was movement in a bush in the distance. Just as the girl was about to take a step Jen tightened her lasso around the girls leg.<br />
<br />
With a scream Jen felt a pull from the girl and felt her soft hands grabbing at the slime rapped tightly around the girls ankle, swiftly Jen pulled down causing the girl to fall over. She was screaming at the top of her lungs it wouldn't be long before someone heard the screams and came running.<br />
<br />
Katie was crying the slime with about the consistency of snot was tightly rapped around her leg and no matter how hard she tried she couldn't get a grip on it to take it off. Then it began pulling her a swift jerk and she lost her balance and fell backwards. Now it seemed like there was constant resistance on her leg and it was pulling her closer to the edge of the play structure. Her boyfriend bobby was grabbing onto her arm pulling as hard as he could to keep her from falling. With her other hand she grabbed the grate and held like her life depended on it.<br />
<br />
Jen found she couldn't pull her down any more she was holding on to tight. And still screaming. Knowing she had already caught the girl she began pulling herself towards Katie. Quickly sliding up the pole and onto her body. Now that Jen was already here she wanted to try something new just to see if it would work. She formed the tentacle she had become so proud of and slung it towards Katie's face slapping her mouth and leaving enough residue that she couldn't scream. Now that it was quiet she stretched her body around the girl like a cocoon. And resisted the urge to absorb her. Tired from this act she noticed she had the hand of the boy caught in the cocoon. He tried running but was trapped. Knowing he couldn't get away on his own he began yelling for help. Just like with the girl Jen slapped his mouth and gagged him. Then proceeded to ensnare him in the cocoon as well.<br />
<br />
Slowly she stretched her body around the boy, once she was complete she noticed how tired she was. She was practically panting from this. Next she began trying to transform, it wasn't going to happen she just couldn't muster up the strength to transform that is when she herd...</p>
