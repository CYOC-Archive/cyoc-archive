<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim's mind raced... Supergirl? He was supposed to be Supergirl? How was that even possible? Supergirl was a <br />
fictional character. So was Superman. So were all these people. Yet there he was, in Supergirl's uniform, <br />
looking up at the towering figure of Superman, and surrounded by the rest of the Justice League. It was <br />
insane. Then again, was it any stranger than the fact that he had been turned by magic--magic!--into two other <br />
people over the last couple of hours?<br />
<br />
Yes. Yes, it really was.<br />
<br />
He had more immediate concerns, though. Tim looked up nervously at Superman... how could he have known that <br />
Tim wasn't really Supergirl, when the other members of the Justice League didn't seem to notice? Was it <br />
something to do with his powers, perhaps? Was he able to use his X-ray vision to see through the spell that <br />
made Tim look like Kara to everyone else? No, Superman was notoriously vulnerable to magic, so if anything, he <br />
should have had a harder time seeing through the spell that had turned Tim into Supergirl. Had he sensed <br />
something odd in Tim's behavior, then, that made it clear that Tim was't Kara?<br />
<br />
Tim was about to respond when he realized that Superman hadn't spoken to him in English... he'd spoken in a <br />
strange language that he'd never heard before, but that he'd somehow been able to understand effortlessly. It <br />
must have been Kryptonian, he realized... and just as he had been able to speak and understand Japanese as <br />
Mika, so was he able to speak and understand Kryptonian as Kara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I'm Kara, Cl... Kal,&quot; Tim said, speaking fluently and effortlessly in Kryptonian. &quot;I swear. I...&quot; <br />
He cleared his throat. His voice sounded strange... small, thin, high-pitched, even. Almost like...<br />
<br />
Wait. The spell. The spell Paul had cast. Tim remembered now. It wasn't just supposed to make him switch <br />
bodies with someone, like the spell that had switched him with Mika. It was supposed to make him switch <br />
BODIES. Turning his eyes slowly downward, Tim looked in amazement at his body... his very curvy, very FEMALE <br />
body. He didn't just have Supergirl's identity... he had her body!<br />
<br />
Tim was shocked. He needed some time to take this in, to wrap his mind around being in a girl's body, much <br />
less the body of a Kryptonian girl. But he had a more pressing concern for the moment. He had a very confused, <br />
astoundingly powerful Superman standing over him... and while Tim was perhaps as powerful as Superman in this <br />
body, he had no desire to anger the Man of freaking Steel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kal, it's me,&quot; Tim said, looking back up at a skeptical Superman. Luckily, Tim, as an avid comic book fan, <br />
had an encyclopedic knowledge of Superman's world to draw on. &quot;It's Kara, your cousin. I swear. Ask me <br />
anything. Ask me about Lois. Ask me about Ma and Pa. Ask me about Lana. Ask me about Conner. Ask me about...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe you,&quot; Superman said. He sighed. &quot;I'm sorry, Kara, I just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were worried about me,&quot; Tim said. &quot;It's very sweet. But you don't need to... I'm a big b.. girl.&quot; He gave <br />
Superman a hug. Tim was not normally a hugger; he found affection pretty awkward. But he had an act to pull <br />
off, and he knew he needed to pull it off well. He had enough to deal with, what with being in another body <br />
and a whole other reality. The last thing he needed right now was a suspicious Justice League.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; Tim said, &quot;that fight took a lot out of me. I need to clear my head. Do you think the League can take <br />
care of Granny over there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Superman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Kal,&quot; Tim said. &quot;You're the best.&quot; And then, on an impulse, he stood up on his tiptoes and kissed <br />
Superman on the cheek. He immediately felt the need to scrub his lips--Tim wasn't gay in the slightest, and <br />
the thought of kissing a man, even on the cheek, felt a little creepy--but it was a perfect final touch for <br />
his act.<br />
<br />
Turning, Tim started walking away. He had no idea where he was going; he just wanted to get some distance from <br />
the superheroes so he could take stock. After he'd taken a few steps, though, he heard a voice say, &quot;Why isn't <br />
she flying?&quot; It was a whisper, and he could hear it as clearly as if it had been whispered in his own ear, but <br />
Tim could tell it was some distance away. Was this super-hearing? It must have been.<br />
<br />
And if Tim had super-hearing, and if he'd survived a plummet to earth, and if he'd punched a six-foot hole in <br />
the ground, he probably had the rest of Kara's powers as well. He wondered how on earth he could fly... but <br />
suddenly he realized he knew. He instinctively knew, just as he'd known how to speak Kryptonian, and Japanese <br />
before that. And so he willed himself off the ground... and found himself lifting up into the sky, slowly at <br />
first, then faster and faster, until he was high over the Metropolis skyline. He felt breathless... this was <br />
incredible!<br />
<br />
As he slowed to a stop, Tim felt a breeze blow across his legs, and suddenly he remembered he was in a girl's <br />
body. Looking down at his body--and trying to fight the sense of vertigo and fear he felt at seeing the ground <br />
a mile below his feet--he took in the sight that greeted him. He was dressed in what he recognized as the <br />
costume of the modern Supergirl: a skin-tight, long-sleeved shirt that ended just a couple of inches below his <br />
breasts and several above his belly button, and a tiny blue skirt that stopped well above his knees. A red <br />
cape flapped in the breeze around him, and a pair of red boots completed the look. The outfit was not modest, <br />
not at all, and it displayed his new body very, very well.<br />
<br />
And what a body it was! Tim's breasts pressed tight against the fabric of his shirt, and they looked enormous <br />
to him... as a woman in a comic book, what else could he expect? Of course, it could have just been a trick of <br />
angles... after all, Tim had never seen breasts from this angle before, and he'd rarely seen them from this <br />
close. On the other hand, Power Girl was supposed to be a grown-up version of Supergirl, and she was infamous <br />
for having the biggest boobs in the comic book biz, so maybe Tim's breasts really were as large as they <br />
seemed. Beneath his breasts, Tim saw the soft, smooth skin and luscious curves of a very beautiful girl, <br />
curves he would have lusted furiously after if he'd still been in his own body. His waist was narrow, his hips <br />
were shapely without being heavy, and his legs were long and smooth. Kara had a slender figure; she was <br />
perhaps the most powerful female on earth, but she had the figure of an actress or a pop star, not of a <br />
bodybuilder or an athlete. Indeed, looking at his slender arms, at his delicate hands (whose fingernails were <br />
tipped with pink polish, he noted), Tim's body almost looked fragile. Maybe not as fragile as Tim's own reedy <br />
body, but close. It was amazing to think how much power he held in such a skinny, girly frame.<br />
<br />
To think that he, Tim, who had been such a weakling his entire life, now possessed such power. And to think <br />
that he, Tim, who was barely able to approach a girl, was in the body of such a beauty. It was astonishing. <br />
Tim felt the urge to strip off his shirt and skirt and explore his body further, but that was probably a bad <br />
idea while he was still in range of Superman's telescopic vision. And besides, he felt terribly exposed to the <br />
world, even here, well outside the clear gaze of anyone in the city... and his tiny outfit didn't help that.<br />
<br />
Tim brushed his long, windblown blonde hair out of his eyes and turned his face upward, toward the sun. He <br />
stared directly at the sun, in all its brilliant, blazing glory... he never could have done this as a human, <br />
but apparently one of the advantages of being a Kryptonian was that he could look directly at the sun without <br />
any harm. The sun looked amazing, looking at it like this... and it felt even more incredible. Tim had always <br />
been the stereotypical pasty-faced geek, shunning the sun for the comforts of the indoors; the sun tended to <br />
feel harsh and bright when he stepped outside. But now, the sunlight felt... amazing. Invigorating. <br />
Empowering. Almost intoxicating. Of course it did... Kara's body was essentially solar-powered. It felt like <br />
the sunlight was washing away all the shock and confusion he'd felt a few minutes before, when he'd landed in <br />
Kara's body. It was burning away all the weakness, all the awkwardness, all the shyness, all the fear he had <br />
ever felt, leaving in its place pure, absolute, unbridled power. Tim had never felt anything like this, and he <br />
never wanted it to go away.<br />
<br />
Of course, if he wanted to return to his own body, he would have to give up this feeling, and all of Kara's <br />
powers, and all the opportunities that came with them. It meant giving up the opportunity to meet and befriend <br />
all his favorite heroes, too, and a life of real, cosmic meaning, a life he could spend helping people and <br />
saving the world. He'd dreamed all his life of being a superhero, and now his dream had come true, even if it <br />
wasn't eactly as he'd imagined it. He wasn't sure he wanted to give this all up and return to his mediocre <br />
life.<br />
<br />
Tim wasn't keen on giving up his old life completely, of course, lame as it had been... and he certainly <br />
didn't want to spend the rest of his life as a girl. Tim wasn't sure exactly how he was supposed to return to <br />
his own body, but he was sure he had options. He could wait for Paul to find a reversal spell, of course, or <br />
he could try to track down Zatanna or one of the other numerous spellcasters in the DCU and ask them for help. <br />
But did he really want to switch back? Maybe being a girl and abandoning his old life were small prices to pay <br />
for being one of the most powerful beings in the world.</p>
