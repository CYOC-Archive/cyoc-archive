<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie gazed at her sisters house apprehensively, to say she was nervous would be an understatement. Although she had been able to reconnect with both Ann and Lisa (including a fun weekend with Ann and Jackie in her timeline) she was worried about returning here and seeing her mother, Marilyn O’Toole.<br />
<br />
“You okay Kellie,” teen Katie asked. Kellie looked at her friend, giving the girl a reassuring smile. “Yeah just nervous,” she sighed. “My mother is going to be here today. She still doesn’t know I’m alive in another timeline.”<br />
<br />
“Things will be fine,” Teen Lisa said. “Although I do want to ask, why did you invite me and Katie?”<br />
<br />
“Well you two are family,” Kellie said. “Besides, you two helped in taking down Morgan LeFay. Don’t forget that technically speaking your distant relatives to the O’Tooles. Besides, I think Lisa will be really happy to see you two, after all she seemed to like you Lisa.”<br />
<br />
Teen Lisa shrugged as she gazed at the house. She and her twin had been pleasantly surprised when Kellie asked them to accompany her to Lisa’s babyshower. While neither girl had ever been to a babyshower before they were intrigued. Secretly Lisa was interested in meeting Kellies mother after hearing that the woman greatly resembled her own deceased mother. “So,” she said quietly. “What exactly happens at one of these things? Me and Katie have never been to a babyshower before.”<br />
<br />
“Well we eat,have some drinks, and watch the mother to be open some gifts,” Kellie stated. “To be honest it’s kind of a boring party. Not really a lot of fun so if you think it’s going to be like some of the parties you’ve been to in high school your sadly mistaken.”<br />
<br />
Lisa and Katie smirked at one another before turning back to Kellie. “We kind of figured,” Katie grinned. “But it should be fun anyway. Besides, it will give us a chance to see everyone, haven’t had a chance to catch up since the whole fight with Morgan.”<br />
<br />
“One question though,” Katie asked. “Are we changing our ages? I mean it could be kind of weird their being two adult Katie and Lisa’s.”<br />
<br />
“Actually,” Kellie said. “Was only going to change myself. Hope that’s okay.”<br />
<br />
Lisa and Katie nodded, silently seeming to give Kellie permission that agreeing herself up while leaving them teens would be okay. Smiling Kellie thanked them before making a wish to become 45.<br />
<br />
Kellies ring glowed as she began to age. The teens watched as Kellie raced through high school and entered high school. The teens curves increased while her face began to mature, becoming more angular. Soon a college age woman with honey blond hair, CC cup breasts, and full curves stood before the teens.<br />
<br />
Kellie continued to age through her twenties, her face continueing to mature giving her a more mature appearance. As the woman now became 30 she ran her hands over her growing body. Kellies curves were now at their fullest, while her waist remained trim. Glancing at her breasts Kellie couldn’t help but give a small smile as she noticed they remained perky, despite their fullness. This began to change as she aged into her thirties.<br />
<br />
Crossing the threshold of 30 Kellie began to see her body mature more. Slowly but surely Kellie watched as a slight droop began to appear on her breasts. While still full they were losing the perkiness of youth becoming the breast of an adult woman. A small frown appeared in Kellies face as she noticed her hips and waist increasing in size. While not fat by any stretch of the imagination she could see that like many women in their thirties, she had put on a little weight giving her a full and mature figure.<br />
<br />
“You know,” Kellie smirked. “The worse part about aging into adulthood is realizing just how skinny you are as a teen. Feel like I need to hit the gym or go on a diet.” Katie and Lisa laughed softly as they watched their friend continue to age. “Kel you look Fine,” Katie giggled. “Now stop worrying okay?”<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed and nodded as she continued to age. As she crossed the bridge from 30 to 40 she could see her curves beginning to soften as her honey blond hair seemed to lose some of its shine. Glancing in a compact mirror she frowned as she noticed fine lines appearing around her eyes. As her progression completed Kellie looked over her 45 year old body.<br />
<br />
Kellie was now a beautiful and mature woman of 45 with shoulder length honey blond hair and a curvy, mature body. Small lines around her eyes and a little extra weight sat on the woman’s hips and waist. Despite these small imperfections both Katie and Lisa assured their friend that she looked fantastic. “Thanks guys I appreciate that,” she smiled. As the three now approached the house,mthey took a deep breath before knocking. As the door opened Kellie could only smile as she looked at her very pregnant little sister. “Hey sis thanks for inviting us.”<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled, hugging her sister and her friends before inviting them in. “So glad you three could come,” Lisa said happily. “Almost everyone is here. Come in and make yourself at home.”<br />
<br />
“Your sure Things will be okay with us being here,” teen Katie asked. “I mean technically there’s two Lisa’s and two Katie’s present.”<br />
<br />
“If anyone asks you two are cousins of mine,” Adult Lisa said. “Right now most people know what’s going on with the other timeline. Only a couple people from work and Maddie Haskins don’t know about you three. Still, I wouldn’t worry too much. Right now everyone is oooing and ahhhing over Katie and Kellies daughter Morgan.”<br />
<br />
Kellie and her friends turned to where Adult Lisa was pointing, noticing the majority of the women present were clamoring to gaze at the tiny newborn cradled in Katie’s arms. The baby seemed to age at everyone curiously with crystal blue eyes with whispy  blond hair. Kellie couldn’t help but feel a bit of motherly pride as she saw her daughter hold her adopted daughter.<br />
<br />
“Yeah Katie seems to be a natural,” adult Lisa stated with pride. Kellie nodded as she continued to watch Katie. “Seems like it,” she smiled. “Which reminds me, has mom shown up yet?”<br />
<br />
“Not yet,” adult Lisa said. “She should be here soon. Hope things go well though, Ann hasn’t been helping to calm me down though, she keeps biting her nails. It’s only making me more nervous.” Kellie laughed as she now thought of her middle sister and her tendency to bite her nails whenever she was nervous. “Some things never change,” she laughed.<br />
<br />
As the two sister ps now began to talk they tried to formulate a plan on how to reintroduce Kellie to her mother. Marilyn O’Toole May have knowledge of magic but she was about to be introduced to something that even Lisa and the others were barely able to grasp. Hopefully over the next few hours the sisters would be able to reconnect with their mother.</p>
