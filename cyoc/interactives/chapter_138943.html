<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That day, Mike rubbed his son&#39;s bloated belly as the little cub snuggled into his gigantic form. With Jeff drifting fast asleep, his body absorbing Mike&#39;s seed as nourishment, the giant king of beasts stood and made his way to the computer, his gargantuan cubmaker slapping lewdly against thighs that would put a bull elephant&#39;s to shame. He closed the application and unhooked the Chronivac machine; there was no way he was going to let his little cub make changes to their arrangement. The new Mike liked his new body, no way he&#39;d let little Jeff outdo him. And as the head male of his little pride, there was no way he&#39;d let anything happen to the cubs on the way...<br />
<br />
As Mike made his way out of Jeff&#39;s room, he realized that reality had subtly shifted all around him. The hallways were wider, the floors were slightly rubberized, suited for his clawed feet in the way that carpet and hardwood would not. As he moved into the washroom, he noticed the toilet and sink were much larger, specially made for his immense body. He smirked as he looked at what looked like an oversized hand dryer sticking out of the wall, a fur dryer he surmised, as he took a massive whiz, the sound like a waterfall.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d thought his house wouldn&#39;t be able to handle him, but on the contrary, the machine had altered reality to fit him. The floor barely creaked, though the house did shudder, as he descended the stairs. The massive cat dad purred lowly as he looked into his living room, or what had been the living room. Mike&#39;s massive physique didn&#39;t build itself and reality reflected that. A massive home gym, both upscaled in size and breadth in machines, had replaced the once cozy living room. The wall separating the living room and the kitchen had been knocked down, giving easy access to a wall of fridges for a massive beast after he pumped his body. Hell, even the floor had a drain in it, and Mike just flashed a toothy smirk, knowing exactly why as he squeezed at his fuzzy balls.<br />
<br />
The giant man-beast decided to give his new body a little test and put it through its paces. He worked out with a frenzy, pumping his body to its extremes and then pumping something else right after. The drains proved useful after all. Soon, The room was steaming with fresh and drying loads of cum and the iron hot, pumped lion massfreak at the centre of it all. Mike could barely move his body he was so bloated after working his body. He waddled over to the fridge and took out a raw whole chicken, devouring it whole. A more human Mike would&#39;ve recoiled at the though, but the new Mike was all beast.<br />
<br />
After hours of pumping his body and shaft, the lion was still horny. His lion&#39;s instinct to breed took over and he stomped up the stairs to Jeff&#39;s room once more. The little cub had awakened, nursing his full tummy. The small lion cub&#39;s eyes went wide as he looked up at his massive father, the giant&#39;s head brushing against the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Without a word, Jeff turned around and presented himself to his father and Mike accepted. Stroking himself to full thickness, Mike bred his son&#39;s hole over and over. His cockhead distended his son&#39;s stomach with each thrust and Jeff screamed, his own little prick dribbling a small thin stream of jizz. When Mike came, his massive balls pulled up and spewed so much cum into his son, the boy protested for his dad to stop. But Mike didn&#39;t. He roared, shaking the house and Jeff cough, blobules of Mike&#39;s seed sputtering out of his mouth. Another thrust and a volley of seed erupted from Jeff&#39;s mouth and nose. After he finished, he slipped out of Jeff&#39;s abused hole and patted the sleeping lion cub&#39;s head and kissed him goodnight.<br />
<br />
Everyday, Mike went through the same routine. He&#39;d fuck his puny son&#39;s ass or face in the morning and let the boy rest during the day. The lion was surprised to find his livelihood had also changed, rather than work his dead-end low-level accounting job, he&#39;d found wealthy patrons who&#39;d pay him exorbitant amounts of money just to feel his gargantuan, fur-covered bicep, creaming themselves when they did. He worked out in his home gym for hours and ate enough for 10 men right after before he&#39;d go back upstairs and breed his boy for hours before bed.<br />
<br />
By the second week, Mike was getting used to his new routine, but that morning something changed. As he entered his son&#39;s room, he could smell his heady musk in there, but it was mixed with son&#39;s. He pulled his son&#39;s sheets off and almost gasped. The boy&#39;s belly was still bloated from all the beast-spunk Mike had been pouring into him, but the cub&#39;s pubic area was covered in a dusting of reddish hair, dark thin curls running up his midline from his crotch to his sternum. Jeff&#39;s cock was rigid and to Mike&#39;s surprise, already starting to grow larger, at least a couple inches longer and thicker than it had been last week. His nearly non-existent balls were now the size of small eggs and a stream of pre-seed ran down his growing length. Jeff &#39;s eyes fluttered open and he looked up at his dad with a puzzled look.<br />
<br />
&quot;DaAaD?&quot; Jeff croaked, his voice cracking. It was as Mike suspected his cub was growing up. But how, and why so fast? As soon as the cub sat up, he got his answer. Jeff keeled over and began to dry-heave. &quot;Ungh, I feel sick,&quot; Jeff whined. Mike rubbed his son&#39;s stomach and gulped, Jeff&#39;s mom had been the same way when she was pregnant with him. Mike had wanted a pride of his own and the Chronivac provided the fertile grounds for him to plant his seed. But just as a female&#39;s pregnancy hormones provided the changes to allow a baby to thrive within the mother, Jeff&#39;s own hormones were fluctuating and changing, bringing changes of his own.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t fall asleep when Mike fucked his face this morning. Instead, he groggily made his way down and watched his dad workout all day, busting loads of his own as he slurped up his father&#39;s messes in the gym. When Mike went to the kitchen to feed, he found Jeff getting a little workout of his own. The huge lion smirked and decided to humour his kid. Jeff... was surprisingly strong for his puny size...<br />
<br />
A week later and Mike awoke to Jeff lapping up at his cock. &quot;I&#39;m hungry,&quot; the cub grunted, his belly already full, but he still wanted more. Mike wailed as Jeff&#39;s grip was way stronger than he remembered. Soon, Jeff was working in with him in the gym and practically begging for his dad to fuck him all the while. The cub had gotten taller and Mike could swear he could see definition in the boy&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
After a month, Mike was growing a little concerned. His boy&#39;s musk lent its own unique aroma around the house now, strong enough to cut through Mike&#39;s intense musk. He went to Jeff&#39;s room, only to see the boy not there, but could hear the clank of metal on metal through the air vents. He went downstairs to see Jeff on the bench press, working his chest. The boy had grown substantially. If it weren&#39;t for his massive belly, he&#39;d have the build of a college wrestler. A small mane dotted Jeff&#39;s neck and sideburns and his treasure trail was coming in thick. He stood a good 6&#39;2&quot; tall, and his cock had grown to an impressive 7&quot; in length, oozing long strings of pre-seed onto the leather of the bench.<br />
<br />
&quot;The hell are you doing, boy?&quot; Mike growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Working out, what&#39;s it look like?&quot; Jeff retorted. Defiance, that hadn&#39;t been there before. The young lion stud flexed his big arms, testosterone seeping through his every pore.<br />
<br />
&quot;You shouldn&#39;t push yourself so hard, the cubs-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-Need a stronger father,&quot; Jeff rumbled, rubbing his growing gut. Mike didn&#39;t know what to think and Jeff didn&#39;t give him much time to, the young lion devouring his father&#39;s length, hungry for Mike&#39;s life-giving seed.<br />
<br />
By five months, the dynamic between them had changed even further. Mike couldn&#39;t breed his son enough, his boy, his partner was insatiable. Jeff&#39;s mane had fully grown in, though, it wasn&#39;t quite as dense as Mike&#39;s just yet. The young stud was now built like a heavyweight bodybuilder and stood at an impressive 7&#39; in height. His musk was almost now just as potent as Mike&#39;s. His gut rumbled, signs of life stirring inside.<br />
<br />
One morning, Mike made his way down to see his son working out as usual. But a new development had taken place, Jeff was hunched over the counter, cupping his heavy pecs. He squeezed at his pectorals and a stream of creamy milk or what looked like it spurted out and into a shaker filled with various powders. The smaller lion smirked as his father stared at him. He shook the contents and gulped the contents down, giving a giant roar as he finished off the shake. Mike couldn&#39;t believe what he had just seen.<br />
<br />
At seven months pregnant, things were never the same. Jeff was just as big as Mike now, just as horny and just as strong. Save for his gigantic belly and his youthful visage, they could be mistaken for twins. Mike was now seriously beginning to regret his choice on the Chronivac... wait the machine!<br />
<br />
The giant lion stomped to the computer in Jeff&#39;s room, not caring that his growing son in the home gym would outclass him at the rate he was growing. He plugged the Chronivac back in and booted up the app. Jeff was never supposed to become a huge musclefreak like he did, he was supposed to stay a small, submissive cub who&#39;d please his every whim-<br />
<br />
Mike felt a strong hand on his shoulder and he was whipped around. He was face to face with his son. Jeff was so pumped, so strong. His son&#39;s strong hands wrapped around him and pulled Mike in for a powerful kiss. The two continued to make out on Jeff&#39;s reinforced bed, exploring each others bodies. Hours passed and for the first time, Mike made a powerful connection to his partner, their fingers interlaced as Jeff drifted off to sleep holding his belly, their offspring inside.<br />
<br />
Nine months after impregnating his son, Mike awoke and made his way to Jeff&#39;s room. The two had grown to love each other, the lion father feeling more for his son than he ever did for his wife. His shoulders now scraped against the ceiling. Jeff have been feeding him his pec-nectar and the nutritious fluid had fueled new growth in Mike. If he were to feed their children it, there was no telling how powerful their family would become...<br />
<br />
As he opened the door, his eyes went wide. An equally musclebound lion laid in his bed, his epic shaft seizing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;My water broke,&quot; Jeff whined, a flood of liquid pouring out of his engorged cock...</p>
