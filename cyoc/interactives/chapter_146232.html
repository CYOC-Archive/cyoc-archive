<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your first reaction to this all was shock and confusion.<br />
<br />
Such a change was impossible! Something like this couldn&#39;t happen, so why did it anyway?<br />
<br />
The news agencies, the press, journalists, they all pointed at the message that was spread across the globe, in many different languages, seven days ago. And that made perfect sense.<br />
<br />
Then there was a feeling of relief. It was a global change. After the initial shock wore off among the masses, people could reassess the situation. Already you saw on TV how police troops, military in cities even, took to the streets to create some order among the chaos of panicked people and irrational folk who just wouldn&#39;t accept these changes.<br />
<br />
You were mostly glad that you weren&#39;t the only one in the world who transformed into this hybrid of a human being.<br />
<br />
Technically, you were female now. Your cock had turned into a pussy, a snatch. And when the automatic lubrication and sensation of new muscles were correct, said snatch was fully functional as well, with a womb ready to produce babies.<br />
<br />
You doubted the latter would ever happen in your case, but that was what it was meant for anyway.<br />
<br />
These changes had already brought you some minor troubles.<br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t fit inside your men&#39;s trousers.<br />
<br />
The alternative also wasn&#39;t an option, since you couldn&#39;t get inside Stella&#39;s pants either. Instead of shrinking, your height remained the same, you were as tall as you used to be. Your legs hadn&#39;t gotten smaller, and because of that, Stella&#39;s pants were too short. Your own pants didn&#39;t fit because despite remaining as tall as before, the shape of your lower body still had changed in a feminine way. Your butt had become rounder, bubbly almost, while your thighs had gotten thicker. Trying on Stella&#39;s pants, you found that jumping up and down in an attempt to fit them did nothing more that shake your butt up and down, and said pants started tearing when your newly built thighs didn&#39;t play along.<br />
<br />
There were tight pants, and there were too tight pants. Stella looked a bit sad when you ruined one of her favorite pairs.<br />
<br />
So instead, you were stuck in the very same sweatpants you had worn when you went to sleep. They matched the length of your legs, and the fabric was elastic enough that you could fit inside them.<br />
<br />
However, currently you had only one pair of still slightly inappropriately fitting sweatpants, and they were still soaked with sweat and your own female juices, as a result of your unexpected changes.<br />
<br />
In the safety of your own home, you were walking around in a regular shirt, while wearing a pair of Stella&#39;s too tight panties -for hygienic reasons, she said-, waiting for the washing machine to wash all filth out of your only pair of properly fitting pants. It would take another hour, if the small clock on the dashboard was correct. Meanwhile, you would have to cope with exposing a large camel toe in the front of your crotch to your wife, because your new frame just didn&#39;t fit her smaller clothes.<br />
<br />
You sat down on the bench, crossing your legs out of embarrassment. Your wife was on her phone, staring at the screen with a stern expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;My sister has a cock now,&quot; Stella said. &quot;She suffered the same changes. I think the same thing happened to a couple of my co-workers. Hanna, for sure. She told me she had the same symptoms you had.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Amy? She was pregnant too, right?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Stella shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t think so. When she came online she asked everybody how they were doing, telling them she wished them the best. You too, for that matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, thanks. Any guys too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some guys came online to check on us. Some haven&#39;t been online since yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
You grinned. &quot;Figures.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella looked at you. &quot;How so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No guy wants to admit they lost their cock to a pussy. That&#39;s just fucked up.&quot; I let my hands stroke over the skin of my thighs. It was slightly more sensitive than it used to be. Pinpricks of pleasure emanated from my crotch, the closer I stroked to my pussy.<br />
<br />
Stella chuckled. &quot;Men and their stubbornness.&quot; She kissed you on the lips. &quot;You appear brave enough though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah! Trust me, I&#39;m in a safe haven right now. You&#39;re the only one who knows for now. Although I guess, when one of the guys fesses up, others follow pretty easily. Half of them changed anyway. That&#39;s at least seven out of the fifteen in my workplace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How does it feel?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It takes getting used to, obviously. It was all wet and hot down there, and I still haven&#39;t had a shower. I&#39;m feeling incredibly awkward about these sensations, like I&#39;m doing something taboo. In reality I can&#39;t really help it though. And I don&#39;t think I&#39;m really ready for what those changes mean over the long term. Concerning our relationship, for example.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella smiled, though you couldn&#39;t really read the expression she wore on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s sweet Andy. Do I need to be concerned when Stacy comes to visit?&quot;<br />
<br />
You grinned. &quot;That almost sounds rhetorical. No, let&#39;s figure this out together first.&quot; You reached behind her, and squeezed her butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may have lost my cock, but I can still speak French between your legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were getting aroused again. Stella leaned in for a kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about, when I&#39;m done with you, we take it easy? You need to finish my massage still.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your wife grinned. &quot;Only that? Wouldn&#39;t this be the ideal scenario for me to gain my first lesbian experience?&quot;</p>
