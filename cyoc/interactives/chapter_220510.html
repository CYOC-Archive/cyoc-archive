<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Enoch was a little miffed once he left the healing chambers. Sitting next to a resting Tarfeil he took advantage of the peace and quiet within the structure and used it to clear his head. Ever since the sword Light Bringer merged with Enoch; the wolf-taur has had a strong desire to try and sort out the jumble of images in his head. Memories of the past; a past he never experienced. There were images that did depict his father Lucifer Morningstar when he was Angelic. Enoch was so close to sorting things when a white skinned angel started shouting and threatening. Enoch knew the type; a bully who revels in lording over those who he thinks are weak.<br />
<br />
With his concentration interrupted; Enoch decided to check out the disturbance. The wolf-taur instantly recognized the Grand Inquisitor and rolled his eyes.<br />
‘So much for a quiet moment,’ he thought to himself as he confronted and proceeded to goad and shame Kusheil. But Enoch saw something off with the angel. He saw strings of energy attached to Kusheil as the angel tried to attack him. The strings were controlling Kusheil and whoever was controlling the angel like a puppeteer controls a marionette was clumsy with their attack. It took Enoch a few seconds to determine that Kusheil was a pawn; that he was all bark and no bite. So he decided to see how dropping his Uncle’s name to protect Tarfeil would cause a reaction as he left.<br />
<br />
‘Nothing,’ Enoch thought; ‘Still, Kusheil needs to be watched&#39;. Spreading his wings; Enoch tenses his fore and hind legs and takes off with a gust. The thrill of being in the air flying in nowhere particular was an exhilarating perk for becoming an angel. He now understands why his old sister Alecto and his baby sister Lamashtu always loved to fly versus using portal magic. It was a great feeling of freedom and it allowed you a chance to think. He could spend hours flying aimlessly, but Enoch spied a cherub that looked injured as it once again tried to penetrate this bubble of chaos he can see. Diving quickly he gets under the falling cherub and catches it. Landing on the ground Enoch removed his glasses to try and help the injured creature.<br />
<br />
Like with Tarfeil, a warm glow envelopes the Cherub and the chaos that has wounded the creature was quickly forced out. It tired him out as he used a lot of energy on Tarfiel just earlier, but he felt it was needed.<br />
“Maybe,” Enoch leaving his glasses off as he stares at the bubble; “I can start being that fly in the ointment by disrupting this bit of chaos. What do you think,” Enoch grinning as he looks at the cherub; “you want unrestricted skies again?”<br />
The cherub nods as it sees the kindly energies radiating from Enoch’s eyes.<br />
“Then keep a safe distance,” Enoch answering; “It seems this bubble is centered in the grand library.”<br />
<br />
**************************************<br />
<br />
Enoch stood at the entrance to the Grand Library; The seal of the grand inquisition glowed brightly as he examined the ward for anything dark.<br />
“Nothing chaotic about the ward,” Enoch mused; “just a standard lock, easy to pick.”<br />
“Don’t be so sure about that,” An angel in red robes landing to confront the wolf-taur.<br />
“Kusheil sent you,” Enoch recognizing the Inquisitorial robe; “veiled threats from someone who couldn’t intimidate a nightmare steed?”<br />
“No,” the angel displaying a friendly veneer; &quot;but I do deal with him. And his fits of rage,” the angel sighing. Forgive me where are my manners,” The angel offering a polite bow; “I am Semyaza how can I help the son of the devil.”<br />
“You know who I am,” Enoch looking at the angel with suspicion; “I’d assume name dropping Lucifer would put every Inquisitor into an apoplectic fit.”<br />
“Only the ones who are overly fond of the drink,” Semyaza making a chugging motion.<br />
“My Aunt Astaroth was like that,” Enoch recalling the horrible feeling he felt when she died; “she always got real mean when she was drunk.”<br />
“I heard she was a fierce warrior,” Semyaza offer sympathy.<br />
“Thank you,: Enoch nodding; “She was. But still,” Enoch looking at the ward and deftly bypassing it stunning Semyaza; “you choice of locks is childish.”<br />
<br />
“You should not be in here,”Semyaza pleading with the wolf-taur; “If Kusheil finds out.”<br />
“It’s not as if he is going to hate me anymore,” Enoch sighing as he take his glasses off to see the tendrils of energy about. &quot;I don’t think I’m ever going to get use to this,” Enoch sighing as he follows a random strand of energy.<br />
“Get use to what,” Semyaza showing curiosity towards the odd wolf-taur.<br />
“Being able to see various types of energy,” Enoch answering; “the glasses help filter it out when I need it to. But that is not their intended purpose.”<br />
“I take it the glasses are used to hide your unsettling eyes,” Semyaza picking up a random book that Kusheil’s men riffed through before tossing on the floor.<br />
“You noticed,” Enoch smirking; “What did you see when you saw my eyes?”<br />
“Life,” Semyaza speaking the truth, but hiding the fear over glimpsing the power the Enoch possesses; “raw and primal.”<br />
<br />
Enoch nods as he notices a strand of energy heading up to another level. It was different than the rest; this strand was black and radiating evil.<br />
“Found you,” Enoch leaping up and quickly using his wings to glide to the balcony.<br />
Semyaza quickly followed suit; having to flap his wings a bit more furiously. “you’re fast with thos wings of yours.&quot;<br />
“And I’ve only had them for a few hours,” Enoch staring at a Sitar; “and I found the source of the chaos bubble.” Enoch striking the instrument with his energy blade; “that should solve that issue. You should let Jehovah know I solved his chaos problem.&quot;<br />
“You may have found the source,” Semyaza looking glum as his favorite sitar was destroyed beyond repair; “but whose instrument was it?”<br />
“Most likely it belongs to someone who know how to play that cumbersome guitar,” Enoch staring at Semyaza; “Not many angel’s would know how to play it correct?”<br />
“Can’t argue that,” Semyaza thinking of a way to deflect this off the inquisition. “I hear it is difficult to learn,” Semyaza speaking quickly; “I myself tried once. Even dabble with a Theremin. You need at least three or four hands to operate that properly.”<br />
“Jimmy Page of Led Zepplin managed alright,” Enoch grinning; “saw him use it live in a Led Zepplin concert once. “<br />
<br />
Semyaza just shrugs his head; not wanting to continue this he tries to change the subject.<br />
“Do you intend to stay long,” Semyaza picking up the pieces of the broken Sitar; “The inquisition could always use an angel of your unique talents.”<br />
“I haven’t decided yet,” Enoch feeling the chaos bubble dissipating; “there is an apocalypse on the horizon and I got to try and stop it. So I won’t have a firm answer until after it has been stopped.”<br />
“Then what will you be doing until then,” Semyaza probing Enoch; but being friendly in a fashion.<br />
“First I got to keep a promise I just made to my uncle,” Enoch referring to redoing his angelic vows; “then I’m going to head back to hell and kick Nergal in his twig and berries for starting a civil war.”<br />
“Civil war in hell,” Semyaza pretending to be shocked; “does this mean your father is dead?”<br />
“No,” Enoch answering; not realizing he just gave an important piece of information to Beelzebub’s counterpart; “My Father and Mother are in hiding.”<br />
<br />
Semyaza watches Enoch jump off the balcony and fly out of the grand library. With his friendly demeanor vanishing into a cold icy glare; Semyaza slams the broken pieces of his sitar onto the floor. He is now forced to retool his plans to manipulate and control Kusheil all the while helping Beelzebub with his plans of summoning a true chaos being all the while trying to keep Enoch from sniffing about.<br />
&quot;I may have throw a bone or two to that welp,&quot; Semyaza seethes; &quot;just to keep him off my trail.&quot;</p>
