<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What? A cow?” Dan thought. His eyes popped open, going wide to the width of quarters. “A cow? Really!? She can’t do that!” But even as he tried to convince himself of that, he could still see his chest swelling with the growth of breasts, now well above a C cup and spilling towards a D that weighed heavily atop his chest, tugging on the smooth, weak muscles along his collarbones. He knew, though he didn’t want to admit it, that she could do anything. <br />
<br />
“Pregnant women should just be locked up at home so we don’t have to see them or their leaking tits. Once they are normal and thin they can rejoin the world-” Kat read from the forum, glaring down at Dan as her shadow cast over him, mockingly reminding him of his place, beneath her. <br />
<br />
“I think you should be locked up, Dan. Locked up back behind the house in the shed, waiting around for milking times. You’d start to look forward to them because it’d be the only time anyone pays any attention to you anymore.” She snickered, pacing around him. “You’d start to look forward to when you were leaking and dripping from your heavy tits because then someone would come visit you, if only to come empty you for our dinner’s drinks.” <br />
<br />
“I think he should spend some time as a big, fat cow... with a huge udder to provide crisp, fresh milk for the party guests.” Jan interjected, starting to pace slightly in front of him. “Maybe realizing what it feels like will provide some much needed perspective-” She shook her head. <br />
<br />
“Not that it matters, you’re too far gone for this to be a mission of change. This is just to teach you a lesson, Dan. About what you’re saying, what you’re insinuating. If you have so little respect for women as to call them cows, you should be a cow yourself. Have your udders dragging, kissing the ground with every step, full and dripping with milk.” As she spoke, describing these full, milky pink udders he could grow, his chest still swelled. Heft pulled on the skin of his chest, pulling out as they bulged into heavy breasts that heaved and wiggled with even just the power of his breathing. As he thrashed against the chair, testing the binds on his wrists and trying to ignore the mocking from his own mother, they waggled more, flopping their weight from side to side and jostling against his chest. The more he moved, the more they moved and reminded him of the changes happening to him now, these feminine organs swelling out from him as his sister and mom stood over and watched. <br />
<br />
“We can hire one of his little neighborhood friends to come do the milking. How would it feel to have Maddy come milk you dry? You’ve always wanted her to come touch your bits haven’t you?” Kat was snickering now beneath every breath. “Did you ever think the first time she touched your bare skin it’d be on your plump cow udders?” <br />
<br />
Dan’s eyes were wide, realizing that this was happening. They could actually make this happen. “God, that’d.... That’d be terrible...” He realized, picturing the attractive blonde girl with the plump lips he often fantasized about having over for more than a neighborhood barbeque. With the thought, his cock bare between his thigh twinged with a sudden rush of blood and excitement, starting to twitch to life there exposed. <br />
<br />
“Ooh, he likes that!” Kat pointed at his cock starting to stiffen and come to life atop his pale legs. Her fingered wiggled, mockingly pointing out his boner to his own mother who looked stricken with horror. His cheeks burned to have his mother and sister’s eyes on his junk as his cock twitched to life into a full, stiff boner jutting up between his thighs. Knowing that she could see him, watching his cock twitch to life there, he felt it partially wilt in response and shame, yet that shame seemed to fuel it standing right back up to life even still. <br />
<br />
Dan’s face was burning with heat, knowing that they were seeing his body’s reaction to her words and he couldn’t do anything to hide himself. His thighs squirmed, trying to squish himself enough to wilt his throbbing cock, but Kat’s giggling eyes already noticed him. “Oh my, Dan!” She laughed, covering her laughing lips. “Your tits are bigger than your dick! You could lose that pencil in those knockers!” <br />
<br />
“I-It’s not small!” He thought defensively, but he couldn’t see the tip of his dick anymore over the height of his swollen, growing breasts. They jutted out from his chest, rippling with every motion and breath he made down their bare, soft surface and covering his view of his crotch entirely. <br />
<br />
“Should we really make him a cow if he seems to like it?” Jan mused, looking unsure. “I don’t want to reward him if he has a secret bovine kink...” She glanced at her daughter, folding to her power and opinion. <br />
<br />
“Once he’s transformed and being milked everyday, counting down days until the barbeque, I don’t think he’ll be so into it,” Kat responded, smirking over him. “Whether it’s the impending butchering, the manhandling, the flavor of the grass he’ll have to eat.... Oh, so many things to look forward to! But, I know that he won’t be so excited for long.” <br />
<br />
“Gosh!” Kat suddenly bounced with excitement. “Father’s Day is the next holiday we celebrate, isn’t it? We can give dad an extra gift! A cow for his very own! Like back on the farm where he grew up!” <br />
<br />
“The farm?” Dan’s mind flashed with his one memory of visiting their father’s family farm back when he was a child. He saw cows milling around, smearing with mud on their legs and their mouths full of grass that they chewed and chewed and chewed. He felt a sudden twinge of fright at the idea of being stuck on all fours in the dusty of the prairie, waiting for local teenagers to come try and tip him over as he slept there, naked and exposed. <br />
<br />
Her eyes turned on her brother, gleaming. “A plump, fertile cow who needs milking twice a day to provide all the milk we need, maybe even enough to sell around the neighborhood because she’s constantly leaking, heavy with milk. Plus, eventually once you’re fat enough, Dad really does love a good barbeque... He’d just at the chance to make his own steaks from start to finish...” <br />
<br />
Jan clapped. “Oh, plus cheese! They used to make wheels and wheels of cheese on the farm! It does take a lot of milk, but we can ensure that Danny provides all that’s needed to make your father delightfully happy and give us a pantry full of wheels.” <br />
<br />
“Not just one kind either!” Kat added, nodding along with Jan’s involvement. Her eyes peeked at her brother, knowing that his own mother dooming him only made this worse. “We’ll make every variety. Dad can host sampler nights for the neighborhood, letting everyone try the wares. Maybe we’ll even be able to sell them at the farmer’s market? Have Dan come along, let everyone meet the cow they are eating from! Compliment him to his face! Milk him themselves!” <br />
<br />
The image of small, grubby hands of children at the local farmer’s market grabbing onto his nipples at Kat had done and yanking at them, pulling on the tender skin shot through Dan’s mind. A shudder raced down his spine at the thought of so many strangers seeing him so, touching him. <br />
<br />
While their voices swarmed around him, mocking him with his future, Dan felt a sudden itching down his thighs. The pale skin was starting to splotch with color as small hairs began to grow up through the skin, pricking out one by one with a little tingle at the base at they sprouted. Stark, white coating started to grow down the expanse of his leg, speckling with irregular black dots. <br />
<br />
“W-what’s happening? What’s happening to me?” Dan yelped, seeing the hair growing with abject horror. “I-I... This can’t really be happening?! You can’t make me a cow!” <br />
<br />
“Oh, but Dan!” Kat’s laugh snuck in through her words. “I can make you a big fat cow suitable only for providing milk or a veal for fattening and savoring. I can make you a steak on the grill. I can do anything to you. You’re not a son or a brother anymore. You’re just my birthday gift until I decide your fate, and your fate is to be a milking cow that ends up on the barbeque, feeding the mouth of that cute girl from down the street. You always did want her to eat your meat, right?”</p>
