<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat sat at her desk, two hands clutching her spell book. She needed to find a way to solve her problem, but her mind kept returning to her wasted opportunity. She&#39;d been so close to his hot hungry vagina and now she wasn&#39;t getting it. No! She needed to focus, fix this before mom and dad came home. But she needed it so badly. She rubbed her rock hard throbbing dick against the underside of her desk while clutching her spell book. She gasped as precum leaked. This wasn&#39;t working. She couldn&#39;t fix things if she didn&#39;t fuck him.<br />
She snatched her spell book and with her dick bouncing eagerly before her she rushed out.<br />
<br />
She burst into his empty room. &quot;Fuck!&quot;<br />
She was underway downstairs when she heard an unfamiliar voice from the bathroom. She stepped in. Laying in a bathtub filled with watery milk was her brother. Caressing his swollen belly, huge dick partially out of the water.<br />
&quot;Kat! Like, Dani was totally thinking of you! Dani not happy at all!&quot; Dan said, with a pouting face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who cares!&quot; Kat yelled, with one hand on her throbbing dick she recited a spell.<br />
It sounded familiar to Dani, but he couldn&#39;t place it. What was his meany sister going to do now?<br />
The bathwater around him suddenly hardened. He was stuck. Towels flew form the racks around them and wrapped around him. &quot;What you doing to Dani!&quot; Was all he could manage before a towel wrapped around his head. He could feel more pressure being put on him, the feeling was familiar. But what about his baby? No, that was an egg! Dani is not really pregnant Dan told himself.<br />
<br />
Before her eyes the egg reformed and lifted partially from the bathtub. Rubbing her dick Kat rapidly used more incantations. She couldn&#39;t wait, she needed her brothers hot cunt around her rod right now.<br />
She tapped the egg and cracks appeared on the shell.<br />
<br />
Dan could feel the pressure start to fade again. He knew what was coming now. He started trying to move his legs. Slowly movement returned to them as he started kicking and pushing until finally he was able to crawl from his egg shell on all fours and onto the bathroom floor. He looked up at his sister, her mad eyes focused on him. Unlike last time, Dan immediately felt different. He felt a slow warmth build up in his loins. He tried to get up, but failed and flopped back on all fours. He looked at his hands, they were feet. He felt a heavy load hanging from his chest, but as tried to looked down the tip of his cock pushed against his sensitive lips. He could taste the precum from the tip and felt the heat behind him increase.<br />
He looked at the mirror which hung conveniently next to his sister. He was on all fours, but his hind legs were much longer than his front legs. His ass was high in the air for all to see. A large melon sized set of testicles hung heavily between his legs. His belly was gone, she&#39;d taken his baby! No wait, he was happy the egg was gone actually.<br />
His already large dick had been enlarged further and in it&#39;s rock hard state reached to his chin. From his chest hung 2 large leaky breasts, with his large dick between them.<br />
He looked at his sister. &quot;What have you done to Dani?&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you want &#39;brother&#39;?&quot;<br />
He didn&#39;t know what she meant at first, but he was feeling the building heat behind him. His vagina was on fire, it was empty. He needed it filled. His eyes caught his sister dick. He needed that, in him now.<br />
&quot;Dani wants cock!&quot;<br />
&quot;YES! Beg! Show me where!&quot; Kat exclaimed. She threw her book away and grabbed her dick with two hands, rubbing as she waited for the answer.<br />
&quot;Dani needs cock here!&quot; Dan awkwardly and slowly turned around. Each step making his breasts rub his hard dick and sending pleasure through his body.<br />
He showed his ass to his sister and looked around. In the mirror he could see his slit. It had been enlarged and was dripping with lubricants. He needed it now.<br />
<br />
Kat didn&#39;t waste a second and plunged forward. Her brothers hips were the perfect height for her. She stuck her hungry in and felt his vagina clench around her shaft, the heat from his pussy was fantastic. Her body shook and her dick spewed a load in her brothers hungry pussy immediately at the first thrust. But it wasn&#39;t enough, she&#39;d been blue balled for so long. She thrust again. She could feel her hips slapping against his massive balls. She groaned as another orgasm rocked her body. Her brother used his new fat lips to suck his own dick while she kept thrusting, searching for another fix. Her body shook and again she felt her dick pump.<br />
Her mind slowly cleared. She&#39;d had her fix, for now at least. Breathing heavily, she needed to fix them, she&#39;d gone to far. She wanted to pull out, but felt reluctant. It felt so good. She ran a finger along her brothers vagina and tasted his juices. So good.</p>
