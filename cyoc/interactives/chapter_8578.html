<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stan made his way toward the truck stop.<br />
<br />
At this hour of the morning there wasn't much in the way of traffic.  The roomy long trench coat he'd left in the delivery van barely fit over his huge muscular frame but it was enough to hide his difference in the dark.  His Feodora, stretched a little, was enough to hide the horns.<br />
<br />
Stan was in need!<br />
<br />
He cut through a couple of vacant lots and was closer to the truck stop.  He rounded the corner and smelled a most delightful smell...<br />
fresh piss, so fresh the man who was making it against the wall of the bar was still pissing.<br />
<br />
The bar, of course, was closed and he seemed to be the last patron out of the place around the backside of the bar, behind a dumpster.<br />
<br />
He was a big guy, leaning against the wall as he no doubt emptied his bladder of all the beer he'd had this night.  The guy was a huge, muscular biker, with a long blond pony tail and a beard that was so bushy Stan could see it on the sides of his face from behind the man. <br />
<br />
His powerful, meaty arms were covered in tattoos and the leather vest he wore looked like it was worn 24/7.  His worn greasy jeans were down around his boots; he was so drunk he didn't seem to notice that he'd dropped them nor did he seem to care.<br />
<br />
Stan's cock grew erect seeing the hairy ass ready for plundering.<br />
<br />
Stan moved up behind the pissing giant, he was as big as Stan was in his now transformed state.<br />
<br />
In one swift move Stan pinned the man against the building and began rubbing his cock into the mans hairy ass crack, smearing it with thick pre-come.<br />
<br />
The man struggled, but Stan was stronger and the huge biker was so drunk that he couldn't effectively break away.<br />
<br />
&quot;You fuck!  You don' fuckin' know who yer messin' with.  I'm an Angel man an' me an' muh brothers are gonna...&quot;<br />
<br />
Stan cut him off with a thrust of his huge cock up his ass.  The man cried out.  It was a strangled cry and Stan pulled his head back by his pony tail and leaned around with his face bent toward the biker so the the burly man could see his face.  Stan's hat had fallen off in the rush to catch the man unaware and his horns were very evident, gleaming in the moonlight.<br />
<br />
Stan knew what would pacify the man with fear if nothing else would.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I'm a Fallen Angel!  The FIRST to fall!&quot;  Stan bellowed in biker's face in the deserted lot.  Stan thrust inside the biker again, pinning him against the wall and released his grip on the pony tail. <br />
<br />
&quot;Behold my cloven hoof, mortal, you have already proof of the searing hot member inside of you now.  Do you doubt that such an unnaturally large member could belong to none other than Lucifer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stan extended a hoof and the biker looked down.  He saw the hoof and began to tremble.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Prince of Darkness desires you.  What is your name, that I might know my new lover; condemned to be my concubine and play thing for eternity in the infernal realms?&quot;  Stan growled.<br />
<br />
The biker was too frightened to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speak!&quot; Stan barked in his ear and the man tensed, squeezing Stan's cock with his virgin ass-hole, sending chills of pleasure through Stan's body that came out as shivers of delight.<br />
<br />
The biker croaked out, &quot;Snake.&quot; then added, &quot;You're Infernal Majesty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stan couldn't help himself now, that last honorific made him laugh a deep, menacing sounding, laugh and the biker began to sob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Silence!&quot;  Stan barked, gaining control of himself.  &quot;My chosen mate will not be weak!  My concubine will not cry like a pitiful child or helpless woman!  Take what Lucifer Light-bringer has given you like a man, nay, like the beast you are to become in my embrace!  Place both of your hands on the wall and brace yourself for my mating with you, I Lord of Hell command it!&quot;  <br />
<br />
nake complied, without hesitation.<br />
<br />
Stan paused.  Then growled softly.  &quot;Snake!  How appropriate!  I introduced myself to your kind in the guise of the serpent, it is fitting that my chosen have such a name.&quot; <br />
<br />
Stan was getting into the role and enjoying his dominance over this handsomely rough, burly beast of a man.<br />
<br />
The biker dared to ask, &quot;Does the name please you, Lord of Darkness?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stan almost lost it again but choked back the laugh and growled in the mans ear.  &quot;Prince of Darkness, half wit!  Take care in what you say and do.  Obey me and I will grant you a favored spot in my court; displease me and I will remake you into a twelve foot long maggot, to live in the the offal pits of Hell, do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
The biker whispered, &quot;Yes, your Majesty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good...&quot; Stan cooed, &quot;then let your debauchery and transformation begin.  Soon you will wear a form more befitting the chosen of the foremost Mote in God's Eye.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stan spread his legs so that his pelvis fit more tightly around Snakes hairy ass.  His inner thighs carressed Snakes outer thighs.  He grabbed at the coller of man's black Harley T-shirt and ripped it open to gain access to the man's nipples.  He pinched and teased them and bit down on the man's shoulder.  Snake let out a small whimper and as he bit again, Stan's huge hairy paw-like hands moved down the biker's hairy chest and found his erect cock.  <br />
<br />
Stan released his hold on the bikers shoulder and whispered in his ear.  &quot;In Hell, there are NO forbidden pleasures, but I see that your cock is already anticipating this!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Stan began humping the man as he pumped the biker's erect ten inch cock.<br />
<br />
Snake had taken in enough of Stan's scent by now that it didn't matter that for the first 40 years of his life he'd been a strict heterosexual; right now, he was in the arms of Lucifer and he was having the best sex he'd ever had.  Every nerve was alive, every breath filled him with passion and every thrust that caused his huge balls to sway and brush against his own hairy legs sent electric shocks up his spine.  Snake knew he was damned, but if this was damnation, he would gladly trade it for Heaven.  <br />
<br />
The Devil had promised him a more fitting form and Snake could only imagine with lust the increased size of his balls, the elongated and bloated new cock he would grow, the fur covered body and the bat wings he would develop.  Snake threw his head back and welcomed the coming transformation.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Better to rule in Hell...&quot; Snake muttered.<br />
<br />
Stan growled as he humped the biker, &quot;And rule you will, my beautiful beast, you will be first of all my concubines.&quot;  Stan moaned and shot hot satyr seed into his waiting vessel.<br />
<br />
Stan was still, after his orgasm, horny as Hell!  His cock was as hard as when he'd just sunk it into the biker's furry ass.  Ten minutes passed as he fucked the moaning biker.  The tight, come slicked hole was pure pleasure for the satyr.  Stan grunted his passion and continued to tease the bikers hairy chest and nipples, occasionally stroking Snake's rock hard cock.<br />
<br />
Stan could feel the man changing in his embrace.  His muscles were rippling beneath his leather vest and Stan pulled it and the torn shirt off the bikers torso, revealing a covering of thick hair growing over the bikers back and arms.  The biker was bucking back against Stan's thrusts and he was praying to Almighty Lucifer to fuck his brains out.  The bikers legs were becoming cloven hoofs and as the human boots and pants became cumbersome, he looked down, stepped out of them and kicked them aside.<br />
<br />
Snake was growing even larger and more burly than he was already.  He was growing a short goat tail just above his ass and his lower half became covered in goat fur.  His hoofs were broad and sturdy.  The man's voice was extremely deep as he bellowed out his orgasm in sync with Stan's own grunting, gushing, growling, mind blowing orgasm.  The two male satyrs spurted out their thick seed for minutes, before they stopped and panted.  <br />
<br />
Stan with drew from the biker-satyr.  Backed off a step and surveyed his work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn around, Lord Snake!  That you may know your Lord and Master!&quot;  Stan said in a voice as dark as The Void and as noble as any king.<br />
<br />
Snake turned to face Stan, his eyes cast down in submission.<br />
<br />
The new satyr was the most beautiful being Stan had ever seen.  He was raw masculinity in the flesh and his cock was still erect and oozing cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look upon your new body, my lover and rejoice!  You are the most beautiful of all my creations!  Come to me now, my lover and embrace the Dark Lord!&quot; Stan said.<br />
<br />
The man looked Stan in the eye for the first time.  His eyes were filled with inhuman lust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my Master, as you wish.&quot;  Snake said and knelt upon one knee before his master.<br />
<br />
Stan motioned his lover to stand and embraced his new 'brother'; kissing him deeply.  Parting from the kiss Stan said, &quot;We must go Lord Snake.  Dawn approaches and I would lie with you the rest of this night and into the following day, but we must seek shelter from the Eye of God.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stan was going to play being Lucifer Light-bringer just a little while longer...</p>
