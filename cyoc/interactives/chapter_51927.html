<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few hours later Ian was setting up yet another tray of malted beers. The frat brothers were ignoring everything else and definatly got a kick out of the strange drinks. He himself was rather buzzed and had a hard time thinking straight. He seemed to notice that once they found one they liked, the guys wouldn't touch a pitcher that didn't have beer with that kind of malt in it. The greenish tan mix that had a grapish flavor had him hooked to it.<br />
<br />
There was also something else bothering him, that the guys seemed to be hanging on each other a little more than usual. Even the other times they had gotten totally hammered they didn't faun over each other like they were doing. He put it out of his mind and called people who were at least decently sober in to help him carry the pitchers to the front room. Brad came in, looking rather calm and mellow. Hank shortly tailing him. Ian wasn't sure but he thought he could see light kickies on their necks through his haze.<br />
<br />
Brad came up and patted Ian on the back, giving him a warm smile. &quot;Man, this is one of the best parties we've had. Dude, this beer is great!&quot; He and Hank both drained what was left in their plastic cups before throwing them away to pick up trays. Brad looked over at Ian for a moment then stopped. &quot;Hey Ian... do you have a tail?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ian swung his head over at his frat brother then had to steady himself. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, is that a tail?&quot; Brad set the tray down and walked over to hold Ian steady so he could bend around to try and see his on ass. Lo and behold, there was a short fuzzy tail sticking up over his jeans. He stared at it for a second before laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah, I guess someone must have stuck it in there. Just someone playing a prank, it's just a fa-&quot; He was cut off as it shook. He looked up at Brad then started yelling, batting at it and trying to pull it off, feeling the pain each time he grabbed hold of it. Brad and Hank grabbed his shoulders and told him to stop freaking out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay dude, just chill. We'll look at it, see if it comes off.&quot; Brad slid his hands down his back to pull the hem of his jeans down to get a better look. Hank was right in his face and Ian could smell the beer on his breath. It had the same smell as the beer mix he had been drinking, that strong grape flavor. He found himself relaxing as he looked into Hanks eyes, which were much closer than he was comfortable with. Suddenly there were a pair of hands reaching around from behind him undoing his belt and fly. He jumped at first but Hank held him fast. &quot;Chill dude, just lowering them to get a better look.&quot;<br />
<br />
From the other room were loud bought of laughter, and a few other noises as well. One of the loudest was one of the guys making a braying sound. The others laughing and Ian could swear he heard someone say that the voice matched the gear. His attention was quickly brought back to his own situation when he felt his jeans fall to around his ankles. He looked over his shoulders to see Brad inspecting where the tail attached itself to his skin, shuddering as fingers felt where fur faded into flesh. They also worked their way under the tail, and Ian found himself spreading his legs as his briefs were pulled down as well, a strange sensation filling him. He looked back up to see Hank's face even closer, an odd look in his eye. A sharp jolt of pleasure caused him to look down. Forming a rather large tent in his boxers his dick had become engorged, and from the workout shorts of the frat brother in front of him another tent had bumped into it.<br />
<br />
Ian looked back up at Hank and recognised the look in his eye; lust. Thier faces were less than an inch apart at this point and when Brad's finger finally found it's way to Ian's pucker, the young man let out a gasp and his mouth was filled by a tongue as Hank drove in for a kiss. Ian found himself returning the kiss and trying to suck the flavor of the beer out of his brothers mouth. While behind him Brad had pulled the briefs down to the floor as well had shoved his own tongue up Ian's hole. The three gyrated together as the other two worked to release their own organs, Ian's hands finding their way down to work Hank's rod with a skill he didn't realise he had.<br />
<br />
For several minutes he sucked face with Hank as Brad ate him out, but he pulled away from his passionate kiss when he felt Brad stand up. &quot;Why'd you stop? That felt amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause I wanted to do something even better.&quot; Reaching over for their favorite flavor he stuck his fingers into the beer and rubbed Ian's pucker for a moment, then stuck his own dick into the pitcher. Realising what was going on Hank put his hands on Ian's shoulders and guided him to bend over. Ian looked up at him for a moment confused, then his eyes shot open as he felt something large and blunt start to slide in under his tail. He let out a loud gasp as it sunk into him, and once again had Hank dive into his mouth. Only this time it wasn't his tongue.<br />
<br />
Hank shot his head back and sighed. &quot;Oh god, you have no idea how long I've wanted to do this...&quot; Brad chuckled and started thrusting in and out, sending Ian who was lost in bliss, up and down Hank's dick. They bucked back and forth for no less then ten minutes before Brad started convulsing and drove himself to the hilt into Ian. Who at the sensation started to shoot himself, his throat tightening around Hank who shot violently down the fleshy pipe. <br />
<br />
After a few seconds Ian pulled off both his Frat brothers and reached over for the pitcher, not caring that there had been a dick in it he took a large swig and looked back over at the two. They were both winded and looked guilty about having just spit roasted their friend. Ian smiled and noted that each now had pointed ears and vestigal horns on their heads, as well as the beginings of tails of their own. &quot;Hey, pull yer pants up and lets get this booze out to the other guys. They must be dying of thirst by now.&quot;</p>
