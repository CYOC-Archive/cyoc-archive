<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andros examined himself carefully as he checked himself in the mirror. the lining scales on his back, arms, and his thighs were a purple color, but the scales that were running down from his neck to his belly and under his tail was  Scarlet as it&#39;s a shade of red with hints of orange. it was said to be the color of flames as A few bright speckles dotted from his upper thighs. only a few silver spikes trailed around his head that it included the tip of his tail while his body looked almost associations with a flat chest, but didn&#39;t had a bulging belly as the belly curved inward.<br />
<br />
when He couldn&#39;t see any of his genitals that Either they were just hidden beneath his belly and tail, or he didn&#39;t have any as he didn&#39;t thought about it when he had Two smooth membranous wings protruded from his back. as They looked thin and fragile as he doubted they would be able to support his massive form and allow him to fly that somewhere deep down inside of him know they were also strong and could carry him when he was ready to fly. His hands had three thick stubby digit fingers with optional thumb as they each ending in short claws, thankfully still usable. (it&#39;s like having one of your four fingers sticking together with the finger next to it as one.) His feet were large and bulbous as they were just the same with three stubby toes ending in the same short claws, but your fourth toe on each feet was now a dew claw. His thighs and calves were digigrated as they were thick while looking sexy and slim.<br />
<br />
He had no hair or ears as he know dragons don&#39;t have them that his whole body, including his head was almost smooth to the touch. he wasn&#39;t evil or anything like that, but he did looked menacing and yet cute at the same time as he indeed looked friendly, when he wanted to. with his almost human looking blue eyes now sea green, and a warm welcoming smile on his long dragon snout made him look like a children&#39;s video game character brought to life that he could have passed for someone in a very elaborate dragoness as this was when he opened up his mouth and looked inside. when he did is when he realized as there was no doubt in his mind that There was no person in there, not even you as there was just a large thick tongue inside a wide snout as it was lined up by dull short teeth.<br />
<br />
Andros knew he should be scared at this point when he remembered his genitals that he searched around down there, but to his surprise as there was nothing manly down there as he soon finds out why it had a purple dragoness look. he noticed why he was purple when he was now in the body of a female anthro purple dragoness. he, now she, was now a sexy anthro dragoness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- I don&#39;t believe this!&quot; Andros begins to say as she was then immediately stun by her new, feminine voice with a quick gasp of breath. &quot;my... my voice! i&#39;m a... i&#39;m a female dragon!&quot; she finish saying as she then looked back towards the mirror to show that this was real while showing her the truth as she wasn&#39;t dreaming at all. Andros begins to pinch herself in hopes it was a lie, but for some reason as she wasn&#39;t hurt that she wasn&#39;t even worried anymore as she just went with it as her pinches didn&#39;t even hurt her scaly naked body. not even a tickle that In fact, she felt very full of energy and quite good of herself as she felt like a kid again. she then plodded across the room while flapping her wings experimentally, trying to hover as she was pausing occasionally to examine her reflection in the mirror every now and then. <br />
<br />
she was curious as she wondered if she could even breathe out fire that she was about to attempt it when she stepped on something. moving her foot back as she looked down to the ground that below the mirror where she stepped was the zipper as it was on the floor. crouching down to pick it up that she thought to herself while she also thought the name Andros was for boys as she then thought of the name to use. &quot;well, I guess if I want to change back and get this suit off of me that all I just have to do is to reattach this zipper to unzip it and take it off of me. now, I know that this is Cool and all, but I think the name Scarlet will do while i&#39;m in this dragon form as Andros life will be put on hold.&quot; placing the zipper away in her secret jewelry box for safe keeping that you you made a nice sexy pose and said to yourself, &quot;Let&#39;s have some fun!&quot; as she was growing breasts, which were rapidly expanding by the minute.</p>
