Back to the junior lunch… <br />
<br />
Nate, Ben and Alex walked into lunch together, trying to ignore all the buzzing around them. Most, if not all, of it was about Julie and Eric. Nate was certain Julie was up to no good. But knew that he’d just have to wait and see if she actually acted on any of her crazy ideas, whatever they may be. <br />
<br />
“You alright Nate? Seem a bit out of it.” Alex comments when Nate almost walks into a table. <br />
<br />
“Lot on my mind.”<br />
<br />
“Julie?” <br />
<br />
“No. Kenya actually.” Nate said. Ben and Alex exchanged a look. They hadn’t realized Nate was this torn up about Kenya. The way he was acting on Saturday, after he and Kenya had it out, you wouldn’t have thought the guy broke up with anyone. <br />
<br />
“Something else happen between you two?” Alex asked. <br />
<br />
“Read it for yourself.” Nate took out his phone and handed it to Alex. He and Ben quickly read the text Kenya sent. <br />
<br />
“What do you guys think I should do?” Nate asked, taking the phone back. <br />
<br />
“Hard to say. Do you want to get back together with her?” Ben asked. <br />
<br />
“I dunno. I don’t think I want to jump right back into a relationship right now. But if she really wants to try again…” <br />
<br />
“Why not just talk to her and see how it goes. If you think she’s sincere, then talk things slow. Like, slower than slow. Snail speed.” Alex suggests. <br />
<br />
“We tried going slow last time. Look how well it turned out.” Nate griped. He hangs his head for a while, picking at his lunch. He was torn up inside. He didn’t know if he could trust Kenya, but he also missed her. Whether or not she could earn his trust again remained to be seen. And then there was the small matter of Liv. <br />
<br />
Nate knew one thing for sure. Not matter what happened between him and Kenya, he would still be going out with Liv on Thursday. What harm could a little recreational fun do? <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------ <br />
<br />
Nate and Spencer were in Chemistry when Nate decided to ask for Spencer’s advice. They were supposed to be doing a worksheet about how many valence electrons were in a particular atom. But neither Nate or Spencer had Eric’s almost obsessive love for the subject, and didn’t care if they understood why atoms made covalent bonds. <br />
<br />
When Nate brought up Kenya, Spencer wasn’t too surprised to hear she’d cheated on him. She held in the “I told you so”. She WAS surprised to hear that Nate had already made a date for himself later that week. <br />
<br />
“You really go for felines don’t you?” Spencer joked. <br />
<br />
“Guess that’s my type. But I don’t know, should I even bother seeing either of them?” Nate sighed. <br />
<br />
“What do you have to lose? Kenya’s going give you whatever ’I’m so sorry’ speech she’s thought up, and this Liv sounds like she’s just interested in some casual fun. What’s wrong with that?” <br />
<br />
“I dunno, just seems a bit wrong for some reason. I’m not in a relationship with her anymore, but it still feels like I’m cheating on Kenya.” <br />
<br />
“It’s not. And remember, she made the mistake, not you.” <br />
<br />
“Ya, I guess. Thank Spencer.” Nate leans over and kisses Spencer’s cheek. <br />
<br />
“Hey, I’m not on the market. Down boy!” Spencer smiles as she pushes Nate away. He smiles back and shrugs. <br />
<br />
“No harm in cheek kisses. Though I have to admit, I’m a little jealous Eric got to you before I could.” <br />
<br />
“Mmm, no offense Nate but I’m not interested in seeing anymore canines right now.” <br />
<br />
“None taken. I think Kenya put me off panthers. Like how Julie put Eric off mermaids.” Nate said. Spencer nodded. She herself wasn’t that keen on fish. But she did wonder what Julie’s plans were for revenge. How crafty can one air headed blonde be? <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------ <br />
<br />
As it turns out, Nate was right about Eric being too oblivious to realize school had let out for the day. He was spending his “special privilege” time sitting in his usual spot reading. Eric was so engrossed in his Chemistry book he didn’t even register the sweet smell of perfume coming from behind him. <br />
<br />
Julie had been waiting for her chance to make a move on Eric. She hadn’t planned on things moving so fast, but things were a bit more complicated than she’d anticipated. Spencer and Eric dating was definitely a surprise, but no reason for her to abandon her plan of revenge. <br />
<br />
And of course she found him where he always spent his free period. Next to the old bike rack, on the far side of the school near the parking lot. Cutting class wasn’t that big a deal to her. Eric was all alone, and no one would come looking for them. It was almost too perfect of an opportunity. <br />
<br />
Julie slowly walked up behind Eric, and then jumped him. Sort of. She wrapped her arms around his chest and gave a tight squeeze so he couldn’t get away. <br />
<br />
“Julie? What the heck are you doing?” Eric yelped when he realized who was pressing their chest against his back. <br />
<br />
“Offering a hug. Remember, I’m trying to be nice now.”<br />
<br />
“Really? How nice?” Eric said, remembering Frieda’s warning. He wasn’t sure if this was an actual hug or not. Julie’s grip was unusually tight and clingy. More tight and clingy than she’d ever been when they were together. <br />
<br />
“As nice as you want me to be.” she says with a certain lilt in her voice. Her hands move down Eric’s torso. Julie smiles when she touches his belt. Like an old pro, she starts stroking his penis. Eric can’t help the erection he gets. His body isn’t doing as he wants it to. <br />
<br />
His one and only thought is to run, but his legs are frozen. Julie’s gentle strokes turn into more demanding tugs. She finds his zipper and grasps Eric’s stiff boyhood. The little bit of pre sliding down its length tells Julie she’s doing a good job. <br />
<br />
“Why don’t we go somewhere more private?” Julie whispers in Eric’s ear, an evil gleam in her eye. <br />
<br />
Eric opens his mouth to protest, but Julie jams her tongue in. <br />
<br />
“God, what the hell is wrong with her?” Eric thought. Eric tries pushing Julie away, but it’s like she’s glued herself to him. Actually she’s got a firm hold on his penis, and whenever Eric tries to take a step back Julie digs her nails into the sensitive skin. <br />
<br />
Naturally Eric yelped in pain, and stopped squirming out of fear that Julie would tear his penis right off. Sure she didn’t have claws, but Eric didn’t want to find out how determined Julie was.</p>
