<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty smiled. He has always wanted to try out for football. Maybe now is the time. &quot;I wish that I grew enough muscles to play football&quot;. He was already growing hairy but he thought of one more change. &quot;i want my dick and balls to grow as well&quot;. He glanced at his watch. This class was an hour long. &quot;I want it to take place over an hour&quot;, he softly added.<br />
<br />
Ty knew he was still growing hairier as he scratched his newly bushy pits through his shirts. Even through tbe fabric he could tell they were getting very thick. Man, they were itchy. He wanted to look at them but he was in the middle of class. As he scratched he knew he had thick mass of hair. He was excited about the muscles, though. As much hair as he had grown, he was still fairly skinny.<br />
<br />
Tyler felt the itching in his chest, legs, and crotch increase. Discretely, he dropped a hand down the front of his pants. Holy shit! His bush was huge! So much bigger than before! And if he wasn&#39;t mistaken, his package was a big bigger already too. He pulled his hand out before he made himself hard or aroused suspicion from his other classmates.<br />
<br />
He began to itch the center of his chest through his shirt. He slid his hand under his t shirt and was not at all surprised to find he had a bit of chest hair growing out in the middle and around his nipples. It wasn&#39;t stopping either! Within a minute or two he had a thick brown thatch sticking up out of the collar of his t shirt! It would be obvious to anyone he saw that he was sporting a thick rug!<br />
<br />
Fuck, he was itching really badly! It was everywhere! He felt it start up on his ass and arms too. Oh man, he didn&#39;t want a hairy ass! But I guess that made sense. If you want to be hairy you gotta take the whole package. He tried to concentrate so as to not draw attention. He looked down at his work, trying to ignore the army of ants crawling in every nook and cranny of his body. It was then he saw his forearms were covered in a nice, manly coating of thick hair. Whoa, they looked different. He saw a few light strands on his knuckles that looked to be getting even longer, too. He noticed veins he had never had before snaking their way down his arms.<br />
<br />
Glancing at his upper arms, he saw his shirt was much tighter now! His wish had worked. He was definitely growing more muscular. He lightly flexed and saw a small mound of muscle stretch his shirt sleeve. The shirt sleeve rode even higher up his arms and a bush of hair spilled out from his armpits, long, dark, thick, and visible to all. He quickly<br />
tucked it back in, or the best he could, to prevent suspicion. He noticed that his other clothes seemed to be fitting tightly as well, especially his crotch. He discretely copped another feel through his pants and noticed he was much thicker and longer, and he was snaking down his left pant leg. This was incredible!<br />
<br />
He noticed his shirt felt tighter around his chest as well. It looked like it was close to being painted on. You could see the outline of some rather defined pecs. Likewise, the thatch of hair sticking up out of his collar had gotten longer. It was grown right up to the stubble from his beard. HIS BEARD! Whoa he had thick, prickly facial hair. It was growing into a short beard! &quot;Hmm looks like I&#39;ll have to teach myself how to shave&quot;, he thought to himself with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
As he was stroking his new stubble, he noticed his shirt was even tighter on him! He glanced down and saw his midsection was totally exposed! His shirt up past his belly button. With a start, he realized that his stomach was covered in a very wide trail of thick dark hair! It spread out all over his belly, rose up under his shirt to meet his hairy chest, and under his waistband to meet up with his massive bush. The hair in the middle was so thick you couldn&#39;t even see the skin. He playfully tugged on a few hairs. He noticed that, albeit hard to see under the hair, he was developing powerful ab muscles. This is crazy!<br />
<br />
As he tries to tug the middrift of his shirt down, he noticed that his biceps and chest have grown so muscular his shirt was practically just a tank top. His messy bushes were on full display. It was then he noticed a strong musky scent, unlike a locker room. He took a quick, discreet whiff of his pits. Oh no! The smell was coming from him! He had BO now? That wasn&#39;t ideal, but if he wanted to be a football player, I guess smelling like them was part of the package. Speaking of packages...<br />
<br />
He glanced down and saw that the crotch of his pants were absolutely stuffed with his meat. It felt so constricting and tight. He could clearly see the outline of his thick cock and his 2 large balls! The tightness was gradually making him hard. Oh no! If he gets fully hard, his pants could rip open in class! He noticed a rather large wet stain on the front of his pants. What? It was a huge stain of precum. Man, his new equipment was going to be quite leaky it seemed.<br />
<br />
It was then that Ty felt his shoulders and back start to tingle and itch. Enough was enough. He raised his hands, showing off his massive arm, crisscrossed with muscles and veins. The thick coat of hair on his forearms was plainly visible, as was his massive armpit bush. He blushed slightly. &quot;Can I please go to the bathroom?!&quot;, he asked urgently in a surprisingly deep and gravelly voice. The teacher agreed and he hurried off, trying his best to hide is erection and his hairy new body poking out of his all too small clothes.</p>
