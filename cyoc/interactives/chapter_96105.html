<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You groan and wriggle in anger the plastic van. You have the ability to shrink people just for fun and not for business and human slavery (Being a zentai or spandex material doesn&#39;t count). You wish for something bad happening to him and hope that the victim will be safe. You wish for the zentai beings that turned you into a mattress to save you and bring you to a friendlier owner unlike this money making bastard. But all you can do is moan and wriggle in both sadness and anger in the toy van and wait for him to pick you up and abuse your shrinking growing ability.<br />
<br />
Outside of your plastic van, Kyle grabbed Donovan&#39;s box looking at him with an evil smirk on his face as Donovan&#39;s face was twisted in fear. Kyle loves the look of his face of horror and chuckles, &quot;Oh the look on your face is beautiful. I can&#39;t wait to sell you and use that living mattress to make me some more money.&quot; Donovan tries to talk him out of it and unshrink him, but Kyle ignores him as he tosses him in the van and picks up the plastic van carrying Matt. He thought about growing you back, but he decides to do it later and leave the warehouse first and puts the toy next to Donovan and climbs back on to the driver seat, and drive off. After he exited the warehouse, the zebra striped zentai drone along with other two zentai drones including the zentai that transformed Matt into a spandex stopped in front of Kyle&#39;s van as he immediately halted the van.<br />
<br />
A several minutes earlier before the zentai drones came, you knew you had a horrible feeling that Kyle, even though he was good looking, had mischievous plans in store for you and you&#39;re his owner for years to come. Upset by this recent event, you wonder what happens to the man you shrank. And wonder how you shrank that far even though you&#39;re shrink and growth limit is from the smallest to the largest mattress size. But it didn&#39;t matter, you&#39;re just Kyle&#39;s property now as you feel the start of the van&#39;s engine revving up vibrating the toy van as it massages your back as you moan with mixed emotions and just look up at the fake van ceiling. Now, you felt the van stop and the toy roll forward and stop for a moment just as when you were about to sleep. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; you thought to yourself. You wish you had legs to see what&#39;s going on but they&#39;re now a solid spandex mass. You hear a muffled voice outside your movable toy prison and then a small conflict from another. It soon stopped as you  wonder who&#39;s Kyle talking to and was fighting against? Then you hear the back of the van door swing open and feel a lifting motion from the van and you let out a horrified moan feeling that you might be set up immediately for another victim of Kyle&#39;s schemes. You try and move but you can&#39;t. You&#39;re stuck and wait for the inevitable as the toy door opens up and picks you up by the bottom part of your mattress body and what you feel is not flesh but spandex and your horror turns into glee and pleasure as you were saved by the zebra zentai drone and placed you on the palm of the drone&#39;s spandex hand and shows you to the zentai you met and you were picked up by him/it from its palm in to his/its and lay on the palm of the silver drone&#39;s (The one that transformed Matt). You moan and wriggle in joy that you were saved by them. And then you hear a muffled voice above you and Donovan was screaming them to change him back. The zentai gestured the drone holding Donovan&#39;s box to change him back and speaks to you, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, that you had your first abuse by your owner for his illegal work Matt. We will find you a new owner, but first let&#39;s unshrink the both of you.&quot; He then orders the drone to release Donovan from his box and did so as they opened his box as Donovan hurries up his release as it released his right hand and then frees himself. And tries to leave but was stopped by another drone holding you and the other zentai you met and transformed you beside and Donovan begged them, &quot;Please! Change me back! I don&#39;t wanna be small forever!&quot; the zentai beside you spoke, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we will change you back and we will punish the living furniture&#39;s owner for illegal human slavery.&quot; You were then placed on the floor face down of the van as you hear muffled grunts by Kyle trying to break free from one of the zentai drones and spouting out rude words that he kissed his mother&#39;s mouth with. Ignoring his plights, the zentai told Donovan to lay on the mattress as he rolled you inside him and clockwise turn his fabric finger around your small bulge as you moan and then presses down and you feel yourself growing along with Donovan and then stopped growing a minute later. He then release himself from your rolled encasement as your side hits the van floor as he then runs away from the ordeal. Kyle, angered as he watch his former buddy leave the scene and the zentai drones came and walked up to him and yelled, &quot;Why did you do that you fucking freak?! He&#39;s my property and I-&quot; his mouth was covered by the drone holding you in one hand as the other speaks, &quot;We can&#39;t allow you to use our products for your illegal work and humiliate our goals for people that want to become spandex objects for forced human slavery in any way. Take him with us for his punishment.&quot; The drone forced him to walk to the back of the van. You feel pressure on your body as you feel the need to be a living furniture again of being slept on, stepped, and/or sat on and wait for his new owner as Kyle and the drone behind him entered as the other two entered the front of the van and went back to the zentai employment building.<br />
<br />
After a long drive, you and the zentai drones and Kyle, still bind by the zentai drone&#39;s hands and upset, in Kyle&#39;s van returned to the zentai employment building&#39;s back door entrance awaiting by a checkered zentai drone. You then soon exit out of the van after the drone with Kyle stepped out and then you were pulled out of the van by the checkered and the zebra striped zentai that sat on the and entered the building. You then reach an intersection corridor as you went different ways and away from Kyle as he went right with the silver drone and the other drone with Kyle. You then returned to the customer room and see two couples and are glad to see you. You feel joy inside you and moan in happiness as they walked with your carriers and brought to the couple&#39;s SUV as the two drones set you on the back of it and you feel a pat from your right corner foot and hear a female voice, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll take good care of you. We hope you like your new place.&quot; they soon close the trunk door and the two zentai drones made their way back to the building and the couple in their SUV, and to your new home....<br />
<br />
Back at the building, Kyle waits for his punishment of what he may become.....</p>
