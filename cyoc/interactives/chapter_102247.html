<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily yawned as she slowly woke.  The sex had been great, but exhausting.  After a marathon of sex, she and Mike had curled up together and slept peacefully.  But now that she was awake, she wanted to try something.  She slowly unwrapped her long tail from around Mike&#39;s body, careful not to wake him.  Emily wanted to experiment a little bit more on her own.  <br />
<br />
Emily loved her new snake body, but she was curious to try something else.  She slid across the floor to the living room to Mike&#39;s tank to see what other choices she had.  Looking in the tank she immediately located something she wanted to try - a coral snake.  The black, gold and red strips looked so beautiful, she just had to try them on her own body.  Normally she would never have dared to touch such a poisonous snake.  But it didn&#39;t seem disturbed by the other snakes in the tank.  She didn&#39;t think it would mind her naga body either.<br />
<br />
With infinite patience, she slowly reached in and touched the snake&#39;s body.  After a few minutes, the stone on the ring on her finger began to glow.  She withdrew her hand from the tank, and slithered over to a mirror to observe the changes. She concentrated, and the scales at the tip of her tail slowly changed color, becoming alternating stripes of red, gold and black. The pattern slowly spread up her tail.  When it reached her abdomen she was a little surprised to see the color extending past the limits of her scales, and onto her chest.  Slowly the color grew darker on her pale skin, as her smooth skin developed into snake scales.  She knew she should be worried.  The changes were spreading farther this time.  But it didn&#39;t hurt and it looked so pretty she wanted to see how far she could take it.  She willed the changes to continue, and the scales spread down her arms, and over her head.  Her head began to change shape.  Her nose flattened against her face, with only the nostrils remaining as two small holes above her lips.  Her jaw grew wider and longer, jutting out into a snout.  She reached up and felt smooth scales extending over her scalp.  She no longer had any hair.  She was beginning to get a little worried, and willed the changes to stop.  <br />
<br />
She was  little shocked by the changes she saw in the mirror, but also a little excited.  She still had arms and hands with dainty fingers, but they were completely covered in the beautiful red, black and gold scales.  Likewise she still had a very feminine figure above the waist, with wide hips and a narrow waist.  But everything was covered in those beautiful scales, even her generous breasts.  Her nipples were completely covered.  Her head no longer looked human, but rather like a large snake.  She opened her mouth and saw just two large fangs remaining in her jaw.  They looked very sharp, and she wondered if she was now poisonous.  She hoped she was.  It seemed to excite her for some reason.  She liked feeling deadly and dangerous.  Her jaw was huge, and seemed like it could swallow large prey.  She saw her long thin tongue darting from a small hole just below her large throat.   <br />
<br />
Emily admired her reflection in the mirror.  She did not find her appearance repulsive or strange.  She thought she looked beautiful.  By using the ring on the coral snake while she was still in the partial form of the boa, she got the best of both worlds.  She had the size and strength of the boa, along with the beauty and venom of the coral snake.  She wanted to see what else she could add.  She slithered back to the tank.<br />
<br />
Inside she saw a small cobra snake.  It looked irritated and hissed, spreading out its large hood.  Emily&#39;s eyes went wide.  Yes, the hood.  She had to have it.  It looked so good, and would make her look even better.  She reached in and grabbed the snake.  The cobra was fast, but she was even faster.  It tries to bite her, but it was no match for her new reflexes.  She dragged the snake to the mirror, as her ring began to glow again.  She concentrated, focusing on the hood.<br />
<br />
Yes, yes, give it to me, she thought.  I need it.  I must have it.<br />
<br />
Suddenly she felt the skin behind her head and neck slowly stretch into a large hood.  It extended from her head down to her shoulders.  She looked at the cobra wriggling in her hand, wondering what else it could offer her.  Maybe more speed or an even more potent venom.  <br />
<br />
She was still gaining characteristics from the cobra when her she heard Mike stir.  She hissed angrily at the interruption.  She looked at the cobra in her hand and felt a little guilty.  What would Mike think about her new changes?  Would he like them, or would he be repulsed?  As she dropped the angry cobra back into the tank, she realized that she no longer really cared what Mike thought.  She looked at herself in the mirror and found her appearance beautiful.  Who cared what a silly man thought? <br />
<br />
But she was a little worried.  What if he tried to take away her new beauty?  She was already having difficulty maintaining her current form.  The strain of balancing the forms of three snakes in her body required immense concentration.  She found herself constantly fighting to keep  from reverting to a human, or becoming too much like a snake and losing her figure and arms.  She decided it would just be easier to slip the ring off her finger.  Then she could stay this way and not have to think so hard to keep her form.  She could use the ring to return to a more human form later.  But for now, she wanted to be able to relax and enjoy her new form to its fullest.  <br />
<br />
But that human Mike might be a problem.  He had his own ring, and he could use it to take away her beautiful body.  She quietly slid over and carefully removed the ring from his pocket.  Then she tossed her ring and his in the snake tank.  They would be safe there.  Mike would not dare to try to reach into a cage with such venomous monsters.  But it would be a simple feat for a creature like her.  <br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s stomach rumbled.  All of this growth and changing had made her hungry.  She slide over to the fridge, but none of the cold dead meat seemed appealing to her.  She flicked her tongue, and an interesting scent tickled her senses.  She followed it to the window, and saw a small cat resting in their yard.  She salivated a little.<br />
<br />
The small part of her that was still human resisted.  But even that part of her brain was curious to see if her venom was actually as deadly as she hoped.  She silently slid out the door, and stalked her prey.</p>
