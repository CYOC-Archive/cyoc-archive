<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This was like some kind of nightmare for Joe. He knew there was only one large-dick who could qualify as his guardian from now on: his son, Colby. He told the doctor, defeated. As the doctor dialed, Joe looked down at his dwindling cock. Except for the feel of it in his hands, he could almost pretend it was the same size as before. But it definitely felt thinner, and despite the fact that he was harder than he had ever been, he felt almost nothing when he tried jacking it a few times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, hello Colby. My name is Doctor Penten, do you have a few moments to discuss a matter concerning your father&#39;s health? Very good. During a routine exam and testing battery, we discovered your father has contracted Microvela. Before we go any further have you been vaccinated? Wonderful. Your father--yes, that&#39;s right. His penis is shrinking rapidly and he--yes, that&#39;s right. He&#39;s considered a small-dick now, yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just hearing himself described as a small-dick made Joe&#39;s face burn and his dick jump. He watched his dick as he felt the blush creep up his neck. Could he see his dick shrinking right before him? What had the doctor said about speeding up the shrinking process? Fortunately, he didn&#39;t have to wait long as the doctor continued explaining things to his son. His large-dick son. Joe swore he could see his dick pump full of blood and then shrink, just a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;The legal paperwork will wait, in these cases custody is recognized without all the official forms. Now what&#39;s more important is I&#39;d like to talk about your responsibility to--shall we not call him your father? Joey? Excellent--to Joey&#39;s health and development. Oh yes, he will require a feeding as soon as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe tensed and took a step towards the doctor when he heard &#39;Joey.&#39; Nobody had called him &#39;Joey&#39; since he beat up some little queer kid when he was in the third grade. The doctor didn&#39;t even look up from the phone when Joe stepped up to him. Joe felt the fight drain out of him immediately, and at mention of a feeding, his mouth began to water. His hard dick wasn&#39;t dripping any of its usual pre-come, but it was like it was all wetting his mouth instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely. He will be sick for a few days, flu-like symptoms. These can be mitigated by accelerating the process. Feedings from large-dicks, humiliation, anal stimulation: practicing a wide variety of these ensures your small-dick develops quickly and comfortably. Haha, no, I&#39;ve never personally heard of anyone bringing his small-dick through it with zero symptoms, but I&#39;m excited for you to try.&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t even have a name to the doctor and his son anymore. He was just &#39;your small-dick.&#39; Like he belonged to his large-dick son. He whimpered before he could stop himself. This did catch the doctors attention, and he looked up from the phone, noticed Joe was hovering over him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would normally recommend your first interaction be in person, particularly for a small-dick as belligerent as Joey currently is, but I&#39;ve recently heard an encouraging sign. I&#39;ll hand the phone over to him.&quot; The doctor held out the phone and Joe looked at him dumb-founded. &quot;Your guardian wants to talk to you, small-dick. Don&#39;t keep him waiting.&quot; Joe hated being talked to like this, even as his dick bobbed and his ears burned red. <br />
<br />
&quot;G-good, give the little shit-eater a piece of my mind if he thinks he&#39;s going to--&quot; he grabbed the phone and held it to his ear, ready to chew out his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joey. Shut your mouth this instant.&quot; Colby said over the phone. Joe felt his jaw snap shut, but then the rage boiled back up with the embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen here, this isn&#39;t going to happen, this changes nothing, I am still the--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t make me tell you again, small-dick. I want you undivided attention. I want you thinking about my big cock. Probably bigger than yours is, now, and it&#39;s just gonna get bigger.&quot; Joe tried to yell over his son, but once Colby brought up his big cock, it was over for Joe. Even if he had the heart to disobey a direct order again, he felt like if he opened his mouth he would drool all over the phone. &quot;That&#39;s better. Now, are you feeling sick?&quot; There was genuine care in his voice, but Joe tried to shake off the emotion that sparked within him.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no S-s--. No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, by the time I get there in 15 minutes, I want you to come up with a list of more respectful things you could be calling me. I&#39;ll decide how I want my small-dick father addressing me, but if I pick something off your list, you&#39;ll be rewarded. Is that understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Joe cursed at himself for slipping in &#39;sir&#39; at the end. His son gave a throaty chuckle on the other side of the phone, and the sound of that deep voice made Joey&#39;s knees weak. He thought about the cock between his son&#39;s legs, the big, hot, heavy large-dick pushing past his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you&#39;re not feeling sick, and we&#39;re going to keep it that way. Now you are going to repeat after me, and when I hang up you&#39;re going to keep repeating that out loud until I arrive. The first words I want to hear out of your little-dick mouth will be these. Ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe learned the words and repeated them aloud over and over again when he hung up the phone. He could practically feel his dick getting smaller with every repetition. Alone in the exam room, Joe felt he was going to cry. But thinking about his son made him so weak in the knees. He was a great big, muscled man with a dwindling dick, and he was more hungry than he had ever been.<br />
<br />
When Colby walked in, Joe dropped to his knees immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m your Joey-boy. Joey-boy needs to serve you and suck on your cock. Your cock is Joey-boy&#39;s best friend. Please accept me as your Joey-boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby grinned.</p>
