<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Roy sat on the bed for a moment and stared at the small, glass bottles. Each had a different color, and they were just beautiful. One, in particular, was stunning: The aqua-blue one. Blue was his favorite color, so he pulled the bottle out of the box, and he examined the label on the bottle.<br />
<br />
It read: “Superhero Potion. Warning: The effects from drinking this potion are PERMANENT. This will transform you into a superhero who will possess every super power imaginable without any known weaknesses. This transformation cannot be reversed.”<br />
<br />
“What? A superhero? With no weaknesses at all?” Roy chuckled. <br />
<br />
Roy loved comic books. In fact, he had seven boxes, filled with comic books! This was just too good to be true! He could only dream about what it would be like, to be a mighty, invincible super hero, who could do anything, and have no weaknesses at all. Just the thought of being able to fly, and have the ability to run at super speed and lift heavy things, just made him excited already. Would it really work?<br />
<br />
“Screw it, I’m gonna drink the blue potion…” Roy thought to himself. “Just the thought of being a superhero was so cool…”<br />
<br />
Roy unscrewed the cap of the bottle and drank all of it in one, long gulp!<br />
<br />
“Yum! That tasted like Gatorade!” he said, as he set the bottle back in the box. <br />
<br />
Just as Roy got up to put the box on his desk, he was suddenly overcome by an intense tingling feeling, which was raging through his entire body!<br />
<br />
“Hey! What’s happening??”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Roy’s chest started to expand while his arms started to grow thicker, due to his increased muscle! His pectorals inflated slightly, making his torso wider. His abdominals pushed out, covering his flat stomach, giving him that “ripped” look. His biceps increased in size right away, making his arms bigger. His legs widened, forcing him to spread them apart some more, while his calves grew more round. Within just a few moments, Roy had gained about twenty pounds of muscle!<br />
<br />
“Man! Where did all these muscles come from?”<br />
<br />
“Next, his clothes began to morph into a strange costume! His white t-shirt suddenly began to stretch tighter around his chest and torso. His pants got tighter and tighter, transforming into tights which were aqua-blue-colored. His chest and torso was also covered by aqua-blue tights, with a gold-colored “R”-logo on the upper right-hand corner. His pants transformed into white briefs and he was suddenly wearing white gloves, which covered his hands almost up to his elbows. The bottom of his pants transformed into long, white boots, covering his legs from his feet up to his knees. Lastly, a long, white cape draped over his shoulders, hanging almost down to his ankles! He looked awesome!<br />
<br />
“Whoa! What… My clothes! I- I look like a superhero!”<br />
<br />
Roy walked over to the mirror and gasped, when he saw his blue-and-white tights, boots, gloves and cape!<br />
<br />
Not only did he look awesome, but he was feeling great! As he was admiring his new costume, his powers slowly started to kick in.<br />
<br />
As he turned his head, he started to see visions, through his eyes. The walls of his room became transparent, and he found himself looking through the next door neighbor’s house! He could see what the boy next door was doing! He turned and saw what the guy across the street was doing! Not only that, but he could clearly hear the entire phone conversation between the lady down the street and her husband, on the cell phone!<br />
<br />
“Oh, man! I’m seeing everything… I hear everything…” Roy thought to himself. “I have to learn what all I can do…”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a white sheet of paper materialized in front of him. He picked it up. Only he could read it, for he needed super-vision to be able to read the white ink which was printed on the white sheet of paper.<br />
<br />
“Use your powers to make your user’s manual appear on your desk. This will tell you how to use your powers!” it read.<br />
<br />
Roy turned towards his desk and pointed his finger at it.<br />
<br />
“I want to see my manual for my powers!” he ordered.<br />
<br />
A blue beam shot from his finger and struck his desk, and a thick book materialized at the spot, where he had aimed the beam using his finger.<br />
<br />
“Wow!” he said, as he walked up to it.<br />
<br />
The paperback book had the title “Roy’s Super Powers” on it. The book was about three inches thick, and it had over 850 pages!<br />
<br />
Roy opened it to page 1 and started reading it at super speed! He flipped through it very quickly, until he read through all 869 pages.<br />
<br />
“Whoohoo! Now, I can go and have me some FUN!” Roy grinned, as he walked towards the hall and then to the balcony. He opened the sliding door and walked outside.<br />
<br />
Finally, he extended his arms and leaped into the sky. He was FLYING!<br />
<br />
With his long, white cape blowing in the wind, Roy took off and started on his maiden flight as a young superhero! He smiled as he looked down at the cars and the people down below, while he soared over the many rooftops. The wind was blowing in his face, but he was thoroughly enjoying it. He was, after all, a real, young, ten year-old superhero!</p>
