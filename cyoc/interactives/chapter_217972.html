<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The smell of sweat and sex filled the locker room. Henry, Greg and Teddy&#39;s fur were all covered in their own juices, but none of them seemed to care. They got out a towel and wiped themselves off as they finished changing into their gym clothes. Steven joined them. A bit of frustration came over him as he pulled his sleeveless shirt down over his impressive chest and it didn&#39;t tear to shreds. Steven was six inches taller than he had been and weighed well over 100 pounds more of pure muscle. He could feel the power underneath his skin. Each flex the bulging muscles would flex showing off their size and strength.<br />
<br />
Greg&#39;s massive gorilla hand landed on Steven&#39;s butt, giving it a squeeze. &quot;You know you can join us next time,&quot; he smiled.<br />
<br />
Steven felt his cock pulse. A thought of pushing the massive gorilla against the locker and taking that loose ass right now flashed through his mind. &quot;I know,&quot; he said, trying his best to lower the sexual tension in the room. &quot;Let&#39;s not do cardio today...&quot; His tone faltered ever so slightly as he looked over his shoulder at Henry and Teddy starting to go at it again made it hard. The much smaller wolf to the horse, was wagging his tail excitedly as Henry ran his hoofed hands through Teddy&#39;s fur. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine...&quot; Greg agreed. His smile faded a bit. The strong smell of sex was still on his mind. And watching Henry and Teddy go at it was getting him worked up again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Steven tapped Greg on the shoulder and led him in the gym. &quot;You can have fun later.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two started stretching in the corner. They were getting some looks, but none of the people in the gym seemed to think they were out of place. Instead, it was clear what was on their mind as they stared. Even some of the jocks who would have never considered it, seemed to have a firm eye on Greg. The subtle nod they tossed him was only obvious to those two.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon,&quot; Steven grunted, pulling the gorilla over to the bench press. &quot;Fun later,&quot; his tone was far more commanding as he started loading up the plates. He and Greg each put two on the bar. 225 lbs tended to be a pretty good warm up and could get their blood pumping. Though, even as he was lifting the 45 pound plates Steven couldn&#39;t help but feel they were unbelievably light. <br />
<br />
He watched Greg lay down onto the bench and then pump out 12 reps like it was nothing. &quot;Yo... Is this right?&quot; Greg asked.<br />
<br />
Steven stood over him and grabbed the bar. He repped it a couple of times. &quot;Woah...&quot; he muttered watching his biceps flexed. Somehow it felt like almost nothing. Each rep was almost easier than the last. It was like it was only a ten pound weight in his hand and he could do this all day. &quot;I don&#39;t know man...&quot; he replied. &quot;Let&#39;s just add a few more on.&quot;<br />
<br />
They added two sets of plates on the bar; pushing it up to 405 pounds. Greg laid back down and started pushing it again. &quot;Better,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Steven nodded and took over after Greg finished the set. However, the weight still felt like nothing. &quot;Better?&quot; Steven asked, incredulously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, it&#39;s a warm up,&quot; Greg said. He wasn&#39;t about to show his sweat.<br />
<br />
Steven was already loading up another set of 45 pound plates. Maybe 495 would be better. Greg&#39;s mouth hung agape for a second. &quot;What?&quot; Steven acted innocent. &quot;It&#39;s just a warm up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-right,&quot; Greg dropped back down onto the bench. He could still finish the full set, but was clearly starting to struggle a bit towards the end. Steven helped him get the bar back on the rack. Then took Greg&#39;s place. <br />
<br />
&#39;At least it feels like there&#39;s weight on the bar,&#39; Steven grumbled to himself as he went through the set. Each rep, he could feel his blood pumping a bit faster. Though, it still felt like one of his lighter workouts. He let out an angry sigh through his lion&#39;s nose that almost turned into a growl. Then went for another set of plates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah. Woah. Woah,&quot; Greg tried to stop him. &quot;School said we really shouldn&#39;t be pushing the equipment that hard. Really we shouldn&#39;t have done five without coach around.&quot; Steven didn&#39;t listen as he loaded up the bar with two more plates. &quot;Hey! Are you listening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be a fucking pussy,&quot; Steven bared his teeth. Greg took a step back. Steven nodded at his submission and laid down on the bench again. Greg took his spot as the spotter and kept his big hands off the bar. Again, Steven pumped out another set. At least this time he could feel the weight, but it still wasn&#39;t enough. &quot;Go find me two more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But--&quot; Greg cut himself off as he saw Steven&#39;s glare. He hopped to, speeding off to find more weights. <br />
<br />
Steven couldn&#39;t believe himself. He&#39;d always thought three plates was too much. That had been his max. But now? Now it was nothing. Barely even a proper bicep workout, let alone a chest. He flexed his arms watching the massive muscles on his body bulge. Each one was built like a bodybuilder&#39;s but far larger than any of them could have ever dreamed. &#39;The eggs,&#39; he chuffed to himself a smile grew on his maw. It had to be something about the eggs. With each additional one he turned more and more into the powerhouse he was right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck...&quot; he breathed as his cock throbbed. &quot;I need to make more...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Greg asked as he came back with two more 45 pound plates.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got something I gotta do,&quot; Steven said. Greg&#39;s eyes lowered to see a massive tent in Steven&#39;s shorts. The lion tried to smooth it down. It didn&#39;t work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well--&quot;<br />
<br />
Steven glared. &quot;Not with you,&quot; he stated firmly. Then headed for the locker room and got changed. Teddy and Henry were still having plenty of fun down there. He gave the horseman a slap on his ass and headed back to his dorm.</p>
