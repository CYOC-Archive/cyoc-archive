<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the carriage parks, you are helped out if it by the masked man. You wonder how such a person can be so lecherous and yet also such a gentleman at the same time. He holds your hand gently and closes the door behind you. The other dog is already out of the carriage and is sitting beside you patiently. You still have your tail wagging behind you and are also waiting for the man. You know that when he said &quot;Stay&quot; he wasn&#39;t directing it to you, but you still feel compelled to obey it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, shall we? And don&#39;t wander about on your own so.&quot; Says the masked man. He offers you his arm and you reluctantly accept it. He then escorts you around the town, showing you various things and sights. If it were any other situation, this could easily be considered as a date. But you don&#39;t feel that way about this man, right? It&#39;s true that he is responsible for your curse and torments you, but he also takes care of you too. You stop thinking about it and just enjoy the sight seeing. <br />
<br />
No one says anything negative about you having a tail either, which is weird. Having people compliment it, even though it should be considered weird is weird for you. But many people, mainly other women, have said things about it. You worry that if this goes on, that you will become accustomed to having it 24/7. It is quite cute though. <br />
<br />
You get to a point where you are quite enjoying yourself and wander aimlessly for a bit by yourself while the masked man is buying something. Someone grabs your hand and pulls you down an alleyway without warning. You try to make a sound, but are stopped by a hand covering your mouth. You look behind you at your captor only to feel suddenly relieved to see that it is the masked man himself. &quot;Didn&#39;t I tell you not to wander off alone?&quot; <br />
<br />
The masked man let&#39;s go of you and sits you down on a barrel. &quot;Look, if it were to have been anyone else, they would be long gone by now and I wouldn&#39;t be able to find them easily. You are not by any means ugly Princess. You are attractive enough to draw gazes, many from those who you would rather not notice you out and about alone. You don&#39;t know this enough yet, and I understand it being an adjustment for you. But you need to remember that this is you from now on&quot; scolds the masked man while showing you your reflection. You understand what he means. You are a woman now. And like it or not, some people will try and take advantage of that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Luckily, you also have a benefit to being such a pretty one. Since you are so pretty, not many would easily abandon you if you manage to cause a fuss and draw attention to yourself somehow. So if you ever have to, try doing that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have said that from the beginning though. Why go so far as scarring me like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t forget it as easily this way.&quot; He says with a shrug. He then tosses a bag at you, which you catch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Trying to bribe me for forgiveness?&quot; You say with a smirk, then you see what he gave you and you begin forgiving him unintentionally. You put the good tasting meat in your mouth and begin chewing it immediately. The man takes your hand again and you resume your outing. &quot;I can&#39;t always be bribed with food like this okay&quot; you mutter, though your tail is wagging happily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really, don&#39;t dogs usually forgive after being fed good meat though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... well... um.... Shut up! I&#39;m not <i>that</i> much of a dog!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But at least now you can acknowledge that you are partially like one&quot; retorts the masked man with a laugh. He then stops teasing you for a while. However what he said sits with you as you have already started noticing it too after all, that you basically are getting trained by him, and use to being like this. Even now you consider your tail just a part of you, and no longer some weird addition.<br />
<br />
That night you wind up having a really weird dream, only to be woken up by the other dog licking at your blackened and wet nose. You realize you have gone into full dog mode in your sleep and are now being comforted by your bed mate. You sigh and lick him back as thanks instead of petting him with half paw-hands, as doing so is easier for you right now than the latter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it, why do you have to be like this?&quot; You ask him rhetorically, seeing his erection. You really want it inside of you, but you also know that you really don&#39;t. Desperately before you succumb to your urges, you get up and move over to where the masked man is currently sleeping, hop up onto the cushioned bench, then curl up behind his back. You fully intend to ride this one out for the full hour. The man then pets you and you melt for half a minute until he falls back asleep. <br />
<br />
It is quite a struggle, but you finally manage to make it the full hour and return back to normal. Well, as normal as you can get it. You still wind up with a tail almost instantly, as all it takes is just a little more than a perverted thought to trigger its appearance. Something nearly impossible for you to not have after spending an hour in an extremely horny state. <br />
<br />
At least by now you are quite use to having it, and actually have kind of started enjoying having it, as it makes you look a bit cuter in your opinion. Though whom you ate trying to look cute for is still up for debate. You keep telling yourself that it is only for yourself, but you know that that isn&#39;t fully correct. A bit of it is for the other dog for some unknown reason. And for another reason you don&#39;t wish to admit, its for the Masked Man as well, since he seems to like seeing you with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I finally made it through without fucking anything!&quot; You happily cheer to the Masked man as you both are having breakfast. He just smirks at you and replies &quot;You know, no one ever said that you needed to not fuck anything. If you want to do it, then just do it. The dog should pretty much always be up for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not the right response to my accomplishment!&quot; You shout. You then sit back down and ask &quot;So, what are today&#39;s plans?&quot;</p>
