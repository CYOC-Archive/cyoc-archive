<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Felicity stomped away from the lab, she hated going there and being treated like a test subject. <br />
<br />
“She’s been like this for days, you think a future Normal board member would act more proper.” Dr. Chapman said adjusting his own prim and proper attire.<br />
<br />
“She’s a teenager, she’s going to act out and be all moody. I know I was like her when I was her age, remember the Lolita Virus made me look like a little girl, I’m in my 40s.” Dr Eastly said.<br />
<br />
“So when do you estimate full maturity?” The other  scientist asked.<br />
<br />
“Despite what I told the board I’m not sure yet, we have to continue treatments in order to advance the subject’s age. Maybe a week give or take.” She responded.<br />
<br />
<br />
Felicity’s body had quickly aged to a teenager of 16, along with the hormones and angst. She seemed to hate everything now; her stupid uniform, her quarters, her lessons with Choon Hee, her lack of freedom, she couldn’t remember the last time she was allowed to to go out without armed escorts. Everything seemed unfair and lame, plus her body was becoming curvier and she started to feel self conscious about her appearance. She was already a c-cup and just knew she was going to end up with large d’s, as if it wasn’t going to be hard enough to command respect.<br />
<br />
 She wished she could have slammed her quarters’ door behind her but it was a high tech sliding door so she resigned herself to slamming the control panel.<br />
Felicity ripped off her uniform tie and threw her jacket across the room, she flipped off the camera and blasted music from her stereo. The blonde still had to wear a school uniform and she hated it, she thought it was to remind her of her lower status as if to remind her that she wasn’t old enough to be independent or trusted. She didn’t braid her hair in pigtails anymore, her long blonde hair was messy with her bangs covering one of her eyes. Despite having many beauty lessons with the kumiho, she only wore eyeliner with dark blue eye shadow and blue pained nails. She managed to steal a pair of converse sneakers so she wouldn’t have to wear the dorky Mary Jane’s anymore and, unlike the others at the Normal, she didn’t tuck her shirt into her pleated skirt and left the top three buttons of her shirt undone. <br />
<br />
Felicity begrudgingly finished her homework but when she dropped her pencil she concentrated. A small dark clout formed around her arm and a shadowy tendril appeared, it stretched and wrapped around the pencil. With some effort she retracted the shadow and returned the pencil to her hand.<br />
The blonde felt a headache set in. Ever since her rebirth a dark energy inhabited her body, slowly she was learning to control it; currently all she could do was crate shadow tendrils but was yet to be able to pick up anything heavier than a tennis ball. The only other skill she created was covering herself with the shadowy darkness, it offered no defense but allowed her to blend in with the shadows. The latter did allow her to sneak around the facility at night, that’s where she got her sneakers and snacks from.<br />
Then her thought’s turned to the attempted escape a few days ago, she didn’t know what her younger self was thinking, her teenage mind was pissed off that she listened to him like a scared little girl. Felicity’s teenage mind had convinced her that the Boss was her warden just like the rest of her jailers, he may have good intentions and intended to help her but her rebellious mind told her otherwise; it fed her thoughts and dreams of freedom and to put up a middle finger to the authorities in her life.<br />
The Boss had assured her that she would be able to rejoin the board, she knew it still wouldn’t be easy. The rest of the men would make things difficult for her and she would have to work extra hard to earn respect.<br />
<br />
“Fuck the board and fuck the Boss!” She said in angst.<br />
<br />
Felicity went to the canteen and idly rolled an orange on the table between her hands. She wasn’t hungry but this was one of the only places she was currently allowed to go, her teenage mind scoffed at the stupid restrictions like her schedule. The blonde watched Normal agents and facility staff come and go, most didn’t pay her any mind besides the sideways glance at her unruly appearance. She didn’t care what they thought and made sure they knew she didn’t care by rolling her eyes or flipping them off. Her teenage mind had made her resent her circumstances and the Normal, temporarily forgetting about her goals to rejoin the board. <br />
<br />
“Hello Miss Monroe, finished your studies already?” Choon Hee said more than asked. <br />
<br />
Felicity noticed the kumiho’s more dressier appearance and the woman took notice and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Certain board meetings require us to get dolled up more than usual, especially when the Boss is in attendance.” She said as she sat down with her legs crossed like a proper lady.<br />
<br />
Choon Hee made a point to move more deliberately as she sat to demonstrate the proper way for a lady to sit. She gave a look at how the blonde girl sat, slouched over with her legs spread wider than what was appropriate for a young lady.<br />
The teenage girl rolled her eyes and leaned back and closed her legs slightly.<br />
<br />
“Slightly better, but you will learn to sit like a lady, you don’t want to expose yourself to your subordinates when you are the head of The One Humanity.” She explained.<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about? There’s no way that dick, Cameron, is going to let me run things over there.” The teen huffed in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid Mr. Bridges will no longer be occupying that position. The Boss has declared you as the head of the One Humanity, once you’ve finished maturing that is.” She continued, “next week you will be officially announced as the new head of The One Humanity, I already picked out your wardrobe for that day and will be working with a team of stylists to make sure you are perfect!” She smiled.<br />
<br />
Part of Felicity’s brain was overjoyed at the announcement, she would finally have everything she wanted. But the new teenage part of her wasn’t happy, it continued to deceive her and told her that they had already decided everything for her, she would be their puppet. These conflicting thoughts spun in her head and she didn’t know what to think or believe anymore. <br />
The woman seemed to sense this inner turmoil and sat next to the girl, putting one arm around the girl while the other brushed her blonde hair from her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Are you alright Miss Monroe? If you’re not feeling well we could have Dr. Eastly take a look at you, maybe some re-education therapy would help you think more…clearly?” The Asian woman asked in a soft tone that did nothing to soothe the young girl.<br />
<br />
“N-No. I’m fine.” The blonde responded and moved away from the woman.<br />
<br />
“Alright, if you say so. If you want I can schedule a meeting with someone to explain your role as head of the One Humanity and what it is you’ll be doing there. After our beauty lesson of course.” The kumiho said.<br />
<br />
“S-Sure, that sounds good.” Felicity replied and motioned for her guards to take her back to her room.</p>
