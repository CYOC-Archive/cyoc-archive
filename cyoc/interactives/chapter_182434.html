<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been a week since Madeline Booker and turned into Mitchell Booker and it hadn’t been all that bad. The girls in the school loved him and he’d already fucked three of them. They all rode his dick happily and would pretty much do anything to get his new penis inside them. He’d been blown, gotten a titjob, felt up nice and soft breasts, and gotten his fill of how the other half lived. Unfortunately there hadn’t been a connection or spark with any of the girls. They were just fuck buddies, not girlfriends. He wanted a girlfriend but hadn’t felt anything like that since Liam.<br />
<br />
He saw his old boyfriend every day at basketball practice, he saw the dick he used to ride in the showers all the time, completely flaccid and not at all aroused by his new form, and he listened to that voice, no longer talking sweetly to him and instead just chattering about who knows what. They were both single so girls kept flirting with the two of them, Liam would even describe a girl’s body for Mitchell, claiming he should accept Penny Lockheed’s advanced because she was so flexible it made sex all the better.<br />
<br />
The sex was fun and all but Mitchell kind of wanted a real relationship again. He wanted to find a girl he loved just as much as he’d loved Liam when he’d been a girl.<br />
<br />
Well he finally found that girl during a basketball trip. They packed in a bus with the girl’s team and rode a city over to play in a weekend tournament at Barkley, a rival university.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me it’s cold here!” Liam shouted the second they entered the school. Mitchell hardly noticed the chill, he hadn’t even worn a sweater since becoming a man. Liam however pulled the very sweater that had transformed Mitchell out of his bag and pulled it over his body.<br />
<br />
They then set up their sleeping bags and backpacks in a bio lab and went to watch the fist game of the evening. Liam shuddered next to Mitchell, rubbing his arms from the chill and swearing every few seconds. They watched Barkley win its first game, not that Liam could pay much attention, he was so cold he could see his breath and his teeth wouldn’t stop chattering. His head was so cold. He pulled the hood up and sniffled from the chill. That chill left his ears slowly as his black hair began to lengthen under his hood and spill around his ears longer and longer until it began to fall out of his hoodie.<br />
<br />
When they went back to their room to change for their first game Liam pulled back his hood and revealed he had long raven coloured locks of hair spilling from his head. He didn’t even notice and just tied it back in a man bun like he always did. He’d always had long hair, it was unlucky to cut it during sports season and if he did his teammates would kill him.<br />
<br />
Their first game was against DeVry and he was starting lineup. He dribbled the ball past foes, passed it to his teammates, and went up to dunk but found himself falling short. It took a while for that opportunity to present itself again and when it did he came up short again. He tried and tried until a timeout was called and coach ordered him to stop wasting time on dunks. He was too short for that. He wasn’t the six foot one guy he’d been before that game. He was a five foot nine guy and the only reason he was on the starting lineup was his good shot.<br />
<br />
He went back out and just started landing three pointers. Why had he been trying to dunk? He didn’t get it? He’d never been able to dunk. He had to get his head in the game, it was probably off because of how stupidly cold it was. Ugh!<br />
<br />
He was buried under his very large and ill fitting hoodie the second that game was over shivering like it was minus forty and the wind was raging. He ate during that time and found his appetite had shrunk for some reason. He couldn’t finish his burger and fries from the canteen. Barkley had a good canteen, he had intended to eat three or four burgers but there he was unable to even eat a full one.<br />
<br />
They watched Barkley win another game after that and his stupid shoes kept slipping off his feet. Why were they so big? He didn’t get it! It must have been a prank because when he went next door to the girl’s room he found a spare pair of basketball shoes in Diane Wrent’s bag that fit him perfectly. Of course they did, they were his shoes. He’d always been embarrassed by his ladies size shoes and the guys on the team liked to make that worse.<br />
<br />
They were up against Lowland Park next and Liam sat on the bench, ready to hop in at any moment. He’d never been good enough to make starting lineup, unable to keep up with a lot of the larger guys on the team if he had a good enough shot that he was a shoe in for second lineup.<br />
<br />
His uniform was loose during that game, his body frame was too small to fit the jerseys right and when he finally got to play one of the guys from Lowland Park asked why a girl got to play on the guy’s team. Sure he had the body frame of a girl with slim shoulders, a skinny frame, and a distinct lack of hair on his face and chest, but the lack of boobs and the penis between his legs said otherwise. It wasn’t his fault he was born with a small body. The cold was making his nipples hard and he’d always had slight manboobs so the teasing was just all the worse.<br />
<br />
He was so cold after that he didn’t care that his hoodie was two sizes too large. He needed it on and shook under the fabric. Their next game was against Barkley for the gold so he needed his head in the game. But that game would be in the morning so everyone lay down to sleep and he wound up tossing and turning all night. It was so damn cold, it was too cold. He shuddered in that sleeping bag and when he woke up he wanted to do anything but peel himself from that warm sleeping roll.<br />
<br />
They had to get change though and he sighed, slipping from his sleeping bag and stripping down. If it weren’t for the dick between his legs and lack of breasts everyone would have mistook him for a girl. He had the face of a pretty Asian girl with soft lips and thin eyebrows, he had hips that flared outwards in a feminine curve, his waist was like an hourglass, his ass was round and perky, and his voice was high and feminine. More than one guy on the team had questioned their sexuality around him.<br />
<br />
“Come on guys!” Liam shouted from the sidelines. He was a perpetual benchwarmer and only ever got to play when they were either losing horribly or winning by a long shot. Barkley was about their skill level so he wouldn’t be playing at all. Instead he clapped and cheered form the sidelines, failing to notice that his chest was ballooning outwards with every basket they scored. After first period he had a pit of A cups, after second he spotted beautiful B’s, and after third he had a arousing pair of C-cup breasts with round girly nipples. It was coming down to the wire at the end. One more basket would earn them gold and make those c cups grow into globes sized D. Everyone screamed and cheered while Mitchell went up, and with a slam he scored and Liam jumped to his feet, big boobs bouncing on his chest so perfectly shaped they’d make most girls jealous.<br />
<br />
They were given gold medals and the second the game was over a chilly Liam threw his hoodie over his head and shook from head to toe. They then went to watch the girls game and Liam kept shifting uncomfortably as their girls played for gold against Lowland Prep. His dick was getting smaller and smaller, shifting down in size until it sucked into his crotch. Lyra then groaned in annoyance and took off her hoodie, running out across the court and joining the girls. Her uniform changed to match them, shorts shrinking into spandex and a sports bra containing her breasts. She filled the uniform out beautifully and several of the guys stared at her list fully wishing she was their girlfriend. Her beautiful round ass, her pretty Asian face, and her award winning breasts all made their ducks go hard.<br />
<br />
Who didn’t want to bone Lyra Park, captain of the girl’s basketball team? The second she arrived it was over for Lowland Park. They couldn’t keep up with this new girl who could nail a three pointed like it was nothing. She needed to move, she needed to play hard because it was so damn cold in that gym. The only way to stay warm was to work harder and work harder she did. By the time the game ended they’d beaten Lowland Park so savagely that some of the benchwarmers had started to play. Lyra sat on the sidelines getting cold and chilly while awards were handed out. She got a gold medal and posed with her team for pictures before she rushed over to the sidelines for one final change.<br />
<br />
“Hey babe,” her boyfriend Mitchell greeted, tossing her his big comfy hoodie with the last name she one day hoped to have on the back. Lyra Booker had such a nice ring to it, and Mitchell’s hoodies were so warm. She just loved to wear them.<br />
<br />
He liked it when she wore them too, she was so cold all time and looked really good wrapped up in an XXL men’s hoodie. The sight made his dick harden every time without fail. Lyra was cold all the time and he refused to let his girlfriend be cold. That was his job as a boyfriend after all. She probably had seven of his hoodies on her closet by that point but hey, he never got cold so he never wore them anyway. Better to have them on her hot body than laying in his closet unused.<br />
<br />
She was still cold under that hoodie so they cuddled on the bus, his big dark arms wrapped around her petite and curvy body. He radiated heat and she loved that about him. It was like they were meant for one another. She didn’t want his hold on her to end, because his arms were comfier than any of the half dozen sweaters of his she’d stolen.</p>
