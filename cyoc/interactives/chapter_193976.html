<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hey you&#39;re Matt, the guy who rooms with the horse dude, right?” A voice called  from behind him while he was distracted, stopping Matt in his tracks. He was just short enough of library that running now would just cause a scene, so he did his best to suppress an eye roll as he turned around. However, what he saw next made his usual snippy remarks to this sort of question die in his throat.<br />
<br />
Standing for the world to see was a guy almost completely naked except for a large pair of boxers with hearts printed on them. He had his hands on his hips and a large grin on his face as if this was the most natural thing in the world, seemingly oblivious to the cold.<br />
<br />
“Yea?” Matt said cautiously uncertain just what kind of crazy he was about to be sold as his mind came to terms with what he was seeing.<br />
<br />
“Hey perfect, I wasn’t certain since I’ve seen you in class before, but you always stayed quiet. I’m Ethan, a freshman too. Do you have a sec? I could use your help with something. “ Ethan continued sheepishly running a hand through his short blond hair. He really did look like some kind of underwear model at that moment with his swimmer’s build and bright eyes. However, the large tattoo that took up his entire right shoulder gave off a different vibe.<br />
<br />
“Math class, it took me a sec,” Matt said dryly, as if to point out the absurdity of the situation. “Look man, I don’t know what you heard, but I’m not some weirdo, or a saint who other people can come running to. If someone stole your stuff you should call security or something. I’ll lend you my jacket but I want it back.”<br />
<br />
From what Matt could remember this guy was named Ethan lockwell, he normally looked like a low budget hipster in his torn jeans, plaid shirts and beanie. He was usual part of some group of other, he might have even seen him playing the guitar once out where the kids liked to play sports <br />
<br />
“Oh this?” Ethan said as if noticing the state he was in for the first time. “Thanks man, but I’m good it’s pledge week and all that.”<br />
<br />
“I thought hazing was illegal?”<br />
<br />
“Technically it is, that’s why they allowed us underwear, and if we get caught we have to keep our mouths shut.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds like a great place to spend your time,” Matt said, still weirded out by the whole scenario.<br />
<br />
“Yeah not really, but dad’s a legacy and he would only pay for what I want if I followed in his footsteps.”<br />
<br />
“That’s healthy, so what does any of this have to do with me exactly. It’s cold out here.”<br />
<br />
“Right, sorry you have someplace to be I’m sure,” Ethan said apologetically, completely ignoring the secondary meaning. “Listen, I was hoping to get a picture with you.”<br />
<br />
“Excuse you?” Mall said, taken aback.<br />
<br />
“Look, my senior in the frat is being a real dick,  and he wants me to do something to prove myself or else he’s gonna make my life hell. He’s got a real mean streak and has eyes for your roommate.”<br />
<br />
“And there it is!”<br />
<br />
“Hey listen,” Ethan pleaded, “ I get it dude. I’m not looking to cause anyone trouble I swear. That’s why I was hoping to get a picture with you to show that we’re buddies so that I can give him something until I can figure something else out. You’ll have my number too so that if anything happens you can go right to the cops.”<br />
<br />
Matt was far from believing that whatever was gonna happen Ethan’s plans or not, was going to go well for anyone. He was about to shut things down when the weight of his bag reminded him for the second time what he had on hand.<br />
<br />
“Look, I&#39;ll owe both of you a ton for this and I’ll help you guys with whatever. I’m in a band, I can help you guys at the gym. I’m planning on bulking up a bit this summer.” Ethan continued clearly desperate.<br />
<br />
“Fine, but we&#39;ll take the picture now,” Matt finally said, he would get what he needed out of the whole process anyway.<br />
<br />
“Deal, just text it to me afterwards.”<br />
<br />
It took all of two seconds, as Matt set his phone on a nearby bench to get a full body shot. Ethan was in no place to ask questions, and simply slung an arm over Matt’s shoulder with a winning smile. At this distance Matt could tell that Ethan was at least 6’2”, was hiding a few holes  ear piercing, and his tattoo was a step another the stereotypical barbed wire, and more the outline of a Celtic knot.<br />
<br />
“Saving up money to have it finished,” Ethan supplied when he noticed the look.<br />
<br />
With the sound of a soft click from the app signaling the completion of the deed, numbers were  soon exchanged and both boys had what they needed.<br />
<br />
“You’re a good guy, Matt,” Ethan said with a smile completely lacking the means to check the picture.<br />
<br />
 “Yeah just don’t make me regret this,” Matt said, and then they both parted ways with a nod. <br />
<br />
——<br />
<br />
It had been a much longer conversation than Matt had expected. When he had finally recovered enough from that weird interaction he quickly made his way into the library. Once he was properly inside, he made his way through the various stacks of books, and computers from the 80’s, into one of the many small carrels they had hidden away in the back. Picking one of the desks that best hid his computer screen from any passing eyes.<br />
<br />
Setting up his laptop Matt connected his phone and downloaded the picture. Looking at the two of them in the photo Ethan had not seemed like a total jerk, but if he was willing to go that far for a frat he supposedly didn’t even like, then he deserved a fresh perspective. Loading the picture into the Chronivac software was surprisingly easy. At least at first glance. As his computer fan began to kick into high gear it took him a while of messing with the settings but he soon had a 3D image of Ethan in all his glory spinning in front of him.<br />
<br />
“It’s time to find out if I really did buy a piece of junk or not. I just need to figure out what kind of changes I want to make,” he said to himself staring to a sea of options.</p>
