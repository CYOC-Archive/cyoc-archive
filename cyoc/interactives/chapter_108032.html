<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan was not looking forward to choosing his next card, particularly since it seemed there was no limit to what the game might subject them to. While he was hoping that his card might be as innocuous as making Steven lose his underpants, he was more than a little concerned at the effect it had on Jeff. Still, he knew that he needed to stay strong and set a good example for his boys on how to keep a level head in a stressful situation. While he could certainly do without some of Tony&#39;s sass, the boys all seemed to be adjusting to their changes well. Dan reasoned that to far the impacts hadn&#39;t been TOO negative, and if they wrapped the game up quickly then maybe everything would go back to normal. <br />
<br />
Resolutely, Dan picked a card and read it out loud. &quot;Choice: pork [50] or beef [50]&quot; Unclear on what the consequences of such a decision could be, Dan hesitated, trying to decipher what the card could mean. &quot;Ummm...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, Dad, we don&#39;t have all night! Just pick one!&quot; Tony said, eagerly egging him on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright, I guess I&#39;ll have to go with pork.&quot; Dan finally determined. He waited a moment, unsure what the impact of that decision would be. Was he just ordering a meal? Declaring a preference? Would he need to wait until everyone had drawn a card again in order to find out the consequences? A beat passed and it seemed like nothing was going to happen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Steven, why don&#39;t you go ahead and pick a -&quot; *gurgle*<br />
<br />
Dan winced. Suddenly, his stomach felt like it was tying itself in knots and had cut him off in the middle of his sentence. He clutched his stomach tenderly, trying to soothe whatever had suddenly overcome him. <br />
<br />
&quot;You alright, Dad?&quot; Steven asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Dan muttered, still gingerly rubbing his stomach. &quot;Why don&#39;t you keep playing and- URRRP&quot; Dan suddenly let out an enormous belch. In tandem with the rapid gas, he felt a kick from his stomach as it pushed out against his hands. The waistline of his jeans suddenly dug into his sides, as fat which hadn&#39;t been there before begged for release. The tshirt he had for wearing around the house constricted around his new lovehandles and fledgling gut. While it wasn&#39;t a major change, it was certainly noticeable on Dan, who prided himself on avoiding the middleage spread and worked out 5 days a week to keep his body fit and trim. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, Dad, what just happened?&quot; Tony asked, staring in awe at his father&#39;s new gut. Having been teased more than enough times for putting on the freshman 15, twice, during his extended stay in college, he was almost giddy at seeing his father begin to look a little more like him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno, I guess that pork didn&#39;t agree with me. Steven would you pick a ca-URRRRRP&quot; Dan belched again, this time louder and more grotesque. As he was expecting it this time, he was able to actually watch in horror as his body once again ballooned outward. While his stomach certainly barreled forward once more, this time the weight distributed itself across more of his body. , He felt his ass spread out more and wedge him into the seat. While he&#39;d never exactly had chiseled pecs to brag about, his chest bulged and sagged with newfound fat. He could even feel a newfound double chin jiggle a bit as the belch came to an end. He sat there, feeling his newly fat body and panting with exhaustion from the event. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, Dad, your ass is almost as big as mine!&quot; Tony cried, almost in ecstatic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Dad, you&#39;re blowing up!&quot; Jeff added, unsure whether to be more concerned about his father&#39;s newfound heft or how much joy his brother seemed to be taking from it. <br />
<br />
Steven picked up the card his father had drawn. &quot;He&#39;s not blowing up - he&#39;s porking up! It was his choice!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Goddamnit, I knew I shoulda&#39; picked bee-URRRRRP&quot; Dan let out one final, enormous belch. His body surged with fat, easily popping the button off his straining jeans. His shirt rode up over his bulging gut and cradled his rapidly inflating moobs. His widening hips and thick slabs of lovehandles dug themselves firmly into the arms of the chair, wedging him in place as his expansion came to an end. He sat there in stunned silence, surveying the damage that had been done to him and rubbing the expanses of his new, enormous gut. He had easily doubled in weight from only a few moments before, and could hardly believe the difference. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the chair he was sitting in let out a groan and Dan could hardly let out a holler before he went crashing to the floor. Sitting in the shattered remains of the wooden dining room chair, Dan rubbed his sore, fat ass and cried &quot;For Christ&#39;s sake, NOW will you pick a card, Steven?&quot;</p>
