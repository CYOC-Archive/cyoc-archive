<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gavin, Aster, and Dean we’re walking down the street. All three were high school age, seniors in fact. They lived on the same street in three house each next to each other, as they had for their whole lives. <br />
<br />
Gavin was short, only about 5 foot. He was surprisingly sticky however. He wrestled for the school team and was very good at it. <br />
<br />
Aster was next in height, a nice 5 and a half feet. He played soccer, but was on the verge of being kicked from the team due to poor performance. <br />
<br />
Dean was the tallest at 6 door. He was extremely thin and played no sports but had habitually been friends with Aster and Gavin. <br />
<br />
In a park not far from their neighborhood, the three friends sat on a bench, one something fell seemingly out of the sky onto Aster’s lap. Aster let out a cry of surprise and jumped up. <br />
<br />
“Are you ok Aster?” Gavin asked standing up. <br />
<br />
“Yeah I’m fine,” Aster said before Dean could say anything. He leaned over and picked up a small piece of paper with something inside. <br />
<br />
“There’s no one around,” Dean said looking about. <br />
<br />
“This paper is odd,” Aster said. He held up a small blue crystal in one hand and held the paper to his face. “It has writing on it.”<br />
<br />
“Read it then,” Dean said, still suspiciously looking around. <br />
<br />
“With this sapphire in head,” Aster started. <br />
<br />
“In hand?” Gavin said. <br />
<br />
“No it says in head,” Aster said. “People don’t know expressions.”<br />
<br />
“Continue,” Dean said. <br />
<br />
“With this sapphire in head,” Aster began again. “The beholder can swap or transfer or even steal whatever they wish. Just will it and it will happen. Only those who read or hear this message will be able to recall the changes. Have fun!”<br />
<br />
In a burst of light, the paper exploded into flames causing he boys to jump backwards. The gem in Aster’s hand shook violent and the boys witnessed it jump out of Aster’s grasp and jam into his forehead. <br />
<br />
Water screamed but then stopped. <br />
<br />
“It doesn’t hurt actually,” Aster said. <br />
<br />
“It’s digging into your head though Aster,” Gavin said. He reached up and grabbed it with his hands and pulled, but to no avail. Both fell to the ground, and by the time they stood up, the gem had sunk all the way into Aster’s head. <br />
<br />
“We should get a doctor,” Dean said quickly. “Gavin isn’t your mother a nurse?”<br />
<br />
“I’m fine guys,” Aster said. He patted his forehead, it felt fine and no different. <br />
<br />
“What about that message?” Gavin asked. “Steal, transfer or swap? Is your magic crystal telling you anything?”<br />
<br />
“Well let’s try something,” Aster said. “I want to steal that tire over there.”<br />
<br />
He waved his hands ominously and nothing happened. <br />
<br />
“I’d like to swap my phone for his,” Aster said laughing now as he pointed to a man across the park. <br />
<br />
“And I’d love to transfer his muscles to me,” Aster said, now barely able to speak a coherent sentence as he pointed at a jogger. <br />
<br />
Suddenly Aster felt awful, all over his body. The jogger also began to move his legs in a strange jogging crab walk as he began to move towards the boys. <br />
<br />
Dean and Gavin looked at the fast approaching man and then at Aster who seemed to be becoming sick. They tried to grab Aster, but not even Gavin could wrench him off of his spot. They sprinted a few yards away as he man stopped in front of Aster, the two now facing each other<br />
<br />
Each man’s clothes were ripped off entirely by some sort of massive force, to Aster’s dismay and the joggers seeming unawareness. <br />
<br />
Their arms suddenly stretched out and grasped each other merging into one another, their feet doing the same. Each of the men’s pecs suddenly outstretched from their positions like long snakes, and their abs did the same, combine with each other. Their dicks each jumped at each other and, like the the rest of the now snake like structures that attached the rest of the two bodies, combined. <br />
<br />
Aster screamed, but he man simply bobbed his head to a rhythm as if nothing was happening. A man walking his dog by didn’t seem to care either. <br />
<br />
The jogger seemed to be getting smaller, at least his muscles were. Conversely, Aster was getting larger and his muscles bigger. The snake like structures insulated muscle from the jogger into Aster. Soon, the jogger looked like a husky of his former self and Aster was now as tall as Dean but as muscular and strong as Gavin. Each of the conjoined appendages abruptly broke off, and like magic, each of the mens’ clothes flew into their respective owners. <br />
<br />
The jogger did his similar crab walk jog back to the path and continued jogging albeit slower. His clothes sagged and looked far too big on him as he faded from view. <br />
<br />
Aster collapsed from where he stood. His clothes were now tight, exposing all of his new muscle and as he stood back up, one could see large portions of his ankles and a bit of his bow muscular stomach peaking out from his clothes. <br />
<br />
Dean and Gavin cautiously crept closer. <br />
<br />
“I...I’m fine,” Aster said. “Actually I’m better than fine.”<br />
<br />
“That looked painful dude,” Gavin said staring at Aster. <br />
<br />
“No,” Aster replied. “Just shocking, that’s all.”<br />
<br />
“We should try some more,” Dean said, now that Aster was fine. <br />
<br />
“Yes, let’s,” Aster said scanning the park.</p>
