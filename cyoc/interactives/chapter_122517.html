<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harry had to work fast. The chronivac was such a good opportunity... he had a moment of weakness that he needed to see through.<br />
<br />
Clicking scan, the Chronivac found another person in the house. Ethan.<br />
<br />
Age: 22 years, 65 days, 2 hours, 58 minutes, 03 seconds.<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Height: 6&#39;<br />
Weight: 172 Lbs<br />
Bodyfat Percentage: 16.90%<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t care about physical changes right now.  He scrambled to the mental change section, his eyes racing over the content.  Finding a check box that stated simply &quot;Make unaware&quot;. The description saying that if checked, the target would see the next change not as new, or that it wasn&#39;t ordinary. They&#39;d come to think that it was a part of themselves, and had been for as long as they remembered.  Harry checked the box quickly and went back to scanning the box. Eventually finding the section he was looking for.  &quot;Kinks&quot;.  A nervous smile crawled over his face as he added a new option. His chubby fingers typing. &quot;Weight Gain&quot;<br />
<br />
He hammered the accept key hard, then tabbed away from Ethan&#39;s window.  In the other room, Ethan felt...odd...for a moment. His mind whirring as it made room for a new fetish in his brain.  As he dug through clothes, his mind started to wander. He couldn&#39;t believe his luck! All those years reading gainer fiction... and suddenly Harry had bloated out into a total tub! He didn&#39;t care how it happened, how it was even possible. All he knew was that he wanted to see more. Watch Harry adjust to his new obesity. He was half hard just thinking of it.<br />
<br />
Back at the computer, Harry was staring at his own window again. If that worked, Ethan was unaware of the change. He&#39;d feel like he&#39;d always been into seeing people getting fatter... and honestly, Harry still didn&#39;t feel big. Not... BIG big anyway. He didn&#39;t hear Ethan coming back yet...  He went right back to his weight options, seeing a flashing &quot;complete&quot; and an okay to dismiss it. The number 450 there in bold.  He clicked the final weight box once more, and decided to go whole hog. 450 was small. He wanted...no...needed to experience what it was like to be gigantic.<br />
<br />
Three short taps on the keyboard. 7. 5. 0.  He felt nervous, his heart racing slightly, as he hovered over the accept button. The timers set again. Ready to go.  He heard Ethan leave the bedroom, and in a panic, he clicked accept before minimizing the window.  He felt that weird tingle again. A moan escaped his lips just as Ethan came into view.<br />
<br />
Harry&#39;s already plump body started to change in front of him.  His belly piled higher on his lap. His thighs formed a roll, pressed together.  His chest sagged heavier into two swollen, pillowy masses as his nipples stretched out.  Ethan dropped the clothes he&#39;d found, his eyes wide as he watched his once average neighbor spiral further into obesity. His cock getting hard, straining the fly of his jeans as he tried to estimate how big the man in front of him was getting.  Harry&#39;s face got rounder. Creases formed at his wrists, his ankles, as the fat over the joints bulged out.<br />
<br />
His chubbier hand went to his swelling gut in mock confusion... and again, as quickly as it started... it stopped. &quot;Fuck... not more...&quot; Harry panted out, trying to maintain the illusion that this was beyond his control. His sides were spilling over the arms of his chair. He was a pile of dough, struggling to his feet.  It was a lot harder than he expected.  Ethan rushed to his side and muttered out. &quot;Shit...you&#39;ve gotta be... 550 at least. You&#39;re getting massive...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry looked as worried as he could manage &quot;550? Are you serio-&quot; He said, before being interrupted by the tingling again. Another moan... and again his body started to inflate. The timers were short this time, less than a minute between changes. The pad of fat on his groin got heavier, pressing into thighs that touched all the way to his knee, his ass widened, his rolls thickened and bunched up.  His fat chest making a huge roll around to nearly the middle of his back. Ethan&#39;s body pressed against his, feeling his skin stretching and the flab beneath swelling. He could feel Harry getting heavier as he tried to help him balance.<br />
<br />
Harry was getting...tired.  Breathing heavy.  He didn&#39;t totally expect this weight to make his feet hurt or his back ache... Again, the weight stopped. Harry was looking enormous. Sweat was forming on his brow, and Ethan was the most turned on he&#39;d been in years. &quot;Shit, that&#39;s gotta be another 100 pounds.&quot; He said, trying to keep it under his breath. All the years of looking at fat guys online that he could now remember were helping him estimate pretty close to the truth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan...I..I gotta sit down or something.&quot; Harry said as he took a deep breath.  Ethan nodded and looked around the room.  The computer chair was too small, and that Ikea couch might not be able to hold up this much man... &quot;Come on, You can rest in your bed.&quot; Ethan said as he helped Harry waddle along, feeling a guilty thrill as his hand sunk deep into a roll, and he felt the jiggling, jello like consistency of his friends body. They had barely taken 3 steps when the tingling came back.  Harry moaned low as his body swelled again. The excess weight making every step feel like a chore.  He didn&#39;t have the muscle or the athleticism to back all this up. He could move on his own if he wanted, he was sure, but it would be like running a marathon if he tried.<br />
<br />
Sweat was already dripping down his forehead. His huge body wasn&#39;t meant for the summer heat. Ethan was getting a hell of a workout keeping his now morbidly obese friend moving. His eyes tracing every jiggling, quaking curve of his body. Unaware he licked his lips as he watched Harry&#39;s gut sag heavier, and he took in a full breath. Getting him down the hall was a challenge. They could both just barely fit, and it was getting narrower as Harry&#39;s weight crested 700. <br />
<br />
Ethan darted into the bedroom first so he could help guide harry in. He was wincing with every step as his feet ached. The last three steps to the bed felt as long as the whole walk here. Ethan guided him down onto the bed, which now felt small as his body nearly reached each edge. He was sweaty, hot, gasping for air, and his heart was racing, and still, somewhere under that huge gut, he was hard as a rock.<br />
<br />
Ethan&#39;s mouth had gone dry, unable to really form a thought. He stared at the panting blob of a man Harry had become, and felt a guilty excitement, using the jogging pants he&#39;d found before to hide the bulge in his own jeans.</p>
