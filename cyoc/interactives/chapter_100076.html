<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two goat creatures stared at Evelyn curiously. There didn&#39;t seem to be much intelligence within their rectangular pupils, but Evelyn could tell there was plenty of lust in them considering how the female&#39;s crotch glistened and the male&#39;s penis was erect. Evelyn wasn&#39;t sure why they&#39;d come after her and not just mate with each other. If anything, the female should be acting jealous that the male was showing interest in her. But Evelyn had no interest in letting either of them put a hand or hoof on her.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the goat creatures came at Evelyn. They came from different sides, showing they at least had some capacity for intelligence if not full sentience. Evelyn waved the shampoo at the male and flailed her other arm at the female. She managed to smack them a few times, but they seemed to be determined to get to her. Evelyn got more desperate as they got closer to her, hitting harder in hopes of driving the two of them away. If only she had a more effective weapon than just a bottle of shampoo.<br />
<br />
The goat man seemed to be getting annoyed with being smacked in the face with a shampoo bottle. His arms were reached out to grab her, but he was moving his head to avoid being struck by the bottle. Then he lowered his head and brought his horns up to knock the bottle out of her hands. Instead of hitting her fingers, his hard horns hit the bottle with considerable force. But the bottle wasn&#39;t knocked out. Instead, it cracked open and caused a considerable amount of shampoo to leak out. The goat man bleated with irritation as the shampoo covered quite a lot of its head, running down into his eyes. He shook his head and brought up his arms to wipe the stuff off, causing globs of shampoo to fly everywhere. Evelyn had already gotten quite a bit of shampoo on her hand from the broken bottle and now more was being splattered in her face and onto the she-goat as well. Evelyn took advantage of the confusion to drop the bottle and smear her hand across the she-goat&#39;s face, getting shampoo in her eyes as well. The she-goat bleated and tried to wipe it out. Now that both goat creatures were temporarily blinded, Evelyn shoved the male out of the way and ran out of the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Evelyn should have ran out of the house and away from the goat creatures, but fear overrode rational thought. She ran for the bathroom and locked herself in. The goat creatures might be able to butt their way in, but Evelyn was sure she was safe for right now. Perhaps once they&#39;ve wiped the soap from their eyes, they&#39;ll decide she&#39;s too much trouble and move on. For now, Evelyn was locked in the bathroom, splattered with shampoo globs. The last part she could at least do something about as she went over to the sink. She turned the water on and started washing the shampoo off her hands. She&#39;ll probably need a shower, but that could wait until the goat creatures leave.<br />
<br />
Just then, she felt an odd tingling through the entire lower half of her body. She ignored it for a while, but the tingling began to intensify. As she moved, she could feel hair brushing against the inside of her pants. She could have sworn she had shaved her legs earlier, it couldn&#39;t be time to shave them again. And this felt like more hair than she normally had. Her feet felt very numb even though they were tingling. She had taken off her socks and shoes earlier so she was able to look down at her feet without obstruction. To her shock, thick black hair was growing over them and the toes were becoming covered in a hard black material. What was going on here? Did those goat creatures did something to her? How could they, she definitely hadn&#39;t been bitten or anything. And yet her upper body didn&#39;t feel any different at all, no tingling or anything. She glanced at the mirror to see if anything was different and she didn&#39;t notice that her ears were pointier and hairier until she looked closely. She also felt like something was moving under her scalp.<br />
<br />
Just then, something pounded on the door, making Evelyn literally jump. She didn&#39;t notice that when she landed, she was standing on the balls of her feet, more precisely on her hardened toes. The pounding continued, but it sounded more like someone trying to get her attention than an attempt to break the door down. &quot;Heeeelp meeee...&quot; a voice half-talked/half-bleated on the other side. It was definitely a male voice and one that sounded vaguely familiar. It also sounded pained when caused a bit of pity to touch Evelyn&#39;s heart. Maybe the goat man wasn&#39;t as dangerous as she thought. She walked over to the door and opened it slowly, her gait adjusting to walking on hooves.<br />
<br />
The goat man was leaning against the door frame, his head almost completely covered in suds which apparently were from his attempts to get the shampoo off of him. Evelyn also noticed that the fur on his upper body had diminished quite a lot, making it appear almost human. Evelyn could barely make out any details of his head under all the suds. &quot;You poor thing,&quot; she said, &quot;Here, let&#39;s wash that off.&quot; She took the goat man&#39;s arm and guided him to the shower. She turned on the water and started working on washing off all the suds. As the soap washed off, she could see that the goat man&#39;s torso and arms were almost completely bare of fur. Granted, there was quite a lot hair still there, but that just made him look a particularly virile man, especially with the toned muscles revealed underneath. Evelyn squirmed, starting to feel a little uncomfortable in her pelvic area. She was getting a bit excited near this masculine goat, but she also felt a pain in her backside. She absently unfastened her pants and pulled them down, revealing black fur under her waist and a goat&#39;s tail above her ass.<br />
<br />
It took a bit of scrubbing to get all the soap off the goat man&#39;s head. He must have been more covered in shampoo than Evelyn had thought. But as she cleared away the last of them, she could that the goat man&#39;s face had drastically changed. All the hair on it was gone except for a goatee and his muzzle had shrank until it was flat against his face. Evelyn watched in fascination as his mouth and nose pulled away from each other and started to take on more human proportions. And as his face became more human, Evelyn was able to recognize it. &quot;Adam?!&quot; she said in surprise.<br />
<br />
Adam rubbed the soap out of his eyes and looked at her. &quot;Evelyn?&quot; he asked, also looking quite surprised. Evelyn wondered what Adam was staring at until she felt her ear flick. She rushed back to the mirror and looked at herself. Her face hadn&#39;t changed, but now she had very noticeable pair of goat ears and horns. She noticed the black fur at her waist and pulled her pants and panties down, revealing that her legs were covered with the stuff. She was a goat from the waist down, with hooves, tail, and everything. She looked back at Adam and saw he was basically the same way: human above, goat below, with the goat&#39;s ears and horns. They looked like satyrs right out of Greek mythology.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adam, what happened to us?&quot; asked Evelyn in astonishment as she felt her ears and horns to see if they were real.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Adam as he stepped out of the shower, &quot;The last thing I recall was washing Greta then I felt numb in the head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Somebody call me?&quot; asked a voice. Evelyn turned to see another satyr in the door. This one was obviously the she-goat, but now her upper body looked almost completely human. From the waist up, she was actually a very attractive woman. She had a tight waist, flat abdomen, and large breasts. Her face was actually very pretty even though her hair was an unusual white and she still had her goat ears and horns.<br />
<br />
Evelyn blinked and asked, &quot;Greta?&quot; The white-furred satyress smiled and nodded. Evelyn&#39;s mind raced as she tried to think of an explanation. &quot;Wait, Adam washed you with the shampoo which turned you and him half-goat/half-human. Then we got splattered with the stuff and that made us all one-third goat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That seems as likely an explanation as any,&quot; said Greta as she felt herself over with her hands, &quot;I have to say, you humans do have nice forms. And it&#39;s definitely better to be able to think of things besides eating, sleeping, and mating.&quot; She rubbed her breasts and gave a small moan, &quot;Not that mating doesn&#39;t seem like a bad thing right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evelyn licked her lips a little. She was a little bit bi, but she hadn&#39;t an opportunity or a reason to look at another woman that way. But now this milk goat-turned satyress was rubbing herself right in front of her. She could feel her own nipples starting to perk up, her pussy getting moist.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s quite a looker, isn&#39;t she?&quot; asked Adam&#39;s voice behind her. She looked back and saw that Adam was also looking at Greta but also looking at Evelyn, his goat dick fully erect again. Evelyn had been repulsed about the goat man using his dick on her, but now that she knew he was Adam, she felt rather curious now.<br />
<br />
Evelyn removed her shirt and bra and gave herself one look in the mirror. She made a rather sexy satyress herself. Her body was just as toned and shapely as Greta&#39;s. In fact, aside from the face that her hair and fur were black and Greta&#39;s was white, they looked very much alike. She turned to Adam and said, &quot;I&#39;ve heard that satyrs are very wild and passionate lovers.&quot; She reached out and stroked his dick, eliciting a moan from Adam. &quot;How about we put that to the test?&quot; asked Evelyn lustfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not doing anything without me, are you?&quot; asked Greta as she walked up behind Evelyn and pressed her breasts into Evelyn&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
Evelyn moaned as Greta&#39;s hands went up and down her sides. &quot;I don&#39;t think Adam would object to a threesome, right?&quot; asked Evelyn.<br />
<br />
Adam grinned widely and said, &quot;Always wanted to be in one.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Some time later, Evelyn was moaning loudly as she rode Adam&#39;s cock. Adam was lying down on his bed with a satyress at either end. While Evelyn&#39;s pussy was around his cock, Greta&#39;s pussy was in front of his mouth. He licked at the she-goat&#39;s netherlips, having little trouble with the white fur around it. Greta moaned loudly as Adam pleasured her. Her large breasts bounced a little from his eager ministrations. That interested Evelyn more than enough to lean forward and latch her mouth over one of Greta&#39;s nipple. She suckled eagerly, tasting sweet goat milk on her tongue. Greta moaned louder until she eventually pulled Evelyn&#39;s head back so she could taste Evelyn&#39;s breasts. The former milk goat was surprisingly adept at teasing Evelyn&#39;s nipples with her mouth. Evelyn almost wished that her own breasts were filled with milk, but this felt too good to put any serious thought into it. Then Greta raised her head and placed her lips against Evelyn&#39;s. The satyresses&#39; moans were partially muffled by their kissing. They moved closer to each other, their breasts rubbing against each other. Below them, Adam still labored to pleasure their pussies. Watching the attractive goat women make out above certainly drove him to work faster.<br />
<br />
Then with a chorus of moans and bleats, they finally came. Evelyn could feel Adam pumping so much seed into her as her pussy clenched around him. Greta&#39;s pussy also let out a small deluge which Adam eagerly lapped up. The three of them panted for a bit before Evelyn asked, &quot;Again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get his dick this time,&quot; said Greta. The two of them switched placed and lowered themselves down. Adam didn&#39;t protest. He was still hard and ready. The three of them obviously had libidos that took a while to satisfy and they weren&#39;t going anywhere until the satyrs were sated.</p>
