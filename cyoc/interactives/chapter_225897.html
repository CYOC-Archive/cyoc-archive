<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucy smiles, “I’m glad you feel comfortable, Jeff,” she says, “but, you can’t go to school in just a t-shirt and diaper. You’ll catch a cold, so you’d need to wear something to cover your legs and feet.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “yeah, I’d really don’t want to get sick,” he says, “but… what should I wear? I mean… you know I hate wearing those tight uncomfortable Jeans,” the diapered teen eyes his Jean with disgust.<br />
<br />
Lucy chuckles, “I know, but, I’d need you to put them on,” she says, then quickly adds, when seeing Jeff’s shocked expression, “I promise you’ll feel better in a second. Trust me!”<br />
<br />
Jeff looks down at his jeans, ‘I hate those things,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I hate ALL of my clothes… they are so uncomfortable. But, I should listen to Lucy, she knows what’s best for me, and I trust her.’<br />
<br />
Lucy grins when Jeff, with disgust, pulls his Jeans back on, “good, now, go and grab a pair of your shoes and put them on, then come straight back here,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jeff says, he then heads out his room to grab some of his shoes, the boy is oblivious to the fact that he, or rather, his actions are controlled by Lucy.<br />
<br />
When Jeff returns, Lucy looks at her brother, “okay, Jeff,” she says, “this is what is going to happen: the sleeves of your shirt will lengthen until they reach your wrists, while that happens, the waistband of your jeans will fuse with your t-shirt, becoming a onesie. A zipper will appear on the front of the onesie which will start at your neck and end just above your crotch. Meanwhile, the ends of the Jeans will fuse with your shoes, finally your shoes, jeans and t-shirt will take on a blue color which has printed-on butterflies and the material of all three pieces will become soft comfortable cotton. Once the transformation of your clothes is over, and you are trapped in the onesie, you will feel relieved, comfortable and happy. Furthermore, you will be unable to remove the onesie on your own.”<br />
<br />
Jeff tilts his head as the transformation of his clothes start, the second Lucy stops talking, “but… isn’t that to girly-looking,” he asks, “I mean… I’m a boy. Plus, how am I supposed to use the toilette, if I am unable to take my onesie off? And wouldn’t everyone make fun of me?”<br />
<br />
Luce grins, “no one will make fun of you, Jeff,” she says, “after all, this is what you always wear, it’s normal, so everyone won’t think about making fun of you, no matter how girly your new clothes appear to be.”<br />
<br />
“Right,” Jeff says as the “truth” clicks into place, “sorry, I forgot.”<br />
<br />
“That’s alright, Jeff,” Lucy says, grinning, “oh, and as for going to the toilette, you go to toilette in your diaper, that is why you wear a diaper. Or do you remember going to the toilette in a other way?”<br />
<br />
When Jeff remembers going to the toilette like any normal teenager, Lucy quickly erases that memory by stomping on the ground, causing Jeff to blink, “I… I thought I did,” he says, “but I guess I am wrong. It does make sense what you said, but then, how am I able to change my diaper after going? I mean… I don’t know how to change myself, and I can’t remove my onesie without help!”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, Jeff,” Lucy says, “don’t you remember that either your girlfriend Jane or your best friend Dave change you? Hehe… you even call your best friend “Daddy” and your girlfriend “Mommy” sometimes. I must say, they do treat you as their baby most of the times, it’s like you have two moms and two dads!”<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes a little and rubs the back of his head, by now his clothes have completely changed, instead of wearing a t-shirt, a jeans and a pair of sneakers, the teen is now wearing a blue onesie which has printed-on butterflies and a rather girly appearance.<br />
<br />
Lucy giggles at Jeff’s blush, “no need to be ashamed,” she says, “after all, you do need someone to look after you while you are in school. So, having your best friend be your “Daddy” and your girlfriend being your “Mommy”, is the right thing.”<br />
<br />
“I… I guess,” Jeff says, ‘Lucy is right… but I can’t help feel that something is really wrong,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Lucy smirks, her plan is taking fruit already, but there are two things she needs to do, before Jeff has to head to school. The 10-year-old then asks, “by the way, Jeff, why are you standing upright on two legs? Isn’t that a bit to tiring?”<br />
<br />
Jeff tilts his head, “um… not really,” he says, “I mean… this is how I walk and stand norm…,” before he is able to finish his sentence, Lucy claps in her hands, cutting the links between “walk”, “stand” and “normal”.<br />
<br />
Grinning Lucy then fills in the hole torn in Jeff’s mind by saying, “no, Jeff. Standing and walking on two legs, even though you are able to, is to tiring for you. After just a few steps your strength leaves you and you then continue to move by crawling and all fours.”<br />
<br />
Jeff blinks, “r-right, yes,” he says, “standing and walking is to hard for me, I prefer to crawl to get around,” he then looks at Lucy, “actually, I’ve been standing for so long now, I do feel really tired. Can… can I please return to my normal posture?”<br />
<br />
Lucy grins, “of course you can, Jeff. I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable,” the little girl then laughs when Jeff, with a sigh of relief, plops down on his butt.<br />
<br />
Jeff ignores Lucy’s laughter, and smiles up at his little sister, “thanks, Lucy,” he says, “I feel so much better now. My legs really started to get sore from standing so long.”<br />
<br />
Lucy simply smiles, before asking, “say Jeff, where’s your pacifier?”<br />
<br />
Jeff raises an eyebrow as he looks up at his sister, “what do you mean, Lucy,” he asks, sounding confused, “I… I don’t use a pacifier anymore. I’m to old for a pacif…,” the teen falls immediately silent when Lucy claps her hands.<br />
<br />
“Silly Jeff,” she says, “of course you use a pacifier! Without it you feel so miserable and even start to cry. Suckling on your pacifier not only calms you down and makes you happy, it also helps you to concentrate. And if you lose or misplace your pacifier, you usually suck your thumb instead, as a replacement.”<br />
<br />
Jeff blinks as the “memory” clicks into place in his mind, the teen suddenly starts looking around frantically, “L-Lucy,” he says, looking up at his sister, his eyes already tearing up and his lower jaw even starts to quiver a little, “ha-have you seen my paci? I… I seem to have… lo-lost it… again! Please… please, can… can you help me find it?!”<br />
<br />
Lucy can’t help but chuckle when she sees her brother crying like a baby, her chuckle quickly turns into a laugh when Jeff starts sucking on his thumb.<br />
<br />
Jeff removes his thumb out of his mouth, only to ask, “wh-what’s so funny,” before continuing to suckle on it.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry Jeff,” Lucy says, still grinning, “I don’t know where your paci is, you really should take better care of it. But, I’ll have a look, be a good boy and stay here, I’ll be right back,” Jeff simply nods, he stays where he is while Lucy leaves the room.<br />
<br />
‘I hope she finds my paci,’ Jeff thinks to himself, ‘without it… I… I don’t feel complete… I need it to stay calm and concentrate!’<br />
<br />
Lucy soon returns, “found it,” she says.<br />
<br />
Jeff turns his head, still sucking his thumb, to see Lucy holding a pink pacifier, “this is it, right?”<br />
<br />
Jeff shakes his head, pulling his thumb out his mouth to answer, “no, that’s a girl’s paci,” he says, “I… I think mine… was bl…,” the teen falls silent after Lucy once again claps her hands.<br />
<br />
“No, Jeff,” she says, “this is your paci! You always have had a pink pacifier, because pink is your favorite color, right?”<br />
<br />
Jeff blinks, “oh, y-yeah,” he says, “s-sorry, I forgot.”<br />
<br />
Lucy smiles, attaching the pacifier to Jeff’s onesie, she then holds the sucker to her brother’s mouth, who instantly switches his thumb with the pacifier. The 10-year-old girl straightens herself and smiles down at her big brother, “aaaaw, you are so cute, Jeff,” she says, “are you happy now?”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles under his pacifier and nods his head.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Lucy says, “I think you are ready for school. Though, I think it would be best if you’d go pee and poop before you leave for school, don’t you think?”</p>
