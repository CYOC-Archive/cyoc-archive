<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice had always been an introvert. She spent most of her time playing video games, watching streams, and scrolling through memes. As far as Jeff knew, she had no real friends. Seeing her spend so much time in her dim room, only occasionally leaving for provisions, made him feel almost bad for her. Despite his best efforts to make some form of connection, she always seemed to push him away, through mild disinterest, insults, or just strait blackmail.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down at the naked girl beneath him, the girl who had consistently antagonized him for as long as he could remember. His parents’ delicate little angle laid flat under his right hand. His power high was cut off when her realized she wasn’t resisting at all. Her head was turned to the side in embarrassment, but she wasn’t trying to escape. <br />
<br />
Jeff lifted his hand off her chest. She didn’t move. “Do you not want to run?” asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think so,” she said in her meek voice, “are we going to continue?”<br />
<br />
“You don’t think this is strange in any way, how lewd me pinning you down is?” Jeff raised his eyebrow, trying to read his sister’s expression.<br />
<br />
She stuttered an answer, “No… not that. It’s just confusing why I’m not connected to you, and why you just ripped all my clothes off, and why you had to see my diaper.” Her voice cracked and she fell silent. <br />
<br />
‘She must already know that she has the function of my penis’ Jeff cracked a grin. “Why were you wearing a diaper?” he asked with a sly smirk, “Can you really not hold it in?”<br />
<br />
Alice blushed, “I… It’s like, just so that I don’t need to take bathroom breaks.” Tears were welling up in her eyes from pure embarrassment. “For long sessions, you know?”<br />
<br />
Seeing her so vulnerable made Jeff feel so good; he now had something big to hold against her. The blend of emotions he felt was different from anything before. The joy at being able to dominate his sister, the need to make her his property, the empathy for her humiliation, all combined to drive his next action. His penis still in hand, and her legs still spread, Jeff lined up his bulbous shaft. He pushed her legs up, knees on her undeveloped chest. <br />
<br />
He brushed the head along her lips, a youthful slit with only the semblance of fuzz around it. She quivered in expectation. A single thrust was all. his full shaft went all the way in. As he entered, he could already feel his cock dissolving inside her. It was like she was sucking him in. His testicles followed right behind the shaft, and in mere seconds Jeff and Alice were connected at the genitals. <br />
<br />
Jeff was so turned on, and by the looks of it, Alice was too. A rush of blood passed through him, as his sister became a part of his body. He could now see through her eyes and feel with her skin. The intensity was enough for Jeff to fall back on the floor of his sister’s room pulling Alice down with him. To his surprise, she felt weightless, like pulling a doll made of Styrofoam. While Jeff was recovering from his fall, Alice started feeling herself up. She fondled her small, sensitive nipples and rubbed her clitoris. It now rested right above where their bodies connected, right where she ended and Jeff began. Jeff could feel all the pleasure of her body since she was now as an extension to his own.<br />
<br />
Both could feel an orgasm coming on. Alice began to panic. She could just reach the wastebin next to her bed. She pulled it close. Jeff started rubbing her body. Every inch of skin felt sensitive. In one massive climax the two came together in a cacophony of pleasure. Alice hung her head over the waste bin. She looked like she was puking, but from her mouth spewed more that a liter of what Jeff acknowledged as his own semen. He thought it was almost funny to watch it run down the sides of her mouth. <br />
<br />
Alice grabbed a tissue off her nightstand and began to clean up the mess. Jeff, still on the ground with his sister in cowgirl position, began contemplating what would happen next. Then the feeling hit him, he really needed to pee. Alice didn’t seem notice this, but Jeff knew he had to go asap. When he got up, his siter rose with him. Her legs were wrapped around his waist, and her arms around his neck keeping her upright. Her entered his sister’s bathroom trying to figure out what would happen, but his sister seemed to know just what to do. She leaned back as far as she could, looking at the toilet upside-down. She lifted the seat while forming her mouth like she was going to whistle, but out came a stream of urine instead. <br />
<br />
Seeing her hair just brushing the edge of the toilet, Jeff reached out trying to pull it back. When he grabbed, he accidentally yanked her hair, drawing her stream lower. It would be almost kinky if he hadn’t just orgasmed. When she was done, Alice lifted herself back up, once again wrapping herself around Jeff. He leaned over to flush the toilet as she pressed her face into his chest. Jeff was left thoroughly excited at how well his plan had worked. His sister now performed all the functions of his penis, while still remaining a person. <br />
<br />
He looked down; Alice’s eyes were closed. When he left the bathroom, he could see what was left of the mess he made. Deciding to just leave it; he made his way to door. “Woah. Woah. Woah.” Said Alice popping her head up, “I can’t leave like this. I’m completely naked.” <br />
<br />
Jeff stared at her worried face, “What, do you want to try putting the diaper on again? I don’t think that will fit us very well.” <br />
<br />
Jeff’s sarcasm left her confused if not a little embarrassed. “No, just let me put my pajamas on.” Jeff rolled his eyes as he walked her to the dresser. She pulled out some panties, a pair of short-shorts, and a pink hoodie. A headache washed over her when she stared at the shorts and underwear; she could not figure out how in the world those were supposed to be put on. So, she just put on the hoodie, but it did nothing to cover her exposed ass and crotch. Seeing Alice in discomfort and confusion, Jeff decided to take action and lifted the hoodie strait off her. He left Alice’s room and entered his own, Alice freaking out the whole way.<br />
<br />
She blushed. “Mom and Dad could have seen us.” Alice whimpered as Jeff reached into a drawer, pulling out a giant purple hoodie that was too big even for him. He gave it to her, and after she put it on Jeff could tell that this was a good solution. It hung down more like a dress with the sleeves scrunched up to half their original length. It was just enough to cover Alice’s naughty bits. her light smile was enough to confirm her satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Alice needed to grab her laptop from her room so she could watch a stream. Once she had, Jeff proceeded to lie back on his bed, Alice still on his chest. While she watched, Jeff looked at the time, almost half past six. Their parents would be home in about an hour. He began contemplating what he should do next. He saw Alice smiling as she pressed herself against his chest. He knew that he would have to return his sister eventually, but he needed to make sure they were still on good terms when that happened. And then there was school. Lockdown may be keeping them at home, but would they just attend classes together? These things lingered on his mind as he brushed his hand through his sister’s soft hair.</p>
