<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As funny as she thought her boyfriend&#39;s punishment was, it didn&#39;t really act as a good punishment if he wasn&#39;t even aware of who he had become. On top of that, a food court was fun and all, but it didn&#39;t really fit her goal of making the mall a better place. For that, she needed to start replacing some of these vapid shops with more that good, hardworking folks would visit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, alrighty, let&#39;s get to work.&quot; She giggled.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like dozens of sentence regenerations, she finally landed on one that was just vague enough to work.<br />
&quot;This location is a place which focuses on selling food products.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And bingo was his name-o.&quot; She smiled, before glancing up again at the court.<br />
<br />
From taking so long, the makeup of the people had changed slightly. The nasty middle aged woman who took the tacos seemed to have taken them on the go. In addition, it looked like some new people had wandered in, looking for some food. There was a scrawny teenaged boy who looked to be Italian with scraggily black hair and pimply olive skin skateboarding towards the hispanic food. <br />
<br />
Nearby, a family of three consisting of an African American father, a Caucasian mother, and their interracial toddler holding both of their hands walking towards the same location. The father was a bit pudgy, but otherwise kept himself well groomed as his hair was in tight locks, his clothing well pressed and shoes well looked after. The wife was also pudgy, but slightly fatter than her husband. She was blonde, with her hair hastily pushed into a bun, and wore just a tank top and tight leggings which left little to the imagination. The curly haired toddler happily skipped along. She seemed just excited to be getting food.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry folks, bad timing I reckon.&quot; She joked to herself.<br />
<br />
She gave one final glance at &quot;Janet&quot; who was almost finished with her family sized meal, and then typed in the change, making it so that &quot;food&quot; read &quot;Hardware&quot; instead.<br />
<br />
Instantly, the food court transformed. Walls formed around the entrance, making it a singular store once more. The ceiling lowered, and tables upon tables turned into rows and rows of shelves filled with tools and parts of all kinds. Above the entrance now read &quot;Hernandez’s Hardware&quot;. Unfortunately, because of its new design, Mandy could no longer see inside. She cursed under her breath, then made her way in to get a better look at her handy-work.<br />
<br />
A little ring of a bell went off as Mandy walked inside, and before she could even get a word in someone spotted her, and greeted her with a warm &quot;Hey Mandy! Shoppin&#39; for your dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
She turned to see two people behind a counter with an old fashioned register on top. The woman that greeted her was an older Hispanic woman. She seemed to be in her late 50s, with some wrinkles appearing on her mocha skin and some gray appearing in her flowing, black hair which only went to her shoulders. She was large, with large breasts and a larger ass, but wasn&#39;t fat... more, thick with three c&#39;s kinda thick.<br />
<br />
Beside her was an Asian kid, probably around 15, with messy black hair, braces, and pimples galore. Upon seeing Mandy, he straightened his terrible posture, and looked visibly nervous, avoiding eye contact as best he could. She smiled, as it reminded her of Jason a little, but that then reminded her to look for him as first priority.<br />
<br />
Mandy walked up to the counter, and noticed they were both wearing name tags. The boy was named Henry and the woman was named Rosita. <br />
&quot;Heya Rosy!&quot; She greeted, matching the woman&#39;s familiar tone despite never having actually met her. &quot;How&#39;s business?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Going great.&quot; She laughed. &quot;Ay, and they said this was a dumb idea. My own family called me &quot;estupida&quot; but here we are, still doing well!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I reckon this whole place is gonna start taking after you.&quot; She joked, although it was less of an exaggeration and more of a promise. She then gave the boy a side eye, and the second he glanced over she gave him a wink. She always loved it when they squirmed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, my husband is taking the week off.&quot; She explained. &quot;I hired some new staff too for the long haul. This here is Henry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hi.&quot; He greeted meekly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, you&#39;re both single.&quot; Rosita giggled, causing Henry to blush. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Hernandez please!&quot; He gawked, causing both girls to laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, let me know if you need help looking.&quot; She added.<br />
<br />
Mandy nodded, then made her way into the store. As she looked around, she made note of all the people she saw as she searched for Jason&#39;s new form. First she saw an old guy. His hair was thinning, the dark blonde hair nearly gone from the edge of his head. He was fat, wearing only a tank top, and was browsing through various screws with a furrowed brow. Next to him was a teenaged girl, who did not seem interested. She was wearing a pair of shorts, but under that was swim suit which stretched up high. She had curly hair she was twirling with one hand while the other mindlessly browsed through her phone.<br />
<br />
In the next aisle were three adult men, all discussing something about a tool they were near. Mandy took note of their appearances as she listened to their conversation, trying to see if any of them were possibly Jason. <br />
<br />
&quot;-eah it&#39;s definitely this one.&quot; The closest man to Mandy quietly said. <br />
<br />
He was a very buff African American man, wearing shorts and a tight sports jersey. He offered some kind of tool over to the man next to him, who scrutinized the item.<br />
&quot;If you say so Hank, but I still think it&#39;s in the next aisle.&quot; He said with a slight grumble.  <br />
<br />
The man who now held the tool was a blonde, fat man. He held the tool tightly, with large, burly hands. He was somewhat fat, but in a muscular sense, more having just a lot of bulk to him rather than being unhealthy. He was wearing a polo shirt with matching shorts, and seemed to be roughly the same age as the man beside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, stop bickering already.&quot; The last man spoke up. He appeared to be a middle aged man with a long, curly beard, wearing a baseball cap that covered his messy head of hair. The mixed race man just laughed, put his hands on his hips and sighed aloud. &quot;Just get married! You both already act like a married couple.&quot; <br />
<br />
This comment caused an argument to erupt, with all three bickering at one another. Mandy just sighed and continued on. It appeared that these three were the former family, so not who she was looking for. She kept walking, finding less people in the store than she thought. The only other changed person she found was one of the former redheads, now just a cardboard cutout of a woman in mechanics gear promoting some kind of oil with an Irish sounding name. There was also a younger employee with ginger hair, who seemed to be organizing some products to the best of his ability.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Mandy began to worry that Jason had somehow left without her notice. She was just about to run out the door when she finally found one last person standing near the back of the store. Mandy could tell from the brunette hair that it was likely Jason, and that he had now become...</p>
