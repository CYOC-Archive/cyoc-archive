<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt afraid to turn down his offer, slowly got up, curved his way around whatever that puddle was on the floor and slowly reached out his own hand. The guy's stench grew ever stronger as he approached him and was starting to make him sick. Matt hesitated before he made contact and noticed the large amount of mucus that covered the side of his giant hairy hand. Matt looked at Theodore in disgust and seen that he was still smiling. Theodore, suddenly grabs his hand and starts shaking wildly anyway. His grip on him was so strong, that Matt was actually in pain. He was completely dominated. He tried to force his hand out but couldn't &quot;O-ow! Hey!&quot; Matt yelled. Theodore stopped. &quot;O-oh! I-I'm sorry.&quot; Matt's hand was beat red and covered in mucus. &quot;Damn right you're sorry! Christ!&quot;, Matt said as he shakes his hand in pain. Uh oh! Matt probably said something he shouldn't. He looked up at Theodore and saw something completely opposite of what he was expecting, Theodore looked really sad. That tough wolf like stare earlier instantly devolved into a disturbing, but rather.. cute puppy dog look. <br />
<br />
His frustration at almost getting his arm ripped off washed away and left him actually felt sorry for the brute. &quot;Uhm, dude... you okay?&quot; Theodore's droopy eyes looked up, then look back down.  He then suddenly uttered, &quot;Are you 'fraid of me?&quot; After closely examining his body again, Matt didn't know what to say to that. However, a strong sense of guilt overcame him as he looked in Theodore's droopy face. &quot;No, I'm not. Just watch your strength next time alright?&quot; Theodore's somewhat goofy, but cute smile returned and Matt felt some relief. &quot;My name is Theodore, but the fellas round here calls me Theo.&quot; &quot;Theo eh? Say, Theo, um.. how old are you?&quot; Matt was also about to ask when the last time he showered but was afraid he would hurt his feelings again. &quot;Heheh, I look much older to you, huh?&quot; &quot;Yea. You do..&quot; &quot;Naw, I'm just 19. They don't transfer you to the real big house 'till you're 21.&quot; &quot;Oh, is that so?&quot;, Matt said as a matter of fact. &quot;Oh um, here! Make yourself at home.&quot; <br />
<br />
Theodore rose from the bottom bunk and reached for extra (dirty) sheets on his bed. Matt stared at how tall he is; probably a foot and a couple of inches higher then him. He also noticed some back hair poking out from his neck. &quot;Here, catch.&quot; Theo forcefully tossed him dirty sheets, blankets, and some pillows. The smell of them reeked just as much as Theo of not worse and were littered with Yellow, Red, and Green Stains. &quot;Figured, I give you those ahead of time since you're my new prison pal.&quot;, he smiled. &quot;Y-yeah.. I appreciate it.&quot; Matt said in disgust as he looked at the sheets. &quot;No, problem bud!&quot; Theo scratched his armpit and leaped on his top bunk. &quot;If you need anything, just give me a shout.&quot; Matt nodded and sat in his bottom bunk. He noticed that Theo's heavy bulk were making the springs wear and wondered if it's safe to be under him. Nevertheless, Matt layed himself upon his new bed, carefully turned the sheet's over to their cleanest side, and pulled them over him. <br />
<br />
The constant smell of Theo loomed around him, and for some reason he couldn't get him out of his mind. Matt knew that he himself was a pretty big guy, but Theo was on a totally different level from him. &quot;Hey, Theo how did you get that big?&quot; &quot;Well, I was a pretty scrawny guy when I came in and so I was constantly getting bullied by others. Somehow though as the years passed I bulked up and my body started to get use to the bullying. It's gotten to the point where no one bothers to talk to me anymore let alone being messed with...&quot; Matt started to feel guilty again &quot; I'm sorry to hear that.&quot; Theo poked his head over &quot;Don't be, bud! In fact, you're the first guy in a long while who hasn't been 'fraid of me. I should be thanking you.&quot; He grinned. Matt felt somewhat happy when Theo said that. &quot;Thanks, I guess.&quot; He looked at the his big toothy grin again, and Matt began to smile. &quot;Hey, you always sleep with your shoes on?&quot; &quot;Um, well.. yeah I do&quot; &quot;Here, lemme take 'em off for ya's!&quot; Theo shifted across his bunk, reached over the other side and began to take Matt's shoe's and socks off. &quot;Hey, stop struggling.&quot;..... &quot;There do you feel somewhat better now?&quot; Matt compared his feet to his cell partner's and felt alittle ashamed and jealous. However, with his shoes and socks off he did felt some refreshment, and started to wriggle his toes. &quot;Eheheh, Thanks.. bud!&quot; Matt said. Wait.. that he just call him bud!? This guy's speech is already getting to him.. &quot;Haha! That's what I'm talking about!&quot; Theo slapped Matt's feet and fell back to his original position. The slap made Matt feel oddly erotic. Thinking nothing of it, Matt tucked himself in layed his hands behind his head and began to doze off. Little did Matt realize is that he never washed his mucus covered hand.</p>
