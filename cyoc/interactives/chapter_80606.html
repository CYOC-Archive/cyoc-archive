<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wish I could get away with everything.&quot; In that moment, Brock's mind became a little clouded, and he had to close his eyes. When he opened <br />
them again, he was a completely different person. He didn't know how, but he knew that now he COULD get away with anything and everything. <br />
While there would be some initial scrutiny for his actions, no one would condemn him or punish him for his actions. His conscience dissolved into <br />
nothing, and from then on his actions would be based on impulse and nothing else.<br />
<br />
Brock looked at Michael's sleeping form on the floor with a glint in his eye. That bastard had taken enough from him: his room in the house <br />
despite the fact that Michael was a sophomore and Brock was a junior, his girlfriend after an intense party, and now he is sleeping in the middle of <br />
the floor like the rest of the house should just walk around him. Well not anymore! He's going to get back at the sleeping behemoth. Brock made <br />
his way towards Michael, who remained asleep and oblivious to the approaching soon-to-be-attacker. Brock knelt down next to Michael and <br />
grabbed the latter's wrists, unknowingly becoming infected with the Contagion. He was just about to spit in Michael's face when he looked up.<br />
<br />
Through the window he saw the hottest girl walking past the house. His cock suddenly rock hard, he raced to the door, failing to notice the very <br />
muscular guy walking next to the girl and holding her hand. Flinging open the door, Brock charged towards the girl. He crossed the distance <br />
between them very quickly and grabbed her arm forcefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fu-?&quot; she started to ask before Brock planted his lips right onto hers. The guy, obviously her boyfriend, stared in stunned silence. The <br />
girl closed her eyes and began to enjoy the kiss. Brock was enjoying the kiss, too. But strangely, it felt like something was passing between them <br />
through their mouths. Something that was coming from the girl and into Brock. When the sensation passed, Brock pulled away, no longer feeling <br />
as horny towards the girl. She stared at him, panting for breath and slowly brushing her blonde hair out of her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think you're doing, you fucking asshole?!?&quot; the guy yelled, finally catching Brock's attention. &quot;That's my girlfriend, you dickhead! <br />
You'll be so-&quot; The guy didn't finish because Brock had now locked lips with him. Brock's cock was straining painfully against his jeans. The guy, <br />
much like his girlfriend, closed his eyes and began to visibly enjoy the kiss. He wrapped his muscular arms around Brock and pulled him closer, <br />
grinding their clothed and rock hard cocks together. Brock felt that same sensation from before, except this time something was leaving him and <br />
going into the guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you faggots! Get a room or something!&quot; a voice shouted at the pair, causing Brock to break the kiss and look at the offender. He appeared to <br />
be a jock from another fraternity standing in front of three of his frat brothers. The ringleader, as the shouter must've been, was angrily marching <br />
his way towards Brock while his followers chuckled and had evil grins on their faces.<br />
<br />
Normally in his right mind, Brock would run back into the house and lock the door. Instead, he pushed the guy, who was trying to resume their <br />
kiss, away from him and began marching towards the quartet of frat jocks. He could hear them saying stuff like &quot;Oh look! The faggot must think <br />
he's got something to prove!&quot; and &quot;We'll show his sorry ass for ever being a faggot.&quot; When they were less than twenty yards apart, the leader held <br />
up his hand, indicating that his 'boys' should stop and that he could handle this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Rick! Show the faggot who's more of a man!&quot; one of them boasted loudly. Brock paid them no notice and didn't slow his pace. His heart was <br />
racing, not from fear, but from excitement. Why he was excited didn't really occur to Brock. The fact that Rick was an inch taller but had to be at <br />
least a hundred pounds heavier than Brock did occur to him, making his cock strain against his jeans even further.<br />
<br />
Rick stopped when he was about five feet from Brock. Brock did not. Rick clenched his fist and pulled his arm back, preparing to swing. Brock <br />
reached up to Rick's head. Rick seemed confused for a moment and paused. Brock grabbed the back of Rick's head and pulled it closer, locking <br />
his lips right onto Rick's. Almost immediately, Brock felt that something pass from him into Rick. Rick's arms fell to his side as he closed his eyes. <br />
He was about to reach for Brock's waist when one of his brothers stepped forward. Brock waisted no time in letting go of Rick and kissing the <br />
advancing frat boy, again feeling that something pass between them. This course of actions repeated itself twice more with the other two guys in <br />
Rick's posse.<br />
<br />
As he was kissing the final guy, the sensation dwindled into nothing, Brock's cock went flaccid, and his mind cleared. He stepped back from the <br />
four guys, each of them reeling in some sort of afterglow of Brock's kiss despite the fact they had kissed him for 10 to 15 seconds at most. Brock <br />
couldn't believe what he just done and ran off.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, that hot girl shook her head, finally able to make coherent thoughts. She saw Brock's shocked face before he ran away and turned to <br />
her boyfriend, who was staring dreamily after that stranger. She vaguely remembered him kissing that guy passionately and shoved his shoulder. <br />
He shook his head, finally returning to reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that all about, Erick?&quot; she asked, not completely angry but not at all pleased either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Christina, I'd ask you the same thing but,&quot; Erick took a deep breath &quot;I guess I already know. I'm not sure how or why, but the way he kissed me <br />
made me want him to continue. If you hadn't shaken me, I probably would've chased after him for more. You know what I mean?&quot; There was no <br />
response. &quot;Christina?&quot; He turned and was shocked at he saw.<br />
<br />
Christina had taken off her shirt and was holding her long and slender arms tightly. Her face had an expression of pain and discomfort. She began <br />
to grunt as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;My arms ache,&quot; she complained. &quot;My stomach and boobs feel weird. I just feel strange all over. Help me, Erick!&quot; Erick didn't know what to do. He <br />
tried massaging Christina's arms, but that didn't seem to help. He helped her take off her shoes when she began complaining about how tight <br />
they were.<br />
<br />
That's when he noticed something was off. Her feet were bigger and kept growing. They weren't dainty anymore either. They became rough to the <br />
touch and dark hairs began to grow on top of them. Erick watched as her feet grew almost bigger than his own feet before stopping. The hair <br />
began to grow along her long legs as well. At the same time, Christina's legs also began to grow, her complaints of discomfort accentuating them. <br />
Erick ran his hands up and down them, realizing that they were filling up with taut muscle. For some strange reason, her new leg muscles seemed <br />
to turn Erick on. He absentmindedly began rubbing his cock through his athletic shorts before stopping. His cock felt smaller!<br />
<br />
Looking down, he realized that whatever changes that were happening to Christina, the opposite was happening to him! Gone were the calf and <br />
quad muscles that he worked tirelessly at the gym for. The hair on his legs was completely gone, making his legs look like he had just gotten <br />
them waxed. Noticing that his feet felt loose in his shoes, he pulled them out and recognized that they were now as small as Christina's feet used <br />
to be. His shorts and boxers suddenly slipped down his smooth legs, no longer the right size to stay up. Erick got a good look at his once 8-inch <br />
soft cock now rock hard at a mere 4 inches and dwindling. Christina moaned in pleasure, causing Erick to redirect his attention once again.<br />
<br />
Her changes were much more accelerated than his, Erick realized. Her stomach and formed a taut six-pack and her bra seemed plastered to her <br />
wide and thick, not tits, but pecs. Her shoulders bulged with muscle as the muscle began to build up on her arms. Her blonde hair was turning <br />
brown as it was being sucked into her skull. But what had caught Erick's eye was her swollen clit. It was already 2 inches thick and 6 inches long <br />
and began to take on the appearance of a rock hard cock. He and Christina locked eyes for a moment before hungrily and lustily making out and <br />
grinding their hips into each other. Christina leaned against Erick, and their heavy bodies fell into the grass. He felt Christina's larger hands grasp <br />
his plumped ass as she felt her clot go inside some sort of niche in his crotch. The pleasure was too much for him to think about it, and he forced <br />
Christina's hard clit in and out of his niche for more pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yees,&quot; Erick moaned, closing his eyes as Christina began to thrust her clit into him. &quot;More baby.&quot; She only gave a deep grunt. Then she gave <br />
another. Then another. And another. Soon, she was grunting in time with her thrusting. Then...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh, oh, OH,&quot; Erick began to moan louder and louder. Christina's grunts became louder and louder as well. &quot;OH, OH, OHHHH GOOOOD! <br />
YEEESS!&quot; Erick felt his muscles clench up a little, causing Christina to give a great, guttural, masculine roar as a warm liquid began to fill Erick. <br />
They lay in the grass, panting and gasping for breath as they bathed in the afterglow of their orgasms. Erick opened his eyes and gazed upon the <br />
man that Christina had become.<br />
<br />
She, now he, had bodybuilder-sized muscles on his arms and torso. He had brilliant green eyes, as opposed to her soft blue ones, and a dark <br />
brown crew cut. He smiled, creating cute dimples in his cheeks, and pulled his cock out of Erick's vagina. Erick looked down, expecting to see that <br />
he was now completely a she. But that wasn't the case. From the waist down, he was completely female with small dainty feet, smooth and thin <br />
legs, and a dripping vagina. From the waist up, he was the same as he always was: male with large muscles, although not as large as Christina's, <br />
and a little bit of hair on his arms and chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Christina said, finally speaking with his new baritone voice, deeper than Erick's. &quot;That was amazing. How come you're not completely girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just wondering that myself,&quot; Erick breathed. Loud voices caught their attention. They turned their heads. They saw Rick and his posse all in <br />
a state of distress. They had all taken their shirts off and were panicking. Rick must have had a lot of muscle because his arms were ripped but not <br />
his chest and stomach. He now had a feminine waist, complete with an hourglass figured stomach and perky C-cup tits, which were been smaller <br />
than Christina's former DD-cup tits. His face remained the same. The second jock, the one who Brock had kissed second, had similar-sized tits as <br />
Rick and long, smooth, slender arms. The third guy didn't have any noticeable physical changes, except for a larger and plumper ass and bigger <br />
nipples and a very distinctly feminine soprano voice. The fourth guy had a completely female face and waist-length blonde hair. Despite their <br />
panic, they were all sporting some very large and prevalent bulges that could clearly mean they were horny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like that guy who kissed all of us had sucked the estrogen right out of me,&quot; Christina said in amazement. &quot;Then when he kissed you guys, <br />
he distributed it to all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If he and I hadn't been interrupted,&quot; Erick said, equally astonished. &quot;I would be completely female right now instead of half and half.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I like this SO much better,&quot; Christina said, kissing Erick. &quot;You're still as hot as before above the waist and even hotter below.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I never thought that I'd fall for a guy but since it's you, Christina-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Chris.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since it's you, Chris, I couldn't be happier or hornier than I am right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, baby,&quot; Chris said, scooping Erick up as he stood. &quot;Let's go explore this further.&quot; And with that, they left, not noticing that Michael had <br />
been watching the entire scene unfold after being woken up by the shouting.</p>
