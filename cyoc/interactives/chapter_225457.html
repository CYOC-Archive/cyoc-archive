<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I want to start a cast list for my sake and possible future authors. This is not a list of all the characters but those who I think could potentially come back into the story again.<br />
<br />
Me: of course the main protagonist telling the story, a jock<br />
My dad<br />
Jase: My brother, also a jock<br />
Nick Corcoran: Jase&#39;s best friend, also a jock, and the one who I feel owns me<br />
Mr. Corcoran: Nick&#39;s dad who also misses having me in his home<br />
Billy: Nick&#39;s cousin, a hunter<br />
Mr. Phelps: a cult leader<br />
Pete: Billy&#39;s friend and my current boss, a hunter<br />
Pete&#39;s dad: A lawyer<br />
Jared: My best friend, also a jock<br />
Mr. Ferguson: The hunter who helped me be a better jock<br />
Mark and Sam: My other friends<br />
My wife<br />
My son: (no real plans until he&#39;s older)<br />
I realize I made a mistake in that I named two different characters Jared but I have no real plans for the second Jared to come back into the story. Wanting to avoid accidentally reusing a name is why I want this cast list.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I ran from the lion. My cock bounced straight and hard in front of me as I ran naked across the African savannah. I couldn&#39;t believe that I was feeling so sexually aroused by being chased by a lion. I ran through a herd of zebras and that successfully turned the lion to chase the zebras instead of me.<br />
<br />
But then I almost ran into the open jaws of a hippo but he was eating a crocodile. I didn&#39;t know that hippos ate crocodiles.<br />
<br />
I got away from the wild animals but that is when the tribe caught up with me. They speared me. Just like when I had been shot by rifles, it didn&#39;t hurt. My body just went limp as the spear that went through me stuck in the ground holding my limp body hanging above the ground. The tribe didn&#39;t take long before they took turns fucking me while I still hung like a rag doll on their spear.<br />
<br />
As I hung there being penetrated from cock after cock, I thought about how I got to this point.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Pete and I had kinda become ambassadors of jock season. Even though the history books contained many vague references to jock season, there was never any recorded resistance to jock season until about seven years ago. Then suddenly, many people from all over the world, especially in third world countries, protested against jock season and attempted to refuse to participate. I say attempted to refuse because the jocks themselves could not refuse. The hunters had all the power and even if some hunters refused to participate, it only took one hunter in the region to bag all the jocks and make trophies out of them.<br />
<br />
People protested for many reasons. Much of Africa protested because the hunters were typically white while the jocks were typically black. Some people protested on religious grounds although they disagreed about what the problem was. Some like Mr. Phelps declared that only righteous men should be hunted while other religions declared that righteous men should be exempt from being hunted. Some women protested about sexist restrictions preventing them from being hunters but the men countered with how only men were hunted and that if women were to be allowed to hunt, women should be allowed to be hunted. People also complained about the trans situation as trans women got out of being hunted but trans men wound up becoming hunted jocks. Trans people used this as evidence that they really were trapped in the bodies of the wrong gender because whatever caused jock season recognized the difference between trans men and cis women regardless of whether they had the hormones or anatomy. Trans male trophies were treated especially bad because they still had vaginas. Non-binaries never became jocks but anyone who identified as male could become a jock even if he had the wrong hormones or anatomy. But whatever caused jock season also caused an overall attitude that it was only okay to hunt male jocks. Even the men who protested against jock season never claimed that it was sexist to only hunt men. They might complain that being a jock interfered with their schooling or their political career or some other personal reason why they should be exempted from the hunt but no one ever claimed that it was wrong to hunt male jocks. Whatever caused jock season didn&#39;t care. All male jocks could be hunted regardless of who they were and only male jocks could be hunted.<br />
<br />
Even in my country, jock season had become a political issue with some politicians campaigning to change jock season while other politicians campaigned to preserve jock season as is. Senator Donaldson is the one who made Pete and I into ambassadors to promote jock season. I didn&#39;t know what Pete or I could do. Despite all the research we had done on jock season, it seemed like we were very limited in what we could do one way or the other. Jock season was going to continue no matter how anyone felt about it.<br />
<br />
Still Senator Donaldson invited us on the campaign trail as he ran for president. He provided me with an expensive tailored suit but the suit was specially designed with a hole for my rack to be on display. Senator Donaldson wanted everyone to see my nine inch rack and know that I was a jock that promoted jock season. It became the custom that people did not shake my hand when they greeted me. They shook my cock instead and even then, they didn&#39;t necessarily greet me. Often it would go like this: Senator Donaldson would introduce me to someone. That someone would grab my cock and then talk to Senator Donaldson or to Pete about me. Generally, people didn&#39;t talk to me.<br />
<br />
Even the cameras had a tendency to focus on my cock instead of my face. When watching the campaign on video, I would only see my face in the group shots of me standing next to Senator Donaldson or Pete or someone else but I would also always see my cock on the video but if the video ever focused on me, it was always a close up of my dick.<br />
<br />
I was transformed less frequently but occasionally, Senator Donaldson would have me stripped and put on display as a statue, a painting or he would have me installed as a Ferguson style urinal in the men&#39;s bathroom at the convention where I was supposed to tell the men who fucked me that Senator Donaldson would do his best to supply the nation with more jocks to fuck like me.<br />
<br />
After one time of being a Ferguson style urinal, Pete didn&#39;t transform me back. He just put my ass in the passenger side of his car with my head nearby and drove me home while he fucked me with my own cock.<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;I&#39;ve got a secret to tell you but first, I need to know that you truly want to promote jock season. Would you like to be a jock for the rest of your life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It has it&#39;s pros and cons. Mostly, I feel a sense of belonging. I am owned. It&#39;s weird because I have so many owners: Nick, Mr. Corcoran, my dad, Mr. Ferguson, you. All of you own me. I belong to you. I also feel pride. Everyone one admires me and wants to be me. I am desired, wanted. But I only have one more year left as a jock and I don&#39;t want it to end. I don&#39;t want to become so old and flabby that no one wants me anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;What if I told you that it hasn&#39;t always been this way, that until seven years ago, there was no such thing as jock season?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s in the history books.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;Those are all wrong. Seven years ago, there was this guy named Steve who I was really attracted to. I fantasized about him nightly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re gay. Stop playing with me. I&#39;m not gay. It&#39;s against the rules to have sex with a trophy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;But it would be okay if I was straight, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yea. I&#39;m a jock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete kept fucking me with my own dick and said, &quot;Seven years ago, it was against the rules to even look at a jock. I wasn&#39;t even allowed to look at Steve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you&#39;re gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete asked, &quot;Do you hate gay people?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m fine with you being gay. You just need to stop looking at me and stop touching me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;You are fine with straight men looking and touching. Does that make you gay? Didn&#39;t you tell me about how you fucked Nick on his birthday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was different. I was initiating him into becoming a jock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;But you said yourself that you wondered if you had turned gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not. It&#39;s not gay to fuck a jock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;It used to be, seven years ago. Listen, I didn&#39;t necessarily want to fuck Steve. Yea, I wanted to see him naked and I wanted to make out with him and play with his cock. Is that so wrong? Don&#39;t you miss Nick seeing you naked? Didn&#39;t you enjoy making out with Nick? Don&#39;t you miss Nick playing with your cock? But you&#39;re not gay, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t know what to say. I couldn&#39;t stop Pete from using my cock to fuck me but I thought about how, if Nick was the one doing this, I&#39;d be happy to let it continue.<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;You might be better off to think of me as a nudist or a guy who like horseplay instead of thinking of me as gay. Anyway, I wasn&#39;t even allowed to look at Steve, let alone get into any kind of horseplay. I would have been satisfied just to have Steve a little less uptight. So I went to my dad. We have this book that has been passed down through the ages. It&#39;s a magic book that lets us rewrite the laws of the universe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no such thing as magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;Whether you think it&#39;s magic or not, the book works.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it was magic, you could do anything you wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;No, there are limits. First, everything written in the book has to be in the form of a law. I couldn&#39;t write Steve will let me play with him. The book wouldn&#39;t allow that to be written in it. Whatever law I wrote had to effect all male jocks. Second, it has to be written in an ancient legalese that only my family knows. Third, once a law is written, it cannot be erased. A new law can be written that modifies or clarifies an old law but the old law stays in effect. Fourth, the book is not a blank book. It is a big book full of many already written laws and sometimes new laws can interact with old laws in unpredictable ways. My family has to be very careful when we write new laws that we don&#39;t cause unintended consequences. We take time and deliberate carefully about how we word any new laws we add. I had to have my dad&#39;s help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete stuck my dick in my mouth and deep throated me with my own cock.<br />
<br />
He continued, &quot;My dad did not share my interest in playing with Steve but my dad is an avid hunter and the idea of being able to hunt jocks appealed to him. That&#39;s how he came up with an idea for a law that would satisfy both of us. He added the no sex part to prevent women from impregnating themselves with jock trophies but he used an ancient legalese word that specified vaginal sex so even though our English translation of the law means no sex, the actual law only forbids vaginal sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete let go and I spit my cock out and said, &quot;So you got what you wanted. You can now play with all the jocks you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete&#39;s voice lowered, &quot;It didn&#39;t go exactly how I wanted. First, I was never able to get Steve. I got a few jocks but not the ones I really wanted. And then Steve grew too old to be a jock. Second, I didn&#39;t want this to change Steve. I wanted him because he was a jock. I didn&#39;t want him to become gay. But in a way, all you jocks turned gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No we didn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete shoved my cock back down my throat, &quot;Yes, you did. Listen, I need someone I can talk to. I can&#39;t talk to most people. I wonder if it was a good idea talking to you. I&#39;m hoping that your desire to extend your time as a jock will make you want to help me extend Steve&#39;s time as a jock so that I might be able to finally get him.&quot;</p>
