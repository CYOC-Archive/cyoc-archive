<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you are about to answer the phone, someone starts to ring the doorbell. Torn between wanting to answer the door and pick up the phone, you finally answer the phone. It's your best friend who wants to know what you’re doing at the moment.<br />
<br />
Saying you’re doing nothing right now, he asks if you could swing by his place a bit later. Telling him you could, you hang up the phone and decided that you had better answer the door.<br />
<br />
The reason that you didn't really want to answer the door was because of what you’re wearing. Currently you are wearing a woman's tank-top, a pair of low-cut bikini briefs and a pair of woman's boxers. Having always wanted to be a female, you were happy when you could finally get a place of your own. The only person who knew of your strange dress-code was your best friend, Max.<br />
<br />
You had known Max since grade school, had graduated from high school and had even gone on to complete college together. After college, you both took jobs at a local newspaper. It was shortly after that that you found out that Max was turned on whenever you dressed like a woman. Telling him that you could never date a man unless you were truly a woman had almost cost you and him your friendship. In the end, it all worked out and you two still remain friends.<br />
<br />
Dressing, looking and acting like a female came easily to you and it was acting like a man that you found difficult. At a height of five foot four, weighing one hundred thirty pounds and easily fitting into a size S/M size range, you prefer to act feminine and hope to one day be able act feminine outside your own apartment.<br />
<br />
Walking over to the door, you open it, but find no one there. Somewhere down the hall you can hear the ding of the elevator. You're just about to close the door when you notice the package on the doorstep. Picking it up, you reenter your apartment with it.<br />
<br />
It's addressed to one Chris Berkowitz, you, but has no return address label on it. Worried that it might be something explosive, you set it down on the table, wondering what to do about it. Finally coming to the conclusion that you have no real enemies, you throw caution to the wind and decide to open it.<br />
<br />
Opening is not an easy task and after dropping it on the floor a couple of times, knocking against a chair, pricking your finger with the knife you had collected to open it; you finally succeed in lifting the lid off.<br />
<br />
Inside is a carton of glass bottles full of several different coloured liquids. Amazed that they didn't shatter, you can see that there is four total. Picking one up, you see that it is labeled Bubbly Blonde. Wondering why the mail carrier had brought this all the way up here instead of leaving it downstairs, you're also puzzled about why someone would send you a box of juice with real odd names.<br />
<br />
Not finding the yellow drink you're holding too appealing, you return it to the carton. You pull out a bottle of red liquid that reads Mellow Red Head. Looking at the rest of the bottle, you can see no other information; not even nutrition facts or were this stuff had been bottled.<br />
<br />
Decided that you at least want to try it and hoping that it hasn't been poisoned, you begin to shake the bottle, figuring it will mix the contents.<br />
<br />
Twisting the cap off, the bottle implodes in your hand and you are drenched from head to toe in a red fluid that smells strongly of strawberries. Mumbling about contents under pressure, glad that at least you didn't cut yourself, you grab some paper towels and begin to clean up the mess.<br />
<br />
But the one thing you do notice is that you're not in the least bit upset about your clothes getting drenched. As the fluid drips into your mouth, you suddenly realize that you're feeling amorous.<br />
<br />
As your penis becomes erect, something that has always bothered you, and the fluid drips down out of your hair, you slowly make your way toward your bedroom. As if doing all this from a dream, you strip and standing naked begin play with yourself. As you do this, you rub the excess fluid from your hair onto the tank-top.<br />
<br />
Moving over to the closet, still massaging your erect member, you toss the clothes into a hamper and pull off a shelf a magazine. Never having wanted to date a man unless you were female, that didn't stop you from fantasizing about sex with men. Still massaging your penis, you glide over to the bed and lay down on top of the comforter. Opening the magazine you begin to pleasure yourself.<br />
<br />
Concentrating on the magazine, you're unaware as you let go off your erect penis and taking two fingers, start to finger the area where a vagina opening would be. So intent on the magazine, that you fail to notice as your penis and testicles shrink and then fold up into your body. So engaged in the pictures and articles, that the forming of the clitoris, clitoris hood, the urethra, labia majour and minour and finally the vagina slip past you. Juices flowing, you slide two fingers into your vagina and begin to Jill off. Clitoris swelling, enjoying every moment, lost in a sea of feminine hormones and chemicals, the fact that your chest swells out into a set of B cup sized breast does not even bring you back.<br />
<br />
Day dreaming about your friend Max does bring you back temporary. Wondering what's going on, you lose yourself as you bring yourself to another full climax of an orgasm.<br />
<br />
So lost now in what you're doing, it escapes your attention as your body frame shifts to a five foot nine feminine one. Next you begin to regress from your age of twenty six to the age of fourteen. Nothing really majour changes about your body. The band size of your bra drops a couple of places, your five foot nine height drops to a height of five foot two while your weight shifts from a one hundred nineteen to a ninety five. You S/M frame changes into an S frame and as the changes finish, you manage to pull yourself out of what you are doing.<br />
<br />
Standing, you look down at the female figure that you've transformed into. Brushing a strand of red hair out of your face, you turn and look at the bed. It isn't so much that you were masturbating on it, but the sight of the juice stains really bothers you.<br />
<br />
Collecting a pink robe from the closet, you pull it on. The soft terry-clothe feels really good against your soft skin. Enjoying the way it brushes up against your skin, specifically your shaved crotch and erect nipples, you pull the comforter off the bed and take it out of the room. Luckily, this is one of those apartments with a washer and dryer already installed. Dumping the comforter into the washer, you decide that you want a shower.<br />
<br />
In the shower, you’re torn between liking what has happened and being really disturbed by it. Instead you let yourself become lost in the feel of the hot water and body wash against your body. Afterward, you decide to investigate the other bottles, hoping to get a clue on what just happened.<br />
<br />
Besides having Bubbly Blonde, there is also Bold Brunette and Sassy Black Hair. Tucked between the drinks is a note that you missed before. Opening it, you read:<br />
<br />
Dear Winner,<br />
<br />
You have been selected to participate in a free sample of the new drink, Zeitt. But wait, there's more. The four bottles you hold in front of you have all been specially altered so that you and your friends become the type of girl described on the bottle. Warning: All transformations are one way and permanent. Only one bottle per person and if a person drinks another bottle all she will find is juice. No person may have more than one change. If you are unsatisfied with the prize or the results, please.....<br />
<br />
But the rest of the letter was missing. Looking into the container, you don't find anything. Happy that you're a female, you wonder how your family is going to deal with it. Suddenly it dawns on you that you are fourteen and that means going back to school. Really worried because of the fact that you have to face more then your family as a female, you pause and wonder what to do.<br />
<br />
In the end, you choose to first get dressed; no sense in greeting the world in a bath towel. Most of your clothes don't fit to well and in the end you settle for a long flowing skirt and a matching blouse. Wandering into the other room, you look at the phone and try to decide who you should tell first; Family or Friend, and if you should also tell them about the drinks. In the end you decide.....</p>
