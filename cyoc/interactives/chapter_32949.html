<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a couple days after Rick transformed. During that time he had begun to think of himself as four year old Hannah. His shield continued to get better and he was able to notice reality shifts just about all the time now. His mother had been putting him though his paces this morning. Now he was in his room watching The Little Mermaid after lunch. This was his time to relax before his afternoon nap. After his nap his father and mother would again be teaching<br />
him magic. He wondered if they would teach him anything new today.<br />
<br />
About half way through the movie he suddenly lost consciousness.<br />
<br />
When he regained consciousness he found himself standing in the middle of his room.<br />
<br />
'How did I get in the middle of my room?' he thought. 'I was watching the movie and then I was just standing here. Huh, the TV is off.'<br />
<br />
He wanted to know what was going on. He figured that his mother altered reality again to test him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy&quot; he called out.<br />
<br />
She didn't answer but he suddenly notice something strange. He now had memories of being Hannah before he was transformed. He also noticed that he had trouble remembering his old life.<br />
<br />
He was about to go find his mother when his old body came into his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; his old body said. &quot;Are you seeing your body through my eyes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick noticed that he was so said &quot;Yes I am. This is strange.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is&quot; his old body said. &quot;I seem to be having trouble remembering the past couple of days. &quot;Are you having trouble remembering?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm having trouble remembering my life before the change&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you easily remember?&quot; his old body asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember my life as Hannah&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have new memories from before the transformation?&quot; his old body asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
Just then his mother came in and shouted &quot;Get out of my daughter's mind!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that where we are?&quot; Rick's old body asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know very well that it is&quot; his mother said angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy&quot; Rick said, &quot;something's wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes something's wrong here&quot; his mother said. &quot;This person has forced his way into your mind. Don't worry about it though, I'm here now and I'll make him leave if he doesn't leave on his own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't force my way in&quot; Rick's old body said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then perhaps you can explain why my daughter is unconscious in her room&quot; Rick's mother said angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't explain it&quot; his old body said. &quot;There is something strange going on here. I can see through her eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How stupid do you think I?&quot; am Rick's mother said her face red with anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's true Mommy&quot; Rick said. &quot;I can see different now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute&quot; his mother said, &quot;you mean that you're both seeing through each others eyes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Rick and his old body said at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is what I looked like Mommy&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean this is what you looked like as Rick?&quot; his mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then I was in the wrong&quot; his mother said. &quot;Do you two share memories?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we do&quot; Rick's old body said. &quot;I can't say for sure since we both seem to be having difficulties with some memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What memories do you have?&quot; Rick's mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have clear memories up until a couple days ago&quot; Rick's old body said. &quot;After that, it becomes difficult to remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have memories of being Hannah now&quot; Rick said. &quot;I have trouble remembering my life as Rick though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have memories of being Hannah?&quot; his mother asked. &quot;Does this include last month?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Rick said. &quot;Last month I tried putting on your makeup.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right&quot; his mother said. &quot;I think I may know what's happened. I think that you two are actually different personalities. I've seen this in the mind of someone who had multiple personalities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The different personalities have the same memories up to a point though&quot; Rick's old body said. &quot;I have trouble remembering the past couple days but I have none of Hannah's memories of being a girl past a couple of days ago. Maybe we're more like memories of our lives. I'm the memories of Rick's life while she's the memories of her life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes sense&quot; Rick's mother said. &quot;So from now on we'll call you by your old name of Rick&quot; she said looking at Rick's old body, &quot;and we'll call you by your new name of Hannah&quot; looking at Rick's new body. &quot;Now then I'm guessing that the medallion did create new memories of Hannah's life. It just took awhile for them to emerge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How come you're here Mommy?&quot; Hannah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You called out to me sweetie&quot; her mother said. &quot;When I got to your room I saw that you were unconscious and knew that you were in your mind. I was afraid that there was something wrong so I entered your mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you teach me to do that?&quot; Hannah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I will&quot; her mother said.<br />
<br />
Hannah's vision began to fade and her mother said &quot;You're starting to wake up now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her vision completely faded to black and she opened her eyes to see mother smiling at her.</p>
