<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they walked to the store, Ty decided it would be in his best interest if he revoked the wish to grow each time Dustin complained.  He was starting to find it difficult to move being this large, he couldn't imagine what it would be like if he kept going at this rate.  However, he didn't quite do it before Dustin made one more remark:<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can't I get new clothes?  He's not even 17!  Look at him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Size 15 sandals didn't seem large enough anymore, and he felt if he had to stretch at all that his shirt would rip instantly.  &quot;That's enough of that wish,&quot; he thought to himself.  &quot;But Dustin is right about something.  I don't look 17 at all,&quot; he thought as he saw his reflection in the shop window.  &quot;Who cares about high school anymore?  Imagine the action I could get in college!  I wish I looked just like this, but was 23 and everyone knew it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing changed, but he did feel more &quot;mature,&quot; if that could be the word for it.  They walked into the big and tall store and picked up an entirely new wardrobe for Ty, June constantly boasting of her big &quot;college boy&quot; and reminding Dustin that he should hope to turn out the same way.  Dustin wasn't too happy, but Ty was pleased.<br />
<br />
With new size 16 shoes, XXL shirts, and very large pants in hand, Ty somehow managed to climb into the car again.  The ride back was pretty uneventful until June pulled up in front of a fraternity and parked the car.  &quot;Here you are.&quot; she said to Ty matter of factly.<br />
<br />
Although he didn't recognize it, he knew this was where he lived now.  &quot;Finally!&quot; he thought.  He couldn't be happier to be out of that house.  Everyone but him seemed to know where his dorm was and they unloaded his stuff there.  Before they left, Mark and June gave him as close to a hug as they could get with his massive size and Dustin gave him a glare of dissatisfaction.  Ty didn't care.  He couldn't wait to see what awaited him as a frat-boy.  The walls in his room were covered with girls, and even some guys, too.  Ty thought that was odd, but decided he'd go with whatever came.  With a body like his, what we he care who wanted a piece of him?<br />
<br />
Not a half an hour had passed, and what was apparently his roommate came to the door.  &quot;Amber's here again, Ty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Amber?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, your girlfriend?  You act like you've never heard of her before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly memories of the hottest babe he could think of entered his mind.  Then she came to the door.  &quot;Hey, stud.&quot; she said, sporting nothing but hot pants and a tank top just large enough for her massive breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll leave you two alone.&quot; Ty's roommate said as he slipped out of the room.<br />
<br />
Ty couldn't control his huge member any longer, and she noticed it.  &quot;Normally I'd say this was a bit soon, but after last night this seems like the perfect time.&quot;  Amber began to undress herself and Ty.  Ty, who at this point was a virgin, could hardly contain himself, but he managed to keep it all in until the perfect time.  His new huge body seemed to know exactly what to do.  He dug his face deep into her breasts and sucked heavily on her nipples.  She got down on her knees and thrust Ty's huge cock into her mouth and sucked.  Ty wanted more and more, and as she continued he found himself thrusting without thinking.  Next she turned and Ty thrust his cock into her pussy and continued thrusting.  He didn't know what he was doing, but it felt good.  Amber let out shouts of ecstasy as both of them, with each thrust, came closer and closer to orgasm.  Just when Ty felt it couldn't get any better, he cummed right into her and let out a gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was great.&quot; Amber said after a few moments catching her breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; was all Ty could say.  He wasn't done.  He wanted more.  And more.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want more, don't you?&quot; she said.  Ty smiled broadly with his manly grin and they began again, but just then a knock came at the door and in entered...</p>
