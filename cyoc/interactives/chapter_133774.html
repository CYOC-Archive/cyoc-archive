<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fran, Louise, and Tim all arrived at Horizon together with Julius. Though this was more by coincidence than anything else. Tim had been looking for a Fire Salamander that had bright red spots which actually rather rare since the species usually was black with yellow spots. However, Horizon had plenty of Fire Salamander DNA in stock, thanks to the Lyre Zoo and contributions from one or two others that had wanted to convert as well. Tim did eventually find a Fire Salamander Animalian with bright red spots, which made him happy, though the Animalian in question was also male, which would mean injections, but Tim didn&#39;t mind. He was happy to find one that would provide the specific DNA for the Animalian he wanted to become.<br />
<br />
Louise had been wanting to become a Ribbon Seal and essentially had to wait for the drug lord&#39;s menagerie to arrive. Now that it had, she was there to meet with the family of Ribbon Seals that the drug lord owned. She was a bit nervous as there was some hope for romance involved as well, but the biggest thing was that the family had been kept in Costa Rica. She knew that Ribbon Seals lived in Arctic regions and that some news reports had even said that there were concerns that things like global warming had the potential to harm their habitat already. Being in Costa Rica, which had to be much warmer had to have been even worse for them.<br />
<br />
Fran could have converted earlier, particularly as Raj had seemed to like her. The two had enjoyed a few dates that went rather well, other than a drunk man hitting on Raj on their first date. It was enough that Fran was more than happy to become a peahen to be with Raj. He&#39;d even introduced her to his brother and his mate, and they had been most welcoming and that soon provided some surprises. Namely, both Raj and his brother, even with their long tail feathers, could fly. They weren&#39;t extremely graceful in the air and admitted that they did prefer to be on the ground, but they could fly when they needed to. Fran figured it was probably a good thing, as predators in India like tigers and leopards would probably take down peafowl quite easily if they couldn&#39;t fly. It was a nice surprise and if Fran weren&#39;t waiting for Louise to get her chance to convert, she would have gone through with it already. But now, with the menagerie arrived in Animalia, Fran was there to become an Animalian...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Louise was lead to one of the transformation rooms and let in by one of Horizon&#39;s nurses where she found three Ribbon Seal Animalians waiting for her. Two where male, though one was shorter than the other and lacked some of the muscle that the other had. The third was a beautiful female who stood beside the larger male Ribbon Seal Animalian with one webbed hand on the shoulder of the younger male Ribbon Seal Animalian. Louise also noted that the room had its air conditioning up fairly high to make it cooler. They were dressed comfortably and in a way that the clothing wouldn&#39;t make them feel too warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Louise said weakly, trying to hide her awe and eagerness at the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, you must be Louise Fransa,&quot; the female Ribbon Seal spoke with a small smile, &quot;The scientists that uplifted us said something about wishing to be like us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And to date our son,&quot; the adult male Ribbon Seal said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Louise admitted, &quot;but if you don&#39;t want... that... I&#39;d be fine just to be a Ribbon Seal. Just to be as strong and beautiful as you, Miss...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Freia Ribbon,&quot; the female spoke, &quot;and this is my mate... Carlos Ribbon. We took the surname based on the name humans have given our species.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louise slowly nodded. It was a bit interesting that the family had taken surnames as a lot of the reports on Animalia had seemed to indicate that uplifted Animals generally tended to either take or accept a singular name and didn&#39;t take on a surname unless they took a converted human as their mate. And then the surname they took was often the converted human&#39;s surname. Though, maybe Horizon suggested it when they explained Animalia and Louise&#39;s wish to join them.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a fine name, Mrs. Ribbon,&quot; Louise told her, &quot;and I hope you and Carlos have many happy years ahead of you. But... even if you don&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t mind Carlos&#39;s protectiveness of our son,&quot; Freia chuckled, &quot;A lot of this is fairly new for all of us... and as Animalians... many things that we didn&#39;t do as mundane seals seem so... natural to us now as Animalians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Federico is special to us,&quot; Carlos added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... that&#39;s something I&#39;ve seen across the board with regard to Animalia,&quot; Louise agreed, &quot;it&#39;s one of those things were Horizon&#39;s &quot;mad science&quot; had a surprise in producing a good thing. And I wouldn&#39;t want to hurt your son... Your Federico. And I&#39;d accept that he might not wish to be with someone as old as me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be younger once I give you your doses,&quot; Freia commented as she turned from her mate and retrieved a pair of plastic cups from a nearby counter, &quot;as both Carlos and I were close to feeling rather old by seal standards when Horizon uplifted us... and now... I feel young again too. So... I&#39;d guess that you&#39;ll become younger as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll only ask that you be vaccinated before you and our son do anything,&quot; Carlos spoke, &quot;let him finish growing up on his own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louise looked over to Federico, who stood by quietly. Telling exactly how old he was could be difficult, as she knew there were some Animalians that were physically mature thanks to being double dosed but were only that way because they were double dosed. In this their age was actually younger than they appeared to be. At the same time there were also issues where the uplifting of animals often hit potential difficulties in the fact that as mundane animals their lifespan was expected to be shorter than humans, but once they&#39;d become Animalians, their expected life expectancy equaled humans, which therefore meant that there had to be some conversion between the age of the animal when it was uplifted and then compared to what that would equal to. <br />
<br />
Louise wasn&#39;t the most knowledgeable on that, but based on Federico&#39;s musculature and the fact that like his parents he was covered in black fur with a white ring around his arms, his neck, and his legs (at the knee), rather than being covered entirely in white fuzz that he was probably close to the age at which a Ribbon Seal mother in the wild would send her pup off to live on his own. In this, Louise guessed Federico was the equivalent of a seventeen year old at the absolute youngest, if not the equal of an eighteen year old. It was again a point where she wasn&#39;t the most knowledgeable on converting animal ages into their equivalent in a human&#39;s life span.<br />
<br />
As she turned back, she found Freia offering the two cups to Louise.<br />
<br />
&quot;These cups are filled with my milk before Carlos and I were vaccinated,&quot; Freia spoke and offered the first cup to Louise, &quot;the Horizon scientists said they would allow for your conversion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Louise answered and downed the milk. It tasted a bit different from cow&#39;s milk, like it had a higher fat content in it, but it was good and she downed the glass completely. Louise felt her body growing warmer as Freia offered her the second cup, which Louise also downed.<br />
<br />
And the warmth went through Louise&#39;s body rather quickly, and that made her smile as she knew she was transforming. Federico came forward and kneeled down with a small and polite smile on his muzzle as he removed Louise&#39;s shoes and socks. As they came off, Louise lifted up a leg to watch as black fur grew out across her feet while a thick white band of fur began to appear at her ankles. The growing fur itched a little, and she could feel that all over her body, but for the moment she was more captivated by the alterations to her feet. The bones in the feet crackled a little as they got a bit longer, giving them a rather flipper like length, which was only reinforced by the growing skin between her toes. Louise couldn&#39;t help but smile joyously at the sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s happening!&quot; Louise said happily and jumped up before pulling Freia into a hug, &quot;thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Freia gave a polite chuckle and watched as Louise&#39;s age lines and wrinkles vanished from her face, making it look far younger and rather cute for a human&#39;s face, even if now covered in black fur and with long whiskers growing out on her upper lip. The thing that drew Freia&#39;s attention was hat her hair, which had been graying had darkened into the light brown shade it had been many years before. The uplifted seal was fascinated by Louise&#39;s hair. &quot;I like your hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it&#39;s nothing,&quot; Louise answered nonchalantly, and then noticed that it had been going back to its original color and then gasped, though the sound was closer to a bark as her face began to push forward into short and rounded muzzle. Louise ran her tongue along her teeth and found that they were sharpening and changing, which was good. She&#39;d been doing some studying since arriving in Lyre and making her choice, and found that Ribbon Seals ate a fair number of various small fish species and octopi as well and that young ones even ate crustaceans. Louise liked that and found herself smiling.<br />
<br />
Louise raised her hands up to look at her hair, to find that her hands were now partially webbed and covered in black fur. Sagging muscle was also gone, and she found all her muscles were starting bulk up quite a bit. Her body continued to feel rather warm and was now a bit uncomfortable as her shirt and pants were beginning to get rather tight. Her shirt sleeves and pants were barely containing the growing muscles of her arms and legs, but she could feel the material beginning to dig into her hips as they began to widen out. She also soon began to feel added weight on her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; was all Louise managed as she looked down to seep two swelling black furred breasts pushing out in front of her, popping several buttons on her shirt as her breasts grew out. If it weren&#39;t for the fact that she was now being barely contained by a bra that was not designed to handle the size she&#39;d just grown to, Louise might have been a bit aroused by all this, but the new transformed Ribbon Seal Animalian was a bit uncomfortable with the fact that her human clothing was a bit too small for her new body. &quot;Oh... this is all rather tight...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Freia chuckled, &quot;we do appear to be stronger than most humans along with having more padding in certain areas than they do. The scientists did leave us with somethings that will be more comfortable for you now and won&#39;t hold too much heat in...&quot;<br />
<br />
Freia then gestured to the bed where a white tee shirt lay. On it was the letter I, then a heart, and then a cute cartoon seal image, which made Louise smile. There were also a pair of gray shorts beside it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll look good enough to leave Horizon in,&quot; Louise commented, &quot;though we&#39;ll need to get a full wardrobe just to move about... and then figure out what to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louise began to work with getting out of the clothes she&#39;d been in, which only served to destroy them further. As she did so, her new nose soon caught the scent of arousal, though what soon made her smile was that it was neither Freia or Carlos but Federico who seemed interest. The young male might just be of legal age and there was of course the two date minimum before Animalia would allow for any sort of wedding proposal, but Louise was happy to have his attention happy that his parents were friendly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were hoping for some place cooler than what that drug lord had,&quot; Freia commented, &quot;he grabbed me out of the wild a year or two ago... but he&#39;d had my Carlos there for years!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was hot and humid down there,&quot; Carlos nodded, &quot;Something cooler would be very preferable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... from some of the Animalia Ambassadoria episodes I&#39;ve seen... they&#39;re a web show that Animalia has to show everyone the good parts of Animalian society... has show is that Horizon&#39;s been in contact with some various scientists trying to restore REAL Wooly Mammoths and have been looking for spots in Canada or Alaska for a location,&quot; Louise commented, &quot;maybe that could be part of an artic colony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These places are cooler than Costa Rica?&quot; Carlos asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much cooler,&quot;  Freia assured him, liking the idea of a northern colony.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;This is awesome!&quot; Tim declared as he flexed his new tail.<br />
<br />
The transformation wasn&#39;t too bad, and Tim had actually stripped down to his underwear before getting his injections. He judged this to actually be something well worth it as he wasn&#39;t having to really wrestle with cramped clothing. He might need some new pants and things in order to accommodate his tail, but that wasn&#39;t too much of an adjustment that would be needed. Otherwise, Tim was quite pleased with how he looked as he was muscular, with glossy black skin with bright red spots, some big enough to almost stripe like running down his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you like it,&quot; the male Fire Salamander that had provided the DNA for Tim&#39;s conversion commented, &quot;but you do know that color is NOT how my species got its name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know,&quot; Tim smiled and brushed his hair back, &quot;but as I said before... I&#39;ve always liked the color red and felt that is far closer to the color of fire than yellow... you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I am aware,&quot; the male Fire Salamander managed to chuckle and gave a small smile, &quot;Though... you may attract some attention from any of the single ladies Animalia has... especially those that were uplifted in the Lyre Zoo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot; Tim wondered as he blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your hair,&quot; the male Fire Salamander answered, &quot;those of us who were uplifted never had hair... but you and many converted humans KEPT theirs. My mate has been very jealous of a woman who became a different species of salamander and married the male that changed her shortly after he had been uplifted. The woman kept her hair and my mate simply wishes to know what it is like to have hair...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I can cut it off, if it causes trouble,&quot; Tim answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; the male Fire Salamander answered, &quot;you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,&quot; Fran gave a bit of a grunt as her wings grew out from her back, bursting her shirt and bra in the process.<br />
<br />
As with Tim, she&#39;d received two injections from one of the Horizon scientists who then left her alone with Raj watching. In a way she enjoyed the feeling of her transformation. Her feathers were warm and soft, and when she looked in a mirror, she found two things. First was that her hair was once again the blond color it had been in her youth, but the second was that sticking out through her hair was a set of long feathers that were much like Raj&#39;s in form on the top of her head. Though, unlike Raj, who&#39;s head feathers were blue, Fran&#39;s were tipped with a brownish shade, though it almost looked like it was close to the color of her hair.<br />
<br />
Fran also found that as a peahen she wasn&#39;t totally drab in color. Her neck had lengthened a little and as she looked into the mirror over her new beak, she found that her neck had iridescent green feathers that moved down toward her upper chest, before transitioning into a more whitish gray coloring. She also marveled at her growing musculature and actually began to feel a bit aroused as her breasts began to swell inside her shirt and her bra. They not only grew in size but also in firmness, and compounding this was that Fran could also feel her wings forming and instinctively she tried to flare them, only to find that her bra and her shirt was containing her... almost painfully. And finally her clothing couldn&#39;t holder anymore as she flared her wings out, revealing their brown color behind her and pretty much destroying her shirt and bra in the process.<br />
<br />
Fran smiled for a moment and turned to Raj, who she found waiting for her, totally naked with his own tail feathers flared behind him. Fran also noted the large penis standing erect between his legs. She also got a full look at his broad chest as she slipped out of her pants and underwear, feeling her own tail feathers grow out. Hers weren&#39;t anywhere near as long as Raj&#39;s, but she really didn&#39;t care. Their dates had gone well, and found him quite enjoyable and he was a good dancer, in fact he&#39;d even taught her a few steps and in that she began to fall in love with him before anything like sex was an issue. Though now, she could feel the desire to be with him growing. She&#39;d come to love him and now she was happy and desirous of being his mate.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; Raj said to Fran as he approached and reached for her hips to hold her two him.<br />
<br />
One hand made it to her hip, but she caught the other and guided it to her breast where it soon caressed an exposed nipple, making her moan slightly. She then raised herself up slightly while nuzzling her beak to Raj&#39;s and then lowered herself onto Raj&#39;s erection. As she felt her wet lower lips stretching around him, Fran gave a happy call, which grew lower as Raj then thrust himself fully into her and moaned back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; Fran moaned as they made it to the bed in the room, with Raj thrusting into her as they went, barely containing the pleasured feelings she felt, &quot;You wonderful... handsome... oooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaeeeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Raj simply kept thrusting. He&#39;d come to love her too and he knew that this was what both of them wanted.</p>
