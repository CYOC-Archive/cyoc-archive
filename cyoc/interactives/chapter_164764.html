<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They had all gone to bed, but instead of spread out around the fire, the four had actually laid their bedrolls out beside each other. Well, Andy had rolled his out, then Lion rolled his out next to him, quickly followed by Hyena on the other side and Rhino next to Hyena. It was strange, but no one made any comments about it, and they all laid down, the days rigors lulling them quickly into a peaceful sleep. Even if Andy didn&#39;t feel worn out, it didn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t tired.<br />
<br />
Though in the middle of the night he felt a hand pressed against his chest. He thought it might be one of the others, their hand flopping on top of him as they turned in their sleep, but when he opened his eyes the feeling left, and none of the others had stirred. Off by the dull glowing embers that remained of their fire sat another individual. Like his three travelling companions, he was a dark skinned young man, fit and muscular, completely nude except for the mask he wore. A mask, Andy couldn&#39;t help but note, that was an exact duplicate to the one he wore.<br />
<br />
The others slept, but Andy felt a need to go over and talk to this man. He stood up and strode to the fire pit, taking a sit directly across from the figure.<br />
<br />
In perfect, though heavily accented, English he spoke. &quot;You wear my mask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lion gave it to me.&quot; Andy said, as he reached up and touched the mask he barely noticed he wore anymore.<br />
<br />
The man nodded, and intead of disapproval, Andy almost felt like he could feel him smiling. &quot;I knew a fourth would join them and wear it, I did not expect someone like you. But you.. seem suitable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Suitable?&quot; Andy said with some confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;To take my place. Lion will be chief of our tribe one day, the three who travel with him are to be his closest advisors. Rhino to advise him in war and hunting, Hyena to question him and make him think, and Zebra to advise him on spiritual matters.&quot; The man who was Zebra smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I.. don&#39;t know any of that. I just need to get back to my home.&quot; Andy tried to sound stern, but even he could hear the doubt in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have two more days to decide. If you join them in the ritual, you will be bonded to them and they to you. You will have to learn your role, but I think you have what it takes. And I can give you a... I think you would call it a jump start?&quot; Zebra didn&#39;t make a move though, simply watching Andy from behind the mask. Surprisingly, Andy noted that Zebra had blue eyes, almost the same exact shade as his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why me?&quot; Andy asked. &quot;I&#39;m just some idiot that got lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The spirits do as they will.&quot; Zebra said with a shrug. He got to his feet. &quot;I will impart some of my knowledge to you. If you decide to join yourself to our tribe, it will stay with you, if not, it will leave and you can go back to your old life. I think.. you would regret that though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy opened his mouth to say something, but Zebra stepped forward and turned into smoke, a smoke that flowed towards Andy, into his open mouth. He could feel it filling his lungs, settling into his chest, and wrapping around his heart. He fell backwards, unconsciousness claiming him.<br />
<br />
When he woke up again, it was to Lion gently shaking him awake. He was back on his bedroll as if he had never gotten up in the middle of the night. Lion silently motioned him to follow, and he did to another mud wallow beside the rivulet they had camped by. Andy may have tanned, but he was still at risk for more burning, so they went through the same ritual of covering him with the protective, all-natural sun screen.<br />
<br />
There were definitely changes occurring though. His body felt unfamiliar under his own hands, lean, fit, muscular. He wasn&#39;t even this in shape back in his own youth. Lion made no comment on the changes though, simply helping him get to the places he couldn&#39;t. Upon their return to camp Hyena and Rhino had everything packed up. Andy&#39;s bundle was a bit bigger this time, a more even share.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy your roll in the mud?&quot; Hyena said teasingly to Lion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you&#39;d like a turn next?&quot; Andy snapped back with a bit of a laugh.. which died in his mouth after he realized just what happened. Neither of them had spoken English. Andy had understood their language perfectly, and responded in kind.<br />
<br />
The three were staring at him, but Andy&#39;s own shock must have been obvious to them.<br />
<br />
The silence was broken by Lion throwing his head back with a laugh. &quot;Thank the spirits, I think they finally got sick of you two waving your hands at each other like a pair of bickering traders.&quot; The joke seemed to break the tension, and they finished hefting their bundles and set out on the road. Though Hyena was now taking advantage of Andy&#39;s new found ability to understand him by peppering him with questions about his old life, what it was like where he was from, and all sorts of things.<br />
<br />
Andy was just happy to be able to talk.</p>
