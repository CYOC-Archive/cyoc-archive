<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon decided to try just a small change. After all, he'd called friends over to share the new game - what if it turned 
<br>
 out to be a piece of crap? He kicked off his shoes and socks and sat cross-legged in the big chair, the manual in one hand. 
<br>

<br>
 He changed the age to 16 and pressed the submit button. And waited. 
<br>

<br>
 And waited. 
<br>

<br>
 All he felt was a small sensation like an insect bite or tingling pressure on his skin. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Oh, man, what a rip,&quot; he said under his breath. &quot;I don't feel any dif-&quot; His complaint was cut short by a pounding on the 
<br>
 back door. Three loud knocks, then 2, then three again. &quot;OK Ed, I'm coming. Keep your pants on!&quot; Simon shouted. 
<br>

<br>
 He stood up and was unsteady for a moment. Something WAS a little different, but he couldn't place it. Shrugging, he ambled 
<br>
 to the kitchen door, knowing that his best bud, Ed Carlin, and Ed's 12-year-old cousin, Heather, would be on the other side 
<br>
 of the door. The three of them were the only ones who shared the 'secret' knock he'd just heard. 
<br>

<br>
 Simon had to try twice before he got hold of the knob. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Hi, guys,&quot; he began, &quot;um, aboout what I told you on the phone ....&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Holy sh*t Simon, is that you?&quot; Ed blurted out. 
<br>

<br>
 Simon now realized that Ed's voice was coming from - below - his best bud's head only came up to the middle of Simon's 
<br>
 chest. Heather stared, mouth wide open. 
<br>

<br>
 Simon stopped and looked down at himself. He knew his voice hadn't sounded any different, and he didn't - feel - any 
<br>
 different, but it had worked - something had happened! He saw aat least 5 inches of bare shin sticking out from beneath his 
<br>
 pants' bottom hem, and just now noticed that there was a gap between his shirt and the waist of the pants. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Dude, you must've shot up about 7, 8 inches,&quot; Ed said excitedly. &quot;What'd you do, dude?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Um, I set the game for 16,&quot; Simon said. &quot;Guess I'm gonna be what my Dad calls a 'late bloomer,' cause I don't seem to have 
<br>
 changed any other way than to have, um, shot up. Kinda cool, I guess, but I was hoping for something a little more.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Si-mon,&quot; Heather admonished,&quot;This is just too, too cool! You mean we can, like, be any age and stuff we want?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Um, yeah, I guess,&quot; Simon replied. &quot;There's all kinds of settings on the game. C'mon in and check it out. He barely 
<br>
 noticed that Heather purposely brushed against him as she passed giggling as she did so. 
<br>

<br>
 Simon loped back in to the living room, where Ed and Heather were already switching from screen to screen on the computer. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;So, what do you guys want to try?&quot; Simon asked. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I know, we can make it a real game,&quot; Heather said. &quot;We can each make a whole list of changes and burn them onto a CD. I 
<br>
 bet we can tie it in the to the program and set up a random access connection. Then we won't know until it happens, and we 
<br>
 can take turns guessing what happened! C'mon, guys, it'll be fun!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Simon and Ed had long ago learned not to argue with Heather. Simon pulled out a blank CD and dropped it into the burner. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Rule one, no peeking. Rule two,ladies first,&quot; Heather said. 
<br>

<br>
 Ed retreated to the seat next to Simon on the couch. &quot;Si-my-man, I can't really believe it. You look so cool. I'm gonna 
<br>
 choose 16, too, and then we can see who's gonna be the biggest dude when we get to high school.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well, I guess you're gonna beat me there, bud,&quot; Simon answered. &quot;All I got was taller and maybe a little heavier. Heck, my 
<br>
 clothes still sorta fit. Sh*t, I hope I can figure out some way to use this thing to make me look more like the other guys 
<br>
 when I'm really 16 - I don't want to be just a big kid when everyone else is scoring, know whut I mean? I mean -&quot; here he 
<br>
 dropped to a soft whisper - &quot;I don't even have any hair, ya know, - down there - yet. In just checked when you guys were 
<br>
 fooling with the game. That's what I'm going to choose - I need to know when that's gonna happen so I can start planning 
<br>
 NOW, ya know whut I mean?&quot; Ed nodded as sagely as any 13-year-old could. He knew better than to tell Simon that he already 
<br>
 had begun developing. At least, better than to mention it now - he didn't want to piss off Simon and lose a chance at the 
<br>
 game. 
<br>

<br>
 Heather signalled that she was done, and Ed moved to the keyboard. 
<br>

<br>
 Simon stood up and stretched. He was getting used to the longer limbs he now sported. Heather came over. She looked so 
<br>
 short to Simon now. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Ooh, Simon, if this really, truly works, I can really, really show up that bratty Debbie Simmons at my party next week!&quot; 
<br>
 Heather cooed. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Mm-hmm&quot; Simon muttered. He was trying to get a list of what he wanted to put on the CD together in his mind. Seeing what 
<br>
 Heather would be like in a few years was right near the top. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;OK, dude, you're up,&quot; Ed announced. 
<br>

<br>
 After Simon had finished, the three of them did rounds of 'one potato, two potato' to determine who would go first. Heather 
<br>
 won. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Cross your fingers, guys, I'm going to run this like a random access music thingie,&quot; Heather said. She HAD won the class 
<br>
 prize in computers three years rtunning, so the boys had no reason to protest. &quot;I'm ... OK, there - that should do it, I 
<br>
 guess. Now I can bring up three windows at once and buffer 3 random choices in from the CD so the execute commands all 
<br>
 happen at once. That way we won't take all afternoon playin' around one at a time, OK? Now, let's all stand over, um, 
<br>
 here.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 All three stood in a line in front of the computer desk. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Um, Simon, I can't reach. You've got the longest reach now, so switch places with me and lean over and press this button 
<br>
 here, OK?&quot; Heather asked. 
<br>

<br>
 Simon did as he was asked. They heard the whir of the CD starting up, then the screen blinked on, off, then back to life 
<br>
 again and a slight glow enveloped them, followed by a sharp, short tingle. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Whoa, like what was that all about?&quot; Simon said loudly. His voice was still pitched at a pre-teen level. He looked down at 
<br>
 himself and didn't see any other apparent changes - the same amount of bare leg sticking out as before, until a long tress 
<br>
 of hair swung into view. &quot;Huh?&quot; He reached both hands up to his head. His hair had grown about a foot! It hung past his 
<br>
 shoulders and curtained down over his eyes until he brushed it to the side. In less than 2 seconds the following all took 
<br>
 place: &quot;What a stupid change,&quot; he thought, and was about to turn when he felt something -- odd -- where he had never, ever 
<br>
 felt anything before. &quot;What the hell?&quot; He reached one hand around to the small of his back and gingerly poked two fingers 
<br>
 under his waistband. &quot;Ow. Damn. What is that?&quot; followed by a realization that his fingers, in an inverted 'V', were 
<br>
 grasping a stiff, soft, bushy ... tail! 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Oh, sh*t,&quot; came from Simon's side. &quot;I got -- small! I'm like my freakin' little brother!&quot; That was Ed, who, as Simon 
<br>
 turned, saw he'd dropped at least two feet and probably 7 or 8 years - he looked like a little kid playing dress-up, the 
<br>
 open reont of his collar hangin down in an loose loop, the sleeves of his shirt touching the floor, his pants crumpled in a 
<br>
 pile at his feet. &quot;This ain't funny, dude! Who would pick this?&quot; Simon couldn't help grinning at the pouty look on his 
<br>
 pudgy-faced friend. Ed craned his neck up, amazed at how far away Simon's face was now, at least what could be seen of it 
<br>
 through the long locks of hair that flowed down from Simon's scalp. 
<br>

<br>
 Then he realized he coudn't see Heather. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Ed, shut up for a minute. Yeah, it's pretty dumb, but what happened to Heather? C'mon, man, step aside!&quot; Simon, meaning 
<br>
 only to move Ed to the side, batted him so hard on the shoulder that he fell down, tangled in his clothing. 
<br>

<br>
 But Ed didn't make a peep when he saw what Simon had revealed. 
<br>

<br>
 There, spread on the carpet, were Heather's clothes - but just her clothes. Simon reacted quickly, forgetting about the 
<br>
 uncomfortable pressure his tightly enclosed new tail was giving him. He grabbed and brushed the girl's outfit to the side. 
<br>

<br>
 There, curled up almost in a ball, was a naked child. No, even younger than a child. As the boys watched, the form grew 
<br>
 smaller and then more undefined. Paler -- smaller -- rounder -- smaller -- until, very quickly, too quickly, all that 
<br>
 marked where it had been was a large damp spot on the light tan carpet. 
<br>

<br>
 Ed, still on the floor, spoke first. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I -- I --didn't mean to, dude.&quot; His voice was hesitant and tremulous. Simon thought he was about to cry. &quot;I thought it'd 
<br>
 be funny to put in a zero - you know, just to see if it would work - I n-n-never thought it would ....&quot; His voice trailed 
<br>
 off.</p>
