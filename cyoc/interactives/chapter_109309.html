<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thor was playing on one of the bar TVs. Robbie was watching the comic book movie with apathy while stirring her drink with a swizzle stick. She was mostly ignoring the pick up artists and creeps. Robbie had to giggle a bit, because the men who had once been creeps and losers remained so as new women, their personalities not changing at all and they were obvious  not just through their speech, but also their manly body language. The juxtaposition of a gorgeous and voluptuous redhead who could be in a commercial talking like the world&#39;s crudest biker, which she had been a couple days ago, was quite a sight to behold, but Robbie was here to just relax with her co-worker/drinking buddy Lucretia. The movie had reached the scene where Thor had regained his powers and offering to take his lady love, Jane Foster, back to Asgard.<br />
<br />
&quot;My wife thinks he&#39;s hot. Wish she would think I was hot&quot; whined Robbie, finally sipping her drink(In a very dainty, ladylike way, Lucretia noticed).<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, she&#39;s still really hot&quot; giggled Lucretia, pulling out her phone. &quot;Wanna see?&quot; she asked Robbie. Without waiting for her friend&#39;s permission, Lucretia had pulled up Chris Hemsworth&#39;s Instagram account, now showing off the hunky Australian actor as the blonde bombshell she now was. <br />
<br />
Robbie made an impressed expression with her face that told Lucretia to keep scrolling, so Lucretia did. They made all sorts of funny comments, and hopped around to different actors and celebrities, seeing how they had fared under the Great Change. For the most part, well it seemed. Robbie had laughed the hardest when she had saw that ninety-three year old Stan Lee, who had co-created most of the Marvel characters, was now a hot and busty twenty-something Jewish woman who could give the Scarlet Witch a run for her money. There was a caption to her right that had said &quot;Face it, tiger, you just hit the jackpot!&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Remember when the first Iron Man movie came out, and I grew that Tony Stark beard?&quot; asked Robbie. &quot;I guess I&#39;ll have to dress up like Black Widow for Halloween from now on.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love to see you dressed up in black leather like that&quot; Lucretia said, her tone innocuous, either teasing the new woman or unaware of the sexual undertones of her statement. &quot;I can be Catwoman. I have the body to fit in her costume now without looking like I need to go on a diet. We&#39;d both win the office costume contest in a heartbeat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Michelle Pfeiffer Catwoman or Anne Hathaway Catwoman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither. Julie Newmar Catwoman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Robbied laughed again, grabbing Lucretia&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I wish that Elizabeth had kept her young body. She&#39;d have made a perfect Supergirl. Then we&#39;d be the trinity. The trinity of hot kick-ass girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Charlie&#39;s Angels&quot; added Lucretia, and Robbie laughed harder, signaling that the alcohol was now in her system and she was tipsy. <br />
<br />
Lucretia gave Robbie, who had been leered at all night by half the bar, another once over. Robbie was wearing a red velvet dress that looked great on her and showed off her smooth legs. Lucretia started to feel up Robbie&#39;s thighs, feeling an almost electric sensuality. Robbie grabbed Lucretia&#39;s hand, first to bat it away, but then to hold it warmly. She looked at Lucretia, her eyes drunk but flirty and said &quot;I love you, girl. I wish you were my wife instead&quot; and then took a huge gulp of her drink, emptying her glass completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another!&quot; she shrieked, breaking her glass on the floor like she had seen Thor do earlier in the movie.<br />
<br />
The head bartender, reduced to a pony-tailed cutie who didn&#39;t even look old enough to be in this place, ordered one of her underlings to clean up the glass. Lucretia had offered to pay for the broken glass, but the bartender said it was fine, claiming that it was probably just transformation shock. <br />
<br />
Lucretia was starting to have fantasies about Robbie. Weird fantasies where she was Robbie&#39;s protector, keeping her safe from all of these predatory looking women undressing the maiden-like Robbie with their eyes. In her fantasy, she would take Robbie home, shower her with whatever she wanted, and generally just take care of her. And fuck her. <br />
<br />
No, Lucretia thought, immediately dismissing her daydream. Robbie was married and had a child to take care of. The last thing she wanted was to be a homewrecker. <br />
<br />
But she was so cute! <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to play some pool. Can we play some pool?&quot; asked Robbie with a slurred voice, stumbling to her game of choice.<br />
<br />
**<br />
Aziz sat down at the sturdy, hardwood table where Regina was looking at a rather arcane book and introduced herself. She told Regina about her life in Saudi Arabia, how boring and cloistered it had been, and while Aziz was ambivalent about being a woman now, she was just glad to get out of there, especially to a magical place such as this. Regina had introduced herself in kind, telling Aziz about her career in physics and then her second act career as a high school teacher. She had neglected to tell this exotic young woman about how she had resigned in shame and fear after the Great Change.<br />
<br />
&quot;But wait&quot; said Aziz. &quot;How could such a beautiful woman like yourself have a career that long?&quot;<br />
<br />
Regina giggled. &quot;I&#39;m actually pushing sixty. The fact that I now look like a student teacher instead of one with tenure was just a happy accident. Why, how old are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twenty&quot; said Aziz. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh&quot; said Regina, now wanting to teach this young lady, but having nowhere to begin.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...what do we do now?&quot; asked Aziz. &quot;The djinn had said before I got here that we were competing to be an exemplar, and a champion of the gods. Apparently if we win, we get a lot of cool magic powers like Buffy&#39;s witch friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aziz had been a fan of American paranormal TV shows like the aforementioned Buffy the Vampire Slayer as well as True Blood and Supernatural. She wondered if real magic was anything like what was shown on those shows, or something more mundane. She hoped it was exciting. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure&quot; admitted Regina. &quot;Like I said, I&#39;m not even sure I actually believe in any of this&quot; she said. &quot;C&#39;mon, lets look for some assistance.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two new women, farther away from home than they could ever hope to be, wandered the impossibly large library. Regina had visited the Library of Congress, and this was easily at least ten times larger, with stacks of books that reached towards an impossibly tall ceiling. It was like out of a fever dream, or a fantasy novel. <br />
<br />
Eventually they had reached a librarian, who was a shockingly normal looking black man, who had been helping another patron. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; said Aziz. &quot;Where are we exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
The librarian smiled. &quot;We don&#39;t have a name for this place, exactly. This library is unofficially called the Hall of Akashic Records, but we&#39;re nowhere close to their collection. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re both here to be the next head sorcerer of Earth?&quot; <br />
<br />
Aziz and Regina, not knowing what to say, nodded like children. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if that&#39;s the case, and judging by your posture, you both have no experience with the occult?&quot;<br />
<br />
Regina shook her head. Aziz, who was a skeptic but nonetheless had been raised in a superstitious household, in a theocratic kingdom, also shook her head, but more warily than her new friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we have an excellent selection of books on magic. In fact, that&#39;s our job&quot; he laughed. &quot;I would suggest that you two peruse our database first though, to help you narrow down your educational interests.&quot;<br />
<br />
The librarian snapped his fingers, and a pair of computer monitors, desks and chairs suddenly materialized in an empty space just a few feet away.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This database is massive, so your search terms have to be very specific, but there&#39;s also an A.I that can probe your mind and help you narrow your search further. Let me know if you need anything, you two&quot; he said, handing them both library cards. &quot;All you have to do is hold these in your hands and ask for Reggie, and I&#39;ll appear to assist you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Reggie the librarian than teleported away. <br />
<br />
Regina was shaking her head. &quot;I still can&#39;t believe all this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aziz, holding her hand to her chin. &quot;Listen, I&#39;m going to go explore. I actually like reading physical books. I&#39;ll be right nearby. That man piqued my interest.&quot;<br />
<br />
She walked down a row of books, still within Regina&#39;s sight, and pulled out a big tome of spells used in intermediate witchcraft. Regina turned around, and intrigued by the computer that had appeared out of nowhere, sat down and turned it on. To her shock, she found the OS very easy to use and understand. It had everything that the regular internet did, but also so much more. She clicked on the icon representing the database of this library.<br />
<br />
Regina searched through this mystical internet,  discovering knowledge not just on so called magic, but on physics that was tens of thousands of years ahead of Earth&#39;s, from hundreds of thousands of different worlds. What had stunned Regina was how elegant and simple all of the proofs, facts, and figures seemed. It seemed that the more advanced physics became, conversely, the easier it was to understand in simple terms. She figured that she could easily teach this stuff to even a remedial high school physics class. It made the teacher beam with pride that Einstein&#39;s dream of a unified field theory was not only on the right track, but it appeared to be a reality, and a reality that was beyond even that great man&#39;s dreams. Regina reflected upon this knowledge, and it what it would mean for Earth if she could only get back there. If she could somehow dump all of this information into the public domain, allowing any researcher or engineer to take advantage of its implications, it would utterly revolutionize Earth and make this so called &quot;Great Change&quot; seem like a minor inconvenience in comparison. It would, if government and business were willing to take advantage of this alien knowledge, transform the planet into the center of a rapidly expanding stellar empire. <br />
<br />
Aziz, meanwhile, sitting at another desk, had become absorbed in her book, whispering spells to herself as she unconsciously twirled her new long hair around her finger. She held in her other hand a floating green orb made of smokeless fire and capable of incinerating anything in the known universe. It was rotating slowly, waiting for Aziz to use. He had no way of knowing how far above his paygrade this was for a beginner.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;Inspired choice, brother. Aziz will be tough competition for my exemplar to beat, and all the other competitors besides.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reece Chung was equally inspired, my beautiful sister. I see her becoming a very potent sorceress. It&#39;s poetic, too. If you had not saved her from her despair, she would not have come out of it, and she would have killed herself. How does it feel to save a life for once?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It feels...magical.&quot;<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;Since you two worthless cunts are unable to adequately please me&quot; began Kira as she eagerly embraced her new life and role, &quot;I want to see you two make out with one another for at least thirty minutes. The filthier, the better, but it&#39;s all good. Just be natural you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that make you a cuckold?&quot; asked Dana innocently.<br />
<br />
&quot;The punishment just got a half hour longer, snowflake&quot; smiled Kira from her seat. <br />
<br />
Dana was completely naked like an animal while Mandy was dressed only in her underwear. She removed her bra and panties, leaving them on the floor for Kira to smell and walked up to Kira&#39;s new acquisition. Mandy began the punishment by intimately stroking Dana&#39;s curly brown hair, wanting the ease the new girl into the lifestyle. Dana lifted up Mandy&#39;s left boob and began to lick it...<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Scientists and researchers were now beginning to realize the impact of Greta and Jean&#39;s wish to eliminate the effects of man made climate change. Carbon dioxide was now down to pre-industrial levels, ocean acidity was down to a manageable quantity, and overall, the environment was now in a much better, healthier place than it had been compared to literally just the day before. The thing that had been the biggest red flag was a wildfire blazing throughout southern California. The intensity of the wildfire had been overwhelming to the firefighters and other first responders. Seemingly all of a sudden though, the fire&#39;s heat had been reduced, almost like a person had turned the thermostat down, and then the now reduced fire had been quickly extinguished within an hour.<br />
<br />
One firefighter shook her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;I just don&#39;t get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The President had been informed of this news. A conference was being scheduled. Somebody, somebody human, was clearly making world altering events happen. Somebody with that amount of power was dangerous. The speech she had made the other night had alluded to an all-female world being a kinder, gentler, more rational world, but whoever was making these changes apparently couldn&#39;t just let a good thing ride.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Greta and Jean were now married. Greta&#39;s wishes had altered reality so that the psychologist and her secretary had been officially hitched for six months, the ceremony and paperwork already haven taken place and even photos of them on their imaginary honeymoon in the Bahamas had materialized from absolutely nothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;What did we ever do without this thing?&quot; sniggered Greta, staring at her ring finger. Earlier she had also made several other wishes. She had wished for ISIS to lay down their arms and turn themselves in, for every dictatorship to relinquish its iron grip and become a democracy, and for all the deserts of the world to become new Eden like sources of flora and fauna. The ring&#39;s magic made it glow yet again...</p>
