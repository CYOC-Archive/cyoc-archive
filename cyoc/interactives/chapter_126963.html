<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty sat on the grass, pants hastily pulled back over his crotch, staring at his sleeping... lover? Girlfriend? Mate?! <br />
After the heady rush of sex left his brain, the sheer outrageousness of what just happened began to sink into his mind, a chill of shock rushing down his spine. He&#39;d never KISSED a girl, let alone fuck one as wildly as he just did. And he didn&#39;t kiss girls that used to be woodland creatures that he had just willed into sapience. This was... this was insane. <br />
<br />
He started to get that same overwhelming feeling of distress that drove him to wander into the woods, and nearly started hyperventilating. But he took another look at her... and calmed down. She was so. Well... Beautiful. Sure, deers weren&#39;t the classical image of human beauty but she didn&#39;t look like a weird hybrid or aberration. She looked like she was -right-. <br />
<br />
For a brief second, he felt a flash of paranoia, that she&#39;d wander off once she was done with him, and considered using his power to make her loyal to him, but shook it off immediately feeling sick with himself. She wouldn&#39;t -do- that, she... She was his -friend- at the very least. It was just that he was so unused to anything honestly want to be around him. His shitty home-life and general social anxiety made it hard to find someone who genuinely wanted to be around him. He had some friends in school, sure, but they were social outcast dorks like him, so they were drawn together more by circumstance than by mutual feelings of friendship. <br />
<br />
No. He wouldn&#39;t make her love him. This Deer was the first person in what felt like an eternity to make him feel wanted, and he wasn&#39;t going to spoil that. But maybe he could do something else... She looked radiant, sitting in the grass, sun shining on her fur, but just because she was changed once doesn&#39;t mean she couldn&#39;t be changed again. Ty blushed as he played her transformation over again in his head, and felt a tremble below. He shook his head again. <br />
<br />
On of the reasons he had been so scared by the prospect of having this awesome power was precisely because of this. Ty had always had a fascination with the concept of transformation. Looking up stories and art online when he had the house to himself (He always cleared his search history of course), imagining scenes of people transforming into horny animal hybrids, and as time went on even weirder ideas. It was a secret fetish he had nursed for a good couple years now, and when he realized he could potentially live that fantasy out, the thought of losing control to his desires terrified him. He was deeply ashamed, but he had even sometimes imagined his foster family being transformed, both as a perverse fascination, and as an expression of his desire for a family that was nicer to him. <br />
<br />
Perversion on the mind made him realize something. Fuck, he was FIFTEEN. The Deer had no reason to know, but it was still kind of a bad thing for a minor to be screwing around... And then it hit Ty. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I was physically 18 years old.&quot; He said, impulsively. He groaned as he suddenly felt years of development hit his body all at once, his clothes first stretching taught over his body before growing just enough to fit him. <br />
<br />
He looked over himself. It was strange with how... normal he looked. He had some more body hair, he was definitely taller, and his hair was a little longer, probably an inadvertent effect. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Came a soft voice from beside him. &quot;Now you&#39;re changing too?&quot; <br />
<br />
The deer had come to, and was now kneeling beside him, hoofy-hand on his shoulder, rubbing it appreciatively. &quot;Mmm, you&#39;re all big now! I kind of miss you being so smooth and cute, but this is nice too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well-&quot; He stopped, unused to the sound of his voice. He cleared his throught and started up again. &quot;Well. Uh What just happened was sort of spur of the moment. Humans my age sort of aren&#39;t supposed to do... That.&quot; <br />
<br />
She cocked her head. &quot;But you were very eager to do so Ty.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Er.&quot; He coughed. &quot;Yeah. Still, it&#39;s sort of illegal. ...Do you know what law is?&quot;<br />
<br />
She hmm&#39;d. &quot;I think I have the -concept- of law up here. But I couldn&#39;t say anything in specific. Still, I think one of your law men would be unsure what to do with a talking deer, wouldn&#39;t they?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty laughed nervously, appreciating her humor. &quot;Yeah! Hah... They, they&#39;d probably not know to call a squad-car or an animal control van.&quot;<br />
<br />
She giggled, then giggled even more, &quot;O-ho! Laughter! It&#39;s lovely! You humans have been hogging so many good things!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m happy to share them with you.&quot; Responded Ty, blushing. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re quite romantic Ty, did you know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; he blushed. &quot;Uh... Oh. You don&#39;t have a name yet do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her ears pointed up as that fact hit her. &quot;You&#39;re right! I don&#39;t have a name! How strange, suddenly having a sense of self. Hm. What would you suggest?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty sat in thought, wracking his brain. Delilah? No. No alliteration. Artemis? A little too intellectual. He took a deep breath, then threw out his idea. &quot;How about... Kaylee?&quot; <br />
<br />
She smiled, seemingly rolling it around in her head. &quot;Kaylee. Kaylee. I&#39;m Kaylee... Yes, that sounds good!  My name is now Kaylee! Thank you so much!&quot; Said the newly christened deer, hugging Ty. Her breasts pushed against his side, and he chuckled nervously, anxious about jumping into sexual urges again so soon. <br />
<br />
She noticed his hesitation. &quot;Oh, yes. I am naked. That&#39;s something we&#39;ll have to do something about, isn&#39;t it?&quot; She gasped. &quot;You could give me some clothes!&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty blinked. &quot;Oh hey, I could! Uh, what kind of clothes would you like?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shrugged. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t know! There must be so many kinds to try!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty thought for a second, then realized this wasn&#39;t a problem. &quot;I wish Kaylee was wearing an outfit that she would like.&quot; <br />
<br />
And like that, there was a sort of blurring of reality, and suddenly Kaylee was clad in, by Ty&#39;s gauging, a very tasteful outfit, comprising of a green t-shirt with an image of a forest on it, and a plaid skirt. She looked down in surprise and clapped her hands together in glee. &quot;Wow! This is nice! I love having clothes!&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty was so impressed by Kaylee. She felt both completely at ease with what was happening, but wondrously excited by everything new. Which, for her, was a lot. <br />
<br />
&quot;It looks good on you!&#39; Ty commented. Kaylee smiled, and then reached forward, pulling him in for a kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, we&#39;re really a thing aren&#39;t we?&quot; Ty said, heart beginning to pound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course so you silly human! I am very settled on the prospect of us being... hm. The human term for mate is boyfriend and girlfriend, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, then I am your girlfriend, and you are my boyfriend. The matter is concluded. Now we can move on to business!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What business?&quot; Asked Ty confusedly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever we want!&quot; Shouted Kaylee excitedly. &quot;Don&#39;t you see Ty? Your power can do anything! WE can do anything! I&#39;ve just been given the gift of life, I&#39;m not going to just stand around in the woods for the rest of it. We can go anywhere Ty, do any kind of thing we please! You can just wish it so!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty sat back down, the weight of what she was saying hitting him. It was true. This power, it wasn&#39;t just a burden, it was liberation. He could visit Paris, Japan and Australia in the same day! He could eat at the most exclusive restaurants in the world. He could see sights other people could only dream of, and best of all, he had someone he could share it with. He swallowed hard, excitement filling his mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;And...&quot; Kaylee continued, turning her gaze shyly. &quot;We could have more fun changing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty sputtered. &quot;Bh-wha?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee giggled nervously, rubbing her arm. &quot;Well... When you changed me... it felt very very good. And now I think I quite like the idea of you being able to change me. For fun. You don&#39;t have to right now, I mean you just made me these lovely clothes, but, you know... when we&#39;re alone and feeling like experimenting. Or we could find other things to transform! Transforming was so wonderful for me, maybe others would find it as good!&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>
Ty gulped. Just what was he going to do next?</h3>
