<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sean was still checking out his changes when his annoying roommate came home, and walked in to Sean's room. &quot;Hey dude you in here man&quot; Jay said in his
<br>
 californian accent, &quot;yea I'm in the bathroom Ill be out in a sec, alright&quot; Sean said grabbing the chronivac up and programming it for Jay's body. /weight 200 /height
<br>
 6'1&quot; /change to weight 98lbs/height 5'8&quot;. Sean wanted him to be skinny as hell and didn't want a smaller height to compact his soon to be smaller weight level, he
<br>
 programmed in time to complete change 48/hrs and walked out to meet Jay &quot;Hey you workin out dude or what, you finally got some weight that scrawny body
<br>
 man&quot; Jay said with a grin, &quot;yea I'm surprised you didn't notice before now Jay,&quot; Sean said aiming the device at Jays shirtless torso, Jay flinched when it hit him and
<br>
 gave Sean an angry look &quot;man what was that for asshole! That shit stings man! What is it anyway?&quot; &quot;Oh nothin just a bug zapper, didn't mean to hurt ya Jay. Well
<br>
 your still standing so I guess your not a bug. &quot;Sean said putting his new toy in his lockable drawer, and following Jay out into their living room. &quot;Man that sucks man
<br>
 my chest feels funny now dude, let me shoot you with it dude. &quot;Jay said in his normal stupid tone he was still rubbing his chest. &quot;Sorry about that man just take it
<br>
 easy guy, your friend Mark called he wants you to go to the bar tonight, you gonna go?&quot; Sean said distracting Jay long enough for him to let it go. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;You coming with us man?&quot; Jay asked, &quot;Yea, why not it'll be fun.&quot; Sean said while he was calculating the time line for the change in Jays weight, at just a little over
<br>
 two pounds an hour weight loss. It was 10:00 A.M. now and they would probably leave by 7 that evening, so Jay would be about 19 and half pounds lighter by
<br>
 then, and 2 inches shorter. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark came over at 12noon he was a handsome guy to Sean at 6 foot even and weighing about 190lbs with thick blonde hair, a nicely trimmed goatee and dimpled
<br>
 cheeks. He was the epitome of cute to Sean, 'What can I do to this guy' Sean thought. He was getting impatient waiting for the changes in Jay to take place and
<br>
 thought he would just accelerate his changes a little and hit poor Mark with the same thing. It'll be fun watching these two strong good-looking guys go from stud to
<br>
 dud, in a matter of hours. Sean went to his room and programmed his new settings in while Mark and Jay watched TV and downed some beers. Sean
<br>
 programmed weight loss/50% IN 2 HOURS/HEIGHT/6INCHES and went to the store to buy some jeans that fit him better, He'd wait till they were ready to
<br>
 leave for the bar before he hit them with his new settings. Besides, that would put Jay at about 181lbs and 5'11&quot; inches tall when they got ready to leave. 
<br>

<br>
 Time went by pretty quickly and Jay decided it was time for him to get changed for the bar. It was 6:30 PM, and Jay had lost 19Lbs by then, Jay got out his
<br>
 favorite tight fitting jeans. He and Mark loved to show off their bodies so they always wore skintight jeans to the bar. Jay began to get dressed and noticed that his
<br>
 jeans didn't seem to be that tight on him, in fact they were loose and seemed to be a little long as well and the cuffs bunched up around his socked feet. Jay knew
<br>
 that Sean had gone to the store earlier and thought about asking him for a pair of Sean's new jeans. &quot;Hey Sean can you come in here for a sec dude&quot; Jay asked
<br>
 nicely for once. &quot;What's up Jay&quot; Sean said as he walked into Jays room, he almost laughed at poor Jay standing there in jeans that were obviously to big for him
<br>
 now. &quot;Wow dude your loosing weight and I'm gaining ain't that some shit&quot; Sean just had to say something. &quot;Ha Ha asshole, I was gonna ask ya if I could borrow a
<br>
 pair of your new jeans dude all the ones that fit me real good are still dirty man&quot; Jay said trying to make Sean not dwell on his now obvious weight loss. &quot;Sure I
<br>
 washed and dried them though so they might be to small for ya though?&quot; Sean knew they wouldn't be if any thing they'd still be to long on Jay. 
<br>

<br>
 Sean went to his room and got the jeans and put the device in the back pocket of his new size 32/32 jeans and went to the living room first. Mark was watching
<br>
 TV and scratching his balls through his own tight jeans and not paying any attention to him, so Sean aimed at the skin between his tight fitting muscle tee and struck
<br>
 him with the beam, Mark swatted at his back and started to turn around Sean ducked around the corner before he saw him and went to Jays room. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Here try these there a little big on me so they might fit you&quot; Sean said handing them to Jay, Jay turned around to put them on his bed and Sean hit him with the
<br>
 beam and quickly left before Jay turned around. Jay and Mark both felt the shot but couldn't figure what it was and put it out of there minds, Jay got dressed and
<br>
 the jeans although a little to long fit him like a glove &quot;Man size 32s wow I guess I have lost weight&quot; Jay said putting his once tight fitting 33/34s on his bed, and went
<br>
 to meet Mark and Sean in the living room so they could leave for the bar. 
<br>

<br>
 Sean had stayed sober while the two now shrinking studs drank all day so he would do all the driving that night. Sean put the chronivac in a gym bag and took it
<br>
 with him, Sean hadn't calculated in the time it would take to get to the bar and both Mark and Jay wear changing faster and more visibly than he expected, the trip
<br>
 to the bar only took about 7 minutes by car but at nearly 25lbs of weight lose every 15 minutes it was beginning to show on the guys. Jay got out first his jeans
<br>
 were a little loose on him now but he didn't seem to notice that he'd lost over 15Lbs already and was a inch and a half shorter all he knew was he had to piss out
<br>
 that last beer, Jay also had to go and even though his jeans that he barrowed from Sean were now as loose as his own had been he just followed Mark to the john.
<br>

<br>

<br>
 Sean took out his device and punched up a mind control setting to keep the guys from noticing the changes in either themselves or each other, Sean knew they
<br>
 would eventually notice the changes, even though they both had belts on they'd eventually run out of holes to tighten there belts to hold there jeans up. But the first
<br>
 hour would be fun at least, Mark finished his piss and began to tighten his belt he noticed that his jeans felt loose around his waist and that he had to tighten his belt
<br>
 a notch more than he normally did, Jay also noticed the same thing when he was tightening his belt 'damn I already tightened this belt two more notches at the house
<br>
 and now I'm doing another hole, maybe I'm sick or something' he thought as he left the john. Sean quickly struck both guys with the beam and they quickly forgot
<br>
 about there belts. 
<br>

<br>
 The bar was a laid back type of bar by the ocean and shirts weren't required so both Jay and Mark had taken off there shirts like they always did, and were
<br>
 playing a game of pool with two young girls, Sean just sat at a table and watched the changes, 45 minutes had passed since Sean hit the guys at home and they
<br>
 were both showing major as yet to be known to them changes, Mark had lost 38Lbs and 3 inches, while the double dose that Sean had given poor Jay had cost
<br>
 Jay 40Lbs more loss for a total of sixty pounds and 5inches in height. Even though there jeans now were riding down there once thick thighs and there underwear
<br>
 were clearly visible above the waist line of there now baggy as hell jeans neither guy seemed to notice it, but the young girls had, &quot;man your loosing weight bro&quot; one
<br>
 girl said to Mark pulling on the excess fabric of his crotch area hanging low between his dwindling legs. &quot;HEY STOP THAT BITCH!&quot; Mark said in a inebriated
<br>
 voice, and stumbled back as he pulled away. The beers were now working on a smaller frame and Mark was getting to drunk to even stand strait let alone notice
<br>
 the changes ray or not, Jay hadn't drunk any thing since he left the house so he was actually coming down from his earlier buzz, and also was beginning to notice his
<br>
 weight loss again, his jean were now huge on him and he also noticed that he was no longer taller than the two girls, he looked down at his jeans and they were
<br>
 about to fall around his knees that were now hidden in a large mass of denim resting on now loose boots. &quot;I'm shrinking dude&quot; Jay said looking at Mark with a look
<br>
 of fear on his face, &quot;and so are you man&quot; Jay said walking toward Mark to help him stay on his feet. &quot;No youshr nsot manss&quot; Mark slurred almost incoherently,
<br>
 &quot;Were just drunk dude,thast alsh&quot; Mark said tripping in the jeans that had rode down his thighs to his knees, Jay watched him fall backwards with jeans around his
<br>
 calves and his now baggy boxer briefs threatening to do the same thing, Mark tried to get up but he was now way to drunk to, and he started to piss right there.
<br>
 It'd been almost a hour and fifteen minutes by then and Sean knew it was time to take these two has been hunks home before something else happened, &quot;come on
<br>
 its time to go Jay&quot; Sean said to the now 110Lb 5'5inch Jay. &quot;I'm shrinking Sean help me please&quot; Jay pleaded vainly to Sean &quot;no your not your just drunk that's all,
<br>
 lets get Mark and go home!&quot; Sean said sternly trying to keep Jays mind off what was happening to him. Jay went to help Mark up &quot;Man your a wimp man your
<br>
 skinny as hell dude what happened to you&quot; Mark said as Jays now thin arm reached down to help the piss soaked former stud up. Sean pushed the little guy away
<br>
 from Mark and helped Mark to his feet Mark reached down and pulled his jeans up they slipped over his thin thighs easily even with his belt tighter than before,
<br>
 &quot;what's happened to me Sean&quot; Mark said looking down at his oversized jeans, the girls were starring at the two guys as Sean led them away, they were both
<br>
 holding up there jeans past there navels all the muscles they had were now gone and both were becoming aware of it.</p>
