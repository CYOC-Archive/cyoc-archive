<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Though her parents were enjoying each other&#39;s company, Julie found herself missing HER Eric. She was lonely, simple as that. The nurses came in every once in a while to check on her, but she had no other company aside from that. <br />
<br />
“What am I supposed to do? Just sit here and stew?” she wondered. Julie supposed she could spend her time thinking about the impending surgery. She still didn’t understand how any of this happened. No one told her anything, but they all expected her to jus too along with things like some kind of mindless robot. <br />
<br />
Dr. Tachibana and her parents had explained as delicately as they could that Julie had suffered a small aneurysm in her frontal lob, and needed surgery to prevent it from “making things worse”. Which begged the question, what was wrong? Aside from the apparent aneurysm, Julie felt fine. Much better now, knowing that Eric was here with her, and not that clone. <br />
<br />
She took a moment to wonder where that imposter was? Julie instantly knew that wasn’t HER Eric. Maybe he drawled back into whatever hole he came out of. Or once HER Eric appeared the other knew it wouldn’t be able to win over Julie’s affections. <br />
<br />
Outside Julie’s room, two guards were still stationed just incase the patient felt like going on another “run”. But Julie had no intention of trying to escape again. So long as they let Eric visit her again. <br />
<br />
“I wonder where he is now…?” <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The man of the hour was at home, finishing breakfast with his mother and brother before going over to his girlfriend’s house. Nate was sitting on their couch eating his breakfast. He and Alex hadn’t made any plans until the afternoon. Which meant he had several hours to finally buck up and tell his mother he was in a relationship with Alex. And more to a point, that he was gay. <br />
<br />
Martha was trapped in a bubble of bliss, even though her night with the Twists had been cut a bit short. She’d forgotten how refreshing those intimate nights were. Part of her still longed to have William there with her, but for the first time in a long time, she felt like she had a reason to smile. <br />
<br />
After cleaning his plate, Eric dashed upstairs to grab his backpack. Then flew down the stairs and out the front door. <br />
<br />
“Try to stay out of trouble dear,” Martha said as Eric left. He blushed, knowing that in the past two days alone he’d caused more trouble than he had in his entire life. <br />
<br />
“I know Mom. I’ll see you later.” he said. <br />
<br />
“Leave your phone on!” Martha called after her son. But Eric was already gone. Part of her wondered how Eric was planning on getting there. Though at the rate he was traveling, Eric would be at Cassie’s house in two minutes. <br />
<br />
“I’m glad he’s happy. Looks like all that business with Julie is finally behind him.” Martha thought. <br />
<br />
“Hey Mom, can we talk?” Nate walked back into the kitchen, having finished his breakfast. <br />
<br />
“Sure. Something wrong?” Martha saw that Nate had a particularly troubled expression on his face. She’d been so absorbed in Eric’s problems, she wondered for a moment if she’d neglected Nate. <br />
<br />
“No. Everything’s going great. But that’s what I wanted to talk to you about.” Nate started, placing his plate and cutlery in the dishwasher. <br />
<br />
“Alright.” Martha wiped her hands on a towel and turned to face her elder son. <br />
<br />
“I… I’ve been seeing someone for a while now.” <br />
<br />
“Okay.” This wasn’t really news to Martha. Nate came home smelling like sex more often than not. The only question she had was who the lucky lady was. Was that what Nate wanted to talk to her about? <br />
<br />
“God forbid he knocked someone up.” she thought. <br />
<br />
“You see, I’ve been, uh, seeing someone different. And I just couldn’t really think of how to tell you. What with everything that’s been going on and then everything with Eric.” Nate said. <br />
<br />
“Whatever it is you have to tell me, just say it Nate. I promise I won’t be angry or disappointed. But I have to ask, are you planning on telling Eric what you’re about to tell me?” Martha knew that if the two started keeping secrets from each other it could undo all the bonding they’d done these past few weeks. <br />
<br />
“Oh, no. He already knows.” <br />
<br />
“Really?” <br />
<br />
“Ya. You’re not mad I told him first are you?” <br />
<br />
“Considering I don’t know what you told him, or what you’re planning on telling me, I can’t say. Chances are I won’t be mad either way. You haven’t gotten some girl pregnant have you?”<br />
<br />
“What? Oh god no! No, definitely not. You don’t have to worry about that, I promise!” Nate assured his mother.<br />
<br />
“So she’s taking the pill?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, well no. I mean, I’m not seeing a… SHE.” Nate said quietly. He could practically hear the pieces clicking into place in his mother’s head. Nate stood in silence as his mother processed everything, and waited for her response. When she didn’t say anything, Nate worried she was angry at him. <br />
<br />
But instead, he found a pair of arms around him. Nate blinked in surprise before returning the tight embrace. <br />
<br />
“Uh, Mom?” he asked. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, I’m just happy you’ve found someone. Who is he?” Martha asked. <br />
<br />
“Alex.”<br />
<br />
“That certainly explains a lot.” Martha thought, but didn’t say. She’d noticed the looks Alex gave Nate. She never saw Nate return them, so she assumed the attraction was one sided. But apparently Nate had been retuning more than just dirty looks with Alex. Nate’s relationship with Alex also explained why Nate never smelled like a female in the morning. <br />
<br />
Female weres had distinct scents, no matter what species. It was obvious Eric spent the night with Cassie, while Nate simply smelled like sex. His scent mixed with Alex’s, more so since they were both werewolves. <br />
<br />
“So, just to clarify, you’re not mad?”<br />
<br />
“Why on earth should I be mad? And on another note, when did you tell Eric?”<br />
<br />
“Well actually he figured it out himself. But, I don’t know, I just thought you wouldn’t approve or you’d be…”<br />
<br />
“Nathaniel William Anderson, can you honestly see me being angry with your being gay?” Martha asked her son point blank. It was the first time in a long time she’d used his full name. And more to point, the first time she’d said “WILLIAM” out loud to either of her sons. <br />
<br />
“Guess I was just being paranoid.” Nate blushed again. <br />
<br />
Martha pulled him in for another hug, glad both sons had found some happiness in the wake of their father’s death. The only thing that would have made the moment better was if William could have been there too.</p>
