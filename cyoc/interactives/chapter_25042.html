<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was almost deleted as soon as I opened it - it looked a lot like one of those spam emails that promise you XP or Adobe products cheap. But this one did not get caught in my spam filter and I looked at it, intrigued by the subject (yes, I know, spam often does have intriguing subjects).<br />
This was an add-on to assorted popular graphics programs (including the one I use most) that sat as a client on your machine but connected to a server which provided something very different... it could put you into a picture of your choice and connecting a mike, some headphones and some eye goggles gave you a virtual reality experience. There was even a trial offer of one free experience. Now my ex-flatmate had left some VR goggles around here somewhere... Oh there they are!<br />
I should normally have deleted the email there and then but the idea sounded intriguing.. I clicked the link and after the usual dialog box asking for open or save and a further 15 minute download I was asked to restart the computer and I'd be set. Up it cam and a new icon on the desktop labelled put yourself in the picture appeared. I clicked on it and after a quick boot up the program asked if I wanted it to guide me thru the experience. I said yes to that and it asked me to choose a &quot;from&quot; picture of myself; I pushed the button to browse my folders and found one. It then asked me to choose a &quot;to&quot;one from it's sample library; there were some beautiful scenery ones and a fun fair ride or two, even a war scene, but the one that really intrigued me most was the dungeon one.  I clicked on that and it errored, saying that I had not put myself into that picture yet and offered to open my graphics program for me - I said yes and it loaded the dungeon photo and it the photo of me. It then told me to choose a character and said there were two options in this destination; I could see one was a curvaceous woman in a dominatrix outfit and the other a muscleman in a leather harness, codpiece and a hood, somewhat like an executioner might wear in a fantasy. I chose the man of course and clicked on his image, it immediately told me I had to drag my picture onto the character so I quickly did that. It then asked me to save into &quot;temporary storage&quot; or not and having said yes that it had saved the information. It closed the graphics program down and instructed me to &quot;load the VR goggles and headphones&quot;. I put them on and it issued a &quot;hardware detected and recalibrated for trial-level maximum sensation&quot; message. <br />
Immediately everything went dark and a cold chill overtook my body. I suddenly felt my arms grabbed and one was held in place while the other was stretched above my head; I could feel what felt like restraints being pulled over my outstretched arm's hand and as soon as that was complete the process being repeated with the other hand. My legs were then grabbed and spread with restraints being placed around each ankle. As the first one tightened I felt myself drop a little, now the restraints of my hands were what was keeping my upright; the second ankle was quickly secured before I had a thought to try to resist.<br />
&quot;Okay slave&quot; I hear a voice say in a soft but at the same time harsh tone. &quot;Get ready for your punishment&quot;.<br />
I felt as though what ever I was being restrained with was being moved under me and suddenly my weight shifted as though I was hanging from the restraints, my hands only a foot or so higher than my feet.<br />
&quot;Crack&quot; I heard and instantly feel a searing pain on my back, soon followed by another. It felt like my skin was burning yet curiously I could feel my cock in the codpiece come alive and start straining at the tight black leather. The whippings started to gather speed and were spread evenly over both sides of my back and extended down towards my butt. My cock was by now uncomfortably rubbing in its tight confines. As suddenly as they started the whipping stopped and I could hear breathing near my ear. <br />
&quot;Slave, be prepared what's coming next because if you scream it will only get worse for you.&quot;<br />
My mouth moved with me directing it and a low guttural &quot;Yes Mistress&quot; came out of it thru the hood.<br />
I heard her step back and a whooshing sound and suddenly my back was stinging with icy cold water and as the initial shock wore off I realised the water contained salt and each of the welts on my back was stinging intensely. Strangely my cock just got harder and I could feel the leather straps straining to hold it on.<br />
&quot;Well done, slave&quot; I heard and I could feel fingers undoing the straps holding the codpiece on. The cold chill as it came free was barely noticeable against the stinging on my back but I could tell my balls were now being dragged down and being strapped inside something that strongly pulled them towards the ground. A leather ball stretcher perhaps, with weights attached?<br />
I had only just got accustomed to the sensation when my left butt cheek was assaulted in many points which stung simultaneously followed by a surface that pushed strongly against the skin. A studded paddle, perhaps? The right was quickly similarly assaulted and just as a rhythm established it stopped and became random. My cock was now straight and true - and much larger and heavier than I recalled, as were my balls that were trying to draw themselves back towards my body with no success.<br />
The paddling stopped and I felt my cock being grabbed and being tied with something; laces perhaps. As this was completed the eye was being opened and something was being forced into it. It felt like a pea or a ball bearing maybe - it was colder than a pea might be. <br />
Finally my nipples were being pinched and a sharp pain indicated something clamping on to them almost simultaneously. As my cock twitched at the sensation an almost identical motion on the clamps caused pain in the nipples.    <br />
&quot;Whack&quot; came the paddle again on my left buttock and my cock twitched again, nipple pain responding of course. The paddling resumed in haphazard fashion and I could feel something being forced up inside my cock. Suddenly the buttock pain stopped and a moment later I could feel a heat source coming from below my balls. The heat became more intense and still my cock twitched and my nipples were now becoming painful even when no motion caused the clamps to bite.<br />
Suddenly it was like a red hot poker touched my balls and with a final intense spasming my cock spurted forth cum and my nipples burnt with the biting of the clamps. It was such an intense feeling it felt an age before the words &quot;trial ended - game over&quot; appeared in my vision and light started to overtake the darkness. I was convinced that I would be completely covered with cum but when I took off the goggles and headphones I saw that of course I was still wearing my pants and they were now wet thru with sweat and cum.<br />
If this could work like this with a trial what would the real one be like and how much fun with my fantasy photos could I have? The screen was displaying a dialog box saying &quot;Buy now or later&quot;. I grabbed my wallet, extracted my credit card and clicked on the &quot;Buy now&quot; box immediately. <br />
On being approved and having a license key sent to me, I typed it in quickly and decided I couldn't wait to change before trying out...</p>
