<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he putting the balloon back in the drawer Judy comes to the room.<br />
<br />
“What’s that you holding there?”, Judy says as she sees the balloon.<br />
<br />
“Just a balloon” he says trying to convince her.<br />
<br />
“Then you don’t mind if I take it”, Judy says. But As she touched it, an electric shock hit her hand. As Jim saw that he decides to tell her the truth.<br />
<br />
“It’s a magic balloon, that make me younger, restore me and now make you older as change your thing too much you. But only I can touch it because I am the owner.”, Jim says relived.<br />
<br />
“Prove it”, Judy demanded. Then They listen the door of the house opens.<br />
<br />
“Ok I just make Dani younger or you.”, Jim says<br />
<br />
“Oh, Oh, I know. Make Dani 10 years old so she has to listen to us.” Judy says.<br />
<br />
“Slowly or instant, with or without her clothes?”, Jim asks, as he tries to show his powers<br />
<br />
“Slowly but without her clothes.” Judy says excited.<br />
<br />
Jim blows, with the machine, enough air to the balloon to regress her 7 years and regulates the machine to leave the air not fast but faster than entered when Judy aging.<br />
<br />
“Control Dani’s age”, He says and starts the machine.<br />
<br />
“Hi Dani”, Jim says as they enter the living room and see her exit the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Hi, I see you grown some more”, Dani says as she approached and sees that they are almost equal to height.<br />
<br />
“Yea, I am 5’8” tall, how about you?”, Judy asks<br />
<br />
“Last time I check I was 5’9” tall.”, Dani responds<br />
<br />
“Let’s check it out” Judy says, as she shows the measure tape.<br />
<br />
“Ok”, Dani says and go to the wall<br />
<br />
“5’8 ½ “tall” Judy says and Jim agrees<br />
<br />
“Maybe the doctor was wrong, let’s go outside and play the match I own you”, Dani says and go outside.<br />
<br />
“Ok, with little Jimmy as referee”, Judy says and bend and kiss him on the cheek. Then the grab him and drag him outside.<br />
<br />
As the game started the 2 girls seemed equal. When the score was 6-8, in Dani’s favor, Dani try to shoot but she was blocked by Judy. Then Dani saw that Judy was a little bit taller but thought that was in her imagination. After that Judy slowly took the advantage. When the score was 10-10, in Judy’s favor, Judy has the ball try a shoot, Day try to block her but in vain, Dani saw that she looking at Judy’s nose and feel her clothes a little baggy. The shoot was in and the score was 12-10.<br />
<br />
“Time out.”, Dani says.<br />
<br />
“What happen”, Jim and Judy asks.<br />
<br />
“It must be in my imagination but I think I am shrinking”, Dani said as she looked up at June<br />
<br />
“You are right, you seem shorter, let’s retake the measurement”, Judy said. They went inside and took the measurement.<br />
<br />
“Well how tall am I?” Dani asked in terror.<br />
<br />
“5’ 6” tall, you are shrinking!” Judy said surprised.<br />
<br />
“How old you were when you where this tall.”, Jim asked as he saw that she was less developed and with some small pimples and smile.<br />
<br />
“14, the first year I babysat you two”, Dani said and look to the mirror and saw the exact image she had then. She wasn’t disturbed.<br />
<br />
“So, shall we continue the game”, Dani asked smiling.<br />
<br />
 “of course, I maybe little smaller but I have experience.”, Dani said and follow the other you had start walking outside. The game continued. Dani resisted for some time. When the score was 16-12, in Judy’s favor, Judy saw that Dani’s top of her head was at the level of her nose, laughed and lost the ball by that mistake, she catched up with Dani and as June blocked, Dani looked direct and saw Judy’s mouth instead of her nose, try to shoot and Judy blocked without too much effort. In the rest of the match Judy ruled with the score became 22-12, Judy won. By the end of the match the top of the head of Dani’s was at the Judy’s mouth. They got in.<br />
<br />
“Can you remeasure me again I thing I shrunk some more”, Dani said because her clothes were really baggy and Judy measured her for 3rd time.<br />
<br />
“You are 5’1” tall and how old are you Know”, Judy asked and laughing with Jim<br />
<br />
“12”, Dani said as she saw herself in the mirror. She measured her weight and she was 110 pounds<br />
<br />
“Which means since we are all in the same age you can’t boss us around”, Jim said looking up at her<br />
<br />
“I am still taller than you shrimp”, Dani said as she lost her temper and push Jim. Judy simply Laughed. He tried to push her back but he was still weaker and lighter than her. Then Judy ended the scene by passing both of then, for Dani needed much more strength. Then Jim goes to this room and speed up the prosses. Judy went to her house in order to find something to wear. She found some clothes and shoes from different ages put them in a bug wear something that fitted her and went back. After half an hour, she finally calmed down and go Jim’s room to apologize. She got in.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, for my earlier behavior, I just was mad with my situation”, She apologies.<br />
<br />
“I’ll accept your apology if you do as I say for the rest of the day”, Jim says and stand up.<br />
<br />
“Ok, just not something to weird or horrible.”, she said and saw that she was looking directly at Jim’s eyes.<br />
<br />
“You shrunk some more! Let’s remeasure you”, Jim said and grab her hand, she followed. They took the measure tape and measure her.<br />
<br />
“You are 4’10” tall, same as me and a year younger I guess “, Jim said, hold her hand and she agreed. Then she went up to scale and was 90 pounds only bones and muscle no fat.<br />
<br />
“How tall is your girlfriend?”, Judy asks ironically.<br />
<br />
“Same as me and a year younger”, Jim said. Then she kissed him and he surprised and remained still.<br />
<br />
“Do you have a problem with that, Judy”, Dani asks when the kiss end. Jim was speechless. Then she drugged Jim to his room as she took the tape measure and the scale. She hugged him and kissed him again. Jim try to resist but she was still stronger than him. He fought for a moment but after that kissed her back and hugged her. That continued for 30 minutes, to 19:00. He felt her as she shrunk. When this kiss ended she was looking up at him and her clothes were baggie again, the top of her head was at his nose. Lacily Dani had taken the tape.<br />
<br />
“Measure me, my love”, as she said looking up at Jim.<br />
<br />
“4’7” tall, my shorty” said and kissed her</p>
