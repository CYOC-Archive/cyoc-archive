<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I should, like, probably take this to the front of the store!&quot; thought Brittney Barton as she picked up the retro-looking letterman&#39;s jacket. Weirdly, it didn&#39;t have any letters on it...or even a school patch. &quot;It&#39;s probably like a costume piece for some cheap &#39;frat-brother&#39; costume...like, what actual college has purple and black as its school colors?&quot; Brittney honestly didn&#39;t know, which was weird &#39;cause she kept up with a lot of different colleges for cheerleading scholarships, and learning colors and mascots tended to reflect well in the letters to those colleges about the scholarships she wanted...so yeah! This was a weird, fake jacket in a weird store she&#39;d wandered into with her friends, but in any case, it needed to get reshelved, and this store&#39;s system had no rhyme or reason to Brittney! &quot;OK then...where did I come from again?&quot;<br />
<br />
After roaming around the store a bit longer, awkwardly carrying the pretty heavy jacket with one hand, she came across a full body mirror that seemed to be pretty close to the registor (if she&#39;d remembered the store right). The sight of her tiny, slender, and cute bod always cheered her up, and it did that now really well! She&#39;d picked a nice outfit of high cut-off jean shorts (they had legs, so they weren&#39;t those trashy-looking Daisy Dukes) a button-up pink baby-tee (with two buttons undone to accentuate her nice perky B-Cup boobs!) and her cute new Uggs (the normal brown color, like coffee). Her long strawberry blond hair had just been straightened the night before, as her natural wavey hair tended to look like a garbage dump always. Her tummy was nice and flat, which meant that she WAS getting enough exercise, and that she should never listen to Dana, that anoxeric hussy...oh, and of course her face was doll-like as usual! &quot;Nice job on make-up, morning me!&quot; She said, giggling to herself. Then she remembered the jacket was in her hand, and that hand was starting to cramp up something fierce. &quot;OK, let&#39;s just put you on to stop that pain...&quot; She muttered, and started to push the &quot;college male giant&quot; sized jacket onto her teeny-weeny frame. When she was finshed, she looked back in the mirror. Yup, this thing looked absolutely ginormous on her. The ends of it came down to her knees! She started cracking up at the sight of herself, but then an odd thought occured to her. &quot;I don&#39;t look all that bad in these colors, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
The more Brittany stared at the nice look of the jacket on herself, the less dumb it looked on her. And...less big, even! Her shoulders filled it out well at least, if her reflection was one to believe. She&#39;d always had pretty nice, big shoulders, right? Yeah! That was her secret strength for lifting herself or others with her scrawny arms...wait, her arms were scrawny? They sure didn&#39;t look scrawny now, filling out the large sleeves of the jacket. Was this a funhouse mirror trick or...yeah, duh! Of course it was. &quot;Check out these biceps, brother!&quot;, Brittney bragged in a faux-macho tone before bursting into giggles again. Then she coughed. Her throat had suddenly felt really weird. &quot;Ugh, am I getting sick or somethin&#39;?&quot; Her voice felt...raspier and lower than usual. And not only did the mirror really accentuate her large shoulders and arms (&#39;which I&#39;ve always awkwardly had&#39;, she thought), but really brought out her chest, somehow! Like, it almost looked like she was a D-Cup or around there, with maybe some apparent pec muscles b around them....Then she coughed again. &quot;Damn throat tickles...&quot; She muttered, thumping her big, squishy chest. Man, why did her upper body always look so overdefined conpared to her lower body?! She exercised the same way as the other girls on the team, but she still had a big ass and skinny little legs! No wonder she was also the one to get thrown...she could be the base sometimes, y&#39;know?! &quot;Stupid crappy genes!&quot; she exclaimed with an angsty groan. She then giggled at how weird her voice sounded. &quot;Sup, brah? How you doin&#39;? Hittin&#39; the showers so soon? Weak...&quot; Another coughing fit! God damnit, she probably was sick. Her stomach was grumbling all weird now, but then it stopped for some reason. She felt it, then farted reflexively. &quot;...I am a human whoopie cushion. Eff. That. Noise.&quot; She chalked it up to the extra protein concoction she&#39;d tried to make online. That was why you probably never put chickpeas in the smoothie. But feeling her stomach, and seeing it through her tight shirt...&quot;Awww, Lady Six-Pack, it was all for you, and you were totally worth it, y&#39;know? The guys didn&#39;t think I&#39;d bulk up after that dare &#39;cause I was a &quot;skinny little cheerleader skank&quot;, and now I can crunch more times in an hour than those fatasses do in a week.&quot; She then belched for what seemed to be a good minute, and felt oddly dizzy. That happened when you burped, right? Yeah, &#39;cause of CO2 intake or somethin&#39; like that. Anywho...she felt taller. Like, uh, maybe it was the new Timberlands, but her muscley though shaven legs just looked different somehow...it was probably the old pair of jean shorts she was wearing, though! &quot;Shit, I still fit into these things, and I think I last wore &#39;em before freshman year!&quot; Growth spurts were weird, but she&#39;d always looked cute in these jeans as a younger and much smaller middle schooler. &quot;Guess that means my ass WAS always this toned! Sick...&quot; Geez, back then she&#39;d tried to do all sorts of things with her hair, before just realizing she only had to chop like half of its super-duper long length off! Now it only came to halfway between her chin and shoulders, but she could manage it with, like, a tight headband at the worst times. She then giggled at the thought of having crazy Rapunzel-length hair. Hey, as big as she&#39;d gotten, she&#39;d always stayed a cheerleader, just like itsy-bitsy her had always wanted! Who said cheerleading couldn&#39;t make you a goddamn brickhouse of muscle, anyway? &quot;Some asshole, probably.&quot; She said with a nod. Man, this jacket was a lucky find. What place other than her high school had purple and black for school colors? <br />
<br />
After getting back to the register with ease, she spotted her friends Kelly and Tracey. &quot;Hey, Xena! Nice jacket!&quot; shouted Tracey, always the energetic loud one. &quot;Wonder what old alumni guy sold his blank jacket here?&quot; said Kelly in her usual ditzy way. &quot;Hopefully he was a cutie back in the day...&quot; &quot;Uh, Kelly, this has a &quot;new&quot; tag on it.&quot; &quot;Oh! Darn it...&quot; Tracey snickered. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Kells! We can just go to Hollister and actually see guys instead of dreaming of past ones!&quot; Kelly brightned up at that, stepping outside with Tracey as Brittney paid the old man $10. &quot;Thank you, and come again, miss Xena.&quot; The man cheerfully said. &quot;Hey, that isn&#39;t actually my name, Tracey&#39;s just weird, but I&#39;m actually-&quot; &quot;XENA, COME ON! PAY AND LEAVE!&quot; &quot;...whatever. Thanks for the cool find, mister.&quot; &quot;Not a worry at all, miss. No worry at all.&quot; Brittney then left the shop, walking in the middle of Tracey and Kelly while they talked about guys and stuff while walkng to Hollister. Then the inevitable happened: &quot;Ugh, why is it always so cold in here?&quot; Eye rolling from the other 2 parties was performed almost in unison. &quot;Kelly, you&#39;re wearing a belly shirt and a miniskirt in an air conditioned building! That&#39;s probably a cause!&quot; &quot;Seriously, though, I&#39;ll freeze to death soon!&quot; &quot;Hey, take my new jacket, you wuss.&quot; Kelly clapped her hands at the good fortune she had and decent mood big Brittany had at the moment, and thanked God that they were the same height. &quot;Yay! Thanks, Brittany, MY TRUE BEST FRIEND.&quot; &quot;Hey!&quot; After Brittany had gotten the jacket off and onto Kelly, a source of inspriation struck Tracey. &quot;Hey Kells, what sport&#39;s got the hottest guys?&quot; Kelly looked puzzled for a couple of minutes, then hesitantly replied...</p>
