<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">9 months later <br />
<br />
I has gotten mostly comfortable being my mom, seeing myself in the mirror did not make me feel anything out of the ordinary anymore, seeing my now big swollen pregnant tummy and my much bigger breasts fall or milk just made me feel fat but also some  motherly pride, and with only 2 or so weeks before the baby is due what is a boy by the way wanting to know the sex as soon as posable, and the doctors said to her that he is as healthy as anything to me and my dad, who has been a ok husband , he was over the moon when I said he was going to be a dad to another child, a week after having to have sex with him, so he would think that this baby was his and not some random guy I slipped with and got stuck in my mom&#39;s body an till this baby is out of me, and he’s been treating me very nicely buying me stuff I have been Craven,  <br />
<br />
and will my little brother and sister who are for now my kids, have been great specially Teddy my 8 year old brother who has been the most excited about becoming a big brother and I love how he cuddles up next to me on the sofa every night and falls asleep on my lap and now my tummy every evening now I am his mom, and comes to me so existed after school to show and tell me what he did that day and making sure I show up to his soccer games every week <br />
<br />
I guessing it is part of being in are mom&#39;s body, having these loving feelings towards them,  but I felt nothing sexual towards my dad still thank god, and I had to fight him of me when we were in bed for the first two weeks, well I did cave in once after drinking too much and thinking what the hell, I don’t fully remember it but it got a lot more easy to say no and for him to listen to me once I told him I was pregnant, <br />
<br />
I  do not mind how thing are really but I can’t wait to get out of this body, but my mom in my body is the biggest thing what make me feel most uncomfortable, it is not the fact that she is in my body, it is more the fact what she has done to my life. <br />
<br />
She somehow is doing betting in my life than I was, she was getting betting marks, and when I say better, I mean better from be being I was a C student but she making my body be a A to A+ student in less than a week being me, and then there&#39;s the girlfriend she has gotten in my body, I was surprised when I walked in to the sitting room 4 months pregnant seeing my mom and one of the hottest girls in my year making out and touching each other&#39;s bodies, and with my mom seeing me and quickly stops saying “uuumm, hi mom.... this is Katey” looking like the 14 year old boy she is right now and what could I do, I was supposed to be the mom so I just said hi to her and watched them go upstairs to my old room, and then there was all the new friends she made, I don’t know how but she somehow turned my life from being invisible to being one of the most popular kids in school, what I don’t think I could carry on if I go back to my body.  <br />
<br />
so maybe I will switches with someone else, maybe Teddy my little brother, he is healthy and fit, and always so happy, I don’t really want to because any of my sisters but they could be an option, or I could just because someone new, I make from scratch, I have even thought that maybe the baby in my tummy once he is born, of I could raise him to be the perfect perron to swap bodys with, you know make him do stuff like gymnastics and spend a lot of money making to grow up to look perfect, but I still got to get him out of me before I decide to do anything,  putting my hands on my tummy feeling a kick what make me smile, <br />
<br />
I sigh thinking all of that and realise how long I have been sitting on the sofa and hearing the front door open, and seeing my body walk throw it holding his/hers girlfriends hand quickly saying “hi mom” and the girlfriend saying “hi Mrs Smith” with both of the running up starts to do who knows what  and I shouted “keep your door open “having walked in on them with mom shirtless on top of her with both of their hand closes the each other&#39;s privates, and not wanting a another baby member in this house any time seen “hearing her shout in my old annoyed voice “ok mom” and then I suddenly felt wet between my legs and a odd feeling around my stomach, and I knew straight away the it was the baby ready to come out, and new it was only me and my mom in my body in the house and could not help but shout “JEFF, HELP THE BABY IS COMING” less than a second latter hearing bang bang bang bang bang coming down the stairs and seeing my body run in and looked shock and said to the girl who was following him, babe I think you should go home, I call you later and let you know how it goss” with her only nodding and game my mom a quick kiss and left, then my mom said “ok I am going to call an ambulance “and that is what she did. <br />
<br />
And well it went how many people say it goes it was one of the most panful things in my life and it took hours the baby to get out, it did not really help that the only person who was with me was my mom in my body trying to say encourage things in my body voice while holding my hand what just made it so much more horrible, and one my little brother finely got out of me and was in my hands I could not help myself but cry feeling all mixed emotions and how beautiful I thought he was at that moment and how he has grown in me for the last 9 months, we&#39;ll be had sandy blond hair what none of my family had, but I don’t the my dad will realise anything, and I fell to sleep there and then. <br />
<br />
After a couple of days, the doctor let me go home it was about 7pm when I got back home, all my sisters and my little brother and mom was wating near the door to be properly introduced to their new little brother/ son? the girls just giggled at him and was shocked about how small he is, and Teddy wanted to hold him what we let him do, and it was very cute seeing him do so with his tongue sticking out trying to concentrate, to not drop him but after 10 minute she was back in my arms and I said his name is “Juan” with everyone liking it except mom who looked shocked, most likely thinking we would of swapped back or she would get a say in it before we named him. <br />
<br />
After all of that everyone went to bed and while I was heading to the bathroom after putting Juan in his crib for the first time, my mom came out and asked “so can we talk about the Chroniuac now” I was really tired and did not really want to get in to that tonight and said “tomorrow we will talk about it, I am way too tired to get in to that right now” and locked the berth room door, but on the way back I past my room hearing soft moans knowing my mom was rubbing one out with it being the last night she will be able to do such a thing. <br />
<br />
The next morning my dad said he will look after Juan and I could rest, but I  got up tuning on the computer what I have not touched in 9 months and opened the Chroniuac, put in the password in happy I did set a password seeing the worry what mom was putting my face  last night knowing if she could she would of tired to make it so she can keep my body, and looked at the stats knowing that I can change them now,  if I wanted to, but should I wait for her to show up knowing that my body makes her sleep in pass 12, but it is really not up to her, and any way I could just swap with someone else like I was thinking before, but then again I do feel connexion to Juan so maybe I should just stay as I am now?</p>
