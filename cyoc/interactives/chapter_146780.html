<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Animalia and Lyre weren&#39;t the only places where Animalians celebrated Easter. Mieni had its own Easter celebration as well. It wasn&#39;t quite as big or as decorated as the parties and celebrations in Lyre and Animalia, but it was something brought many of its members together. Though, not without its fair share of interesting moments, particularly when Kirana and Harold&#39;s hatchlings took interest in the hardboiled eggs. Their eyes focused on them as Kirana set down a small bowl while preparing some things to feed them and prepare things for some of the other members of the Horizon staff that worked with Harold with regards to sea and deep sea research.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; Kirana heard a soft grunt and turned just in time to catch the oldest of her hatchlings trying to wiggle out of his high-chair to reach for the bowl that the hard boiled eggs were in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, there,&quot; Kirana said to him and gently nuzzled the top of his head with her muzzle. He soon nuzzled her back. &quot;You&#39;ll get to eat, don&#39;t worry. But you aren&#39;t the only one eating... So you&#39;ll have to wait for mommy to finish getting things ready for the party.&quot;<br />
<br />
The hatchling then pointed to the bowl of eggs. His siblings soon joined in the call for the eggs. This made Kirana chuckle a bit as Harold came into the kitchen area. Like all snakes, they could stretch open their jaw to swallow larger prey if need be, and since as Animalians they were actually bigger than what an ordinary Sea Krait was and thus would make swallowing eggs whole would be easier, but Kirana had found and learned that Humans generally didn&#39;t look on eating that was as being something &quot;civilized,&quot; and since the coming party would include many members from Animalia and Horizon&#39;s more aquatic projects, it was agreed that a knife and fork would be better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still interested in the eggs?&quot; Harold gave a chuckle noting the pointing and the cries of &quot;guh&quot; or &quot;eck&quot; from his hatchlings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still curious about them,&quot; Kirana nodded, &quot;thankfully... this is the last set to prepare. Once they&#39;re done, we can get going and meet up with the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold nodded and moved up to check with each hatchling&#39;s chair. He won enough attention to get them to shake his finger for a moment. Though, that attention was soon lost as Kirana began cracking the shells to resume slicing up the eggs to serve. From there, Harold soon found himself trying to compete with their curiosity for their attention. He ultimately managed with some games and offering small bits of sliced egg, though that only just kept them trying to wriggle free.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The area that was set up for luaus and things like that were generally part what was normally allocated for tourists, but that tourist season wouldn&#39;t really be ready until late May at the earliest. In this the area was open for all to sit and enjoy a nice Easter Feast. It included many of Mieni&#39;s residents as they moved about to enjoy some of the food that various members brought with them, and with the area open, it gave everyone a nice look out over the open lagoon in the center of the atoll. It made for a pretty setting, and helped make much of the Easter Celebration on Mieni helpful for some of the newer members.<br />
<br />
For Cousteau and Bubblehead, this was also a big thing. Many of the others already had some familiarity with Easter as a holiday. Susan and Tzan were present with their mates Brazen and Chipper, though much of their focus was on the fish that was part of the Easter meal that was part of the party. Tzan had seemed rather calm with Cousteau, though that was probably due to him not being as energetic and perky as Susan was, though Cousteau got the sense that Tzan was indeed good friends with Susan. They did okay with Bubblehead, though there was also some sign that they didn&#39;t want to say anything offensive.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay if you find me... weird,&quot; Bubblehead said to Susan after a moment, &quot;many of my adaptations are specifically designed for the deep ocean and that can lead to evolutionary traits that are very different most other ocean creatures.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you are different,&quot; Susan answered while glancing to Tzan and then up the beach to see Harold pushing a stroller with his and Kirana&#39;s hatchlings in it. Kirana was slithering forward beside him with a large plate of what looked like sliced hard boiled eggs, and a few of Horizon&#39;s Human staff was following along behind them. After that moment, Susan turned back to Bubblehead, &quot;but, you don&#39;t seem to be a bad guy and I didn&#39;t want to say anything that hurt your feelings or anything like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m saying it&#39;s okay for you to be you,&quot; Bubblehead assured her, &quot;I&#39;m sure that as more meet me and get to know me better, some of the unease over my adaptations will become less of an issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very hopeful,&quot; said Brazen with an approving smile and even Tzan gave a gratified sigh at that.<br />
<br />
Bubblehead gave a small smile and nodded, as did Cousteau. Things were about to progress further when the rest of the group arrived with a warm announcement to all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, everyone, and Happy Easter,&quot; Harold spoke as his family arrived.<br />
<br />
Cousteau and Bubblehead both turned to see their coworker with regard to Project Abyssal and gave a happy nod. Kirana had had some of the same responses to Bubblehead that many had when they first met the uplifted deep sea fish, but in working with Harold, she was often present to meet and work with Bubblehead on some of the projects. In the course of those meetings and working together, Kirana had proven to be able to work past those sorts of uneasiness that many had around Bubblehead. In that, she was very much the role model for what Bubblehead hoped for in how people would get used to him with time.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the same to you,&quot; Cousteau said to them as they approached, &quot;though are all holidays group celebrations?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just about any holiday seems reason enough to get together,&quot; Kirana commented, &quot;though I suppose you could spend it alone if you want... Though it would mean you wouldn&#39;t get to share in all the good...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;GGGGG!&quot; came the voice of one of the hatchlings from the stroller, making Harold and Kirana both chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is a season for friends and family to come together and share eggs,&quot; Harold chuckle and then look to Cousteau, &quot;and to be together with friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am curious as how eggs are a part of this celebration,&quot; Bubblehead commented as he looked to Harold, &quot;You say this holiday is a religious one celebrating the death and resurrection of your &quot;lord and savior,&quot; but I&#39;ve found no story that makes any mention of eggs... or rabbits for that matter. I&#39;ve seen mentions of fish, but not rabbits or eggs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I&#39;ve never been fully sure on that, either,&quot; Harold admitted, &quot;but its a good tradition. Not to mention that hard boiled eggs can be good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially as far as your little ones are concerned,&quot; Teela commented as she came forward to see Kirana finally offering a few slices of egg to her hatchlings.<br />
<br />
That earned a few laughs.</p>
