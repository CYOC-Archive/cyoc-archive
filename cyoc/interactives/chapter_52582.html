<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Hopefully this gets the story rolling again)<br />
<br />
Bobbi sat quietly as the pride continued to discuss what to do about the funeral for Fox and Elise. She knew that not every member of the pride had seen them go after Kurse directly... even if Kurse was only a shadow of the witches that had cursed Glendale, and could only be directly engaged by those who had gone with Amy and Paul into the curse world. And the only member of the pride to have done that was Trevor, and Bobbi sensed that Fox and Elise had done what they did to protect him, as Bobbi was now sure that ANY member of the pride, even those that weren't officers and weren't with them would have done.<br />
<br />
But the battle in the &quot;real world&quot; against Kurse's minions had been tight and chaotic. Gary tried to keep order... but it quickly dissolved into a fight that no one in the pride could keep full track of... and lioness Megan, along with Gabriel and Mal'akh had been driven toward the beach away from the raised area where Fox and Elise had gone to challenge Kurse. She hadn't likely seen what had happened to their two pride sisters.<br />
<br />
Bobbi, herself, had even missed exactly how Kurse had killed Fox and Elise, but both Bobbi and Sasha had been there when Moja, Mbili, Tatuli, Nneli, Tano, Sita, Saba, and Nane teleported, practically onto the soulless husks of their mothers. The two of them quickly moved the cubs away to prevent a scene and sent them to help Mary, Ulysses, and Sarah before being evacuated to the Pack's manor. When they returned to where Fox and Elise's bodies had been, the bodies were both gone... and that is what lioness Megan was likely referring to now, and no one in the Pride likely knew how or why their bodies vanished or where they went.<br />
<br />
But then, the fight against Kurse was a fight against an evil using chaotic magic... and chaos was not something that could be explained logically or rationally.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is Alice, Abbey, and Samantha's world?&quot; a young female pup, the color of the gemstone Carnelian, asked as she and her twin explored the manor... or at least what the manor from inside the mirrorverse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Cassandra,&quot; Betty nodded.<br />
<br />
Cassandra and her twin, Lilly, were both intrigued by the mirrorverse when Abbey brought them back to the manor, and while the other twins left to find their room and Abbey went to reunite with Alice, had begged to be allowed to explore the mirrorverse. Abbey didn't see a major problem with it, but told them they needed someone to watch them and gave them the explicit warning not to eat the reflection of anything.<br />
<br />
Watching them were the pack's only solid white wolves, Lawrence and Betty. Amy couldn't really be counted as a &quot;white wolf&quot; because of her red brush-like markings.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's so amazing,&quot; Cassandra spoke, &quot;some of the rooms look like the laws of Geometry have been broken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But no one can hear us here,&quot; Lilly countered, &quot;and all the people we see are only reflections. It's like they're ghosts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanted to explore it too,&quot; Cassandra said back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to see if the mirrorverse version of the manor was the same as the real world version of the manor,&quot; Lilly retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on now, don't fight,&quot; Lawrence said calmly from behind them.<br />
<br />
The two reddish-orange/brown twins acknowledged the adult male with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can go visit your mates any time,&quot; Betty told her nephew, &quot;You know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until Abbey comes back to get us,&quot; Lawrence reminded her, &quot;and besides, part of me is still nervous on how they'll react. Ashley and Megan were part of the rescue teams... and I helped attack them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You attacked me,&quot; Betty reminded him, &quot;and after you split me into Bethy and Tebby, we went after Yamato, before the gargoyles arrived... and as I told you before, it wasn't your fault. It was KURSE'S fault, and we all know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Lawrence nodded weakly, &quot;I'm just worried that they won't forgive me... part of me is also curious as to what drove the witches evil to begin with. I mean they all started innocent... and ended up mad and evil and made us do evil things to each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not ask questions you may not like the answers to,&quot; came a new voice.<br />
<br />
All of them turned to see a blond wolf pup, although there was a slight metallic tinge to her fur and her eyes were a different shade of blue from Alice, Abbey, and Samantha's in the mirrorverse. Her dress was also black and red with various runes sewn into it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glass?&quot; Lilly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Marie,&quot; Marie corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Betty asked, &quot;I thought you went home with your mother? The yacht had left the island before we did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did, but this is my world, just as it is Alice, Abbey, and Samantha's,&quot; Marie spoke, &quot;and I came to talk with Samantha, and beg her forgiveness for the things we did as &quot;Glass&quot; under Other Mother's spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha's asleep,&quot; Cassandra spoke, &quot;Abbey said not to go into the pup's room because of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie nodded, &quot;Yes, so while I've been waiting for her to wake up, I've been trying to help. I hope I am not interfering.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your dress is pretty,&quot; Cassandra spoke, &quot;what are those stick thingies?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie looked down at her red and black dress and sighed, &quot;they are runes. An old Germanic alphabet used before they began using the Latin alphabet. For those that know magic they can still hold great power if used correctly. The runes on my dress largely represent the words &quot;wolf, glass, white, and witch&quot;, which signifies what I am now that Kurse is gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're a glass wolf that is a white witch?&quot; Lawrence asked, &quot;sounds like a tongue twister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It can be,&quot; Marie nodded, &quot;but getting back to what I said when I arrived. Don't ask questions you may not like the answers to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know why Kurse turned evil?&quot; Lawrence asked, &quot;other then being insane?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what drove her insane, yes,&quot; Marie answered, &quot;and trust me, it is not a happy story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I have to know,&quot; Lawrence spoke, looking very curious while Betty, Cassandra, and Lilly nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Marie sighed, &quot;but the tale is not for the faint of heart, and you obviously know the ending in your priestess, Amy, killing Kurse and the lion-boy Trevor killing the familiar...&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Trevor's family and Serenity had no problems as they finished their ice cream and left the shop. Serenity sighed with relief that they weren't thrown out... or at least that she wasn't. Serenity could see the pain in Trevor's eyes at losing the friends he had in the previous time-line before Kurse's death, with the obvious exceptions of Mary and Judas, and even Jensen to a certain extent... although in the wolf's case there like was some major changes.<br />
<br />
Jensen and Kaylee were now at least ten years older then they had been in the previous time-line, likely reality making it possible for them to claim that their pups truly were THEIR pups and not some creation of the game. And Trevor, only eight years old, only knew them as the parents of Bart, Jenny, Marcy, Kevin, Alice, Abbey, and Samantha, who according to Jacob and Marie were friends with the Pride's cubs.<br />
<br />
Serenity knew this would be tough for Trevor, and probably for Mary and many members of the Pack who had been made younger as realty sought to heal over what had been unleashed over the past week. But, as they say &quot;time heals all wounds&quot;, and Serenity hoped that now that the shadow of the curse was finally beginning to fade, that things would be given time to fix themselves.</p>
