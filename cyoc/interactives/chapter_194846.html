<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This monstrous young woman had a titanic pink purse to match, lying on the ground in just the right way that made Mike think he could climb right up. Given that this chick was truly gorgeous and seemed fascinating too, he decided he&#39;d be crazy not to hang around her for a while and see what happens. He wasn&#39;t sure whether she&#39;d notice him at this size, but regardless, she seemed pretty engrossed in her book.<br />
<br />
He sidled up to her handbag and noticed it was several times larger than he was. Deciding this was no time to be intimidated, Mike decided to start climbing and see what he could grab onto. Surprisingly enough, the purse seemed to have a soft leather surface that looked shiny and slippery, but proved fairly easy for him to navigate. The slope increased as he climbed, but as the leather sagged slightly to meet his feet, he found no real problems. A couple jumps and grabs, and soon enough he was on top of the bag. He saw the zipper was open, so at least he knew he wouldn&#39;t be blind while he was in there. He saw a packet of tissues, and he dropped down.<br />
<br />
Mike figured the first thing to do in this giant girl&#39;s handbag was to snuggle in tight. If she went grabbing for something, there was nothing he could do to guarantee her huge fingers wouldn&#39;t discover him, but he could still hide himself as deeply as possible to avoid detection through any errant glances. It was a strange feeling sliding under tubes of lipstick that were longer than he was tall, but it wasn&#39;t too hard to slide underneath the top layer in her purse.<br />
<br />
He noticed that his hiding place was up against a wallet. Since the train ride seemed to be going on for a while, Mike decided to open it up and look inside. It actually took a fair amount of effort to open the flaps, but with a quick heave and shove he could see her driver&#39;s license. Her name was Anna, she was 24, and he got his first clear look at her face. Even in a driver&#39;s license photo she looked amazing. He was thrilled he decided to hitch a ride with her.<br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t too much time to revel in his good decision, though, as it looked like he was back in motion. When the train reached its latest stop, Mike just assumed nothing would happen like at all the others before. This time, though, with seemingly no warning a shadow came over him, and he looked up to see Anna&#39;s giant right hand curl up in a fist around the straps of the bag. When she lifted him up, high into the air, the shock jostled him even deeper into her handbag, almost entirely blocking his field of vision of the outside world. Nonetheless, he could still feel yourself swaying back and forth, with sudden lurches every few moments when the purse brushed against his gorgeous giantess&#39;s waist. All in all, though, as transportation goes, it wasn&#39;t too bad.<br />
<br />
Mike figured that Anna must live fairly close to the train station, as she walked for about ten or fifteen minutes before stopping. He&#39;d already realized that the first time she stopped walking could very well be to go home, so the moment she stopped moving he peeked out to see her colossal hand descend once more into her purse to rifle around. He actually had been near her keys a few moments earlier, but he then had the foresight to sidle around to the other side of her purse. Sure enough, her hand came nowhere near him, and she took her keys out without any hint of his existence. He could hear her unlock the door and walk into a building. She checked her mail, went into an elevator, and then opened her apartment door.<br />
<br />
Mike was tempted to climb to the top of her belongings and peer out of her handbag to see what her giant apartment looked like. He decided to restrain himself though, in hopes of having a better opportunity in a few moments. This faith was rewarded when Anna dropped her bag, and Mike within, down on the floor in the entryway.  He heard her footsteps as she walked away, and he took the chance to scramble onto the top of the purse and see what&#39;s around.<br />
<br />
As he guessed, he was in Anna&#39;s apartment. It looked fairly small, at least for a giantess of Anna&#39;s size: there was a kitchen and a small living room that basically flowed into each other, and then it looked like there was a bedroom and bathroom off to the side. The bathroom door was shut, and the light underneath the door made it apparent that Anna had gone in there.<br />
<br />
This was clearly his best, and probably only, chance to explore Anna&#39;s apartment without fear of immediate detection. Still, she seemed to have dropped her purse off fairly close to her entryway. What if she was going out again soon?</p>
