<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I trotted happily over to the treadmills and stopped short when I saw the jocks had gotten the same idea. They were in the back and grinning and jeering at the fat chick. She was still running her heart out. That… might actually be dangerous with how much weight she had. <br />
<br />
Making my way to an empty treadmill nearby, I setup my usual program, got a water bottle ready, and started the machine.<br />
<br />
The jocks were within earshot of me and the taunts and jeers only got worse. I could see the fat girl glancing behind her occasionally, as though she could hear them. Or maybe it was a second sense, like she knew they were staring at her and mocking her.<br />
<br />
It was starting to piss me off, but I wanted to get my time in.<br />
<br />
Then the jocks got louder, making fat jokes that I was sure she could hear because she stumbled and started dialing down her run. I clenched my teeth. Who the fuck were they to discourage someone from coming to the gym and bettering themselves.? Yes, I agreed it wasn’t a pleasant sight, but she deserved respect just for putting herself out there.<br />
<br />
“Oink oink, piggy!” Terry, the brown haired one, sneered. “Someone must be dangling a Happy Meal in front of her to make her move that fast!”<br />
<br />
The fat girl turned to stare at them, her face beet red.<br />
<br />
“Juicy?” Will, the All-American blonde haired one, mocked. “More like ‘juicy that fat ass’, am I right Terry?!”<br />
<br />
The two jocks doubled over in laughter.<br />
<br />
Alright, that was it! I slowed to a stop and pulled out the book. Taking out the pencil, my grip a little too tight and almost making it snap. <br />
<br />
Then I paused, realizing I had no idea what her name was. Maybe I could get away with it if I kept her identity vague? So I wrote: ‘The person on the treadmill in front of me is an amazing runner, fit with a hot, lithe body.’ The writing glowed brightly. I looked up to watch as she began to change.<br />
<br />
As my eyes fell on her, she began to deflate like a balloon.<br />
<br />
Fat wobbled and shifted as it was sucked away. Her body began to tighten and firm up as her bingo wings became toned arms. Her ass remained a bit jiggly, growing nice and round, each step causing her asscheeks to roll against each other in a seductive way. Even my cock was getting hard looking at it, and I was gay!<br />
<br />
Then the rest of her fat vanished. I smiled as her body grew more toned, then frowned as her biceps began to pump and swell into small melons. Speaking of melons, her breasts were receding even as her pectorals began to press out, growing thick and veiny. The girl’s shoulders widened even as her hair shortened into a shoulder length, silky blonde style that didn’t look particularly feminine. <br />
<br />
With a grunt that was deeper than a woman should be able to make, the front of her now-tight yoga pants bulged heavily as a new growth swelled into existence. I blinked, realizing that she was now a he. The curves of his body became sharp and masculine. <br />
<br />
I glanced down at what I wrote, desperate to find out where I had gone wrong. When I looked up again, Yellow and black spotted fur had covered the newly minted man’s body. A long striped tail shot through a hole in his pants, which still said ‘JUICY’. As his face twisted and popped into a feline shape, I realized I was now staring at a twunky cheetah.<br />
<br />
Alex. That was his name. I shook my head as more memories filled it. The cheetah was another one of the anthros on campus. He’d been really fat, a metabolism issue, and had always been embarrassed by it. No wonder I’d altered him.<br />
<br />
The glare the athletic and bottom-heavy cheetah had been giving the jocks softened into a seductive smirk. Alex started jogging again, his massive, well-rounded bubblebutt bouncing, shooting the two muscular men glances. The jocks looked away, embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“Man, I can’t believe I thought that dude was a chick!” Will moaned.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, him and that grizzly. Is every anthro a fag?” Terry grimaced.<br />
<br />
“Let’s get the fuck out of here. I can smell his ass stink from here.” Will snorted as if to get the musk of the horny cheetah out of his nose.<br />
<br />
They turned to leave.<br />
<br />
I wasn’t going to let them. They were obnoxious assholes. I’d put up with them long enough, but they just wouldn’t leave people alone. As soon as they saw another target, they’d probably begin mocking them too. It was time they had a taste of their own medicine.<br />
<br />
Taking out the book, I started writing. ‘Terry and Will can’t leave yet, they left their keys by Ryan’s weight-lifting bench.’<br />
<br />
Will paused, patting his shorts. A look of panic flew across his face as he realized his keys were missing. Terry frowned, then checked his own pockets and looked horrified to discover his own keys were gone too.<br />
<br />
“Dude, where the fuck could I have left them?” Will looked around frantically.<br />
<br />
“Don’t know,” Terry searched around the treadmill. “Shit! We were weightlifting by that grizzly.”<br />
<br />
“He’s going to hit on us if we go back.”<br />
<br />
“Fucking fags,” Terry rolled his eyes. “Let’s just grab them and go. Don’t stop to talk to him.”<br />
<br />
The two jocks made a beeline for the grizzly’s bench. Ryan was still pumping iron, though it only looked to be about 2K pounds this time, something more manageable for him. As soon as the jocks got into his line of sight, the big bear smiled and adjusted himself.<br />
<br />
I watched as the jocks were busy trying to avoid the small talk, which would be hard, since… ‘Ryan the powerlifting grizzly bear is quite persuasive and capable of talking even the most homophobic straight guys into becoming horny gay bottoms’. The text glowed.<br />
<br />
Ryan opened his maw and started talking, his voice deep and rumbly but strangely melodic and sensual. My cock went rigid just hearing it, and from the tents the two young jocks were now sporting, they had been affected the same way. Their defensive postures relaxed and their tight faces turned into quiet, almost bashful smiles. <br />
<br />
I had to catch myself from walking over to Ryan and letting the big bear plow my ass.<br />
<br />
Whoa, maybe I shouldn’t have done that! Mroo! Unseen consequences of messing with reality sucked! I shook my heavy head and tried my hardest to ignore my throbbing cock that jumped every time I heard Ryan’s voice.<br />
<br />
I took deep breaths, precum staining my workout shorts in a damp wet stain. Then I wrote down my intended punishments for Terry and Will. ‘Terrance is a fat, dorky anthro boar and William is a fat, nerdy anthro donkey. Both of them have bad flatulence and poor social skills. Until today, neither of them have ever stepped a foot into a gym in their lives. Then they joined the anthro community club here on campus. Ryan has stepped up to make them into more respectable anthros and not the embarrassments they currently are. He knows how to handle them.’<br />
<br />
The words glowed blindingly bright before slowly fading. I blinked, rubbing my eyes as I tried to clear the sunspots from my vision. Mroo! That was bright!<br />
<br />
<br />
By the time my vision had cleared enough to see across the room, the two jocks were already transforming. Their forms began to disappear, their muscles evaporating. Already, I could see their tight bodies puff and swell as fat began to flow in, replacing the muscle as it dwindled away. Then their transformations diverged.<br />
<br />
Terrance’s face began to shift, his forehead jutting over his eyes, the brows low hanging. His jaw creaked and popped, two tusks poking through his distended bottom lip. The former jock’s nose upturned, growing wet and snuffling as it became a piggish snout. The rest of his head began to crack as it grew more porcine. <br />
<br />
Fat piled on to him, saggy sacks of flab that stretched his increasingly hairy body to its limits. His belly ballooned, holding its shape for but a moment before sagging heavily halfway to his knees. Terrance’s tits swelled and enlarged from the fat, then his skin went slack, as though giving up supporting their weight and his new breasts drooped onto his stomach. His ass was wide and saggy, a thin tail curling from his crack.<br />
<br />
The body hair that was sprouting all over the former jocks shaved smooth skin quickly turned into bristly brown fur. It grew matted as his body became greasy and sweaty. The fur was pulled tight around his saggy chest and gut, stretch marks zig-zagging in bright red lines underneath the bristles. <br />
<br />
Terrance bristly tail lifted and a loud, wet fart echoed in the room. The boar snorted, his nostrils snuffling his stench and a satisfied smirk appeared on his wobbly muzzle. His tusk jutted further from his jaw,the pearly white color they had quickly fading as dark brown stains appeared.<br />
<br />
What remained of his expensive hairdo grew longer, extending down his wide, flabby back in a coarse mohawk that ended at his crack.<br />
<br />
His gym shorts pulled up over his vast gut and his t-shirt tucked itself into it. Food stains spattered and dried on his new shirt, his jowls and doublechin also matting with sauce from an old meal the boar had never bothered to clean off. Terrance adjusted a thick pair of glasses that appeared on his snout as his ears flopped over themselves. He let out a happy oink as Ryan continued speaking to him, fondling the large bulge in his shorts.<br />
<br />
I let him have that, at least, though the boar’s grotesque appearance would mean that until Ryan fixed him up, the boar would never have a chance to use it. As Terrance settled into his new life of a fat, slobby dork, my eyes shifted over to William.<br />
<br />
William’s changes were a little less gross, but no less humiliating. <br />
<br />
The former jock’s physique vanished. His pecs slipped from firm to loose and flabby, his nipples expanding as fat pushed them out. William’s midsection began to round into a globe, and then into a muffin top, his rear puffing with flab.<br />
<br />
William let out a quiet bray as his head shifted, growing long and equine. His ears rose to the top of his head and then seemed to be tugged and pulled higher and higher, like a rabbit’s ears. His hair shifted into a black, short, spiky mohawk, similar to his new boar friend’s.<br />
<br />
The rest of his body grew a coat of coarse, almost wooly slat fur. He scratched his gut with fingernails that were growing blunt and dark. As if waiting for his touch, the small dome began to grow larger. It looked remarkably like a beer gut, though the thing continued to swell into a beach ball. It was nearly spherical, held tight only by whatever muscles remained on the new donkey.<br />
<br />
His clothes shifted into garb rather similar to Terrance’s-nerdy and tucked in. The donkey started farting too, though his were loud and rapid fire. I was glad I wasn’t near them because it must have smelt rank and disgusting.<br />
<br />
Through it all, Ryan remained unperturbed, and I marveled at the massive grizzly’s patience.<br />
<br />
William’s body was goofy and disproportionate, his gut huge and round while his limbs were thin and gangly. The potbellied donkey took a deep gulp of air from his inhaler. Ryan seemed to be encouraging him to lift the bare metal bar and the equine was struggling. Whatever he was saying worked, because the donkey feebly managed to do two reps before letting go of the bar.<br />
<br />
Then I noticed his big, floppy donkey dick was not quite so floppy. It stuck out from under his absurd gut at a 45-degree angle. Ryan was gently rubbing it while he spoke into William’s long, twitching ears. The donkey let out an excited bray and managed another few lifts. <br />
<br />
I smirked. Ryan was going to have his hands full with the two of them.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” Josh’s voice made me blink and turn my head.<br />
<br />
“What?” I asked.<br />
<br />
The stallion had walked over to me-for how long, I had no clue-and was crossing his arms angrily.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on with you today?” Josh said irritably. “We’re supposed to be working out, not watching Ryan turn two fat anthros into his butt puppets. Get your ass on that treadmill!”<br />
<br />
I bit my lip. “Josh, I have an appointment.”<br />
<br />
“When?” Josh flipped his mane out of his face. <br />
<br />
“A half hour ago. My tutor.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, you have a tutor? I though you said your grades were barely passing.” Josh asked.<br />
<br />
“They are. Hence, tutor,” I explained.<br />
<br />
“Why didn’t you say anything?”<br />
<br />
“I forgot! Mrroo, my stupid bull-head messed things up again!”<br />
<br />
Josh reached out a hoofletted hand and patted my head. “It’s a handsome head.”<br />
<br />
“Kevin?” A querelous voice spoke from the entrance to the gym.<br />
<br />
I turned and saw Ethan standing in the doorway, looking rather annoyed. The slim short man adjusted his glasses and stalked forward. The look on his face was one of pure annoyance. I took a step back.<br />
<br />
“Who’s that?” Josh asked, crossing his arms, veins visibly under his thick hide. “Why’s that dork talking to you like that?”<br />
<br />
“This *dork*,” Ethan snarled at Josh, “Is going to save your boyfriend from getting kicked out of college for failing grades.”<br />
<br />
Ethan grabbed one of my horns and tugged me off towards the exit. I could have resisted, of course, and was embarrassed at being manhandled, but I didn’t want to hurt the little (friend) tutor. Josh snorted in annoyance but didn’t make a move to stop the human.<br />
<br />
“Josh?” I lowed as I was dragged away.<br />
<br />
Josh shook his head. “He’s right, hoss. Gotta study if ya wanna stay in school. Come back to the dorm room when y’all are done.”<br />
<br />
Ethan determinedly dragged me out the doors. I stopped trying to fight him and he let go of my horn. The nondescript young man kept walking, not glancing back to see if I was following him. We walked to the library.<br />
<br />
“Hurry up.” Ethan said shortly, holding the door open for me. “I need to get to class in two hours.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, Ethan,” I lowed.<br />
<br />
“Just..hurry up and get inside,” Ethan rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
I was disappointing him again. <br />
<br />
My ears drooped. Why had I forgotten our appointment? I was always messing things up like this. Mroo! I’m such a bull-head! <br />
<br />
Hanging my massive horned head, I clopped inside.</p>
