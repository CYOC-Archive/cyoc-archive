<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Now as for Frieda’s friends; “Frances asking; “how do you feel about them?”<br />
“Tense,” Benton answers; “but not with them per say. More like with Eric’s parents; specifically his father.”<br />
“How so?”<br />
“Last Friday,” Benton sighed; “I made the unfortunate mistake of attacking Eric as he got out of this beat up station wagon to escort my daughter out as she got home. This was before I found out I was bi-polar. Hell even Tachibana saw the aftermath and she was pissed. If it wasn’t for Mike Lawson; I might have killed the kid.”<br />
<br />
Frances eyes go wide with saucers; she knew last Saturday there was an issue between William and Benton; but Nate telling her not to poke that bear until William was ready to talk, she hasn’t been over to the Anderson household since.<br />
“What did Mike Lawson do to stop you from possibly killing Eric?”<br />
“Turned into a werewolf,” Benton answering; “and made it clear I would have to go through him to get to Eric. Long story short Spencer&#39;s grandfather knows how to fight.” Benton sighs; “it wasn’t long after that, after recovering from the stun gun curtesy of Sheriff Cooper that I was high tailing it to the hospital. My wife got into a car accident while on her way to pick up Frieda. My daughter chose to ride in the ambulance that took Eric Anderson to the emergency room.”<br />
“What happened next;” Frances listening raptly.<br />
“Upon entering the E.R demanding to know what happened to Amanda,” Benton answering; “I met William Anderson, he was at the hospital waiting news of his son and he deck me.”<br />
“I take it that was the first time someone hit you,” Frances doing her best not to laugh.<br />
“No,” Benton states; “I’ve been hit before. But not from a father angered over what I did to their son.”<br />
“You felt you deserved it,” Frances asks.<br />
“A part of me did,” Benton answers; “another part of me was distracted over worry about my wife.”<br />
“So how did your wife get into a car accident?”<br />
“She passed out behind the wheel,” Benton answers; “First everyone thought it was from alcohol. But after running tests to determine her blood alcohol was zero; it was later found that she was running a fever. More tests determined that Amanda had a hook worm infection from the tainted civet coffee she was drinking for the past month.”<br />
“That must have been stressful,” Frances looking surprised.<br />
“Dam straight,” Benton answering; “I had some of that coffee early in the day. Fortunately my one cup wasn’t enough to make me ill. Apart from wanting to throw up after finding out what the doctors said was in the coffee other than the beans.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s go back to my previous question,” Frances asks; “how do you feel about Frieda’s friends?”<br />
Benton thinks for a minute; “if you asked me this question last week, I would have said my daughter doesn’t associate with those below her station and snarled for dramatic effect. But now; it’s clear that Eric and Spencer have made her truly happy for the first time in a long while. I guess they are fine,” Benton sighing; “but that doesn’t mean I can’t stop doing what I can to keep an eye on her.”<br />
“Never said you shouldn’t,” Frances responds; “but are you worried that Eric and Spencer will harm your daughter?”<br />
“I was at first,” Benton answering; “after the incident with Julie Stovall last week, I thought Eric was some no good kid that was pure trouble.”<br />
“But now?”<br />
“Well after yesterday,” Benton answering; “Eric showed me how wrong I was. The kid was not only considerate but happens to be a Brainiac. He knows more about math then I or Amanda knew.”<br />
“And Spencer Lawson?”<br />
Benton chuckles; “If I hadn’t seen it for myself, I would never have believed her in being able to knock down and disable a were twice her size. Last night a member of my pride decided to ignore my daughters warning on forcing themselves on anther who wasn’t willing. After hearing the altercation, I see Spencer holding down an older were-panthress who was clearly in pain.”<br />
“What did you do after that?”<br />
“I found out through witnesses to the altercation that the older were started the mess by trying to force herself on Eric Anderson,” Benton responds; “while I did thought about rending the women limb from limb, seeing her in pain from a fifteen year old girl was oddly satisfying. So I expelled her and had her black balled from any future social functions.”<br />
“That’s rather benevolent coming from you,” Frances jotting down more notes; “anything else you’d like to elaborate?”<br />
“Only that the three were up half the night worrying me to the bone,” Benton answers; “it being a school night and all that. I didn’t want them to spend the entire night rutting.”<br />
<br />
Frances laughs at that last comment as she finishes writing down more in her note pad.<br />
“On more question,” Frances states; “How do you feel about Julie Stovall’s assault trial?”<br />
“You haven’t heard then,” Benton’s anger rising; “the judge threw out the charges on a technicality!”<br />
”How so,” Frances noting Benton’s anger.<br />
“Sixth amendment rights violations,” Benton looking pissed; “plus both the sheriff and the prosecutor made several procedural errors when charging the minnow.”<br />
“So she is a free person right now” Frances looking surprised.<br />
“In the eyes of the court,” Benton grumbling; “my only solace is the statue 1A charges against Julie. The judge deferred those to the Elder council.”<br />
“So what do you intend to do?”<br />
“I intend to do what I can to protect my daughter,” Benton growling; “If Julie’s parents have any sense, they’ll let the council do what is needed to punish their daughter. But if they try any bullshit in sending her away, then they don’t know how long my reach can be.”<br />
“What if Julie decides to run away,” Frances asks; “or attempts to attack Eric or Spencer.”<br />
“If Julie tries to run away” Benton smirks; “it will be stupid mistake on her part, if she tries to attack Eric or Spencer? Let’s just say, it would be a fatal mistake. I highly doubt a fourteen year old wer-mer could hold their own against a were-panther or a hybrid.”<br />
&quot;How would you compare Frieda to Julie?&quot;<br />
&quot;From what I have seen,&quot; Benton answering; &quot;Julie acts like a spoiled princess. Lashing out and throwing temper tantrums when she doesn&#39;t get her way. While I feel no pity for her; Julie&#39;s parents must be at their wits end in dealing with their troublesome child.&quot; Benton looking at Frances; &quot;my daughter is the exact opposite. While Frieda does push my buttons and goes out of her way at times to get a rise out of me when we argue; I&#39;m starting to feel its her way of letting me know she is disappointed in me not listening to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances just nods as she finishes writing down notes and looks at Benton.<br />
“I think I have enough for now. While there is still more to discuss,” Frances getting up to escort Benton out; “I can now at least begin to understand what you need to remain calm.”<br />
“More drugs,” Benton asking?<br />
“No,” Frances answers; “for now stay on the medication Doctor Robinson has prescribed for you.” Reaching the waiting area France looks at her receptionist, “Rudy, when can you pencil Mr. Knight here for another appointment?”<br />
“Give me a minute here,” Rudy flipping through the appointment book; “earliest would be Friday of next week at the end of the day.”<br />
“Any other dates,” Benton asking.<br />
“Nothing until after boxing day,” Rudy answers.<br />
“The Friday of next week it is,” Frances answers. Seeing her waiting area is empty save for one person; Frances demeanor changes from being professional to outright hostile.<br />
“What the hell are you doing here Father!”</p>
