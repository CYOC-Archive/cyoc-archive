<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex woke with a sudden shooting pain passing through his whole body. He tried to curl on his side, instead rolling out of bed and hitting the wooden floor with a solid thud. He wanted to scream, but his throat clenched shut as he rolled onto his stomach, trying to push himself up. He could feel his muscles burning as they seemed to swell, he could see his arms thickening, the hair on his forearms growing denser until they were covered in red-brown fur. He felt his bones cracking, his hands growing larger as his nails pushed out into claws that dug into the inn room&#39;s wooden floor. And from the corner of his eyes he could just make out his legs, sprouting the same covering of fur, the front of his feet twisting into claw tipped paws.<br />
<br />
As soon as it came on him it passed. Fur returned to lightly tanned skin, bulging muscles seemed to contract back on themselves, as his claws dulled and became simple nails once more. He was left gasping on the floor, catching his breath as the pain became a distant memory. Finally he managed to push himself up to a seated position, leaning back against the bed, his skin slicked with sweat as he felt suddenly cold without that heat flooding through him.<br />
<br />
Alex ran his hands over his front, the frowned. Whatever had come over him, it hadn&#39;t completely reversed, what was only slight muscle definition yesterday was far more noticeable today. He traced fingers over the curve of his pectorals and down to the four pack is abdomen now sported. Not to mention the few hairs that had been across his torso had multiplied to a slight dusting in the middle of his chest, even his arm and leg hair seemed just a little thicker.<br />
<br />
Alex couldn&#39;t deny that wolf in the woods had probably done something to him, strangely he was less worried for himself and more over what Flint would think. Once his muscles no longer felt weak and watery he pushed himself up and got dressed. Sunlight was filtering in through the window, and breakfast which was cold and probably left a few hours ago sat waiting for him on the table. Luckily, it was still good, feeling ravenous, he really didn&#39;t care if it was only lukewarm at best.<br />
<br />
After feeding himself, he wasted no time getting downstairs. Although he was worried about Flint finding out that he may be infected with some curse, the other man was also his best source of information. It was Brock who greeted him as he came into the common room though, empty save for the two of them. He was working on some ledger, scribbling on it with a quill pen. He grinned as he spotted Alex. &quot;Good morning!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning.&quot; Alex replied, looking around the common room which only drew a laugh from Brock.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s out back cleaning the stables. Might not be fit for company but if you&#39;re looking for him that&#39;s where he is.&quot; The older man was definitely amused by this, his grin widening as Alex blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thanks.&quot; Alex dipped his head then headed to the back door, slipping into the stable yard. Two horses wandered back there, nibbling at grass and enjoying wandering about as Flint was hard at work cleaning their stables. He must have been at it, as he was currently laying down fresh straw with a pitch fork. Alex just paused to enjoy the sight for a bit, Flint was stripped to the waist, showing off strong, toned muscles that glistened with sweat, his hair both on his head and body an even deeper black and slicked against his skin with the same sweat. And although the stable had a distinctly pungent aroma all its own, even that wasn&#39;t enough to completely mask the wafting scent that Alex knew was Flint. It was close though, the finest hair of that intoxicating smell reaching his nose.<br />
<br />
Flint spotted him almost immediately and smiled, but didn&#39;t pause in his work. &quot;Sorry, chores still need doing.&quot; He said, tossing another forkful of hay into one of the stalls. &quot;I&#39;ll be done soon if you want to keep me company.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex looked around, and found a barrel to sit on where he could watch Flint. &quot;No worries, I&#39;d help if I knew how.&quot; Instead he watched Flint&#39;s muscles at work, almost forgetting his earlier problems. &quot;Hey, mind if I ask you something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Flint said, taking a moment to grab a water skin to pour some liquid down his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I first got here I arrived in the woods. I saw, well, wolves. And I think I saw one of them..&quot; Alex bit his lip, then shook his head as Flint looked over to him. &quot;What I mean to ask is, are there werewolves around here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex wasn&#39;t surprised when Flint nodded. &quot;Yeah. There&#39;s a pack of them that claim part of the woods. The town has a deal with them. They leave the villagers and the surrounding farms alone, and the townsfolk stay out of their part of the woods, except for the road passing through.&quot; Flint must have taken the look of worry on Alex&#39;s face to mean something else. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about them. We haven&#39;t had a problem with them since my grandfather&#39;s time. I heard the king&#39;s not fond of them being there, but we&#39;re far enough from the capital that it&#39;s probably more bother to interfere than it&#39;s worth. You think you saw some?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A big black furred one.&quot; Alex said with a nod, touching the spot on his shoulder where he swore he had been bitten, even though no mark remained. &quot;Can they spread it? Being a werewolf I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flint frowned, but nodded, picking up his pitchfork once more to spread the last of the straw. &quot;Of course. It&#39;s a magical.. I dunno, curse, blessing, I guess it depends who you ask. Why? You want to become one?&quot; Flint&#39;s tone was light and joking.<br />
<br />
Alex made a noncommittal sound. &quot;Just wondering.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flint nodded as he hung up his tool and pushed the wheelbarrow off to the side. Walking over to a rain barrel, he scooped out some water with a ladle and poured it over himself, washing off some of the dirt and grime from the chore. &quot;Uhg, I need a bath. Want to come along?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex blinked and blushed at the offer. &quot;Come along to a bath?&quot;<br />
<br />
Flint laughed softly. &quot;Yeah, the town bathhouse, it&#39;s just across the square. I know you haven&#39;t had a bath since you&#39;ve been here, and I definitely need one now. Why? Do you not have those back where you come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Bathing is kind of a private thing back home. Usually anyway.&quot; Alex hopped off the barrel, and rubbed his chin, frowning at the stubble under his fingers. Maybe he should ask to borrow a razor too, he thought, then nodded. &quot;Sure, I guess I should learn how it&#39;s done here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flint tugged his shirt back on with a satisfied nod. He didn&#39;t go back into the inn, instead just opening a gate in the stable yard fence and motioning Alex to go through ahead of him. Alex stuck close to Flint s they crossed the town square, which was somewhat quiet at the moment, only a few people drifting though, a couple stall merchants calling out half heartedly. Obviously they knew Flint, as most just waved to him instead of trying to sell him anything. He lead Alex to a large wood and stone building, and stepping inside went right up to a bored looking young man behind a counter.<br />
<br />
The place had a slightly damp smell, and warm steam wafted from beyond a few sets of beaded curtains. He was too busy trying to see through those to pay attention to the conversation between Flint and the attendant, though he notice a few copper coins exchanged for towels and what looked like soap. &quot;C&#39;mon.&quot; Flint said, motioning for Alex to follow as he slipped past one of the sets of beads.<br />
<br />
The room beyond was dominated by a stone pool filled with water that let off a light steam. It was being constantly filled from a few spouts at one end. It was maybe big enough for five or six people to comfortably share, though it was empty at the moment. &quot;I paid extra for some privacy.&quot; He said as he set the towels and soap down at the edge of the pool and began to strip.<br />
<br />
Alex froze. Flint had already seen him naked, how was he going to explain being more muscular and hairy than he had been yesterday? But Flint was already naked and slipping into the water. He did have a nice rear, Alex thought. Well, there was no backing out now, maybe he could play it off somehow. He got out of his loaned clothes, folding them and setting them aside as he followed Flint into the bathing pool. Flint was watching him, a smile playing over his lips. If he did notice a difference, he didn&#39;t say anything about it. Instead he hummed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Alex asked as he sunk into the wonderfully warm water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing, just enjoying the view.&quot; He grabbed one of the soap bars and began to lather up, so Alex followed suit. &quot;Did you give any more thought to going home?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex winced. If he was cursed could he even go home? Werewolves weren&#39;t a thing back on Earth, was he even a werewolf? He bit his lip and shook his head. &quot;I, uh, I don&#39;t know.&quot; Flint motioned for Alex to turn around, which after a confused glance he did, only to feel Flint running the soap over his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it means anything, I&#39;d be happy to have you stay. I know we just met, but I feel like...&quot; Flint set down the soap, and Alex turned around to look at him, as two strong arms wrapped around him. &quot;I feel like you&#39;re supposed to be here. I&#39;ll still go with you to the capital if you want to find a wizard, but I&#39;d be happy if you didn&#39;t too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex didn&#39;t know how to respond other than to kiss Flint. He pressed up against him, pushing Flint&#39;s back up against the edge of the pool as he straddled his lap, their cocks trapped between them. Flint&#39;s wasn&#39;t all that much longer than Alex&#39;s, but like the man it was impressively thick. Alex wanted nothing more than to feel it inside of him, and Flint didn&#39;t put up an argument as Alex lifted himself up and then guided himself down onto his shaft.<br />
<br />
It felt right, Alex noticed. Not painful, or uncomfortable. Instead it seemed to strike a spot inside of him that sent a shiver up his spine. He started to slide up and down the shaft, his lips still locked to Flint&#39;s as he felt a hand wrap around his own cock, stroking in time to his movements. Days of being around Flint without release had left him more than a little desperate, and he knew he wasn&#39;t going to last long.<br />
<br />
Still, Alex tried to hold on as long as possible, running his hands up and down Flint&#39;s body, squeezing his chest and arms, simply feeling every part of him as he felt his climax building. Alex came with a deep moan, which was soon followed by Flint pressing his face into Alex&#39;s shoulder as he filled him with his cum. <br />
<br />
Alex was giddy, feeling like he was floating on air, but Flint pressed a finger to his lips. &quot;Shh.. they don&#39;t like people fucking in the bath house.&quot; He said, sounding almost like a little kid excited to be breaking the rules despite he deep voice. It didn&#39;t stop them from spending a few more minutes exchanging kisses and caressing touches.<br />
<br />
A short time later they were bathed, clean, and headed back to he inn. Alex felt like he&#39;d float off if not for the heavy arm wrapped around his shoulder and holding him close, his earlier worries about what the wolf had done to him floating away in a haze of dopey giddiness.</p>
