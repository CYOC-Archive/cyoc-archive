<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary was not about to drink anymore of the vials anytime soon, she thought to herself as he waddled into the kitchen.  He quickly fixed himself a sandwich, but it wasn&#39;t enough so he fixed a couple more.  It took a while, and he cleaned out his refrigerator before he had finally gotten full.  Resting his hands on either side of the bulge were met with kicks.  It felt amazing but he had to see what was going on. <br />
<br />
 Panting softly he used the table to help pull himself up.  Grabbing his car keys, he waddled to the car where he had to slide the seat all the way back due to his much longer legs.  At least his belly wasn&#39;t right up against the steering wheel yet.  Gathering his bearings Mary, headed for the closest urgent care facility.  &quot;I can&#39;t put Mary down on the paperwork,&quot; he said to himself.  &quot;I guess I&#39;ll be Mark,&quot; he decided as he pulled into the parking lot.<br />
<br />
Waddling inside, he got quite a few stares, especially when he not only felt but saw the kicks as well.  Mary, now Mark, got the paperwork and quickly filled it out using his belly as a desk for the clipboard.  Once he had finished with the paperwork, Mark heaved himself up out of the chair and waddled up to the desk to turn it in.  Afterwards, he waddled over to the men&#39;s room where he went in and locked the door.  taking a deep breath he looked over and blushed when he saw a urinal.  After some difficulty, seeing as his belly blocked his view, he used it and then waddled back out to have a seat.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before he was called back.  After the general questions, he was asked about when his current situation had started.  Mark, who on the way over figured he was about 6 or 7 months pregnant.  Mark wan&#39;t about to mention the vials, so he said he had a couple one night stands several months earlier and that since he was a guy he didn&#39;t think much about it until recently.  &quot;The weight i could explain becuase i have been eating a ridiculous amount recently, but i&#39;ve started to feel movement and that is what freaked me out.&quot;  As if to follow what he said, there were a flurry of kicks.  <br />
<br />
The nurse&#39;s eyes widened but she placed a hand over his belly to feel.  The sensation of her hand rubbing over his belly cause Mark to get hard and a very noticeable bulge became prominent under his belly.  The Nurse could&#39;t help but notice and made plans to help him out after they found out.  &quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; she said as she disappeared to track down an ultrasound machine.<br />
<br />
Mark groaned at the sensations he was feeling from the movement.When the nurse came back, she was wheeling an ultrasound machine.  He laid down and lifted his shirt.  Gasping the cold gel he watched as she ran the wand over.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t believe it but you are pregnant, with triplets.&quot; The nurse, Amy, said licking her lips as she glanced over and caught a glimpse of  the bulge underneath his belly.  &quot;I&#39;ll help you out with your other issue in a few minutes, &quot; she said as she printed off  the ultrasound pictures.<br />
<br />
Walking over to the door she locked it and then turned back and walked over to mark.  You are so hot, with your pregnant belly.  &quot;I&#39;ve always had a thing about pregnant bellies,&quot; she said as she ran the towel over his belly wiping the gel off and causing Mark to get even harder.  &quot;do... do you want some help with this she asked running her other hand over his hardening cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;P... lease...&quot; Mark gasped out.  &quot;Okay,&quot; Amy said as she tugged his pants down causing the cock to spring free.  Amy licked her lips as she shucked her scrub bottoms and climbed up on the table and straddled Mark.  Mark was so hard that he almost came from her just positioning herself on him along with the babies kicking.  He bit his lip and did his best not to but once Amy started riding him, he shot his load into her and he was surprised at the amount of cum he had.  <br />
<br />
He groaned in pleasure at the sensation as Amy leaned forward and kissed him before placing her hands on his belly feeling the kicks.  Neither noticed as her belly pushed out slightly looking a little boated as they got ready for round two.</p>
