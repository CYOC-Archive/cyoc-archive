<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><i>Bio: Don&#39;t let Kev&#39;s cocky demeanor fool you. While he&#39;s certainly got the look--laid back and confident in his unique sense of style--he&#39;s got a heart of gold, and loves to be of service (in any way he can). He may not be the smartest banana of the bunch, but he certainly makes up for it with plenty of enthusiasm.</i><br />
<br />
Kevin blinked at his phone. He had to read the bio a couple of times to make sure he&#39;d read it properly. <i>&#39;Loves to be of service?&#39;</i> What the fuck did that mean? He had a sneaking suspicion that made his cock pulse under the table as he blushed slightly.<br />
<br />
Kyle, for his part, found the whole thing hilarious as he leaned on Kevin&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Dude. I mean it makes sense.&quot; He winked with a look that made him feel uncomfortable. &quot;Good to know, though. I might have some ideas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of responding, Kevin shrugged off Kyle&#39;s arm before distracting himself by shoveling some of the food into his mouth. He groaned as he chewed. What was in this? Crack? He bit the skin directly off of the mango and slurped up its yellow flesh before pulling apart a banana from its bottom and taking a bite. He&#39;d never been much of a fruit person, but this was doing it for him.<br />
<br />
Kyle soon lost interest and moved onto what was likely another conquest as Kevin continued to chomp away. He pulled out his phone once more and considered it. He hadn&#39;t even remembered grabbing it that morning, as he had still thought it missing. He turned it over in his long fingers and tried accessing the internet. The site errored out immediately. <i>Hmmm.</i> He flipped to his text conversations and shot Samantha a quick text: &quot;Hey.&quot; It refreshed and failed without sending. He checked the signal: 1 Bar, but it was connected to a wifi he didn&#39;t remember adding: Banana Tree 5G. Trying to reason through things was giving him a headache, so he gave up. At least he had his phone, even if it didn&#39;t work. He had felt naked without it. <i>The irony was lost to him as he sat there in only a Hawaiian shirt and hat.</i><br />
<br />
He glanced around to see if anyone was paying attention to him before he tapped on the NFT app once more. He looked over the 16 Monkey Faces and clicked on the one associated with Marcus as his heart beat faster in his chest.<br />
<br />
<i>Bio: A true Alpha Jock, Marcus looks out for his Troop to make sure everyone is taken care of. He leads with a natural charisma and charm. Be careful, though, because he knows what he wants and he&#39;s not afraid to take it once his mind is set on the prize.</i><br />
<br />
Kevin grinned to himself as he thought of just how accurate that was so far. The man had certainly not been shy about...<br />
<br />
&quot;Good afternoon my dudes! How&#39;s it hanging!&quot; Marcus&#39; booming voice made Kevin jump as he quickly closed out of the app. He turned with the rest of the guys to watch him strut up to the buffet and load up his plate with salad and fruit. &quot;Hey, Brandon! Mind hooking a bro up with a couple pints?&quot; One of the guys Kevin hadn&#39;t really spoken to yet nodded and jumped up to fetch the drinks. He wore only an open vest and a black bowtie as his short tail trailed behind him.<br />
<br />
Trying to steady his breathing, and hoping he wasn&#39;t turning as red as the mango he was eating, Kevin did his best to look disinterested, though felt his heart flutter again at Marcus&#39; natural command of the room. He was acutely aware as he walked up to his table and tossed his plate next to him, some of the salad flying, before he pulled Kevin&#39;s chin to look at him so he could give him a forceful kiss in front of everyone. His ears burned as he caught Kyle grinning at him from the corner of his eye.<br />
<br />
Marcus sat down next to him as though nothing had happened and tore into a banana with his teeth. He spit the peel out and took a bite before grinning at Kevin. &quot;Ah, thanks bro.&quot; By this time Brandon had set the 2 glasses of beer in front of the jock, and he casually pushed one towards Kevin with a wink. &quot;Drink up, bud. Nothing cures a hangover like more beer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon the table was full as several of the other guys joined them, naturally drawn to Marcus as he started laughing about the stupid shit they&#39;d done last night. He hoped against hope that Marcus wouldn&#39;t mention how they&#39;d started the day as he sipped at his drink, feeling ashamed and horny. And he jumped when Marcus casually took his dick into his hand under the table, which throbbed in earnest, fingering at the tip with his thumb without breaking conversation.<br />
<br />
Kevin did his best to steady his breathing. He wanted Marcus to stop, but couldn&#39;t summon the willpower to take his hand off of his dick as it teased him secretly in front of the group. <i>This was WRONG!</i> He realized he must have looked ridiculous as he focused; Marcus began to pump his cock with his hand. His mouth had a subtle grin to it that made it obvious he knew exactly what he was doing to Kevin as he continued, still not breaking conversation about his latest favorite reddit thread. Something about another short in the market that went over Kevin&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh...oohhh. ohhhhh. oo ooh...&quot;<br />
<br />
He tried taking a bite of his banana to distract him, but that didn&#39;t help in the least as the taste and the sensations made him moan out loud. He was too far gone at this point to really smooth any of it over as his entire body tingled from the extra oxygen he was huffing. He was getting close, and he was about to explode. <i>In front of everyone.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh ooh ooh oo ooh....&quot;<br />
<br />
He flexed and curled his toes, his tail spasming behind him as he tried to focus. His breathing was irregular as he shuddered, and he was only barely aware that the conversation had stopped as he hyperventilated. Marcus&#39; grin grew wickedly as he pumped fully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh oo! Oo ooh! Ook ooh OOK!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin came with a screeching cry as his cum painted the bottom of the table before dripping onto his furry leg. He leaned back in his chair, the orgasmic relief quickly turning into red-hot embarrassment as he panted. Everyone was staring at him and he wanted to die.<br />
<br />
Marcus grinned and made a show of licking off his long thumb, which had a large smear of Kevin&#39;s cum on it. &quot;PolkaDOT&#39;s been fucked lately! I&#39;ve lost so much...&quot; He resumed the conversation as Kevin buried his face in his hands to hide from the horny smirks that now surrounded him.</p>
