<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was taking an evening class, a computer class in Win98/NT. My instructor, <br />
Miss Betch, was a skinny little woman in her early 50&#39;s. She had no womanly <br />
shape to her at all. In fact, she looked like a curly haired boy wearing <br />
lipstick. I knew she disliked me right in the beginning of the course since <br />
it started at the end of summer, still warm enough to wear slinky tops. In <br />
my case, I had been coming into class in my tight slinky little tops making <br />
my happy 42GG&#39;s stand out for her to ruefully view.<br />
<br />
During my third week of the course I experienced (as I usually did during <br />
particular times of the month) my condition that makes me a &quot;balloon girl.&quot; <br />
I went into class after a rather BIG day. I had checked the small digital <br />
gage attached to the middle of my brassiere (in the area between the <br />
expandable cups of my custom-made bra) and it read 68H. Once beyond 42 the <br />
actual number signified the measurement from around my back and bust.<br />
<br />
I sat at my computer in the classroom, practicing some operations, when Miss <br />
Betch creeped up behind me. I smelled her reeking breath as she opened her <br />
mouth to speak. &quot;I am surprised you can even type, Miss MELON-OW-SKI,&quot; she <br />
said. &quot;With breasts that big I am surprised you can even see your shoes to <br />
tie them.&quot; She didn&#39;t speak loudly but enough so that the people on either <br />
side of me could hear.<br />
<br />
Luckily I knew the computer keyboard and even though my bloated bulging <br />
boobs stuck out round and fat over the keyboard, I still managed to type.<br />
<br />
I looked at the boyish-looking bright-red haired woman and grinned. &quot;You <br />
probably have no problem tying your shoelaces.&quot; The people on either side of <br />
me chuckled. Miss Betch&#39;s face grew as red as her hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;You watch it, Miss Boobs, if you want to pass this class!&quot; she said poking <br />
a finger into my boob that was hid and bulging beneath my white top. The <br />
poke sent a ripple of movement through my breast that made my whole top <br />
jiggle. The action (as usual) made my ultra-sensitive nipples rub against <br />
the thick-stitched lacing of the bra cups, making my chubby nipples <br />
prominently poke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Stop that!&quot; I said though that was all I said. I need the class for <br />
credits towards my degree so I didn&#39;t want to press my luck even if she <br />
pressed my boobs.<br />
<br />
The woman walked away with her pointed nose in the air. I stopped typing and <br />
brought my little hands to the sides of my big boobs. I pushed them <br />
together, mashed them together like two large fluffy pillows. Sliding my <br />
hands forward, I partially cupped my perk nipples and squeezed and pulled <br />
them then let them go as they sort of snapped back to position but now a <br />
little fatter and longer and more prominent than they had been. I giggled <br />
seeing the guy seated next to me looking.<br />
<br />
Putting my fingers back to the keyboard, I continued my computer exercise.<br />
<br />
Two hours later, the class let out. I finished up the last grueling exercise <br />
and was heading to the door when Miss Betch stepped in my way. Her beady <br />
green eyes were on my bouncing bosoms as I came to an abrupt halt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you like flaunting those big tits of yours, don&#39;t you, Miss <br />
Melonowski?&quot; the woman sneered wickedly. She reminded of the evil witch in <br />
the Wizard of Oz.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just how I am,&quot; I said not wanting to really let her know that I liked <br />
being big busted. What I really wanted was to end my inflatable condition <br />
but have a bust that was super SUPER sized permanently. &quot;I am sorry I can&#39;t <br />
be like you though I am kind of glad.&quot; I didn&#39;t mean to be mean but I <br />
couldn&#39;t help it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You watch yourself or you&#39;ll be heading into the School of Hard Knocks,&quot; <br />
she hissed like snake.<br />
<br />
I put my index finger to my chin and rolled my eyes. &quot;Hmmm, I&#39;ve attended <br />
and graduated from the School of Big Soft Knockers. I suppose the School of <br />
Hard Knocks might need someone like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman fumed. I thought she might erupt like a red-hot volcano. Instead <br />
she turned, pulled something from the briefcase on her desk and turned and <br />
smacked me roughly in the ass. I squealed and jumped, making my huge boobies <br />
bounce against my chin. It wasn&#39;t the slap that stung but the prick of a <br />
needle like poke into my behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, sweetie. We&#39;ll see how you enjoy some added fluff,&quot; she grinned as I <br />
rubbed my bottom. She held a small syringe in her hand and it was empty.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can take anything you can dish out, Miss, Miss BITCH!&quot; I said storming out <br />
of the classroom.<br />
<br />
Not knowing what the woman injected me with I stopped at a 24 hour Quicky <br />
Med to get checked out. I told the doctor in charge that I had accidentally <br />
sat on a syringe and wasn&#39;t sure if I had poisoned myself, or something, in <br />
the process. The blood test he took didn&#39;t take long. He soon returned to my <br />
little examination room with the good, if not slightly strange, news.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Miss Melonowski,&quot; the doctor said mostly to my huge boobs that he <br />
couldn&#39;t take his eyes off. It was a common occurrence so it didn&#39;t bother <br />
me. &quot;The tests all come out negative. No poisons or any other nastiness is <br />
in your system.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed with relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering though how long have you been breastfeeding and have you <br />
been having trouble breastfeeding?&quot; the doctor asked innocently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Breastfeeding? I&#39;m not breastfeeding,&quot; I said gently patting my plumped-up <br />
breasts. &quot;Though it probably looks like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor cleared his throat and turned a slight shade of red. &quot;Oh. Er, must <br />
have just been an error on the test results. Sorry. You can leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shrugging my shoulders, making my big boobs hop in my white tight top, I <br />
slid off the examination table and left the place. I was eager to get home <br />
and go to bed. I was suddenly feeling drained of energy.<br />
<br />
I got home, fed my face with a little treat of marshmallow chocolate fudge <br />
super-fattening ice cream and got ready for bed. Slipping into my cotton <br />
jammies (white top and white-and-black spotted bottoms), I plopped down on <br />
the couch in front of the television with a second heaping helping of the <br />
ice cream. Each chilly scoop sent shivers through my body as I ate the ice <br />
cream, making my perky nipples pop up like the turkeys were done. It made my <br />
whole body tingle. Mmmmmm.<br />
<br />
Finishing the last scoop of yummy ice cream, I set the bowl down and sat <br />
back to watch Letterman. I shivered, feeling the cool tingle spread <br />
throughout my body. The sensation seemed to subside in my tummy but continue <br />
in my upper body and abdomen. &quot;My goodness. That must be good stuff,&quot; I <br />
giggled as my nipples got harder and harder and really poked up like stubby <br />
steel spikes in my pajama top. &quot;Ow. Come on now, girls. Simmer down,&quot; I <br />
moaned rubbing the ends of my erect nipples through the clothing. My fat <br />
nipples were so hard they actually ached. Rubbing them though certainly felt <br />
as delicious as the ice cream did maybe more so.<br />
<br />
I sighed as I felt my breasts begin to swell ever so slightly. &quot;Oh my! That <br />
was good ice cream!&quot; But I knew it probably wasn&#39;t what I had just eaten <br />
that was causing me to begin to blossom.<br />
<br />
I sat back lost in a wash of ecstasy as my boobs expanded in my pajama top. <br />
My brain was reeling in the sweet sensations as my super turgid nipples were <br />
rubbed and pressed taut against the material of the stretching but tight <br />
top. The sensations rippled right down to my midsection and I felt an orgasm <br />
building ever so sweetly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yessss...bbbiggggerrrr...&quot; I moaned as I was mooshed further and further <br />
into my cushy couch. Then my eyes snapped open. &quot;HOLEY HOLSTEINS!&quot; I cried <br />
as the weight of my gargantuan breasts, now pressing into my lap, was felt. <br />
I ran my hands over the still swelling boob-pontoons. The front of my <br />
stretched pajama top was tearing where my super fat nipples stuck out <br />
against it. A large wet spot, the size of a dinner plate, dampened the pj <br />
top at my jutting nipples.<br />
<br />
I cried out again as, the top giving up the ghost, split at the nipples and <br />
the growing nipples sprang free. &quot;Oh my goodness! I&#39;m a MILKER!&quot; I exclaimed <br />
seeing large droplets of white liquid emerging from my throbbing nipples and <br />
feeling the fullness within my ballooning breasts.<br />
<br />
There was another pressure but this one was below my boobs. In fact, my <br />
boobs were pressing heavily upon what I thought was my abdomen. I squeezed <br />
my hands under my colossal jugs and found a huge mound there. At first I <br />
thought it was my belly that had inflated because it felt like I was <br />
pregnant from the great roundness. Then as I ran my hands over the <br />
beachball-sized bulge I felt one...no, two...three...four other oblong <br />
lumps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit! What&#39;s happening to me?&quot; I said as I ran my hands over and over <br />
the bulge below. My pajama bottoms, that were very big and more stretchy <br />
than my tearing top, held the new growth perfectly but as I felt the bulge <br />
more then slipped a hand down to my flat tummy between my huge heavy breasts <br />
and the abdominal bulge...I realized... &quot;MY GOSH! I&#39;VE GROWN AN UDDER!&quot;<br />
<br />
The huge milk sac ballooned, filling more and more with rich creamy Helia <br />
milk. It slipped over the edge of the couch and me and my full tits <br />
followed. I hit the floor, luckily catching myself on hands and knees plus <br />
the huge udder between my legs that pressed to the floor helped keep me <br />
upright.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh NNoooo!&quot; I gasped as my two enormous boobs blew the pajama top and <br />
the billowing udder swelled faster. My pj bottoms, needing room for the <br />
growing milk sac, slipped down away from my cute round tush. The udder <br />
filled so much it began to overflow the rim of my bottoms, squeezing <br />
massively between my legs. I looked to the phone...it was across the room. I <br />
couldn&#39;t even roll over there for fear I&#39;d smother myself with my three <br />
super heavy milk reservoirs. So I just let whatever was coursing through my <br />
system take hold...knowing it was something Miss Betch had injected me with.<br />
<br />
My boobs and my new big cow&#39;s udder grew and grew and grew. I was soon <br />
halfway up to the ceiling resting on my giant full and round boobs and <br />
udder.<br />
<br />
With nothing more I could do I watched television until I dozed off, falling <br />
asleep on my enormous pillows.<br />
<br />
When morning came I awoke on the floor with my top in pieces and pajama <br />
bottoms stretched to falling off. I was back down to normal as normal would <br />
be for me. I checked my abdomen by parting my huge breasts and found no <br />
udder. My breasts were bigger than the day before and I thought the milk <br />
experience might have just been a dream...until I twisted my nipples into a <br />
pleasant erection then continued in pinching and squeezing the hard nubs. I <br />
placed my hands on the sides of my full feeling boobies and gave them a <br />
push, mashing their immenseness together...<br />
<br />
...geysers of milk spurted from my nips like white fountains</p>
