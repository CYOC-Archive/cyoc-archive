<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He thinks about his own mother. His mother&#39;s name is Lilith, now recently turned 38 years old. She has long brunette hair and emerald eyes. Him judging by her physical appearance. His mother&#39;s height is around 5&#39; 8, around 120s in weight, and has a breast size of around a D. She has a fit slim sexy body, everything about her is perfect except her ass, it’s pretty small even though her boobs are perfect. She is a happy and positive woman who loves her family. She eats very healthy and work’s out once in a while, doing yoga, and other activities. Every time he sees his own mother doing yoga he get hard seeing her cleavage and a faint camel toe showing through her yoga pants, he always hide his boner whenever his mother glances at him. She works at a hospital as a nurse, she told him that the reason why she wanted to become a nurse is because of losing someone that was once extremely close to her. That someone was his father that died at 28, his father died from a rare heart disease. His name was Finn, his mom have been married with his father for 10 years, immediately right after they were both done with high school. Sometimes when ever she sees Jeff, she always thinks of her husband. That is because Jeff looks a lot like his father. She hates the thought of loosing someone near and dear to them. She feels that she wants help the others, preventing other&#39;s on what she has been through. His mother&#39;s is such an innocent angel, he really loves his mom&#39;s whole personality.<br />
<br />
Now if Jeff made her mother a Succubus, since description said that Succubus can reproduce with a human. That means his older and younger sister will also be Succubus.<br />
<br />
Thinking about his sisters, his older sister’s name is Trisha. She also just recently days ago turned 18, that being because she was born on their mother’s birthday. She has shoulder length blonde hair and ocean blue eyes, which she got from their father. Him judging by her physical appearance. His older sister&#39;s height is around 5&#39; 8, around 100s in weight, her breast are pretty small, looks like the size of under a C. She has a slim body like their mother, except that of being fit and toned, and a small ass like their mother. She is kind of acts like a brat all the time. She is always acts cold towards you, perhaps THE coldest towards you. Such a mean personality. Now his younger sister, her name is Emma, around a week she will turn 16, and around two weeks you will turn 17, her birthday is a week off from his. She has long brunette hair and emerald eyes, which she got from their mother.  Him judging by her physical appearance. His older sister&#39;s height is around 5&#39; 7, everything else she takes from her older sister. Her behavior and personality towards you and everyone else is positive, like your mother she doesn’t wine, complain, or acts cold.<br />
<br />
He decided &quot;Screw it!&quot; he said to himself, as he set the target on his own mother. He then clicked &quot;Start Change!&quot; button. Jeff was getting so excited, as the machine was starting to process. While that was happening something was happening to him. Jeff was starting to loose consciousness, everything was starting to get dizzy, blurry, and then eventually getting dark. He black out, then seconds later he eventually woke back up laying on his bedroom floor.<br />
<br />
He opened his eyes, and got up the floor. His head was hurting him for a brief second. He looks around and tries to take in on what happened to him. He sees that nothing has changed so far. Jeff was getting a little dubious. “This whole thing better not be some sort of joke! This crap better be real!” Jeff thought to himself, as he stood in front of his computer staring at the program, doing it’s thing. Jeff decides that he wants to put his laptop under his bed, when he minimized the Chronivac, a pop-up showed up. It’s says: “If you ever put the device in sleep mode the Chronivac will still be running. Also if the computer ever crashes or shuts down, it will still run and do it’s thing. Other than that, enjoy! :)” “Oh, nice to know that!” Jeff thought to himself as he proceeds to close the laptop and shoved it under his bed. Jeff stood up, thinking on what to do next...</p>
