<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the memorable Friday night, the swap between the three was reversed on Saturday afternoon. Both Haylee and Lucas openly admitted that they had enjoyed the experience more than they expected, but ultimately that it was just a fun diversion and nothing more. For his part, Ethan very much agreed -- it had been like a short holiday from the norm, and he was glad they had done it.<br />
<br />
Sunday rolled into Monday and with it, a new school week. All things considered, it was uneventful and quiet from Ethan&#39;s perspective. No sleepovers nor psychotic breaks to think about. It was business as usual; he was on top of homework, keeping up with swimming practice, and his relationships with his friends and Lucas were doing just fine. He even got to enjoy wearing his kiddy underwear reasonably often, and there was something very satisfying and uninhibited about it, something that kept his perverted side happy and firmly in check.<br />
<br />
By that Friday, however, Ethan found his thoughts returning to the last chat he had with Eric after the sleepover, nearly two weeks earlier. The generalised idea of wanting &#39;something more&#39; had been floating around at the back of his mind ever since then, though he had no real idea what that would be and how to achieve it. Regardless, Eric had been well behaved and very accommodating of his intimacy with Lucas during the intervening weekend. Ethan was proud of how emotionally intelligent Eric was for his age, and though he knew the ring had contributed and forced that growth somewhat, he still felt that he owed his little brother some alone time, at the very least.<br />
<br />
Eric was all smiles when Ethan dropped in to his room to simply hang out on the Friday evening. Of course, they lived together, but more often than not it was the younger after the older&#39;s approval and attention. It was mostly just small talk about Eric&#39;s week, things that were happening at school and how he was dealing with social expectations. Ethan couldn&#39;t help apologising for what he felt was his neglect of Eric, but the younger brushed the concerns away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you aren&#39;t really like that.&quot; Eric shrugged where he was sitting, the two on his bed while they talked. &quot;It&#39;s not like it&#39;s just you, either. I&#39;ve been thinking about the swapping thing often. I mean, I&#39;ve been hogging m- ... our cock a lot, and I guess I feel guilty about that. I mean ... on Wednesday, I kept the big one for like ... the whole day, more than 24 hours. It doesn&#39;t seem fair to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I didn&#39;t remind you about it either. I didn&#39;t stop you, nor say anything! I mean, aren&#39;t I kinda doing the same thing as you -- not sharing as much as I think I should? It&#39;s selfish, and I guess I think ... I caused that guilt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can we BOTH be the bad guy though?&quot; Eric giggled. &quot;Like, is it for real being guilty or being selfish?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly ... I&#39;m not actually sure.&quot; Ethan was thoughtful, and he bit his lip while he pondered it. &quot;Let me ask you this instead: you just feel more comfortable when you&#39;re swapped, right? I know I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So ... why don&#39;t we try to figure out what that means a bit more? Maybe we can do something with the ring that&#39;s new, you know?&quot; He was thinking hard about what that could be, though nothing immediately came to mind. &quot;Something that makes us understand what&#39;s going on a bit better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm.&quot; Eric shuffled over to his nightstand, taking the ring out of a drawer, and he put it on, before sitting back beside his brother again. &quot;I think that,&quot; he paused, as if he were considering something weighty, &quot;I have an idea. You ... trust me, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric.&quot; Ethan reached over and ruffled his little brother&#39;s hair. &quot;After everything that&#39;s happened over the last couple of months, I think you know I do. I trust you more than anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; He nodded, clutching the ring tightly in a balled fist. &quot;Um, I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s gonna happen, so ... brace yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Eric concentrated, the two of them both instinctively closing their eyes, and then there was the familiar sensation of the magic at work, followed by ...<br />
<br />
.. what was THAT?<br />
<br />
Ethan snapped his eyes open, immediately knowing something out of the ordinary had happened, because the swap had felt different. Not the normal feeling of parts transferring, but more like ... he had shifted, moved somewhere.<br />
<br />
What Ethan saw was his own shocked face looking down at him, from the same spot that he had just occupied on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;E-Eric?&quot; The word he spoke came out higher pitched, and there was no denying the reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah. It&#39;s me.&quot; Hearing his own voice from the third person was bizarre, but he didn&#39;t have time to dwell on it because the newly-teenaged Eric kept on with the reply. &quot;I ... swapped our brains. I guess we kinda teleported into each other?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so.&quot; Ethan&#39;s new voice was now so soft and boyish, and there was something oddly interesting about hearing himself that way. &quot;I suppose that means the consciousness just goes wherever the brain goes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, it&#39;s basically a full body swap.&quot; Eric lifted his hands up, examining them, marveling at how much larger they were. &quot;This is- ... so fucking cool!&quot; He looked directly at &#39;Ethan&#39;, the excitement clear in his voice as he asked for permission. &quot;Can I- ... is it okay if I explore?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you can.&quot; Ethan chuckled. It was somewhat humorous how backwards the question was coming from somebody who was currently physically six years older than him, but Ethan kept the amusement aside. &quot;It was your idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Eric promptly stood up and moved across to check himself out in the mirror, Ethan looked down to take everything in. His arms and legs were so slender, his fingers and hands seeming delicate from what he was used to. He felt lighter too, like he weighed next to nothing, and also ... more agile? As an athletic seventeen year old, he had always been quick on his feet, but through the lens of somebody much smaller and less muscular, there was a quickness there like a cat.<br />
<br />
It was clear that this was why Eric enjoyed playing soccer -- he could be fast, even if he was smaller than the other boys.<br />
<br />
At the same time, Eric had already removed his shirt, and he was doing poses involving his upper body, showing off the biceps; flexing and squeezing them. Then with no more hesitation, he was pulling off the shorts and underwear, and staring at himself totally naked. Of course, his lower body was just as good; all the work Ethan put in was absolutely obvious, and it appeared fantastic. Not the least of all his cock -- long and thick and flaccid, it lay contentedly between the thighs.<br />
<br />
As he ran his hands along his sides and down to his knees, just feeling the awesome shape and sculpture of his borrowed body, Eric couldn&#39;t help thinking it was a bit odd seeing his cock that way. He didn&#39;t mind, but he definitely preferred it on his younger self, and there was the weird thought that something this size didn&#39;t quite fit Ethan anymore.<br />
<br />
Still, to Eric, the imagery was incredible.<br />
<br />
&quot;I look SO good like this. Ethan looks great!&quot; He thought. &quot;I wonder how he&#39;s feeling as me?&quot;<br />
<br />
His curiosity was answered as the &#39;older&#39; brother stood up next to him, so he could look in the mirror too. Ethan&#39;s face was tinged red from watching the show of Eric stripping and basically feeling up his own body. None of it was sexual, but it was weirdly embarrassing to watch &#39;himself&#39; do that, so instead he turned his attention to his own reflection.<br />
<br />
The face of his little brother stared back: large eyes, little nose, messy dark hair. He was definitely cute, and being so short and small made him really feel like a kid.<br />
<br />
The power of the magic they were dealing with felt more on display here than it had ever been, and there was a part of him that was in awe at what they&#39;d discovered through experimentation.<br />
<br />
If the ring could do something like this, maybe there were other things to be learned about. Maybe it could do ... more?<br />
<br />
First though, Ethan knew he wanted to take the idea further, and he was certain Eric did too. A concept began forming in his mind, a way to test a theory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric.&quot; Ethan&#39;s boyish voice was still mildly thrilling to hear, and the statement made his &#39;younger&#39; brother pause, right as teenaged Eric finished pulling the underwear back on, the monstrous bulge still very visible front and centre even as it was crammed back behind fabric again. &quot;Do you want to spend the entire day like this? We could see how much we like ... being each other? Find out if we want something like this, or not. I was thinking, I could drive us to the water park tomorrow. It&#39;s far enough that we won&#39;t see many people we know, and we could just ... enjoy it.&quot; He felt some reservation in asking, like maybe it was a step too far. &quot;Would you- ... would you want that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d wanna do this for a whole day?&quot; The surprise in his tone was clear. &quot;You&#39;d be okay with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yeah?&quot; Kid Ethan mumbled his reply back. &quot;I just offered, didn&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Yes I want to!&quot; Eric picked him up in a sudden hug, his arms wrapped closely around, heat flashing across Ethan&#39;s face at the embarrassment of being lifted and embraced like a child. &quot;I can&#39;t wait! This is gonna be SO cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
The following day, the Morales brothers were up earlier than normal, with Ethan avoiding their hungover father while he made them both breakfast. After that, they chose outfits for each other to wear once they were on site. The reasoning was simple: if they were going to BE one another, dressing for the day&#39;s role was part of that. Each packed what the other had chosen without too much inspection, along with towels and a few other basic sundry items.<br />
<br />
Then it was into the car with their things ... and away!<br />
<br />
Eric was excited the whole trip, talking most of the drive there, while Ethan, buoyed by his brother&#39;s eagerness, found himself looking forward to whatever this new experience would bring.<br />
<br />
He was admittedly a little nervous at the potential for anything to go wrong, but that didn&#39;t diminish the effect of Eric&#39;s enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
They arrived in the later morning at the water park. It was a warm sunny day, and the park was a popular destination when the weather was good, so there were already plenty of people there. After a short queue later and some money exchanged, they were admitted inside with a day pass each.<br />
<br />
Before doing anything else, they moved out of the way of the foot traffic, and Eric carefully brandished the ring. There was no danger in swapping literally right in front of any number of people because there was no outward sign of anything being different.<br />
<br />
So, right there, in a bustling hallway leading from the entry to the changing rooms, they traded bodies.<br />
<br />
One moment, Ethan was looking down at his little brother, the next he was staring up at his own face, the ring on his finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready to go, little brother?&quot; The teenage Eric grinned at him, and they began to walk together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really gonna call me that?&quot; Ethan rolled his eyes. &quot;You know I can make things awkward for you later at home, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Eric laughed, and Ethan noted an odd thrill at the sound, just as how his now youthful soprano made him feel a certain type of way. &quot;I won&#39;t be dumb about it, I swear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You better not be. I&#39;ll kick your ass.&quot; He said it with a straight face, though after a second, they both burst into laughter, the mock threat sounding completely ridiculous coming out of Ethan&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
Next, it was on to getting changed.<br />
<br />
Ethan had chosen a pair of colourful swim shorts that echoed the design of his favourite juvenile underwear, plus a tee for whenever he was out of the pool. However, when they met at the lockers to stash their belongings, he saw what Eric was wearing and it was, for lack of a better word, blatant.<br />
<br />
Though he spent a lot of time at practice and sporting events wearing a speedo, he was absolutely not accustomed to doing so as a fashion statement, nor for the sex appeal of it. Eric clearly had this in mind, because he had on one of Ethan&#39;s older ones that was bright red.<br />
<br />
It was weird to think that other people say him this way too, often when it was completely unintentional.<br />
<br />
But ... that wasn&#39;t all.<br />
<br />
Eric had packed JUST a speedo. Apart from a towel, Eric had not brought anything else in the way of poolwear, not even a tee. All he could see was his own bare chest, in all its shirtless glory, the lines of muscle definition worn proudly by his &#39;little brother.&#39; Ethan felt his face heating up at the sight with the knowledge that Eric would be flaunting this for the entire day. Not only did he seem so completely unconcerned by having nearly everything on display, but he was even confidently appraising Ethan back, seeming to approve of the choice in return.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re looking good too! I haven&#39;t worn those shorts in a while, but I always liked them.&quot; Eric looked him over in approval, and he was smiling warmly in reaction. Ethan couldn&#39;t help but smile back despite the oddity of what they were doing, his brother&#39;s energy being infectious. &quot;I know I&#39;m probably more excited than you are, but I want you to have as much of a good time as I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I plan to.&quot; Ethan gave him a smirk, as they finished cramming their stuff into the locker, making sure the ring was well hidden inside. &quot;Just promise me you won&#39;t do anything really stupid to have fun. Like, nothing reckless. You&#39;re cosplaying as me, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise I&#39;ll be careful,&quot; Eric lowered his voice, Ethan closing and securing the locker door. A look passed between them, and he snickered. &quot;Though if something accidentally comes off, and some old lady gets an eyeful, don&#39;t blame me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Internally, Ethan sighed.<br />
<br />
If anything like that DID happen, he prayed he was at least elsewhere so he didn&#39;t have to witness it.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
They split up after leaving the changing rooms. Ethan certainly didn&#39;t need any supervision, because he wasn&#39;t mentally a child, and since Eric wasn&#39;t physically one, neither did he. Agreeing to meet up later, Ethan went his own way, and Eric?<br />
<br />
He wanted to test this body out.<br />
<br />
Strolling along to the deeper pools with diving boards, he could feel the glances as he walked, the concrete and molded plastic damp under his feet. Just the casual attention he was already getting was so satisfying, and he had only arrived! Eric knew it was going to be a good day, and he climbed onto the lowest board, then dived straight in, imitating the way he knew Ethan would do it.<br />
<br />
Surfacing, Eric swam over to the pool side. Everything was SO easy -- his body felt powerful, and moving through the water was effortless. It took no energy at all to climb out of the pool and go for a second round. There were even more casual glances now that he was wet, and he felt on top of the world as he dived in again, and just for the heck of it, swam freestyle across to the far side before exiting.<br />
<br />
His big brother had always been something of a superhero in Eric&#39;s mind, but now, physically? He wasn&#39;t built like Captain America or Superman, but he sure felt as if he was that strong.<br />
<br />
For the next few minutes, he worked his way up the diving boards, each allowing him to enjoy his capability and swimming prowess a little more, until he was on one of the highest. Doing a big dive off it, the moment after Eric hit the water, he knew something was wrong.<br />
<br />
Coming to the pool side, he knew the speedo was gone, ripped from the stress of a high-diving impact. He thought it had seemed sturdy enough at home, but in retrospect it was one of the oldest Ethan owned, so it was no real surprise that it had given out.<br />
<br />
And now? It was useless, and lost somewhere in the depths of the voluminous diving pool.<br />
<br />
Calling out to the duty lifeguard, Eric tried to get their notice. The nearest was a teenager too -- a newbie from the look of it -- and he came over, offering his assistance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got a slight problem.&quot; Eric smiled at the boy, hoping the day&#39;s good humour and his friendly attitude would ease the situation&#39;s incoming awkwardness. &quot;My speedo kinda died when I dived in, and now I don&#39;t have anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-ooh. Okay.&quot; The boy smiled and nodded back, a slight stutter in his voice. &quot;I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dashing over to one of the staff equipment stashes, the boy was returning in seconds with a towel, but Eric, knowing he completely and absolutely could NOT let this moment slide without taking action, simply climbed out of the pool to receive it.<br />
<br />
Fully and shamelessly naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Cheerily, Eric took the towel, daubing it over his chest first, before easily and without any rush, dropping it down to tie around his waist. The lifeguard teen was staring slackjawed, his eyes wide, and Eric thought how much it reminded him of the female shop assistant who interrupted him when he was buying underwear. Here though, he wasn&#39;t sure if it was shock, amazement, or maybe even ... interest?<br />
<br />
Eric couldn&#39;t tell which, but the boy snapped out of it quickly enough, and began escorting him to the staff lounge. The teen seemed stuck somewhere between flighty and super nervous, but he immediately promised, without Eric even having to ask, that they would find something similar for him to wear. Making small talk didn&#39;t help the nerves either, though as they were entering the lounge, Eric managed to get his name.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Jesse. Um, I- ... I&#39;ll just grab what we have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, back in moments, he dumped a small pile of speedos, but before he could leave to give even a little privacy, Eric deliberately introduced himself. &quot;I&#39;m Ethan. Nice to meet you, Jesse.&quot; Casually he whipped the towel away and plucked the first speedo up, facing towards the boy a bit more as he did so, making sure everything was visible. Eric could feel his cock plump slightly from the awesome reactions he was getting, though he had enough self-control to stop it going any further.<br />
<br />
&quot;How old are you?&quot; Eric slid the first speedo up his legs, lingering on the muscles in his thighs as he raised it towards the goal, the material beginning to strain from the mass. &quot;I&#39;m seventeen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m, um ... f- ... fifteen.&quot; He stammered, his eyes as round as saucers.<br />
<br />
The first didn&#39;t make it all the way to his cock, as it didn&#39;t really fit even slightly, so they were straight off. His shaft stuck to his leg as he removed them, and Eric pulled it away, straightening it so it hung free. He even caught Jesse furtively glancing as it swayed in the air for a moment, following it briefly like it was a pendulum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot; He grinned and held up the second pair, snapping the material to make sure they were hardy, his fingers tracing around the crotch pouch as if examining it for defects, making sure it was strong enough. Though, it was really just an excuse to stand there naked a little longer and chat, before he started on the second. &quot;You&#39;re in good shape for fifteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t like Eric was much of a judge in actuality, but he had to pay a compliment to his captive audience. Besides, Jesse WAS in good shape; he had one of those wiry athletic builds. Dark brown tousled hair, average height for a teen, and a boy-next-door face. Cute, but in a blend-into-the-crowd kind of way. Maybe a bit shy too, though it was hard to know if he was normally like this, or if it was all a result of what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-thanks.&quot; He swallowed. &quot;You too. In good shape, I mean. No, uh, g-great shape! You look ... great!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks back at ya! I swim a lot.&quot; While it wasn&#39;t him doing that swimming, it was still true that Ethan did, so Eric felt fine claiming it. &quot;Hey, do you think this fits?&quot; He gestured casually to his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- ... um- ... wh- ... &quot; Jesse managed, his breathing shaky, before he composed himself. &quot;It ... looks a bit ... tight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; Eric tried to pull it up fully over his rear to match the front, but the fabric just wouldn&#39;t move. It felt like the speedo had choked in the middle of trying to swallow each cheek, and while he didn&#39;t think Ethan had a notably big butt, it was more than enough for the second pair. He removed it, the muscle tensing in his thighs, his junk blessedly allowed breathing room again. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got a good eye.&quot; He took the third. &quot;Have you been here long?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-not long.&quot; Jesse shook his head. &quot;I&#39;m still a trainee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Eric told him, &quot;if you&#39;re always this helpful, I think they&#39;ll keep you.&quot; He turned to the side, giving Jesse a good profile view of his butt, and the bulging front of the third speedo. &quot;What about these? I think it&#39;s too tight around my ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y- ... th- ... I- ... I t-think you need something bigger, something l-l-large enough for you.&quot; Controlling his anxious stutter, his ragged breath, Jesse plucked a roomier electric blue speedo from the pile and handed it to Eric as he was removing the failed third.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome.&quot; Even as he focused on pulling on the fourth speedo, Eric could feel Jesse&#39;s flitting darting averted eyes come to rest on his crotch, and he knew it was definitely because the boy thought he was preoccupied and wouldn&#39;t notice. His cock plumped even more, thickening and lengthening slightly, his balls brushing against his thighs with a weight to them that felt like they were performing for an audience. There was no denying it, Eric was LOVING being watched, so he slowed his movements a little, pretending to have a bit of difficulty in pulling up the garment just so Jesse got to see more, got to experience this glorious sight for seconds longer.<br />
<br />
Finally, he got them all the way on, and they fit really well. Snug around his rear, and also around his groin, but not uncomfortably so. They were close enough to what Ethan wore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great choice, Jesse!&quot; He stood up straight, and he and the boy looked at each other. Jesse&#39;s face was flushed, his eyes big, but he had a very slight smile on his face. &quot;Thank you so much for your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; For the first time, he managed to speak stutter-free. &quot;I ... enjoyed meeting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I enjoyed meeting you too.&quot; Eric flashed him an encouraging smile, causing the boy&#39;s cheeks to flush a hotter red. &quot;Hope I&#39;ll see you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he turned and walked across to the lounge door, pausing before he went through to partially turn back and give a final addon. &quot;I&#39;ll try not to rip this one too,&quot; he winked, and shot another warm look Jesse&#39;s way, &quot;unless you want to hang out sometime?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he let himself out, keenly aware of the boy&#39;s gaze on him the entire way, even as he exited through into the complex.<br />
<br />
For Eric, it was an absolutely amazing first act for the day. Getting to be naked in front of an audience, getting to be appreciated and seen for how good he looked that way?<br />
<br />
He just hoped Ethan was off to a start as good as this.<br />
<br />
At the same time, inside the staff lounge, Jesse was still staring at &#39;Ethan&#39; as the older teen walked away, his heart drumming a thousand miles an hour, his breath shallow, his nerves totally shot, his mind struggling to catch up with the last couple of minutes.<br />
<br />
It was one hell of a dramatic way to discover that he was more wrong about his own sexuality than he thought possible, and and he doubted this memory would leave him for the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
Jesse was definitely gay.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
When Eric walked off in the direction of the diving pools, something that was definitively more for adults, Ethan took the direct opposite approach. After passing by the most basic wading pool for those barely past the toddler stage, he found one of the shallower pools for kids around his physical age range.<br />
<br />
There were plenty of boys and girls already splashing around, with the clamour and cries of their play making the area lively and full of activity. He was still feeling the nerves from earlier, not really sure why they were persisting.<br />
<br />
Nobody KNEW it was him.<br />
<br />
They couldn&#39;t see that he was really seventeen.<br />
<br />
Still, after he jumped in and began to swim around for a while, even joining in on some of the games the other kids were playing in a desire to blend in, he felt himself becoming philosophical about what was happening.<br />
<br />
He thought about why they were doing this swap -- taking the day to be in each other&#39;s body. It had been crystal clear from the start that Eric wanted to do it, and Ethan could admit the idea was intriguing to him ... but why?<br />
<br />
If he thought hard, the real question seemed obvious -- was he just interested in having his little brother&#39;s penis, or did he actually want to BE Eric?<br />
<br />
As he slipped through the water, Ethan couldn&#39;t deny that he was actually beginning to enjoy being this way. Not only did he have the little package that he had become kinda obsessed with, but Eric&#39;s body was so light and easy to be in. He felt more carefree, able to play and act out if he wanted to.<br />
<br />
Maybe ... this was where a kid like him belonged?<br />
<br />
Maybe.<br />
<br />
He climbed out of the pool and pattered around towards the &#39;deep&#39; end, such as it was for the children&#39;s version, before his reflection in the glass of the building&#39;s side wall a short distance away caught his eye. Soaking wet, a short slender Latino boy, eleven years old stared back at him, black hair plastered to his head, the colourful mosaic of his swim shorts sticking just as close to his skinny legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; One of the other boys called to him on the way by, talking quickly like he had ADHD. &quot;I&#39;m Scotty. Are you gonna jump in too? I wanna make a HUGE splash! What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Eric.&quot; He replied without even thinking, and the moment the words left his mouth, he knew it didn&#39;t feel right, and it dawned on him right then.<br />
<br />
This was fun. He was having a good time.<br />
<br />
But ... this wasn&#39;t really what he wanted. He didn&#39;t want to stay like this.<br />
<br />
No, his name was Ethan and he was seventeen, and he didn&#39;t want to give that up.<br />
<br />
What he did want though -- for the day at least -- was to do whatever he felt like in Eric&#39;s body. Just as he knew Eric would in his, despite the promises to take care.<br />
<br />
For him, that didn&#39;t mean spending all his time with grade schoolers doing children&#39;s stuff. He was gonna find a pool that was bigger, deeper, and had people older than him swimming in it.<br />
<br />
People he could have fun with, maybe even mess with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Hey Eric! Hey!&quot; The other kid was shimmying back and forth rapidly on the spot, full of hyperactive energy. &quot;Jump in with me at the same time! Let&#39;s go! Let&#39;s go! Come on!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Scotty.&quot; Ethan called as he trotted away, waving behind him as he turned to make tracks towards where the teens and adults were. &quot;Changed my mind. Got somewhere else to be! You have fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Perhaps he could see what games the teens were up to.<br />
<br />
Maybe even outsmart them?<br />
<br />
&quot;After all,&quot; Ethan thought as he approached the larger pools, the children&#39;s section now behind him both literally and figuratively, &quot;my body might be eleven, but my brain is seventeen. If they try me, I could make some of those asshole freshmen look REALLY stupid.&quot;</p>
