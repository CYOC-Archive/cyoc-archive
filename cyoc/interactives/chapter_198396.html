<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim blinked several times. He was now holding the hand of Destiny in Jennifer’s life. They walked by the store and Tim caught a glance of the male employee going about his day as if nothing happened. Tim could not see Jennifer in Destiny’s life anymore but Destiny was dragging him along. The smoothie placed closed soon and she was in a hurry. Tim assumed that no harm could come from leaving her to work as Destiny for a bit. It’s not like she would mind. At that moment, Tim thought about Jennifer just existing as a college aged teen working at a department store and that Brazilian girl that he swapped. Immediately, Tim collided with Destiny as she abruptly stopped.<br />
<br />
They almost walked right by the door of the smoothie place. It wasn’t very big. Destiny eagerly opened the door with her had full of the Lululemon tote and her purse. Behind the counter was a small woman in her mid twenties. She had long hair in dreads and sported a white tank top with a yellow flannel over it. She also had on very baggy jeans and a yellow headband to hold her dreads back. She was also wearing dingy sandals that could fall apart any day. <br />
<br />
As the girl opened her mouth to ask how she can help, the odor of weed just hit us like a car hitting a tree. While Destiny was staring at the menu, Tim said he wasn’t going to get anything, handed her the credit card, and walked over to the closest table. Tim noticed the underneath of the table had not been swept for weeks. <br />
<br />
While playing with the device, Tim selected 3 with the hour hand and decided if he was going to test it on anyone, it would be Destiny in Jennifer’s body. As he clicked the button he looked up to see a strange sight. The woman behind the counter was now wearing the business attire similar to Destiny’s except now yellow like her original shirt. She now wore white dress pants and heels. Her hair was curled and styled like Destiny’s business look. <br />
<br />
Destiny turned around to walk to the table and Tim was shocked. Destiny now had long dreadlocks similar to the girl behind the counter and pulled back with a green headband. She now wore a white tank top with a green flannel over it, baggy/holes jeans and sandals that could disintegrate any day. You could tell she was no longer clean and could see dirt piling between her hand and toe nails. When she got close, you could smell faint odors of weed. The girl behind the counter adjusted her shirt collar and began to prep the drink. Destiny sat down and looked like she didn’t have a care in the world. She leaned over and said, “do you think I could vape in here?” Tim shook his head no but Destiny took subtle hits from it anyway. <br />
<br />
When the woman finished making the drink, she asked if we minded taking it outside. She was closing soon anyway but she had a ton of cleaning to do before tomorrow. Tim thought about changing their personalities back but thought he’d do the girl a favor for now so she could get her store clean. <br />
<br />
As they continued down the street, they stopped in a few shops and Tim made sublet changes. He swapped a family of 4 roles so the daughter was the mom, son was the dad, and vice versa. He swapped memories between two girls and watched them stand up and switch boyfriends. He swapped a pregnancy from one woman to another. He even found another stoner to swap his personalities with so they could enjoy each other more. The guy who took Tim’s personality immediately went to his car which morphed from an old Toyota Camry to a newer Nissan Pathfinder to fit his new personality. <br />
<br />
Tim noticed the sun was going down and realized it was time to go back and put Destiny back in her life. Tim asked Destiny to wait outside. As Tim made it back to Lulu, it was mostly dead and they were cleaning up the showroom. Tim quickly surveyed the room for Jennifer in Destiny’s body but had no luck. Tim immediately went to the closest worker and asked if Destiny was still there. “No one named Destiny works at this location.” The girl said. “Oh yeah, I have Destiny” Tim thought. “I’m sorry, I meant to say Jennifer” he followed. “I don’t think we have a Jennifer either.” Tim’s  face sunk. The girl said “well let me check, I’m pretty new. Hey Jossana, do you know if a Jennifer works here?” Tim immediately froze in shock. Standing in the life of Destiny was now the Brazilian girl from earlier. She was shaking to signal a Jennifer didn’t work there. Tim walked out feeling defeated he tried willing the watch by focusing on her but it wasn’t working. He tried to will his own personality and Destiny’s back but they were too far removed from the original swap for him to do it without seeing them. Tim felt his new personality really needed to smoke so he grabbed Destiny and walked back to his SUV.<br />
<br />
When Tim pulled out the keys in his pocket, he realized the keys were no longer to his Nissan SUV. He also realized his keys didn’t have a fob to remotely unlock but rather just an ignition key. His SUV was push to start. He could see his SUV still sitting there and he decided to try the handle. The moment he touched the we hi or is instantly morphed into an old Toyota Camry. The new key fit it perfectly and he opened the door. He got in to start the car and heard the engine failing to turn on. “Great. Now I have a beat up car that won’t work, a weed addiction, and I can’t get back into my old live. Destiny in his wife’s life stopped inhaling a moment to say “Well if you want to change it, change it.” <br />
<br />
At that moment Tim had a realization and jumped out of the car, he quickly grabbed Destiny and headed back to the crowd looking for a personality to borrow.</p>
