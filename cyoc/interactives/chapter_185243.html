<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Coming back home early from school was a nice way to get more time to test the journal. On the way in his house, Jason&#39;s mom was watching Hell&#39;s Kitchen before noticing him getting home early. &quot;Jason? What are you doing home? Your not skipping are you?&quot; She asked with a stern look. &quot;No. Everyone got sent home because...&quot; Jason was looking for a way to make this not sound like a ridiculous excuse to skip school. &quot;Some students... Turned into pigs...&quot; Jason&#39;s mom did not look happy at the response. &quot;This is a new low even for you!&quot; She said almost yelling as loudly as Gordan Ramsey on the TV. &quot;Hey, call them for yourself and see if I&#39;m lying.&quot; Jason picked up the phone off the counter next to him and handed it to her. She gave him a suspicious look as she dialed the number. &quot;Hello? Yes. This is Mrs. Tanner. My son is telling me everyone got sent home because-&quot; She was immediately cut off by the person on the phone. &quot;Oh!? Really!? But how? That doesn&#39;t just-&quot; More rambling could be heard from the other line. &quot;Your twelth call today? I&#39;m sorry. I just would&#39;ve never thought... Right. Sorry to bother you.&quot; She hung up the phone. &quot;Well, I never think of all excuses, this would be the one that was the truth.&quot; Jason&#39;s mom went ahead and shut the tv off. &quot;I&#39;m gonna lay down. I think I&#39;ve heard enough crazy for one day.&quot; She says slumping to her bedroom.<br />
<br />
With that taken care of, Jason went to his room to brainstorm ideas of how to test the journal. He thought about using himself as a test to not cause commotion like back at the school. He wondered how he would go about it though. The journal in theory could make anything happen. He opened a random page and placed it on his desk to see if anything came to mind. He took a drink out of his water bottle containing the mascot of his school, a muscular tiger. &quot;Hm...&quot; He stared at the tiger on the bottle. &quot;Let&#39;s try that.&quot; He picked his pen out from his pocket and started to write.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason was testing if the effects of the notebook would work, and came up with inspiration from the school mascot, Tyler the Tiger.&quot; Jason thought it weird to write about himself never mind in third person. &quot;So upon looking at the tiger, he starts to gain some muscle mass to match the build of him. While at it, his face slowly morphed into the tigers head.&quot; Jason tried to keep writing but was suddenly focused on the tiger on the bottle. This gave him the impression that the journal might be the real deal before anything else happened. Suddenly his body felt intense as if he had to exert pressure. &quot;Ugh... What&#39;s this feeling...&quot; Jason&#39;s body started to inflate as his pecs started poking out his t-shirt and his neck started to thicken. &quot;No fucking way...&quot; Along with his arms and legs growing toned and ripped, he felt his head starting change. He could feel his face growing whiskers and his nose turning from pale to pink with the addition of white fur spreading across his jaw. His upper lip started to curl up to reach his nose giving it the feline shape. &quot;Woah...&quot; He reached out to feel his leathery nose and furry mouth as his lips pushed out from his face, spread wider across his face and his teeth turned to fangs. Jason felt fur spreading all across his head which now transition from white to orange with black stripes. Jason felt the fur cover his ears as they moved slowly from the side of his head to the top while becoming a round shape. The fur spread all the way up to his forehead where the fur stopped at his hairline. The last thing to happen was so intense that Jason needed to close his eyes for. His head went through a minor phase before it calmed down. He opened his eyes revealing to have much keener eyesight without knowing his eyes change from a green to a golden brow with his pupils turning to slits.<br />
<br />
I gotta find a mirror! Jason went to the bathroom next to his room to see how the changes progressed. He couldn&#39;t believe it. His head looked just like that of a tiger minus his human hair he retained and the eyes looking a bit bigger for the cartoon style the school went with. &quot;My head... it looks just like Tony the tiger!&quot; He opened his mouth to reveal sharp fangs and a long flat tongue rolling out. As well as he was looking more toned and muscular than before. He flexed a bit looking at how his muscles bulged against his clothes. &quot;I can&#39;t stop right there! I gotta see this thing through!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason dashed back to his desk and counties his writing. &quot;Excited to take the rest of the tigers form, the fur spread all over Jason&#39;s body. His hands and feet turning into powerful tiger paws, and a long tiger tail ripping out of his pants.&quot; Jason felt a tingling feeling through his whole body as he stood up to watch his body change. He looked to see that the fur was spreading downward his thick neck with a nice orang black and white fur pattern. He flexed his arms as fur came out from the shirt spreading to his hands. He held a death grip on his desk as his nails sharpen into claws and his fingers started getting thicker as pads as pink as his nose started growing on the palms and fingers. In a slight inconvenient way, his middle fingers and index started to merge together making him have four fingered paws instead of five for obvious reasons. The same happened to his legs as fur spread across to his feet and started to take on a digigrade shape. He felt the pads growing on his feet and toes as they also sharpened into claws. Finally, he felt something start to push against the back of his pants as a long striped tail about three feet long with a white tip ripped out his backside lashing madly. Jason felt chills up his spine as he felt the base.<br />
<br />
Jason stood at his desk panting hard like an animal. He leaned up from his desk to see himself standing on two digigrade paws. &quot;Mirror!&quot; He shouted and came running to the bathroom again. What appears in the reflection was not him exactly, but the school mascot, Tyler the Tiger stood high and proud (with the added addition of Jason&#39;s hair). &quot;Holy shit... That&#39;s actually me...&quot; Jason couldn&#39;t help but flex in all sorts of sexy poses with his arms pushing against his pecs, to turning around and flexing out over his head to see his toned back. Looking from behind him, he sees his tail still lashing off his firm butt. The tail was a whole nother thing to experience since he didn&#39;t have one before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason, I just got off the phone with your father...&quot; Jason suddenly realized his mom was still home. And she&#39;s going to see her son as a large tiger man flexing in the bathroom after hearing about two girls being turned to pigs at school... (Try putting a sentence like that into context). It was already to late to do anything as the bathroom door opened. &quot;He said he wants your help tomorrow with- AHHHH!&quot; With a shriek of terror Jason&#39;s mother collapsed to the floor rendering her unconscious. &quot;Oh God! Mom!&quot; He had no idea she&#39;d faint. Then again there was basically a scary looking exotic animal in close proximity to her. &quot;Shit shit shit! What do I tell her when she...&quot; But in his rambling, Jason might have thought of a solution.<br />
<br />
Going back to his journal, he&#39;d write despite the difficulty holding the pen with his paw, to make the transformation normal to others. &quot;Now with Jason&#39;s transformation complete, everyone excepts him as the sexy tiger he was, and nobody bats an eye and treats him as normal.&quot; Jason pushed his clawed fingers to his forehead. &quot;Hopefully that works.&quot; Within a few minutes Jason knelt over to see his mother gain conscious. &quot;Mom, are you alright?&quot; Her blurry vision saw a big tiger in her view, and that could only mean it was her son. &quot;Uh... I&#39;m fine. What happened? Why was I out?&quot; She asked sitting up rubbing her head. &quot;Uh...&quot; Jason quickly grabbed a bar of soap from the bath. &quot;...you slipped on this on the way in.&quot; Jason lied. &quot;Oh... I could have sworn it was an animal of some sort...&quot; She looked at Jason. &quot;Not... Not that you scared me... But you do have big fangs...&quot; Jason sighed. Crisis averted. &quot;Anyway... Your father wanted some help on the 1997 Chrysler tomorrow.&quot; Jason sighed. But if he wanted a car of his own, his dad said to earn it. &quot;Alright... You need help getting back to bed? You might want to rest after that spill.&quot; His mom got up brushing herself off. &quot;Thank you. But I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; She says walking out the bathroom rubbing her head.<br />
<br />
Jason walked back into his room and jumped to lay on his bed. &quot;So I just convinced the whole world that I&#39;m a tiger man, and people just except it? Amazing.&quot; Jason said looking at his defined tiger paws moving them like his own human hands (despite one missing finger). He ripped his pawed feet feeling his paw pads rubbing together, and his tail which felt so unnatural but satisfying to stroke. &quot;I can change the rules of the world with that thing.&quot; He looked over at his journal and thought about what else he could possibly do before his lazy tiger instincts took over and he drifted to sleep.</p>
