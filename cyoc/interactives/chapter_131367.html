<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tad eventually did make it back home after his talk with Amy... and their late evening &quot;fun,&quot; which he could hear that Amy&#39;s parents were ALSO having in their room when he left the Howler house. He remained in his fursona, as it was night and the street was off the main north-south and east-west roads through Moon Lake, so he felt safe and made it back home to hear mewing purrs of passion coming out of mom&#39;s room. In this, he knew she was happy and knew that when his father was alive that his parents were very active together, even if they couldn&#39;t transform because a werewolf&#39;s howl might be heard in the other homes on the Marine Corps bases that the Decker family had been on. So it wasn&#39;t as if he didn&#39;t know what sex was, and while his mother being with Claire was not the specific thing he was used to, he was honestly glad that his mother seemed to look happier now.<br />
<br />
But, it was a Tuesday night and he had school the next day, so he made his way as quietly as he could to his bedroom and was soon asleep. His mom finally ran out of sexual energy shortly before Tad truly fell asleep. And they would all be up early the next day. Wednesday was a school day, which would mean Tad had school and that Claire had work. They soon gathered around the smaller breakfast table as they began their day.<br />
<br />
&quot;How goes your job hunt, mom?&quot; Tad asked, &quot;Didn&#39;t you say you have some interviews coming up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think there is one this afternoon, with Tachibana Industries,&quot; Jen answered, remembering some of the calls she&#39;d gotten for interviews concerning applications she&#39;d sent in to various jobs. They weren&#39;t the most glamorous ones, but they were ones she could do and ones she had done, at least part time, while she and Jeff moved between bases. Though most of them weren&#39;t scheduled until Friday at the earliest. &quot;The biggest thing this morning will be my next session with Doctor Twist.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad slowly nodded, remembering the grief counseling session that his mother had pulled him into after they first moved into to Moon Lake. At that time, he knew his mother was heavily grieving for his father&#39;s death, which made sense as he missed his dad, too, though, at present with his mom looking happier with Claire around, he wasn&#39;t quite as sure. Maybe there was something that related to issues on things being &quot;too fast&quot; or something like that, but he couldn&#39;t be sure, as he really didn&#39;t know much on psychology.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this...?&quot; Claire asked as she ate from her bowl of cereal.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is grief counseling,&quot; Jen nodded, &quot;I loved Jeff Decker very much... he was my everything and Tad&#39;s father. And in a way... having him gone... it does still hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Claire said looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be, you&#39;ve made mom happy again,&quot; Tad spoke up, actually surprising Jen, but Jen did smile at Tad&#39;s acceptance of her taking a new lover. That was one of the things that Jen worried over, as while she and Jeff had taught Tad to be VERY accepting of homosexuals and bisexuals, as all werecats and werewildcats were at least bi if not homosexual, Jen also knew that there was the potential that Tad might not accept Claire in defense of his father, which was a very different thing from accepting that his mother liked women as much as she liked men.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Claire gave a weak smile to Tad, though she was unsure on how to really operate around him. While yes she could technically count as a &quot;step-mom&quot; if and when she and Jen get married, she also knew that Tad was already eighteen and a Senior in high school. Legally speaking Tad could leave the home if he wanted to, and she knew that some did. Though, Tad might end up staying at home while he went through college to further his education, which she knew a lot of people did too, but that was more by agreement than by law. In that, Claire didn&#39;t want to do anything that would come off as trying to &quot;parent&quot; Tad, that was Jen&#39;s job, though some of Claire&#39;s thoughts did see Tad as a potential friend. She then turned back to Jen, &quot;Will you want me to come? I can get some time off if you need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re job won&#39;t...&quot; Jen began.<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as I let them know, I can take some days and time off,&quot; Claire answered, &quot;and if it&#39;s only for an hour or two to be there for a therapy session... it&#39;ll be fine. So... if you want me there... or need me there, I&#39;ll take the time off to be there for you. Even if I weren&#39;t falling madly in love with you... the fact that you were willing to turn me into a werecat, something I&#39;ve wanted ever since Samantha Twist showed me it was possible... I owe you for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jen answered, &quot;I suppose it couldn&#39;t hurt... as technically speaking you&#39;ll be part of their pride now. Might as well let you meet Frances as the new you.&quot;<br />
<br />
That then followed with Jen providing Claire with when her appointment was, and Claire promised to be there.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Jen did ultimately make it outside Doctor Twist&#39;s clinic on time and soon found Claire walking up the street toward her. She guessed that Claire had been &quot;exploring&quot; and had only just found where the psychology clinic was. They did hug and purred to each other while they were in their human form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for coming,&quot; Jen said softly. She still had her issues to worry over and wanted to make sure that Frances and Samantha would be okay with Claire, and having Claire there would be a big thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything for you,&quot; Claire purred back and then moved to open the door.<br />
<br />
Jen smiled and walked in, finding Rudy seated behind his desk as she entered. He looked up to Jen and nodded and then blinked as Claire came up beside Jen. He offered the sign in sheet to Jen and then looked to Claire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you miss?&quot; Rudy said politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here to go with my mate and be there for her,&quot; Claire said slowly, &quot;If that&#39;s okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; Rudy gave a small frown and pulled his lips back before turning in his chair and then pressing an intercom button, &quot;Doctor Twist, Mrs. Decker is here... and she... she... uh... has a &quot;guest&quot; with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A guest?&quot; came Frances&#39;s voice over the intercom, &quot;I&#39;ll be right out...&quot;<br />
<br />
A few moments later, Moon Lake&#39;s therapist came out and glanced to Jen and then saw Claire, who waived hello. Frances gave a few short sniffs which was enough to confirm that Jen had gone through with transforming Claire after the Halloween Dance. There was nothing legally wrong with that, as Samantha had told her enough in private that Claire Jacobs had practically begged Samantha to turn her after Samantha gave the rundown on Moon Lake&#39;s laws and they had reminded Claire that becoming a werecat would likely change her sexuality at the Halloween dance, which still didn&#39;t deter Claire from wanting to be a werecat. Actually turning her might have been a bit beyond the norms, as most werecats and werewildcats were pretty careful to make sure that if they were to turn someone that that person was already bisexual or homosexual, which would lower the chances of the Normal&#39;s sexuality being affected by the change, but that didn&#39;t mean it couldn&#39;t happen if the transformation was still willing. Though, Frances didn&#39;t expect to find Claire still with Jen and looking to Jen like the way she looked to Samantha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Frances,&quot; Jen spoke, &quot;I kinda brought Claire with me if that&#39;s okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose... though, these sessions are between you and me,&quot; Frances spoke, &quot;and maybe Tad, as I&#39;m sure there is plenty he may wish to talk over if he wants to... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; Jen spoke, taking Claire by the arm.<br />
<br />
Frances noticed and nodded and then stepped back, and extended an arm into her office, &quot;Okay then...&quot; She assumed that Claire had become at least bisexual and had to be involved with Jen, which wasn&#39;t exactly unheard of. It was surprising, but not unheard of. Their relationship being serious now wasn&#39;t even unheard of. She remembered one story that went back to when she and Samantha were in college. There a Normal and a Werecat ended up in the same dorm room, likely as a test of independence that would come along with living in the dorms. The Normal was straight but got along with her roommate well enough, though they then had an accident where a pillow fight or some other game got the Normal clawed and eventually turning into a Werecat as well. If Frances remembered correctly, the new werecat married the one who accidentally clawed her.<br />
<br />
Claire and Jen smiled and then walked in.  Frances held the door for them and then nodded to Rudy to let him know that she was now in a session and anyone who came in would have to wait.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how are we doing?&quot; Frances asked, &quot;both of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;ve been doing better,&quot; Jen said happily as she moved to sit on the couch and smiled as Claire sat down beside her, &quot;Jeff&#39;s murderer was brought to justice Claire has proven to be very special.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You like her?&quot; Frances asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way I haven&#39;t felt... since... since Jeff,&quot; Jen nodded.<br />
<br />
That again confirmed to Frances that there had to be some relationship there. It wasn&#39;t exactly typical, given that Claire had been straight when she was a normal, but it wasn&#39;t entirely unheard of. Frances then turned to Claire as Claire sat down beside Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how are you doing now, Claire?&quot; Frances asked, &quot;Is being a werecat everything you imagined?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s different from what I thought,&quot; Claire spoke, &quot;I mean... I&#39;m a complete lesbian now... and I suppose when I tell my folks I&#39;ll have to tell them that I&#39;d been hiding and denying it and that you helped with that... but it&#39;s not a bad thing. It&#39;s everything I&#39;ve wanted, to be cute and fluffy and adorable like any housecat is. And I do like it and I don&#39;t understand why most werecats I met always wanted me to find some other were...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t want to make you uncomfortable or lead to any frustration resulting from your change changing your sexual orientation,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;I was already a lesbian when Samantha brought me into were society and most other normal women are also already lesbians or at least bisexual which would mean the transformation isn&#39;t likely to change their orientation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That stuff I didn&#39;t mind... and Jen&#39;s been quite good to me,&quot; Claire answered, &quot;and to be able to become a cat... or... an anthropomorphic cat... I don&#39;t care what my sexuality becomes... and in that... I&#39;m happy with Jen and I want to be there for her for her everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... she was a good friend to Samantha and I when we went through college, so if you can keep her, you&#39;ve found a good woman to have as your mate,&quot; Frances spoke and then looked to Jen, &quot;Now... Jen... when we were last here, we were discussing your sadness at Jeff&#39;s murder and that you wanted his killer brought to justice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded, remembering having Tad there for that session, &quot;Yes. And his killer WAS brought to justice, so... I&#39;m glad that Jeff wasn&#39;t murdered and his soul given no peace. I still wish he was here... but I am glad that his killer was brought to justice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances watched as Jen looked to Claire. The two of them held hands for a moment with Claire giving Jen&#39;s hands an assuring squeeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;And finding Claire has helped in its own way,&quot; Jen began to say slowly, &quot;though... it too has things that... that I&#39;d have to admit are worrying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Such as?&quot; Frances asked she observed Claire&#39;s reactions to what Jen said, reminding Frances of Samantha whenever they were together in that Samantha often tried to protect her and she did the same with Samantha. It hinted at there being real love between them and Frances jotted down her notes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... some of it is that meeting Claire was unexpected,&quot; Jen spoke as she looked down and then to Claire, &quot;You and Samantha took me to the dance to get me out of the house and adapt to being back in Moon Lake again. So... turning a normal who wanted to be a werecat wasn&#39;t exactly on my agenda... and it probably wasn&#39;t on yours either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t,&quot; Frances admitted, &quot;but it does look like it has turned out quite well. Claire&#39;s transformation was willing and you two do look happy together...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded, &quot;Yes, but it&#39;s also faster than I expected. And... well... there are times when I feel that maybe I&#39;m rushing things... being disloyal to Jeff and then others when I know that Jeff would want me to be happy and move on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how has Tad responded to the development between you two?&quot; Frances asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s been polite to me,&quot; Claire spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s been quite supportive,&quot; Jen answered, &quot;Which is nice... but it doesn&#39;t change the possibility that things are going too fast. That I&#39;m rushing things... I don&#39;t want to make it seem as though I&#39;m betraying Jeff&#39;s memory.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen have a small smile as she felt Claire softly touch her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;But would Jeff disapprove of Claire?&quot; Frances asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... in fact like many male weres that had a bisexual wife, he was quite open to an open relationship,&quot; Jen answered, &quot;though the number of times when we were able to indulge in that was fairly rare and was something that happened more by chance than anything else... But he had no problem with me indulging my bi side. But that was with the knowledge that I would always return to him and him only. Now... now I&#39;m starting to get those same feelings for Claire, and its why I&#39;m...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Conflicted?&quot; Frances offered.<br />
<br />
To that Jen nodded and felt Claire cuddle against her. She watched as Jen wrote down some notes before she looked up to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of your conflict is fairly typical, Jen,&quot; Frances said slowly, &quot;You loved Jeff and he was a good man. And while werewolves and werecats don&#39;t have the sort of absolute certainty that weremers and werefoxes can have when they either see their &quot;one true love&quot; or feel that emotional &quot;bond&quot; form between the pair... that doesn&#39;t mean that the bonds that form between other weres is any less real. In that because Jeff was a good man and because Tad is still with you... and in many ways looks a lot like his father... there is that sort of reminder...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I love Tad as a MOTHER not as a lover,&quot; Jen insisted.<br />
<br />
Frances nodded, &quot;Yes, but that&#39;s still a sort of reminder of your time with Jeff. In that, Jen, it may be best to talk with Tad privately. As while he may have voiced support for you and Claire... the fact that he does look like his father might be enough to give you some subconscious worry... Especially if there is anything that in the back of his mind is uneasy in anyway with this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But he&#39;s never been mean to me!&quot; Claire pointed out, &quot;and he&#39;s seemed happy that his mom is happy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which could well mean that he is accepting of the two of you being together,&quot; Frances nodded, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s instantly accepted the union without his own private reservations. After all, Claire...  suppose you had a daughter before Jen turned you and she knew you were straight and new her father and knew that her father loved her and you. Do you think that she would suddenly become okay with your sexuality as it is now? Particularly if it means that her father is no longer desirable to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... no.... but...&quot; Claire fumbled through her answer looking for some way to assure Jen that everything would be okay.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is my point,&quot; Frances spoke, &quot;Tad may accept that the two of you are together and is happy that you are happy. From what I could see, that&#39;s probably the case as he seemed to be a good kid. However, your union is a big change in his life, one that is on par with the loss of his father. And that is something that for most people, regardless of whether or not they need therapy, would need some time to adjust to. Especially if his relationship with his father was loving... as he adjusts to your new family arrangement, there will be some signs of that sort of adjustment to the change... and as a loving mother, Jen will be more likely to pick up on them more than you are Claire... As Jen has known Tad longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... this is just something to talk through it with Tad?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That could well help in the sense of understanding that Jeff would want you to move on and be happy,&quot; Frances agreed, &quot;and it may take some time... but unless you have any other reason why you might think your relationship with Claire is going too fast...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... maybe it&#39;s the fact that since Halloween and my turning her... we&#39;ve been seeing each other and we helped her move in yesterday,&quot; Jen answered, &quot;but then...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s pretty common with any were couple,&quot; Frances nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is?&quot; Claire asked as she looked between Jen and Frances.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s something that relates to our higher libido,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;since we&#39;re more easily turned on... courtship among weres tends to go faster than it does in most cases for normal human society. In some cases, it leads to true love and romance and is something fits in well with a storybook... and even in most of the cases where it doesn&#39;t lead to marriage and romance, the pair do enjoy each other and stay together for sex as &quot;friends with benefits&quot; but begin looking for other possible mates. It&#39;s pretty rare where things burn to the point of there being a problem... though it IS a possibility. The thing for right now is for both of you to let it progress naturally and let it feel right when you make your decisions... be it for marriage or anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything I can do to help Jen stay happy? Feel confident with me?&quot; Claire asked, &quot;I don&#39;t want to replace her husband in her heart. From what she&#39;s told me... he sounded like a pretty nice guy... and before now... I might have had interest in him too if I&#39;d been able to meet him. I don&#39;t want Jen to feel like she has to forget him or anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There, you can just be there for Jen and talk with her,&quot; Frances instructed, &quot;maybe find where you and Jeff might have had things in common... getting along with Tad could probably also help. The big thing is remain calm and patient... and this will go for both of you.&quot;</p>
