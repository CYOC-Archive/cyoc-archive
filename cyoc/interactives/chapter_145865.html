<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What do you think of the room?&quot; Lisa asked his 14 years old son.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s really nice! But isn&#39;t it too expensive? We decided to don&#39;t spend too much money after your divorce.&quot; Billy replied a little bit worried.<br />
<br />
Lisa spent a lot if money and energy in her divorce. His stupid ex husband had too much debts that she ended up spending more than she expected to get divorced from that moron. However, she was grateful that his son supported her all the time, he helped her a lot, way more than his useless ex husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s late, what do you think if we unpack and then we go to eat something.&quot; Lisa said while she started to unpack in her bed. &quot;Tomorrow we can do a lot more of things, don&#39;t you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It sounds good to me.&quot; Billy said while he started to unpack in another bedroom. &quot;Mom.. I was curious, what&#39;s that Wings thing about? I heard you choose the Age Wing. What&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa remember that she had forgot to tell her son about the hotel&#39;s magical properties. She could tell him now, but she thought it would be more fun if he discovered it through a change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing in particular.&quot; Lisa told him. &quot;They&#39;re thematic stuff like in Disneyland.&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy trusted in his mother&#39;s words and he didn&#39;t make any more questions. When they finished unpacking, they went to a restaurant near the main pool and order their meal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that pool looks awesome!&quot; Billy said while they waited for their food.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can go in if you want. I know how much you like swimming.&quot; Lisa smiled at her son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? But we agreed to sleep today and explore tomorrow.&quot; Billy told his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; Lisa smiled. &quot;I&#39;m a little tired but I know you still have energy. I&#39;ll go back to our room to sleep and you can stay there for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thanks mom!&quot; Billy smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll go quickly for my swimwear.&quot; He ran to their room and after a moment he came back wearing a blue speedo. Lisa didn&#39;t like to think too much about it but she thought that his son was really handsome. However, while she was staring at him, she noticed that under his arms he has really hairy armpits and she sighed at the idea that his kid was turning into a man. That&#39;s when she got an idea.<br />
<br />
After finishing their meal, Lisa returned to their room while Billy stayed in the pool. She quickly fell asleep and she didn&#39;t know when her son came back to their room to sleep. He was so tired of swimming and playing in the water that he fell deeply asleep almost immediately, forgetting to wear his pajamas and sleeping in his speedo.<br />
<br />
Lisa woke up passed midnight. She felt a little dizzy and went for some water. In her way, she noticed her that her son was sleeping wearing just his speedo and she remembered his little idea from before. She sneaked into his bedroom and realized that he was snoring a little, he looked really tired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, he hasn&#39;t grown hair just in his armpits.&quot; She said while she stared at the few pubes that protrude from his speedo. His bulge was also decent looking. She hadn&#39;t paid any attention to it since he stopped wearing diapers and now it looked completely different from then.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, let&#39;s see if this hotel is really magical.&quot; She said before she focused on making her son grow. At first it seemed that nothing was happening until she noticed that Billy&#39;s chest was growing a few hairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s working!&quot; Lisa grinned when she noticed that Billy&#39;s legs were getting longer and stronger. His speedo was tightening because of the beefier legs he was getting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must take it off.&quot; Lisa thought but when she touched the blue fabric Billy let out a little moan and she immediately realized that he was getting an erection. She felt bad for doing this to her son and she decided to at least keep his speedo on as long as it can contain his growing boyhood.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Billy was quickly getting height and weight. His arms and legs looked looked beefy with big hands and feet to match.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will need new shoes.&quot; Lisa said while she wiggled her son&#39;s bigger toes. &quot;You won&#39;t have any problem to join the swimming team with those feet!&quot;<br />
<br />
His body had stopped stretching everywhere and muscles were starting to develop. His biceps, abs and pecs were way more noticeable while his thighs and calves were getting so big that his speedo looked more like a poser at that moment.<br />
<br />
The curly hairs on his legs began to thicken while they moved inside the tiny clothing. The pubic forest on his crotch was so thick that it wasn&#39;t inside the speedo anymore and it kept their way upward through his thick treasure trail until it connected with the hair on his chest and around his small but manly nipples. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re getting hairy like your dummy daddy&quot; Lisa grinned while she put her fingers on the pelt in his chest. &quot;He has hair in his ass too. I wonder if you... Yep, you&#39;re going to need an electric razor if you want to keep on competitive swimming&quot;<br />
<br />
However, hair isn&#39;t the only thing that grew in his ass. His butt cheeks  had pumped like a balloon into a perfect bubble butt, so big and juicy that it ended up tearing his speedo off. His rock-hard dick immediately jumped up and Lisa felt ashamed of looking at her son&#39;s boner. She hid her face with her hands, but she was too curious to see how big it had got. She felt funny while she stared at the 8 inches banana that her son had developed from the 1 inch baby dick she reminded. It looked fat and meaty, hairy and veiny. With big and hairy balls big hanging low to match it. Then, she remembered that she hadn&#39;t sex in a while and although she was a little disgusted by the idea, she wondered how Billy would be on the bed.<br />
<br />
Billy&#39;s growth was finishing as he was just still growing in the muscle department. Thick legs and brawny arms that matched his broad shoulders and juicy pecs. He involuntary flexed his arms showing his newly grown muscles and two really messy armpits, by the way. Finally, a subtle shade appeared on his face, as his jaw get squarer and more pronounced.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a man now!&quot; Lisa said while she stared at the naked man sleeping where her teenager son was sleeping a moment ago. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to see your reaction in the morning!&quot;<br />
<br />
She wiggled his toes once again and he moaned again now in a deeper voice. &quot;He must be so horny right now. All that growth must be so arousing.&quot; She glanced at his erection one last time and she giggled when she noticed precum dripping from his swollen dick tip.</p>
