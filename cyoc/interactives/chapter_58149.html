<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Connor looked around the beach, looking for a target to transform into. He saw a surfer boy, about 18 years old. He had blond hair, blue eyes and a handsome face. He had a muscular body, with a healthy tan. Connor wanted to become the boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to become that surfer boy over there.&quot; said Connor, pointing to the boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot; said Ryan. &quot;Once you've changed, come back and me and Jeremy will transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; said Connor.<br />
<br />
Connor walked along the beach, approaching the surfer boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paul Daniels. Is that really you?&quot; Connor said to the boy, patting him on the back. The boy turned around.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, my name is Josh.&quot; said the boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; said Connor. &quot;Sorry, my mistake.&quot; Connor walked over to the washrooms. He had the tingling feeling.<br />
<br />
Connor walked inside the Men's Building, walking into a stall and locking the door. <br />
<br />
Connor groaned with pleasure as he felt the transformation begin. Connor's short brown hair began to lengthen, turning blond. His legs began to extend, Connor's body stretching upwards as he grew taller. Connor looked down at his member and watched it grow bigger, 3 inches bigger. His testicles swelled to match his penis.<br />
<br />
Connor's shoulders expanded, thickening with muscle. His arms began to swell as well, layers of muscle adding to Connor's arms. His spine cracked as it extended. His back also bulked up. Connor's nipples darkened, and grew slightly larger. His pecs defined themselves more, and Connor groaned again as his pecs began to darken to match Josh's tan. Connor's abs suddenly formed, becoming a six-pack. They defined more to match Josh's. They looked amazing, the result of extensive workouts. His back arched as his spine shot upwards an inch or two. The skin on his back tanned.<br />
<br />
Connor's blond hair finished growing, and his ears flattened towards his head. Connor's brown eyes changed to blue, and his nose re-shaped itself to match Josh's. His jaw protruded, giving him Josh's handsome face. Connor looked down and groaned as his feet cracked, growing three sizes larger, skin darkening as his feet tanned. Connor's ass formed into a bubble butt. Connor's legs tanned. His face darkened as well. His pecs pushed out more, completing the transformation. Connor had become Josh, the surfer boy. Connor bent over to put his swimsuit on, and realized that it was now too small for his body.<br />
<br />
Connor panicked for a moment, and then realized that the swimsuit was heavier than he remembered it being. He picked it up again and took out his cell phone from the swimsuit pocket. Connor sighed with relief. He called Ryan's cell.<br />
<br />
Ryan's phone started ringing. Ryan picked it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; said Ryan. &quot;Who is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's me.&quot; said Connor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, I think you have the wrong number.&quot; said Ryan.<br />
<br />
Connor realized that his voice had changed to that of a Californian Surfer.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Connor.&quot; said Connor, as Josh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; said Ryan. &quot;I didn't recognize you for a second. Why are you calling? Couldn't walk all the way over here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My swimsuit doesn't fit my new body.&quot; said Connor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do you want me to do about it?&quot; asked Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking you could become my swimsuit for a moment, so I can find something that fits.&quot; said Connor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can't I just find a swimsuit for you while you wait in the bathroom?&quot; said Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's a guy waiting for my stall.&quot; said Connor. &quot;I don't think I have much time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry up in there!&quot; said the man outside Connor's stall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on!&quot; shouted Connor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Hurry.&quot; Connor said to Ryan.<br />
<br />
Ryan groaned. He walked over to Josh. Ryan tiptoed up behind Josh, and touched the waist of Josh's yellow speedo, feeling the familiar tingling sensation. Ryan turned around and ran into the washroom building. <br />
<br />
&quot;Connor?&quot; shouted Ryan. &quot;Are you in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Over here!&quot; yelled Connor, unlocking the door of his stall.<br />
<br />
Ryan ran into Connor's stall and locked the door behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; shouted the man waiting for the stall. &quot;Get In Line!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go crap in the bush.&quot; said Ryan, taking his clothes off. The man suddenly ran out of the building.<br />
<br />
&quot;You came here just in time.&quot; said Connor, as Ryan began to feel his body changing.<br />
<br />
Ryan began to shrink, until his head came up to Connor's testicles. Suddenly Ryan groaned with pleasure as he jumped up and stuffed his face into Connor's muscular crotch. Connor watched as his brothers arms wrapped around his waist. Ryan suddenly wrapped his legs between Connor's legs and stretching them out until they came up to the base on Connor's butt. Ryan groaned again as his feet cracked, stretching up and connecting with his inhumanly stretched arms, passing over Connor's ass crack and attaching to his hands which were at the top of Connor's butt.<br />
<br />
Ryan's head began to deform, his hair, ears, eyes and nose melting into his stretching head, leaving only his mouth. Ryan's teeth and lips vanished, his mouth opening wider than humanly possible, until Connor's penis and testicles fit snugly into Ryan.<br />
<br />
Ryan's arms began to widen and flatten, stretching until what had been Ryan's arms merged with Ryan's mouth, which was encasing Connor's bulge. Ryan's legs flattened and widened, forming from the base on Connor's crotch, through his legs and covering his butt up to the beginning of Connor's muscular, tanned, surfer boy legs.<br />
<br />
Connor watched as Ryan's body began to brighten, turning bright yellow. The speedo adjusted itself. Connor groaned as Ryan's inanimate body brushed his penis. The yellow speedo stopped adjusting and was still. Ryan had become Josh's speedo. Connor confidently strutted out of the washrooms, watching women (and some men) turning and staring at his hot body, as well as the large bulge in the speedo. <br />
<br />
Admittedly, Ryan kind of liked being Connor's speedo. He kind of liked being the stretchy speedo spandex material. He also liked being so close to Connor's muscular surfer body, gripping it and feeling Connor's wet, tanned skin rubbing against his inanimate form.<br />
<br />
Connor was king of the beach, but before he could enjoy himself, he had to find a swimsuit that wasn't his brother in disguise.</p>
