<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I will ask you one final time, Monica, are you really sure you want this.  Once I start this transformation, there will be no turning back.  When I&#39;m through with you, all you&#39;ll be is a diaper wearing drooling mess incapable of anything but loving your sister, who is now call Dania, playing with larger baby toys, eating soft mushy food, crawling, and pooping yourself.  Make your decision wisely, Monica, there&#39;s no turning back.&quot; said Madame Illusia.  Monica spent a couple of minutes thinking about her decision.  She knew that she was willingly destroying her life, but she couldn&#39;t bear the misery of living without her boyfriend.  Besides life had been hard for both of them.  The past three years had taken away both of their good paying jobs and replaced them with crappy dead end fast food work.  Due to the job losses, both Damon and Monica had to move into public housing in a high crime neighborhood.  They had to sell most of their possessions including their car to make ends meet.  The more she thought about it, no wonder Damon wanted to live a simple life and now she was going to live that simple life with him.....or rather her, now.  She knew that she would never have to worry about anything ever again because other people would be making decisions for her and providing everything she needs.  That sounded a lot better than struggling, and so she resigned herself to her decision.   &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll accept your transformation, but can I at least watch the transformation?&quot;, asked Monica.  &quot;Sure, but you&#39;ll need to take off all of your clothes except your underwear if you don&#39;t mind, dear&quot;, Madame Illusia replied.  While Monica stripped out of her clothes except for her panties, Stephen, Madame&#39;s stage hand, brought out a full length mirror so that Monica could watch her transformation.  &quot;Are you ready, Monica?&quot;, asked Madame Illusia.  &quot;Yes....I&#39;m ready, please do it now before I change my mind&quot;, replied Monica.  &quot;Very well, just stare into the mirror while I make some adjustments with my magic&quot;, said Madame Illusia.  And so, Monica watched the mirror.  At first there were no visible changes, but then she noticed her panties slowly turn from black to white.  She continued to watch them as they thickened out until they looked kind of like little kids training pants.  They took on even more thickness forcing Monica to spread her legs out a little bit because she could no longer stand like normal due to the bulk in her new underwear.  They then took on a plastic sheen as the sides ripped apart and formed wings with sticky tabs that stuck to either side of the front of the diaper.  Finally a medical looking design appeared on the front of her diaper.  In a small fine dot matrix font the words &quot;Small Maximum Absorbancy&quot; appeared running up from the crotch of the diaper to almost the top in a single line.  Afterwards, two yellow wetness indicator strips formed on either side of the font.  &quot;Well, Monica, how do you like your new underwear?&quot;, asked Madame Illusia.  &quot;It&#39;s so thick, I&#39;m having a hard time standing!&quot;, replied Monica.  &quot;It&#39;s a good thing, too, since it&#39;s going to double as your toilet as well.&quot;, Madame said in response.  &quot;Now we need to get you properly dressed.  We can&#39;t have you running around in just your diaper or trying to take it off, now can we?&quot;, Madame said.  &quot;No, I guess not.&quot;, mumbled Monica.  Madame then handed Monica her clothes, but they were very different from before.  Monica was handed a blue stretchy jumpsuit that had a zipper in the crotch and up her back as well as feet that had slip resistant soles.  Grimacing, Monica slipped into the garment and pulled it up her body.  Finally, she zipped up the back.  She noticed in the mirror that the jumpsuit did nothing to hide the outline of her diaper and instead actually enhanced its appearance.  When Monica was finished dressing, Madame Illusia said, &quot;We&#39;re not finished, yet.  There&#39;s a reason why you eat stage two baby food!&quot;  Monica then turned her head back to the mirror and watched as her teeth receded up into her gums.  She then watched as her beautiful black hair take on a dull and slightly unkempt look as it transformed into a short unflattering style.  Madame had another piece of clothing for Monica to put on.  It was a blue special needs helmet.  And so, Monica slipped it on without question or complaint looking forward to ending her misery.  The helmet covered her head as well as her ears and went all the way down the back of her neck to her shoulders.  Finally, Madame produced the final pieces of clothing that Monica would need to begin her new life.  Hold out your hands, Monica, I need to put on your mittens.  And without protest, Monica put her hands out so that Madame could put Monica&#39;s hands into her thick white padded mittens and secure them so that she couldn&#39;t Houdini her way out of them.  The very final piece of clothing Monica got was a large blue waterproof terry bib that Madame had placed around her neck.  The bib was so long, that it stretched down to Monica&#39;s waist.  Afterwards, Madame told Monica to sit on the stage floor. Monica sat on the stage floor as instructed, but couldn&#39;t sit cross legged due to the thickness of her diaper.  And so, Monica sat like a baby with her legs splayed facing the mirror.  With that, Madame gave Monica two more gifts to help her out with her mental transition.  In between Monica&#39;s legs  six large colored foam blocks in different shapes appeared along with seven large colorful rings in different sizes.  The smallest ring was red and had three different colored plastic balls inside it that would rattle and go around in circles if shaken.  &quot;I&#39;m sure that right now, you don&#39;t appreciate your new toys Monica, but after your mental transformation, I think you&#39;ll come to enjoy them a lot.  Speaking of which, are you ready for your mental decent into mindless bliss?  Monica sighed, &quot;Yes, I&#39;m ready.  I want to be done with this misery.&quot;  And so, Madame began shrinking Monica down into an eleven year old girl.  Monica watched as she shrank in size and got younger.  She watched as her breasts slowly shrank in size until they were almost flat.  Once finished with Monica&#39;s physical change, she began the mental changes.  Monica continued to look into the mirror.  She didn&#39;t notice anything at all.  Her bright eyes took on a dull expression as her lips started to open up a little to allow drool out.  She rocked back and forth a bit and then started to pat the mirror.  &quot;Yes, Monica, that&#39;s you!  I bet you feel so much better now without all those big complicated thoughts running through your mind!  I bet you do!&quot;, said Madame in a high pitched voice.  Monica noticed the fun looking blocks and started trying to pick them up, but failing due to her mittens, while saying,&quot; uhn, uhn, uhn.  nnnghuuu.&quot;  But, that didn&#39;t last long because right along with Monica&#39;s wits, she also lost her knowledge of potty training.  And so, Monica stopped playing with her blocks as a muffled fart erupted from her diaper.  Monica developed a pained expression on her face, though she felt no pain, and started grunting while the crowd watched.  Within a few minutes, a warm mushy poo exited Monica&#39;s butt into the seat of her diaper meaning that she could go back to her toys as an earthy smell worked its way through the tent.  Meanwhile the crowd roared into a very loud cheer.</p>
