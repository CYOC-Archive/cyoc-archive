<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Jeff” approached his friends with his whole new body, they looked at him in amazement.<br />
<br />
“Wow dude your suit looks amazing! Almost like a real thing.” Noah said complimenting him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah but yours looks too similar to Greg’s also missing a tail and wings, have you bought it in the same place by any chance?” Zack giggled.<br />
<br />
“Haha, it seems so, but I did mine… some adjustments” the dragon Jeff smiled.<br />
<br />
“And sure they were worth it!” Noah kept praising his draconic look.<br />
<br />
“Hey, speaking of Greg, have you seen him?” Kyle wondered scratching his pierced nose. “He said he was going to the bathroom but he has taken a long time there.”<br />
<br />
The dragon tried to contain his smile, feeling how “Greg” protested in his crotch by feeling a tingling which was also turning him on, but he didn’t want to pull out his cock out of his sheath in front of everyone, they needed to think he was wearing a costume and not that it was his actual body. “He’s probably taking a big dump” he laughed as his friends did too. “Hey why not going to those private rooms and wait him there, I saw they have games and stuff” <br />
<br />
“Uh do we have permission for that? That things are usually a little expensive” Kyle asked.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, just follow me” the dragon walked with his digitigrade scaled legs as his friends followed him, unaware of what actually happened to Greg.<br />
<br />
The dragon Jeff approached one of the rooms, looking at one of the security guards who was about to ask them if the paid for the private room, but he gave him a stare that hypnotized him, controlling his mind to let them pass without problem.<br />
<br />
“Oh you must be Jeff, I was thinking you weren’t going to come for a second” the guard said gladly opening the door of the room.<br />
<br />
The dragon looked back at his friends, “See?” He walked inside, as his friends smiled and entered too.<br />
<br />
Minutes passed and they played some video games and other games together, but after some time “Jeff” decided it was his turn to have HIS fun. “Why don’t we… have a different type of fun~” the dragon said pulling out his big cock out of the sheath, his friends weirdly looked at him.<br />
<br />
“What the- is that a… cock? Why the hell would you include that in your suit bro?” Zack raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“Heh, if you knew the truth. This isn’t a suit… it’s me!” He mischievously laughed.<br />
<br />
“Jeff are you out of your mind? That drinks must have affected yo-“ Noah didn’t finish his sentence as a wave of power came out from around his dragon friend. “What the…”<br />
<br />
“The truth is that I’m not even Jeff!” He spoke using his powers to paralyze his friends as they were standing up. “I’m Riley! Jeff showed me his super computer that could do anything possible. I’m sure he has shown it to you at this point.”<br />
<br />
“Bro no way, the chronivac? He knows about it!?” Kyle said looking at Zack and Noah, unable to move their bodies except for the head.<br />
<br />
“That’s right, but I’m a Riley he called from another dimension and showed me his miraculous device… so I thanked him by turning him into my big cock!” The friends were shocked at the reveal, noticing how his penis palpitated even harder after he mentioned Jeff, “oh and your friend Greg is not coming… I merged our bodies together and turned him into my sheath to keep my stupid ‘brother’ hehe! Becoming a real dragon in the process as I loved his costume.”<br />
<br />
It made sense for Noah as the costume was ridiculously real for him. “But why!!? Why you had to do that to them!?” He’s probably screamed at him<br />
<br />
“Yeah!!” Both Zack and Kyle yelled. “You could just have turned yourself into a dragon and leave them alone!” Kyle protested.<br />
<br />
“Could I have turned myself into a dragon and make any change I wanted to me? Of course! But what would be the fun in that? Taking my parts from others… watching, feeling how they surrender against my body, into something greater is a feeling that I can’t describe how good it is” he said while licking his lips… passing his hands from his chest to his belly and crotch slit. “So why not continuing the party~” he said, casting a power that didn’t let them move any muscle, not even their mouth to yell at him, just being able to watch what the dragon was about to show them walking towards Zack first.<br />
<br />
The dragon put his back against Zack’s about to assimilate him. “You could be a nice pair of wings, ones so strong to let me fly and carry my weight” as he pronounced that words Zack’s body began to sink in his scaly back.<br />
<br />
“Now your arms and legs will extend sideways, each of your arms will merge with your respective leg to gain the form of a wing” as told, Zack barely could look at the sides since half of his face was swallowed the the dragon’s back, but he noticed how his left leg merged with his left arm, his bones shifted, his anatomy was being completely rearranged until it turned to be “Jeff’s” left wing, the same process happened with the right, when both were done they turned into the same bluish color of the dragon master. <br />
<br />
“Mmph~ you’re almost mine hehe” he bit his lips enjoying the process while Zack suffered how he chamged, “yeah… your insides will vanish only leaving your bones, your spine will fuse with mine as MY wings connect with it. At that point Zack was no longer a human but rather just a body part, feeling the rest of his torso sinking becoming part of the dragon’s structure only having his face left and the wings that were formerly his arms. <br />
<br />
“Finally your head will finish to fuse with my back, turning your skull into part of my strong spine” with that last words Zack’s humanity disappeared, completely merging with the dragon’s back and gifting his pair of wings.<br />
<br />
The dragon extended his long wings, looking at them with proud. To test them he controlled his wings to make them flap quickly letting him fly above the floor, satisfied with the result he stopped flying. “That’s what I expected from my glorious wings.” He smirked as the other friends were terrified of what they just looked at, a creature no longer human that swallowed one of them entirely and morphed him into a part of his body, that thing surely didn’t have any compassion or empathy, he was… pure evil.<br />
<br />
The improved dragon Jeff turned around, looking at Kyle. “You will help me with my final details too hehe” he pointed at Kyle, ordering him to lie on the floor face down.<br />
<br />
The dragon Jeff squatted on top of Kyle’s head, letting his ass rest on it as his back faced the rest of Kyle’s body. “We can begin with you now” he said licking his lips and letting his powers flow through him again, “you will make a really fine tail, so for that I will need the back of your head to merge with my rear.” As the creature commanded the fusion started, Kyle feeling how the back of his head and neck were merging with the dragon’s butt, feeling like his skin was being pinched really hard. <br />
<br />
“Now your legs will fuse together into a single pointy limb, while your penis disappears and your arms merge with your torso.” The change was being fulfilled and Kyle’s body morphed into what his now dragon master just said, turning him into a armless torso with a pointy meat tail at the end. <br />
<br />
“We’re doing very well Kyle!” The dragon master looked back smiling for a second seeing how his victim was transforming. “Now from your neck to the end of your pointy limb will merge with the part slightly above of my ass as your organs from that mentioned parts will disappear, tails do not need organs you know hehe! Instead your nerves of that zone will merge with mines, feeling totally pleasurable for me…” Kyle felt how his head partially detached from his body as the rest of him was becoming what it would be “Jeff’s” tail while his head was still below his ass, in the place where his anus should be. Meanwhile during the whole merge the dragon’s cock was really erected due the intense pleasure he felt. “Mmmph~ oh! yeah… f-finally your body, I mean, MY tail will be covered in my beautiful blue scales” He looked back again to see how his tail finished to form, now being able to control it by swinging it from left to right.<br />
<br />
The dragon Jeff stood up, happily swinging his tail in excitement. “This is a good and strong tail, I’m almost a complete great dragon!” He exclaimed while Kyle’s head was still paralyzed, stuck at the anthro dragon’s rear… but he was done with him. The dragon spread his butt cheeks with his clawed hands, “I haven’t forgotten about you bro~ I saved the best for the last”<br />
<br />
He wasn’t done!? What more bizarre things could that monster do to him? Is what Kyle was thinking, but unfortunately the Chronivac’s power fell in the hands of a dark, twisted and perverted mind. “We have to do something with that pretty face of yours! So it will become my new butt hole!” He giggled starting the change.<br />
<br />
“No… this must be a nightmare” Kyle kept thinking, unaware that “Jeff” was pleasured by his struggling and fear. “Your throat is one of the things I left from you, so now it will merge with the end of my bowels.” Kyle horribly felt the change, his mouth and throat were connecting with the end of the digestive tract of the dragon, being able to now taste the rancid flavor of it. <br />
<br />
“Nggh… yes…” The dragon moaned feeling how his anal muscles changed with Kyle and stimulated him, as the changes were finished he pushed Kyle’s nose deep to his ass. “nnhhf.. I&#39;ll be taking it from.. y-yeah.. here. You’re gonna be a bit.. occupied from now on... and won&#39;t be able to do much talking. Ever.” He whispered to himself as he finished to transform Kyle’s face into his puffy and round anus, making the dragon cum from his cock after releasing his contained lust. At the end he realized that his piercing was attached to his ass hole, which “Jeff” actually liked it. “Do you mind if I keep this Kyle?” He asked his anus, feeling how it twitched in response, “I knew you would agree, it fits me better than you.” He said laughing, accidentally letting out a wet fart the Kyle completely savored. “Oh dude… you’re fitting perfectly in your new job heh… remember that worse things will come in and out from there~” He said while mushing his butt cheeks together.<br />
<br />
“Damn, I look so good… So this is the body of a REAL anthro dragon huh” he said looking around to his body, not seeing a single imperfection with him, flexing his arms while he spread his long wings and his penis remained erected, noticing he was doing it in front of the still paralyzed Noah. “Oh right, you” he partially removed his power from Noah, keeping him still but being able to talk and move his head, looking at him horrified from what the creature did to his friends.<br />
<br />
“No! Riley no! I don’t want to be the next!” Noah yelled and almost cried begging for his life.<br />
<br />
“Heh, calm down, I just want to talk for a moment” the dragon calmly approached him, standing in front of him while swinging his tail. “Now that you mention that name, Riley, doesn’t suit anymore for a king like me… and I don’t want to be perceived as my brother… so from now on I will go with Riot! The one who will rule all of you~” Riot teased Noah by stroking his chin with his tail.<br />
<br />
Noah felt slightly less disturbed but was still scared. “So Rile- um… Riot, wh-what are y-your plans for me..?” He nervously asked being covered by the shadow of the all mighty dragon standing in front of him, being a 10 foot tall creature after he absorbed his friends.<br />
<br />
“Heh, I got a bigger surprise for you bro~” Riot crossed his arms licking his lips while looking at his human victim. Noah definitely didn’t have a good feeling about that gesture and wondered what the dragon had to say to him.</p>
