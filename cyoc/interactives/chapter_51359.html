<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Megan started whispering while Sally was saying, &quot;Please don't die Rick. Please don't die. You're my best friend so please don't die. Please let Mom be in time. Stay with us Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
You wanted to tell her not to be sad. You wanted to tell them that these last weeks had been the best in your life. You wanted to tell them many things but you couldn't move. That's the only thing that made you unhappy. Then you thought about what Megan had said about Sally's dad dying like this. You had to wonder how long he suffered with no one there for him. At least you assume he was alone from what Megan said.<br />
<br />
You don't know how long it had been but the pain started to ease. 'This is it,' you thought. 'I wish I could say goodbye to both of you and tell you how I love both of you.' However as the pain eased you started to feel your body and you realized that you weren't dying. The first thing you noticed was that you could feel air all over your body. Well not all over. You could feel the floor on your back. This disturbed you as the only way you could feel all that was if you were naked.<br />
<br />
As you were wondering about this you saw one of the wolves come back walking on it's hind legs. It came up to the screen and looked at you. It seemed very interested in you for some reason. Your attention was diverted from the wolf by the feeling of your body shrinking. You had to be hallucinating. Your dick began to feel funny. The air seemed to be touching less of it while still touching all of it. This confused you as you couldn't figure out why that would be. You didn't wonder for long as you felt a strange cramping sensation in your stomach and groin. It passed in a couple minutes and Megan stopped whispering at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;We couldn't find the one who attacked you,&quot; the wolf said startling you. &quot;We smelled recent portal activity where we think the attack came from.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Graypaw,&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is she?&quot; Graypaw asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well physically she's ok but mentally I don't know,&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did something happen to Sally?&quot; you asked as you turned your head. You saw that Sally seemed to be ok so who were they talking about?<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally's fine,&quot; Megan said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no I'm naked,&quot; you said realizing that Sally was able to see you. Your clothes must have burnt off.<br />
<br />
You started to move your hand to cover your dick but Megan placed a hand on your arm and said, &quot;Don't move too much. You're body's still adjusting and your motor skills will be a little off and you might hurt yourself.&quot; She looked up and asked, &quot;Will you bring her in and lay her on the couch Graypaw?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd be happy to,&quot; Graypaw said coming onto the patio.<br />
<br />
As soon as Graypaw picked you up you asked, &quot;Why are you referring to me like I'm a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven't really heard your voice have you?&quot; Sally asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my voice?&quot; you asked still not realizing it's different.<br />
<br />
Graypaw put you down on the couch and Megan took your hand guiding it to your crotch. &quot;This may come as a shock to you,&quot; she said, &quot;but you need to know. What do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
You felt something that shouldn't be possible. You couldn't feel any hair down there but that could be because it was burnt off like your clothes. What you should have been able to feel but couldn't was your dick and balls. Megan guided your hand to between your legs and you felt what shouldn't be there. You felt the folds of a pussy. &quot;This is impossible,&quot; you whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you had an open mind,&quot; Megan said moving your hand away and holding it.<br />
<br />
&quot;But how?&quot; you asked. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were dying,&quot; Megan said. Tears were streaming from her eyes as she continued, &quot;The only way for you to live was to be transformed. If it had been a mundane explosion I could have repaired your body. As it was a magical explosion it was breaking your body down. Fortunately once it starts it's locked on that specific genetic code. Changing the genetic code stops the destruction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you have to make me a girl though?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well sometimes you can get away with a small change,&quot; Megan said. &quot;However the best chance to stop it is to do a major change. It can adapt to small changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you can change me back now that I'm alive,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry but you can't be changed back,&quot; Megan said closing her eyes. &quot;If you were you would die from your body being destroyed. Think of it like a virus. Even though you don't have the symptoms anymore it's still there waiting to be passed on or for your immune system to be compromised.&quot;<br />
<br />
You groaned and said, &quot;So in essence I did die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From a certain point of view yes,&quot; Megan said. &quot;Of course instead of seeing this as a death you can see it as a rebirth.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down at yourself and asked, &quot;How old am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I made you nine,&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How am I going to explain this to my parents?&quot; you asked groaning again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they don't remember you as you were,&quot; Megan said looking like she was going to start crying in earnest. &quot;No one except us will remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do I do now?&quot; you asked sighing and on the verge of crying yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you stay here of course,&quot; Megan said. &quot;I made you my daughter. I should tell you that your name is Holly now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm your daughter?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Megan said. &quot;I figured that if we couldn't get married that you could still be a part of my family. Do you want to see yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I might as well,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
Megan pointed a small thin stick at something and whispered something. Soon a mirror floated above you and you could see yourself. There was nothing in your face to even hint at who you had been. Instead you looked like Sally with a few differences. You think your nose is a little wider than Sally's and your ears a little bigger. You were comparing yourself to pictures you had seen of Sally when she was nine so you might be mistaken. However you have the same fiery red hair and green eyes that Sally and Megan have. It was easy to tell that you're related to them now. You sighed and said, &quot;I guess this means I have to call you Mom now instead of Megan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I wouldn't bring my daughters up to disrespect their own mother,&quot; Megan said in a stern voice. &quot;Calling me by my name is a sign of disrespect. It tells people that you don't consider me to be your mother. I really can't see why parents allow their children to call them by their names.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can,&quot; you said. &quot;Those parents don't want to be parents but their children's friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No wonder the mortal world is in trouble,&quot; Megan said shaking her head. &quot;I know it will take you some time for you to adjust to your new life Holly so I won't punish you if you use my name up to a certain point. I want you to make an effort to call me Mom or if you want Mommy. Am I clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Meg... I mean Mommy,&quot; you said. &quot;How would you punish me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well since I'm a witch I could transform you,&quot; Megan said. &quot;But that would only be in the more extreme cases. Mostly I'd just put a block on you powers for awhile and send you to your room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Powers?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well as my daughter you're a witch now too,&quot; Megan said. &quot;Just like Sally is a witch. In fact Sally is the bird that has landed on your finger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were the bird?&quot; you asked looking at Sally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sally said. &quot;You'll learn how to transform yourself for short durations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll need a wand,&quot; Megan said. &quot;It can be just about anything and you'll just know your wand when you see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You moved your arm up to touch your face but for some reason your arm jerked and you ended up scratching just underneath your eye. &quot;Ouch,&quot; you said as you felt your finger nails dig into your flesh.<br />
<br />
Megan took your hand and lowered it saying, &quot;I told you not to move too much. After an hour you should be able to move normally.&quot; She took her wand and pointed it under your eye whispering something. You felt a flush of heat there then it cooled back down. &quot;Just be glad you didn't poke your eye out,&quot; she said shaking her head. &quot;That's a little tougher to heal than a cut. Now I need to go get you some clothes. Graypaw, will you watch them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I can but I need to get back to my pack soon,&quot; Graypaw said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't be long,&quot; Megan said. &quot;Holly, try not to move that much. If you need too move just make it as small as possible. And Sally, if your sister should hurt herself just leave her until I get back unless it's something major.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were able to set Kathy right,&quot; Sally said looking embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not the point,&quot; Megan said. &quot;You haven't practiced your healing spells enough. In fact practice on the dummy while I'm gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mom,&quot; Sally said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be back in a bit,&quot; Megan said putting the mirror back where it came from and heading out the door.</p>
