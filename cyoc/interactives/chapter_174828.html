<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob and Nelson were two 30 year old men who made a living off stealing people. It was sorta their business, but there were rules to it like any other business.<br />
<br />
1. They only stole from rich snobs who were “a waste of oxygen”<br />
2. They never worked alone<br />
3. Do not see the boss’s face<br />
<br />
They were introduced to those rules when their boss offered the job. It was something out of nowhere and unexpected to them. Luckily, they wasted their college life with theatre majors in college. <br />
<br />
Many years of scamming and stealing, they were given a job that required the both of them to work out new secret technology.<br />
<br />
A new genetics machine was created, allowing people to change their appearance and shape. It was a machine that was scammed into the business by other workers. People believed the machine to be an actual failure, but it wasn’t the real one.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the office, Jacob and Nelson sat in front of a tv screen with a man’s silhouette. <br />
<br />
“As you may now, we’ve reached groundbreaking advancement with a brand new machine. It allows you to change your appearance. We’ve tested it out, and it works perfectly fine.” The man said.<br />
<br />
“So what’s our job?” Nelson asked.<br />
<br />
“It’s simple. I will need one of you to be a nanny.”<br />
<br />
“But I thought we can’t work alone?” Jacob asked.<br />
<br />
“Well who do you think will require the nanny?”<br />
<br />
“You’re telling me one of us has to be a kid again? Does the nanny need to be a woman because if so I call being the kid!” Jacob said.<br />
<br />
“No the nanny can be any gender. You’ll be explained later, but right now I need the two of you to choose who will be the baby, and who will take care of the baby.<br />
<br />
The tv turns off and the two leave their seats. As they opened the door, the boss’s right hand woman named only addressed as Mrs K stood in the doorway. She was holding two manila folder with different sizes. “Who’s the baby and who’s the nanny?” She asked.<br />
<br />
The folders weren’t labeled, and the two of them could tell. “Wanna just play Rock Paper Scissors for it?” Jacob asked.<br />
<br />
“We could just flip a coin for whoever gets to pick.” Nelson suggested. Jacob agreed. Nelson flipped a coin, and as it went into the air, the two said their sides.<br />
<br />
“Heads!” Nelson said.<br />
<br />
“Tails!” Jacob said!”<br />
<br />
Mrs K grabbed the coin out of frustration and gave it to Nelson. She gave them their folders and started to walk away. “You can read them while you follow me!” She ordered. The guys opened up their folders and caught up to Mrs K.<br />
<br />
“I’m the nanny?” Nelson complained.<br />
<br />
“Yes! I’m the baby!” Jacob exclaimed. <br />
<br />
“Good! Now be quiet like one!” Mrs K ordered as she stuck a baby blue pacifier into Jacob’s mouth. He didn’t care and proceeded to chew on it as they walked.<br />
<br />
“Our targets are millionaires who are almost billionaires. The husband as you can see is rarely home, so his wife tends to run the house when she doesn’t work.”<br />
<br />
“They both work?” Nelson asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes. The wife is known for being the top ten in jewelry mines. What we want from her is ownership of those mines.”<br />
<br />
“And the husband?”<br />
<br />
“He in the top five with dealing with that jewelry. Except he sells fakes for the price of the real ones. Unless you’re famous, you’ll get shitty jewelry.”<br />
<br />
“I’m guessing you want Jacob and I to transfer the ownership to us?”<br />
<br />
“Is there anything else you want us to take from them?”<br />
<br />
“Have Jacob steal their hearts by acting like a convincing baby!” She pointed at Jacob, who was now sucking on the pacifier by now.<br />
<br />
“Jacob!” Nolan shouted. He yanked the pacifier out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
“What? It was relaxing!”<br />
<br />
“Save the baby stuff till we get changed!”<br />
<br />
“Fine!”<br />
<br />
The two were fully informed of the circumstances and what will happen. Luckily, the two got to choose their new identities.<br />
<br />
“This machine allows us to create a model of what we will look like. It ranges from age, height, size, and even hair count. We will have Jacob design a cute little boy between the ages of 1 and 2, while Nolan will create the ideal nanny.”<br />
<br />
Jacob went first to the machine. He was shown exactly how to work it and even got to practice by making random suggestions. He was able to choose the basic designs, while the thieves who helped learn about the machine did the advanced settings.<br />
<br />
Jacob looked at the screen and approved of what he’s changed. He sat and listened to what he’ll deal with among being a baby, including his voice. He decided to leave it to the professionals.<br />
 <br />
Jacob was instructed to enter the machine naked since his clothes could alter the results. He did as he was instructed and entered nude. He closed the glass door and gave everyone a thumbs up.<br />
<br />
The machine turned on, and a bright light filled the room immediately. Smoke filled the tube, covering Jacob entirely. When the smoke dissipated, the new Jacob appeared struggling to stand up.<br />
<br />
One of the workers came by and picked Jacob up and took him to another room. It was Nolan’s turn, who was able to fully customize the basic and advanced settings.<br />
<br />
The same procedure happened to Nolan when he finished, and he emerged completely different. One of the workers handed him a hospital robe to put on and he did. He led him to another room where they planned to perform a physical check on him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Inside the room was a makeshift doctor’s room. It wasn’t fancy, but it was enough to make sure Nolan was healthy. They even had his usual nurse be the one to check on him.<br />
<br />
“Well Nolan, I’m surprised the boss wanted you to do this!” The nurse said. She checked his heart rate and wrote it down.<br />
<br />
“Yea I’m not surprised. He had Jacob and I do the weirdest ones. I swear he enjoys this!”<br />
<br />
“Well it’s not that bad. Just wait till you find out what they’re doing to Jacob.” She checked his ears, eyes, and mouth, then wrote something down once more. “Poor thing is getting many vaccines and checkups. He’s going to hate the cleansing part.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t have to do any of that right?”<br />
<br />
“No not really. You didn’t change ages, so there’s no need. But we do need to go over your changes.” She pulled out a clipboard and sat down.<br />
<br />
“You used to be a 5’ 8” 30 year old man with blond hair and brown eyes. There was a lack of facial and very little body hair. Average muscle and stamina showed you tend to workout. The most changed part about you was your member.”<br />
<br />
“Yea, so tell me my new changes!”<br />
<br />
“You became a 30 year old 6’ man with a salt and pepper beard and shorter brown hair. Your muscles were improved along with body hair. You’ve made sure to add a v-line to your new and improved genitals.”<br />
<br />
“This bad boy isn’t just about growing, it can show too.” Nelson pointed to his gown that now has an obvious boner.”<br />
<br />
“I’m pretty sure you’ve copied someone from a dilf porno magazine I’ve read somewhere.” The nurse said. Nelson’s boner went away and he started to blush.<br />
<br />
“Like I’ve said long ago, I’m not gay. That was just a job and Jacob was railing someone else!”<br />
<br />
“Yea I know. Anyways it will take a few days for your vocals to adjust to your new body. While we wait, would you like to see Jacob?”<br />
<br />
“Sure!” <br />
<br />
The nurse led Nelson to another room where they saw a glass window that revealed a more childish operating room. <br />
<br />
“Did people see my checkup?” Nelson asked.<br />
<br />
“No, unless you wanted them to?”<br />
<br />
“No thanks!”<br />
<br />
Jacob was on the doctor’s table wearing nothing but a diaper. He was being held down by two nurses as a doctor stuck a needle into him. Jacob’s cry could be heard from the room Nelson was. When he pulled it out, he applied a bandaid to where he gave the shot. <br />
<br />
Nelson wasn’t sure what they were saying behind the glass. All he could see is a crying baby and a doctor packing his things. When he finished, he left the room along with the two nurses, leaving Jacob to be laying down crying.<br />
<br />
“The little guy is ready to go to work!” The doctor said as he entered be room. Before it was just Nelson and his nurse, but now that more people entered the room, he was starting to feel uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
“Nelson, let’s go take you to your study room!” His nurse said.<br />
<br />
“Study room?”<br />
<br />
“Well yes. You’re going to need to learn how to be a nanny.”<br />
<br />
The two left the room and started waking out of the building’s makeshift hospital, leaving Jacob alone.</p>
