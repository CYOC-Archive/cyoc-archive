<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two girls walked back into Kylie's room.  Kylie had her math book and notebook on the bed, since she was not sure about what they were actually going to do.  Jamie noticed and said, &quot;Just in case, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie confessed, &quot;Well to be honest, I had no idea what you were going to want to do.&quot;  Jamie made a confession of her own.  &quot;I don't know either.  But I brought my stuff too.  Do you think that your parents would check on us?&quot;  Kylie shrugged her shoulders.  &quot;Who knows?  When Kyle was here, he didn't usually have friends overnight.  And certainly no girls,&quot; she added, giggling at that thought.  <br />
<br />
Jame found that interesting.  &quot;Why do you laugh when you say that?&quot;  Kylie answered, &quot;I guess you didn't know Kyle at all.  If I recall he didn't recognize you at the door, so...&quot;  There was something Jamie had to know.  She interrupted, &quot;Just curious, but why do you keep referring to him as Kyle, and not as you?&quot;  Kylie wasn't sure herself.  &quot;I don't know.  It's like I have his memories, but I'm not him.&quot;  Kylie sat herself down on her bed, preparing for a long conversation.  Jamie did the same.<br />
<br />
Kylie continued her thoughts.  &quot;I don't seem to have really any Kylie memories.  But as far as I'm concerned, I'm not Kyle.  I might still have his personality, but I obviously look different, and I'll certainly be acting different.  I'll just have to move on from here.&quot;  Jamie found that interesting.  &quot;Wow,&quot; she said.  &quot;I can't imagine what that feels like.&quot;  Kylie said, &quot;If I don't think about it, it doesn't bother me.  At least that's what I've found so far.  But anyway, about Kyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was too shy, too timid.  Going through puberty is a rough time for boys as well as girls.  Their growth spurts, they have no coordination, no control over the feelings and hormones.  It's rough.  Kyle knew he was, well how should I say this?&quot;  Jamie answered, &quot;Well hung?&quot;  Kylie burst out laughing, a very sexy laugh according to Jamie's ears.  &quot;Yea, I guess you could say that,&quot; Kylie said after regaining her composure.  &quot;He just wasn't ready to talk to girls, though.  I think that being a freshman didn't help either.  I'm sure you know that freshman couples get picked on, and the upper classes don't seek them out either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie admitted that was true.  &quot;It's really stupid, too.&quot;  Kylie sighed, &quot;Oh that's how it will always be.  You know that.&quot;  Jamie asked, &quot;So how do you think you're going to handle being one of us girls now?&quot;  Jamie hoped that some things would be revealed by this answer.  &quot;I don't know,&quot; Kylie admitted.  &quot;I think that you four have been a big help so far, and if you continue to be, it will be so much easier.  I think that I'll only have to get used to the physical changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie warned her, &quot;There's a lot of mental differences, too, you know.  You have to be careful with that.&quot;  Kylie smiled.  She told Jamie, &quot;You know that Kyle was already like that?&quot;  &quot;Like what?&quot; Jamie asked.  &quot;Like he was a girl mentally?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie answered, &quot;Not exactly, but kind of close.  I don't think he would have taken well to getting his heart broken.  He seemed to have a soft spot for certain things.  He would just cry every once in a while.  I don't think you find many teenage boys like that.&quot;  Jamie remained silent for a moment, as she took in everything Kylie had told her.  &quot;It sounds like he was just in touch with himself and his feelings,&quot; Jamie guessed.  &quot;I've always thought that if more guys were like that, the world would be in better shape.&quot;  Kylie laughed, &quot;You can say that again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie was now getting embarrassed by all the attention she was getting from Jamie.  &quot;Well let's not talk about me and Kyle all night,&quot; she said.  &quot;What about you?  Who is the real Jamie...I still don't know your last name.&quot;  Jamie laughed, but was afraid that this would get her off the subject.  &quot;Well to start, Gessler is my last name, so you remember that,&quot; she mockingly commanded.  Kylie laughed at that.<br />
<br />
Jamie gave a quick rundown of her history.  Background, parents, no siblings, her likes and dislikes, general things like that.  Kylie said, &quot;Well we have something in common.  I'm an only child too.&quot;  Curious, she asked, &quot;What about boyfriends?&quot;  Jamie's interest was sparked again.  She might be able to get some information out of this answer.  She told the truth.  &quot;Well I've only ever had two serious relationships.  Neither lasted long, about 4 months each.  One was sophomore year, the other was junior year.  You wouldn't know either guy, they both go to different schools.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie tiptoed around her next question.  &quot;Did you ever, um, you know?&quot;  Jamie asked, &quot;What, fuck?&quot;  Kylie nodded, very embarrassed.  &quot;It's OK,&quot; Jamie told her.  &quot;I don't mind.  The first one, no.  That's kind of why he dumped me.  The second one, yes.  I only did then because I thought he would dump me if I didn't.  Also I did feel that we were both responsible enough to do it.  But it turned out that that was all he had an interest in.  We had sex, ooh, five or six times.  That's my love life in a nutshell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's nice to have at least had one I guess,&quot; Kylie surmised.  &quot;Other than this afternoon when the changes were happening, I surely haven't had any sexual contact.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jamie was just about to change the tone of the conversation when a light knocking came at the door.  Quickly they both made it look like they were working on math.  Kylie's mother poked her head in, and said, &quot;Girls, we're going to bed now.  Keep it down as much as you can.  You haven't been loud, so I'm not concerned.  Just don't stay up too late.&quot;  &quot;OK, Mom,&quot; Kylie replied.  &quot;Sure thing, Mrs. Perkins,&quot; was Jamie's answer.  Kylie's mother said goodnight and closed the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's a mood killer,&quot; Jamie said after she heard the other bedroom door close.  Kylie wasn't sure what exactly she meant by that.  But she had a good guess.  She began to feel a little hot under the collar, so to speak.  The feelings were once again entering her tormented mind.  She felt that she would be a perfect fit with this girl, but was it OK for her to be gay?  And more importantly, did Jamie feel the same way? <br />
<br />
Kylie first had to decide whether she could picture herself with a guy.  She looked around her room for stimuli.  That Ben Affleck/Matt Damon poster just didn't do anything for her.  Maybe she had put it up a few years ago, as the poster showed a year or two of age, when she felt that kind of lustfulness.  She decided to be direct, and ask Jamie about the afternoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie, I'll tell you this,&quot; she started.  &quot;I think Kyle was a sweetheart, but I don't want to repeat some of his traits.  For me, that means to stop being shy and timid.  So I'm going to be direct.&quot;  Jamie hoped this would lead where she wanted it.  &quot;OK,&quot; she said, ready for anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you were dancing for Kyle today, what was your motivation?&quot; she asked.  Jamie didn't quite expect this question, but realized it could build from there.  &quot;To be honest, I felt sorry for him,&quot; Jamie said.  &quot;I still thought it somewhat cruel to change his sex without him really consenting.  So I thought it would be nice to go all out for him, to appeal to his last senses of maleness.  I also noticed that his cock didn't get hard for Trish and Liz.  Well, it was when Trish sucked it, but I think that was leftover from Jenn, to be honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by that,&quot; Kylie asked.  Jamie said, &quot;I had a feeling that he was attracted to me.  I thought that would be a good way of finding out.&quot;  &quot;Do you think that told you?&quot;  Jamie admitted, &quot;For certain, no.  But pretty sure.&quot;  Kylie told her, &quot;Well I can tell you the truth.  He did.  He thought you were actually the prettiest of all four of you.  As I recall, he found Trish to be the hottest, but he knew her reputation, and wasn't attracted to it.&quot;  Jamie laughed and said, &quot;Yea Trish can be insatiable sometimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie then asked, &quot;So what were you thinking when you stuck your tongue in my pussy?&quot;  Jamie was waiting for this question.  &quot;You looked like you were ready to burst.  I thought that would help reliever any pressure or pain you were feeling.  But...&quot; she stopped and looked up into Kylie's eyes, &quot;I was more curious than anything.  I didn't really know what that felt like.&quot;  She decided not to tell Kylie about her and Liz's little romp in the afternoon.  One reason was because that was spur of the moment and wouldn't happen again, and two because she didn't stick her tongue anywhere on Liz except inside Liz's mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did it feel?&quot; Kylie wondered.  &quot;It felt really good for me.&quot;  Jamie said, &quot;It was definitely different.&quot;  Seeing that Kylie didn't seem satisfied with that answer, she added, &quot;In a good way.  I mean, oh God, I'm not even sure.&quot;  Kylie began inching closer to her.  &quot;It was unlike anything I'd ever felt before,&quot; Jamie continued.  &quot;And it felt natural for me.  I had never seemed fulfilled with my boyfriend, but just by doing that for you, I felt good about myself sexually for the first time ever.&quot;  <br />
<br />
During this time, Jamie had turned her head away from Kylie, and didn't really notice her getting closer.  Now she turned back and could see that the space between them had narrowed.  Kylie had to come out and say it.  She was determined to be more outgoing in any way possible.  If Jamie was put off, then so be it.  But her intuition was telling her that Jamie wouldn't be.<br />
<br />
Kylie placed her hand on Jamie's shoulder, reached up and touched her face with her left hand.  Then she spoke, &quot;Jamie, I think I'm a lesbian.&quot;  Jamie didn't give any answer, either vocally or facially.  &quot;I've been thinking about it all day.  You've been so good to me.  You're willing to help me learn how to be a woman.  And I think that Kyle's attraction to you carried over to me.  He was really attracted to your personality, too, and so am I.&quot;  Still Jamie remained unmoved.  Kylie's heart began to sink.  She removed her hand from Jamie's face.  &quot;Do you hate me now?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Jamie reached up with her left hand and placed it on top of Kylie's hand that was still on her shoulder.  She looked directly into Kylie's eyes.  &quot;No I don't hate you.  I could never hate you.  I'll be honest now.  I felt sorry for Kyle.  I know that Jenn does some really bad things.  He was the first person to try and pay her back, even if it was thanks to someone else.  I admired that.  And I admired the fact that he tried to fight Jenn's control of him.  He showed an inner strength, I guess is how you'd call it.  I was flattered that he seemed to be more interested in me than the other girls.  I usually come in last in that race.  The attention felt nice.  I've been having strange feelings for a while now.  I wasn't sure of what they were.  But I think that everything that has happened today has finally told me what they are.&quot;  She turned her body to face Kylie's now as well.  &quot;Kylie, I am a lesbian.  And I'm a lesbian who's very attracted to the lesbian staring back at her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie smiled wide.  She took her hand out from under Jamie's and threw her arms around Jamie's neck.  Jamie reached back to remove them.  Kylie had a quizzical look on her face as she did this.  That look would be replaced in a moment.  Jamie leaned into Kylie's face and placed her firm red lips directly onto Kylie's.  They embraced each other in a deep, passionate kiss.  They had felt it with each other all day.  Now they were free to act upon their urges.  But both knew that this was far more serious than sexual tension.  They were talking about each other's personalities.  That was borderline love.  Was it love between them already?  They would have to find out for themselves.<br />
<br />
At last their lips parted ways.  They looked into each other's eyes for a moment.  Jamie smiled again, and slightly turned her head, with a look on her face that asked, &quot;Should we?&quot;  Kylie got the message.  She nodded her head.</p>
