<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Spencer Lawson approached the spot where Morgan Barr said he would meet her, she stopped to stare ahead at the clearing under the trees.<br />
There was a table cloth spread out across the grass with a plastic cooler in one corner.<br />
A young werewolf was sitting cross legged in the center of the cloth.<br />
Spencer saw that he was completely covered in brown fur. Unusual, but not rare for a pure blooded lupine.<br />
Otherwise, there was nothing different from him than any other werewolf his age, but Spencer would be the first to admit that he looked kind of cute sitting there waiting for her.<br />
&quot;Morgan?&quot; she asked, drawing nearer.<br />
&quot;Yes. Spencer?&quot; he asked, standing up. Doing so revealed to her just how excited he was to be here.<br />
<br />
If she hadn&#39;t told him what to expect, Morgan Barr would be uncertain exactly what kind of were was standing in front of him.<br />
The black furred female before him was definitely some combination of wolf and feline weres*. Yet with Spencer Lawson it not only worked out well, but gave her an exotic appearance that instantly made him get excited about what was about to happen, physically as well as mentally.<br />
&quot;Yes. What&#39;s all this?&quot; Spencer asked, indicating the stuff with him.<br />
&quot;My mother always tells me that there&#39;s more to romancing and making love to a woman than just the sex, so I thought that afterward, we could kick back, hang out, and relax for a while before we each have to go home for the night.&quot; <i>I may still be able to count the total number of times I&#39;ve had sex on one paw after tonight, but I certainly know how to treat a female properly.</i><br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Spencer in a non-committal tone of voice, but surprised that Morgan had even thought of, let alone made such arrangements.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have to be home for hours yet,&quot; she said, taking a quick glance at the time on the cellphone in her paw before setting it down near the cooler. Her alarm was set for midnight, so as long as she was home by one...<br />
Then Spencer turned around and said, &quot;But right now, I don&#39;t have much patience for foreplay either,&quot; as she reached out and started stroking his hard lupine cock with her paws.<br />
<br />
Morgan had smelled Spencer&#39;s lust and growing moisture between her legs with every step she had taken. He would soon discover that Spencer&#39;s fur was matted with her juices, because she was in too much of a hurry, let alone need, to clean up before leaving her house.<br />
The fact that she was in serious heat (lust?) was confirmed when she moved closer to him and started kissing Morgan, even as she was inserting his red rocket to enter her needy pussy.<br />
It didn&#39;t matter that he was a couple of inches noticeably shorter than her in height.<br />
Morgan groaned in a growing lust of his own as he grabbed Spencer&#39;s hips and thrust forward, making sure his penis reached the destination that it was openly invited to.<br />
The feeling of entering such a tight tunnel, even as her inner flesh exercised its own grip upon his wolfhood, felt wonderful to the young were.<br />
Spencer involuntarily gave out a small whine in acknowledgement of finally being filled with what she desired most since going into heat, even as she continued kissing Morgan and running her paws all over his brown fur covered body.<br />
Her tail was starting to wag in happiness while Morgan continued to thrust deeply into Spencer&#39;s depths as much as he could while kissing his way down her neck and toward the tip of one hard nipple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a sec,&quot; said Spencer, and the next thing Morgan knew, he was flat on his back as she continued to ride him like a cowgirl on a bucking bronco.<br />
Spencer urged him on as Morgan raised his head to continue orally pleasing her tits, even as his paws tightened their grip on her hips.<br />
This wasn&#39;t any expression of love, pure or otherwise. This was just plain, outright sex, yet neither were cared.<br />
All that mattered at that moment was continuing until they both were sated.<br />
Spencer suddenly raised her head and howled at the nonexistent moon above them as her body shuddered in sheer pleasure from her first orgasm.<br />
Yet that didn&#39;t slow her down as she continued riding Morgan&#39;s cock well past her second, and even third climax.<br />
<br />
Morgan Barr held on for dear life, never once letting go of his partner&#39;s hips even as he continued thrusting into her.<br />
Spencer&#39;s pussy was as wet as it could be, which made sliding his cock easier as he raised his butt with each thrust, trying to plunge further into her than anyone might have ever gone before.<br />
Their tails were wagging frantically, which indicated different things to each were. She that her desires were finally being fulfilled. He, grateful for the experience and that Spencer was enjoying the moment.<br />
Spencer felt his lupine knot embedding itself deep within her, but it was not deep enough as the lust consumed her.<br />
Finally, her frantic inner call for sex was fully addressed and her body&#39;s heat cycle satisfied.<br />
Spencer howled out again during a fourth (or was it sixth?) climax.<br />
Then, spent, she collapsed on top of him.<br />
Her hard nipples pressed against his furry chest as she passionately kissed him to show her thanks.<br />
<br />
Yet something had awakened in Morgan.<br />
He had come twice, the second time just as Spencer issued her final howl of pleasure, but it wasn&#39;t enough.<br />
With an urge and strength he was unaware of before now, Morgan flipped them over until it was Spencer on her back.<br />
He began thrusting into her once more, not caring about how many times Spencer might have already come, only that <i>his</i> desire for the she-wolf/whatever else she was had to be fulfilled.<br />
Spencer just smiled at Morgan and raised her legs to lock them around his body. He felt them pressing against his rump, urging him onward to greater heights of desire.<br />
A grunt and a return smile was Morgan&#39;s only reply while making sure he had a better grip on Spencer&#39;s hips in this new position as he continued to thrust deeper into the willing female below him.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t have to have a were&#39;s unique sense of smell to detect the scent of hot sex in the air as Morgan Barr continued fucking Spencer Lawson.<br />
The slapping sound of their thighs coming together as cock plunged into pussy grew even louder as he continued thrusting as fast, hard, and deep as possible into her.<br />
Her pussy had claimed his penis and was not releasing it, which was okay with Morgan as he desperately tried wedging it even further into her.<br />
Spencer thought she had already experienced total sexual bliss, so was surprised to feel it building within her now.<br />
The orgasm of all orgasms!<br />
She raised her head and unleashed a mighty howl of pure pleasure as everything seemed to disappear before her in a blinding flash of white light.<br />
Morgan was howling too even as he continued thrusting into Spencer, consumed by a fire, a passion he had never experienced before.<br />
The inferno may consume him until there was nothing left but ash, yet there was no way he would stop until...<br />
<br />
The howl died on Morgan&#39;s lips as the world went dark.<br />
Totally spent from sheer sexual exhaustion, he collapsed on top of Spencer.<br />
But having already passed out, she didn&#39;t complain, her senses totally overloaded by the until now unimaginable sheer pleasure she had just experienced.<br />
There in the woods, Morgan Barr and Spencer Lawson laid together.<br />
In time, his cock would deflate and his top knot release its hold upon her inner depths to reluctantly slide out of a very well serviced vagina, but it would still be another half hour after that before the two of them would wake up in each other&#39;s furry arms.<br />
