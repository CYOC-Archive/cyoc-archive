<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had turned out as a poor catch for the goblin, then it became a more promising venture, to end up eventually as a disappointing capture. The goblin had wanted to catch a few humans on his own, so as to avoid dividing the hefty bag of coins from the sales of a few humans in the slave market specifically designed for them. That goblin, like all of his kind, wanted to get rich and fast with the least amount of effort and time as possible. With the coins, he&#39;d buy wonderful weapons and gifts for the best females in brothels as he could. But first, he had had to pay a large sum to a wizard for him to arrive in the human world. He had chords and nets, as well as a purse with fake gems to attract unsuspecting humans. Alas, he had ended up in a countryside that seemed rather empty, with hedges and a few houses and barns scattered. But near a river, the goblin running around quickly yet discreetly finally spotted what he wanted. A boy playing with a BB gun, shooting at cans near a pile of old stones. He looked around 12 in human years, young enough to be adoptable by prospective parents, and not just becoming a mate. Moreover, for a human, the boy seemed handsome, with his dark blond curly hair, freckles across his face and tall muscular body. Now, the really hard part had to be dealt with.<br />
<br />
The goblin attracted the boy by calling out for help, leaving the boy to discover him in the tall grass, lying down with an ankle caught in a knot the goblin had himself expertly tied. He asked for the boy&#39;s help, beseeching him with pleading eyes. The boy, overcoming his astonishment, untied the simple knot and the goblin jumped up, shouting out in joy. He thanked the boy profusely for his kind heart, because the poor goblin that he was had been curse d and a pure heart like the boy&#39;s had freed him. The good boy deserved as reward! The goblin handed him a diamond that looked real to any human. In truth, after a sunset, they would turn into dried leaves. The boy&#39;s eyes sparkled in wonder and most of all greed. Perfect! The goblin nonchalantly let the purse open more than needed and he could see the boy darting glances at the remaining enchanted glittering gems. He was hooked. He wanted more, the greedy little idiot. The goblin talked to him and quickly got his suspicions confirmed. The boy loved money and was always willing to get more. He loved getting his hands on anything that could bolster his popularity. He also complained that his little sister brought him shame and she was ugly, stupid, and always starting fights. Moreover, if he was an only child, his parents would pour all the presents, travels and nice things upon him instead. He&#39;d be the favourite for sure and be spoilt all the time, like some friends of his that had no siblings and had everything they wanted, whenever they wanted. The goblin knew he had the perfect arrogant moron into his hands! Now he had to play with intelligence. He said that as the boy had freed him from death and a terrible fate and existence, then another gift was in order for the sweet little human. He could make him into an only child. Little girls were a great rarity in the lands of goblins and she would be well-treated. She&#39;d be happy because she&#39;d be seen as a strange yet endearing little human, so different to boys. On his side, the boy would be rid of his pesky little sister for good.<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; the goblin said as if in great concern, his hand in front of his mouth. &quot;You might regret the playing you used to do with her. All the games you played. There would be no compensation for that...&quot;<br />
He finished by fiddling as if with nervousness with the purse at his belt, a movement which indicated that the boy shifted his gaze towards the purse. His desire for riches was going to win over easily. <br />
&quot;I can give you my sister for your purse of diamonds,&quot; he said easily.<br />
&quot;Are you sure, there are so few diamonds to compensate for the fun you&#39;ll miss with her... Are you sure?&quot; he said with well-faked worry. <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll buy video games to help pass the time. And she&#39;ll be happier with you. She would have a crappy life if she stayed here,&quot; he said, peering into the purse at the myriad of shiny diamonds and other sparkling gems. <br />
&quot;Bring her here and I will take her to my land, then,&quot; the goblin said.<br />
The by rushed, the future things he&#39;d buy with the diamonds swirling in his head, no doubt. The goblin wanted to laugh out loud. That boy was as arrogant as he was greedy and cowardly. A real moron! He made things just too easy! He&#39;d snatch him as he clicked on the magical machine to bring him back to his own world. Hopefully, his new parents would beat a few values into him. A lot of discipline wouyld do him a lot of good.<br />
<br />
Luckily, the sister seemed very different. She had more intelligent eyes and if she might be considered less beautiful than her brother, she was not a brat as he claimed and she was not ugly, even for a human. She&#39;d probably grow into a comely appearance and the goblin thought he could see no true difference between her and the boy. Granted, he was not the best in judging humans to start with, though. Besides, a few spells and the species to adopt her would help with her appearance if it was really needed. She&#39;d fetch enough value just because of her age. The goblin handed the boy the purse, which he stared at greedily, happy with the bargain. The girl preferred looking at he goblin.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re coming with me, child.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; she said, stepping back. <br />
&quot;Come on, he says he can make you visit his land. Don&#39;t you want to?&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure? I don&#39;t think...&quot;<br />
&quot;Move on and don&#39;t piss off people!&quot; he said nastily, pushing her towards the goblin.<br />
She took fright and it proved she was smarter that her big brother. Granted, it wasn&#39;t hard, considering that greedy idiot. The goblin tied her up and gagged her, muffling her tears and cries. She called out to her brother for help but was busy counting and examining the precious stones.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be off. Enjoy your reward for your good action.&quot;<br />
The boy just smiled at him. The portal opened and after pushing the girl beyond it, the goblin lunged for the boy. But his attempt to force him into another reality failed. The lunge had been too long, the boy escaped his grasp and stumbled away. The goblin wanted to chase after him but the portal would not last long. The device would soon run out of magical energy. The goblin chose to keep his one prize and darted back in his own real, leaving the portal to close and the boy whose precious source of money would turn to worthless dead leaves in a few hours&#39; time, after sunset. The goblin grumbled, reflecting that his life without his sister, hogging all of their parents&#39; attention and income, might be reward enough, but that her disappearance would come back biting him in. the butt sooner or later. In the meantime, he did have something. A girl of eight would reach a very good price, especially if he played his cards right.</p>
