<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>As Luke was admiring his ears, he enjoyed the way they looked, but he didn't know 
how well having werewolf ears would go over in a world of humans. The werewolf ears 
would stick out to everyone and he would be considered a freak. Luke wanted to keep the 
ears and even experiment with other things as well, but for practicality's sake, Luke knew 
that he couldn't keep them. Looking at the Wiki again, Luke searched for the change that 
was made, but he couldn't find it. Everything listed on the page was listed as human. 
Curious to see if his ears reflected what was listed on the wiki, he looked at the mirror next 
to his computer and saw that his ears did look human, but they had a pointed tip on the 
tops.</br>
<br><em>Cool... typing in werewolf ears must have given them the ability to shift back 
and forth just like a werewolf would!</em> Luke thought to himself.</br>
<br>Luke was curious what else he should mess around with on the wiki, going toward 
the werewolf side of things with his newest discovery. As he was looking at the page, 
finding one thing that he would love to have improvements on, Luke's cell phone 
rang.</br>
<br>Luke sighed as he leaned over to grab his cell off of the computer desk that was 
almost out of reach. Seeing who it was, Luke's entire disposition changed instantly. Bruce 
was Luke's best friend and always brought along his boyfriend David, who was a close 
second in being Luke's best friend. Had Luke met David before Bruce, the situation may 
have been reversed.</br>
<br>Wondering what Bruce wanted, Luke hit the answer button on his Motorola Droid 2 
and put the phone up to his ear.</br>
<br>"Heya Bruce, what's going on man?" Luke asked casually and cheerfully.</br>
<br>"Oh... nothin man, was bored and David thought I should call you to see if you 
wanted to do anything together. He is just as bored as I am, if not more."</br>
<br>"Sure, we can do something together. Why don't you swing over to the apartment, I'll 
leave the door unlocked."</br>
<br>"Ok... we will be over in a few minutes then!" Bruce said happily, his boredom being 
broken with that single call.</br>
<br>As the call ended, Luke smiled, wondering if either of them would notice his pointed 
ears. It would be the first test to see how everything would go over. As Luke got up to walk 
through his apartment and unlock the door, he noticed that his muscles were pretty sore, 
as if he just got done working out hard. Luke was somewhat interested in being a body 
builder and had been working out hard for a few months, but not to the point of being 
freakish. Like Bruce and David, Luke was gay too and thought that muscles were sexy as 
hell. The thing was Luke also knew that muscle guys don't like non muscled guys for the 
most part. Sure, Luke figured that there had to be some out there that would probably 
even like to help smaller guys get big, but they were definitely a rare breed. Luke was 
beginning to see a change in his body, but it was slight. He knew becoming a body builder 
was long and hard, but he wished he could have gained more slightly quicker.</br>
<br>Getting to the door, he unlatched the lock and no sooner than when he started to 
walk away to sit in the living room, Bruce and David walked in. Bruce and David were your 
average couple, attractive, slightly fuzzy, athletic in build and both had facial hair in 
different styles. David liked rocking the full and thick, but neatly trimmed beard to appear 
more rugged. Bruce on the other hand changed it up, rocking either the full goatee or that 
with a chin strap.</br>
<br>"Hey guys!" Luke said happily as he sat down.</br>
<br>As Luke sat down, he felt his clothes strain against his body, as if he had put on 
clothes that barely fit him, but he knew that was not the case because he put on very 
baggy clothes, which was his style.</br>
<br>As Bruce and David walked in, they looked at Luke with a bit of shock, but they didn't 
say anything... thinking Luke was going for a new look.</br>
<br>"Looking good Luke..." David said and continued "... seems like your working out has 
definitely made progress!"</br>
<br>Luke chuckled "Yeah... I have started to make a little progress..."</br>
<br>"A little?!?!" Bruce interrupted "I'd say you have made a lot of progress bro! I wish I 
could bulk up as quickly as you have! You aren't taking roids are you?"</br>
<br>"Man... what are you talking about?" Luke asked confused... more than ever. "You 
know I have only been workin out a couple months now and that I wont touch that shit! I 
am doing this au natural."</br>
<br>"I believe you man... but if I didn't know better, you haven't looked at yourself in a 
mirror lately. Hell... you are turning out to be one hell of a rugged stud, especially with that 
beard of yours!"</br>
<br>"Beard... what are..." Luke was about to ask as he brought his hand up to his face, 
feeling the thick stubble that covered all the normal places. Luke's eyes widened feeling 
the scruff that had not been there a second ago, but was even more amazed by how 
rugged his hands were. His hands were massive, like a lumberjacks or a seasoned 
construction worker. As he looked his hands over, Luke noticed thick and dense hair on his 
hands, going up his arms. Luke was genuinely surprised by what else he saw, seeing his 
forearms as thick and muscled. Luke's eyes followed up his arms, looking over the rest of 
him and seeing how fuckin hot he was now. Huge muscles adorned his once puny arms, 
chest, shoulders, chest and everywhere else imaginable. Thick hair poked up from his 
chest from out of the neck line, tickling his chin. Luke was excited and curious to see the 
rest of him, but he didn't realizing that Bruce and David were staring at him, wondering if 
he was ok.</br>
<br>"Dudes, don't look at me like that... you know how I was just a couple days 
ago."</br>
<br>"Yeah, that is why Bruce wondered if you had taken steroids since you were a rail 
when we last saw you. So what is the deal?" David asked finally.</br>
<br>"I... I'm not sure. I'm going to go in my room for a few minutes and check something 
out. I'll be back out in a few minutes to do whatever with you guys, so have a seat and 
relax."</br>
<br>As Luke got up, he felt the new and added tightness in his crotch and looked down, 
seeing a huge bulge in his pants. A huge grin came over Luke's face and was definitely 
needing to get in his room to discover what exactly was going on.</br>
<br>"H... hey Luke..." Bruce struggled to get out.</br>
<br>"Yeah Bruce, what's up?" I replied, wanting to get into my room as quickly as 
possible.</br>
<br>"I'm... I'm just curious, but what is up with your teeth?" Bruce asked.</br>
<br>Luke looked at Bruce with a raised eyebrow, confused by his statement. "What are you 
talking about?"</br>
<br>"Your teeth man... they look like they are fangs!" David said with gusto.</br>
<br>Luke ran his tongue over his teeth, feeling exactly what they mentioned, but played it 
off... not knowing how they would take the news about the wiki and what not. "No... my 
teeth are fine, I think you guys are seeing things." Luke said as he walked into his room 
and closed the door behind him.</br>
<br>Luke headed straight for the computer, looked over the information on the Wiki and 
saw that all of the stats there matched what was there, but mentioned nothing else about 
any part being a werewolf. Remembering what had happened a few minutes ago with his 
ears changing from werewolf in appearance to human, Luke thought about his ears being 
like a werewolf's again. Like clockwork, his ears elongated, coming to triangular points and 
covered in fur. Then, something started to happen that Luke was not expecting... he felt 
different, more primal and felt as though he wanted to explore this new side of himself. 
Thinking about being a werewolf, Luke felt that animal side of him come to the surface, 
spawning something Luke only half expected.</br>
<br>Luke's hands grew thicker, puffier as his fingernails grew out to black razor sharp 
claws. Thick pads of skin forming on the palms of his hands, his feet swelling and 
changing to paws at the same time. The hair on his body thickening, forming thick reddish 
brown fur. His muscles swelling even more, pushing the fabric to its limits, as tears start 
happening everywhere. Feeling immense pleasure from the change, but discomfort from 
being stuck in clothes that no longer fit, Luke tore at all the clothes and they fell to the 
floor around his changing body in a huge clump. Seein his body changing right in front of 
him turned him on even more than he felt before. Luke smiled a toothy, fang filled smile as 
he looked at his once average member. Now instead of his meager five and a half cut 
inches when he was hard, he was seven inches while still being flaccid. Luke even noticed 
that his underwear was starting to get drenched by the copious amount of pre that was 
freely flowing from his cock. Loving the way cum and pre tasted even before all of this, 
Luke sneaked a clawed paw down his undies, coating it in the stringy fluid and watched as 
the thick string extended from his cock head to his finger as he brought it to his mouth. As 
he tasted his own juices, his eyes lit up and loved how sweet and flavorful it was. Luke 
moved quickly to get his underwear off as his body continued to change. As Luke went 
back and forth from his cock and clawed finger tasting his fluids, his body became 
completely covered in fur. Wanting more than just pre, Luke grasped his cock and began 
stroking, bringing his cock to full attention. Feeling and watching it surge to life, growing 
further than before, to the same length, but as thick as an empty toilet paper roll. Enjoying 
how electric he felt while strokin his cock, Luke didn't notice his face pushing out into a 
lupine muzzle or his pointed ears migrating to the top of his head while his teeth 
lengthened even more into fangs, while his nose turned black and moist. The feelings of 
everything was overwhelming, as his cock grew to eight inches and thickened to the size of 
a forty ounce beer bottle while his balls grew to the size of tennis balls, primed and ready 
to cum a lot. As his transformation neared its end, he felt his tail grow rapidly from the 
base of his spine and shot out a gallon of cum all over his room, coating almost everything 
as he howled in pleasure.</br>
<br>Wondering what the hell was going on in Luke's room, Bruce and David went to the 
door and opened it to see Luke in his werewolf form, tongue hanging out of the side of his 
muzzle, cum dripping from his still throbbing, massively human cock.</br></p>
