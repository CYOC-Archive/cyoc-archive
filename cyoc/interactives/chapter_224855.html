<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I did attend his eighteenth birthday though. I stripped naked as soon as I arrived. After all, that was how I fit into the family. Mr. Corcoran greeted me as part of his family. He hugged me and squeezed my butt cheeks. Then he turned around while lifting my cock and said, &quot;Look who&#39;s here, Nick. It&#39;s your trophy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick ran up and hugged me. Then he held my balls as he said, &quot;So glad you could make it.&quot; He kept a firm grip on my balls as he led me to the pool where everyone else was. &quot;Look who&#39;s here. It&#39;s my trophy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone came up and shook my cock. I thought about how rarely anyone shook my hand anymore.<br />
<br />
Some of the guys were swimming and some of the them were naked but few of them were jocks. Most of Nick&#39;s friends were too young.<br />
<br />
Jared, one of Nick&#39;s friends, had already found out he would be a jock but he wore a swimsuit because he wasn&#39;t comfortable about it yet. He asked me how I was able to handle being displayed and pawed so much. I told him, &quot;You get used to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick sat at the table so I stood behind him in easy reach. I just stood there like the trophy I was even though technically, I was off duty or free of whatever made jock season work. It was part of my identity now. I still had at least two more seasons to go before I would truly be free but I had been researching how to extend my time as a jock for at least one more year. Nick would occasionally reach back and play with my cock from time to time.<br />
<br />
My dad decided to stand beside me with his arm around my shoulders. He whispered how proud he was of me.<br />
<br />
Jase sat on just the other side of where I stood and he too would occasionally reach over and play with me. Sometimes it was like I was no longer his brother. I mean we still did brotherly things but from time to time, he forgot I was his brother and thought of me as just a trophy.<br />
<br />
Nick started opening presents. He got some games, some clothes, some gadgets and some sports gear. Mr. Corcoran gave Nick a payment toward the new car he was saving up toward. Then he got to my gift which was just a very decorated envelope. He already knew what was in it because it had become a tradition. He opened it and it was a contract giving him ownership of me for the rest of his birthday party.<br />
<br />
I bent over, pulled my ass cheeks apart and opened my mouth before I froze in place. I made sure I could continue watching the pool. Nick, of course, got first dibs fucking my throat before fucking my ass. Several guys took a turn including my dad, Mr. Corcoran, Jase and Jared.<br />
<br />
I watched as the guys also played with each other and I noticed something strange. I thought about the moral rules regarding jock season, how it wasn&#39;t okay for guys to fool around with each other but it was okay for guys to fool around with jocks. Skinny dipping was one thing but the only guys that were played with were those who had already been declared jocks. No one played with Nick or Jase because they hadn&#39;t been declared jocks yet. Jared kept his swimsuit on but I watched him fidget with it as the guys encouraged him to take it off and let them play with Jared the jock. Jared never had a problem with skinny dipping until after he had been declared a jock and now he kept his suit on because he was reluctant to be played with. A few guys played with Jared anyway fondling his cock or his ass through his swimsuit but most of the guys, especially the other jocks, waited for Jared to pull his suit down of his own choice. The jocks, in particular, encouraged Jared to become one of them.<br />
<br />
Jared came back over to where I was and examined me. No one else was using me at the time. He ran his hand over my leaking asshole and fondled my cock and balls. He said, &quot;Nick, I&#39;d like to ask him a question.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick said, &quot;Sure.&quot; and I was able to talk again but otherwise remained frozen.<br />
<br />
With Jared&#39;s hand around my cock and balls, he asked, &quot;You really okay with this?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Yes. I&#39;m Nick&#39;s trophy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared asked, &quot;Do you enjoy it?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;I enjoy making Nick happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared asked, &quot;But doesn&#39;t it hurt?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Yes but it&#39;s a good pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
He just stood there for a bit running his hand across my leaky asshole. The he said, &quot;Hand me a piece of paper.&quot; Everyone gathered as Jared wrote up a contract giving Noah ownership for the rest of the birthday party. Jared said, &quot;Don&#39;t freeze me or transform me. Let me ease my way into this.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Noah laid down and Jared eased himself onto Noah&#39;s dick. Ethan yelled, &quot;Finally, we&#39;ve been waiting for you to get past your fear and become like the rest of us.&quot; Then Ethan and the other jocks wrote up contracts of their own. None of them were frozen and Nick released me from being frozen but because of the contracts of ownership, it was now morally acceptable for the jocks to get fucked.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Corcoran continued on as if nothing was going weird even though Mr. Corcoran fucked a few jock asses himself. I thought about how it was like an orgy except that, because we were owned jocks, it didn&#39;t qualify as an orgy. Morals stated that sex outside of marriage was a sin and many even condemned masturbation or the use of toys but the use of jocks seemed completely okay with everyone.<br />
<br />
I thought about history. Although the history books clearly stated how jock season had been around for a long time, there was a lot of ambiguity. I wondered if a Mandela effect was going on because in my memories, there had never been any reference to jock season anywhere, not even in history books until a year before I became a jock. It seemed to me like that is when all the history books changed and even then, the changes to the history books were ambiguous, not saying how or when it started. There were also a lot of inconsistencies as different historical figures were declared to be jocks but there were almost no stories about them being hunted or spending time as trophies. There were also no explanations about the morality of jock season. The moralists wrote as if there was no such thing as jock season, writing that sex outside of marriage was wrong but never writing why fucking a jock was an exception. But I couldn&#39;t find any proof that jock season had only begun recently.<br />
<br />
So I didn&#39;t have a choice but to keep going along with it.<br />
<br />
Then Mr. Corcoran made an announcement. &quot;I got the letter but was saving it for your birthday, son. You have been chosen. You are officially a jock.&quot; All the guys cheered and stroked Nick&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
My dad followed up with an announcement. &quot;I also got the letter for Jase. You have also been chosen. Both my sons are officially jocks. I&#39;m so proud.&quot; More cheering with stroking of Jase&#39;s cock. Then they lifted Nick and Jase on their shoulders and paraded them around the pool.<br />
<br />
Ethan yelled, &quot;Hurry up and write a contract, Nick. I want to be the first inside you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick said, &quot;No, I want my trophy to be the first inside me. He was my first trophy and the first one I stuck my dick inside. I think it only fitting that he should open up my hole.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan said, &quot;But you own him right now. How can you contract for him to own you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick said, &quot;I&#39;ll contract for you to own me, Ethan. Just let my trophy go first. What about you Jase?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jase said, &quot;I&#39;m going to contract to let my dad own me.&quot;<br />
<br />
So the contracts were written and my dad and I prepared to do the deeds. I&#39;d never stuck my cock in another man&#39;s ass before so I asked the other guys for tips. They told me to use lube.<br />
<br />
As I slid into him, he started to scream, &quot;No, get it out of me. That hurts. I don&#39;t want to do this anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jase turned to him and said, &quot;Calm ow down ow, Nick. Ow this is just ow what we wanted ow. We made it ow. We&#39;re jocks ow. This is ow our reward ow.&quot;<br />
<br />
I watched my brother stoically taking being plowed by our dad and I felt so proud of him. I reached over and stroked Jase&#39;s cock but I stopped plowing Nick. He wasn&#39;t being a good jock.<br />
<br />
I told Nick, &quot;This is what we are. We are jocks. We are the best of men. It&#39;s only right that we let men appreciate us for how masculine we are. Look at Jase, at how well he&#39;s taking it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick turned to Jase, &quot;But it hurts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jase said, &quot;Ow, it&#39;s a good hurt ow.&quot;<br />
<br />
That did it. Nick calmed down and even started smiling at me. I finished plowing him. I also stroked his cock.<br />
<br />
Then the three of us got in a huddle looking into each other&#39;s faces while our butts were out for anyone who wanted them. We smiled at each other, encouraging each other and bonding over this. We were jocks.<br />
<br />
We got some pictures of the three of us naked without cleaning up first. Both Mr. Corcoran and my dad wanted to post these pictures to show how proud they were of their jock sons.<br />
<br />
Then Jase and I made love. I stuck my cock between his legs and he stuck his cock between my legs as we kissed.<br />
<br />
I wondered if I had become gay. Society didn&#39;t want gay jocks. I&#39;d lose my value as a trophy if I turned gay.</p>
