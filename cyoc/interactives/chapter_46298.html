<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh looks around a moment and then back at the guys, “well, I think I know what you guys came here for.  So, lets hit one of the strip clubs.”  The boys all yell and cheer Josh’s name.  “You are a jolly good fellow,” Chase pats him on the back.<br />
<br />
The four of them make their way through the park, passing up rides, funhouses, arcades, games, and pool halls along the way, but they finally reach the far end of the park.  The strip club’s music was so intense it rumbled the ground outside and the neon lights pointing in only got them all more excited.<br />
<br />
The crossed the threshold from the outside through a small hallway with boys leaving and going in with them.  They end up in a massive club floor that is quite full of men already, but the men weren’t what interested them.<br />
<br />
Several enclosed booths held exotic young women dressed only in a sweet seductive smile.  Two booths were right at the entrance and the girls gave a welcoming gesture with their hands while dancing.  “Oh my god, this is everything I’ve ever wanted,” Chase yells.<br />
<br />
The bar stretches all the way around the club, with topless women serving drinks and dancers all around.  The center stage was empty, but boys had gathered around it, in anticipation with drinks in hand.<br />
<br />
Josh and the rest make their way to some empty spots at the bar.  On the other side of the counter, passed the booze, a dancer mover her hands all over her body, as if just for them.  Then the server came by, “what can I get for you fine young men?”  The guys were too busy staring at her and the girl behind her to answer, but Josh manages to break his concentration, “um, just beer is fine.”  She smiles and pulls four empty glasses from under the counter and fills them to overflowing.<br />
<br />
She sets them down in front of them, “enjoy.”  Josh takes a long sip of his beer as do the rest.  Then the music stops and a spotlight comes onto the stage.  The crowd goes nuts as the lights in the club dim.  The curtain at the end of the stage ruffles a bit and a girl sticks her head out.<br />
<br />
She’s a beautiful blonde, but she’s wearing a strange headband with a pair of donkey ears on it.  She’s low to the ground, but as she emerges, the boys see she’s on her hands and knees.  The girl crawls out from the curtain, revealing her body covered by a small bikini.  The crowd cheers and as she clears the curtain, the boys can see a long tail dangling from the back of her bikini bottom.<br />
<br />
“This is great,” Justin yells, “wooo!”  The girl crawls out to the stage floor and then sits up like a dog.  She shakes her chest back and forth a bit and then reaches behind her.  Her top pops off, and her breasts pour out of them.  The crowd again cheers wildly as she moves her hands all over them.  Josh reaches for his beer and notices that the booth behind them in empty.  He scans the room and all the booths are empty, and the servers have all vanished.<br />
<br />
He looks back as the girl on stage gets back on her hands and knees and wiggles her bikini bottom off.  Josh cheers for her, but the crowd has a mixed reaction when they see her tail is connected to her body.  It sways back and forth as she stands.  The boys at the stage look up in awe of her beauty as she takes off her headband, leaving the ears on her head.<br />
<br />
She runs her hands through her hair and her ears flex back and twitch as they go by.  She starts to laugh as she looks down at the drooling boys all around her.  The lights all go out for a moment, and then come back on full.  The girl is gone.<br />
<br />
The crowd boos and throws their glasses at the stage and bar.  “Hey, where are all the girls,” Miles yells.  The boys all notice the place is empty and start tearing the bar apart.  “Where are the girls.” A man yells throwing his glass at one of the booths.<br />
<br />
Josh leans back to dodge a glass flying by him, “hey, maybe we should leave.”  Chase agrees, “yeah this place sucks.”  Josh leans over to Miles, “hey, we’re all leaving.”  Josh looks at Miles who is holding his stomach.  “Hey man, are you okay?” Josh asks.  “I don’t feel so good, dude,” Miles groans.  A yell comes from across the club, “help me, someone help me, please,” a young boy calls out.  Josh looks over to get a look at an 18 year old young man.  The kid’s ears were brown and pointed.  “Something’s happening to me, please help.”  He pleads from the other men around him but they just push him off.  Then another man let out a groan as his lips thickened and turned brown.<br />
<br />
Josh looked at Miles who was gritting his teeth and then tilted his head back and wailed.  “Miles, what’s wrong?” Josh grabbed him.  Miles just groan his mouth wide open and breathing heavily.  The Miles’ jaw stretched outward, along with his nose.  As it did, his groans became deeper.  “ugghh… uggghhhhaaaa… uuhhaaaawwww,” Miles then took a deep breath, “EEEEEE AAAAWWWWWW.”<br />
<br />
Panic filled the club as boys started groaning all around.  One boy started growing brown fur on his back, another grew a tail.  They all started screaming and pleading for help.  Josh took a step back from Miles and backed into Justin.  He turned and saw Justin holding onto the bar standing on his tip toes.  “Justin, no, not you too,” Josh cries.  Justin looks at him, “help me Josh, please, help meee… ugggghhhhaaaa.”  Justin’s shoes rip and his pierced ears started to stretch.<br />
<br />
Josh looked around for Chase, and found him on the floor.  His whole body had sprouted fur and he was pawing at his clothes with a pair of thick black hooves.  Then Josh felt it, it started slow, like a dull ache and then hit him hard.  “Aaggghhhh,” Josh cries grabbing his ass as his shorts ripped in the back.<br />
<br />
Mile’s face had grown further into a muzzle, and his hands had darkened.  Justin scrapes his hooves on the floor and his new hooves on the bar.  He cries out, “Heeeelllp MAWWW  EEEEE AWWWW HEEE HAWW.”<br />
<br />
Chase’s clothes had ripped off, his body swelling larger.  A tail flips on the floor as his feet stretch and form into hooves.  He brays and cries, his tears matting his furry face.<br />
<br />
Josh’s ears stretch upward, and his blonde hair turns dark black.  The back of his shirt rips at the neck as it swells and his shoes pop open at the ends.  “Why is this happening.  I didn’t want to come here.  I just want to go hommmmmm.”  He puts his hands to his mouth to hold in what is coming.  His chest convulses and his mouth pushes outward.<br />
<br />
Miles and Justin are both braying wildly along with half the club.  Josh turns in time to see Chase’s human face disappear and can’t hold it in any longer, “HAAAWWW HEEE HAWWW HEEE.”  Josh falls to his hands which quickly fold up into hooves.  He kicks his hind legs back as his clothes tear braying, braying, braying.<br />
<br />
The donkeys of the club, enraged, kick up at everything, even each other.  They are tightly packed on all fours and can’t even get away from their own fear induced droppings.<br />
<br />
The donkey eared girl steps out on to the stage and looks around at the asses.  She looks to her rear, but her tail is gone.  “I’m almost human, just a few more.”</p>
