With a smile on her face Grace walked out of the club into the night, the night was still young as she looked at her watch. It was just pasted 10 on a Friday night but here the lack of funds and a little bit of her old nature came through. She had planned to head back to the dorm room, settle in and get some rest when she saw Lisa’s boyfriend Stan sitting on a bench beside the parking area. His head was in his hands as tears rolled down his cheeks, Stan wasn’t her type of guy she had seen his personality in high school and how he bullied some of the underclassmen but he had never been mean to her directly and even on his worse days he was miles below Lisa on her best days. He had paid her little to no attention which was what almost everyone had done, so she held no real anger toward him still seeing him cry into his hands was heartbreaking. <br />
He must have not heard her as she moved to stand in front of him.<br />
“I am sorry.” Said Grace as she stood before him. Stan looked up to see this silver hair goddess standing in front of him and for a moment said nothing. “You needed to know and maybe I should have sent it in a less public place, but you now see what Lisa really is like.”<br />
“What are you talking about, that message came from that short ugly girl Kim.” Stated Stan as Grace lost what little pity she had for this man. <br />
“You shouldn’t judge people.” Countered Grace as she turned to leave only to see Lisa, her friends and the other boyfriends standing nearby.<br />
“Grace.” Said Lisa confused <br />
“Who is she?” inquired one of her friends<br />
“And how did she get that shade of silver? I love it.” Added one of the more airheaded friends.<br />
“She is my new roommate.” Explained Lisa “She replaced that ugly fat Kim.”<br />
“Talk about a massive improvement.” Stated one of the boyfriends “Kim was ugly to no end.”<br />
“Really, Jim?” inquired Grace as everyone looked at her. <br />
“How do you know him?” inquired Lisa<br />
“Well no real point hiding it now…I am Kim.” Stated Grace with a grin as she watched the shocked expression on all their faces. “Yes, the short, fat and shy girl you bullied and beat upon for years, I am Kim.”<br />
“But…” started Lisa clearly confused.<br />
“Monster virus.” Explained Grace. “I changed my name after that and no I didn’t drop out of school. Also it was I who sent your assume now ex-boyfriend all those photos of you sleeping around with different guys. So that shy push over girl is gone, and she isn’t coming back.”<br />
“YOU BITCH!!!!” yelled Lisa as she leaped forward attempting to attack Grace. In response Grace jumped backwards and brought her hand up which began to glow with silver energy at once that energy shot out hitting Lisa, instantly Lisa began to float mid air and spin around as Grace took control of the gravity around her. “WHAT THE HELL!”<br />
“Did I forget to tell you as a Nympf I get certain powers not just this new body and I am special, I can control gravity.” Stated Grace in a musical voice. “In truth I am taking it easy on you, I could have made you weigh several tons and break every bone in your body killing you. However causing you to float in the air is just as good.”<br />
“Good thing you didn’t.” said a new voice as Grace and the others turned to see two police officers standing there. It wasn’t uncommon to see a cop or two on the party street and to make it better one of the cops was werewolf. “Because then we would have to take you in for murder, now put her down.”<br />
“Yes, officer.” Said Grace as she let go and gravity returned to normal, she even lowered Lisa to the ground instead of letting her fall on her ass in the parking lot.<br />
“She attacked us!” yelled one of Lisa’s friends pointing at Grace.<br />
“Lady we where standing here the whole time.” Stated the werewolf in a police uniform tapping the body camera on his uniform. “And while I disapprove of sending text messages in that way, she says there is nothing illegal about it but attacking someone is. As a monster she isn’t supposed to use her powers to harm anyone but defending herself is allowed and that is a clear case of defense.”<br />
“So lets handle this in a civilized way.” Stated the human officer “We take your names and we let you all go about your night because if we have too we will take everyone in and what will likely happen is charges on this women for attacking the other and reporting the use of monster powers to the higher ups most notedly your school.”<br />
Grace thought about it for a moment, she wasn’t sure what her school’s would look upon this, they would likely agree with her using her powers to defend herself was fine but the text violated some honor code stuff. She wasn’t sure and she knew Lisa didn’t want to go to jail and a drunken fight would likely get only a few hours of community services and a slap before the university got to her.<br />
“I am ok with that.” Agreed Grace<br />
“Fine.” Said Lisa as she glared daggers at Grace.</p>
