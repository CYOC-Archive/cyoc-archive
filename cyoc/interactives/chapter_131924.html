<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa&#39;s eyes fluttered open as she awoke from a nice dream that seemed very real. She remembered standing before Trevor with sunlight cascading down on his head and shoulders, almost making it look as though he was literally glowing with light. It seemed to be the future, as he looked older and more mature with a black tuxedo stretched over his well-muscled human frame. Melissa liked that in the dream and she remembered happily saying &quot;I do&quot; in the dream. And it was with that memory that she woke up with, and it left her with a rather happy smile on her face.<br />
<br />
And as she sat up in bed, she got the immediate sensation and reminder of the things that had happened the night before and particularly the parts that involved Trevor. She could feel some added weight on her chest, which she knew heavily related to Trevor. Before coming to Moon Lake, she could just barely make it into a B cup, which had served to make her a bit jealous of Moon Lake&#39;s female weres who seemed to start and D and got progressively larger than that, though it&#39;d never been enough to really make her focus on it.  But as she looked down to herself, she knew that that situation was now different.<br />
<br />
Resting there on her chest were two C cup breasts, and while she wasn&#39;t aroused, her nipples, even in human form were now longer than they were before.  It served to further remind her that she had nothing to be jealous about with regard to Moon Lake&#39;s weres, as she was now one of them too. She&#39;d had the most wonderful night with Trevor and became his werecow. He had been kind and gentle with her, he had made her feel safe in Moon Lake, and did his best to be a gentlemen when he&#39;d had plenty of chances to not be a gentleman and get away with it. That assured Melissa that Trevor was worth any effort to be with and that he had a personality that she found herself loving tremendously. The fact that she&#39;d held his attention, even as a normal human being made her happy, and thoughts of her and Trevor getting married, having children together, and growing old together seemed to cycle repeatedly through her head.<br />
<br />
Some of her old friends in Michigan might find it a bit silly, especially in the sense that Trevor was her first boyfriend, but Melissa didn&#39;t care about that. Not many of the boys in Michigan ever behaved as responsibly as Trevor did with her, and that counted for much. Maybe it was luck or something else, but it felt wonderful. Melissa wasn&#39;t going to give that up for anything. She was happy as a were and as a werecow, because she had Trevor and she had some otherworldly sense that if it was luck, it was extremely good luck in finding him. <br />
<br />
And thanks to him, many things had changed. Her breasts had grown larger, and she knew that with her were form based on the Canadienne, a breed of dairy cow, she still had a lot of growing to do before she finished growing up. She seemed to instinctively know the sizes werecattle grew to and that by the time she physically matured, she would be at a J cup. More than a handful, sure, but she seemed to have the mental assurance that her children in the future would be well nourished to grow healthy and strong. And as she stood up, the word &quot;strong&quot; also seemed to flash through her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;These are new,&quot; Melissa thought to herself as she looked in her bedroom mirror above her dresser and noticed her larger shoulder muscles, biceps, and even the outline of abs going down her belly.<br />
<br />
They weren&#39;t to the point where she really lost femininity, but she could easily see that all her muscle groups were bigger. Even in human form, it felt like she had the raw power to do a lot more than she ever could before. Especially with the fact that while she was well aware of being responsible and not being lazy, she&#39;d never had any sort of position that would have required her to do a lot of heavy lifting. And now it looked like she&#39;d gotten the results of the greatest gym membership ever. She smiled at that, and then went about her morning, collecting robe she&#39;d had for years and didn&#39;t fit the same as it used to, but it did cover her and made her way to the bathroom. She glanced into her father&#39;s room and found his bed was empty, though she thought she heard the sound of puttering coming from downstairs. But she put that aside and went about her business which was showering before heading down for breakfast.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Downstairs, Harold Jenkins calmly went about his morning. He&#39;d ultimately slept well enough, but in the end the stress that had been put on him by Alice Decrux&#39;s attempt to &quot;get even&quot; with him choosing Virginia over her had been enough that a lot of what he and Virginia had planned to do the night before just wasn&#39;t doable. He&#39;d well found that his libido had grown since becoming a weretiger and a good part of him was even fairly pleased with that, as Virginia was beautiful and someone that he&#39;d found himself falling for anyway. The otherworldly sensation that he&#39;d had that his deceased wife, Eliza, was accepting of him being with Virginia was still there and in a sense made him glad to have chosen her. Their personalities weren&#39;t a perfect match, but he figured that Eliza and Virginia would be friends if they&#39;d had the chance to meet in person.<br />
<br />
However, the thing had been the most stressful for him wasn&#39;t with Virginia. Harold was fairly sure that she was his future and that they would have a long life together. However, the thing that had worried him was Melissa and what had happened with her. He had some sense she had been drugged by Alice Decrux&#39;s trick, and had been desperate to find her when he&#39;d found out about it at the Halloween Dance. However, he never did find her and that made him worry as to how well he could protect her if Decrux&#39;s schemes could come so close to harming someone who was so precious to him. The only thing that had put him at &quot;ease&quot; was the end report that Melissa was with Trevor and was fine, which then lead to him getting the text message in which Melissa said she would be what &quot;she wanted to be.&quot; <br />
<br />
He guessed the message meant that Melissa would become a werecow to be with Trevor, which was something he though would happen eventually given how close the two had seemed. That didn&#39;t mean he was entirely ready for it, though, and at the same time he wanted to make sure he set a good example for Melissa and that her joining were society was by choice and not by force. For if her choices had been taken away, that&#39;d mean that Trevor had taken advantage of her being drugged. And while a were might have a higher libido than a normal human, that WASN&#39;T an excuse to simply go looking for sex. He remembered seeing something on the national news the previous April about a professor in Minnesota who&#39;d lost his position there for that very reason. According to the reporting, he&#39;d actually had relations with a student and got her pregnant, leading to a mess of court proceedings, but he couldn&#39;t remember the exact details at the moment. The point was that being a were was NOT an excuse to shirk other responsibilities.<br />
<br />
And all these worries stuck with him through the night and were there when he got up. He was rested, but his mind was still racing, and eventually he made his way downstairs, readied himself a breakfast and settled down with the paper. He was halfway through the national news section when he heard the upstairs shower come on telling him that Melissa was up. He nodded to acknowledge it, sipped his coffee and continued to read as he couldn&#39;t talk to Melissa while she was in the shower.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The shower was warm and relaxing, though it did alert Melissa to some other changes that occurred in her body after becoming a were. She&#39;d found that the hair on her head was a bit longer, but she&#39;d also found that the body hair under her arms and at the juncture of her legs had also grown thicker. The strange thing was that this sort of growth didn&#39;t actually include her arms and legs. They were still rather smooth, but her armpits and her bush would need a trim. Though, a part of Melissa wondered if that would even work, as according to the book that she&#39;d gotten on Moon Lake&#39;s weres, all mammal based weres grew fur when they transformed and were pretty much covered in fur. Just as Virginia and her father did when they turned into orange and black striped tigers and just as she did when she assumed her russet furred Canadienne form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would it all just grow back the next time I change?&quot; Melissa wondered to herself as she dried off with only the sound of the exhaust fan humming above her for company, &quot;Dad, Trevor, and Virginia could probably answer some of that... but I&#39;m not sure I want to talk to my dad and my boyfriend about feminine hygiene and I can&#39;t just bring that up off hand with my dad&#39;s girlfriend... that&#39;d be weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then glanced up to the ceiling above and gave a silent sigh that the house that her dad had bought for them was likely built for beings of a normal human&#39;s height, or maybe one of the smaller weres than werecattle. Before the Halloween Dance, Trevor towered over her in his werebull form and even stood taller than Virginia and her father in their were forms. However, after the Halloween Dance and her own entry into were society, she found that while Trevor was still taller than her, it wasn&#39;t by quite as much. Which meant that in her were form, she was probably way too tall for the interior of the Jenkins home in Moon Lake. If her skull didn&#39;t hit the ceiling, her horns definitely would. She&#39;d found that the Tyson home had taller walls and a higher ceiling, but then the Tysons were a family of werecattle and likely built the home when they established their farm, and thus built it for werecattle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means the only person I can really talk about this with is Virginia,&quot; Melissa said slowly to herself, &quot;Or maybe Erma... but I don&#39;t want to bother her this early in the morning. So... Virginia it is... as soon as I can figure out a way to ask her about it... delicately.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Melissa settled into the rest of the process of cleaning up and drying off. It ended with slipping into a clean pair of the clothes that Erma had loaned her the previous night, which Melissa was grateful for. There were some things in her old wardrobe that might fit &quot;okay,&quot; but she knew that there would be a lot that would need to change that would go along with all the growth and change that she went through when she became a werecow. She might be able to squeeze into anything that had plenty of elastic, and some things like tee-shirts would do okay, though she had to admit that with some of the older ones that she was outgrowing even before moving to Moon Lake, would probably be too small on her now. She could sort through that after breakfast and before directing her father to where the Tyson farm was.<br />
<br />
Once she was dressed, she soon made her way downstairs to find her father reading the paper and sipping from his coffee mug. He was in human form and wore an old University of Michigan tee shirt and a pair of blue pajama pants, but Melissa got the sense that he&#39;d heard her coming down the stairs when he lowered the paper and looked to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, dad,&quot; Melissa gave a weak smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, Melissa, I trust you&#39;re feeling well?&quot; Harold asked her  before taking another sip while Melissa made her way to start pouring herself a bowl of cereal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Melissa answered as she found a box of Cheerios and shook it to make sure it wasn&#39;t empty or close to empty. &quot;I&#39;m actually doing great.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not feeling woozy or hungover or anything?&quot; Harold asked, &quot;after what Decrux did to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Melissa managed, &quot;by the time Trevor and I got back to his house to get my things... I was starting to come out of it and after I became a werecow... I&#39;d burned through what remained. So, I&#39;m feeling good.&quot;<br />
<br />
She figured her dad was in typical &quot;dad mode&quot; and went along with making her breakfast. She poured her cereal and added milk and then placed it at the place opposite her dad. From there she got out a plastic glass and poured herself a glass of milk as well. When she sat down, she noted that her father was still focused on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Trevor didn&#39;t...?&quot; Harold asked with his voice falling away toward the end, mostly leaving what he implied unsaid.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Trevor was the perfect gentleman,&quot; Melissa told him, &quot;he&#39;s been good to me dad... kind, warm, caring... he&#39;s made feel safe and secure here and in that, I think I&#39;ve come to feel very much in love with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked down for a moment and swallowed hard, as she prepared to continue her answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially as there have been a few times we&#39;ve kissed or been close where he had EVERY opportunity to turn me and claim that he was too aroused to control himself or only backing down when I&#39;d made him,&quot; Melissa continued, &quot;but that never happened. He never forced himself on me and last night... he was looking for ways out of turning me, particularly while I was still under the effect of that drug, and reminded me of the promise he&#39;d made. I never had to force him or fight him... and I love him for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you really think he&#39;s the one for you?&quot; Harold asked as Melissa took her first spoonful of cereal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... it&#39;s not the same as werefoxes and their &quot;bonds,&quot; but yes, Trevor Tyson is the boy/man I want to spend the rest of my life with,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;I may not be a &quot;farm girl,&quot; but that doesn&#39;t mean I can love someone raised on a farm. And that&#39;s why I made my decision, took my pill and asked Trevor to turn me... because he is who I want to be with.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that her father stood up and moved to approach her, setting down his coffee mug as he did so, &quot;And you&#39;re happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unbelievably so,&quot; Melissa answered with a grin, &quot;are you and Virginia?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are happy, yes,&quot; Harold said slowly, &quot;actually... what would you say to us getting married sooner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t you guys have it planned for Christmas break?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sooner than that,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;or at least sooner than that under the new plan... Are you okay with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, as long as you&#39;re happy,&quot; Melissa practically jumped up to hug him as her answer was genuine. While she did miss her own mother and would miss her mother for the rest of her life, Melissa had also seen how hurt and almost broken her father had looked after her mother died. It had been like a part of him went a way and never returned. He hadn&#39;t smiled as much and he seemed more afraid that something bad would happen to her, and that was even before he&#39;d gained a weretiger&#39;s protective instincts. That was the thing Melissa had wanted reversed and was actually something that she felt happy for when he&#39;d started seeing Virginia as that had started to bring back the &quot;happy&quot; father that she&#39;d lost when her mother died. Seeing him smile and regain some humor was wonderful and Melissa welcomed anything that would make her father smile again... and Virginia had seemed to hit it off with him, which only made it even better.</p>
