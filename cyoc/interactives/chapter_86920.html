<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You floated nervously in place. The council&#39;s location was near another cove with a series of rocks that looked like they&#39;d been shaped to form what looked like a tiered platform that the present council members were resting on. Like every other siren, the siren members of the council were completely nude, as you, Elizabeth, and Selene presently were. The present sirens, like the ones you&#39;d first encountered with Elizabeth and under Florencia had fairly substantial breasts... a D cup or larger. There was one human woman there, and she was wearing a one piece swimsuit that almost looked &quot;formal,&quot; if swimsuits could be formal. The area was fairly calm and you couldn&#39;t even hear the waves as they hit these rocks. A part of your mind wondered why this meeting place was above the surface of the water, but then you remembered what Selene and Elizabeth had said about how the Councils of Sisterhoods worked. Occasionally human females were involved. You supposed that mermaids tolerated human females more and were willing to let women know of their existence, though they were probably also expected to keep the existence of mermaids secret as well. <br />
<br />
That was probably what helped allow sirens to dispose of men they&#39;d fed on. After all, you didn&#39;t see daily &quot;mummy&quot; reports on the news, and in the past two days, you had fed on two men after your transformation, your wife feed on three jerk neighbors and a police officer first thing in the morning, and Elizabeth had feed on more before the three of you began swimming to the location you were now at. These trusted were probably needed for that, and that actually made you curious as to who were the trusted in your home town. You didn&#39;t like having to do that. The men that you, Selene, and Elizabeth had fed on were all people and while they were jerks, you didn&#39;t think they deserved to be drained of their life force. It made you extremely hopeful that you could be a man again. You could accept that sirens needed to feed, but that didn&#39;t mean that you liked it, and you needed the Council to have Florencia undo the spell she had cast.<br />
<br />
You floated nervously watching the councilors discuss what you, Selene, and Elizabeth had told them. You hoped you&#39;d be able to become male again and you absentmindedly rubbed the side of your scarlet tail against Selene&#39;s silvery one, as if expecting reassurance from your wife. Selene did notice and hugged you from the side. You knew that Selene the same as you with regard to becoming male again. After a few moments, the council members turned back to you, Selene, and Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
It was the councilor who was the daughter of your wife&#39;s gynecologist who would speak. You knew your wife&#39;s doctor lived in a different town and had even met her once or twice when you&#39;d been able to go with her, though you now privately wondered how the doctor knew your wife was a fellow siren but your wife didn&#39;t know her doctor was one. Maybe there was some anatomical feature that could only be found through close examination. You could remember a second set of lips inside the vagina, you presently had, grip Harvey&#39;s and then his friend&#39;s penis when you fed on the two men after your transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Council is most shocked to hear that a head-sister would violate the rights of another head-sister,&quot; the councilor spoke, &quot;while head-sister Florencia may have seen you as an exile, head-sister Selene, she did still have the responsibility to see if you had either taken that role at the head of a new sisterhood... or if someone else had taken the steps to establish that, as my mother had.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think head-sister Florencia really cared about that, given our rivalry over how sirens should live today,&quot; Selene commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we remember the argument that you brought to us that lead to your exile,&quot; a different council member commented, &quot;that still does not excuse head-sister Florencia&#39;s actions... regardless of the differences between you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Councilors... can... can I be human again?&quot; you ask nervously.<br />
<br />
The five that were present gave a heavy sigh, which only made you feel more nervous. You could also feel Selene&#39;s nervousness as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is our hope, sister &quot;Michael&quot; but the way you were transformed and the agreement you entered into with head-sister Florencia is one that is typically used by lone sirens attempting to form their own sisterhood, even if it means transforming humans,&quot; the daughter of your wife&#39;s doctor spoke, &quot;normally when humans are transformed into sirens, it is done intimately... through sex, regards of the gender of the human. What you described was that you transformed before that could even happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gulped nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;This means that when head-sister cast the spell, she began releasing that transformative pheromone into the water and once you came in contact with it, the water around you began to bubble and reshape you into a new siren,&quot; the councilor continued, &quot;which is not typical where one human is transformed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She used a method used transform a group of humans,&quot; Elizabeth breathed, &quot;I thought something was a bit off when head-sister did it... but we could sense sister &quot;Michael&#39;s&quot; goodness and thinking that head-sister Selene was only an exile figured it was okay to transform someone who deserved it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... but... what does that mean?&quot; you asked, your voice becoming frantic.<br />
<br />
&quot;This method of transformation is designed to ensure that the new siren rapidly begins to produce her own siren magic and produces vast amounts of it,&quot; the councilor said slowly, &quot;and you are producing large sums of siren magic...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But she&#39;d given me twenty four hours to bring back and transform my wife, likely knowing that I didn&#39;t know that head-sister Selene was already a siren,&quot; you spoke, &quot;if I failed, she said she&#39;d turn me back and that sister Elizabeth was to kill me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister &quot;Michael,&quot; with the way you were transformed you&#39;re producing large sums of siren magic, this typically helps speed up the period of adaptation a human must go through when they become a siren,&quot; the councilor spoke, &quot;by the end of that twenty four hour period a transformed human has fully adapted and accepted being a sister and either asks for forgiveness and joins the sisterhood that transformed her or ends up as a lone siren and likely to repeat the same process in looking for sisters of her own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is usually a case of acceptance... that you come to like being a siren and desire to remain one,&quot; a different councilor spoke, &quot;this typically happens with every transformative spell... but the method used on you, sister &quot;Michael&quot; is designed to help you make large amounts of siren magic to rapidly adapt and accept it...&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked to them nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you feel when you were first transformed, sister &quot;Michael&quot;?&quot; a third councilor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scared... desperate... I only accepted it because I didn&#39;t want to die,&quot; you answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you feel after you feed for the first time?&quot; the third councilor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guilty and like I was a monster...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how about by the time you had dinner last night?&quot; the third councilor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nervous and wanting to be human again, but...&quot; you said slowly, &quot;I was felling okay with having sister Elizabeth as a sister for all the help she&#39;d given me... but I would have felt the same way if I were still human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how about when head-sister Selene needed to feed this morning and when you helped Elizabeth feed before you began swimming here?&quot; the third councilor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... head-sister Selene is my wife... I love her, and if she couldn&#39;t have felt my love as a man for some reason, I would have gotten her what she needed even if I was male,&quot; you argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;But how did you FEEL?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nervously gulp, &quot;I... I... They were jerks, and... and... I... found it better than... than feeding friends to my head-sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is how most sirens see our relations with humans,&quot; the daughter of your wife&#39;s doctor said slowly, &quot;we don&#39;t necessarily like draining people, but we accept that unless we can find true love with a man, we have to. Which means that you are beginning to accept what head-sister Florencia has done to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean... I&#39;m going to be like this forever?&quot; you whimpered. <br />
<br />
You could feel Selene and Elizabeth also growing nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; the councilor spoke, &quot;many transformative spells are permanent, as was the case with the teen girl that had been attacked... but some are reversible and from what you and sister Elizabeth have described, the spell head-sister Florencia used MIGHT be reversible... but the way it was used is so unorthodox that we cannot be certain until head-sister Florencia can be called here to answer for her violations on a fellow head-sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will have her transform &quot;sister&quot; Michael back?&quot; Selene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will have her try to,&quot; a different councilor spoke, &quot;should she succeed, she may be allowed to keep her sisterhood, though the members will be informed that head-sister Selene has a new sisterhood in the area and they will be allowed to chose who they want as their head-sister. If she can&#39;t, she will face possible execution and you, head-sister Selene will take over her sisterhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if I fully adapt before she gets here and I won&#39;t want to go back?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Given that we can feel that head-sister Selene would want you as a man again and we can feel your love for her,  that isn&#39;t fully likely,&quot; the councilor answered, &quot;while you may fully adapt and accept being a sister, you&#39;d also willingly be a man again to make your head-sister happy because your love for her is stronger than any magic or biology.&quot;<br />
<br />
That gave you some hope. The council did appear to have sided with your wife and would help you regain your manhood. They may not have sounded confident of success, but they were at least on your side with regard to the disagreement between your wife and Florencia and were confident that the fears that your mind would fully accept being a siren wouldn&#39;t be an issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe that is all the business for tonight,&quot; the daughter of your wife&#39;s doctor commented, &quot;One of our trusted... the trusted siren is to go and bring head-sister Florencia to us for tomorrow. And for tonight we will adjourn.&quot;<br />
<br />
The trusted that was siren dove into the water and was soon swimming out towards where you, Selene, and Elizabeth had come from. The trusted human waved to you, hopped into the water and began to make her way toward shore. The other councilors dove into the water. You then turned to Selene.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... where do we stay tonight?&quot; you asked, &quot;neither of us made any hotel reservations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll likely have to stay with one of the local sisterhood,&quot; Selene said to you, &quot;They can helpful... especially since you will need to feed again before Florencia can get a shot turn you back.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave a heavy sigh at that, as it only served to remind you how much you were changing. You didn&#39;t like the prospect of feeding on people, but you were beginning to begrudgingly accept it as though you had no other choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might not have to do that,&quot; came a new voice.<br />
<br />
You turned around again and found the councilor that was the daughter of your wife&#39;s doctor floating there beside the three of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t?&quot; you asked, &quot;... councilor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not in session, you may call me Sally,&quot; the councilor answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my parents named me, my father and mother named me,&quot; Sally replied with a sympathetic smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother fell in love? I&#39;d thought...&quot; Selene began.<br />
<br />
&quot;That you were the first to discover the way to avoid draining men?&quot; Sally commented, &quot;you were probably the first to go deliberately looking and find it in this general area. But sirens can fall in love just as easily as humans. Many don&#39;t go looking as deliberately as you did, because the men that usually find us are determined to be sleazes and are thus eaten. Most people don&#39;t fall in love with sleazes... but we can fall in love when the right man comes along... just as my mother, Julie, found with my father, Frank.&quot;<br />
<br />
You listened politely. Some of it was all a surprise. While you could expect Sally to have a name as she had a human parent who was still alive. But Florencia had said that they only got their names after a teenager gave them names centuries ago. You supposed it was possible that similar naming scenarios happened with other sisterhoods and their trusted or that Florencia&#39;s sisterhood spread the idea of names to other sisterhoods and it simply rolled from there.<br />
<br />
&quot;So there is a way where I won&#39;t have to eat someone?&quot; you asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sally answered, &quot;you did see the teen when you arrived, correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of you nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... about a week ago, he and his girlfriend were walking on the beach near where my sisterhood, I was just off shore and could hear their conversation,&quot; Sally explained, &quot;The boy, I believe is the sort of human that still believes in magic and myth  in ways that most humans don&#39;t. They recognize us when we feed on them from time to time... but by then its too late and they end up being drained. The boy seemed to believe in myths and that sort of thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like the kind of boy that traditionally ends up a siren,&quot; Elizabeth commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Commonly enough,&quot; Sally nodded, &quot;but that can&#39;t happen for him... for they got jumped by a gang out for money. The boy was punched and sent flying while the girl was grabbed and beaten. At that point the boy fled in terror essentially scared for his life, and when he fled the gang stopped to laugh and tease him, which allowed me to come closer and save the girl...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By turning her into a siren,&quot; you stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her injuries were such that unless she was immediately in an emergency room, she wouldn&#39;t fully recover, if at all,&quot; Sally retorted, &quot;and while my mom is a doctor, she&#39;s a specialist who works solely with pregnancies. The girl wasn&#39;t pregnant, so my mom&#39;s medical skill&#39;s wouldn&#39;t help in that regard. She had to be transformed so that she could then use a siren&#39;s means of feeding to heal himself... So while the gang was distracted, I came in and put out enough pheromones to essentially enthrall them. That then allowed me to transform the girl... and she fed on them shortly after...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh... I&#39;d suppose that if they were out to rape her, they got more than they bargained for,&quot; Selene commented.<br />
<br />
Sally nodded, &quot;Yes, yes, they did... but as with many humans who become sirens... she didn&#39;t react well to the fact that her means of feeding kills people. She&#39;s been with me and my mom and dad at our beach side home which actually wasn&#39;t too far from where the two teens were attacked. There we learned she still loves her boyfriend and wants nothing more than to go back to him. So... my folks have been going over the various rules to help adapt and the ways she can transform from her siren to human form and what to avoid...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like glasses of water and squirt guns?&quot; you asked, which surprisingly made everyone giggle a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not THAT vulnerable as the Splash movie indicates,&quot; Selene chuckled, &quot;getting wet does trigger the switch from legs to tail, but it needs to be something far more substantial than a glass of water, rain, or squirt guns... though we tend to be careful around water when we&#39;re trying to stay in human form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And much of it was to try and get her to be okay with not telling the boy what she had become... for her own safety... until the time was right and she could be certain that he wouldn&#39;t reject her,&quot; Sally continued her explanation, &quot;and we were getting ready for that reintroduction in the next few days when the boy stumbled into a council meeting in an effort to find his girlfriend, heartbroken and frightened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He knew about the Council&#39;s location?&quot; Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Somehow, yes,&quot; Sally nodded, &quot;we don&#39;t know how, but the fact he does know about us already helps the overall situation and in that he might might be able to help you all until head-sister Florencia can attempt to restore Michael&#39;s humanity and gender...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think he loves mermaids... sirens...?&quot; Selene gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;In an academic/fantasy style,&quot; Sally nodded, &quot;likely that he&#39;s fantasized about us... either being a &quot;merman&quot; or being with one or winning one over... that sort of thing. I could feel that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you think we could feed off of a boy&#39;s fantasies?&quot; Selene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It represents a different kind of love, which while different, is still love,&quot; Sally answered, &quot;and I&#39;m betting he would be willing to provide you with help you&#39;ll need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if that doesn&#39;t work?&quot; Elizabeth asked, &quot;Selene and I feed before we came here, but Michael... or Michelle... will need to feed again tomorrow before Florencia can even try to turn her back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Than my sisterhood can help you with any food you may require... though given the gravid state of your womb Selene, you might need to feed again tomorrow as well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Selene sighed, &quot;I know...&quot;<br />
<br />
You caught a hint of depression in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be honest... I was so used to having Michael to love and be loved by... that I&#39;d forgotten how hard pregnancy could amplify our hunger...&quot; Selene admitted.<br />
<br />
You blinked, but let it go. If Selene had been there when the teenage boy had named Florencia, Elizabeth, and the others that you had met, it be perfectly understandable to reason that over the centuries that Selene had been pregnant before. You privately assured yourself that she loved you.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is why I am setting this up,&quot; Sally answered, &quot;the boy might be able to help you three... at least temporarily... and he definitely will be able to help his girlfriend.&quot;</p>
