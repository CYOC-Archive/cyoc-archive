<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A ringing noise distracted him and picking up the phone, he heard his mom, telling him in a rushed tone, &quot;Spenser? This is mom. I'm sorry, but the company wants me to host a conference. I'll be gone for the weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, Spenser asked, &quot;Where's Heather?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your sister is at one of her friend's house and I've already spoken with her. She'll be spending the weekend with her friend, so you'll have the house to yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barely able to contain himself, Spenser nodded, and as he said, &quot;All right,&quot; he started picturing himself, spending the whole weekend alone, dressed and acting as like a girl with no one to bother him or cut into his fantasies.<br />
<br />
His mother was saying something and Spenser just barely heard her telling him about emergency numbers and how he could use her debt card if he didn't want to eat what was in the fridge.<br />
<br />
Telling her, &quot;Love you,&quot; Spenser listened as she told him she would see him Monday after school and then the line went dead.<br />
<br />
Hanging up the phone, Spenser did a silent dance and went to check on the laundry, forgetting that he had only put it in about fifteen minutes ago.<br />
<br />
Skipping to his room, Spenser stripped off his clothes and standing naked, he wondered what he should do. Going to the closet and retrieving his box of wigs, make-up and other cosmetics, he then sorted through the various clothes he had and after a moment, decided he wanted to go swimming.<br />
<br />
Tucking his penis and testicles back, wishing that they were actually inverted and that he had a vulva, Spenser tied the lower half of the bikini in place, making sure as he did so that there was no unsightly bulges.<br />
<br />
Satisfied, he selected the inserts he bought a couple years ago and tying the top part of bikini, he placed the inserts in the cups and standing before the wall-mirror, he shifted and struck posses until he felt he looked more like Heather and less like himself. Grabbing a towel, he started for the pool out back, but stopped in the bathroom to make sure none of his armpit hair, chest hair or leg hair had started to grow back.<br />
<br />
It was only as he was about to step outside that he remembered the wig and ten minutes later he was back, looking more like his sister than ever.<br />
<br />
For the next hour and half, Spenser spent the time either in the pool, longing next to the pool or speaking to the neighbour's kid, who was kind of cute and thought Spenser was actually Heather. Afterward, he went inside to find dinner, stopping to check on the dryer, which he had switched over about half an hour ago.<br />
<br />
Finding the clothes where dry, Spenser had to calm himself and force himself from stripping down right then and there and changing. Taking the clothes from the dryer, he hastily headed for his room.<br />
<br />
Inside, he shucked off the wig and carefully placed it on one of the mannequin heads to dry and then pulled off his bikini. Standing naked, he wondered if maybe he should first take a shower and after a moment's deliberation, he dumped his bikini in the laundry hamper and left the tank-top and pants where he had placed them when he had returned to his room.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, spelling strongly of his sister's body wash and under-arm deodorant, Spenser dropped the towel on the floor and looked at the clock.<br />
<br />
Noting the time was almost six, he asked himself, &quot;Wonder what I should have for dinner,&quot; as he moved toward the bed and picked up the pink tank-top, tracing the embroidery on the front and wondering who it originally belonged to.<br />
<br />
Shrugging, he pulled it on, noting that it was a little tight in the chest and showed off quite a bit of his flat stomach. Shrugging, he pulled on the pants, noting the section in the middle of the crotch looked a little like the panty-hose and tights he had buried in his top dresser drawer.<br />
<br />
Standing in front of the mirror, moving from one feminine pose to another, Spenser considered putting the inserts in and making it look like he had B cup, thought about taking off the pants and sewing up the backside, but instead yawned and stretched, feeling suddenly tired. Moving across his room, stopping to close his door, Spenser picked up strawberry blonde coloured wig, pulled it on and then lay down on his bed and within moments he was asleep.<br />
------<br />
<br />
He wasn't sure which woke him up; the pressure on his bladder or the sore and tender feeling in his chest.<br />
<br />
Sliding out of bed, Spenser stumbled across the room and after moments thought, flipped on the light. Immediately he clapped a hand over his mouth to keep from screaming when he saw the young girl standing in his room.<br />
<br />
Realising that it was his mirror, Spenser yawned and looked toward the clock. Noting the time at about eight, he reached up and attempted to remove the wig, thinking he maybe needed a change in hair colour, but stopped as he felt his fingers slide through real hair and then pull on actual hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; he thought as he turned back to the mirror, catching just a flash of what appeared to be a tail.<br />
<br />
Turning sideways, taking in the whitish-pink tail extending out from the seat of his pants, Spenser repeated the comment of, &quot;What the...&quot; as he reached down and started to slide the pants off.<br />
<br />
Immediately he stopped as he took in the smooth and flat skin. Hiking up the pants, he looked back at the mirror, taking in the girl reflected back, noting that she appeared to be about eleven, had strawberry blonde hair...heavy on the blonde part...pierced ears that seemed more rounded then normal at the top and feet that looked more like an animals...Spenser did not really know the word Digitigrade.<br />
<br />
Repeating, &quot;What the...&quot; wondering how it is that he has turned into a female, who looks crossed with a mouse, he turns away from the mirror and telling himself, &quot;I need to use the bathroom,&quot; he grabs the area between his legs and stumbles out of the room, barely noticing that the sign on his door now reads 'Kai's Room' instead of 'Spenser's Room', absently rubbing his chest, wishing the sore and tender feeling would go away, failing to realise that what he was rubbing where breast buds.</p>
