<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James and Nick started to pace the beach looking for a quick fuck or just some fun.  Today wasn&#39;t to be there day though, the beach was quiet and barren.  Their usual prey, wasted white girls with low self esteem just weren&#39;t in season it seemed.  After a good bit of bromancing over their shared dismay and some exercise routine comparisons the two jocks felt a strange pain blossom from their head across their body.  Jason was hit first, and hardest, he crumbled to the ground as his body an clothes began to change.  His loose jock clothing began to shrink and choke him before his muscles receeded back into the tone teen skater muscles.  His pecs sucked themselves in and his arms deflated keeping mere fraction of their former size.  The mesh basketball pants shifted and thickened, rips appearing in the sides that slowly formed into pockets.  As his shoes shrank back into a ratty pair of worn skater shoes his feet shrank with them.  His hair darkened a bit and fell back out in long unkept locks the way he had once liked it.  Finally his face softened and his eyes dulled their sharp gaze back into the sensitive if shocked skater.  He startled as if suddenly shaken awake and the memories of his time as a jock made their way painfully to the forefront.  <br />
<br />
Nick stated at his new friend turned gay skater in disgust but wasn&#39;t far behind.  His jock outfit merely vanished from existence as he was returned to his skimpy surfer threads, his shirt evaporated to reveal a tan but smooth and only tone chest, devoid of the great mounds of muscle he once possessed.  His arms and legs shrank and his shorts formed into a tight speedo meant to show off his bulge which was still impressive even if it lacked the girth of a true jock.  As his face lost its hard angles and tightened anger his own memories returned.  He looked around in fear and wonder.  &quot;What the hell happened to me dude?  And what happened to you?&quot;  <br />
<br />
James sighed knowing he&#39;d have to confess the whole story to this innocent young man, including how it was all his fault - all of this beginning with his hubris and desire for revenge.  He explained the story of his magical device and what he planned to do with it as Nick watched in awe, it sounded unbelievable but changing from a 260 pound homophobic jock to a 160 pound surfer twink may have opened his mind a bit.  &quot;So basically I was cursed, to become a straight guy whenever I&#39;m horny, and im also contagious.  That&#39;s what happened to you.  I&#39;m sorry.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve gotta go see my baby, Corey he must be so worried about me!  I can&#39;t believe I left him alone!&quot;  Nick was practically hysterical waving his arms as he pined over his lover.  James just frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t go back to him... You&#39;ll just change again if you get turned on and then you&#39;ll make him straight too.  Do you really want him to suffer the same changes we do?&quot;  Nick nearly cried but he also wanted to protect his boyfriend from his fate so he agreed.  He needed to leave but he left his street clothes with Corey so James agreed to go with him to the mall down the street to buy something to wear.  It would also give them time to talk about what happened and maybe figure something out.  <br />
<br />
When they reached the mall James and nick went to a secluded discount clothing store in the back to get some stuff for Nick.  James lended Nick some money for shoes and a shirt, after all it was the least he could.  As they walked around a bit looking for food they passed a group of cocky looking Latinos emerging from. Sporting goods store.  They were laughing loudly and bellowing at each other in a rapid mingling of Spanish and heavily accented English.  Most of them were decked in blind and had the sides of their head shaved.  They could&#39;ve all been related.  Good chance some were but they all seemed to look the same.  Nick mentally rolled his eyes but James made a few subtle looks.  He had a bit of a thing for Latinos.  Secretly he was kinda jealous of their brash and loud attitudes, the close brotherhood they bore and their ability to just be obnoxious in manor and wardrobe.  Quickly James felt his dick responding and rising to attention, before he could distract himself he felt a familiar pain rush through him and doubled over.  <br />
<br />
Nick immediately realized what was going on and rushed to his companions aid, clasping his back.  &quot;James come on, just focus on who you are, on skating.  Try to fight this curse please don&#39;t go straight on me now dude!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t I can&#39;t fight it... It&#39;s too late amigo, and you&#39;ll be joining me soon anyway fag.&quot;  He said as a deep Spanish accent began to tint his words.  Nick stepped back in fear and surprise as he watched the small skater swell with muscle.  His tight elements shirt began to tear in several places exposing thick, Latin caramel colored skin.  His arms brimming with new muscle and his calves and thighs rapidly expanding, far too quickly for his tight cargo shorts.  They unraveled, the threads spiraling down his dark and now much hairier legs.  As they crisscrosses and thickened across his flesh the material darkened and morphed.  The shorts continued their to lengthen down to his shoes becoming a pair of dark wash jeans.  Golden strings erupted and stitched themselves in and out of the jeans in elaborate patterns.  James groaned in pain as his legs expanded beneath, raising his height drastically.  <br />
<br />
In the gaps in his torn shirt thick heavy pecs the same caramel color could be seen pushing forward.  His stomach grinded into a slab like set of abs with a dense and dark treasure trail of bristly black hairs leading down to his engorged member which was now black as well and longer and thicker, surrounded by a Black Forest of pubes.  <br />
<br />
He felt his desire and confidence growing.  His torn vans stretched and tore as his feet swelled and darkened.  Large brown toes briefly protruded out the front before he shoes caught up with them, in a sense.  Most of the material simply disappeared leaving only the bottom whic thickened and turned into a cheap black material, a single black arc formed and crossed over each foot to meet the other side and a white nike swoosh logo appeared on each one forming a pair of large slides.  Beneath his socks sprouted larger to fit his feet and grew further up his legs.<br />
<br />
James struggled internally but a growing part wanted this, knowing soon it would be over.  He&#39;d be one more Latino guy, he&#39;d be lost in the brotherhood happily stalking with his amigos.  Free of worries.  His mind numbed with his thoughts and cares fleeing into oblivion.  English became harder, math was impossible.  School smarts weren&#39;t important anyway.  Not out here, he knew what he needed to survive.  Most kids who grew up in his neighborhood were gang bait but not him, he and his homies were too strong for that shit.  Sure he&#39;d get in some trouble, steal some money for weed or beat up a fag or preppy little cock sucker sometimes but he did his best in the struggle.  His dad never taught him a fucking thing about how to be a man before being deported back to Mexico and his mom barely kept him and his brother and sister warm in winter working minimum wage at the Mexican cafe downtown.  She didnt know English and she sure ain&#39;t go the time to learn.  Can you blame Jose for being this way?  He grimaced feeling the new memories override him and change his personality to shield himself in cockiness.  His arms continued to swell and as the skin darkened down to the tips of his fingers ink traced itself across his arms forming his most recent tattoos.  Respect was written across his left arm with a fleur de les and his moms name imprinted on his right.  His knuckles cracked and swell inside of his enlarged hands which now sprouted years of scars from fights and falls.  The remains of his tattered shirt seemed to liquify, oozing down across his hard muscles and sealing in the gaps.  It swelled across his arms and began to solidy into an XXl soccer jersey.  He loved the bagginess of it and how it let his taunt muscles breathe.  <br />
<br />
He felt his face morphing, the flesh being sculpted like play doh as it darkened like the rest of him.  His nose broke and suddenly widened, feeling as though it had been smashed in with his nostrils flaring out to the sides taking a more ethnic look.  His small lips ballooning, swelling and becoming thick and puffy as they jutted out in a near permanent sour scowl.  The hair on top of his head gelled itself up magically while the sides buzzed themselves to nothingness.  While all this was happening his sense of brotgerhood swelled and his last gay thoughts were purged by daydreams of hot Latina babes with big brown asses begging for his attention.  He smirked a bit.  A strange wind circled his neck as a gold rosary materialized. A gift from his grandmother when he turned 18 and a symbol of pride amongst his boys.  He wasn&#39;t too deep into that religious shit but he wanted to make sure he was on gods good side and more importantly his grandmas, that loca woman was a lot scarier with a switch.  Blinking his brown eyes as the last memories fell into place, he sneered at the gay surfer besides him and ran off catch up with his boys.  Nick was alone again, lost in a mall with only his thoughts and fears, knowing he was doomed to change again soon himself.  The only question was when and whom he would become.</p>
