<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wondering what to do with her new life, Janet decided she wanted to join a new crowd, maybe one more...unique? She thought about it, and decided maybe she&#39;d try becoming a Goth. Sure, they oftentimes acted sour, but she knew they had to be at least somewhat happy with themselves. Otherwise, they&#39;d just be like everyone else. It’s not like what they are on the outside; it’s what’s inside that counts.  She imagined her ideal Goth self. She&#39;d be attractive, dark, sarcastic, but also have a kind heart on the inside. As she thought about it, the amulet began to shine bright, and her transformation would now soon begin!<br />
<br />
Janet felt her body change quickly. Looking down, she noticed her skin had become much paler, but was also smooth and beautiful. Her shoes and stockings disappeared, while her shirt became a darker shade of red and began to crawl up her chest, exposing her stomach. Her hair had grown a little longer, as well as changed colors, becoming a little darker. Lastly, her breasts seemed to expand, leaving her feeling a little bit uncomfortable. Still, the changes were working!<br />
<br />
Janet shrieked, as the changes seemed to accelerate. Her shirt became nearly nonexistent, now just a gray, intricately detailed piece of clothe covering her shoulders. Her hair continued to darken, but remained brown. The hair also styled itself, becoming longer and spikier, something that is suitable to any gothic person. To her dismay, she now only had her underwear on...which looked different from hers! They were black and lacy. She didn&#39;t want to be naked!  She hopes that these changes would give her some new clothes; otherwise she would become a nudist.<br />
<br />
Janet continued to change. Her breasts increased in size once again, now they were pretty large. Her hair continued to get darker, and was now nearly black. A black striped skirt appeared around her waist, making her feel slightly less, well, nude. Her face became softer and thinner, while her eyes became a dark green. They looked striking. She felt her mind change, as biting wit and cynicism filled her.  Dark and sarcastic thoughts entered her head as the happy minded Janet slowly faded in the back of her mind.  She could feel the mental changes happening and although it was a bit different, at least she could feel cheerful about it.<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s breasts grew a little more now. Her hair changed colors, now a lighter shade of black. It also restyled itself, covering her left eye, making her look more intimidating to others. She loved the look of it. It gave her a mysterious feel, like she had some kind of magic eye under there or something. Those preps wouldn&#39;t consider dressing like her. Black heeled boots appeared on her feet. She felt great now. Dressing like this was a lot of fun, and she couldn&#39;t wait to get to school and meet with her Goth friends!<br />
<br />
Janet was now very happy with her changes! She finally had a shirt on. It was black, and reached up to her breasts. Her old &quot;shoulder shirt&quot; fused with it, forming a nice top with a cleavage window...that she was proud to show. Her hair darkened even further as well. Fishnet stockings began to crawl up her legs. She felt fantastic now! It didn&#39;t take much effort for her to look great, and she loved the cool and mysterious thing she had going on. Despite her sarcastic attitude, she was actually a very dedicated student and very friendly to those who got to know her. Soon, she&#39;d have her full outfit, and then it was time to go hang out!<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s transformation was now complete. Fishnet stockings now covered her arms as well, and black gloves covered her delicate and beautiful fingers. The fishnet stockings on her legs grew longer, now covering everything. She now wore cute glasses and a skull hairpin, giving her a surprisingly cute look.  The world around her changed after all the clothes and body was changes and it was a watery vision.  When the world returned to view, she was in a room suitable for a gothic girl complete with a dark purple bed, skull curtains on the window, books filled with dark poetry, a closet filled with gothic clothing, and a bass guitar with a raven on the surface.<br />
<br />
As everything changed, new memories started to resurface.  Her name is now Jasmine and she was 100% Goth all the way.  Her friends are Goth; she spends her time writing poetry and practicing her bass for a Goth band, and hangs out in all the places Goth people go to.  Yet for some reason she does have a happy side to her and even if she has the sarcastic feel, she’s a cheerful person underneath the dark attire.  She was now ready for anything! With her Goth clothing and life, she could stick it to the man and still have a cute, unique look. While she was nearly always sarcastic, she had a truly kind heart, and hoped to help others for a living somehow, whether through medicine or simply volunteer work. Whatever the case, this Goth was now ready to go!</p>
