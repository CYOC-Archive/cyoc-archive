<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I so wanted to play dress up and the news about what had happened caused me some hope, &quot;Maybe there is a way to reverse this,&quot; I thought. Looking at my mommy, I asked her if she had the amulet.<br />
<br />
She looked puzzled and then asked, &quot;Don't you have it honey?&quot;<br />
<br />
I shook my head and felt suddenly like crying. Seeing this, mommy consoled me with the fact that we’ll get it back. It was then that we noticed that at some point Thomas had disappeared from the room. Looking into the mirror, seeing that I hadn't transformed anymore, I left my room and went running through the house, calling, &quot;Thomas? Thomas, were did you go?&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking in the bathroom, I felt suddenly really weird. &quot;What was going on here?&quot; I thought.<br />
<br />
Rushing back to my room, I saw that my mommy had also left and my sister was still there. Looking at Katherine, I asked her, &quot;Where's mommy? Where is my friend Thomas? They were right here a minute ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine looked at me strangely, still not saying anything about the fact that I was wearing her bathing suit. Finally she said, &quot;I don't know any Thomas and if you don't want to play dress-up with me, just say so Marcus.&quot; With that said, she turned and ran to her room, slamming the door as she went in.<br />
<br />
From somewhere in the house, I heard mommy's voice saying, &quot;Stop slamming doors!&quot;<br />
<br />
Peeking into Katherine's room, I saw her sitting on the floor, hugging a doll. Entering, I said to her, &quot;I'll play dress-up and tea-party with you. Just let me figure some things out first; okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lip quivering, but a hint of a smile on her face, Katherine said it was okay. Closing the door, I began to go downstairs, wondering what was going on here. &quot;Reality has shifted more than once today and when I thought I'd started to get some answers, it shifts again.&quot; I think to myself. Scared, I grab myself and sigh that at least I still have a penis and testicles.<br />
<br />
I find mother in the kitchen and as I'm entering, I remember the swimsuit that I have on. Too late, mommy sees me in it, but doesn't say a thing. Instead she tells me, &quot;Dinner will be ready about six, okay sweetie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, I look at her and ask her, &quot;Mom, do you remember that cracked amulet I had a couple of weeks ago? Do you know what happened to it?&quot;<br />
<br />
My mother puts down the book she is going through and looking thoughtful for a minute, she shakes her head and asks me, &quot;Was that some sort of toy you had; because I don't remember anything like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at her, I asked if she had been doing any research on any type of amulet. She said no and the conversation continued forward. Finally annoyed, she told me go play with Katherine. <br />
<br />
As I left the room, I asked, &quot;Can Thomas come over tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at me strangely, she asked me, &quot;Who?&quot; which sent a shiver down my spine.<br />
<br />
Looking at her, I said, &quot;Never mind,&quot; and went back to Katherine's room to see if she still wanted to play dress-up and tea-party, which she did.<br />
<br />
It was during this time that I gained my second insight into not only what was happening to me, but also what will eventually happen to me. Namely when after I put on a pretty pink dress, my sister told me my pretend name was Ashley.<br />
<br />
Around six, mommy called us down for dinner, beef stroganoff, and after that, the rest of the evening flew by in flash and before I knew it, it was bath time and than bedtime. The one thing I was happy about was that I’d suffered no more mind slips and was not the center of anymore transformations. My room was another matter entirely.<br />
<br />
It had transformed even more and was so close to looking like a girl's room, it wasn't funny. While my sister had the whole Disney and princess theme, my room had begun to take on a Hello Kitty, princess and ballerina theme. Opening the closet, I saw that more of the labels had appeared. Now some of them read, 'Swimsuits', which now had the one piece bathing suit I was wearing earlier folded up in the cubbyhole, 'Beach and bath towels', that had the beach towel I used earlier placed inside it and 'DvDs', which there was a complete collection of Hello Kitty and a couple of princess DvDs as well.<br />
<br />
Seeing this, my mind made another attempt to take a slip, but I shrugged it off. Mostly because of what is saw sitting in one of the cubbyholes. Apparently something had been added; a complete stack of pull-ups, like my sister sometimes wore.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I heard a voice from behind me, my mommy saying, &quot;Marcus, you’re not dressed for bed. Well, hurry up and don't forget your dry-night. I don't want you having another accident.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she left, I pulled one of the pull-ups off the shelf and looked at it. The thing was clearly meant for a little girl, about age three. Scared, wondering why all this was happening, wanting it be undone, I pulled the diaper on and then put on my pajamas, which were thankfully still boy pajamas. Climbing into bed, I hugged the doll closer and just as I was about to stick my thumb in my mouth, mommy came back in and gave me a tuck-in. After she had left, I lay there in the dark for a bit, trying to sort everything out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll just have to try and get a hold of Thomas on Monday,&quot; I thought as I drifted off to sleep, snuggling closer to my dolly.<br />
<br />
Sunday passed and nothing new happened, which I was thankful for such small miracles. My room and closet still looked the same and I still looked like a very effeminate nine year old boy. On Monday, I got my next big surprise, when I was awoken by my mother and told to hurry up and get dressed. Pulling of the pull-up, glad that I still hadn't taken to wetting the bed at night, I pulled on a clean set of clothes, suitable for a nine year old male and headed downstairs for breakfast.<br />
<br />
After breakfast, I went out to wait for the bus. When it finally came, I thought that something was different about it. My suspicion was confirmed when it dropped me off at the elementary school. And just as I was thinking there had to be a mistake, the fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Hawthorne, called me into class.<br />
<br />
Scared, wanting to run, I heard, &quot;Marcus Ericson, get a move on. You’re going to be late.&quot; Not seeing anyone I knew, bothered by this odd turn of events, sighing heavily, I followed Mrs. Hawthorne into class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I can find Thomas after school.&quot; I thought; dread washing through me that he might not know me anymore. After all, reality did shift after I had confessed what had been going on, so there is a good chance that he might not know me. Feet heavy, hoping for no more incidents, I walked into class.</p>
