<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Mary was able to pick herself up, the first forced push came from between her scaled butt-cheeks, it took everything she had to hold it in as she squeezed her legs and buttocks together with all her strength.  Slowly, the cold simple truth of the matter dawned on her, there was now no possible way that she would be able to make it to the bathroom in time, even if she left everything here and just went straight for it.  In short, Mary was left with only one option.  <br />
<br />
‘Aahh.  Fuck it.  It’s not as if there’s anyone to witness it at the very least.’  Mary finally relented to her body’s demands as the leaned back and spread her legs out.  <br />
<br />
It began as a small trickle, as her bladder slowly relaxed itself, the liquid trickling out and soaking itself into the fabric her weight rested on.  Then with the opening made, the rest was pushed through and the stream became a torrent.  Mary couldn’t see this with her extended belly blocking the sight from her, but she certainly could feel it as her legs and ass pressed into a now-saturated cushion.  And as this occurred her bowels were being emptied, load after load of semi-soft waste tunnelling out of her only to be trapped between her ass and the couch.  <br />
<br />
A hiccup escaped from Mary during this.  Shame at what she was doing, what she had ended up setting herself up for, being forced to use the lounge couch as her toilet because she hadn’t thought her actions through properly.  And especially because for despite knowing just how disgusting an act she was committing, she didn’t hate it.  In fact, she was finding herself rather liking the feeling of letting herself go in such a manner, the feeling of her own waste being pressed into her as she did so.  <br />
<br />
The twin floods slowed, then finally came to a halt.  The smell and taste of her filth already mixed into the scents of the room as she leaned forwards and covered her eyes, struggling to steady her breathing and stop her shaking, which she couldn’t quite tell if it was through fear, shame, or thrill.  <br />
<br />
The minutes ticked by, and finally Mary mustered the strength to open her eyes.  She could feel the mess she’d made being mushed around as she shifted, which she tried to ignore as she gazed at the box.  <br />
<br />
‘I hope there’s a cleaning vial in you.’  She thought as she checked the compartments to see if there was anything that could help her.  <br />
<br />
While there was nothing to clean the mess with, save for the Wish Vials that she didn’t want to waste on something as trivial as this, she did come across a few that had escaped her attention.  <br />
<br />
One was a small compartment, thin and long, but empty save for a note:  <br />
<br />
This is the portable container.  It permits the owner to carry up to five vials (with the exemption of the Wish Vials) of their choosing, enabling their refill.  The refill time is longer at five minutes to fill from empty, but the vials can be changed to suit the tastes of the owner.  <br />
<br />
This was interesting, to say the least.  With this, she could carry at least a few of the vials with her, and not have to worry about carting the whole box with her all the time.  As for additional vials, her recheck of the Body Modifier Vials yielded some rather unusual results.  Two pairs of vials for instance would either induce or suppress her need to urinate and defecate, depending on how much of each she took.  And one last Vial set by itself titled ‘Speech Restoration’, its message stating that by using that, even in her current form, she would be able to speak as she had been able to as a normal human.  That was something she noted for later.  <br />
<br />
Though right now she wanted to be able to move easily again, so she selected the Muscle Gain Vial and took about a quarter of that.  The results were swift, as she felt her arms and legs thicken, the muscles swelling as new strength was poured into them, her neck thickening as her torso firmed up behind the wall of her guts.  The vial back in its original place, she rose far more steadily with her now having the strength for it, able to move around with much-improved ease.  Now Mary was beginning to feel better as she picked up the Breast Growth Vial, a fifth of that sufficient to push out her C-Cup breasts into impressive and still firm FFs.  Finally, she drained the contents of the Speech Restoring Vial.  <br />
<br />
“Finally.  I can speak again.”  She managed to make the words come out clearly, if raspy thanks to her different mouth and tongue.  “Hmm, I might keep this for a while.”  She added as she made for the bathroom, one task left.  <br />
<br />
In the shower, Mary was busy cleaning herself off, taking particular care to scrape every last piece of her body waste off of her legs and butt while she sang slightly off-kay to the music she played.  Despite her self-induced ‘accident’ that left her with a good deal of cleaning to get done, she had to conclude that this had been a pretty successful test-run of the vials.  <br />
<br />
It was close to a half-hour before she was done and drying herself off, a thick dressing gown around her as best as she could manage when she returned to her lounge, noting that despite the mess made, only one of the three cushions had really been affected, so at least the cleanup wouldn’t be too hard, even if she’d need a good deal of air freshener to take care of the smell.  Choosing the armchair to settle in, the box next to her and the still partially drained Snake Vial atop it, Mary could now relax a bit, and think about what she wanted to do next.</p>
