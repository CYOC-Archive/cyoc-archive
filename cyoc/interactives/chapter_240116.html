<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve wrapped his arms around his belly in a misplaced attempt to stop it from growing any bigger as the dragon inside painfully thrashed about inside.  “Ahh!” Steve let out a surprised gasp as the creature’s tail slammed up against the top of his belly.  Looking down, Steve saw the same reptilian impression from before poking out from under his fur, but as he looked, the impression seemed to split apart.  <br />
<br />
Under his belly fur, two impressions wiggled away to either side of the main one, with each shrinking in size as Steve felt a half dozen clawed limbs scraping along the walls of his uterus.  Then the dragons inside of him calmed down and his belly returned to normal, albeit with the distinct sensation of three different creatures packed up against his uterine walls.  <br />
<br />
Xandal walked over and put a paw on top of the hand that Steve had on his belly.  “See, now you have three smaller dragons in there.  You should be able to manage that.”  The lioness’ voice was distinctly feminine, but much deeper and more dominating than the weak, girly voice that Steve now had.  It was a voice that let its listener know exactly who this lioness was – while a male lion might be her social superior, she viewed herself as being the better to everyone else, especially a meek slave like Steve.<br />
<br />
The lioness just sat there, paw still on Steve’s hand, as though she was waiting for something.  After a few minutes had past, a tone of arrogance began to creep into her voice as she asked, “you’re not going to thank me?”<br />
<br />
Steve expected his body to fall to its knees, licking the lioness’s feet as it extolled innumerous platitudes on her for ‘saving’ it from an impossible birth, but it didn’t seem to take Xandal’s words as a question.  Rather, it seemed to view them more as a statement to which a response was unnecessary, which left Steve with a brief window of free will, which he used to respond, “please change me back Mistress.”<br />
<br />
“Change you back?  I’ve given you the gift of surviving into motherhood, what more could a *skunk* like you want?  Well Steve, if you’re not going to be thankful to me…”  Xandal began tapping at the phone again and, after several minutes, explained, “ah, here we go: ‘Steve is sitting in her chair.’  This is going to be a two parter, so get ready.”<br />
<br />
Xandal continued to tap at the screen as Steve began muttering to himself, “please god, please help me.  Please change me back.  Please… I’ll do anything, I’ll…”  Steve kept praying when he heard the phone ding, followed by Xandal tapping at it again.<br />
<br />
“So, I just changed ‘sitting’ to ‘praying’, which you seem to be doing with some gusto, but I think you’re praying for the wrong thing.  You’re never going to turn back Steve, so how about I change ‘in’ to ‘to’ and ‘chair’ to ‘goddess’.”  Xandal tapped the screen again, only for the chair to vanish out from under Steve.<br />
<br />
Steve’s butt hit the wooden floor with a loud thud, causing his breasts to painfully jiggle while the dragons in his stomach began thrashing around.  He wanted to cry out, but his body quickly positioned itself on its hands and knees, before turning to face his rapidly diminishing chair.  There were a series of loud cracks as the metal and fabric of his chair shrunk down and took on the tone of aged oak.  <br />
<br />
Soon, what was sitting before Steve was a small wooden sculpture, about six inches tall, that depicted an anthropomorphic kitsune lying with her back slightly raised and legs spread in a stereotypical birthing position.  Her cunt was spread wide by a large dome with two fox ears protruding off the top of it, all while her hands desperately grasped at her thin vagina lips in a vain attempt to pull it further open.<br />
<br />
Steve’s hands clasped together as he lowered his head as far as his bulbous stomach would allow, before the timid voice of a breeding slave girl eked out, “please Labora, Goddess of Birth, please bless me with a long and painful labor, that this slave might toil to birth for her Mistress.  Please let my Mistress breed me over and over again, that I might know the agony that you feel as my baby presses out of my cu…”<br />
<br />
Cunt.  Steve knew what his body was about to say – it was about to beg that statue in front of him to subject him to the same agony that was plainly visible on the statue’s scrunched up face.  Fortunately, he’d felt the app’s grip on him diminish just in time to stop himself from saying that word.  Steve hadn’t believed in god prior to today, but after seeing the app, he was legitimately frightened that Labora, the goddess of painful births, actually did exist and, even worse, had he finished that prayer he would have received a real, live divine blessing – of the kind that he wanted to avoid at all costs.<br />
<br />
The lioness walked next to Steve, and with a few “ooohhs” and “nrrrnns”, gripped her lower back and the bottom of her belly as she slowly lowed herself into a squatting position.  “Whooh…” she sighed as she gestured towards her gravid belly, “that’s a lot harder to do when you’ve got one of these inside of you isn’t it?”<br />
<br />
Reaching across Steve’s back, Xandal reached down and cupped one of Steve’s breasts, using one of her soft, padded fingers to gently massage the nipple as a stream of milk splattered on the floor below.  The feeling of Xandal milking him was all of the best of what he’d experienced earlier when Leon had carried him or when he’d milked himself in the bathroom.  It was so comforting and safe that Steve’s mouth briefly lolled open, and a dribble of saliva appeared on his lip.<br />
<br />
“Enjoying yourself Steve?” Xandal cooed in her deep yet feminine voice, “that was such a good prayer you gave earlier, so why did you stop yourself?  Don’t you want to know what its like when that little cunt of yours is being stretched to its limit?”<br />
<br />
“Mistress, no!”  Steve managed to yell out in a girly voice that could only pretend to be firm.  “I stopped because I don’t… I don’t want to have a cunt Mistress.  I don’t want to be a girl.  All I want is for you to change me back to a man.”<br />
<br />
Xandal kept rubbing Steve’s breast as she cooed, “but you do have a cunt, don’t you Steve?  A nice little cunt that you’re going to give birth with.  It’s ok Steve, I have a cunt too.  We’re both pregnant, and we’re both going to use those cunts to give birth.  Isn’t that what we’ve both always wanted?  Isn’t that why you’re into the type of porn that you are?  Haven’t you always wondered what it would be like to be on the other end of those pictures, to be the little girl struggling to give birth?”<br />
<br />
“Xandal… no… its not… porn is a fantasy, its fun to think about but that doesn’t mean I wanted to live it out.  Please Xandal, just turn me back.”  Silence was Steve’s answer.  Xandal wasn’t going to turn him back and, if the app really was in control of Xandal, Steve could only imagine that he was waiting for Steve to begin bargaining with his own fate.  “Please Xandal, I’ll… I’ll stay a girl, but please don’t make me give birth.”<br />
<br />
A black tendril briefly flashed into the periphery of Steve’s vision, only to vanish again as Xandal said, “see, isn’t that better?  You want to be a girl, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
“No… I just… I know you’re going to do what you want with me so… please just…”<br />
<br />
“Mmmm.  Do what I want with you?  And what’s that?  I think you’re just not ready to give birth yet.  Don’t worry, I understand.  As a first-time expectant mother myself I know how frightening the prospect of labor can be.  How about we see just how long you have...” Xandal continued to squat down next to Steve as she began tapping at the screen again.  A few dings and regenerated sentences later, and Xandal finally read out the sentence she was looking for:<br />
<br />
“Steve still thinks that there is a way out of this without giving birth, but both she and Xandal are going to go into labor by noon tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
The lioness let go of Steve’s breast, moving her paw backwards until Steve’s cunt quivered at the feeling of the lioness’s warm finger pads toying with the outer folds of her vulva.  <br />
<br />
“Interesting that you think you’re going to get out of this without giving birth, but I tell you what Steve, how about we play a little game.  Admit that your body is nothing more than a weak, pregnant little girl and I’ll change the word ‘both’ to ‘either’ and the word ‘and’ to ‘or’.  That gives you a 50% chance to delay your water breaking, and I’m not even asking you to admit that you want this.  All you need to do is be honest about the body that you’re going to be spending the rest of your life in.”<br />
<br />
Steve expected his heart to sink, but that comforting butterfly kept fluttering in his chest as the presence of the strong, domineering lioness squatting next to him made his body feel… safe.  Where he should have been terrified that the app had transformed his trustworthy best friend into a malicious mockery of the person that Xandal once was, the… masculine traits of Xandal’s female body just felt so reassuring, and so right.<br />
<br />
“I don’t…” Steve stammered as he closed his teary eyes.<br />
<br />
“You don’t what, Steve?  You don’t want to be a girl?  In that case, I can always change ‘noon tomorrow’ to ‘right now’.  God, I can just imagine how good it must feel for your water to break and to endure your first contraction.  Is that what you want Steve?  Do you want to find out just what it means to truly be a girl?”<br />
<br />
“No, I… Mistress please…”<br />
<br />
“Don’t ‘Mistress please’ me Steve.  Admit that your body is a weak, pathetic little girl with three huge dragons filling its womb and you might get another few days to prepare yourself.  Or don’t, and that little cunt of yours is going to find out just how big a baby dragon really is.”<br />
<br />
Steve sniffled as a tear drop splattered on the floor below him.  He wasn’t a girl, and he wasn’t going to give birth, but this was part of the app’s cruelty.  It wasn’t asking him to give in and accept what it had done to him, just to acknowledge the body he was stuck in.  The app was letting him keep his mind, all while letting him know that his body belonged to it.<br />
<br />
“I… *sniffle*…” he started, “I’m… my body is a girl.”<br />
<br />
“Very good Steve, what kind of girl?”<br />
<br />
“A weak… *sniffle*… girl.”<br />
<br />
“That isn’t all is it?”<br />
<br />
“My bo… my bo…” Steve kept stammering, only for his ovaries to unleash a surge of estrogen, overwhelming him with emotion that caused him to blurt out:<br />
<br />
“I’m a weak, pathetic little pregnant girl.  But I’m not going to give birth!”  Slimy, black tendrils materialized around Steve’s arms as fiery, demonic voice emanated from the lioness next to him. <br />
<br />
“Good enough.”</p>
