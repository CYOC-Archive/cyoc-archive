<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“C’mon hurry it up.  Hurry it up,” the soccer coach, Mr. Gomoke was clapping his hands.  Practice hand been delayed, by him, there had been a quick faculty meeting about indecent conduct possibly becoming a hazard among schools.  Then another about missing students and coaches.<br />
<br />
Kerry moved his wheat color hair out of his face.  He hated his dorky bowl cut, but his mother had insisted as part of her big reform him kick.  He’d gotten into a fight over some kids sharing their first blunt.  It had been reported and, well that was his mom, overreact to everything.  Then, again, George was more embarrassing nowadays.<br />
<br />
“I swear man, I saw Mr. (blank) and it was like he got molded into some sorta Mark Summers dude,” George was barely refraining from flapping his elbows while pulling at his gear turning to quickly suit up as privately as possible in the school lockerroom, “And then I saw a bunch of new kids in the hall then Germ and Freddie were like gone.  Plus there has be talk about town-“<br />
<br />
“George just choke it up,” Tal’s gritty-brown hand was self-consciously scratching at the bindi on his forehead, “Okay, man.  I know you got a good eye but this abduction story is just getting out there!  Uh, Mark Summers”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, the Beastmaster and that guy from the first Tremors movie,” George lowered his voice an octave as he seemed to get a peculiar cross between a frown and a smile on his face as he slid the athletic supporter up his legs.  The waistband set as he reached automatically for his shorts while his stringy black hair that always seemed a little greasy matted his brow just before his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Gawd, that gayass barbarian movie!” Tal chuckled as his own straight black hair tickled his ear, “Don’t mention that stuff here.  And I think that guy’s name is Singer.”<br />
<br />
“Hey it rocked okay,” George turned in nothing but his jock his feet near shoulderwidth and gave a heavy shrug his dim grey eyes looking boldly towards Tal, “and what about that blonde chick in the water fall.  And the ferrets!”  He reached down scratching his crotch with two fingers.  He just seemed to be missing the bush and catching the log.<br />
<br />
“Ferret sex, I missed ferret sex in that,” Kerry sounded surprised but by something else his locker was empty of nothing but his jock.  Who would steal from the soccer team?  His older uniform was gone and there was some rank odor!  Oh well he’d just have to unpack the cleaner one he’d brought in for rotation.  He gingerly tapped the elastic and cup.  It * seemed * unharmed.  But.. he rubbed the band and cup between his thumb and forefinger then pulled it off the hook shaking out of his boxers and clamping his legs together.  He was getting some wood and he didn’t like it.  He put one foot in the waist band and then left loop, then another then leaned over and pulled it up.  He also picked at the golden yellow shorts with his foot.   They felt pretty shib<br />
<br />
“People this is taking to long,” Gomoke was furious.  George patted Kerry’s shoulder . . . to hurry him and then picked up a tshirt to throw on, he walked outside staring to the door to the field.  Tal swallowed and then adopted a confidant ramrod posture moving shoulder to shoulder with his friend.  They were both missing shorts.  There rumps were tightly dimpled as they moved after the other teammates who were also not quite in uniform.  <br />
<br />
Kerry shook his head, set and tied his shorts, and then his cleats. Leaning down to grab his buds playing shoes with his teeth, thinking how nice they smelled, he began to throw more serious wood.  Thank goodness the cup was out of his jock.  It would so kill the thigh stone.  MAN he couldn’t make it quit.  He’d have to catch them before they made it to the field.  Them and their fine smooth, TIGHT ASSES<br />
<br />
He was barely at the hallway to the field before he remembered his hands were empty and to put the shoes in them so he could hiss, “TAL, G, missing something!”  They turned.  George’s eyes flashed a little green.<br />
<br />
Whoah, this wood must be going around, Kerry thought, since when does George have such killer eyes.<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah, sorry,”  George snatched the shoes from Kerry’s right at the sides, but Tal grabbed his from Kerry’s by the strings with his sorta crosslifted his foot.  A sudden almost cavemanish move followed by a smooth and lithe one.  <br />
<br />
“George, you been, uh… working out!” Kerry gulped his tongue caught in the bottom of his mouth as his chest felt really tight.  His heartpounded.  He was so nervous</p>
