<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucas watched as his granddaughter tried to cool down the burning sensation in her muzzle with straight Tap water from the sink. The scene of the young doe cub using a step stool to reach the sink faucet to drink straight from was a sight. Bent over lapping the running water, Dawn was showing more than what would be considered proper if she and her grandfather were human. As both were furies, Lucas getting a good view of Dawn’s fury cunt was nothing he felt embarrassed for seeing; nor did he felt any shame for walking around with his fury sack and sheath on full display. The anthro wolf fury just sighed as he used magic to shut the tap off; causing Dawn with tears running down to turn around to see the runes on his wrist glow before fading.<br />
<br />
“Water will only make it worse,” Lucas responding as he pulls a glass from the cupboard; opening the fridge door to pull out some milk, Lucas fills the glass up before handing it to Dawn.<br />
“Sip it slowly,” Lucas instructing the distraught doe cub; “swish it around before swallowing, this will help to neutralize the capsaicin.<br />
Lucas watched as Dawn did what she was instructed, soon she was calm enough to make a feeble apology for ruining her chili with the hot sauce she did believe was hot.<br />
“Oliver and Paul learned not to dump that sauce on their food,” Lucas doing his best to comfort Dawn; “they ended up bawling the entire night after mistaking the sauce for ketchup to put on their tacos.”<br />
“Ketchup on tacos,” Dawn struggling to speak through her whimpering; the heat still in her maw, but not as strong as before as her breathing becomes less labored.<br />
“Your uncles are four years old,” Lucas helping Dawn off of the stool; “they don’t have the most sophisticated of palates. Infact it wasn’t so long ago that you and Dusk wanted peanut butter on hot dog buns.”<br />
Dawn felt flushed with embarrassment at being reminded of her and her twin brother’s eclectic culinary tastes. Recalling her father giving them exactly that, but with a hot dog wiener wedge in the peanut butter slathered bun. It was the last time they made that request.<br />
<br />
Reentering the dining room, Dawn sat back down to see a fresh bowl of chili on her placemat; feeling contrite and in no mood to talk, she quietly ate while her grandfather gasped as his bowl of chili felt hotter than before. She looks to see his bowl looks fuller than before and that he was grabbing the bread rolls more frequently to help abate the heat.<br />
“I figured you would have little problem eating extra spicy chili,” Rachael watching her mate pant and cough; would anyone else like seconds?”<br />
“I’ll take a little bit more,” Dusk a charcoal grey furred wolf cub fury holding up his near empty bowl of chili; watching as his grandmother ladles another scoop into it he thanks her as he dives into it, forgoing the hot sauce that he tried earlier as it was too intense for his developing palette.<br />
“Oliver, Paul,” Rachael looking at her cubs; “do you want more chili?” She watches as they shake their heads. “You want dessert don’t you,” Rachael seeing her twin boys nod and smile through their lupine maws.<br />
“Pooding,” Paul being the first to speak; watching his dad finish off his chili with little difficulty after managing to handle the extra hot sauce.<br />
“Maybe,” Rachael giving a sly grin as she starts collecting bowls; “you’ll just have to wait.”<br />
<br />
For Oliver and Paul, the wait felt like an eternity; watching as the empty bowl of chili were removed, the two cubs look confused as their parents came back with empty plates, with forks and placed them on the table. Even Dusk and Dawn look puzzled at the odd eating utensils for pudding. It was then that the anthro lioness came back from the kitchen with a pie that caused the cubs too look on in wonder.<br />
“Chocolate pudding pie,” Rachael putting the dessert down. The cubs watched as she sliced the pie and started serving the wedges on the plates. The stiff pudding resting on the crust was covered in a layer of whipped cream and dusted with coco powder. Oliver and Paul wasted no time in devouring the novel confection; the white furred wolf cubs delighting in the smooth sweet texture of the filling while chomping on the crust.<br />
“Did you prepare this while we were all outside,” Lucas nibbling on a small piece; feeling full from all the chili he opted to not have a large slice so as not to feel overstuffed.<br />
“Yes, and it is a good thing;” Rachael watching Oliver and Paul licking their plates clean. “If these two saw what I was making for dessert,” Rachael taking a napkin and wiping a small amount of chocolate off of Oliver’s muzzle; “they would have been on me like a hawk on a tit mouse.”<br />
<br />
Only Lucas chuckled as the comment went over the cubs head; glancing that both Dawn and Dusk had their slices polished off, he smiles as he starts taking the plates away.<br />
“You can have more tomorrow,” Lucas taking the plate from Paul who is already trying to reach for more pie; “Rachael can you put the pie someplace they won’t be able to reach? I fear these imps might want a second helping if given a chance.”<br />
<br />
<br />
**************<br />
<br />
Hours later, with the cubs finally settled down and fully asleep; Rachael wasted no time in pawing at her mate as they watched television. The weather report predicting another dump of snow in the morning, Rachael’s objective was more carnal; her fury hand paws running and rubbing up and down her mate’s body as he too eagerly explored her curves. Rachael cooed as she felt something brush her inner thigh; taking a moment to looks, the lioness fury smiled as her mate’s phallus was at full mast and already leaking pre cum.<br />
<br />
Doing her best to be careful and quiet as they are in the living room instead of the bedroom; Rachael climbed off of her mate and assumed a position on the floor to be mounted. Her tail off to the side in a supine position, she made sure her mate got a full view of her swollen feline entrance; her vulva puffed and giving off a subtle wink was all Lucas needed as he quickly climbed on top and had his lupine rod ate her entrance.<br />
“The last time we rutted in the living room,” Lucas getting close and exhaling his hot breath next Rachael’s leonine ear; we woke up to find Oliver and Paul snuggled next to us.”<br />
“Don’t care,” Rachael moaning; feeling the tip of Lucas’s rod brushing her entrance. “Make me feel full,” Rachael shudders as she feels the shaft push and spread her inner folds apart; her breathing becoming rapid as she feels the familiar sensation of Lucas’s ministrations inside of her. The lupine rod brushing her sensitive spots inside of her making her struggle to stifle her moans; moans that only got louder as she felt Lucas’s knot swell and lock the two together.<br />
<br />
“….the cold mass of artic air coming down from British Columbia is going to mix with the moist air mass from the Pacific Ocean. This will cause another massive snowfall to hit the Washington and Oregon states. This impending snowfall will linger; expect at least two feet of fresh snow by…”<br />
Lucas grunted as he absently flicked the t.v off thanks to his magic runes; his current desire to rut over riding his household duties to prepare for a winter storm. The tight feeling of Rachael’s warm tunnel squeezing his phallus as he forces his way in deeper; determined to hit her cervix with his tip, before exploding. Lucas starts to pant and grunt as he feels his climax coming; the pressure building within as his balls starts to clench, forcing him to instinctively bite the scruff of Rachael’s neck as he makes one final thrust and feels his shaft sputter and twitch.<br />
<br />
“oooooooooooh,” Rachael unable to stifle her moan as she feels the warm sensation of her mate’s seed fill her womb; her body racked with pleasure as her own orgasms hits her hard, sparks dance within the periphery of her vision as her tongue lolls out of her mouth; panting as she tries to cool down from the bestial act.<br />
“I guess we are sleeping here,” Lucas feeling weak as he rests on top of Rachael; unable to pull out thanks to his lupine knot, he instead pulls the both of them to lay on their sides. The feeling of his shaft still pumping his cum as his orgasms began to ebb gave him a satisfying sigh while he absently wrapped and arm around his lioness mate.<br />
“Did you get the weather report,” Rachael managing to speak now that her breathing has become less labored; “are we getting more snow?”<br />
“I think so,” Lucas answering adjusting himself to better spoon Rachael as he got comfortable on the carpeted floor. “Except for when you were pregnant with Oliver and Paul,” Lucas starting to doze off; “I can’t remember a time when we didn’t end the day with a rut. Not since we became furies that is.”<br />
<br />
Rachael didn’t answer; she just sighed as she guided her mate’s hand paw up towards her tawny furred breasts, eager to have them felt and played with; the lioness fury felt content. Content that her fur is keeping her warm; forgoing the need to wear clothing or to cover herself with heavy blankets. Content that her mate has been just as open with his sexuality as her; she couldn’t wait for another afternoon or evening appointment at their favorite spa.<br />
‘If only Trudy wasn’t pregnant,’ Rachael thought to herself; ‘I could really go with one of her back rubs right now.’ Any other thought was drowned out as she began to hear Lucas’s soft snores behind her; he was already asleep and she could feel herself starting to nod off.</p>
