<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power- One afternoon at the fun park<br />
<br />
Peter and Ty thought it was a good idea to go and hang out with Dustin and their new friend Michael! Although Mike was kind of a heavy kid, Ty and Peter were there to make sure that he would not be left out of anything and would resize him if needed. So the four guys decided to spend some of their money (Dustin was a millionaire by now, since he had won the Florida Lottery, thanks to Peter’s Powers) and to go spend a fun afternoon at the video game arcade.<br />
<br />
Dustin had told Peter that the place was far away, on the other side of town. So he showed Peter on a map where it was and what the address was, Peter concentrated and in a flash all four boys were standing in front of the main entrance of the Fun Station.<br />
<br />
They walked through the glass doors, and Michael and Peter was just amazed by how big the place was! There was a large, main room with hundreds of video games, which all required tokens in order to play them. Each token was worth 25 cents, and the boys had to stand in line at the front counter in order to buy them. Outside, there were small racing bumper cars, and there were bumper boats in a large, artificial lake. There was also a large metal stand with several bars sticking out from the top, with large rubber bands sticking out of them. This ride was called the “Trampoline Thing”, people get themselves strapped in to a harness and they would bounce on a trampoline, propelling themselves up to 30 feet in the air! And there were two large 18-hole miniature golf courses on the premises! Michael knew he was going to have fun with Peter, Ty, and Dustin!<br />
<br />
Ty and Michael decided to go into the bumper boats while Peter and Dustin played one round of golf. When Ty and Michael stood in line for the bumper cars, there was a sign saying that in order to drive in a car by yourself, you had to be at least 42 inches tall! Ty saw a little boy there, who was maybe 6 years old, but he was kind of short and just a few inches too short to ride alone. He started to cry when he realized that he couldn’t ride alone, for he was just about 39 inches tall. Ty had compassion on him, because even though the boy was by himself and had his ticket, the attendant would not let him ride in his own car. Ty tapped him on his shoulder and signaled the boy to walk to the end of the line with him.<br />
<br />
“Hey kid,” Ty said to him, “you want to ride in the bumper car by yourself, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I would love to. But I’m too short!” the little boy responded.<br />
<br />
“Oh well let me help you out, okay?” Ty said to the boy. <br />
<br />
Ty looked around and made sure nobody was paying attention to them and allowed the boy to grow until he reached the height of 48 inches, four feet! He now looked like a seven or an eight-year-old boy! Now the attendant allowed him to sit in a bumper car by himself! Ty made sure the boy would grow back to his original size as soon as he walked out of the gate to the track where the bumper cars were. <br />
<br />
Michael also needed Ty’s help, for at 400 pounds, he was too big to fit in a little bumper car! When Ty realized that, after he allowed the boy to grow nine inches taller, he had to shrink Michael down to about 200 pounds. Now Michael was able to fit in the car so he could let his car race through five laps on the track! <br />
<br />
Ty was lucky, he had the fastest car! He passed everyone in the first lap and maintained his wide lead over just about everyone else! Then came Michael, and then there were about a dozen others! Michael had a great time with Ty, and when their ride was over, they were wondering what Peter and Dustin were doing.<br />
<br />
Dustin wanted to take things easy at first and wasn’t much in the mood for bumper cars, and Peter was really easy-going and was just about willing to do anything. Peter had never been to such a big game arcade place before, and for him to go with his cousin and his friends was a big treat. And since Dustin liked basketball as much as Peter, it was only natural that those two would pair up together. Not only that, but Peter and Ty didn’t want to be in the same group together, in order to allow them to spend more time getting to know Michael and Dustin.<br />
<br />
Peter and Dustin played their 18 holes of golf. They didn’t keep score and just played for the fun of it! Dustin had more luck than Peter and hit the ball in the hole on the second or the third shot for just about every hole. Peter wanted to be fair and decided to play golf without using any powers, and he wanted to let Dustin gain some confidence as well.<br />
<br />
When Peter and Dustin had finished playing their 18 holes of golf, they saw the Trampoline Thing, which was bolted to the concrete floor just besides the exit from the 18th hole. A little boy was strapped in a harness, which went from his torso to his back, with two straps over the shoulders. On each side of the harness was a thick bungee cord. The ends of these cords were tightly fastened to the ends of these two steel rods, which were sticking out at least ten feet from the top of a 30 foot metal pole. The two rods made a 90 degree angle, and allowed enough room for a person to jump from a trampoline while strapped to two bungee cords!<br />
<br />
Peter was absolutely fascinated with them, and so was Dustin. Dustin went first; he was strapped in and bounced around, pushing off with his feet on the trampoline and launching himself in the air, reaching heights of 20, even 30 feet in the air.<br />
<br />
Peter went next; he wanted to get the feeling of leaping 30 feet in the air. Since he had practiced gymnastics when he was only seven years old, he knew how to do back flips and loops. He bounced off the trampoline, heading straight up to about 35 feet, then he would flip backwards until he would come back down in time, with his feet pointing down, to bounce from the trampoline.<br />
<br />
When his five minutes were up, he decided to try it once again, but without a bungee cord! He made the attendants ignore him, as he jumped on the trampoline, without wearing any shoes. He made his weight like that of a feather, and he found himself leaping more than 40 feet in the air! All the people who saw him were amazed and gathered around the trampoline, watching Peter soar over 30 feet straight up in the air without wearing a harness or bungee cords!<br />
<br />
When he got tired, he jumped off, allowing the next person to try. That’s when Ty and Michael had joined the crowd; they had just caught the end of Peter’s turn on the trampoline.<br />
<br />
Ty went next; he took his shoes off, strapped on the harness, and then bounced on the trampoline. Since he was already strapped in, he allowed his weight to become almost a pound, and he soared almost 50 feet in the air on every bounce! The crowd was astonished, for they had never seen anyone bounce that high before!<br />
<br />
When Ty’s 5 minutes were up, he bounced of the trampoline, letting his shoes slip on to his feet before he hit the ground. Michael was delighted to see his friends have a great time, but then he became a little saddened.<br />
<br />
“I can’t do the Trampoline Thing, I guess…” he said, looking down.<br />
<br />
“Why not?” Ty asked him, as he walked up to Mike. Ty was all sweaty, but he had a blast jumping on the trampoline.<br />
<br />
“I’m too heavy, and too big to go on the Trampoline Thing!” he said, as he was about cry.<br />
<br />
“Michael, Michael…. I’m here, remember?” Ty responded, trying to comfort his big buddy, “I’ll make it so you can go on the Trampoline Thing after all!”<br />
<br />
Michael took his shoes off and got on the trampoline. Ty made Michael thin again, and made him weigh only 30 pounds, like a little kid! He used every second of his 5 minute turn and bounced around until he got tired of it! As soon as he had taken the harness off, Ty had made him grow back to his 400 pound body again.<br />
<br />
The four boys then went to the bumper boats. Each boat was round like a little raft, and had a small outboard engine attached to one side. Each one of them got their own boat, and once the started running their rafts over the small, artificial lake, they did their best to steer their boats against one another with the goal of getting the other person as wet as possible! Here Michael had the weight advantage, and managed to splash both Peter and Ty, just by running his raft into theirs. Dustin tried hard to avoid the three up to the last minute, when Michael, Ty, and Peter had cornered him and ran their rafts into his with such force, this his boat almost got knocked over!<br />
<br />
Finally, the four guys decided to play some video games before they let Peter whisk them back to Ty’s house. Peter and Ty tried out the Dance Dance Revolution game on the new dance floor. Ty picked a fast song, as both boys had to dance on the special dance floor with four illuminated arrows painted on each pad. The arrows would appear on the monitor in front of them, scrolling from bottom to top, where they had to put their feet on the arrow that corresponds to the arrow that reaches the top row on the monitor.<br />
<br />
Peter and Ty danced to the same song and almost scored the same points! Peter had beaten Ty by just a slight margin, but Dustin and Michael didn’t want to try it.<br />
<br />
Finally, they joined a crowd that was watching a kid box a figure on the screen. Wearing fake gloves, the action figure on the screen mimicked the movements that the kid made. This gave Ty a cool idea!<br />
<br />
Ty concentrated and a full size boxing ring appeared in the middle of the arcade. Ty and Peter were standing in opposite sides of the ring, while Dustin and Michael finally found themselves in the center of the ring, fully clothed in boxing gear! Ty had comforted Michael and Dustin that they had now become part of a “live” boxing video game, and that no matter what happened, they would not get hurt for they wouldn’t feel a thing.<br />
<br />
At the sound of a large bell, Dustin and Michael moved towards each other, and Dustin would move exactly like Peter would, and Michael like Ty. If Peter hit a large right handed punch, then Dustin would do the same. Peter controlled Dustin’s movements while Ty controlled Michael’s. But Michael had the clear weight and size advantage here, for Dustin could not bring him down! Peter made Dustin hit Michael with everything he got, but Michael was just too strong for Dustin, and Ty took advantage of that. In the fourth round, Michael knocked out Dustin and Ty won the game!<br />
<br />
As soon as the game was over, the ring disappeared, and Michael and Dustin were back to normal again! Ty and Michael had won, and the huge crowd had applauded them! Peter and Dustin congratulated them, just when the manager approached them and thanked them for putting on such a show. The real-life boxing match was a huge crowd-pleaser, and they were granted over 10 dollars in tokens out of appreciation!<br />
<br />
“You see, Michael? There are certain advantages to being a gainer! You are so big and strong, Dustin couldn’t knock you down, and we won!” Ty shouted, congratulating Michael. The 400 pound boy was just beaming; he had never felt so happy about being a big kid in his life!<br />
<br />
The boys had spent over three hours that afternoon at the Fun Station, and when Peter finally transported them back to Ty’s house, they were all tired and thirsty. Ty and Dustin were dead tired, but Michael still had energy left, and had invited Peter to spend the night at his house. He called his parents, and then Peter and Michael walked over to Michael’s house for the night. Michael had never had so much fun in all his life and he wondered what more Peter could do? For it wasn’t every day that he had a guest over who possessed such amazing powers, and he was elated to have Peter spending the night at his house. He had a spare bed in his room, so Peter had a place to stay. And Ty was happy that Michael had found a new friend in Cousin Peter. Ty and Dustin were very pleased, for it had been the most fun day they have had together in a long, long time. And they wondered what they would do the next day…</p>
