<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You glare at him, but you can&#39;t help noticing that little glint of hurt in his eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t fucking get this... what makes you think this okay? Just walking into someone&#39;s life and doing all this crap!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I... you know what? I don&#39;t have a fucking excuse... but you saw what happened at the hospital... why should I care about humans? Your species is the worst... the absolute worst... what were you planning when you brought me home that night? You were just gonna fuck me and toss me aside weren&#39;t you? You just wanted to be friends? Or wait ... you were gonna date me right? A relationship that would&#39;ve lasted a couple of months before you tossed me aside like a used condom?&quot; He almost spits as he looks away; casting his eyes to the ground. &quot;Romance is a joke, love is a lie; centuries of watching humans has taught me that...&quot; <br />
<br />
You can&#39;t help being stunned by the admission and the hurt that was hidden in those eyes. You wish you could hold him and you would if you were able to really move... being so big was a real hindrance. You try to focus ... you vaguely remember being able to control your own shape right? You actually manage it; you can feel your body compacting and shrinking down... soon your only seven feet tall and able to stand again thank the powers. Your dick was still massive... reaching up to your chin easily and thick as fuck... but it wasn&#39;t the ungodly tool it had been a minute ago. Your balls were the size of soft-balls which made walking a little difficult... but you managed it somehow. <br />
<br />
You come over to him and grab his chin and force him to look into your eyes. &quot;Sounds like you could really use someone whose stubborn as fuck ... to prove to you not everyone is a monster...&quot; <br />
<br />
He meets your eyes, and his own are moist. <br />
<br />
&quot;You have all this power... all this insight... and you just see all the darkness humanity contains. You see all the hurt they inflict on each other; you&#39;ve been hurt I would bet... a lot; and its made you cold and hard like you said. You can&#39;t let them turn you into a monster though... even if you&#39;re surrounded by monsters...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I used to feel that way too... but I think I just gave up at some point.&quot; He sighs, he clearly has been caught off guard by this reaction. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just shut up ...&quot; You say as you pull him into a kiss. It&#39;s hungry and passionate and surprisingly deep and tender at the same time. When you break the kiss you gaze into his eyes for a good few minutes as you pull him against your body. &quot;Alright so now that is ... sort of cleared up ... I&#39;m still not happy about this using me as a guinea pig.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Believe it or not there... is a method to this madness... &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... kind of? I mean ... you clearly aren&#39;t... totally human anymore are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No I&#39;m sort of fuck-beast now thanks a lot.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you ... you kind of like it right?&quot; <br />
<br />
&#39;Mmmm I won&#39;t lie... fucking you silly is rather fun; you make the most adorable faces.&quot; You chortle and nip at the tip of his nose which makes him blush. &quot;You should tell me more about this stuff ... at least; if you&#39;re gonna continue.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;MMmm I think I can manage that? Um... the next one is called Lunar Stone... I&#39;ll be giving you back the second part of your soul.&quot; <br />
<br />
You raise a brow, &quot;oh really?&quot; <br />
<br />
The young looking Magician nods his head, &quot;yes; but the second part is going to be... changed... I&#39;m going to ... change the shape and how it enters your body; enchanting it so that... well ... it will be more than just your run of the mill soul piece.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me more...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The Lunar stone technique allows you to ... well enhance a soul with angelic properties...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Angel? ... you&#39;re fucking kidding me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... no ... no I&#39;m actually not...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haven&#39;t you turned me into some sort of sex demon? Like... how&#39;s that gonna work?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm... better than you think? I mean... sort of... it will... I mean... I&#39;m not... entirely... sure...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Riiiiight... uh... okay ... well I mean... I guess... I&#39;ll be less of a crazy fuck-beast? I mean look at my dick... this thing is ridiculous... I mean I know you can take it; but I can&#39;t even kind of fit this thing into a pair of trousers...&quot; <br />
<br />
The young Mage chuckles and nods his head as he takes the second piece holding it in his hands he begins to rub at it and the soul begins to take on a faint blue glow. You can&#39;t help noticing that the cum in the basin has been lowering this whole time... you&#39;re thinking it was absorbed into the soul and than the soul-pieces. &quot;This whole thing is a long-game to you isn&#39;t it? The Magical Bondage Arts... you mentioned there was a 100 at one point didn&#39;t you?&quot; <br />
<br />
The young mage nods as his hands continue to shape the soul-piece, &quot;yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really thought them out too didn&#39;t you? You actually put a lot of thought into them I bet... that golden  cum... the magic after; now your giving it all back to me... I thought you took them for yourself... but you didn&#39;t... you&#39;re enhancing me... making me something more; that&#39;s your plan isn&#39;t it?&quot; <br />
<br />
The young mage shrugs; &quot;sort of yeah...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What did the golden cum do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enhanced you with regenerative abilities... I imagine you&#39;d be about immortal at this point.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your solution to the &#39;human&#39; problem huh... in your own super-lewd and kinky way you&#39;re like... trying to save the world aren&#39;t you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Humans are incredibly selfish creatures... you gotta sneak the good into what they like... rarely people realize that... they don&#39;t notice that I&#39;m making them better; healing them; making them stronger... while they are too busy getting their nut...&quot; <br />
<br />
You are surprised actually as it suddenly begins to click into place... all the enchantments... yeah sure it was all very sexual; seemed all sexual... but it actually hadn&#39;t been... you could change your form; you were stronger; faster; healthier... you&#39;re not entirely sure; but you actually felt... a bit smarter. &quot;So... ... it&#39;s actually all a trick in a way?&quot; You question as you see he&#39;s almost done; the soul-piece sort of looked like a dildo. &quot;You use the sex to cover up what you&#39;re actually doing... making some kind of new super-race?&quot; <br />
<br />
The Mage nods, &#39;you got the gist of it... although.. I can&#39;t pretend I don&#39;t enjoy the sex part a bit too ...&quot; <br />
<br />
You laugh and nod, &#39;yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense I guess... who doesn&#39;t? Don&#39;t tell me this angel power is about to be shoved up my ass...&quot; <br />
<br />
The young (looking) magic snorts a bit and nods his head. &quot;Alright bend over Beast, &#9829;&quot;<br />
<br />
You give a snarl, but you do as your told as he pushes the soul-piece up your ass... you can feel it stretching you out; but as it slurps into your ass-hole its soon being absorbed. You give a groan as you can feel the power surging through you. Invisible wings lifting from your back; your body seems to be changing again. You can feel it compacting more... you&#39;re still pretty tall about 6&#39;7&quot; and you are gorgeous. You can feel it... you can tell your body is becoming that perfect mix of lean and muscular; hairy; you can feel your face just molding to be more aesthetically pleasing than before. You were pretty sure you had quite the handsome mug; although a bit intimidating... but now ... you had the face of an angel; you couldn&#39;t see it; but you somehow knew it. You get up slowly and grin at the Boy ... your Son. You had been planning to bring that up at some point... that little twist he put into your conditioning and other things... <br />
<br />
But now it didn&#39;t seem to bother you as much. <br />
<br />
&quot;Does the next one involve the third soul-piece?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it does... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that one called?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sun Meteor&quot;</p>
