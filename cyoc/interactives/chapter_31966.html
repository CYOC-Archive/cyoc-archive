<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erika decided that she needed to spend some time with Meg or she might leave.  Erika didn't know why that made her feel sad to think of her friend leaving so she waved Meg over to the shallow end of the pool so the two could sit next to each other on the steps.  Erika also kept an eye on Cindy who looked like she had fallen asleep while working on her tan.<br />
<br />
When Meg sat down next to her Erika's long black hair swirled around in the water and began floating all over the place so that it began covering parts of Meg's arms and legs but if she felt anything she didn't mention it.  Erika looked longingly at the innocent face of her best friend and she knew she wanted her.  She needed her.  Erika began stroking a black claw across her tender blossoms and shivered with the pleasure of it.  Meg looked over and and asked, &quot;Are you cold Erika?  Maybe we should move around and do something.  I know a couple games we could try.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erika giggled excitedly, &quot;That's a great idea.  Let's play a game that I just learned.  I promise you it'll get your blood moving.  Wanna try?&quot;  Meg nodded, mystified as to what this new game could be.<br />
<br />
Erika didn't give Meg a moment to prepare before she wrapped her arms around Meg and cut into Meg's back with her claws.  Meg would have cried out but she was stopped when Erika began kissing her hard on the mouth and wrapped her legs around Meg's waist, pumping her groin into Meg.  In the sudden move, the two of them fell into the water and sank to the bottom.  Meg could see the surface only a few feet a way but she couldn't break free from Erika's strong hold.  She thought she was going to die, terrified, hurt, bleeding, and running out of air.  Despite all of this Erika noticed that Meg was no longer fighting her and trying to break free, but was ramming her own hand into Erika's nether regions and the sensation was an incredible high, stronger then anything Erika had ever felt before.<br />
Erika had no idea how long they lay in that embrace grappling for a better hold, it could have been minutes, it may have been hours.  Neither wanted to let go until they had their fill. Until it was more then they could hold.  <br />
<br />
Fully satisfied, like she had just eaten a huge meal, Erika let Meg go and the two stood up out of the murky combination of blood and sex they stood in and the two pulled themselves out of the pool. Erika looked around but was disappointed to see that Christy was gone.  The thought of what she could enjoy from a mature body made her wet.  Just like she hadn't wanted Meg to go she now was sad that Christy was gone.  Too exhausted to move more then absolutely necessary, Meg laid on the ground staring up at Erika and seeing her change for the first time.  It was terrible to behold.  It was glorious to behold.  Meg thought she was in the presence of a god and would have given her soul to such a creature.  Little did she know that Erika had already taken it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you like my game?&quot; Erika asked, wondering what kind of response she would get.  She hadn't meant to be so forceful, taking away Meg's innocence.  Erika's yellow eyes widened as she saw Meg's worshipful look as she began licking her fingers of Erika's watered juices.  &quot;That was the best game ever Erika, maybe we can play again and I can get a better taste of you.&quot;  Meg blushed then, surprised that she had said such a thing.  That didn't stop her from sucking her fingers nor did it stop her from being happy that they would get to do it again and soon.<br />
<br />
Erika laughed as she saw Meg blushing, &quot;Oh my pet, we will be doing much more of that and I have even more games to teach you.  Just be sure to do every little thing I tell you my little pet.&quot;  I'm sure being nice letting Meg play with me, Erika thought, but why am I calling her my pet?  Pets need to look the part.  As soon as the idea entered her head, Erika knew she could do it.  Her rape of Meg had created a connection between the two of them that Erika could do anything she wanted with.  Erika began playing with that little piece of soul she had just taken from Meg and began sending her own dark powers down the link.  Corrupting what remained.<br />
<br />
Meg gasped as she felt a powerful force touch her.  She felt like someone had stabbed her with a knife and was pulling it across her body, mutilating her.  She wanted to scream from it but she was still trying to recover from her activity in the pool and could barely draw breath.  Then the pain turned to pleasure as the knife seemed to explode and Meg began orgasming, again and again, until she thought she'd lost her mind.  Meg thought she was going to die from the power of it as it shook her entire frame.  When it finally subsided however, she felt a new strength in her.  No longer tired she wondered if she would get to play with her mistress.<br />
<br />
Erika looked with satisfaction as she saw Meg struggle to get up, black fur covering her whole body.  The lips on her muzzle drew back to reveal her sharp teeth.  Her black tongue licked across the yellowed fangs and she looked around, scanning the area with her glowing red eyes.  Her bathing suit was stretched by her new form as her 3 pairs of nipples stretched at the fabric.  &quot;On the way home we must get you a suitable collar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course my mistress, anything you say.  Please can't we play another game?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erika thought about it what should they do next.  Cindy had left during their time in the pool, maybe she had even seen what Erika had done.  It would be best to take care of that quickly.  After all, games were always more fun when there were more people to play with.  And Erika had only begun to play.</p>
