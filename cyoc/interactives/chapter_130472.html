<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dinner with the Harris family proved to be quite enjoyable for Kellie. Claudia and her family seemed very happy to have Kellie over, Kellie could even see signs of Claudia coming out of her shell. As they finished dinner Kellie said her goodbyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a really great time Claudia,&quot; Kellie said warmly. Claudia smiled as she walked Kellie to the door. &quot;I did too,&quot; she said softly. Hugging eachother Kellie turned towards the street only to see a car svreech to a halt in front of Claudia&#39;s. Kellie and Claudia watched as a Mika and Kumiko exited the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Claudia,&quot; Mika said in confusion. &quot;What&#39;s she doing here?&quot; Claudia blushed slightly as the twins slowly approached the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just out for a walk,&quot; Kellie said quickly, holding up her hands. &quot;Claudia invited me to dinner after I helped her carry some groceries.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko gave Kellie and Claudia a bemused look as she looked them over. &quot;Odd,&quot; she mused. &quot;Claudia rarely invites anyone over. Not since well...&quot; The girl trailed off as she looked at her sister.<br />
<br />
Kellie looked the twins over, they obviously knew something but were hesitant to talk. As Kellie was about to say something she saw Mika&#39;s eyes go wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey what&#39;s with that ring,&quot; she called.<br />
<br />
Kellie looked down at the ring Mika was pointing at and sighed. &quot;Its umm nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah right,&quot; Mika grunted. &quot;Listen that looks exactly like Katies. If it is you can tell us. Im just curious how you got it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie looked the girls over before looking at her ring. She could tell the girls about it and possibly gain their trust. Hopefully by doing so she might be able to find out what happened between Mary Elise and Claudia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay you right,&quot;Kellie sighed. &quot;It&#39;s magic, I&#39;ve had it for awhile now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay prove it,&quot; Kumiko stated. <br />
<br />
Kellie gaped at the girl surprised she would ask. &quot;Are you serious?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko nodded as she glared at Kellie. &quot;Yeah Im serious,&quot; she snorted. &quot;I find it kinda hard to believe that there are two of those things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie rubbed her chin as she tbought about it. &quot;Okay I&#39;ll prove it but after that I have a question,&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko and Mika looked at eachother before nodding.  &quot;Okay deal,&quot; they responded.<br />
<br />
Krllir bodded as she looked at Kumiko. &quot;Okay Kumi,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ll ise my ring to make you 10 years older. That work?&quot; Kumiko nodded as Kellie now made her wish.<br />
<br />
Kumiko could feel her body tingle as she began to grow older. As she examined her body she could see her hips and breasts expand. As she passed 20 she could see her breasts swell from b cups to c cups. Hefting her breasts up Kumiko could feel them to begin to fill out, losing a bit of their perkiness. As the progression completed itself the girls stood in shock. Kumiko was now a beautiful woman in her mid twenties with a mature face, full breasts and luscious curves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa sis,&quot; Mika whispered. &quot;You look gorgeous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko smiled as she now looked at Kellie. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said in a more mature voice. &quot;I believe you, so whats the question?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was womdering what happened between you guys and Mary Elise.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls shifted uncomfortably as they looked at Kellie. &quot;Why are you so interested in that,&quot; Mika asked, furrowing her brow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its hard to explain okay but I am now please tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls sighed as they looked at Kellie. &quot;Okay,&quot; Claudia said quietly. &quot;But if I tell you then I want you to tell us why your so interested. Its only fair, especially if you want us to trust you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie cursed herself silently before nodding. If she wanted the information it was going to mean having to tell more of her secrets. She wasnt sure how she felt about that but needed to make her choice soon.<br />
<br />
Claudia sighed as she looked at Kellie. &quot;So you probably know me and Mary used to be friends up to about 7th grade.&quot; Kellie nodded as Claudia hung her head. &quot;What you may not know, what even these guys may not know is that Mary&#39;s parents got divorced around then. Her father moved to another state, he died in a car accident shortly afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie stood stummed as she listened to Claudias story. &quot;At first things were okay,&quot; Claudia continued. &quot;Mary was a little bitter but she was handling the divorce. Then her dad died, she was devastated. She...she came over one day crying. I...I was begining to figure out thay I liked guys and girls and....well I kissed her.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls all continued to syare at Claudia as she sighed sadly. &quot;Mary....well..she kind of freaked out,&quot; she said sadly. &quot;She loved me like a sister but...she didn&#39;t know if she liked me like that. We....we started to argue, it was dumb. I...I said something I shouldnt have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie watched as Claudia wiped her eyes. &quot;What did you say,&quot; Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
Claudia sniffed as tears rolled down her cheek. &quot;I told her that I was glad her dad was dead,&quot; she cried. &quot;It was awful....I shouldnt of done it. She responded by saying she would rather not have a dad than have one that was a cripple.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed sadly as she looked at Claudia. She had a feeling that Claudia was very protective of her dad in this timeline. While she was in the wrong for saying such a mean thing to Mary, her response about her dad probably pushed Claudia over the limit.<br />
<br />
&quot;We started fighting,&quot; Claudia moaned. &quot;Mary was taller..she was winning....My dad was the one who found us,&quot; Claudia started to sob as she remembered the event. &quot;My....my fad tried to seperate us. When he did Mary pushed him. He....he fell over when his prosthwtic gave out. Mary and I were horrified. I...I told her I hated her, she....she fled the house crying. Since then..I havent had too many people over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie looked at the girl as she broke into sobs. Kellie realized that the fight in the old timeline would of been sgupid and quickly forgiven. In this timwline though it was seen as personal when the girls brought up eachothers fathers. As a result Mary hated Claudia for bringing up her dead father while Claudia hated Mary for hurting hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Claudia,&quot; Kellie whispered. &quot;Im....Im so sorry. I had no idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither did we,&quot; Mika mumbled. &quot;All I ever knew was you and Mary got in a fight and she hurt your dad. Why didnt you ever tell us the ret of the story?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Im sorry,&quot; Claudia whispered. &quot;I..I should of told you guys. I was just...so angry. I know i was wrong for what I said but...I..just couldnt forgive Mary for hurting my dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia began to cry softly as Mika now approached her. &quot;Shhh its okay,&quot; she said softly as she hugged Claudia. Mika now turned towards Kellie grumpily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now we all know,&quot; she muttered. &quot;So I want to know why you were so interested in dredging this up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie could feel her face go red as she looked her old friends over. She needed to decide quickly if she would tell the girls about being from an alternate timwline or lie. If she lied and thy found out,  she could destroy any chance of truwly reconnecting with her old friends.</p>
