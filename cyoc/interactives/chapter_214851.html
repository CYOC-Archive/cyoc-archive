<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex was putting on his protective gear to get Kyle. the poor crocodile had injured himself in his enclosure. once dressed he entered the exhibit. the reptile house was a nice building. each area was climate controlled for that reptile&#39;s specific needs.  <br />
<br />
when he got there he saw a nasty cut on the crocodile&#39;s tail. &#39;this is not going to be good,&#39; he thought. Kyle was normal a shockingly sweet crocodile. at one time a little girl dropped her teddy bear into his home. he could have destroyed it or even left it.  <br />
<br />
instead, he carefully grabbed it and brought it to shore. the video of this made Kyle the mascot. however, the 35-year-old reptile was also afraid of needles. &quot;this is Alex Newman I&#39;m about to apprehend Kyle. if you do not hear from me in the next couple of minutes send assistance&quot; he radioed in.  <br />
<br />
a man and his two daughters were watching from behind the safety net. after looking at the wound he radioed again. &quot;Scratch that send that vet Oswith here right now. Kyle has...&quot; he stopped he saw from the glass roof the wave. it hit him like a ton of bricks.  <br />
<br />
he awoke an unknown amount of time later to someone nudging him. opening his eyes revealed a blurred image. &quot;are you OK brother?&quot; the creature asked in a concerned way. he was confused as far as he knew he was an only child.  <br />
<br />
the creature came into focus. it was Kyle, the crocodile kept nudging his handler. he sat up and felt off. he looked around and saw no one. the place however looked like a war zone.  <br />
<br />
the enclosure itself was fine. however, the elevated walkway was in shambles. the safety net was in tatters. the safety glass was cracked. the automatic doors were busted and sparking.  <br />
<br />
there were multiple claw marks over the upper area. the most notable thing was the puddles of cum. he couldn&#39;t understand this. the wave doesn&#39;t change reality this way.  <br />
<br />
he soon realized a creature was responsible for it. an unrecognizable sound could be heard in the snake room. he tried to get up but then felt off. his vision was slightly impeded by a leathery green object between his face. not only that but he could see the entire area.  <br />
<br />
even the large tail behind him. &quot;what the&quot; he said reaching back. That&#39;s when he noticed his clawed hands. &quot;I was worried about you brother. when a strange light hit. you went to sleep,&quot; Kyle said.  <br />
<br />
Alex ran to the water. he saw a stocky crocodile man staring back at him. from the look of his body shape he was basically a crocodile with hands. &quot;what happened?&quot; he asked himself.  <br />
<br />
&quot;well the not food were looking at me while you were here. the bright light hit everything. I watched as red stuff from your face drip out. then some of mine and some of yours came together and split in two&quot; he said. clearly, the wave had made the crock smarter, however, he was not a linguist.  <br />
<br />
from what he could understand was this. the wave came and knocked him out. he hurt his head as he fell. the blood from his and Kyle&#39;s wounds was mixed and put into their bodies. this changed both their bodies.  <br />
<br />
for Kyle, it gave him the intelligence of a man. for Alex it gave him the body and instincts of a crocodile. &quot;why are you calling me brother?&quot; he asked. Kyle rose onto two legs.  <br />
<br />
he clumsily stepped towards Alex. &quot;because we are the same. we look the same. smell similar to each other,&quot; he said putting a three-fingered hand on his shoulder. &quot;OK I guess that explains it. can you tell me what happened after that&quot; Alex said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;no once red stuff went in me I slept too,&quot; he said. a monstrous roar came from the snake room. They then saw a piece of the broken door be taken apart by a clawed hand. &quot;I would suggest we find a safe place and call the authorities,&quot; Alex said. Kyle could smell the panic in his scent.  <br />
<br />
&quot;you know this place better than I,&quot; he said gesturing to the door. unfortunately, the wave erased his clothes. even more unfortunate, was the fact that he had a human-like 8-inch cock and balls. looking at his new brother he saw the same for him. &quot;it seems the wave of light erased my key card and radio&quot; he said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;then we will just have to use force,&quot; Kyle said before he rammed the door. the sound echoed as he impacted it. Alex turned and saw a hulk sized Gila monster man come out of the snake room. it seemed the wave this time kept enlarging human genitals.  <br />
<br />
the 9-foot reptile had a 3-foot cock and matching balls. the intelligence of this once human was gone. it was replaced by a horny reptile. his head had broken the door frame as he entered the crocodile habitat. his massive form cracking the safety glass of the walkway.  <br />
<br />
he spotted the two crocodiles and grinned. it didn&#39;t take a moment to realize what he wanted, sex. both brothers ran through the broken door as the Gila monster man jumped into the enclosure. the glass catwalk breaking due to the force. it ran to the door.  <br />
<br />
it then put its hands on the frame a broke it allowing him inside. as Alex ran he remembered reading about this. the infamous mass change event. these events don&#39;t seem to count under the 1,000 amount of people change. in it, a large group of people are changed.  <br />
<br />
this is so massive that the wave seems to draw on the location to make changes. the Japanese village inhabitants were influenced by their river. they became aquatic creatures. fish, mermaids even bird creatures. of course one of them got turned into a kaiju and almost wreaked Tokyo.   <br />
<br />
the next time it happened was in Egypt. those affected became things ranging from Egyptian animals to furry versions of Egyptian gods. the tour guy had become a sarcophagus. this time it seemed that some poor dude was turned into this thing. the 2 of them exited the emergency exit.  <br />
<br />
turning around they saw no sign of the beast. a speaker crackled to life. &quot;we are sorry but an unfortunate accident has forced to zoo to close. all guests are to come to the front&quot; it the cut out. they turned around and saw the reptile house was not opening its doors. no one was leaving.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I think the beast claimed my old home for itself,&quot; Kyle said. Alex could smell the sadness in his brother&#39;s scent. &quot;it is OK bro. we will go to the front. then we&#39;ll go to the adjustment area. as for your old home ill report this and the light waves will come and deal with him&quot; he said placing a hand on his shoulder. with that, the two walked to the front. after raiding a merchandise stall for clothing of course.</p>
