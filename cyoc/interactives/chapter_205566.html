<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maria had never really believed that Demons were evil. Certainly she believed in Angels being Good, but if Demons were truly irredeemably evil, then why would they be allowed to remain? No, she&#39;d decided long ago that her favorite idea of Demons were that of tempters, hunters and punishers. Where Angels were perfect kindness, compassion and love, Demons were flawless wrath, destruction and vengeance. But not directed at humanity as a whole, but at the sinful who would prey upon the weak and the vulnerable. Where Angels preached forgiveness and redemption, Demons hunted the unrepentant and irredeemable. That they tempted mortals was only to expose those who would hide their wicked deeds behind the facade of virtue.<br />
<br />
Looking up at Lilith with disbelief, Maria slowly traced along smooth stone hands and stared into those beautiful, but otherworldly, golden eyes. Her heart thundered in her chest and overwhelmed her ears as she was enraptured by the beautifully inhuman face of her angelic girlfriend. She was both terrified, and incredibly turned on, seeing her this way.<br />
<br />
<i>Maria?</i> Lilith&#39;s voice sounded in her mind again, tinted with concern. <i>What&#39;s wrong? You look strange.</i><br />
<br />
Maria opened her mouth to answer, only to suddenly feel intense vertigo. She stumbled backwards a few steps, letting go of Lilith&#39;s hand in the process. She only made it a short distance across their small apartment before her feet felt strange. &quot;Wh-what&#39;s going on?&quot; She looked downwards just in time to see her feet dissolving into brilliant orange sludge, resembling magma. As she watched the edges of it oozed and surged outwards around her former foot along the floor, though it didn&#39;t burn anything. Instead, it slowly began to darken and harden, taking on the texture and consistency of basalt, and the shape of a hoof.<br />
<br />
Maria wanted to scream, or panic, or run, but all she could do was watch as she felt strange, confusing signals from her body. The change slowly progressed up her leg, subsuming her clothing in the process. Between cracked plates of basalt-like stone were glowing red lines, a vision of the liquid beneath them. Up, up, up it rose along her calves, across her knees, and up to her thighs. There the thickened plates slowly broke into smaller and smaller pieces, until as it passed her hips it smoothed completely into continuous flat grey, pushing outwards and widening her stance noticeably. A brief moment of confusion washed over her as the changes swept past her groin, but she no longer felt anything there.<br />
<br />
As the stone climbed up past her hips, she could feel her waist clenching in. An hourglass-like figure she&#39;d wished she had looking into the mirror on her more melancholy days. But never quite like this. Her stomach flattened entirely, erasing her belly button completely, not even visible abs remained, as though her body had been poured from a single mold. The changes swept up over her chest, both her breasts expanding, though far from being excessively large, enough so to complement her wide hips and narrow waist. If she didn&#39;t look like some kind of statue, she&#39;d have had one of the most alluring figures she&#39;d ever seen. Her breasts were perfectly smooth, round and lacked even the hint of nipples. But at the top of her cleavage, just short of her collar bone, her basalt skin cracked and crumbled, a small circle the size of two of her fingers side by side gave way, the brilliant orange-red beneath the stone visible in radiating lines that highlighted along the tops of her breasts and up along her collar bone as the stone expanded.<br />
<br />
As the liquid tipped up over the tops of her shoulders along her torso, it was like it overflowed the edges of the &#39;cup&#39; that was her body, rushing across her shoulders and down her arms. Her shoulders remained slender, but shortly past her upper arms the stone began to pile layer upon layer once again, cracking into smaller pieces as they progressed down across elbows that looked almost serrated. The black and red flowed across her hands, leaving behind limbs that still looked slender and shapely, but now also sported a myriad of cracks and seemed to radiate heat so heavily it made the air waver around them. Her fingers were long, segmented and ended in claws that glittered like obsidian knives. The combined effect gave the impression of opera gloves, if opera gloves included claws and the ability so sear flesh from bone.<br />
<br />
Finally the change swept up over her head. For a brief moment panic struck her as it covered over her mouth and nose, even her eyes. Leaving her briefly feeling like she might be blinded and suffocating. But the feeling didn&#39;t last more than a moment. She hadn&#39;t had lungs or a heart for some time now, after all, why would she need to breathe? Vision returned a moment later as her flat stone visage cracked and crumbled slightly to reveal eyes which glowed neon purple. Her vision felt... Wrong somehow. Incomplete. Like she wasn&#39;t seeing what she SHOULD be seeing, even though she was seeing what she had always seen. At last the flow of molten stone passed up over the top of her head, as her hair became long strings of brilliant orange liquid which somehow held their own shape, and two horns slowly molded themselves upon her brow.<br />
<br />
For a moment Maria wondered if her changes were over, she felt so strange. But that hope lasted only a moment, as behind her fire lit upon her back, extending into two great blazing wings. At her rear a long whip-like tail extended burning upon its entire length, ending in a razor sharp knot of stone. Finally, above her head a ring of brilliant purple light, matching the color of her eyes, sprang into existence. Five deep crimson eyes opened around its edge, their positions rotated exactly opposite those above Lilith&#39;s. Suddenly she understood why her sense of sight had been so wrong before. She could see everything around her, in all directions, effortlessly. But more than that, she could see the concern and fear pouring off of Lilith&#39;s mind as she looked up at her girlfriend.<br />
<br />
<i>Ah... Ah...</i> Maria&#39;s confusion about how to speak was mercifully short lived, as it seemed to come naturally to her. <i>L-Lilith? Wh-what happened? I... I&#39;m so sorry... I didn&#39;t mean for...</i> Lilith reached down delicately to touch her girlfriend&#39;s cheeks, guiding the demon&#39;s visage closer as she drifted downwards slightly to touch their faces briefly together in something only approximating a kiss. <i>It&#39;s okay Maria. You&#39;re safe now. You have me. I love you, and I always will.</i> The sound of Lilith&#39;s voice in her mind calmed Maria&#39;s fears, somehow she just couldn&#39;t believe the angel before her could ever lie about anything.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Tiffany stared into her crystal ball at the basalt-and-magma demon in disbelief. &quot;Well... That&#39;s... Different?&quot; She tapped her chin thoughtfully as she considered what had happened. &quot;I guess concentrating all that holy power in one place created a need to make an equal amount of unholy power to balance it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She pursed her lips a moment and considered the ramifications of this. &quot;Eh. It&#39;ll probably be fine. The worst that can happen is they end up getting stuck that way. Oh! I should totally try and find out whether or not either of them has any actual magical potential in these forms!&quot; She gestured and pulled a book from her shelf flipping through the pages. &quot;Let&#39;s see... How would I best do that without exposing myself...&quot;</p>
