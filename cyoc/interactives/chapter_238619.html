<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jordan was seething. From other side of the classroom that weird new kid was gawking in his direction, gazing at Jordan’s girlfriend like he was trying to fuck her with his eyes. The broad-shouldered running-back of the Centerville High Football Team used his bulk to block the line of sight between that kid and his girlfriend, Erica. She was sitting right beside Jordan as he shot death rays from his eyes, glaring back at the kid as if sending him a message to back off.<br />
<br />
It didn’t dissuade him at all. That kid just kept up that incessant stare pointing in his direction, obviously trying to court Erica’s attention in his own creepy way.<br />
<br />
What a fucking loser. Not just a loser, but also a furry. If that fake fox tail and false canine fangs he insisted on wearing to school didn’t give him away, those inhuman yellow eyes he looked back at Jordan with were yet another dead giveaway that he was a complete freak. That kid just transferred to Centerville earlier this week and Jordan figured it was time to teach him how things worked around here. If he dreamed a scrawny red-headed nerd like him could outcompete a raven-haired, muscular stud like Jordan, he was about to get one rude awakening.<br />
<br />
The jock clenched his first under his desk, wondering when he was going to get the chance to deck that kid in the face and yank that phony tail out of his pants. There was just something about that sly, undeserved grin he wore that just made him so punchable. It was like he thought he was smarter than Jordan, but little did he know he was making the dumbest mistake imaginable. Jordan wasn&#39;t a stranger to dishing out a little corporal punishment. He would slug a few nerds that bothered him every now and then, but beating this kid was going to feel better than any of them.<br />
<br />
“Teacher!” The boy’s hand suddenly raised in the air, interrupting the ecology lecture with a clumsy, atonal voice. “May I use the bathroom?”<br />
<br />
Jordan snickered; it was so rich! He’d never heard him talk before, but he was almost unintelligible. His voice cracked and shifted pitch, several times in the one sentence, and he gave off the vibe that he’d hardly spoken to anyone before ever! He was by far the biggest plain-as-day loser in whole school, and he was oblivious to it!<br />
<br />
The teacher glanced towards the interruption and sighed. “Felix, this is High School. You don’t need to ask permission to use the bathroom, just go and come back.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, right.” The weirdo smiled, scootching up from his desk and sauntering towards the door, in a weird, blundering gait. Jordan would have laughed at that too, since it looked like he was a toddler just learning to walk! But he saw him coming Erica’s way, spotting a note in Felix’s hand.<br />
<br />
Before the kid had the chance to hand it to his girlfriend, Jordan swiped it away, blocking the exchange like he’d block a pass in Football. Felix didn’t try to fight it at all, he just shot that same smug-looking smirk their way before continuing out the door.<br />
<br />
“… and you see by these population estimates here, local wildlife numbers have been decimated in our community due to the construction of the new Centerville Mall that ate into half of Bryson Forest. Without a new influx of genetically distinct individuals, it’s hard to imagine they will ever recover…”<br />
<br />
Jordan was barely paying any attention to the lecture, letting the teacher’s rambling seep into the background as he uncrumpled the note and read it.<br />
<br />
“Meet me at the bathroom near Chemistry class~” it read, scrawled with shakily drawn letters as if a first grader had written it. There was also a crude drawing of right underneath it. It was of a fox with its forelegs hiked up on top of another fox, presumably fucking.<br />
<br />
“Teach! I’ve gotta use the bathroom too.” Jordan growled out, wadding that sheet of loose-leaf paper into a ball as the teacher glanced back, looking flustered.<br />
<br />
“Didn’t you hear me?” The balding man sighed, exasperated by the interruptions. “The same goes for you. Get up. Go do your business and come back. This isn’t preschool.”<br />
<br />
Jordan stood up, knocking his chair back with so much force it toppled behind him. He’d leave Erica to fix his seat, now was the time to catch up to Felix and lay down the pecking order here at Centerville High.<br />
<br />
As Jordan stepped out the door, he caught a glimpse of that orange fox tail slipping around a corner.<br />
<br />
Was he waiting for Erica to come out? Did he see him? Was he trying to book it now that he saw Jordan coming for him? The jock looked up at a nearby clock, seeing that the next period started in 35 minutes. Plenty of time.<br />
<br />
He strode through the empty halls towards the school’s chemistry wing, still perplexed by how dumb Felix was. So much for identifying as a clever fox!  Now it was Jordan who fancied himself as the fox hunting, Felix, the oblivious rabbit. And to give him something else to smile about, Chemistry classes took place in the morning, so there wasn’t anyone around these rooms right now and there wouldn’t be anyone here until the school day ended.<br />
<br />
Jordan just got luckier and luckier. That idiot, Felix, probably thought he was going somewhere quiet to be alone with Erica, but now he was about to get a date with her bad-ass boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Jordan opened the door to peer inside the boy’s bathroom, spotting Felix’s tail poking out from behind a urinal stall, completely alone.<br />
<br />
Oh, the things he could do: Was he going to start by bashing his teeth in against the wall? Was he going to bend him down and make him kiss the piss-soaked urinal cake in the toilet? No. He was going to rip that tail right off and shove it up his ass first. Jordan just knew he was going to enjoy this. He never felt so strongly about beating someone up before, but his hardening prick poked against his jeans, giving away a nascent sadistic desire aimed at that unsuspecting furry kid.<br />
<br />
Felix just kept on playing the role of a naïve rabbit. He was like prey sitting all by himself in an open field as a fox swooped down in a lightning-fast sprint to capture him! And Jordan did just that.<br />
<br />
In less than a second, he rushed into the bathroom and rammed his burly arm right against the spine of the scrawny kid’s back. He pulled off the blitz just like a football play, ending it with Felix’s stomach squashed flush against the inside of the urinal and his head squished against the brick wall above it.<br />
<br />
It was over before it began. Jordan was more than a head higher than this nerd and was at least 50 pounds heavier. Felix was at his mercy.<br />
<br />
“So…” Jordan chuckled, twisting Felix’s arm behind his back. “Sorry Erica couldn’t make it. Did you have something you wanted to say to my girl?<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah…” Felix mumbled against the wall, shaking in Jordan’s grasp, “I was going to tell her… that you’re gay and she should get a real boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
“Oh! Ohhohoho! I don’t know what fucking Retardsville you came from, but you’re the biggest fucking faggot I’ve ever seen. Wearing half your fursuit to school…” Jordan spat, wrenching the boy’s head sideways as he twisted it so he could see him. “You know, us straight guys were wondering whether that tail’s attached to your pants or if it’s a butt plug. Let’s take a look-see.”<br />
<br />
Jordan released his grasp on his prey’s head and reached down to the base of that tail poking out from Felix’s pants. He clutched it, shifting his foot back to brace himself as he tugged it with all his might!<br />
<br />
“Auugnnff…!” Felix bawled out a grunt, that tail of his stretching taut like a violin string… but it didn’t come off. The jock shot Felix an incredulous look, only for the scrawny furry to return him that same smug smirk that he was giving him in class. Jordan had fire in his eyes now. He yanked it at full-force again and again and again!<br />
<br />
“What the fuck! Is it superglued to your ass or something!?” Jordan roared, letting Felix’s tail go before slamming his fist against his lower back, digging his finger against the hem of the furry kid’s jeans to get to the bottom of this. Jordan just had to know what this thing was, why his hand felt like he was grasping skin underneath all that fur… why it didn’t feel like fake fur at all. He practically ripped the kid’s pants off until he was stripped to his tighty-whities, and Jordan hardly believed what he saw.<br />
<br />
“No fucking way…” Jordan balked at it. A tail. It wasn’t a stapled or glued onto his ass either. It looked like his lower backbone swooped outward just above his butt; spine connected to tail, bright orange fur sprout from his skin.<br />
<br />
“You thought it was a fursuit…?” Felix snickered, “You really wanted me to be a furry, didn’t you? I told you you were gay.”<br />
<br />
Okay. Fuck the tail. All Jason cared about now was wiping that dirty smirk off this idiot’s face!<br />
<br />
He clenched his fist and jabbed at the boy’s neck, forcing him to face the wall as Jordan pressed his whole weight flush into Felix, trying to crush him like a boulder.<br />
<br />
“Shut. The fuck. Up!” He bellowed, his lips hovering so close to Felix’s ear  he could taste the tiny hairs on earlobe. “If you haven’t noticed, I’ve got you pinned! You’re just digging your grave deeper talking shit like that, kid, and you’re gonna take that all back! I want to hear you beg for me not to cave your skull in!”<br />
<br />
Felix squirmed, gasping for breath as the football player made him kiss the dirty wall. To his surprise, the kid didn’t seem ready to give up, his body swaying in Jordan’s grasp, raising to his tip toes and…<br />
<br />
Lifting his tail…?<br />
<br />
Jordan went wide-eyed, his cock bulge on the verge of bursting out of his pants as Felix butted his underwear-ladened ass firmly against the football player&#39;s erection barely constrained inside his pants.<br />
<br />
“Heh…” Felix coughed out a chuckle, Jordan sensing that same enraging smirk in his voice. Gasping for breath and pinned against the wall, Felix somehow thought he was winning.<br />
<br />
The scrawny boy began to sway his butt, rubbing it against the jock&#39;s diamond-hard prick hidden under that thin layer of denim. He let out one more rasping giggle. “I told you… you were gay.”</p>
