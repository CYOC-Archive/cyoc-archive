<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Bad End Palooza is here! Use my chapters as templates and go wild! </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Owen put his hands greedily on Troy’s back, “You know kid, I really can’t get you outta my head. Can’t focus on my work”<br />
<br />
Troy felt Owen’s meaty hands push into Troy’s hard back, his boss really seemed to love him. Troy couldn’t help but feel a little nervous. Owen’s presence over Troy gave him full control do whatever he wanted. Owen moved up and down Troy’s body slowly, feeling the coarse, rough skin, his dick moving in and out rhythmically inside the Rhox’s hole. Troy could feel himself shake and he stifled a moan, trying to keep as quiet as he could. Hot air huffed from his parted lips. Owen grinned as he made Troy his complete toy. <br />
<br />
He laughed, “Maybe I’ll call you Toy from now on instead of Troy.”<br />
<br />
Troy couldn’t think, his legs quaked with ecstasy, he was going to cum. Owen grunted as his thrusts grew deeper and more forceful. Troy couldn’t help it, he exploded all over the barrier they were hiding behind, sticky white painting the solid concrete. Owen wasn’t far behind, letting out his own moan as he sprayed his seed inside Troy. Troy felt the rush of cum leak out his hole as Owen slowed down. Owen caught he breath, leaning down onto Troy, kissing his back repeatedly.<br />
<br />
As Troy began to regain his focus, he looked around to make sure no one had seen them. He then saw a person over by their clothes, someone was fucking with their stuff! <br />
<br />
Troy called out, “Hey stop it! What do you think you’re doing.?”<br />
<br />
“Let ‘em have their fun, pervert ain’t doing nothing. And I’m not done with you yet.” Owen pulled Troy back into a kiss.<br />
<br />
The massive ogre started pounding Troy’s ass again, holding him firm so that Troy couldn’t move. Troy struggled, fighting the returning pleasure from Owen’s cock. What if someone got his book! Who was touching their stuff? <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Troy heard the person say “Shape.” <br />
<br />
Troy instantly began to feel different. His body was heating up and he began to sweat. He recognized this feeling. He was being changed! <br />
He looked as his large hands as they had began to shrink. His three digits split back into five and took on a peach white hue. He could feel his tail receding back into his body, his rough skin becoming smooth and flat. He felt the horn on his head with his hands as they shrank back into his head. Troy’s body began to deflate as well, his muscles losing definition, though he still stayed fit. His stomach shrank as the fat on his body melted away. Troy was certain, he turning back into a human, one who’d clearly been working construction for a month, with the muscles and sun tan to go with it. <br />
<br />
The cock in his ass also began to feel different. Troy angled himself back so he could see Owen. The ogre’s skin was now white-a human white, though ‘ruddy’ was a better descriptor-and he had lost his tusks. Like, Troy, he, too, was also becoming human. Perhaps surprisingly though, not much seemed to change for him. He was still hugely muscled, and he still had a little bit of a gut. Troy chuckled as Owen was essentially the same guy before and after he was changed.<br />
<br />
Troy managed to pull himself away from Owen as the former ogre pulled out a pack of cigs, shook one out, then lit it. Owen took a long drag and blew out a ring of smoke, settling back against the concrete barricade and put his boots up on a nearby oil can. Troy gave Owen a ‘be right back’ gesture and quickly walked over to the person who had his book. <br />
<br />
Troy saw him as he rounded the corner and shouted, “Stop, give that back!” <br />
<br />
As he approached the figure, Troy recognized them. Drew, the obese nerd from DND last night. He got a sinking feeling in his stomach as he watched Drew laugh as he held up his new combined book. It was much larger than when he had it during the D&D game, did he have more books than just Troy’s?<br />
<br />
Drew laughed, “Not to break up your sex, you fur fag, but I couldn’t help but notice you just left your Book out in the open. Not a smart move dumbass.”<br />
<br />
Troy had hoped that Drew wouldn’t come after him, that they could be temporary allies, but it seemed that plan had fallen through. He began to plan on how he could get his book back. Troy suddenly realized a horrible truth; he was completely powerless. Without his book, there was nothing he could do except physically overpower Drew, which wasn’t going to happen. Was this the end of the road?<br />
<br />
Troy begged, “Please, you have to give that back to me, I need it!”<br />
<br />
“Oh my, you want your book back? Why don’t you beg me for it, and I’ll see if I feel like it.”<br />
<br />
Troy had no choice; he bit his lip. He got down on the dirty concrete, completely naked, and bowed before Drew. <br />
<br />
His mind raced for a way out of this. Drew was staring down at him with a sneer.  He needed to come up with something, fast, to persuade Drew not to take him out. Drew was an egotist. That much Troy knew. Flattery would get him everywhere when it came to the obese nerd.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Drew.” Troy spoke quietly.<br />
<br />
“For what?” Drew blinked, the sneer faded as he saw the look of relief on Troy’s face. “Are you….?”<br />
<br />
“He…” Troy faked a hiccup and sobbed. “I couldn’t…couldn’t stop him! He just took me again and again. It’s all gone out of control!”<br />
<br />
“Troy…” Drew swallowed, staring at the tears streaming down the human’s face and glanced over at the construction site. “But I thought you were a filthy furry…”<br />
<br />
“I summoned Lancer because…I was lonely. And he’d never been in the human world before and wanted to play DND. All I wanted to do was make sure no one thought Lancer was out of place. Then everyone turned into furries!”<br />
<br />
Drew’s eyes softened. “Bro, why didn’t you say anything?”<br />
<br />
“I wanted to tell you, but you went on and on about how much you hated them and I knew you have assumed I did it on purpose, so…I’m sorry for lying to you.” Troy wept. “I just didn’t want to get in a fight during DND, and we had so much fun.”<br />
<br />
Drew was smiling now. “Yeah, we did.”<br />
<br />
“You were so smart and cute and you made me laugh.” Troy paused. “I guess I wish I’d met you first, you know? Before all this. I screwed up bad, so maybe it’s for the best you have the Books. I just wanted to say thanks for rescuing me.”<br />
<br />
Drew swallowed, staring down at Troy. Troy could see his mind working, his lips thinned in nervousness. Drew shifted in place, glancing down at the large tome in his hands. Just how many Books had he won? Had Troy said enough to convince him to take mercy on him?<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Drew licked his lips and swallowed, looking around nervously. &quot;I wish we knew each other before all this happened, too. I don&#39;t know if I can trust you.”<br />
<br />
Troy tensed, trying to keep himself calm and miserable-looking. He might not be getting out of this unscathed. Maybe something small, like being Drew’s friend, had been what he was pushing for. It wouldn’t be that upsetting, as he’d still be himself.<br />
<br />
 “Wait! I know!&quot; Drew snapped his fingers and smiled, paging through his Book. “I’ve got a few new spells I could try that might solve this issue perfectly. Ah! Here! Get up, Troy, and cover your ears.”<br />
<br />
Swallowing, feeling cold dread settle in the pit of his stomach, Troy rose from the ground and brushed himself off. What had he done?<br />
<br />
“Okay. I’m scared, but I trust you, Drew.” Troy replied, placing his fingers firmly in his ears.<br />
<br />
Drew pointed at Troy and mouthed a few words, then gestured for Troy to lower his hands.<br />
<br />
Hesitantly, Troy did, feeling the flush of warmth that always accompanied changes. He wondered what Drew had changed and looked up into his handsome boyfriend’s beautiful eyes. His extra-plump boyfriend smiled at him, and the cold feeling in the pit of Troy’s stomach was washed away by a wave of warm, fuzzy happiness.<br />
<br />
Troy smiled back, his cock hardening. His wonderful boyfriend, Drew, saw his erection and his smile grew into a grin. Drew was here to save him, Troy thought, and stepped forward, when his flat stomach gurgled. Troy reached down to clutch it and found himself pushing into something slightly squishy. His hands explored, finding something malleable attached to his stomach. It wobbled as he played with it, his mind slow to realize he now sported a small (though growing increasingly larger) beer belly.<br />
<br />
“D-Drew!” Troy called, poking at the flab that was puffing around his middle. “What’d you do? I’m fat!”<br />
<br />
“Fattening.” Drew corrected, licking his lips. “I like my boyfriends big and soft. Don’t worry, your memories should be catching up.”<br />
<br />
As he said it, Troy realized he was right. All those nights drinking Mountain Dew and eating pizza with his boyfriend had done a number on him. He poked his gut again, the texture of his new paunch thick but pliable. The rest of his body started to swell as a layer of jiggling cellulite covered him warmly and comfortably.<br />
<br />
Troy rubbed his forehead, sweating despite being in the shade, and the bulging biceps he’d gained working construction deflated like balloons. They refilled with soft fatty tissue instead of solid muscle. As his memories of working construction faded, so did the rest of his muscle mass. His thighs started to widen, the gap between them growing smaller and smaller as his hocks plumped.<br />
<br />
The tan he’d gained faded into a pale pasty white from staying indoors all day, playing video games with Drew. His buttocks started to swell and widen as memories of meeting Drew when he’d moved to town in middle school, becoming best friends, replaced memories of hanging out with Dustin. His friend had always forced more and more food on him. One summer, he’d grown so big none of his clothes had fit him when school resumed in the fall. Troy blushed at the memories, cock throbbing as he remembered being made fun of. Being called a lardass had turned him on.<br />
<br />
His muffin top was now growing even more sizeable, ringing around him in a double layer of plush chub, which steadily merged into the fat rolls that formed below his shoulders or the massive swollen protrusion of his belly, which pleasantly wobbled and swelled. His fat ass was like a counterbalance to his beachball-sized gut, which sloped down from his softening pecs before jutting outwards in front of him dramatically. <br />
<br />
New memories, of Drew’s attempts to fatten him growing more overt, entered his mind. Troy moaned and burped, tasting all those years of extra pizza and shakes made of heavy cream filling his mind. His chest tingled and he reached up just in time to feel his tight pecs simply loosen and flop into his hands, nipples widening as they sagged down his belly, flooding with fat. Troy played with his plump chest, cock leaking a steady stream of precum onto his underbelly and down his wobbly thighs.<br />
<br />
He should fight this, he belatedly realized, but the fattening nerd was too turned on by his flabby form to care, pinching and prodding at the chub. He chuckled as his face sank into his flabby neck. Jowls formed around his cheeks while his wobbling doublechin was quickly joined by a triple chin. Troy grinned dopily and pinched his cheeks together, his mind slowing slightly as obesity took its toll on his brain. His thoughts were slightly more sluggish, though he was no less intelligent. <br />
<br />
Troy’s stomach grumbled and he felt oddly hungry despite having gained so much weigh. He gave his massive tummy a rub. Troy looked up and saw that Drew was eyeing him appreciatively. He started to waddle towards his less obese boyfriend, playing with a roll of flab. <br />
<br />
“Hmm, you’re starting to look finished.” Drew smiled as Troy embraced him, enjoying his boyfriend’s soft form. “But not quite.”<br />
<br />
Troy felt itchy and began scratching himself as a wave of body hair erupted from his pores. He turned from fat pig to heavily carpeted nerd, a beard poofing from his face as he scratched it. Soon, the growth settled as the hair came up from his back and over his shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Kiss me?” Drew asked.<br />
<br />
Troy remembered when Drew had come out to him. They’d just won the Battle of Warsong Gulch in WoW and had turned to celebrate when their lips had accidentally met. At first, Drew and he had played it off as an accident. But then Drew had suggested they try it again, to prove they weren’t gay. And they had, and the night ended with them sucking each other off. It was the happiest night of Troy’s life.<br />
Troy leaned forward and kissed his lover sensuously, arms roving around his boyfriend’s body. Drew kneaded his massive ass that he’d worked so hard to build, played with Troy’s tender moobs, and ran a hand down to Troy’s crotch. He paused, feeling Troy’s ten-inch length.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm. You’re big.” Drew murmured, frowning.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m big for you.” Troy said, going for another kiss, then gasped as his boyfriend reached down and took hold of his cock. He hung his head over Drew’s shoulder and held him tight, moaning as he began jerking him off.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Drew spoke softly, running his hands up and down Troy’s 10-inch pole. “Let’s change that.”<br />
<br />
Change? Troy thought, trying to concentrate in spite of his lover’s pudgy hand on his cock. Did he mean to…?<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait, Drew!&quot; Troy tried to stop his boyfriend, something inside him fighting back as Drew whispered something, then grabbed his thick pole and began to gently pushed it into him, smiling the whole time.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need something that lewd.&quot; Drew said as Troy gasped and moaned, the sensations playing across his dick intensifying as it dwindled.<br />
<br />
Oh god, he wanted to stop him but-HNG!-but it felt so good! He continued to struggle until Drew whispered something. New memories flooded his mind, of having a dicklet instead of a proud ten-incher, being laughed at in the locker room. The memories had him rock hard as he reveled in the shame. Of course, he’d always had a micropenis. Why would he need anything bigger, when his boyfriend’s huge schlong more than made up for it? He relaxed, thrusting slightly into Drew’s hand, willing the extra inches of unneeded cock-meat away. <br />
<br />
“S-smaller.” Troy gasped.<br />
<br />
Drew grinned and pushed a little more. He’d originally intended to leave him with three inches, but he was so turned on by Troy’s moans that he couldn&#39;t help himself, pressing it in further, leaving Troy with a throbbing half-inch chode.  When only a nub remained, Drew gave it a quick rub with his thumb and Troy gasped, bucking his hips and staring lovingly into his boyfriend’s eyes as he came. A few pathetic spurts of cum dribbled onto the pavement.<br />
<br />
Drew’s fingers pressed more firmly, gently tucking the little nub under a fold of fat, lost under Troy’s hairy gut. <br />
<br />
“How do you feel?” Drew asked, leering.<br />
<br />
“Much better.” Troy sighed in relief as Drew rubbed his furry gunt, his little twitchy nub cozily cradled in soft, warm fat.<br />
<br />
“I think I’ll keep you like this…for a little while.” Drew smiled to himself. “This is so fun!”<br />
<br />
Troy wondered why Drew was rubbing his cocklet. He wished that he would stick a finger up his ass, get his prostate going. But alas, Drew withdrew his hand, moist with Troy’s colorless excretions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, let&#39;s go home and-&quot; Drew began, when a shout came from Owen&#39;s direction. <br />
<br />
“Where are ya kid, finished my cig and I’m ready for round three!” Owen shouted. <br />
<br />
The huge man rounded the corner and came to a stop when he saw the couple. He eyed Troy and Drew with a lewd grin. Troy vaguely recalled the man stripping him and using his loose hole, but it was all so vague.<br />
<br />
“Hey big boy, I was wondering where you’d run off to.” Owen said to Troy with a grin. Then his eyes slid to Drew, who puffed his chest out. “You never told me you had a cute tubby boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
“You’re the brute who touched my lover?” Drew spat, face red, jowls wobbling indignantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Brute? Heh, tough talk coming from the pervert that was fucking with our clothes.” Owen’s nostril flared in lust and anger. “I just got done with his ass, come here and let me work my magic on you, fatty.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;You think I&#39;ll let you get away with messing with my boyfriend? I&#39;ll show you real magic!&quot; Drew spat and pointed at the big human. “Shape!”<br />
<br />
Owen was walking towards Drew, but stumbled as his legs and arms withered and shrank back into his body. He flopped on the ground, eyes wide in horror as he realized what had happened. Owen looked up at Drew as Troy’s boyfriend stomped over to the formerly bigger man and stared down at him, eyes venomous.<br />
<br />
“Please, I just-I just wanted to fuck, cub!”<br />
<br />
“You wanna fuck, huh?” Drew sneered.<br />
<br />
Owen nodded frantically. “Yes! He has a nice ass. And, you know, I like you too. Kinda a hot little chub bear.”<br />
<br />
Drew circled the man he’d reduced to a torso, patting his chin. He flipped through the Book and found a spell that caught his eye and smiled. Troy stood, shivering as a breeze picked up and played across his hairy, morbidly obese form, while he watched his boyfriend taunt the construction worker. His fingers played with his nubby cocklet. It was kinda hot watching his boyfriend take out the trash like this.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you like my boyfriend&#39;s ass so much, since you’ll be in it every night.” Drew said, shoving the man’s torso over, revealing two wobbly cheeks and his tight, unused hole.<br />
<br />
“W-wait! I’m a top!” Owen squirmed helplessly.<br />
<br />
“So am I.” Drew smiled, licking his fingers and shoving them inbetween Owen’s big, hairy asscheeks.<br />
<br />
Owen groaned as the cub easily worked his fingers into his hole. He didn’t know what was going on, how the kid had managed to use such powerful magic on him. But as the nerdy bear’s probing fingers found his prostate, he couldn’t help but moan. After another minute of working his hole, Drew seemed to be satisfied with his looseness and straddled him.<br />
<br />
“I don’t relish fucking oafs like you, but I do enjoy breaking them.” Drew sneered as he shoved his rather short and stubby cock into Owen’s hole.<br />
<br />
Owen gasped in discomfort. He wasn’t the kind of guy who thought much of pain, it was just an unpleasant comfortableness that made him want to poop. That was mostly why he was a top-bottoming just didn’t get him off. Sure, a prostate massage was nice, but he’d rather feel his thick dick stretch a man’s hole.<br />
<br />
It was clear he wasn’t going to be getting off from this, but Owen knew that he was in danger. If he offended the chubby nerd on top of him, things were going to get worse. So he decided to feign pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Oh man, just like that.” Owen moaned, writhing beneath Drew.<br />
<br />
“Shut it, oaf!” Drew smacked him in the ear.<br />
<br />
It stung, but when Owen looked back at the cub, he saw a blush and a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
“S-sorry,” Owen feigned a stutter, acting like the bottoms he’d fucked. “You’re just so big!”<br />
<br />
“Gonna be a bit bigger when I’m done with you.” Drew snarled and thrust harder.<br />
<br />
Owen felt the cock inside him prod his hole faster and faster, and clenched his hole around it. Drew groaned, bucking his hips slowly. Then he trembled and thrust as deep as he could-and finally touched Owen’s prostate, making the big construction worker shiver in pleasure. Then his cock throbbed and he unloaded inside the big man.<br />
<br />
“Merge!” Drew spoke through clenched teeth as he came, pointing down at Drew and clutching his Book.<br />
<br />
Owen felt a wet warmth in his ass as his bowels filled with the nerd’s warm seed. However, the flooding of his bowels quickly became the least of his concern as an unnatural sensation washed over him. A swelling, burning sensation traveled up along Owen’s belly, making him feel nauseous. The limbless construction worker&#39;s focus grew hazy and before he knew it, his anal ring started to tense around the shaft, hugging it tightly.<br />
<br />
The sensation of the Drew’s cock in his ass seemed to vanish, and the fat nerd’s cum felt as if it were traveling more freely now up through his intestines. Owen could feel his butt slowly sink into Drew’s groin with a few loud squishes and crunches as his waist deformed. <br />
<br />
Glancing behind him, the big construction worker’s eyes bore witness to a sight he could not comprehend. <br />
<br />
Just below Owen’s waist was not his hips, but rather a pink, swollen, veiny mass that fused seamlessly with Drew’s groin. A heavy, foreign, burning, yet pleasant sensation washed over the big construction worker’s lower torso. The cock flesh slowly traveled  up his belly and it began to slim and barrel out into a cylindrical shape. To his dismay, his own body reacted positively to the sensation, his own cock growing erect and tensing. Owen struggled, trying to squirm free, but it only made his sensitive lower torso tense and stiffen, as though it were excited by his attempts to escape his fate. <br />
<br />
He looked up and saw Drew grinning, a hand descending to slowly stroke the newly sensitive skin of his torso.<br />
<br />
“Gglurk! Mmmmmmblgh!” Owen exclaimed, his voice unable to form words as cum flooded his mouth and oozed from between his lips.<br />
 <br />
He continued to struggle, though it was only making things worse as his gut shrank, the firm flab becoming spongy cock-flesh. Drew continued rubbing him and Owen found himself leaning into those lovely caresses. It felt oddly right and normal to be stroked, the hands strangely familiar to him.<br />
<br />
“Mmmmmblugh!” A thick stream of cum shot from his mouth, splattering onto the pavement. “Mmmmblugh! Blugh! Nnnngh....blugh!”<br />
 <br />
“There you go big guy, let it all out.” Drew smirked, continuing to stroke Owen’s sensitive torso.<br />
<br />
With each weak exclamation, more of the fat nerd’s cum jetted from his mouth. He began to slide closer and closer towards Drew, and Owen realized he was shrinking. His ribcage began to collapse, and he no longer breathed. For some reason, though he was light-headed, he wasn’t suffocating, either. Owen felt the pudgy hand squeeze him and he couldn’t help himself. His own cock jerked and spasmed as he had an orgasm, the fuzzy orgasmic bliss never fully going away as his penis and testicles vanished into the throbbing urethra that had traveled through his abdomen. <br />
<br />
Owen could feel that pulse move closer and closer to his head. He knew, as it passed the line on his barreling chest and his nipples were absorbed, that not much of his body was left. His face began to redden as it filled with blood and began to swell, distorting his features.<br />
Drew spit into his hand and began to rub the back of Owen’s head. Owen burbled a moan of pleasure. What little hair that was left on his head fell off and the rubbing further distorted his features, each rub smearing him away. It felt good, really good. <br />
<br />
His mind began to slow, though he was too caught up in the gentle rubs and squeezes to notice it. His ears vanished and nostrils swelled shut, but all he could think about was how good it all felt, how he could feel something in him begin to rise. His brain felt swollen and clogged and he needed to get it all out. Owen felt his head deform completely into a beautiful, mushroom-like tip, the thumb rubbing his mouth as it turned into a slit, smearing precum over his eyes as the closed, never to open again.<br />
<br />
The pleasant bliss was all he thought about, all he could understand, all he would ever understand again. Drew rubbed him faster and faster. Distantly, The big cock felt something beneath him begin to clench and then what was left of his mind exploded in as ropes of white, sticky cum shot from his mouth. Above him, Drew moaned in ecstasy, toes curling in his shoes. Spurt after spurt of cum shot out for a good minute. It was the best orgasm either of them had ever experienced in their lives. The stream of cum eventually slowed to a stop.<br />
<br />
Drew panted happily, cum covering his hand and joining the mess on the asphalt below. His erection faded, and he sighed and walked over to where Troy and Owen had left  their clothes. He picked up the construction worker’s shirt. His heavy balls bounced and thick, meaty, foot-long cock jiggled as he cleaned himself off and walked back towards Troy. He looked down at his hefty crotch and tucked it back in his shorts, patting the considerable bulge with a smile.<br />
<br />
“That was hot, babe.” Troy panted, hand coated with cum as he fingered himself with one pudgy digit, his flab wobbling.<br />
<br />
“No, you’re hot.” Drew pulled him into a kiss, hands gripping Troy’s pliable fat and jiggling him. <br />
<br />
“Drew…” Troy moaned into the kiss as he felt his flab jiggle around his fat pad and came again, shuddering in his boyfriend’s embrace. “I love you.”<br />
<br />
“I love you too, babe.” Drew smirked and pulled away.<br />
<br />
Troy watched his form blur the further away from him the chubby nerd went. He reached for his pocket and found himself gripping flab. The breeze blew through his body hair again, ruffling it, and he realized he was naked.<br />
<br />
“W-wait. Where’s my glasses? And my clothing?” Troy asked, looking around and scratching his beard.<br />
<br />
“Here.” Drew handed him a pair of thick black-rimmed glasses. <br />
<br />
Troy put them on just in time to see Drew toss him a huge, XXXL t-shirt with a Triforce logo on it. He pulled it over himself with some effort, trying to get it over his belly, but failing. A good two inches of furry belly stuck out from the bottom of his favorite shirt. He waddled over to the crate his pants and underclothes were on and pulled them on. His stretch-fit jeans struggled to hold in Troy’s ass completely, leaving his crack exposed. After slipping on his shoes, Troy looked up, panting and out of breath, at his wonderful boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“Do I look good?” Troy asked, wheezing.<br />
<br />
“Perfect.” Drew grinned and pulled him into another kiss. “You wanna get in a game of League before I put this new pole to use, babe?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah!” Troy’s enlarged heart swelled with joy and he hugged his boyfriend tight. “I call bottom!”<br />
<br />
“Of course you do.” Drew smiled, rubbing Troy’s wide ass. “Let’s go.”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
“Hey babe.” Troy said, waddling into the den with a couple of greasy pizzas in his flabby arms. <br />
<br />
It was growing harder for him to move these days with all the pounds he’d packed on, though Drew had promised him that he’d reverse all the weight once he became immobile so they could start it over again. There was a flat-screen TV that took up the entire wall of their lovely mansion. His husband, Drew, sat on the couch as he ran his toon through another end-game raid in WoW.  He’d put on about fifty pounds and would likely grow fatter as the years passed, in spite of owning the Book of Body, now.<br />
<br />
On his lap was Lancer, their fat tabby cat. Drew hadn’t liked the thought of anyone having fucked his boyfriend besides him, so he’d turned the former summon into an animal, discretely erasing him from existence. Troy had no idea he’d ever summoned the Leonin in the first place, as he’d given the Book of Beasts and Myth to his husband when he found out he was a Book owner.  At least, that’s what his Modified memories told him.<br />
<br />
He gently set the pizzas down and fell back onto the couch next to his husband with a grunt. Owen finally took off his headset and looked at him, a smile crossing his wider face.<br />
<br />
“Hey hubby.” Drew teased, rubbing Troy’s thigh, making his dicklet harden.<br />
<br />
“Hey sweetheart.” Troy leaned over and kissed his husband, sending the cat to the floor with the movement. “Whatcha doin’?”<br />
<br />
“I’m waiting for the healers to get their mana back.” Drew explained, pointing at the screen. “Mark’s got that new healer strat going.”<br />
<br />
“Nice!” Troy exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Drew leaned over and opened a box of pepperoni pizza, Troy’s favorite. He picked up the cheesy slice, folded it, and gently fed his lover. Troy leaned back while his husband shoved slice after slice into his maw, one hand rubbing his gut. He was getting so big. They finished off the box and Troy let out a burp.<br />
<br />
“Good one, babe!” Drew chuckled. “Man, I can’t believe we won the game and got all the Books.”<br />
<br />
“We make a good team.” Troy smiled, rubbing Drew’s inner thigh. “And how could a guy as smart as you lose to anyone?”<br />
<br />
Drew’s cock twitched in his pants and rose, tenting his athletic shorts. Troy shoved the coffee table out of the way and got on his knees, spreading his husband’s legs. Drew leaned back and put his headset back on while Troy dutifully suckled and nursed on his husband’s foot-long cock.<br />
<br />
Soon, his husband tapped his shoulder, making him jiggle. Troy turned himself over and pulled down his pants, exposing his wide, hairy ass. Drew slumped forward and neatly slid his huge cock into his rectum. They’d fucked so often that the anal ring was always loose, now. Drew’s cock seemed to tense and squirm with a mind of its own as it pounded his prostate relentlessly.<br />
<br />
As warmth flooded his insides, his husband filling him with his cum, Troy felt his own cock twitch and unload into the front of his pants, leaving a tiny little wet spot on the front of his shorts. The panted together for a minute until his husband pulled out and resumed playing his game. Troy smiled. He was the luckiest man in the world. He hiked up his shorts and went to log in on his own account.</p>
