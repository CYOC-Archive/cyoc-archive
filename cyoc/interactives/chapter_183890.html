<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Absolutely!” exclaimed Clark. “I mean, if you think we can, that is.” <br />
<br />
A spark of motivation swelled within Nick, knowing now that his long-time player of a best friend was finally reciprocating feelings that he, himself, had long since quelled and repressed. All it took was the weekend-long removal of all their adult worries and a regression-fueled nostalgia trip.<br />
<br />
Nick replied, very determined, “Whether or not we can, I wanna try!”<br />
<br />
Even in the dim lighting of the late hour, Clark could see the fervor on Nick’s face. “Alright!... Soooo…” Clark paused, waiting to see if the older boy would take the lead, but to no avail. “Sooo… how do we—or I mean, how—,” but Nick interrupted, much to Clark’s relief. <br />
<br />
“Well, I don’t think we’re really old enough to do anything, umm, toooo grown-up… or intimate, if you know what I mean,” Nick hinted, trying to temper the younger boy’s expectations.<br />
<br />
Clark, having already felt the incredible reduction his little tool had undergone, understood the meaning of Nick’s statement. “Yeah,” Clark laughed, “I didn’t really think so either.”<br />
<br />
Nick, however, reassured the younger boy. “You don’t need size for this, though,” and he moved his hand to the front of Clark’s briefs, eliciting a visceral response from his friend. Clark quite enjoyed the sensation, and the two continued like this before each boy removed the other’s underwear, and their boyish explorations continued as such.<br />
---<br />
Nonetheless, after several very frustrating attempts on each boy’s behalf and many wasted minutes, the two lied still at each other’s side, neither having attained the level of satisfaction they so desired. <br />
<br />
After a moment, Clark sat up, reaching for his discarded underwear. Seeing this, Nick did the same.<br />
<br />
“Nick,” Clark spoke softly, breaking their silent repose, “I don’t think we’re old enough to do this yet.”<br />
<br />
Nick, pulling on the tighty whities, reluctantly agreed. “Yeah, hehe, I think you’re right, dude.”<br />
<br />
Clark finished adorning himself in the boy’s briefs, and Nick pulled him into a warm embrace. “I could, you know… maybe make us a little older? That way we—,” but this time, Nick was interrupted.<br />
<br />
“No!” Clark quickly countered the idea, but explained, “No, it’s okay, really. I mean… I’m fine with just this for now.” He wriggled a bit in Nick’s embrace, driving the point home. “Like, as an adult, you know I’m like always hooking up with whoever, and I can get that any time, ya know?”<br />
<br />
Nick nodded, acknowledging, with mild jealousy, his friend’s active sex life.<br />
<br />
Clark continued, “I don’t need to rush this… with you, I mean. After this weekend, it’s back to adulthood and work and bills anyway… so it’d be nice to maybe really embrace being kids right now, even if that means we gotta deal with the worst blue-balls anyone’s ever had.” Nick joined in Clark’s laughter at their shared expense and held his smaller friend just a bit tighter.<br />
<br />
“Good point, dude. And after this weekend, we can do *whatever* we want together,” Nick remarked, moving his hand down again to the front of Clark’s briefs, forcing a very cute whimper, much to Nick’s utter delight. “We’ll be all grown up again and $1000 richer,” Nick resumed.<br />
<br />
“True. That’ll be nice,” Clark agreed before reaching down to remove Nick’s hand as it frustratingly stirred his boyhood to life. “But for now, you’ve gotta stop with the teasing. There’s only so much dick chafing against tighty whities that I can take.” <br />
<br />
Nick laughed and quickly apologized for his part in Clark’s adorable frustration.<br />
<br />
Clark returned to his thought, “Seriously though, dude, these things are so tight! Why’d we ever wear these?” Clark pulled probingly at the waistband and white material of the briefs. “No wonder I switched to boxers. Gotta play it loose and cool, man.”<br />
<br />
Nick, too, probed his underwear, confirming their snugness that was, upon reflection, not too entirely different from the boxer-briefs he had grown accustomed to following the onset of puberty. <br />
<br />
“Well,” Nick playfully argued, “it’s your own fault for trying to make me feel like a such kid this weekend. You know, they make boxers and boxer-briefs for kids these days? But you saw the tighty whities and thought, ‘Oh, yeah this’ll be really funny to see Nick in these again,’ so *you* can suck it up until Monday.”<br />
<br />
Clark chuckled, realizing now the part he had played in his own discomfort. “Yeah, sure, whatever, but ya know what? I was totally right!” Clark’s laugh intensified. “It *was* really funny seeing your face when you pulled out the undies.”<br />
<br />
Nick flicked a finger on Clark’s back in jovial disapproval, Clark flinching just a bit in response, his laughter unperturbed.<br />
<br />
“I just didn’t expect that I’d end up wearing them, but a certain *someone*,” Clark turned now to face the older boy, “went and regressed *me*, too!” Now it was Clark’s turn to deliver a chastising flick. “And you made *me* the younger one! What’s with that?!” <br />
<br />
Nick derived a thorough satisfaction from Clark’s play frustration. “Like I said, dude: You can’t tell me no if I’m the older one. Besides, when we were kids the first time, you would always decide what we did and boss me around. I figured it’d be fun to swap roles this time!”<br />
<br />
Clark’s face scrunched into a boyish, pouty expression, but his dissatisfaction was only more endearing to Nick.<br />
<br />
“Plus, you were so big and strong as a man, so I thought that the combined effects of being thrown back into boyhood *and* being the younger boy would be even more fun for you.” Nick explained, hoping that his moping friend would come around. <br />
<br />
Nick’s tone softened, a previously absent sentimentality woven into his words as he spoke them. “I mean, you were a year older than me, and you were always taller and stronger, too, and I was always the nerdy kid at school… but you never let anyone pick on me.” By now, Clark was turned way from him; Nick reached over again to pull the boy in. “You even beat up Connor in 8th grade when he wouldn’t stop making fun of me after I brought that biology model kit to school.”<br />
<br />
“I *did* do that, huh?” Clark grinned, recalling his swift removal of that smug fucking grin from Connor’s pathetic face. “Good times, man.”<br />
<br />
Nick continued, “I never forgot that… And then, when I came out sophomore year, you—,” but Nick paused, interrupted by a sudden surge of emotion flooding into his younger, more sensitive brain. “You didn’t let anyone bully me…” Nick’s eyes began to water, but he promptly dried his eyes with the pillowcase before anyone could say that the boy had been crying.<br />
<br />
“I’m just saying that you don’t have to be big and strong for me anymore... At least not for this weekend.” By this point, Nick wasn’t aware of how tightly he was holding Clark, and the younger boy wiggled a bit to signal that this was the case.<br />
<br />
Nick loosened his hold, and Clark used the opportunity to now face the older boy. “You’re my best friend, dude...” <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Clark leaned in and deftly planted a small, tender kiss on Nick’s cheek. “I’ll always be strong for you.”<br />
<br />
The two each shifted to lie on their backs, each now realizing their tiredness, owing to their fruitless midnight explorations.<br />
<br />
Clark gently took Nick’s hand in his own before finishing his thought, “But you can have this one weekend,” Clark smiled up at the ceiling. “Just don’t get too cocky,” and the two boys chuckled drowsily before drifting off to sleep together. The former late-twenty-somethings looked now to be just the cutest little couple, in their matching tighty whities, hands embraced in a delicate, unconscious union.</p>
