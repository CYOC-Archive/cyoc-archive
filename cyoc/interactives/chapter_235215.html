<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria paced anxiously inside the hospital. A few hours ago, she was enjoying a quiet night out with Felicia, Naomi, and Diane. When Caleb texted her she thought nothing of it, until she read it. Connor was hurt.<br />
<br />
Rushing to the hospital, Gloria called her friends, telling them everything she knew. As soon as she arrived, she could see Connor&#39;s friends as well as Duke and Sasha. &quot;Gloria,&quot; Sasha said quickly. &quot;Is Caleb with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought he was here,&quot; Gloria replied anxiously. &quot;When did you guys get here?&quot; Duke motioned to Nat, explaining how the young dhamphir called him. &quot;She said to come quickly,&quot; he stated. &quot;I guess Caleb went out. We honestly thought he was coming to get you.&quot; Gloria shook her head no, her anxiety growing. &quot;Glo, he&#39;ll be okay,&quot; Felicia said softly. &quot;You know how he is. I&#39;m sure whatever it is isn&#39;t that serious.&quot; Gloria bit her lip, hoping they were right as she continued to worry.<br />
<br />
As Adam and Jackie joined them, Gloria began to hear of what happened. Caleb and his brother were attacked while on patrol. Connor and Miles were both injured with Connor&#39;s injuries being the worse. Currently Connor was in surgery while Miles&#39;s parents came to take him home. &quot;So does anyone know who the vampire was?&quot; Diane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think it could have been Cassie? Maybe she wanted revenge on Caleb. I mean what else could she be doing these days with her spare time?&quot; Naomi suggested.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile over in the vampire nation, Cassandra and Duchess were in bed together naked enjoying each other&#39;s pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH! OH! THAT&#39;S IT MISTRESS, DON&#39;T STOP! DON&#39;T STOP!&quot; Duchess hollered out in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Back at the hospital, Jackie simply raised an eyebrow at Naomi&#39;s proclamation &quot;Yeah, let&#39;s just wait for Caleb on that.&quot; Thankfully for the group, Julia quickly found them. Escorting them into a family room, she stated she would send Caleb when he arrived. It didn&#39;t take long.<br />
<br />
Gloria gasped as Caleb entered the room, his hands coated in blood with a thousand yard stare on his face. &quot;Caleb, what happened?&quot; she gasped. Caleb was at first silent, his friends worried as they waited in anticipation. &quot;How&#39;s Connor,&quot; he croaked. &quot;He&#39;s out of surgery,&quot; Gloria stated. &quot;He&#39;s going to be okay. Julia....Julia says he&#39;s going to need a hip replacement. Your mom and Spark are upstairs now.&quot; Caleb simply nodded, his eyes glazed and unfocused. Gloria couldn&#39;t be sure what happened, but she knew it couldn&#39;t be good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Duke,&quot; Caleb finally said, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;I need your help.&quot; Duke nodded, Caleb was his closest friend. Whatever he needed, the dhamphir would certainly help. &quot;Wyatt attacked my brother,&quot; Caleb continued. &quot;Sent an assassin to kill him. I...I tried to stop him. S.P.E.A.R and Sarah already turned their back on me, even though Wyatt&#39;s assassin admitted it. I need your help destroying Wyatt and his family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke balked, this didn&#39;t make any sense. After everything that happened recently, why would Wyatt attack the Morelands. &quot;Caleb,&quot; Duke stammered. &quot;I...I can&#39;t! This doesn&#39;t make any sense. Wyatt wouldn&#39;t do this...he&#39;s changed. He wouldn&#39;t put his family in danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb turned slightly, his eyes flaring with anger. &quot;He hasn&#39;t.&quot; he growled, his voice low and foreboding. &quot;I was there when Hannibal attacked. C&#39;mon Duke, we both know how vampires are. They tortured you for years. Now, they&#39;re hiding behind S.P.E.A.R to take out what&#39;s left of my family. Please, this needs to end. Wyatt and his entire family need to be put down NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke shifted in place, torn between his loyalty to Caleb and his love for his nieces and nephews. He may not like Wyatt, but he needed more confirmation. Maybe he could talk to Wyatt? Maybe he could find out what happened and get to the bottom of things. What he couldn&#39;t do is slaughter Wyatt&#39;s children. &quot;Caleb,&quot; he stammered. &quot;I...I can&#39;t help you with this. I&#39;m not going to murder Wyatt&#39;s children. There has to be another way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb&#39;s eye twitched, his rage so encompassing he couldn&#39;t think clearly. All he knew was that the Tepes family was trying to murder his family, and no one believed him. Roaring in anger, Caleb struck. The group gasping in shock as a right hook now floored Duke. &quot;ANOTHER WAY?!&quot; he yelled. &quot;Your half brother nearly murders my little brother and you want to find another way? After everything your father did, you would choose them? I thought we were friends Duke?!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Caleb stepped forward, fists clenched in anger, Sasha moved in front of Duke. Snarling the ebony haired woman now used her magic to knock Caleb back. &quot;Back off, Caleb!&quot; she growled, her eyes and ring now glowing.<br />
<br />
Now it was Gloria who stepped forward, a look of astonishment on her face. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she gasped, her ring hand at the ready. &quot;Glo, this stinks and you know it,&quot; Sasha said quickly. &quot;Think for a second?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think,&quot; Gloria asked, her face contorting in rage. &quot;That&#39;s rich Sasha. Caleb tells us his family was attacked by the very vampires that tried to kill us not too long ago and you tell me to think.&quot; Gloria&#39;s magic now washed over the room, causing the floor to crack. &quot;I don&#39;t know what happened at that manor but I believe Caleb! Wyatt and his family have shown me NOTHING that makes me think they&#39;re innocent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you don&#39;t know shit Glo,&quot; Sasha growled. &quot;All I know is that I&#39;m not going to sit by while your boyfriend murders a bunch of toddlers.&quot; Both women now began to charge a spell, Sasha passing as both Naomi and Diane directed a spell at Sasha. &quot;Don&#39;t do it Sasha,&quot; Diane warned. &quot;I&#39;m warning you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Diane, Naomi, what are you doing,&quot; Felicia exclaimed, preparing a spell of her own. &quot;You can&#39;t possibly be on board with this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In case you forgot Felicia we&#39;ve dealt with the Tepes family and their bullshit before,&quot; Naomi stated, furrowing her brow. &quot;Remember Cassie? She used us to gain information on everybody! Last time I checked she still worked for Wyatt. Nothing I&#39;ve seen from that family tells me they wouldn&#39;t stoop to this.&quot; Naomi now began to glow, whatever anime power she was rapping onto illuminating the entire room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys this isn&#39;t helping,&quot; Jackie exclaimed. &quot;Everyone take a breath and relax!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s side are you on Jackie?&quot; Felicia and Diane asked as they glared at the brunette woman. &quot;No one&#39;s,&quot; Jackie exclaimed. &quot;But us tearing each other apart won&#39;t solve anything!&quot; Despite Jackie&#39;s pleas, no one seemed willing to budge. Duke, Sasha, Felicia, and Adam on one side with Caleb, Gloria, Naomi, and Diane on the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Duke called, slowly rising to his feet. &quot;This isn&#39;t helping!&quot; Slowly everyone paused, watching as the dhamphir gave Caleb a forlorn look. &quot;Caleb, I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t help you with this,&quot; he said sadly. &quot;I&#39;m certain there&#39;s an explanation and if Wyatt is guilty, he&#39;ll be punished, but I won&#39;t murder his children.&quot; Caleb furrowed his brow, looking to Adam. &quot;Look man,&quot; Adam stated. &quot;I trust Duke. If you&#39;re looking me to take a side, then I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m staying with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
An awkward silence now lingered amongst the friends. Caleb and Duke staring at one another. Without another word, Duke, Sasha, Felicia and Adam exited, leaving Caleb and the others alone. For now it seemed, Gloria and her friends were at an impasse, one that would alter their lives for the foreseeable future.</p>
