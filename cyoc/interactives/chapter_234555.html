<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At first, she didn’t believe anything would happen. Concerned what had been eating at her was in her mind, Lisa suddenly gasped. A warm sensation rushing across her abdomen and down into her groin, she gulped, then moaned when she shifted in place and her underwear rubbed against the area between her legs and the legs of her jeans brushed against her inner thighs. A buzzing, tingly sensation washing over her vulva and up into her vagina, she stuffed as much of her fist in her mouth as she could in attempt to keep herself from crying out as she experienced for the first time in her life her body becoming aroused. Wanting her pants off as the feeling now went up into her chest and her nipples grew hard, sensitive, she stood and struggled for a bit to undo the button and zipper on her jeans with one hand as she kicked off her shoes and socks.<br />
<br />
Pants off at last, she didn’t stop as she also slipped off her panties. Naked from the waist down, she stumbled across her bedroom and flopped down on her bed. Spreading her legs, unsure of what to do to relieve herself, the soft, cotton comforter touching her exposed skin, and making what she was feeling worse, she rolled over onto her stomach. Images of bitches in hear dancing through her head, she couldn’t help herself as she started to rub her privates against the comforter. Liking how it felt, she reached down and grabbed hold of a swatch of it and shoved it between her legs as her thrusts became more insistent.<br />
<br />
Unaware of how she was now humping her bed much like a randy dog would, Lisa also missed it as she wriggled out of her t-shirt. Full naked, she shifted in place so she kneeling with comforter between her legs, giving her an appearance as if she was straddling and riding it. Thrusting harder, faster, she wanted to howl, but resisting the urge, she again stuffed a fist in her mouth to stifle any noise. Leaning forward to grab with one hand the edge of the comforter after some time, she brought it up and rubbing it gently, lovingly, against her torso, she found it felt terrific when the soft material brushed against the more sensitive areas of her body.<br />
<br />
Unable to contain herself any longer, she dropped both hands to the bed. Her motions getting more and more insistent, Lisa started to first utter whimpers, then outright barks and howls of a horny male dog. Glad no one was home, she shifted her legs so she ended sitting like a dog who was squatting down, and oblivious to the way her vulva had sealed and was starting to balloon out as her clitoris and urethra melded together and shifted forward as a prepuce formed around the fledging penis. Baring her teeth in a grin which could almost be doggy, and also a way to show she was the dominant one at the moment, Lisa missed it as her canine dick slid from the sheath and fully erect, perfect to be knotted, she blew her first male load after a bit.<br />
<br />
Sated, she let her still human tongue hang out as she started to pant. Glancing down after some time, she stared at her red cock, the sheath it’d be housed in, her canine balls, and how all of it was already covered in a white fur. Seeing the viscous cum she’d blown all over her comforter, she suddenly became embarrassed by what she’d done, and with the utmost care, she rolled off the bed and wadded up the comforter. Dropping it to the floor, torn between leaving it where it was or eventually taking to the laundry room to wash, she peered down at the new addition to her body.<br />
<br />
Erect, still extended out of the sheath, she stared at the bulbed end for a bit before glancing down at the pair of testicles she now possessed. Curious to know if her cock would always remain the way it was, she walked across her bedroom. Needing to relieve herself, it didn’t even cross her mind she left her clothes as she exited, walked past the bathroom, through the house, making a quick detour in the kitchen, and out the backdoor. Padding across the yard, she dropped to all fours after a bit and lifted her leg. Not giving a any thought as to what she was doing, she finished, stood, turned and walked over the doghouse. Sitting down in front of it, she peered out at the backyard, thinking about how her stance and the way she walked had changed because of where her genitals were now located. Glancing down at her fur-covered sheath and balls, she wondered what would be the next part to change as she reached up to scratch at a spot on her neck.<br />
<br />
Fingers brushing against something hard which made a jingling noise when she tapped it, she was startled to realise she had on a dog collar. Wanting to know when it had appeared, she suddenly became aware of how she was outside, buck naked, and had just pissed in the grass like a dog. Standing, she rushed back toward the house. Fumbling first with the back door, then, after getting it open and racing to her room, the knob on the door to her bedroom, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief as she slammed the door shut and leaned against it.<br />
<br />
Glad she hadn’t been caught, she glanced first at the comforter, then at her clothes. Still not ready to throw the bed cover in the laundry, she picked up her shirt, pants, and underwear, considered putting them back on, and instead tossed them in the hamper in her closet. Taking from her dresser a clean pair of jeans and panties, she pulled on the underwear, and took a moment to adjust her canine package so it wasn’t pinched in an uncomfortable way and didn’t poke out. Disliking how it created a bulge, Lisa sighed, “Can’t be helped,” as she pulled on her pants.<br />
<br />
Only to be confronted by the issue of no matter what she tried, she was unable to pull them up over what she had out front and get the zipper and button done up without pinching her prepuce, crushing her testicles, or creating such a large bulge it was near impossible for her to walk properly, let alone sit down. Yanking them and the underwear off, she tossed them in the hamper and selected a dress with spaghetti shoulder straps, wrapped tight, but comfortably, around her torso, and came down to just shy of her knees. Resigning herself to the fact she’d have to wear dresses and skirts from now until the transformation had finished, Lisa dressed then sat down at the computer. Her posture very masculine, she peered at the screen, and received another start as she looked at the time counting down.<br />
<br />
At first she was certain it was wrong. But, after clicking on a few things, she soon learned what was counting down was the time it would take for her transformation into a male beagle to finish. Doing the maths in her head, she realised it’d take a month for the whole change to occur, and clicking more, she sighed when she discovered another time, waiting to become active, which was the amount of time she’d set for her to remain a male dog. Wondering if she made a mistake, as well as how she’d managed to set it up so, she barked out, “Screw it,” and standing, liking the way the soft fabric of her dress brushed against her canine sheath and balls, as well as how freeing it felt to go about without any underwear, she collected the comforter and headed for the laundry room. There, she tossed it in the washer, started the machine, and then, as if it was the most normal thing to do, lay down on the dog bed to wait for the load to finish so she could switch it over to the dryer, idly playing with the dog tags she now had on, which read Cooper, as well as other important information, all as she waited.</p>
