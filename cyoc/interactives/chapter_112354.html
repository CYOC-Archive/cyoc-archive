<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“That was totally unfair”, slurred Josh. It had been more than just a few beers for both of them and Henry had just beaten him again in the game. “You’ve got n-no chance when I’m sober again!”<br />
“I’ll beat you anytime! Just admit I’m be-urp” Henry covered his mouth and mumbled sorry. “Well anyway, I need a bathroom break”, he continued and struggled to his feet before letting himself fall down to the couch again. “Na, I forgot. No toilet.” Henry didn’t want to admit it, but he found urinating in the shower rather disgusting.<br />
“Where’s your problem with the fucking shower? Stop being such a baby already! You kno-know,” Josh answered, “Some year ago I even met a guy who got off to me pissing in his mouth so” he took another gulp from his can before burping loudly “so where’s your problem?”<br />
“Well, I’d rather pi- urinate into someone’s mouth than the shower I’ll have to clean again” Henry retorted agitatedly, much too drunk for logic anyway. “But that guy’s not here and someone thought it would be a good idea to let some plumbers take away our toilet for a whole week” He was almost shouting now. “Maybe I should piss into your mouth”<br />
“Well, if you feel better, than maybe yes, you should piss into my mouth!” Josh replied angrily. A sudden silence followed as each of the two roommates looked at each other. Josh didn’t know what came over him. He certainly didn’t want to drink anyone’s urine. Not that he found it too disgusting, but simply he was the one to piss on someone else, if needed. Then again, he wanted to get into Henry’s pants basically since he came out and perhaps, if he managed it right, this could lead to a blowjob afterwards… <br />
“I’m sorry” said Henry, deeply blushed and struggled to his feet again. “I shouldn’t have said that. I’ll just go and…”<br />
“No, it’s fine”, Josh jumped off the couch himself, handling the alcohol better than Henry. “I’m true to my word.” He grinned and went to the bathroom before Henry. “One human urinal, coming right up”, he laughed and got to his knees exactly where their toilet used to be.<br />
Henry couldn’t believe what he was doing, as he followed Josh to the bathroom. But the alcohol was fogging his mind and he still felt angry at Josh; maybe that would teach him not to be so short sighted.<br />
Josh grinned on the inside, as Henrys crotch came into view and he began to unbutton and unzip his jeans. With Henry being shy as he was, Josh had never even seen his dick. The bulge in his tighty-whiteys seemed promising at last, especially non-erect as he appeared to be. Josh could feel himself getting hard. “Well, you asked for it, now open up!” He heard Henry say, as he flopped out his moderately sized dick. Josh opened his mouth widely, and, really, he saw Henry aim and let go. <br />
The first drop of the yellow liquid touching his tongue was tasting rather acridly to Josh, almost wanting him to close his mouth right there, but he forced himself to endure it. He registered that Henry, even drunk as he was, was trying to hold back in order not to spill anything. Aiming at a human mouth was harder than you’d think, Josh knew, but then again, he didn’t care back then. Josh tried to open wider and lean in a bit, as the trickle became a stream of yellow, beer-tasting urine and Josh was busy gulping it down fast enough not to spill. <br />
It was a relief indeed for Henry, as he emptied his bladder into his buddy. Josh must indeed have been true to his word, as he opened his mouth so wide, not a drop hitting anything but his tongue. In fact, Henry didn’t even know Josh could open that wide. Finally, as he was finished, he was a bit surprised. He knew Josh was trying to make him a conquest of his and his erection was painfully visible as he was kneeling on the ground, so Henry half expected Josh to make a move right there. However, he did not. He just continued to kneel there with his mouth open, looking directly at Henrys crotch. Suddenly, it all didn’t seem like such a good idea anymore. He quickly zipped up and took a step back from Josh. “Uh, thanks… I guess?” He was blushing deeply again and faked a yawn. “You know, I’m really tired. I’m um, gonna go to bed. Good night.” As he quickly left the bathroom without looking back, his face a deep crimson. <br />
As he was lying in bed he noticed that his tiredness wasn’t even fake, as he was quickly drifting off. Absentmindly, he scratched his chest. It felt like stubble, but that couldn’t be true of course – Henry never had any body hair besides a few pubes.</p>
