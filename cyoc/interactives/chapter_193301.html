<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler jumped when he heard the front door slam; his father must be home. After playing a round down at the disc golf course, he had come home to lol around the internet for several hours. He’d been voyeuristically reading large-dick forums, stroking his straining hard cocklet to the tales of awkward bulges, compression underwear, and comparisons of length and girth. It was hot for him to read, but it made him a little envious of men like them. He wished he had their confidence, their dominance. Tyler still couldn’t believe he had so willingly fell to his knees and blown his uncle’s gardener. The man barely had to crook his finger, Tyler had been so eager. It was more than just feeding from him; Tyler loved the act of submission, of being taken and used by such a bigger, stronger man. He didn’t know if it was the small-dick hormones, or if he would have turned out feeling such a way regardless, but Tyler knew that by the end of the transition he would be fully gay. He hadn’t thought of a woman once since the day he noticed his dick was growing smaller, and worshiping Colby’s cock these last few days had pushed the idea fully out of the small-dick’s mind. Every man he saw on the streets, in the convenience stores, on the TV playing sports, his eyes were irresistibly drawn to the man’s crotch, mentally taking note of its length and girth. His pathetic cocklet strained against his pants as he imagined what those men must taste like, how he wish he could bow down and satisfy every one of them…<br />
<br />
He was pulled from his reverie when his door opened, his father stepping into the room.<br />
<br />
“Hey, bud,” he said. “I grabbed to-go from that sandwich place we like. It’s in the kitchen.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Dad,” Tyler said in response, his face still feeling a little flush. He noticed his dad had changed into a pair sweat pants.<br />
<br />
His father gave him a weird nod and backed out of the room, not closing the door behind him. Tyler was feeling a little bit better after talking to his uncle today. He figured now was as good a time as ever. Tyler stood up from his chair, pausing for a moment to adjust his erect cocklet in his shorts. He wasn’t wearing any underwear; his minute, two-inch cock jutted straight out from his body bud barely made a ruffle against his baggy shorts. He had already ordered a falsie online; he hoped it arrived soon so that his almost empty crotch wouldn’t be so obvious.<br />
<br />
Tyler padded out of the room and went to the kitchen, where he found his father seated at the table devouring a sub. He was seated with his legs spread wide, letting his long, soft cock run down the leg of his pants and creating a nice, appealing bulge on the big man. His sandwich forgotten, Tyler blushed when he heard his stomach growl in hunger.<br />
<br />
“You must be starving son,” his dad chuckled, wiping his mouth with a paper napkin. “Dig in, before it gets cold.”<br />
<br />
Tyler reached for the paper-wrapped bundle that was his sandwich. Chicken, ranch, and garlic; it was his favorite. Tyler took a deep whiff. It smelled heavenly, but it did nothing to slake or entice his hunger. He put the sandwich down and took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
“Dad, I’m sorry, but I can’t eat this,” He began, taking another deep breath. “I…I’m a small-dick.” He finally admitted, not wanted to meet his father’s eyes but too afraid to look anywhere else.<br />
<br />
His father merely regarded him for a moment, an unreadable expression on his face, before he said, “I’m just happy to hear you say it, boy,”. He smiled at him.<br />
<br />
“Really?” Tyler was surprised.<br />
<br />
“Sure, we always knew you’d be a small-dick.” His father admitted with a sigh. “Maybe it’s my large-dick instincts, but I always knew.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry,” Tyler felt ashamed, which only made his cocklet hard. “I didn’t expect it; I really wanted to be a large-dick like Colby, and you, Dad.”<br />
<br />
“Its okay, son.” His father gave him an empathetic smile. “Not everyone can be blessed to carry meat like this.” He laughed, gripping his growing bulge through his sweatpants. “You’re lucky to have a man like Colby. He was always a good kid, a good friend to you. I always kind of hoped he’d help you get through this.”<br />
<br />
“He has, he’s helped a lot,” Tyler admitted. “Except I’m…starving,” he muttered, feeling weird about saying this to his father. “And he doesn’t get off work until midnight.”<br />
<br />
His father frowned. “When was the last time that you…ate?” he said, also clearly looking awkward. <br />
<br />
“Um, this morning,” Tyler confessed, looking away.<br />
<br />
His father shook his head. “You gotta eat more often than that, boy,” he practically growled. “You’re still growing, even if you’re little nub isn’t.” He joked. “I’ll try to be nice, son. But you know us large-dicks, its hard for us to hold back when we’re around someone who’s so small.” He said, his tone sheepish. “How small have you gotten?” he asked, not being able to help himself. <br />
<br />
“Um, two inches, last time I measured.” Tyler said, feeling embarrassed but also thrilled to be telling his father this information.<br />
<br />
The big man groaned and closed his eyes. “Damn. You’ve hardly got anything left, son. How can you even call that a cock?” He asked. Tyler sighed as wave of pleasure emanated from his leaking cocklet. “Look at you,” he chuckled. “My handsome, manly son, slowly becoming a needy, pathetically-hung fag.” He shook his head. “I think I can still be proud of you son, so long as you understand your new place in the family.” He was stroking the hard length running down his pant leg, Tyler’s eyes following each motion. “Now, before I finish my dinner, I think its time I feed you yours,” he said, before opening up his sweatpants and hefting out his hard cock.<br />
<br />
Tyler gasped at the sight of his father’s erect cock. It was over fifteen inches long, but thick, thicker than Tyler expected. His balls were large and round, the size of lemons, bulging in his sack as the tight waist of his father’s sweatpants made them bulge out from the base of that magnificent looking cock. His father was circumcised; he didn’t know this about him, but it did nothing to diminish the sight. The read, angry head was only more conspicuous, and more accessible, Tyler thought, licking his lips.<br />
<br />
“This is the only way you’ll know what a real man’s cock feels like.” His father said, a statement of fact rather than a matter of opinion. “I want a good life for you, boy, but you have to learn to accept your place as a submissive, small-dicked beta.” He said, his deep voice hypnotic.<br />
<br />
“Yes, dad,” Tyler said, not taking his eyes of his father’s erect cock.<br />
<br />
“Yes, ‘sir’,” he corrected, “Or Daddy. If you were a real man, you could call me dad, or father. But you aren’t a real man, having such a tiny cock like yours, are you?” he asked, his eyes expectant.<br />
<br />
“No, sir,” Tyler said hastily. <br />
<br />
His father nodded. “Good boy. Now stand up and show your Daddy your pathetic, shrinking cock.”<br />
<br />
Tyler gulped and stood up, hooking his thumbs around the waist of his shorts before pulling them down and letting them drop to the floor. He crossed his arms, nervously looking down at his pathetic, almost clit-sized dick and pea sized balls. Was it him, or did his pubic hair look a bit sparser as well. He heard his father chuckle.<br />
<br />
“Damn, son,” he said. “The apple fell pretty far from the tree. I haven’t seen a cock that small since college. I think that little nipple between your legs is smaller than your uncles!” He guffawed, stroking his cock slowly and laughing. But Tyler couldn’t hold it in any longer; he moaned as his knees felt week, his tiny cocklet throbbing and spurting out a few short jets of cum on the kitchen floor at his father’s feet. Tyler gripped the table as he sat down, his hand-free orgasm hitting him hard. It gets more intense every time, Tyler thought, no wonder these large-dicks have small-dicks like me hanging from their little fingers. <br />
<br />
“Now you’ve gone and made a mess, boy!” his father said in a stern tone, a smile still tugging at the corner of his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Do you…want me to clean it up? Sir?” he added, his voice shaky.<br />
<br />
“No, boy. I’ll clean up that sneeze you call cum off the floor, while you make it up to Daddy a different way.”<br />
<br />
Tyler gulped, feeling like he knew what his dad was about to ask for. “What do you want me to do, Daddy?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“I want you to suck off one of the nieghbors,” he said with a grin. “You’re not worthy of your daddy’s cum; I don’t feed family. So, you’re gonna need some feeders in the neighborhood for when your friend Colby is working late nights.”<br />
<br />
“Sir, I’d rather not—” Tyler began but his father cut him off.<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t asking, boy. Now get that tight ass out there, small-dick. Don’t come back until you find at least one man on this street who will let you suck him…or whatever he wants to do with you.” He smiled at Tyler. “I’m happy to offer my little-dick sub of a son to any real man who wants to enjoy him.”<br />
<br />
Tyler protested, but the force of his large-dicked father’s words were already driving him back out of his chair. He looked behind him to see his father tucking his hard schlong back into his sweatpants. “Have fun, Tyler. Don’t stay out too late!” He taunted before resuming eating his sandwich. Tyler only sighed as he opened the door and shut it behind him. It wasn’t until that very moment that he realized he hadn’t even bothered to put his shorts back on! But he couldn’t ignore the large-dick’s command by going back for them. He looked down at his still hard micropenis, biting his lip before resigning himself to his fate. His stomach growled; he was hungry anyway. Might as well do as his father told him and find a man on his block to fill him up. <br />
<br />
Tyler padded across the lawn and down the sidewalk, looking around the quiet neighborhood. It was almost dark; most people were home and eating dinner by now. Or out and about the town. He noticed one house in particular; the garage door was open and the light was on. An old car sat out on the driveway in a state of dissasmbly; it wasn’t a muscle car. It looked more like an old cult-classics, like a Pacer or something. I heard a garage door slam before a men cam striding out of the garage, wiping his hands on a shop towel. He was a tall, portly man, wearing a pair of jeans and a hoodie. Tyler hadn’t met the man before, he couldn’t recall his name, but he’d seen him out working on his yard once or twice before. The man stopped behind the car and stretched, his shirt lifting to reveal a heavy, hairy belly, and Tyler could spy the outline of the man’s thick cock in the faded blue denim. <br />
<br />
The man walked around to the front of the car and started messing around under the hood, his back turned to the street. Tyler looked both ways down the street from his dark patch on the law; no one else was stirring, no other cars had come. Now was his moment. He quickly walked across the street, wincing at the rough asphault under his bare feet. The man was still focused on his work and hadn’t turn around yet. Tyler stopped when he’d come within a few feet and cleared his throat.<br />
<br />
“Um, excuse me,” he said, glad his small-dick submissiveness was compelling him somewhat, because otherwise he wouldn’t have known what to say. <br />
<br />
The man jumped a bit and turned around, an annoyed expression on his face. “Look, if you’re with the H.O.H.,” he began with a snarl, but he stopped when he say Tyler, standing in the street in nothing but a t-shirt, his tiny cocklet exposed to the world. “Holy shit,” the man said, his wrench falling from his hand and clattering to the ground.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Would you be willing to let me suck you off?” Tyler said, just getting straight into it. “My Daddy says I can’t come home until I suck off one of my nieghbors.”<br />
<br />
“Wow, did I just die and go to heaven?” the man guffawed, squatting down to get a closer look at Tyler. “I’ve never seen one of you in real life before. God damn, that thing is small. How do you even call that a cock?”<br />
<br />
Tyler moaned as his stomach clenched in painful hunger. “Please, I haven’t had a load in a while. Will you please let me suck your cock?”<br />
<br />
The man smiled. “Well, small-dick, since you asked so nicely.” He chuckled. “But lets take you inside. I’d hate to have to share you,” He said, looking around as he stepped forward to put a firm hand behind Tyler’s back and usher the young man inside the house. Tyler started when he felt the man’s big hand slip down to squeeze his full ass. He was guided into a kitchen, which spilled into an open living room. Tyler got the impression that the man was single or divorced; the room was a spartan affair with little in the way of décor beyond a couch, a table, a TV, and a knick-knack or two. <br />
<br />
“Make yourself at home, small-dick. My name is Scott,” the man boomed as he opened the fridge. Tyler took a seat at one of the bar stools at the kitchen counter. “I seen you a few times since I moved in, but I never thought I was lucky enough to have a small-dick on my block!” He chuckled, turning around with a beer in his hand. Scott came around the counter and sat down on the other bar stool, taking a deep swig of his beer while staring at Tyler’s bare crotch. “What is that, like three inches?” He chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Two,” Tyler corrected him, shuddering.<br />
<br />
Scott just laughed. “That’s hilarious. You know, I’m not that big myself,” Scott confessed. “I mean, I’m not a small-dick like you; I’m a real man,” he gripped the growing tube in his pants to emphasize, “It ain’t long, but its nice and thick, and I got big balls that I haven’t had a chance to drain in a while. You want some?” he asked, looking into Tyler’s eyes and wagging his eyebrows.<br />
<br />
Tyler sputtered out, “Yes, please, sir!” as he got off the chair and down to his knees. <br />
<br />
“Then unzip me, little-dick,” Scott commanded, “You want it, you can do the work.”<br />
<br />
Tyler reached forward, his fingers digging underneath Scott’s hairy belly to find the heavy buckle of his belt. He undid the belt and the button and tugged the zipper of his fly down. His cocklet throbbed when he saw Scott was going commando, the opened fly revealing a thick patch of dark pubic hair and the thick base of the man’s thick cock. <br />
<br />
“Careful, small-dick.” Scott winced when the zipper crazed the skin of his shaft. “This is a real man’s cock, not some useless pimple like yours.”<br />
<br />
Tyler shuddered as he took hold of the warm, semi-hard shaft and gently reeled Scott’s cock out of his pants. The man shifted so that Tyler could pull his pants down a little further, letting a fat, thirteen-inch cock and a bulbous pair of palls spring free of their denim prison. Scott was right, Tyler admitted: it wasn’t that long, but it was very thick. Girthier than Colby’s cock, perhaps even as thick around as it was long. <br />
<br />
“I know he looks like a mouthful,” he chuckled as his hand joined Tyler’s on the shaft of his cock. “But you can handle him, right small-dick?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, sir,” Tyler said. Of course he could, he was a small-dick after all, hiss body was made for men like Scott. He dipped his head down and took the flared, purple head of Scott’s cock into his mouth. His throat immediately dilated to accept the man’s girth, and Tyler hummed in pleasure as he felt the thing glide down his throat with ease.<br />
<br />
“Damn, boy,” Scott growled, as the force of Tyler’s sucking pulled him a few inches off his chair. Tyler only moaned in response as he began to work himself up and down the man’s shaft. He sort of liked that Scott wasn’t as long as the other men he’d sucked; from this angle, Tyler was able to fully thrust himself up and down Scott’s girthy cock without putting his neck or back at a weird angle. Scott gripped the table and closed his eyes as Tyler began using his tongue to massage the underside of Scott’s cock. He pulled Scott out of his throat, gave the head of the cock and admiring look before attacking it with his tongue, his lips, making love to it with his mouth. Scott grunted and huffed, one of his big hands snaking under his shirt to play with his nipples as Tyler devoted his attention to the man’s cockhead. Every delicious drop of precum Tyler could taste from it only encouraged him to work harder. He dove down on the cock again, taking the man up to the base before he began to face-fuck himself against Scott’s cock with gusto. True to his word Scott did nothing but try to hold onto the chair as he weathered Tyler’s ministrations. He tried to hold himself in, to make this small-dick slobber over him for hours until the little chode begged him for his cum, but he couldn’t handle it any longer. Tyler was too eager. His orgasm hit him and he let out a deep, guttural groan as his balls emptied a torrent of cum down his pulsing shaft and into Tyler’s waiting stomach. Tyler gratefully received the large-dicks load, stroking his own cocklet until his tiny balls burst as well, his orgasm leaving another stain on another kitchen floor. Scott held Tyler’s head in place as the small-dick sucked every lost drop he could from the man.<br />
<br />
“God damn, boy.” Scott huffed, after a moment, “Tell your Daddy his boy is one hell of a cocksucker. I haven’t been drained like that in years.”<br />
<br />
Tyler felt some pride at that, leaning back while still on his knees and caressing his full, slightly bulging stomach. He was full, he realized as he burped; he felt almost a little bloated, like he’d eaten a full course meal. “Thank you. That really hit the spot; I’m super full.”<br />
<br />
Scott grinned. “I told you. I come from a long ling of big-balled men!” he said with a smile, rubbing the balls in question. “And there’s plenty more where that came from, boy. Whenever you’re hungry.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, but I should probably get going,” Tyler said.<br />
<br />
“Not so fast, shortie,” Scott frowned and stood up. “Before you leave, this large-dick has another order for you, which you have to follow, correct?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Tyler said, already feeling his mind settle into a more receptive and submissive role.<br />
<br />
He smiled. “Good. Now, I have a favor to ask of you,” he began.</p>
