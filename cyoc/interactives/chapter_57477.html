<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gillie could only sigh as Serenity and Mother Glen chatted away. She didn't like all the changes that were going on in her life, and the lives of so many. The whole thing had started with a call to the police from a man that had a reputation of being somewhat nosy. The call was about large animals inside the home of the Perkins family. He (Gill) had sent Frank and Daryl to investigate, only to have them return, say it was dogs mating, and then resign. He had suspected the game's presence but couldn't do much, and he was unable to prevent Frank and Daryl from becoming Fran and Darla.<br />
<br />
What confirmed his suspicion was Julie's later visit to the station believing that the FBI had recruited Frank for something. The Game had to be at work, but there were no clues as to where Frank and Daryl were at the time. He (Gill) sent Julie to Madame Serenity, knowing that Serenity had the freedom to work outside the lines that Glendale's police had to follow. Gill then set about the waiting game to see if his hunch was wrong and Daryl came back for his motorcycle, which he had abandoned at the station when he and Frank quit. Daryl never did come back.<br />
<br />
The next he (Gill) had heard about this case was Serenity's call. In it, Gill learned how bad things were getting. Serenity had found a victim of the game and her family was prepared to do something foolish, and they turned out to be the Hardys, who later showed up in his office, covered in fur and looking very much like lions. It was there that Gill learned just how big of a mess Jennifer Smith (Jensen) and Kyle Perkins (Kaylee) had made. And the mess didn't get any smaller. Brian and Felicity Hardy stole the humanity of twelve of his officers, some of whom apparently didn't WANT to go back to their past forms. Gill tolerated it as it looked like a war was coming against the Smiths and to stop Jennifer (Jensen)'s use of the Game.<br />
<br />
What followed ended up being the war with Kurse. The white and red pup, Amy, as Gill would eventually learn, freed Jennifer (Jensen) from the Curse's grasp, and he and Kyle (Kaylee) came and both surrendered and apologized. Gill was ready to lock them BOTH up and throw away the key, but Serenity could feel what the Curse was doing after being beaten by Amy. Jennifer and Kyle's (Jensen and Kaylee's) wolves would be needed to stop Kurse.<br />
<br />
In the end that battle was won and Kurse was defeated, but after the foolish use of the Game by Jennifer and Kyle (Jensen and Kaylee) and the Hardys, reality itself began to heal. As a result, the connections to the game with Jennifer, Kyle, and the Hardys all vanished. As far as reality was concerned, they had never played the game. Jennifer had always been Jensen. Kyle had always been Kaylee. Frank and Daryl had always been Fran and Darla and were apparently sisters with Julie. The Hardys had always been lions, and so had twelve of his officers.<br />
<br />
And then came the two big kickers for &quot;Gill&quot;. Penny used her ability to free those trapped by the Game to free Gill's grandfather from being a teapot, and as a result, Gill became Gillie for reasons that Gillie could only guess at. Then came Serenity's call that while the Game was soon to die... the powers that the Lupman and Leoman who had played the game would not. And as such, as Gillie listened she watched more people become Leomen through their kind's &quot;true love&quot; powers. But Gillie couldn't change that, so trying to fight it would be pointless.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you think of the house?&quot; Gillie asked as she tried to put her mind as far away from Serenity's conversation with Mother Glen.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks nice,&quot; Gillian told her, &quot;and large enough home for the both of us. It is a little far from the nursing home that Marilyn runs, but she said she doesn't mind the exercise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Gillie nodded, &quot;Let me know if you'll need any help with furniture.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't want to be a bother on you, dear,&quot; Gillian commented, &quot;It is wonderful to see you and have you as my granddaughter. But you grew up while I was a tea pot. It would be uncivilized of me to make you relive your childhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie slowly nodded, &quot;All the same, I suppose it would be uncivilized for me not to offer to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillian nodded. He was about to say something more when Serenity and Mother Glen's conversation came to an end.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Glen,&quot; Serenity said politely, &quot;and as much as I would like to talk more, there is a lot of work left to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, dear,&quot; Mother Glen spoke and then gave a weak chuckle, &quot;but to correct you, Ms. Glen would be Penny, my other granddaughter. The Pride refers to me as Mother Glen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds very saintly,&quot; Serenity commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It has been a sort of tradition among Leoman matriarchs in the Glendale Pride.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity nodded, &quot;it was a pleasure meeting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mother Glen nodded, &quot;thank you again for protecting Trevor. Jacob and Marie must be overjoyed to have him back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are,&quot; Serenity nodded, &quot;but as I said I must get back to my own work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mother Glen nodded as Serenity turned to Gillie standing beside her grandfather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for the numbers, Gillie,&quot; Serenity spoke, &quot;I'm sure they'll be helpful, but ultimately we'll need to go together to make the formal suggestion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Suggestion? For what?&quot; Gillie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To kill the game,&quot; Serenity answered, &quot;I'm not on the city's or your payroll. I can make the suggestion, but if they don't believe it, they'll ignore it completely. If they do believe it, they'll still follow protocol, which means you'll be involved eventually. Better for us to do it together. It'll save time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Gillie said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure that now is not the best time to go into the details of the suggestion,&quot; Serenity spoke, &quot;I can meet with you tomorrow morning...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Serenity,&quot; Gillie said quietly, &quot;The whole town will be glad to see the Game  go. If you need me there... we can meet at City Hall around ten in the morning. You can present your suggestion and tell them that you've cleared it with me. I will agree with the idea. So long as you're sure it will work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure,&quot; Serenity spoke, &quot;Father Michael and Father Paul are working to insure that enough of the cure is ready to kill the game forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took a few steps and then turned back to Gillie.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Gillie, you know I can help you with just about ANY problem you have.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
The Wyes and Waynes stayed with the Glens giving their thanks to Penny before eventually heading out for their own homes. Umeko, Penny, and Kirk ended watching them depart, saying sweet nothings to each other and commenting about how much they loved that it was a nice day.<br />
<br />
&quot;They must really love each other,&quot; Kirk commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;They always have,&quot; Penny commented, &quot;very much so. I think they bored out the minister telling each other how much they loved the other at their respective weddings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't that be done at the reception in Christian weddings?&quot; Umeko asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Christian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The ceremony in which I and my sister wives took Yamato as our husband was a mixed Buddhist and Shinto ceremony,&quot; Umeko answered, &quot;It was beautiful... although Eri, Akane, and I had to convince Chiyoye to go through with the ceremony...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She didn't want to marry Yamato?&quot; Penny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she wanted to marry him very much,&quot; Umeko explained, &quot;she didn't want to have the ceremony...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean elope?&quot; Kirk asked. Umeko nodded in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the priests that performed the ceremony for us still live in the area, if you wish, I could ask if he would perform one for you,&quot; Umeko offered, &quot;You could have it in a garden with bright flower blossoms floating on a soft breeze...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our parents would prefer a more Christian setting,&quot; Penny told her, &quot;but thank you for the idea... anyway, I'd prefer to keep the wedding plans saved until I can walk again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But weddings take time to plan,&quot; Kirk commented, &quot;and you know our folks will probably never let up when it comes to asking us about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Penny commented as she leaned over to rub her head to Kirk's side, &quot;but I'd like to be able to just enjoy having you back, to enjoy the fact that the Game and all its ills will soon be gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
They all nodded, even Umeko. While there was some desire to be of service to her Alpha, and to escape the weight that her back carried, Umeko had no great love of the game Transform or Dare. And she would not mind to see it go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, here,&quot; Umeko said to that, &quot;Is there anything you would like for me to do, for you, Mistress?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think I need anything,&quot; Penny commented, &quot;Although, Kirk may get the &quot;talk&quot; eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The talk?&quot; Kirk asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The &quot;don't hurt my baby&quot; talk,&quot; Penny commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he gave that speech when we first started dating,&quot; Kirk commented.<br />
<br />
Umeko paid enough attention as Penny proceeded to joke a little bit with Kirk to know whether or not Penny wanted her to do something or not. But, otherwise, Umeko watched out toward the setting sun. And with its golden rays sinking toward the horizon, Umeko couldn't help but feel at peace.</p>
