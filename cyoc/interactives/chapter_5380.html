<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Five minutes after Jane closed her apartment door on Cameron and Ted, she heard a ruckus from the hallway.  It sounded like Cameron, but she had had never heard him so loud or forceful before.  &quot;Please leave - NOW.&quot;  Then she heard Ted, it sounded like he was crying.<br />
<br />
Wondering what in hell was going on, Jane opened her door and peered into the hallway.  There was Ted running down the hallway to the stairs.  The door to Cameron's apartment was ajar, and she heard a crash, then quiet.  Her heart pounding, Jane went to the doorway, listening for a moment.  She heard a sob, it was Cameron.  Something had gone wrong, and Jane had a feeling whatever had happened was her fault, because of the wish she made. She knocked lightly on the door.  &quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
No Answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cameron?  Is everything ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a minute please.&quot;  It was Cameron, but his voice sounded shaky.  A moment later he came to the door.  His eyes were red from crying, but he had done his best to dry them and appear like all was normal, putting up a brave front for Jane.  &quot;Hi Jane, is there somethign I can do for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I heard some noise out here and wanted to be sure everything was ok...?&quot;  Jane was starting to wish she had never made her last wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, everything's fine,&quot; Cameron said bravely.  &quot;I'm sorry about the noise, Ted was just... well, you know Ted.  I just...&quot;  Cameron looked like he was about to cry.  He rubbed his eyes, and said with a sob, &quot;I'm sorry, allergies.  Anyway, I'm sorry about the noise, it won't happen again -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cameron,&quot; Jane said firmly and with concern, &quot;What happened?  May I come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... the place is a bit of a mess now... coffee table kind of... broke all over the place...&quot; Cameron sobbed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Cameron,&quot; Jane said, taking his hand gently, &quot;Let's talk in my apartment for a few minutes, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cameron smiled gratefully through his tears at her.  &quot;Thank you, Jane.  You've always been so sweet to me, I really appreciate it... and I'm sorry I've been so much trouble tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonesense,&quot; Jane responded.  &quot;You're no trouble at all.&quot;  She led him into her apartment and sat down with him on the couch.  &quot;Now, why don't you tell me what happened, ok hon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... After you went into your apartment, Ted followed me in.  He was acting so stange, I thought he was having some kind of mental breakdown after the way he started treating me so nicely.  And when he wanted to follow me into my appartment... I didn't know what to do.  I'm not very good with confrontations, but I didn't really want him coming in.  The next thing I know he's kissing me all over and has his hands all over me - I was in total shock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see where you would be,&quot; Jane agreed.  &quot;Go on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then he gets down on his knees in front of me and starts begging me to... well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok, Cameron,&quot; Jane prompted.  &quot;You can say it, I'm a big girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Pleasure him,&quot; Cameron finished.  &quot;But I just started seeing a guy, and I'm not the kind of guy that fools around - one man is enough for me.  I didn't want to do anything with Ted... besides, he wanted me to 'top' him, if you know what I mean...&quot; Jane shook her head, and Cameron continued, &quot;and I'm a bottom, and quite happy being a bottom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Boy did I screw up, Jane thought to herself.  I never thought of that.<br />
<br />
Cameron took a deep sigh, trying not to shake.  &quot;He managed to get my pants down before I could really protest - I was just in so much shock I couldn't believe what he was doing... Then when he... well, when he took it out I was shocked by something else... at that point, I pulled my pants back up and told him he had to leave.  He started crying and begging to stay.&quot;  Cameron sniffled.  &quot;By then I was crying too, but he left as I told him to - I just had to get firm... and I absolutely hate confrontations...&quot; Cameron was crying again, and started shaking more.  &quot;I kind of lost it after he left, and broke some things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jane put her arm around Cameron to comfort him.  &quot;Hey, it's ok.  I'm sure it's nothing that can't be cleaned up and fixed.  I've run across my share of creeps too, and I know how you feel right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just... why do most men have to be such creeps?  All I want is to find a good man who will love me for what I am, someone I can make a home with... it seems like everyone wants to sleep around, as if the idea of monogamy is passe and there's no value to it.&quot;  Cameron wiped his tears away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Jane chimed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand... what's so horrible about finding one person to love and to build a real relationship with?  What are guys so scared of?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jane sighed.  &quot;I don't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand men.&quot;  Cameron laughed.  &quot;And yet I am one myself.  Well, Ted might take exception to that - on any other night but tonight!&quot; Cameron laughed, Jane with him.  Cameron continued.  &quot;Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian. I mean, I can talk to you, I can talk to other women.  It feels safe and comfortable, you know?  And if I was a woman, then there wouldn't be all the baggage that some women carry against males.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jane replied with a guilty sigh.  &quot;But then if you were attracted to women, you would probably have trouble relating to them... it seems to be the way things work with attraction a lot of the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
This time it was Cameron's turn to sigh.  &quot;You're probably right.  And when I think about it, my lesbian friends have their problems too.&quot;  He started crying again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jane asked sympathetically.<br />
<br />
&quot;My... well...&quot;  Cameron gestured to the bulge in his pants, &quot;I'm BIG!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jane laughed.  &quot;And that's a problem?  Most guys don't see it that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't understand,&quot; Cameron continued.  &quot;I wasn't this big this morning in the shower.  I don't know if I have some kind of infection and it's swollen up or what... it feels normal, except BIG.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't worry about it,&quot; Jane reassured him.  &quot;It's probably a growth spurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... I was HALF the size this morning... that's a lot of growth in one day...&quot; Cameron sniffled.  &quot;Besides, I guess I kind of liked being on the small side... to be honest, I had fantasies of being smaller...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really??&quot; Jane had never dreamed of a guy wishing to be smaller.  &quot;How big are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cameron turned red with embarrassment.  &quot;I didn't measure it, but probably around 11 inches.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow, thought Jane, porn stars are really hung!  &quot;But why would you want to be smaller?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I guess it made me feel more feminine. I mean, I like being a guy, but I guess I like being... a petite guy.  I know I'm not much to look at...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonesense,&quot; Jane asserted.  &quot;You look fine, you're an attractive enough guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don't feel like it very much,&quot; Cameron said.  &quot;Especially now... It's just so BIG...  I hate it... I wish I was one sixth the size!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jane thought a moment.  &quot;That would put you under two inces!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cameron sighed.  &quot;I know.  It sounds silly, but I really really would like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow I couldn't have screwed up more, thought Jane.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't even know why I'm telling you all this,&quot; Cameron said.  &quot;I never talk like this to people, except close friends... I mean, we don't even really know each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok,&quot; Jane said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it isn't, I must be coming off as a whining basket case right now, and I'm really sorry.&quot;  Cameron got up.<br />
<br />
Jane stood.  &quot;I don't mind, Cameron, really.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cameron wiped his tears away.  &quot;Thank you, you really didn't need to do any of this.  And I'm sorry for being such a basket case.  I really need to get back and clean up the mess I made.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looks like I have a mess of my own to clean up, thought Jane, but she only said, &quot;Why don't I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, really, but thank you,&quot; Cameron said, making his way to the door.  &quot;I'm sorry again for dumping on you like this and for the noise earlier...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Cameron, it's ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Jane, I hope you have a good evening.&quot;  Cameron made his exit closing the door quietly behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Jane to herself, &quot;Those wishes backfired.  Now what should I do to fix this mess?&quot;</p>
