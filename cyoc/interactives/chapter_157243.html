<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony paced up and down the waiting room, his hooves clicking loudly as he did. He snorted, tossing his head. His ears were entirely equine, at this point, and his face was just a bit longer, with a broader nose and flared nostrils - he looked like a human in horse makeup, but it was his real face under that horsehide. The estimates had been slightly off, but within the margin of error - he&#39;d finished out only 6&#39;6.5&quot;, not counting the tips of his ears, but his penis had reached an even 20&quot;. His thighs were shaped a bit differently now, too, thicker and better built for propelling him forward on hooves rather than feet. And hooves they were; they&#39;d been particularly tender at first, but now they just felt like his feet, and he exulted in the added horse element to his life.<br />
<br />
They continued to click loudly as he paced. Actually, they were pretty tender now, too, but that was also enjoyable. He&#39;d been woken that morning to his brother coming in with Dr. Kenworth, smiling. Kenworth blabbered on, mostly to Max, about Tony&#39;s stats and progress, but Tony was too distracted by the grooming kit that Max had brought with him, the one he&#39;d immediately begun using on Tony. Tony had wickered with glee, but Max had just clicked his tongue.<br />
&quot;Easy there, pony.&quot;<br />
Kenworth had gone on for a bit, but the highlight for Tony - and the reason his hooves were still tender - was when he was winding up, and Max leaned in and whispered in Tony&#39;s ear.<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been very well behaved, Tony, so it&#39;s time for some positive reinforcement. Which, Ironically, Dr. Kenworth here is not going to recognize as such, but you and I both know the truth.&quot;<br />
Tony glanced at his brother, eyes slightly wide. What on earth was Max planning?<br />
<br />
Max turned to Kenworth, that same small, confident smile.<br />
&quot;Doctor, you have a farrier on staff, yes?&quot;<br />
Tony&#39;s eyes shot wide, and he felt his tail reflexively swishing rapidly; the fact that he could no longer fully control how his body displayed emotions only heightened his pleasure, and he could barely contain the urge to jump for joy. Kenworth looked momentarily nonplussed.<br />
&quot;Well, ah, yes, of course. I hadn&#39;t thought you&#39;d want him in horseshoes, though, what with your...particular training style?&quot;<br />
&quot;In this, as in all things, dear doctor, context is king. I would like to shoe Tony myself, please, with your farrier attending in case of issues. While Tony would be my first ponyboy I&#39;ve shod, I&#39;ve done several horses at this point, particularly in 4H when I was younger.&quot;<br />
Kenworth finally seemed to intuit, from that statement and from Tony&#39;s clear if silent glee, that this was somehow a reward. He shrugged, considering that both of these clients - the pony AND his master, frankly - were a bit mad. Everyone knew that shoeing ponyboys was almost universally reserved either for penal ponies, who were all shod, or volunteer ponies who had misbehaved so much their owners had been forced to strip more of their humanity away. But, who was he to tell this strange young man and his stranger pony brother how to spend their money?<br />
<br />
An hour and a half later, and Tony was in the waiting room, pacing. His new horseshoes had been easy to affix, since his hooves - fresh, as it were, from the manufacturer - didn&#39;t need to be cleaned. Max gave him a choice between glued on shoes or traditional nails. Tony hadn&#39;t even bothered answering; he&#39;d merely stared at his brother, neighed as realistically as possible, and then grinned. It had indeed been highly realistic - Kenworth had noted to Max with interest that Tony was considerably more horse-like than his programming actually should cause. Max had laughed.<br />
&quot;Well of course. He wants to be as much of a horse as possible, so he supplies himself what your training left out. You could have skipped the horse behavior training altogether, and he&#39;d still be neighing and wickering. That&#39;s why I&#39;m having him shod, even though honestly most of my racers won&#39;t be. He&#39;s my brother, and I love him, so if he wants to go as deep into being a pony as he can safely, then it&#39;s my job, as his brother and his master, to help him do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
So there they both were, in the waiting room. Max was lounging on a sofa, going over some applications for potential ranch hands. Tony still paced, growing more agitated by the moment.<br />
&quot;You know, you could injure yourself like that, maybe I should send you to be housed in one of the clinic&#39;s stalls until we&#39;re ready to go. For your own safety, you know?&quot; Max said mildly.<br />
Tony sighed, snorted.<br />
&quot;I know, I know, I&#39;m just anxious.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re halfway between a human, which is essentially a chimp with highly developed neuroses, and a horse, an animal known to be made of 90% pure anxiety. Of course you&#39;re anxious. Doesn&#39;t make it rational. You can sit down, you know; they&#39;ll bring him out to us when he&#39;s ready,&quot; Max added without taking his eyes off the page.<br />
Tony groaned, leaning his hefty weight against the far wall.<br />
&quot;I just...I want to see him so bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max chuckles, he can&#39;t help himself. Tony pouts, crossing his arms.<br />
&quot;Oh, come on, Max, don&#39;t laugh at me...&quot;<br />
Max drops his paperwork, finally, smiling indulgently at his sulking brother.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not doing it out of malice, Tony, I actually find it adorable. You were already so lovesick for each other, your training programs have put you over the edge into...into... well, haha, I guess I&#39;m not sure what to call it: head over heels just doesn&#39;t seem to do it justice. All of which is absolutely adorable, hence the laugh.&quot;<br />
Tony continues to pout, sighing and gazing at the clock. Max sighs as well, putting aside his papers and getting up, crossing the room to his pony brother. With a firm but gentle hand, he reaches out to stroke Tony&#39;s mane, his back, his flanks. Tony feels himself tearing up, and turns towards his brother in an embrace. Max enfolds his pony in his arms, making gentle shushing noises as Tony whimpers. It&#39;s an odd picture - even though, via the power of the Chronivac, Max is now the elder, Tony is a good deal taller. But Tony submits to his master&#39;s ministrations just as if he were a small child - or, perhaps more pertinently, a beloved pet.<br />
<br />
Sniffling, Tony eventually raises his head.<br />
&quot;Why am I so -sniffle- emotional?&quot;<br />
Max shakes his head.<br />
&quot;You really weren&#39;t listening to a word the doctor said while I was grooming you, were you? It&#39;s a side effect of the breeder programming. Your body is biochemically wired to make you form as many deep emotional bonds as possible for the next week or so. It&#39;ll be even worse for Roger, but it&#39;s part of the breeding training. Without it you&#39;d all just be bundles of libido, and you&#39;d burn yourselves out within a week. This will give you the emotional wherewithal to avoid that.&quot;<br />
And, he didn&#39;t mention, most breeder pony owners used this period to imprint on their ponies, making them ideal sex slaves. Putting aside the unwholesome image of doing so to his own brother, pony or not, Max wasn&#39;t, as a pony owner, all that keen on the standard uses of breeder ponies. He felt they were unbelievably useful in maintaining herd community and morale, so the reduction of them to mere sex slaves always rankled him both ethically and aesthetically.<br />
<br />
Tony wiped his eyes, nodding, standing up straight again. Max eyed him closely.<br />
&quot;Better?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, thanks, master. It just came on in a wave there, and then it passed.&quot;<br />
Max nodded.<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be a bit different when you get a good whiff of Roger&#39;s pheromones. I&#39;m inclined to lock you two in a breeder stall for a day or two and sort it out later.&quot;<br />
Tony laughed, but then stopped. His brother looked deadly serious.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re...what?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m thinking about locking you two in a normal horse stall, used for breeding, for about 48 hours, so you can get the highest heat out of your system and you can both function normally.&quot;<br />
Tony gaped. He was shocked. He was mildly appalled.<br />
He was majorly aroused.<br />
<br />
Max smirked, gesturing to his pony&#39;s rapidly inflating cock.<br />
&quot;See? He&#39;s not even here, and you&#39;re already like this. You&#39;re no good for race training right now, not until the worst of the high wears off.&quot;<br />
Tony was flabbergasted.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just...it seems so...like we&#39;re...&quot;<br />
&quot;Animals?&quot; Max said with a small grin. &quot;Exactly. Look, is it the best solution? No, actually, probably not. But is it the best, shall we say, honeymoon that I can give you as your master? I think so.&quot;<br />
Max&#39;s grin widened, and Tony felt his own lips peeling back.<br />
&quot;And I think you agree, don&#39;t you boy?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly they hear footsteps from the hall. Two sets: one lighter, and the other heavy, and with a distinct clopping noise. Max turns to his brother and raises his eyebrows.<br />
&quot;Speak of the devil, time to meet your mate, I think.&quot;<br />
Tony can&#39;t help himself, he whinnies in joy. The clopping sound suddenly gets louder, faster, and there&#39;s a sound of Doctor Kenworth telling someone to slow down, before the door bursts open and Tony sees...him.<br />
<br />
Roger, rather than essentially meeting expectations, had exceeded them altogether. 7&#39;6&quot;, 310 pounds of pure muscle, shining black horsehide and beautifully curling mane, ears and face much like Tony&#39;s, he grinned at his lover. He stepped towards him with giant, soup bowl hooves, his softball testicles bouncing under a 26&quot; horsecock, which rose to attention as he approached Tony. But what caught Tony off guard was the *smell.* The sheer power of the musk that his stud was putting off was enough to make Tony weak at the knees. He was about to rush him when he heard a small click and felt a tug.<br />
Glancing down, he saw that his arms were now pinned to his body in a normal ponyboy harness, with Max adjusting the straps.<br />
&quot;Roger, be a good pony and kneel down so Doctor Kenworth can get you harnessed too,&quot; Max said, calmly.<br />
Roger and Tony both looked confused.<br />
&quot;Uh, sure,&quot; said Roger, kneeling down while the out of breath doctor began strapping him up, rendering his meaty arms as useless as Tony&#39;s. &quot;But can&#39;t we have a minute to-&quot;<br />
<br />
Max turned to his second pony and spoke firmly.<br />
&quot;No, and I will tell you why. I&#39;m going to tie you two up in the horse trailer, and then I&#39;m going to get you two home as fast as possible, because that is the best way to get you and Tony some proper alone time. Tony will explain the rest of the plan on the way,&quot; he added, already hauling Tony by a lead while an orderly helped do the same with Roger. Tony grinned as he passed his stud.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you worry, Roger! Think of this as foreplay!&quot; Tony said, whisking his tail up and showing Roger his winking horse asshole.<br />
Roger grinned as well, snorting, feeling his breeder training begin to take over.<br />
&quot;As long as I get to tap that filly ass, I&#39;m fine!&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon they were tied into the horse trailer, close enough to talk and, torturously, to smell each other, but not enough to touch. Tony shudder, licking his lips and grinning.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid this is gonna be a long drive, stud, but you&#39;ll like the next couple of days...I know I will...&quot;</p>
