<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The man lets out a thunderous roar.. And then.. You see him fight for control. His head spasms, painful cracks as he screams.. The pupils of his eyes fading from human to beast as his irises pop between his two forms..<br />
 A horrid mocking smirk forming a ghastly glare between your murderous looking visage.<br />
<br />
Is your humanity lost?! Could you fight for anything besides your own survival?!? In that instance.. At the expense of many, too many!! For each second it takes in dying so much more time.. But, if you lose it entirely and give in... What&#39;s the point!? Survival and Humanity?? Come on! Too much sorrow, suffering has to pass away.. How long before these bastards have.. You gasp.. But.. Suddenly one thing appears<br />
<br />
The man, struggling for control gnashes and then.. fights.. His head ringing.. Blood.. Feast.. Save.. Eat.. Fight.. Breed.. Remember... Protect..<br />
<br />
The struggle inside his mind is a raging storm but eventually he&#39;s able to fight it off, snapping the struggling violent urges out as he stumbles into control.. for now as his toothy lips stretched so wide, his shining white canine fangs in his set of fangs grinning beyond numb with anxiety and joy in the fact that he won&#39;t lose anymore beautiful ones.. &quot;It rages inside of me.. I can hear it.. But.. I&#39;m sti.. ERRGH.. I&#39;m... St.. Still me.. Mostly.. Please.. Finish this!&quot;  he cries out, before tossing you the Silver blade! <br />
<br />
Nervously, fingers grip the hilt of his mystical blade as you focus.. The two other lycans come to attack.. And you feeling a surge of strength retake you, along with feelings of vulnerability as you pause between their slashes and thrusts and pierce forward as you wrench back, twisting your blade, singing through the air like a beacon breaking loose before slashing both deeply! The lycans roar.. Their bloodthirsty nature pierced by the cries of the first paint inflicted upon their supernaturally hardened hides.. <br />
<br />
They slash again, their claws coming closer to grabbing yours and ripping into meat, your death come so close.. Inches away their claws attempt to sink in.. yet you manage to duck away as they only mildly scrape you, Another thud echoes across the grounds and steps before it washes as you slash your blades against the Lycans, the yelp comes crashing out as t he first falters. And the second, attempting to slash you while you&#39;re locked in, recieves a new slash in.. <br />
Their eyes tremble for the moment, the once, self seemingly immortal lycans quiver with eyes before the silver blade imbued by magic being the last spark of theirs remaining alive.<br />
<br />
Their voice squeaks as it barely says goodbye, their feral whining cry abruptly cut in half and dropping to three befalls yours!! Long steel canine fangs slam down and dig into your legs in the last few hours of battle where your breast meets your torso, cutting down though before slipping away into a mouthful of your flesh as your flesh feels the fangs burst open and poured forth, three appendages getting ripped out as your broken ribs spread, cracking....<br />
<br />
<br />
Seeing two dead and the scent of fallen in the air, the Lycans call a retreat as they flee from the scent of death.. The shattered city is in ruins.. Torn apart.. Many a brave soul lost in the battle.. But a band of 8 survivors grow to surround you.. led by the man you went to go try to save. Even though you were bitten at the end.. They all keep near.<br />
<br />
Feeling numbed from the freezing temperature.. You whimper in pain as your infection begins.. Your body is sweaty... boiling hot.. The claw marks feel like they burn like acid!...  Burning into your skin. You try to move yourself to your feet and fall back to press your back up against a dirty wall, breathing shallow gasps as you watch each survivor in fear behind you.... Worried of what you might become... Suddenly a voice breaks out.<br />
&quot;W.. Were you the one wh.. Who helped save us?&quot; cries a voice.<br />
<br />
One of the humans from the crowd rushes up, running past you before crying into your arms.. &quot;You.. You killed two off! You helped save us.. Without.. Them dying.. It might.. Have only been a matter of time..&quot; they cry.. And another.. Holds her from falling over.. Kissing her on the cheek softly.. &quot;But.. is that a bitemark.. On your leg!?!?! FUR!?!? NO!!!.&quot; She cries and shakes herself off.. Pulling the silver sword to clean and pressing it back against your chest, softly whispering over the cold metal.<br />
<br />
She tears to silence. And then softly pulls up her own thigh as well.. A soft bite mark on her neck. Her hair is also growing longer, natural tones thickening and stretching outwards as the start of dark black silky locks twine around as her blue eyes stare in horror at hers.. &quot;I.. I Got bitten.. Too.. There will never be a place for us.. among normal humans.. I&#39;m.. Christine&quot; She says..<br />
<br />
You can see she&#39;s a young adult about, much like you. She looks at you with fear in her green eyes.. Scared by your tear stained.. Shivering expression you try to push yourself to stand but she only falls right back down onto you...  You start to whimper as your eyes start to flash, numb sensations as coursing wild instincts threaten to invade.. But her arms hold onto you tight as you struggle against yourself. &quot;No!! Don&#39;t!! Y.. You can&#39;t end it like this.. You can&#39;t lose yourself.. You can&#39;t become a beast..  Don&#39;t die!!&quot; She calls, her eyes watering..<br />
<br />
&quot;I.. I.. We&#39;re both going to transform.. into.. creatures like them.. Aren&#39;t we?&quot; she whimpers.. Looking at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;L.. Lets. Let&#39;s get out of here.. So we don&#39;t die.. Lets run.. Run as far as we can away from them.. Take shelter far far away.. Please...&quot; Her words sound like they weigh tons upon your shoulders.. Your ravished  mind, ravaged by the mental thoughts invading your lycanthropic body howl out louder than you ever did before. But... Somehow you&#39;re able to blink and hold on.. You&#39;re still inside your body.. Watching it not.. entirely lose control.. nor lose control either.. You&#39;re struggling with the beast inside.. and Her grip was loosing but it feels so comforting as she clutched you and held you down.. <br />
<br />
&quot;H.. H.. W.. Was... H.. Human...&quot; cries a soft, whimpering voice from your mouth.<br />
&quot;Y.. Y.. yes.. We were..&quot; Christine cries, looking after you with a soft hand over your chest as her emerald eyes gaze back at  you.<br />
<br />
&quot;B.. Blood.. KILL.. EAT!.. N.. NO!!!.!&quot; moans your tortured muzzle&#39;s voice, your savage beating heart overwhelming your brain with horrific images of pain and tearing others more into pieces. You whimper and the anger drains to nothing but a mere heartbeat as you grip and claw yourself harder within... Your savage, overtaken hunter senses triggering beyond your last shred of human sanity and using last ounce of your ability to regain control over the savage, invasive lycan instinct attempting to drain out your mind! &quot;P.. PLEASE.. NO.. WANT..&quot; you whimper.. &quot;KILL.. NO.. EAT.. NO!!&quot;<br />
<br />
 She cradles you. &quot;N.. No!.. WE. We have to.. We can&#39;t let it end like this!&quot; Christine cries.. brushing away against your hardening legs.. the fur engulfing upon your bodies.. You feel your jaw snapping in place as your body contorts into one like the lycan&#39;s that bit you as your body stretches..  Catching your elbow. Tugging it in over. Bringing you to hover above the floor.. Running to pull out drawers beneath your hole in the floor as wood settles underneath you.. Your eyes stay firmly in hers, and then nearly desperate are looking at you. &quot;N.. NEED TO LIVE!! THE WORLD DOES NOT END HERE!!&quot; you sob into her lips that feel warm and warm.. A smile appearing... As your tail twitches uncontrollably over her head. A large tail..<br />
<br />
You knew you shouldn&#39;t let it infect you completely.. A feeling lingers where the bite hit.. Almost burning where it lacerated your flesh.. But, by some miracle, it hurt.. But now the open gaping wounds before.. Were now quickly closing.. Your muscles bulge as they twinge from adrenaline surging throughout your system...<br />
<br />
 Still panting as if you had run just moments ago.. Only breathing as deep, raspy breaths as Christine holds you close..<br />
<br />
Then lifting an arm off.. Gradually rising until you feel her wrap her smaller waist around your own.. She smiles softly.. Letting you feel her own soft sprouting fur against your own.. Pushing back against her until you free yourself.. Flinching at the intense stretch in your collarbone as your shoulder pops back into place..<br />
<br />
&quot;Y.. You the one who helped save us?&quot; asks a calmer voice.. You look down and continue shifting your body around.. Christine you realize.. is transforming too.. But.. You seemed to have taken much more of the infection in.. Your body growing much longer.. Up to 9 feet long while she only grew up to 6 foot long.. .. She quivers  her lips.. And then.. She starts to caress your clothes.. Prying them open of the sprouting fur as you yip.. Feeling them pop open as your black Lycan fur spills out..<br />
<br />
You cry a tear of shame.. You turned into the monster you were fighting.. yet.. Christine is smiling at you.. Softly.. &quot;.. That.. That doesn&#39;t matter... I don&#39;t know how much longer we can hold on.. Or even if we can.. Lets.. let&#39;s do this one time.. As us okay?? If we had more time to be  human.. We could have met each other.. Fought for eachother.. Stayed human even. Lets.. Let&#39;s set this before we lose ourselves.. I always wanted to meet my prince charming.. This world was harsh.. But&quot;.. Christine&#39;s voice falters...<br />
<br />
You lower your nose into a sniffle as you watch it grow into a black, spotted snout.. Your muzzle elongating while your eyes softly shift to become golden like the night creatures that  bit you, which causes her to face crush her face into yours as she brushes against you.. Nibbling and biting.. Softly kissing you the fur slowly falling away around you as her white teeths bite gently.. Until you had regained complete human control. <br />
<br />
Once out.. You saw more scars marking into her pussy..<br />
<br />
You whimper.. She looks back... A shameful look on her eyes.. &quot;... I.. I still love you.. They took both of what they wanted from us.. now let&#39;s set thing&#39;s straight.&quot; Christine whimpers, a soft black velvety coat of fur covering you completely as her teeth scrape off the tips of your nipples to pierce them open, you moan as she starts to lick you.. Goading along the transformation as she looks at you.. Whimpering in the form of a gorgeous.. but tragic black wolf werebeast.. She smiles back at your frame.. And then.. Pushes her soft, plumpy silken folds against your cock..<br />
<br />
She gasps lightly as they dig into her breasts.. her small, jealous sharp teeth clashing together playfully on your chest as the shattered shreds of clothes, now nothing but a ripped mesh of silk shirt of fine white cloth falls off her chest.. Leaving her barely visible scars, red, and yet fading. She gives a soft, knowing smile.. And nuzzles against you.. As if counting the hours left until she doesn&#39;t know what will happen.. Will.. Will you two manage to hold on.. Or Will.. Will you lose yourself?<br />
<br />
 She.. She smiles at you.. and then.. softly takes your cock.. and laps at it.. Your once pink mushroom head now swelling as her warm, wet mouth envelops around it, swallowing hard as it becomes stiff. Slamming shut around her tongue, thrusting it up further while moving onto a licking rhythm.. Wiggling those playful lips.. Smacking her cherry sized lips around it in and out.. So softly as to barely break the surface. Finally, nibbling a few times and pulling it from within.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you would hate me.. like this but...&quot; She exclaims.. Wrapping a tongue.. around your shaft.. &quot;I.. In a way.. I&#39;m just glad you didn&#39;t leave me like this.. I&#39;m glad..  I&#39;m glad you cared about us.. Even..  if we both lost ourselves.. at least we could have found each other in these moments... It makes you happy.. I&#39;d rather go with you.. Even if i lost myself.. Than never even knowing... What it would have been like.. To have fallen.. and ran away.. and  never looked back. &quot; Her voice cracks but soon she settles as she walks towards you.. Again you notice her small breasts as she lifts one by one, exposing them with her teasing fangs hovering between her teeth, jaw shaking slightly as she moved from licking your cock to tugging your arm.. <br />
<br />
Your hands, hesitantly stop.. and then instinctively touch behind her head as you console her. &quot;.. Don&#39;t worry about it.. I was lucky to meet you too, and never more thankful. You helped me.. You protected me.. You helped me hold on.. I don&#39;t know if i would have held on.. Without anyone there for me.. You let me hold on when i could have never met you&quot; you softly smile, a tear in your eye.  Her eyes looked back at yours, smiling... looking sad for a moment, and then grateful.. &quot;And.. I&#39;m grateful i could have such a big doof to be with too.. And i mean that well.. Thanks for coming for us.. Even if.. It was all you could..&quot; she smiles, and then nibbled deeply against your cheek, before she nuzzled her head between them, forcefully forcing their sweet velvety tongues to clash. She glides her soft, wet puffy slip... to the tip of your cock.. You gasp.. &quot;A.. Are you sure.. You want to do this?&quot;  you ask.. Concerned.. and yet.. You can&#39;t deny that the desire is there.. But after all that&#39;s happened.. You want to know she does too.<br />
<br />
She smiles, &quot;Yes.. I love you. But..&quot; she then frowns.. &quot;W.. We aren&#39;t.. plain humans anymore..  Now.. We&#39;re lycans.. We don&#39;t ever transform back into humans... But.. Maybe we can hold on.... remembering ourselves.. Recovering.. remembering.. cherishing our.. Humanity... And refusing to.. Let the beast take over. &quot; she smiles softly at you,  Sensations explode against the hard walls of her delicate tightness. Warm, moist soft flesh, heated and fragile skins glistening beneath the soft red light of her lampshade lighting across the alleys she led you to safely, while she pressed her sexual lips around your already splayed cock. You whimper.. Filling her air with yours. Clutching at the fur wall. Hands, weakly shaking off, nervously sliding along the creamy midnight thighs underneath of you, sinking deeper, devouring her as it shook off with ease through bare and smooth skin, throbbingly pulsing. Swaying upwards to press against her fur covered chest. Eager warmth that felt almost constricting as its plush firm flesh presses itself against your head like that of a pillow. Like sitting directly on top of her moonlit breasts! Grinding...<br />
<br />
Your transformations emerge easily as your mind grows dull and daydreams float about… Your surroundings dim.. For now you noticed a new silence, knowing her feelings. Remembering past dark, hard stone walls where both sexes lined its corners from bottom to top like memories. The usual parade being held throughout below. Her black pussylips filled with gold leaf petals that reflect back as your fingernailed clawtips suddenly drip sticky moisture in front of both, wrapping around to guide you deeper inside. Spreading their pelvises wide.. Expanding...<br />
<br />
And then. Your new canine knot locks in.. Swelling inside her.. She yelps.. Pleading with her breathless lungs against your warm member.. Her chest becoming wilder as it glowed in crimson colors against the silvery hue. Moaning and sighing beneath her cool but supple skin, flaring red sparks following after every rhythm. Sucking vigorously as every muscle rushes electricity inside your veins; panting intensely.. <br />
<br />
Leaving you breathless… Incoherent… Exhausted from an undescribable release; while grabbing your torso squeezing your balls tightly within those tiny pouches.. Pulling you deeper into her flaming cuntal chasm. Drinking you like wine but coated in dew. Milking you of seed so quickly until your balls pump dry..... Her fingers gripping tightly as both begin grinding herself on your pleasurably stretched prick with newfound fervor until her legs slid apart.. and plunged right into deep waters that was steaming and feeling way hotter than usual.. Hiding your raging prick away from public view, already firing shots of adrenalin wildly through your vascular network.. A salivation coming about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.. Yes... God I&#39;m soo fucking ready! Give it to me,&quot; She pants in need desperately while pulling your face near her squishy breast, pleading under your paws again as she grips at the handle of your magic knot. A smoldering glow fading as you watched her muzzle moans in a soft coo.. A howl erupting as you orgasm inside of her, popping off soft walls lining against an enthralling mess that gave you insane pleasure as you felt as though to burst in a breeze away from everyone around them. Muscles locking in as you cum and knot and cum and knot.. Time after time again.. <br />
<br />
She feels your sperm break through her hymen and swim towards her eggs. She smiles and presses into you.. Glorious folds opening. You couldnt tell before all of your balls bubbling ready to ejaculate. Just like that.. Flooding inside her. With no barriers left from previous corrosions.. Leaving both orgasmic. One.. One pleasure.. One climax. She could feel you cum inside of her.. Right within the depths. Pressing against her womb upon releasing fluids and deflorating at least two dozen eggs worth of moonlit love.. A suffocating pleasure..<br />
<br />
Her hands squeezed his ass close. Shaking side to side uncontrollably with silent ecstasy as she prepared to penetrate deeper than ever before. Tensing her crotch while sighing steadily as you become engrossed in your intercourse while not wanting to stop moving; grasping at those radiant hips and screwing her ravenously before surging out a dribble of cum against her tender flesh, clinging it with sugary semen whilst both voices out calloused groans.<br />
<br />
As.. Those sexy warm tongues pulled against the sides of your cock hard at any chance.. Then buckling up, smiling, cuddling.. Caressing her as she rubs your own body lovingly, Touching hers further into where he drags her pelvis along your own as each circle lick inside with inner vitality in a carnival ride filled with regret. Your tears through the natural pelt as it grinds the slick lips over the blunt ridges, the hardness slipping inside with the wet snapping sound of penetration without complaining to stretch out.. The night ends with love as the night fades away.</p>
