<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Chronivac booted up, &quot;Battery at 95%, Hello and welcome to the latest piece of hardware from Chronivac Industries, the world-wide leaders of genetic research and development. What lies before you is ...&quot; Yea, Yea Ryan thought, as he hurried to the map screen as he lay in bed. He began to scroll over to where the party was happening. There they were, a number of little red dots in the middle of the field.  Ryan watched as the dots moved around corresponding with what he assumed was the movement of the people in real life.  He found the dot labeled David Searle and clicked on it.  The machine generated a little model of David correct down to the clothes he was wearing that evening. Ryan clicked in on David&#39;s stats:<br />
<br />

<br />
David was such a cocky asshole he was always bragging about his sexual conquests. If Ryan hadn&#39;t been so mad, he might have considered it sad.  David had nothing, he still lived at his parent&#39;s house, he had no future to speak of, all he had were his stories about banging chicks and ruining them for other men.  Ryan was going to take even this from him.  Ryan had seen David talking to Lindsay that night, he could see on the map that they were still near each other. David was undoubtedly attempting to seal the deal with her.  Before he did, Ryan was going to make some changes. <br />
<br />
Name: David Searle<br />
Weight: 240 Pounds<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Sexuality: 67% Heterosexual<br />
Body Fat: 33%<br />
Penis, Hard: 1.8” Inches<br />
Penis, Soft: 0.7&quot; Inches<br />
<br />
Ryan turned up the sensitivity of David&#39;s cock so that he&#39;d shoot his load almost immediately during sex.  Ryan considered shrinking David&#39;s baseball size testicles down but the image of David&#39;s little member flanked by his ample nuts made Ryan giggle.  He accepted the changes. Before moving onto Lindsay&#39;s profile, if only to get a chance to see her naked.  <br />
<br />
David was feeling good. He loved getting drunk and loved crushing pussy.  He was already drunk and now Lindsay was going to give it up to him.  He loved the look on a girls face when they first saw his meaty cock.  The shock in their eyes and the excited comments about it being &quot;soo huge&quot; and &quot;much bigger than the other guys they&#39;d been with&quot; were a turn on for him.  Locking eye contact with them as they tried to fit it in their mouths to deep throat him, hearing them moan as his stretched their gash out, filling them with his shot after shot of his man sauce. He loved it all.  He felt an electric tingle in his groin for few seconds. Must be excited he thought to himself.  He took another pull off whatever bottle of cheap whiskey was going around and turned to Lindsay, &quot;want to go and check out the barn?&quot; he slurred.  She agreed and they headed over to the barn together.  <br />
<br />
Once inside David started going through his usual list of come ons.  &quot;You&#39;re the prettiest girl here,&quot; &quot;I&#39;ve wanted to talk to you for so long but haven&#39;t had the chance,&quot; and finally &quot;I really want to kiss you.&quot; Lindsay was no fool, she knew David had a reputation, and that part of that reputation included him being well hung.  She wanted to know if it was true.  The two made out furiously for a few minutes before they started to shed clothing.  &quot;God your tits are perfect,&quot; David said once her bra was off.  &quot;Guys have told me my pussy is magic&quot; she said softly before dropping her pants and panties and laying on the ground on her back, &quot;that it can tame any snake.&quot; David smiled, she wanted his D.&quot;I&#39;ve got an anaconda for you&quot; he said proudly moving towards her on all fours.  He kicked off his pants and got on top of her.  Something didn&#39;t feel right, but he wasn&#39;t going to worry about that now.  He placed one arm under her head and used the other to pull his briefs down.  His dick didn&#39;t feel as heavy as it normally did.  But he wasn&#39;t going to worry about that now.  AS he moved to slide into her, something odd happened.  He came. Before he even got into her.  &quot;What the fuck?&quot; exclaimed a very surprised Lindsay. She reached down and felt the cum on her bald vagina, then reached up and felt Dave&#39;s tiny member.  &quot;ohh,&quot; she exhaled, &quot;I guess the rumors weren&#39;t true.&quot; Jeff rolled off of her shocked.  He looked down at his tiny dick working to explain what happened both to her and himself.  While David was stammering, Lindsay put her clothes on and walked out, thinking that that was a waste of time.</p>
