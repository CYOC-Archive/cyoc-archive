<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff did not know the name of his owner and Mistress, but he knew she was a controlling woman!<br />
<br />
Standing on all fours, his goat legs being shorter than were human legs of his Mistress and his sister, left Jeff struggling to fawn his forelegs onto the pasture fence. Almost standing upright against the fence allowed Jeff to watch as the two females he felt a sense of human love for walked beyond his view. Jeff was worried, he knew from his several sexual encounters with his Mistress as to her lust drive spiteful ways. He stood there by the fence feeling more aroused, his hot-dog girth of his goat buck penis standing seventeen inches stiff, poked through the open squares of the pasture fence.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood there bleating, he screaming an occasional buck goat cry of the human English language word &quot;No!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sis, Darla Kyle, Jeff remembered her name still, as if from the Adrenalin spike from his fear for the safety of his sister, even Jeff the horny buck goat held a small affection for his usually, nagging sister.<br />
<br />
Darla and Melissa at some point during their walking into the main house, greeted and informed the other as to their names.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to see my new, as the more updated version of the Chronivac system 5.5, it owns amazing abilities!&quot; Miss Melissa said to Darla.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, they updated the program recently, I did not get any notice as yet.&quot; Darla said, although she had seen and read through some of the program details, she did not know how or of what it could do. She knew well enough of what the computer program and the rays emitter did to her brother. When Darla first realized how the computer program told of its working abilities, she recalled often of feeling glad she was rid of her brother.<br />
<br />
As does time heal all wounds, so does the feeling of loss bring on a renewed desire to have again what is not there to own. Darla lost the friendship of her brother, and after the many weeks that he had gone, disappeared, and became a goat animal, his sister felt a want for him to return home. Darla reiterated some of what she felt about, telling her adversary of family details Miss Melissa did not as then know.<br />
<br />
Melissa plopped down her royal butt on the swivel chair by her big computer desk. She moved the mouse and lit the program as the hard drive spun alive and was waiting for a command.  &quot;This new array is quite different from the one you have at home I imagine,&quot; Melissa said to Darla.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes the emitter array is twice the size of what my brother built. Jeff, your newest herd sire buck goat, was my brother!<br />
He did not understand the parameters of the program, he was quite new at toying with the array when he transitioned his body to being your prize winning big buck goat. To be quite truthful, I think it is best he should remain his full term of eleven years as your buck before you would return him to being human. I suspect you would return him to be as human after so many years. Although, I have to imagine his personality would retain many manners or lack of human qualities after living daily being a brute animal for eleven years.<br />
<br />
Oh my, but your emitter is of a different color than mine!&quot; Darla said, as she took a cautious stance away from where Miss Melissa might with a hard shove, push the sister of the farm sire goat under the body changing rays.<br />
<br />
Miss Melissa knew what Darla was thinking when she stepped back and away from her being at the edge of the rays reflector green pad she had screwed into place on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong,&quot; Miss Melissa asked of her guest and a likely victim for the emitter array to change and make silent of what she knew, or was suspecting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Caution, I feel a need for personal caution when here, as I was a bit too close to the green reflector pad. You rationalized who I was in coming here to lease your buck sire, as wanting to take him home and using my machine, return to him some of what he lacks from becoming an animal in form.&quot; Darla said, as Melissa smiled an evil or sordid like grin.<br />
<br />
Melissa leaned back on her desk chair and sighing as she said, &quot;Jeff is more than just my prized buck herd sire, he has accepted another role as my weekend lover!<br />
<br />
Yes, and do not look so shocked, as Jeff was a male, and is an enhanced male, I used my program to enlarge his goat sized genitals. He sports a goat penis of seventeen inches, three time the average length of a buck goat cock. I increased the girth of his goat penis to similar the bulked width like a Conney-Island hot dog, and tapering of it to a pointy end, allowing him still to mate with doe goats and me. An oddity about the total loss of his circumcised crown done to his penis, he acts more like a prime male buck goat whether with me on the weekends or during the week with his friendly herd.<br />
<br />
Your information about his choice of eleven years to remain a goat was misleading. I know from the Chronivac registry of what people purchased the array program. Your brother entered as the duration for his changed self to become a buck goat spanned 60 days, not an odd amount like eleven years. Although, if I had my druthers about Jeff being a goat for the next eleven years, I would like him to stay a buck goat; he makes a wildly sexy lover for any Saturday or Sunday!<br />
<br />
Huh, oh stop with that stunned look of a surprise. You saw Jeff being sexually aroused after he saw you standing beside me by the pasture gate. I watched you stare with feminine lust, wishing to know as feel what a cock of such girth and length would feel like sunken deep and twitching.<br />
<br />
If you wish to, and might like to have a try with him mated in you, I shall slide back, and let you do the inputs, choosing the parameters, as become a doe goat, or a anthropoid-doe goat for a day, a weekend, or longer if you like what Jeff has to offer.&quot; <br />
<br />
A stern expression on her face, and Darla stood there slowly wagging her head as if to deny her wants of ever wishing to become an animal, or part animal, or let her horny brother have sex with his sister. &quot;I hold to taught moral teachings, and incest is not a part of my life. Jeff, he becoming physically a buck goat, and living daily the lifestyle of a male goat, I would expect him to forget his religious teachings. Indeed, I am saving my purity for the right man in my future, and do not wish to lose my virginity in a sinful act of quick sensations and beastly actions.&quot; Darla said, as she took another step backwards toward the door to that room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, OK then, but understand this, your brother, is my property. Jeff is an animal and therefore lacking of all human rights by his becoming a buck goat. I want for him to remain as he is, and will delight with him every weekend. You cannot take him from here, he belongs to me, I paid a price and bought him, it is legally accounted at the county animal shelter as to my purchasing one brown buck goat for duty as a herd sire at my goat farm. I want him to remain here, and when his 60 days are about to terminate, a simple linking of the Chronivac registry to my computer will transfer his choices here. <br />
<br />
I own Jeff and he has come to like being an animal, a hearty buck goat; and on the weekends he satisfies my sexual hunger for male cock.<br />
<br />
I think it is time for you to leave, or if you changed your mind and want to feel a long cock delving deep, then step up and accept my offer of a short stay.&quot; Melissa said, as Darla continued to back away and turned when she felt the door casing, she walked out the house.<br />
<br />
Darla saw Jeff still aroused and standing, leaning over the pasture gate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good bye brother of mine, enjoy your lust for sex and debauchery with &quot;THAT&quot; woman!&quot; Darla said to her beast or a brother, as she turned to point at Miss Melissa standing at the rear door to her home, she smiling a lusty sort of grin.</p>
