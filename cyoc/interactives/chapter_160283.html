<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mia and Zack blinked  as they now appeared with the confines of the hotel. The couple had been surprised to see their god daughter summon them once more and quickly made haste to travel to the past. This time though they were not alone as the future Ayami and Rexie now accompanied the newlywed couple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rexie where are we,&quot; Mia asked as she tried to get her bearings. The overweight tabby cat glanced around before shifting into her imp form. &quot;Oh no,&quot; she whispered. &quot;It cant be!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Zack asked. &quot;What cant be?&quot;<br />
<br />
An unearthly howl now echoed throught he halls of the hotel causing Mia and Zack to shudder with fear. Traumatic visions of their childhood came pouring back into the two adults. &quot;No,&quot; Zack whispered. &quot;No that cant be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Voids,&quot; Mia whispered. Turning towards her husband, she now watched as Zack began to transform. The man now grew in size, his muscles swelling as thick dark fur began to cover his body. Zack&#39;s height stretched upwards, standing close tob12 feet tall, his sander raised as the massive wolf beast bared his fangs. &quot;Voids,&quot; he roared. &quot;How are there Voids!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa settle down,&quot; Ayemi exclaimed, trying to restrain a now angry and fearful werewolf. Mia now glared at her familiar a mixture of terror and fury on her face. &quot;Rexie what the hell is going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The battle of the hotel,&quot; the imp whispered. &quot;Shit! Of all the places to time travel too, we gotta end up here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wheres Yuki,&quot; Zack roared, foam beginning to form at his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont know,&quot; Rexie yelled angrily. &quot;But we have a bigger problem. If the Voids are here that means Akira&#39;s here too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Akira,&quot; Mia gasped. Zack looked at his wife, noticing the color drain from her face.  Pulling his wife close to him, he now tried to comfort her. &quot;Its okay honey he cant hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia was now visibly shaking as she recalled the five tails kitsune and the Voids. After escaping the hospital with the infant Yuriko the two children had dodged Akira and his Voids as they hunted the children. At the time Mia and Zack didn&#39;t know why. It wouldnt be until years later, when the children had grown into adults that they learned that Yuriko (and themselves) were special. They were the next generation of wizards, a group that would prove to be some of the most powerful forces of magic in history. Akira had been tasked with finding the children and destroying them.<br />
<br />
&quot;That bastard,&quot; Mia hissed, tears forming in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember,&quot; Zack said softly, (or as softly as a werewolf could). &quot;His taunts when we hid, his endless pursuit, the terror he inspired. He scared me too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Ayami said quickly. &quot;If Akira is here, that means?&quot; Almost on question the four now watched as a pair of kits now lept from the second floor, giggling as they raced away, looking to cause more mischief. &quot;Ah crap Cole and Claudia,&quot; Ayami groaned. &quot;He already found them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that means Yuriko is about to see them,&quot; Rexie sighed.<br />
<br />
Mia and Zack now listened as the anguished cry of a teenager rang out through the hotel. The couple instantly recognized the cry as their god daughter Yuriko.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah shes pissed,&quot; Rexie said flatly. Glancing at the couple the imp now tried to assume an authoritative stance as she looked at the two adults she had know since they were children. &quot;Listen you two,&quot; she stated. &quot;Before your goddaughter destroys this place, find Akira and make him change her dad and aunt back to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shes right,&quot; Zack sighed. &quot;We have to find Akira.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia nodded, they would have to face their fears to prevent their goddaughter from hurting anyone. &quot;Do you think we can,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know you can,&quot; Zack smiled. &quot;How many years did you spend learning to counter kitsune magic. There&#39;s nothing he can do to you hon. His magic cant hurt you.&quot; Mia could only nod before turning to their familiar companions. &quot;What about you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We better go check on our past selves,&quot; Rexie shrugged. &quot;We got beat up pretty bad. We better make sure the cavalry shows up in time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia and Zack now wished them luck, listening as the two demons argued over how badly they were hurt in this battle. As Mia and Zack rounded a corner they froze as they beheld the five tail kitsune in the foyer. &quot;Their he is,&quot; Zack said quietly. &quot;In his true form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia nodded, gulping as she gazed at the thing that had terrified her as a child. She had tried to forget about Akira. Now though she needed to protect her goddaughter from doing something she would regret. As they approached they could see Akira look them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; he smirked. &quot;I wasnt expecting more wizards. Or a werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia and Zack frowned as they now approached. &quot;We&#39;re not from around here,&quot; Zack said angrily. &quot;And we&#39;re not with the others. We do know all about you though Akira.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira seemed stunned that these two seemed to know him. &quot;No matter,&quot; he thought. &quot;Let them share the same fate as the last two wizards.&quot; In a flash Akiras tails now swept out, quickly enveloping the two intruders. As the tails retreated Akira could only smile at the two fox statues in front of him. &quot;Hmm guess my magic isnt as rusty as I thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akiras smile began to falter though as the statues began to shake. Narrowing his brow he watched as cracks slowly began to appear before both statues burst open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh I hate that spell,&quot; Mia groaned, cracking her neck. &quot;Guess all those hours of practice paid off.&quot; Akira appeared shocked as Mia simply smiled. &quot;My turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira watched as the witch now conjured a portal of pure darkness that engulfed her werewolf lover. Before Akira could speak he heard a low growl emanate behind him. The five tails tried to turn only to see the massive werewolves jaws close around his throat.<br />
<br />
Akira gagged as the werewolf now dangled him his jaws, like a hunting dog. &quot;Interesting sensation huh,&quot; Mia smirked. &quot;Kind of paralyzing. Dont worry though I know through personal experience Zacks mouth can be VERY gentle, unless provoked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite the thick fur covering Zacks body, Mia could swear she could see him blush slightly at her compliment of his &quot;oral skils&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want,&quot; Akira wheezed.<br />
<br />
Mia paused as she heard the obvious sounds of destruction behind her. &quot;Do you hear that sound,&quot; she asked the kitsune. &quot;That&#39;s the sound of my goddaughter. You really pissed her off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you,&quot; Akira asked, choking as Zacks jaws tightened slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll give you the short version,&quot; Mia said. &quot;You see my husband and I are from the future, your future. More specifically what could have been future.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira gave the witch a look of confusion as she now leaned in. &quot;You have no idea how much I&#39;ve hated you,&quot; Mia snarled. &quot;In this time, you terrorized me. I&#39;ve feared you more than half my life and youve been dead for 14 years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akiras eyes went wide as Mia told him his future. Dead?! How? How could he have died.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wont tell you how it ends Akira,&quot; Mia stated. &quot;But it&#39;s not pretty. What I am offering you though is a chance, a slight chance to get out of here tonight with your life. That sound you hear is the daughter of the man you transformed, the man you fought.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira now watched as the witch paced in front of him, her werewolf lover keeping him firmly in between his jaws. If he tried to attack at this point he had little doubt his neck would be snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont want my goddaughter bloodying her hands,&quot; Mia snarled. &quot;I dont want your death on her conscience, so heres the deal. Change Cole and Claudia back and you get to leave with your life, maybe change your destiny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I refuse,&quot; Akira wheezed, Zack tightening his grip on his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;You refuse my husband ends your life and with it the spell,&quot; Mia said, leaning in close as she gave her worst fear an icy stare. &quot;Your magic isnt strong enough to last past your death. My husband and I have walked the line between light and darkness for most of our lives. We already have blood on our hands. A little more wont make a difference. Blood on our goddaughters hands though is different. We wont let her soil her soul so please, end the spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira gasped, listening to the sounds of destruction that was steadily approaching. If he ended the spell on the girls family he had a chance at life and a chance at altering his fate. His decision would now determine his fate.</p>
