<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam bolted out of the room and ran down the stairs as Jen and her new slutty Jen dickgirl both lunged for Sam.  Jen&#39;s lack of coordination due to the sudden change caused her to miss entirely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooof&quot; &quot;Ow!&quot; Jen and the new Jen slutty dickgirl both exclaimed as they both landed face first on the floor.  They both looked at the door as Sam ran out.  &quot;Dammit&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll never catch her&quot;<br />
<br />
The double sensations Jen felt from both her own original body, and the new slutty dickgirl copy of her were overwhelming.  Not only was she seeing, hearing, and feeling everything twice, she was also thinking and acting twice at the same time.  <br />
<br />
Both Jens rose to a sitting position and looked each other over.  It was pretty obvious which was the original - The original had midnight black hair and modest yet attractive breasts.  The new slutty dickgirl had blonde streaks in her hair, and huge breasts, way beyond normal D size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.  I guess I&#39;m pretty horny right now.&quot; &quot;And Sam a bit too.&quot;  The Jens commented, both looking at the slutty dickgirl&#39;s enormous breasts, a sign of arousal of the host.  The original Jen was Sam&#39;s host, and Sam was the slutty dickgirl&#39;s host, so it seemed likely that the arousal came as much from Jen as from Sam.<br />
<br />
Original Jen spoke, &quot;So, tricky question.  Are we an us?&quot; &quot;Or are us an I?&quot; &quot;Hey, stop that.  I&#39;m trying to-&quot; The slutty dickgirl Jen interrupted, &quot;-to figure out if we&#39;re one person or two people.  Yeah, I know.  I think we&#39;re one person&quot;<br />
<br />
Original was pretty sure she knew what slutty dickgirl was going to say, but she waited patiently for slutty dickgirl to speak, just in case she was wrong.  Even as slutty dickgirl spoke, she knew what slutty dickgirl was saying before it ever reached her lips.  &quot;I&#39;m your dickgirl.  If we are two people, I wouldn&#39;t be able to feel anything on your body.  Like how Sam can&#39;t.  But if I can feel your body, that proves we&#39;re one person.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Both Jens smiled and stood up together.  The original Jen spoke, &quot;I&#39;ll go test that theory.&quot;  The slutty dickgirl Jen responded, &quot;I&#39;ll track down Sam.  She&#39;s still going to get 2 more dickgirls from that curse and I don&#39;t want to wind up with more of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Original Jen went to her room and closed the door as much as she could.  The fleshy tube connecting her to Sam propped the door open slightly.  She retrieved her diary from the dresser and wrote into it:<br />
<br />
<i>I think I fucked up today.  I used the curse on Sam to give her a dickgirl so she would get a taste of what it&#39;s been like to be me.  That seemed to work okay, she was pretty miserable for a while.  Then I wanted to punish her, so I cursed her again to get 3 more dickgirls based on porn pics from the internet.  Can&#39;t fail, right?</i><br />
<br />
<i>Oh god did it fail.  She found a naked picture of me.  WHY IS THERE A NAKED PICTURE OF ME ON THE INTERNET?!?!  But now I think I might be my own dickgirl.  Her dickgirl tube connected to me, and it split off what is basically a copy of me.  Except I see, hear, feel, and even think everything in the copy.  My copy and I can talk and we had a conversation, but I knew everything my copy was going to say before she said it.  And she knew what I was going to say before I said it.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Even now, my copy is looking for Sam, but it&#39;s like I&#39;m controlling her.  Right now she (or me?) is walking around outside downstairs following Sam&#39;s tube.  I&#39;m going to choose to make my copy stop walking now.  Holy shit she stopped walking.  Okay she can walk again.  And now she&#39;s walking again.  Mom&#39;s flower garden looks nice, but I just saw a rabbit leave it so there goes the garden.</i><br />
<br />
<i>This is so fucked up.  It&#39;s like I&#39;m in 2 spots at once.  Except one of me is a dickgirl with huge boobs.  And is super horny.  Like unreasonably horny.  She almost fucked my mom.  I didn&#39;t have too much of an issue when Sam or Sayler did it.  But I don&#39;t want to do that.  Oh wow Alice from next door looks so sexy right now.  My copy just has to...  PUMPKIN SPICE</i><br />
<br />
Down in the yard, slutty dickgirl Jen had gone over to Alice, and asked her to fuck.  Her response was an instant yes, and now slutty dickgirl Jen was fucking Alice as hard as she could.  Up in her room, original Jen felt every motion, every sensation, every blissful moment through her slutty dickgirl&#39;s body, and then also felt it a second time from her pussy where the tube connected to Sam.  She tried to reduce the pleasure she felt from Sam and Sam&#39;s dickgirls, but only the sensations from the tube diminished.  Original Jen collapsed to the floor as wave after wave of pleasure surged through her.<br />
<br />
<br />
About 5 minutes later down in the yard, slutty dickgirl Jen finished having sex with Alice, and stood up to resume her search for Sam.  She could feel the waves of pleasure still washing over original Jen.  <i>&#39;Pumpin spice?  Really?  Why was that the code phrase I decided on.  I think this is proof that I&#39;m one person...  Sam made me my own dickgirl&#39;</i>  Jen mused as she continued to follow the flesh tube to where Sam was hiding.<br />
<br />
Sam had hopped the fence, and was a few yards down.  As she climbed over fence after fence, Jen continued to think about her new situation.  <i>&#39;This really isn&#39;t so bad.  I think this might actually be pretty neat.  Being able to be in two places at once.  Sure, it&#39;s not ideal that when I get really horny and have sex, the original me is useless for a while, but it sure feels great.  Plus, Alice was amazing.&#39;</i><br />
<br />
Up in her room, original Jen&#39;s mind was finally starting to clear from the waves of pleasure.  &quot;Oh... yep that proves it.  I&#39;m one person.  And... why am I talking to myself?&quot;  She closed up her diary and put it back.  Then went to Sam&#39;s room to see what all Sam had been looking at online.  If there was a chance Sam might have come up with something else like this, Jen wanted to know about.<br />
<br />
Down in the yard, Jen had finally finished hopping the fences and found Sam in the last yard.  Sam was leaning against the fence, sweating heavily.  &quot;Oh, that felt amazing.  Who was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.  Alice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, she&#39;s great.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few moments of silence passed.  Back in the house, Jen was hurriedly going through Sam&#39;s browser history in hopes of figuring out what else Sam had picked.  There were a lot of really sexy and really bizarre pictures in her history, and any of them could be attached to Sam soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, uh, I guess I&#39;m your dickgirl now.&quot; Jen spoke to Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  I think you&#39;ll like it.  It&#39;s pretty fun.&quot; Sam&#39;s smile was genuine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means I&#39;m also... my own dickgirl...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam giggled, &quot;Oh that&#39;s gotta be awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah!  Actually, yeah, it kinda is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See?  I told you you&#39;d like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So this wasn&#39;t about revenge or anything like that?&quot;  Jen knelt down next to Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!  I love you like a sister.  Well, you are my sister.  But I&#39;m also your dickgirl, and now you&#39;re my dickgirl.  I just wanted us to be closer.  And with Sayler being part of us all of a sudden, I felt like we were losing that closeness.  I wanted to get us closer again.  In a way that really mattered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen smiled.  She no longer felt angry at Sam - she had come to dual realizations that what Sam had done was actually a blessing.  &quot;Oh, but the curse is still active.  You need to pick 2 more dickgirls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam grinned as she pulled out her phone.  &quot;Oh, I already did.  And the stipulation was I had to pick images.&quot;  Sam showed her phone to Jen.<br />
<br />
As Jen looked at the image in the phone, both of her hearts skipped a full beat, and she swore in unison both in the yard and in Sam&#39;s room, &quot;Shit...&quot;<br />
<br />
Another fleshy tube shot out of Sam and raced towards the house where the original Jen was standing in Sam&#39;s room, helpless to escape it...</p>
