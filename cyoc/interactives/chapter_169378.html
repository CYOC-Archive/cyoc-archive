<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Clair wasn&#39;t expecting that after one of her more violent tugs, a drop of some kind of white liquid would come out of her nipple. Wait am I fucking lactating! thought Clair, as her sudden discovery refreshed her hornyness, bringing along with it even more orgasms. Giving a few tugs had indeed created a few more drops, enough for her to bring one to her lips to taste. Sure enough, it was breast milk. Her breast milk! <br />
<br />
The shock caused her to lose her balance, and fall down again. A few seconds later, her mom knocked at her door to check if she was ok after hearing her fall. Her mom was one of the 20%, or the &quot;human shaped&quot; women, but both her aunt and grandmother were both HCRs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, is it normal to lactate?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What? I guess so, I mean it is how a mother feeds her newborn child after all. Why?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m lactating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you 100% for sure that it is breast milk, and not your cum?&quot; her Mom asked, in a much more serious tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sure, see&quot; Clair said as she gave her right nipple a tug, causing a few white beeds of milk to drip out of it. She didn&#39;t even realize that she had used her left foot to do it. She just did it, like it was natural for her to use her feet and not her hands. She had completely overlooked this detail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sweetie, it will be alright. It is a very normal thing to develop HCR. Most girls do even. They say that it is only a 1 and 5 chance to not you know. So don&#39;t you worry. If my sister or your grandma is anything to go by, it is by no means a sad thing to become an HCR.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean I am going to become an HCR?&quot; Clair asked, playing it off as being new news for her. Much to her mom&#39;s surprise, her daughter&#39;s tone of voice was one of absolute delight instead of the typical, though mistaken, depressed tone often paired with finding out that a girl will become an HCR.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you seem glad at least, so thats good. And to answer your first question properly, I guess in this case, its not that common to suddenly lactate, so I guess it isn&#39;t normal. But it isn&#39;t unheard of either. They say it is more common in girls with larger breasts though, so it may be considered normal that you would&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so?&quot; Clair replies as she hefts up her E-cups with her feet, feeling their size. Again, she didn&#39;t even notice how she has been using her feet as hands for a while now. Her real hands were planted firmly on the floor behind her back, proping up her body. While not enough to lift her off of the ground, it was enough to keep her sitting up straight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Clair, now you dont have to if you don&#39;t want to, but if you want, you should try twisting your leg completely around, as in 360°? My sister did it and said that it was very helpful durring her transformation week since it made her able to do a lot more prep work. According to the experts, you should twist until you feel a small pressure building in your hips, then once you feel that you have reached the maximum, kick out your leg hard to pop it out of the socket. Your legs should feel a bit funny by now, sort of like they are in a pool of warm jello. If so, it should be completely painless. But again, it is completely up to you. It is an optional process.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh sure, I could try it.&quot; Clair began doing what her mom told her, and sure enough, after a hard kick, her legs had freed themselves from her hip bone. It was very wierd, being able to move her legs in any way she wanted. Now that she was no longer restricted by her hip bone, she easily was able to not only reach both of her boobs without needing to stretch, but also could even bring up one of her nipples to her mouth with relative ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahemm&quot; coughed her Mom, reminding Clair that she was still there. Clair just let her nipple fall out of her mouth, feeling slightly awkward about forgetting her mom was literally right there. &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its fine. I know it will be hard to control the impulses, but at least for this week, please try and keep in mind the surroundings a bit. I also am happy to help you out if you ever needed some assistance too. I did it with my sister too, when she transformed, so I do know a thing or 2.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clair wasn&#39;t sure how she felt about having her mom help her masturbate. On one hand, she hated the idea. But a different part of her was actually mildly interested in what she possibly knew. This part obviously was a result of her begining her transformation. Apparently, becomming an HCR included a few natural mental adjustments. One of which was the complete removal of negative biases towards most people reguarding sex, and specifically, her own family members. To an HCR, cum is cum, no matter where it came from in terms of nutrition. The source only changed the quantity and taste. &quot;I&#39;m good for now, uh thanks though... maybe in a few days...&quot; she said, politely declining the offer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just let me know. Oh, I got you a little something incase you did become an HCR, come with me, I have it stored in my room&quot; said Claire&#39;s mom as she left for her own bedroom. Clair began making her way as well. Using her feet as best she could to support her body. However she mainly was holding her weight with her arms now, and just guiding them with her legs for balance. <br />
<br />
After awkwardly crab walking to her parent&#39;s bedroom, she found her Mom digging out a box from inside of her closet. &quot;Here we go, found it!&quot; She shouted, pulling out a large shoe box and setting it down in front of Clair.<br />
<br />
Using her feet, Clair lifted the lid and pulled out what looked like an oddly shaped pair of socks and a weird metal device. &quot;Neat, but uh, what exactly is it Mom?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well the socks go on your current hands, and this device will accuratly predict the minimum heel size you will now need.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire&#39;s mom helped slide the socks onto Clairs hands. The thin material was similar to sockings, but offered a lot more grip on the bottom. They went up her entire arm, almost reaching her shoulders. Their darkish material made her arms and hands look just like legs and feet if she kept her fingers together. The grips ran across her finger tips and her palms, easily giving her the grip she needed to not slip under her own weight. Plus they were very comfortable. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Clair, if you could raise up one of your arms, but keep your hand completely slack, do not put any stiffness into it at all and let it hang loose with your forearm pointed straight downwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clair gently set herself down onto her butt, which actually didn&#39;t quite feel as comfortable as it use to anymore. Raising up her right arm, she did as her mom instructed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, now slowly tilt back your forearm until your hand no longer is hanging loosely&quot; instructed her mom.<br />
<br />
Following her instructions, Clair slowly began tilting back her arm. Not even 10 seconds later, was her hand no longer loosely dangling, but locked up, no longer able to swing past a certain angle. Using the device her mother measured the angle limit of her hand. &quot;Huh, well that is a bit unfortunate, but I am sure you will manage. According to this, you will require almost a 6&quot; heel. That basically means you will be either wearing platforms or special ballet boots for the most part, and those can be rather expensive for quality pairs, as you already know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Indeed she did. Clair knew she had one of the most expensive hobbies she knew of (high heel shoes and boots collecting). Saddly, her new requirements have made most of her collection unusable. She would miss them, but also looked forward to all of the new pairs of fetish tier heels that she now &quot;had&quot; to have as a grin spread over her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, you and your high heel fetish are something else&quot; commented her mom, guessing correctly at her thoughts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really? Woman with a few drawers full of lockable nipple, navel, pussy, and clitoris rings, anal/vaginal plugs which vibrate remotely, lockable chastity belts, countless gags, arm and leg restraints, and a large suitcase filled entirely with iron, rope, and leather bondage gear. And that isn&#39;t even including what is inside of the large safe you hide in the crawl space.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you even know about the god damn safe! I mean... shit. Fine, we both can indulge a bit heavily into our fetishes. Apparently it is hereditary.&quot; Admitted her mother, somewhat embarrassed at just how much her daughter already knew about her BDSM fetish. &quot;Just keep the safe part between you and me ok. Please don&#39;t tell Sarah, ok. She wouldn&#39;t let me rest until I wore what is inside if she ever finds out. I don&#39;t think I could handle the embarrassment of wearing it again.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, I wont tell mom about it, as long as you buy me a cute pair of heels to celebrate my transformation into a HCR.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You little shit. I can&#39;t believe you are blackmailing your own mother into buying you another pair of high heels!&quot; Her Mom said, half jokingly, but also just a bit aroused. Her submissive nature kicked into gear at the threat of being exposed to her dominatrix wife, and had turned her on quite a bit. &quot;Fine, but I pick the style&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever as long as they have at least a 6&quot; heel&quot; added Clair. She usually joked around like this with her mothers. Having lesbian parents had definitely been different growing up. Sarah especially, being still her birth mother&#39;s girlfriend until ahe turned 11, had really set the tone for their family relationship. In other words, she was the one who first pushed her mother to live a more fetish filled lifestyle. The had keept it hidden the best they could until Clair turned 18. After that, it was like all of the curtains had been opened. Sarah no longer hid a thing from her. She even let her unknowingly play with the various remotes controlling her wife until she accidently forgot to gag her. Hearing her own mother moan in direct response to her actions was definitely a new experience for Clair, and not one she wanted to further explore any time soon. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I am getting a bit thirsty, but how am I supposed to drink now that I don&#39;t have hands and am too short to fill up a glass in ths sink?&quot; Asked Clair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. Maybe you could use the toilet to get water? No, no. That was just a bad joke. You always can just ask me you know. I am always here, just ask me at any time sweetie, and if Sarah has me currently locked up, I am sure that she will get you some. Its either that or drink your own milk.&quot;</p>
