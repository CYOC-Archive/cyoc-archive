<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake had heard his brother come home and waited until he heard the shower turn on. His bro had been real secretive about the trip he and Russ and Wayne had taken. He was fairly sure it involved girls and something of the “Gone Wild” variety, and was equally sure that Joe would never in a million years tell him what really happened. So Jake decided to find out for himself. <br />
<br />
Jake snuck into his brother’s room and gently picked up the phone on the nightstand. He knew his brother’s code and he was in. He immediately opened the photo album, looking for clues as to what happened at the Urstown weekend. <br />
<br />
He was shocked at what he saw- his brother’s phone must have been stolen or something. All there was was page after page of huge, hairy guys in every sexual position possible. Some were muscular like bodybuilders, some fat as everything. Some younger, in their late 20’s maybe and some were so old, all of their hair was grey. Every single one of them was huge, and every single one was coated in a thick pelt of fur. <br />
<br />
Jake scrolled back through the debauchery until he finally found a pic with his brother and two friends in a hotel room. This must have been where Joe left his phone. It was a pic of the three of them, shirtless, arms locked over each other’s shoulders, grinning madly at the camera. Jake looked closer and saw that each of them had what looked like a brown pill in one hand, flashing their “triumvirate” sign with the other. The “triumvirate” was a special hand sign, that the three of them had come up with when they were young kids, sort of a secret club thing. Somehow they’d kept it up into adulthood as a symbol of their deep friendship. <br />
<br />
Jake scanned to the next pic, and that’s where the bear men started. He figured Joe must have lost the phone some time between the pics. <br />
<br />
He looked closer at the pic. There were three of these beefy guys. They must have been staying in the same hotel as Joe, Jake noticed the decor of the hotel room was almost the same as Joe’s room. Looking closer, the three men were almost in the same pose as Joe and his friends. <br />
<br />
The one on the far left end was massive. Tons of muscle but not defined, like a powerlifter or strongman would be. He had the beard for it too. Covered from head to toe in a thick pelt of curly black hair, the forty-something year old had a thick stogie clenched in his teeth, smiling big around it. <br />
<br />
The guy in the middle was a pro bodybuilder for sure. He was off season, covered in hair that just made his muscles look that much bigger, but there was no mistaking the roid gut under all of that fur. His huge muscles were defined, and the blond pelt made the cuts look that much more impressive, giving him a cartoon outline appearance. He had a thick, close cut full beard, the same dark blond as the rest of his body. Jake looked at the posing strap he was wearing, and the roids must not have affected him there! The bulge was obscene, the posers has to have been custom- the guy was at least 10 inches soft. Jake hadn’t even seen porn stars that hung. <br />
<br />
Finally, the guy on the right, taking the place of his brother from the previous picture was an older guy who must have been in his fifties. He had to have been some retired bodybuilder, displaying the same impressive physique as his protege standing next to him, this muscular behemoth possessed an even larger set of equipment (if that was even possible) and was a slightly bigger version of the young bull. He was covered in a silver carpet, with a dense and impossibly thick beard. Instead of a posing suit, this salt and pepper display of masculinity wore a cup, that just didn’t quite contain the anaconda the guy possessed. <br />
<br />
Jake thought he could make out a glint of something in the dense forest of the man’s upper chest - maybe a necklace or something?  Jake skipped ahead a few pics to one with a close up of the silver haired gorilla. He was in a double bicep pose exposing pits so hairy you couldn’t tell where they ended and his chest hair began. The younger bodybuilder before was eagerly licking the guy’s left pit, disgusting Jake, but he saw there was a clear shot of the necklace. He zoomed in to the tight necklace, the pendant attached, just hanging over the man’s top pecs. The pendant was diamond shaped, with the initials ‘JEB’ inscribed. Jake couldn’t believe it. That was Joe’s necklace.  But how?? He didn’t understand. Picture after picture of this ‘gar smoking daddy with his brother’s necklace on. <br />
<br />
The guy was definitely a top, pictures abounded with him mounting some equally bearish counterpart, hair and muscle everywhere. In one scene, the original three were posing together in a semicircle, massive dicks erect and touching at the tips. The older one, labeled “Big Poppa” in a few of the pics, had the largest, uncut 12” long and thick around as a Coke bottle with a PA gloriously topping it off. Jake was gawking at the display of pure male sex when he noticed the hands of the three. They were flashing the triumvirate signs!<br />
<br />
It hit Jake like a ton of bricks.  Somehow, these gay bears were Joe, Russ, and Wayne, and judging by the salt and pepper “Poppa” his brother was the daddy of the bunch. But Joe wasn’t that old, or big, or gay. And he was circumcised, they both were. And how did all three of them become bears- It hit Jake. Ursa means ‘bear’. Urstown literally was a town of bears.</p>
