<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Elle turned back to her computer with the MasterPC installed on it. With her daughter successfully put in a 
trance and no longer an immediate problem, she began carefully considering her options. She decided to start 
with the most pressing issue first, namely that she still looked like her daughter, before retuning to the to 
the nagging issue of her daughter Allison. Elle decided she might as well take the direct route just to see if 
it worked, typing in:
<br />
<p>>>Elle will transform to look like she did this morning
<br />
<p>She ran her hands longingly over her youthful, fit stomach, and allowed herself to cup her firm breasts one 
last time before reluctantly hitting enter. She half-hoped she would be unsuccessful but alas, so sooner was 
it done than her stay in her daughter's body came to an abrupt end. Her body began aging rapidly, making fast 
progress on its journey from 16 back to 40. Her wrinkles returned and her body began to bloat and droop. Her 
stomach swelled out, her legs became shapeless and her breasts began to sag. But the worst injury was when her 
long flowing locks receded to her normal severe haircut. It was the most depressing thing Elle had ever had to 
watch. At least the first time she had only had to endure the slow gentle loss of her youth, rather than 
having it all ripped away in a flash. 
<br />
<p>Elle turned back to her daughter, not wanting to dwell any longer on her own depressing predicament. 
Instead she forced her self to move on to her daughter, standing there, motionless except for her heaving 
chest... her firm beautiful chest... as she stood on her long perfect legs. As she continued to look, her 
jealousy grew as she was forced to gaze from a distance at the body that moments ago had been hers. Finally it 
became too much to bear. Elle decided that on way or another she just had to have what her daughter had. The 
next few moments were spent in careful planning. Elle wanted to be young again, but at the same time, she 
found herself strangely hesitant to give up the life she had. Something about the finality of just deleting 
her life sacred her. Finally, she decided that if she was going to leave, someone was going to have to take 
her place until she got back. Alli seemed like the perfect candidate, and Elle quickly formed a list of 
commands in her head to that end. Typing in the first, she hit enter and watched as it took effect.
<br />
<p>>>Elle will transform to look like Allison and Allison will transform to look like Elle
<br />
<p>Elle enjoyed the sensations of firming and tightening across her body as it began its second regression of 
the day. Her stomach shrank, her breasts grew, and her hair became long and luxurious again. As she looked 
over at Alli, however, she found what she saw far less enjoyable. She watched as her daughter went through the 
exact same transformation she had, but from this time with she had a full view of the effects. Before her 
eyes, her daughter endured the ravages of time, her youth and beauty fading into that same worn appearance 
Elle had hated to she in the mirror every day. Guilt at what she'd just done seized her. She realized that it 
would be unfair to force this on her daughter, but at the same time she felt the pull of having a new life. 
She wavered back and forth, finally deciding she would not give up entirely on her plan, but she resolved that 
her stay as Alli would be brief, and as pleasant for both of them as possible. Entering in her next set of 
commands, she decided to add a time constraint to their switch.
<br />
<p>>>For the next 24 hours, Elle and Allison will assume each others identities. Allison will gain all of 
Elle's memories and lose all of hers for 24 hours, while Elle will gain only those memories of Allison's that 
she needs to successfully live Alli's life. At the end of the 24 hours, both Elle and Alli will lose the 
memories of each others lives and switch appearances again. Elle will remember her time as Alli, but Alli will 
not remember her time as Elle. No one will notice that the swap has occurred.
<br />
<p>Elle looked over the command carefully, editing it until she was sure that her careful choice of words 
would accomplish her goal. Finally she was satisfied and she pressed enter. Elle waited for any signs of 
change, but nothing happened. She still had all her memories, but none of Alli's memories had been added. Then 
she tried thinking about Alli's day at school, and the floodgates opened. A sudden surge of memories entered 
into her mind, all revolving around the various events of the day, until she stopped concentrating and the 
flow ceased. Good, her word choice had paid off. If she needed them she had access to her daughter's memories, 
but she didn't automatically get them all so the invasion of her daughter's privacy would be at a minimum. 
Looking at the clock, she noticed she had a half hour left before they would have company.
<br />
<p>Good, she still had a few things she wanted to try...</p>
