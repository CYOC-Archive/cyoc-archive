<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">BY THIS TIME, Joe was just heading downstairs when suddenly, he felt a sharp tingle. the tingle spread all over his body, from the top of his head to the tips of his fingers to the ends of his toes.<br />
<br />
“Chris, time for Dinner!&quot; called his mother, Wendy from downstairs. <br />
<br />
Chris turned off the computer monitor before heading downstairs.<br />
At dinner, he half listened to his parents make small talk about about his day as he ate his dinner.<br />
He was thinking about being a monster, and of how cool it would be.<br />
<br />
it was then Wendy noticed something strange about her husband&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey?&quot; Wendy said.<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Joe asked his wife.<br />
&quot;Is it me, or are your arms more muscular than before?&quot; Wendy asked.<br />
<br />
Joe looked at his arms and could not believe what he saw; His arms were a lot thicker than he could remember. Also the veins in his arms were clearly visible, pumping heavily with every heartbeat. Out of curiosity he flexed one of his arms a little, and to his surprise the biceps responded by growing into a decent peak. He whistled in surprise.<br />
<br />
He wanted nothing to do with exerting exercises or lifting heavy weights. He did however wanted, as all men, a more muscular body, but the only way to reach that is to exercise.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, Joe began to feel a gurgle in his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your ears!&quot; Wendy said suddenly, pointing.<br />
&quot;What about my-&quot; Joe stopped when he felt his ears - they had grown bigger, and pointed, looking more bat-like. <br />
<br />
HE GOT UP, AND RAN TO THE MIRROR. He gasped when he saw his pointed ears in his reflection.<br />
Then suddenly, he felt himself growing a third eye on his head.<br />
Joe almost screamed when he saw it.<br />
Wendy gasped. &quot;Honey?&quot; she said, alarmed. &quot;What&#39;s happening to you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe couldn&#39;t answer; he found that his stomach had started to ache.<br />
&quot;Ugh, I don&#39;t feel so good...&quot; he groaned.<br />
<br />
He staggered outside for some air; Wendy and Chris following him.<br />
Suddenly, he gave off an ominous purple glow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!&quot; Chris exclaimed. &quot;Your fingers! They&#39;re changing colour!&quot;<br />
Joe glanced at his fingers and gasped - they were turning purple!<br />
<br />
But it wasn&#39;t just his fingers - his hands, arms, and face began to turn purple too.<br />
Almost a second after that, he started to get bigger and more muscular, and his feet grew slightly bigger too, tearing off his shoes and socks in the process.<br />
<br />
Within seconds, the tf finishes. Joe had completely transformed into a monster. Joe got onto all fours, his head facing down. Chris felt his dad’s back rise and lower as he slowly got back his breathing rhythm.<br />
<br />
“Joe…Honey?!” his wife asked a bit nervously.<br />
<br />
Then his head started to move up. “Yes, dear…?” a baritone voice responded.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god! You’re OK!” Wendy yelled from excitement.<br />
<br />
“How are you feeling, dad?” Chris asked as he helped his monster father get up. He hooked his arms under his dad’s armpit and pulled him up. He couldn’t believe how large his upper arms and shoulders were now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh... head hurts... me not used to new size yet.&quot; he said, slurred in speech. Joe sat himself down on the lawn, and wriggled his mongo-sized toes.<br />
Chris felt his dad&#39;s toes. His smallest ones were about the size of a football, and the middle toes were as long as firewood logs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so handsome, even with 3 eyes!&quot; Wendy said.<br />
&quot;You look as strong as a giant!&quot; Chris said.<br />
All these comments made Joe cheer up. He was still sitting on the ground as he wasn’t completely used to his new physique. It felt heavy, yet light at the same time. He felt so strong that his body must be able to support his new size easily, but he had difficulties adjusting to his new strength.<br />
<br />
Joe should have been horrified by what had happened to him, but he liked it.<br />
In fact, He was now feeling strong enough, and confident enough of his new size, to stand up completely. He put down his hands as supports and pushed his entire body up. He shifted his legs and placed his feet flat on the ground, followed by stretching them completely. Slowly, but steadily, he rose higher and higher, until he towered over his wife and son by almost a foot. They looked up in awe.<br />
<br />
Joe used to be a pretty tall man, yet with a Regular Joe-type belly. But now, He had the body of a giant Greek god and looked like he possessed Herculean strength, despite the fact he had purple skin and three eyes. Yet, he was still the same old dad Chris grew up with.<br />
<br />
Wendy approached her husband. With her height she only reached his chest. “Oh honey, you look amazing!” Then she hugged him.</p>
