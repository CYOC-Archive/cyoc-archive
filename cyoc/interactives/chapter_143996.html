<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not much happened with the rest of the day. Regina chatted with Nami, Regina chatted with Dora, and everyone chatted with everyone about how hilarious all of the media was. Everyone was a fat woman, without exception. At first, the girls were all pointing and laughing, but quieted down as time went on.<br />
<br />
Even the video games had been modded, Regina eventually heard. Regina had never played a video game (only one girl in the group ever had,) so her frame of reference wasn&#39;t strong, but she was pretty sure--based on what her parents had told her--that Princess Peach was the character that you saved, not the character that you played as. Furthermore, she&#39;d seen Peach in a few old magazines, and she didn&#39;t remember her being over 100 pounds overweight. She was curious, since Peach is now not the one being kidnapped, what the end goal of the story was. Well unfortunately, none of them were good enough at video games to get very far.<br />
<br />
She similarly cocked an eye at the Tomb Raider game she pulled down from the shelf. Regina was positive she&#39;d heard of Laura Croft before, though had never seen what she looked like. However, she could infer that Croft&#39;s character graphic had been tampered with, because 80% of her body mass clipped through the walls! Most certainly, this character had originally been of modest proportions, and the levels been designed with that shape in mind.<br />
<br />
These old games hardly mattered, however, as the game catalog consisted 90% of newer games on newer consoles, which is all most girls in the group wanted to play. A couple of kids were playing a big JRPG, that involved a two-player party system, one working as the Feedee who conducts magic attacks, and the other a Feeder who manages physical attacks, and protects and cares for their Feedee. The two girls playing seemed to be getting more and more into it as the sun started to set.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
&quot;So you knew when you were going to be captured?&quot; Regina asked, leaning against the wall of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we heard the PA system loud and clear: Tunisias were gonna start patrolling the garbage plant at night, every night from then on.&quot; Dora answered, squinting and letting a little bit more out into the toilet bowl. &quot;We knew we were done for. We went for a last-ditch escape from the City, which only had a 0.1% chance of working, and unsurprisingly the 99.9% chance happened.&quot; She said, standing up, quickly wiping and flushing the toilet.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s really sad. But I guess I was in the same situation. We saw the Tunisias patrolling the woods two nights before. We knew they would find us, but we didn&#39;t have anywhere else to go...&quot; Regina said as Dora walked out of the stall.<br />
<br />
Regina stared at Dora.<br />
&quot;Hey Dora, how much did you wipe?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, a little bit.&quot; Dora answered, awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should be more thorough about it.&quot; Regina said. &quot;It sounded like you only used a few squares.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to waste... any...&quot; Dora began to reply, but stopped herself, reminding herself that she doesn&#39;t have to scrimp and save every ounce of every resource anymore. &quot;...okay fine.&quot; She said, popping back into the stall and lifting her dress up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t forget to wash your hands with plenty of soap, too!&quot; Regina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay, I will...&quot; Dora replied as she folded out a copious line of toilet paper for herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dinner time!&quot; Was heard from outside the bathroom. It would appear that Mrs. Joseph had come in and called everyone in for another meal.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
This time, a luxurious steak dinner was on offer. Very thin, tender red meat, topped with white cheddar and caramelized shrimp. Mashed potatoes and gravy were in abundance. There was also stuffing, turkey and chicken. The desert was almost endless ice cream with gallons and gallons of hot fudge.<br />
<br />
The &quot;skinny Bennies&quot; huddled around the tiny, meager tray of healthy offerings once again. This time, it was just a bowl of peas and green beans. And water again. Oh, and you could put some salt on the peas. That was it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a second...&quot; Paula said. &quot;We can just go over to the rest of the tables, and put a small amount of the other stuff on here, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone looked at each other and smiled at the simple realization.<br />
<br />
A minute later, the &quot;healthy&quot; girls were sat at the same table as last time. Their meals consisted primarily of the peas and green beans, but they had served up a light quantity of beef and chicken as well. Most of them put a tiny, bitty bit of potatoes and gravy on as well. Most importantly, they avoided the soda, and then avoided the ice cream.<br />
<br />
Nami pointed out to the rest of the little club, that a number of people were bolting for the cafeteria bathroom halfway through their meals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s obviously what&#39;s gonna happen if you eat like that all day.&quot; Regina commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Robyn and I were in the bathroom earlier, and I was done in a few minutes but she had to like, shit her brains out.&quot; Paula giggled, feeling at liberty to mention that as everyone in the healthy section had already finished their bowls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh definitely. I was in the bathroom with a girl in my group too, and she took so long. And I had to send her back in to wipe better. I don&#39;t know why they&#39;re surprised by this. These meals are practically designed to wreak havoc on your digestive system.&quot; Regina said.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Despite how much ice cream Regina saw the members of her group horking down in the cafeteria, she watched as they continued to snack on Hot Pockets and Oreos all night. Pretty astonishing. The &quot;healthy kids club&quot; over in the cafeteria consisted of exactly seven people, meaning only seven out of 80 were resisting the carbohydrate temptations. Nami and Regina were the only two in their group who belonged to this &quot;club,&quot; and so felt a little left out as the tables became flooded with snacks and bags. Not only the tables, in fact, but the floors became sprinkled in a few cracked chips and spilled sodas here and there. Nami and Regina retreated to their bedroom for the night. Regina had taken a few of the books in there, electing to finally get Pride and Prejudice off her backlog, even if Elizabeth is constantly describing the food she&#39;s eating in this version.</p>
