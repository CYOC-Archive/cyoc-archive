<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex walked into his science classroom where his science teacher, Ms. Areth, was sitting, her desk was twice the size of the pupils’ and she needed it for her expanded assets. Alex and his class were in their 4th year at Hutriurm High School, it had been nearly two months since a student in the year above ‘expanded’ it apparently happened to a guy who was in a History lesson. There were around 30 to 40 students in each class, in the highest year was 1 away from where Alex was. Enhanced Puberty usually spiked in students around this year and in Alex’s school, 19 pupils out of the 37 that were there had experienced it. But it still wasn’t unheard of in lower years. The lowest recorded was two years below Alex when a 13 year old girl suddenly ‘bloomed’ unexpectedly. Students are (in most schools) only taught about Enhanced Puberty when they’re 14. The 13 year old was in Japan around 8 years ago.<br />
<br />
They all sat down, Alex sat next to Suzy as he usually did and listened to his teacher while he also admired her large assets, two seats in front of him was Bob. He was a nice person and Alex seemed to get along well with him but he usually didn’t hang out with him. On the left of Alex (Suzy was on his right) was Indigo, he’d spoken to her maybe 6 or seven times but never had a full on conversation with her.<br />
<br />
Nearly half an hour into the lesson. Alex was talking to Suzy about a task that had been set and they had only half completed it in the 5 minutes they had had for it. New to Alex, Bob tapped his shoulder, Alex turned to him. Bob was a 5 foot 5 boy who had a small frame, a skinny body, girly voice and pretty much small in all areas apart. His hair was a curly black-ish colour one, more of a very dark brown. Bob looked at him weakly and said, “Excuse me, I feel kinda ill, what should I do??”<br />
“Uhm, why are you asking me, I have no clue what to-“<br />
“Sorry about him,” said Suzy interrupting me, “What’s the problem??”<br />
“I feel kinda out of it and tired, even though I felt absolutely fine about 2 minutes ago,”<br />
“Oh, so you suddenly feel ill, well, we can tell Ms. Are..” Suzy stopped and looked somewhat surprised at something.<br />
Alex looked to where her eyes were going and they were pointed at Bob’s groin. Alex only glanced at it for a brief moment trying to don&#39;t be rude and noticed that it looked somewhat bigger, he looked again and he defiantly noticed it. “What’s wrong??” Asked Bob,<br />
“Uhm.. look down a bit..” said Suzy,<br />
“Oh my god!!” Said Bob somewhat quiet, only a few heard, “I’m getting bigger!!”<br />
<br />
Still on his stool, Bob looked down and saw unfamiliar lumps expanding on his groin. They grew monstrously huge before anyone else noticed, they pushed tightly against his skimmy jeans, which wasn&#39;t meant for hiding them. He looked back at Suzy in horror and saw her smaller than before. He was confused and tried to look at someone else but everyone seemed smaller as well. He realized he was getting taller. He tried to breathe in but had trouble because his lungs were expanding along with his muscles, they grew bigger and bigger until his muscle mass has tripled. He looked and saw his chest had nearly doubled since the last time he looked it, having two giant pecs still growing. His butt pushed against the stool he was on, it grew bigger and bigger as it seeped over the sides of the stool. His feet grew wider and longer until they were four times their former size and a bit more, his thighs grew bigger too to match them. By this point the entire class was looking, he really couldn’t hide any of it. Messy hair grew everywhere until he looked like a sasquatch. His biceps grew to the size of his head and then bigger than the size of Alex’s head (which was quite a lot larger than his). His hands and back grew to match until he looked like a pro bodybuilder, his neck thickened nearly twice the size of his head and his thighs were twice the size they were before. The last thing that changed was his face, his jaw got squarier and a short beard appeared on it along with thicker eyebrows and a bigger nose. He was nearly off his chair, breathing heavily when Ms. Areth ran over.<br />
<br />
She stayed next to Bob and said to him, “Well, congratulations on being the first to ‘Enhance’ out of your class, you’re around the right age and time but granted you are early. I know this can and has been awkward but, and I’m talking to the whole class now. You’ll all experience this, so making fun of him would only really show signs of jealousy.” She looked at Bob and smiled, “I’ll go get you a seat and that will be the end of it,”<br />
“But I’ve already got a seat,” Bob said in a deep booming voice that astounded everybody,<br />
“You’ll get used to that part,” referencing his voice, as she grabbed a larger stool from the cupboard for Bob to sit on. She placed it in her seating place and then removed her previous stool. Bob sat down and was more comfortable but still hated that nearly everyones eyes were on him.<br />
<br />
At the end of the lesson, Bob was told to stay behind. He was given some new fitting clothes and was sent home early.<br />
<br />
“Wow, that was interesting,” said Suzy,<br />
“Yeah, Jesus Christ that was weird, especially for him,” said Alex,<br />
“I bet you can’t wait for me to be ‘Enhanced’.. “ said Suzy, jokingly seductively,<br />
“Yeah, well I bet you can’t wait for me to either,” said Alex, trying to hide that he actually couldn’t wait for that,<br />
“Yeah you’re right,” this surprised Alex as he didn’t expect a direct response, “I’m probably quite a bit more excited than you are for me to do it,”<br />
“Hah, well I’m going to walk home, wanna come??”<br />
“Yeah sure, my Mom might not be home yet so you come round mine for a bit,”<br />
“I’ll think about it on the way.”</p>
