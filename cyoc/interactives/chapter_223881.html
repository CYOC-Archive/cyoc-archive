<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After heading out the gate and closing it behind him, Dan, standing upright, turns and looks up and down the dark alleyway. The naked teen sniff the air, ‘the smell is coming from further down the alleyway,’ he thinks to himself, squinting as he looks down the alleyway, trying to see what could be causing the smell. Dan doesn’t notice as his ears become bigger and pointier as they start to move up the side of his head, he also doesn’t notice his nose taking on a more leathery texture as it turns black and moist, his hearing and sense of smell increasing even more.<br />
<br />
As he stands there, staring into the pitch blackness, the transforming boy’s ears twitch when he picks up sounds coming from the same direction of the smell. The smell itself causes the boy’s cock, which is already at full mast, twitch and seem to harden even more, something about the smell is turning him on, and Dan wants to know why, so he decides to keep following the scent and starts to walk down the alleyway.<br />
<br />
Walking down the alleyway, further and further away from his home, Dan is unaware that his own scent, his own pheromones are changing, his human DNA slowly been overwritten by dog DNA, causing his human pheromones and scent to be replaced by that of an average and normal dog. The hair on the teen’s body lengthens and changes colour, starting to take on the colouring and length of an Malinois Belgian Shepherd, he doesn’t notice as his jaw start to push forward and his teeth become pointy, while his tongue flattens and becomes longer.<br />
<br />
The closer Dan gets to the smell, the teen’s body starts to feel warm, and it is getting harder to think. Dan even starts to pant, his long tongue plopping from his small muzzle, which continues to grow, but Dan is to focused on the scent, that he doesn’t notice the changes. He doesn’t notice his tail bone grow, pushing against his skin right above his butt, a tiny nub appearing, which seems to be moving slightly as if… wagging.<br />
<br />
Dan reaches a part of the alleyway that branches off to the left into a much darker alleyway, the transforming teen stops as he notices that the smell is coming from within that area, and he can hear something scuffling around, he then hears something that sounds like panting and whining, ‘dogs,’ he thinks to himself, and without thinking he turns and starts to head into the darkness.<br />
<br />
The transforming teen is halfway into the alleyway, when he notices movement nearby, Dan stops and when his eyes get used to the darkness, he realizes that he has stumbled upon a pack of stray dogs. As Dan stands there and continues to inhale the scent, he doesn’t notice as his mind slowly changes as the knowledge and instincts of a dog start to mix with his human mind. The more Dan inhales the scent, the clearer of what it is he is smelling becomes, ‘there is a female in heat here,’ he thinks to himself, the thought should normally terrify Dan, especially since his body seems to be reacting to the scent in a certain way, but instead the teen just continues to stand there. Dan looks around the dark alleyway, his eyes now adjusted to the darkness, he can tell that there are five dogs, three females and two males, one of the females is lying on the ground while the others seem to play with each other.<br />
<br />
Dan sniffs the air, trying to figure out which of the dogs is in heat, the teen does not notice that he isn’t acting like himself, all he can think of is wanting to find that female, to solve his problem. The boy does not notice as the skin of his cock seems to melt against his tummy, by now his whole body is covered in a nice black and beige pelt, only his hands and feet resemble human, the nub just above his butt has grown longer and already resembles a small tail. The tip of his cock becomes bigger and changes shape, soon Dan is sporting a big canine cock, which is throbbing painfully.<br />
<br />
The teen lets out a whimper of frustration, which captures the pack’s attention, they stop playing and turn to face him, even the female who is curled up on the ground. The dogs growl and take up defensive positions, the fur on their backs standing up at the sight of the strange creature.<br />
<br />
‘Dogs… fear me,’ he thinks to himself, not noticing how simple his thinking has become, ‘must… make them trust me. I’m no threat…!’<br />
<br />
Dan slowly crouches down, he then lies down on the ground, on his back, exposing his belly, seeing this, the dogs slowly and cautiously walk up to Dan and sniff at him, Dan relaxes and lets the dogs check him out.<br />
<br />
The dogs sniff all over Dan’s body, including his new genitals, Dan pants and wags his small tail, which by now is half it’s original length, and Dan is still oblivious to what has happened to him as he lies there, letting the animals investigate him. Soon the dogs relax as they recognize Dan’s scent as “dog”, their tails start to wag and soon they bark at Dan in a playful manor, nudging Dan with their snouts, inviting him to play with them.<br />
<br />
One part of Dan would love to play, but the other part of Dan would love to first get the “issue” sorted out, seeming to sense Dan’s desire, the female, who was lying on the ground earlier and who kept her distance, slowly approaches, the other dogs, realizing that Dan seems to be more focused on something else, simply turn and scurry off, leaving Dan alone with the female.<br />
<br />
Dan and the female look at each other for a while, the female then approaches Dan and sniffs at his erect canine cock. The half-human-half-dog boy starts to pant, his long tongue flopping out his muzzle which finished forming, Dan suddenly lets out a surprised yelp, when he looks he sees the female licking him.<br />
<br />
Dan feels an explosion of pleasure shoot through his body and he starts to pant even more, after a few licks, the female stops, causing Dan to let out a whimper, but when he looks he notices that the female has turned, her butt facing Dan, her tail raised and moved to the side, presenting herself to him, inviting him to mount her.</p>
