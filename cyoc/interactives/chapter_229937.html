<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Colin thinks for a moment--he&#39;d like the opportunity to talk to Bobby and maybe ask why he made the wish in the first place, but if the wish granting app ran on &quot;Monkey&#39;s Paw&quot; interpretation of wishes, then Colin would have to be careful how he worded his wish. After a few minutes Colin entered:<br />
<br />
I wish that Bobby and I would average our ages out and become twin brothers, with complete memories of everything that&#39;s happened since the wish granting app was downloaded onto this phone and before in the original reality.<br />
<br />
Colin pressed enter, and watched as the countdown steadily dropped to zero.<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, did you miss a call or not?&quot; asked Amanda as she entered the room just as the white flash blinded the room from the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; asked Amanda--shocked.<br />
<br />
Colin clutched his head, which he felt a slight twinge as his infantile 10 month old memories became clearer for him alongside his current reality&#39;s memories.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just a job app starting up, nothing to worry about,&quot; said Colin while trying to portray a calm self-assured poise to convince Amanda that what he was saying wasn&#39;t a lie, at least not entirely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, any offers?&quot; asked Amanda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me look... nope, not today,&quot; said Colin miming scrolling through his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry Col... don&#39;t worry I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find something soon,&quot; said Amanda reassuringly, and then giving him a hug--which Colin found rather soothing.<br />
<br />
All this while, Colin had been loosing years and some of his physique. He no longer looked like a 32 year old father anymore, but instead had crossed back into his twenties, having lost about six years, and still going.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you might want to go get ready for the gym--you&#39;re getting a little soft,&quot; teased Amanda, because in this quickly dissipating reality Colin was something of a gym rat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I&#39;ll go get changed,&quot; said Colin, hoping to take the opportunity to get to somewhere private for the remainder of the transformation--where he could see what was happening to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ll go check on Bobby,&quot; said Amanda<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do that before I get ready to go,&quot; said Colin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; asked Amanda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Positive! Go put your feet up. You&#39;ve just got home, I&#39;m sure you could do with a bit of a rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could. Thank you,&quot; and with a brief kiss on the cheek, Amanda departed the room and Colin headed for the nursery where Bobby was.<br />
<br />
Bobby luckily was asleep, and was just now in danger of outgrowing the crib. Colin reached down and with some heft, picked the growing little boy up and laid the seven year old straining the diaper he was in on the ground. Luckily he did as Bobby seemed to hit a little growth spurt which would have destroyed the crib had he remained in it a moment longer as it seemed Bobby was quickly approaching double digits for his age. Colin took a moment to appreciate how much Bobby looked like he had as a kid--or rather, how much they looked alike. Luckily in the nursery was a full mirror for Colin to see himself.<br />
<br />
Colin&#39;s adult clothes were slack on him, as the clearly college-aged young adult looked back at him from the mirror. He took off his baggy shirt to watch as his six pack faded into a four pack, and then hardly anything at all, and his pecs shrank. He was losing muscle mass fast as he was retreating from his twenties. A moment later, his sweat pants fell and Colin stared at the fresh faced college freshman or high school graduate standing there with nothing but a pair of baggy boxers on, held up by a quite powerful erection he&#39;d felt coming on slowly throughout the entire process.<br />
<br />
Colin&#39;s attention was brought back to Bobby when a deepening groan was heard from behind him. Colin turned around to see an early teenaged version of himself laying on the ground with a burst open diaper shredded to pieces around Bobby&#39;s growing penis and balls. Hair was just beginning to appear on the very lanky body, starting at his ankles and then growing up his legs and straight to his crotch. Another groan accompanied Bobby&#39;s penis&#39; growth, causing the tool to rise and grow erect itself. Bobby was now clearly fifteen, and the changes were slowing down as he was approaching the averaging out age. Bobby&#39;s feet grew, a bit of lean &quot;runner&#39;s&quot; muscle began to appear on Bobby&#39;s frame, but just enough to not make him look like a scarecrow.<br />
<br />
As for Colin&#39;s own transformation, he turned back to the mirror to see that he&#39;d clearly returned to high school himself--looking more a Junior than the Senior he&#39;d been a few moments ago. His muscles had likewise gotten thinner, his body hair had grown a bit more sparse, though not disappearing completely, and his erection&#39;s horniness was growing stronger within him by the moment, until he couldn&#39;t help himself but shove his baggy boxers to the floor and stroke himself furiously until he climaxed all over the mirror.<br />
<br />
And then Colin felt like he shrank a few inches while Bobby grew a few, and the two &quot;boys&quot; evened out at 16 years and five months old twins. And it seemed that either the wish app had interpreted &quot;twins&quot; as being identical instead of fraternal, or they were really just that much alike that Colin could barely tell any difference between Bobby and him. Colin felt a bit of pressure in his head for a moment as reality altered and the nursery room grew blurry until a minute later, he was standing in a teenager&#39;s room-- boxers still at his feet, though noticeably smaller and more &quot;teen&quot; looking than before, and the mirror covered in cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gross, did you have to come all over the mirror?&quot; asked a voice from behind Colin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not like you have much room to complain, given your actions earlier,&quot; retorted Colin automatically as though he were used to quipping with his brother since birth. Colin grabbed a dirty sock off the floor, wiped himself off, and then pulled up his boxers, which sat on his body snugly before turning around to see Bobby now sitting up and on the floor, with a blanket from the bunk bed that the crib had transformed into over his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right, I don&#39;t... I take it since I remember things and am not a baby that you found the wish granting app?&quot; asked Bobby.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be correct, little brother,&quot; said Colin as he sat down next to Bobby, instinctively knowing that in this new reality, Colin was the older of the two twins, by a mere matter of minutes that he held over Bobby&#39;s head every chance he got. It was weird, Colin could remember all three realities, but it was feeling rather easy to slide into the habits and thoughts of this one while he was living it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just call me Bob--I&#39;ve yo-yo&#39;ed so much from being a dad to a son to a brother, that I think all my mind can handle right now is first names, okay Colin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, dad,&quot; teased Colin. It was feeling really natural<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m serious,&quot; protested Bob.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, it&#39;s just hard to fight going with the flow of this... reality, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, why are we twins?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I have a few questions for you, Bob. And I needed us both capable of understanding them to get them answered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, fire away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;d you not want to take care of me?&quot; asked Colin, dead serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t want to take care of you, I just was getting distracted looking for work with you needing constant attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True, you weren&#39;t any easier as a ten month old for me and my job search.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I also was slowly loosing my memories and throwing a tantrum about trying to keep them and slowly forgetting what I was trying to remember and getting scared because I was forgetting. I think you can give me a pass if I was a bit of a pain as an infant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair. No more wishes about each other?&quot; asked Colin, putting his hand out.<br />
<br />
&quot;After we return things back to how they were,&quot; said <br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno, I&#39;m really liking this reality--and it&#39;s kinda cool to have a sibling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were always going to get siblings, I just needed to find a job and we&#39;d save up some money first for... childcare and stuff, maybe get you into Kindergarten first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but that&#39;d take for forever, and there&#39;d be an age gap... and I&#39;m rather like being a twin.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that Colin surprised Bob by lunging at him, wrestling him until he was in a headlock and started playfully giving Bob a noogie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get off me!&quot; objected Bob as he squirmed but couldn&#39;t find it in himself to get out of Colin&#39;s grasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until you admit you like being twins too!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Never!&quot; protested Bob, half-jokingly as memories of rough housing with Colin growing up began to feel more real to him in that instant.<br />
<br />
Just then a knock was heard at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Col, Bobby? Is everything all right in there? I heard loud thumps and bumps,&quot; called out Amanda&#39;s voice, freezing both Colin and Bob in place as the door opened.</p>
