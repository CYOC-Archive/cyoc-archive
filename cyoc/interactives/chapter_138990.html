<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The content feeling leaving her, Bets stared down down at the long, thin, light, reddish penis. Alarmed by what she was seeing, she snorted and tried to brush away, but only managed to rub her hand against it, causing it to stir. Grunting, liking the feel of her hand touching it, images of does coming to mind and mixed with other lewd images as she breathed in the pheromone air, she fought against the images and leaping up, began quickly gathering up her clothing.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to believe that she actually had a penis and a set of testicles, Bets tried to ignore them, but found it difficult when they brushed against her legs and, as she pulled on her skirt, she found the penis extended down past the hemline of her skirt. Trying to pull the garment down so that the tip of the penis was hidden, as she found it embarrassing and didn&#39;t like the idea of someone seeing that she had something she wasn&#39;t supposed to have, she grimaced when the soft cotton of her skirt brushed against the tip of the organ and she felt once more a stirring. Grunting, terrified by the idea of what might happen if she got horny again, she stopped and instead began lacing up her top, and nearly screamed in horror when she discovered that, at some point, her breasts had regressed completely and that she was now completely flat chested. Snorting, disturbed by all that had happened, she stuffed her top into the pocket of her jacket, took it out and at thinking about it, put it back on. Certain she looked ridiculous wearing the clothes she had on, she tried to ignore the eleven inch flaccid penis dangling down past where her skirt stopped, the sensation of how nice it felt as the soft cotton to brushing against it, and how it and the scrotum felt pressed against her legs, Bets reached for and unzipped the flap of the tent.<br />
<br />
After making sure there was nobody about, she crawled out, tried to stand and immediately collapsed to the floor. Cursing, thinking that her legs and feet might have gone to sleep, the sixteen-year-old girl tried again and instantly fell back to the floor. Scared, unable to fathom why she could stand, she stared down at her feet, sure the problem somehow was with them. Spotting a nearby shelf, she grunted and reached out an arm as far as she could, she began to slowly craw across the floor.<br />
<br />
When she finally was close enough the shelving unit, she grabbed the nearest shelf and with trembling arms began to pull herself up. Standing, the purchase she had doing most of the work to hold her up, Bets adjusted her feet, trying to find out why they longer supported her. Accidentally discovering she could stand if she remained balanced on the balls of her feet, she snorted in disbelief, tried to put one foot flat and nearly fell to the floor once again. Hissing, &quot;What the hell,&quot; she peered down at her bare feet and unable to fathom why she could only stand the way she was, she took a wobbly step, grabbed the shelf for balance and using it for support, she practiced for a moment walking.<br />
<br />
Gradually getting the hang of walking in what she thought was a silly manner, the sixteen-year-old girl grunted as she let go of the shelving unit. Confident she wasn&#39;t going to collapse again, she snorted and looked about. Spotting the tent, she nimbly traipsed over to it and collected from within the bag she&#39;d blown her wad into. Not wanting to leave to much evidence lying about, she turned and started for the front of the store, but stopped. Thoughts about how absurd she surely looked coming to her, all to aware of the eleven inch member hanging down past the hem of her skirt, Bets snorted and decided that, if she was going to leave, &quot;And hopefully avoid running into anyone,&quot; she&#39;d be better of sneaking out the back. Turning, she listened for the sound of anyone else in the store before gracefully heading for the back of the store, positive there was a back way.<br />
<br />
As she went, she felt a slight pinching sensation in her feet. Chalking it up to having to move about on the balls of her feet, Bets ignored it as best as she could. Believing it would dissipate as soon as she grew accustomed to standing and walking the way she was, the sixteen-year-old girl was unaware of how her feet were slowly morphing. Toes hardening, fusing together and turning black, her leg slimmed and shifted to accommodate the growth of her hooves. Within moments, Bets feet no longer resembled something normal for a human, but had become a two even-toed ungulates.<br />
<br />
Her balance shifting as something pressed painfully into her tailbone, Bets snorted after a moment and grunted out, &quot;Now what,&quot; missing completely the clicking noise of her hooves striking the hard floor. Reaching back, she patted the back of her skirt and feeling something, she started pulling first down, then up on the garment. Finally managing to get it to slide up a couple inches, she sighed with relief.<br />
<br />
Disturbed by what had happened, she groused for a moment, trying to see what it had been that had been causing her such pain. Unable to see anything, knowing she&#39;d have to remove her skirt, Bets snorted and figured it was something that could wait. Starting to hurry, missing as her tailbone lengthened and fur began to sprout around the newly formed tail, as well as her her hooves and ankles, Bets sighed in relief that her feet were no longer causing her problems. Coming to the back of the store, it didn&#39;t take her long to locate a set of double doors leading into the store room and pushing her way through, she glanced warily around. Spotting the store owner, Mr Tomay, she froze and waited for him to turn in her direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no way he could have heard me,&quot; Bets thought after a moment and torn between fleeing and finding out why he remained slumped in a chair, she eventually sniffed the air and crept closer.<br />
<br />
Upon coming within a couple feet, it became clear to her why Mr Tomay hadn&#39;t stirred. Seeing the pale look of his face and, when looking closer, discovering the blue tinge to his lips and the contorted look on his face, she concluded the old man must have died of a heart attack or something. Forgetting for the moment her own problems, she wondered what she should do and spotting a nearby phone mounted to the wall, she trotted over to  it, lifted off the cradle the receiver up, punched into the keypad the three numbers for emergency and dropped the receiver. Hearing the dispatch operator coming on the line, she nimbly stepped away, trying to make as little noise as she could. Spotting a door she thought surely led out into the alley behind the store, she glanced once more at the store owner before heading toward the door.<br />
<br />
Outside in the alley, breathing deeply, listening as the heavy door clicked shut, it suddenly came to Bets that she&#39;d forgotten her purse and her shoes inside the tent. Turning to go back to get them, she found the door didn&#39;t have a handle on the outside of the door. Distraught, she leaned against the warm metal door and wondered if she should even bother going around to the front to sneak back in. After a bit, the sixteen-year-old girl decided it wasn&#39;t worth adding to her already growing problems and turning, she glanced up and down the alleyway. Deciding she wanted to try and sneak home, she snorted and started in the direction of her house, stopping a couple stores down to throw the bag into a dumpster, completely oblivious to how her ears had started to grow in size and take on a more round shape as they began to stick out from the side of her head.</p>
