<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the new brother finished, Carl had to wait. If he just called his brothers, they would either ignore him or make fun of him, but not come here. But as their room was next to his own, they would need to move by his door, and then he could speak to them, getting them inside his room, and change them.<br />
In the meantime, Carl put his clothes back on, before he used the chronivac to tap into both their heads, getting the memories he would need for the new brother to look through. And with the program, it was easy to work on them. First, he blended both sides together, creating only one set of memories. Said set already cleared out duplicated memories, some from Rick and some from Leon.<br />
Second, Carl edited every mention of either of their names with his new one, which would be Oliver. Carl thought it fitting, as it was started with the letter just middle to their ones. It also had mostly letters from their old names, as beside the v each was from them.<br />
Lastly, another important edit was their behavior towards Carl. The chronivac filtered all memories of them being mean to him, and changed them to either good ones, or erasing them. Oliver wouldn´t remember any situation he angered Carl. Instead, Carl made him look up to him, the younger brother, even so that Oliver would help and serve Carl.<br />
Just as he was finished looking through smaller memories and initiating their transfer towards Oliver, Rick and Leon came up the stairs towards their rooms. With a grin, Carl called them in as they moved by his door.<br />
“What do you want, twerp?” Rick asked annoyed. He was in no mood for his younger brother right now.<br />
“Calm down, Rick. Sorry, little Carl, the last ball I have thrown hit him on the head, Ricky is sporting a headache right now.” Leon said, sounding nothing like the apology was earnest. Adding to that was the repetition of Rick´s twerp comment by calling him little.<br />
Carl still grinned at them as he started their changes without turning towards his computer. “I just wanted you to come in here. After all, I didn´t want to search for you later.”<br />
Confused by that, both Rick and Leon look at each other, talking on a mental level only twins and inseparable friends would understand. “And why would you need to search us later?” Leon asked then.<br />
Without them realizing, both Rick and Leon slowly walked further into the room and nearer to Carl. “Oh, you know, I wanted to go to the park later? It wouldn´t do if I can´t go because I needed to search for my shoes.” Carl explained.<br />
Now both twins looked even more confused. “And why would you need to search your shoes? We didn´t have hidden them or something like that, twerp.” Rick said, angry that Carl would accuse them of such. Yes, they had often fun on the expense of their little brother, but not something like that?<br />
Carl laughed at that. “That wasn´t what I meant. I meant I would need to search for you two, my new shoes, for when I want to leave the house. Are you really that dumb?”<br />
“Okay? What have you taken to see us as your shoes?” asked Leon, a bit scared by his brother. He chuckled a bit after that, thinking of it as a weird joke. Rick nodded in agreement towards Leon.<br />
By now, the twins stood just before Carl, who still grinned at them. “Oh, I haven´t taken anything. Just stating facts. Now, ready for my feet to enter your mouths?” Carl said, his grin taking a turn to look rather evil.<br />
Before either Rick or Leon could say something, they already dropped to their knees and let their mouths hang open wide. Unable to talk like that, only unintelligent noises left them at first. That turned into a mix of gagging and screaming as Carl, without any hesitation, stuffed his left foot onto Leon´s mouth, followed by doing the same with his right foot in Rick´s mouth.<br />
“Don´t worry, it won´t take long.” Carl said as they both looked disgusted by his wiggling, sock-clad feet in their mouths, and horrified as they realized they could do nothing against that.<br />
Slowly, at least to them, Carl´s feet inside their mouths pushed them down, until their backs rested upon their legs and the ground. With his desk chair, Carl rolled around his brothers, until his feet pointed towards their bodies. He could already see their changes happening. Their arms thinned out while growing longer, at least in relation to their shrinking bodies. At the same time, their legs merged both together as well as with each other, their knees building the toe-cap. Their own feet merged into their asses without resistance, before the whole of their backs and the underside of their merged legs became harder, forming a sole for the shoe.<br />
With wide, horrified gaze turned up to Carl, they could only feel their bodies changing. Their torso ripped open, forming holes along the newly created opening. Their arms, by now at least half a meter long each, slipped down their bodies with their shoulders connecting them still, until they rested just below their cocks. Said cocks grew longer along their body, until they would have been able to suck them themselves, reaching up to their mouths. Now their arms, still held in place by their shoulders, wound up through the holes in their torso, each time over their cock, pressing it more and more firmly into their open torso.<br />
By now Carl´s feet had slipped down their vanishing throats, deeper and deeper into their bodies, until he hit their former knees from the inside, filling them out completely. Their cocks now firmly pressed on top of Carl´s feet, held in place by their arms turned shoelaces, which had knotted themselves under their former chins. Their former hands, now the end of said laces, wrapped into a neat bow on top of that.<br />
The last to change form was their heads. Slowly, they closed in from all sides, eyes, ears, nose and hair vanishing, leaving only their wide-open mouths, the entrance to their new shoe-bodies, still stuffed by Carl´s feet. A last, heavy shudder went through their bodies, turning their skin into either hard leather for their soles, or a softer leather for the upper side. Their former kneecaps had turned into a hard shell, protecting Carl´s toes from heavy hits. Their now shoelace-arms become cloth instead.<br />
With the shudder they also changed their coloration. Their soles turned grey, as did most of the other leather of their skin, only slightly lighter. The shoelaces turned white, along with their former lips, now the upper end. On both sides of Carl´s ankles, a little, dark blue star showed up, the only other color to their new bodies.<br />
Grinning down at his new shoes, Carl said: “You are comfy. Perfect for my feet. Remember all the times you used me like a doormat? Now I can return that to you, but in a more realistic way. Hahaha”<br />
Both Rick and Leon were in panic. They couldn´t move in any way, trapped around their little brother´s feet. What now?”<br />
But Carl already started the last thing he needed for them. Without any warning to them, their embroidering started, stitching either “Rick” or “Leon” on the underside of their former cocks in red thread, now the shoes tongue. Followed by the needed “Owned by Carl Turner” in white thread beneath their names. They both howled in pain for that, as they suddenly could hear each other again. There was also a connection towards their newly created brother Oliver, not that they realized that in that moment. Unlike Jeff, Sam and Dan, who´s replacement had been inanimate when embroidered, Oliver was already alive, if still asleep.<br />
While Carl´s twin brothers were changed, Sam and Dan were disgusted. They were forced to absorb the saliva from their respective mouths the had been pushed into completely. Jeff had been relieved for the moment Carl had pulled him off to fill the condom, but felt rather empty while he laid there. Now, back around Carl´s cock, he tried to calm his brothers, not that it helped them in any way.<br />
When they suddenly heard Carl´s older twin-brothers scream in pain, they knew Carl had also embroidered them. Jeff asked quietly when the screaming stopped: “Are you okay? Leon? Rick?” Jeff had known Carl´s brothers, and even if he didn´t like them, he still thought nobody had earned this fate.<br />
“Who´s there?” asked Leon, surprised by Rick´s scream, but that voice was different. But somehow, he knew that voice.<br />
“It´s Jeff, and Dan and Sam are also here. So, Carl changed you two as well.” Jeff said, sounding calm.<br />
Rick answered this time: “If I get to him, he will die. That ass has the guts to push his foot into my mouth. That´s disgusting as hell. And that sock just dried my mouth completely, making the taste of feet even worse.”<br />
“Sorry, but your brother made us far to absorbing. I didn´t found it funny to be wet, either.” Dan replied with a sigh.<br />
“What do you mean? Wait, don´t tell me he changed you into his socks?” Leon asked, as it was dawning to him.<br />
“Yeah, he did. Dan is the right sock Rick was swallowing, while I´m the left one you had inside your mouth, Leon. And Jeff is his boxer-shorts.” Sam explained, sounding just as depressed as Jeff and Dan.<br />
“That´s horrible. How can our little brother do this? If I get my hands on him, I will kill him.” Rick said, with even more force behind his words now. Only for the other three to sigh yet again.<br />
“He won´t change us back. He even made replacements for us three out of his old socks and underwear. And I think he made only one for you.” Jeff said. <br />
While they asked about their replacement, Carl altered reality with the chronivac, so nobody would remember the twins, but his only brother instead. “There, nobody will miss Rick or Leon now. Only Oliver will be there instead.” With that, he woke his new brother up.<br />
“He used WHAT?” Leon and Rick screamed at the same time. Dan had just explained what Carl had used for Oliver. They still remembered the twins normally, meaning that the altered reality didn´t affect them. “That´s even more disgusting.”<br />
But they couldn´t do a thing, as Oliver was worshiping Carl, something neither of them would have ever done.</p>
