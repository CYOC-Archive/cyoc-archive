<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a Monday, and for all who know schools on Mondays, it would be full of sleep deprived zombies, or so Brad hoped it would be. The weekend had been madness for Brad; two days was just not enough time for him to cope with his new body. <br />
<br />
When he woke up on Saturday, he went ballistic with panic, wildly flailing around and screaming in horror as he realized that the nightmare he had was real. It took Kaitlyn some time to calm him down, and he only did calm down when she stuffed his face into her large soft breasts. The motherly act worked in calming him down. Every breath of her scent slowed his racing heart, and the warm embrace of his girlfriend convinced him that the world wasn’t over. Of course her mammoth meatstick resting on Brad’s thighs brought no comfort, but he endured because he was just glad to have someone holding on to him. An emotional boy he was, as many boys were. Without his tall stature and manly muscles, he felt weak and exposed, but the simplest act of having someone hug him was the reassurance he needed to not slip into madness.<br />
<br />
She had dressed him in one of her shirts, and for the rest of the day, Brad and Kaitlyn spent time in close contact with each other. He would follow her like a child, and would hug her every time she stopped moving. He did feel like a child to Kaitlyn in his oversized t-shirt and short height. She thought that it was cute, and while the actions did make her long dong erect sometimes, she didn’t act on it following Bree’s last commands to not masturbate. Kaitlyn spent the day letting Brad get comfortable in his changed body. They slept together during the night with Brad hugging Kaitlyn’s back like a small mammal.<br />
<br />
On Sunday, Brad returned to his normal mindset and was furious. He wanted to go out, find Bree the bitch, or more like witch, and make her undo her magic on him and his girlfriend. Kaitlyn didn’t feel the same as her boyfriend, and stated to him that she really liked her extra large sized cock and balls. She then changed the subject by teaching him how to dress up in his new body, as it was entirely female, with the exception of his small private parts. Brad reluctantly learned how to be stylish, as he didn’t want to stand out in public with his new form. Kaitlyn then went shopping with Brad to get him fitting sized clothes.  Brad was glad that Kaitlyn was his girlfriend, even if she was packing the largest dick and balls in the world.<br />
<br />
All of that happened on the weekend, which led to Monday. Brad needed to go to school because he needed to find Brianna and make her change him back to normal. Plus Kaitlyn’s parents were coming home so he couldn’t hide in her house.  He stood in front of the school in his new clothes, pondering if he should just wait outside for Brianna to appear or if he should follow Kaitlyn in. He was wearing an oversized sweater over a crop top t-shirt and training bra. For his lower wear it was short shorts over tights and panties. Brad didn’t want to wear the underwear but his girlfriend insisted, menacingly towering over him. He couldn’t really defy his girlfriend when he was normal, but now that he was smaller than her he didn’t have a choice. The wrestling that ensued ended in Kaitlyn forceabley putting him in his female underwear . She said that he had to wear the bra so that his nipples wouldn’t be exposed through his shirt, and the panties wouldn’t create an outline for his tights. In all Brad was a very stylish dark haired cutie,a fact that many students took notice of as they stared at him. Already they started chatting wondering who this new beauty was and what she was doing at their school. <br />
<br />
“Fuck it.” Brad said, and he walked into the school building. Kaitlyn had already gone to class, hiding her massive endowments as instructed. Brad didn’t know how she hid her dong of scholongs, but she did.<br />
<br />
Brad walked along the hall peering this way and that, scanning people for the browned haired Brianna. Unfortunately, he didn’t find her and was forced by a teacher to go to his classroom. When he entered the room the students, although tired, perked up with interest at this pretty girl in their classroom. <br />
<br />
“Uh, I&#39;m here as a potential transfer, the office told me to observe this class,” Brad made the excuse to the teacher. To his surprise the teacher just told him that he could sit at the back. <br />
<br />
“So you’re new,” a boy whispered to Brad, once he was seated.<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah,” Brad said, trying to act normal.<br />
<br />
“Have you got any friends here?” Another boy asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Brad did have friends, but he couldn’t meet with them in his new body.<br />
<br />
“You should hang out with us at lunch,” a girl spoke up, her group also voiced their approval.<br />
<br />
“Maybe, if I have the time,” Brad needed to find Bree not hang out with the girls. By now the whole area around Brad was focused on him more than the lesson. It was then Brad realized that finding Bree was going to be a lot harder than he first thought. If he was this popular in one classroom, then what was going to happen at lunch?</p>
