<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Naomi quickly tugged down her sweater as a desperate attempt to hide her swelling asset. Luckily, Rachel didn't seem to notice the bulge underneath her skirt when she turned her head toward Naomi. Rachel looked at her with a quizzical look wondering why her friend was suddenly so flush. She and Naomi had been friends for nearly a decade, and she had never acted so odd in front of her. Even though she had recently been rejected by the person she had feelings for, her behavior still seemed a bit strange.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Naomi said shyly, averting her eyes so as not to stare at her friend and her more outstanding features, &quot;I was wondering... If you didn't have anything planned that is... Would you, perhaps, like to come over to my house and do something this weekend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Rachel replied, smiling toward her friend, &quot;I don't really have plans for this coming weekend, so it'll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
She probably needs the company right now, Rachel thought to herself as she got out of the car, being rejected by some you had so much affection toward can be pretty devastating...<br />
<br />
After hearing Rachel's reply, Naomi smiled to herself as she got out of the car, with her face continuing to be a bit flush. Rachel turned toward Naomi as she finished locking the car door and asked, &quot;How about I come over tonight and sleep over and then we do something together in the morning? Is that alright with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi heart skipped a beat. Sleeping over? She desperately didn't Rachel finding about her new appendage. However, if she declined Rachel's offer, she would probably get more suspicious then she probably was now. Naomi sighed, seeing only one viable option available to her. &quot;Of course it's alright!&quot; Naomi turned her head with a smile, &quot;You can come around eight, alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi then turned back toward the school and walked toward her first class.<br />
<br />
Today's classes hadn't been any kinder to her since yesterday. Keeping her eyes off her peers was as difficult as it had been before. The preference of clingier and somewhat revealing clothing by some of the more attractive female classmates didn't make her time much easier. Her brother's advice of masturbating really didn't seem to help her libido at all... Luckily for her, the convenience of pulling down her thick sweater down whenever she was started to get a hard on helped her dodge a few bullets throughout the day.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for her, not all her troubles came from her groin that day. Her English teacher give her a pretty hard time for not turning her essay in on time. To make it worse, her teacher's loud tone practically broad-casted her scoldings to the rest of the classroom, making Naomi feel uneasier than she already had been.<br />
<br />
She decided to walk home that day since the long walk would give her time to think about the evening ahead. She had a lot of preparations to do to make sure the night went with as little trouble as possible.<br />
<br />
She made getting trying to get her family out of the house for the weekend her utmost urgency. If something did happen between her and Rachel, she didn't want her mother, father, or sister to accidentally stumble in and discover it. She got a lucky break with her parents, they both had important work meetings scheduled that would keep them for a day or two. Naomi's real trouble was with her sister. Her sister was pretty defiant when it came to dealing with her, and it made trying to convince her to sleep over at one of her friend's houses fairly difficult. It took a bribe and promises to do chores for a week to get her out, but her sister was finally convinced to go.<br />
<br />
Naomi looked up at the clock. &quot;Good, it's only seven,&quot; she said to herself, &quot;That gives me enough time to wash up and get into my pajamas before Rachel arrives...&quot;<br />
<br />
She took off her clothing stepped into the bathroom and ran the bath water until the tub was filled. She then gingerly stepped into the warm water of the bathtub and slid down into a relaxing position. She closed her eyes as the water's heat helped ease her up and sensations of a good bath helped her temporarily forget about her worries. She cracked open one eye and looked downward at her male appendage through the water. Her mind flashed back to yesterday and her experiences with masturbating in the bathtub. Her thoughts quickly became centered about doing it again as she thought about what happened yesterday more. Even though she was mortified about ejaculating all over herself, she still felt compelled. &quot;Well, I'm desperate for anything that might keep my crotch from acting up around my friend,&quot; she sighed, &quot;And it did kinda feel really good... Sorta...&quot;<br />
<br />
After coming to terms with her feelings on the subject, she sat up and attempted to repeat what she had done the day prior.<br />
<br />
To get herself started, she closed her eyes and once again thought about her female classmates nude, trying her hardest not fantasize about Rachel. Thinking about the voluptuous curves of her more well endowed peers made her asset respond with the desired effect. She lathered up her hand and gently started rubbing the length of her appendage up and down.<br />
<br />
As she felt herself getting harder, she started rubbing her groin firmer and firmer. As her penis extended to it's full length, she started to gently message the new unconcealed tip with her thumb like she had done once before. Her breathing got a bit heavier as she started to get into it more as she started started bucking her hips in rhythm to her stimulating, but making sure she didn't go too overboard with it. The familiar sensation of needing to pee once again emerged. She let herself go with a moan and felt the hot spikes of pleasure erupt from her crotch several times.<br />
<br />
Naomi opened her eyes, now a bit prepared for what she would see. She stared at her hand and stomach again, shuddering a bit at viscous white liquids on them, but handling it a bit better than she did the other day. She washed herself up, dried off, got into her pajamas and finished up her nightly routine. Her blue-flannel jammies were loose enough for her to conceal her asset, but unfortunately not loose enough to keep it from being noticeable if it ever got erect.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, Rachel had arrived carrying a bag full of clothing for the night and the day ahead. Naomi welcomed Rachel in with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just us for the night, Rachel,&quot; Naomi said, &quot;Both my parents are out on business and my sister is spending the night at one of her friend's houses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; Rachel replied, &quot;Well in that case I'll just set my stuff in your room. Since you're already in your pajamas, I guess I'll take a bath and do the same.<br />
<br />
Naomi nodded and followed Rachel into her room. Naomi sat down in front of her television as Rachel set down her clothes bag on Naomi's bed, got out her clothes for the night and headed into the bathroom. Naomi tried her best to distract herself and not allow herself to think about her friend in the bath while listening to the audible sounds of the water being turned on and off and the slight splashing noises of Rachel moving inside the tub. She sighed with relief as she heard the water being drained and the sounds of Rachel brushing her teeth shortly after.<br />
<br />
Naomi turned toward her doorway as she heard Rachel approaching. To Naomi's dismay, Rachel hadn't put the normal clothing she usually wore to bed. Rachel stood in the doorway wearing pink shorts that cut off slightly above the knee and a clingy white shirt that showed off curves of her heavy chest. It became more than obvious to Naomi that Rachel wasn't wearing a bra when she noticed Rachel's nipples protruding out of her shirt a bit. Naomi immediately started to preoccupy her mind with other things as a desperate attempt to keep her groin tame, while absentmindedly staring at Rachel.<br />
<br />
Rachel noticed Naomi staring at her a bit and said, &quot;Guess you're surprised a bit about what I'm wearing. My normal pajamas were in the wash and the sleepover was kinda short-notice, so I picked out an old t-shirt and shorts from my dressers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel walks toward Naomi and sits down. Naomi immediately gets flushed. That familiar feeling once again comes over her...</p>
