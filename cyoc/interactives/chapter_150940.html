<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay woke up and found himself fully under his sheets, head and all. It was silent, and he found himself staring down at his naked body. He breathed a sigh of relief. His penis looked like it was back to the normal size. Reaching down, Jay was so happy that it felt the same as it usually did. The night before it had looked as if Jay&#39;s penis had shrunk down to a third of its original size. And the hangover that Jay woke up with proved that he probably was feeling all sorts of messed up. The girl from the night before must have been confused, but Jay had been slipped drugs in the past and felt even worse, so who is to say what happened. <br />
Jay felt himself up, and his erection raged. He was going to fully jerk off, but something felt wrong as if he was in a position he had never been in before. So he pulled the sheet away.<br />
And then Jay pulled the sheet away from his head. And yelled. <br />
<br />
--- --- ---<br />
<br />
Jay was correct, his dick had shrunk to a third of its normal size. And it had shrunk to the size that that extra small condom would fit. But now, Jay had shrunk too. But in the right proportion. He was a third of his original size, roughly about two feet tall. Jumping out of bed Jay felt himself feeling completely off balance. Everything around him seemed so much larger. It wasn&#39;t like some sort of &quot;Honey I Shrunk the Kids&quot; shit, because this was still his normal room. Instead, it was just all a bit further above him. Jay was now roughly the size of a four-year-old, and seeing the world from this perspective was... something else. <br />
Jay&#39;s scream had rung through the frat dorm, and one of his friend&#39;s had come running in. Freddie threw open the door and stared around, and then his eyes met Jay. For a split second, it was as if Freddie had seen a ghost, his eyes widening. But then that expression faded to one of worry, running over to Jay and physically lifting him up onto the bed. <br />
&quot;Oh gosh, did you fall out of bed? I heard you yell!&quot; Freddie&#39;s concern was true, and he fully was caring for him. Jay was confused for a second and tried to point out that this wasn&#39;t normal and that he had been three times the size only a few hours before. But that couldn&#39;t be formed from his mouth, it felt like gibberish. Instead, he asked a question.<br />
&quot;Have I always been this big?&quot; Jay asked. <br />
Freddie burst out laughing. &quot;Yeah, yeah. I know, I shouldn&#39;t worry. It&#39;s how things go for you. I&#39;m sorry for worrying bro, I&#39;ll let you do whatever. I know that people of your size -- sorry, MINIS!  -- just want independence.&quot; Freddie stood up and walked over to the door. &quot;See you downstairs for breakfast, Jay. And good luck on the stairs.&quot;<br />
Jay also laughed. It felt like a conversation he had had so many times in his life, but one that he couldn&#39;t explain. He felt blissed out all of a sudden as if this is how things just... worked. Walking over to the mirror, Jay saw how he was built the exact same way he had been the day before, but now it was just a bit smaller, as if seen through a funhouse mirror. Opening the closet all of Jay&#39;s clothes were the same but for the smaller size, and even the handle on the door was at the right height. Jay&#39;s shoes were now size 2 and his clothing was &quot;Mini&quot; (as if that were a standard size). Jay just sighed. He felt like there wasn&#39;t anything to really complain about. <br />
Jay looked around his room and grabbed his phone (which was standard-sized for an iPhone, meaning it was basically the size of Jay&#39;s arm), and saw the text from the girl from before, saying she had a great time. Jay was proud, but that was Jay&#39;s reputation. Minis were known for their tenderness with women, and Jay had a bigger dick than almost any mini he had ever seen. Then, he looked at the dresser next to him. It was still the same size as before, but a step-ladder next to the bed helped him see to the top of it. Something was missing.  His wallet, his watch, a glass of water... but what was gone? <br />
<br />
The condoms. The box that he had ordered. His special condoms for Minis. He had given Nate some as a joke the night before, and now the box was missing. <br />
Fuck.<br />
 <br />
--- --- ---<br />
<br />
Jay went down the hall and went into Nate&#39;s room. A woman was still in the bed next to Nate. Jay saw the box of condoms on the table next to Nate, so he walked over and went to grab them. It was a tall reach (three feet up!) but he finally pulled it off of the side table. However, the box fell to the ground, a few condoms falling out. There were only about five or six left, and only a few wrappers were scattered about the floor around him. Someone else hit up his stash. Nate woke up to this noise though. He got out of bed and yawned. Nate stood a thin and lanky 5&#39;10. But Jay was surprised at how small Nate&#39;s dick was. Only about two inches soft on Nate&#39;s frame. But then something happened that changed the relationship between Nate and Jay forever.</p>
