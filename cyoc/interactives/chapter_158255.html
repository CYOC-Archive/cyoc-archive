<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam knew what was happening, all this talk of infections and sex had Lauren&#39;s formidable will at it&#39;s breaking point. The blossoming alpha lion instincts in her mind (from the size of those paws and her willpower, she was definitely an alpha in the making)  had her wanting to fuck and dominate Sam&#39;s girly body.<br />
<br />
And Sam&#39;s inner femboy sub was eager to oblige. No words were needed, they began to strip each other. <br />
<br />
Off came the yellow dress, revealing a six inch cock. Lauren&#39;s nuts seemed to be further along, two softballs filled the space between her thighs. These were will normal human skin, no fur had sprouted anywhere above her knees.<br />
<br />
She had a nice slender body, no real muscle tone but no excess fat either. Her chest was small, probably B cups at most, though her thin build and small torso made them seem appropriate for her.<br />
<br />
For the second time today, Sam worked to free her impressively plump ass from it&#39;s cloth prison.<br />
<br />
Lauren began to slide behind Sam, but the femboy shook her head. Sam pressed Lauren backwards into reclining position. She lowered her mouth into her lover&#39;s waiting cock. It&#39;s length seemed to be increasing with every pulse of her heart, fortunately the Femboy infection had removed Samantha&#39;s gag reflex. She went to work pleasuring the pent up student. In seconds a torrent of lion cum surged into Sam&#39;s throat.<br />
<br />
Lauren&#39;s transformation progressed with her release. With audible popping sounds her chest barrelled: shoulders spreading and ribcage deepening. Her breasts spread out and faded away, with the beginnings of defined pecs swelling in their absence. <br />
<br />
Her hands clenched as fur sprouted and her palms grew. Her fingers thickened, pads inflating like little black balloons. Her arms gained some muscle as the fur surged up to her elbows.<br />
<br />
On her legs, the fur also spread upwards, passing her thighs and covering her male attributes. It was the same cream color around her genitals, just much thicker. A tail extended behind her, with a honey colored tuft at the tip.<br />
<br />
&#39;More.&#39; This was a command, and Lauren effortlessly pushed Sam over and flipped her.<br />
<br />
Sam would have been powerless to resist - had she tried. Her submissive side was revelling in the rough handling and the ass pounding to follow.<br />
<br />
Sam lost track of time, in a fugue state of rolling orgasm. Lauren was relentless, not even pausing after each climax. <br />
<br />
Sam couldn&#39;t see what was happening, but she could feel Lauren&#39;s weight increasing steadily, the intoxicating musk of a virile lion growing ever stronger. She could see the arms pressed into the couch as the transforming girl supported herself to avoid crushing her little femboy cum dumpster. They had to be a foot across at the bicep, short but ultra thick fur softening the muscle definition slightly. Lauren&#39;s body pressing down on Sam&#39;s back now felt like the softest cashmere over rippling steel.<br />
<br />
After an unknown time and countless orgasms, they collapsed.<br />
<br />
Sam woke much later, perched atop Lauren&#39;s transformed lion body. He (for a feminine pronoun seemed very out of place in assocation with such a model of masculinity) was asleep, resting on his back with his arms behind his head. Lauren was probably a half a foot taller than any of the others she had seen today, and probably the widest as well. There was no trace of any fat, only the effect of his thick pelt softened the hard lines.<br />
<br />
Sam quietly started getting dressed. A glance at her phone told her it was 6pm, Mia would be long gone. They had fucked and slept the day way.<br />
<br />
Sam scribbled a note with her name and information, and left the new lion to his slumber.<br />
<br />
She arrived back at her house, a fixer upper in an old suburban neighborhood. She had paid it off in four years thanks to her high risk, high pay job.<br />
<br />
She ordered a pizza to celebrate. She had what she needed to get back at Mia, she finally felt sated sexually, and maybe she could at least be fuck buddies with Lauren or one of the other Pride lions.<br />
<br />
Waiting on the pizza, she got out a bottle of bourbon and poured a double, tossed it back, and poured another.<br />
<br />
An hour later the pizza was still not there, but Sam was nicely drunk and didn&#39;t mind. She had one of the vials of Gay Pride virus laden spunk on the table.<br />
<br />
Having interacted with a bunch of people transformed by it, she was having second thoughts about using it for revenge on Mia. The virus now seemed to be a doorway to a more open social and sexual life, a healthy active lifestyle practically dictated by an ultra fit body and boundless energy. She&#39;d be destroying Mia&#39;s vain and shallow life and probably gifting her something better. <br />
<br />
The doorbell rang. &#39;Saved by pizza&#39; she laughed.<br />
<br />
Opening the door she was surprised to instead find the towering figure of Lauren.<br />
<br />
&#39;You aren&#39;t the pizza dude! Lauren, come on in, have a drink.&#39;<br />
<br />
Lauren laughed and ducked his head to enter. &#39;There&#39;s a big sausage pizza joke to be made, but I&#39;ll let it go. And I&#39;ve decided Lars is much more fitting.&#39;<br />
<br />
Sam shivered, she hadn&#39;t heard his voice after he had finished changing. Deep and rich, it was a sonic velvet earthquake. She could smell him too, a primal aromatic buffet of power and masculinity. The other lions from today were nothing compared to this.<br />
<br />
Lars sniffed the bourbon. &#39;You know I&#39;m barely 19.&#39;<br />
<br />
Sam smiled &#39;I&#39;m 27 and I look underage. Let&#39;s not fuss about rules. What brings you here?&#39;<br />
<br />
Lars looked at her warmly. &#39;I felt like I was supposed to be with you tonight. I can&#39;t really explain it. Same way I&#39;m not sure why I opened up to you this morning, it just felt right.&#39;<br />
<br />
Sam nodded. &#39;Things happen for a reason. I was in the middle of making a decision, and your arrival is definitely a sign.&#39;<br />
<br />
Sam then spilled out her whole story; catching Femboy, losing her boyfriend because of it, Mia and her cowardice, her plan, and even her encounter with the school nurse.<br />
<br />
&#39;So I&#39;ve sitting here eyeing up this vial, debating if I really should be leaving Mia alone as her worthless shallow self, and I should drink it instead.&#39;<br />
<br />
She tossed in the air and caught it.<br />
<br />
&#39;You are my answer.&#39;<br />
<br />
Samantha popped the top and tipped it back. She shook it to get the last few goopy drops.<br />
<br />
&#39;No second thoughts now, I&#39;m committed.&#39;<br />
<br />
Lars put his arms around her and scooped her up, almost as an adult would a child. Sizewise it wasn&#39;t far off, as Lars had a good two feet and 500 pounds on her.<br />
<br />
Just then the door bell rang, spoiling the moment.</p>
