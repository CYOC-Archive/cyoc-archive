<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charlie impatiently knocked another three times, then just went at it. Terry tried to stop his boyfriend, but Charlie was by now to annoyed. Finally the door opened, to an older woman the same size as Charlie. Her eyes narrowed.<br />
&quot;Can I help you?&quot; The woman&#39;s face was unlined and her hair steel gray. It was cut short, for some reason it reminded the two men of a donkey. Terry studied her face, especially her dark eyes. He couldn&#39;t quite place her ethnicity. Her skin reminded him of a bronzed statue, it almost seemed to glow.<br />
&quot;Yeah, our car is busted.&quot; Charlie said, gesturing with his thumb. &quot;We&#39;re stuck on the side of the road. You got a phone?&quot; The woman didn&#39;t respond. She went completely rigid for a minute. Then slowly she smiled.<br />
&quot;I believe I can help you two gentlemen out.&quot; She said. Her smile was a bit too wide, it made Terry&#39;s skin crawl.<em>How many teeth does she have?</em> <br />
Neither of them noticed the woman was nude.<br />
&quot;Come in, come in.&quot; She said, moving out of the way. Charlie walked right in, but Terry stayed on the porch. The woman&#39;s smile faltered. &quot;You too young man.&quot; Terry shook his head. His boyfriend looked back.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Charlie asked. Terry didn&#39;t respond. His mouth had gone dry. The woman looked at Charlie in confusion.<br />
&quot;Have I said something?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nah, he&#39;s been messed up since the car broke down.&quot; Charlie said. He finally took his boyfriends hand and lead him inside. Terry&#39;s eyes never left the woman.<br />
&quot;Your teeth are too flat.&quot; Terry said. Charlie face palmed.<br />
&quot;So it would seem.&quot; She said, &quot;Come now, the phone is in the kitchen. Come.&quot; She gestured with her hand.<br />
The house was lifeless, that was the best word for it. Their were pictures on the walls, with pictures of horses, cows, fields, a cat an&quot;d not a single person. None of the woman, none of any one else of significance. The walls were painted stone white, stainless and clean. It actually added to the creepy factor. The floors were polished wood, so clean you could see your reflection in them. Terry tried to leave a footprint, but no matter how hard he pressed it stayed clean.<br />
&quot;This house belongs in Stepford.&quot; Terry said. &quot;Original or remake.&quot;<br />
&quot;I dunno what you are talking about,&quot; Charlie said, &quot;Let&#39;s just get the phone and get the hell out of here. <br />
The woman lead the two to a tiny kitchen in the back of the house. The kitchen was white, disturbingly bright white. The floor was linolium, some how more clean than the wooden floors of the hall. All of the cabinets were wood, painted clean white. The counters were white tiled, they seemed to glow. The only thing not white was the kitchen table, the surface being brown wod.<br />
&quot;Fucking hell, you cook in a dentists office?&quot; Charlie asked. &quot;Where&#39;s the phone?&quot; He scanned the walls, the counters and no phone. No sockets either.<br />
&quot;No, I just like things clean and bright the woman said, ignoring him.<br />
&quot;My boyfriend asked you a question ma&#39;am.&quot; Terry said.<br />
&quot;Boyfriend? I must admit I was not expecting that.&quot; She stopped  in front of them, her body tense. &quot;No matter, I can see in you what I need.&quot; <br />
&quot;What are you talking about lady?&quot; Charlie asked. The woman didn&#39;t respond.<br />
Then her ears exploded.<br />
Well no, they didn&#39;t explode, but that&#39;s how it looked to the two men. All of a sudden her ears jerked up by several inches, or maybe by a foot, turning into massive furry things. Her hair in turn fell apart, leaving her with a spikey stripe down the middle. The color turned much deeper black while it grew much longer.<br />
&quot;What the fucking fuck is that!?&quot; Charlie screamed. Terry didn&#39;t respond, too paralyzed. The woman&#39;s butt began to swell now, as did her legs. Terry tried to move away, only to bump against a closed door. He fumbled for the knob, locked.<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t be leaving that way I&#39;m afraid.&quot; The woman said. Her lower body jerked. Then her legs split. Charlie&#39;s jaw dropped. Her butt kept swelling and her...two sets of legs began to grow apart from each other. Not only that, but her feet were beginning to compress.<br />
&quot;This farm belongs to me and my mate.&quot; The woman said, &quot;You&#39;ll meet him soon enough. &quot; She shuddered in ecstasy, as a lump swelled above her butt. It grew quickly, becoming a fleshy tube that swayed back and forth. Every inch it grew caused hair to sprout across it, fine gray hair. At the end of the tail, tangled black hairs sprouted.<br />
&quot;Everyone who comes here becomes a part of my home.&quot; The woman said, then moaning. &quot;Oh God, you can&#39;t imagine how hard it is to go without my tail!&quot;<br />
&quot;Let us out!&quot; Terry screamed. He tried to pull the door free. Charlie joined him, slamming against it with his shoulder. The flimsy wooden door was somehow stronger than steel.<br />
&quot;You should consider yourselves lucky.&quot; The woman said, turning to face the two, &quot;Most of our visitors never glimpse me or my mate. Not until they&#39;ve changed at least.&quot; The two men were greeted by a centaur woman. Except, instead of a horse, she was a donkey from the waist down. A gray donkey with black hooves and a thick tail swaying behind her. Her upper body was human, except for her big gray donkey ears. She smiled at the two.<br />
&quot;My name is Alanna.&quot; She said, &quot;A member of the Fey and mistress of this farm built at the point where your world and mine intersect. All who cross the barrier will join me and my mate here, as guests on our farm. For you see, my mate and I can see beyond the skin. We can see what resides within. And I can see you are not human.&quot; She pointed at Terry. &quot;You sir, you are a horse.&quot; She pointed at Charlie, &quot;And you are his broodmare.&quot;</p>
