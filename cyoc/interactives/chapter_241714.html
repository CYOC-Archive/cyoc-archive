<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The bell rang as Jennifer grabbed her bag and headed out to the front of the school, Rose had to stay behind after-school usually with her dad. Jennifer waited as a line of cars waiting in the circle as kids hopped in to go back home. After a few minutes a black sedan rolled up as Katherine rolled down the window. &quot;Come on.&quot; She said with a wave. Jennifer ran up to the door and hopped into the backseat. &quot;How was school?&quot; her sister asked. Jennifer smiled as she spilled out her days events, &quot;Oh this morning we went to the middle school, but then we had to come back because some kids got the cooties, and then I learned compound words!&quot; Katherine slipped a high five from behind &quot;Nice, that sounds fun.&quot; <br />
<br />
As Katherine pulled out into the street she turned her head. &quot;Hey before we head home I gotta make a quick stop at the gas station.&quot; It was her first car after all, had to keep it in the best working order she could. As the car went down the road Jennifer spied around the backseat, just above the storage bin was a small warning sign for booster seats for passengers ten or younger. Jennifer shrugged, she already as in a booster seat, her feet dangled from the floor. &quot;I see you lost your pants today Jennifer.&quot; Katherine looked back. &quot;Yea, we were traveling a lot.&quot; Jennifer replied. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; Katherine muttered curtly. &quot;It&#39;s not worse than high-school today.&quot;<br />
<br />
The car turned into the gas station as Katherine unrolled the windows as a clerk walked up and began to pump gas. The women looked into the window as she turned to Katherine. &quot;Aw she&#39;s precious, your kid?&quot; Katherine looked back confused. &quot;Why do you say that?&quot; The worker blushed, as she spoke with a deep southern drawl. &quot;Well it&#39;s just you two look so similar, I must say you make cute kids.&quot; She waved her hand. Katherine turned her head back to Jennifer, &quot;Yea she&#39;s mine, wave sweety.&quot; Jennifer waved to the lady through the windows. Katherine sighed as her breasts grew slightly, beneath her shirt her nipples growing as the pressed against her bra.<br />
<br />
The attendant looked through the windows and waved back. &quot;How old is she?&quot; she asked, &quot;Oh she&#39;s only in kindergarten, I just picked her up.&quot; Jennifier smiled as she continued to wave from her car seat. &quot;Yea she&#39;s a cooties baby, got her when I was in middle school, uh, thirteen.&quot; The attendant nodded, &quot;Yea I&#39;ve heard that&#39;s been going around, but I see you&#39;re doing good. Have you graduated yet?&quot; <br />
<br />
Katherine shook her head, &quot;No, not yet, I still got a while until I finish.&quot; Her voice changed a pitch as she shrank into the drivers seat slightly. &quot;Mom&#39;s been helping me with school and raising her.&quot; The attendant finished pumping as she turned to set the pump back. &quot;Well that&#39;s very nice of her, now that&#39;ll be thirty bucks and thirty seven cents.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer watched from her car seat as Katherine muttered, &quot;Uh well, I don&#39;t have that at the moment.&quot; The attendant looked confused, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Katherine blurted out as she sank another inch into the seat. &quot;Mom was going to grab a few drinks, she&#39;ll be right back.&quot; Katherine suddenly appearing in the passenger seat. &quot;Of course, your mom&#39;s very beautiful.&quot; The attendant added. Jennifer could only hear the conversation now, her car seat now backward facing, she stared at the car ceiling for a few moments before she heard a voice. &quot;Sorry about that, here&#39;s the payment.&quot; before a door sound was heard as her grandma sat down. &quot;Alright, I got you a drink kiddo.&quot; She said as a bag was heard rummaging. &quot;Aw sweet, thanks mom.&quot; Katherine said, her voice much more higher pitched than before.<br />
<br />
The car began to move again as the two talked as Jennifer listened. &quot;Aw it looks like she&#39;s sleeping.&quot; her mom said as she looked through the mirror. Katherine sighed &quot;I hope she is, I could use the break.&quot; Katherine rubbed her shirt &quot;My breasts are so annoying now.&quot; &quot;Well have you been pumping like you should?&quot; her mom corrected. &quot;Yea I do, they just constantly leak.&quot; Katherine lied, now telling the truth as two damp spots now started to leak through her shirt. &quot;Well maybe I&#39;ll watch over the baby for a night for you.&quot; her mom offered. &quot;You&#39;d do that? That&#39;s really nice of you.&quot; Katherine smiled through her voice. Jennifer raised her hand, it seemed very tiny, puffy even, she was barely a year old. The car rolled to a stop as Katherine&#39;s face appeard in Jennifer&#39;s vision, she was much younger, braces and acne now covering her face. Jennifer smiled as she giggled her toothless grin. She loved mommy, mommy was good. Jennifer babbled, even managing to say &#39;ma&#39; a few times. Picking up Jennifer she found how small she really was, dangling from her mother&#39;s grip. Jennifer nestled her face into Katherine&#39;s small bosom as they walked into the house.<br />
<br />
Katherine set Jennifer down in her play area as she turned to sit down. Her mother kneeling down to Jennifer&#39;s side. &quot;Aw you&#39;re so cute Jenny. That&#39;s right! Yes you are!&quot; she gushed as she smiled. Jennifer giggled in response. The mom put her hands next to her face and said, &quot;Peekaboo!&quot; And suddenly disappeared. Jennifer&#39;s smile disappeared as the women had vanished. <br />
<br />
Katherine kneeled down to pick Jennifer up. &quot;There you are, my big girl.&quot; Jennifer stood up as Katherine fushed around her. &quot;I&#39;m big?&quot; she said, growing more and more. &quot;Oh yeah, you&#39;re so big you&#39;re about to have your first day at daycare.&quot; Jennifer looked down to see her clothes being placed on her. &quot;How big?&quot; Jennifer questioned again. &quot;Well you&#39;re still growing Jen.&quot; Katherine said, now brushing her hair, each stroke getting longer and longer. &quot;Big as you?&quot; Jennifer asked again. Katherine laughed. &quot;No not as big as me, but maybe one day, are you ready to go to kindergarten?&quot; Katherine stood up, wincing as her damp breasts continued to leak, pulling off her wet shirt. She grabbed Jennifer&#39;s bag as she held her hand as they left the house.</p>
