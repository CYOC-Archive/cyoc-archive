<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up the next morning, feeling so well rested for the first time in probably decades that I thought maybe I’d died in the middle of the night (and maybe I had?) I could feel I was laying under coarse flannel sheets, which were definitely not my usual cotton sheets and down comforter. That was the first indication something drastic had changed. I open my eyes and see I’m in a room, a small room decorated with various posters of video game characters and some classic films, mostly neat and organized, but again, not my usual spotless and largely undecorated master bedroom. I hear a knock at the door, which was very surprising as I live alone, but apparently not anymore in this weird dream I’m having. Without waiting for a response, a large very muscular man in his late 40s enters the room. “Get up Jesse, it’s your last week of school, no slacking off now.” He opens the curtains to allow more light in, and more importantly, to let some of the funk of the room dissipate. “Breakfast will be ready in 20 minutes, shower and get ready so I can drop you off on my way in.” he said, matter-of-factly. <br />
<br />
Then it hit me, I recognized this man, he was often at my gym if I made it there after work. He wasn’t much taller than I was, well than I used to be, maybe 5’8 at most, but easily in the low 200s, and all of it muscle. He had buzzed brown hair, hazel eyes, square jaw, some tattoos all along his massive arms. I think I overheard once he was a police captain or something, and he certainly had the bearing for it. I also remember I would often see him with what I assumed was his son. A tall, but lean built kid, same brown hair but shaggy with blue eyes, not unattractive, but not stunning either, just kinda average. I recall he was incredibly shy and wouldn’t talk to anyone, he barely talked to his father when they worked out even. He tended to wear baggy T shirts which looked even more massive on his small frame, as well as baggy what I call dorm pants (you know, the thicker cotton kind of pants people tend to wear as pajamas). These were easily two sizes too big on him, but with the drawstring tied as tight as possible to keep from losing them down his scrawny legs. <br />
<br />
Once Jesse’s dad left (I didn’t know his name at the time) I threw back the covers and decided it was time to play along with this dream I guess. I saw I was wearing no shirt now, showing off the pale lean chest with some shallow abs and slowly developing pecs, with some fairly decent arms, but nowhere near his dad’s size. I also saw I had on those same sort of pants I mentioned before. Like a typical teen, I had some morning wood, so I could see a slightly above average size mound poking up. What was odd to me was that this mound was somewhat wide, though maybe his dick is just laying sideways, I thought to myself at the time. <br />
<br />
I wasn’t sure what to wear, as I have no idea what kids wear nowadays, so I just sort of rifled through the drawers until I found some socks, boxer shorts (again, size L when this thin waist looks maybe medium at best), and a plain graphic T shirt, size XL, with some cartoon character I didn’t recognize on it. I found his jeans hanging in the closet, and found that he wore a size 36 waist (that can’t be right, even for as tall as he is), and the material was particularly stretchy. Knowing full well that these won’t stay up on this new waist of mine, I also found a belt still in some discarded jeans laying across the back of a computer chair. <br />
<br />
Outfit completed with maybe 10 minutes to shower, I intuitively found the bathroom outside my door and immediately to the right. I recognized this floor plan as some two-bedroom condos not too far from where I live. So that means, at least, no siblings. I entered the room and turned on the shower, allowing it a minute to warm up and feeling the need to relieve myself. I’ve had similar dreams to this before, I’ll admit, where I’m in some stranger’s body and I might do something as mundane yet highly erotic as take a piss with their dick. Turns out this was going to be another of those weird dreams I guess. I pull off my dirty socks and undo the string on the pants, allowing them to fall to the floor and taking my boxer shorts with them…<br />
<br />
What… The… FUCK!<br />
<br />
There, hanging from my new groin, with a fairly neat trimmed bush surrounding it, was not one, but TWO dicks… TWO DICKS! Man this is definitely one hell of a fucked up dream then I guess, what the fuck did I eat last night? Oh, that’s right, nothing, cuz I was too busy to eat… <br />
<br />
Anyway, yeah, two semi hard teen dicks, both cut, just hanging there, and waiting for me to relieve them. Since I was thinking it was a dream, I wouldn’t bother to care if I piss all over the place, but then I thought better of it and decided to go in the shower – mainly because I wasn’t sure exactly which one would let the piss come out, would it be both, or just one of the two? At least in the shower, I could figure that out without making a mess of it. <br />
<br />
So totally naked, I step into the tub and let the water fall on my new teen body, and it does feel really good, but I know I won’t have much time to enjoy it just yet. So I take one dick in each hand, and I can feel the urine moving from my bladder, then I can feel it, as the urine moves up both dicks at the same time! I never thought the simple act of peeing could be this intense, but maybe it’s just because it’s totally new to me? The urine starts coming out of the right one first, a steady stream then it drops off a little, then the left one starts going, and then suddenly both are going strong like a fire hose. Holy Shit! <br />
<br />
By the time my bladder was totally emptied, I was hard as fuck! Both had grown to about 7 inches near as I could tell, with the left one being slightly shorter by maybe a half an inch. I couldn’t help but start to jack them off. The feeling of pleasure was incredible as I could feel my new teen body gradually reach orgasm in only a few minutes. I tried to jack the both at the same time, but it was admittedly tough to coordinate. So when my egg sized balls (just the two, like most people) pulled up tight, I ejaculated (and shot quite a few thick loads straight at the shower wall!) with my right one going off first, followed by my left one just a few seconds later. <br />
<br />
It took a couple of minutes to come down from the euphoria of my first orgasm as a double dicked teen. I realized I better hurry and I quickly threw some soap in my hair and around my sweaty parts, since there was not enough time to do a full clean. I was dressed and at the breakfast table with no time to spare and my dad giving me a stern knowing look. “Well, at least you’re not late. Hurry and eat, and remember I’ll get you after school from the gym tonight, ok?” I nodded and spoke my first words as Jesse, “OK dad… thanks…” I said with a weak smile. My voice was soft and timid, with a typical teen tenor to it. <br />
I looked at my new dad, and part of me wished I could have been that big muscle daddy instead, but then I remembered just how stressful his life probably is too. No, better to be a teen again, only having to worry about school (and dealing with two dicks) with a dad that might not be the most emotionally supportive, but clearly cared about me. <br />
<br />
On the way to school, I started to wonder when this dream would end, but in the back of my mind, I had realized a while ago that this was no dream – I really was Jesse the double dicked teen now. I just hoped this life was going to be much better than my old one. And so far, it seemed to be going in the right direction.</p>
