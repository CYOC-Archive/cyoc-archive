<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I accidentally posted this chapter anonomously, so i&#39;m reposting under my profile. Please delete the other branch. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Beneath the dark of his hands, Kevin found his mind start to clear. He felt the odd sensation of mental gears that had seemingly halted lurching into motion. His mind, it seems, had slowed more than he&#39;d realized. With a surprising amount of mental effort he pulled his thoughts out of comfortable molasses they had been swimming in since he&#39;d arrived. He took a deep breathe. Mindfulness. That&#39;s what he&#39;d need to get out of this mess. He&#39;d been practicing meditation for months before arriving because one of the NFT guru&#39;s he followed swore it made all the difference when considering where to place his money. Breathe, relax, calm. He repeated these words in his mind.<br />
<br />
With each breathe he shivered as he felt the foreign sensation of his stomach fur shift. He turned his attention to his tail. It lashed slightly. He realized he&#39;d never taken a chance to truely feel it. Each muscle was foreign, each twitch bizarre. Yet - at the same time - he found it familiar, comfortable, and distantly - right. Experimentally, he twisted it, grasping the table tightly. Controlling the growing appendage was effortless, as if he&#39;d been doing it his whole life. The thought made him shiver. His brain was changing, accepting the physical alterations with little resistance. The past days and hours had been so overwhelming and his mind so...distracted.. that he hadn&#39;t taken the time to truly take in what was happening to him. Mindfulness. He just needed to focus his mind.<br />
<br />
His thoughts then turned to the mild discomfort of the cum that had now soaked into his fur. Its slight weight and stickness grew more unpleasant the longer it lingered. He couldn&#39;t help but feel embarrassed and his face grew red. Just days earlier he was at home, had a beautiful girlfriend and most importantly, he was human. Now he was furry, growing a tail, and covered in his own simian cum.<br />
<br />
What the hell was going on.<br />
<br />
A hand gently, yet firmly placed itself on his side. A shiver traveled down Kevin&#39;s spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay little bro, looking a little red. &quot; Marcus&#39;s voice, concerned yet somehow assured of his dominance in the room.<br />
<br />
Kevin felt a jolt of anger. Little bro?? What was Marcus&#39; game?! He knew why Kevin was embarrassed yet he was treating it like this was all normal!<br />
<br />
Kevin felt his tail tense, and lash slightly in agitation. Anger was building in him. He wasn&#39;t gonna take this, he was his own man! Not a monkey! Not Marcus&#39; plaything! An independent man. The anger was close to boiling over as a collection of potential retorts shot through his mind.<br />
<br />
Kevin&#39;s hands dropped. He bared his pointed teeth and an animalistic fashion, and he turned to face Marcus.<br />
<br />
The anger vanished. Staring into the deep chocolate of those eyes his brain found it hard to comprehend the palpable embarrassment and anger he&#39;d felt moments before. It all just melted away, replaced again by the mental molasses which poured over his thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon bro, you don&#39;t need to worry about anything...Marcus&#39;ll take care of everything you need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I -uh-ooooohhh ook&quot; he moaned as the hand sensually traced down his side, sending of prickling bursts of pleasure. Fingers met Kevin&#39;s tail and gently stroked the surprisingly sensitive base of the tail, kneading out the remaining tension and anger. The tip of the tail idly searched for the source of its pleasure, wrapping itself around Maruc&#39;s arm as the stroking continued. Blood once again rushed into Kevin&#39;s member.<br />
<br />
The hand then moved to Kevin&#39;s increasingly bubble-like butt, giving it a tight, commanding squeeze that reminded the little monkey who was in charge here.<br />
<br />
&quot;ooooohh ooooKKKKKKK!&quot; Kevin screeched as A jolt of surprise overpowered the pleasure, causing Kevin to break from the momentary reverie. Pushing his chair back, Kevin threw himself up from the table as small hooting noises came unbidden from his mouth.<br />
<br />
Stumbling backwards though sheer force of momentum he felt a surface meet him from behind. His tail instinctually tried to grasp it, yet was still too underdeveloped to do so.<br />
<br />
Back against the wall, he paused for a moment and noticed the room had gone silent. Everyone was starting at him, observing the cum on his fur, seeing his still achingly hard erection.<br />
<br />
A shreik like snicker could be heard from someone on the other side of the commissary.<br />
<br />
WRONG. THIS IS ALL WRONG he thought as he surveyed the increasingly simian men. While concern continued to course through his mind, Kevin found his thoughts once again slowing. It&#39;s as if his mind were a rubber band. While he could stress it and pull it in a direction of clear, intelligent thinking, it always seemed to want to snap back to an increasingly dimwitted state. Slower thoughts combined with the stress of the moment to yield a sense of confusion. He didn&#39;t know what to do or how to act. Kevin froze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww, don&#39;t worry everyone, my little Kev&#39;s just a little embarrassed. He gets like this sometimes. &quot; came Marcus&#39;s voice, piercing the awkward silence that had taken the common room. In spite of himself, a part of Kevin couldn&#39;t help but admire the jock&#39;s surefooted command of even the most awkward situations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brandon!&quot; Marcus&#39;s hand shot up, flagging the bowtied &#39;frat boy&#39; over. &quot;Kev&#39;s made a little mess here, would you mind cleaning him up for us? Wouldn&#39;t want him a mess for the games tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course sir&quot; the monkey said with a slight bow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kev&quot; Marcus turned to Kevin &quot;Brandon&#39;s gonna clean you up and then why don&#39;t you go take a rest. You look like you need to take the edge off and I want the other guys drooling over you at the games tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Games.&quot; Kevin thought distantly, still frozen against the pillar &quot;Marcus had used that word twice now. What games...&quot;<br />
<br />
In his reverie he hardly noticed as Brandon approached, now inches from him. The increasingly butler-like simian paused. A look of concern crossed his face as he looked down at his hands. It was clear that Kevin wasn&#39;t the only one who had misgivings about their purchase. Once fairly pale, they had grown dark - almost tuxedo black. His neck and chest were still mostly human, however, Kevin noticed the beginnings of a collar of snowy white fur beginning to emerge. Kevin had forgot that it was possible to customize fur patterns and figured Brandon had gone the extra mile to bake the &#39;butler look&#39; straight into his NFT&#39;s fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I shouldn&#39;t want this&quot; Kevin heard the man whisper &quot;This is so wrong. Why does this feel sooo good?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin watched as Brandon&#39;s cock slowly began to harden. Kevin&#39;s own cock began to twitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I can&#39;t stop thinking about just being commanded. I-I want to be a servant, a...butler so bad. God I just want to be a dumb, hot, butler frat ape.... &quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon dropped himself forward, catching his weight on one of his knuckles. The other hand, grasped his cock, gently stroking it. Hie eyes visibly rolled and pleasure contorted his face.<br />
<br />
ooooh, ooooohhkk<br />
<br />
A look of tension then crossed Brandon&#39;s face. With a bit of internal resistance, he removed his hand from his cock, placing it on the ground in the same ape-like knuckle down position as his other. Lifting his head, he stared up at Kevin, an almost pleading look in his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit dude...Kevin....this is wrong. I&#39;m straight...I&#39;m the head of my division at Eagle financial. I&#39;m supposed to be the dominant one...&quot; came Brandon&#39;s voice, quiet as a whisper.<br />
<br />
Brandon looked down at his stance on the ground. An eyebrow rose slightly as he noticed the apelike stance he&#39;d assumed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve changed so much....ya gotta help bro. Get us out of here. I-I fucking can&#39;t help it, this just feels tooo goood. I-I can&#39;t resist. I feel myself want to change. To embrace it all. I just nee-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chop chop Bradon!&quot; Marcus commanded, interrupting the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuckkkkk&quot; Moaned Brandon, his face instantly melting from concern into pleasure.A burst of cum shot from Brandon&#39;s cock, landing on Kevin&#39;s already cum stained fur. The command was simple, yet enough to nudge Brandon past his momentary lapse of concern. Brandon just couldn&#39;t help himself. He lived to serve and obey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now look what you&#39;ve done! Twice the mess...&quot; Marcus shook his head &quot;There&#39;s nothing an ape should like more than tending to his brother&#39;s fur. Especially in my troop. I want to see Kev&#39;s fur spotless!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right away sir&quot; Brandon said, head bowing slightly to Marcus before turning to his target.<br />
<br />
Kevin felt Brandon&#39;s tounge meet his fur. The feeling was otherworldly, yet entirely pleasurable. Something about his increasingly ape like mind enjoyed having another ape clean and tend to his fur. It&#39;s just what apes do. Brandon continued his progress, working his way up the leg and towards his highly sensitive inner thigh. He was clearly eager, having forgot his reservations and lapped up each and every drop with the refined care of a skilled servant. All the while, Brandon&#39;s cock remained hard, twitching in need but unable to find release. There would be time to tend to it later, right now he had a job to do.<br />
<br />
Kevin, meanwhile, was speechless.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is wrong&quot; he thought as he stood passively and just let it happen. He couldn&#39;t help but enjoy the other male&#39;s eager attention. His cock began to dribble a stream of more cum, making more work for his &#39;servant.&#39; A hint of envy filled Kevin&#39;s thoughts. While being a butler wasn&#39;t exactly his cup of tea, the idea of serving others and satiating their needs just seemed so attractive to his changing mind. Another dripple of cum gushed from his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;All done sir&quot; came rBandon&#39;s voice &quot;Shall I finish the job? Wouldn&#39;t want you making another mess on your newly cleaned fur...&quot;<br />
<br />
The question seemed more of a formality as Brandon excitedly set himself on Kevins cock. The tounge wrapped around Kevin&#39;s length and began to knead his member up and down, each motion squeezing a shot of pre from the tip. Brandon&#39;s own cock began to dribble in excitement.<br />
<br />
Kevin&#39;s face contorted into a look of confused pleasure. It felt good. Brandon was skilled, as if innately devoted to the craft of serving. Yet....it was wrong.<br />
<br />
.....Wrong.<br />
<br />
Clarity began to return once more<br />
<br />
WRONG. THIS IS ALL WRONG !<br />
<br />
In an instant, Kevin pushed the ape of his cock and dashed out of the room.<br />
<br />
<br />
Silence filled the air.<br />
<br />
Brandon was taken aback, cock still hard and desire unfulfilled he nonetheless straighten himself and regained his composure. It would be improper for Marcus to see him any other way.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all for now Brandon, you can retire to tend to your own affairs if you like&quot; Marcus said, recognizing Brandon&#39;s need for closure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good sir&quot; Brandon replied, his cock eagerly twitching in anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about Kev. He&#39;ll be fine by the evening; he just needs to collect his thoughts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chatter quickly picked up once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, where was I&quot; resumed Marcus &quot;Mustang Token, now THAT&#39;s a coin I could get excited about...&quot;</p>
