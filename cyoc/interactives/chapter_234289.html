<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What was once a fancy BMW sedan with a shiny silver color is now a clown car sedan half its size colored a bright red with white wheel rims and white polka dots all over it. It pulled into a parking spot at the branch of a countrywide hotel chain. The space was much too big for the car of course, but the doors opened and out stepped four auguste clowns with white filling the hollows of their eyes and white muzzles around their mouths . It was the Wainwrites and they had just undergone an extreme and joyful transformation.<br />
<br />
The first was the father Bill Wainwrite. He was now twice his weight with a round, jolly physique. His skin was now a yellow-orange contrasting sharply with the white on his face. He had eyebrows that were black, large, with round edges, and arched high on his forehead, topping the white patches that streched from the hollows of his eyes. A thin line of red blush surrounded his muzzle, which had inside a black clown smile that stretched down to his chin. His original black hair in a short style, was now a bright red=orange color and stretched around his head at ear level but the rest was a large bald pate. At the very center of Mr. Waintrites face his nose was red, round, and nearly as big as a peach.<br />
<br />
Bill now wore a baggy tuxedo-style suit that hung loosely even on his large body. The pants and jacket were red, the vest blue, and the shirt yellow, with a puffy bow tie with stripes in all three colors. On his hands were immaculate yellow gloves. Finally on his feet were a pair of yellow and red clown shoes that now fit his now clown feet that were longer and much wider. The final bit was ared derby hat with a blue band and yellow flower one third too small for him, that was on his bald head.<br />
<br />
Out he stepped in the car and chuckled. “Hyuck Hyuck, here we are. The hotel for the night.” HONK HONK!<br />
<br />
The passenger seat door opened and out stepped another clown, at first just her large shoes but soon the visage of a clown woman and mother popped out. It was Sarah Wainwrite and like her husband she was now an auguste clown. Her entire body, at least what was not covered by her new clowny clothes, was now sugar-pink. Her face makeup was elegant; beginning inside her white muzzle  her lower lip was bright red and curled up into dainty clown smile. Her eyebrows above the white patches were black arches that curved over her forehead, and her eyelids were shaded light blue. Her eyelashes were now double their size and there was a slight blush on her cheeks. Sarah’s hair, which had once been a simple brunette color, was now bright red, and in a very bushy afro-style. Her new outfit however was what really made her stand out and look funny.<br />
<br />
Sarah was now in a skirted dress that stretched down to her knees and fluffed up with white petticoats. It was an elaborate dress with the skirt separated into three sections each separated by a ruffle hem. The bottom layer was a lime green, the next one up was pink with orange stripes, and the last which connected to her waist was her bright red like her hair. A matching pair of bloomers and knee length socks with stripes like her skirt adorned her legs. The cuffs on her sleeves were bright green, the sleeves and back were white with orange stripes, and the front of the torso was bright red again. Her shoes were odd shaped red flat pumps with 8 inch wide pancake-toes that fit her new clown feet perfectly. The final change to the beautifully dressed clown mom was a somewhat small bright red ball for a clown nose. Only her jewelry was unchanged, she still wore her wedding ring, pearl necklace, and gold hooped earrings under her afro that gave her a somewhat 70&#39;s disco look.<br />
Sarah stood up completely and opened her white shawl with red polka dots and put it on her shoulder, looking cute and silly at the same time. “Looks great, this is the perfect place to spend the night. HEEHEE. Come on Jason, Jade, we need to check in.” She squeezed her nose.<br />
<br />
HONK! HONK!<br />
<br />
A clown boy climbed out of the tiny car, it was Jason and he had undergone a silly transformation just like his parents. He was now a jolly looking auguste clown teenage boy. He had not gained as much weight as his father-not fat but was definitely chubby. All of his skin except his facial marking was a darker pink than his mom&#39;s. His makeup was a bit simpler than his dad&#39;s but bolder than his mother&#39;s. He had rosy-red cheeks with three black dots for freckles in each. Black lines for eyebrows topped the white patches that stretched from the hollows of his eyes to his forehead, and his lower lip inside his white muzzle was red and curled into a happy clown  smile. Jason’s most iconic and funny change was the engulfing red hair at the back and sides of his head, it was so curly and thick that his ears were covered, while like his father the top of Jason&#39;s head was bald and smooth. The final touch was his bright red nose about the size of a golf ball which was perfectly placed on his face.<br />
 The casual jeans and shirt that he wore had changed into a baggy yellow buttoned shirt with an exaggerated collar and a puffy red bow tie, and baggy blue pants. On his shirt was a wide blue vest with a red flower on the left lapel; His shoes were size 17 red and yellow wing tips with 10 inch wide toes that curled slightly upward. On his bald pate was a yellow derby with a blue band, comically tiny and set off to a jaunty angle that completed his look perfectly. He looked a like goofy and silly teenage auguste clown. “Coming Mom. Hyuck! Hyuck!” the clown boy said in a deep and goofy voice.<br />
<br />
Lastly out popped a small clown girl, it was Jade, and she looked like the cutest clown girl possible. She was definitely the funniest looking of the Wainwrites. Like the rest of her family, she was an auguste clown, and her face was now adorned with red circles on her cheeks with freckles like her brother&#39;s. Her complexion was a peachy orange with green eyeshadow under the white patches over her eyelids, and small drawn black lines for eyebrows. The mouth inside Jade&#39;s white muzzle was a red cupid&#39;s bpw; on her red blush cheeks were black freckles like her brother&#39;s. She also had a red clown nose like everyone else, but it was the size of a ping pong ball. Jade&#39;s hair was a shade of orange going towards green at some point and was styled into two huge twin tails that were on the sides of her head. They were tied off with white ribbon bows.<br />
<br />
Jade&#39;s clothes had become an orange shirt and green coveralls that were covered with little pink polka dots. The dress was . She also had on matching knee socks that went into orange mary jane clown shoes with green saddles and bubble toes.<br />
<br />
“HeeHeeYaha! Calm down Mom. Its not night time yet. We can still have fun today.&quot; SQUEAK SQUEAK! went her red nose.<br />
<br />
“We have to check into the hotel sweetie. Hyuk Hyuk!” went Bill as he waddled to the trunk, and took out 4 wheeled suitcases all about the size of the small car. They were now color coded for each member of the family. Sarah took hers and said, “I knew this vacation would be a lot of fun. Let&#39;s check into our rooms and then go explore here.” Honk! The other three clowns all squeezed their red noses in response and agreement, and so the Wainwrite family, now all zany auguste clowns, waddled into their hotel aware of what had happened but too excited and happy to care.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
“This is the greatest thing you&#39;ve ever done Ken.&quot; HONK! HONK! &quot;There&#39;s no way I could have ever thought of this.” Jeff said that as the two friends continued to drive around their hometown of Frostyville. Their small car putted around with their pink, joy and silliness bringing exhaust behind them. Around them there was a growing amount of clown cars, unicycles riders, and clown patrons waddling around town. They were going into stores, eating in restaurants, and enjoying the sunshine that was all around them clowns of all ages and colors were waddling about. Several humans who were bewildered or who were smiling at their new silly people, unware that they themselves were gradually turning into clowns as well. Two women that they passed Ken and Jeff recognized as local call girls as the two boys passed them and engulfed them in pink smoke they emerged as clowns.<br />
<br />
The first call girl was now a sexy looking whiteface clown. Her entire complexion was milky white from head to her now oversized toes<br />
with a red nose, white makeup around her eyes, and a white muzzle around her mouth with pink blush on her cheeks and a red smile on her lips. Her hair was now rainbow colored and curled into a bushy afro, her original cocktail dress was now a green bodice with various colored pom-poms running down the middle and a white ruffled lace color around her neck. Her nails were painted in the colors of her hair, on her feet were strange bubble toes spiked heels, and at the center of her face her nose was a red pall nearly the size of a peach and covered with sparkling glitter. A green feather bola was draped around her shoulders. <br />
<br />
The other prostitute became a gothic looking bag lady. had originally been wearing a blouse and hot pants, but now she was also wearing a black cocktail dress with a patchwork motif. Her shoes were now black mary janes that were triple her original feet size. The bag lady&#39;s black hair had not changed color but had become much more voluminous on her head and had greyish streaks in it and she were a small black bowler hat. Her face was covered in white makeup around her eyes with grayish eye shadow and long curly black eyelashes, and formed a white “heart” around her mouth, her lips now seemed to be coated in black lipstick, and finally her nose had become a dull red ball. Around her shoulder was a tattered gray shawl.<br />
 The two clowned hookers stumbled for a moment and then got their bearings. “Holy crap.” the whiteface said in a goofy voice that sounded like she was breathing helium. &quot;We&#39;re clowns! And so are so many other people here now!&quot;<br />
 &#39;<br />
“This is amazing!” the bag lady said in a squeaky and happy voice, and they both continued waddling into town now laughing and smiling at their new appearances. Something else occurred to the bag lady. &quot;Are we on drugs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; A tiny pink dragon wearing a top hat suddenly appeared before the two of them. &quot;Yes, you gals both are, from what you spent from the last pair of johns you had. But you two really did turn into clowns, and so is everyone else in this town. And now, I&#39;m scheduled to appear before a school bus driver in Springfield!&quot; And with that the drug induced hallucination vanished, and the two newly clowned call girls waddled about, looking for new customers.<br />
<br />
-----------  <br />
<br />
“You should know I added a few minor things before I went into that first convenience store, heeheeyahah.” Ken said that as he chuckled and gazed at the town. Jeff was driving down the streets.<br />
<br />
“What did you include?” HONK! HONK! Jeff said as he came to a stop at an intersection with a red light. Behind him was a huge black pickup truck while next to them was the bright pink clown car SUV. Newly clowned children and their mother could be heard inside honking their noses and laughing.<br />
<br />
“Well…I made sure that everyone enjoys being a clown regardless of the type or their new body shapes. They all remember being human but they enjoy this even more.&quot; HONK! HONK! &quot;Also, I altered everyone&#39;s personalities a bit, making it so everyone is 10% braver…and the sex drives of teenagers and older are boosted by 10%. HeeHeeYaYa.” Ken said that as he smiled mischievously and laughed. Jeff could help but grin and be super excited at this new revelation. &quot;On top of all that, anyone who hasn&#39;t undergone the change will change a lot faster if they have sex with someone who has, like those two hookers!&quot;<br />
<br />
“That is the cherry on top of all this Ken, I think that was genius!&quot; HONK! &quot;Or better yet, that&#39;s the cherry on top of the cream pie! So where should we go next? “We still have plenty of time in the day, heeheeyaha.&quot; Honk Honk!<br />
<br />
Ken thought for a moment, and brought his hand to his chin in an exaggerated thinking pose. Suddenly he had a great idea and snapped his fingers in excitement. &quot;Lets drive to…”</p>
