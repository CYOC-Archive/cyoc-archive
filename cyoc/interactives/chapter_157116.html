<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the roof most of the staff and faculty that had been regressed had collected... except for the Principal... John asked everyone &quot;Anyone see Principal Abet?&quot; <br />
John&#39;s mother Cindy responded &quot;No idea Hon, but she should show up eventually. That said I think most of us would like to get home and they&#39;ll need to be a bit older to drive.&quot; <br />
John nodded and said &quot;Listen up, in a few seconds most of you are going to start growing really fast. The sensation of going through puberty in a second is a little bit weird, but it&#39;s nothing to worry about. Just your body going through natural changes.&quot; <br />
Alexis sighed and said &quot;We&#39;ve already been taught the birds and the bees, just turn us back alright?&quot; <br />
Madame now Miss Silvia asked &quot;Since this Chronos thing is probably not a secret... could I stay like this actually? I&#39;d rather not waste this youth and going back to my withering old arthritis stricken body doesn&#39;t sound nice.&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Alright, I wont meanwhile for the rest of you.&quot; The assortment of children and teens re-aged back into adults, and while regressing was odd the feeling of rapid puberty was also odd. The staff that had been playing &quot;tag&quot; with Yumi were also feeling their legs ache a bit from the strenuous &quot;exercise&quot;  <br />
Alexis stretched her regular body and said &quot;Well it was nice being 16 again, but this feels right as well.&quot; <br />
Silvia chuckled and said &quot;I think this feels more right than being over 80. Want to go out drinking colleague?&quot; <br />
Alexis said &quot;Sure, sounds fun... I&#39;ll just text Abet to schedule a meeting with Jane...&quot; and then most of the staff went back to their homes or whatever else they had planned that day. The only one who was uneasy was John, the principal was probably one of the smallest of all the regressed staff... and she wasn&#39;t around even now... <br />
The school intercom&#39;s activated and Yumi&#39;s voice came out &quot;A black haired little girl with pigtails named Lauren has been caught running around school for hours. She is currently at the main office. If her guardian is listening to this please pick her up.&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Welp, Yumi found the Principal... Shall we go mom?&quot; Cindy nodded and then left for the office. <br />
<br />
At the office they found that Yumi had put Principal Abet in a chair and had her facing a corner of the room. The little Principal was pouting and visibly upset, and the teenage Yumi looked rather sweaty from all the chasing.<br />
Yumi said &quot;Ah, Ms. Mavis and the new girl right? What have you come to the main office for?&quot;  <br />
John said &quot;The Principal that you have in the corner there.&quot; <br />
Yumi was confused &quot;The little Toddler there?&quot; said Toddler started blushing a bit... She had been in a rather childish mindset for awhile... and would probably have a lot to explain to Yumi... and everyone else. <br />
John said &quot;I know you got here late, but weren&#39;t you in a class after lunch?&quot; <br />
Yumi asked &quot;And why would that matter?&quot; with a bit of shame as she was chasing kids all day and kinda forgot about classes. <br />
John said &quot;Most of the staff became younger today. Most children.&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;Yes, John got turned into a Priestess of Chronos or something and... Jane why don&#39;t you do your thing?&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Sure&quot; at which point the tired teenage Yumi started shrinking. Clearly she was shocked as her chest went from a mountain to a flat plain. <br />
The now girl squeaking out &quot;Why is everything getting bigger?!?&quot; as she was getting progressively smaller. Even Principal Abet got out of her corner as she watched the teenager who had oppressed her shrink even smaller than the 4 year old. Not that much younger maybe 3 or so, but rather small. Cindy got out her compact again and showed Yumi her childish reflection. <br />
Cindy said &quot;Something John, now Jane, can no do that she&#39;s the Priestess of Chronos. While I had imagined she would&#39;ve made Principal Abet back to normal messing with people&#39;s ages is just something she can do.&quot; <br />
Yumi thought a bit with her now toddler mind and said &quot;But then...&quot; She turned to now the small child who was bigger than her and accused &quot;Your Principal Abet and you&#39;ve been making me chase you around school ALL Day!&quot; The Principal was for sure a bit red in the face. John decided to grow Principal Abet back up and Yumi was able to see that child mature from the girl she was into a nervous teenager and then a bit of an ashamed adult. <br />
Lauren Abet sighed and said &quot;Well Jane the paperworks done... Ugh, I&#39;m really feeling all that running.&quot; <br />
Small Yumi asked &quot;Wait, who was your accomplice though?&quot; <br />
Lauren groaned and said &quot;You know as a kid I wasn&#39;t even thinking about who she was or... No idea, and now we have a missing kid... Jane do you know if she was an actual kid or was it one of the staff or a student or someone?&quot;<br />
John thought and having the little girl described said &quot;That&#39;s probably Vicki... She was about to beat me up so I regressed her and she ran off before I could change her back.&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;We need to find her fast. If you&#39;re not sure what&#39;s going on being turned that young can be really scary. She&#39;s probably not even in her normal state of mind.&quot; <br />
John asked &quot;Any idea where she could be Principal?&quot; <br />
Lauren sighed trying to remember and said &quot;We were running... somewhere... and once when I turned back she wasn&#39;t there. I think I just thought she tried turning somewhere. Yumi you were the one chasing us did you see where she went?&quot;<br />
Yumi said &quot;I was tired and just chasing after you mostly... I didn&#39;t notice...&quot; <br />
Cindy sighed and said &quot;Alright, we don&#39;t know where she is but we need to go around and try to search for Vicki. We&#39;ll make an announcement for a lost child and someone should probably see her.&quot; <br />
Yumi thought &quot;...I was chasing her so much... It&#39;s possible if I found her she&#39;d just run away from me.&quot; <br />
John thought and said &quot;I was the one who shrunk her so... probably the same for me.&quot; <br />
Lauren took a seat and said &quot;I can barely walk... much less search for a small child.&quot; <br />
Cindy sighed and said &quot;Then I guess i&#39;ll just need to cover more ground. Jane call me if someone comes with Vicki.&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Before you go let me give you a little boost.&quot; <br />
Cindy felt herself getting younger and quickly said &quot;But I don&#39;t want to be a child right now!&quot; before noticing she still had breasts after her regression had ended. For sure smaller breasts, but instead of being the middle aged lady she used to be she now was her teenage self in an old uniform from her old girl&#39;s only school. <br />
Cindy giggled and said &quot;Yeah, this should do! Thanks, see you two when I find Vicki.&quot; The adults were gone leaving Yumi and John in the main office alone with the janitor probably cleaning elsewhere in the school. <br />
Yumi looked so sad as such a small child mumbling to herself &quot;What do I do? This is my fault...&quot; <br />
John sat next to Yumi and said &quot;Calm down. When we find her you can apologize...&quot; then thinking started shrinking herself down. It was interesting and reminded her a bit of being a guy again... More from the lack of a weight on her chest than having anything swinging down there. A little girl to help another little girl calm down. &quot;How about we look at each other at the same level?.. although I think I may be slightly taller.&quot; <br />
Yui chuckled a bit and said &quot;Reminds me a little back when we were... well this young.&quot; <br />
<br />
The search had taken a little longer than expected and the Sun had gone down, and the two toddlers were taking a small nap in the office chairs. Kathy had gone to the office looking for John and Yumi. A bit to help out Cindy and a bit to get John to reage her and then regress her when she put on her suit that was once her school uniform. Kathy thought the two little girls sleeping next to each other were cute and took a picture with her phone and then said &quot;Wakey Wakey Kids!&quot; The two kids woke up confused and then continued &quot;So Jane, your mother found Vicki. Called her parents and now is going to have a sleep over at your home. We&#39;ll have to reschedule that clothes shopping, but we though it could be a little fun and be a good way to calm Vicki down. Heck she even let my little sister Jess and Naomi (Yumi&#39;s little sister) come over as well.&quot; Kathy took the two kids back to the Mavis household in her beat up clunker so they could get to the sleepover.</p>
