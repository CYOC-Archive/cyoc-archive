<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After finally managing to pull herself away from Ryan, Claire made her way to the hospital and went in through the front door. It was fortunate that the hospital was open 24 hours a day, especially given the local populace. She was greeted by the local receptionist who was sitting near the entrance. The receptionist looked up from her computer screen and asked, &quot;Can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, um...&quot; Claire started, feeling a little embarrassed by having to ask things like this. She took a deep breath and continued, &quot;I need to get some birth control pills. For weres.&quot;<br />
<br />
The receptionist looked at Claire and studied her for a moment. &quot;I see,&quot; the receptionist said. &quot;Wait here for a moment.&quot; She pressed a button to the intercom and said, &quot;Paging Dr. Kent. Paging Dr. Kent. You have a patient.&quot; She motioned towards a bunch of chairs and said, &quot;Have a seat. The doctor will be here shortly.&quot; Claire sat down and nervously waited for the doctor to appear.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before a man with black curly hair entered into the area and asked, &quot;I&#39;m Dr. Kent. Is there someone to see me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire figured it was for her, so she stood up and said, &quot;I guess I am. I&#39;m Claire Robertson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Ms. Robertson. Good to you meet you. I&#39;m Dr. Kent.&quot; He stuck out his to shake hers, and the two shook. &quot;Could you follow me please to my office?&quot; The two walked to his office, and after both of them entered, he closed the door. &quot;So, how can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; her face reddened as she started to speak. &quot;I need some birth control pills.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Dr. Kent said as he took a close sniff of her. &quot;Thinking about joining a group are you? Werewolf I take it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weretiger, actually. How did you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I happen to be a were myself. Werehorse to be exact. I can tell by your scent that you&#39;re still normal, and that by your desire to have birth control pills, it sounds like you&#39;re ready to join a group. And by the smell of things, you&#39;ve been very close to a werewolf not too long ago.&quot; Claire&#39;s face reddened even further as she remembered the situation not too long ago. Dr. Kent cleared his throat and said, &quot;It&#39;s okay, dear. I&#39;m a professional, and you have nothing to be embarrassed about. Frankly, you&#39;re fortunate that you&#39;re not like the last woman to change to a were (referring to Yvette and Jenny), and the weretigers are a good group to join.&quot; Dr. Kent made a few notes on his pad before turning to Claire and said, &quot;Now, I&#39;ll need to draw some of your blood to do a few tests. Could you roll up the sleeves of your shirt for me?&quot; Claire rolled up her left sleeve of her shirt while Dr. Kent pulled out a hypodermic needle and some vials. After rubbing her skin with some alcohol, he drew some of her blood into the vial. He put a small bandage on the needle mark and then said, &quot;Okay, I&#39;m going to run some tests, and if everything checks out fine, I can get you a prescription. For now, you can wait here.&quot; With that, he left the room leaving Claire by herself.<br />
<br />
It was 15 minutes of waiting and Claire had much to think about. It was only a few nights ago that she ran into Eric and Cassie, and discovered the truth of weres. At the time, she didn&#39;t know what to think what they were. Her mind didn&#39;t want to believe what she saw but after a couple of days in jail and seeing the Twists change to werecats, she had to believe. She was almost forced to join if it weren&#39;t for Ryan speaking up for her. She remembered her first meeting with Ryan, and she was touched by his gentleness and kindness. The fact that he was a looker also helped. She couldn&#39;t quite pin it when she started to fall in love with him, but she was in love with him now. She looked back at the couple of close calls, and how they almost fell into their passionate throes. After she becomes a weretiger, then there&#39;ll be nothing to stop them for fulfilling their love for each other.<br />
<br />
Her mind also started to think about their future. She wanted to live a life with him, and that&#39;s why she was going were. It just it was her choice to become a weretiger because of their beauty and power. But her mind also had worries. There was a bit of uncertainty to her future. She dreamed as a young woman to go around the world and explore new places. Take pictures of animals never seen before. That&#39;s why she came to Moon Lake after all. And what would her family think? Would she be able to see her parents and brothers again? Would they accept the new her?<br />
<br />
Claire&#39;s thoughts were interrupted by the opening of the door and the entrance of Dr. Kent. &quot;Ms. Robertson,&quot; he said as he sat down in his chair. &quot;I did some bloodwork, and it looks like you&#39;ll be fine to take these pills.&quot; Claire exhaled as he continued. &quot;Now, let me give you some instructions. These pills are designed for weretigers, and only weretigers. Now, seeing as you haven&#39;t changed yet, I must caution you that if you join another were-group, such as that werewolf out there, then these pills will be useless, and you will need another prescription for werewolf birth control pills, or maybe get a pregnancy test.&quot; Claire nodded as she understood this. &quot;Take one pill every 24 hours. The effects last for about 24 hours, and after that, you&#39;ll have a chance of getting pregnant if you have sex after that. The likelihood increases further past that point, and at about 36 hours, the odds of you getting pregnant is 100%. If you do decide that you want to get pregnant, just stop taking the pills, and wait about 48 hours. These pills were designed to stop weretigresses from ovulating when they have sex, so keep that in mind.&quot; Claire&#39;s eyes started to glaze over as Dr. Kent started to get a bit technical. He cleared his throat again and simply said, &quot;Just take one every 24 hours, and you&#39;ll be fine. Do you have any questions for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Claire responded, &quot;How long should I wait between taking my first pill and joining the group?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes, I knew I forgot something,&quot; Dr. Kent replied. &quot;I would suggest a half-hour to allow the drugs to get into your system. After that, you should be good to join without the risk of pregnancy. Oh, and don&#39;t worry about the cost of this bottle. The first bottle is free for those who are normal and joining a weregroup. Just remember what I said, and keep in mind that you have unlimited refills with these drugs.&quot; He handed Claire the bottle of blue pills and said, &quot;I would recommend taking one right now before going back to the weretiger pride meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know? Know what, never mind. It&#39;s probably best that I don&#39;t know. Thank you, doctor.&quot; Claire said as she hugged the doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure,&quot; Dr. Kent said back. &quot;Be safe out there.&quot; With that, Claire left the room with the bottle in hand. Once she was down the hall, she took a look at the bottle. She read the label, &quot;Claire Robertson. Weretiger birth control pills. Take with water, and one every 24 hours.&quot; After looking for a water fountain, she opened the bottle and pulled out one of the little blue pills. This was it. The start of her transformation. She took a deep breath, put the pill in her mouth, and drank some water. She stood up straight, and waited for something to happen. Yet, she didn&#39;t feel any different. After shrugging and making a mental note of Dr. Kent&#39;s recommendations, she made her way out to the parking lot where Ryan was waiting for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it that things were successful?&quot; Ryan asked as he climbed into the car. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I got the pills,&quot; Claire responded as she help up the bottle of pills. &quot;I already took one as I was walking out. So I should be good when I get there and ready to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan smiled and said, &quot;And then afterwards, we can have some fun.&quot; Claire rolled her eyes and thought, &#39;Men&#39;. Still, she was also looking forward to the night&#39;s activities. It didn&#39;t take long for Ryan and Claire to drive back to where the weretigers were meeting. They could see the weretigers milling around eating the refreshments and drinking the punch. Claire took a deep breath, as she realized that this was it. Before the night was over, she wouldn&#39;t be normal anymore. As she climbed out of the car, Ryan called out to her. She stopped as she listened to him. &quot;I just want to say something before you go. I love you, and I want you to be in my life. We can talk more when you&#39;re done, but I just wanted to let you know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire smiled at him and gave him a kiss. &quot;I&#39;ll be back, and we definitely can talk more when I get back. Now be a good wolf, and wait for me.&quot; The two shared a second kiss before Claire climbed out of the car and headed towards to pavillion that the weretigers were meeting. <br />
<br />
She was greeted by Bob as she walked in. &quot;Claire!&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;m glad you could make it back.&quot; Claire could notice that Bob&#39;s erection was coming back. &quot;So, I take it that you got things cleared away?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I&#39;ve just recently taken the pill, so I&#39;m not quite ready yet.&quot; Claire responded, her eyes not quite leaving Bob&#39;s body. Bob smiled as he noticed this. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a good thing,&quot; a voice from behind them said. They turned and noticed Mr. Jackson, the head of the weretiger pride. &quot;We do have our ceremony to attend to, after all.&quot; Bob looked a bit sheepish as he heard this. His libido got ahead of his brain again. Mr. Jackson smiled and said, &quot;Claire Robertson, I assume? I hear you want to join our pride.&quot; Claire nodded as she shook his hand. She could feel the leather pads at the bottom of his hands and the claws, although the claws didn&#39;t quite break her skin. &quot;Well, then, you are welcome to join, but first, you&#39;ll need to do a few things. Now, I take it that you&#39;ve already taken your weretiger birth control pills?&quot; She nodded in agreement. &quot;Great, now then, you&#39;ll need to discard your clothing. We weretigers have nothing to hide, and by removing our clothing, we show it to our pride.&quot; Claire&#39;s face reddened again as she heard this. Mr. Jackson pulled out a white robe and said, &quot;You can wear this to keep you warm, seeing as you don&#39;t have your fur yet, but you&#39;ll need to take this off when we start our ceremony.&quot; Claire slowly took the robe, but she was still a bit embarrassed by it all. Seeing naked people was hard but being naked herself was something else. Still, it had to be done. &quot;Do you have any questions for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...how long do we have before the ceremony?&quot; Claire asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;d say about 20 minutes from now. Your birth control should kick in before then, so you should be safe to change afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; Claire responded. &quot;I don&#39;t have any further questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; Mr. Jackson responded. &quot;I&#39;ll see you later tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Mr. Jackson left the two and then Bob said, &quot;Well, I guess I&#39;ll have to wait. You know what they say about waiting. Anyway, I&#39;ll help you any way that I can, so if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.&quot; Bob left Claire to go mingle somewhere else, leaving Claire alone. <br />
<br />
Claire felt a little bit more apprehensive about this, but at the same time, she knew she wanted to do this. She took a deep breath as she went out into the woods a little bit, where no one would see her. She looked at the white robe handed to her by Mr. Edwards, and took another deep breath. She put the robe down, and started to unbutton her shirt again. After she unbuttoned her shirt all the way, she took a third deep breath and slipped it off her shoulders, exposing her breasts to the world. She wanted to cover herself up, but she fought that instinct, and instead went for her pants. She unbuttoned her pants, but before she pulled them down, she also took the time to take her shoes and socks off first. She then stood up, and in one go, dropped her pants and panties to the ground. She stepped out of them and she took a look at herself. She was completely naked at this point, and a bit embarrassed. She grabbed the white robe and wondered if she should put it on. As embarrassed as she was by all of this, she knew that she would have to start getting comfortable being around naked people, and being naked herself. Deciding against putting on the white robe, at least for now, she gathered her clothes and robe, and made her way down to the pavillion, both naked and a bit bashful. She&#39;s never let anyone see her completely naked like this.<br />

Author&#39;s note: I used Mr. Edwards instead of Mr. Jackson as the head of the pride.  This is what happens when you get too many characters in your story...</p>
