<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel found a book laying face down in the package and picks it up.  She turns the book over and is immediately surprised by the title.  <br />
<br />
RACHEL IN WONDERLAND<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would someone write an Alice story starring me.&quot;  Rachel thought to herself.  Curiosity about this strange gift lead to Rachel walking over to her bed, laying down on her front facing the wall and opening the book.  Rachel couldn&#39;t find the author&#39;s name or any other information about the book in its white pages besides the story itself, so she starts reading it.  <br />
&quot;Rachel Clark woke up to the sound of her alarm clock going off as it always did this time of day.  She was a fairly attractive young woman, just turned eighteen a few days ago and fresh out of High School.  Part of her wished she was still in school though, lately her life had fallen into a rut.  It was the same thing every day, getting up at 8am, helping her mom around the house, getting on the internet to chat with friends, going shopping for little things and then going to bed.  Rachel longed for a change from her boring routine with every fiber of her being.  Little did she know her wish was about to come true..&quot;  Rachel read out loud.  As she read, Rachel quickly realized to her shock that the story was giong over everything that had happened to her today.  From hearing the knocks on the door, finding the package, seeing the Alice outfit, going to her room, wearing said outfit, to discovering the book and reading from it.  <br />
&quot;How could anyone possibly know what was gonna happen to me today.  Could this book really be magic?&quot;  Rachel thought to herself as she kept reading out loud.  <br />
&quot;As Rachel read, she soon became aware that the words were getting smaller and smaller, making it difficult to keep reading.&quot;  And indeed, the words were gradually shrinking as the story went on.  But Rachel, consumed by her curiosity, began to focus on the tiny printing and kept reading.  She had to know what was going to happen to her next.  <br />
&quot;Rachel began concentrating on story with all her might as words continued to shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink...&quot;  As Rachel read, she found the words easier to read but still had to focus on them as they continued to get smaller.  Unaware to Rachel who was too preoccupied with the shrinking text, her entire body along with the Alice outfit she was still wearing were shrinking as well.  With each &quot;shrink&quot; she read, the smaller she got.  Soon Rachel body layed on top of the whole page, but she was still focused on reading this book and unintentionally making herself even smaller.  Eventually shrinking below the written text itself. <br />
&quot;And shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink until Rachel was small enough to enter her very own Wonderland.&quot;  <br />
&quot;Wait, What does that mean?&quot;  Rachel suddenly realized she was no longer laying on her bed or in her room.  Rachel gets up, unintentionally straightening her dress and apron, and finds herself in an vast white area with nothing in sight.  <br />
&quot;Where the heck am I?  HELLO, IS ANYONE HERE.&quot;  Rachel shouts to whoever can hear her, but gets no response.  <br />
&quot;Well this is bizarre.  One minute I&#39;m in my room reading a story about me and my day, the next thing I know I&#39;m here in this strange place with absolutely-  OH MY GOODNESS!  Wait did I really just say that?&quot;  Rachel looks up and sees large black shapes floating several feet above her.  As she observes the objects closely, Rachel suddenly recognizes them.  <br />
&quot;Those are the words I was just reading, only backwards.  But why would there be the exact same words I had spent so much effort to read hovering in the air above me but backwards ... and ... a lot ... bigger.&quot;  Rachel then realizes the white area she was in was the same white as the pages she had been reading from and came to the only possible conclusion to her predicament.  <br />
&quot;When I read the word shrink, I shank as well.  And with each smaller shrink I read ... oh my goodness ... and now I am actually standing inside the book itself.  I am most certainly part of this story now.  What an extraordinary situation I have stumbled upon- WHY AM I TALKING LIKE THIS?  Seriously, why am I speaking like some proper well-behaved young lady from the 1800s?  A well-behaved ... little girl ... just like ... Alice!&quot;   Despite what has happened to her, Rachel couldn&#39;t help but smile at the idea of taking on the mental thoughts and characteristics of miss Alice herself.  Deep down, Rachel had wanted to be exactly like Alice her whole life but could never be given the chance to do so untill now.  So Rachel closed her eyes and embraced the changes, allowing herself to truly become Alice.  <br />
&quot;Goodbye old Rachel, hello Alice Rachel.   Though prehaps to be more precise, a Rachel with an Alice like personality but still addresses herself as Rachel or addressed from another individual as Miss Rachel.  Oh dear, this might take some getting use to.&quot;  <br />
When she was certain the transformation was finished, Rachel opened her eyes and immediately felt much more like a proper (and extremely curious) young lady.  The very idea of talking back to anyone of a higher social standing than her own was something she could never bring herself to do now.  After Rachel adjusted to her new way of thinking, she hear someone muttering behind her and turns around to find The White Rabbit in his red waistcoat with grey trousers looking at his watch.  <br />
&quot;Oh dear, oh dear, how late it is.&quot;  The White Rabbit said as he take off and dives into a large brightly lit and decorated hole in the ground that wasn&#39;t ther before.  Rachel, with her new Alice personality, walked towards the hole while feeling compeled to follow The White Rabbit and was now incapable of stopping herself from doing it.  <br />
&quot;I really should not be doing this. After all I have not been invited to join him.  And it would very rude of me to leave everything I knew behind.  But I have allowed myself to fully become Alice, oops I mean, Rachel in Wonderland, and I can not stop the story now and never get a gift like this again.  I do not care what happens, I have to know where Mr. Rabbit will lead me to next.&quot;  Rachel then jumps feet first down the hole and after a short fall-<br />
KAPOOF<br />
Rachel&#39;s skirt opens up and expands like a parachute, gently floating her down the rabbit hole and into Wonderland.  Admiring the decorations around her for a bit, Rachel looks down at her dress and smiles at her perfect magical gift, thinking of all the adventures she&#39;ll have with it.  <br />
&quot;Well, after this I shalt think nothing of fal-&quot;  Rachel&#39;s apron covers he mouth before she coud finish her sentance.  Straightening it back to position, Rachel concludes with:  <br />
&quot;Of falling down stairs.&quot;</p>
