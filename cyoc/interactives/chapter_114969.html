<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Frances opened the door after hearing a knock at the door, she was surprised to see Martha and William Anderson outside. Escorting them in just as everyone was about ti sit down for dinner; Frances could tell Martha was feeling embarrassed.<br />
“I didn’t realize you were about to have supper,” Martha trying to mumble an apology; “We can come back later.”<br />
“It’s okay,” Frances showing a friendly face; “we can always order a pizza to go with the beef broccoli Samantha made.&quot;<br />
“Now that is a meal sis,” Samson getting up from the sofa he was sitting on.<br />
<br />
Martha seeing the bare chested man approach; a little surprised to see his arm in a sling. Frances quickly introduced her brother Samson to William and Martha. Each smelling that the other was a were; Martha and William were were-foxes. Samson Carter a were-dog but with a rather curious scent; Samson explained that his fursona was based off that of an Alaskan malamute.<br />
Everyone in my family is a were-dog,” Samson explaining; “except Frances here.”<br />
“Please,” Frances sighing at her brother; “no need to dredge up personal family history.”<br />
“Frances,” Samantha speaking up; “We already told the Anderson’s how you became a were-cat. So it’s not as if Samson here is doing any dredging.”<br />
<br />
France looked at Samantha as she got Alex and Ben’s help to put the table out and put in an expansion panel; adding extra room to the table. Frances remembered the time she and Samantha made out; back when she was twelve. Not realizing that she became a were-cat then and there until after her first transformation two years later. A surprise that her father Joseph and mother Angelica where not eager to deal with at the time. Joseph, enraged that his daughter was a Lesbian, kicked Frances out; it was only through the kindness of Samantha’s mother that Frances was able to make it through those difficult few years.<br />
“I’d rather not have it as dinner conversation,” Frances responding as she led the Anderson’s to the table; “so let’s not have that talk right now.”<br />
“All right,” Samantha walking back into the kitchen; Ben, think you can order a pizza to go with dinner?”<br />
“On it,” Ben grabbing the phone hanging off his lanyard; “one large, no make it two large meat lovers coming up.”<br />
<br />
William and Martha sitting down at the table could see that Ben and Alex where the only ones in their fursona. Detecting the faint musky smell of sex off them, it was clear the two lovers recently had a little afternoon delight of their own.<br />
“So what made you decide to come over here un-expectantly,” Frances looking at the Anderson.<br />
<br />
“We had a fun morning,” William grinning slyly; “let’s just say with the were-club shut down with the were-alert going on, some of the swingers got together and had an impromptu basement fun at the Hales.”<br />
“They are part of our Den,” Martha speaking; “and can be quite voracious swingers.”<br />
“Like you two from what I here,” Samantha speaking as she returned with some fresh rolls; “there are a few in city hall and your names have come up from time to time.”<br />
“Blame Ben,” Martha chuckling; “he told us of the were-club’s existence back in December.”<br />
<br />
Everyone looks at Ben as he chokes on a roll he just grabbed with his paw; whining in embarrassment, Frances shows pity as she steers the conversation forward.<br />
“You didn’t spend the entire day at the Hales,” Frances speaking.<br />
“Only until around noon,” William speaking; “suffice to say, we arrived home and felt the need to continue the fun and then had a nap.”<br />
“So that was you making all that noise earlier,” Samson arching an eyebrow; “I didn’t know foxes could roar like that.”<br />
<br />
“No,” Martha coughing; “we took a walk while what you were hearing was Nate and his mate were rutting mad.”<br />
“Wolves don’t roar I believe,” Samson grabbing a roll and slicing it in half; “so who did Nate land for a girlfriend.<br />
“Jean Talbot,” Ben chiming in; “and she isn’t Nate’s girlfriend. They are mates.”<br />
“They had a were-wedding last Friday,” Alex adding; placing a paw on Ben’s thigh, waiting for the moment when they will have one themselves.<br />
“Oh,” Samantha looking surprised; “Leon’s daughter. Lucky him.”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” William speaking; “but that’s not the half of it. Just as we got home from our walk,” William taking a sip of water; “old man Johnson was banging on my front door complaining about the noise.”<br />
“I can talk to him,” Samson speaking; “set him straight to say the least.”<br />
“You’ll do nothing of the sort,” France looking at her brother; “you are on medical leave after getting shot this morning. Even Sheriff Cooper told you to rest up when he called.”<br />
“We’ll handle it,” William speaking; “I’m sure I can get my son and his wife to take it to the rec room from now on when they are home.”<br />
“Not while Eric is using it,” Martha adding; “you’re forgetting what greeted us as we opened the front door.”<br />
“Oh yeah,” William smiling; “Eric and his girls making the house ripe with their unique smell.”<br />
<br />
Everyone but Samson laughed as they all knew by now that when Eric was with Spencer and Frieda and they were rutting; it wasn’t long that when their scents combine during sex, that it acted as an aphrodisiac that drove other were’s mad with lust.<br />
“How is Eric feeling of late,” Frances changing the conversation; “after Saturday at the Knight Estate…”<br />
“When really haven’t talked to him,” William answering; “that night he really wasn’t in the mood to have a conversation with us. I suspect after having to kill a man,” William looking at the beef broccoli; “he was tired of talking about it.”<br />
“I was hoping to talk to him about it,” Frances answering; “see how is feeling after having a chance to calm down.”<br />
“You can try tomorrow,” Martha feeling hungry despite the late lunch; “we are having a family dinner tomorrow, your more than welcome to join us.”<br />
<br />
Frances nodded as she accepted the plate Samantha handed her with some beef broccoli; watching everyone get a portion and starting to eat. Frances felt like wanting to share her currently family issues with William and Martha; thinking better of it. As her mother is dealing with her own health issues and Ben and Samantha’s recent argument; Frances decided it was best to keep it in house for the time being.<br />
<br />
As everyone engaged in general small talk; William could feel Martha’s hand on his thigh squeezing it tightly. William looking at his wife, he could tell she had that desire with in her. After getting that strong desirable smell invading both of their nostrils; William knew it was only a matter of time before Martha decided to let her fursona out in a bid to have some more fun.<br />
“You know,” William speaking as everyone else was eating; “Martha did have an ulterior motive for coming over here.”<br />
“And what would that be,” Samantha looking at William.<br />
“My wife wants to play with you both,” William winking; feeling Martha now playing with his pants zipper in a bid to get at his well-endowed package. “I just hope the pizza gets here before we are finished the beef broccoli,” William looking at his wife and trying to stop her; “not while we are eating Martha.”<br />
“The basement is free,” Samantha looking at Martha; “and I’m sure Frances and I would love to have some foxy company.”<br />
“Before everyone here gives into their baser urges,” Samson looking embarrassed; “who is going to drive me home?”</p>
