<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking for other women to change into men, Ty heads to down to the track field. A practice meet is taking place today so he decides to have some fun here.<br />
<br />
Taking a seat at the front of the bleachers he scans the girl’s cross country team for someone to change. <br />
<br />
His eyes settle on a tall, dark haired girl, with a thin build and hardly any curves. Reading her mind, Ty discovered that her name was Jamie. <br />
<br />
She was 5’11 and had been teased most of her life for her lanky, boyish figure. At 18, she still wore a training bra. Her breasts had never grown past an AA cup and her hips were straight and narrow. Even her face looked somewhat masculine with a wide nose, thin lips and small eyes. Making matters worse, her Italian heritage caused her to grow dark body hair that she constantly had to shave. All this resulted in Jamie getting harassed  by her classmates for “looking like a guy”. She had joined the girl’s track team to prove herself. Her thin athletic build was perfect for running but that wasn’t good enough for Jamie now. She wanted to be stronger, faster ,and able to build more muscle than her female frame would let her. <br />
<br />
Ty, in his own way, granted her wish and watched as Jamie lined up with the whole track team for a warm up run around the field.<br />
<br />
The whistle blew, and Jamie took off as her changes started. She felt different. Like she had more endurance today. Jamie failed to notice as the shape of her body became more masculine. Her once thin frame grew wider as her shoulders broadened and her torso became more v shaped. Her thin arms and legs bulked up with muscle, well defined pecs emerged from her flat chest, and her midriff showed signs of developing into a set of washboard abs. <br />
<br />
She was running faster now. Her classmates were getting further and further behind. She was so excited about her improved performance on the track that she didn’t even notice as her body continued to change, each one bringing her closer to her new gender. Her black hair stopped trailing behind her as it receded into her head, leaving a manageable short cut in its place.<br />
<br />
Her shorts suddenly felt tight as a big Italian sausage grew between her legs. When Jamie went to adjust them, her hand rubbed against the front of her crotch, where she felt a healthy male bulge.<br />
<br />
Her eyes widened as the realization of what she’d just felt hit her. She looked down momentarily and almost screamed. She had a dick! The erect member making an obvious tent in her shorts. <br />
<br />
Her newly formed testicles started pumping   testosterone and adrenaline through her body. It felt...good? Really good! She kept running, going faster than she ever could before.<br />
<br />
Her crotch itched terribly as her body hair began to return with a vengeance. Her calves itched as a coating of curly black hairs inched its way up her carefully shaven legs. She reached down to scratch it, but stopped when she saw her hand. It was growing. She watched her hands become bigger and less dainty. The fine fuzz on her forearms thickened, becoming coarse and wiry as it spread down the back of her hands and on her knuckles. A dense patch of coal black hair started to sprout on her pecs, quickly spreading all over her torso and making her chest itch like crazy.<br />
<br />
Her clothes shifted, switching from a woman’s two piece track uniform to a man’s uniform. The fabric of her sports bra expanded downwards, hiding her increasingly hairy abs beneath a men’s tank top. Her tight shoes grew a few sizes to better accommodate her larger feet. The now overabundant hairs on Jamie’s chest grew above her collarbone, peeking out of her tank top like a furry shirt.<br />
<br />
Jamie could feel her face changing as she started her last lap. She put one of her rough hands on her face. Her hand brushed against thickening stubble while her jawline hardened beneath her meaty fingers. Her neck began to ache as it grew thicker and wider She realized her vocal chords were stretching, making her voice deeper. The changes slowed and the former girl finished transforming into a furry Italian man.<br />
<br />
Mr. Jameson, the track coach approached her.<br />
<br />
“Nice work Jamie! I think you just set a new record. Keep it up and you’re likely to make first in the division. “<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Jamie panted. Her voice now a deep, manly rumble. <br />
<br />
For the first time in her life, Jamie felt strong, confident, and proud of herself. She wasn’t Jamie the weak, girl anymore. She was Jamie, the headstrong, young man.<br />
<br />
As he walked past his team members, they all high-fived him. A few of the girl’s even bit  their lip as they shyly peeked a glance at his brazenly well-endowed crotch.<br />
<br />
No one seemed to notice anything different about Jamie. It was as if he had always been a guy. He still remembered his old life as a girl, but he also could recall memories from this new life as a boy. His childhood, his first shave, even the first time he had had sex. <br />
<br />
He felt his erection still throbbing as he walked. The rush of male hormones flooding Jamie’s body had made him incredibly horny. He needed some release.<br />
<br />
Jamie ran into the locker room and made a beeline to the bathroom. Once inside, he took off his track shirt and shorts and stood in front of a mirror in just his boxers. A young man who closely resembled Jamie stared back at him. The stubble on his face had filled in dramatically, becoming a full beard and he had even grown an inch or two, taller reaching the 6 foot mark.<br />
<br />
Jamie’s previous boyish facial features now fit his bearded, masculine, face perfectly. Instead of looking out of place, they made him look rugged and handsome. He had a feeling that this is what he would have looked like if he had been born a guy in the first place.<br />
<br />
Looking down at himself, there wasn’t an inch on his body where he hadn’t sprouted some black hairs. Even by his family’s hirsute standards, Jamie was exceptionally hairy for his age. <br />
<br />
His arms and legs received a generous coat of dark curls that grew from his fingers to his shoulder blades. Thick swirls of hair covered his chest like a rug and grew in an unbroken pelt down to his feet. It was hard for him to tell where the hair on his face ended and the hair on his chest began.<br />
<br />
He ran a meaty hand through the bushy black hairs of his beard, over the tufts that grew above his collar bone, and down through the dense fur on his chest. <br />
<br />
He looked at his erect manhood and slowly took off his boxer shorts. There was no beating around the literal bush. He was well hung, a trait which had earned him his nickname, “the Italian stallion”. Even in loose fitting track shorts, his fully erect, 8 inch manhood and hefty balls were almost impossible to miss. <br />
<br />
Like the old Jamie, he had been an early bloomer. But instead of being looked down on as a teen, he was envied. His oversized member and abundant body hair caused other guys to gawk whenever he showered for gym. <br />
<br />
Finished admiring his new body, Jamie went into one of the showers, turned the nozzle and let the water rush over him. His body hair got all matted making it look even darker and thicker than it was.<br />
<br />
He grabbed his big tool and began to stroke it. He was clumsy at first, but he quickly got the hang of it. Soon Jamie was rubbing one out like an experienced young man in his prime. Each pump of his girthy shaft sending a surge of pleasure through him unlike anything he had ever felt before. He could feel a pressure quickly rising inside himself. He shouted sharply as he came and his manhood erupted, coating the tile floor with his seed. Jamie moaned feeling his first male orgasm reach its end. He had just jerked off as a man and it felt great! <br />
<br />
Just when his head began to clear he thought he heard something.</p>
