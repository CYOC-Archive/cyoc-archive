<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I can&#39;t believe my uncle did this,&quot; Kari fumed as she and Genki traveled down a country road. &quot;When I see him....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Kari I&#39;m fine,&quot; Genki replied. Kari frowned, gazing at the bruised face of Genki. Fukushu had certainly gone to great lengths to test the three tail kitsune. After discovering that Genki was interested in Kari, Fukushu went to extreme measures to test the young kitsune&#39;s resolve. Now, the yellow kitsune sported numerous cuts and bruises, his cheeks swollen as he walked with a slight limp.<br />
<br />
&quot;You certainly don&#39;t look fine,&quot; Kari exclaimed. &quot;I don&#39;t know what got into him. It&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t dated guys before, he&#39;s never done anything like this in the past.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly Kari regretted her statement, watching as a sullen expression formed on Genki&#39;s face. &quot;It was nothing serious,&quot; she said quickly. &quot;Just boys...and it was only a few times, nothing lasting more than a year. We&#39;re....we&#39;re different. Our relationship....it feels.....different...more serious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe that&#39;s why Fukushu did what he did,&quot; Genki smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get cocky,&quot; Kari retorted, hiding a smirk. &quot;I like you Genki...I like you a lot, but I like you because you&#39;re so much different than any other kitsune I&#39;ve met. You&#39;re humble, kind, gentle. I&#39;ve met far too many humans and kitsune who try too hard to show off. Putting on this macho facade, trying to over compensate. You? You carry yourself with this quiet confidence and humility.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Genki grinned. &quot;I&#39;m just happy you actually think of me as dateable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari giggled, leaning on the yellow three tail, who winced slightly. There was a humble confidence to the intellectual kitsune. Something she rarely saw from the warriors and soldiers she had grown accustomed to seeing from the kitsune army. It&#39;s what attracted her to Genki, yet it also frightened Kari slightly. Always practical, the last thing she expected was to begin to fall in love with a kitsune.<br />
<br />
Approaching Genki&#39;s home, Kari began to take in the simple farm her possible boyfriend called home. Genki&#39;s family appeared to own a vegetable farm, various plants spread out across a several small fields. From what Kari could gather the farm was large enough to provide food for the family while providing enough extras for market. It meant that Genki&#39;s family lived a comfortable existence. One with simple, blue collar, provisions and nothing else. For the practical Kari, it was perfect.<br />
<br />
As they approached the small home, Kari watched as a seven tail vixen with yellow fur now exit onto the front porch, a small smile on her face as the young couple approached. &quot;Genki.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
The seven tail now slowly approached, a look of concern overtaking her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; she asked, gently touching her son&#39;s bruised face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tried out for the army,&quot; Genki joked. &quot;General Fukushu thinks it may not be the best use of my time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Genki&#39;s mother huffed in annoyance, rolling her eyes at her son&#39;s attempt at humor. Turning to Kari, she smiled, bowing slightly before the black furred kitsune.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be Kari,&quot; she said. &quot;Genki was nervous about introducing you to the family. I&#39;m Ikumi, his mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari offered a small smile, bowing before the vixen as Genki groaned slightly. &quot;Mom, I wasn&#39;t that nervous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please,&quot; Ikumi scoffed. &quot;You&#39;ve been pacing in your room since I asked you to invite this girl to dinner.&quot; Genki blushed, fidgeting in place as Ikumi turned to Kari. &quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you Kari. Genki has spoken so highly of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you ma&#39;am,&quot; Kari replied with a bow as the brown seven tail kitsune invited her into her home. Stepping inside, Kari now studied the quaint home carefully.<br />
<br />
From the outside, Genki&#39;s home appeared to be a simple one story farmhouse, something Kari confirmed as she entered. A large kitchen resided to the left, a kitchen table with quaint, hand carved chairs. Kari could smell an extravagant meal cooking on the stove as two other kitsune busied themselves preparing the meal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emiko, Nanami, we have visitors,&quot; Ikumi called.<br />
<br />
The two kitsune vixens now approached, dressed in peasants clothing and sporting warm smiles. &quot;Pleasure to meet you,&quot; the older three tailed vixen replied. &quot;I&#39;m Emiko and this is Nanami. You must be my little brother&#39;s new girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Genki groaned in embarrassment, as the younger two tailed vixen giggled. &quot;Nanami you want to give Kari a tour?&quot; Emiko asked, cleaning her brownish yellow paws on her apron. &quot;I&#39;m still finishing up dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nanami smiled, the teenage kitsune giving her sister a thumbs up as she now excitedly pulled Kari forward, leaving Genki with his mother and sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re from the human world?&quot; Nanami asked excitedly. &quot;That&#39;s so cool! What&#39;s it like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay I suppose,&quot; Kari shrugged. &quot;A lot of humans and it&#39;s always busy. Personally, I like the kitsune realm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, this place is so boring,&quot; Nanami groaned. &quot;All I ever do is go to school or help out on the farm. I want to go to the human realm. I hear New York has buildings that disappear into the sky and there are people EVERYWHERE!! Mom says I have to wait &#39;til I&#39;m older, but that&#39;s so unfair. I&#39;m 165 years old, I can handle myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari nodded, doing some quick math in her head. By kitsune standards, Nanami was 16 and a half, the same age as Mason. The longevity of kitsune lifespans always made her head spin. Technically speaking, kitsune were children up to 100 years before becoming teenagers after their 100th birthday and obtaining their second tail. She curiously wondered what that would be like, to be a child or even a teenager for a hundred years. It was something Kari would never quite know.<br />
<br />
Despite being a pureblood kitsune, she was cursed with a human lifespan. Instead of gaining a tail once every hundred years, Kari gained one every ten. It meant now that she was physically 22 like Genki, despite him being 200 years older than she was.<br />
<br />
Touring the home Kari now smiled as she studied the small farmhouse. A large living room area sported a fireplace, bookcase, and extremely comfortable looking chairs and couches with the only modern amenity being a large flat screen TV. Attached to this living room area were a bathroom and four bedrooms. Peaking inside each bedroom, Kari noted what appeared to be Genki&#39;s room, the room small and neat, sporting a desk and bookshelf. In many ways, it reminded Kari of her own bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is my room,&quot; Nanami exclaimed, rousing Kari from her musings. &quot;Sorry about the mess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari glanced inside the room, stifling a laugh. It appeared Emiko and Nanami shared a room. Emiko was the neater of the pair, her bed made, her dresser neat, her side of the sister&#39;s shared closet orderly. Nanami on the other hand was a typical teenager&#39;s room. The teen&#39;s dresser haphazardly having clothes pouring out of half closed drawers, her half of the closet an explosion of dresses hung up or laying on the ground, even the teen&#39;s bed lay unmade with a blanket laying crumpled nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Kari stated. &quot;Reminds me of home. I have a brother around your age and a younger sister. Made beds are kind of taboo especially for my sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nanami grinned her twin brown tails wagging slightly as she continued the tour. A quick glance into Ikumi&#39;s room showed a king size bed with a TV, dresser, and full length mirror. Interesting enough, Kari now spotted a small Buddhist shrine, a picture of Genki&#39;s father resting in between two burning incense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom put dad&#39;s picture there after the war,&quot; Nanami said solemnly. &quot;He...died defending the capital. I&#39;m sure Genki mentioned him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari simply nodded, she had heard about Genki&#39;s father Raizo but never met the kitsune. All she could do was offer her condolences as the pair moved on. As they reached the final room, Kari pondered what it could be? Perhaps this was a spare bedroom, however, if so why? With Emiko and Nanami sharing a room wouldn&#39;t it make sense to give them their own space?<br />
<br />
&quot;Obaasan, are you awake?&quot; Nanami asked.<br />
<br />
Slowly an elderly eight kitsune turned, a warm smile on her face as her eyes focused on the pair of vixens. The kitsune looked old, frail, her eyes bleary with grey fur covering her brown muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nanami,&quot; she answered, her voice melodic and warm. &quot;I was just waking up. We have guests?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Obaasan,&quot; Nanami replied. &quot;This is Kari. Genki&#39;s girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
A warm, grandmotherly, smile spread across the kitsunes face as she shuffled towards Kari, taking her hands in hers. The grandmother&#39;s entire presence, one of warmth and comfort as she gazed into Kari&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;So nice to meet you,&quot; she said softly. &quot;My name is Michiko. I&#39;m Genki&#39;s grandmother, but you can call me Obaasan. Everyone does.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So nice to meet you Obaasan,&quot; Kari replied with a smile. After so many years without grandparents, this kitsune&#39;s mere presence brought back memories long buried. Thoughts of warm cookies and lullabies flooding Kari&#39;s mind as she thought of her own grandma.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dinner is almost ready Obaasan,&quot; Nanami replied. &quot;Do you need help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No dear I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Michiko stated, her face radiating warmth and comfort. &quot;I&#39;ll be along shortly. I wish to speak with Kari for a moment.&quot; Nanami nodded, leaving Kari alone with the elderly kitsune.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand your grandmother is Lady Shizen is that right?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Obaasan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady Shizen is such a wonderful vixen,&quot; she grinned. &quot;I&#39;ve known her for years. Did you know she helped my son Raizo when he joined the Dragon Army? She even helped me publish several novels over the years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I didn&#39;t know that,&quot; Kari said in astonishment. &quot;You&#39;re a writer!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Centuries ago,&quot; Michiko chuckled. &quot;Children&#39;s books, drama, even a few romance stories after I met Raizo&#39;s father. He was such a handsome kitsune. Passed away a century ago. Afterwards Raizo insisted I move in. It&#39;s been such a joy being around my grandchildren teaching them. Genki always reminds me of him. He possesses a quiet strength to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry for your loss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No worries dear,&quot; Michiko smiled. &quot;Seiz&#333; lived a good life, long life. He passed at 780 years old, that&#39;s quite old for most kitsune. Outside of the royal family of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes of course,&quot; Kari replied, her mind now wandering as she thought of Michiko&#39;s statement. Although part of the royal family, Kari&#39;s lifespan was far shorter than any kitsune. It was why she worried about dating anyone who was a kitsune. In her kitsune form, she appeared like any other kitsune. In human form though, she aged like any kitsune. For now she and Genki were the same age, but what would happen in 10 years or 20 years? What would happen if Kari reached 70 years of age and became an eight tail like Michiko? Would Genki still want to be with an elderly kitsune like Obaasan?<br />
<br />
As Kari now escorted Michiko towards the kitchen, she was shocked to see Genki and Ikumi greeting Lady Shizen. The celestial kitsunes warm smile seemingly illuminating the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady Shizen,&quot; Michiko exclaimed happily. &quot;What a pleasant surprise. It&#39;s been so long since I last saw you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is good to see you too Michiko,&quot; Shizen said, hugging the elderly kitsune.<br />
<br />
&quot;L..Lady Shizen...grandmother, wh..what are you doing here?&quot; Kari stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I like to visit Michiko and her family every few days,&quot; Shizen replied. &quot;And I heard Genki was introducing you to the family. I hope you don&#39;t mind me joining you for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has it only been a few days?&quot; Michiko asked, seemingly confused. &quot;I could have sworn it was longer. Silly me, my memory isn&#39;t what it used to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is quite alright Michiko,&quot; Shizen smiled. &quot;I have a tendency to forget as well. Let us eat. I would love to enjoy a meal with all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari simply nodded, helping Genki bring extra chairs to the table as Emiko and Ikumi brought dinner to the table as Nanami assisted Obaasan to her chair. Finally sitting down, Kari&#39;s mouth watered at the extravagant aroma.<br />
<br />
The dish itself was a simple stew, a mix of vegetables and beef that melted in ones mouth. The flavor was magnificent, nothing in the stew overpowering and warming Kari from the inside out. For someone who had tasted the best the royal chefs had prepared, this simple meal blew them away. This was comfort food, filling Kari stomach with a hearty meal.<br />
<br />
As the family spoke, Kari began to learn more of Genki&#39;s family. Ikumi was kind and warm, reminding Kari of Nina Moreland in her personality. Ikumi worked hard to maintain the farm and was a firm but loving parent.<br />
<br />
Emiko was very much like her mother. A hard working, serious minded three tailed vixen. At 292 years old, she was beginning to feel pressure from her mother to settle down and start a family of her own. Emiko though didn&#39;t seem quite ready, stating she was too busy. Kari thought the vixen seemed to have embraced the idea of being single, until Nanami let slip her secret dates with a nearby kitsune.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Juro?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nanami,&quot; Emiko hissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s Juro?&quot; Kari asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a four tail farmer down the road,&quot; Nanami teased. &quot;And Emiko liiiikes him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Emiko snarled, tossing and piece of bread at her kid sister who simply laughed at her sisters discomfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emiko, Nanami we have guests,&quot; Ikumi said firmly. The sisters settling down with Emiko staring daggers at her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Raizo, your daughters certainly are energetic,&quot; Michiko chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Genki, Obaasan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh of course my mistake,&quot; Michiko said. &quot;I forgot your father is still in the capital.&quot;<br />
<br />
Genki and his family simply nodded, leaving Kari somewhat uncomfortable. Over the course of the meal, she had noted Michiko confuse Genki with his father or forget names or events. The slips were subtle, If Kari wasn&#39;t paying attention she would never notice. Kari though was always very observant, picking up on these slips as well as Genki&#39;s family either ignoring or correcting her.<br />
<br />
After almost two hours, Kari noticed how late it was. Traveling down a dark country road could be dangerous at night. Thankfully Shizen would be with her, but she to needed to return to the capital. As Genki accompanied her into the setting sun, the pair of two tails held each others hands for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for dinner,&quot; Kari said softly. &quot;I had a great time and dinner was phenomenal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you liked it,&quot; Genki smiled. &quot;Really hope we can see each other again soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just kiss her already!&quot; Nanami exclaimed from inside.<br />
<br />
Kari blushed, Genki looking angrily back at the house before laughing nervously. For a moment the pair of kitsune laughed nervously before gazing into each others eyes. Slowly Genki now leaned closer, the pair exchanging a gentle yet passionate kiss before Kari departed. As Kari now walked with Shizen, she couldn&#39;t help but notice the celestial kitsune&#39;s wide smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem happy,&quot; Kari stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Shizen replied. &quot;I&#39;ve always liked Genki&#39;s family. I&#39;ve known Michiko since she was a young two tailed vixen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari nodded, a sad expression on her face as she focused on the path ahead. &quot;She&#39;s dying isn&#39;t she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid so,&quot; Shizen replied. &quot;Kitsune have long lives but they are not immortal. Aside from myself and Tatsu, few kitsune live to see their 800th birthday and Michiko is already 780 years old. She has perhaps 3 or 4 years left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Except for Fukushu,&quot; Kari sighed. &quot;He&#39;s what? 830 years old now. How come he&#39;s still in his prime and someone like Michiko seems so old?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Partly genetics,&quot; Shizen sighed. &quot;And partly the deal he made with Villar when you were just a baby. The magic and power that....creature used probably extended his prime for another hundred years. Even without that though, he is our son. Fukushu could easily live for over a thousand years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he&#39;s still a jerk for beating up Genki like he did,&quot; Kari grumbled.<br />
<br />
Shizen chuckled softly. After hearing about Genki&#39;s encounter with with her son, she realized something. In his own way Fukushu was protecting Kari and Haley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your uncle has his ways,&quot; she grinned. &quot;But deep down he does care about you. He just expresses it differently. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s happy that both you and Haley have found kitsune you are interested in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shizen,&quot; Kari said nervously. &quot;I...I need to ask you about something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shizen nodded, glancing at Kari in concern. Obviously something was bothering her. &quot;Go ahead Kari I&#39;m listening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just,&quot; Kari continued. &quot;I...I don&#39;t know how things will work with Genki. Right now, we&#39;re the same age. But...but I age quicker than he does. I&#39;m....I&#39;m worried about what our future would be like in the future. Would Genki still care about me when I&#39;m old? I mean he would maybe be a four tail kitsune by the time I&#39;m 80. What kind of life could we possibly have?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shizen nodded, stopping as she now placed a hand on Kari&#39;s shoulder. This was obviously a huge concern for the young kitsune, a major concern in any relationship she would consider. With humans, it would revolve around revealing her heritage as a kitsune. With kitsune, it meant growing older at an accelerated rate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I tell you a story?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari nodded, Shizen having her full attention as the celestial kitsune began. &quot;Do you know why I visit Genki&#39;s family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is because I originally tried to arrange a marriage between Michiko and Fukushu.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari gawked. She had never heard this story before. Now Shizen had her full attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was centuries ago,&quot; Shizen continued. &quot;Jiro...Fukushu was a young three tail kitsune, perhaps a little older than you. Michiko on the other hand was a young, vibrant two tail. In human years she was around 18 or 19 years old. I thought the pair perfect for one another. I even set the pair up for a meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Abolith happened,&quot; Shizen said, a small smile fixing itself upon her vulpine face. &quot;Fukushu had rescued Abolith a decade prior, taking care of her, teaching her how to care for herself. The pair grew closer, eventually falling in love, yet I was worried. A kitsune and an elf? Elves are one of the few beings who live longer than kitsune. What would happen when Fukushu grew too old? Would Abolith willing stay by his side? Would she be able to handle the fact that Fukushu would die long before she did?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I realized that it was not my place to judge my son and his chosen beloved,&quot; Shizen stated. &quot;It was not my decision to make, it was theirs. Sure I thought I knew better, however, it was their choice to make, not mine. They decided that in the end, they would enjoy their time together. For as long as they could.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Kari said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still,&quot; Shizen smirked. &quot;I had grown to really like Michiko. I felt so bad that it didn&#39;t work out. That and Abolith is hardly the most....conversational of daughter in laws. So, I continued to see her, as a friend. Introduced her to her husband Seiz&#333;. Helped her publish her novels. Even helped her son and his family start this very farm. All throughout Michiko&#39;s life, I have seen her as a trusted friend and I will be there for her....until the very end and when that happens...I will continue to keep in touch with his family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;So in the end,&quot; Kari replied. &quot;If I care for Genki I shouldn&#39;t worry about how long we could have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just enjoy the time that you do,&quot; Shizen replied.<br />
<br />
Kari nodded, a wide smile forming on her face as she hugged Shizen tightly. &quot;Thank you grandma.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are very welcome,&quot; Shizen said, a warm smile on her face. &quot;I hope I could help and just between you and me, I&#39;m really hoping things work out between you and Genki.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Kari and Shizen now chuckled softly, continuing on towards the capital.</p>
