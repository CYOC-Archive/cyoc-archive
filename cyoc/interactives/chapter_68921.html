<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave took the clothing from Calvin, inspecting it closely. It looked like something one of the preppy boys <br />
from high school would wear, from American Eagle or Abercrombie. A blue plaid button-down shirt, with hints of <br />
green in the pattern along with a pair of khaki shorts that had been distressed just enough to look stylish <br />
without looking old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure this is the look for me?&quot; Dave asked timidly, not wanting to insult Calvin. He was so <br />
enthusiastic about all of this, but Dave couldn't see himself pulling off the preppy look. He just didn't fit <br />
in with that crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my, yes! You may not think so now, but just wait until you've tried them on! You'll be a new man!&quot; Calvin <br />
replied, with a mild craze in his eye that subconsciously worried Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then, I guess you know about this stuff better than I do,&quot; Dave said, beginning to pull the blue shirt <br />
over his t-shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, that'll never work, we can't have you wearing that shirt over something like...that.&quot; Calvin gestured <br />
at Dave's plain white tee. &quot;A shirt like this is meant to be worn alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm...okay,&quot; Dave said, slightly uncomfortable at the man's suggestion. He seemed genuine enough, but Dave <br />
had never been one to show off his body in front of anyone. He didn't have too much to speak of in the muscle <br />
department, and was pretty self-conscious about it. But reluctantly, he pulled the t-shirt over his head, <br />
revealing his skinny frame. The only traces of hair on his upper body were two little wisps of dark brown hair <br />
under his arms.<br />
<br />
Dave quickly reached for the blue shirt, eager to cover himself up again in front of his new assistant. As he <br />
put his arms into the sleeves and pulled the shirt up onto his skinny shoulders, he felt a slight zap; it was <br />
as if the shirt had been charged with static electricity and has shocked him. He shrugged this notion off, <br />
however; he knew a cotton shirt couldn't hold a charge like that.<br />
<br />
As he began to button the shirt up, Calvin reached out and stopped his hand about half-way up. &quot;No, no, that <br />
will never do. Leave the rest undone and try on the shorts, we need to see this whole look come together!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave was even more self-conscious at this point. He had always hated changing in gym class, in front of all <br />
those other guys, when he couldn't hold a candle to them. And now here he was, in front of Calvin, this 6'5&quot; <br />
image of perfection, and he was about to relive all of it.<br />
<br />
He reluctantly pulled down his shorts, and let them fall to his feet. He kicked them to the side, and quickly <br />
reached for the new khakis. He pulled them on quickly, while Calvin watched his every move, grinning from ear <br />
to ear.<br />
<br />
Dave fastened the button on the shorts and pulled up the zipper, and as he did this time he was sure what he <br />
felt was a static shock. But this time, it was even more uncomfortable, it zapped him straight in the crotch! <br />
Dave grabbed himself from the surprise, even letting out a very audible &quot;ouch!&quot; that seemed to make Calvin <br />
grin even larger, if that were possible.<br />
<br />
Calvin now jumped into action, grabbing Dave's arms and rolling up his sleeves in that typical preppy way, and <br />
looking all over to make sure everything was just so. When he was completely satisfied, he turned Dave around <br />
and told him to have a look at himself in the mirror, telling him once again that he would look like &quot;a new <br />
man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave turned around slowly, expecting himself to look completely ridiculous in this getup. And his first <br />
thought as he looked into the mirror was that he did look ridiculous. But then it happened. He got zapped <br />
again, but this time it felt like his whole body had gotten shocked at the same time. His eyes were glued to <br />
the mirror. Then he felt the pain begin.<br />
<br />
It started in his feet. He had taken off his shoes when he put on the shorts, but even through his plain white <br />
socks, he could tell something was happening. At first, it felt like his feet were on fire, but then a new <br />
sensation surfaced...stretching. As the feeling grew, he swore his feet looked like they were <br />
growing...stretching his socks out further and further. But as quickly as the pain had come, it passed. But he <br />
was not done, as the pain then moved up into his calves...<br />
<br />
This time the change was more dramatic, as he could see his legs in full view. The feeling started the same <br />
this time, like a mild burning. But as that happened, the traces of brown hair that adorned his &quot;chicken legs&quot; <br />
(as his friends called them in joking,) pulled back into his body. His legs were now completely hairless...and <br />
yet the sensation grew, becoming more painful, and in their place fine, golden hairs began to emerge. Dave <br />
couldn't believe what he was seeing, and then the pain hit him again. It felt like someone was attempting to <br />
knead his legs like dough, and wasn't being very gentle about it. He could now see his calves exploding, <br />
filling out with muscle, leaving them look like he'd been a runner for quite some time. He managed to think to <br />
himself that this was a dream, that this wasn't happening. But he didn't say anything, he was completely at a <br />
loss for words.<br />
<br />
The process repeated for his thighs, and although he couldn't see the changes this time, he could feel them. <br />
Dave thought he knew what was coming, the changes were progressing upwards and it was only a matter of time <br />
until it happened, but he was in no way prepared for what happened next. It felt like someone kicked him <br />
straight in the nuts as hard as they could, and then his shorts began to feel tight. He didn't know what to <br />
make of this at the time, but he could only guess that he had grown in &quot;that department&quot; as well.<br />
<br />
The process continued upwards, the feeling of his skin being on fire, the stretching, the kneading, the <br />
foreign tightness of his clothes. His stomach churned; he could see a few golden hairs poking out of the top <br />
of his new shirt. His chest had been completely bare before. His pecs enlarged, not anything like a <br />
bodybuilder, but they reached a respectable prominence on top of his chest. His sleeves filled out, and more <br />
of this golden hair appeared on the tops of his arms.<br />
<br />
His neck now got the special treatment, enlarging just a bit, making his head look not quite so large on his <br />
body. Dave wondered what was going to happen to his face...this body didn't look anything like his old one, so <br />
why should his face? But as the burning and stretching began creeping into his cheeks and beyond, his face <br />
remained largely the same. There were some changes, of course; his jaw strengthened, his ears didn't seem to <br />
stick out so much from his head, and a gorgeous blonde stubble appeared on his face (something completely <br />
foreign to Dave, he had never really had to shave before.) But all in all, his face was still largely his own. <br />
His messy crop of hair at last pulled into his head, replaced by a perfectly wavy head of golden blonde.<br />
<br />
And then, as quickly as it had started, it was over. It felt like it had been hours since he first had looked <br />
into that full-length mirror, but Dave knew it couldn't have been more than a minute or so. He was so taken <br />
aback, he didn't know what to say. He looked at least 3 years older; he could easily walk into a bar and not <br />
be asked for I.D. But it wasn't just that he was older...he was perfect. In every way. Dave had hesitated <br />
trying on this outfit because he knew he couldn't pull off the jock-prep look, and now he WAS one of those <br />
people. The kind that all of the girls drooled over. He still couldn't believe his eyes, and pinched himself <br />
to see if it was all a dream. Of course, it wasn't.<br />
<br />
&quot;So now, what do you think of your new look? Is it you? Or should we try on something else, hmmmm?&quot; Calvin <br />
spoke for the first time since this had started. Dave had almost forgotten he was there, but he was. Sheepish <br />
grin and all, which had grown even larger...he looked like the cheshire cat.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Dave yelled, taken aback by his voice. It sounded foreign, much deeper than his own. He cleared his <br />
throat, trying again, but the sound was the same. &quot;I mean, I'd like to have a better look at this before I try <br />
something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Completely understandable! You want to know exactly what you're buying before you pay, and no one could blame <br />
you!&quot; Calvin's demeanor was growing on Dave fast, and all traces of discomfort or self-consciousness had faded <br />
away. &quot;You see that door over there? That's a private changing room. We like to be here for the initial <br />
inspection, to make sure you get the full effect of your new look, but you're more than welcome to have a <br />
better look at everything in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; Dave says, turning to the door. Calvin yells after him, &quot;I'll be right out here if you need assistance <br />
with anything at all!&quot; And then Dave is alone. The room is completely lined with mirrors on every side, and a <br />
small stool sits in the center.<br />
<br />
And then he has an uncontrollable urge to...</p>
