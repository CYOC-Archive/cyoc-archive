<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob woke up when she flopped breast-first onto the floor, the increased weight combined with gravity bringing her to the floor. &quot;Oof!&quot; she visibly groaned. As she pulled her legs off of the couch onto the floor, she felt a hot, gushing feeling coming from between her legs. She moaned in pleasure as she closed her legs in an attempt to stymie the flood. Carefully, she flipped herself to a sitting position and the faucet seemed to stop. ||Was I...prone? Oh shit, it wasn&#39;t kidding about being specific|| She opened her eyes, and wiped a frizzy lock out of her face with an ebony hand. &quot;Wait. wha?&quot; she questioned aloud, and heard a smoky voice emerge from her lips. Looking down, she was met with a massive pair of tits, which she noticed she could feel a vague slosh from her immediate recovery. <br />
<br />
She attempted to heft one with a hand, and could barely lift it. It must have weighed as much as a gallon! Sure enough, the other was the same. She shook them back and forth, and sure enough--she could feel the milk sloshing around inside. It was clear that her breasts were no longer the same as regular ones. She stood up, and wobbled her way to the nearby mirror. Without even seeing the mirror, she could tell that she had a massive ass. Her thick thighs rubbed together with every step; milky breasts swinging with momentum upstairs.<br />
<br />
The person staring back at her was the complete opposite of her previous form in nearly every way. Her skin was much darker than the pale woman from before, her hair was loosely done in thick, course braids. Her eyes made their way down, and she noticed her massive chest, each resembling the gallon which she was certain they possessed. They both rested on a hint of a belly, which ballooned into massive thighs that were almost unrealistically thick. Unlike previous changes, even if she pulled away her breasts she couldn&#39;t see her pussy over her belly, and moved in closer to the mirror. She had to pull back a little bit of her thigh fat in order to get a good look. It was currently a little engorged due to its recent outburst. She peeled it apart to try to get a better look inside, but it was too tight for her to get a good look. She shrugged, deciding to give it a rest as she went to her wardrobe to get some clothes on. Unless she was planning on spending all day fucking herself; she&#39;d need to make herself decent.<br />
<br />
As she wobbled her way to her room, she decided to check her phone again. Her Instagram account had tripled in followers from the last one. She decided to check some of the pictures, and felt like she should have been at least a little embarrassed. She was barely wearing anything in most of them. Many of them were taken in very public locations. <br />
<br />
One of them, she was wearing a skirt that barely made it past her ass, and a thong that left very little to the imagination with the imprint visible through the fabric. She was doing a downward V-pose over her pussy, clearly framing it for the camera. Behind her, people were walking by, not paying any attention. Not to mention her top, which barely covered the tip of her nipples, let alone the rest of the oreo-colored aereola. She wore a small jacket that made an attempt at sheltering her goods, but barely made it past the halfway point. For some reason though she didn&#39;t see her most recent pictures she had taken when starting the Chronivac experiment...<br />
<br />
Most of the pictures were similar, even ones with her family. But nobody seemed to care. She decided to dive deeper into her phone&#39;s gallery. She found an immediate explanation as to why the pictures weren&#39;t on Instagram. What were relatively tame images before were full on pornographic images, one with her stuffing a dildo into her slit, the other with her ass-first spreading her cheeks for the camera.<br />
<br />
Closing her gallery briefly, she noticed that she had an OnlyFans app on her phone, and--sure enough--it was filled to the brim with photos that would make a non-chronivac girl blush. Judging by the revenue she made a tidy profit off of her pictures, so she decided to snap a quick one while she was walking. She grabbed a selfie-stick from a nearby shelf, and set up her phone in a way to capture the tip of her nipples, the spread of her legs, as well as her feet. ||Gotta get a few different demos horny|| she thought. She posted it, and nearly instantly saw a few thousand dollars begin filtering into her account.<br />
<br />
She finally made her way to her room, and began looking for something even resembling normal. After looking through her instagram pictures, she could tell that was highly unlikely. But that seemed to be normal for her? So would it even make a difference? As she looked through her wardrobe, she knew she was a fool to get her hopes up. Especially with her proportions, she guessed her only options were either lewd out or wear a blanket as a dress. She found the most modest clothing she could find, and began to put it on. The first piece was a thong that covered more than the V-pose Insta pic, but still ended in a g-string that wedged firmly between her ass; the rim of the thong resting along the top of her thighs. She found a pair of jeans that were ripped in a few risque places, but otherwise they seemed fine. She sat down and pulled them over her feet, and immediately felt a problem. They were loose enough for her to get around her legs, but not enough for her to get past the curve of her ass. No matter how she struggled. Sighing, she took them off and began rummaging for more. She settled on a pair of yoga pants with the words &quot;FUCK ME&quot; on the butt. While these were much easier to get on, she could barely get the rim over her ass; where it now rested precariously. The thong resembling floss cresting out of it suggestively. <br />
<br />
Next up was the top. She gave up trying to find a normal bra, and instead decided she&#39;d settle for as much nipple coverage as possible. Which still didn&#39;t amoun to much, as that look she saw on instagram seemed to be her &quot;normal.<br />
<br />
The best she was able to find was a top that more resembled a loop of fabric, which bound her breasts tighter to her chest. As she struggled it into place, the squeezing motion was a bit too tight with each breath. Without warning, she began spurting a milky white fluid from her nipples, soaking the top in the process. &quot;Gaw damnit!&quot; she cursed aloud, and peeled the top off. She cleaned up the rest of the milk with her now-ruined top, and settled on the bikini top and jean-jacket she&#39;d seen in the Instagram picture.<br />
<br />
Just to make sure, she decided to check her phone one last time for any more pictures of her life up to this point. As she kept scrolling, she kept finding more and more pictures of penises. Which at first didn&#39;t even really phase her as she scrolled past, but soon she began daydreaming. Thinking about cocks, filling her mouth with their substance, her belly made warm by their exertions...<br />
<br />
She shook her head, as if to clear the thoughts, and realized she&#39;d been drooling a little. She wiped the corner of her mouth with her hand, and decided to Do Something with her day and the three hours she had.</p>
