<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Huck was very curious with regard Keiko Tachibana. Like all female werefoxes, she had the perfect hourglass figure with large and firm breasts balancing wide hips. Though all weres, both male and female, were highly attractive when it came the elements of physical desire, werefoxes always seemed to be the &quot;best&quot; in that regard. Many of the reasons for this were up for debate, but since his initiation into were society when the Jenkins family moved to Moon Lake, Huck really hadn&#39;t given much thought on those reasons. He did however do his best to keep himself from looking over his shoulder too much. Just because weres tended to be very sexy looking, didn&#39;t mean that they lived their lives wanting to be ogled for it, especially when he knew that when werefoxes forged their bonds to those they loved, they were firm and lasted forever.<br />
<br />
Huck lead her too the door and pressed the doorbell. In pure theory he&#39;d grown up here and could walk right in, but he&#39;d also grown up and moved out. Just opening the door didn&#39;t seem to sit right, particularly after the mess that had gone on yesterday regarding some guy that the Skulk&#39;s security personnel had told him wanted to kill his brother. A part of him wanted to join in the chase and beat the living daylights out of the man, as Harry was his little brother and had always been good to him, even after his transformation and they began grow in different ways. Thankfully, the Skulk&#39;s security personnel that were with him were smart enough to help keep his urge to protect his brother and family in check.<br />
<br />
Neither of them had long to wait as the door soon opened to reveal Henry Jenkins Sr. who smiled to his son and then nodded to Keiko.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Huck,&quot; Henry smiled to his oldest son, &quot;how are things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things are good, glad to be able to get to what we should have got to yesterday,&quot; Huck answered, &quot;seeing what we can do about an apartment and meeting the newest member of the family with a great happiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; Henry nodded and looked over to Keiko, &quot;and I believe I saw you talking with Harry and Jenny at the Skulk&#39;s welcome ceremony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Keiko nodded and stepped forward, bowed politely, &quot;I am Keiko Tachibana and am here to discuss the flower arrangements for the wedding and reception and so on. My husband and I are also the Skulk&#39;s den leaders for this street and your younger son and daughter-in-law will be welcome in our den.&quot;<br />
<br />
Huck heard that and felt a bit of loss at that. She was married, which meant it wasn&#39;t likely that she&#39;d have any interest in him. It made him want to sigh, as while he&#39;d had plenty of fun, especially his pack had its meetings, but a good part of him was wanting more than just some random fun. He sighed as his father responded to Keiko.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, come in, come in,&quot; Henry answered, &quot;everyone is waiting in the living room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Huck quietly followed his father into the house while Keiko followed as well. They made their way the living room where they found his mother chatting quietly with Harry and a young blonde woman with a body quite like Keiko&#39;s. Huck could also tell right away that his baby brother and this woman were werefoxes by scent, and the sight of the smile on his Harry&#39;s face was enough to make him forget that Keiko was married.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Harry, it&#39;s good to see you!&quot; Huck spoke as he came forward and hugged his brother, &quot;glad to see everything&#39;s alright and that you&#39;re happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s good to see you too, Huck,&quot; Harry answered with a smile, using the nickname that his older brother had always had, &quot;This is my fiance, Jenny.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Jenny stood up and reached out toward Huck. Huck only smiled and moved and hugged her as well, giving a few polite kisses to her cheeks, surprising Jenny greatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Jenny! Welcome to the family,&quot; Huck spoke with a smile, &quot;Glad to see that my baby bro has found someone like you to make him happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then set Jenny down next to Harry and kept a friendly smile, &quot;So... how are you two enjoying things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Between the two of us,&quot; Harry gave a smile and held Jenny to him, &quot;it&#39;s been great... I&#39;ve bonded to Jenny and she to me... and... well... there are a fair number of things that are very fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That they are,&quot; Huck managed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some things came as a bit of a surprise,&quot; Jenny commented, recovering from Huck&#39;s happy welcome, and gesturing to her enhanced chest and curves, &quot;especially considering what made me a werefox...&quot;<br />
<br />
Huck nodded, remembering the news reports on the chase for Yvette Smith and the talks with his parents to learn that his younger brother&#39;s girlfriend had been the second victim of the rogue werevixen.<br />
<br />
&quot;But now... I don&#39;t think either of us would go back if we could,&quot; Jenny smiled, &quot;I love being a vixen and having your brother as my bonded mate. I&#39;m looking forward that once we get through all this... to have a long and happy life with Harry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Huck nodded. That made sense, as that sort of thing was something everyone wanted at some point. Some weres might simply go from group meeting to meeting to enjoy the pleasures that inevitably came from them, but most that he knew tended want something more than just some random nights of sex. Now, as he grew a bit older and farther from when he first became a weredog, a part of him longed to find a mate of his own, settle down, have puppies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll do my best to make sure that you and Harry have a good place to start and to raise your kits in,&quot; Huck smiled to her.<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded, &quot;That&#39;s good... though there is something that has me curious...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Huck asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a weredog... right? You smell like a dog,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;do you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Huck caught on. Jenny was curious on what breed of weredog he was, which made sense. A part of him was curious on what kind of werefox his brother had become and thus what kind of werefox that his mate was. Some weres tended to be pretty generic in how they looked in their fursonas. Werelions had little difference between each other and the differences were often in the exact shade of their fur or their scents. Weretigers had a little more diversity in the sense that while most weretigers were based off of the standard coloration, orange with black stripes and a white underbelly, there were some that had the more rare color variants like white or golden, and he&#39;d heard tales of black weretigers, but he&#39;d never met one yet. Werewolves often had fur that matched their hair color, but they also had some that had fur colors that matched what was seen among wild wolves.<br />
<br />
However, weres that were based off animals with more varieties often had many different looks. Most werefoxes tended to be some color variation of the red fox, since they were the most common fox in the world, but Harry had heard reports of some being based off of other species. They were usually gray, swift, or kit foxes in North America. Werecats and weredogs all had their fursonas based on specific breeds. Huck&#39;s own fursona was based on the Pomeranian breed of dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d like to know my breed?&quot; Huck chuckled, &quot;I&#39;m more than happy to show you... I&#39;m actually a bit curious as to what kind of foxes you two are as well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... we are inside,&quot; Harry commented, &quot;we can correct that.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Huck watched as Harry began to transform. Mostly gray fur grew on his body with tan and white fur also beginning to grow to match with it. Harry soon rose up onto the balls of his feet as they lengthened into a foxes&#39; digitigrade feet. Small and slightly curved claws grew out from his fingers while a long silvery gray colored tail with a black tip and its underside having some tan colored fur. Harry&#39;s ears lengthened and became triangular while moving to the top of his head and as his face pushed forward into a narrow pointed vulpine muzzle. Harry looked to his brother with the red fox eyes of his fursona and smiled through sharper teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a Gray Fox,&quot; Harry smiled.<br />
<br />
Jenny cuddled up to Harry and began to transform as well. Like Harry, fur grew over her body, though unlike Harry&#39;s fur coat, hers was more of a uniform creamish color. The fur on her had and sides of her growing muzzle was darker than the fur on her face and on her underbelly, though that was covered by her clothing. She found herself chuckling as Huck&#39;s eyes practically bulged out of his head as her ears became triangular and moved up to the top of her head and grew bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. She happily wagged her tail as her transformation completed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a Fennec Fox,&quot; Jenny smiled as she cuddled up to Harry.<br />
<br />
Huck managed to recover as he looked on Jenny&#39;s were form. It was different and far different from what he expected. After a moment, he managed to continue on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose it&#39;s my turn, now,&quot; Huck chuckled, &quot;Please... don&#39;t get into any &quot;cute&quot; comments.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny raised an eyebrow to Harry who didn&#39;t answer. Huck, meanwhile, began to transform as well. Fur began to grow all over him, though unlike Harry and Jenny&#39;s fur, which is fairly short, his was much longer. Jenny could see as Huck&#39;s fur begin to poof out his shirt. Around his neck, the fur seemed to a grayish tan and started to turn more blackish when going to his shoulders. His muzzle, was shorter, like Jenny&#39;s, but unlike Jenny&#39;s which was still a pointed fox muzzle, Huck&#39;s was more of a squared dog muzzle with blackish brown fur. His head was covered with brown fur that matched his hair while his eyes turned to a weredog&#39;s dark brown. He grew little stub claws from his fingers and had to step out of his shoes and kick off his socks as he rose onto his own digitigrade feet. His arms and legs were covered in somewhat shorter orange/tan fur and Huck felt his own light brown colored tail grow out behind him and soon wagged and out of reflex, he gave a few short barks to announce the completion of his own transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re...&quot; Jenny said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a Pomeranian weredog,&quot; Huck answered, &quot;I&#39;m not cute. I&#39;m just as strong as any other weredog out there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know you are, Huck,&quot; Harry commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... all so different,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;I remember Mrs... err...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jenny paused to look to Keiko, who she did remember from the Skulk&#39;s ceremony on the past Friday. She was the wife of Akane&#39;s son Tora and was the Lycaon den leader. The two of them would likely talk about the wedding after getting through the introduction to Harry&#39;s brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Akane Tachibana saying that it&#39;s odd that I&#39;m a Fennec and not a Red Fox,&quot; Jenny spoke, &quot;which makes sense... I mean... Yvette Smith is a Red Fox and she transformed me... yet I became a Fennec. I transformed Harry and he became a Gray.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the weredog that transformed me was a Collie,&quot; Huck answered, &quot;and while turning into a little &quot;lap dog&quot; has made for some fun... I don&#39;t like commonly being referred to as &quot;cute.&quot; I&#39;m more than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There have been theories that all weres have a totem that they&#39;re connected to,&quot; Keiko spoke calmly, &quot;and that is unique to every individual and will allow for the varying forms that our fursonas can take and isn&#39;t controlled by the were that turns you into a were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So my totem was to be a lap dog?&quot; Huck asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is one theory,&quot; Keiko answered, &quot;but it would not determine WHO you are. That you determine for yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; Huck managed, &quot;I still don&#39;t want to be fawned over like I&#39;m &quot;cute.&quot; Got that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jenny gave a laugh, &quot;Though... when you find your Mrs. Jenkins...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll let her call me cute when I find her,&quot; Huck answered, &quot;but no one else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded, as Henry came up and patted his older son on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meanwhile, Huck, why don&#39;t we go take a look at all you&#39;ll need to alter to get the apartment up and ready and we can talk shop and the cost on that,&quot; Henry commented, &quot;Let Jenny and Harry get to their wedding planning work...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Huck nodded and looked over to Jenny and Harry, &quot;You&#39;ll all still be here, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Jenny and Harry both chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Again, Jen... welcome to the family,&quot; Huck said with a pretty typical doggy grin, which made Jenny privately thought did make him look rather cute, but she wouldn&#39;t say that out loud.<br />
<br />
As Huck and Henry moved off toward the garage, Jenny and Harry sat back down on the couch and looked to Keiko who was pulling a small brochure from her purse.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do not mind if I stay?&quot; Lisa Jenkins asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not mind,&quot; Keiko answered, &quot;Having extra opinions is always welcome...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa nodded and offered Keiko a seat in between Harry and Jenny so that she could show her ideas to both of them. As Keiko sat down, Lisa moved to actually sit on the armrest of the couch so to look over Harry&#39;s shoulder. A part of her was actually fairly giddy at seeing Harry and Jenny looking so happy about their wedding plans.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will also be a pleasure to speak with you on your opinions since things were busy during Friday&#39;s ceremony for further conversation,&quot; Keiko added.</p>
