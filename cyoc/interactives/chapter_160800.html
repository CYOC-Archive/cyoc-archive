<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;To be honest, you are the most beautiful girl I saw on the entire island&quot;, said Tony.<br />
<br />
Pam blushed so much that she went red in the face and her tail moved back and forth. But immediately she remembered the words that Tony said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re lying, you said that I&#39;m an ugly pack-mule.&quot; At that, Tony approached her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said that to bother you. That tail and those ears make you look cute.&quot;, Tony confessed. Pam liked what he said, and took Tony&#39;s hands. The two saw each other and smiled, they were really in love<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Good because I don&#39;t think I can take them off ... and neither can you. And you were right, I look like a little burro. Ha ha ha ha ha HEE- HAW! HEE-HAW! HEE HAW! HEE HAW! HEE HAW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pam’s voice slipped into donkey brays as she slapped her hands to her mouth to stop them. She felt such shame and fear that she dropped her long ears behind her head and stopped moving her tail.<br />
<br />
“Oh, no! Now I understand, everyone who acted like an ass is becoming one. We gotta get out of here! Come on, no time to waste.” Tony said as Pam nodded in agreement, too afraid to try to speak.<br />
<br />
Once they were outside, Pam and Tony were met with an island that was even more chaotic than before. In addition to the changing kids and the fully transformed donkeys, there were now island employees corralling the donkeys. It was becoming more and more obvious that this was all planned by whoever runs the island. Pam should’ve known that a free vacation was too good to be true, but she didn’t have time to dwell. She needed to escape before Tony and she joined the other donkeys.<br />
<br />
After quickly examining our options, Pam noticed that most of the crowd was running for the dock that they arrived at. She could see some of her friends there but now with long ears, tails and hooves. Pam and Tony decided to join the crowd as that seemed like their best option for escape, so she grabbed Tony’s hand to keep them from getting separated, but Pam quickly pulled her hand back as she felt a hard, bony mass instead of his fingers. Looking back at her boyfriend, she recognized a pair of black donkey hooves getting out of his arms.<br />
<br />
“Come on, we have to hurry”, Pam instructed Tony with a renewed sense of vigor. They did their best to push through the changing crowd as they approached the front gate, but their hopes of escape were dashed as they found the gate locked.  Without much time to think, Pam pulled Tony along as they tried to find another escape route. But as they began to run, a panic-stricken guy, who boasted a donkey head like many others, bumped into them, knocking them to the ground. Pam quickly got up and dusted herself off, but her heart sank as she looked down to see Tony struggling.<br />
<br />
“Oh Pam! I can’t get up! Help me!”,  he shouted at her. Determined not to give up, she helped Tony to his feet, but after wobbling on his feet, trying to stand upright, he fell forward onto his hooves with a loud clop. “Noooooooooo! I can’t stand up! I’m stuck! I’m HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE HAWWWWWWWWWWW!”<br />
<br />
“Here, I’ll help you” Pam said as she helped Tony to his feet again, but this time, he put his arms around her shoulder. “Come on, we have to keep moving.”<br />
<br />
Tony and she gingerly made their way back into the center of the island, moving much more carefully in order to keep Tony upright. Looking around the crowd, there were now more donkeys than people as the transformations continued to run their course. More and more donkeys were being wrangled up as well, which added another wrinkle to their careful escape.  Not only did she have to keep Tony upright, she had to do so without alerting the guards that were capturing both the donkeys and the changing people.<br />
<br />
After a while, as they kept in the shadows to avoid detection, she felt a prickling sensation on the back of her neck. Looking back, out of the corner of her eye, she saw brown fur growing on Tony’s arms, which now looked more like donkey legs than human arms. Unfortunately, her momentary lapse of concentration cost them as a guard jumped at them from around the corner, knocking Tony out of her grasp and onto all fours.<br />
<br />
“HEEEEEEEEEEEEEE HAWWWWWWWWWWW! Run Pam!” Tony shouted as their assailant began tying a rope around his neck. “Go! HAWWWWWWWWW! Save yourself!”<br />
<br />
Although she didn’t want to leave Tony, she was acting purely on instinct at this point. So she got back on her feet and began running. Looking back at her poor boyfriend, Pam saw his beautiful face begin to push out into a snout as the guard began dragging his away. Unfortunately, since she was looking back at Tony, she didn’t see the baton of another guard come across and hit her square in the head. In an instant, she fell to the ground and everything went black.</p>
