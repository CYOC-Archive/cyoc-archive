<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff clicked on the &quot;New Family&quot; option, a tree showed up with just his portrait sitting at the very bottom. He could see back about three generations, with the option to scroll back further, but every box that should be an ancestor sat blank, which intrigued him. He clicked on the box where his father should have been and a list of options popped up: &quot;Randomize&quot;, &quot;Default&quot; and &quot;Generate&quot;. Hovering over the options gave a description of what each could do. &quot;Randomize&quot; was pretty self-explanatory, it would generate a totally random person to take the place of the ancestor, &quot;Default&quot; would put his actual ancestor there and &quot;Generate&quot; would let him type key words to create a selection of people he could pick from. At the bottom of each tooltip, it was noted that the ancestor could be adjusted after being inserted.<br />
<br />
Jeff clicked on &quot;Generate&quot;, since it seemed to be the safest option to begin with, &quot;Randomize&quot; seemed a bit too fickle and &quot;Default&quot; kind of defeated the point of the program. A window popped up with five slots and a prompt to enter key words, which Jeff thought was restrictive but then again he could always change the person afterwards. He thought for a moment what kind of father he wanted. Jeff&#39;s father wasn&#39;t the... most appealing guy on the planet, at 45, he had grown a sizable gut, due to his sedentary lifestyle, which did not help his already average looks, nor was he spared from the curse of balding. Jeff always wondered why his mother married him, though supposedly when they married he was thin and had a full head of hair. Unfortunately for him, Jeff got the weight genes without having the skinny younger years and being 17 he couldn&#39;t really know if he would end up balding too, although that was quite likely. After thinking about it for a while, he put &quot;athletic&quot; as the first key word while &quot;masculine&quot; ended up being the second one. He wanted a dad that was... well... like a movie dad both physically and mentally. &quot;Handsome&quot; ended up in the third slot. He wondered how the machine would use that, some of these were subjective, especially the last one he typed, but he was able to input the word without the machine showing an error message.<br />
<br />
Tapping his lips, the teenager considered what to enter next. &quot;Well-hung&quot; went into the fourth slot, huh, it even accepted adjectives. He&#39;d love to have a little more down there and he was certain that would affect him too, knowing a bit about genetics. &quot;Tall&quot; was the last one to go in; he was never satisfied of his height at 5&#39;7&quot;, courtesy of his parents being short themselves, especially his father who was only 5&#39;8&quot;. Finally, he hit the generate button and a message popped up on his screen: &quot;You have chosen: athletic, masculine, handsome, well-hung, and tall. Do you wish to continue and generate the new ancestor?&quot; Ugh, stupid programs always asking with multiple confirmations. Jeff selected &quot;Yes&quot; and waited for a moment. A new window with twenty blank slots then appeared, each of the boxes had a spinning loading wheel. One by one, extremely realistic full body images of men appeared on the screen. Naked men. It was a lot more skin than Jeff had expected, he looked over to his door to make sure it was shut and locked. He didn&#39;t need his mother coming in and thinking he was looking at porn; that would probably be the end of him...<br />
<br />
All of the men that appeared on screen had several things in common. All were definitely fit and tall, most had body hair of some sort many had beards, and all had large... well... the &quot;well-hung&quot; worked; he could also tell practically all of them were good looking, at least in his opinion. But there was variety in them too. &quot;Athletic&quot; seemed to cover a wide range of body types, from muscular bodybuilders to lean swimmers. There was also a large spread of ethnicities. From a muscular blond haired, blue eyed guy with a viking beard to a lean Asian man, a muscular middle eastern man with a little bit of a gut and a tall and fit black man. There was even an option to generate more ancestors. Jeff figured he could always change the man he chose later, if he really wasn&#39;t satisfied, and focused on one that caught his interest the most.<br />
<br />
The middle eastern man, now that he was looking at him more closely actually looked Indian; he had naturally deep tan skin, his black beard and hair were both neatly groomed and short. A swath of black hair also covered his chest and stomach, down his arms and legs there was also a nice albeit moderate coverage of dark hair. There was none on his shoulders or on his back, as Jeff discovered he could rotate the model and zoom in and out. He was heavily muscled, but didn&#39;t sport a set of abs, instead he had a very minor gut, which made him look quite solid; an aging athlete that couldn&#39;t keep a perfect physique anymore but was still incredibly fit. And of all the generated options, he seemed to have one of the larger manhoods, darker brown like his nipples, hanging thick and heavy between his thighs, he also had something Jeff  had rarely seen before, a foreskin. After his inspection, and a quick look at the other choices, he decided to pick this one. After selecting that person, his entire side of the tree slowly filled with pictures of men and women, a definite family resemblance running through it.<br />
<br />
He then decided what to do with his mother. Although he was curious about the &quot;Randomize&quot; option, he was curious as to how his body would change by only changing his father. Besides, at 47 his mother was, in his humble opinion, above average in terms of beauty. Sure, she wasn&#39;t a supermodel or anything but she was active enough, unlike his father, to keep a slim albeit curvy shape. He also liked the blue-green eyes he had inherited from her. Following with this idea and also remembering he could always change her later he decided to select the &quot;Default&quot; option. What he wasn&#39;t expecting, however, was that when he clicked on it, it brought up a window showing the image of his nude mother. He was surprised and even though his mother was decent looking, she was still... his mother so he closed the window quickly, still somewhat embarrassed at what he just saw. Then his mother&#39;s side of the tree began to fill up as well, with people he assumed were his actual ancestors, since he didn&#39;t know any of them with the exception his grandparents. It was strange seeing the two trees side by side, especially his new father&#39;s side, but then he noticed over his portrait there was now a button labeled &quot;Update&quot;. Perhaps it was a preview? He clicked the button and waited, the loading sign appearing over his face.<br />
<br />
He suddenly felt warm, heat creeping along his skin. He looked down to his hands were the skin was suddenly darkening, it was as if he was watching himself get a tan in full speed, though not as dark as the image of his new father, his skin was definitely darker than usual, a light brown. As the darkening creeped up his arms he removed his shirt and tossed it aside. Then he noticed his gut deflating like a punctured balloon. In fact, all the fat on his body seemed to be melting away as his skin tightened up against his frame. The slightly flabby chest he had developed flattened out and he quickly turned to the mirror on his closet door. His face was becoming leaner, puffy cheeks and chin retreating, his face was still youthfully round, but not fat. The darker skin poured down his chest and up his neck, his nipples turning a slightly darker shade of brown. When the darker skin reached his hairline, his mousy brown hair started turning black like his new father, and turned from lanky and straight to slightly wavy. Afterwards, his hair started to pull back into his scalp, going from a messy mop to a short crop that you could only barely tell was wavy. The color of his eyes, however, stayed the same blue-green like he had hoped, perhaps because one of his paternal grandparents had green eyes. Dark skin moved down his stomach and towards his crotch. He quickly stood up and dropped his shorts, staring as his dick darkened, his pubes going from dark brown to pitch black at the same time. There was a tingling in his cock, a foreskin starting to grow back, slipping over the head of his dick. He reached down and slid it back, shuddering at the new and exciting feeling. He lifted it and took a look at his scrotum, seemingly unchanged other than being much darker. The color of his skin deepened on his legs, travelling down and finally reaching his feet.<br />
<br />
The heat moved from his skin and seemed to sink into his bones. His hands and feet suddenly both grew in size, probably gaining at least two shoe sizes in a blink. His limbs started stretching out, getting longer as his shoulders widened. When the fat melted away he had turned rather slender, but now his frame was becoming larger. His chest grew as his ribs pushed out, his stance shifting a bit as he felt his hips widen just slightly. He had just gone from a straight figure to a v-shape, already looking more masculine than he did previously. He also felt his spine stretching adding a couple more inches on what his legs did. He had to step back to see himself completely in the mirror now, guessing he had gone just over six feet in his growth spurt. He was already amazed at his transformation and he thought it was surprising that he didn&#39;t feel any pain or discomfort at his body rearranging. The heat then moved up into his skull, his face contorting strangely, it was like watching one of these weird 3D face morphing videos online. His cheekbones pushed out as his jaw and chin became more pronounced. His face going from a round shape to more square and angular shape. His brows also became slightly more prominent as his nose broadened and sharpened.<br />
<br />
The heat shifted again, now feeling like it was coursing through his veins, his muscles began to bulge out all over his body. His chest inflated and he sat down on his bed, a hand running over it. It felt so... strong. His flexing arm shifted as his biceps and triceps swelled with new growth, even his forearms were gaining more mass, and his shoulders were rounding with the added mass. His new father might have a slight gut, but he had the advantage of youth, and his now flat stomach suddenly developed the ridges and grooves of a lean six-pack. His ass swelled slightly as his dick suddenly began to grow. He had gotten worried that the one change was it, but now his cock was lengthening and growing thicker. Even as his thighs grew muscle on either side, his third leg seemed to have the most impressive growth spurt, possibly because of his previously small size. His new tool flopped heavily against his thigh, and he had to spread his legs a bit to accommodate for his two enlarged balls that were hanging between them. His calves bulked up as the muscle growth continued down his legs. He had good bulk for a teenager, looking like he played football or some other sport that required strength, although he would still probably be just around the average for such sports. Of course, he still couldn&#39;t hold a candle to the bulk of his father, but that would probably change as he got older; he wasn&#39;t done growing yet, he knew that much.<br />
<br />
As if coming full circle, the heat moved back to his skin, though it was only focused in certain spots. A light coat of black hair grew on his previously hairless legs and forearms and the very small bushes under his arms suddenly became much fuller. Black hair started growing from his pubes up to the middle of his stomach, reaching a few inches past his belly button. A patch of dark hair grew in on his chest, and more peeked out around his nipples. A faint shadow but promising a pelt of dark hair as he got older. The heat moved back into his face and he looked to the mirror. His brows thickened noticeably as what had been non-existent facial hair began to grow in. Darkening sideburns growing in front of his ears, a slight shadow growing in on his upper lip and chin, then just along the base of his jaw, barely meeting his sideburns. He rubbed at his face. He could grow a whole beard now, it would be a thin thing, but it would probably get thicker as he got older. He could only think of a few guys in his class with anywhere near this amount of facial and body hair, though that wasn&#39;t saying much considering there were mostly girls and most guys in his class were... not very masculine.<br />
<br />
The heat seemed to subside, and he realized he barely recognized himself in the mirror. He stood up and did some flexing poses he saw somewhere online, admiring his new body, which was far better than the original. His cock even began to chub up from his excitement. New memories began to flood his mind alongside his old ones: a father that played sports with him, taught him how to work out and build muscle; a history of playing sports in high school, surprisingly with good academics; a whole different family, him and a brother... Wait he had a brother now!? He had always secretly wished to have a sibling but his parents never wanted another child, he couldn&#39;t be happier about that change. He was now half-Indian and half-American, though the Indian blood definitely came through stronger.<br />
<br />
Suddenly there was a knock on his bedroom door, a deep voice calling out, &quot;Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t recognize the voice at first, but then he realized it was his father. &quot;Uh.. one sec.&quot; Woah! Was that his voice? It was definitely deeper, though he had no time to think about it. He quickly looked around and located his discarded shorts, he grabbed them and pulled them on, surprisingly they fit his new body. He was so engrossed in his transformation that he hadn&#39;t even noticed his room had shifted slightly, some workout equipment and trophies appearing, whilst dirty dishes and snacks had vanished. &quot;Yeah?&quot; he answered his father&#39;s call.<br />
<br />
His dad... his new dad opened the door and peeked his head inside, a smile breaking through his dark beard. &quot;Your mother says dinner will be ready in fifteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff ran a hand through his hair, calming his breathing. &quot;Right, I&#39;ll be down, just gotta put a shirt on.&quot;<br />
<br />
His father nodded and shut the door. Jeff sat down on his bed with a sigh, looking over at the computer. The Chronivac had updated his picture, a little system message of &#39;Update Complete&#39; flashing on the screen.</p>
