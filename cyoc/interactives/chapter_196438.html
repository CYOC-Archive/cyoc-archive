<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I am wondering what has become of Bethany.  Is there a wish for that?&quot;  Elena asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm, I could link your minds, so you can hear her thoughts, and access her senses.  And don&#39;t worry, it will be one way.&quot;  Sahar had produced a hair scrunchie from nowhere, and was busy pulling her hair back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sure, that sounds  good.  I wish for you to link my mind to Bethany&#39;s.&quot; <br />
<br />
As soon as Elena said that, she found herself elsewhere.  She was looking at an unfamiliar ceiling.  She couldn&#39;t turn her head, but she was breathing, and her chest was rising and falling.  She was laying on a bed with a pink sheet.<br />
<br />
&#39;This sucks&#39;.  She &#39;heard&#39; Bethany&#39;s voice in her mind.  &#39;No phone.  No computer.  What am I supposed to do?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Ah&#39;, Elena thought, &#39;she got grounded.  Serves her right&#39;.<br />
<br />
Bethany sat up suddenly, and crossed her legs, Indian style.  &#39;I should have listened to Elena.  God, I hate how she&#39;s always right!  I know she&#39;s smart, but I wish she wasn&#39;t such a bitch!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Wait, what?&#39; Elena thought.<br />
<br />
&#39;All I wanted to do was hang out with her.  But she&#39;s too cool for me.  Already a Senior at 15, and she must think I&#39;m a baby.&#39;  Bethany continued.<br />
<br />
&#39;I don&#39;t understand, I thought she hated me?  Or wait...she&#39;s younger now, so maybe that changed how she thinks of me?&#39;  Elena came to a realization.<br />
<br />
&#39;And she&#39;s so pretty...I wish...&#39;  Elena caught a flash of her thoughts.  Bethany was laying on her bed, with Elena herself next to her.  They gazed into each other&#39;s eyes, and both girls were naked.  Dream-Elena pulled Dream-Bethany close to her chest, and the younger blonde took a tiny breast into her mouth and suckled on it.  Dream-Elena moaned, running her fingers through the blonde&#39;s hair and...<br />
<br />
The experience shook Elena right back to her body.  &quot;Holy shit.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Sahar had used several scrunchies to give herself a long ponytail by this point, and had moved Elena to lay on her bed, while she browsed the internet on the laptop.  &quot;Oh that was fast.  Welcome back.  So what was Bethany up to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She...was having fantasies...about me?&quot;  Elena was so confused.  &quot;Did making her younger do this?  She hated me before!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hate and love are often tied to one another.  If you view your past through her perspective, it may be that her hatred was actually caused by jealousy.&quot;  Sahar explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jealousy?  But she&#39;s...so tall and pretty and everyone likes her!&quot;  Elena couldn&#39;t believe what she was hearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re quite pretty yourself, Elena.  And very intelligent.  Plus, you&#39;ll graduate high school at 16, with your whole life ahead of you.  In fact,  she might have wanted you for a friend...but of course, you were separated by a rift that could not be crossed.  She was a popular girl, and you were not.  She lacked the courage to approach  you, fearing that her life would be ruined.  Girls who like other girls are not completely accepted in your society, and I am certain it is worse in high school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now that she&#39;s younger than me, she must...look up to me?  This is so weird.&quot;  Elena frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was there a time when you admired her as well?  You speak highly of her beauty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena blushed.  &quot;Y...yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sahar leaned forward in the chair, her eyes full of mischief.  &quot;In fact, you fantasized about her, the way she now fantasizes about you, didn&#39;t you?  Perhaps even pleasured yourself thinking about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena felt like her face was on fire.  But as much as she wanted to deny it, it was true.  &quot;Yes.&quot;  She hung her head.<br />
<br />
Sahar stood up and walked to Elena, placing a hand on the smaller girl&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;There, there, Elena.  There is no shame.  In truth, you have loved this girl all along.  No matter how badly she treated you.  But you couldn&#39;t cross that rift either.  After all, the risk of rejection, of being shunned even more for being considered a &#39;freak&#39;, was too great.  But you aren&#39;t a freak at all.&quot;  Sahar then kneeled in front of Elena, looking up at the girl.  &quot;Now the question is, what do you want to do about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena bit her lower lip, not trusting herself to speak for a long moment.  &quot;I want to try to cross that rift.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how can I help, Elena?&quot;  Sahar&#39;s green eyes seemed to glitter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well first, we have to get her ungrounded.  And away from her friends.  She&#39;d never be honest with me if they were around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I cannot undo the accident, at least, not without changing other things.  But perhaps we can make her family more forgiving?  Tell me, is Bethany a good student?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena held her hand up and waggled it.  &quot;Kinda?  She passes her classes, but she has some trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent.  Then perhaps her parents would not be averse to a classmate offering to tutor her?  Especially one that is known to be academically gifted?&quot;  Sahar smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that could work!  Oh right, I need to phrase this as a wish.  Hm.  Ok, here goes.  I wish that Bethany&#39;s family would agree to let me visit her so that I could tutor her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sahar.  &quot;It is done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, but I&#39;m not that convincing in person.  And her parents make me nervous, I mean, they&#39;re wealthy and well connected and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, don&#39;t worry so much, Elena.  You lack confidence, and they are powerful.  But you are now far more powerful than they are, thanks to my help.  I don&#39;t think you need any help to be more charming, but I could help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena brightened.  &quot;Yeah.  Yeah!  I wish I was more charming!&quot;  She felt something change, but wasn&#39;t sure what.<br />
<br />
Sahar shook her head.  &quot;Oh Elena, you need to be more specific with your wishes.  But as per our agreement, I will attempt to save you from yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Sahar.  I guess I should get going.  Can you drive me over there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!  Then I will come home and meet your brother.  Perhaps cook him a meal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena smiled.  &quot;He&#39;d appreciate that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should your brother prove to be handsome, is he off limits?&quot;  Sahar inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot;  Elena was surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry if that was out of line, but you did say that if I wanted anything, I should tell you.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;You did say you wanted to try your body out.  I guess I should have realized you&#39;d be into guys and girls.&quot;  Elena scratched the back of her neck.  &quot;But you&#39;re only 16, that could be a problem if you get involved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s a fair point, you might be disappointed if his moral certitude proved to be...lacking.  As for my preferences, if you&#39;d rather I be a lesbian, it wouldn&#39;t bother me.&quot;  Sahar offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I don&#39;t know.  That sounds unfair to you.  What if you met a great guy?&quot;  Elena frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I would ask you if I could turn him into a woman, of course.&quot;  Sahar didn&#39;t miss a beat.<br />
<br />
This led Elena to suddenly imagining Chris as a girl.  She blushed.  &quot;Oh uh, I guess that&#39;s...a thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am making you uncomfortable, I am sorry.  What shall we do, then?  Go for a drive?&quot;  The Djinn smiled.</p>
