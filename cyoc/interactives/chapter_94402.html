<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cody had just settled down on the couch when his cell phone started to vibrate. <br />
<br />
“Hello?” <br />
<br />
“Heyyy Codykins…” the cute, female voice spoke through his iPhone. It was Jenny, the girl from school who had always had a terrible crush on Cody, ever since they had met each other in the first grade.<br />
<br />
“Umm… Hi…” he stuttered, since he was caught a little bit by surprise. Jen would call Cody every day and then they would get into a fight or an argument and they wouldn’t speak for three weeks. After a period of silence, he would suddenly hear from her and she would start to call, text and message him again, like every five minutes of the day. “Uhmm… What’s up, Jen? I haven’t heard from you in so long…” <br />
<br />
“Oh, I’ve been busy with church, school, family, finals, and a ton of other stuff. Listen, do you mind if I can over?” she asked him. <br />
<br />
“Uhmm… Yes… I mean, no, of course not… I mean… Uhmm…” Cody stammered, not really feeling in the mood for having her over since he wanted to play video games and having Jen over meant having to listen to her and talk to her for the rest of the night. <br />
<br />
“Good! I’ll be right there!” she insisted before she hung up. <br />
<br />
“Damn! I wish Jen was a guy…” Cody sighed before he looked down and stared at the remote. “Then… we could play… video games… Ooohhhh….”<br />
<br />
Cody held the remote in his hand and smiled. Yes, he had already made up his mind. He would let Jen come over and he would tell her about his remote. Then, he would get her in his bedroom, close the door and he would zap her and change her into a guy! Easy, right? <br />
<br />
The doorbell rang and Cody leaped to his feet. He ran to the doorbell and unlocked the door so he could let Jenny in. <br />
<br />
Jenny was a cute girl, only 13 years old, with pony tails, long blonde hair, and bright blue eyes. She wore a shirt and blue jeans and just white tennis shoes. She was thin and short but still active and athletic. <br />
<br />
“Hey Codykins…” she said as she strolled into the house. “We need to talk, dude…” <br />
<br />
“No, problem!” Cody said as he grabbed the remote and led Jenny into his bedroom. Then he closed and locked the door behind her as she walked in and sat down on the edge of his bed. He sat down on his chair by his desk in the corner. <br />
<br />
“I know we have our differences and I know that you’re a guy and you need your space with your buddies and playing your music and your video games and all so I came here prepared to talk about all that and I am coming here with a totally open mind about all this so you don’t have to fuss or fight or argue anything with me because I also have a cousin who is your age who is totally into video games and music and rock and roll and EDM and all that kind of stuff and he goes through these periods where he will lock himself up in his bedroom which he calls his mancave and he will just totally immerse himself in his music and his video games and he will just play for days and days and even in the middle of the night and all and he won’t even come out at all except to eat and use the bathroom and all, so it is really disgusting…” Jenny said in one breath. <br />
<br />
Cody just stared at her with a REALLY bored look on his face. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Jen… Don’t you ever wish you could just be… a guy?” he asked her casually. <br />
<br />
Jenny glared at him with anger and disgust. <br />
<br />
“WHAT!!?? Hell no! Ewwww! Guys are big and hairy and smelly! They stink and sweat all over and they have this big and bulging and disgusting round fat hard muscles… Eww! Most guys have hair all over the place and they have this… THING… hanging between their legs with these little… THINGS… hanging just under the BIG THING… and these things are so… EWW! That’s why we are so clean and feminine and pretty and sophisticated. We are refined and sweet and precious! We are women! We are such refined, darling creatures…” Jenny responded in her haughty tone of voice. “We’re not so rough and… BARBARIC like MEN… EWW! And you guys have to shave and wash your… THINGS…” she continued as she gently rubbed her hands across her breasts. “We are soft and gentle and delicate and loving… we are not BRUTES like YOU!” <br />
<br />
“Gosh, Jenny… Sorry you feel that way!” Cody said sadly. “I think you’d make a really… sweet… boy…” <br />
<br />
“What? ME? A BOY??!!??” Jen gasped out loud. “I’m a girl! How on earth would I change into a boy!!??” <br />
<br />
Cody then showed her the remote which he was holding in his hand. He aimed the remote at her and he smiled. <br />
<br />
“All I need to do is aim this thing at you and press one button and you will instantly transform into a guy!” he explained. <br />
<br />
“What? WAIT!” Jen gasped, when she realized that Cody was very serious. <br />
<br />
But Cody quickly tapped the TRANSFORM button which switched the “Gender” designation for the target from Female to Male while keeping the target’s age the same. <br />
<br />
A red beam of light shot from the front of the remote and it struck Jenny in the shoulder for a few seconds. That was all that was required. <br />
<br />
“CODY! What did you do!!??” she protested as she was about to get off the bed and walk over to him. <br />
<br />
Jenny was standing right in front of the bed when she stiffened up. She could no longer move at all as her body changed rapidly! Her air suddenly became MUCH shorter, her face changed and her body started to grow a bit more. She added six inches to her height and her voice changed, becoming deeper and more baritones. <br />
<br />
Her thin arms suddenly bulged with muscle as biceps and triceps inflated all over. Her pectorals grew thick and wide as well. Her breasts flattened out and in the place she now had nice, firm, hard pectorals covering her chest like iron plates. Her flat stomach now had ridges like a washboard and her thin, short legs grew longer and filled out with muscular curves from her bulging quads and massive soccer-ball calves. She practically burst out of her t-shirt and her thick, muscular legs ripped her jeans due to all he muscle that was growing everywhere. She was turning into a very impressive muscle BOY! <br />
<br />
Her arms grew longer and thicker and her hands were not so refined anymore, but her palms and fingers were like big shovels, great for catching baseballs or footballs. She now had strong knees and shoulders and her entire body was built for sports!<br />
<br />
“A GUY… YOU TURNED ME INTO A FREAKING GUY!” she shouted at first before staring at the reflection in the mirror and calming down. “Ohhhh wowwww….”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jenny began to enjoy it. She liked what she saw. She was one HELL of a CUTE BOY!<br />
<br />
“Ummm… Cody… Oh wow, my voice! I sound so different!” she – or HE said…<br />
<br />
“Let’s not call you Jen but… How about Jake or Jason?” Cody wondered. <br />
<br />
“Umm… I always liked the name Jason…” he mumbled as he examined himself in he mirror. He had removed his girly shirt and jeans and he was only standing there in his underwear, which he eventually removed as well. <br />
<br />
“You can borrow some of my clothes, dude!” Cody said, as he gave Jason some of his clean underwear, shorts and a shirt. <br />
<br />
Then, as Cody sat on the bed, Jason came and sat next to him. <br />
<br />
“Okay…. You made me into a guy… But, I still love you… Deep down there is STILL a girl inside of me…” Jason said as he forcefully grabbed Cody by the shoulders and pulled him towards him. Cody was actually surprised by Jason’s strength. He was amazed how strong he was and how athletic he turned out to be. In fact, Jason was a little taller and stronger than Cody was himself! <br />
<br />
“Okay… so, I guess I’m your boyfriend now, right?” Jason said to him, as he leaned closer and kissed Cody on the lips. <br />
<br />
“You got it, Jenn… I mean, Jason!” Cody just grinned. “Wanna play some video games with me?” <br />
<br />
“You bet!” Jason grinned. “I’ll do anything my boyfriend wants to do!” <br />
<br />
Cody was glowing! This is what he had always wanted! He now had his own boyfriend who wanted to do everything he wanted without arguing and fussing because… his boyfriend was a GUY!</p>
