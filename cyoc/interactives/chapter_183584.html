<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim and Jamie looked back at their dragon body and took turns experimenting with the tail. They practiced using their legs some more and learned that taking steps back and forth was easier than you might expect. Eventually, though, they found themselves looking into each other&#39;s eyes again. And again. And yet once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so weird,&quot; said Jim to his bodmate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Jamie. &quot;I mean, we&#39;re ... both ... we&#39;re both...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... James,&quot; her male-identifying head finished. &quot;We&#39;re both ... the same person, er, dragon, but one of us ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... is a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finishing each other&#39;s sentences felt oddly alluring. They just couldn&#39;t get it out of their heads that they had been the same human male entity only minutes before. Jamie spoke again, but her voice trailed off, and this time Jim didn&#39;t finish her sentence: &quot;This is so ...&quot;<br />
<br />
They want to say it was so weird. Then they wanted to say it was spooky, or wrong, or disturbing. At last they wanted to say it was hot. In the end, they didn&#39;t say anything. They just inched their identical muzzles closer together, opened their broad, toothy maws, and kissed.<br />
<br />
It was the most perfect either of them could have asked for, from the only other person in the world who would perfectly understand exactly what kind of kiss either would ask for. They slithered their wiry, forked tongues into each other&#39;s mouths, moaning and lapping up the ashy taste of their identical smoky dragon breath. Their loins burned with lust, the heirs to James&#39;s consciousness realizing that each was logically the other&#39;s ideal sex partner. James, having become two opposite-gender dragon heads sharing a dragon body, could sexually pleasure himself in ways he could have dreamed of as a straight cisgender male human. But how exactly would he do so?<br />
<br />
Jamie and Jim nuzzled their necks around each other and eventually looked down between their front legs at their new underbelly, curious about their new anatomy down there. Intrigued, they found two slits, two cloacae, you might say. Why would one dragon need two, though? Of course, Jim noticed that he only really feel the rear one, and Jamie found that she could only feel the one closer toward their front. Jim&#39;s burning lust swelled forward into an erection, and he grinned with pride at the organ which surged its way out of his slit. It didn&#39;t look much like a human penis, or even like the double penis of a reptile, but it was huge. It was a scaly, serpent-like hose that arched forward and twitched. He was amazed to find it was prehensile like a dolphin&#39;s or an elephant&#39;s, and he swirled it around a little bit, pleased by the sensual muscle movements of doing so. Noticing he could reach the thing even past the other cloaca, he hissed at the thought of possibly being able to maneuver it inside there.<br />
<br />
Not even having to move his legs or his share of the tail, Jim coiled his lengthy cock back, aimed it toward the second hole, and pushed forward and upward into it. Jamie moaned when he inched his tip up into the slit. Jim needed more, though. There was just a little warmth around the tip of his long penis, which was frigid here in the damp cave air. He lurched the thing forward, and they both moaned as organ shoved itself deep inside their torso. Their back legs buckled dropping their knees to the ground, causing them to lean forward in bliss. The obscene creatures necks writhed and flame shot again from its two mouths as it ravaged itself with its phallus. The clench of orgasm seized its unstoppable muscles, making it throw its heads back and arc its tail. A river of bestial semen surged from set of internal genitals to the other, visibly bulging the partially exposed plumbing that made this all possible. Jim was feeling himself erupt in his mate; Jamie was feeling her mate erupt in her. It&#39;s for the best that becoming a herm dragon left them with two heads, because one mind wouldn&#39;t have been able to handle it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That, was, the best, sex, ... of my ...&quot; Jamie started.<br />
<br />
&quot;... life,&quot; Jim finished, retracting his dripping organ out of his bodmate&#39;s slit and back into his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I see you to have been busy,&quot; said the sarcastic voice of Kayla behind them. They turned their long necks to see her. &quot;Do you have any idea how much trouble you caused me?&quot; she continued. &quot;My father and I had to use up a month&#39;s worth of wit-root erasing the memories of those mortals you traumatized back there. Oh yeah, and we had to release the carnival&#39;s gremlin squad to follow them home, and erase their pics of you, and delete their posts about you off of social media. Do you realize how clumsy goblin&#39;s are? Do you realized how pissed off mortals get when invisible forces start screwing up their technology? Oh well, they&#39;ll probably just chalk it up to Russian hackers or yet another premature software release. I&#39;m sure there will still be sketchy videos making their rounds on conspiracy-theory cable channels for another half-century. Oh well, at least I finally got my two-headed dragon, even if I endure this fiasco.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim snorted. Jamie gave a rumbly, ominous monster growl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you growl at me. I know you two can talk. I made you a herm dragon, and I can make you a spayed-and-neutered dragon. Now if you want some more time and space to enjoy those matching parts I gave you later, you&#39;ll be a good shemale and follow me in silence through this cozy magical beast cave, part of which is going to be your new home from now on. Heck, you might even get the occasional nosy mortal explorer or conspiracy theorist as a fun snack between meals. If you&#39;re that kind of altered beast. Now come on, let&#39;s go.&quot;</p>
