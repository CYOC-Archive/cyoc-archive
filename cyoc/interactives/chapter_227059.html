<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Calvin decided to do something very unexpected. <br />
<br />
&quot;Make it up to you hmm? What if I said I can change reality and you can to?&quot; Calvin offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d have to say thats imposable and you should prove it.&quot; Zoe countered<br />
<br />
Calvin took the remote out and easily enough set the reality altering to off before fireing it at the miniature Zoe in Sally&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Zoe was stunned still small and sitting on his belly. Then she lifted her hands looking them over as though for the first time amazed at their size and the ease of which she lifted them. In her mind she knew she was Zoe and that she was not supposed to be this small with such huge hands or in the body of her boyfriends mother, but also still retained her memories of the altered reality. This culminated in Zoe simply realizing what Calvin said was true, not fully offended that he may be responsible for her double life experience. <br />
<br />
&quot;You good?&quot; Calvin asked hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah, just damn.&quot; She huffed waving him off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you believe me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be insane not to after that revelation. So is Sally in my body then?&quot; Zoe asked, putting the pieces togther from her two lives.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhmm. Your sure your alright, I figured you&#39;d be freaking out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I kinda am, but I&#39;m also horny as fuck right now and you&#39;ve told me you can change reality with that thing and all I want to do right now is go play with my original body...&quot; Zoe blertted out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was hopeing you&#39;d want to get freaky with your own body, let me show you how it works...&quot; Calvin offered showing and explaining the remote to Zoe.<br />
<br />
After a quick session with the remote for Zoe. one in which she changed small things about Calvin like his hair color and hight before setting him back to normal. (they would play around later) the slinked back down stairs after getting dressed  again and found Sally in Zoe&#39;s body still cleaning up from dinner. While Zoe n Calvin had been fooling around Sally had cleaned the table if dishs and put them in the wash she was now putting away the leftover food and cleaning the cook ware in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Zoe in her doll sized body with regular sized hands nimbly sneaked around the dining room to a good view of the kitchen while easily grasping the remote and fired at Sally. Calvin further back by the stairs but with a good view nun the less eagerly waited to see what Zoe would do to her original body. He&#39;d asked Zoe to have fun and not tell him so he could be surprised.<br />
<br />
First Zoe&#39;s usually trim and toned body bloated outward. Her belly ballooned, thighs expanded, butt became a shelf each cheek as big as a car tier. Her defind neck and sholders sagged as her arms became doughy with rolls. The dress she wore stretched and grew with her now obese 300lb body. <br />
<br />
Until Zoe hit her again and her two fat breasts surged in size shreading the bra and sundress she&#39;d worn.  They descended down her fat gut, not sagging but simply growing huge, massive, gargantuan even! Calvin couldn&#39;t think of a word for them. They were imposable! They were nicely round but each was easily as big as her own body 200 or 300lbs each taking up a massive amount of space and flopping onto the ground. The nipples were bigger then Calvin&#39;s head and the dark brown ariolas nearly two feet around.<br />
<br />
Sally of course was unphased by all this and walked out of the kitchen into the dinning room, her 900lb body no burden to her and the soft flesh flowing though the doorway like water unimpeaded by the fact one breast was wider then the doorframe, let alone her whole body taking up the space of a compact car!<br />
<br />
Zoe dodged out of the way of Sally&#39;s new flowing bulk (Sally&#39;s fat body now having a huge blind spot before her) and waited till she passed before hitting her again.<br />
<br />
This time Sally began to grow upward as she crossed the dining room, Calvin first thought she was stretching taller but heard the *snap* *snap* of leather breaking and saw that her feet were growing over her now torn sandals! Each foot swelled in mass quickly going from plate sized, to platter sized, and upward until both feet were so huge the soles of each would have easily covered the dining room table. Her big toe as large as a beer keg and the smallest (like her nipples) bigger then Calvin&#39;s head. The foot itself was on par with a single sized mattress with box spring with creases and wrinkles as deep as an inch if not two inches. Sally&#39;s body had to be over 1500lbs! The floor didn&#39;t so much as creek in the three steps each foot took to reach their current size and now elevated Sally over 7feet tall, infact her feet were so huge that they now reached under her humungous breasts, kicking their underside with each extended step, sloshing her soft body violently. <br />
<br />
Without noticing the house had conformed to the new titanic size of Sally&#39;s body she strolled to a chair that was now a loveseat perfictly sized for her in the living room facing the TV.<br />
<br />
Calvin had dodged her view as she passed the stairs, her giant feet *fwomp* *fwomp* *fwomp* -ing with each step. Zoe however had been trailing her from the kitchen and as she did fired the remote again!<br />
<br />
This one Calvin had seen before. Like his second experience with the remote, Sally in Zoe&#39;s (outrageously obscene and distorted) body&#39;s hand grew and inflated at the ends of her fat flabby arms. Where once the hand was bloated with sausage like fingers began to grow into their mass soon reaching a balance in fat to size resulting in a regular looking hand, though big enough to fully clutch a basketball! From their the hand grew proportionally until it was on scale with Zoe&#39;s hands to her body&#39;s now matching hers before Calvin shrank her, and somehow still maintaining their womanly grace and fragility. <br />
<br />
Sally then began to sit in the chair her bulk flopping down weightlessly into the seat. She then took her big refrigerator sized hands and pushed her fat flowing breast off to the side, freeing one bed sized footand stretching her leg to &quot;kick-her-feet-up&quot; then did the same to the other side freeing that huge slab of foot. A foot calvin now realized was longer then she was tall!<br />
<br />
As her body jiggled like jello in her seat she let out a sigh of relief finally off her feet from the long day. her large toes and feet still looking somehow dainty and feminin as she wiggled them in the air almost touching the ceiling. <br />
<br />
Calvin slumped onto the stairs looking over all of his girlfriend&#39;s body. Soon Zoe in her doll sized body climed to the stair closet his head, her &#39;regular&#39; sized hand lifting her up each step easily but slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; She said, like an artist that just stepped away from their canvas to take in their piece.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was your process I guess, why all that?&quot; He whispered wanting to see his girlfriends new body in its natural envierment. <br />
<br />
*ahem* she began. &quot;Well first I&#39;ve always been fit and wanted to se what I&#39;d look like fat, so that was the first thing. Next with the feet. Since I remember always being super small like this I kind of developed a fetish for feet since I&#39;m always you know, dodging or right up close to them. And then with the hands I remember having regular sized hands and found I enjoy having the big ones more, and wanted to se what that looked like on a regular person. Oh and the boobs! That was just for fun, having two tits the size of your whole body each? Who dosen&#39;t want to see that!?<br />
Zoe stopped to take in a breath of air  &quot;I gave her body the properties of water so she won&#39;t have to worry about getting stuck, infact she could probably force herself down a pipe or something if she really tried, you know like an octopus. And I also made her body semi-gravity defying so she&#39;s likely over 2200lbs but can control how much gravity affects her. You know for mobility.&quot;<br />
<br />
Calvin was about to voice a question when Zoe spoke up again sharply!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right! I almost forgot!&quot; She announced springing up and firing the remote again...</p>
