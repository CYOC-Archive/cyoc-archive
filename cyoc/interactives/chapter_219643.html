<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Instead of the usual fade back, William found that this transition was almost instant!<br />
As soon as his vision faded to white, he found himself suddenly standing in the bathroom, right before he made his wish.<br />
<br />
Something felt off. He knew he did something wrong.<br />
It only took him a few moments to realise what happened as he found his shirt had completely burst open at the belly.<br />
“SHIT!” He screamed as he stared at himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Staring back at him was not the fourteen year old body he was used to, not the fat version… not even the version from the future. Instead, he saw Lila staring back at him!<br />
“Shit shit shit!” He shouted, looking down to see a pair of large E cup breasts sitting atop a big, round, pregnant belly. His shirt had practically exploded, revealing the popped belly button, the tight skin that surrounded what could only be assumed as… real twins, “no no no!” He said, panicking, his voice sounding just like Lila’s, “how did I mess this up, what did I say wrong!?” He said, holding his head. Then, right outside the locked door he heard a very stern voice. It was Mrs. Lester, his maths teacher,<br />
<br />
“Sir, you cannot be in here. This is a school, if you don’t leave immediately I WILL call the police on you, do you understand?”<br />
<br />
Did that mean Lila was standing outside, most likely in his older, hairy, fat body. Her clothes must’ve been tighter than his, so they may have completely burst open at the seams. She could be totally nude!?<br />
<br />
William quickly rushed to the bathroom door, trying to unlock it. He wasn’t used to this size, it was hard to manage. He was afraid. Terrified. Moreso what they’d do to Lila in his body! Whether he wanted to admit it or not, his body was not the most… approachable looking. Disheveled. Depressed. The last person you’d want in a school.<br />
He finally pulled down the lock, and right as her did, he felt his jeans tear open. He turned his head back to see the butt had completely torn down the seam. He cringed, but had to help Lila before anything. He swung open the door.<br />
<br />
In front of him was a circle of kids swarming around Lila… or more realistically the older, scruffier version of himself. Her clothes completely torn, revealing his former big hairy belly. Her shorts torn revealing her feminine underwear, stuffed with a arguably small package. She looked right at him, eyes wide.<br />
Mrs. Lester stared right at him, her own eyes widen. She looked angry,<br />
“WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DEVIANTS DOING IN THIS SCHOOL!?” She screeched, “I AM CALLING THE POLICE!”<br />
“N-no!” Willaim yelled in his high pitched, feminine voice, “please… just get everyone away from us, we can explain everything!”<br />
<br />
It took a few minutes, but soon the hallway was completely clear. All that remained was Lila, William, Mrs. Lester, and the principal was on his way. Lila and William could only look at each other in horror. Sure, Lila had every right to be pissed at William for getting the wish slightly wrong, but she knew she’d already made a mistake when wording a wish, so she kept it to herself. After all, she was physically an adult… just a different adult, an adult with testosterone running through her body. She was lucky Mrs. Lester wasn’t a man, because she’d totally have a hard-on right now,<br />
“What do we do?” William asked,<br />
“How am I supposed to know,” Lila said. They both kept an eye on Mrs. Lester, on the phone with the principal, “we can’t waste the wish on… making them believe us,”<br />
“No we can’t,” William agreed,<br />
“Can you pull… y’know, something out of your magic pocket thing?”<br />
“Like what?”<br />
“I don’t know!” Lila said a little two loud, Mrs. Lester turned around,<br />
“Are you two really talking right now?” She accused, “both of you aught to be detained, arrested, or even—”<br />
<br />
Mrs. Lester was quickly interrupted by a blast of glitter thrown at her face. Lila looked over to see William had thrown it right at her. The glitter seemed to disappear as Mrs. Lester’s expression completely changed. She looked confused, dazzled,<br />
“What did you do?” Lila asked,<br />
“I have no idea… I don’t know if it’ll make her forget us, or…”<br />
“Or?” Lila asked, waiting for him to finish. He stayed silent<br />
<br />
While she was still dazzled, Lila decided to grab William and start heading for the exit. They both knew the school layout, and they knew they’d have to pass a few corners… especially some corners that passed classrooms. Classrooms with big, glass windows. There was no way to avoid it,<br />
“Right!” William said, he reached into his pocket, pulled out his phone. He quickly tried to call Alicia, but for some reason she didn’t answer, “seriously…” he said,<br />
“How is she not picking up?”<br />
“I have no idea,” William said, “but we just need to get out of her, and cover up or something,”<br />
“WAIT!” Lila said, “we just need to cover up! We can pretend to be… parents. YOU’RE PREGNANT! They’ll believe us. They have to,”<br />
“Sure,” William said. He found a bathroom, luckily a staff bathroom, and the two entered.<br />
<br />
He produced a set of clothes for the both of them. For Lila, he produced a size-appropriate polo-shirt, a new pair of adult mens underwear, a new pair of shoes, and some socks. For himself, he produced an orange dress, fitted for a pregnant woman, and some sandals. He wasn’t confident wearing heels, especially when trying to disguise himself,<br />
“Seriously going commando?” Lila asked,<br />
“What!?” William replied, taking the shreds of clothes off,<br />
“You’re gonna need a bra for those… trust me,” Lila said.<br />
They hadn’t really noticed it until that moment, but they were both standing completely nude. In front of each other. They’d never seen each other nude, and even though they were staring at their own bodies… it still felt a little awkward,<br />
“G-guess I really should’ve shaved, huh,” William said as he struggled to start buckling his new bra,<br />
“Yeah,” Lila said, pulling up her pants, “it’s pretty itchy,” she said, scratching her beard. She couldn’t help but notice William failing to do a bra up. Clearly after ten years of experience, he had no idea what he was doing, “here,” she said, turning him around. She clasped the bra, grabbing his breasts to adjust the bra properly. Then she hesitated, catching herself in the mirror. She was holding his boobs. William looked pretty embarrassed, “I-I’m just trying to help,” she said,<br />
“I know…” he said, “j-just a little sensitive,”<br />
“Tell me about it,” Lila said.<br />
<br />
In around ten minutes, the two were fully dressed. Lila looked like a somewhat professional dad. William looked like a respectable pregnant mother. The two didn’t seem too out of the ordinary. They could surely be taken for a young couple, touring the school.<br />
<br />
They exited the bathroom after sliding their torn clothes into one of the the stalls. They walked into the hallway and made their for the exit. They didn’t want to look too hasty, after all the principal was most likely looking for two people with their exact description.<br />
They seemed to be making it far enough, in fact they were right next to the door before right behind them,<br />
<br />
“Excuse me!” A voice yelled. They both turned to face the principal. Behind him was a small group of students, some of which Lila and William recognised,<br />
“Sorry, we were just heading outside some air,” Lila said, quickly trying to make an excuse,<br />
“We I’ve heard some very disturbing things about both of you,” he said. He came closer to them, the group of students behind him inching closer and closer. They had nothing to do but stand there. It was until William decided to try something out,<br />
“Sweetheart,” he said to Lila, “stand behind me,” he finished. She complied. He reached down his dress, into the cleavage, and produced a handful of similar glitter to before. A few of the students looked shocked, a few aroused. He would admit, he did just reach into his cleavage, he would have done the same their age. He looked the principal in the eyes, then blew as hard as he could.<br />
<br />
The glitter immediately flew all the way down the hallway, lasting for a few seconds before disappearing, just like before. Every single student, teacher, or person present (minus William and Lila) looked completely dazed, their heads spinning as they seemed to be forgetting everything they’d seen. William wasn’t confident when using the glitter on Mrs. Lester, but he knew this time he’d done it right.<br />
Everyone there was going to forget they’d ever seen himself and Lila, as if they’d never been there.<br />
<br />
“Okay lets go,” William said. Lila pushed open the door and escaped the building. They approached the road, waiting for someone. Anyone. Surely Alicia would appear at some point…<br />
The two waited. They waited and waited. But nothing. No one came.<br />
<br />
William decided to call again. But she didn’t answer,<br />
“Shit… what the hell happened?” He asked,<br />
“Maybe that wish… what if…” Lila started, realising what she was saying, “what if you didn’t just switch us…”<br />
“Oh shit,” William said.</p>
