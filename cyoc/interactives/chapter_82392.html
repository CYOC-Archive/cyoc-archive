<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly coming to his senses, Geff looked around knowing he was expected back inside with the eggs and not <br />
having a clue what to make of the vision he had. Maybe a wandering mage was toying with him.<br />
<br />
Geff found the basket, eggs intact, on a bench near by. He recalled that he set it down while moping over this <br />
&quot;lame&quot; storyline.<br />
<br />
Geff grabbed the eggs and headed inside, Mother was surely preparing a nice meal tonight, it was Geff's <br />
birthday after all.<br />
<br />
Geff got to the door of the small cottage and went inside. He found his mother at the stove making a roast <br />
with vegetables, a feast indeed. He set the eggs down and leaned over to kiss his mother. He reached into his <br />
pockets and pulled out his wages and set them on the table. His mother smiled and told him to clean up, dinner <br />
will be done soon.<br />
<br />
Obeying, he grabbed the pail and wash cloth and went back outside. He fetched the water and emptied it into <br />
the pail then carried the pail to the garden and used the wet cloth to wipe down his face arms and legs. He <br />
then dunked his head into the pail to remove some of the oils in his hair and then watered the plants in the <br />
garden.<br />
<br />
He went back to the well, refilled the bucket and brought it in so they could have water with supper. Geff <br />
called for his siblings to prepare for dinner. He had a strange place in the family being the eldest son in a <br />
fatherless home. Pa passed away when Geff was only 10, so he took on some paternal roles as well as brotherly <br />
roles with his siblings and helped his mother where he could, like money for instance.<br />
<br />
Between the four kids and working herself, Mother didn't have time to find a suitor. Geff did what he could <br />
but some roles he couldn't fill and there was only one of him to go around. Times will get better soon though, <br />
Marius, Geff's younger brother will be turning 14 this year and as puberty takes full force he will be able to <br />
help more around the house and take some weight of both Mother and Geff. Also, Elise is 18 and just needs to <br />
pick a suitor. Then there will be one less mouth to feed, as she would surely live with her husband.<br />
<br />
Mildred is 12 and has a lot of growing up to do in the next 6 years but she is adorable. Geff smiled <br />
recalling, the last mishap she caused and the sad face she gave him. She gets away with murder.<br />
<br />
The cottage only has two bedrooms, while Pa was still alive, they had been saving up and were preparing to <br />
move but pa was robbed and killed in the process. An apprentice mage somewhere bungled a spell and he was half <br />
petrified, thankfully he only suffered for a few seconds before dying. His middle half, head hands and legs <br />
excluded. His chest and arms turned to stone and his head was attached to the chunk of rock that was his body, <br />
when the blood in his brain ran out of oxygen, he died. Even will all their savings, mother couldn't afford <br />
the de-petrification and the resurrection and we had to let him go.<br />
<br />
Anyway, after he passed, plans of upgrading halted as Mother couldn't support a larger house by herself, and <br />
the rooms were divided boys and girls. Girls got the master bedroom as there were more of them and it was <br />
larger.<br />
<br />
Geff set the table as the final call went out signaling that dinner was ready and everyone should gather. All <br />
came and sat down, they bowed their heads waiting for Geff to say the prayer, which as the head of the <br />
household, was his duty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Divines, (being non denominational pagans as there were simply too many gods, goddesses, demon lords and <br />
godlike creatures to call by name) we ask that you accept our thanks for the blessing of this meal. We ask <br />
that you continue to offer your blessings, guidance and protections through the coming season.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is at this point that Geff usually would stop and allow the table to eat but he felt compelled to continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please bless this farm and all that grows here, bless this house, and all who dwell here. Bless this table <br />
and all who eat here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Geff felt something welling up inside him, he wasn't doing it right and the pressure was becoming unbearable. <br />
His voice became louder practically beginning to scream<br />
<br />
&quot;NO, forget all that! This food! Bless this food to our bodies! Let it nourish and satisfy us. Let it sustain <br />
us. Let it make us grow strong and stay healthy, and let it be enough to make us all feel full.&quot;<br />
<br />
Geff felt the pressure fall away from him, somehow released. With a sigh of relief he concluded the prayer.<br />
<br />
&quot;In thanks, we pray.&quot;<br />
<br />
Around the table in unison his family returned &quot;In thanks we pray.&quot; though they sounded a little nervous by <br />
Geff's outburst.<br />
<br />
Geff kept his eyes closed for a moment, unsure of what happened, he began to stand to serve the main dish, <br />
again part of his role as man of the house. <br />
<br />
When he opened his eyes he froze in the middle of standing up, the food was all glowing, the carrots, <br />
potatoes, meat, biscuits. Everything had a strange glimmer to it, like his aura before it exploded, after it <br />
went from red to white to brilliant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is everything all right honey?&quot;, mother was inquiring as everyone was waiting on Geff to eat and watching the <br />
look of confused wonderment on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, the food, I blessed it.&quot;, was all Geff could mutter in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you did dear, and it was a beautiful blessing. Would you like me to get the meat for you, for your <br />
birthday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That'd be great Mom&quot; Geff sat back down not sure what to do, then his stomach growled and answered for him.<br />
<br />
I guess we will find out together, Geff thought to himself, too hunger to deny himself even a single bite and <br />
looking at his family, he knew they all felt the same.<br />
<br />
*************************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
The meat was a small cut and being divided 5 ways, there was no meat left for any to have seconds. The same <br />
was true of the vegetables and the bread which was all dished out to plates.<br />
<br />
Looking at his plate the food still emanated an aura of its own which wasn't there before his prayer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh, Mom, Wow!&quot;, Marius had been the first to try it. &quot;Mom, this is delicious!&quot; was all he got out before <br />
shoving another bite into his mouth with extra vigor.<br />
<br />
The girls were now cooing in agreement with full mouths, apparently in oral ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Mother took a bite and herself was surprised at the richness of flavor and began digging in like the others.<br />
<br />
With his entire family focused on eating none noticed Geff poking cautiously. Upon taking a bite he quickly <br />
joined his family in gorging. <br />
<br />
Bite after bite, after bite, was shoveled into his mouth, barely chewed, swallowed. Despite the ferocity with <br />
which he attacked his meal it seemed to barely be dented. Each bite he took seemed more flavorful and filling. <br />
<br />
Geff began to feel a strange sensation when his plate was half empty. It was a new sensation that he didn't <br />
recognize. In the very back of his mind, Jeff had to step up to explain that Geff was starting to feel full.<br />
<br />
Geff hadnt felt this way since early childhood and continued to shovel food into his mouth, enjoying the <br />
feeling. As the last bite of food was finally devoured Geff was stuffed and satisfied. Looking around he wasnt <br />
the only one. everyone at the table looked happy, full, and content. There wasn't a bite left and between the <br />
five of them, none could eat it if there was.<br />
<br />
Mildred stood up and started collecting the plates, Marius joined her and they grabbed the water bucket and <br />
headed out to the well to do the dishes.<br />
<br />
Mother looked at Geff and smiled, &quot;Happy Birthday Geff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Geff smiled back at his dear hardworking mother, &quot;Thank you Mom, I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the food began to get digested, his stomach took over blood flow to send the nourishment throughout his <br />
body and Geff was suddenly very tired, the same was happening to his mother and sister too.<br />
<br />
&quot;My birthday dinner was delicious but I think Im going to go to bed early tonight.&quot; <br />
<br />
With that Geff went to his room, removed his shirt, and collapsed into bed. He heard his mother and sister do <br />
the same, and they were followed by his youngest siblings a moment later after the dishes were put away.<br />
<br />
The entire house fell away, deep into dreamland within moments.<br />
<br />
*************************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
The next morning Geff awoke with a start, he wasn't hungry or tired like normal. He felt great. He grabbed his <br />
shirt and put it on not buttoning it. <br />
<br />
He went out to the outhouse to go to the bathroom remembering to grab several leaves for wiping.<br />
<br />
Upon returning he heard that the rest of the house was stirring as well. Mother was the first he saw, she <br />
looked radiant this morning, full of life and it warmed Geff's heart to see her so full of life.<br />
<br />
Elise skittered past with an embarrassed half smile as she hurried to the outhouse, Geff and mother shared a <br />
giggle at her urgency. She was too tired last night to go through her routine.<br />
<br />
Mildred was up next wiping the sleep from her eyes and already beginning to talk up a storm. Marius was up <br />
last, being in the middle of a growth spurt, he had been keeping odd hours and taking naps midday when <br />
possible. <br />
<br />
Mother had already started breakfast cooking, though Geff didn't need to eat, he grabbed the plates and began <br />
preparing the table, listening to Mildred's constant banter.<br />
<br />
He stopped when he saw Marius step out of their room, he seemed fuller somehow. As though he had gained 30 <br />
pounds of muscle overnight. Geff's old shirt that mother had just resized for Marius seemed tight and ill-<br />
fitting, where just yesterday it fit fine. It must be an early morning trick of the eyes.<br />
<br />
Setting down the last plate, Geff began to button his shirt up for breakfast and found his shirt too was <br />
uncomfortably tight when yesterday it was loose fitting and he had worked the fields all day in it. (Peasants <br />
arent too mindful of hygiene)<br />
<br />
Perplexed but not alarmed they sat down to eat once Elise returned from the outhouse. Oatmeal was dished out <br />
for everyone and although society didn't demand it, it was a household custom to for Geff to say a morning <br />
prayer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Divine, thank you for this day you have given us. Let us enjoy it and enjoy one another's company. In thanks <br />
we pray.&quot;<br />
<br />
The family followed the prayer &quot;In thanks we pray.&quot;<br />
<br />
Geff eyed the food suspiciously, no glowing. No urges to scream prayers out, just a normal prayer. With relief <br />
he began eating.<br />
<br />
Today was Lordsday, the one day per week none were expected to work, which was good because everyone seemed to <br />
sleep in this morning despite the roosters feeble attempts at waking them. In far off lands religious wars <br />
raged between the polytheistic and monotheistic cultures about it being Lords' Day or Lord's Day but all Geff <br />
knew or cared about was the day of play and fun with his family.<br />
<br />
The meal was finishing up and Geff was excited to spend time with his family but also wanted to figure out <br />
what last night was about. Geff thought of the family and how wonderful it will be for Marius to just be done <br />
with puberty and get a job that could bring in extra income.<br />
<br />
Geff scoffed to himself, Look at him going on like that all really happened, I ate a bad berry or something. <br />
His eyes wandered around the table, everyone including himself seemed extra lively and better nourished than <br />
usual. Though the girls didn't seem effected as much they too seemed fuller, healthier. Even sweet, little <br />
Mildred had fuller looking cheeks as she smiled (and constantly rambled on.)<br />
<br />
Although the reality settings were set so Jeff was still able to come out, he was difficult to access. So when <br />
Geff thought of yesterday, or last week, he naturally thought of his time working the farm or fishing with <br />
Marius rather than being a 16 year old doing algebra homework.</p>
