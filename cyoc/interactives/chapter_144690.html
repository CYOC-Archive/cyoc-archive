<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa had been overjoyed, (if not a little tired) over the past week. Thankfully her stay in the hospital had only been a couple of days before she was able to come home. Once home the string of visitors had seemed to be endless as everyone wanted to see baby Lynne. As her birthday approached Lisa found herself home by herself, having kicked Jason out of the house so he could run some errands.<br />
<br />
“You sure you don’t want me sticking around,” he asked tentatively as he put on his jacket. Lisa smirked, placing a tender kiss on her husbands cheek. “Jason I’m fine,” she smiled. “Lynne’s sleeping and I feel pretty good right now. Why don’t you run out and tak care of things. I’ll be fine for a couple of hours.” Jason nodded, taking his cellphone and instructing his wife to call if she needed anything. As he left Lisa sank onto the couch, coffee in hand as she drew her robe around herself. Unfortunately her down time was brief as the soft cries of Lynne forced her upstairs once more.<br />
<br />
Lisa and Jason had out Lynne’s room adjacent to their own, making the walk to the nursery brief whenever Lynne woke in the middle of the night. As she approached the crib she could only smile at the tiny red headed newborn stirring in her crib. “Got quite a set of lungs on you kid,” she said softly, picking the infant up. Making her way back downstairs Lisa felt the child stir quietly in her arms as she fussed. As she sat down she positioned he self to feed Lynne. The tiny newborn hungrily latching onto her breast as she began to feed.<br />
<br />
“Hungry to,” she smirked. “Geez, Don’t think Katie ate like this when she was this age.” As she settled back and began to feed Lynne she found herself lost in thought. It amazed her that she was holding this child now. Lisa had practically given up on having her own child. She was rapidly approaching 40 and the idea of a newborn seemed like a distant possibility, especially with two nearly adult daughters. Lisanhad been worried how she would be able to keep up with an infant at her age. She had been a teenager when she became Katie’s guardian and Gloria was 10 when her and Jason started dating. While she did find herself slightly more tired than she remembered with Katie she was thankfully not overly stressed about having an infant. The one good thing about being an older parent meant her and Jason were a little more well off than over parents with newborns.<br />
<br />
“You know Lynne,” she said quietly. “I really am loving our time together. It’s been so long since I actually held a child this age. Almost forgot what it felt like. Still do wish you and me could talk. That’s the one thing I look forward to, just talking like a I do with your sisters. Guess I got to wait a few years before we can do that.”<br />
<br />
The tiny red haired infant paused in her feeding as she gazed up at her mother with wide eyes. Lisa could almost swear she could see a small smile spread across the infants face as she looked at her. As she was about to say something she felt an odd tingle spread across her body. “What in the,” She whispered, as she glanced around. Lisa was always aware of any odd sensations that occurred, having been around two magical daughters for almost five years. As she looked herself over critically she now tried to see what was happening. “Okay you,” she said softly, narrowing her brow. “What are you up to?”<br />
<br />
The infant Lynne did not respond as she continued to gaze up at her mother. Lisa still felt the tingle coursing through her body though. Something was definitely happening to her, she just wasn’t sure what yet. Quickly placing Lynne in her baby seat Lisa stood, examining herself carefully. <br />
<br />
Lisa was unable to determine exactly what was going on just yet, her tank top, sleep pants, and slippers still fit her comfortably. As she walked towards the hallway mirror she continued to feel the tingles course through her body. “What did you do Lynne,” she thought. As she approached the mirror in the hall her eyes went wide as she gazed at herself. Lisa appeared to be in her mid thirties once more, her hair seemed a little brighter while her face was smooth, the slight crows feet around her eyes having vanished. As she watched her reflection she could see the woman growing younger still. Sighing Lisa tuned back towards her daughter, making her way back to the living room as she felt the sleep pants slip on her waist.<br />
<br />
As a now 32 year old Lisa looked down at her daughter she gave the child a stern look, placing her hands on her shrinking hips. “Okay you,” she said, her voice sounding a little clearer than before. “Care to tell me what this is about?”<br />
<br />
Lynne said nothing as she gazed up at her mother from the comfort of her chair. Although Lisa said nothing she was concerned about what was happening, she was growing younger by the moment and had no idea when it would end. She had seen Lynne perform some magic since her birth, mostly causing Lisa’s breasts to swell whenever she was hungry or levitating a stuffed animal over her crib. Lisa though hadn’t seen her child perform this type of magic before, she was worried now that Lynne would go to far or worse, be unable to fix it.<br />
<br />
“Lynne,” Lisa said, clearing her throat. “Look mommy isn’t mad at you but you should probably stop making mommy little. I’m the only grownup here. If I’m little who is going to watch us?”<br />
<br />
Lynne said nothing as Lisa continued to watch the child. Sighing she looked herself over, slightly alarmed at her bodies appearance. Lisa’s hips seemed to have narrowed while her breasts had become perkier. As she grasped at her ever expanding sleep pants she bit her lip, she was probably in her early 20s now. “Crap,” she thought. “Starting to get real young now. I better call Katie.” Scanning the room Lisa noticed she had left her cellphone in the kitchen. Quickly racing towards the kitchen Lisa grabbed her phone as she called her eldest daughter.<br />
<br />
“Ugh pick up,” the 20 year old groaned, grabbing her too large sleep pants. Unfortunately for Lisa, it appeared Katie wasn’t around. Cursing under her breath Lisa left a quick message for her daughter before hanging up. As Lisa looked herself over she sighed. “Great I’m a teenager again,” she groaned. Carefully making her back towards Lynne she now sat down on the floor next to her daughter, noticing how baggy her clothes were on her teenage body.<br />
<br />
Lisa examined herself carefully once more, wincing as she noticed she looked like a high school senior once more. The tank top was now baggy on the teenage girl while the waist of her sleep pants appeared several sizes too large. Even Lisa’s slippers seemed larger on the girls feet as she now found herself wiggling her toes in the roomy shoes. As she looked at her face she was astound d to see her 16 year old self staring back at her.<br />
<br />
“Lynne,” Lisa said, wincing at the youthful tone of her voice. “Mommy is starting to get really little now. Do you think you can stop?”<br />
<br />
While Lynne did not answer verbally Lisa received an answer as her regression seemed to jump in speed. Lisa let out a small gasp as she shrank slightly, her tank top slipping off one shoulder as her breasts rapidly decreased in size. Even Lisa’s legs and feet seemed to contract as her slippers fell off her feet, while sliding back into her pants. Glancing down at herself Lisa noticed the hens half covering her feet as they slowly r ceded inside. “Eep,” the girl shrieked. “I can’t be more than 13 now.”<br />
<br />
Looking over herself, Lisa was in shock. She was barely a teenager now, her body not only shrinking but losing the gifts of puberty as she raced backwards in age. Quickly grabbing her phone Lisa sent a frantic text message to Katie and Gloria, telling them to come see her as soon as possible. As she finished sending the text she looked herself over, crinkling her nose and groaning in frustration at her appearance.<br />
<br />
The last vestiges of puberty had abandoned Lisa as she slipped backwards from 12, to 11, to 10. The girls tank top barely clung to her shoulders while her feet had completely disappeared inside her now too big and too long sleep pants. “Hey how young am I gonna get here,” Lisa exclaimed as she became 9. Lynne did it answer as she gazed at the young girl. <br />
<br />
Huffing in annoyance Lisa now began looking around the living room, she had a feeling she was going to end up not much older than her daughter in a few moments. While Lynne was safe in her chair, Lisa realized that she wouldn’t be unless she did something. Gathering up as many pillows as she could from the couch she now built a fort around herself. “Hope this works,” the 7 year old said as she now sat in the middle of her improvised pillow fort.<br />
<br />
As Lisa retreated further into childhood she gazed in wonder at the house. Everything appeared so much bigger than what she was used to. Lisa looked over herself, stunned at the 5 year old girl she had become. Lisa’s body was small and skinny now with a softness like any child. The muscle from modeling and sports and even the stretch marks of pregnancy had been wiped away. Lisa had discarded her sleep pants when she built her pillow fortress and now only had her tank top to preserve her modesty. Unfortunately for the girl the straps were wider than her body now meaning the tiny red haired girl had to cling to it in oder to maintain her modesty. Finally Lisa noticed her hair becoming shorter as she grew younger.<br />
<br />
Lisa had never experience this when she had grown younger before. The woman usually didn’t go any small than 4. As she went from 4 to 3 she could feel her hair slowly but surely rising up her back. Grabbing her hair she was astounded it no longer even touched her shoulders as it continued to shrink back into her head. “Wynn,” the 2 year old lisped. “Why baby?”<br />
<br />
Lynne gave her mother a toothless smile as she looked at Lisa. As Lisa dipped below 2 and began to rapidly race towards 1 she could hear the faintest whisper of a voice inside her head.<br />
<br />
“Hi mommy,”<br />
<br />
“Who said that,” Lisa exclaimed. Unfortunately Lisa was so young now that her voice only came out as infantile banter. Frowning the infant turned once more to the slightly younger baby in front of her. “I’m too little to talk now,” Lisa thought in alarm as she became 1. “Holy crap I’ve never been this young before. My body feels so small, and weak right now.”<br />
<br />
The one year old Lisa settled herself back onto her pillows carefully as she gazed at Lynne. Lisa barely had any coordination at this point as she reentered infancy. The tiny red haired infant just gazed at Lynne fearfully, to frightened to move.<br />
<br />
“Mommy can you hear me?”<br />
<br />
Lisa’s small eyes shot open as she gazed around the room. “Who is that,” she thought.<br />
<br />
“It’s me mommy, Lynne.”<br />
<br />
“Lynne,” Lisa thought in alarm. “How is that possible? And how come I can hear you? Or even understand you at this point?”<br />
<br />
Lisa could see her infant daughter chortle as she looked at her. “Babies can only talk with babies mommy,” Lynne thought to her. “That’s why I turned you into a baby. I wanted to talk with you, say thank you for everything you’ve been doing. I heard you saying you wanted a mommy and daughter talk.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah when you were older,” Lisa exclaimed. “How are you able to talk with me. You were just born.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve been listening to you mommy for the last several months,” Lynne said. “I learned from you and I know you love talking with your girls. I just wanted to make you happy.”<br />
<br />
Lisa could only gaze at her daughter p, before chortling with infantile glee. Yes she had wanted to talk with her daughter, she just never expected it would be this soon or under these circumstances.</p>
