<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The voice comes from a pretty cute redhead standing at the top of the stairs. Her curls are wrapped up into a bun and she is wearing a grey school t-shirt with purple plaid pajama bottoms. She&#39;s not fat but her thick body gives her plenty of curves. I like her. She adjusts her green glasses and comes running down the stairs in her house slippers to greet me. She jumps me in my chair in a big hug. Even though she&#39;s a bigger girl than I&#39;m used to carrying, I&#39;m an even bigger werewolf so she doesn&#39;t even feel heavy like she would&#39;ve yesterday. &quot;I&#39;m so happy you&#39;re here!&quot; She climbs out of my lap and sits down on the couch next to me. &quot;My prediction was right! You are a werewolf right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I guess I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! And your initials are J D, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah they are!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re a Virgo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes but how do you know all this? Are you psychic?&quot;<br />
<br />
The cute girl giggles. &quot;Kind of. I&#39;m an Oracle, I can see the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? I thought fortune telling was fake.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl leans in closer, getting excited. &quot;See that&#39;s what I thought too. And most are. But one day I had a dream telling to come here to the House and the gods spoke to me. My room is filled with scrolls, star charts, and journals with prophecies crammed inside from all the past Oracles. Many have already happened, but there are a few that are reaching their moment. Its all very interesting! I&#39;ve been reading through them all summer.&quot;<br />
<br />
She&#39;s a nerd, but she is kind of hot. I can feel my inner wolf start to stir as I look over her body and it likes what it sees. No harm in flirting a little bit. I lean forward in my chair and rest my head on my fist. &quot;So how did you find out about me? Did you dream about me too?&quot; I give a smirk and the girl blushes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, uh, no. I was doing a tarot card reading for a friend from class and I had a vision. I saw you here with us smiling and wearing a birthday hat. The calendar on the wall over there had September on it and a day early on circled. Virgo. And someone got you monogrammed towels.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Towels? That&#39;s a strange gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know but it&#39;s tradition around here. So many people come in and out, that we can&#39;t keep them straight for laundry. Yours were orange, by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm. But how did you know I was a werewolf?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I looked at you, you had claws and fangs, pointy wolf ears sticking out of your hair, and glowing red eyes. Just like all the werewolves I&#39;ve read about.&quot;<br />
<br />
So she&#39;s one of those girls. The ya romance novel girls who read about dashing creatures of the night who fall in love with pure innocent girls and pledge their heart to them. I know because back in high school, half the girls in my class carried around books like this. Girls drooled over the men on the covers and now I&#39;m one of those fantasies.&quot;You&#39;ve read about my kind, huh. How do I hold up?&quot; I raise my massive arms and flex, turning the freckled girl pink. Timid girl. My wolf likes timid girls. &quot;You&#39;re definitely bigger than most. Arlene says you&#39;re the biggest werewolf she&#39;s ever seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; I move from my chair to the couch next to her and stretch my arms around the back of the seat, nearly behind her shoulders. My legs are spread wide off the couch, displaying to her my giant bulge in the too tight jeans. &quot;What else do your books tell about me and my wild side?&quot; I know alot from what George&#39;s letter said, but I want to make her squirm.<br />
<br />
She scoots to the other side of the couch away from me, but her eyes are still scanning over my frame, avoiding my eyes but clearly intrigued. &quot;Well they say you are unnaturally strong and have heightened senses and abilities. Like healing, running, and stamina.&quot;<br />
<br />
My inner wolf is growing more and more restless. I could show her just how much stamina I have right here, right now. But that would just scare her away. If I want her body more than once I can&#39;t be a monster from her books. I have to be sensitive and super seductive like those book&#39;s male love interests are. Being a werewolf needs to add to the intrigue not terrorize her.<br />
<br />
I slide my body closer to her and reach over her with my free arm. She flinches but I only tuck a piece of her hair out of her face and behind her ear. I am inches away from that face, to devouring those lips. To flipping her massive bottom over and pounding into it right here on the couch. But I need to be cool. Instead I caress her face, bringing her mouth closer and closer to my own. I can feel her breath on my face and no doubt she can feel mine on hers. I can hear her heartbeat thumping in her chest and smell the slight sweetness of her growing aroused. She is putty in my hands right now. Thank god she can&#39;t see my erection right now it&#39;ll scare her off. But girls like this love to see their brooding lovers lose control over them so I let myself fall into my Wolf a little, growing into the same werewolf she described in her vision. The sweet smell grows stronger.<br />
<br />
&quot;You-You never told me yout name, J D,&quot; she manages to stutter out. &quot;Joseph DiAntonio. What about yours, beautiful?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wendy. Wendy Jones. Joseph?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes my Wendy?&quot; The wolf echoes that word around and around in my head. My, my Wendy, my, Mine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kiss me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smirk at my winning strategy and pull her face into mine. She doesn&#39;t do anything at first, but I coax her to open her mouth by softly biting onto her lip with my sharp teeth. Once I have her tongue, I growl into her mouth as I further devour her. The kiss quickly turned into a wetter and sloppier make out than I had in mind but she&#39;s not fighting my advances anymore. Her hands find my own face and slowly make their way to my hair, pulling me down to her through my scalp. This makes me growl again and Wendy shivers in my arms. Girls like this at school were always the horniest too.<br />
<br />
Wendy pulls me down until I&#39;m leaning on top of her while she is on her back. I could slide my throbbing cock into her and fuck her so easily from here. I can barely hold my wolf back from fully transforming me. I have to do something to appease it or I will be turning into a giant wolf right here in top of here. And since she&#39;s willing,I move into a straddle while we make out getting ready to make my first move. She&#39;s too overcome with pleasure to notice and keeps kissing me. She moans and I can smell the change in her body. She&#39;s not just aroused... she&#39;s wet! Fuck! I get distracted and let the wolf slip, my muscles being the next thing to grow. They rip through my straining shirt so I throw it off across the room.<br />
<br />
Wendy damn near loses her mind seeing my naked upper body heaving above hers. She breaks the kiss and hazily looks over my face. &quot;Is it always like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With me it is, My Wendy.&quot; She can&#39;t see my giant dick over her large breasts but surely she can feel the heat radiating off if it. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening to me. I&#39;ve never wanted anything so much before. I want you but... will it hurt?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before I can reassure her that I will be gentle (at first), the oracle&#39;s eyes flash a bright white light and her body goes stiff. &quot;Wendy babe? Wendy? Is this one of your visions?&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of giving a direct answer, she instead says in a strange otherworldly voice,&quot;Kiss me.&quot; This is all bit strange but I oblige the scary voice coming from her raw puffy lips and I gently place a kiss on them. As soon as I make contact, my vision goes white. I can&#39;t move my body but I can see some images start to form in the white void. The first scene is of me pulling Wendy into my room and closing the door behind us. I can hear the lock click. Then the vision jumps to us in my bed with both of us fully naked with the sheets pushed down by our feet. I&#39;m on top of her pounding into her roughly as I take a second to ogle her large breasts bouncing with the momentum. We are both clearly enjoying this. As the scene starts to blur to change again, I watch myself climax and howl as my seed blasts into her.<br />
<br />
The scene changes one last time to me following myself walking out of my room and down the stairs in my pajama pants and robe, not bothering with a shirt. Sometime has lassed since the last scene because i have grown a nice trimmed beard. I catch sight of Wendy&#39;s bright orange curls from behind the chair she is sitting in. She&#39;s talking to Arlene and some other housemates I haven&#39;t met yet. I watch myself smirk and leap down the stairs in one jump, not making a sound thanks to my werewolf powers. I land behind her chair and cover her eyes with my hands. &quot;Guess who?&quot; My viewpoint stays right behind him and I can see Arlene and the others smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joey!&quot; &#39;Joey&#39; walks around the chair and kisses Wendy on the cheek before letting me see her... and giant pregnant belly! I&#39;m speechless but Joey keeps on playing through the scene. &quot;You grow more beautiful every morning, my Wendy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got hungry and I didn&#39;t want to wake you up. You get so tired after a full moon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you didn&#39;t come back to bed. You know how much I need to have you after full moon.&quot; Wendy chuckles but the others in the room roll their eyes. One girl I&#39;m a wheelchair says &quot;I swear, Joseph, let the girl chat for moment. You have had her in your bed since her bump first appeared. We&#39;ve only seen you leave to get her food and go to work. Let her mingle. She hasn&#39;t even met the new housemate that came a month ago.&quot; Everyone in the room laughs, but Joey and I are transfixed on the belly of the oracle, though for two different reasons. With only a thin cotton nightgown draped over her body, there is nothing hiding her condition. It&#39;s unreal. Her stomach is absolutely huge, how did she manage to stand or even walk? She looks like she&#39;s about to give birth any minute. And her breasts are each at least the size of her head, full of her mother&#39;s milk for the baby that I can&#39;t believe I am seeing. In there, inside her stomach, is my child. I put that there. She is carrying my offspring. But we haven&#39;t even had sex yet.<br />
<br />
At this point I notice Wendy looking straight at me. Not at Joey but me, right behind his left shoulder. She smiles at me and starts to lift herself out of the chair. Everyone present tries gets up to try to help her, but she waves them off and does it herself. &quot;I&#39;m fine you guys, really. At least one of these little tykes must be a werewolf because I&#39;ve grown way too strong since getting pregnant. Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be able to get out of bed, let alone walk. It&#39;s Diana&#39;s Gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arlene smiles. &quot;Thank goodness for that. Six babies would be too much for one mother too carry at a time without it.&quot;Joey nods in agreement but starts kissing her hand and gently tugging it upstairs. Wendy sighs and waves goodbye to everyone as she lets Joey lift her swollen body into his arms and carry his family into his bedroom, locking the door behind them.<br />
<br />
<br />
My vision goes white again, ending the scene, before fading into our positions on the couch. I&#39;m still on top of her with my still hard dick poking at her poking at her crotch. Her eyes are slowly fading from the bright white from before and once they reach their green color, I can move again. I quickly scramble off of her and push myself to the other end of the couch while she does the same. What do I even say after that?<br />
<br />
&quot;Joseph?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay? That was a vision of the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We had sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We did.&quot; That was the best part of the whole thing. &quot;And you were...pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No? What do you mean no?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to keep these visions straight. I will be pregnant. It hasn&#39;t happened yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. You will be pregnant. With my six children. How did this happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean we almost had sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
I look down at my penis. Yup, still hard. Wendy scoots closer to me. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen a real one before. And it looked like we enjoyed ourselves. And I still want too, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to get pregnant and have six puppies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not right now, but I want you. We can use protection, put off the diapers for a while and just have fun. The vision will come to pass, we can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t fight it.&quot; She scoots closer to me and whispers in my ear, very bold for the timid girl from earlier. &quot;Come on Joey baby. I want your wolf.&quot;</p>
