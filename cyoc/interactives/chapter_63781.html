<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having spent as much time with the girls as you have you start to come up with ideas for using the flashlight on them. Maybe it's due to how you've changed yourself, but hanging out with them has been fun which has you wondering how things will change if the girls change.<br />
<br />
Before you get the chance to figure out how to use the light on any of them without them noticing Megan doubles back and gets behind the two of you. She puts her arms around yours and Stacy's shoulders, &quot;How about we do just a bit more shopping and then head back to my place for a pool party? You can even stay the night if you want since my mom and dad are away on vacation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacy shrugs away and you follow suit.<br />
<br />
Knowing Megan better than you do Stacy looks at her suspiciously, &quot;The way you're smiling says there's a catch, what's the catch?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny and Tammy giggle and Megan smiles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, you got me. It's a pool party and you've got nothing to wear to it,&quot; Megan looks at you with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes, &quot;So Tammy, Jenny and me decided that you need a bathing suit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't mean...&quot; Stacy covers her mouth to hide a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup,&quot; Jenny snickers, &quot;We're going buy your boyfriend a bikini.&quot;<br />
<br />
You'd protest if not for the fact that spending the night with the girls will give you plenty of opportunities to use the light on them, &quot;I'm game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacy lets out a surprised gasp and wraps her arms around you, &quot;This is going to be so cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
They end up picking out a yellow bikini for you because of how good they say you look in a yellow blouse and as a group they usher you over to the changing room to try it on.<br />
<br />
You go into a stall and put the two piece bathing suit on, looking at yourself in the mirrors on the walls. The triangles of cloth look silly on your flat chest and you find yourself distinctly aware of how small you have made your manhood. It's enough to make you feel uncomfortable, almost frightened. The solution is easy enough though, you take the flashlight and put it to a medium blue setting and shine it between your legs.<br />
<br />
Instantly your masculine anatomy grows and a few adjustments of the light later your cock and balls are back to their normal size. To accommodate them the bathing suit bottom has become a speedo, still bright yellow.<br />
<br />
The only problem is, other than your unimpressive physique, you're obviously a guy, which you worry will change the way the girls view you due to reality changing back to be closer to normal.<br />
<br />
Your gaze goes back up to your flat chest and you make your decision.<br />
<br />
Hands shaking slightly from either fear or anticipation you put the light onto a low pink setting and shine it on your chest. The cloth of the bikini fills out a little as breasts bud. They're not even a handful each and you decide to take things a little further, figuring that if you're going to give yourself breasts you might as well give yourself a proper pair. Turning the pink setting of the light up a little more you shine it on your chest again, watching as your breasts swell to what you recognize as being an a-cup, perky nipples causing visible through the clingy cloth of the bikini. You cup them in your hands, feeling your nipples harden as the cloth slides sensually over them. Shuddering slightly at the sensation, you gently roll one of your nipples between your fingers. It feels to good that you nearly moan as your cock twitches, starting to harden and stretch against the fabric of your speedo.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath you try to calm down and give your breasts one more, stronger does of the light to make them swell to a large c-cup. The bikini top stretches over your breasts as they grow, adjusting to accommodate them. The fabric is so tight over them, barely able to contain their full roundness, and tenting over your large, nipples.<br />
<br />
Looking at yourself in the mirror, you turn in a slow circle to look at yourself from all angles, then you bounce a little on your feet to feel the way your breasts jiggle heavily against your chest.<br />
<br />
Someone pounds on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's taking you so long?&quot;<br />
<br />
You recognize Tammy's voice and open the door quickly, catching her off guard and causing her to nearly stumble into the stall.<br />
<br />
Stacy and the other girls look at you with expressions ranging from knowing satisfaction to surprised delight.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how do I look?&quot; You strike a pose, causing the girls to burst into fits of giggles.<br />
<br />
Jenny is the first to speak, &quot;I told you that you've got too good a figure to hide in guy's shirts. I mean it's criminal to cover up breasts like that it a t-shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop ogling my boyfriend,&quot; Stacy gives her a playful shove as you step back into the stall to change back into the outfit the girls bought for you earlier.<br />
<br />
When you take off the bikini top your breasts rest heavily against your chest, retaining their roundness and amazing cleavage even when unsupported. Their weight catches you off guard, an unfamiliar feeling, yet not as strange as you would have expected. <br />
<br />
The power of the light has caused bra the girls got for you to have changed to fit your breasts and when you put it on, a feat that is effortless for you as though you've been doing it for years, you find that it enhances your already impressive cleavage. Not wanting to get yourself excited looking at your own body, you slip into the blouse and miniskirt that the girls got for you.<br />
<br />
You spend a bit more time shopping with the girls until they decide that it's time to leave the mall. The drive to Megan's house is uneventful, with no chance to use the magic flashlight or do anything much with Stacy since you two were sharing the backseat with Tammy and Jenny.<br />
<br />
At the house you all hurry to change into your bathing suits, the girls making you change in the bathroom so that you won't look at them while they undress, not that what you see when you get out leaves anything to the imagination. They're all wearing bathing suits just as skimpy as yours.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to risk damaging the flashlight you leave it with your clothing and go to the pool with the girls.<br />
<br />
You spend several hours in the pool, swimming and splashing with the girls, enjoying the sights and marveling at how they're treating you like one of them. You figure that it's partially due to how the light has altered reality and partially due to how you're making an effort to act like a girl, which takes surprisingly little effort. Giggling at their jokes and gossiping about fashion comes naturally for you. Some of the things you say surprise even yourself, sending the girls into gales of giggles. As far as you can tell, you have a working knowledge of subjects fitting for your altered body with your breasts and no trace of masculinity beyond your masculine anatomy.<br />
<br />
Eventually the girls grow tired and leave the pool to sunbathe. Deciding to take advantage of the situation, you excuse yourself and retrieve the magic flashlight.<br />
<br />
When you return to the pool they're all laying on towels with their eyes closed.<br />
<br />
Just in case you lie down as well, waiting for an opportunity to present itself. Stacy is on one side of you, Jenny on the other. Not wanting to use the light on your girlfriend just yet you look at Jenny, thinking over what you want to do. Recalling what you did to Gene, you decide to go in the other direction with her.<br />
<br />
Turning the light to a very high blue setting you shine it over her, starting at her feet. As soon as the light touches them they grow several shoe sizes, going from cute and feminine to large and hairy. You continue to move the light upward, watching as muscles swell in her legs and hair grows over them. You skip over her crotch, wanting to leave her a girl where it counts, and move the light over her stomach. A trail of hair sprouts, originating somewhere beneath the elastic of her bikini bottom and stopping just below her bellybutton. More than the hair, her stomach hardens and tightens into washboard abs, and when the light reaches her chest her breasts shrink and pectoral muscles swell. For a moment you see how hairy her chest is, then her bikini top turns into a t-shirt. You can still tell how hairy she is, since her heavily muscled arms are also covered in dark hairs. Lastly you shine the light on her face, watching as her black hair shortens into a masculine style and sideburns grow in as well as a five-o-clock shadow.<br />
<br />
Trying not to laugh, you set the light to its very highest pink setting and shine it between her legs, just to be sure that everything is feminine there, her bikini bottom looking quite silly on her narrow hips and otherwise blatantly male body.<br />
<br />
Keeping the light on the highest pink setting you turn to Stacy. Again you start at the feet, though this time there are no visible changes until you reach her hips, which widen slightly. When you reach her breasts there's another change, this one extremely obvious. Her breasts, which you know to be a medium b-cup, grow immensely into something you'd expect to see on a porn star. They're well beyond a double d-cup, maybe even a triple d, her nipples, at least half an inch long, tenting the fabric of her bathing suit as it seems to strain to contain her massive breasts. The changes to her face are subtle, but pleasing, her lips becoming plumper and slightly pouty, her nose becoming slightly smaller, and a sprinkling of freckles appearing across her cheeks and nose. Lastly her already gorgeous red hair lengthens to reach past her butt, becoming slightly curly.<br />
<br />
Done with that you sit up to see if you can get one of the other girls. <br />
<br />
Tammy appears to be asleep, making her an easy target. Switching the light to its highest blue setting you get her between the legs, watching as a cock and balls swell within her bathing suit until the one piece suit changes to a pair of swim trunks and a bikini top.<br />
<br />
Lastly you get Megan, who gets the smallest change. You turn the light to its very lowest pink setting and shine it across her chest, her breasts shrinking to nothing and her bathing suit top vanishing, allowing you to see that her nipples were like those of a prepubescent girl.<br />
<br />
Satisfied you lay back and relax at the girls resume talking.<br />
<br />
Megan sits up and laughs, &quot;Am I the only one here concerned about tan lines?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Stacy asks, her voice a throaty purr, sexy enough that the sound alone is enough to start you getting hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm the only one not wearing a top. I'd have at least expected you to go topless Jenny,&quot; Megan says with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, come on,&quot; Jenny grumbles, her voice deep and masculine. If not for how you can see how snugly her bikini bottom fits over her, giving her a camel toe that would be sexy if not for the fact it was framed by hairy legs and hairy, washboard abs, &quot;Just because I look like a guy doesn't mean I should go topless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why do you spend so much time working out?&quot; Tammy wonders, absentmindedly reaching her hand down into her swim trunks to scratch at her balls.<br />
<br />
Jenny rolls her eyes, but she took off her top, muscles in her arms and chest rippling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Happy now Tammy?&quot; She asks, flexing her arms and making her biceps bulge, &quot;You going to start wanking off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; Tammy snorts, &quot;I'm not a lesbian. No woman is ever going to experience my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stops scratching and pats the front of her swim trunks, &quot;This is for my boyfriend alone, no matter how much you might want a taste of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a lesbian either,&quot; Jenny retorts and laughs, a deep, rumbling chuckle, &quot;I just like working out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And dressing like a guy,&quot; Megan adds with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't have a choice there,&quot; Jenny says, &quot;Even if I cared, I wouldn't be able to find any girl's stuff that would fit me. My shoulders are way too wide and I don't have any hips to speak of. It doesn't bother me though. I mean I'm the strongest and most athletic girl I know even if I do look like a guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't just look like a guy,&quot; Stacy purrs, &quot;If any other girl wanted to date the captain of the football team back in high school she would have tried out for cheer leading, you tried out for the football team and made it. I remember how back then you and your boyfriend would spend hours working out together in the weight room and talking sports.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just can't believe how well it worked out for you,&quot; Megan sighs, &quot;Not only are you and Jared still together, you made it to college on a football scholarship. You have to be like the first girl ever to do something like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
You make a mental note to check your high school yearbook when you get home to see if you can find out more about this.<br />
<br />
Bored with all the talk about sports, Stacy sits up, her breasts jiggling as she does so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I for one don't want tan lines,&quot; and without further comment she takes off her top, freeing her massive breasts.<br />
<br />
You're in awe of what you see. As large as they are you would have expected them to sag, but they retain their lovely round shape, yet look perfectly natural. Her nipples are big and pink, and as she lays back down she runs a finger in a slow circle around one of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you take off your top too hon?&quot; she purrs at you, &quot;You're a guy so you shouldn't be afraid of showing off your titties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most guys don't have titties,&quot; you remind her.<br />
<br />
She giggles, a wonderfully bubbly sound, &quot;But you're my boyfriend and you do, and they're such hot titties too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling slightly awkward, but enjoying how much fun this is proving to be, you comply with her request. Stacy winks at you and licks her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to be the odd one out,&quot; Tammy giggles and takes off her top as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jared would die if he were here now,&quot; Jenny laughs.<br />
<br />
Tammy sat up and looked at her with a puzzled expression, &quot;Does Jared even like breasts?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What guy doesn't?&quot; Jenny seems confused for a moment until the meaning of the question sinks in, &quot;Oh I get it. Yeah, he likes breasts and he does wish that I had 'em, but he'd rather have a girlfriend like me who knows sports and can throw a football. I mean when was the last time one of you watched the Superbowl with your boyfriends? You'd much rather drag them off to the mall, and what guy likes that? No offense.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she says the last part she looks at you with a smile.<br />
<br />
You smile back, amazed at how reality has changed and how different your girlfriend's friends have become. You're tempted to keep them like this just to hang out with them more in the future.</p>
