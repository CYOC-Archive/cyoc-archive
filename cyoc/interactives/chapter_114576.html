<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Its a picture of a female torso with a large womb with two pink babies and A-2. What does that mean? Jenifer feels her age drop two years, her bust grow from b cup to c cup and her ass grow back to the full heart ass she had before the squalid made her go on that diet. Her skirt grows to a body hugging pink dress with a short skirt. She finds her other sock and two inch wedge heel shoes. She giggles as she grabs her purse with backpack and goes next door to Kyle`s house. <br />
Kyle answers the door to see a sexy freshman girl at the door. Jenifer was getting hornyer with each steep, her hard nipples were showing thru her dress and her pussy juices were dribbling down her legs, by the time she rang the bell of Kyles house. Jenifer kisses Kyle and pushes him back in his house.  Kyle`s dick gets hard the moment he saw the now freshman Jenifer, He leads her to his room. Jenifer has her shoes and sock off by the time they get their and she is unzips her dress. Kyle gets his clothes off. Jenifer realizes she had not been wearing underwear as she drops her dress. Kyle kisses Jenifer as he pulls her down on his bed.  Jenifer opens her legs her oozing pussy an inviting sight to Kyle. Soon all thought is drowned by lust for both of them as Kyle slides inside Jenifer. The feeling of his dick sliding into her pussy making her moan with pleasure. Kyle gaps as Jenifer starts to wiggle under him. Jenifer has her first orgasm as Kyle`s dick bounces off her maiden head. &quot;Brake it Kyle, I give you my virginity&quot; Jenifer moans in his ear. Kyle pulls back making her moan again. Kyle grunts as he rams thru her maiden head, Kyle feels her vagina grabs his dick. Lust and pleasure sweeps Jenifer in to the best feeling she has ever felt. This is worth getting pregnant, Jenifer thinks as she comes again. They find a matching rhythm and they kiss again as Kyle runs his hands up Jenifer`s breasts. Kyle comes inside Jenifer blasting his seed up to her unprotected womb. Kyle keeps kissing Jenifer as her pulls out of her making her come again with a moan. They get dressed again as both their Zenith glasses show the bus is five moments away.  Jenifer gasps as a pleasant feeling goes thru her as her breasts grow to cc cups, her hips widen a bit and a orgasmic surge her womb expands to nine months pregnant and feels four feet kick inside her.   Jenifer smiles as she rubs her womb as Kyle helps her down stairs. Her slut dress becomes a maturity dress. Jenifer remembers how she and Kyle first screwed on her fourteenth birthday nine months ago. She remembers our babies are Nancy and Olive, umm olives that&#39;s a mane thing she craved thru out the pregnancy. Twins run in Jenifer`s family like her mom is a twin and she has a twin named Kelly and twin eight year old sisters named Lana and Mindy. &quot;I wish we could get married but I found out but we have to be sixteen even with parents permission&quot; Kyle says. &quot;Me too Kyle&quot; Jenifer says. &quot;Its just two years, I am shore we will still be together&quot; she says. Kyle kisses Jenifer`s womb witch makes her giggle. Kyle gets his backpack and they steep toward the door to catch the bus. Jenifer`s water brakes as they steep on to the lawn. Jenifer sits on the steeps as the first contraction hits her. Kyle calls emergency with his glasses. &quot;Hello, my girlfriend`s having her twins right now&quot;.  The bus gets their. &quot;Is she all right?&quot; asks Dave Martin  the bus driver. the kids call him mister Marty. &quot;Hi Mister Marty, my twins have decided today is a good day to be born&quot; Jenifer says. Dave taps his own glasses and says &quot;Dale Glen high school, this Dave Martin Jenifer Smith will not be in she is having her twins right now&quot;. &quot;Kyle I am going to get every one else to school, ok &quot; Dave says. Susan one of Jenifer`s best friends peeks her head out and say &quot;O` god, the twins are coming Jenifer&quot;. &quot;Yes, they are Susan, you go to school then meet me at the birth center after school&quot; Jenifer says. &quot;Will do Jenifer&quot; Susan says. &quot;Sit back down, Susan&quot; Dave says. Susan sits back in her seat but spreads the news that Jenifer is having her twins. They both call there parents. &quot;Mom, my water broke coming out of Kyle`s place&quot; Jenifer says. The ambulance gets their and the paramedics load Jenifer in it. &quot;Mom they have put me in the ambulance and I have to hang up.&quot; Jenifer says. Kyle kisses Jenifer and says &quot;I will see you after school, love you Jenifer&quot;. &quot;I love you to Kyle&quot; Jenifer says As the ambulance pulls away. Kyle gets on the bus. Jenifer gets to the birth center. &quot;Dad, I just got to the birth center, yes I am excited to be a mom, mom all ready knows, no Kelly, Lana and Mindy should be kept in school, they said in birth class that it could take thirdly or more hours for twins to be born.&quot; . In her office, Iris Smith called her second daughter unshore what she must be hearing. &quot;Kelly, its mom, yes Jenifer is having her twins, no Jenifer said you should just meet us at the birth center, yes I am about to call Sandy Landers to drive you, Lana and Mindy their after school&quot;. &quot;Ok mom, the teacher is calling me, bye mom&quot; she said. &quot;Kelly, do you want to go , I understand your twin sister Jenifer is giving birth&quot; the teacher says. &quot;Yes, Jenifer is having Nancy and Olive right now, but that could take over a day to happen, I am so excited to be an aunt&quot; Kelly brakes into giggles. She had held babies had by cousins, her aunt Hellion had her first child as a teen and that cousin has her own baby as does her sister, Kelly plans to weight until she can at lest marry the father if they want. &quot;No, I will stay in school&quot; Kelly says. she walks to the back of the class. &quot;I need to call Jenifer then I will then rejoin the class&quot; she says. &quot;Hi Jenifer, how are you feeling? I will get your homework and some make up work. Yes, I will have a good day in school&quot;. &quot;I am feeling good, the counteractions are twenty moments apart and the doc says they should stay that way for some time, o` the twins are really active, I think they are as excited to meets us as we are to meet them. You should get back to school&quot; Jenifer hangs up.  Sandy Landers had baby sat for the Smith`s sense she was fourteen, now nineteen and single mom, the Smiths had been good to her, so when Iris calls to says she wanted Sandy to drive Kelly, Lana and Mindy to meet their nieces, Sandy is more than willing to do so. She is some thing of a big sister to Jenifer and Kelly.   Ivan Smith hums a happy tune as he drives to meet his wife and oldest daughter at the birth center. The more his co-workers had said he should not support Jenifer in becoming a mom this young the more, he expressed support for her.</p>
