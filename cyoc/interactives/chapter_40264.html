<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time Darrel had gotten himself together and was ready to leave, the work day was over, but all he had for transport was the Brown Van Parcel Service truck outside, still parked on the curb.  <br />
<br />
He reached into his uniform and retrieved the keys to the truck.  He’d need to drop the truck off back at the yard, he only hoped Big Tony the yard manager wouldn’t be there.  After hours guys with seniority like Darrel could drop off the trucks without any hassle.  They didn’t get paid for the extra time, of course, but it was a nice perk to be able to drop the truck off after dark.  Thinking about the code Darrel panicked for a second as he couldn’t remember it but after a minute or two it came back to him.  He was afraid the change had altered his brain, but it was simply all that he’d been through in the last few hours.<br />
<br />
If Tony WAS there, he hoped he’d buy his lame story and believe he was an older brother of the man Tony knew as Darrel, dropping off the truck for him because he was violently sick.  It might also cover, at least for a little while, the reason Darrel didn’t finish his route and why he would be absent the rest of the week.  After that, Darrel didn’t know what he was going to do.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t the best story, but it might work.  After all, he looked enough like he used to so that he ‘could’ be Darrel’s brother… Darrel’s big hairy GAY brother!  Darrel thought.<br />
<br />
He got into the van and headed to the yard.  Once there he punched in the code and drove in.  It looked all clear, he parked the van and walked over to the drop box to deposit the keys.  <br />
<br />
“No sign of Big Tony yet, thank God!” he muttered to himself as he headed towards his motorcycle.  He pulled the chromed helmet off the ape hanger handlebars of his chopper when he felt a hand on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Darrel spun around to see all six foot eight inches of Antonio “Big Tony” Bruno staring him right in the eye.  Calling him Big Tony was completely apt.  The man was tall and almost impossibly broad with big arms covered in thick silver hair that had once been jet black.  The blurred and somewhat faded tattoos were easier to see on his arms under the silver hair.  The man’s biker style mustache was wide, dense and bushy and continued down past his chin and under and was of the same silver color.  He had dense fairly long, for only a day’s work, stubble all over his cheeks and neck but Darrel knew Tony’s beard grew fast.  That beard would join the forest of fur on his chest and back all the way around his neck if he’d let it grow.  Tufts of silver poked out around the collar of his short sleeved brown uniform shirt.<br />
<br />
Darrel, having been changed, oh so recently, was shocked to feel his cock beginning to inflate and wondered why he’d never noticed how absolutely stunningly gorgeous his rugged looking, broke nosed, friend was.  Tony was definitely muscle-goon material, the kind of guy who a few generations back would have been muscle for the mob, but that wasn’t Tony.  Tony was a good guy, a true and loyal friend and he “kept his nose clean” as he was fond of saying.  He had cousins who didn’t, but that was the other side of the family.<br />
<br />
“Who da fuck are you an’ what da fuck are you doin’ wid my buddy’s bike?”  Tony growled.<br />
<br />
Tony was a really good friend; they’d drunk themselves stupid too many times to count and helped each other home after.  Darrel in his startled state almost blurted out, “It’s me Tony!  What the fuck do you think I’m doin’, ya fat bastard?” but quickly remembered why Tony didn’t recognize him.<br />
<br />
“Uh… I’m Dar…” and Darrel almost slipped up but covered it with a quick cough, “I’m Darren Ross, Darrel’s brother.  I was just dropping off his truck and taking his scoot home.”  Darrel hoped that would do it<br />
<br />
“Izat so? ‘Cause I don’t remember nuthin’ ‘bout Darrel havin’ a brother an’ we’s been friends for a good ten years.”<br />
<br />
Big Tony was bustin’ his balls and he’d have to think quick.<br />
<br />
“Darrel and me didn’t get along much after… well… after I…” Darrel was grasping for an idea.<br />
<br />
“After you what?”  Tony unfolded his arms and balled up his fists.  He wasn’t buying the story and it looked like Darrel’s best friend in the world was going to try to beat the shit out of him for trying to steal his “brother’s” bike.<br />
<br />
Darrel paused.<br />
<br />
“After what, I’m waitin’…”  Tony said and repositioned the unlit nub of a stogie from his fist to his mouth and re-clinched his fist for use.<br />
<br />
Darrel, bowed his head and looked down and saw the Bear paw belt buckle and got a brilliant idea.  Keeping his head hung as if in shame he said quietly, “Darrel and me stopped bein’ close after I came out of the closet.”  He looked up into Tony’s eyes with what he hoped was defiance and said, “I’m queer, OK?”<br />
<br />
Tony’s reaction was one of shock at first, but then a huge grin parted his face and he relaxed his fists.<br />
<br />
“So dat’s why the kid never said nuthin’ ‘bout no brother!  An’ lookin’ at you now, I can see the family resemblance…  So… You’re his gay brother, ‘eh?”<br />
<br />
Darrel just nodded.<br />
<br />
Big Tony leaned in, in and looking Darrel/Darren straight in the eye said with a mock conspiratorial whisper, “You’re among family, I’m queer too?”  Tony straightened up, chewing on his nub of a cigar and said, “Whaddaya tink ‘bout that?” folding his huge meaty arms across his broad chest in his own display of defiance.<br />
<br />
Darrel was shocked and it apparently showed.<br />
<br />
“So what?  You think only pretty boy bears like you can be gay?  Us ugly fuckers ain’t got no biznus bein’ bears?”  Tony said raising one bushy silver eyebrow, taking the nub of his cigar out of his mouth and tossing it on the ground.  The pair were only standing a for or so apart and Darrel, overcome with a surge of lust grabbed his long time friend and pulled him into a tight fierce kiss which was, to his surprise, eagerly returned.  Huge hairy arms squeezed Darrel tightly in his first true bear hug as the pair tongue wrestled and as they kissed, Darrel thought, “If I wasn’t gay before, I am now.”<br />
<br />
Big Tony broke the kiss and said, “Woah woah woah, hang on a minute!  You mean to tell me Darrel has a problem wid you bein’ queer?”<br />
<br />
Darrel lied again, “Well, that’s sorta why I’m in town.  He wanted to make up.  Said he’s come to realize he was wrong.”<br />
<br />
Tony smiled, “Well he bedda, ‘cause even if he don’t know I’m a fag, he bedda show respect for family, know what I mean?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I know.”  Darrel said.<br />
<br />
“Hey, how ‘bout you an’ me hit the road an’ grab sum beer and a slice somewhere?  I think I wanna get to know you bedda.”  Tony said.<br />
<br />
“That’d be great?  Any idea where?”  Darrel smiled, “I’m new around and don’t know the streets.”<br />
<br />
“No problem.  Follow me, I know just da place.&quot;  Tony said with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, where's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're headed over to Annabell's in da Lavender District, you'll love it!  Great pizza an' hot hairy guys makin' it.  Da beer's good an' cold too.  I got pals I hang out wid over there.  My scoot’s parked ‘cross da lot, so hang on for a bit.”  Tony said as he turned to go find his ride.<br />
<br />
And with that Darrel mounted his bike, tightened the chin straps on his helmet, fired up his chopper.  He waited and when Tony rode by he followed him out the gate.</p>
