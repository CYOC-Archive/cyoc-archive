<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff stirred in bed.  He felt the warm sun on his back and right arm.  He felt Scott’s heavy body partly on top of him, one of Scotty’s arms over Jeff’s shoulder holding Jeff’s left hand in his. Jeff moaned, stretching his muscles, and Scotty rolled off of him to lay beside him, wearing that charming grin that could melt an iceberg.  “Mornin&#39;, boyfriend.”  He took Jeff’s hand and kissed it.<br />
<br />
Jeff yawned, turning over and stretching.  “Mornin’.”<br />
<br />
“How’d you sleep,” Scotty asked, stroking his boyfriend’s arm playfully.<br />
<br />
“Like a log.  I was exhausted.”  Jeff snuggled against Scott, and Scott put his arm around him.<br />
<br />
“So I guess today we start our search for this TransDem Labs.”<br />
<br />
“About that,” Jeff said thoughtfully.  “I’ve been thinking…”<br />
<br />
Scotty looked at him questioningly.<br />
<br />
“I know you don’t believe it, and I don’t really blame you.  And I do still need to find it,” Jeff continued.  “But if we find out that my resetting everything would pop you out of existence or even leave you single and alone, then I’ve decided to leave things as they are now – as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone.”<br />
<br />
“But, I can’t ask you to do that,” Scotty said, clearly moved by what Jeff was saying.  He scratched at his hairy chest, somehow it looked even hairier now than yesterday.  “What about your real family, and your friends – and your real life?”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled warmly at him with big brown eyes.  “I like being with you.  After last night, it’s really the only choice I could make – I couldn’t hurt you or risk your life.  You wouldn’t ever hurt me or risk mine.”<br />
<br />
“I know, but still…” Scotty’s eyes sparkled with emotion.  Jeff didn’t know if it was just the lighting, but the hot blonde quarterback definitely looked hairier than yesterday – arms, legs, blonde hair seemed somehow both longer and shorter, but whatever it was it definitely added to his all-American beefcake charm.  “You have no idea how much this means to me.  I… I just want so much to be with you.  I know we both felt it last night.”<br />
<br />
“Anything for you, Scotty,” Jeff said in his low, sexy voice, but dodged a kiss, then laughed.  “Sorry, morning breath – I need to mouthwash first.”<br />
<br />
Scotty took Jeff’s hands in his own hairy hands.  “Thank you… you’re so amazing,” he said with a soulful expression of gratitude on his face.  His stubble seemed to have thickened into a beard overnight, and Scotty had a serious case of morning hair, sticking right up in the center.  Jeff laughed and ruffled it.<br />
<br />
“What, because I don’t want to expose you to my morning breath?” Jeff laughed again, all grins.<br />
<br />
“No, thank you for being the man on the inside that I always dreamed of,” Scotty said with those sincere, sparkly eyes.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled at him.  He couldn’t believe how defined Scott&#39;s muscles looked today, despite how very hair his body was – every bit the big, hairy jock.  “Are you kidding?  How could I not stay with you?  Now we have the rest of our lives to spend together.”<br />
<br />
“Oh dude, I’ve dreamed of hearing you say that for so long,” Scotty admitted.  Jeff played with Scotty’s ear, smiling mischievously at him.  It felt so good, the blonde laid back.  “I want to spend the rest of my life with you,” Scotty sighed, happily.  Jeff continued playing idly with his ear, and it felt even better than before.  It was getting harder for Scotty to think, he was getting so turned on, as witnessed by the naked man’s cock slowly growing larger.  He smiled up at Jeff, who was propped up on his other arm.  “You truly are the love of my life.”<br />
<br />
“I know, donkey.” Jeff giggled, watching Scotty’s eyes roll back as Jeff played with his ear, the blonde’s huge cock nearly reaching his mouth now, he was so raging hard and at the angle at which he was sitting in bed.  Suddenly, Jeff stopped and sat up.  “Oh fuck, I forgot we have to get to the gym soon for our workout.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Oh man,” Scotty rubbed his eyes, and sat up himself, his mane sticking up comically in the middle.  “I completely forgot too.”  He got up, starting to look for something.<br />
<br />
“So you know, I never really paid attention before, but is that a sports watch you always wear?” Jeff asked.  “I was thinking of getting one myself to help keep my heart rate up while working out, but thought maybe you know the best one to get.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah my folks got it for me – it helps a lot with workouts,” Scott answered absently, rummaging through his bureau as his eyes searched the bed for something.  Jeff never noticed how hairy Scotty’s back was, the jock almost looked like a big hairy animal.  The hair on his butt was pretty thick.<br />
<br />
“After our workout, we should start looking for TransDem Labs,” Jeff said, sitting on the side of the bed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Scotty said as his eyes searched the floor now.  “I don’t think we’re going to find it though, I bet it’s just one of those little Asian toy companies that pops up for a year or two and then disappears.”<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed.  “I know you don’t believe me, and I can&#39;t say I blame you, but we at least have to try.”<br />
<br />
&quot;I just don&#39;t want you to get your hopes up,&quot; Scotty sighed this time.  “I’m really sorry, Jeff.  I love you and I&#39;d do anything for you, but I don’t believe any devices exist that can transform people like that.”  The forest of hair from his armpits was so long and thick it sprung out from the front and back even when his arms were down.<br />
<br />
“You mean devices that can turn people from wimps into football studs,” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“Exactly, it takes years of hard work,” Scotty reasoned, “There’s no substitute for dedication and doing the work, otherwise why waste all that time in a gym.”<br />
<br />
Jeff spied something hanging from Scotty’s backside, between his legs.  “Or grow tails and donkey ears..?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Scotty said only half paying attention.  “Have you seen my watch?  I can’t seem to find it anywhere.”<br />
<br />
“This it?” Jeff held it up.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Scotty looked relieved, “Let’s seEEE HAAWWW!”<br />
<br />
“Just a sec,” Jeff said, looking at it.<br />
<br />
Scotty reached out a hoof,  “I nEEEED it HAAAAWWWW!”<br />
<br />
“TransDem Labs,” Jeff read off the ‘watch’.  Jeff looked up at the very hairy, muscular jock standing before him.  Though jock wasn’t quite accurate any more, with his Mohawk-like mane standing up, his long donkey ears twitching on either side of his head, a very donkey-sized cock jutting out and twitching between his legs with big hairy balls underneath that nearly hung to his knees, hooves on the ends of his arms and legs, and a tasseled donkey tail snaking around from his ass.<br />
<br />
“HEEE HAAAAW,” Scotty gave a loud bray from the large buck teeth puckering his mouth.  “HAAAAAW HEEE HAW!”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked up at him nonchalantly.  “I guess your ‘toy company’ makes watches too.”</p>
