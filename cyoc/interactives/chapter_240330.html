Rick Barber lay immobile in the hospital bed, the sterile cast encasing his battered body like a tomb. He’d woken briefly on several occasions, each time overcome by the feeling of something crawling beneath his skin—the maggots they had used to clean the dead flesh. He had screamed, thrashed within the cast, and begged for relief, but each time, the doctors had sedated him again, his pleas fading into darkness. They had reassured him it was for his own good. What they didn’t say was that Rick had become something of an experiment—a man caught between life and death, saved by procedures no human body was truly meant to endure.<br />
<br />
The explosion had left his body ravaged beyond recognition. Burns covered over 80% of his skin, flesh fused with fragments of his uniform, melted plastic embedded in raw, oozing wounds. Yet, what no one in the medical team understood—what they couldn’t see—was that the fire had carried something with it. The explosion had ruptured hidden tanks of volatile chemicals, unleashing a cocktail of experimental compounds into the air, particles invisible but insidious. These substances, a mix of radioactive isotopes, engineered nanopolymers, and bio-reactive agents, had clung to Rick’s body, sinking deep into his exposed tissue and bloodstream. The fire had stripped him bare, but these compounds had soaked into what remained, embedding themselves in ways that no test could yet detect.<br />
<br />
-The Recovery Period-<br />
Rick’s recovery stretched across four months, each week marked by progress that seemed nothing short of miraculous. The burns should have left him disfigured for life, but the medical team employed cutting-edge experimental therapies designed to regenerate tissue at an unprecedented rate. Bioengineered skin grafts were applied to his raw flesh, integrating seamlessly with his remaining tissue. Nanites, microscopic machines programmed to repair and rebuild, worked tirelessly inside him, weaving new skin and muscle fiber where there had been none. Stem cells, injected directly into the worst of his wounds, accelerated the growth of new tissue, filling in gaps where flesh had been burned away.<br />
<br />
The maggots had done their part, consuming the dead flesh and keeping infection at bay, but unknowingly, they had interacted with the foreign compounds embedded in Rick’s body, their secretions altered by the chemical residue. What they left behind wasn’t just clean, healthy tissue—it was tissue unlike anything human, subtly changed at a microscopic level.<br />
<br />
To the outside world, Rick’s recovery was a medical miracle. By the end of the second month, his burns had all but vanished, replaced by skin that was smooth, unblemished, and oddly resilient. The bioengineered grafts worked almost too well, leaving him looking healthier than he had in years. His muscle tone returned quickly, even without regular physical therapy, as though his body was working overtime to rebuild itself. His weight stabilized, and while his scars faded to nearly imperceptible marks, the doctors noted a strange elasticity to his skin—a flexibility and resilience they couldn’t explain.<br />
<br />
By the end of the fourth month, Rick was walking unaided, his strength almost fully restored. Internal scans showed some lingering anomalies in his blood and tissue, but the medical team couldn’t pinpoint their significance. “It’s probably nothing,” the lead doctor assured his colleagues, though his tone betrayed a trace of unease. “But given the experimental nature of his treatment, we’ll need to keep him under observation with regular check-ups. Every two weeks, minimum.” The team agreed, though no one voiced the concerns hanging silently between them: Rick’s recovery had been too good to be true.<br />
<br />
-The Release-<br />
The day Rick was discharged from the hospital was overcast, the faint chill of autumn in the air. He stood in the hospital lobby, dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in months. His uniform, charred and fused to his skin during the explosion, had long since been discarded, replaced now by comfortable jeans and a loose sweater. He had expected to feel fragile, to limp or struggle with his movements, but instead, he felt unnaturally strong. His body moved with a fluidity that didn’t feel entirely his own, as though his muscles were responding faster than his brain could command them.<br />
<br />
Before leaving, the lead doctor approached him, a clipboard in hand. “Rick, I’m going to be honest. Your recovery is remarkable—unprecedented, even. But given the treatments we used and the… experimental nature of some of them, we want to keep monitoring you. It’s important that we catch any long-term effects early, if there are any.” He paused, meeting Rick’s gaze with a mix of professional concern and something else—unease, perhaps. “We’d like you to come back for check-ups every two weeks. It’s precautionary, nothing more.”<br />
<br />
Rick nodded stiffly. He had no reason to refuse, though the thought of returning to the hospital after finally leaving it made his stomach churn. “Yeah, sure. Whatever you need.”<br />
<br />
The car ride home was quiet. Rick stared out the window, watching the world pass by, but his thoughts were elsewhere. He couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right. His body felt fine—better than fine. But the faint tingling under his skin hadn’t gone away. It was as though something inside him was still healing—or still changing. He rubbed his arms absently, frowning when he felt the smoothness of his skin. It was perfect, almost too perfect, with an elasticity that didn’t feel real.<br />
<br />
When the car pulled up to his house, Rick stepped out, his boots crunching against the gravel driveway. He stared at the front door for a moment, his heart skipping a beat at the thought of seeing Sarah again. She had spent weeks preparing for his return, texting him updates about the house and how much she missed him. But as much as Rick wanted to see her, he felt an undercurrent of apprehension. He hadn’t told her about the nightmares—the ones where his skin crawled and shifted, where he could feel something alive beneath it, moving of its own accord. He hadn’t told her about the flashes of heat that radiated from his body when no one else seemed to notice, or the way his senses seemed sharper, more attuned to the world around him. He didn’t know how to explain these things, because he didn’t understand them himself.</p>
