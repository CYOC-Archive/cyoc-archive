<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Locker rooms, huddles, practice sessions, bus rides to away games. All of these mundane aspects of being on the football team put Andy in close quarters with all of his teammates, which gave the contagion ample opportunity to spread. And spread it did.<br />
<br />
At first, the only noticeable effects were a few more points scored then usual. Then before long they were winning more games than losing. Then they were winning in total blowouts.<br />
<br />
Two more months after Andy went through his growth spurt, the team had just finished the last game of the season and were celebrating as they filed into the locker room. But the men who were filling the locker room hardly looked like the assortment of boys who comprised the team two months prior. The locker room looked more like the backstage of a bodybuilding competition than a group of high schoolers. Even the smallest of them looked like lean fitness models.<br />
<br />
Dean was one such team member. Dean was a short skinny freshman. Even for a 14 year old he was short at 5&#39;1&quot; and he looked more bone than muscle. His overbearing jock of a dad had more or less forced him to join the football team in the hopes he would &quot;man up.&quot; Well, thanks to the contagion, Dean&#39;s dad got his wish. Now Dean was 5&#39;10&quot; and built like a prize winning physique competitor. Lean and striated, Dean&#39;s 174 pounds of muscle looked more aesthetic than tough. He was perfectly symmetrical and had long, full muscle bellies and had a statuesque beauty. His squared shoulders tapered down to a perfect 10 pack. Even his face had reformed to become more attractive. He easily could have modeled if he wanted to. <br />
<br />
Sam was an ex track runner who was recruited to the team by the coach for his speed, but he had struggled to put on the size that the coach wanted and remained one of the skinnier players on the team. Now, however, after the contagion has had its way with him the sophomore was one of the biggest. Despite his height of 6&#39;4&quot;, he could&#39;ve held his own against any heavyweight bodybuilder. His 281 lbs lent him massive striated pecs and shoulders tapered dramatically down to his wasp waist. His arms were corded and vascular with biceps like softballs.  Sam maintained his slender joints which only served to emphasize the size of his muscles. His legs were almost the size of his waist and his calves looked like cut diamonds. Not an ounce of fat could be found on his body to slow down his lightning fast performance on the field.<br />
<br />
Cody was the team&#39;s linebacker. He was a junior who had been involved in sports as long as he could remember, going back to elementary school, and much of that was football. Even before the contagion got to him he was exceptionally large. At 6&#39;5&quot; and almost 240 lbs he was a wall of bulk. Not lean, but wide, thick, and powerful. After 2 months with the contagion though, he was a giant. In just those two short months, Cody had blown up to an absolutely massive 6&#39;10 and 337 lbs. He had gained an unheard of 100 lbs in two months and was the subject of a lot of controversy and investigations for performance enhancing drubs, but every time he came up clean, so the opposing teams who feared having to face Sam were forced to concede and let him play. Never the lean model or bodybuilder type, Cody looked more like a powerlifter. A healthy layer of fat coated his body, but did little to hide his musculature. In fact it just made him look thicker. Cody was a huge brutish hulk with wide sloped shoulders that could only hope to fit through double doors. His traps almost reached his ears and his arms hung at his sides like hams. His pillar like waist bowed out with muscle. So developed were his abs that even with his body fat a faint 6 pack could still be made out on his abdomen. Legs like tree trunks gave him a foundation that powered him through opposing players like tissue while making him an immovable brick wall.<br />
<br />
Diego was a senior, but he never grew past 5&#39;4&quot;. He had become self conscious about his height which led to work out religiously as if to make up for his lack of height. The short gym rat had achieved a tight muscular body, but much to his frustration he plateaued early. Most would have said he had an impressive body nonetheless, but Diego wanted more. Unlike most of his teammates, the contagion ended up not making Diego any taller, but what he didn&#39;t gain in height, he more than gained in width. The contagion turned him into a veritable fireplug of a man. After two months he had crammed 254 lbs of muscle onto his 5&#39;4&quot; frame. He was almost inhumanly thick. His biceps flexed to almost the same size as his head with nowhere to go but up. Much of his body had the problem of not having room to put all the muscle. His lats pushed his arms away from his side. His thighs rolled around each other as he walked. He was starting to have trouble bending his arms to do things like reach his back. And Diego loved every minute of it.<br />
<br />
But now with the season over, all of the football team members would be going their separate ways as they move on to other activities until the next season started. But that only gave the contagion more opportunity to spread. Who spreads the contagion next?</p>
