<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The school bell rang and Nick knew that there&#39;s no way he could go to class. Maybe Riley will help him somehow, he hoped so. But without clothes he couldn&#39;t even go out of the restroom. He didn&#39;t know what to do and stayed in a stall for a while thinking of a plan.<br />
<br />
After 20 minutes and without a single idea, Nick heard someone&#39;s coming. A distinctive whistling made him to realize that it was Oscar, the janitor. He was a good man, very kind and helpful, despite his weak and old body. The man was almost skin and bones only.<br />
<br />
Nick stayed very quiet hearing how Oscar&#39;s whistling becomes a singing. Then he heard a zipper opening and the sound of a stream of piss hitting a porcelain urinal. Nick wanted to think about Oscar holding his dick and peeing, he already has bad memories of his own manly dick doing it. It&#39;s been a while and he can&#39;t still get used to it.<br />
<br />
While he thought about his own manhood, he got an idea. He took his shredded clothes and looked for something in particular. He found it in his pants pocket. A red and white candy. It resembles a typical mint candy but it wasn&#39;t that at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okey, if just he sees me...&quot; Nick sighed before he opened his stall and came out. Oscar was still peeing but he turned his head and saw the almost naked boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey kid, what are you doing here? Classes have already started and why are you wearing only your underwear?&quot; Oscar asked him as he zipped up his pants. &quot;Bullying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes.&quot; Nick stuttered. He hadn&#39;t thought about that possibility yet. &quot;Can you help me? I have extra clothes in my locker but I don&#39;t want to go out looking like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, kiddo. Tell me where is your locker and your combination.&quot; Oscar replied. &quot;I promise you I won&#39;t take anything besides your clothes and you can change your numbers after this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Nick hided his candy inside his ripped clothes and gave Oscar the instructions to take his extra clothes. When the janitor left, Nick sighed in relief and took out the mint candy to glance at it. &quot;That was close... I almost use you on that poor man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Oscar was already in front of Nick&#39;s locker. He opened it and took the extra clothing. However  before he closed it he noticed that Nick had a lot of candies and weird stuff that kids don&#39;t use to have like razors, deodorants and something like a fake ID with a picture of a man that resembles Nick but way more older. He can&#39;t know that in fact it was a Nick&#39;s picture.<br />
<br />
&quot;Candies!&quot; Oscar said as he noticed a small jar of candies in a corner. &quot;I&#39;ll take one, he won&#39;t notice it. It&#39;s my little payment for this favor.&quot; He took a candy, a red and white one, just like the one that Nick had in his pocket. He closed the locker, smiled and put the candy in his mouth.<br />
<br />
He was happily walking and whistling through the hallways when he started to feel some tingling in his stomach. He thought it was just hungry and he ignored it. However, when he was a few steps fr the restroom, the pain intensified and he kneeled holding his stomach with his arms. He started to cough and  spit his candy on the floor. He was sweating a lot and then, he suddenly fainted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does he take so long?&quot; Nick was getting impatient after waiting for half an hour. He cautiously opened the restroom door and looked out. He didn&#39;t see Oscar but he saw something else. A pile of clothes in the middle of the hallway. He immediately recognized his clothes and... &quot;Oh no! Oscar!!&quot; He shouted when he recognized the janitor uniform and shoes. Nick ran as fast as he can to take the clothes, even Oscar&#39;s shoes and watch. However, he didn&#39;t see the candy that Oscar spit out before he fainted.<br />
<br />
When he had everything on his hands, Nick ran back to the restroom. He let Oscar&#39;s clothes on a sink and wore his extra clothes. He didn&#39;t have shoes nor socks, but he had Oscar&#39;s. So, after hesitating for a second he put those on. Of course, they&#39;re baggy and a little stinky but it was better than nothing. Then, he looked at the rest of the clothes and looked inside them desperately until he found it.<br />
<br />
A detached set of dick and balls were lying inside Oscar&#39;s clothes. It was Oscar, ot at least, what was left of him. Nick felt very uncomfortable of holding it and he threw it back in Oscar&#39;s clothes. &quot;Now, what am I going to do with you?&quot; Nick said very worried. Then, he got an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nick, you&#39;re very late.&quot; Nick&#39;s teacher said when Nick came in the classroom. He tried to apologize and make an excuse but nothing was convincing enough. &quot;I need to meet your parents after class or I&#39;ll report you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes, sir.&quot; Nick replied. He was still thinking of poor Oscar that he threw in the janitor room. He will be just a dick for at least five more hours, he thought.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in the hallways. Coach Sinclair was drinking a coffee and texting when he step on something and he tripped. His coffee fell all over him and his phone. &quot;Fuck!!&quot; He yelled when he noticed that his clothes were completely soaked. He looked around to see why he had tripped and he found the reason. A small mint candy on the floor. &quot;Stupid kids! Throwing their candies everywhere!&quot; He took it and then went to the restroom.<br />
<br />
He looked at him and his mess through the mirror and decided to take his shirt off. He wasn&#39;t ashamed at all, he liked to show off his strong body but he knew he can&#39;t do it in the school, so he was glad that there wasn&#39;t kids around for at least an hour. He smiled when he saw his meaty pecs and made then bounce for a brief moment before he remembered his pants were soaked too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn! Maybe Oscar has extra pants in the janitor room.&quot; He tought. He was tempted to take his pants down but he knew it was too much, although his wet clothing did little to hide his thick thighs and big bulge. He was almost leaving the restroom when he remembered the candy in his hands. &quot;And this it&#39;s because of a damn candy!!&quot; He threw it through the sink. However, coach Sinclair didn&#39;t notice that it bounced and it got stuck in the faucet.<br />
<br />
Ignoring it, he washed his hands dissolving some of the candy with the water that made contact with him. Then, he glanced at himself one last time before he left the restroom. He walked through the hallways ignoring the tingling that had already started to change him.</p>
