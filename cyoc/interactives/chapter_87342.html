<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nolan’s plan had worked out perfectly. He didn’t care at all about the naked chicks: he was secretly gay. But Frank and Patrick were so stubborn, all it took was a childish dare to trick them into getting naked to act as his pets. As the three of them were riding the bus to the next city Nolan shifted his position to carefully hid his raging hardon. He was going to see his two best friends completely naked for the first time! And not only that, he would be their owner! Maybe not legally, but while nobody checked their records everything would be fine. And both teenagers wouldn’t suspect a thing, they would believe he was just helping them to have a quick fuck with some stray chicks.<br />
<br />
But when the bus arrived to their destination, Frank said something that took Nolan completely aback.<br />
“So, who’s going to be the first?”<br />
“Uh...The first to what?” asked Nolan, confused.<br />
“The first one to get naked, of course.” Patrick answered. “If we get naked all at once, then we wouldn’t have nobody to pose as our owner. We would be considered strays and taken into the human pound!”<br />
“Well I guess that then I’ll be…” Nolan began to say.<br />
“I think that it would be best if I were...” Frank chimed in.<br />
“No offense, but I think that the best course of action would be that I’ll be…” Patrick spoke out.<br />
“...THE OWNER!” the three of them said at the same time.<br />
Oh, oh. Nolan hadn’t thought of that. No matter how proud they were, they were both ashamed to get naked and pose as a pet.<br />
Nolan tried to reason with them. “As you two were the ones doing the dare, I offer to act as a judge. You both can get naked at the same time while I’ll pose as the owner so I can decide who the “winner” of the dare is…”<br />
“Rock, Paper, Scissors then?” Patrick said, completely ignoring Nolan’s offer.<br />
“That’ll do. Whatever happens, we’ll take turns so all of us will get to be the animal and the human at least once over the course of the day” said Frank.<br />
“W-Wait...I’ll have to get naked too?! But I wasn’t the one doing the dare!” protested Nolan.<br />
“It would be unfair if someone got be the owner all day! Besides, don’t you want an opportunity to score with some nude hot chicks, too?”<br />
“Y-Yes...But…” Nolan wasn’t happy with this. That wasn’t part of the plan.<br />
“Then Rock…” Patrick announced.<br />
“...Paper…” Frank continued.<br />
“Uh...Ah! Scissors!” Nolan, completely disoriented, said. He had chosen Paper and to his horror both of his friends had chosen Scissors.<br />
“Seems like you’ll be the one stripping for us, Nolan! Let’s get you changed into your animal “disguise”.” Patrick said with a smirk.<br />
“That dark alley looks like a safe place to strip him without anybody noticing us. We can also hide his clothes inside that bin” proposed Frank.<br />
They went into the alley, Nolan still processing the situation. “You know guys, maybe this isn’t such a good idea...Waaagh! Get off me!”<br />
Frank got hold of Nolan while Patrick unbuckled Nolan’s belt. His pants and underwear were removed in a single swift motion.<br />
“Dude, there’s something wrong with your junk!” noted Patrick.<br />
Nolan blushed with embarrassment. “...I’m not circumcised, it’s called a foreskin…”<br />
“Of course I know what that is, doofus! I’m talking about your balls! They’re completely smooth! You shave them?” asked Patrick as he ran his fingers through Nolan’s smooth thigh.<br />
“Well actually…” Nolan didn’t know what was worse: admitting that you shaved your balls, or admitting that puberty hasn’t been too kind with you. “Yeah, chicks like them like that” he lied.<br />
It wasn’t long before Nolan was stark naked. He stood there, naked in a cold, dark alley cupping his genitals.<br />
“Nolan, you can’t go into the streets covering your crotch like that! People would suspect that you’re still human!”<br />
Frank slapped Nolan’s butt. “Yeah, dude! Let your smooth balls hang about with pride!”<br />
Nolan was humiliated. Was he really going to venture into the busy streets like this?<br />
<br />
When the two boys and their “pet” got out from their hideout, they found themselves face-to-face with a cop. Curse their bad luck! Had they been caught already? But to Nolan’s amazement, the cop wasn’t altered at all by the sight of his naked body. He didn’t even made eye contact with him, he just talked to his two best friends like he wasn’t there.<br />
“It’s illegal to give walkies to your Indecent Human without his collar. You look like inexperienced masters, so I’ll let it pass this time, but the next time I see your naked lad without a collar, cockring, or an identification tattoo I’ll charge you a fine. You don’t want your boy taken to the local pound by accident, don’t you?”<br />
The boys shook their heads.<br />
“I see you keep his balls shaved” commented the cop to Nolan’s embarrassment. “That makes them perfect for a nice cockring. They aren’t as visible as collars and boys are easier to manhandle when the leash is attached to their genitals. Those sick perverts value more the head between his legs than the one on their shoulders. And...Umm...That’s odd.” To Nolan’s surprise the cop grabbed his cock and pulled his foreskin back. “He’s uncut? Most owners prefer to have their pets circumcised, so they don’t have to worry about cleaning smegma when bathing them.” Said the cop while he nonchalantly manipulated the boy’s foreskin. “Have you had your boy properly processed? It’s free, you know. They can implant him an identification microchip, so his status as an animal is forever registered. They can also groom him, circumcise him, and have a selection of free collars, cockrings, and leashes...Not as “stylish” as those sold by Indecency Infractors’ accessory shops, but they do the trick. They can also offer obedience lessons for both the pet and their masters. What do you say?”<br />
<br />
Nolan turned to his best friends, pleading for them to refuse with his eyes.<br />
Patrick and Frank looked at each other. It could be fun to have the full “master experience” and if they refuse the cop might suspect Nolan’s not a real pet, but could they really do something like that to their best friend?<br />
“Well, after thinking it through we have decided that…”</p>
