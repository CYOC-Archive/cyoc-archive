<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie looked among the younger beach-goers. Which one of these boys should she grow into dates for her and Kellie. Of course, the problem with that is the boys were most often with their families and Katie felt a little awkward with messing with other families like that. There has to be some boys that weren&#39;t so attached to other groups.<br />
<br />
Then Katie noticed someone coming down towards the beach. From a distance, she could tell that it was a teenage boy with light brown hair leading a younger boy with chestnut hair. The teenage boy was wearing orange shorts while the little boy was wearing blue. As they got closer, Katie recognized them. The little boy was Mike, her friend from back when she was 7 years old, that seemed so long ago now. The boy leading him was his older cousin Bobby. Even though it was another life, Katie could clearly remember the times when Bobby babysat the both of them and she and Mike played together. Now it seemed that Bobby just babysat Mike alone. But that was going to change.<br />
<br />
Katie thought over her wish carefully before she said it out loud, &quot;I wish Mike and Bobby would become men the same age as me and Kellie. They&#39;ll both be very handsome and strong and they agree on a lot of stuff. They&#39;ll both be avid surfers and they&#39;ll consider surfer girls really hot. And I want the world to change to match their new ages and everyone will remember them like that.&quot; She worried a little if the wish was too unspecific but she reasoned she could alter things later if she had to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Mike, keep moving,&quot; said Bobby as he led his younger cousin onto the beach.<br />
<br />
&quot;The sand&#39;s too hot,&quot; whined Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll get used to it. We&#39;re almost there,&quot; said Bobby. He probably should have been gentler with Mike, but he was in a bit of a bad mood. He had paid good money for a magic ring and then he lost it. He was still kicking himself for being so careless. He was more than a little annoyed with his aunt asking him to take Mike to the beach for the afternoon, but at least their would be bikini babes here. He just hoped that having his little cousin along won&#39;t keep them away.<br />
<br />
Neither of them noticed when they started to change. Bobby was changing slower because he was 16 and there weren&#39;t many years between that and his destination. Mike, being only 7, had further to go and was growing quicker. His strides became longer as his legs stretched, his arms keeping up with them. As his torso grew, his pudgy physique started to change, becoming leaner. His face was also becoming leaner as his cheeks became less plump. &quot;The water looks great today,&quot; said a 10 year old Mike happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, nice day for a swim,&quot; said Bobby, already 17. He had gotten a few more inches in height and his chest firmed slightly. It was a great day to be on the beach, there ought to be plenty of girls to see. He trusted his kid cousin to stay out of the way so he shouldn&#39;t have trouble getting a girl&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s change in height started to pick up. His baby fat was sucked away, leaving a rather gangling appearance but that only happened for a moment. His thin torso started to thicken again, but this time with muscle. His chest started to flare to the sides as his shoulders started widening. His stomach was flat but now it started to gain a slight bit of texture. His limbs went from stringy to wirey as muscles started building up. His face was becoming more square as his chin started to stick out, his nose becoming less round and slightly longer. A 14 year old Mike hitched up his trunks which had a significantly less kiddy style to them. They tightened for a moment around him, particularly his larger package before adjusting to fit. &quot;You think there are gonna be girls here?&quot; asked Mike, his voice lower with the Adam&#39;s apple that just appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I know so,&quot; said Bobby, now 18. He had grown another few inches, but that was mostly it. His body was fit, but it was not muscular. Bobby was a little embarrassed by his lack of muscles. Hopefully, he&#39;d be able to get some attention from girls who wouldn&#39;t be drooling over some musclebound oaf.<br />
<br />
Then the two of them had a surge in growth. Mike sprang up in height until he was actually a little taller than Bobby. The muscles that been building up before exploded outwards. His arms and legs became carved pillars of muscle as a little bit of dark hair appeared on them. His shoulders widened further giving his torso a gem-like shape. His pecs and abs grew larger until they were very clearly defined under his skin. His face finished maturing into rugged handsomeness as stubble started to appear on his broad cheeks. Meanwhile, Bobby looked like he had been put through an express workout session in an instant. His muscles bulged until they were equal in size to Mike&#39;s. He was a little shorter and his face wasn&#39;t as rugged as Mike&#39;s, but he had a softer dreamier quality that many women found attractive.<br />
<br />
The two young men, six months past their 18th birthday, looked at the ocean with a different opinion. &quot;It&#39;s too calm for surfing,&quot; said Mike, &quot;Nothing to do here but swim today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Swim or hunt for babes,&quot; said Bobby with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, this should be a great day for that,&quot; said Mike grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, here comes one now,&quot; said Bobby. A surfer girl was approaching the two of them. She was gorgeous, a toned body, golden tan, C-cup breasts, perfect hourglass figure, black bikini, golden hair, this babe&#39;s got it all.<br />
<br />
The surfer girl walked up to them and asked, &quot;Hey, two hunks here with anyone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not today,&quot; said Mike, eyeing her up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my twin sister and I were looking for a pair of guys to have some fun with. You up for some fun in the sun?&quot; asked the surfer girl.<br />
<br />
This hot babe has a twin sister? How could Bobby possibly resist? &quot;Lead the way then,&quot; said Bobby. The girl smiled brightly and started walking back towards the shore, the cousins following her. Bobby&#39;s eyes went up and down the babe&#39;s body, her backside as sexy as her front. He also noticed a gold ring on one of her fingers.</p>
