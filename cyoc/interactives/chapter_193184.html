<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been almost a week since Patrick had played with the dildo. Work had been crazy-busy, but he was making a killing in tips, so that was a plus. It was almost the end of his shift, and for some reason today, he hadn’t been able to put the experience with the dildo out of his mind. On one hand, he was sort of proud of himself at taking the whole thing on the first try, and the feeling of being stretched and filled by the thing had been exquisite. He didn’t know how or why he’d fallen asleep with it inside of him, or if he even did, but how else could he rationalize to himself what he’d experienced when he’d succeeded in getting the dildo all of the way inside him? As he cleared an empty table of dishes and started wiping down the surface, he couldn’t help but feel the sensation of those big, strong hands gripping his belly, or the warm lips and coarse scruff that tickled and teased the crook of his neck. Patrick blushed when he realized he was starting to grow hard, and stood up to carry the buss-bin to the back. Things in the back-of-house were slow and quiet, for once. He checked his watch: closing time in five minutes. There hadn’t been a customer in an hour. Patrick hastened through his sidework, swept up the dining room, and quickly counted and balanced his tips. Patrick grinned when he saw the dollar amount and tipped out the kitchen before heading to the back to grab his stuff. He waved goodbye to the manager before leaving out the back door, a jaunt in his step. <br />
<br />
It was late, almost eleven at night. Patrick quickly made his way down the dark suburban streets and made the short walk back to his apartment, thinking about his dream the whole way. He paused along the way as he passed the little dildo shop, closed for the night, and thought about the shopkeeper and the strange way she’d spoken about her wares before moving on. Before long, he was shutting the door to his apartment, flicking on the light and unceremoniously dropping his things by the door. After a long, hard day, Patrick decided that a shower was in order. He went to his bedroom to undress and took a moment to retrieve his dildo from its dark hiding space in the drawer of his nightstand. In the shower, he lathered himself and washed his body thoroughly. He reached for the dildo and began to wash it as well. It made him grow a little hard, how smooth and real the skin felt, the weight of it in his hands. Patrick stopped washing it like it was a shoe or something and started giving the shaft long, slow strokes, twirling the head with his thumb. It made him ache for the real thing, but he wasn’t quite ready to put himself out there. Patrick was still feeling a little raw from his last break-up.<br />
<br />
Patrick rinsed himself and the dildo and then cut the water, stepping out of the shower to dry himself when a thought occurred to him. He left the dildo in the bathroom and went to get the bottle of regular lube from the nightstand before returning to the bathroom and shutting the door. It was still warm and steamy inside. He dried of the dildo and carefully stuck it onto the wall of the shower stall, adjusting it to what seemed about level with his ass. His heart racing with excitement, Patrick grabbed the lube and applied some to his hands before rubbing it all over the shaft of the dildo until it was slick and shiny. He then stepped into the shower, applying some more lube to his asshole as well. He backed up against the dildo, shuddering when the hard length probed between his cheeks. Patrick reached down and guided the tip of the dildo into his ass. He took a deep breath as he forced himself down on the head, his dick growing hard from the stimulation. He pushed himself down another inch; it was slow going, but Patrick wassn’t feeling resistance so much as a gradual loosening feeling. He gasped as pushed himself down another few inches, using his hand to feel how much there was left to go. The dildo felt strangely hot and supple under his fingers; he could swear he almost felt a pulse inside of him. Determined, Patrick took another deep breath and relaxed his muscles, forcing himself down the last few inches until his ass was pressed up against the bathroom wall, the dildo now completely inside of him.<br />
<br />
Without warning, Patrick felt himself get pushed forward against the opposite wall of the shower stall. Not hard; it was as if something had just appeared in the space between himself and the wall, pushing him out of the way. He gasped when he felt a firm, hairy front press itself against his back, his neck once again graced by those rough lips.<br />
<br />
“Thank god,” Bud said, thrusting his cock inside of Patrick experimentally, “I thought you’d never use me again.”<br />
<br />
“Holy shit, you’re real!” I said against the wet tile of the wall. I felt the man lean back bit, his big hands resting on my hips to keep me in place. I turned around to get a look at him in the light.<br />
<br />
There he was, the same man from that night a week before, grinning down at Patrick, same bushy mustache and stubbly beard, same shaved dome. In the light Patrick could see the man was well-muscled, but padded with a healthy layer of fat and coarse body hair that Patrick’s generation referred to as a ‘dad-bod’. <br />
<br />
“I am,” he said, leaning down to give me a kiss, “Now let’s finish this,” he growled, his voice hungry. He began to thrust into Patrick but the receiving man reached down and pressed his hand against the hairy flat of his naval to stop him. <br />
<br />
“Wait, what is even happening? What the hell did that lady sell me?” Patrick asked, trying to remove himself from Bud’s cock, but the man didn’t budge.<br />
<br />
“Please,” he said, his tone becoming pleading. “if we don’t come, I’ll turn back into a dildo if you pull me out. Just, lets finish this, baby,” he said, tenderly, “and I’ll be human long enough to tell you all about it.”<br />
<br />
Patrick stood there and thought about it; Bud moved a hand over to squeeze and massage one of his ass cheeks. He could feel Bud’s cock still hard and throbbing inside of him; it had never felt this good before, Patrick reasoned to himself. <br />
<br />
“Okay,” Patrick said, after a moment, “But, you can go a little harder this time, if you want.”<br />
<br />
Bud smiled down at him, revealing a row of striahgt, white teeth. “Baby, wait, what’s your name, son?” he asked, reaching his other hand around to Patrick’s belly. <br />
<br />
“Patrick,” he breathed.<br />
<br />
“Patrick, I’ll turn you out good, I promise.” He said with a sexy growl. He gave Patrick’s ass a firm slap before he started pounding into him, taking long, deep rapid strokes in Patrick’s eager hole. Patrick put his arms against the wall and pressed back against Bud, trying to invite as much of the man into him as he could. He could feel Bud’s heavy balls slapping against his so hard it was making his stomach a little queasy. One of Bud’s big hands reached up to twist and tease Patrick’s nipple; the man leaned down to kiss and bite around Patrick’s neck, his ears, just under his chin. Patrick had never been fucked like this before; even in the heat of passion, Anthony hadn’t been much of a kisser, nor had he paid much attention to Patrick as he’d pounded away with abandon. But Patrick was shocked when he felt Bud’s hand slink down to his hard, leaking dick, taking it in a firm grip stroking him in time with his thrusts. The man was fucking him so hard and so rapidly Patrick was hoping he wouldn’t slip. He braced himself against the stall, luxuriating in the way Bud’s cock slid in and out of him with no resistance, no pain, just pure pleasure. Like it had surrendered to the mans rough, passionate advance. <br />
<br />
“I’m close, baby,” Bud breathed against him, “You ready?”<br />
<br />
Patrick didn’t know what came over him, but hiss only response was to say, “Breed me, baby,”<br />
<br />
The man just shook his head in sarcastic exasperation and started to fuck him harder and deeper. Patrick felt his prostate screaming in pleasure as a pressure built up in his balls; he could tell Bud was feeling the same as the man started groaning, his breathing turning ragged. With a loud yell and one final thrust, he came hard inside of Patrick. The smaller man could feel Bud’s cock pulse inside of him as it spent its load; Bud started thrusting again, gentler this time, but it was enough to bring Patrick over the edge as well. He came and his cock fired his load against the bathroom wall; he realized that Bud had stopped stroking his cock when he reached for his orgasm. Patrick had come, hands free, for the first time in his life. He turned around to meet bud but the man was already coming down upon him, pressing a big hand against the back of Patrick’s head as he delivered a deep, passionate kiss on the younger man. <br />
<br />
“Your ass if perfect, boy,” He said, his other hand giving Patrick’s a squeeze for emphasis.<br />
<br />
“You were perfect,” Patrick admitted. “Where did you learn to fuck like that?”<br />
<br />
“Grew up on a farm,” He said, leaning back to rub his hands over his face. “Damn, I missed having hands. And a stomach, you got anything to eat in this place?” Patrick could feel the man’s softening dick slowly slipping from his relaxed hole.<br />
<br />
“You gotta tell me what this is all about, first,” Patrick said. He sighed when the man forced his cock all the way back inside him. <br />
<br />
Bud nodded. “Alright, but I gotta sit down. The bedroom?” Patrick gestured to the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
“You gotta pull out of me though if we wanna go anywhere,” Patrick said. But bud looked around nervously. “What’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
“I’m scared if I pull out, I’ll turn back. Last time I was only a man for about twenty minutes.”<br />
<br />
Patrick thought about it. “Maybe…pull it out and let me turn around and then put it back in? Then I guess you can carry me.”<br />
<br />
“I like the way you think, boy,” Bud said. He carefully tugged himself until with a little pop, Patrick felt the cock slip out of him. He turned around and got a proper look at his man from the front: meaty chest and big belly, his heavy, hard cock jutting out from a forest of dark pubes. Patrick reached a hand down to grip it; it was the same shape and architecture and everything. But now the veins were dark an bulging, the foreskin smooth and elastic. He could feel the man’s heartbeat in that cock. Bud closed his eyes and let out a deep hum as Patrick caressed and massaged Bud’s balls. When the cock was fully hard again, Patrick tried to adjust himself so that he could fit it in him missionary. <br />
<br />
“Let me, boy,” Bud said, fitting his arms underneath Patrick’s thighs and hoisting him up. Patrick instinctively tied his legs around the man’s wide waist, reached down to guide the head of Bud’s cock into his hole. He’d only gotten the head in when Bud lifted Patrick slightly before letting him fall, thrusting his pelvis forward at the same time. Patrick yelped as the length of cock slid entirely within him. Bud held him firmly in place with his strong arms, looking down to where his dick disappeared beneath Patrick’s balls and inside of the younger man. “God, you’re so sexy. Don’t worry, boy, I got you.” <br />
<br />
Patrick could lean himself against Bud’s strong chest as the man carried him from the bathroom and over to the bed, careful not to let an inch of his cock escape Patrick’s hole. He sat down on the bed, Patrick gasping as the motion drove the cock deeper into him.<br />
<br />
Bud leaned over to give Patrick another strong kiss before saying, “Ride me, baby. Keep me hard while I tell you about my little…condition.” Patrick had never had this opportunity. He felt bold, even a little dominant as he started to rock himself back and forth on Bud’s cock, experimenting with different angles and motions.<br />
<br />
“Just like that, boy,” Bud purred. “So, yes, I’m a dildo. Or at least, I am when I’m not being used. The lube that fucking bitch,” he spat out, making Patrick jump. “gave you is supposed to transform us into living cocks, and cocks only. But if you use a regular lube…” he trailed off as Patrick adopted a kind of arching, forward motion. <br />
<br />
“You turn back into a full man,” Patrick finished, before pausing. “But how come you can’t stay human after you pull out?”<br />
<br />
Bud looked down at Patrick with a sad look in his eye. “Its part of the curse.”<br />
<br />
“You were cursed?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, by that bitch of a saleslady.”<br />
<br />
“How?”<br />
<br />
Bud let out a deep sigh. “I used to do porn, cause, you know, look at me.” he gestured to his hirsute and manly frame, “I made good money at first, but I got into a lot of debt in the end. Cars, drugs, gambling, I lost almost all of it. My agent got a line on this supposed modeling job. They said they were making life-like models of the cocks of famous people. A few of my friends in the business had done it and they made a killing. So, I thought, why not?” he shook his head. “Biggest mistake of my life.”<br />
<br />
“What happened?” Patrick resumed taking light, slow strokes.<br />
<br />
“She turned out to be a witch. There were two other guys there when it happened; I knew one of them. Did a film together.” He leaned back on his arms. “She used magic to turn us into cursed men; were-dildos, almost. We’re inanimate during the day, but at night, if we are used and come to completion inside of someone, we regain our human form for a time. Only she sells us with that lube that keeps us trapped as living cocks.”<br />
<br />
“That’s spooky, and hot, and…horrible,” Patrick said, pausing and resting a hand on the man’s chest. Bud placed his own hand over Patrick’s. “I’m sorry that happened to you.”<br />
<br />
Bud looked up at him, a little more cheerful. “Well, thankfully you ignored the instructions and used your own lube, so at least I get some of my humanity back.”<br />
<br />
“Actually, it fell off the bed and broke,” Patrick confessed.<br />
<br />
“Either way. I’m grateful.”<br />
<br />
“Why do you turn back after you pull out though?”<br />
<br />
“I think its because I’ve been a dildo for so long, the magic is still strong,” he speculated. <br />
<br />
“How long were you a dildo?” Patrick asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, this all happened in the spring of ’88. So maybe a few years?” he said, while Patrick just gaped at him. “What?”<br />
<br />
“Um, its been more than a few years dude.” Patrick said, uncertain of how to proceed. <br />
<br />
“What…what year is it?” asked Bud, a look of panic overcoming him. “Are we still in L.A.?”<br />
<br />
Patrick sighed, feeling the man softening inside him. “Alright, so here’s the thing…”</p>
