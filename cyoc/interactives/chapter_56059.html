<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty decided he'd catch up with Rex first. The guy seemed to know Ty, so he had to figure what his 21 year old counterpart was doing at college. Ty spent a few minutes roaming the halls, looking out windows along the way. It didn't take long to find Rex, he was just walking along the grass towards a building. Well, to Ty, it looked like a boulder slowly rolling along. Ty couldn't help but giggle to himself as he bolted out the door to catch up with the big ol' boulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey-Hey Rex, wait up!&quot; Ty called out to Rex, still making his way over. The boulder stopped rolling and slowly turned around and showed an unidentifiable expression. He couldn't tell if he was happy or angry.<br />
<br />
Rex was roughly 6'7&quot; feet tall, with muscles bulging all over his body. If it was possible for someone's muscles to have muscles, then this guy was probably the prime example of such a strange feature. His skin was lightly tanned, and his body was lightly covered in black hair - which still equaled to a lot of hair thanks to his size. His eyes were hazel, or possible green. It was impossible for Ty to tell thanks to the height difference.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want, runt?&quot; Rex asked, smirking as he towered over Ty. It looked like he enjoyed the vast height difference. &quot;Hm, you know, usually the noobies are afraid of me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, well yeah... I just kinda need help. So I was wondering if you could show me around?&quot; Ty meekly replied, feeling slightly embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Ty blurted in amazement. From the sounds of it, Rex didn't want anything to do with the 'noobie'.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll help you.&quot; Rex clarified before gesturing towards the building behind him. &quot;But first, I'm going to the cafe to get some coffee. It's too damn early for me. My treat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh okay.&quot; Ty said with a smile. Ty couldn't help but notice as Rex's expression went from flat to ecstatic within seconds.<br />
<br />
The two walked into the cafe, which happened to be packed. Though much like Moses, Rex was easily able to split the sea of students. Well, to be more accurate, everyone gawked at Rex and shied away so they didn't get trampled by the Incredible Bulk. Among the frightened peers were girls smiling and checking him out before whispering something to their girlfriends. Ty caught one of their little discussions, in which one said something like &quot;He's sooooo big and strong and tough and sexy. Too bad he's tooooo big. He'll probably accidently crush me if we get it on.&quot; Ty looked over at Rex, and noticed his once-cheery expression was now slowly turning into a grimace. The foul expression seemed to become more profound with each step until it almost looked like he was about to tear up, rather than rage. Upon reaching the counter, Rex slapped a five dollar bill on the counter, making a ridiculously loud thud that shook the cafe. <br />
<br />
&quot;Two large coffees, ten sugars, three creams.&quot; Rex said, his voice monotone. The spooked cafe worker quickly rung up the order and handed Rex his change along with his coffee. It was as if the cafe worked was The Flash in disguise.<br />
<br />
Rex handed the second cup of coffee to Ty and made his way towards the exit. Ty followed him yet again, until the two were back at what was probably Rex's dorm room. Unlike the other dorm room, Rex had a different bed, comprised of two beds put together with cinderblocks holding them um. Rex sat on the bed, gesturing for Ty to close the door and do the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rex, what's wrong?&quot; Ty asked, sitting next to Rex. Ty's actions alone seemed to cheer Rex up a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You saw that. You heard what they were saying. I freak people out by just being there! I've been here for three years and people still act like I'm a monster or something. Well, except you.&quot; Rex was now smiling again. &quot;Noobies are usually scared of me, but you were nice enough to talk to me. Or stupid enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice enough.&quot; Ty replied, &quot;Oh and thanks for the coffee. Um, can I ask you some questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess.&quot; Rex said, taking a long sip from his cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;How old are you and how long have you been here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm 22, and I've been here since I was 19.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Really?&quot; Ty said, trying to hide his disbelief. &quot;You're 22? Then why are you so... You know... Then again, I don't think anyone is as massive as you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I'm 22, I just have that whole myostatin blocking gene thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that means...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My muscles grow like crazy if I workout, I could become super huge until my bones could no longer support my weight, if I wanted to. When I was little my dad made me workout like crazy to make money off me somehow, and I was addicted to it until I found that the biggest sizes in clothes stores no longer fit me, even the Big and Tall stores barely had anything for my size. The professors are total dicks to me too, they act like I'm retarded. I'm smart you know! And in the end... I'm too big to wear normal clothes without them ripping or play sports without hurting someone. I can't even get a chick because I'm too damn big!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Sounds like your gift is a curse then. But come on, not get a chick? Look at you, you're amazing!&quot; Ty excitedly blurted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Amazingly huge,&quot; Rex said. &quot;They're afraid I'll crush them. They ask me to flex, feel me up, flirt with me to no end - and all I'm left with is a major case of blue balls. It fuckin' sucks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what if I said I could help you?&quot; Ty mentioned, giving Rex a light pat on the arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fwahahaha-oh, yeah, okay. Not even magic can fix this!&quot; Rex said, wiping a tear from his eye. Ty didn't know if it was from laughing too hard or from almost crying. &quot;Don't worry about it, Ty. I'm fine, really, I am. I was just get easily worked up. Thanks for not pissing your pants when you saw me, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problemo, Rex. You know, it's funny you brought up magic! Well, if you're not going to ask for help...&quot;</p>
