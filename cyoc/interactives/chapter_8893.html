<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter saw the look on Allen’s face, and decided that he must have learned his lesson by now and that he had suffered enough. While no one was looking, Peter made himself disappear into thin air, and he instantly reappeared inside the locker room, ready to face Allen, who had just waddled in. Peter was only wearing his Speedo.<br />
<br />
Allen walked in the locker room and froze in shock when Peter suddenly appeared out of nowhere. “What… How… I thought I just saw you standing by the edge of the pool… How did you beat me here?” he asked Peter, with an astonished look on his face. <br />
<br />
“Allen, I’m responsible for you weighing 400 pounds right now. I can’t stand to see anyone being bullied, and I wanted to teach you a lesson.” Peter said calmly. But Allen became very angry! “Why? What did I do to you? Look at me! I should slam my fist in your face for this!” he shouted at Peter. <br />
<br />
Allen made a fist and was about to punch Peter in the face, when Peter shouted “Freeze!” and instantly Allen’s body had completely frozen! Peter grinned and walked up to him. “Now you will listen to me. First off, you will calm down, so I can change you back to the way you were. This swim team needs you because you are the best swimmer that we got, and you will continue to be our best swimmer. Second, you will lower your voice and humble out a bit. You’ll always come to practice on time and you will spur on and encourage the other swimmers, without putting down the other swimmers even if they don’t perform as well as you. You got that? Now, you will unfreeze and you will no longer be angry at me!”<br />
<br />
Allen was able to move again, as he looked at Peter in disbelief. “There, now how about we make you look like a swimmer again, huh?” Peter said, with a smile on his face. “You weighed how much? About 160 pounds, right?” Peter asked him. Allen just nodded, as he looked at Peter with awe and amazement. “Alright, Allen, time to shed those pounds!”<br />
<br />
Allen’s belly began to deflate like a balloon that was letting the air out. His arms, hips, legs and face lost the excess fat and puffiness, as the skin on his body began to tighten around the muscles which now became visible when the fat melted away. His legs became harder and thinner and more defined, his abdominal muscles reappeared again where at first there was only fat and flab, and the fat on his chest had melted away and left the hard, round pectorals in its place. Not only that, but Peter made Allen’s cock grow back to the original nine inches as well! In a matter of seconds, Allen was restored to his old self again, to Peter’s delight, and to Allen’s surprise!<br />
<br />
Allen looked down at his body and realized that he looked like a swimmer again. But then he looked back at Peter, and he became scared of him. “Look, man… I don’t know who you are or what planet you’re from, but I have heard lots of weird things about you! All the tough guys in school are scared to death of you! I heard about you changing people into animals and so on… You scare me, Peter! Just leave me alone and don’t come near me, okay?” he said, as he began to tremble with fear!<br />
<br />
“Don’t be afraid of me, Allen! I just want to help you realize that you need to change your behavior during practice, that’s all. I really do want to be your friend…” Peter extended his right hand. Allen hesitated for a moment, and the he cautiously shook Peter’s hand, while his jaw was still wide open!<br />
<br />
“Tell you what; I’ll make it up to you! How about I add some muscle to your body? Like to the shoulders and the legs…” Peter said, while he smiled at him. Allen just looked at him and nodded his head, not feeling sure of what Peter was going to do to him. But Allen began to realize that Peter was not to be messed around with, and he suddenly had an enormous respect for him!<br />
<br />
Right at that moment, Allen felt his pectorals, his biceps, triceps, his calves and his quads increase slightly, as Peter added a few more pounds of muscle to Allen’s frame. Peter clasped his hands together and finally said “There! You’re all done! Do you like the way you look?” Allen just shrugged his shoulders, so Peter levitated him two inches in the air, using his psychic powers. He turned Allen around and positioned him in front of the mirror. Allen smiled when he saw his reflection. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Allen quietly asked him “Uhh… Peter… Could I ask you a favor?” Peter walked up to him and stood next to him, while he was still floating in the air. “Could you please put me back down on the floor? I can’t walk like this…” he asked Peter cautiously. “Oh sure, I’m sorry! I forgot that I made you levitate in mid air!” Peter said, as he commanded Allen to gently set back down on the floor. <br />
<br />
“My goodness… How do you do that?” Allen asked Peter, as he slowly turned towards him, with his jaw wide open. “Oh, I don’t know… It’s a Halloween trick!” Peter chuckled, like it was no big deal to him at all. “Could I make your muscles grow like that as well?” Allen asked Peter. “Not really, not unless I give you the power to do that…” Peter replied. “You want to try it on me?” Allen just nodded, and Peter figured he would give Allen just enough power so that Allen could only shrink or grow the muscles on Peter’s body, just to gain Allen’s trust. “Alright, just look at me and concentrate on a specific muscle and decide in your mind whether it should shrink or grow, and by how much. I’m only allowing you to shrink and grow my muscles, and nobody else!”<br />
<br />
Allen concentrated, and suddenly Peter felt his triceps grow bigger and harder. Then he felt his abdominals and his pectorals grow, much to Allen’s delight. “Wow, that is awesome! I can make your muscles as big as I want!” he shouted excitedly! “Yes, but you can only change my muscles, nobody else! Let’s head back to the pool, okay?” Peter replied, after he noticed that Allen was trying hard to make Peter look more like he had the body of a professional swimmer!<br />
<br />
Allen and Peter were now best friends on the swim team! They walked back out to the pool, and Peter stood with his toes by the edge of the pool, ready to dive in, when he suddenly felt his calves grow thicker and bigger. He looked up and smiled, as Allen gave him a big smile back! And he increased Peter’s quads as well, just before Peter dove in!</p>
