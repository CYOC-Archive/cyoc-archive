<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the Reynard family&#39;s mobile home, Renata&#39;s body twitched as Ruby&#39;s vulpine tongue brought her to orgasm. Ruby fought to keep focus, as Jezebel was kneeling over her muzzle for a good pussy-licking. As electric pleasure pulsed through her loins, Renata lashed her long tongue at the succubus&#39;s dripping cunt, the delectable flavor of the pussy juices arousing the newly minted werevixen further. Soon, Jezebel joined Renata in the throes of bliss, screaming joyously as the nerves in her clit lit up with euphoria. Last to climax was Ruby, who shivered as the vibrating dildo she&#39;d stuffed into her pussy did its work.<br />
<br />
After lying in a contented heap for a minute or two, the three lovers stood back up. Ruby pulled the dildo out of her snatch. &quot;Well, that rocked! I knew you&#39;d make a natural werevixen, Renata.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure do!&quot; laughed Jezebel. &quot;You work miracles with that new tongue of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Renata smiled. &quot;Thanks. I think I&#39;ll take my inhibitor potion now; the instructions say to take it directly after sex for the smoothest, gentlest results.&quot; She poured herself a tablespoon of potion and gulped it down.<br />
<br />
Ruby made a face. &quot;Ew, I still don&#39;t know how you could possibly want to drink that crap, Renata! It just keeps you from being true to yourself. Don&#39;t you wanna be totally free and uninhibited like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m plenty uninhibited without a flood of new werefox instincts,&quot; said Renata. &quot;I don&#39;t need the extra drama. As for being free, I can&#39;t see how being enslaved to my instincts and impulses without much power to say &#39;no&#39; to them counts as free. Drug addicts aren&#39;t free, they&#39;re slaves to their addiction.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ruby crossed her arms, slightly offended. &quot;That&#39;s not the same thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that,&quot; Renata said in an apologetic tone. &quot;I just meant it might be easier to function in society with this potion. Maybe you and your skulk should try it. Your werewolf, vampire, and human neighbors might not mind you as much if you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t hurt,&quot; Jezebel suggested. &quot;Succubi and incubi think a lot like werefoxes, but we can control ourselves when we need to. It&#39;s hard to feed off of desire when the neighbors are so pissed off that their greatest desire is your head on a spike.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ruby shook her head. &quot;No. Maybe restraint works for you two, but I wasn&#39;t born with it. It&#39;d feel unnatural. Let&#39;s get off this topic, okay? What else can we do together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got a pretty sweet TV,&quot; said Jezebel. &quot;I say we watch a movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; said Renata. &quot;After a night of high-energy fucking, I need to unwind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then!&quot; Ruby smiled, picking up the remote and flipping to a random channel.<br />
<br />
They landed on something titled Cinema Sinister with Alvilda, Queen of the Damned. It turned to be one of those horror host programs where a host in a campy costume introduces a goofy, B-grade monster movie and does the occasional sketch themed around the flick of the week.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it just me,&quot; asked Renata as the pale, black-clad host introduced the film, &quot;or does this Alvilda lady look like a vampire?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jezebel laughed. &quot;Alvilda looks like a vampire because she IS a vampire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know that?&quot; asked Renata.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alvilda&#39;s super popular with the magical community,&quot; said Jezebel. &quot;We love a good laugh at the stupidly inaccurate movies the humans make about us, and nobody gives us those laughs quite like Alvilda. It&#39;s only natural we&#39;d know all about her life. Hell, she&#39;s given interviews with the Salem Banshee, the most prestigious newspaper for American magicals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ruby. &quot;She was turned in the early 70&#39;s by a refugee from that awful von Wisborg clan that got broken up by hunters from the Vordenburg family...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you say Vordenburg?!&quot; gasped Renata. &quot;That&#39;s my mother&#39;s maiden name! Does this mean my Uncle Jonathan... oh my God, he wasn&#39;t REALLY an FBI agent, was he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t sound like it,&quot; said Ruby. &quot;No self-respecting Vordenburg would be content chasing down garden variety terrorist cells and drug rings. Well, maybe if the terrorists were vampires and the drug smugglers were dealing in magic potions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My cousin Tori might be a hunter, too,&quot; said Renata. &quot;I was always told she was a private detective, but now I&#39;m thinking that&#39;s only half the truth. A lie by omission, you know. Shit, is she gonna come and shoot me full of silver?! I&#39;m a werevixen now, and she&#39;s a monster hunter!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about it,&quot; said Jezebel. &quot;Hunters stay outta your way generally if you &#39;mind your manners,&#39; as they tend to call it. That translates into not bothering humans. You know the kind of thing. No killing, no forced transformations, no brainwashing them into being your lover, that kind of thing. If you follow their rules, the worst you get is periodic questioning whenever some other magical does something shitty in your area. You know, just to make SURE it wasn&#39;t you or to see if you know who did do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; said Renata. &quot;Thanksgiving dinner just got a lot less lethal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Ruby went on, &quot;After the von Wisborg vampire clan was shattered by the Vordenburgs, a surviving member fled to America, where he turned Alvilda. He was hoping to rebuild his old clan, but he didn&#39;t count on Alvilda hating his guts and running away. She never bothered to find a new clan; some vamps are just more comfortable solo. In the early 80&#39;s, she auditioned to be the host of this new hosted horror program. Needless to say, those human producers were fucking blown away by a real vampire. She&#39;s been making stupid movies even funnier ever since.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And even hotter!&quot; Jezebel added. &quot;Just look at her tits. They&#39;re bigger than mine!&quot;<br />
<br />
The movie was a campy 1966 space invader flick called Space Vixens from Venus!, which starred a broad-shouldered, square jawed guy named Dirk McClane as Captain Rock Harding, a dewy-eyed blonde named Nancy Jones as his girlfriend Betty Goodkind, and buxom, voluptuous woman called Sharon Bell as the evil and extraterrestrial Queen Vulpessa.<br />
<br />
It began wit a spaceship that looked suspiciously like a pawprint landing in the woods near a human city. A walkway descended and the titular space vixens descended from their ship in single file, all of them wearing the bare minimum needed to stave off an X-rating. Looking closely, Renata caught one of the space vixens stepping on the tail of the girl in front of her, pulling it completely off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, did you see that?!&quot; Renata said. &quot;Her tail came right out and she just keeps walking like nothing happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know!&quot; Ruby laughed. &quot;If someone tore my tail off my body, I&#39;d be screaming my ass off... literally!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that reattaching it would make her look any more like a fox,&quot; said Jezebel. &quot;These costumes are shit. Look, you can see where the actresses&#39; prosthetic snouts end and their real faces begin!&quot;<br />
<br />
The space vixens used holographic technology to disguise themselves as humans. They proceeded to spend the next twenty minutes of the movie seducing human women and luring them back to the spaceship, where they used some highly unlikely science to transform the women into new space vixens. Once their numbers were large enough, they mounted an invasion on Earth. The human defense was led by the manly, stalwart Captain Rock Harding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;s it a captain commanding all of America&#39;s anti-alien forces?&quot; asked Jezebel. &quot;Why isn&#39;t it a general?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because captain sounds cooler, I think,&quot; said Renata. &quot;You know, like Captain America, Captain Kirk, Captain Jack Sparrow, Captain Jack Harkness, Captain Crunch... Wait, forget about the last one.&quot;<br />
<br />
The United States military tried to fight back, but the space vixens had disintegrator guns and a powerful healing factor that made them nearly unkillable. The battle became personal when Queen Vulpessa had Rock&#39;s girlfriend Betty captured and forcibly converted into a space vixen. He managed to fight his way into her throne room on the spaceship and made a lunge for her with a knife. Queen Vulpessa drew her own dagger and the two began to fight, Vulpessa making double entendres all the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s a pretty young thing, that lady friend of yours,&quot; said Queen Vulpessa. &quot;I can see why you&#39;re so desperate to get some tail from her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sultry space temptress!!&quot; Rock snarled back.<br />
<br />
The three viewers burst into peals of laughter. &quot;Daaaaamn, the dialogue&#39;s getting worse!&quot; Renata snickered. &quot;I mean, &#39;Sultry space temptress?&#39; Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He took the time to come up with flowery crap like that in the middle of a fight?!&quot; laughed Ruby. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure most guys couldn&#39;t manage something more creative than &#39;Fuck you, bitch!&#39; if they were distracted like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, Rock,&quot; Vulpessa simpered, &quot;Your beloved Betty enjoys my company... if you know what I mean. Why can&#39;t you? We&#39;d be very happy if you decided to... join us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock made a face that Dirk McClane clearly thought was one of righteous wrath but came out much closer to sever constipation. &quot;NEVER, you beguiling, bush-tailed succubus!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jezebel chortled. &quot;He says succubus like it&#39;s a bad thing!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the hero and villainess dueled, Vulpessa signaled to her soldiers, who overpowered Rock and threw him into the spaceship&#39;s brig. Betty secretly visited him and whispered to him that the space vixens&#39; weakness was nicotine. Rock felt around in his pocked and found a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. When his jailer came to check on him, Dirk blew cigarette smoke in her face, killing her. Her took her keys and escaped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hooray for second-hand smoke!&quot; Ruby cheered sarcastically.<br />
<br />
Rock made it back to the defense force and informed him of the space vixens&#39; nicotine weakness. The military began building massive machines designed to blow nicotine fumes at the legions of invading vixens. It wasn&#39;t long before the space vixen army was decimated and Queen Vulpessa was killed.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOOOOO!!!&quot; Renata screamed. &quot;Not Queen Vulpessa! You were the sexiest character in this!&quot;<br />
<br />
The film ended with Rock using the spaceship&#39;s transformative technology to restore Betty to her human form. The two shared a passionate (but not TOO passionate) kiss just before the screen faded to black. Alvilda returned to the screen for a final snarky monologue.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a movie!&quot; said Renata. &quot;It was totally freaking DUMB... and I enjoyed every cringy minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad movies have a special magic, don&#39;t they?&quot; said Jezebel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure do,&quot; Renata agreed. &quot;What amazes my is how much lesbian content they got away with in 1966. Didn&#39;t the homophobic censors try to stop it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ruby shrugged. &quot;You can get away with a lot when you&#39;re a bad guy, I guess. But bad guy or not, I still liked the space villains more than the heroes. They knew how to have a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Sharon Bell was a waaaaay hotter actress than Nancy Jones,&quot; Jazebel added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Renata nodded. &quot;The space vixens totally made the movie... and they&#39;ve given me some awesome ideas for fetish roleplay.&quot; She winked playfully at her two friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh,&quot; Ruby giggled. &quot;I certainly look forward to trying THAT out soon! Hope I get to be Queen Vulpessa. No fucking way am I gonna be Betty Goodkind, I swear to Lady Moon.&quot;</p>
