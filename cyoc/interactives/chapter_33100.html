<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;In the mean time, why don't we introduce you to your foster child.&quot; Naomi said, &quot;It'll add a <br />
lot on your part if you show you're willing to hold up your end of the bargain. Don't worry, <br />
I'll be sure to put in a good word for you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Personally, Naomi thought that the decision about Spike was way too merciful, but 'Miss J' <br />
had declared her decision, and it wasn't in Naomi's nature to question it. <br />
<br />
Still feeling a subconscious intimidation of the predator species, Jenny nodded. The idea of <br />
a fawn, not that it was inside her brain, felt more tempting by the minute, a sense of, <br />
completion came with it. <br />
<br />
Su and Lateisha knew that look. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just don't do anything impulsive Jenny, and don't sign anything without talking to a <br />
lawyer.&quot; Su  Yin wisely advised. Jenny nodded. Ironically, Jenny's position with the bucks, <br />
enabled her to be the best one to gauge their behavior. Having slept with nearly every <br />
buck in the park (excluding Spike, Sam, and Drake), she was able to tell that many of her <br />
mates had suddenly developed the habit after Sam's orders, to actually -talk- before and <br />
after the union, something Jenny realized she found a strange breath of fresh air.  Maybe a <br />
long term relationship wouldn't be so bad, and with Spike in tow, she knew she'd likely <br />
scare away the short term thrill seekers. And maybe she'd find someone for Hannah too in <br />
the process.<br />
<br />
Lateisha shook her head, sometimes she felt like she was the only normal one in this <br />
group. Yes, a group of evolved deer with two of their number having been originally <br />
males. Okay, so many normal wasn't the best word. But she wasn't a collage professor in <br />
the outside world like Su Yin, or had personal issues with the outside version of herself. <br />
Almost made her feel... left over. At least she was here to offer girl advice when Hannah <br />
was distracted. She just hoped Jenny didn't regret this decision. She didn't know how much <br />
of Jenny the doe was an act, but she certainly acted a little naive sometimes. <br />
<br />
Hannah... made it a point not to ask about Sam. She better than to ask. Sam no longer <br />
existed except as a memory in her head now. She had dived into her self appointed task of <br />
helping the intentional and accidental TGed anthro park guests. Making sure they didn't <br />
go crazy, or make some decisions they shouldn't. She had taken Laura's advice, and done <br />
her best to let Sam go. <br />
<br />
Leading Jenny though the forest, not using the Husky Only rout, Jenny, feeling nervous all <br />
the same but strangely obedient, followed the predator. <br />
<br />
Arriving that camouflaged building, an opening appeared where there seemed to be none <br />
before, and the two entered the 'air lock' the handleless door on the other side opened on <br />
it's own, and Jenny was split between her dislike of the unnatural place, or being nearer <br />
Naomi's teeth. <br />
<br />
Naomi made a point on not having Jenny needing to encounter any humans along the way. <br />
She had enough to deal with. The hallway and room that she lead Jenny though was as <br />
stark and featureless as the airlock. It was like the the Managers WANTED these guests to <br />
prefer being naked along the bushes. <br />
<br />
The doors opening automatically for them, Jenny was soon in a bright, featureless smooth <br />
room, with a fawn sitting by his lonesome inside. <br />
<br />
Jenny started at the urge to hold the fawn close to her. After all, an abandoned fawn needs <br />
a mother. She knew this was no fawn, this was Spike, the monster who had nearly reeked <br />
havoc in the park. But at the same time... she found she was starting to have trouble <br />
connecting the two. <br />
<br />
Naomi just stood back her arms crossed observing the scene unfold. Seeing the hypnotic <br />
look in Jenny's eyes that appeared when an anthro's instincts were having a nice little <br />
sweet talk with the rational part of their brains. <br />
<br />
The exact same look was in Spike's eyes. <br />
<br />
Spike had been confused and disoriented since he had been de-aged and taken off his <br />
painkillers. They told him it was a necessary after effect of repairing his body, not <br />
technically a lie. His brain felt like it was in a fog, or soup. Thus he accepted this <br />
explanation without question, after all, the grown up had told him it was so, and grown <br />
ups knew better. This combined with the trauma he had suffered in the first place, had left <br />
his mind like clay, impressionable, and easily moldable. <br />
<br />
Spike took one look at Jenny, and instead of seeing an object to stem his lust like he <br />
would have before, his brain now saw a missing piece of the puzzle. Before he even knew <br />
what he was doing, he was holding her legs. Jenny meanwhile, before she even knew what <br />
she was doing, had her arms around him. <br />
<br />
Spike didn't fully understand it, but he knew he felt a hundred times safer just with the <br />
doe holding him. While Jenny felt... like she was more? <br />
<br />
Spike followed Jenny without being told to. <br />
<br />
Naomi knew the Managers would be very pleased with this result. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Mike and Jasmine had just enough common sense not to jump on board the <br />
pregnancy train, and with Laura's promise to Hannah, combined with family ties, becoming <br />
feral didn't enter into either of the foxes' brains. Laura wondered if her daughter and her <br />
boyfriend would be the first anthros to step outside the park. <br />
<br />
She knew better than to try and ask them to become human again, because while the two <br />
of them would have to live in human society by human law, they were now anything but <br />
human. Still mammals, yes, still sentient, yes, still responsible for their own actions, yes, <br />
still legal citizens, yes, but human? No. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
While Jackie and Keith were in stunned shock, Doctor  # 2 was able to tell them that for <br />
now their kittens were all healthy, and as a matter of tact did NOT tell them what the <br />
gender ratio was. <br />
<br />
Leaving them with Katie to sort out their emotions, Dr. #2 met with Dr. #1 in a adjoining <br />
lab after checking the health of the mother doe. <br />
<br />
Doctor One said to Doctor Two. &quot;We're just lucky that the management knows that the <br />
hands that primates have are round about the best in the animal kingdom. Otherwise we'd <br />
be going around naked in fur too while working with the guests.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Two snorted, &quot;Personally, I've concluded that many members of the Management <br />
are perverts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. # 1 nodded. &quot;I agree. And we should just be thankful we were able to convince them <br />
that having raccoon hair in the lab would lead to too great a risk of contamination.&quot; This <br />
was not an untruth. Furry hands with claws would be less trust worth to perform surgery <br />
with, or the other explorations that a doctor often simply needed to do. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why'd they want to turn us into raccoons anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the few animals besides primates that have a functional opposable thumb.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; Dr. #2 thought for a moment. &quot;Did you hear law enforcement contractors are <br />
reviewing the husky's performance to see how they compare to mundane human officers? <br />
And the military is considering temporarily modifying soldiers to give them a better <br />
survival chance on the battle field.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. # 1 narrowed his eyes, &quot;You're joking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not. You know as well as I do. This technology isn't just about satisfying the vanity of <br />
the furry subculture, it has practical applications as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just worried about what ramped genetic modifications. They HAVE backfired before.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thus why the Management isn't selling this over the counter, and why they haven't accept <br />
any such contracts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As unscientific as this sounds, let's focus on the here and now. Like making sure our <br />
panther woman's womb can handle a litter, and pray the fetus' stay inside till term. Cats <br />
and apes don't mature at the same rate, and we aren't certain that her body knows that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We should also do an ultra sound on our lead doe... don't forget... dear are infamous for <br />
twins.&quot;</p>
