<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“We have to make our Amazing Aubrey look the part!” Daphne exclaims. <br />
<br />
It is true that you and your girlfriend both dressed fairly casually. You and her didn’t think you needed to dress up. Regardless, your girlfriend does not look like that of a magician’s assistant quite yet. <br />
<br />
“Those clothes won’t do. Let’s see if I can fix that with just a snap of my fingers,” Daphne says. <br />
<br />
As soon as Daphne snapped her fingers, Aubrey’s clothes, including her bra, rip away from her body, and split into 4 sections. The two sections on top merges with her earrings and forms two new long sparkling ear rings. They look very expensive and very beautiful. The other two sections combine with her shoes, transforming them into sparkling black heels. All that she has on now is just her panties, heels, and jewelry. <br />
<br />
You are not pleased with this. While you both knew going in that there could be some nudity from the advertisements, you aren’t happy that your girlfriend is on stage with almost no clothing on. <br />
<br />
“And now for the hair and makeup” Daphne says.<br />
<br />
Daphne snaps her finger again, and a bucket of water appears from a cloud of smoke. Without hesitation, she tosses the water at your girlfriend. As soon as she is splashed, her make-up and hair become so beautiful that she looks like a model. She could easily win a beauty contest. And crazy yet, she was not wet at all from the water. It all vaporized after the splash. <br />
<br />
“Isn’t Aubrey just stunning?!” Daphne says, joyfully. <br />
<br />
Daphne then turns to you, looking at your frowning face. <br />
<br />
“I think our other volunteer here wants our dear Aubrey here to be covered up. Magician assistants are beautiful, but they are also clothed. Don’t worry, I have a solution to this.”<br />
<br />
Daphne has you walk up to your girlfriend, stand in front of her, facing away. You still go along with the act, despite your displeasure. <br />
<br />
“Alright, this next spell, erm, I mean trick is a lot tougher than just snapping my fingers. Hey, Aubrey’s boyfriend, do you give your consent to have me clothe Aubrey.” Daphne says. She sounds mildly menacing for once, but you are desperate. <br />
<br />
“Yes, please,” you say.  <br />
<br />
Daphne takes off her hat and reaches inside of it. She pulls out what looks like a pile of glitter. She then blows all of the glitter onto your face. You try to react to it, but the glitter makes you paralyzed. There was no backing out at this point. <br />
<br />
“Now that the magic powder has reached its target, it’s time to decide what to make with it. I was thinking… one shoulder, black, with sequences,” Daphne says. <br />
<br />
“Huh?” You think to yourself, trying to react. Your girlfriend just giggles with pure joy. <br />
<br />
Daphne then grabs a black stick out of her hat, and taps you on the head with it. It was just a little tap, but for some reason, you are knocked backwards into your girlfriend. <br />
<br />
However, your girlfriend isn’t knocked back from the impact. You just stick onto her. At first nothing seemed to happen, but then you start to feel numb. Your feet seem to float off the ground, but you soon realize that you are also shrinking. Your legs suddenly do the splits in the air, in a surprisingly painless way. Your arms reach up into the air and clap together. You are floating in the air, stuck right to your girlfriend’s body, with the back of your head level with her breasts. <br />
<br />
You are absolutely shocked at this. The previous acts seemed impossible, but this is something else. Something is happening to you. <br />
<br />
“Transforming inanimate objects into other inanimate objects are easy. So is summoning people and object from nothing,” Daphne starts to say. <br />
<br />
You start pressing harder and harder into your girlfriend, with her giggling in glee the entire time. The pressure is so much that you start feeling yourself flatten, and your body becoming numb. Your legs fold back in an inhuman way, and wrap around right above your girlfriend’s knees. Your legs also push against each other  with tremendous force, yet even with all this pressure, you don’t feel pain. <br />
<br />
“Changing people is a bit more difficult. Having a person transform into another, or changing attributes about them can lead to some difficulties. Magic, or at least my kind, cannot hurt or kill other people. It’s against the laws of magic nature.”<br />
<br />
Your arms bent backwards in angles you were never able to bend them before. The pressure is immense, once again, and it makes your arms feel numb. Both of your arms wrap behind your girlfriend’s left shoulder. The pressure on the rest of your body causes it to widen, and slowly wrap behind your girlfriend’s body, tightly. The extra surface area on your body makes it feel foreign to you, like it’s no longer your body. Suddenly you feel your head shoved down, towards your crotch. When it reaches near the bottom of your girlfriend’s breasts, it tightly squeezes into them. Your facial features start to numb until you can no longer feel them, and you lose the ability to blink. You can barely see any parts of you body anymore, but you can tell that they are turning black, and sequences seem to be forming on them. <br />
<br />
“Turning a human into an inanimate object is one of the hardest skills to master. The end result has to still be able to feel, think, and see in order for the act to work. Our volunteer here, or now dress, will still be able to maintain his senses and be able to think, but will be otherwise completely inanimate.”<br />
<br />
Your sides finally meet up with each other, forcing themselves together with even more pressure. Your legs also flatten to the point when they have met up with the rest of your body. Finally, what was once your hands connect to the rest of your body on your girlfriend’s back, forming a single strap around her shoulder. Your body has flatten to the point where you can tell that you have lost all your humanity, and all that remains is a dress. <br />
<br />
“So, Aubrey, since you are my assistant, I have given you the ability to communicate with your dress. Tell the audience how he feels”<br />
<br />
You start cursing in your mind. <br />
<br />
“He uh, feels a little confused” your girlfriend, or Aubrey now says. <br />
<br />
“Well, let’s show her the result of her transformation into a beautiful dress” Daphne says. <br />
<br />
You curse in your mind when you were referred to as a she. <br />
<br />
Daphne summons a mirror, and you see what you have become. A beautiful black dress with one strap and sequences all over, being worn by the most beautiful woman you have ever seen. You try to be mad, but you are simply hypnotized by what you see.<br />
<br />
Despite this, you still try to struggle. You try to move arms that you don’t have. You try to move legs that you no longer have. You try to do anything, but you move nothing. You are trapped. <br />
<br />
“The secret to my tricks is that each effect has completely consent from the recipient, and no physical harm is done. So if anyone would like to participate in the next trick”</p>
