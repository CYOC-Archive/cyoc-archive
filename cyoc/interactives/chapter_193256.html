<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luca Deavor is your cousin from a few states over. Like his father and your uncle from the father’s side, they’re a nutcase when it comes to hunting. Lucky for them, they’ve got relatives that live near a famous hunting location. Ducks are bountiful during the spring but it is the deers that are the prime attraction. Multiple hunting seasons have come and passed and it seems there is always an oversupply of deers in your area. Some already see them as pests as they would often get lost in the suburbs and terrorize children and lawns. Visiting hunters like your cousin and uncle are a welcome sight for the town.<br />
<br />
Luca and his father already came on their truck this morning. They’ve already rented a motel for a few days but since they have relatives in town, they came over to say hi. They came by the house with rifles on their back and with smiles on their faces. The father-and-son duo is always the pair of jolly fellows. This is unnerving because the personality does not match with the look, especially for Luca who looks like your typical teenage delinquent. At the age of 14, he cut his hair short and that became his signature for years to come. Although tall, he’s built a hefty musculature. His biceps are so big and strong that they could crush your head if he wanted to. That wouldn’t be possible now because of your new body.<br />
<br />
You slithered down the stairs with ease. Each movement you take is far quieter than the tick of a clock. You snaked through the kitchen and through the living room where your parents are having a chat with Luca and his father. As usual, the topic of conversation is deers. More particularly, how they are expecting a meal after they share the excess meat with your family. Your mother already mentioned a few recipes. If you were in your prior body, your stomach would growl a whaling call. It seems that this new form lacks the sensation of hunger.<br />
<br />
Moments later, you found yourself underneath the sofa. Luca’s hairy feet dangled in front. Within this inch of a separation, you could already smell the sweaty musk from his 15-hour drive to your place. The long stretch of the Mojave desert helped little in mitigating the stench. <br />
<br />
You stretched a thin proboscis and little by little, you climbed on his feet. Luca sensed sudden wetness on his calves but he dismissed it because he thought it was a mere drop of sweat. The line of slime encircling his feet fed from bottom to top, where the tip of the proboscis trawled deeper above the cavernous inside of his clothes. It’s warm and humid inside. You could feel Luca’s every breath and heartbeat. Whenever you came across a drop of sweat, you sucked it up which increased your volume by a smidge of a drop. <br />
<br />
Now at his pelvic area, you slithered deeper underneath his boxers. There in the darkness, you could still sense the general confinement of where you’re in because of the movement of the air. And despite the lack of light, you could feel the large mass ahead of you. It’s 6-inches by your estimate and that takes into account its flaccid state. You kept yourself thin and slow to not alert Luca of your presence. Slowly and carefully, a thread-thin piece of yourself probed inside the tip of his dick. The glans is a sensitive area and Luca took immediate notice. He scratched his penis but the sensation won’t leave.  He looked at your parent’s faces and smiled. Then he excused himself to the bathroom to see what the deal was with his penis.<br />
<br />
The moment you felt him stand up, you hastened your entry towards his urethra. The nearest bathroom is upstairs and Luca knew about it. Just as he was climbing the stairs, you grazed an area of his testicles where numerous nerve-endings are laid bare for your invasion. You quickly bound it, which rendered Luca into a salivating mess by the stairs. He sat on the steps, opened his pants, and stretched his boxers. What he saw surprised him that he nearly screamed. It’s something wet and it’s pushing inside his penis. He tried to pull the last bits of it before it completely disappeared, but his fingers failed to grasp it because of its slippery surface. Luca could feel it slithering inside of him. His insides moved and he could feel each second. He tried to call for his father but it seems you have already taken control of 3/4th of his body. You sensed what he’s going to do and stopped it before he could. With the areas in your control, you had Luca walk to your bedroom and had him undress as soon as you closed the door. Luca still had control over his head so he is seeing everything as much as he is feeling it.<br />
<br />
Confused and completely bare, Luca could only beg to this strange voiceless form that took his body as a plaything. Little by little, darkness coalesced in his eyes. Only a twinkle of light remained and that too disappeared. You blinked your eyes open and you saw your reflection in front of the mirror you walked to. It’s your cousin Luca! <br />
<br />
In this new body of yours, you are in a hyper-aware state. You could feel every inch of muscle that was in improvement to your own. You felt how huge your biceps are or how strong your calves are. You could taste the morning breakfast of bacon still leftover in the crevasse of your teeth. You fail to breathe in the entire capacity of your lungs because your mind is still used to the prior smaller set of lungs. Everything is vibrant and sharper, even sounds from the living room are audible despite the thick slab of wood dividing your bedroom’s floor and the living room’s ceiling. Perks of a hunter, you guessed. <br />
<br />
Closer to the mirror, you see his face in an angle unseen from before. Your eyes are a vibrant shade of amber. Your hair has a similar hue, it’s cut short like those you’d find in the military. Using your phone, you snap a picture of yourself. Memorabilia to commemorate the first body you’ve possessed among possibly many. With a new flesh at the ready, things to do next circle your mind.</p>
