<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(sorry so short) <br />
<br />
Act as if in a trance, Amy left her brother with Martha and the four other shiva wolves. She <br />
felt it. Oh gods she felt it! She knew precisely what revision to existence reality had made <br />
now to keep itself consistent. She took some items from her room not waking the other <br />
pups and climbed to the roof (oh how her mother would have shouted at her). <br />
<br />
Once safely on the top of the room, Amy sat down, she'd do this at the beach, but this <br />
amazingly had more privacy, and she wanted to be able to feel the sun as she .... as she... <br />
<br />
Amy cried, her tears looking like two new lines on her white fur. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, I'm so, sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
Reality, HAD no heart. It's creator did surely, but existence itself had no morals or <br />
consciousness, no pity or cruelty, it simply did natural what path allowed for existence to <br />
heal itself in the most effective manner without erasing a thing totally from existence. <br />
<br />
Amy used one of her claws to prick her own paw, drained the blood into a small ink pot, <br />
and taking a calligraphy brush and with talent born of another life time, she write down in <br />
english and kanji the names Marcine and Jack and their family names. Of family and <br />
friends who no longer remembered them even existing. Amy choked back tears again. She <br />
didn't want to smear the writing. <br />
<br />
Amy knew the chaos being assimilated harmlessly into reality was needed for existence to <br />
continue without damage... but that didn't mean she had to like it!<br />
<br />
Amy wrote names of people who no longer went by those names, had never gone by those <br />
names and those who would never exist now. her blood acting perfectly as ink as she <br />
made her way down the scroll. She thought for a moment, then included what would have <br />
been the names of Trevor and Queen's kittens. Couples who could no longer meet. <br />
Children who could no longer be born. <br />
<br />
The brush nearly broke in two in her paw's grip. <br />
<br />
And of course, there was Jack and Marcine, two human souls, the most precious thing in <br />
all of creation until the advent of two new species of man now walked the earth. &quot;Don't be <br />
silly Amy,&quot; She said to herself in a completely unsure and almost scared tone, &quot;Souls don't <br />
have species or genders or ages...they, they are eternal...&quot; <br />
<br />
Amy put the brush back in the tiny ink pot of her own blood. She shivered. &quot;Jack-san... <br />
Marcine-san, I am so sorry for you. If not for the shifts in reality, a cure could have <br />
existed for you, but... if you were never human... there is nothing to revert. I know you <br />
wouldn't understand what I mean by it but, I am so sorry...&quot; <br />
<br />
'Is this my punishment for cheating? The reaction to my action?' It made Amy feel sick to <br />
her stomach to think that her removing the power of 'instant devotion' from the <br />
transformation gifts of the pack... wait...<br />
<br />
&quot;The cubs didn't transform... the cubs with their power to leap from one location to <br />
another in the real world like Alice and her sisters can in the mirror world...&quot; Amy <br />
wondered... had THAT been the final nail that had caused this punishment as a natural <br />
reaction to pushing reality in one direction to where it would push back? Had the fact the <br />
pups not transformed when brought into the mirror verse... were Jack and Marcine now <br />
paying that price? To be sentient at heart, but to lack the things that made sentience <br />
worth while. <br />
<br />
&quot;The more I and Marie-chan try to make sure things in this remade reality work out all <br />
right... the more reality seems to punish us for trying to rewrite fate according to how we <br />
think reality should be... Jack-San, Marcine-San, I beg your souls for forgiveness.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then there was the rest of the gold deer. They were logically now biologically as <br />
capable of being sapient as Jack and Marcine.... did they all have souls now too? Was that <br />
even within reality's will to make souls from nothing?  Or where they like the -things- <br />
Marie Cruz had secretly helped wipe out centuries before, self-aware, but devoid of <br />
anything that made self awareness a noble trait....<br />
<br />
Amy didn't WANT to know where those souls came from if it as the former. If it as the <br />
latter, then Jack and Marcine would be unique compared to the rest of their kind till they <br />
died of old age... However long they lasted now with the life span of an uber healthy deer. <br />
<br />
'Jack and Marcine accept it as their fate that their herd is meat for the pride and pack even <br />
before reality shifted but... but still..'  &quot;At least before Jack and Marcine were respected for <br />
-becoming- what they were... &quot; <br />
<br />
Weather they had souls or not was meaningless in the end. The gold deer were sentient or <br />
sentient enough. But they did have a culture, the ability to use tools, a society. All those <br />
deer who Jack and Marcine had attracted before going to Big Bad island had gone from <br />
being limited and confused by what Jack and Marcine had been teaching them, to being as <br />
aware of the universe as they were.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I know it's not cannibalism,&quot; Amy said to herself, &quot;If it's not the same species, then it's not <br />
cannibalism.&quot; But hadn't some of the pack been talking about the legendary Big Bad Wolf <br />
as if he was a cannibal in spite of the fact his victims had all been humans? <br />
<br />
&quot;Meat with a brain that is aware and understands.&quot; Amy thought, &quot;It would have been <br />
kinder if they had just become dumb animals who couldn't fully appreciate their fate.&quot; Amy <br />
sighed, &quot;But reality -isn't- kind.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You were a paladin.&quot; Marie Cruz said the winged dragon/lion statue (purely atheistic, after <br />
all, gargoyles could carve themselves to resemble nearly anything, but could only function <br />
properly in stone shaped like a winged humanoid), &quot;You were part of a just and honorable <br />
order whose duty was to protect pilgrims on their journey to the holy land. But your king <br />
betrayed you and called you an evil sect.... You came to this holy place for refuge after <br />
seeking refuge with the stone beasts. I will need your help soon to protect those of our <br />
faith. As a Knights Templar, I ask you to fulfill your duty one last time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The statue didn't move, didn't visible react. Marie Cruz sighed. <br />
<br />
In another timeline, she had come to a descendant of a Knight Templar who had carried on <br />
the training and code of his ancestor in secret (though this was hardly the powerful <br />
shadowy sect that later conspiracy theorists would create any surviving templar into).  Now <br />
that this man had become stone. She had come to him instead in this timeline. <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz walked away. Wondering if in ten years it would be easier to bring a statue or <br />
a gargoyle to the new world.</p>
