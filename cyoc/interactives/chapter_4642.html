<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Being fiftythree and well on my way to looking like a billard ball I had forelorn hopes for this over having tried the regular medical stuff.<br />
<br />
I unscrewed the old wax jar lid and again sniffed the rich aroma from the salve. As I was about to dip my hand in for a gob the words of the little man pulsed in my head.<br />
<br />
Looking about I remembered the big blue glove my wife used when cleaning the shower stall with that lime stuff. Bending down I opened the door to the storeage shelve below the sink and picked up the glove.<br />
<br />
A quick slip in and I was ready to try the lovely stuff. A dip of two fingers put a tablespoon glob on the glove. As I massaged the stuff on my bald knob is seemed to sink right in. In only a second it was gone and left no oily trace, nothing!<br />
<br />
I stood looking at the jar and then my head. In a quick second I dipped in for another round just for good measure. It was then the sound of a garage door opening scared me to embarressment. The new glob was smeered off on the side of the jar as I rubbed the stuff left on the glove all over my head, ears and back of my neck.<br />
<br />
Looking about I slipped the special jar into a deep hole in between a stack of bathtowels. Then heading down to the basement garage I was ready to greet my dear wife.<br />
<br />
As was normal she had a ton of things from the mall. My arms loaded with packages and boxes she stepped upstairs to await me, the delivery boy!<br />
<br />
She bubbled about all sorts of things and people she had met. I was absolutely bored to death as I wanted in the worst way to tell her of where I had gone that morning.<br />
<br />
The phone rang and she started talking to her sister in Ohio. I knew from the past that this could be an hour long go-a-round. Feeling as a little boy scorned I walked away with head hanging and wondered what to do with myself.<br />
<br />
It was well after dinner when she calmed down and began to talk like a human and not a magpie. I again listened as was the usual thing for me to do around the wifee'.<br />
<br />
At last it was bed time and I crawled in under the sheets. The wife took a long time in coming out but then opened the door to display her new nighty. I stared at the little woman in her tight fitting red laced very small suit.<br />
<br />
I know now what never in this old fool mind I should have said but the best that moment could bring forth was a rational comment. &quot;Dear me dear you'll catch your death of cold this winter!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her smile rolled into a scrunched angry grin and to say very little about her mindset she was plain pissed off.<br />
<br />
I smiled a friendly sort'a dumb grin as if I was joking but the ice was forming fast!<br />
<br />
She crawled into bed and sat with her knees drawn close to that so well endowed chest. &quot;I only wanted to spark our life a little!&quot; she said with a wimper. &quot;I bought this today and was of hope you would take me to bed and show me a good nights.....&quot;<br />
<br />
I knowing what was coming knew that making up was going to take a couple of warm and loving hours. As we rolled about, her smoothing a soft hand in places to lure me on. As I probing and carressing her very oily skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear your head!, she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
I stopped and brought my hand to my head. I jumped out of bed and went to the bathroom for a good look. The light on and the mirror cleaned of steam I saw to my amazed eyes deep black hair about two inches long covering my head. <br />
<br />
As the wifee came in she was also amazed and reached her hand up just for a tug to see if it was a rug. An ouch from proved it real but it was then she pointed to my ears. <br />
<br />
The hair was also growing on them. not as long a hair but thickly covering the ears like a puppies fur. I reached up and felt of the thick fuzz and as my finger pursed the strange feel a new problem came into touch. Hairy they were for sure and also pointed.<br />
<br />
With this new me in front of her I began to tell of my day down in China town. The shop of such wierd things my buying the salve which then I showed to the wifee. I was rambling on when I suddenly took a look at the wife's round face.<br />
<br />
She suddenly looked quite odd as her eye brows seemed to have grown together. Indeed even as I watched little hairs sprouted and grew from her forehead and cheeks.<br />
<br />
I was about to exclaim about what I was seeing when she asked about the small green perfume bottle I had in my coat pocket. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where is it dear?&quot; I asked with an urgent note in my voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I used it all over me, just for you dear!&quot; said the wifee.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a sample potion for God knows what! The Chink gave to me when at first I couldn't decide on anything to buy. He said to go home rub it all over and see and feel the enjoyment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly the wife went crazy and began pushing me from the bathroom straight into bed. In a second she had me and her naked and wrapped in kisses and wild touching. I of course loved it even as I wondered where her small self got the muscle to push me down the hall like that!<br />
<br />
I was in my second round of entering her hallowed gates of love when the touch of her body drew my renewed attention. Hair, long shaggy hair! she was covered head to foot in pure white long shaggy hair. <br />
<br />
Her fingers were more nimble and searching as she pressed me all over. Finger nails which glowed of horrid wild colors were now black and flat ended. <br />
<br />
I kissed her lips which felt thicker a kinda like rubber. long straight hairs poked me from around her mouth as we kissed. A pouty little upturned nose now seem to flare the nostrils wider. <br />
<br />
As My hand carressed her head a scrape from sharp points on top of her hairy forehead. As she began to suckle on something she never did before my fingers brushed aside the hair to see short horns growing.<br />
<br />
Try to stop her one person orgy she had wild eyes which glared of bright yellow in place of her blue one's from an hour before.<br />
<br />
Strength of ten men in her arms and legs as she would work me around for the best position for her sexual enjoyment. I loved it as never before but knew that being married to a nanny goat might rise some eyebrows at church.</p>
