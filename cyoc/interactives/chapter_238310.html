<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know what? It&#39;s not like the escorts and the parties are gonna be going anywhere. If you&#39;re not comfortable with that right now, we can have fun some other way. Like, say, testing the waters on the pizza boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke sat the laptop on the kitchen table, the house seeming so quiet and empty without dear old dad running his mouth and acting like being a father made him the dictator of the house. And mom, of course, making excuses for him. The older brother admitted that as the two of them settled in for the night the initial plan was a lot more violent than this ended up being - and possibly a lot easier to crack in case people got the bright idea that anything untoward happened. The addition of the Chronivac was a pleasant surprise and one that Luke was eager to keep around. It certainly made keeping things discrete easier!<br />
<br />
&quot;So uh, now that mom and dad are gone,&quot; Eric said, suppressing a broad smile, &quot;How about we get something on TV for some background noise. I mean, they can&#39;t exactly yell at us any more for watching something &quot;Un-Christian&quot;.&quot; Eric was already thinking about washing the floor, just in case - as well as to completely remove any remaining hint of their parents from existence. Even the small blobs of fucking protoplasm was a little too much of those two to remain in existence.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want anything in particular from Amato&#39;s?&quot; Luke said, already over to and on the phone and starting to tap his foot as he waited for the desk clerk to pick up. Such was the name of one of the pricier pizza places around the burbs. They of course did delivery. What place like that didn&#39;t these days?<br />
<br />
&quot;Just my usual. Small size, pineapple, meat, pepperoni, white sauce, thick crust, you know my deal.&quot; Eric sat down in the kitchen by the Chronivac Laptop, checking the display once, and then again. Making sure that the change was complete and total. No risk of resurgence. No expiration of the change... nope. Sure as sure could be.<br />
<br />
Though looking at the computer and a notification from social media made Eric realize they were also gonna need to deal with the logistics of selling Twixxer. As far as he knew, neither of them had any intention of keeping the stakes, which had been managed in such a way as to leave the stakes to family in case anything happened...<br />
<br />
&quot;Awright awright awright!&quot; Luke grinned as he twirled the phone in his hand, doing a little McConnaughey as he planted the landline back down. Honestly, Luke had every intention of scrapping the damn landline. It wasn&#39;t the 1980s any more. &quot;We got our pizzas. I&#39;m gonna be eatin&#39; something in the personal size. Gotta maintain my cut AF figure.&quot; He pushed his button up shirt further open and rubbed his hands over his abs and obliques, showing off his well formed body.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I need a little more mass.&quot; Eric crossed his arms over his chest, &quot;I swear, you are built like a fucking tank, bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All in the 6 day workout schedule and good dieting, bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them fist bumped, and clapped each other on the opposite shoulder before moving to look at something to put on while they waited for the pizza to get there. It was honestly pretty telling that the channels were still on there, but they were just expected to honor and fear their dad&#39;s rule about not watching any &quot;degenerate smut&quot; on the TV. Presumably, he enjoyed the said degenerate smut a little too much to take it straight off the TV&#39;s available channels.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s Netflix and fuckin&#39; chill!&quot; Luke said as he wrapped an arm around his brother&#39;s shoulders, hugging him as the two of them sat down in front of the kitchen TV on a couch. A quick survey of the programs on left the two of them looking through a variety of TV shows - some of them were highly recommended TV series that tackled mature subject matters, and were lauded by reviewers across the net. Others, like the one about the plastic surgeons and their trashy teenage son, involved furniture fucking, gay guys who tried to turn their son into a clone of their young self, and the teenage son becoming a murderous mime.<br />
<br />
Aka, it was the perfect background noise for their wait - and the inevitable fun they had with the pizza delivery guy.<br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t know what they expected out of the nonsense show, but certainly watching a woman attempt to pay the two plastic surgeons to feminize her teenage son was...not up there in the expected plots. At least the actress understood the assignment well enough - and portrayed the part of a shrieking, smug villainess to the hilt. And, given their history with parents, they could enjoy watching the inevitable takedown of her.<br />
<br />
About twenty two minutes into the episode, the doorbell rang.<br />
<br />
And that told Eric that their food was there. He didn&#39;t even bother putting on any further clothes. He let his opened up button up billow a bit as he walked over - checking the door to see a guy in an orange and white t-shirt, track pants, and boots. He had curly brown hair, light green eyes, and a decently athletic body. He was a pretty good looking guy, and the broad shoulders told Eric that he had probably once been a powerfully built athlete - even bigger than now - but likely sustained some kind of injury - an impression assisted by the obvious favoring of one leg as the guy awkwardly stood out there.<br />
<br />
Eric opened up the door, and the guy started, &quot;Amato&#39;s Pizza, can I serve this...up to you...with any...?&quot; A blush quickly showed across the brown haired young guy&#39;s face as he realized how little Eric was wearing, and what this looked like. &quot;...Sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric looked over at the kitchen, where Luke was quickly moving over to the table, landing so quickly on his ass on the chair that he almost made it tumble over. But Luke settled - and raised a hand to give Eric the thumbs up indicating the time was now. A mischievous grin on the elder brother&#39;s face. Eric then looked over the delivery guy and said, &quot;Come on in, I swear I&#39;ve got your payment in here...somewhere...&quot; Eric opened the door wider - letting the young man in.<br />
<br />
The delivery man seemed bewildered by what he was seeing, but as he looked at Eric&#39;s rear, he bit his lip. &quot;I&#39;m uh, I&#39;m Drew. By the way.&quot; Drew promptly found himself thinking of how weird it was that he was getting so hot over this. He didn&#39;t usually think of himself as gay, or even bi, but he had ALSO not had sex in months. He and his girlfriend were severely on the out and outs, and a break-up was inevitable. So maybe he was just a bit pent up. So seeing an ass like that, even an ass attached to a man, it made Drew feel like misbehaving. <br />
<br />
<i>Jeez</i>, Drew thought, <i>I&#39;ve never been this erect in my fucking life.</i><br />
<br />
Eric for his part noticed the bulge at the front of Drew&#39;s track pants, and licked his lips a little. Glancing over at the table, Eric nodded with a smirk, and in turn, Luke smirked right back and nodded as if to say that this was his doing.<br />
<br />
Indeed on the Chronivac, Luke had loaded up Drew&#39;s information, letting him see what they were working with. The young pizza delivery guy was 23, full name Andrew &quot;Drew&quot; Ingilsbe, this was his third job, and he had indeed been a former high school athlete - but he wrecked his knee at the big game and apparently had been extremely nervous about getting back in the gym. Still, he was cuter than most delivery guys. And apparently he was sexually frustrated. Which was probably not helped by Luke giving him a big, sensitive 8 inch cock.<br />
<br />
Luke started putting in some further changes. Now, he figured, let&#39;s edit that accident in the big game back in high school and make the injury less severe...<br />
<br />
Hitting the button to change Drew thusly...<br />
<br />
Eric started looking around in the living room, while making sure to always leave his ass facing Drew, knowing full well what he was doing. Speaking of whom, Drew was shifting awkwardly as he stood there holding the pizzas. His shirt was not fitting him as well as it should have. Which made sense, because his pecs were thickening in real time, growing larger and pushing the buttons on his shirt further and further. Not helping matters was the thickening, broadening midsection.<br />
<br />
Drew wasn&#39;t exactly ripped, but he had abs if he flexed hard enough. No, he was big, and he was thick, and he excelled in tackling other men. And right now, Drew felt like fucking tackling Eric with all that he was going through. Dude had to know how this felt. How this looked. Teasing him like this, when his girlfriend was fucking doing this to him...bro, it was not fucking fair. Was...was Drew really gonna go gay just for...<br />
<br />
&quot;And I swear I had the money somewhere around here...&quot; Eric shrugged, looking at the broadening, stronger features of Drew, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll need to find some other way to pay you for the pizza. I mean, surely I have something around here. Rich and all...&quot; Eric tilted his head, grinning. And despite being the more academic brother, Eric knew well enough from experience with the queer guys at their private school that he was...decently good looking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are...are you gay, bro?&quot; Drew rasped out, asking in a husky voice, trying to make it less obvious to the older brother sitting out there on the computer. As if Luke wasn&#39;t utterly in on this. &quot;Cuz I---I can sure fucking think of something. If you&#39;re as into this as I think you obviously are...I mean. You can---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, seriously?&quot; Eric said with a chuckle, &quot;I come off as gay?&quot; Just when he saw Drew looking like he was gonna blow a gasket with all the teasing going on, Eric nodded, &quot;Well, okay. I&#39;m down. Just let me see how strong you are.&quot; Moving on over, Eric started feeling up Drew&#39;s body, outright feeling the delivery guy&#39;s quad thickening and stretching out the track pants in real time - right before starting to pull them down.<br />
<br />
Drew let out a long, harsh breath as he felt Eric&#39;s hands rubbing his quads, and then moving up to his ass. By now, Drew was starting to realize, as a button popped off of his shirt, that something fucky was going on. That he was not as he walked in. But he was so desperate to get laid, and just wanted someone to touch him and to want him the way he wanted to be desired...well. He didn&#39;t exactly care it was a man at this point. He didn&#39;t care that his body was seemingly regenerating to the muscled, thick glory of his high school athletics.<br />
<br />
If anything slightly more built up from age.<br />
<br />
Drew groaned as he felt Eric licking his balls a little as the guy pulled his boxers down. Eric looked up at him and smiled, &quot;My last girlfriend taught me some pretty good techniques for this. She was so good at this. Lemme know if I&#39;m doing well...&quot; Eric gulped, and started going down on Drew - all the while feeling up the jock&#39;s midsection and, reaching into his tight shirt, feeling his pecs, too. Eric bobbed back and forth, all the while licking the whole length of the jock&#39;s manhood.<br />
<br />
Drew for his part was left reeling - holding on to one of the arms of a couch as he tried to keep himself standing up straight...only to fail and sit down. Grinning like a fool as he enjoyed his first blowie in months. &quot;Oooh man you are so fucking fine, dude, so fucking fine. Love what you&#39;re doing with that tongue.&quot; Drew moaned as he let a hand lightly grip Eric&#39;s head. Honestly, Drew could really enjoy this...<br />
<br />
And out in the kitchen room, Luke looked over the changes that had been undertaken in regards to their delivery guy so far. Drew was now back to the state of fitness he was in during his school years...if not slightly more. Because sometimes, Luke felt like being a nice guy. Sometimes. Because now he was thinking about what he could do to Drew as his little bro enjoyed their congress. Honestly, the guy was so responsive, and enjoyed what was done so far... Luke decided whatever he did next, he would make the pleasure Drew felt during it even more intense. Just to see how that went.<br />
<br />
Luke whispered to himself as he typed up the next change...</p>
