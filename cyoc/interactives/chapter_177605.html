<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">[A short while later]  .<br />
<br />
Six orgasms later and Danny and Izzy were still going strong. In fact, the bluejay and weasel appeared to be just reaching their seventh dramatic climax as they started to call out and shift around in release. Then, you got to witness the familiar sight of the two animals cumming as they sprayed more lubrication out from their oozing sexes. However, just like usual, neither animal allowed this to slow them down as they kept pleasuring each other like mad.<br />
<br />
And so, things continued like this at a furious pace, as Danny and Izzy worked passionately on building towards their eighth orgasm together. Sadly though, it turned out that all of their efforts had been for nought, as Vicky started to eagerly count down the last few seconds on her watch…<br />
<br />
 “Time’s up!” Vicky announced a few moments later, “sorry girls, better luck next time!”<br />
<br />
The bluejay and weasel both went wide-eyed when they realised that they had failed. However, this wasn’t enough to stop their rapidly-mounting pleasure as their bodies seemed to move together of their own accord.<br />
<br />
Inevitably this ended as anticipated: with a fresh wave of fluid shooting out from both of the startled animals’ sexes. However, the horrified weasel and bluejay were quick to untangle themselves, before they both slumped down together and started panting heavily. Sadly, the two animals now couldn’t bear to look at each other, given that the disgusting act they had just performed had all been in vain.<br />
<br />
“My, my,” Vicky chuckled as she looked at the father and son huddled together, “you two have come a long way since you first got here. I remember when you would struggle to reach just one orgasm, and now look at you; you can’t seem to get enough of each other’s taste!”<br />
<br />
Neither animal really replied as they groaned out deeply. Clearly, Danny and Izzy were both utterly exhausted from their ordeal as they remained panting and struggling for breath.<br />
<br />
“Well dears,” Vicky said as she moved over to the scorpion’s tank,” I’m afraid you know what that means don’t you? Now it’s time to say goodbye to Emma, at least in her current form…”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made you slightly confused as you wondered what Vicky meant by this. However, Danny and Izzy seemed to know exactly what was coming as they collectively cried out together, begging Vicky not to proceed.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Vicky said as smiled evilly, “our little experiment involving Emma is truly fascinating. You see, we decided to play with the Zoo’s curse a little bit, just to see how far we can take things; and so far the results have been amazing!”<br />
<br />
Vicky briefly paused at this juncture as the three nervous animals continued to look up at her pleadingly. “Now, as I’m sure you recall Princess, the curse works in two stages. First, the subject transforms into a suitable mate for whichever animal comes into contact with them. In your case, you became a mare because you chose to take Harry out for a ride. Then, I’m sure you vividly remember him fucking you by the lake? Well, that only locked your changes in for a week, which is why we had to cram all of your training in before you were ready to mate a second time; thus finally making the changes permanent!”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made you snort in protest as you were cruelly reminded of your ordeal back at the stables. However, this only seemed to amuse Vicky as her smile broadened across her face.<br />
<br />
“However,” Vicky continued, “we have found that if another species is introduced to the subject in between the two stages, that is when things start to get really interesting; since they will change again to suit their new partner. What this means is that it is possible to keep changing a subject’s species over and over, which is exactly what we have been doing with Emma ever since she arrived!”<br />
<br />
You whinnied out in shock when Vicky said this. This whole situation was so messed-up, and yet, you found that you couldn’t stop listening; since what Vicky was saying genuinely fascinated you in a sinister, morbid sort of way.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Vicky said with a smile, “Emma began her time with us as a mare, not too different to you Princess. But then, when it came time to seal her changes for good, that’s when we instead decided to begin our little experiment. Of course, we needed to keep Izzy and Danny properly motivated, which is why we promised to let Emma change back to normal if they managed to complete the same challenge they had today. Of course, they both failed miserably on that first occasion, meaning we let Emma turn into a heifer in order to sustain the curse for another week. This process has continued for three years since then, with Emma changing from cow to goat, goat to sheep, sheep to pig and so on. And every week, we give Emma’s husband and son the same challenge to try and save her. Of course, they have still not managed it yet, which makes we wonder if they ever will…”<br />
<br />
Upon hearing this you whinnied out again as you joined the bluejay and weasel in their cries of despair and denial. From what you could gather, Vicky could still let Emma turn back into a woman if she wanted to. Sadly, inflicting this sort of cruelty seemed to make Vicky tick. Clearly, she loved seeing Danny and Izzy being so full of hope despite being stuck in a truly hopeless situation.<br />
<br />
“Now then,” Vicky said as she moved over to the scorpion’s glass terrarium, “because Danny and Izzy failed their task, it is now time for Emma to change again…”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky reached into the scorpion’s container and deftly grabbed her by the tail. This finally knocked Emma out of her docile state as she started to snap at Vicky with her pincers and thrash around in her grip. However, Vicky simply smiled as she brought a small brown object into contact with the scorpion’s underside.<br />
<br />
From where you were standing it was difficult to see exactly what was happening, that is, until Emma started shrinking!<br />
<br />
The bluejay and weasel cried out in despair as they too seemed to notice this dramatic change. Unfortunately, Emma also seemed to be fully aware of what was going on as she flailed around even more desperately in Vicky’s outstretched arm.<br />
<br />
Sadly though, Vicky didn’t stop whatever she was doing while the scorpion continued to change in her hands. Soon, as well as diminishing in size, the scorpion’s other features were clearly beginning to recede as a familiar brown colour started to creep over her body…<br />
<br />
You stomped your hooves in outrage as you finally understood what was happening. Vicky was transforming Emma into some kind of small creepy crawly, which is why the scorpion was now rapidly shrinking away to almost nothing.<br />
<br />
However, soon it was impossible to see what was happening as Emma was now able to fit inside Vicky’s cupped hands. Meanwhile, Vicky continued to watch the action as she stared eagerly at the transforming animal in her hands.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Vicky finally brought her hands over to where you and the others could see them. In response, all of you let out various noises of shock when you saw, wriggling around in Vicky’s hands, a pair of small brown mealworms!<br />
<br />
“Haha,” Vicky chuckled, “do you like Emma’s new body? Well, I can confirm that she certainly does, given that these two little critters have already successfully mated once!”<br />
<br />
Again, this revelation did nothing to help the general mood as Danny and Izzy continued to watch their transformed family member with large, sorrowful eyes.<br />
<br />
“Awww don’t look at me like that,” Vicky said mockingly, “Emma will have many other mealworms to keep her company. And even if she doesn’t like it, you’ll get another chance to buy her freedom next week. Until then though, I think all three of you ought to go back to live with members of your own kind…<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky promptly carried Emma and her new mate over to another glass tank, which was filled with dozens, maybe even hundreds, of the same small, squirming worm bodies. Helpfully, the terrarium was split down the middle into male and female sections. Therefore, Vicky put the male back with his friends, before she brought Emma to where she would be spending the next week.<br />
<br />
Vicky paused for a moment as she smiled down at the helpless worm wriggling around in her hand. However, this moment was only fleeting as, with a gentle brush of her fingernail, Vicky marked the little mealworm with a streak of her red fingernail polish. You figured this was so that Emma could be easily identified amongst the mass of writhing bodies; since she clearly stuck out when Vicky lowered her down into the tank. Then, Vicky blew Emma a kiss before she turned back to her distraught husband and son.<br />
<br />
“Right,” Vicky said with a clap of her hands, “now that Emma’s dealt with, I think we can put you two back where you belong.”<br />
<br />
Upon hearing this, Danny squeaked and Izzy squawked in defiance, clearly not wanting to be put back with their mates. However, you now realised that Vicky could lock Emma into her new form whenever she wanted, which helped to explain why the couple did eventually do as they were ordered as they crept back towards their respective cages.<br />
<br />
With the bluejay and weasel now under her power, Vicky carried on with their humiliation as she first helped get Izzy inside her cage. The horrified bird continued to screech out in denial as Vicky cruelly forced her towards the male bluejay that was waiting for her. Vicky then made sure to push Izzy’s front half down low, thus ensuring that her cloaca was on full display as her tail naturally lifted out of the way.<br />
<br />
Sadly, the male bluejay was quick to capitalise on this golden opportunity as he hopped onto Izzy’s back and immediately began rubbing her cloaca with his own. In reply, the female continued to cry out in denial as Vicky kept her pinned firmly in place. She then waited until the bird’s mating instincts had fully taken over before she finally withdrew her hand and locked the cage behind her.<br />
<br />
With the two bluejays now happily grinding away at each other, Vicky then moved to deal with her petrified son. Danny squealed out sadly as Vicky simply opened her cage and motioned for her to go back inside. The weasel was clearly hesitant, but with all of the threats that were looming over her and her family, she knew there was only one real option left open to her…<br />
<br />
As a result, Danny was soon firmly locked inside her cage as she too was set upon by her eager mate. Consequently, the cries of the weasel and bluejay quickly filled the room, as father and son were passionately fucked side-by-side.<br />
<br />
With her humiliating performance now complete, Vicky decided that she could finally return all of the animals to their proper locations. As a result, the bird and weasel cages ended up beside each other, while the tank full of mealworms sat on top. This meant that the three family members could still spend their time together, though you seriously doubted whether that was actually a good thing.<br />
<br />
And so, as Danny and Izzy’s cries filled the building, Vicky finally turned to begin hunting for her next victim.<br />
<br />
Soon, after inspecting a few of the various cages and glass tanks, Vicky seemed to finally make her selection. Consequently, Vicky brought the animal over and placed it on the table in front of you.<br />
<br />
Then, you could only watch in stunned silence as Vicky reached into the animal’s container and introduced you to yet another one of her family’s unfortunate victims...</p>
