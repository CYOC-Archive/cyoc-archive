<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frank&#39;s POV - 11:00 AM<br />
<br />
&quot;Ughhhh what happened yesterday&quot; I uttered as I felt my throat to be really dry while saying that. I groggily opened my eyes and I was welcomed by a bright light that coming from the window. The room looked familiar I thought...that&#39;s right, I&#39;m back in my room. I was never the clean freak so scattered all around were my boxer briefs that should have been washed ages ago, and some of my textbooks from school. Despite being at home, I wondered why everything felt so odd as if something&#39;s not right. There was a glass of water sitting at the table near my bed and I drank it, hoping my throat will moisten up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh much better&quot; I said, hearing my familiar tenor voice. At 16, I was a bit of a late bloomer so my voice still cracks here and there but it was a bit deeper than it was compared to last year. I slowly rose up from my bed and went to my restroom to wash my face. I still felt weird while walking, as if I feel pounds lighter despite not really losing a lot of weight recently. I&#39;ve always been a toned and lean guy, with me having more of a runner&#39;s build. My dad&#39;s genetics is leaning more on the bulky side and I guess I didn&#39;t inherit that. <br />
<br />
As I entered the restroom and washed my face with cold water, a very familiar face saw right back at me. It was me...but why does it feel odd looking at myself in the mirror? It felt like something is amiss but I really couldn&#39;t tell what it was. My dark brown eyes look as warm as they&#39;ve always looked, and my hair is a shaggy chestnut brown. I didn&#39;t really need to shave much because I don&#39;t grow much hair anywhere. I tried to smile and I look like how a cheerful 16 year old would look like. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Might just be a bad night&quot; I said as I started to brush my teeth and later on prepared my clothes. I picked up some clothes from my closet to prepare myself for the day. It&#39;s a Sunday so at least I have the day to myself. My fashion sense isn&#39;t really anything to brag about. Both Lucas and dad are more stylish than me and they usually like clothes that show more skin. As for me, a sweatshirt and some jeans usually fit me just fine. Today though I&#39;m feeling a bit different and I suddenly have the desire to mix it up a little. Dad&#39;s clothes wont fit me but maybe I should ask Lucas later. <br />
<br />
I suddenly heard a knock on the door, and I saw my mom enter. She was looking pretty ordinary with her chestnut hair tied in a bun and having no make-up on. It seems like she just finished cooking breakfast because I can smell the distinct scent of freshly made lemon bars (which were my fave), some brewed coffee, and some buttered toast. I was never a coffee person but lemon bars are my favorite so I was excited to go down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good you&#39;re awake. Come down and lets have brunch, your dad is waiting for you&quot; mom said. I went down feeling excited for the lemon bars that await me there. I don&#39;t have much of an appetite so I&#39;ll probably eat just a piece or two but it was still exciting since mom only makes them in special occasions. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something special going on?&quot; I asked, inquiring her why she made lemon squares<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh nothing, I&#39;m just glad to see you and your dad feel better&quot; she said. I wondered what she meant by welcoming us back? With how bad I felt from me waking up last night, I wondered if there&#39;s something I don&#39;t remember happening. <br />
<br />
As I went down, I see my dad already finishing his first plate of brunch...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
David&#39;s POV - 10:00 AM<br />
<br />
&quot;Ughhhh fuck my head hurts&quot; I grunted as I felt my head still pounding a bit. I slowly opened my eyes and saw myself lying in a queen-sized bed. I saw my wife fixing our clothes for the day nearby and she approached me when she saw me wake up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Frank how are you feeling&quot; she asked?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing alright. What happened yesterday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure Frank, all I know is Dr. Markle told me that you and David suffered from a massive migraine&quot; she said. I felt her hands all over my rugged face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like you don&#39;t have any fever. Come on now, go take a shower and come meet me for brunch later&quot; she said as she left me all alone to prepare myself for the day. <br />
<br />
I went to the restroom as she asked me to and I took off my clothes to take a shower. A cold shower is just what my body needed because everything felt so off since the moment I woke up. I usually just use a regular bar of soap whenever I take my shower but right now I felt like using a shower gel instead. David and his mom prefers to use shower gels, I remember them talking about some shit about how soaps dry up your skin. I personally don&#39;t care about that but something in me today is telling me to use a shower gel instead, and there&#39;s no harm in trying it anyway. <br />
<br />
After my shower, I toweled myself up and stared at myself in the mirror. I know I just shaved a day ago but my stubble is being extra hardy today. I pride myself in looking pretty good for a man near his 40s but somehow I feel conscious in seeing my hair have some grays in it. Maybe I should consider dying my hair at some point I thought. I usually am against the idea but right now I&#39;m feeling a bit bothered seeing myself with grey hair, as if it feels like something is wrong seeing me like this. <br />
<br />
Lucas seems to be the only one who got my rugged looks as David appears to take more from his mother. Lucas had crystal blue eyes just like me, and a more angular and rugged look that the girls are suckers for. I remember my black hair blue eyed stud look was a hit with the ladies back then, I even got some guys to come after me. <br />
<br />
I see my clothes that were prepared for me. A complete set of blue briefs, some sleeveless white shirt, and a pair of cream colored shorts. These are things that I usually wear but today something in me wants to cover my body up a little. I looked in my closet and saw some plain polo shirt and I decided to wear that on top of my sleeveless shirt for today. <br />
<br />
My clothes are usually tight fitting because I&#39;m quite proud of my body, especially at my age. I may not have a six pack, but my pecs are massive, my biceps are throbbing, and my ass looks mighty fine. I usually flaunt it but now I was just not in the mood. It could just be a bad night but I&#39;m not even in the mood to lift weights right now (I usually go the gym daily)<br />
<br />
Maybe a meal will help up clear my mind I thought so I went downstairs and saw the table ready. A cup of brewed dark coffee was prepared and a plate with big servings of ham, omelettes, and four slices of buttered toast were ready for me to gobble up. I usually wait for at least one other member of the family to join me but right now I was so hungry that I couldn&#39;t wait. <br />
<br />
&quot; &#39;Sup dad&quot; I heard David say as he was walking towards the dinner table with his mom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hope you don&#39;t mind&quot; gesturing at my now empty plate. &quot;I&#39;ll get another serving anyway&quot; I said as we both laughed heartily like a father and son would. <br />
<br />
&quot;So mom, what happened last night&quot; asked David...</p>
