<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the Alpha&#39;s realized Jared was missing, and filed a missing person report. They were bombarded with a raft of complaints and harassment from over a dozen different women, all claiming that Jared had forced himself on them, pressured them into sex acts they were clearly uncomfortable with, and two even claimed to have been drugged at parties. Their friends describing Jared as the last person seen with them.<br />
<br />
This left the police very unwilling to expand the search wider and includes the national media.<br />
<br />
The cold shoulder response shook the Alpha house to the core. Their leader, Kyle, was forced to put the frat into lock down, ensuring all the brothers remained at home when not in class or the gym, traveled in groups, and were never left alone with any women. The Alpha men, left unable to party or let of steam, started fighting and drinking more in the fraternity, the noise carrying over the road to the Beta house.<br />
<br />
In the Beta house, Kaiden was on the border of panicking. He had been having nightmares of Jared reforming into his human self, running from the Beta house and revealing what Kaiden had done to him. He was wracked with guilt over what he saw as a murder. The guilt compiling more at his own lust at Jace&#39;s attention to him.<br />
Jace, enjoying his newfound size and virility, had been approaching Kaiden every morning for a blowjob before he fucked him. The evening involved Kaiden showering after the gym, before Jace entered his room and took his time pounding Kaiden&#39;s quivering hole. Staring intensely as his girth slid inside, practicing rocking his hips and angling his thrusts just right to pound Kaiden&#39;s prostate.<br />
<br />
Kaiden had cum hands free every night, normally as Jace approached his third time shooting, and each night Kaiden felt sexy and powerful. His body feeling lighter then air for hours after each session. Kaiden even found himself able to push himself further at the gym despite the thorough work out his ass was receiving daily.<br />
<br />
In Jace&#39;s mind, he was loving his newly developed homosexuality. His cock felt amazing, sliding in and out of Kaiden&#39;s ass. Jace loved the way Kaiden&#39;s ass spasmed every time he hit his prostate. He loved how Kaiden&#39;s ass felt slightly looser, slicked with his cum as he worked up his next load, he liked Kaiden moaning in his ear as he rested his full weight on top of him, his hips driving the thick girth home.<br />
And every time he made Kaiden cum, he felt full of pride, the look on Kaiden&#39;s face as he came drove Jace over the edge. Jace&#39;s eyes drank in every bit of pleasure he was giving Kaiden, his own muscular form dripping with sweat as his big, overtired cock pulsed inside Kaiden&#39;s cum slicked hole, still feeling horny but overworked and overtired.<br />
<br />
Kaiden had tried one morning to turn Jared back to normal, quickly removing Jared from Jace&#39;s groin one morning, but found he was unsuccessful. The dick just didn&#39;t respond to the reversal spell no matter how hard he tried.<br />
One thing Kaiden had learned as a result, was that the dicked cock could be removed if the person pulling clearly thought about what they were doing. This meant there was unlikely to be an accidental de-dicking of Jace.<br />
Small blessings, he thought.<br />
<br />
The worst thing was that Kaiden&#39;s dreams made him wake hard as a rock, precum pooling inside his briefs. <br />
While he clearly felt bad, he could see the guilt fading slightly, and he was worried what he would become if he started to enjoy dicking people.<br />
<br />
The situation had taken a stranger turn, as the student that had escaped from Dennis&#39; dicking in front of Kaiden, had been making a scene all over campus, drawing crowds of leering, teasing students who mocked his story of being turned into his own cock as a drug fueled delusion.<br />
Kaiden had seen the poor man trying desperately to get someone to believe him. The muscular blonde with broad shoulders, piercing blue eyes, and white marble like skin being removed by campus security several times over the last week.<br />
Kaiden had found out his name was Nick, and that he had been kicked out of his sorority for causing public ridicule on it, and had strangely managed to find his way into the Alpha house. The Alpha&#39;s not as concerned about his outbursts as it distracted people from the claims against Jared.<br />
Yet the search was still slow and without public support.<br />
<br />
<br />
A few days later...<br />
<br />
“I know your secret.” Paul had whispered one morning, causing Kaiden to spill his coffee.<br />
“Wh-what secret!” Kaiden had stammered as he stared wide eyed at Paul.<br />
<br />
“That you and Jace are fucking.” Paul had replied, causing Kaiden&#39;s pounding heart to settle slightly.<br />
“It&#39;s ok. Me and Ryan have been together since he moved in here.” Paul had continued, sipping his own coffee as he smiled gently at Kaiden before leaving the room.<br />
<br />
Kaiden stared at the empty doorway for a long time after Paul left, his mind reeling as he got lost in a cycle of paranoid thoughts, of divine retribution or lifelong incarceration.<br />
<br />
Then his phone rang.<br />
It was Jace.<br />
He better tell him whats had happened.<br />
<br />
That night Jace showed up in Kaiden&#39;s room, followed by Paul and Ryan. They had brought folding chairs and 2 boxes of beers which they used as a makeshift table.<br />
<br />
They spent  a long night drinking, playing cards and eventually, talking candidly about everything that had happened.<br />
<br />
Paul had gruffly revealed that he and Ryan, while together, were frustrated sexually. Paul loved the idea of topping, but was unable to effectively fuck Ryan&#39;s ass. Ryan, a total bottom, had relied on sex toys the entire time to get off. The two men were in love but the sexual rift was tearing them apart. Paul had heard Kaiden getting fucked in the bathroom one morning, and finding only Jace&#39;s room empty, had deduced the showers occupants. So finally, at the end of his rope, Paul had turned to Jace and Kaiden to try to improve their sex life and save their relationship.<br />
<br />
Jace had said he would have to have a long hard think about what he could tell them, sitting quietly as he finished another beer, playing his cards silently.<br />
It took a few awkwardly quiet rounds before Jace sighed, sliding his hands down under his waistbands and started massaging himself, drawing skeptical side eyes from the other men in the room. Then, once he was hard, he stood quickly and dropped his shorts, his 8” cock bobbing freely in the air.<br />
<br />
Paul and Ryan both sat shocked, their jaws hanging wide opened as Kaiden squirmed in his chair. Lust and fear flowing over him.<br />
<br />
“When did you get so big?” Ryan stammered out after a long minute of silence. <br />
<br />
“Kaiden gave him to me.” Jace said quietly before turning to Kaiden. “But now I think its time I passed him on.”<br />
His eyes full of resigned determination, tinged with a hint of underlying sadness.<br />
Kaiden stared at Jace for a long moment, thinking about what he was being asked. <br />
 His mind spun, thoughts of how selfless Jace was to sacrifice his new manhood for his friends, how he would miss that hard dick pounding him nightly, and the question that sat in the back of his mind. <br />
Why hadn&#39;t Jace removed Jared by himself.<br />
<br />
Kaiden stood up, taking a deep breathe before wrapping his hand around Jace&#39;s now leaking cock and pulling gently, his mind focused on moving Jared to his new human owner. A small sniffle caught Kaiden&#39;s attention, as he looked up to see a tear streaming down Jace&#39;s cheek.<br />
<br />
The answer was suddenly clear. Jace simply did not really want to give up his new girth, and therefore lacked the willpower to remove Jared himself.<br />
<br />
A small popping sound alerted Kaiden to the fact that Jared was now free, and he looked down to see Jace&#39;s groin smooth and featureless. <br />
<br />
“W-will it grow back?” Jace stammered out as he stared at his neutered form.<br />
“Over the next few days your old dick will reform. Exactly as it was before.” Kaiden replied somberly as he turned to Paul.<br />
<br />
Paul and Ryan had both sat motionless, in awe of the strange display happening in front of them, and aroused.<br />
If their cocks had been longer then they might have been visible in their shorts, but they were not that fortunate.<br />
<br />
Kaiden indicated for Paul to stand, the much taller, broader man timidly standing as Kaiden nodded to his shorts.<br />
Slowly pulling the fabric down, his own small endowment bobbed free, a long strand of pre forming at the end of his micro dick.<br />
Kaiden leaned forward, gently pressing Jared&#39;s base over the top of Paul&#39;s cock. The bulky redheads small dick seeming to sink back into himself, until the large 8” cock rested flat against his groin. <br />
Ryan watched from his sitting position the edge around the base of the large cock merge with Paul&#39;s skin, the dark hairs slowly changing colour to match the dark red hairs that Paul had all over his body.<br />
<br />
Kaiden released his grip, causing Paul to take a small step back, not recognizing the large cock that now swung from his groin, the large mushroom head flared and becoming shiny from the precum now leaking from his slit.<br />
Slowly, Paul&#39;s hand reached for his new cock, his hands needing to feel the hard meat, to make sure the masculine appendage was indeed a part of him. Needing the sensation to tell his brain that THIS was now his cock.<br />
<br />
“You better look after Jared here.” Jace spoke, wiping away his tear and then downing the rest of his beer.<br />
Paul&#39;s hand froze as he looked at Jace. <br />
“You mean Ryan don&#39;t you?”<br />
Jace shook his head as he opened another beer. <br />
“Nah, I mean Jared, swinging their as your new cock mate.”<br />
Ryan chuckled as he looked back and forth between Kaiden and Jace, his smile quickly fading at their solemn expressions.<br />
“He was blackmailing Jace, threatening to get his professor to fail him. He tried to force me to suck his dick, and I accidentally turned him into one...” Kaiden&#39;s voice trailed off, his lie about the real events feeling feeble. Thankfully, the absurdity of the situation meant the two men didn&#39;t push him on it.<br />
<br />
Paul finally wrapped his fist around his new cock, gasping as pre started to leak out. He looked as Kaiden, his eyebrows lifted slightly in confusion before turning to Jace.<br />
“I feel like some residual sensation or memory is coming to me through Jared. You have put him up Kaiden&#39;s ass quite a bit. I feel like this cock remembers it faintly.”<br />
<br />
Jace looked at Kaiden, taking a large swig of beer. <br />
“The feelings and memories were much stronger when Kaiden first put him on me. We can&#39;t turn him back now. Jared is gone, but that cock must retain some imprint of its past actions and desires....”<br />
<br />
Kaiden raised his eyes at Jace, realizing that Jace must have pondered the situation thoroughly as well, despite appearing at ease around him. He must have seen how messed up Kaiden had been, and was trying to make him feel more at ease about everything.<br />
 <br />
Paul slowly stroked the full length, a deep groan escaping his lips at he looked down at Ryan, biting his lip, before turning to Jace again.<br />
“Jace. Kaiden. I can&#39;t thank you enough for this. I know it must have been a difficult situation to be in, but don&#39;t worry. We..” Paul looked Ryan directly in the eyes. “We will keep Jared, and what happened to him, a secret.”<br />
Ryan nodded quietly, a small sliver of drool escaping his lips as he looked back down at the large, leaky meat swaying gently in front of him.<br />
<br />
Paul laughed slightly, tucking Jared into his pants as he sat down. <br />
“Patience babe, we will have plenty of time for fun, but I believe right now, I was about to take Jace&#39;s last $20.”<br />
<br />
The four men started to laugh as they got back into their card game, Ryan performing very poorly as he kept staring at the tented fabric in Paul&#39;s lap.<br />
Kaiden sighed a breath of relief, grateful that his friends were on his side. They reached their final round, the last hands wager was the final can of beer. It was down to Kaiden and Ryan, each staring the other down as Jace and Paul tried to make them break their poker faces. Each trying to call a supposed bluff from the other.<br />
Then the sound of shattering glass snapped the four men out of their revelry as Jace rushed to the window to see what was going on.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU CUNTS UP TO!” Jace roared as he saw four outlines in the shadows next to his car.<br />
Startled, the smallest turned tail and bolted across the road, as another of them sparked up a match and dropped it through the shattered window.<br />
The sudden blaze that erupted within his car lit up all four figures and Jace could see exactly who they were, just as Kaiden&#39;s head  peered over his shoulder.<br />
“This is in honor of Jared! It&#39;s not right that he&#39;s missing and useless shits like you are still here!” The obviously drunken figure sobbed as he stumbled back across the road, pocketing the box of matches, his remaining two Alpha bro&#39;s staring into the flames, giving a quick salute before sprinting back to their dorm house.<br />
“Baby dicked Beta&#39;s beware, more is coming your way!”<br />
<br />
Kaiden stared in disbeleif, realizing that the Alpha&#39;s had followed through on the threat Jared had made toward Jace right before Kaiden dicked him. He barely realized that Jace had bolted downstairs, grabbing a fire extinguisher, while Paul had already dialled the police.<br />
<br />
Snapping back to reality, Kaiden sprinted downstairs to help, several other Beta&#39;s appearing out of the their rooms, and gathering buckets of water from various taps around the house to put out the blaze, but the damage was done, the entire car interior ruined. The thick smell of  burnt leather and charred melted plastic  burnt Kaiden&#39;s nose.<br />
<br />
It took a total of three minutes to put out the blaze, and Paul stated the cops were another 15 minutes away.<br />
Kaiden looked around, a dozen Beta&#39;s staring forlornly at the burnt out interior of Jace&#39;s car. Jace visibly shaking as he cursed loudly across the street at the Alpha house.<br />
Kaiden followed his gaze, noticing four figures creeping away from the house in the shadows to the house side. A large group of Alpha&#39;s flowing out through the front door, the four responsible conveniently absent.<br />
<br />
The gears turned in Kaiden&#39;s head as he realized what was happening. It was going to be the Alpha&#39;s word against the Beta&#39;s word, but the four pyromaniac bro&#39;s were conveniently NOT going to be present when the police arrived, their entire house lying for them, giving them rock solid alibis.<br />
<br />
A burning feeling rose in the pit of his stomach as Kaiden pulled Paul, Jace and Ryan to the side, quickly updating them on his thoughts. While Jace argued in disbelief, Paul listened silently, nodding along while Ryan appeared distracted. Typing away furiously on his phone before suddenly thrusting his phone into the center of the circle, the lit up screen confirming Kaidens&#39; suspicions.<br />
The four frat bros had made plans to go to a sorority party tonight and posted it all over social media. <br />
<br />
Jace went silent as his shoulders went limp, Paul silently putting his arm around his shoulder to support him, before finally speaking.<br />
<br />
“We can&#39;t let them get away with this.” He said stoically as he stared into Kaiden&#39;s eyes, his gaze full of meaning.<br />
“But how are we gonna prove to the cops that they were here?” Kaiden replied uncertainly.<br />
<br />
“We aren&#39;t.” Paul whispered as Ryan turned to stare wide eyed at him.<br />
“Kaiden. Go to the party.” Paul said firmly, his quiet voice full of authority. “We&#39;ll stay for the cops. Tell them we couldn&#39;t see any faces. Grab your backpack, cut across the neighbors backyard to the walkway and then order an uber from Jennings street. When you get to the party...”<br />
Paul paused checking none of the other Beta&#39;s were listening in.  “Find them, and Dick em.”<br />
<br />
Kaiden swallowed hard.<br />
“This isn&#39;t the first time, or anywhere near the cruelest they&#39;ve been to us. Have you had enough of their shit Jace?”<br />
“I&#39;d had enough long ago mate.” Jace sniffed, his voice quiet and defeated.<br />
<br />
 “But I don&#39;t even know who they are!” Kaiden finally spoke up, his body trembling at what they proposed HE do.<br />
“Ryan.” Paul looked at his boyfriend, who was frantically searching on his phone.<br />
“Jace, here. Point out who was there.”<br />
Jace stared at the group photo, before singling out three faces. “The fourth one isn&#39;t in that photo, but I know who he is. Tyler, Jared&#39;s younger brother.”<br />
<br />
Ryan nodded as he quickly snapped a few screenshots and sent them Kaiden&#39;s phone.<br />
“There you go. Jared&#39;s brother Tyler and the three pyro Alpha dicks. Derrick, Tony and Luke. Now go get em. I&#39;ll set up a group chat. Text when you are on your way back. Ask if we want Pizza if you got them all, or fried chicken if it doesn&#39;t all go to plan. ”<br />
<br />
Kaiden nodded before quietly walking back inside, his heart in his chest as he tried not to draw any attention to himself as he fetched his backpack and then slipped out the back door.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Arriving at the party, Kaiden walked straight through the wide open front door and into the crowd.<br />
The music was loud and the place was packed shoulder to shoulder. Kaiden struggled to move through the densely packed crowd, struggled to make out any of the faces in the moving crowd as he made his way to one of the drink stations. Quickly downing two full cups of beer to try and calm his nerves, before pouring up a third one. Kaiden was interrupted by a very distinct voice.<br />
<br />
“Ya might wanna slow it down, mate. The nights only just beginning.”<br />
It took Kaiden a second to register that someone was talking to him, the slightly unusual accent catching him off guard.<br />
Looking to the source he found the voices owner digging into a plate of nachos, grinning slightly in his direction.<br />
The short, nearly buzzed black hair, dark brown eyes that seemed to sparkle slightly, the well shaped 5 o&#39;clock shadow and that cheeky half smile caught Kaiden off guard, his mind going blank for a moment before his mind kicked into overdrive and caught up.<br />
<br />
“Uh, sorry bout that. These kinda parties aren&#39;t normally my thing. Trying to hard to calm my nerves.”<br />
“Forget about it, just relax and chat with your friends.”<br />
Kaiden remained silent as he quickly glanced into the crowd, still not seeing any familiar faces, especially his &#39;targets&#39;.<br />
“Oh, that&#39;s why the nerves. You came out and you don&#39;t know anyone here. It&#39;s all good, seems like we&#39;re all just gathering by the kegs.”<br />
<br />
As the beers kicked ins, Kaiden started to relax a little. Slowly sipping his drink and chatting with the other guy.<br />
Duncan, a post graduate student on scholarship from London. He and another exchange student from Ontario, Wade, had to join a frat to keep their scholarship and were supposed to meet one of the frats &#39;inner council&#39; members for potential induction and hazing tonight.<br />
Duncan didn&#39;t seem worried, making light of the situation.<br />
<br />
“-Yeah its all bullshit innit? They&#39;ll probably want me to chug some beers, make out with some girl, prove that i&#39;m not a total social outcast and regale me about the horrors of their own hazings. I ain&#39;t worried, this is only the first one we&#39;ve approached....”<br />
Kaiden found out that Duncan&#39;s accent was called an Estuary accent, a weird mix of the more pronounced formal English from the British documentaries and period dramas, combined with a bit of the &#39;lower class&#39; cockney slang. Apparently very common, although Kaiden had never heard anything quite like it.<br />
He&#39;d been introduced to Wade, another tall guy with a solid shoulders. Short light brown hair styled into a very short fauhawk, hazel eyes, and some chest hair visible at the top of his shirt.<br />
<br />
Kaiden tried not to look both Duncan and Wade over but found the long night of drinking more than he was used to was starting to hit him hard. Sitting down on a windowsill, Kaiden kept chatting while looking out among the crowd, not seeing any familiar faces until almost an hour had passed.<br />
<br />
Then they appeared, from the kitchen as if they had been there all night. All four of the bastards who had torched Jace&#39;s car earlier that night. Heading straight over to Kaiden. <br />
Suddenly frozen in fear, realizing he couldn&#39;t dick them in a room full of people Kaiden&#39;s heart raced, the seconds ticking far too slowly, until suddenly one of the guys grabbed Duncan by the shoulder, spun him around  and shook his hand.<br />
<br />
“Luke. How are ya mate?” Duncan shaking his hand as he took a large sip from his drink. <br />
“Was starting to think you weren&#39;t gonna show.” Duncan joked as the Duncan and Wade formed a circle with the four newcomers, chatting away before Luke started to guide them towards the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Duncan gave Kaiden a quick smile before following the group out back keeping as much distance as possible in such a crowd, while still being able to overhear some words.<br />
He figured there was some initiation to see if the guys were Alpha material, and that the initiation was also going to be for Tyler tonight as well. The barely 18 year old teen behaving far so cocky and arrogant that it was hard for Kaiden not to furrow his brow while he tried his best not to be noticed.<br />
<br />
Shame it didn&#39;t work. A girl with long brown hair leaned next to him at the kitchen counter as he poured himself another, albeit much weaker drink, before she grabbed his wrist and pulled him rather strongly out of the kitchen to the  small area by the front door.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t waste your time trying to latch on with those losers. Those Alpha&#39;s are the fucking scum of the earth.” <br />
The girl yelled right into Kaiden&#39;s ear.<br />
“I-I wasn&#39;t-” <br />
“Oh, Fuck off! You so were trying to get close so MAYBE you can join in on their creepy little frat games, but it&#39;s MY duty as a Sorority mother to guide people away from bad influences.” Taking a large swig from her drink. “Hic. And those-those fuckers are the worst. If I hadn&#39;t been overruled by a stupid MAJORITY vote, those assholes wouldn&#39;t even be aloud to be in here.-”<br />
<br />
Kaiden tried to speak but she seemed either not to hear him, or simply didn&#39;t care he was trying to speak.<br />
 “-but thats just silly old Jessica, being a prude about the frat house with the MUSCLIEST guys. Just because some girls can&#39;t keep it in their pant&#39;s when approached by someone like that, we ALL have to put up with them being total douchebags to everyone else. AMIRITE!?! Stupid junior pledges worried about being labelled as frigid bitches if they don&#39;t put out. FUCK!”<br />
<br />
“TOTALLY!” Kaiden finally managed to reply, eliciting a big smile before Jessica stumbled away, Duncan appearing from the crowd after.<br />
<br />
“Yo dude. These Alpha guys are planning on initiating us in, tonight. Can you believe it!?! We are supposed to wait for some signal before heading up to the  master bedroom and we&#39;ll be tested to see if we are Alpha material.”<br />
Duncan replied cheerfully.<br />
<br />
“Duncan, Duncan man. No,no ,no DUNCAN LISTEN TO ME!” Kaiden interjected as Duncan kept trying to speak.<br />
“How long have you been in town for?”<br />
“Just a couple of days man. Why?”<br />
“What do you know about the Alpha&#39;s reputation?”<br />
“Nothing. Why?” <br />
Duncan was suddenly a bit skeptical, picking up on the serious tone. Leaning in close and whispering. <br />
“Is some serious shit going to go down tonight?” <br />
“I think so.”<br />
“What kind of shit?”<br />
“I don&#39;t know.”<br />
<br />
Suddenly Wade&#39;s tapped Duncan on the shoulder. <br />
“They&#39;ve given the signal, come on.” Pulling Duncan away as a look of worry started to creep into his face.<br />
<br />
Kaiden followed slowly, Duncan looking over his shoulder back at Kaiden several ties before he was led into a bedroom and the door firmly shut behind him.<br />
Kaiden didn&#39;t know what to do, but found he had joined the line for the upstairs bathroom and he needed to piss real bad all of a sudden.<br />
The line seemed to take forever, and when he finally got into the bathroom, we washed his face with cold water, questioning if he was really going do this, or if he even could. <br />
Leaving the bathroom, Kaiden had a lump in his throat and sweaty palms as he slowly wandered just passed the stairs, before leaning against the wall and checking his phone. Ryan had set up the group chat with a simple &#39;let us know when you are on your way back. :-)&#39;<br />
<br />
Kaiden sighed, clueless about what to do next.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Jessica was by his side, yelling just a bit too close in his ear.<br />
“I know you&#39;ve been watching those bastards, where are they at the moment.” Her words slurring as she swayed side to side.<br />
<br />
Kaiden pointed at the closed door, which she stared at for a long moment before suddenly charging forward, throwing her body weight against the door, banging and yelling at the top of her lungs. Followed by the sounds of heated argument, muffled through the door.<br />
Kaiden looked around and realized there was no one else in the upstairs hallway, so went to try and calm her down and find out what was going on, but as he tried to put his hand on her shoulder, the door swung open and the both of them were suddenly pulled inside.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The next few minutes flew by in a blur, and it was only now that Kaiden was huddled in the backseat of Duncan&#39;s car, waiting for Duncan and Wade to show up, that he was able to piece together what had happened.<br />
<br />
Both him and Jessica had been pulled into the room.<br />
On the bed there was blonde girl wearing one of the sorority pledge shirts, unconscious with her underwear pulled off.<br />
Tyler was standing next to her, his pant&#39;s unbuttoned as he stroked himself to hardness, a box of condoms laying on the bed next to the defenseless girls leg.<br />
<br />
Duncan and Wade were standing in the corner, Derrick pointing a small handgun at them, while Tony and Luke restrained Jessica and Kaiden from behind. Jessica, Duncan and Wade had been shouting but were silenced as Kaiden was pushed forwards, Derrick grabbing him and placing the cold metal of the handgun against his temple.<br />
<br />
Derrick nodded at Tony, who tightened his choke hold on Jessica until she went limp, before unceremoniously drooping her on the bed with a loud thud.<br />
<br />
The room was silent until Luke approached Derrick and whispered in his ear, cocking his head towards Tyler.<br />
<br />
“Yeah I know he&#39;s technically only 7 & ½ inches but he Kyle&#39;s brother, that&#39;s why we are initiating him. We all owe Kyle big time in one way or another.”<br />
<br />
Kaiden, remembered hearing those exact words, before Derrick pushed him forward, hitting over the head with the butt of the handgun.<br />
<br />
A loud BANG silenced the room as Kaiden fell to the floor clutching the back of his head, Wade helping him to his feet, leaning Kaiden against his strong frame in the corner.<br />
Everyone held their breathe as Tony checked the door, waiting a long minute before closing the door and nodding to Derrick.<br />
No one had heard the gunshot, or if they had, had decided not to investigate it. Probably thought they misheard it over the loud music downstairs.<br />
<br />
Duncan started trying to reason with Derrick again, but went silent as Derrick pointed the gun straight at Duncan&#39;s face. <br />
<br />
“This is your initiation Duncan, now that you are in this room, you can&#39;t leave until you have fucked one of these two girls while we film it. You need to prove you are an Alpha in every way that counts. Taking what you want, and proving yourself a &#39;big man&#39; where it counts.” Derrick said grabbing his crotch as Tyler cackled loudly, sliding a condom onto his now hard dick.<br />
<br />
“What are you on about mate?!?” Duncan said with a shaking voice.<br />
“There isn&#39;t a single alpha below 8 inches, right?” Kaiden said quietly, as the stars filling his vision started to fade, his vision returning to normal.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, except maybe Tyler here, but he&#39;s a special case.” Derrick cocked his head with a sinister grin. <br />
<br />
“So what about the guys who aren&#39;t packing enough?” Duncan asked nervously.<br />
<br />
Tyler laughed as he interjected. “You still have to fuck the girl. The tape is so you will stay quiet, or else we put you in jail and ruin your reputation, but if you aren&#39;t big enough, you&#39;ll never be an alpha.”<br />
<br />
Luke spoke up as he  pulled out his cellphone.<br />
“I&#39;m all set, just tell me when to start filming.”<br />
<br />
“Wait until he&#39;s inside the girl. The tapes can&#39;t show Tyler&#39;s size or else Kyle will get us all kicked out.” Derrick spoke firmly.<br />
<br />
“How long have the Alpha&#39;s been doing this?” Kaiden asked, his voice quivering as his hands trembled.<br />
<br />
Derrick sneered at him as he answered, venom in his voice. “Since the frat was founded in the 70&#39;s. EVERY single Alpha has been on tape fucking a roophied girl. Recorded proof for our brothers that they take what they want, and meet all the requirements of being a true ALPHA. Once an Alpha, always an alpha.”<br />
<br />
Kaiden felt bile rising up his throat, the realization of what the Alpha&#39;s had done, and were planning on still doing sickening him to his core. His entire body shook as his face flushed red. His eyes locked on the cold steel aimed in his direction.<br />
<br />
He was ready, but the gun was the only thing stopping him from dicking Derrick.<br />
His mind raced as he realized he needed to dick all four guys quickly, before one could escape or go for the gun afterwards. He might even need to dick Duncan and Wade, although their pleading, and location in the corner under threat of quick bullet told him they were unwilling participant&#39;s like himself.<br />
<br />
Kaiden expanded his focus, his vision blurring slightly as he struggled to see the entire room, the shaking settling slightly as he became aware of movement on the bed. Tyler was climbing on top of the poor blonde, Jessica&#39;s body shifting with the new weight on the mattress. <br />
“SHIT!”<br />
Tyler cried out a split second before the surprise kick that sent him sprawling. <br />
Derrick turned his head, saw Jessica was awake and spun around, the gun pointing upwards as he prepared to whiplash her with the butt of the gun.<br />
<br />
Kaiden&#39;s eyes blazed with white light, his glasses turning the light yellow as he poured all his energy into the spell. The magic blasting out in front of him, rolling over all four Alpha&#39;s and the two women on the bed.<br />
<br />
Suddenly there were four piles of clothes thudding to the floor, followed be three loud bangs as the handgun fell, the impacts of it bouncing against the floor causing it to fire into the wall.<br />
<br />
Screams echoed from the corridor as Kaiden panted. Duncan and Wade frozen as they watched Jessica drunkenly amble to the edge of the bed, sitting herself up shakily as she looked around confused.<br />
It took only a few moments, before the music was suddenly cut short, the sounds of panicked running and shouting outside as it was made clear that the gunshots had been clearly heard, the party goers fleeing for their lives.<br />
<br />
The next few minutes went by in a blur, a Wade picked up Derick&#39;s clothes and then dropped them when he founds Derrick&#39;s soft dick inside, the discovery causing Jessica to break into hysterics as she rolled her sorority sister onto her side, and made sure she was breathing.<br />
<br />
“Serves them right, they think with heir dicks, now they are dicks!” Jessica snorted and cackled as Kaiden stared. <br />
It wasn&#39;t until Duncan placed his hand on Kaiden&#39;s shoulder that he snapped back to reality.<br />
<br />
Pulling his backpack from his shoulders, Kaiden started to stuff Derricks clothes, his dick folded up inside into his backpack, before moving onto Tylers. He was just finishing with Tylers, when he turned to find Wade and Duncan standing there, each holding a bundle of clothes with a flaccid cock and balls resting on top of each pile.<br />
“Dude, you saved our lives. Even if I don&#39;t know what the fuck just happened.” Wade finally spoke as he helped fit everything into the backpack.<br />
Wade turned around and then suddenly lurched forward, grabbing Duncan  by the shoulder and pulling him back. Duncan&#39;s finger tips almost grazing the fallen handgun.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t touch it. You don&#39;t want your fingerprints on it.” Wade&#39;s voice firm as Duncan stared wide eyed, nodding silently. <br />
<br />
“How long are you gonna keep them as dicks before turning them over to the cops?” Jessica interrupted the silence, her question aimed at Wade.<br />
<br />
“I didn&#39;t have anything to do with this, ask him.” Wade pointed at Kaiden defensively, his calm facade starting to crumble.<br />
<br />
Kaiden stood silently, staring down at the full backpack in his hands, his throat dry as they stared at him.<br />
Taking a deep breathe and swallowing hard, Kaiden slid the backpack onto his shoulders before answering.<br />
“If you don&#39;t lead the cops to me..., they won&#39;t be turning back.” <br />
<br />
Kaiden&#39;s gaze traveled back and forth from each persons face, as he waited for their response, the moments ticking by feeling like an eternity. <br />
“Sound&#39;s good to me.” Jessica said, smiling widely, receiving a firm nod from Duncan. <br />
Kaiden looked into Wade&#39;s eyes, seeing the same conflicting emotions playing out in his eyes that had plagued him these last few weeks. <br />
<br />
“They left me no choice, and if I turn them back, I&#39;ll probably end up in some government lab or a mental hospital.”<br />
This answer didn&#39;t abate Wade&#39;s struggle, but Duncan placed his hand on Wade&#39;s back, calming his down before his feelings could turn into full blown panic.<br />
<br />
“Mate. It&#39;s alright. We&#39;ll talk it through a bit more later, when it&#39;s safe, but right now we gotta get our stories straight before the cops get here.”<br />
<br />
“The cops!”Kaiden snapped back to attention. “They can&#39;t know I was here!”<br />
“Agreed.” Jessica said as she wandered over the desk in the corner and scribbled on a piece of paper, before tearing it out of its book and handing it to Kaiden.<br />
<br />
“My number. Text me in a few days and we&#39;ll meet up and discuss whats next. If the cops ask, I don&#39;t know you.”<br />
Jessica grinned as she wavered slightly, still clearly intoxicated.<br />
<br />
“We should stay as well. Back up her story...” Duncan muttered before patting his jean pocket, and fishing out his car keys he tossed them to Kaiden.<br />
<br />
“The red Honda on around the corner on the right. Hide in the backseat and wait for us. You can tell us everything after we deal with the cops.”<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Kaiden was snapped out of his thoughts, as Duncan and Wade suddenly opened the front doors and hopped in. <br />
Wordlessly Duncan held his hand back for the keys, starting the car up and driving for a few blocks before speaking.<br />
<br />
“So Kaiden.... Where are we headed?”</p>
