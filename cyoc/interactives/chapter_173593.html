<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When you entered the shop once again, the man you wanted to see apparently had gone home and was replaced by a female clerk. Still, you felt that it wasn&#39;t as big of a deal who you spoke with, and more that you at least got to speak with someone. So you approached the front counter to politely introduced yourself. &quot;Oh, welcome back! And before you ask, please don&#39;t mind my appearance, and I won&#39;t mind yours&quot; the woman said with a wink. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, fair enough. Actually I had a question about myself..&quot; you began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess, impulsive behavior that your body seems to do as if on auto-pilot? Yeah that is normal. The more you take of a person, the stronger the chance for their habits and mannerisms to be transfered as well due to the muscle memory and such.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s what&#39;s happening. Cool, thanks. I can deal with that if that&#39;s all it was. I was beginning to worry that I would end up becoming my sister in both mind and body.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense. What would be the point then of the device if you just became each other? Nope, as long as you do not swap 100%, or specifically your brains, you will never become the other person, at least fully.&quot; When she finished explaining, you felt a lot better hearing it. &quot;Now, do you have your remote, I would like to check something quickly&quot; she asked. You handed her the remote and waited patiently as she looked it over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhh! Lucky you. You weren&#39;t supposed to get this model, but its too late now I guess. This one has an adaptive augmentation system installed. It is are latest prototype actually, which shouldn&#39;t have reached the shelves yet. Damn it, I let him use our body durring the day time, and this is what he does to thank me. Hey a word of advice, don&#39;t let another soul leach off of your body, even if it is your husband. Anyways, this adaptive augmentation system makes minor changes to you based on what you would best enjoy as you swap parts. It is why your cocktail is able to get so long, and why you&#39;re permanently horny. They system felt you would enjoy this form better than the intended one, and made the change for you.&quot; She handed the remote back to you, which you gladly accepted. And as you were putting it back inside your purse, she added one more thing. &quot;Hey, press that button on the back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curious, you did, and the remote began to twist and warp itself until it had practically vanished. All that remained was a few new faint blue tattoos on your hand, which resembled the interface. &quot;There, now you won&#39;t lose it accidentally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is awesome, thanks!&quot; You now moved on to the other reason for comming here. After leaving the clerk for the time being, you begin to explore the various aisles. Like before, nothing is overly interesting, at least for their listed prices to be worth paying. Nothing was attracting your attention until you saw them, and even better, they were within your price range. <br />
<br />
On the end display of the aisle, sat a pair of earrings. Each had a small, swirling, purple, crystal sphere which hung down from a short wire. However their appearance was secondary, their functions were what you really wanted. <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Earrings of Control&quot;<br />
<br />
Left- Implants hypnotic commands into your target perfectly which cannot be ignored or resisted against. Durration of command is set inversely proportional to its complexity. (Simpler and short commands last for a longer period of time than complex or lengthy commands)<br />
<br />
Right- Alter the functionality of the targeted entity to be anything, even if it normally isn&#39;t possible, as long as it reasonable. For user&#39;s to stay sane, it is recommended that they just don&#39;t question how it works, and just accept the fact that it does. Example: You can make breasts lactate motor oil, but not bricks, because the oil is still a type of liquid. Does not effect anything with magic, including magical devices.<br />
<br />
Price: $200.00 for either one or $350.00 for both. <br />
<br />
*Comes with 1 free complete reset on the store&#39;s behalf. Any further assistance in fixing things will be priced at the time of their request.<br />
<br />

<br />
You grabbed them both and put them on. They weighed almost nothing too, which was nice. You could feel a kind of power enter your eyes, as they gained their respective side&#39;s earing&#39;s targeting function. You looked in the mirror above the shelf and could see a feintly shimmering purple rim around your pupils. You found that you could turn it on and off if you focused on doing so.<br />
<br />
Going back to the counter, the woman smiles at you, but didn&#39;t open her eyes. &quot;A wonderful selection, but could you please disable them for now. While I am immune to their functions, it still gives me a bit of a headache.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry&quot; you say after turning them off. &quot;No worries, also, you don&#39;t need eye contact, its just that having proper eye contact comes with being a store clerk is all. And having direct eye contact only makes the process faster is all. That will be $350.00 miss.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was the first time being addressed as a woman, so you were a bit taken aback at first, but then you started getting aroused at the thought of being seen as one. These earrings would be able to make that a reality easy enough. Now you were excited to get back home and make your sister think you are her sister now, and maybe some other things. <br />
<br />
As you were about to leave, the clerk calls out for you. &quot;Oh wait a sec. If you give me another $50.00, I can upgrade your body part swapper remote to include a replicator function as well.&quot; You quickly hand over the cash, and she pokes your hand with her finger tip. A green light flashes and that was apparently all there was to it. &quot;There you go. Thank you for comming again. My name is Karii, and either myself, or my husband durring the day, will always be here if you need one of us for help, or something new. We both hope to see you again. Now please, go and enjoy your purchases.&quot; Karii said as she saw you out. You thanked her one more time and headed back home.</p>
