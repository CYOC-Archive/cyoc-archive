<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You where floating…. that is what you knew at first, you didn’t even feel wet…the change had made it feel like you where floating in air when you where really in water. As the drugs began to wear off you noticed first the pain, everything hurt…. not a bad hurt, it reminded you more of waking up the Saturday morning after a hard football game when you where in high school. Everything just hurt, your arms, your head, your body, and your legs.<br />
<br />
Wait…you only feel one of your legs and it is different then before. <br />
<br />
Slowly as your body shook off the effects of the drug, you opened your eyes. It was strange, you were looking through water but it didn’t hurt your eyes and you could see far better then you should have.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck.” You say, hearing your voice as you began to look around. There seamed to be a glass wall between you and whatever was outside. Your eyes took longer to focus then it should be you noticed a large glass cylinder across from you and floating in there, was a figure….it looked human but different with multiple limbs coming out of her legs forming what looked like an octopus bottom. That is when you remembered.<br />
<br />
You remembered the going to the merperson convention with your girlfriend, then going to that booth where you build your own merperson. You and Katie had switch avatar’s you had designed hers and she had designed yours. Then when you expected to get a 3D model of the avatar…you were trapped and drugged.<br />
<br />
Then what…<br />
<br />
You turn your head to the right…and saw Katie…well it looked like Katie, only her hair was now longer much longer with silver and some blue mixed in. Her bust was bigger, her waist thinner and she was a mermaid, the same mermaid Avatar you had made. She was waking up as well, her new blue eyes looking at you.<br />
<br />
“CHRIS!?” she yelled, it was hard to hear her but you did. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t some kind of dream…that was Katie and she was a mermaid. You look down, finally noticing that you were fully in water. Your body had changed, you looked a lot stronger with tone muscles across your chest and your arms. The biggest change however was from the waist down, two fins came out of your hip area, before going into a shark like black fin with some green spots. <br />
<br />
“What the Fuck?” you say touching the nearest fin and feeling pain when you pinch it. <br />
<br />
“CHRIS!” yelled Katie again as she began to pound on the glass…turning your attention to her you moved to the two sets of glass which separated you from her.<br />
<br />
“Katie…what is happening?” inquired Chris<br />
<br />
“I was hoping you would tell me, this has to be some kind of…” Started Katie as suddenly there was a grinding mechanical sound followed by a vacuum sound. Below you on what would have been the floor of your prison, a hidden door opened and the water along with you where being pulled down. <br />
<br />
In her own chamber, the same thing was happening to Katie. It was a powerful pull and you tried to fight it but in the end, you where pulled down into a second tube, this one not made of glass. Finally with a burst of speed you were ejected out into some kind of tank as the door behind you was sealed. This one much larger about the 20 feet down was the floor and it was maybe 80 feet long and you where not alone there where other mermaids and merman and everyone was confused and asking questions.<br />
<br />
“CHRIS!” yelled Katie as she flung herself into your arms, wrapping her arms around your neck as she pulled herself close. <br />
<br />
“What is going on?” you inquire as you look at her new silver hair and blue eyes. She had always been beautiful to you but now she was breathtaking beautiful. “Last I remember was…”<br />
<br />
Before she could say anything more suddenly the fronts and side of the of the container began to glow as the image of Mr. Davenport appeared. Once again he was behind his desk, the old man was the richest man in the world and the one who had taken you, your girlfriend and everyone else in this room.<br />
<br />
“Hello and welcome, I know you are confused and wondering what is happening.” Started the recording as more mechanical sounds filled the water as you felt yourself moving downwards. “I will start at the beginning, twenty years ago some researchers under my employ discovered that the Earth is howled with a massive warm ocean full of life with a few small islands on the surface. The core of the Earth is actually a small mini sun which provide 24-hour light and warmth. At the same time I knew that humanity would never change, that we where marching toward our own destruction. So a plan was born.”<br />
<br />
“A plan to turn us into freaks!” cursed a nearby mermaid<br />
<br />
“So using advance nano machines and DNA manipulation my team found a way to transform humans into mermaids and merman. We knew we wouldn’t get enough volunteers and announcing our discovery of the howled Earth ocean would invite destruction on this watery garden of Eden. So to save humanity from doom, I had to commit a horrible sin.” Explained Mr. Davenport “I arrange to kidnap around 1 million people from around the world and to transport them in multiple waves to the entrees to my new Eden. You are among them.”<br />
<br />
“Right now you are on a mini submarine, one of many who have left one of my many transformation ships. You are currently dropping down toward the a hidden entrance to the in world sea in the Marianas Trench.” Announced Mr. Davenport “That is the deepest point on our planet, there you will pass through a tunnel to your new home. Please do not attempt to escape, the pressure outside would kill even your new merpeople body. Once you are through the tunnel and enter the inland sea the pressure will lessen and you will be the new Adams and Eves for humanity in the center of the world. With the massive amounts of rocks and pressure keeping you and the generations of future merpeople you bring into this world safe from all harm.”<br />
<br />
You pulled Katie close watching the screen as you felt the submarine go down deeper and deeper. Mr. Davenport seamed to tear up a bit, yet you felt no emotion for this old man.<br />
<br />
“I know I will not be forgiven for taking you away from your homes, loved ones and your very lives on the surface but I had to do so for the good of humanity.” Announced Mr. Davenport “Be it, overcrowding, pollution, global warming or something else we on the surface are doomed. You all will be safe, keeping a small but different version of humanity alive. Thank you and once again I am sorry.”<br />
<br />
With that the screens went black replaced with a timer….10 hours until you reached the end of this journey. </p>
