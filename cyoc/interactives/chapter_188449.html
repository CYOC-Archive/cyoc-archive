<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the first few weeks of living together you were fairly certain you never saw Dr. Lilith in anything but professional pants and an extremely baggy lab coat. At first you weren&#39;t sure if she was just trying to keep everything about your strange new relationship entirely professional or if she just didn&#39;t own any other clothes, but eventually you got some sense that she was also just shy in the early getting to know you stages. For another instance, while she insisted that she needed to log your eating habits on a chart you had to fill out each meal she refused to watch you eat, didn&#39;t want you to watch her eat, and generally seemed nervous to share meals with you. Even if you tried to keep your feeding entirely below the table, it was still very weird even to you and you weren&#39;t entirely surprised Dr. Lilith didn&#39;t want to be around it directly, especially at first. Even if it was just your mouth now, your beak was between your legs, and still seemed like a very private part.<br />
<br />
Somewhere between eating enough and the hormone supplements your breasts started to very quickly grow out. Dr. Lilith started teasing you that you needed proper bras. As that teasing moved from feeling embarrassing to you to the point where eventually after you started agreeing that you needed to go shopping it started to sound a lot more like flirting to you. That seemed to be even clearer when you realized that Dr. Lillith had started planning your shopping trip almost like a date. When she got out of the shower to take you clothes shopping she was wearing a much more casual pair of jeans and a tank top. Without the lab coat obscuring her form, Dr. Lilith was extremely pretty with surprisingly larger boobs than you would have imagined smuggled inside her lab coat. Seeing her bare arms for the first time you were surprised by how toned and defined her muscles were, her biceps those of an amateur weightlifter or boxer, which was also not what you would have expected inside her lab coats. You hoped it wasn&#39;t as obvious as it felt like how much you were drooling out of your &quot;mouth&quot; in arousal at the sight of the real, casual Dr. Lilith. You were surprised how much your once straight, male libido seemed in tact, as Dr. Lilith was a beautiful woman to you and would have been before your changes, too.<br />
<br />
At some point between helping you find bras in your new size and convincing you to try on a few skirts and dresses she thought you&#39;d look good in she asked you to call her &quot;just Lilith&quot; rather than Dr. Lilith every time.<br />
<br />
You quickly grew used to wearing skirts around the house as it made access to feeding your beak much easier. Lilith started wearing more casual clothes like the jeans and tank top combo, though still insisting on wearing the lab coat on &quot;important observation days&quot;.<br />
<br />
A few weeks after the shopping trip you&#39;d slipped into calling her Lili and not only didn&#39;t she mind, she seemed to enjoy it. She&#39;d gotten more comfortable wearing pajamas around you in the evenings and one night while both of you were in your pajamas watching tv Lili asked you if she could kiss you. That kiss was the most orgasmic you&#39;d ever had in your life.<br />
<br />
Kissing Lili eventually became a regular thing. Soon it escalated to second base and the two of you would also play with each other&#39;s breasts while making out. It stayed at second base for weeks.<br />
<br />
The first time you laid eggs was startling. At first you thought that you needed to vomit out your poop like you usually did, but the feeling of it from start to finish was far more pleasurable. You stared at the sac of eggs for a while before flushing it. You had to bring it up to Lili as she was still observing you, and you mentioned confusion at laying eggs as the surgeon had told you to expect a human-like period. Lili shook her head, &quot;That idiot clearly has no idea about squid biology and if you&#39;d asked me or Dr. Abe we&#39;d have cleared up that confusion quickly. Squids don&#39;t have periods, squids lay eggs. If your body was to experience a human-like periodic need to purge eggs, you&#39;d just lay a bunch of unfertilized eggs. I&#39;d like you to keep track for me roughly how many eggs you lay and how often, for the observational science of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eventually, you realized that just because your beak wasn&#39;t very sexual or much use as a third base, you could still try to help Lili get off for how amazing she made you feel. While making you took a hand of her breasts and moved it to her crotch only to discover something hard and newly familiar between her legs: it felt like she had a beak too. You broke the kiss in shock, despite knowing how close you were to another orgasm.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t know what to say, but Lili could read most of it in the shock on your face and she tried to explain, &quot;It&#39;s okay. Yes, I&#39;m also like you,  a squid-human. Your idiot surgeon was wrong, you weren&#39;t the world&#39;s first. The program was my idea and as a bit of a mad scientist I made sure that I was on the first list of volunteers. I and several others helped work out some of the early kinks, including making sure that any idiot surgeon could do it with little to no additional training. It was worth it to save a life like yours.&quot; She gently put a hand on your knee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me sooner?&quot; Some of the pieces were starting to fall into place: the embarrassment at eating with you was just as much to hide that she&#39;d be eating with her beak, too. She still hadn&#39;t tried wearing skirts or dresses around the house much as that might have given you too easy a peek at her beak.<br />
<br />
She looked away from you in shame, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I guess I wanted to take advantage of you and that seemed the easiest way. I&#39;m sorry I took advantage of you. I was mostly just thinking with my squid penis. I know that is an awful, horrible excuse, and I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
It took a few minutes to sink in what she had just said. Your kisses had been so orgasmic because that was your squid pussy, you realized like an idiot should have been obviously remembered by you weeks earlier. If Lili was laid out similarly to you, with the beak between her legs, then likely her human looking tongue was not so human and doubled as her squid penis. In coyly asking to kiss you, Lili had jumped straight to squid sex. Unsafe, unprotected squid sex. You think back to all the eggs that you have laid and realize most or all of them may have been fertilized.</p>
