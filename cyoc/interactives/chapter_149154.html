<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jace woke the next morning, a wide grin on his face as he rubbed the sleep from his eyes. He had the best dream last night, that arrogant cunt Jared who had tormented him reduced to nothing but the thick meat between his legs.<br />
<br />
Strangely, despite being straight, his Jared cock had bombarded him with thoughts and memories of being in Kaiden&#39;s ass, causing him to charge into his frat bro&#39;s room and then fuck him senseless int the night.<br />
<br />
Jace felt himself twitching hard again as he remembered the dream in vivid detail.<br />
<br />
He had woken to find Kaiden&#39;s hand reaching up his shorts, the shy young man disappearing up the stairs, face flushed red with embarrassment, without a single word of explanation.<br />
Initially Jace had thought he had been part of some elaborate prank by the Alphas, using some guys with an average size cock to humiliate him and his brothers further. <br />
He had risen up, chasing Kaiden halfway up the stairs before realizing something was different.<br />
There was a strange new weight between his legs, and his thoughts were clouded.<br />
<br />
Jace had peered down his shorts on the stairs. &quot;What the fuck!&quot; He had blurted out before hurriedly checking he was alone and hiding himself in the bathroom.<br />
Locking the door he stared at himself in the mirror as he slowly lowered his shorts, his new 8&quot; length slowly swinging free.<br />
&quot;Jesus!&quot; Jace cackled as he examined his new endowment. <br />
His old shaft had been barely a nub when soft, more head than dick, but his new dick hung longer then his old flaccid dick. Wrapping his fist around it he knew it was nearly twice as thick, and gently lifting the shaft up, his larger, hairier balls dangled about an inch lower then he was familiar with.<br />
<br />
Familiar.<br />
Jace stared at this cock, his hand slowly feeling along the long shaft, feeling it pump up with blood to its full 8 inch length. The shaft was slightly thicker at the head end then the base, the mushroom head flaring just slightly, a single thick vein running along the top of the shaft.<br />
This cock was familiar.<br />
Turning his fist around to grasp the throbbing meat he knew where he had seen it.<br />
From a very different angle, as he stared up in tears and rage as Jared ravaged his throat, his threats of further humiliation, property destruction, and even getting Jace flunked out of his course, flooding his mind.<br />
<br />
His anger caused him to squeeze his fist tighter as the dick throbbed, pre leaking from the tip, as strange images and sensations whispering in the back of his mind. <br />
Now Jace could see some of Jared memories. <br />
Of how powerful he felt forcing his cock down Jace&#39;s straight throat. How he got hard seeing other men dominated and humiliated, their lives destroyed. <br />
Images of how him and another frat brother were planning on stealing his car in a week and setting it on fire.<br />
Focusing on the thoughts, Jace&#39;s fist started stroking faster, his mind feeling the new heightened sensation of the much heavier cock in his hand, slicked up with his pre cum.<br />
He could almost hear Jared, his mind somehow in his dick, stolen from him, half formed sentences jumping from begging to be returned to human form, for mercy and forgiveness, of regret and fear, shifting to the strange fascination of his entire form being flooded withn pleasure every time he came. How he was losing himself, how he had lost parts of himself to the new pledges mouth, hands and ass.<br />
That incredibly tight, warm ass.<br />
<br />
Jace was getting close, his Jared dick ready to blow again, although he could feel the hard meat fighting it. Slowly losing at the memory of cumming in Kaiden&#39;s ass that Jared was reliving, was also shared with Jace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck I gotta get a piece of that.&quot; Jace found himself saying as he discarded his shirt, kicked off his shorts and walked with confident purpose down to Kaiden&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
Jace&#39;s dream had been filled with the memory of him fucking Jared&#39;s mind apart, sliding his dick into Kaiden&#39;s hole, and finding it fit perfectly. Of pounding Kaiden so hard that his toes were curling as he shot load after load inside him. The perverse feeling of using Jared&#39;s own cum as lubricant to his own downfall making Jace even harder.<br />
<br />
Five loads. He remembered Kaiden saying that 5 loads and Jared would be his dick forever.<br />
However it had only really taken two. The second load causing the strange conflicted thoughts to stop bombarding his subconscious, and for Jace to settle in and really enjoy fucking Kaiden&#39;s eager hole.<br />
<br />
He remembered at that point flipping Kaiden over, marveling at how deep his meat would slide before his hips caused his muscular ass to compress, altering his pace and angle until he had figured out how to fuck Kaiden&#39;s prostate directly. His anal orgasms causing his ass to twitch and spasm around the former Jared cock, milking Jace to his third laod which he sprayed across Kaiden&#39;s back and ass before resting his weight fully down on. His hot breath in Kaiden&#39;s ear as he fucked his last two loads directly down on Kaiden&#39;s prostate, leaving him babbling in a pool of his own cum before Jace had stumbled back to his own bed.<br />
<br />
Snapping his eyes awake, JAce stared down at his hand, slowly stroking his rock hard 8 inch cock, which was now slick from all the pre spread from his languid strokes. Grinning widely, he accepted that it hadn&#39;t been a dream, and that the cruel bastard Jared, was now his big cock for life.<br />
<br />
Slipping on his short, Jace wandered to the bathroom, a new confidence in his stride and a new sparkle in his eye as he opened the door and started to piss.<br />
He could hear the shower running, but the third floor rule was that the bathroom doors were only to be locked when privacy was really needed. With over 20 guys sharing 3 bathrooms, it was an necessity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning mate.&quot; Jace called out as he flushed.<br />
&quot;Oh, uh Morning Jace.&quot; Kaiden&#39;s voice called out from behind the curtain.<br />
Jace stopped in his tracks, blood flooding to his cock as hungry thoughts filled his head.<br />
Jace, while formerly straight, was more then willing to accept being gay, provided he got to be in control. A lifetime of being ridiculed and denied by women for his small size being over ridden by his cocks desire for more of the muscular ass behind the curtain.<br />
If being gay meant fucking nice tight holes and making people cum hands free, all while you focused primarily on your own pleasure, then he was all for it.<br />
<br />
Quickly locking the door, Jace dropped his shorts, stepping up to the curtain.<br />
&quot;That you Kaiden?&quot; He asked, already knowing the answer.<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah Jace. What&#39;s up?&quot;The shy man stammered, his last word going quiet as Jace slipped behind the curtain, staring into his eyes before drawing him into a deep kiss, their tongues  writhing against each other.<br />
Kaiden moaned as Jace pulled his hips close, mashing their hard cocks together, his hands roaming over Jace&#39;s muscular chest, before he felt the strong hands guiding him down to his knees.<br />
<br />
Kaiden looked up, looking briefly up at Jace, seeing his dark eyes with a hungry spark in them. His tongue licking his top lips seductively as he gently dragged his leaking dick across Kaiden&#39;s lips.<br />
Looking back down at the hard dick in front of him, Kaiden opened his mouth, diving down as far his mouth would let him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck Mate! You got a fucking nice mouth on ya, And I just gotta get another go at that ass of yours.&quot; Jace chuckled as Kaiden smiled around his cocked, nodding slightly before Jace took control of the pace, slowly fucking Kaiden&#39;s throat. <br />
<br />
Today was already the best day he could ever remember, and he was just getting started.</p>
