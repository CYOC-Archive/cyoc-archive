<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So Mark found himself following “Jennifer” who of course was actually Anna. “Jennifer” had not bothered to put on a robe, she just walked ahead of Mark in her bikini. Mark was relieved to feel turned on by the sight of “Jennifer’s” scantily clad bum as it wobbled deliciously in front of her. It was nice to have familiar male urges even if Mark currently didn’t have the apparatus to act on them. The real Jennifer was a very good looking girl with a wonderful figure. Anna now had that gorgeous body.<br />
 <br />
Anna took Mark to the room she shared with Abby and Kate. Kate wasn’t there. Once Mark was inside Anna shut and locked the door.<br />
‘Is this your room? It’s much better than where I am’ said Mark<br />
 <br />
‘Yeah, I got lucky. Don’t worry I’ve spent many summers up in the old dormitory. I know what it’s like. I think the plan is to build more of these and phase out where you are. I guess it just takes time and money’<br />
<br />
‘Anna, I’m not enjoying this. You heard them at the assembly. They expect me to sing. I can’t do that’<br />
<br />
‘Of course you can. You have my old voice. You would just need to learn the words. However let’s not discuss that now. I’ve been feeling horny all day and I finally have you alone’<br />
<br />
With that Anna flung her arms around Mark and gave her a big passionate kiss. Mark could feel his breasts rubbing against Anna’s. That felt strange. Also different was that Anna was now slightly taller than him. Instead of angling his face down as he kissed her Mark had to look up slightly. Mark knew Anna was 5’7. It seemed “Jennifer” was about 5’9.<br />
 <br />
Like all males at the school Mark had secretly lusted after Jennifer. Now she finally had the chance to act on those urges. She returned Anna’s kiss with equal enthusiasm. Mark’s hands were soon feeling Anna’s curves.<br />
<br />
‘Mm I see you are liking this’ said Anna as they came out to breath. ‘I think I need to give you a lesson as to what feels nice for a girl. I know what your body likes’<br />
<br />
‘Yes please’ said the heavy breathing Mark<br />
<br />
Mark had the new sensation of feeling moist in her groin. She was also aware of how her nipples had enlarged. Mark allowed Anna to pull off her t-shirt and cup Mark’s breasts. ‘Nice breasts even if I say so myself’. Anna was very gentle and she knew she had Mark at her mercy. Soon she had the bra off as well and Mark enjoyed the sensation of Anna’s tongue caressing her nipples. <br />
<br />
Somehow Anna had made Mark sit on one of the beds. Anna straddled Mark and made him lie down. Anna’s hands found and undid the belt and with Mark’s assistance removed her jeans. Mark was now naked but for the lacy light blue panties. Anna gently touched Mark’s panties. ‘I see you are wet’<br />
<br />
All Mark could do in reply was whimper.<br />
<br />
Anna was very gentle. She kept Mark’s panties on but somehow located Mark’s clitoris through the material. She gently stimulated Mark until she felt on the brink. ‘So what was it you wanted to tell me so urgently?’ Anna asked as she continued to stimulate Mark.<br />
<br />
‘Uh, keep going, but we need to swap, uh uh, I can’t do the musical theatre and singing you had down as your preferences. No don’t stop’<br />
<br />
‘But there’s a problem. Promise you won’t get mad at me?’<br />
<br />
‘Just keep going. I won’t get mad’<br />
<br />
‘Promise?’<br />
<br />
‘Yes I promise! Keep going! You have got me so close’<br />
<br />
Anna’s fingers finally pulled Mark’s soaked panties off then found their way into her vagina. ‘I didn’t realise how nice I smelled’ she said as she gave Mark another kiss. While this was happening Mark found and pulled Anna’s bikini string. Anna was now topless as well. &quot;Don&#39;t you think its interesting how Jennifer’s areolas are brown while mine are so pink yet we have pretty much the same skin tone’ said Anna.<br />
<br />
‘Ah?’ said Mark.<br />
<br />
‘The coloured bit around your nipples. Don’t you think it’s interesting?’<br />
<br />
‘Just finish me please don’t leave me this way?’<br />
<br />
‘But you often don’t get me all the way’<br />
<br />
‘Point taken. How about you finish me off then I can reciprocate’<br />
<br />
‘You know how I said I had a problem?’<br />
<br />
‘Is it important?’<br />
<br />
‘Not really. But I probably should tell you’<br />
<br />
‘Well do so then finish me off’<br />
<br />
‘I left the medallion at home. We can’t swap back’<br />
<br />
‘What!’<br />
<br />
‘I’m sorry but you will have to be Anna until camp finishes’<br />
<br />
Mark somehow found the strength to push Anna off. ‘That can’t be. Didn’t you pack it? I saw you put it in your handbag’<br />
<br />
‘I did but then I thought better of it. I didn’t want Mum or Dad to find it and decided to hide it under Christine’s mattress. Then in the rush in the morning forgot to take it out’<br />
<br />
‘Shit!’<br />
<br />
‘You promised you wouldn’t get mad at me’ <br />
<br />
‘Errgh! How could you be so stupid?’<br />
<br />
‘You promised. Besides it’s not bad being me. I’ll help you. It’s only 6 weeks’<br />
<br />
‘6 weeks! I thought I only signed on for 3 weeks!’<br />
<br />
‘Shush, these walls are thin. Jennifer only signed on for three weeks. Anna is signed on for the entire summer. And you’re now Anna’<br />
<br />
‘Can’t we somehow go home? I can pretend to get sick. We must go back and get the medallion. Could your Mum get it and post it up to us?’<br />
<br />
‘What am I meant to say “Hi Mum can you get a crappy piece of jewellery from under Christine’s mattress and send it to me. But make sure you don’t touch it” besides you would have to ask her. You’re Anna now remember’<br />
<br />
‘You don’t need to remind me’<br />
<br />
‘We should remember to call each other by our new names, even in private. You never know who may overhear us. So lie down Anna and I will finish what I started’<br />
<br />
‘Don’t bother the mood has been killed’. The former Mark said. She picked up the blue panties and despite them still being wet slid them up her legs and proceeded to get dressed.<br />
<br />
The new Jennifer lay on the bed and tried to look seductive, however she soon realised “Anna” was not going to respond. As “Anna” pulled the t-shirt back over her head “Jennifer” said ‘I really am sorry. I didn’t mean this. I will help you as much as I can. We can still have fun’<br />
<br />
‘I’m sure you will have lots of fun, here in your luxury resort while I’m up in the log cabin looking after 20 little girls. Thanks a lot Jennifer!’ With that Mark stormed out slamming the door behind herself. She bumped into Anna’s Asian friend out in the corridor with another girl. They looked like they might have been listening. Mark hoped not.<br />
<br />
‘Anna? Is everything alright?’ asked the Asian girl. What was her name? Mark tried to recall. Abby?<br />
<br />
‘No. Everything is not alright. But I don’t want to talk about it’ Mark left the building and trudged back to her own dormitory. She found she had tears in her eyes.</p>
