<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Chris, would you STOP staring at me!  This is embarrassing enough as it is&quot; yelled Don to his friend who continued to gaze at him, slack-jawed.  &quot;I'm...I'm sorry, Don,&quot; Chris replied, &quot;But you're just so FUCKING hot!&quot; He blurted the words out without thinking.  The part of his mind that normally would have edited that kind of comment wasn't in control.  The site of Don’s growing, naked body had overridden years of social conditioning.  He was more turned on than he’d ever been and he didn’t care who knew it.  His girlfriend had just been a convenient smokescreen, he knew that now.  He wanted Don more than he’d wanted anything in his life.  He’d crossed a line that he didn’t want to cross back over, ever.<br />
<br />
Don’s voice was edged with panic, “Chris, look…I know you’re freaking out right now, but I need you to hold it together.  We have GOT to figure out what to do here.  If I keep growing, I’m gonna bust right through your room, then maybe the whole building.  Fucksake!  What the hell am I gonna do?!”  His earlier excitement at getting bigger was replaced with the growing fear that he could be squeezed to death in this room, and possibly hurt a lot of other people if his expanding body brought down the whole building.  He hoped that he’d stop growing before that happened, but there was no way to tell what was coming next.  “Chris, look at me!”  “I am”, Chris responded, his voice sounding dazed.  And it was true, he was looking.  He took in details of Don’s body that were either too small to be seen when his friend had shrunk, or which he’d averted his eyes from as Don grew back in order not to make his observations obvious.  Now, he let him self see the arch of Don’s feet and the fact that his toes were long and perfectly proportioned.  He let his eyes wander up the muscled calves and their light covering of hair, joined by the knees to thighs that were defined from years of athletics.  He lingered on Don’s crotch, covered only partially by his hands, hints or a large dick that he swore was partly hard could be seen between the long fingers.  The side of his glutes that was visible was indented, a sign that Don’s ass was as well-muscled as the rest of him.  The rest of his observations were cut off by the sound of Don’s voice again.  “No, I mean look at ME, in my eyes, dammit!”<br />
<br />
Don had a pretty good idea of what was going on in his friend’s mind, but he had to deal with one thing at a time.  Under the circumstances, he thought he was doing a good job of maintaining his composure, but he could feel real panic nipping at his control.  Chris finally looked up and met his eyes. “Ok, I have to get someplace that’s open but private.  I can’t let anyone else see me like this!  Now where can I go?”  His mind was running a mile a minute trying to come up with a solution.  He was torn between his desperate desire to get out of the room and the fear of running around 10-feet tall and bare-ass naked.  He was developing a cramp in his back from bending under the lowering ceiling and with a light thump from his ass as it hit the ground, he sat down on the floor next to the front door, his back against the wall and his lengthening legs bent.  He still cupped his package, but he had to spread his legs slightly to allow room for his hands between his thighs.  He looked at Chris with consternation.  He could feel his butt expanding against the floor and his back sliding up the wall.<br />
<br />
Chris, for his part, was snapping out of his daze and coming to terms with some major issues very rapidly.  He put aside his growing lust and saw his friend, finally, with a clearer mind.  This was Don, his best bud of two years, and he needed his help.<br />
<br />
“Ok, Don, I’m sorry.  This is all just…well, a lot to take in.  But I have an idea.”  He paused and smiled before uttering the clich&eacute;, “And it’s just crazy enough to work!”  He approached his friend, stepping between his oversized feet.  “But first, Don, there’s something I HAVE to do, if you’ll let me.  I’ll help you no matter what, but I really, REALLY want to do this.”  And with that, Chris slowly stepped forward, his upper thighs brushing up against Don’s knees.  Don simply stared at Chris, not quite sure what to expect of him, though he was starting to get an idea of what his friend wanted.  Chris took another step, his shins bumping up against Don’s cupped hands.  Chris was breathing heavily now, sweat beading on his forehead, his chest, partly visible under his open collar, was beat red.  He only had to look down slightly to meet Don’s eyes and, in his peripheral vision, he saw the top of Don’s brown-haired head slowly inching its way up the white-painted  wall.  Chris bent forward and slowly, tentatively, brought his arms up and placed a hand to either side of Don’s head, curling his fingers into the hair he found there.  He bent closer, tilted his head slightly to the side, and gently pushed his lips against Don’s, closing his eyes as he did so.<br />
<br />
Don’s eyes were open, his lips unmoving.  For a moment, he forgot his growing predicament as this new situation took his attention.  There was just too much happening at once to process, so he focused on the presence of Chris’ lips on his own and came to a decision.</p>
