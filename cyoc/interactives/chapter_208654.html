<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Then let&#39;s get to work. This very evening, I wish for my girlfriend&#39;s new boyfriend Thomas to ...&quot;<br />
Damon thought about his wish carefully.<br />
 &quot;I wish for my girlfriend&#39;s new boyfriend Thomas to become a baby doll. A baby ragdoll. I will offer it to Monica and she&#39;ll find him irresistible. She&#39;ll want to treat it as her own baby and me as the father. She&#39;ll love it so much she will want to stay with me just for it. But when Thomas and me will be alone, Thomas will be allowed to move and speak again. But only when we&#39;re completely alone. Otherwise, I&#39;ll be able to read his mind as he&#39;ll stay conscious. I want to make sure I can hear his despair as I torture him,&quot; he grinned evilly.<br />
Damon then added a few things.<br />
&quot;Also, I&#39;ll need a wallet that never empties of wads of bills so as to buy things for Thomas as a baby ragdoll. That&#39;ll keep Monica happy.&quot;<br />
&quot;It shall be done, master,&quot; said the genie. &quot;Do you have any requirements as to the details regarding Thomas&#39; new body?&quot;<br />
Damon thought long and hard.<br />
&quot;Well, water-proof enough so he can stay in a bathtub. With me and Monica. You can keep him male. Let&#39;s not be too cruel.&quot;<br />
He grinned. Oh, how THAT would make that stupid Thomas jealous! Also, he had a few evil ideas for reasons to keep his worst enemy male, even as a ragdoll.<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; said the genie. &quot;Wish granted. By 7 p.m. this evening, Thomas will appear in your room and you can watch him transform. The magical wallet will appear then as well.&quot;<br />
&quot;Awesome!&quot; Damon exclaimed. <br />
His parents were out of town for a few days and frankly, he could not wait for the clock to chime seven.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, at seven p.m., as Damon was waiting in his room, light appeared and Thomas was there, in the middle of his bedroom. He looked around him, completely bewildered.<br />
&quot;Damon? What... How?&quot;<br />
&quot;Magic,&quot; smirked Damon. &quot;And you haven&#39;t seen the last of it.&quot;<br />
For emphasis, he snapped his fingers and Thomas felt himself shrinking and the very fabric of his body being altered. His bones became non-existent, more fat seem to creep on his limbs and his hair grow longer. When he recovered, the room he was in looked utterly out of proportion, and he crashed on his butt, feeling no pain but as if he had some sort of full cloth diaper on. He looked at himself. His arms, legs, fingers and toes were moving, living plastic but his body was soft and full of fabric, made out of tissue. His hair were fine and blond and... and made of plastic. He still had genitals but tiny ones, not even half the sizer of an acorn and of course made of tissue. Of course he couldn&#39;t help it, he screamed.<br />
&quot;What... What have you done to me?!?!&quot;<br />
&quot;A genie granted my wish of seeing you punished. You&#39;re a ragdoll now. Monica won&#39;t help but find you irresistible. Though you&#39;ll only be able to move and speak with me only.&quot;<br />
Thomas was astonished but more than that terrified. Damon could read it in his mind and he was overjoyed. What a sweet vengeance. <br />
&quot;No!&quot; Thomas screamed. <br />
Damon picked him up under the arms and strolled to the mirror. In the reflection, Thomas could see an adorable ragdoll with the cutest pout and light blue eyes toped by marvellously long eyelashes.<br />
&quot;Aw, aren&#39;t you just the cutest? I&#39;m sure Monica will love taking care of you!&quot;<br />
Thomas kicked, squirmed and cussed.<br />
&quot;Such a rude language from a little angel like you,&quot; admonished Damon softly. &quot;I would prefer a happy baby.&quot;<br />
He tickled Thomas under the armpits and the ragdoll could not help but erupt in shrieks, squirms and peals of laughter. Damon deposited him gently on the floor and proceeded to tickle him more, on the belly, pinching his ragdoll butt cheeks, his toes, under his chin and punctuating tickle torture with &#39;coochy coochy coos&#39;. When Thomas was nothing more than a twitching and sobbing mess, Damon put him under a cardboard box upon which he placed heavy books for weight and said that he needed to make a few errands to make Thomas comfortable.<br />
<br />
After Damon returned, Thomas had been pushing against the sides of the boxes, grunting and attempting to get out, but to no avail. Damon set down his bags, dug through them and removed the box, grabbing a furious Thomas.<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t do this!&quot; he screamed.<br />
&quot;Watch me,&quot; smirked Damon.<br />
He then set the live ragdoll on his bed, slipping doll clothes on him. Soon Thomas had a diaper, bib, frilly bonnet, tiny boots and had a pacifier stuck in his mouth and tied behind his head. He was dressed as a stereotypical baby, and it infuriated him to the last degree. Damon, for one, found it all hilarious.<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you the most adorable baby? Wait till Monica sees you!&quot;<br />
Thomas had no choice but flail his feeble baby-like limbs around until Damon placed him in a doll crib and he fell asleep, hypnotized by the smiling cutesy star mobile above him.<br />
<br />
Monica couldn’t believe it! Damon had brought her a real godsend! She had been devastated by Thomas going missing, especially as no lead had been uncovered by the police. And now her ex Damon came with a present which brightened her day completely! The most adorable ragdoll! She hugged the toy, thanking Damon profusely. Damon had even bought baby doll accessories to go with the cute little thing and frankly, she couldn’t wait to set all those in her room! She kissed Damon passionately, and apologised for breaking up with him. They both had sex while the doll rested in its baby carrier and afterwards they bought everything they could to look after the little darling. Damon, kind as ever, paid for everything. Afterwards, as the baby was in a pram with a bottle, they had coffee and dinner. A perfect date like two model and dutiful parents! Damon even helped her carrying bags and setting up a playpen like a real father. What an idiot she had been to break up with him! <br />
<br />
As for Damon, he was overjoyed as well. Everything had played out the way he wanted and exactly too. He could hear the thoughts of Thomas and he was utterly humiliated, enraged and fuming. Monica had kept the name Thomas so as to remember the poor missing teenager. Damon had heartily agreed, knowing Thomas the ragdoll would hate just as much. Indeed, people around thought the ragdoll was a real, albeit quiet, infant. Monica adored him and thought he was the best boyfriend ever for indulging in her make-believe. Damon assumed that in a few years, he&#39;d call the genie again to free Thomas or impose another, less cruel fate upon him. He was happy to see him used as a baby doll for now. <br />
<br />
For Thomas, life was miserable. From the start, he had hated his new state. Being squashed against Monica&#39;s breasts as she kissed lovingly her ex was bad enough. To see them make up and especially make out, culminating with sex while he was in the same room had been torture. And THAT was just the beginning. Monica loved to coo and tickle him, egged on shamelessly by Damon who always had an evil glint in his eye when he looked at Thomas. With his great wealth of bills, he could spoil her endlessly and offer more sources of humiliation for Thomas. She gushed at his rumba panties, patterned pyjamas and as she tickled him, he was incapable of squirming away and had to endure the torture. He also had to fall asleep while being rocked with a lullaby in his ears. While his family was looking for him, he was stuck as the make-believe baby of Damon and Monica! No one would ever find him now! His only solution was Damon&#39;s genie! If only he could grab that damn lamp... But it was kept at Damon&#39;s house and he was stuck at Monica&#39;s home. If only he could seize it at some point, when Monica brought him over... In the meantime, even if he had Monica for himself and seeing her naked, he was subjected to pretend diaper changes, a bottle forced into his mouth and plastic food forced into him, all with coos and silly sounds. She patted, poked and tickled his belly afterwards, gushing at his healthy appetite and pudgy tummy, leaving Thomas to suffer through anther yet tickling torture. His only hope was for Damon to change his mind or finding and grabbing the magic lamp when Damon would leave him alone in his bedroom. Even with a weak body like his, although the second option would be his favorite. He could then take a well-deserved revenge. But how long would it take for either to happen?</p>
