<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The man who was once Luke very readily found himself thinking of himself AS Daniel, and even though he was trying his hardest to keep his concept of himself as &quot;Luke&quot;, the feeling of being Daniel was just too overwhelming. The memories didn&#39;t help. He could find himself fully accessing Daniel&#39;s memories while his own memories of his own life slowly faded away. He took out his - Daniel&#39;s - phone and tapped out a message to himself, &quot;Body Swap makes identity changes happen&quot;. He was satisfied with that, and decided to take it as a note for future endeavors.<br />
<br />
With that, he found himself lapsing more and more into Daniel&#39;s habits and personality with his own Body Bracelet hanging around even still. He considered what he knew from the memories. Daniel was a bit of a freewheeling type that seemed to have quite a history of lovers - especially as he reached age 18 and started his role with his father&#39;s company. Much the same way Wilkins enjoyed testing the waters in his bisexuality, Daniel seemed to enjoy pushing the limits.<br />
<br />
He had a string of former girlfriends, and then just as many former boyfriends once he came into his own as &quot;gay&quot; at least as he identified. But identity with Daniel was not quite absolute. Even though he primarily identified as gay, he, from time to time, when a pretty enough woman came along he&#39;d try it out again. Just to experience it - and even then he frequently employed some rather saucy sex talk into his outings.<br />
<br />
His first boyfriend had been the team&#39;s half-back, himself a tall, muscular bisexual with long blond hair done up in a manbun. Nate was astonishingly muscular, and in fact Daniel still had his phone number. Even though Nate graduated and their relationship stopped with his move away to pursue a collegiate degree, Daniel still remembered the inspiration he got from Nate. Maybe it&#39;d be good to see how Nate&#39;s doing these days. Check in and see if he was still that muscular.<br />
<br />
He and his father&#39;s relationship was an odd one. Daniel occasionally got to go out with some of the guys who his father tired of, or who were nearing on the end date for the relationship. And it seemed &quot;Luke&quot; had been one of these guys who Daniel was gonna be due to date for a while after Wilkins had to stop owing to the terms his wife set up.<br />
<br />
Daniel remembered one time when an eager cheerleader, wanting to connect with the man a few of her fellows had raved about being excellent in the sack, got together with him briefly. He gave her a taste of his &quot;hot gay dick&quot; and then before long, as Daniel saw other jocks and attractive men, the relationship as it were faded off. There weren&#39;t really any harsh feelings between her and him. It wasn&#39;t exactly something she expected to last for very long. She just wanted to experience it - a commonality with Daniel, who had went through with it for his own reasons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, this new me is definitely oversexed...&quot; Daniel whispered to himself and whistled. Well, there was only one real way to bring in the new body. Heading to the gym and trying it out.<br />
<br />
Daniel swung by his new residence, finding the state of the Wilkins home remarkably well put together but so familiar he barely registered much odd about it. He put on a stringer shirt, short shorts, and a baseball cap and promptly started to head off to the gym after assembling his preworkout and creatine shake. The gym was thankfully nearby, and full of muscled men of varying ages. Daniel made sure he had his little trinket on hand.<br />
<br />
He had some ideas about ways he was gonna use it.<br />
<br />
Daniel walked all the way to the gym, finding himself grinning and flexing his biceps and chest for the reflective windows on nearby cars and vans. His biceps really were nice - no wonder people he fucked asked him so often to flex em. By now, Daniel was thoroughly thinking of himself as &quot;Daniel&quot;. The concept of having once been Luke was distant and barely recognized. Wasn&#39;t Luke the guy Daniel was eventually gonna fuck...? Something weird was going on here.<br />
<br />
He had forgotten at least for now about the message to himself.<br />
<br />
As Daniel went into the gym, first and foremost he saw the man minding the front desk for now. A powerfully built older bodybuilder named Matt Vargas. His hair was styled back and shaved short to conceal the effects that time had on the older man&#39;s hairline. His body was richly tanned and well toned on top of being heavy. It was remarkably clear that Matt was a storied man in the bodybuilding circuit. His biceps must&#39;ve been 20 inches, and Daniel got a little aroused thinking of how built this guy must&#39;ve been in his prime.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Daniel, welcome in.&quot; Matt waved, &quot;How&#39;re you doing today? What&#39;s your workout looking like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, chest today. How about you man?&quot; Daniel asked, deciding he had to know. He had to share the youth around here a bit. The trinket would be capable of copying his youth over to Matt, restoring him to the prime of his vitality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coincidence, I&#39;m about to take my break from my job here and hit chest too. Fuuuck, my chest feels ready to go today.&quot; Matt flexed it and damn! If he looked this good at 55, Daniel was looking forward to seeing what he looked like at 18. &quot;You up to join me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I ever!&quot; Daniel went ahead and started on his preworkout and creatine before checking over, and he felt his cock give an interested pulse as he saw Matt pull off his gym shirt and pull on a thin fabric tank top. Yeah this was gonna be something to see. Matt was something else. Though as Daniel thought back to his memories of this, seeing as the two of them were familiar, he detected that Matt was straight. He was an unmarried man though, and had a few girlfriends back in the day.<br />
<br />
Daniel did wonder about Matt&#39;s exact sexuality - so he decided to hold off on changing it.<br />
<br />
He watched Matt stretch and get limber - if anything made Daniel feel better about doing this, it was seeing that he could probably help Matt with the rigors and pains of old age. Even as muscular and huge as Matt was, he was 55 years old and he was obviously dealing with the resultant strain from a life spent building up a stage ready body.<br />
<br />
Matt took the first lift, to Daniel&#39;s relief, and said, &quot;I&#39;m gonna hit 365, see if I can do it with minimal assist, okay?&quot; He gestured - once they found a free bench press machine in the gym, Matt started loading it up with weight. Once they had the 365 on there, Matt started doing a few more stretched just to make sure. Daniel reflexively put his hands on Matt&#39;s arms to help him steady as he got ready for the lift - just as well starting to work to copy his age on to Matt.<br />
<br />
At first as the transformation barely began Matt needed the liftoff and assist quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Grunting and groaning, Daniel almost did a double take as he watched Matt&#39;s muscles start to smooth out, developing a fuller, more youthful look to them as the transformation worked its magic. Daniel kept pushing the change as Matt pushed through, needing less help as he worked to get the older man changed up. Matt groaned as he felt his shoulders grow thicker, stronger, supporting his lift better. His biceps likewise thickening and his skin turning softer, showing less weathering and scars.<br />
<br />
Daniel watched with eager eyes as he saw the grit jaw of Matt change - his features altering as he returned to his youth. His rough, grizzled features were changing even as Daniel watched. He almost lost track of what he was doing as he saw Matt&#39;s features turn into a vision of the beautiful masculine. Daniel had never even known that Matt was a total pretty boy as a younger man. And as it went on, the more gorgeous Matt got. His features were still strong and masculine, but in a more angular, model-like manner. And the body...!<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s physique was fully developed even then. It honestly made Daniel wonder if Matt cheated at all to get this kind of development early. The traps pushing up that much on his shoulders and the way his abs pushed out did hit Daniel&#39;s &quot;not natty&quot; radar. Matt finished his set with much less assistance from Daniel, and he re-racked the weights with a triumphant shout, and a leap to his feet once he was done...<br />
<br />
...And Matt saw what had become of him. His eyes were drawn to his face. To his youthful physique. He could see his form, returned to how blessedly strong, handsome and developed he was as a younger man. He knew he should&#39;ve been alarmed, disturbed by the fact something had returned him to this. But he was back in his prime! He no longer felt pains whenever he so much as twisted at the torso! He no longer needed to stretch for fifteen minutes before lifting! He was fucking gorgeous again! He could FUCK!<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s knees were wobbling. He knew what was due to come. &quot;I-I...you did this. To me...you did this to me, somehow, Daniel. I just...know it! Ohh...oh fuck! I need to...to go to the restroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
He hurried off with all the urgency of a young man about to blow his load all over himself. Matt only just got to the toilets before he pulled his pants down and fired off his first load in his restored youth all over the seat. He gripped the side of the cubicle, gritting his teeth so he didn&#39;t make TOO many oversexualized moans.<br />
<br />
He was back to being the pretty boy he&#39;d once been. He could fuck women all day and night! Matt rubbed his chin and pulled his pants back up. Grinning to himself, he turned and saw Daniel standing there, observing, with a grin on his face. &quot;Felt pretty good, didn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You regressed me back to this. You&#39;d know!&quot; Matt responded, and then looked over himself, &quot;Fuck I feel good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Daniel said with a shrug, &quot;I know you&#39;re straight and all, pretty boy. But if you wanna experiment a bit before you race on out there, I&#39;m down for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll...mm, I dunno.&quot; Matt crossed his arms over his broad, powerful chest, and looked at Daniel, &quot;Whatever happens, I can think of a pair of other guys who might also greatly benefit from this kind of thing.&quot;</p>
