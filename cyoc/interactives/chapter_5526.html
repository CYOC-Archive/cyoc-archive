<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I'd been poisoned with some concoction as told by the son of a bitch that gave me the stuff. Crumpled into a heap on the men's room floor I moaned from the agony grumbling in my stomac. Odd the kooky story of a man curse by some ole' hag to become a male goat was a fairy tale. Yet there I was being told this long detailed story of a man known as Jughead. The pain was real and the story sounded possible, so I accepted the fate as I expected to be grazing in the morning.<br />
<br />
BANG, went the opening door to that room from hell. &quot;Hey Chuck, what's shaken?&quot; called a gruff sounding fat man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy there buddy this guy must have been poisoned! See him he's doubled over with pain, and look there!&quot; he then said in a whisper.<br />
<br />
One man looked at the other and then down to me. &quot;Looks like fur growing on his ear!&quot; said the man which had just entered.<br />
<br />
I would have discounted him as full of it, but he was dressed as a trucker and not a biker'.<br />
<br />
As one pain changed to pure agony and then subsided a little I crawled toward the toilet stall to boost myself to a standing position. The trucker went to his needs and the other man stood holding my left arm up. Now standing I looked about but the vision of the room was blurry.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, Major I'll help you out the back door but after that your on your own. I wish you all the best in the new body which will be yours to enjoy. Just think ole' Jughead is out there somewhere fucking one nanny goat after another.&quot; <br />
<br />
I groaned as he helped me out the men's room door and down a dark hallway. A kick from his foot sent the back door flying open. &quot;Good luck, Major!&quot; he said as I was pushed out into the early morning blackness.<br />
<br />
The door to the bar slammed shut and I was alone in the cold morning air wondering if all this was true. My hands were shaking from the fear welled up in my throat. I wanted to feel the fur growing on my ears but stopped just short of touching them. Staggering about, I made my way around the building to a cold and locked car.  Turning I remembered my overcoat was still in the bar on the stool next to where I was sitting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it, another ten hours I won't need the car keys let alone any clothes, oh shit!&quot; I grumbled to myself.<br />
<br />
The bar was in the countryside and a good tweleve miles from my apartment. Staggering I placed one foot ahead of the other and began the long walk to either home or a barn to call home.<br />
<br />
Inside the bar the bikers were having a good laugh about my plight. <br />
&quot;Chuck you dirty bastard, did you slip that army guy the ring powder trick again?&quot; asked the trucker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yea, he thinks a friend of mine was cursed by some ole' hag's powder to become a billy goat by morning. He got told all about Jughead, you remember he and Phil went into the old farmhouse after the old hag!&quot; asked Chuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Farmhouse, old hag, shit you idiot I remember Phil went in to grab some sweet pussy girl and enjoyed her for more than two hours. Heck I funned with her she was so willing and all. she was as far from an old hag as I am from being a goat!&quot; said the trucker laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;True, all true, but I remember you grunting and humping her as if your were a goat, Jughead.&quot; chidded Chuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that poor stupid major thinks he's gona' be a billy goat by morning! What happens when he finds out the junk in the ring was just powdered bleach? He's gona' come back looking to kill you, stupid!&quot; said the trucker Jughead.<br />
<br />
So it was I found out all later that Jughead was not a goat, nor was Phil, whoever was not becoming an animal, up my gut ached just terrible.<br />
<br />
I walked stumbling along for many a mile till by some chance the road turned both right and or left. A choice, which way to go, my mind was clouded with pains. A stagger to the right sent me on the way down a dusty dirt road.<br />
<br />
Trees of great old age lined the dirt road. &quot;Planted a hundred years ago by some farmer for a windbreak, no doubt!&quot; I mummbled to myself.<br />
The road narrowed after just a short mile or so. Soon it was just a thin two tracked path with the middle high in weeds.<br />
<br />
A glimer of light from a small house down in a groto. The road seemed to stop there and a single pathway ran down to the house. Holding a tree from falling over I stood looking down the winding path. At last the pain in my gut told me that any port in a storm was just fine, so I walked from tree to tree toward the house.<br />
<br />
A pungent odor hit my nose as the whisp of smoke from the fireplace inside suggest something stank! A thump and my heavy feet touched the boards of the front porch decking.  A soft knock to the door and it opened quickly. A wrinkle faced old man stood looking up at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come in man, your in some kinda bad way!&quot; said the very British speaking man.<br />
<br />
&quot;At the bar, poisoned, I'm changing......&quot; I mumbled.<br />
<br />
The kind old man helped me to a large wood rocking chair and proceeded to pour me a glass of dark red wine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drink it, works wonders on stomac problems, it will give you strength!&quot; suggested the man as he helped my shaky hands to tip up the glass.<br />
<br />
The wine tasted better than anything in the European theater. I sat there and began to tell my story. The man looked at me with concern and made little, if any facial expressions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well let me see those ears for myself.&quot; asked the man as he stood up.<br />
<br />
I leaned forward and turned my head for his best viewing.<br />
<br />
The touch of his cold finger sent a shiver down my spine. Sitting back I looked into his face and asked, &quot;Well what do you see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing, I see nothing, I think sir you have been drugged and dooped into this belief that your changing into a goat. Oh true it is in this strange world the possibility of changing a man from what he was born as to an animal. I've seen much in my long life and that is something which has occured on every continent and in many backwoods places. The empowered ones that have, understand, and know the proper use's of such are few and far between in this country.&quot; explained the man without a slight change in his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I'm not changing, my ears aren't becoming furry?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your the man you were yesterday in from but a wiser man tonight than yesterday!&quot; said the man in a riddle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll kill those bastards for making a fool out of me!&quot; I yelled standing up a little to quickly. My knees buckled and with a plop my butt his the rocker chair seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to get back at them, yes?&quot; asked the man with a small grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to kill'em!&quot; I yelled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no that won't be needed at this time, maybe later, it could be your choice then!&quot; said the man with another riddle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have something in mind, a way to help me get even?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm, yes, but you must leave all things in my hands to work out this plan. I have in my posession a book of very old and very potent black magic spells. These could work wonders on these me and give you the desired fulfilment of your hate. Hate, this is the important word! You do hate them don't you?&quot; asked the man as he searched a bookcase for something.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES, I do!&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh here we go, here it is!&quot; Sittind down in his chair across the room his boney fingers plucked the thick pages. Yes I think this might work, are you willing to be a part in my plan?&quot; asked the man now with a big smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you got, mister?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The man told you the powder might change you as his friend became a goat, right? Well say in the early morning just as they come out to jump on their cycles that a half man half goat creature greets them? I have a spell here that could make you one handsome male satyr. Once the change is done you will have strange powers over men and women when it comes to sex. If you stood before a woman she would becon you to mate with her till hell freezes over. A man, any man would do whatever you suggest to him to do! As you meet this man just tell him to kneel down a suckle your then very goatlike cock. This will cause you pleasure from the satyr form and should you unload your semen into the man's mouth his body will begin to change. One load is allright, two could be bad, three and you will remain a satyr or worse for life. The man of your choice will find himself changing to a goat, but a nanny goat with total human recall. Think, you could doom him to be an animal and best yet a female. The sex lust of a female goat is something to behold. Screw and fuck is all they want! The male goat often lowers his head down and pee's all over the top of his head to becon them in his pungent odors. The nannies' go wild and a round of mounting can go on for hours or even days. The man he was will be in need of being mated daily, think of how you can degrade him in actual form!&quot; suggested the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;You would do this for me for free or is there a fee?&quot; I asked expecting trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no, you would bring the nanny back here and I will reverse the spell and make you the male you wish to be! Think of the power you could wheel about, the change of the man's future, the curse you could put on him for what he did to you, just consider that, sir!&quot; argued the man as I thought.<br />
<br />
Some part of me told me to run from the house but my anger won out and with the nod of my head I agreed.</p>
