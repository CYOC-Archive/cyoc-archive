<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This branch is inspired by the were-breeder branch elsewhere, but is somewhat different in tone and content. Here&#39;s an overview of the curse&#39;s rules. Each time Evan is insulted by a homophobic man, he will change into a straight-acting member of the same social circle as the man who insulted him. He then has the power to change that man (and other homophobes around him as well) by insulting them in various ways. The more he changes them, the more extreme his own changes become. He can change back only after changing the man who first insulted him, making him gay, and having sex with him. After he changes back, he always bears some marks of his changes afterward--if he becomes a jock, for example, when he changes back, he&#39;s more muscular. He can become trapped in a persona as well, if he isn&#39;t careful! This intro has a full cycle of the curse to demonstrate how it functions, but feel free to run with the basic idea in different directions as you want!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Evan was tired of it. Tired of the insults, of being shoved into lockers at school, of guys shouting “faggot” and “queer” at him from the windows of passing cars. All of it. There wasn’t anything he could do about it though--and in his opinion, there wasn’t even anything that “faggy” about him--not like some of the guys he’d seen, or some of the guys in the porn he liked to watch, he supposed. Yeah, he had a bit of a lisp, and he tended to sashay slightly--that, and he definitely loved sucking dick. Still, where the insults would have reduced most people to tears and depression, Evan reacted differently. He was angry. Angry all of the time, so angry, he barely even noticed it anymore, it was just a constant, seething, bubbling mass in his guts that never went away. He’d have fantasies though. Fantasies about the men who bullied him, about beating them, humiliating them, doing what they did to him right back, but tenfold. Maybe it was that, which drew the spirit to him--but in any case, he never really knew why it appeared to him that night in his bedroom, after one particularly cruel fantasy, thinking about some jocks he had a run in with earlier that day. He’d wiped up his cum, and there it had been, a massive, hulking shadow glued to his wall, two bright, gem-like eyes where it’s head was, staring at him.<br />
<br />
The terror in him was unlike anything he’d ever felt before, as it slid along the wall, closer to him. Then, he saw something. A powerful vision overtook him, similar to the fantasy he’d just had, but far more powerful. Bending over Curtis Barrister, the top jock of the school, and Evan raping his hole while he rained abuse down on him--but it was so vivid...like it really was happening. Then, it was gone, and he heard a voice in his mind. <br />
<br />
I can give you the power. You can have your revenge on all of them, if you so desire it.<br />
<br />
For real? Was this just some hallucination? A nightmare? If it was, then does it really matter? He did want it. He had a feeling this thing wouldn’t have come to him, if he hadn’t known he would accept its offer. The darkness slid closer to him, and then slid over him, and everything went dark, and he couldn’t move his body. The darkness was more inside him, and he could feel it, in that anger in his stomach, changing it, changing...him somehow, and he came again, the most powerful orgasm he’d ever had, and then fell right asleep, the spirit chuckling in the dark, as it faded away. Evan would have his revenge, certainly, but it likely wouldn’t be the sort of revenge he was expecting. Anger could twist people in strange ways, after all--and vengeance was never kind to the avenger.<br />
<br />
Evan woke up the next morning, certain it had been a dream, and nothing more. He got up and got ready for school, but he still couldn’t shake the sensation that something about him was different. He was still angry, but it...tasted different, when he felt it, but that didn’t make sense even to him, when he experienced it. There was a definite sense, too, that things would be different today, like how he felt when a thunderstorm was on the way. He said goodbye to his mother, left the apartment and hit the street, walking to school...wondering when the first insult would hit. But the anticipation was different too, in his guts. Usually he just felt fear and anger as he braced himself, but today, part of him was almost...excited. Eager to experience it, and that terrified the rest of him even more. Still, who knew what the day would hold? Maybe everything would be fine. The spirit in him knew better, though--and it was eager to see the curse it had laid on Evan work for the first time.<br />
<br />
He made it all the way to school, however, before the first insult came his way--and sure enough, it was none other than Curtis Barrister himself, and his posse of football friends, calling him a faggot. His face burned red...but he felt that same heat infusing the rest of him too, and he was feeling a bit...sick. He went to the bathroom near the entrance of the school and ducked into one of the stalls--and as soon as he was alone, he looked down, and saw his body was...changing. He grew six inches taller, body filling out with muscle, his skinny jeans and tank top became gym shorts and a t-shirt bearing the mascot of the high school--along with word football. No--he tried to fight it, but there was nothing he could do--when he stumbled out a minute later, Evan was gone--or at least, he wasn’t the Evan he should be. He was...a jock. Strong jaw, flat top, cocky grin, and worst of all, he knew he was best friends with Curtis.<br />
<br />
His head throbbed, and Evan--the gay Evan, receded. In his place, someone else took control of his body, a very, very straight Evan, one who would know exactly how to act around his straight jock friends--and with his girlfriend, Stephanie Hawkins. The whole day was torture, hanging out with his new jock buddies, kissing his girlfriend, making fun of nerds and other jocks...but as he did, Evan noticed something else. Whenever he threw a casual insult at Curtis or one of their friends...they changed. Not much, but enough that he began to understand what this curse was--and what the spirit was offering him.<br />
<br />
After practice, he and Curtis happened to hang back chatting a bit, and showered alone together. He accused Curtis of looking at his cock, and called him a faggot, and watched as his bully started to get hard--and so Evan decided to have his way with him, shoving him up against the shower wall and fucking his loose hole, calling him a faggy sissy, a weak little cocksucker, and watched as his words came to life. When he finally came, it was a very different Curtis who fled the locker room--barely 150 pounds, short, ass and mouth hungry for cock all the time--the exact kind of faggot Curtis had always seen him as. He was horrified by what he’d done--but even more horrified when he saw himself in the mirror of the locker room. He was...massive. Thick with muscle, hairy all over, the exact kind of alpha jock he’d always detested--and feared. This...he wasn’t stuck like this, was he? He could...sense that the curse would, now that he’d dealt with his primary target, let him change back, or he could visit a few of the other jocks on the team too. But if he did...who would he become then? Would he even remember who he’d been before? No--he wanted to change back--he pushed his way forward, and saw the hulking frame in the mirror begin to recede at last.<br />
<br />
He was back in his old body, but not everything was back to normal. He was more muscular for one thing, and he remembered, now, that he was on the track and field team, when he’d never played sports once in his life. He was hairier too--was this all because of what he’d done to Curtis? He got home as quickly as he could, but struggled to fall asleep--and got a text from a number he didn’t know late at night--it was Curtis, looking for a fuck. He had new memories now of Curtis, a hopeless sex addict, as a frequent fuckbuddy at school, and his stomach turned into knots all over again. He could hear the spirit laughing in his very soul, and Evan knew all he could do was wait until someone else insulted him--and he’d be forced to change them as well. Who runs afoul of the curse next?</p>
