<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sore aftermath was what got James stirring first, stretching light limbs and gradually opening his eyes to the still dark room, only looking at the ceiling for some time before his eyes wandered to the mountain of masculinity he&#39;d been last night under the sheets, still sleeping soundly.<br />
<br />
James smiled and brushed his hands across the fuzzy pecs, getting his musclebound boss to chuckle and curl up in his sleep. James could attest how good of an orgasm he&#39;d had and how much Miles probably needed to be sleeping off now, quietly sliding to the edge and standing up.<br />
<br />
Soreness that he&#39;d been proud and savoring two weeks ago just felt like a hassle as he made his way in the direction of the shower, confident Miles wouldn&#39;t mind if he took care of all the now dry cum James had effectively gotten over his legs, needing to stop and pick some bits from his skin.<br />
<br />
As he did while setting up the shower, James couldn&#39;t help but think of this cute little butt from the point of view he&#39;d had just last night. The rush and urge that had apparently followed him back to his own body and the needs of the healthy viral male back in bed. The top&#39;s eleven inches seemed almost angry with the four inches it had to work with, James&#39;s hardon being bad to the point of being almost painful as he patiently waited for Miles&#39;s shower to get its hot water running.<br />
<br />
James was visualizing standing behind this prize of a twink&#39;s frame and holding himself at the base, closing his eyes and breathing deep to fill lungs that felt so small and limited now after the time he&#39;d had, the air filling up with steam and moisture and....<br />
<br />
Miles&#39;s natural scent couldn&#39;t be mistaken for anything else in the mansion, getting a chuckle in response from James who opened his eyes and turned his head, his boss having followed uncharacteristically quietly and flinching after being spotted. &quot;I...&quot; he started to say, but James just reached out his hand for Miles to take. It took a few seconds of processing before he took the outreached hand, following his intern into the running hot water.<br />
<br />
The two stood quietly in the shower in each other&#39;s arms, James not shy about his hardon getting ground up his boss&#39;s abs and squeezing his midsection, nuzzling into the big man&#39;s fuzzy pecs. In turn Miles slid his arms down James&#39;s frame, massaging his lower back before eventually taking a gentle hold of that perfect butt.<br />
<br />
As intimate as it was there were unstated sentiments in the running water. The massive hairy muscles handling the lithe flexible frame was everything both men could want, were it not for the immense envy for the other&#39;s position at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sha.... James, I.....-&quot; Miles started to say to break the silence. &quot;I fucked Vince,&quot; James interrupted, causing Miles to stop and stare. &quot;W...what?&quot; he eventually managed to ask after processing the statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;When.... the first few days I held off even masturbating. It felt rude. But I think we both know how bad your body&#39;s needs get and then I got the Grindr alert on your other phone and I just....&quot; James trailed off, trying to find the words. He wasn&#39;t even sure why he was coming clean with this, he just felt it was important.<br />
<br />
Miles didn&#39;t press for further explanation. He didn&#39;t let James go either. He was thinking. The visual of his body having sex... of James in his body having sex.... of James dominating another man... the little twink&#39;s thirst got a shiver up the eleven inches of space it was currently in.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... you could have just called me you know,&quot; he eventually managed to get out, which got James&#39;s attention. It wasn&#39;t surprise or embarrassment though, it was.... funny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Even though you still had a job to do? That taking my huge meat wouldn&#39;t put you off too much?&quot; James teased, having felt said huge meat start pushing back. &quot;I uh... I might have tried some of your toys...&quot; Miles admitted, only adding to his embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh. I thought my ass was well stretched,&quot; he lied, giving Miles the same squeeze he had a few days ago before giving a slap, getting a small gasp of surprise from the big man. Treatment like that would have gotten a beating and firing bare minimum, but.... that surge of blood and heat was only getting his thick fingers tingling and shivering.<br />
<br />
It was very obvious to both at this point how in character the two still were with this whole thing in spite of having undone the switch. What wasn&#39;t obvious was how unlikely they&#39;d be coming back out of character the longer they held each other in the running water, visualizing how this shower would be as the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;James,&quot; Miles finally managed to say, getting back on to his original point. &quot;I.... was thinking we... could.... spend a bit more time...&quot; he trailed off and bit his lip. Why was this so difficult? He wanted another taste of last night was all, wasn&#39;t it? He&#39;d spent around a week as this perfect twink, was it really so much to spend a weekend as a big man&#39;s piece? Hanging on to this huge hairy arm and being held by it?<br />
<br />
James let his boss continue, feeling the struggle with his words and starting off a sway in the warm water, rubbing those arms full of blood pumping cables that were squeezing together at his sides. Remembering the rush of their pump. Wondering how it felt to push that pump up on that shy little beauty he&#39;d ravaged just last night. Having more time in bed together or maybe even just... <br />
<br />
&quot;Together?&quot; James tried to offer. &quot;Together...&quot; Miles repeated with another trailing off, taking a deep breath. &quot;...and.... since it&#39;s the weekend... the contract doesn&#39;t really have a hard expiration date. So.... maybe the next business day instead?&quot; Miles fumbled. He was usually a better dealmaker than this obvious ass pull. The way the exchange had gone though, he had to assume all his backbone was now being held by the one he was holding. He should have wanted it back but all he really wanted was to go back.<br />
<br />
The one with that backbone was still smiling and letting the big man keep finding his words and wants. Where Miles was trying to deal with all this flustered stammering James could only admire how cute it all was. When the next pause went on for a few seconds, James patted Miles&#39;s neck and pulled him down to bend and squat a bit in order to push their lips together in their first kiss. It was gentle and uncertain on Miles&#39;s part, letting James guide and push into opening up into something more intimate.<br />
<br />
Miles stood back up, lifting James with him while the kiss continued slowly, the two men sharing some space and eventually some tongue before their faces popped apart for some air, followed by shared gentle laughs. &quot;Anything you want. But we should probably get dressed first,&quot; James said. Miles blinked a few times before his eyes widened some in a genuine smile, setting James back down.<br />
<br />
Switching off the hot water and reaching for a towel, James stepped out of the shower and reached his hand back in for Miles to take, getting to work drying him off before the two quietly made their way back to the bedroom. James made sure to quietly shut the door behind them, the sun having yet to rise, turning back to see Miles already back on the bed with the ring on and his other hand slick and well up his sculpted glutes, a struggling expression on his face.<br />
<br />
James let him try to prep for a bit before stepping in and gently grabbing his wrist, getting Miles to flinch and snap out of his focus. &quot;How about you let me set this up?&quot; he offered, and Miles chuckled and nodded. &quot;Yes sir,&quot; he said, blinking a few times before realizing what had just slipped out, his eyes widening before he turned away, too embarrassed to say anything else and instead just laying on his front.<br />
<br />
Focusing more on the muscled body and less on the Freudian slip, James made his way up his boss&#39;s beefed out legs and brought his face down to that ass. Not missing a beat, James pushed in and got to work eating the big man out, his experienced tongue sending shivers up the huge muscles and getting a groan out of Miles.<br />
<br />
He still felt and tasted like the prized specimen of masculinity in spite of how he&#39;d acted the past half hour, being so good that James actually felt a modicum of regret. Wouldn&#39;t be any real way to have this huge man while he was this huge man. But then in trade.... James continued working his tongue with his focus on what they&#39;d both be getting out of this.<br />
<br />
Pleasuring and preparing for several minutes, James eventually brought himself back up for the main event. That juicy backside was good and slick at this point for his eager four incher, not taking long to line himself up and get up to the edge. Miles&#39;s broad back rising in a deep breath in James&#39;s view seemed be out of bracing himself, but James could see the hints of a smile from the bits of Miles&#39;s face he was able to see from this angle as he pushed past the edge.<br />
<br />
Miles exhaled sharply and grit his teeth. Even if James was smaller it was still his body&#39;s first time bottoming with there being little to no pleasure or experience to savor the experience. James could attest how difficult the first few times were for himself and sympathized with how badly Miles was clenching up. It was a challenge to be sure, with James only able to lean on the experience and instinct he&#39;d soaked up from his time as Miles, those toned glutes squeezing together reflexively as the twink of a top made his patient advance.<br />
<br />
The uphill challenge of everything was spoiling the majority of the enjoyment with James almost feeling the urge to give up before he spotted the ring on Miles&#39;s finger beginning to shimmer. This was enough as it were in spite of how objective were both being this time, Miles getting confirmation himself through the ring&#39;s warmth as his breaths started to get more shallow in excitement. The only thing they both needed to keep doing was keep it up as the pressure rose.<br />
<br />
Miles was struggling to relax and had gone from smiling to biting down on the sheets, his fingers opening wide before closing in a death grip on the smooth sheets, James tucking his head down and taking slower breaths, trying to let instinct get him the last tenth left he needed. The climax was more than built but the anxious beefcake taking him was squeezing so much his rim may as well have been a cockring keeping anything from getting any further. It was all escalating in pressured pleasure from the inside but on the outside both men looked to be in a tense mutual pain.<br />
<br />
Arching his back and drawing on whatever energy he had, James forced himself around even though that rim was clamped tight on his base, Miles picking up on the rhythm and trying to buck back and add to their hump. The two bodies colliding were awkward and rough in the act but it still got the action needed, James curling his fingers into Miles lower back as his cock finally shuddered and popped off as deep as it could up Miles innards.<br />
<br />
Feeling the warmth and release, Miles smiled and let out a groan while his thick cock dribbled pre and a bit of its own cum, having gotten its own stimulus amidst all this while he took James load, still locked tight until he took some controlled breaths. It wasn&#39;t instant, but eventually his anxious grip was able to ease up and let James empty meat back out, his intern dripping sweat and trying to catch his breath, instead collapsing on Miles&#39;s broad back, having gotten milked dry by his ass&#39;s vice grip.<br />
<br />
Knowing the short time he had before passing out himself, Miles pulled James from his back to his side and rolled on to his back himself, pulling James in to cuddle. It was selfish, but his big meat shivered with anticipation with the knowledge his first view when he woke up himself would be these fuzzy juicy pecs, a smile forming on Miles&#39;s face before he passed out as well with James in his arms.</p>
