<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is a revision to The 1&#39;s chapter, <b>&quot;Value of Death&quot;</b>. <br/>
It is true that the chapters I wrote are loosely based on drafts The 1 had created. Being in this discord server, I wanted the story to move on and stop wasting time on parts with low priority. The creation of those chapters are my way of integrating it into the story, therefore, the concept isn&#39;t wasted, but not too heavy to read for a low priority event.<br/>
<br/>
The story must go on after all, and I don&#39;t want a multi-chapter branch where it would take much of our time to complete a mystery on who stole the tome. Most of the ideas are improvisations, altered to fit my ideals.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of them are serendipitous, and therefore pretty original :D</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ilvir turned once more towards Nat, who sat underneath a cloud tree unpacking several items related to her current work. A map and object that could best be described as an ink pen were laid out onto the slightly bumpy ground.<br />
<br />
“You said you wanted to teach me magic,” Nat claimed without her gaze ever leaving the map, plotting a path they would take later. Looking straight into Ilvir’s frozen orbs when he did not respond, her face grew solemn. “You promised me.”<br />
<br />
Ilvir briefly recalled Isaac’s promise, not a word spilling from his mouth, for he did not know how to answer. Isaac was the one that made the promise, not him. He didn’t need to teach her magic at all, and the need was growing stronger despite Chirp’s constant milking.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps… But, you&#39;re going to have to wait a <em>bit</em> longer, Nat. I have priorities.” Ilvir turned away from Nat’s would-be disappointed face before she could muster a response.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t handle that kind of face, not him, nor the words she would spout. <br />
<br />
Shrugging the lingering thought away, Ilvir continued his search for a private area to relieve this body’s growing need to burst and release. For all he knew, the onslaught of lust could have been wrought by his current mental state. Isaac&#39;s calm and collected stance and mentality tended to keep the production of his seed at a minimal and manageable rate.<br />
<br />
Him on the other hand...<br />
<br />
Pawing his crotch armor, Ilvir could feel this body’s heft even underneath the metal pouch. The gentle suckling of the cloud dragon inside it was euphoria.<br />
<br />
<i>”He’s strange… hehe...”</i><br />
<br />
A burst of fading laughter echoed in the wind briefly catching his attention. His attention, however, was unneeded, for the voice did not return.<br />
<br />
Left to himself, Ilvir&#39;s mind drifted to his time as a fully corrupted werewolf, how much pleasure he had gained from the process of corruption. Once he had found himself within Isaac&#39;s body, memories he knew he had lost when Isaac transferred the corruption and restored him returned yet it was reduced to a mere trickle, a trickle that grew in intensity and strength upon his entrance into the Halo. <br />
<br />
He remembered clearly now, and what he did was his dream.<br />
<br />
He believed he was living his dream life, constantly horny and erect, ready to corrupt more as he hunted for living beings that could respond, fucking them senseless as he deposited his seed deep into them and watching them transform while he was knotted deep inside them.<br />
<br />
Lost in reminiscence of his past life, he remembered a female werewolf that submitted to her alpha, him, as she pleased him with mindblowing sex. He remembered even as he was under the influence of corruption, he lived a life of pure enjoyment.<br />
<br />
He knew, there were children that had been born from his passionate lovemaking with the female, and he knew they were roaming in the world, doing what he once did.<br />
<br />
And now…<br />
<br />
He felt guilt tug at his conscious. <br />
<br />
Isaac aimed to destroy the corruption at its roots, and he knew, despite the fact that they were not of official marriage, they were still his children.<br />
<br />
He had been thinking while he was deep within Isaac’s mind, overhearing Isaac’s disdain for the Dark Knights; Paladins that used the Corruption to pursue pleasure without being corrupted, corralling corrupted beings for their own gain.<br />
<br />
Isaac’s mental musings were loud and deafening. His thoughts were not weak or restrained, but free and powerful. His indecision of choosing to become a True Paladin or a Dark Knight plagued his thoughts and brought guilt.<br />
<br />
Ilvir, however, could care less for Isaac&#39;s choices. <br />
<br />
He craved to become a Dark Knight. Since that fateful day, he&#39;d witnessed the copulation of the werewolf that corrupted a woman, the passionate lovemaking they had made upon fully converting and the throes of climax. <br />
<br />
That was all he desired.<br />
<br />
And yet... <br />
<br />
There were no records of Dark Knights, any living ones long dead. Even before his corruption, they were already gone and non-existent. He had chosen to become a Paladin to find a way to restore the Dark Knights.<br />
<br />
It would be his dream to become the head of the newly resurrected Dark Knights, and no longer being under someone else.<br />
<br />
But now, he needed release.<br />
<br />
Ilvir willed the armor to part from his crotch;  allowing Isaac’s twin penises, fully erect and leaking the glowing purple essence, to spring to full length. Ilvir glanced at his surroundings, finding that in his musing, he had walked into a small clearing fully private with the wall of cloud trees blocking all vision.<br />
<br />
<i>”...Woah.”</i><br />
<br />
Ilvir perked his ears after hearing a gasp of admiration, coming from somewhere around him. He couldn’t see them, but soft laughter echoed from the trees as if they were the ones that laughed.<br />
<br />
“Who goes there?!” Ilvir roared to nothing, frustrated that someone was watching him. “Come out now!”<br />
<br />
Giggles so soft they could have been wind whistling erupted around him, causing Ilvir to growl in anger.<br />
<br />
<i>”Follow us.”</i><br />
<br />
Amongst the trees, Ilvir faintly saw movement. It seemed like a haze in the shape of a cloud folk, swiftly running away from him.<br />
<br />
Ilvir grinned.<br />
<br />
During his werewolf life, and even before, there was one activity he always enjoyed.<br />
 <br />
<i>Hunting.</i><br />
<br />
Tucking the erections back into the metal pouch, Ilvir gave chase.<br />
<br />
“I’ll catch you.”<br />
<br />
==================================================================<br />
<br />
Ilvir stopped upon seeing that the mirage was heading into a cave opening, disappearing upon its entry. It was an obvious trap, but Ilvir was confident he could handle it. <br />
<br />
<i>”Come in…”</i><br />
<br />
With resolve, Ilvir stepped into the cave with a ball of light erupting in his palm. It had been quite a while and his power had returned.<br />
<br />
The giggles echoed further in, some gasps of adoration and lust heard deep within. The faint scent of birds infused deeply with clouds filled the cavern.<br />
<br />
Trudging deeper, Ilvir halted at what could be called an atrium, the walls carved with perches and holes. He could feel the presence of creatures here, but could not pinpoint their exact location.<br />
<br />
“I’m here, what do you want?” Ilvir glared at the perches, daring them.<br />
<br />
<i>”We.”</i><br />
<br />
Ilvir turned towards the voice that had spoken behind him. Nothing there.<br />
<br />
<i>”Want.”</i><br />
<br />
Again, he turned towards the source, but there was nothing there as well. Ilvir didn’t panic, he knew he could defeat them.<br />
<br />
“You.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Quickly facing forwards, Ilvir saw the area in front of him shimmer before a paragon of beauty revealed herself. She was beautiful, young and perky. Her naked form displayed to him in full clarity within the light he was casting.<br />
<br />
He noted, however, that she had wings attached to her arms, feathers lined her body and covered places where pubic hair might have appeared on a human woman.<br />
<br />
She walked up to him and pressed her body against his abs needfully, purring all the while.<br />
<br />
An action that aroused him beyond measure.<br />
<br />
It was even more pronounced when more of the females appeared through the mirages, entering his field of view. Paragons of the female form ogling at him, lusting for him.<br />
<br />
He could smell their arousal.<br />
<br />
And being a part werewolf, he could feel the beast within him stir, awakened once more.<br />
<br />
Ilvir gasped when the woman pressed against him caressed his pouch with claws, the vibration of metal being scratched sending a surge of pleasure straight into his head, and he growled in response.<br />
<br />
“Wh- what do you mean, me?” Ilvir questioned through his heady arousal, growling in need. <br />
<br />
She giggled, pawing the pouch with suppressed lust. “Oh, just your seed.”<br />
<br />
“W-Why?” Ilvir asked back.<br />
<br />
“We harpies can’t give birth to males.” She licked her lips and looked up to Ilvir, pouting. “But we can bear harpy children with any male, although the success rate had been really low.”<br />
<br />
“We always wanted more children, but we couldn’t afford to be discovered.” Another harpy swooped to latch behind him, her feathered arms hugging his neck from behind. “Besides, you won’t die from exhaustion, stud.” <br />
<br />
Ilvir halted in thought, weighing his choices. They wanted him, or at least, Isaac’s body. <br />
<br />
His seed.<br />
<br />
He recalled his werewolf children, the product of his copulation with many werewolf mates. Incest was not a matter to him, for the corruption did not care for the roots of a being.<br />
<br />
“Die from exhaustion?” Ilvir questioned again, mind cleared from the heady arousal temporarily.<br />
<br />
“Yes… The cloud folk men had to give a piece of their essence to us for us to get young, and with many of us, they usually are drained bar a little amount.” She licked his armored abs, leaving a trail of cloud saliva on Isaac’s armor. “If they die, they’re food.”<br />
<br />
“Live, and we make them forget.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Ilvir found an opportunity here, a chance to get his release and potentially impregnate every single harpy here. <br />
<br />
He found himself grinning at the thought of how Isaac would rage upon knowing he had more than a dozen children later on.<br />
<br />
The pouch containing his rods split open, releasing the treasure they all wanted. Chirp, happily sucking away felt the mental command for it to fly away, and it did.<br />
<br />
Flying to the top of the atrium, Chirp hovered and happily flew. Ilvir noted that it definitely looked bigger.<br />
<br />
“A cloud dragon child, how interesting…” Ilvir looked to the harpy who had wonder in her eyes, Ilvir grinned and cupped her beautiful face with his claws.<br />
<br />
“You wanted me, now, come.” <br />
<br />
The harpy grinned and splayed her wings apart, ready to take Ilvir.<br />
<br />
Ilvir gasped when the harpy sat on one of his rods, her clit stretching open to accept him. The cloud harpy didn’t care about the size discrepancy and pushed.<br />
<br />
Ilvir, for the first time, felt the sensitivity of Isaac’s monstrous chimeric penis penetrate the clit filled with lightning, gasping at the shock it brought with it.<br />
<br />
The harpies went wild, and Ilvir’s mind whited out among the flurry of feathers and blinding pleasure.<br />
