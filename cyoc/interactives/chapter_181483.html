<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen won by a landslide. Her full butt was indeed built for absolute speed. But there was a much bigger reason for her easy win. Samantha failed to take into consideration her new riding location. Being inside of Chiffon&#39;s pussy meant that when Chiffon leaned all the way forward to go her fastest, she actually ended up pushing Samantha&#39;s face right into the dirt. <br />
<br />
After buying the lunch Samantha and the rest all set down in a shady area of the park and ate. Samantha even provided everyone with some fresh grapes. It was at this time when Samantha also brought up a topic she had been thinking about. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jen and Rachel, Me and Chiffon have decided to get a place for ourselves in the nearby bouncerbutt sanctuary. Things just are a bit too different at home where I kind of feel like having our own place would be the best for everyone. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Chiffy&#39;s parents are very accommodating for us, but I can&#39;t stop feeling as if we are imposing on them now. It isn&#39;t always easy having a bouncerbutt in the house afterall. So I guess what I am saying is that we are getting a home for ourselves, and I was thinking of getting one that is meant for 2 bouncerbutt duos to share, that is, if you were interested.&quot; Offers Samantha. <br />
<br />
Jen and Rachel haven&#39;t thought that much about it, but now that they were, they could definitely see it. For one, Jen&#39;s house had to be completely relaid out to accommodate her rare condition on top of being a bouncerbutt. And since it was an older home too, her parents were even considering renovating the flooring just to be sure Jen and Rachel wouldn&#39;t break through it one day. They had not put any money down as of yet on doing it, but her parents had considered postponing their aniversary vacation in order to uze that extra money to do so, as that wasn&#39;t covered by the reno unit, as it wasn&#39;t necessary to be done immediately in order to make the building able to be considered &quot;safe and livable&quot; for bouncerbutts. <br />
<br />
&quot;What would rent be like?&quot; Asked Rachel first. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that is the thing... I have been thinking about if maybe we could use the curse to somehow get it for free, and I think we could if we are careful with how we word it.&quot; Replied Samantha, but then added &quot;but that is also risky, as it could go bad if we were to overlook something. Like, if we were to dare ourselves to own a place there, then we could be charged with paying property taxes, utilities, and even the mortgage, even though we should only be renting the place with all utilities paid for by the owners of the whole facility.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I see what you mean. What about school, would we need to transfer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its right near the school, like just a few minutes to bouncy bouncy even.&quot; Said Chiffon who was still hungry, but Samantha had stopped putting food in front of her face to eat (Samantha didn&#39;t take off her blindfold so she was being fed by her hand). &quot;Oops, sorry, here you go&quot; said Samantha as she fed another few grapes to Chiffon before holding up the other half of her sandwich.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like the idea, we can spend more time having sex then if we have our own place&quot; answered Jen bluntly and in the most simplistic way. That was her entire say in the matter, as she immediately went back to eating. Rachel blushed a bit because that also was her #1 reason as to why she liked the offer as well, but she was just too embarrassed to admit it openly like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I also do agree with Jen&#39;s reasoning, and I am interested too in living out of their home, as I personally feel as if I am imposing a bit, eventhough they say all assure me that I am not.&quot; Said Rachel.<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded at that &quot;I completely agree, as it is the same exact thing here for me to. So I take it that you both are in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep. You can add us to the residence list. I will be sure to bring the curse along with us too.&quot; Confirmed Rachel with a joke.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Jen gasped excitedly and began hopping rapidly away from the picnic area before Rachel could even ask about what had gotten Jen all excited suddenly. But that answer was soon understood as Jen started shouting at another rider/bouncerbutt pair. The bouncerbutt did actually kind of resemble Jen now that Rachel gave her a better look. Perhaps this was her cousin? And she also had no legs too, which initially surprised Rachel, but then only further convinced her that Jen was actually cursed to become a bouncerbutt, and not a natural one like Chiffon, as part of her apparent curse clearly stated that she would become exactly like her cousin. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEEEYYYYY RILEY!&quot; Cried Jen. The girl, who turned out to really be her cousin, looked over and immediately took off directly onto a collision course with Jen. She had the same dumb but elated look on her face that Rachel had gotten use to seeing on Jen&#39;s recently everytime something of great interest caught her attention. &quot;Yep, these two are definitely related.&quot; Thought Rachel, chuckling to herself before she braced herself for the inevitable impact as the two bouncerbutts readied themselves for a full speed butt bounce greeting.</p>
